Epigramma.
Hoc operis quodcunque pater dignissime cernis
Holtiades domino dedicat omne suo
Author vt instituit tantillum opus edere primum
Et tibi non tactas dedere primitias
Incussit validos tanti censura timores
Patris: ab incepto me tua pena trahens
Sed tamen in miseros pietas quam suggeris om^es
Et michi presentem plus pius ipse facis
Abscidit a pauido vanos michi cord timores
Quod michi mentis erat / perfice / perge / iubens
Ergo faue lingue censor venerande latin
Tameito vix natum ne moriatur opus
Quicquid erit placido supplex precor excipe vultu
Ingenium arbitrio dasque rapisque tuo
Hec equidem in varium breuiter collecta moretum.
Ex multis rapui furta pudica locis
Unde tui causam pater alma dedere nepotes
In sibi perpetuas vtilitatis opes
Edideram celebri Lamithe pie presul in aula
Digna volens pueris commoda far tuis.
Thome more / diserti adolescentuli in lucubraciunculas Holtiade. Epigramma.
Quem legis Holtiade tenerum pia furta libellum
Seu vir seu pueres / lac puerile voca
Dulce / sed et meritum liber hic me iudice nomen
Lactea qui pueris dogmata prestat / habet
Uos angli legite hec iuuenes / in maxima quorum
Exiguum quamuis commoda surgit opus
Que vos in minimu^ legitis digesta libellum
Precepta in paucos pauca legenda dies
Holtiades eadem vigili quesita labor
Legit ab innumeris pauca voluminibus
Sedulis ille vagis sese circu^tulit agris.
Mellifice officio quam been functus apis
Quicquid ibi in dulces sapidi congessit aceruos
Mellis in hunc paruum retulit alueolum
Hoc opus anglorum cupienti intrare iuuente
Prima sit in reliquam ianua grammaticam
Hanc tamen ante forem docti struxere / sed horum
Quisque suos latio / fecerat ore modos
Quid been fulta penus prodest tibi / qua^do retentat.
Ianua magnificos irreseranda cibos
Angle puer latio quid ages sermon / sapisse
Non potes in primo verba latina die
Te decet altricis tenerum recubare sub alis
Discereque ex verbis non tua verba tuis
Structa / sed et verbis iam pridem ianua nostris
Grammatice / verum si fateamur erat /
Illa tamen vetus et tunsu lacerata frequenti
Que xix assiduo pulsa labor crepat
Ianua nostra noua est / tenereque facillima turbe
Ad digiti minimu^ quam cito aperta sonum
Diuisio operis and modus procedendi per ordinem.
Ne ve tamen possis dubitare quis ordo libelli
Huius erit paucis accipe versiculis
Hoc opus in ternas libuit distinguere parts
Quarum ex quaque trium quid doceare loquar
Sermonum parts partique cadentia cui vis
Digerit in numeros pars tibi prima suos
Tum numerata prius diffinit queque secunda
Eque sua quod vis proprietate notat
Iungere terna docet sublata fasce duarum
Concordanciolis verba latina tribus
Multa tamen varios and verba and nomina casus
Diuersoque regunt imperiosa modo
Subdit hec etiam neu quicquam deesse queraris
Quod verbis decuit te didicisse tuis
Huc puer ad doctas o qui modo cunque lituras
Es rudis et velles non rudis esse / veni
Qua^ satis in laudem es / long magis esse fatere
Dives et ingenii diuitiores opus.
Prima pars opuscull
THere ben. viii. parts of speech. Nowne Pronowne. Uerbe. Aduerbe. Partycyple
Coniunctyon. Preposicyon. and Interiectyo^. Where of. iiii. be declyned and
mouable / as Nowne / Pronowne: Uerbe: and particyple. And. iiii. vndeclyned and
immovable. as Aduerbe: Co^iunctyon: Preposicyon: and Interiectyon. Of these.
iiii. parts mouable / three be declyned with case / as Nowne: Pronowne. and
Partycyple. And verb only without case.

Five things be expedient to the declynynge of a nowne. Article. Case: Gendre.
Nombre: and Decle^son

Artycles be three. hic hec and hoc.

Also this aduerbe of calling O. has the rowme of an article in every vocatyf
case.

Cases be. vi. Nominatyf. Genityf. Datyf. Accusatyf. Uocatyf. and the Ablatyf.

Gendres be five. The masculyne / as hic poeta.

The feminyne / as hec musa. The neutre as hoc templum. The comyne / as hic et
hec sacerdos. All gendres / as hic et hec et hoc felix.

Nombres be two. The synguler / and plurell

Declenson of artycles follows.
Declenson of artycles.


Declensons be five.
The first is known by his examples. Poeta and musa. And evermore his genityf
case sy^guler ends in e. and all nownes of the first declenson shall be
declyned after one of them.

The second by his examples / magister: radius: and templum. And evermore his
genityf case synguler ends in i. and all nownes of the second declenson. etc.

The third by his examples. Bonitas: sacerdos and vulnus. And evermore his
genityf synguler ends in is. and all nownes of the third declenson etc.

The fourth by his examples. Uisus: and manus And evermore his genityf case
synguler ends i^ us and all nownes of the fourth declenson etc.

The fyfth by his examples. species and meridies. And evermore his genityf case
synguler ends in ei and all nownes of the fyfth declenson etc.

The dyuysyon of nownes
Of nownes. Some be propre / some appellatyf some substantyf / some adiectyf /
some interrogatyf / some demonstratyf / some reddityf / and some relatyf

Declenson of substantives
A nowne substantyf is declyned with one article as hic Poeta. or with two at
the most / as hic et hec sacerdos.

Examples of the first declenson.
Hic poeta. huius te huic te. hunc poetam. o poeta. ab hoc poeta. The plurell
hi poet: horum poetarum: his poetis hos poetas: o poet: ab his poetis.

Here is to be noted / that in every plurell nombre the vocatyf shall be like
the nominatyf / and the ablatyf like the datyf. Also when the nominatyf
singular of this declenson ends in as or in es / thou shall put awayes to
make the vocatyf / as hic Thomas / hic Anchises o thoma. o anchise. In all
other of this declenson the vocatyf shall be like the nominatyf as hic poeta: o
poeta.

The synguler. Hec musa: huius muse: huic muse. ha^c sam. o sa. ab hac sa. The
plurell he muse. haru^ sarum his sis. has sas. o muse: ab his musis.

Here is to be noted that these. vii. nownes in this verse makes the datyf and
ablatyf plurell both in is and in abus

Filia nata deas liberta mulabus equabus.

Also the scripture uses aiabus: famulabus: dn^abus / the which of all such
other be not of use

These nownes of Hebrewe Pascha: manna: zizania. and mammona. be the neutre
gendre and of no declenson. Though we find in holy scripture the genityf and
datyf in e. more of use than of rule / and like wise Adam and Abraham. As for
alpha and iota and generally all names of letters they be both neutre and
vndeclyned And some lettred men say hoc pascha paschatis. And polenta is the
feminyne gendre: vt Plautus. Ubi nequam homines polentam pransitant / how be it
Ouide uses him in the neutre gendre / as Dulce dedit testa quod coxerat ante
polenta:

Examples of the second declenson.


Here is to be noted that the datyf and the ablatyf synguler of this declenson
ends always in o.

Hic radius. huius dii. huic dio hu^c diu^ o die. ab hoc dio. The plurell his
radii: horum radiorum: his radiis. etc

All nownes of this declenson that in the nominatyf synguler ends in us.
changes us in e. in the vocatyf / as hic radius o e hic dn^s o e. hic petrus
o e. Except iii appellatyues filius deus and agnus / filius makes fili deus
and agnus be like the noi^atyf also agnus makes agne. Save propre names of men
in ius. that does a way us and than remains ye vocatyf / as hic virgilius o
virgilii. hic gregorius o ri.

Else in latin the vocatyf shall be like the noi^atyf by chau^gynge the article
in to o / as hic vir o vir.

Hoc templu^ huius pli. huic plo. hoc plu^. o plu^ ab hoc plo The plu. hec
te^pla. horum plorum. his plis hec pla. o pla.

Here is to be noted that all nownes of the neutre gendre / of what declenson
that ever they be shall have. ii. cases like in both nombres / the nominatyf
accusatyf and vocatyf / as in templu^. and these. iii. in ye plurell nombre
evermore end in a. outake ambo and duo the which be thus declyned.

The plurell Ambo be bo. borum barum borum. bobus babus bo bus. bos bas bo. bo
be bo. bobus babus bobus. And so is duo declyned in every case. In the third /
fourth and fyfth declenson / the nominatyf accusatyf and vocatyf plurell shall
always be like / of what gendre soever yt nownes be / vt exempla docebunt.

Examples of the third declenson.
Hec bonitas huius tatis huic tati. hanc tate^. o tas. ab hac te. The plurel he
tes. harum tum. his tibus.

et has tes etc

Hoc vulnus huius eris. huic ri. hoc nus. o nus ab hoc nere. The plurell hec

When the noi^atyf synguler of this declenson ends in is and ye genityf
plurell in iu^. than may ye accusatyf plurell end both in es and in is. as hic
ignis horum ignium hos ignes and ignis. hec restis harum restiu^ has restes et
restis. hic hec testis horum harum testiu^ hos has testes and testis. hic hec
oi^s horum harum oi^m hos has oe^s and oi^s.

Examples of the fourth declenson
Hic visus huius sus. huic sui hu^c sum. o sus ab hoc visu The plu. hi sus.
horum suu^. his sibus. hos sus. etc.

Hec manus huius nus. huic iii. ha^c nu^. o nus. ab hac nu.

The plu. he nus. harum uum. his nibus. has nus. etc.

Here is to be noted that these nownes following make their datyf and ablatyf
plurell in ubus. But all other of his declenson keep i before bus. Uersus

Partus portus acus ticus lacus artus et archus.
Over cubus atque veru tribus and specus exit in ibus
Examples of the fyfth declenson.
Hic meredies huius ei. huic ei. hunc em. o es. ab hoc e.

The plurell hi meridies horum eru^. his ebus etc.

Hec species huius ei. huic ei. hanc em. o es. ab hac c.

In the first and the last declenson / the genityf and datys of the first
nombre be always like / as huius poet, huic poet. huius meridiei. huic

Also all nownes of the fyfth declenson lack three cases in the plurell nombre
/ that is to say / the genityf datyf and ablatyf. except these in these verses

Progenies vel maneries dic materiesque.
Spes acies facies sic res speciesque diesque.
Declenson of adiectyues.
Of adiectyues some be declyned with. iii. artycles and one terminacyon / as
hic hec hoc felix: some with three artycles and. ii. terminacyons: as hic hec
turpis et hoc turpe. some with three artycles and three terminacyons / as hic
saluber: hec salubris. et hoc salubre: some with. iii. diverse endynges only.

All manner adiectyues with. iii. diu erse endynges oonly be the first declenson
and the second of nownes and like one of these. The mixte

Hic saluber: hec salubris and hoc salubre. huique salubris huic salubri. hunc

Campester volucer (...) pedester equester
Siluester celeber acerque (...) saluber
Tale paluster opus tale sequester habet
The which all were sometime declyned like turpis Also it is to be noted that
all adiectyues like to turpis or saluber. make the adiectyf synguler oonly in
i. But all comparatyues and adiectyues of one termi nacyon make both in e and
in i.

Sequitur figura terminationu^ instar sex candelarum:

Figura quinque declinationum.


Degrees of comparyson.
All adiectyues that betoken things that may be made more or less / may
receive comparyson / as fay te / more fair / less fair / most fair / lest
fair / or else fair fayrer fairest.

There be three degrees of comparyson / the posityf the comparatyf / and the
superlatyf.

De cognitione positiut.
The posytyf is grounder and foundament of the comparatyf and superlatyf /
without excess / and he is not formed / as fair / foul / white / black

De cognitione comparatiui
The comparatyf passes his posityf with this english word more or less /
or else his english ends in er / as more fair / less fair or fayrer / and
his latin ends in or. or else he has this aduerbe magis or minus joined to
his posityf / as doctior. or else magis doctus: vel minus doctus.

De cognitione (...).
The superlatyf passes his posityf with this english word most or lest /
or else his english ends in est / as more fair / less fair or fairest and
his latin ends in mus. ma. mum. or else he has this ad uerbe maxim or minime
Joined to his posityf / as doctissimus ma. mum. or else maxim doctus. maxim
docta. maxim doctum. minime doctus. minime docta. doctum.

Here is to be noted that all comparatyues be declyned after doctior. and all
superlatyues like bonus bona bonum.

De formatione comparatiui.
The co^paratif is formed of is positif of his first case that ends in i. by
putting to this terminacio^ or / else us as doctus cta ctum. (...) us. tenuis
te nuis tenui tenuior us. felix cis ci. felicior ue.

Out of this rule ben except these. vi. nownes following the which make both
the comparatyf and supcrlatyf out of rule / as Bonus melior optimus. ma lus
peior pessimus. magnus mayor maximus. paruus minor minimus: and paruissimus.
multus plus plurimus. nequam nequior nequissimus. Also iuuenis ma keth (...).
Senex senior. and lacks the neutre in us and also the superlatyf degree.

Such adiectyues that end in us and have a vowel before us. have now no
co^paratyf in or. but al way this word magis / and the posityf shall supplye
the rowme of the comparatyf / as piue (...) pius. perpetuus magis perpetuus.
extraneus magis extrane us. In such the supcrlatyf follows the rule / as pius
pussimus strenuus issimus. If thou find any other wise / it is excused by
antiquyte.

All nownes that makes their comparatyf in or may make the comperatyf with
magis or minus. and the posityf. Buth such yt end in us with the vowell etc.
may no wise make the comparatyf in or.

Other parts of reason make comparyson as this verb detero makes deterior for
his co^peratyf and de terrimus for his superlatyf. Also participles going in
to nownes / as amans amantior tissimus

These aduerbes and preposicyons in these verses with many other moo / make the
comparatyf and superlatyf indirectly. Uersus.

Ante / citra / prope / post / extra / supraque vel infra
Intra / nuper / ocys / vltraque / pridem / penitusque
Pene / penesque / diu / sepe /
Ante / anterior / caret superlatiuo.
Citra citerior citimus Ocys ocior ocissimus Prope propior proximus Ultra
vlterior vltimus. Post posterior postremus Pridem prior primus Extra exterior
extremus et extimus Penitus penitior penitissimus. Supra superior supremus / et
sumus Pene vel penes penior penissimus. Infra inferior infimus. Diu diutior
diutissimus. Intra interior intimus. Sepe sepeus sepussime Nuper nuperior
nuperimus

There be also some nownes yt makes their comparatyf in rule and lack their
superlatyf / as Serus serior. Celsus / celsior.

De formatione superlatiuorum.
The superlatyf is formed of his posityf of the first case that ends in i.
by putting to s and simus / as. Doctus docta doctu^. docti. doctissimus. Felix
felicis felici felicissimus. Except his posityf end in er. For than he makes
the superlatyf by putting to rimus as. Niger nigerrimus. Saluber saluberrimus
with double rr. Save Dexter makes always dextimus Sinister sinistimus.

Also facilis makes facillimus with double ll. So both agills make agillimus.
gracilis gracilimus. humilis humilimus: and similis simillimus. with their com
pounds. Also maturus makes maturimus and maturissimus. vetus veterrimus.

These it superlatyf degrees Intimus and proximus may sometime be as (...) / and
has for their co^paratyues intimor and proximor / and lacks their
supcrlatyues All adiectyues in cus ye come of dico facio and loquor change us
in entior for the comparatyf / and in entissimus for the superlatyf / as
magnificus centio. centissmus. fatidicus centior ce^tissimus. gra^diloquus
quentior que^tissimus. if thou find any other wise it is excused by antiquyte
/ as mirificior mirificissimus.

Declenson and diuisyon of pronownes.
Here be. xv. pronownes beside their compoundes / as Ego: tu: (...): (...):
ipse: iste: hic and is: meus: tuus: suus: no ster: vester. nostras: and
vestras. Of the which. viii. be primatyues / as Ego tu sui etc. and. vii.
deriuatyues / as meus tuus suus etc.

Of pronowne primatiues Ego and tu ben only demonstratyues. Sui only relatyf.
The resydue sometime demonstratyf / as when they show a thing not spoken of
before. Sometime relatyues as when they reports a thing (...) of before. All
deriuatyues be demonstratyues. Except Suus that is sometime demonstratyf and
sometime relatyf.

the sign and the verb / aslo ue I / do I love / loved I / did I love / have

He is also called the promysse mode with diverse other names.

Also in this mode the nominatyf case comes after the verb / as in the
asking mode / the pretertens lac keth in this mode. But we use the preterper /
and plu / of the subiunctyf mode for them as it shall be showed in the third
part in circu^locutione.

taught The p^terplu. betokens a thing that was perfytly past / of long time
agone / and he has always expressed or understood this english sign had as
I had loved. I had taught.

The future betokens a thing that is to come and evermore has expressed
understand one of these english signs / will or shall. as I will love / or
shall love. I will teache / or I shall teache.

Here is to be noted that if the verb may receive in his english this sign.
have after to / as misereor misereris. to have mercy or pity. Abu^do das. I ha
ue enough.

Than must I altre some of my signs / and some must I double in this wise.

In the present have. In the preterin. had. In the p^terper. have had. In the
p^terplu. had had. In yt future. will have or shall have.

Diffinicyon of modes.
The showing mode sygnifyeth a thing as told as I love. I do love / and
requires a nomi^atyf or a vo catyf case before him / as ego lego. Uirgili lege.

The asking mode signifies a thing as questyo^ as love I. do I love / and
comenly requires his noi^a tyf or vocatyf after him. Else betwixt his sign
and him both in common spcche / and also in latin / as do thou here him?
Audiuisti tu illum?

The bidding mode signifies a thing as bidding or co^maundy^ge. And
requires his nomi^atyf case or vocatyf / like the asking mode / as speak
virgyll. Loquere virgili. Here you. Audite vos.

The wysshynge mode or (...) signifies a thyn ge as desired / and has expressed
or understand both in latin and in english. vt prius in prima part.

The potencyall mode betokens a thing as not done / but that may or might
have be done and hathas great strength as one of these verbes Possum. volo.
debeo. And the Infinityf mode of the verb that he comes of / and his signs
in english be these / may might / would / should / ought / must. and other
like / as ra perem I would pulle. obtundere^ I would knock

This mode also is used comenly either with a nega tyf / or with an other
condicyonall clause / as. Si hoc non possum. flumina amen. Non expectet

Si esset in his fides. non laboraremus

Some time he is used without negacyon or condicy on expressed / as videas (...)
dixerit aliquis.

Also this mode may be used in questyon / as quid igi tur faciam? Non eam. Quid
agas just etc. with such condicyons as were showed before.

The subiu^ctyf mode betokens a thing / as joined incertayne person and
certain nombre to an other verb / as Iubeo ne facias.

His signs in english be these / if / but / and when after that / and many
other more.

And also these latyns may have after them the subiunctyf mode. Uersus

Si. quamuis. quamquam. tametsi. licet. atque priusquam
Antequam. an. donec. ve postquam. sieve quousque
Quu^. nisi. quin. acsi. quandoque iungis vbi.
The infinityf mode betokens a thing / as done or to be done / without other
nombre or person / and sometime has expressed these signs to / or to be / as to
love / or to be loved.

Diffinicyon of a Particyple
A Particyple is a part of speech declyned with case ye which takes part of a
nowne / part of a verb / and part of both.

He takes of a nowne gendre and case / of a verb time and significacyon / of
both nombre and figure.

A particyple was ordained to make yt reason shor ter and more or not avoiding
ye concurse of relatyues / aduerbes / and conjunctions / with the which / were
not he / the reason should be foul accombred.

There be. v. tenses in a particyple / as be in a verb One of the presentens
and preterinper. in one voice An other of yt p^terper. and plu. in one voice.
And two particyples of ye future in two voices. One of yt first future in rus /
and an other of ye later future in dus

The particyple of the presentens and preterinper. is known both by his
english and by his latin / for his english ends in ynge or in and / as
louy^ge louand And his latin ends in ens or in ans / as legens. amans. and he
is formed vt prius.

The particyple of yt p^terper. and plu. is known etc. For his english
begins with I or a. and ends in d t or in n. as I loved. I taught. I seen a
goon / and his latin ends in rus. sus. or xus. and is formed vt prius.

The particyple of the first future is known etc. for his english begins
with to / without be / as to love. to teache / and his latin ends in rus / as
amatu rus. lecturus. and he is formed vt prius.

The particyple of the later future is known etc. for his english begy^neth
with to and be together / as to be loved. to be taught / and his latin ends in
dus / as

Tercia pars principalis
The three concordes in Gra^mer.
Tercia be but three concordes in grammar. The first betwixt the nominaty for
the vocatyf and the verb. These conde betwixt the adiectyf and the substantyf.
The third betwixt the relatyf and the antecede^t. It has been said there be.
ii. more / but learned men reduce them to yt se conde / as rosa est pulcherrimus
florum. Where is under stand this substa^tyf flos. Alter istorum currit. Where
understand vir. puer. or some like.

The first concord.
The verb personal and his noi^aty for vocatyf case must agree in. ii.
accide^tes / nombre and person as ego amo. O virgili. ama.

Here is to be noted ye if I shall make an englyssh in latin. I must reherce it
till I have it perfytly and see how many verbes be in the same reason / and if
the re be but one / he is the princypall verb / than must I put before him
this questyon who or what / and that word thatanswereth to the questyon shall
be yt nominatyf or the vocatyf to the verb / as the master techeth this word
techeth is the verb who or what techeth the master / this word master here
answe reth to this questyon / and therefore it shall be noi^atyf case / as
magister docet and like wise of the vocatyf / as Uirgyll love / Uirgiliama.

Yfony thing come after the verb I must put befeor the verb this questyon /
whom or what / and that word that answers to this questyo^ whom or what
shall be the accusatyf case most comenly as ye master techeth me / whom or
what does he techeth me / this word me. answers to this questyo^ whom or
what / and therefore it shall be the accusatyf case to ye verb / as Magister
docet me. Uirgyll love god. Uirgili ama deum.

But and if the word that follows the verb / may conveniently answer to
this questyon of whom or of what / it shall be put in ye ablatyf case with one
of the se p^posicyons A. ab. abs. De. E. Ex. as I am beat of the master.
Uapulo a preceptore.

Two noi^atyf cases synguler with a coniunctyon copulatyf etc. will have a
verb plurell always / except the reason be fyguratyf. vt planius post patebit.
as Io hannes et Robertus currunt.

One nominatyf case synguler with an ablatyf case having this preposicyon cu^.
betwixt them / if they be coupled to some sentence / be of the same strength
as Petrus cu^ Paulo coronabuntur in celis. Oratores cum poeta loquuntur.

A nowne of multitude in the nominatyf case synguler is of the same strength /
as Turba strauerunt vestimenta suam via.

When I have. u. nomi^atyf cases / one of the first person and an other of the
second else of ye third the verb shall always accord with the nomi^atyf case
of the first person / as Ego and tusumus. Uir and ego stamus Also if I have an
nomi^atyf case of the second person / and an other of the third / the verb
shall accord with the noi^atyf case of the second / and of the third as tu
and frater tuus estis discipuli.

The second concord.
The adiectyf and the substantyf must agree in three acci dentes / gendre /
nombre / and case / as vir doctus legit

Here is to be noted that. ii. substantyues synguler with a conjunction
copulatyf coming between / or else having this preposicyon cu^. will have an
adiectyf plurell / as Ioha^nes et robertus sedent scribentes Petrus cu^ paulo
sunt corona^di in celo.

And when I have two substantyues coming togy der one of the masculyne gendre
and an other of the feminyne or of the neutre Joined with an adiectyf tha^ shall
the adiectyf agree with the substa^tyf of the mas culyne in gendre and like
wise it is betwixt the feminyne and the neutre / as Ego and soror mea sumus
albi. soror tua and iumentu^ estis pulchre. For like as the first person is
more worthy than the second or yt third so is the masculyne more worthy than
the femmyne or the neutre.

Also when so ever I have a nowne or a pronowne ad iectyf I must put to this
questyon who / whom / or what / after him. and than always the word yt
answers shall be the substantyf / as much bread / much what / bread / my
gown / my what / gown.

If the adiectyf be a particyple / this questyo^ must go before / as growy^ge
trees / who or what growe^ trees

Here is generally to be noted yt al words that stan de as one person / must
ever be put in one case / and all that be in one case stand as one person.
Therefore it is comenly said / that all yt longs to one thing shall be put
in one case / as my fader a man loves me a child. Pater meus vir diligit me
puerum.

The third concord.
The third is betwixt the relatyf of substance and his antecedente / ye
which must ever agree in. iii. acci de^tes. Gendre / nombre / and person /
how be it he may dyscorde with the verb some time in person / as equus que^
video currit.

Here is to be understand yt there be. ii. manner of re latyues / one of
substance / and one of accidence. The relatyf of substance requires a
substantyf for his antecedentes / as Qui. Ille. Ipse. Sui. Is and Idem. The
relatyf of accide^ce reherseth an adiectyf for his antecedente / as Talis.
qualis. tantus. quantus.

Also when I have a relatyf of substance I shall put after him this questyon /
who / whom / or what and that word that answers to this questyon shall be ye
an tecedente to the relatyf / as Uirgyll is deed, ye which was a poet. The
which what virgyll. This word Uirgyll answers to the questyon / and
therefore it is his antecedente.

This relatyf Quis is known by these signs that whom / or the which.

When there comes a noi^atyf case betwixt the relatyf and his next verb /
than shall the relatyf be such case as the verb will have after him / as Ego
quent preceptor docet aduerto.

And when no noi^atyf case etc. The relatyf shall be yt noi^atyf case to ye
verb / as Ego qui sedeo scribo

It is to be noted also / that the relatyf may agree with his antecedent in.
iiii. Gendre / case / nombre / and person as Homo mouetur. Ide^ homo currit.

When this word ye comes in a reason if it may put this english the which
in his place it shall be made by this relatyf qui if not so that it report any
thing before said by some pronowne relatyf / if it be token shewy^ge / by ille
illa. illud. or some other pronow nes demo^stratyf / and when it betokens a
thing as wylled to be done by vt and a thing as telling ye cau se by quod or
qia or other casual conjunctions.

Coniu^ctions copulatyues and disiu^ctyues dubitatyf and interrogatyues will
Join comynly like case / gendre / nombre / mode and tens.

Also two antecedentes synguler with an et. coniuncti on copulatyf coming
between will have a relatyf plurell / as Johannes et Petrus quos ego docui non
discunt diligenter.

When I have a relatyf comy^ge (...) two sub stantyues of diverse gendres
longing both to one thing / if the substa^tyf that follows be appellatyf
than the relatyf may accord with either of them in differently / as in gendre
/ as eo Oxoniam que vel qui est locus studendi.

But and if the substantyf ye follows be of a nowne propre / ye relatyf shall
accord with ye later always in gendre / as Est locus in carcere quoth tullianu^
appellat

When there be many verbes in a reason / evermore the first verb shall be ye
princypallverbe. Except he come soon after one of these signs. That / whom
/ or the which / or any of these. if. But. whenne. After that Before that.
Although. Sith. Except. or other like. Or else after any of these latin words
Si quamuis etc. Or else after any of these signs. To / or To be / as To love /
or To beloved.

Here is to be noted that where as many verbes be in a reason / that verb is
pryncypall that makes ye reason perfyte.

Also where as be many verbes / one verb at the lest wise comes betwixt the
foresaid signs and ye princypal verb / as the book that I begin to write if
it were ended should profit children much. Liber quem incipio scribere si
perficeretur multum prodesset pueris.

A nowne relatyf may not be set in that same reason / that his antecedente is
in. But evermore he makes a reason imperfyte in himself.

A pronowne relatyf may be set in a reason with his antecedente / as Patre^
sequitur sua proles. Sua cuique satis placebant. Dominu^ formidabunt aduersarii
eius.

Strength of compulynge case
The verb of substance / and all that be of like english will have such
case after them as they have before them / as I am a man. Ego sum vir.

The Same strength has all verbes vocatyues / as no minor Appellor. I am called
Thomas. Ego vocor. Thomas. Also appareo. sedeo. with other like.

And generally all verbes may couple like case when the word that gooth before
the verb / and the word that comes after the verb long both to one thing
/ as Latcus non sedet index in causis ecclesiasticis.

Note well.
A noi^atyf els^ a vocatyf may not stand without a verb finite set out /
or understand.

Nor like wise a verb finite without a noi^atyf or vo catyf case.

A verb is called finite in all modes / except ye Infinityf. Also every
Infinityf mode may have an accusatyf case set before him expressyd or
understand as for such manner of speech. Cui nu^c cognomen Iu lo. Is more
after use than craft.

Nor an aduerbe may not stand without a verb.

Nor a conjunction without. ii. clauses / and. ii. verbes set out / as Ego
lego. and tu legis. or understood / as Le go Uirgilium et Ciceronem. for Lego
Uirgilium et. lego Ciceronem.

Nor. ii. clauses or. ii. verbes without a conjunction except that one be an
Infinityf mode or else Joined with a relatyf.

Nor a preposicyon without a case. Nor an adiectyf without a substantyf. Nor
a relatyf without some word rehearsed of the reason before / the which may be
called the anteccdente.

Nor a relatyf without a verb diverse from the verb of the antecede^t / if the
relatyf be a nowne.

When words must be construed together betoke nynge things that be of one
person / they must agree in as many accide^tes as they may.

A person is called in gramer the beer / the doer / the suffrer / the hauer /
the thing that is had / that / that grows to / as auau^tage / or hurt /
anger / or pleasure. Also price / time / Instrument / and other like

Accidents I call case / gendre / no^bre / person / mode / and tense etc:

This Infinityf mode esse when he comes after any of these verbes Uolo. soleo.
cupio. i^cipio. disco. or any other like stondynge personally will have after
hy^ a noi^atyf case / after esse use of greeks what soever be understand before
/ as volo esse rex. Soleo esse amicus cupio esse doctus. disco esse pater.

But and if the verb that comes before esse. be impersonall / the word that
follows shall some time be ye datyf case / as Licet michi esse bono. Placet
tibi esse regi.

The which speaking though it be approved by the use of Greeks and latynes /
yet it is not after the craft Nownes of the comparatyf degree will have after
them an ablatyf case / wha^ this sign than. follows them. as I am wyser than
these. Sum doctior his. And a genityf when this sign of follows them as this
is the wyser of you tweyne. Hic est doctior vestrum duorum.

The superlatyf will have a genityf plurell of allwor des / except the nowne of
multitude / of whom he is content with a genityf case synguler / as Uirgilius
erat doctissimus poetarum. Troiane gentis fortissimus erat. Hector.

Every verb is construed with case after his (...). Therefore if it be not
englysshed after his construccyon / it is not englysshed after his
significacyon / wherefore these verbes Noceo and placeo / and such other the
which have after them a datyf case must have these englysshes. I do grieve I
do pleasure / and contrary wise. Ledo and offendo. I hurt or offen de rather
than I do hurt / or offense / and like wise in one verb / as Uaco tibi. I
take heed to the. Uaco doctrina I lack conning. But where it is hard to en
glysshe them after their construccyon / we must go as nyghe as we may / and
for their construccyon / to be known say generally yt all verbes actyues.
depo nentes. and co^munes / may have after them an accusatyf case / or some
what set in the stead of it / as. Amo. Loquor. Ueneror oratione^. Amo legere.
cupio vt legas. and so they have the nature of actyues.

All verbes may have after them a datyf case to yt thing the wiche is gyuynge
/ sendynge / vauntage / or damage / or such other like of the same strength /
be all verbes that betoken preferrynge or co^paryson as Homo prestat homini.

Every verb adiectyf that has no passyf sign with his english / may have
after him an accusatyf case of a word that is of the same significacyon / or
else that mesureth his significacyon / and so is as an actyf as Curro cursum. or
stadiu^. or multum. viuo vitam infelicem.

Every verb may have after hy^ an ablatyf case that stands as price /
clothing / or armure

And generally of all verbes that be as instrumente as emi equu^ centum uummis.
Induo tetunica. percussus pugione.

Out of this rule be except adiectyues of vncertyn price / the which shall
ever be put in the genityf case synguler / and neutre gendre substa^tyuate if
they be without substantyues / as magni interest / parui constat.

But and if the substantyf be expressed / they shall both be put in the ablatyf /
as Penus emitur magno precio vel multa pecunia.

To these be reduced verbes betokenynge lacking / as Careo. vaco.

Also such verbes Exulo. spolio. nudo. priuo.

Also verbes betokenynge mouynge will have after them the first supyne / or
else the gerundyf in dum. with this p^posicyon ad as eo cubitu^ vel ad cubandum
And where this general rule will not satysfye we must say specially that some
verbes will have after them a genityf case / as Insimulo. accuso. memini. re
cordor. potior. and misereor. Some with the ablatyf case / as Dignor indignor.
Some passyues with the ac cusatyf / as grauor. doceor. postulor To these be
redu ced two particyples Exosus. and pertesus. as exosus co^ tubernium.
pertesus ignauia^.

The ablatyf case absolute.
When so ever I have in a reason a nowne or a pro nowne substantyf with nowne.
pronowne. or particyple adiectyf coming together without any verb. or other
word of whom they may be governed / they shall be put in yt ablatyf case /
which is called the ablatyf case inconsequent. if there come a noi^atyf case
with his verb hanging other before or after / as caesar teynynge virgyll was
borne. Cesare regna^te Uir gilius natus est vel natus erat.

This case is called absolute or inconseque^te because that he is loused from
the power of all governance and stands in a reason / as the master techy^ge
/ the scolers must take heed. Docente preceptore. discipu los oportet
animaduertere. In being deed you shalt lack help. Mortuo me. indigebis (...).

The ablatyf inconseque^t may be expowned or decla red by these aduerbes. Dum.
quu^. or quando. and such tenses of the verbes / as the partycyples be / when
I have a partycyple in the said ablatyf case as Docen te preceptore disco vel
disccba^. i. Dum. quu^. or qua^do preceptor docet. vel docebat.

More over when soever I have in a reason any su che sign / whiles as long as
/ after yt / if / although notwithstondynge / or nevertheless. Than I may tor
ne the next verb in to a partycyple / and set him in ab latyf case
inconsequent in conformyte of case / gendre and nombre / to the word that
seems to be the nominatyf case to the said verb / as whiles I live / you can
lack no thing. Dum ego viuo. vel me viue^te potest (...) nichil (...).
Preestys after their matens be said hye them self to mass. Sacerdotes dictis
prius matutinis parant sese ad missam. First serve thy maker / when thou have
do so / go about other thy^ ges. Primum serui creatori quo facto: alias res
(...) age.

Dyfference of Gerundiues and Particyples
What dyfference is between Gerundiues and participles. Gerundiues betoken
necessyte and deed with out time. And participles betoken time without ne
cessyte or deed.

Examples of Geru^diues. Tenet me occupatio iuris dicendi. Tenet me cura dotis
numerande.

Examples of Participles. Cras lege^dos esse ais Nasonem et Uirgilium. anglice.
To morrow thou say that Uirgyll and Ouide shall be read.

How many Gerundiues be most in use / three / whi the three. Di. do. du^. How
shall they be occupied / thus as it follows.

De gerundiuo in Di.
What soever the english of the Infinityf mode comes after any of these
nownes. Tempus causa. locus. libertas. ius. volu^tas. ars licentia. modus.
ocium / and any other nownes that betokens accident / which nowne has his
gouernynge of some other word. I may put the genytyf in di in the stead of ye
Infinityf mode / as it is time to pray / te^pus est ora^ di. I have cause to

And when soever I must speak by a relatyfe. I shall occupye the geru^dyf in

little que vellem.

Also a gerundyf in di may govern after him a genityf case plurell. Plautus in
cap^. scdo.

Noi^andi tibi istorum erit magis quam ede^dicopia.

Participles and many adjectives that come of verbes be enjoined as well to the
gerundyf in di as to the in finityf mode / as Timens nauigare and nauigandi. do
ctus cantare and cantandi. cupiens. peritus. promptus consuetus and similia.
Timidus. cupidus. auidus habe re and habendi. et similia.

De gerundiuo in do.
When the english of the inifinityf mode comes after a verb that betokens
prayenge or besechy^ge it shall be put in a gerundyf in Do. with this p^posicyon
de. before him. Or else I may take the co^iunctyf mode / as Oro te de scribe^do
michi latinitate^. Et oro scri bas vel vt scribas michi latinitate^.

Also when the english of a particyple of the presen tens with this english
sign of / before him comes after a nowne adiectyf it may be put in a gerundyf
in do. with this preposicyon in. or de. vel sine prepositione si placet / as I
am weary of sitting. Fessus su^ sedendo vel de sedendo

Also when I have the english of a particyple of the presentens with this
preposicyon. In. before him joined with no substa^tyf / the said english may
be put in a geru^dyue in do. with this preposicyon In or without si placet. as
scolers in taking head grow to conning. Scolastici aduertendo vel in
aduerten do euadunt docti.

Also may have a gerundyf in do. after any of these vi. preposicyons A. ab.
abs. De. E Ex. as in these examples and in all other like Plinius posterior.
Sermo nibus dies tra^siebat quu^ a scribendo vacaret. Cicero Ex quo ardescit
sieve amore sieve amicicia. vtrunque em^ dictu^ est ab amando. Ite^ ab edendo
factus est satur Ite^ tu quid cogites detranseundo in epyrum scire sane velini.
Ediscendo (...) co^modi capio. Ex defende^do quam accusando (...) gloria
comparatur.

Also I may have a gerundyf in do. without a preposicyon when I have these
english words / when whiles / or aslonge Joined with a passyf significacyon
/ as aslonge as my^de is occupied / it is encressed as all other things.
Memoria excolendo sicut alia oia augentur. Excole^do. i. du^ colitur. Urit
femina. videndo. i. quu^ videtur.

De gerundiuo in Dum.
When the english of the infinityf mode comes after a reason and tells the
cause of the reason it may be put in the geru^dyfin du^. with this preposicyon
ad before him / as I am come to learn gra^mer Uenio ad discendum grammatica^.

Also I may have a geru^dyf in du^ with these preposi cyons In. ob propter. or
ante. as in the examples and all other like / as Uado in capiendu^ hostem vel
ad si pla cet. Ego venio ob te. vel propter te redime^du^. Uirgilius Na^que
ante domandu^ ingentes tollent animos

Also I may have a geru^dyfin du^. with this preposicyon Inter / when soever I
have one of these englys she words / when / whiles / or aslonge / put before a
coniunctyf mode / as whiles thou playest / thou forge test much thing Inter
ludendum multa de discis Uirgilius. Age tytire and inter agendu^ occursare
caprocornu ferit ille caueto.

When the english of ye infinityf mode follows this english it is / it may
be put in a geru^dyf in du^. with this verb est. set impersonally / and that
that seems to be the noi^atyf shall be the datyf / as the king it is to fight.
Regi pugnandu^ est.

Also wha^ I have this english must / where as it set meth to be made by this
verb Oportet. it may be ma de like wise / as I must needs cost goo to town.

Michi eundu^ est oppidu^.

After all such verbes that betoken callyge she wy^ge / mouynge / or rest. I
shall evermore have a gerundyf in du^. and never the Infinityf mode / as Uocaui
te ad currendu^ no^ currere. Surgo ad audiendu^ no^ audire. Sto ad predandu^
no^ predari.

But these verbes following the Inifinityf / and not yt geru^dyf / as Iubeo te
amare non ad arandu^ cogito timeo edificare no^ ad edificanu^ Some be
indifferent to both / as hortor te studere and ad studendu^. Flagitor paratus
sum aptus. idoneus militare and ad milita^du^ But such for the most part
will have the geru^dyf and leave the Infinityf mode.

The getu^dyf is known fro the particyple in dus by that that it betokens
the doing of a thing without any respect of the time / as Sum occupatus in
docendo pueros. or in docendis pueris.

The particyple in dus betokens a thing to be do ne in time to come / as
Chremes est exora^dus a me. By twene In docendo pueros and In doce^dis pueris
is this difference yt in docendo pueros. is of the actyf significacyon and may
be expowned either by yt nowne verbale in to. or by the present subiunctyf and
/ vt Occupatus sum in docendo pueros or in doctio^e pu erorum. or vt docea^
pueros. In doce^dis pueris is of the passyf and passyfly expowned / as
Occupatus sum in doce^dis pueris. for vt doceantur.

And generally all gerundyues be actyfly expowned except they stand
absolutely / as Utrique videndo id est dum videatur illustria ad cognoscendu^
hoc est vt cognoscantur.

The gerundyfin do has these preposico^ns In or De. as In or De transeu^do in
epyrum. with E. and Ex A or Ab. as Ex discedendo. Ab audiendo. with cum. as Cum
loquendo.

De supinis
When yt english of ye Infinityf mode comes after a verb or a particyple
betokenynge mouynge or go ynge to a place it shall be put i^ ye first supyne /
as I go to hunting. Ego vado venatu^. Also I may have yt first supyue after
all such verbes yt betoke^ pryue mo uynge / as Do. co^cedo admitto. recipto
and many other like / as Do filia^ nuptu^. Co^cedo. edes venu^. Admitto te
spectatum. Conceduntur edes venu^ admittuntur spectatum. Also I may have the
latter supyne after all nownes of yt neutre gendre yt be of the comparatyf and
superlatyf degree / as quo quoth magis abhoi^abile eo turpius dictu. Et (...) magis
est aliqd studiosu^ ta^to dignius honoratu. Optimu^ factu quoth scit nescio. Dig
(...) intellectu est illud opus.

Also I may have ye latter supyne after all these now nes adiectyues in all
gendres and nombres. (...) Dignus turpis. rarus. iocundus. absurdus. seuerus.
seuus. obseuus. superbus. austerus. clarus. dutus and all other like
significacyon as Naso dignus lectu. Pes digna vi su. Pecus dignum amatu.

Also it is to be noted that supynes may in no wise be Joined with adiectyues
in conformyte of case gendre and nombre. Nor they may not be governed of no
preposico^n. Also they have no case / but always be verbes. Also they be not
governed of verbes / nor of particyples / but of adiectyues / vt miserabilis
visu id est vt videatur. Also they be of affinyte with the In finityf mode.

De Infinitiuo modo.
when two verbes come together without a relatyf or a coniu^ction comy^ge
between them / ye latterverbe shall be the infinityf mode / as Uolo legere.
cupio doceri. And one infinityf mode may cause an other verb to be the
Infinityf mode / as dico me no^ posse venire. There^tius ait se videre te cupere

Such adiectyues Dignus. indignus. iocu^dus. letus tristis. be enjoined better
to the infinitys mode than to the gerundyf / vt tu es dignus habere opes tu es
di gnus honorari. tu es letus me been valere. tues letus me honorari.

Moreover where soever I take the Inifinityf mode of the presentens / and
p^terperfytens of the (...) significacyon / there may take the latter supyne of
the same verb / as tues dignus honorari vel honoratu. sed no^ versa vice.

Also when soever I take the first supyne / there I may take the neutre gendre
substantyuate with this more made with one of these two words Esse or fuisse
and yt particyple in tus with co^formyte of case gendre and nombre betwixt the
particyple and the casuell word that gooth before the infinityf mode / as Uir
(...) amatus fuisse. Uirgo amata fuisse. Caput amatu^ fuisse. Uiri amati
fuisse. Uirgines amate fuisse. Capita amata fuisse. Et similiter de esse.

De circu^locutione futuri temporis actiui significationis modi Infinitiui
The circu^locuco^n of the future tens of yt actyf voice of the foresaid mode is
made with this Infinityf mo de Ire. and the particyple in tus or in sus. or with
this In finityf mode esse / and the particyple in rus. with confor myte of case
gendre and nombre betwixt the particyple and the casual word. Also the said
future tens beto keneth time / mouynge / and bodily deed / as Uolo te amatu^
ire vel amaturum esse. Amatam ire vel amaturam esse me. etc.

De circumlo cutione futuri temporis passi ue significationis antedicti modi
The circu^locucyon of the future tens of the possyf significacyon is evermore
made with this Infinityf mode iri. and the particyple in tus or in sus. or else
with this infinityf mode esse. and the particyple in dus with conformyte of
case gendre and nombre betwixt the par ticyple and the casual word / as
Intelligo. scto credo. video. opinor. existimo. peccatu^ meu^ patefaciendum
esse vel patefactu^ iri. Negligentia^ mea^ patefacienda^ esse vel patefactu^
iri. etc.

Save it is to be noted that the particyple in tus or in sus / with all
circunlocucyons of the future tens of the actyf sygnifycacyon / betokens time
present at hand / us Uideo te accusatum ire me. id est nunc. an glice I se the
now thou do accuse me.

Also the particyple in Rus with all circunlocucyons of the future tens of the
actyf significacyon betokens vacertayne time withoutende / as nunc video te
accusaturu^ esse me. anglice now I se you will ones accuse me. i. post hac
tempore incerto.

But all circu^locucyons of the future of the passyf sig nificacyon betokens
both time and deed present and to come indyfferently / as video me accusatu^
iri abs te. i. video te vel accusatu^ ire me vel accusaturum esse me etc.
anglice I se I am accused of the now or else I se I shall be accused of the
here after

Exulo. Uapulo. Ueneo. (...)
When soever I am compelled to make a latin by one of these four verbes.
Exulo. Uapulo. Ueneo / and Liceo. that thing that does the deed shall be the

king has banysshed many a traitor. A rege multi traditores exulauerunt. The
master beteth scolers. A preceptore vapulant discipuli. The fysshers selle
their (...) dear. A piscariis pisces care (...). Thou do apprayse thy
servant A te tuus seruus licet.

Nubo
This verb Nubo bis. has evermore the nominatyf case of the woman / and a
datyf of the man in all comoy^ speches / as my brother has wedded thy sister
Fratri meo nupsit soror tua. I shall wedde thy mother. Michi nubet matter tua.

De hoc vulgari signo At.
When soever there comes a propre name of a pla ce or to wne after this
english sign at it shall be put in the genityf case / so that it be in the
synguler nombre and the first declenson or the second / as I ler ne grammar at
Oxford Disco gra^matica^. Oxonie. I dwelled a while at york. Ego manebam

But and if the foresaid propre name be ye third declen son or the plurell
nombre it shall be put in the ablatyf casc without a preposicyon / as Thou
wast borne at Chartage. Tu eras Chartagine natus Thou (...) study at Achencs.
Studuisti Athenis.

Moreover I may take an accusatyf case or else an ab lacyf of yt forlayd nownes
with a preposicyon of a conuenyent significacyon / as maneo apud Chartagine^. and
so of all other like / as sum apud Londonias

De hoc vulgari signo To.

compowned / for than I must evermore an accusatyf case or an ablatyf with a
preposicyon of a convenient significacyon. as Eo ad san ctum Iacobu^. Fui apud

These. iiii. nownes rus. domus. humus. and militia. folo weth the ruler of the
said propre names of places / as maneo ruti venio rure. vado rus. su^ (...). eo

Out of this rule be except the. v. pronownes primatyues. Ego. tu. sui. Nos
and vos / and this nowne inter rogatyf. Quis. instead of whom I shall take
the ab latyf case feminyne gendre and synguler nombre of their possessyues.
That is to say. Mea. tua. sua. nostra. vestra. and cuia / as Mea interest
discere. iua interreat docere. Sua interfuit audire. Nostra interfuerat canere.
Uestra intererit monuisse. who is bound to tell the troth / but he that
knows all the matter. Cuia interest enarrare veritatem nisi suo qui nouit om
nem rem.

Also when I have any such english. It is my office / my duty / or my part.
It longs for. It beho ued. It is good reason or according / or any such o
there ye encludeth duty. I may conveniently occupye one of these. v. verbes.
Decet. Oportet. Interest. Re fert. or est. with the foresaid governance of
case.

All these verbes in these verses folowy^ge may have a datyf case of the
person yt the deed longs to / as Michi licet ludere. Thou carest not whether
I ly ue or deye. Tibi no^ vacat: moriar ne an viua^.

Uersus

Heclibet atque licet liquet et patet accidit atque
Congruit euenit attinet expedit and licet add
Pertinet incu^bit vacat and sedet addito constat
Conuenit et prestat contingit iunge satisfit
Sufficit ad ternos cu^ competit aduoco casus.
All verbes impersonalles of ye passyf voice govern before them an ablatyf
with a p^posicyon / else a datyf of ye person that does the deed / as a me vel
mihi ama tur. and after them an accusatyf or an ablatyf with a (...) posicyon /
but never without / as a me itur in antiqua^ silua^. a me auditur a me statur
in foro

Save otherwyle they may have after them such ca ses as has the verbes yt
they be dyryued of / as a me seruit^ tibi interdictu^ est tibi aqua and igni.

Evermore before the Infinityf mode of a verb im personal of the passyf voice
I must express the ablatyf case with a preposico^n of the (...) / as volo a me
(...). idest bolo amare. volo a me (...). idest. volo seruire.

Benefit. malefit satisfit
These verbes Benefit malefit. and satisfit will have before them an ablatyf
with a preposicyon of ye doer (...) after them a datyf case of the sufferer as
a me be nefit tibi.

When soever there comes any of these. vi. signs am art is / was / were / or
be / before a verb neutre (...) bodily (...). I may evermore take ye
preterperfytens of the Indicatyf mode or some other that is formed of him as
the vulgar does require. And than ye p^terperfytens of ye indicatyf mode
stands beside his own strength / both for yt presentens and the
p^terimperfytens. And so he and al tenses formed out of (...) have the passyf
significacyon / as my master is come. Preceptor meus venit. My fellows be gone
/ Mei condiscipuli abierunt

How many particyples come of a verb impersonal of the passyf voice? one /
which one / a particyple of the preterte^s and the neutre gendre only / as
Nto^ hoc oppositum. ablatiuo ab hoc opposito. and he has after him a datyf
case / as michi prius opposito tibi opponetur.

Incipit. desinit. debet. potest. solet. vult
These. vi. verbes Incipit. desinit debet. potest. solet. and vult. Joins to
the Infinityf mode of verbes. Impersonalles and will have before them such
cases as will the verbes impersonalles / as me incipit tedere vigilie. michi
desinit placere studere. me debet puders maleficii bonos solet penitere
flagitii me vult delectare dormire. Else they be always verbes personalles / and
have before them a nominatyf case / as (...) legere. etc.

Pono fero
These. ii. verbes actyues Pono and Fero compowned with pre or ante be thus
englysshed / to tell more (...) / to set more by / to love better / to have
lever / (...) have after them an accusatyf of the thing that we make most of
and a datyf of the thing that we make lest of / as Prepono virtutem vitus. Iam
(...) prepones catoni Prefero panem potui. Nescio vtru^ (...) anteferam.

And of this regiment be all these verbes with many other such / as valeo es.
prepondero as. presto as. an glice vr prius. as Ingenio vales.

Item otherwhyle with an ablatyf with a preposico^n vt Tullius ad modu^ valuit
in genere dicendi. Ternarius numerus preponderat binario.

Postpono
But postpono is of (...) construceyon to Antepono. as postpono auditum visui.

Cello. Eo. Cedo.
These. iii. verbes cello eo and cedo. compowned with ante pre. or extra. anglice
to pass / excede / excelle / or to be better / govern before them a nominatyf
case of the thing that we make most of / and after them an accusatyf of the
thing vt supra. as I pass far all my brethren both in writing and
redynge. Ego ante cello om^es fratres meos in scribendo and legendo. Also
ablatyf case with this p^posicyon In. vel sine si placet of the thing that we
compare in / as Thou excedest me in might as much as I pass yt in coming. Tu
antecedis me fortitudine vel in fortitudine ta^to (...) te scientia. (...)
antecellit alios poetas carmine vel in carmine.

The same strength has Supero and all other as verbes that has the foresaid
english.

When no word lacks in a reason to the most perfyte sentence than it is
called full / as ego lego virgiliu^ And when any thing that is required to
perfyte se^ tence lacks if it be used to be understand by the co mon
customs of Romans the reason may be called fygurate / as lego litteras where
must needs be vnderstonden ego and that sign is called Eclypsis.

There be customably understood in latin tongue the se / the relatyf with every
word that be rehearsed of the reason before in the same case / gendre / nombre
and person / as the relatyf is / as Lego Uirgiliu^ qui est poeta where is
understand with qui virgilius / or else moregenerally / as Stude na^ ea res
proderit.

Ofte^tyme the word that the relatyf reherseth is expressed with the relatyf /
and understand before as Urbe^ pua^ statuo vestra est. where is understand
before est this word Urbs.

Also in answers commonly the verb that is in the as king / as to this
asky^ge. Qui est. (...) I say Ego. is understand sum.

Also ego. tu. meus. tuus. suus as Uerbero filiu^. where is understand Ego.
and after filiu^ meu^. tuu^ or suum as the matter requires

Sum es est. as Bonu^ dicere. Doctior quam ille where is understand est

Also Ens where soever. ii. or mo propres or appellatyues or one propre an
other appellatyf come to gydre in one case and one clause without any verb or
coniun ctyon between / as Urbe^ romam. for Urbem entem romam.

Also nownes after superlatyues when they cord in gendre with the genityf
after them / as pulcherrimus florum. where is understand flos

And after partatiues / as alter duorum (...). where is understand homo but
else they have the construc cyon of adiectyues

Also coniu^ctions of all kinds most commonly in peers else not but the
speaking be changed in to inter rogacyon or dissimulaco^n / as Surge para abs.
where is to understand twyes et. and specially vt before subiunctyues, as Fac
mittas. for fac vt. mittas

Also p^posicyon with names of towns / as Uado roman where is understand ad.
Ueni rhoma. where is understand a. Also fui thebis. where is understand in
The which speaking though it be fygurate is more used than ye full. The same
figure also is when we say. Fui rome or tarenti. But there is understand
beside yt p^posicyon In locus vrbs or oppidu^.

And like as in these ye fygurate is more used than ye full / so it is in
Statur Currit^. where is vnderstoude Statio and cursus. And in all such / as
Pluit. tonat. fulminat. is understand Deus. and in these five verbes Miseret.
tedet. penitet. piget. and Pudet. as often as they have not an Infinityf with them
is understand one of their own nownes. miseratio. penitentia. pudor to the
which nownes always perteyneth the genityf ye follows these words / as
Penitet me tui. for penitentia tui penitet or efficit me. the accusatyf is
Joined to ye verb as an actyf.

Sometime. ii. or more like clauses be closed togy der with one word synguler /
the which is understand in every clause / and set out in one / as Cicero
Uirgi lius Homerus scripsit. and of this speaking the figure is called zeugina.

But of diverse clauses none like other in gendre / nombre or person be closed
with one word / than is the figure Sylepsis / and the word yt closes is
wont to agree with the last / as Uir and mulier magna ad me (...). Hic (...)
arma hic currus fuit.

But if the word that closes be plurell than it must agree in gendre and
person with the chyef / as Ego and vxor amati sumus. iu the which is sylepsis
in person and gendre / but not in nombre.

To this figure may be reduced such construccyons Urbem quam statuo. and
fabulas quas fecisset etc.

When. ii. or more things be generally compared in one word and afterward
specially set out / as Aquile volauerunt vna ab orient alia ab occidente.
than is the figure Prolepsis etc.
