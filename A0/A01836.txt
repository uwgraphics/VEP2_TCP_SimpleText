1632.

TO THE NO LESS Honored then Deserving, Sir WALTER TICHBORNE Knight.
SIR,

THis with another Tragedy entitled, ^ heraging Turk, the issue of one man's
brain; are now come forth together from the Press, nearer allied, even as
Twins in this their second birth* They are full of Glory, Strength, and indeed
full of what not; that beautifies? The more apt to b^ soyled, opposed, and
disgra* ced; the rather, because the Author has made Exit hence. The intent,
and use of Dedication as I have observed, is to no other end then that
ignorance and spite, (sworn Enemies to ingenuity) should know upon their dull
or envious dislikes, whether to repair and receive reformation. The
^atherlesse fel^ow-Orphan to this work r^steth safe under the protection of
your most noble Brother, my much honored Friend, Sir Richard Tichborne Knight
and Baronet; Now for these reasons, and that I might not make them strangers by
remote fosterings, but especially standing to you (most worthy Sir) equally
engaged, I this to you Present and Dedicate: Together tendering the Love and
unfeigned acknowledgements, of

Your most embounden Servant

RICHARD MEIGHEN.

TO THE AVTHOR IN THAT Transcribing his Book, without his knowledge I was bound
by promise to stand to his pleasure to keep it orburne it.
I Will not praise this Work, 'twere labor lost,
Rich Pearls best praise themselves, nor will I boast
To be possessed of more than Indians wealth,
That were the way to loose't since I my self
D^strust my self in keeping it, and stand
In fear of robbing by some envious hand:
Robbed of it said I? Alas that fate were just,
Since I am found first thief to you, who durst
Unbidden thus, Ransacke your precious store;
This magazine of wit, so choice; nay more,
Steal from the chariot of the glorious Sun,
This heavenly fire, what shall I say it is done;
I do confess the indictment, pity then
Must be my surest Advocate amongst men.
None can abate the rigor of the Law,
But the Lawgiver; but methoughts I saw,
(Or hoped I saw) some watery beams of Mercy,
Break glimpsing forth of your imperious ey^*
O let me beg reprive, your pardon may
By due observance come another day.
Here low I tendered back to bid the doom,
By promise bound to him, to him with whom*
I would not break for all rich Tagus sands,
Now he the Prisoner at your mercy stands.
-- Ergo ibit in igne^
Hoc opus, aeternum ruet and tot bella, tot Enses;
In Cineres dabit her a nocens: --
The Prologue.
VV^re not our present subject mix^ with sear,
'Twould much aff^ight us to see all y^u here.
One would suffice us, or no Auditor.
Each to himself an amp^e Theater,
Let rude Pl^bejans think so, b^t we know
All judgments here from the same Spring do flow.
All here have but one c^nsure, all one breast*
All sons of the same Mother; but the rest
We pre^ccupate their Censure, and (...),
What after may be said not to be well,
As in most decent Garments you may see*
Some gracious Ornaments inweav^d be:
Which serve for little use* but on some day
Destined to please himself, the wearer may
Without a blush put on, when his best friends
Intend to visit him, so our hope intends
The sacred Muses Progeny to greet,
Which under our Roo^e, now the t^ird time meet,
We will not open the book to you, and show
A story word by word, as it does go,
But give invention leave to undertake,
Of it is own strains, some ben^fit to make:
For though a Tragic P^n may be confined,
Within a studies private Walls, the mind
Must be unbounded, and with inventions steel,
Strike fir^ from ali^nt Flints --
So free we are from set^ing any price,
On these our studied Vanities, that advice
Almost d^dain'd the whispers of those ^ngues
Which private fi^t, though vented public wrongs*
To the Patient Patient often* We'il here begin
To be alitle perempto^y, oh that sin
Of wilful indiscretion, it is no bays
To make us Garlands of our own mouths prai^e,
Which who aff^ct, may they so Laurel lack,
That slanders Thunder may behi^d their back^*
Blast them with C^lumny, for we vow they dear
Pay for their pains, that give attention here.
And since it is suffered with kind indulgence
We hope that Kingly Parent's our d^fence,
Who would not have his d^dling love be known,
But unto those had off spring of (...) own,
And for we are assured that here be
No br^ines so cursed with black sterilitie.
But of (...) nature they can freely call,
Bi^ths more mature, and Caelestiall,
Their stud^es ^ssue, they like kindest Mothers,
With tend^r hands will swath the limb^ of others.
THE ARGUMENT.
A Supposed Victory by AMVRATH
Obtained in Greece, where many captives ta^e,
One among the rest, IRENE, conquers him;
For taken with her love, he sounds retreat.
Eternally from War: but after, mov'^
With murmur of his Nobles, in her Bed
Before his Councels face, strikes off her head.
Then ruinating former bloody br^yles,
He straight ore' comes all Christian Provinces,
Invades the Confines of his Son in Law,
Fires Caramania, and makes Aladin
With His Wife and Children suppliant for their lives;
At length appointed his greatest Field to fight,
Upon Cassanae's Plains, where having got
A wondrous Conquest against the Christians,
Comes the next morn to overview the dead,
'M^ngst whom a Christian Captain Cobelitz,
Lying wounded there, at sight of Amurath,
Rising and staggering toward him, desperately
With a short dagger wounds him to the heart,
And then immediately the Christian dies.
The Turk expiring, Bajazet his Heir
Strangles his younger brother: Thus still springs
The Tr^gick sport which F^rtune makes with Kings.

Yet m^st great Amurath thank those sacred powers,
They have enricht our souls with such a price,
As ha^ those Heroes whose revengefull Arms,
S^v'd Mars a ten years Prentiship at Troy,
^re d^eam'd succeeding times should b^ possessed,
With such an unparalleled unprized beauty as my Saint:
They would not have prevented so their bliss,
But been most humble Suitors to the Gods,
To have protra^ted their then fond spent life,
But to behold this object. Which out-shines

love I Will outbrave thee! melt thy self in Lust
Embrace at once a^l starre-made Concubines,
I Will not envy thee, know I have to spare
Beauty enough, to make another Uenus;
And for fond Gods, that have no reward in store
To make me happier, here I Will place my Heaven.
And for thy sake, this shall my Motto be,
I conquered Greece, one Grecian conquered me.

E^m. But (gracious Lord) those streams (we see) soon ebb,
Which with outragio^s swelling flow to fast,
Forbid ( ^ucina) this soon kindled fire,
Should ere burn out itself it is a true Theme,
That nere last^long, that seems most extreme.

Amur. Can this rich price of nature, precious jem
Give entertainment to suspecting guests?
Come, come, these arms are curious chains of love,
With which thou link'st my heart aeternally,
Thy cheeks the royal Paper interlined,
With Natures Rhetorique, and love persuasion,
Stands there attracting still my gazing eye:
This then ^le read, and here I now will feign,
That these all Antique fables of the Gods,
Are writ in flowing numbers; first thy lip,
Was fair Euro^aes which they say made Jove,
Turn a wild Heyfer: next, this sparkling eye
Was the Aemonian Io's; then, this hand
Laedaes, fair Mother to those Stare made Twins,
Thus, thus, I Will Comment on this golden Book:
Nature nor Art, have taught how to feign:
Fairest, 'twas you first brought me to this vain:
In loving Combats now I valiant prove,
Let others war, great ^murath shall love.

Scha. Brave resolution, O the fond thoughts of man,
Awake Enuo! I Will find stratagems:
There shall be Physic, to purge this disease,
Light sores are gently used, but such a part,
Must be cut off, least it infect the heart.

Amar. Schahi^, Our Tutor, we command this nigh^
Be solemnized with all delightful sports,
Thy learned invention best can think upon.
Prepare a Mask, which lively represents,
How once the Gods did love: that shall not teach
Us by examples, but we'll smile to think:
How poor and weak their idle faining was
To our affection. Scahin, be free in wit*
And sudden: now come my Kingdoms Pride*
Hymen would wed himself to such a Bride.
Ex^nnt all but Scah*
Actus, Primi, Scaena, 2.
Scah. Nature, and all those universed powers,
Which showed such Admirable Godlike skill,
Inframing this true model of our selves,
This Man, this thing called man, why do you thus,
Make him a spectacle of such laughter for you,
When in each man we see a Monarchy?
For, as in states, all fortunes still attend:
So with a Kingdom, with a complete state
Well governed, and well managed in himself,
Both each man bears, when that best part of man,
(Reason) does swayand rule each Passion.
Affections are good Servants: but if will
Make them once Master, they will prove Tyrants still.
No more King now: poor Subject AMVRATH,
Whom I have seen break through a Troop of Men,
Like lightning from a Cloud: and done those Act^,
Which 'ene the Furies would have trembled a^:
Treading down Armies, as if by them he meant
Of d^ad men's backs to build up stairs to Heaven:
And now lies lurking in a woman's arms
(...) in the Le^he of Ignoble lust,

E^ter Amurath in state with Nob^ Eumorphe with attendant Ladies: whi^ Amu^ath
ascends ^is Throne, and places Eumorphe by him. Am. Shine here (my (...)) and
expel the night
More than a thousand stars that grace the Heavens:
Me thinks, I see the Gods inventing shapes
In which they mean to court thee. Jove he frowns
And is far more jealous, more suspicious
Of thee, then all the painted Truls, whose eyes
Bedecke the all ennameld Firmament.

Eum. Beauty (my Lord) it is the worst part of woman.
A weak poor thing, assaulted every hour
By creeping minutes of defacing time:
Asuperfici^ which each breath of care.
Blasts off: and every hum^rous (...) of gri^e,
Which flows from forth these Fountains of our eyes*
Wash^th away, as rain^ does Winters snow.
But those bles^ guiders of all Nuptial rites,
Have wrought a better sement to mak^ fa^t,
The hearts of Lovers; the tr^e name of Wife
Guilds over our th^ones, with a more constant shape*
Than can be subject or to time, or c^re:
And in our selve^; yea in our own tru^ brea^ts*
We have (...), d^ty, careful Love;
And last and (...) of all, we may have Children*
Children are Hym^ns pl^dges, these shall be
Perpetual chains, to link my Lord and me.

Amur. Art thou a W^man? Godd^sse, we ador^*
And Idolize; what we but loved before;
What Devils have men (...), whose furious brain^
Have often abused that Deity called Woman:
Dipping their Ravens quill in Stygian Ink,
To blast such heavenly pap^r as your faces.
Were all the enticing lusts, damned polici^s,
Prodigious fas^inations, u^searcht thoughts,
Dissembled tears, brok^ vows, loathed app^tites,
Luxurious and (...) desires.
Were all these of Women ^qually weighed,
That virtue in thy breast, 'twill out-ballance all
And r^compence the ^uine of all thy Sex.
Enter a Serv^t and speaks.
S^rv. So please ^our Majesty, L. (...) ready
For entrance with (...) M^sque.

Am. Tell him we are wholly ^ent for ^xpectation. Exit ^erv.
Sit, sit (my Queen) Musi^ke exceed your Spheres,
Think I am I^ve, and Godlike please our ears.

Scaena, 4. Actus, 1.
A Masque. Enter from aloft two T^rchbearers, then Jupiter and I^no, and tw^
T^rchbearers more, then Mars and Ue^us, and two Torchbe^rers more, then Apollo
and Pallas, and two ^ore Torchbearers, the^ Neptune and Diana. Whilst they are
discending, Cupid hanging in the Air, sings to soft Music this Song
following. Cupid sings. Gaze you mortals, gaze you still,
On the Gods now look your fill.
Jove and Juno are discending,
Yet her lealousie's not ending,
Mars, stern Mars, he will not fight,
But with Venus when it is Night.
Daphne crowns Apolloes head,
Whom she would embrace in Bed,
Neptune swells his frothy cheek,
Cause Diana is not meek.
Gaze you mortals, etc.

Jup. Come now my (Sister and Wife) we will begin
To court afr^sh! Nay, lour^ not (Heavens Queen)
Here on this green we'll a Lava^to dan^e,
What if our hairs grow silver, yet our strength,
Is young, and vigorous! Say (fellow Gods)
(Since we are full of Nectar, and our cares,
Lie drencht in our Nepenth^) take your Queene^, and be all
Ioviall, Mars for our Daughter Ve^s!
Apollo joyn^ with Pallas! Brother of Floods
^mbrace Diana! Gods sometimes merry be:
But in the night, when mortals m^ not see.
Each God as appointed by Jove, takes his Goddess, they dance a Masque dance,
and in the dance Jun^ observes loves gl^nces t^ Eumorphe, and at the end of the
dance, ^peaketh thus.
J^p. How now (wanton?) Can I no wh^e go,
For recr^ation but you f^llow me?

Jun. Is this your Recreation? Fie! My Lord
Will you be wanton still? For here you came Points at Eum^rphe*
For some new Harlot, some new Queen for you.

I^p. Jun^, Wife.


Iun^. Your Sister, (thunderer,) and not your Wife!
Banished from Heav^n I am; and your Bed,
Resign them both to Strumpets, Concubines, Points at E^morphe*
And now you com^ to see a fresh new less
In which Pole now or in what part of h^aven,
Shall she be stellified?

^pit. Shall still sinister thoughts wrong our intent,
Well ( I^o) well, you will ever be a woman,
A very, very woman! But ^ince she scolds,
Let Us hence (ye Gods) lest her infectious breath
Blast the s^cceeding day: and mortals curse
Her hel-bred jeal^usie: Calumnious woman
Come scold in heaven! For if Gods lived on Earth
S^spitious tongues would blame most innocent mirth.
Here all the Gods and Goddesses as^end at the top of the ascent, Iu^o ^tops
and speaks.
Iun. Well! love looked pale! I touched him to the quick!
It Is some new Mini^n he came down to see!
Hark (jealousy) know Jun^ is a woman!
Am I not mad yet? Mistress Bride, adieu:
Jove shall not steal a kiss? My curse is past,
When thou sleep'st first a Bride, may^t sleep thy last.
Exit.
C^pid. Fair Bride I sang thy ^pithalamy,
And left (...) for thy Nuptials:
Juno here thundered against the Thunderer,
Knowing how thy beauty dazles hers,
She durst not let heavens King once glance a look,
But threatened with her helbred incantations,
To metamorphise thine unparaleld
And most caelestiall shape into worse forms;
And more prodigiou^ than ever poisoned charms.
Wrought on the fabled Concubines of love:
But kn^w great Queen* my Mother Venus vows
Her everlasting guard to save such beauty,
Lest if thou perish, Nature (...) self
Loose he^ only pattern of ^erenity,
But I must ha^t, Love which the Gods protect,
Can never (...) by neglect.
Ascendit.
Amur. ^cahin, thine Art is excellent; but say,
Do Gods fall out for love amongst themselves?

Scah. My Lord, these are but fables: yet to make
The show more p^rtinent, and to grace your Queen,
Co^ceipt took leave to put the frown on Iu^o.

(...). My Lords and friends, we shall be ever thankful
And rest a Debtor to your courtesy.

Schah. Not so fair Queen, but durst ^ now ^ntreat
The Kings detaining from the sweets of Bed*
There yet remains one thought upon conceit,
Which you would doubly grace me to behold.

Amur. Our worthy Tutor shall obtain a Night,
A night ofus, in any case we can!

Scah. But then let me inform your Majesty,
That it is a warrier^ show, which once you loved,
But now are free from.

Amur. It Is best of all, with greediness we will see it,
O how the soul does gratulate it self
When saf^ly it beholds the dangerous state
Of others, and it self securely free!
Glad are we still to stand upon the shore,
And see a far off ot^ers tossed in the Sea,
Or in a Gallery at a Fencers stage,
We laugh when mutually each one takes wound^;
Sit still ( (...)) Sc^hin, thy show in have;
It Is best delight, to think^ on troubles past.

And proud Achilles, know your massi^ Tombs,
Which have so long orewhelm'd your valiant bones
Yawnes wide to let the imprisoned coarses forth.
I must afresh imbalme your sacred Trunkes,
And swe^t your memory with most happy oil,
Of just report, the Gods awakt me Fame
From out the oblivious Sepulch^r of sleep,
To drop that Ink into old Homer^ pen,
Werewith he curiously has lined your names,
Enfolding them in Everlasting Cedar,
And made them live to all posterity.
Virtue to valor has his gift assigned*
Great men may dye, yet deeds still rest in mind.

Most fortunate young man, whose worth is crowned
With everlasting Trophies of renown,
How has he set thee on the wings of Fame
Which soar in the middle region of high glory
Proposed to all, a never dying story.
Enter to Alexander, Philoicen^s a Capt^ine.
Phil. May it please the (Son of Jupiter) to accept
A Present, which our fight enricht us with?

Alex. Is it a Band of stubborn Souldi^rs Captain?


Phil^x. O no (my Lieg^) of exquisite formed Ladies*
Darius his wife, the wonder of her Sex,
Besides a Troop of such shapt Ganim^des,
That love ^ot equals.

Alex. Philoxenus* We thank thee! Yet hark!
There is a secr^t we would know of thee,
And you must tell Us: on your faith you must.

Phil. My L^ige --


Alex. Nay, no Court oil (by your leave) no flattery*

Is but a Vessel filled with human^ bloo^
And we trust not that Parasite like (...)*

All the destroying vices of frail man,

Or supple Luxury, did thou ere obscure
So to benumne our sense, that thou should think
We could be pleased with such effaeminate Presents,

That will not look on them, on boys, of women, Exit Phi^.
Hence then, and present some coward with them,
Give me a spectacle would please the Gods,
And make them bend their Ivorie brows to the Earth,
A man, a Soldier, ^trong with his wounds,
Amongst fate and ruin, upright and unshap't,
His mind ^eing all his guard, his wall, and armor,
And if he fall, ^till noble wrath remains,
In his amassed Trunk: not ^ll the darts
Stuck in his sides, making him a^ one wound,
A^right his courage, but wrath lending weapons,
Himself does seem a new and horrid War,
Nor are those Milke-sops which beguile the time,
With ^tealing minutes from their Ladies lips
Such as the Gods do love; for as the Wind
Loses it is force, if it be not opposed
With woods of strong and stubborn planted trees*
So virtue, if it wa^ke in trodden paths
That breaks up honors gap, and makes the way
Through paths of death, that flame burns strong
Which is resisted: valor ^hines in wrong:
Of Alexanders Soldiers be this sed,
War was a^ peace, when he the army led.
Exit.
Fame. Brave Macedon, how truly have thou weighed,
The reason of man's birth, who is equal borne,
For all the world, as well as for himself.
The world's a field t^o narrow for thy worth!
And although Nature, has her enacted bounds
For Sea and Earth, nay for the Heavens themselves,
Nor Sea nor Earth, shall coope thy valor up:
Valor of Nature ever this attaines
That it breaks forth, far, and beyond her chains,
And this I Will trumpet out. the whole worlds Ball
In which thou art so great, to thee is small;
When men want worlds to show their virtue in,
That is the crime o'th ^ods, and not their sins:
* It Is a decree of a true Soul^iers mind, Lu^an de ^il creed* cum qu^a ^sset
age^

To think naught done, when ought is left behind,
On (valiant youth) for, know I will appoint;
A Grecian Prince who so shall steep his quill
To paint out thy name in W^ls of eloquence,
That this thy soorne of Lust shall be
Proposed to all Kings example to posterity,
Know mortals that the men the Gods most love
In hard and dangerous Arts, they always prove,
When men live brave at first, then fall to crimes,
Their bad I Chronicle to future times:
For, who begins good Arts, and not proceeds
He but goes backward in all noble deeds.
Death consecrates those men whose awful end,
Though most men fear, yet all men must commend.

Passion, speaks.
Am. Scahin, the Macedo^s beholding to the^,
And history shall pay you thanks for this*
Which we rest Debtors for.

Scah. Great Prince, such kindness of acc^ptance pays:
For things which are but for a Kings delight,
In ^eeing them, he amply does requite.

Am. Eumorphe, Love, Queen, Wife, let us haste to Bed!
And may we wish this night aeternall time,
Scahin, good night: good night (kind Gentlemen!)
Thus when we are dead shall we revive oath stage:
One hour can present a Kings whole age.
Exe^nt o^nes.

Scaena, I.
Enter Schahin, Eur^noses. Schah. Observed you not the Kings looks? Grew the
not pale?


Euren. O yes (Lord Scahin) you mu^t be his Parent?
And snatch him out'h the Gulf he is falling in,
That feigned speech of Alexanders wrought
Like to most purging Physic, nights then black
When it is compared with day: Boldness is clear,
When it is presented before bastard fear.

Schah. I Will tell thee ( Eurenoses) thou art a Soldier:
And I am both a Soldier, and a Scholar,
And for these two Professions, am both most glorious:
And most meritorious, Pall^s is for both:
O what Tysiphon, what snaked scourge
Ca^ make a Scholar, that should never sleep,
But 'twixt the Pillowes of Pernassus Hills,
And dip his lips in springs of Helicon,
Make him by snoaring on a wanton breast,
And suck the adulterate and spiced breath
Of a lewd fained woman?

Euren. And for a Soldier ( Scahin,) let me speak!
We that do know the use of swords, and fire,
We that do know, halters can throatle us,
Shall we ere venture on a Woman's cruelty?
We that endur^ no Lords, shall we endure:
A woman to overcome us? Most true Demophoon!
I reverence thy memory, no pewling phrase
Could so euchaine thee to thy Thraci^n Dame,
But thou would r^her perish than she save thee.
I Will not declaime long on that common Theam^,
But they have lust lies in their fingers ends,
And whilst their sweet-hearts breath sticks in their sheets,
They will admit another. Lucrec^ in the day
To be a Thais, if the night will not gainsay.

Scah. Why ( Euren^ses) why should we endur^
A new Queen now? this Kingdom wants not heirs?
We know (should we have more) 'twere dangerous,
But hark! The Queens for Bed, enticing sleep soft Music*
With charms of Music: well, even such a Night*
May yet prove dismal ere the following Light!

Eure^s. Scahi^, let us in:
The first degree to purge such ils as these*
Is to instruct the patient his disease:
That you have done.

Scah. Yea, and will yet once more
Adventure a new stratagem, just when the King
H'as rid his Chamber, and with covetous have
Thinks for to clip Elysium, and drink deep
Of his long wished delight, I having skill
And uncontrolled acce^se, will in disgu^se
Seem his deceased Fathers apparition:
And by all ties of children to their Parents,
Bid him forsake that vile bewitching woman.

Euren. An easy Medicine does and sure will work,
To rub shrewd wounds, make them but fester more,
Foul Medicines we worse brook, than a foul sore.

Scaena 2. Actus 2.
Enter Eumorphe as to Bed in her Night-robes, ^ttended with Tayers and Ladies.
Menthe. Madam make have ^ The King will be impatient
If h^ be from you long. O Happiness.

Eumorph. Why Menthe, then thou deem'st us happy no^
Thus to command a world of services,
To have a King my subject; and attended
With these harmonious sounds t'affect our ears?

Menthe. Yes (truly Madam) it is a happiness.


Eumorph. It Is, were it Eternal: but I fear a power
A woman's power, does but make ^port with us;
Why, were we not once Menthe, a Captive (Wretch?)

Menthe. Yes Lady* now your happiness the more:
Riches please best, when there w^nt want before.

E^m. That power which raised us from so base, so high,
Can throw us down again as suddenly:
Me thi^ks my life is but a Players Scaene,
In the last Act my part was then to play,
A Captive (...), and a ^ueene to day.

(...). Your Morals (Madam) are too serious*
Me thinks the^e Ornaments should elevate
Your dumpish spi^its. Think this Bed a place
In which no ^cie slipping chance has power;
A Ki^gs safe Bed is like a guarded Tower.

Eum. No ( ^enthe) no, it is not the Bed of state,
Nor the free smile of a well pleased King:
It Is not the embracing Arms of Emperors,
N^ all the Gemmes that so inwreath the brows
Can so allure Fortune unto their gaze,

Scaena 3. Actus 2.
Enter Amurath in his Night rob^s, ^ Taper in his hand, se^mes much disturbed,
spe^kes. Amur. Turk, Amurath, slave nay something baser*
King! For all aerie titles which the Gods
Have blasted man withal* to make them swell
With puffed up honor, and ambitious wind,
This name of King holds greatest antipathy
With manly government* for if we weigh*
It Is subjects, and not Kings bear all the sway.
Each whispered mur mur from their idle breath,
Condemns a King to Infamy, to death;
Were there a Metempsucocosis of souls,
And nature should a free Election grant
What things they afterward would reinforme
The vain and haughti^st minds the Sun ere saw,
Would choose it is Cottage in some Shepherds flesh,
Nay, be confined within some Dog or Cat,
Than Antique like prancke in a Kings gay-clothes*
Were I no King, and had no Majesty,
I had more than all Kings, blessed liberty;
And without rumor might enjoy my choice,
Not f^aring Censure of each popular vo^ce;
Poor men may love, and none their wills correct:
But all turn Satyrs of a Kings affect!
O my base greatness! What disasterovs star,
Professed it self a Midwife at my birth,
To shape me into such prodigious States,
But hence regard of tongues! Were we a Saint,
Some envious tongue would dare our names to taint:
And he from slander is at securest rest,
Not that has none, but that regards it least.
Open you envious Curtains here is a sight, Draws the Curtain.
That might commend the act of Love so Chaste;
Were now the chariot-guider of the Sun
Weary on's task, and would entreat a day
Of Heaven to rest in, here is a radiant Look,
That might be fixed in the midst oth' Axletree;
And in despite of dark conspiring Clouds,
She would outshine Sun, Moon, and all the Stars,
O, I could court thee now (my sweet) a fresh,
Mixing a kis^e with every period:
Telling the Lillies how they are but wanne,
Earth in the vernant spring is dull, and dark,
Compared with this aspect! the Aeasterne air,
Famed with the wings of Mercury and love,
Infectious, but compared with this perfume!
Hence then the ambition of that furious Al^x.
youth,
Who knew not what a crime his rashness was!
I might overcome more Kingdoms; have more dominion
Enthrone my self an Emperor! oth' world,
I might! I might! Amurath thou might!
The Christians now will scoff at Mahomet;
Perchance they sent this wretch thus to inchant me!
O my perplexed thoughts! tush I Will to bed
Should the commanding Thunder of the Gods
Prohibit me, or strike me in the act!
Talk on (vain rumor) fame I dare thy worst!
Call me a Lusty, Lazy, wanton, Coward!
Should I win all the world, my breath once fled,
My bad would still survive, all good be dead.
Eum^rphe, sweet, I come! you sacred powers,
Who have bestowed some happiness on man,
To help to pass away this sinful ^ife,
Grant me a youthful vigor yet a while,
Full veins, free strength, complete and manly fence
To know, and taste a beauty most immense!

Scaena 4. Actus 2.
Amurath makes haste to the Bed, on a sudden enter Schahin dis. guised like
the Ghost of Orchan^ father to Amurath. Scahin. Amurath, Amurath?


Amur. Devil, Devil? What?
Dare thou appear before an Angel (Fiend?)

Scah. O Amurath, why does intemperate Lust
Raging within thy furious youthful veins,
Burst through thy fathers Tomb? Disturb his soul?
Know, all the torments that the fabulous age
Dreamed, did afflict deceased impious Ghosts,
Hartbiting-hunger, and soule-searching thirst,
The nere consumed, yet ever eaten prey
That the devouring Vulture feeds upon,
Are not such tortures as our offsprings crimes!
They, they sit heavy on us, and no date
Makes our compassionate affection cease.
O thou hereditary Ulcer, hark
By the name of Father, and by all those cares,
Which brought me to my grave, to make thee great*
Thou that have nothing of me but my crown:
My enterprise surpast the boundless Sea,
Cutting the churlish Waves of Hellespont,
When the flood stood which wind for to obey!
Euxinum groaned beneath my burdenous Ships;
I was the first of all the Turkish Kings
That Europe knew, and the fond Christians plagu^
What coward blood ran flowing in my veins,
When thou were first begot: who marrest all
Thy Fathers acts, by thy untamed desires,
Wherefore with Stygian curses I will lade thee
First, may she prove a Strumpet to thy Bed
Be her lips poison, and let her loose embrace,
Be venomous as Sco^pions! If ^he conceived,
A Generation from thee, let it be
As ominous as thou have been to me!
Rebellious to thy Praecepts, printing care^,
Upon thy aged brows, O may they prove,
As Faeries for to lash thee in thy rest!
But Amurath, if thou can quench this flame,
If thou will cut this Gordian thread, and rend hence,
That putrid Wenne which cleaves unto thy flesh,
Be all thine actions prosperous! Mahomet,
Shall be auspitious unto each design;
Fortune to show thee favor shall be proud,
Farewell! if that men do speak last, before
They dye, take root, then dead men's should take more. Exit Scahin.

Amur. What art thou vanished? Know (thou careful spright)
Thou shall no sooner pierce the wandering Clouds
With unperceived flight, than my resolve
Shall expiate my former Vanity!
Look on thy son thou (aerie intellect)
And see him sacrifice to thy command!
Now Titan turn thy breathing curses back!
Start hence bright day, a sable Cloud invade
This Universal Globe, break every prop,
And every h^ndge that does sustain the Heavens:
For straight must dye a woman, I have named
A crime, that may accuse all Nature guilty.
The Sex wisely considered, deserves a death;
For think this ( Amurath) this woman may,
Prostrate he^ delicate and Ivory limbs,
To some base Page, or Scul, or shrunk up Dwarf:
Or let some Groom lie feeding on her lips,
She may devise some misshapen trick,
To satiate her goatish Amurath,
And from her bended knees at Meditation,
Be taken by some slave toth' deep of Hell!
Thou Art a brave Creature, were thou not a woman:
(...)! Come! thou shall see my well-kept vow,
And know my hate, which saw me dote but now:

Scaena, 5. Actus, 2.
Enter, Schahin, E^renoses, Ch^se-Illibegge. Our Tutor, Eurenoses, Captains,
welcome!
Gallants, I call you to a spectacle:
My breast too narrow to hoard up any joy:
Nay, gaze here (Gentlemen!) give Nature thanks,
For framing such an excellent sense as (Sight)
Whereby such objects are enjoyed as this!
Which of you now imprison not your thought
In envio^s and silent policy.
Scab. My Lord to whatsoever you shall propose,
My sentence shall be free.

Euren. And mine. Chase-Il. And mine.


Am. Which of you then dare challenge to himself,
Such a pathetique a Praerogative,
So stoically ^evered from affection,
That had he such a Creature as lies here,
One, at whom Nature her self stood amazed:
One, whom th^se lofty exta^ies of Poets,
Should they decay, here't must not barely dump
Their dull inventions with similitudes,
Taken from Sun, Moon, V^olets* Roses,
And, when their raptures at a period stand;
A silent admiration must supply
Only name her, and she is all described.
Hyperbole of women, Color it self
Is not more pure, and incontaminate!
Sleep doates on her: and grasps her eyelids close*
The sky it self has only so much blew
As the azure in her vei^es, bends by reflexe.
Here Is breath that would those vapors purify,
Which from Avernus choakes the flying Birds!
Here Is heat would tempt the numbed Atkenian,
Though all his blood with age were conjealed ice!
Now, which of you all is so temperate;
That, did he find this Jewel in his Bed
(Unless an Eunuch) could refrain to grapple,
And dally with her? Come! Speak freely all.

S^a. Truly (my Lord) I came of mortal Parents
And much confess me subject to desires;
Freely enjoy your Love!
That were she mine, I surely would do no less.

Amur. What says Euren^ses?


Euren. My Lord, I ^ay;
That they may rail at light, that nere saw day;
But, had I such a Creature by my side
Were the world twice enlarged, and all that world
Overcome by me, all volumes writ,
Made clean and filled up by Rhetorique strains:
Of my great deeds, Historians should spend
Their Ink and Paper in my sole Chronicle,
A thousand such alluring idle charms,
Could not conjure me from betwixt her arms.

Amur. Your sentence Chase (...) Beg?


Chas. What need your Grace depend upon our breath?
I vow (my Lord,) if all those scrupulous things
Which burden us with praecepts so praecise,
Those Parents which when they are married once
And past their strength of years, think their sons ^traight,
Should be as old in every thing as they,
I say my Lord, did my head wear a Crown
That Queen should be the chiefest jem t'adorne it,
Spite of all hate, that is an unhappy state
When Kings must fear to love, least subjects hate.

Amur. Well spoke three Milk-sops, S^hahin! Your Sword!
Now, now be valor in this manly arm Scahin gives him ^ Sword.
To cut off troops of thoughts that would invade me!
Think you my mind is waxie to be wrought,
By any fashion, Orch^nes thy strength,
Here do I wish as did that Emperor,
That all the heads of that enticing Sex,
Were upon hers, thus then should one full stroke
Mow them all off. Here Amurath cuts off Eumorphes head, shows it to the
Nobles.
There, kiss now (Captains) do! and clap her cheek;
This is the face that did so captive me:
These were the looks that so bewitched mine eyes*
Here be the lips, that I but for to touch,
Gave over Fortune, Victory, Fame, and all;
These were two lying mirrors where I looked
And thought I saw a world of happine^e.
Now Tutor, shall our swords be exercised,
In ripping up the breasts of Christians.
Say Generals! Whether is first?

All. For Thracia!


Amurath. On then for Thracia, for he surely shall
That conquers first himself, soon conquer all.

Who can collect the scattering stars, and fix
The Erratique Planet in the constant Pole,
O why should thou take such solicitous care
To keep the air, and Elements in course?
That Winter should uncloth our Mother Earth,
And wrap her in a winding sheet of snow;
That then the spring duly revives her still,
Vnlinds her sinews, fills her cling'd up veins,
With living dew, and makes her young again;
Next that, the Nemean terror breathes her flames,
To parch her flaxie hairs with furious heat;
Which to allay too, thou op'st the Chataracts,
And waters the worlds Gardens with blessed drops;
Can thou* which can sustain the ponderous world,
And keepst in true poize, securely sleep,
Letting a Tyrant (which with a Philip, thus;
Thou might sink to Earth) to baffle thee?
A warrier in thy Fields, I long have been
To see if in thy sacred providence,
Thou meanst to arm me with thy thunderbolt,
Yet, yet, it strikes not now, he Gyant-wise,
He dares thee again; pardon our earnest zeal
What ere's decreed for man by thy behost,
He must perform: and in obedience rest.
Thou, like Spectators when they do behold
An hardy youth encountering with a Bear*
Or something terrible; then they give a shout,
So do thou even applaud thy self to see,
Religion striving with Calamity.
Which while it often bears, and still rests true,
It Is fence against all that after shall ensue.
Turk, i will oppose thee still! Heaven has decreed:
That this weak hand, shall make that tyrant bleed.
A man religious, firm, and strongly good
Cannot oth' sudden be, nor understood.

Make proud our eyes! then tell me. have thou slain

Make them stoop to us; O, I would bath my hands
In their warm blood to make them supple. ( Schahin;)

Our furie's patient! now will I be a Turk,
And to our Prophets altars do I vow,
That to his yoke I will all necks subdue,
Or in their throats my bloody sword imbrew.
Here Schahin calls in his soldiers, and each of them presents to Amurath, the
head of a dead Christian.
S^ah. Then King, to add fresh oil unto thy hate,
And make it raise it self a greater flame,
See here these Christians heads; thus still shall fall
Before thy fatal hand, these impio^s slaves;
So long as number's wanting to the sand,
So long as day shall come with Sun, and night
Be spangled with the twilight dawning stars,
Whilst floods shall fall into the Ocean
Shall Christians tremble at Turks thundering strokes.

Amurat. Soam I Amurath the great King of Turks,
O how it glads me thus to pash their brains,
To rend their locks, to tear these Infidels!
Who thundered when these heads were smitten off?
Stars I could reach you with my lofty hand,
It Is well enough, enough, (great Amurath)
For now I sit in Orchanes great throne,
And sacrifice due rites to Mahomet;
Yet why enough? I Will on and dung the Earth,
With Christians rotted trunckes, that from that soil,
May spring more Cadmean Monsters to overcome the^.
Captains, what Conntries next shall we make flow,
With Channels of their blood?

Euren. To Servia (my Lord) there are troops of arms,
Gathered to resist Mahometans.

Chase. At Bulgaria, there they set on fire,
The Countries as they pass, 'twere good we haste.

Amur. Why they do well! we like of their desire
To make the flame in which themselves must fry!
Ruin, destruction, famine, and the sword,

Bring strength into our Nerves! For in thy cause
Our Breasts upon their Rapiers we will run;
We'll with just hope (...) the tyrants rage,
Meet him in the face, fury will ^de us arms:
There is a power can guard us from a^l harms.

Sesm. Let Us be su^dain: for we'^ not find scope,
To see our haps. Who most does fear, may hope.
Enter to them Cobelitz.
Cobel. Governor, Captains, have unto your arms:
The dangers imminent, and the Turke's at hand

Lazar. ( Cobelitz) must we still wade thus deep
In blood and terror.

Cob. Yes ( Servia) we must, we should, we ought,
Ease and success keeps baseness company,
Shall we not blush to see the register
Of those great Romans, and Heroicke Greeks,
Which did those acts (at which our hearts are struck
Beneath all credence) only to win fame:
And shall not we for that Eternal name?
To live without all credence even to win fame,
Is not to know life's chief, and better parts:
To us of future hopes; calamity
Must help to purchase immortality.

Ses. Well spoke (true Ch^istian) they who still live high,
And snoare in praised applause nere know to bear,
A contu^ely, or check a fate,
Wisely to steer a Ship, or guide an Army,
Undaunted hardiness is requisite;

They which deny all right, of^give't in the Field.
Enter Christian Soldiers falling out amongst them* se^es fighting confusedly.
Cob. Why (Gentlemen) we want no foes to fight,
Nor need we turn our weapons on our selves!
One Soldier speaks as drunk.

And would^t persuade upon a larger pay, Answer the other.

Llew-^ackets. Will you see your Corporal wronged?
Well, since I fight for victuals for company,
Use now your swords and Bucklers.

Enter some Truls (...) both sides, they fight and scr^ch.
Sesm. O Cobelitz, what way shall we appease them?

Truls scold con^usedly: thus.
1. Trull. Out thy Corporal (huswife) has the itch,
You now will have foul washing, Drab i will tear your mouth;

2. An inch or two yet wider.


Cob. What, soldiers think you each distasteful word,
Given *mo^gst your selves so strong an obloquie The General parts them with
his sword.
That revenge spurs you to each others death?
And will not seek to wash those blasphemies,
In Seas of their foul blood, which they belcht out.
By our approaching foes, against the Essence
Of the Eternal.

Laz. Leave, leave, these factions; cease these Mutinies*

A Drum from the Turke's Cam^. Hark their Drums take advantage of these

Let us oppose our strength against our foe!
And in our Camp let not one soldier be,
Who will not find and strike his Enemies.

Cob. Now (blessed guider and great strength of arms)
If in thy secret and hid decree,
Thou have not yet appointed the full time,
Wherein thou meanest to tame this tiger,
Who dare murmur against thine hidden will?
Be we slain now, there is victory in store,
Which when thou please thou't give, and not before.
Give us still strength of patience, not to wish,
A funeral honor unto all the world,
When we are perishing we will still believe,
Those dangers worth our death we undergo.
Whilst who is ours, is all alike thy foe;
Should fortune loose this day when we are slain,
Thou can give hands, and strength, and men again^;
On thee we trust then, and on thee bear,
Scorning for Heavens sake to shed a tear.

Bassa. General now trust me these young slaves,
To be full of Valor, they have metal in them.

And which his Turkis^ Majesty requires;
They Will fit to be a near attendant guard,
On all occasions to the Emperor;
Therefore they shall be called (...)*
By me first instituted, for our Princes safeties sake.

Bass. Their vigor and strong hearts becomes such service,
For to overcome them made our soldiers sweat,
Much Turkish blood: the Servians kept the Fight,
With stubborn hard resistance, The Bulgarians
Left the right wing; there set I forward first,
And like a torrent rolled destruction on,
Raising huge storms of blood, as does the Whale,
Puff up the Waves against a mighty Ship;
Me thinks I see the Rivers of their gore:
Their Leaders trampled on by Turkish Horse,
The body of their army quite dispersed;
Themselves all floating in Vermillian pooles,
With their own weapons hasting to their death.
And such a slaughter did we make of them,
As Nature scarce can ere repair again.
One hasting to others death, pulling to ground,
Him that held up, so they each other drowned.

Scah. Still are they confident upon a power,
They know not what, who (as they think) can snatch
Their praecise souls from out the jaws of death.

Bass. Yes, such a superstition does possess them,
For when they looked for nothing but their fate,
And danger stood in sweat upon their brows?
They yet scorned Mahom^t, and profaned his rites,
And naught but horror made them to believe him;
So many men were fighting on his side:
As might have changed my seat, and part in the world,
(Though Nature stood against) to a new place:
Or carry Sestos whereby Abydos stands,
Or pull down Atlas with so many hands*

Me thought I did dream of this blessed hap,
How Fortune did involue them in their ruin,
And slight from danger, brought them into danger,
Each one astonished with a sudden fear,
Knew not the danger that was then most near.

Emb. Please then your Maj. and these reverend heads
To be informed my Masters will by me,
In Wedlock; if your Prince may be combined
To the fair Princess his sole Daughter:
He freely gives the Phr^gian territories,
And B^thinia to you for your Dowry;
Cata^, Simon, Egreg^os, Sansale,
Abbettin^on, the Ottomans estate,
Which Ottomans, because he not endures,
The Noble Zelzucciom family protests,
To join with you in quelling their ambition.

Scah. May't please your Majesty to like mine advice
It Is good to have alliance with such friends;
Kings that combine themselves are like to shafts,
The ancient Sage proposed unto his son!
Which whilst together they were close compact:
Arms, knees, and his wh^le strength* could never break;
Take one by one, they with a touch were tract,
So Kings may be overcome that stand alone;
But two such Princes, knit thus hand in hand,
Should Nations totter, they would firmly stand.

Am. Yes Schahin we'll approve what thou say;
Then from us carry the great Asians Monarch,
This his kindest greeting:
Tell him the gates of Prusa shall stand open,
And the glad air shall Echo notes of joy,
To ent^rtaine her who shall bless our Land,
With hopeful issue; gre^dy thoughts expect
Her soon arrival; and so (Emba^sador)
Inform thy Priucesse, when she shall appear,
A lasting Star shall shi^e within our Sphaere!

Enter Sasmenos, La^arus, Cobelitz. Sa. O Servia, our Cities are turned flames;
Each stays to have his own and others death:
And as though Heaven conspired destructiou too,
That reigns down scalding Sulphur on our heads,
Here one that lies thick gasping for his breath,
Is choakt with blood that runs from's fellows wounds,
Whilst others for the dead are making Graves,
Themselves are made the coarses that do fill them!
Nobles, and base, together perish all:
And a drawn sword sticks fast in every rib;
Our stones are dyed Vermillion with our blood!
Old creatures that are creeping to the grave,
Are thrust on fast^r!
Infants but in the (...) of their lives,
And thus kicked off, O most disastrous times,
To love our deaths, and make our life our crimes.

Laz. See, see, the ruins of our goodly Walls,
Our Cities smoke hinders the sight of heaven:
The conqueror yet amazed measures ou^ our Towns*
With eyes of terror, and does scarce believe
He has overcome us; yet among these fires,
Our dead men are denied their funeral flames:
And those infectious Carka^ses do perform,
A second murder on the rest that live!
And all the hope of safety that we have,
Is now to fix our flattering lips at's feet:
Mercy (perhaps) may wearied slaughter meet.

Sas. Will you do so? speak for I am determi'nd --


Cob. No (worthy General) Heaven avert
And ^rme you with the proof of better thoughts!
What though a Tyrant strives to terrify
All Christendom, and would not be beloved?
Let not your fears give impious rage such scope!
As for to bring Religion to profaneness:
Fortune and Heaven will scorn to try a man,
That hurles his weapons hence and runs away!
How is he worthy of heavens victory;
That, when it frowns, dares not look u^ and see?
Me thinks w^ three are now environed round,
With hosts of Angels, and our powerful Mars.
Is putting bows of steel into our hands:
He does suggest our wrath, and bids us, on!
O what an army it is to have a cause
Holy and just; there, there is our strength indeed.
-- Tu mente Labantes,
Dirige nos, dubios: Certo Robore firma.
If we must dye, the narrow way to bliss,
Shall be made wide for us, the gate wide open,
And the spread Palace entertaines with joy.
Mean time, let us look like men upon our g^iefe.
Out frown fate, Despot, Bulgaria, come!

Command Heavens favor in a cause so just.

Embass. My Lord, he bad me tell you that 'twas you

Therefore submission should not now appease him,

Thne O Hymen, thine: O she,
Whose Beauties verse Calliope,
Sing to Marriage rites an Io,
Io to Hymen.
Thorus.
To thee Apollo is my suit,
Lend me a while thy silver Lute,
O what a woe it is to bring,
A Bride to Bed and never sing.
Io to Hymen.
When she is old, still seems she young,
When she is weke, to her be strong!
Be Cyprus, both, and Paphos here,
Love, sing with merry cheer.
Io to Hymen.

Am. You Gods of Marriage: sacred Protectoresse
Of lawful propagations, and blessed Love
Be most propitious to these grafted stemmes!
Drop dewing showers of gen^ration on them!
Think (Son) this day too prodigal of blessing
As, that had ^uno taskt thee (like Alcides)
To grapple with St^mphallides, or cleanse
Angelas stables: or like the Trojan Boy,
Sit like a Shephe^rd on Dardadias Hills,
Such a reward as this fair Queen repayres,
O thou hoped future offspring spare thy Parent!
Hurt not this tender womb, these Ivory worlds,
When you are borne; O be within your limbs,
The Grandsire Amurath, and fathers strength!
Line their faces (Nature) ^ith their Mothers dye!
And let the Destinies mark the ensuring night
In their Eternal Books, with notes most white.

All. Grant it great Ma^omet!


H^tam. Most awful father and my honored P^inee,
Although it be enacted by the Heavens,
That in these bonds of marriage such curse
Attends on Princes above private men,
That nor affection, nor home-nourisht Love
But ^tate and policy must elect their Wives.
Which must be fetched from Countries far remote!
Yet the protecting Powers have such a care,
Both of their offsprings and their Kingdoms state,
That to what they ordain, they work in us
A sudden willingness to make us obey;
For, in this breast, I do already feel
That there is a kindling a Diviner heat:
Which disobedience never shall extinguish.
And, if there be any felicity
From these u^ited Loves to be derived
From the weak sex into the husbands soul,
Then may my Lord make his affection sure,
To be repayd with unattainted Love,
In which a pretty people ye shall live,
Wi^ soft and yiedling courtesy in all
He shall command, my willing arms shall still,
Be open t'enfold within a Wives embrace,
If any comfort else there be in store,
(Which modesty keeps silent to it self)
Cause only husbands and the night must know it,
My Loyalty shall ever all perform*
And (though my) Lord should frown, I Will be the ^ame*
Green wood will burn with a continued flame:

Baiaz. Princess our ardor is already fired,
Yet with no violent temerity;
Such as might fear it is short and soon decaying*
Thy virtue seems so to exceed thy Sex,
And wisdom so far to out-pace thy years,
That, surely (Ptincesse) soon maturity,
Argues in them, hidden Divinity.
Expected ( Hymen) here has bound our hands,
And hearts, with everlasting ligaments*
Fortunate both we are, and have one bliss
The want of which for ever does infect,
With anxious cares the sweets of marriage Beds:
Our Parents benediction and consent,
They are the truest Hymen's, and should be
To children the best marriage Deity.
Thus then attended with ^uch sacred charms
Our last day of content shall never come;
Till we must part by th'unresisted doom,
With a pleased error we will age beguile,
All stars on us, an aequall yoke must smile.

Amur. Now (Lords) who will dance
A Turkish measure? Ladies our nerves are shrunk;
And you now fix the sign of age on me,
You who have blood still flowing in your veins,
Be nimble as an Heart: Caper to the ^phaeres!
O you are light, that wrnt the weight of years!
Music. Here Amurath ^cends his Throne, the rest set down to dance, Bajazet
with Hatam, etc. the end of the dance, all kneel, Amurath begin an health, a
flourish with Cornets.
Amur. And health to our Bride and her father!
O (Nobles) would this wine were Christians blood,
But that it would Phrenetique humors breed,
And so infect our b^aines with Superstition!
Enter Eurenoses with six Christian Maidens, richly attyred, their Hair
hanging loose, in their hands C^ps of Gold with (...)* etc.
Euren. Auspitious fortunes to great Amurath!
To open more springs unto this full tide of joy,
Know (potent Emperor) I from Europe bring
Six daughters of six several Kings,
Whose Cities we have equaled to the ground;
And of their Palaces did torches make,
To light their souls through the black Cave of death ( Achero^)

Am. Describe (good Captain) how the dogs were wearied.


Euren. So weary were they to endure to endure our swords,
That by impetuous mutiny themselves,
Turned on each other; slew their Masters;
Childrens own hands, tore out their fathers throats.
And each one strove who should be ^laughtered first;
Here did a brother pash out a Brothers brains,
Some in stinking Quagmires, and deep Lakes
(Which they had made t'avoyd their excrements)
Ran quick, and in the lake lay buried.

Am. (Goon Executioner of our most just wrath!)


E^. Nor did it leave till death it self was weary*
Murder grew faint, and each succeeding day,
Showed us the slaughter of the day before.
Amongst carcasses and funerals we stood,
Denying those that lived such Ceremonies
As i^ their Temples to the Indian Gods,
With prayers and vows they daily offered:
Nor destiny, nor cruelty ere left,
Till they had nothing to work upon;
For, of so many souls that breathed
These six are all remained: which as a Pledge
Of my best service to your Majesty.
I here am bold to yield an offer.

Am. Nor shall this present b^ unrecompenced;
For thy true service, on thee ^e bestow
All the rich gifts, which all these Asian Lords
B^ought to adore these happy Nuptials,
On you fair Bride great Princess and our Daughter
Do we bestow the^e Virgins (daughters to Kings)
For your attend^nce.

Hat. We are too much bound unto our Princely Father*


Am, No (Daughter) no! we hope thou art the spring,
From whence shall flow to all the world a King*
^Captaines and Lords* to morrow we must meet,
To think of our rebelliious son in Law)
Be this time all for comfort and delight,
Short wedding days make it seem long to night.
Exeunt ^mn.
Scaena 3. Actus 4.
Enter Lazarus and Cobelitz, bringing the dead body of Sesmenos. L^z. Here set
we down our miserable load,
O (...) with whom is it that we fight?
With Lydia^ Lions, and Hyrcania^ Bears;
Which grind us daily in their ravenous tenth?
The Tyrant (as it were dest^uctions Enginere)
Help Nature to destroy the worlds frame quickly,

Cob. Alas my Lord that needs not, every day
Is a sufficient he^per to decay:
Great workman, who art sparing in thy strength
To bring things to perfection, a^ to oret^rne
All thy best wo^kes, thou usest sudden force,
When man's a^ E^rio! and first con^eived
How long it is ere he see his native light?
Then borne, with expectation for his growth!
Tenderly nourisht, carefully brought up,
Grown to p^rfection, what a little thing,
Serves to call on his sudden ruining?

Laz. Come Cobelitz, *among those demolisht ston^s
We'll sit as Hecub^, at those Troy^n Walls:
Our tears shall be false glasses to our eyes:
Through these we will look, and think we yet may see
Our stately Pinacles, and strong founded holds;
That which one hour can delapidate,
One age can scarce repair.

Cob. No sir, for nothing's hard
To Nature, when she means t'consume
A thousand Oaks (which time has fixed in the earth,
As Monuments of lasting memory)
Are in a moment turned to ashes all;
Things that rise ^lowly, take a sudden fall.

Laz. What course now Cobelitz, must we still be yoke*
To misery, and murder? We scarce have room,
Upon our bodies to receive more wounds,
And must we still oppose our selves to more?

Cob. Yes! We are ready still; a solid mind
Must not be shakt with every blast of Wind!
Pollux, nor Hercules, had none other art,
To get them Mansions in the spangl'd Heavens
Then a true firm resolve; the A^riatike Sea,
Shall from his currents with tempestuous blasts,
Be sooner heard, than virtue from it is aim,
Let us but think (when we so many see,
Enjoying greater quiet than our selves.)
How many have endured more misery;
Ilion, Ilion, what a fate had thou?
How fruitful were thou in matter for thy foe?
Thus we'll delude our grief, make our self glad,
To think of miseries that others had.

Laz. I (Captain) I! they that furnished thee
With sentences of comfort, never saw,
Their Cities burnt, their C^untries desolate!
It Is easy for Physicians for to tell
Advice to others, when themselves are well!

Cob. Tush, tush (my Lord) there is on our side we know,
One that can both, and will our weak hands g^ide,
One that will strike and thunder; Giant then,
Look for a dart! we must not appoint when;
Mean while help for to convay this burden henc^
Turk, though thy tyranny deny us graves,
Corruption will give them spite of thee!
Nor do our corpse, such Tombs and Cavernes need:
For our own flesh, still our own graves to breed:
And, when the Earth receives not, when they die;
Heavens Vault ouerwhelmeth them, so their tombe's in the sky.
Exeunt with a dead Truncke.
Scaena 4. Actus 4.
Enter Aladin as flying, an arrow through his arm, wounded in his forehead,
his sh^eld st^cke with darts* with him two Nobles. Alad. Besieged on every
side? Iconi^m taken?
Entrencht within my foes my self must lie
Wrapped in my Cities ruin! Turks come on!

1. N^b. Nay but my Lord, mean you to meet your death?
Let Us have our flight, and trust more to our feet
Then words, or hands --

Alad. Why, so much of our blood
Is already spilt* as should the glittering Sun
Exhale it upward, 'twould obnubulate
It Is luster, else to fiery Meteors turn.
Some council (Lords) he that is amidst the Sea,
When every curled wave does threat his death
Yet trusts upon the oars of his own arms,
And sometime the salt foam does pity him,
A Wolf, or Lion, that has filled his gorge
With bloody prey, at last will lie to sleep,
And the unnaturalst creatures not forget
Their love to those whom they do know their own!
My wife's his Daughter; si^ce we cannot stand
His ^ury longer* she shall s^age his wrath.
The boisterous Ocea^ wh^ ^ no (...) oppose,
Growth's (...) is lo^t, whe^'t has no foes.

2. Noble. Why then (my Lord) array your self in weeds*
Of a Petitioner: take the Queen along,
And your two children; they may move his eyes;
For, desperate sores ask desperate remedies.

Alad: Go (Lords) go: fetch some straight. O Heavens!
O fortune they that lean on thy cracked wheel,
And trust a Kingdoms power, and domineere
In a walled Palace, let them look on me,
And thee ( Carmania) greater instances
The world affords not to demonstrate
The frail estate of proudest Potentates,
Of sturdiest Monarchies: high Pinacles
Are still invaded with the prouder winds;
They must endure the threats of every blast;
The tops of Caucasus and Pindus shake,
With every crack of thunder; humble Vaults
Are nere touched with a bolt, ambiguous wings
Has all the state, that hovers over Kings.
Enter the 2. Nobles with a winding sheet, Aladin puts it on. I, I, this
vesture fits my misery!
This badge of poverty must now prevail,
Where all my Kingdoms power and strength does fail,
Why should not a propheticke soul attend
On great men's persons, and forewarne their ils?
Raging Boots does not so turmoile
The Lybian ford, as Fortune does great hearts.
Be^tona and Erynnis scourge us on*
Should wars and treasons cease, why our own weight
Would send us to the Earth; as spreading arms
Make the huge trees in tempest for to split.
For as the slaughter-man to pasture goes,
And drags that Ox home first, whose Bulk is greatest,
The lean he still lets feed: disease takes hold
On bodies that are pampered with best fare;
So does all ruin choose the fairest marks:
At which it bends, and strikes it full of shafts,
Ambition made me now that eminent but:
And I that fell by mine own strength, mu^t rise
By professed weakness; Buckets full sink down:
Whilst empty ones danceith' ayr^, and cannot drown.
Come (^ords) he out o^*s way can never range,
Who is at f^thest! worst nere finds ill change.

Actus V.
Scaena I.
Enter at o^e ^ore Amurath, with (...); at the ^ther door Aladin, his Wife,
two Chi^dren, ^ll (...) white s^ets, kn^le dow^e to Amurat^. A^ur. Our hate
must not part thus, I Will tell thee (Prince)
That thou have kindled violent Aetna in our breast,
And such a flame is quenched with naught but blood:
His blood whose hasty and rebellious blast,
Gave life unto the fire; should Heaven threat us;
Knows we dare not menace it; are we not Amurat^?
(Whose awful name is even trembled at)
So often dared by Pigmy Christians;
Which we will crush to air; what haughty thought
Buzzed thy praesumptuous ears with such vain blasts,
To puff thee into such impetuous acts?
Or what, durst prompt thee with a thought so frail,
As made thee covetous of so brave a death?
As this known hand should cause it? know that throat
Shall feel it strangled with some slave brought up
To no^ght but an Hangman: thy last breath,
Torn from thee by a hand that is worse than death

Alad. Why then, I Will (like the Roman Pompey) hide
My dying sight, scorning Imperious looks
Should grace so base a stroke with sad aspect;
Thus will I muffle up and choke my groans,
Least a grieved tear should quite put out the name,
Of lasting courage in Carmanias fame.

Am. What? still sti^e necked? Is this the tru^e you b^g?
^prinkled before thy face those Reb^ll Brats,
Shall have their brains, and their dissected lim^es,
Hurld for a prey to Kites; for (Lords) it is fit
No spark of such a Mountain threatening fire,
Be left as unextinct, least it devour,
And prove more hot unto the (...) Emperie,
Then the (...) blaze did trouble Iov^!
First sacrifice those Brats --

All. Wife. (Dear father) let thy fury rush on me!
Within these entrails sheath thine unsatiate sword,
And let this ominous, and too fruitful womb,
Be torn in sunder? For from thence those Babes,
Took all their crimes; error made them guilty,
'Twas Natures fault, not theirs; O if affection
Can work then; now show a true Fathers Love,
If not, appease those murdering thoughts with me*
For as (...) pleaded with her sons
For their dear Father, so to a Father I
For my dear Babes and husband; husband, father*
Which shall I first embrace? Victorious father,
Be bl^t those now sharp thoughtsllay down those threats,
Vn^laspe that impious Helmet! fix to earth
That monumentall Sphere look on thy child
With pardoning looks, not with a Warriers eye:
Else shall my breast cover my husbands breast,
And serve as Buckler to receive thy wounds,
Why do thou doubt? Fear thou thy Daughters faith?

Am^r. I fear, for after Daughters perjurie
All Laws of Natures shall di^tastfull be;
Nor will I trust thy children or thy self.

All. Wife. No Father it is I, fear you him, he you,
I both, but for you both, for both you war;
So that it is best with him that is overcome.
O let me kiss (kind father) first the Earth
On which you tread, then kiss mine husbands cheek.
Great King embrace these Babes! you are the stock
On which these Grafts were planted --

Am. True, and when sprouts do^ rob the tree of sap,
They must be pruned,

Wife. Dear Father, leave such harsh similitudes*
By my deceased Mother, (to whose womb
I was a ten months burden:) By your self,
(To whom I was a pleasing In^ant on^e)
Pity my husband, and these tender Infants!

Am. Yes to have them collect a manly strength,
And their first lesson that their Dad shall teach them
Shall be to read my misery.

Al. Stern Conqueror: but that thy daughter shows,
There ^nce dw^lt good in that ob^urate breast,
I would not ^pend a tear to soften thee!
Thou see my Countries turned into a Grave:
My Cities ^carre the Sun with fiereer flames,
Which turn them into ashes! all my self
So slickt and carved, that my amazed blood
Knows not through which wound first to take it is way;
If not on me, have mercy on my Babes! --
Which, with thy mercy thou may turn to Love.

Am^rath, No sir, we must root out malicious seed:
Nothing sproutes faster, then an envious weed!
We see a little Bullock, amongst an heard
(Whose hor^es are yet scarce crept from out his front)
Grows on a sudden tall, and in the Fields,
Frolicks so much, he makes his Father yield.
A little twig left budding on an ^lme
(Ungratefully) bars his mother ^ight from Heaven!
I love not (...) Aladins.

Alad. Threat all a Conqueror can, can threat but death,
And I can die, but if thou would have mercy! --

Wife. O see you feet we are proved with this hands kiss!
The higher those great powers have raised you,
Press that which lies below with gentler weigh^*
To pardon miseries is Fortunes height:
Alas, these Infants, these weak sinewed hands
Can be no terror to these Hectors arms!
Beg (Infants) beg, and teach these tender joints
To ask for mercy; learn your lisping tongues
To give due accent to each syllable:
Nothing that Fortune urges too, is base;
Put from your thoughts all memory of descent:
Forget the Princely titles of your fathers:
If your own misery you can feel,
Learn thus of me to weep, of me to kneel*

Al. Do (boys) and imitate your Parents tea^es*
Which I (like (...)) shed, when he beheld,
H^ctor thrice dragged about the ^rojan Walls.
He that burst open the gates of Erebus,
And roused the yelling Monster from his Den,
Was conquered with a tear! great Monarch learn,
To know how dear a King does weeping earne.

1. C^. Good Grandsire see, see how my father cries!


2. Chapter Good mother take my napkin for your eyes!


Wife. (Good father) hear, hear how thy daughter pr^yes:
Thou that know how to use stern Warriers arms,
Learn how to use mild Warriers pity too!
Alas? can er^ these ungrowne strengths repair
Their Fathers batter^d Cities? Or can these
These orethrowne Turrets? ( Jconium) what small hopes
Have thou to lean upon? If these be all?
Not half so mild has our misfortune been
That any can ere fear us: Be pleased --

Am. Rise (my dear child) as Marble against rain,
So I at these obedient showers, melt!
Thus I do raise thy husband: thus thy Babes:
Freely admitting you to former state.
But Alad^, wake not our w^ath agai^e!
"Patience grows fury that is ofter stirred;
When Conquerours wax calm, and cease to ^ate,
The conquered should not dare to reite^ate.
Be thou our son and friend.

Alad. By all the rites of Mahomet I vow it!


Am. Then for to seal u^o our love,
Your self shall lead a wi^g in ^ervia,
In our immediate Wa^res, we are to meet
The Christians in Cassanoe's Plains with speed:
Great Amurath nere had time to breath himself:
So much, as to have warring with new foes;
No day securely to ^is Scepter shone,
But one Wars end, still brought another on.
Ex^t.
Scaena 2. Actus.
Enter La^s, Cobelitz, Soldiers, all armed. Cob. Let now victorious wreathes
ingirt our ^rowes,
Let Angels 'stead of Soldiers wield our arms,
Against him, who that our Citti^s might be his
Strives to depopulate, and make them none!
But look, look in the air (me thinks) I se^
An host of Soldiers brandishing their swords;
Each corner of the Heaven shoots thunderbolts,
To nail these impious forces to the Earth.

Laz. Soldiers stand to 't! though fortune bandy at's
Let Us stand her shockes, like sturdy Rockesith' Sea.
On which the angry foaming Billows beat,
With frivolous rush: and break themselves, not them;
Stand like the undainted countenance oth' sky,
Or, like the Sun, which when the foolish King*
Thought to obscure with a Cloud of Darts,
Out looked them all, our lives are all enchanted,
And more i^vulnerate than Thetis son.
We shall have hands snd weapons, if the stone,
Of fortune glide from under our weak feet,
And we must fall: yet, let all Christians say,
It Is she, and not the cause, that wins the day.
We must believe Heaven has a greater care
Of them, whom fortune does so often out dare!

Cob. Gentlemen, brothers, friends Soldiers, Christians,
We have no reason to command of Heaven
A thing denied to all mortality.
Nor should we be so impude^tly proud,
As in this weak condition to repute
Our selves above the stroke of Lady Chance,
A caution must divine it ever fixed,
That whil^t her checkes, equally fall out,
Community should ease their bitterness.
I could afresh now shed those Princely tears
To think such sudden rain should attend
Heroicke spirits glittering in bright arms*
But if the Grecian (when he heard the dreams
Disput^d subtly by Philosophers,
To prove innumerable extant worlds)
Was ^trucke with pensive^, and wept to think
He had not yet obtained ^ne for himself;
What terror can affright a Christians thoughts
Who knows there is a world, at liberty
To breath in, when this glass of life is broke?
Our foes with cir^ling fury are intrencht;
Pelions of earth and darkness shall orelade them,
Whilst we shall mount, and these our spirits light,
Shall be yet ponderous to depresse them lower.
Nay, my ^nthesiasticke soul divines,
That some weak hand shall from the blazing Zone
Snatch Lightning, which shall strike the snarling C^r
With horror and amazement to the Earth!
Which Hell cannot oppose! Turk, Tyrannize!
Stand, yet at length to fall my sacrifice.
Super-Olympicke vigor will (no doubt)
Squease all thy supercilious rancor out!
Exeunt i^ a M^.
Scaena 3. Actus 5.
The Heavens seem on fire, Comets and blazing S^arres appear, Amurath
speaks. Am. Who set the world on fire? How now (ye Heavens)
Grow you so proud that you must needs put on curled locks*
And cloth your selves in Peri^igs of fire?
Mahomet (say not but I invoke thee now!)
Command the puny-Christians demi-God
Put out those flashing sparks, those Ignes (...),
Or i will unseate him, or with my Looks so shake
The ^taggring props of his weak seated Throne,
That he shall find he shall have mo^e to do
To quell one Amurath, then the whole Giant brood
Of those same sons of Earth then ten Lycaons!
Do the poor snakes so love their misery
That they would see it by these threatening lights?
Dar^ ye blaze still? I Will toss up Buckets full
Of Christians blood to quench you: by those hairs
Drag you beneath the Center: there put out
All your praesaging flames in (...)!
Can you outbrave me with your pidling Lights?
Yawne earth with Casements as wide as hell it self*
Here a Va^lt opens. Burn Heaven as ardent as the Lemnian flames!
Wake (pale Tysiphon) spend all thy snakes!
Be Eacus, and Minos as severe
As if the Jail delivery of us all
Were the next Sessions! I Will pull Radamant
By his flaming furs from out his Iron Chair.

Whilst he is in his fury, arise four Fiends, framed like Turkish Kings, but
black, his supposed Predecessors dance about him to a kind of hideous noise,
sing this Song, following. 1. Fiend. Horror dismal cries, and yells
Of these thy Grandsires thee fore-tells,
Furies sent of thee to learn
Crimes, which they could nere discern.

All. Furies sent, etc.

2. Fiend. O Amurathl thy Father's come,
To warn thee of a sudden doom,
Which in Cassanoe's fields attends
To bring thee to thy Hellish friends.

All. Which in Cassanoes, etc.

3. Fiend. Megaera and Ennio both do stand,
Trembling, least when thou art damned
Chief of Furies thou should be,
And they their snakes resign to thee.

All. Chief of Furies, etc.

4. Fiend. Terror we a while will leave thee,
Till Cocytus Lake receive thee.
Cerberus will quake for fear
Where he a new Turks fate shall hear.

All. Cerberus will, etc.

Am. Now who the Devil sent my Grandsires hither?
Had Pluto no task else to set them too?
He should have bound them to Ixions wheel,
Or bid them roll the stone of Sysiphus:
Beshrew me, but their singing did not please me!
Have they not been so drunk with Lethe yet
As to forget me? Then can portend no ill
For, should the fates be twining my last thread;
Yet none durst come from Hell to tell me so!
Shall I be scared with a Night-walking Ghost;
Or what my working fancy shall present?
Why, I can look more t^rrible, then Night,
And command darkness in the unwilling day:
Make Hecate start: and draw back her head,
To wrap it in a swarthy veil of Clouds.
Drop sheets of Sulphur, you prodigious skies!
Cyclops, run all thy Bullets into Ae^,
Then vomit them at once! should Christians
Couch to the bottomless abyss of (...),
Or hide themselves under Avernaes shade,
This mine arm should fetch them out! Day must perform
What I intend, wrath raines a bloody storm:
And now 'gins rise the Sun, which yet not knows
The misery it shall see on Amuraths Foes,
Lords, Leaders, Captains:
Enter Schahin and others.
Schah. Your Highness up so soon?


Am. He small rest takes,
That dreams on naught but bloody broils and death.

S^hah. Your Grace seems much distempered: Beds of sweat
Bedew your brows with never wonted palenesse.

Am. Why; see you not? The heavens are turned Court Ladies,
And put on other Hair besides their own:
Can guess (learned Schahin) what these flames portend?

(...). My Lord, such things as these we (...) mu^t (...),
And wonder at, and yet not search the reason,
Perchance unwholesome fogs exhailed (...) th'Sunne
Are set a blazing by his too near heat:
But it is not lawful that a mortal eye:
Should dare to penetrate Heavens secrecy.

Am. Does it not bode a Conquest?


Schah. Yes, against the Christians:
For, unto them it bends sinister looks,
And frowns upon their army more then ours.

Amur. So, so! ^ome on, ere ' Phosphorus appear
Let Us to it, and so prevent that sluggard Sol!
If we want light, we'll from our Winnards*
Strike fire enough to scorch the Universe*
Mine armor there! Some g^ for his arm^ur.
Now (Mahomet) I implore
Thy promised aid for this auspitious day!
To^e me aloft, and make me ride on Clouds!
If my horse fail me, those fire breathing jades,
(Which the boy Phaethon k^ew not how to guide)
Will I pluck out from out the flaming teame,
And hurl my self against those condense Spheres,
On which i will sit, and stay their turning Orbs;
The whole vertigious Circle shall stand still,
But to behold me: Mine armor (...)!
So help on here, now like Alcides do I girt my self, They bring his Armor.
With well knit sinews, able to stagger Earth,
And threaten Nature with a second Chaos:
If one impetuous broyle remain to come
In future ages, set on foot this hour!
How well this weight of steel befits my strength?
Me thinks the Gods stand quivering, and do fear
(When I am armed) another Ph^egrae's near!
Chiron shall see his Pindus at my feet!
And, i will climb to Heaven, and pull it down,
And kick the weighty b^rden of the world,
From off the Babies shoulders that supports it!
For I am safer Buckled against my foe.
Then st^dy Jason who by the enchanted charms
Medea gave, incountred Unicorns,
Queld Lions, struggeld with fiery belching Bulls:
Obtained a glorious prize, a Fleece, a Fleece
Dipped deep in tincture of the Christians blood.
Shall be my spoil, nay should they hide their heads
In their Gods bosom, here is a sword shall reach the^ ^
Come they shall know no place is free from wrath,
When boiling blood is stirred in Amurath.
Exeunt. An alarm, excursions: fight within. Enter at one door a Christian,
at another a Turk; fight, both (...): so a new charge, the Turks kill most.
Enter Lazarus, Schahin kills him. Enter Eurenoses, Cobelitz, they fight,
Cobelitz ^aints, falls for doad. A ^howt within, a token of Victory on the
Turks side, a Retrait sounded.
Scaena 4. Actus 5.
Enter above Amurath, Bajazet, Nobles, to ^e the spoil. Schah. Here (mighty
Prin^) take view of Victory,
And see the field too narrow for thy spoils!
Erynnus hides her head as if afraid,
To see a slaughter. She durst never hope for,
Earth has the Carcasses, and denies them Graves,
And lets them be and rot, and fat her womb,
Scorning to be unto slaves a Tomb.

Am. Where are b^come those ominous Comets now?
What? ar^ those pissing Candles quit^ extinct?
Leave their disasterous snuffes no stench behind them?
It Is something yet, that their God sees their slaughter.
^ending sulphurious Meteors to behold
The blessed destruction of these Parasites*
I knew the Elements would first untye
The Nerves of the Universe, then let me dye!
Here Cobelitz rises as aw^kt, amazed le^ning on his Sword, s^mbling ore the
dead bodies, looks toward Amurath.
E^ren. See (King) here is one worm yet that dare confess
He breaths and lives, which once this hand crushed down.

Am^r. Ha, ha, by Mahomet and we are weary now:
Some Mercy shall lay Victory asleep.
It will a Lawreat prove to this great strife,
Amongst all these murdered to give one his life,
So we'll descend.
He go^th from alo^.
C^. From what a dismal grave am I awaked,
Intombed within a Golgotha of men;
Have all these Souls prevented me in bliss,
And left me in a dream of happiness?
But soft! m^ thoughts he said he would descend!
Then, Heavens one minutes breath, that is all I ask,
And then I shall perform my life's true task.
Amurath descends on the Stage, C^belitz staggers toward him.
Am. Poor slave, would live?

Here Cobelitz is come to him, seeming to kneel, stabs him with a pocket
Dagger.
Cob. Yes Turk to see thee dye!
Howl, howl* (grim ^artar) yell (thou gristly Wol^e)
Force the blood from out thy gaping Wound!
Dij tibi non mortem, quae c^ctis p^na paratur,
Sed sensum post fata, tu^ dent (imp^e) morti.

Amur. My spirit makes me not to f^ele thy weapon!
Hold you (cracked Organs) of my shottered life,
I am not touched yet! can ^ not mock my death,
And think it is but a dream t^lls me I am hurt?
Dare thou then leave me (blood?) Can be so bold
As to forsake these veins to flow on Earth?
And must, I like the unhappy Roman, dye
By a slaves hand?

Cob. Tyrant, it is known
He Is Lord of others life's that scorns his own!

Am. I that could sca^ce ere sleep, can I ere die?
And will none ^eare my life when I am dead
Tortures and torments for the murderer!

Cob. Ha, ha, ha! Le^ning on his sword.
I thank the (great omnipotent) tha^ I
Shall ere laugh out the lag end of my life!

Am. Villain, thy laugh wounds worse then did thy Dagger!
Are you Lethargick (Lords) in cruelty?

Cob. Nay, hear me ( Turk) now will I prompt their rage
Lock me in the Bull of Phalaris,
Cut off these eyelids, bid me then out-gaze
The parching Sunbeams; flea this tender ski^,
Set nests of Hornets on my rawest flesh,
Let the Siconian Clouds d^op brimstone on me,
Power boiling Lemnos on my greenest wounds,
Put on my shoulder Ne^us poisoned shirt, The Lord that holds (...) Amurath
offers to touch his wounds.
Bind all these bloody faces to my face
Rock me Procra^tes like --

Am. Hell, oh! I cannot brook your smallest touch,


Cob. Ha, ha, each groan is Balsome to my wounds:
I am perfect well!
Bajazet offers to kill Cobelitz; a Nobleman holds his hand*
Schah. Rascal dare deride us?


Cob. Yea? and while your witty furies shall invent
For me, some never heard of punishment;
I see a guard of Saints ready to take me hence.
Take then froe flight, my new rewarded soul,
And seat thee on the winged Seraphims,
Have to the Empyreum, where thy welcome
Shall be an Haleluia, anthem'd forth
By the Chorus of the Angell-Hierarchy.
Pierce with (swift plumes) the concave paths oth' Moon
Where the black air enlightened is with stars.
Stay not to wonder (there) of wandering Signs
At the inhorn'd Gemin^, or Amph^s Harp,
At Arctos, or Boots, or the Bear,
(Which are to pl^se wizard Astrologers)
Soar higher with the pitch and then look down
To la^gh at the hard trifles of the world!
Perchance some often have known a better life,
Never did none ere leave it more willingly.

Am. Fear your deaths (Gods) for I have lost my life,
And what I most (complain) my tyranny!

C^b. Soul to detain thee from thy wished rest
Were but an envious part ^ arise, farewell:
To stay thee to accuse or fate or man
Would show I were unwilling yet to leave thee
But dear companion hence: cut through the air:
Let not the grosen^sse of my Earth ore-lime
Thy speedy wings, fly without weight of crime.
He dies.
Am. O now have I and Fortune tried it out.
With all her best of favors was I crowned
And suffered her worst threats, when most she frowned.
Stay (Soulel) a King, a Turk, commands thee stay!
Sure ^ am but an actor, and must strive
To personate the Tragic ends of Kings.
And so (^o win applause unto the Scaene)
With fained passion thus must graspe at death!
O but I see pale Nemesis at hand:
Art thou dull fate, and do not overspread
Gimmerion wings of death throughout the world;
What? Not one Earthquake? One blazing Comet
T'accompany my soul to his Funeral?
^s not this hour the general period
To nere returning time? Last breath command
A new Dewcalions deluge, that with me
The world may swim to his Eternal Grave,
Crack hindge that holds this globe, and welcome death,
Will thou not stay Soul? Friend not stay with Kings?
Sink th^n, and sink beneath the Thracian Mou^.
Sink beneath Athos, be the B^sh Waves
Of Acheron thy Tomb, i will want a Grave;
So all parts fear, which first my Corpse shall have;
For in my Grave, i will be the Christians foe.
Here like a Massy Pyramide i will fall,
I Will strive to sink all the whole fabric with me,
Quake Pluto, for it is I that come
A Turk, a Tyrant, and a Conqueror,
And with this groan, like thunder will I cleave,
The timorous earth, whilst thus my last I breath.
He dies.
Baiaz. O eafie powers, to give's all at first,
But in their loss they make us most accursed.
Here all the Nobles kneel to Ba^azet.
Schah. The Taper of your Fathers life is spent
We must have light still and adore a Sun
That next is rising, therefore mighty Prince,
Upon your shoulders must the load
Of Empire rest.

Baiaz. Why (Lords) we have a Brother
Who, as in the same blood he tocke a share,
So let him bear his part in Government:

Sc^. My Lord! within the selfsame Hemispheare
It Is most prodigious when two Suns appear!
One body by one soul must be informed.
Kingdoms like (marriage beds) must not endure
Any corrivall! (...) was nere secure
Whilst she contain'da Pompey, and a Caesar.
Like as one Prophet we acknowledge now
So of one King in state we must allow.
You know the Turkish Laws, Prince be not nice
To purchase Kingdoms, whatsoever the price.
He must be lopt, send for him he must dye.

Baiaz. O happy Bajazet that he was borne
To be a King when thou was Counselor.
Call in our Brother ^cup,
Some goes for him. Here six^ m^ ^e up Am^raths Trunk on their should^rs.
Baj. Why (Lords!) is Am^rath so light a weight?
Is this the Truncke oth' T^rkish Emperor?
Oh what a heap of thoughts are come to naught
What a light weight is he unto six men
Who durst stand under Ossa, and sustain it:

Euren. My Lord, these Meditations fit not you:
You are to take the honor he has left,
And think you of his rising, not his fall! Enter Iacup.
Let your decree be sudden, here is your Brother.

B^j. B^other, I could have wished we might have met
At tim^s of better greeting! Our father has
Bequeathed to the Grave these ashes, to us his State.
No^ have we leisure (yet) to mourn for him
Brothe^, you k^ow our state has made a Law,
That, he that sits in a Majesticke Chair,
Must not endure the next succeeding heir.

^ac. Yes, we do:
And (Brother) do you think it is crime enough
To dye, because I am son to an Emperor?

S^ah. My Lord, we know their breathes in him that ay^
Of true affection, that he does much desire
You should be equal in his Kingdom with him:
But still when two great evils are proposed:
The less is to be chosen.

E^ren. My Lord, your life's but one:
Kings are the threads whereto there are inweaved
Millions of lives, and he that must rule all
Must still be one that is select from all.
Although we speak, yet think them not our words,
But what the Land speaks in us! Kings are free*
And must be impatient of equality.

(...). And is it ene so?
How have th^se Dogs fawned on me lickt my feet
When A^th yet lived? Felt all my thoughts,
And soothed them to the sight of Empyrie*
And now the first would set their politic hands
To strangle up that breath, a blast of which
Their nosthrils have sucked up like perfumed air
Well brother well by all men this is spoke,
That heart that cannot bow, may yet be brok^.

(...). Brother you must not now stand to upbraid;
They which do fear the vulgars murmuring tongue,
Must also fear the authority of a King;
For rulers mu^t esteem it happiness
That with their government they can hate suppress:
They with too faint a hand the Scepters sway,
Who regard love, or what the people say:
To Kindred we must quite put off respect,
When it is so near it may our Crown affect.

^ac. Then name of Brother do I thus shake off,
For it is in vain, their mercy to implore
When impio^s Scatists have decreed before.
Yet King although thou take my life away
See how ^le dye in better state then thou!
Who like (my Father) after his greatest glor^
May fall by some base hand: The Minister
To take my breath, shall be to thy self, a King.
Here lacu^ takes a Scarf from his Arm, and p^ing ^t about his neck gives
one end to Bajazet. Yet give me leave a while* to Prophecy,
You that so Puppet-like delude your hopes,
And Miser-draw the ancestry from Kings,
Thinking, that fates dare not app^oach your blood
Till they do seize you, then you leave this Earth
Not as you went, but by compulsion dragged;
Still begging for a morrow from your Grave,
And with such shifts you do deceive your selves:
As if you could deceive mortality,
No (Brother King) nor all the Glow-worme state,
Which makes thee be a Horse-leach for thy blood,
Not all the Parasites Minions thou maintains*
Nor the restorative Dishes that are found out.
Nor all thy shifts and tricks can cheat mortality,
Or keep thee from a* death that is worse then mine.
Should all this fail, age would profess it self
A slow, but a sure Executioner.
O it is a hard thing well to temperate
Decaying happiness in great estate
But this example by me may you gain:
That at my death I not of Heaven complain
P^ll then, and with my fall pull on thy self
Mountains of burdenous honor which shall curse thee
Death l^ades the willing by the hand
But spurs them headlong on, that dares command.
^ere himself pulls ^e end Bajazet the other. ^acup dies. ^azet. Take up this
Trunk; and let us first appoin^
O^ Fathers and our Brothers Funerals,
The senseless body of that Ca^fe slave,
Hurl to a Ditch, Posterity shall hear
Our less ill Chronicled, but time shall hear
These minutes rather, then repeat their woe.
Now Primacy, on thee i will medi^,
Which who enjoy thee, are in blessed estate.
Whose age in secure silence fleets away,
Without disturbance to his funeral day;
Nor ponderous nor unquiet honors can
Vex him but dies a primate ancient man,
What greater powers threaten inferior men
A greater power threatens him again:
And like to wasted Tapers Ki^gs must spend
Their lives to light up others: So a^l end.
Exeunt bearing o^t solemnly the bodies of Amurath and Iacup.
FINIS.
