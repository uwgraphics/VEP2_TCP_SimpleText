4. Let euery-one therefore have a good regard to thissame Doctrine of
Prophetie: and take it effectually to Heart, what the same requires.

The Prophetie of the Spirit of Love.
The first Chapter.
THIS is the Esa. 26. c. Mich. 1. a.

Inhabiters of the Earth: in such-sort / that the Earth also shall disclose the
Apoc. 18. c.
Blood which she has swallowed-vpp / and not hyde the same any longer.

2. THe Lord the God of Heaven moved Me, in his Mind reversed;or Spirit;:
his Power inco^passed Me, with a Russhing-noyse: and the Glory of ye same God
of Heaven, became great in my Spirit of his Love: in such-wise / that ye great
Cleernes of God whollye environed Me / and shone rounde-aboutmee. Wher-through
the Sight of mine Eyes, became cleerer then Crystal. and mine Understanding,
brighter then the Sun: in such-sort / that I insawe with mine Eyes, the great
Ezech. 18. c. 2. Pet. 3. b.
Long-suffering of God. and how lardge the same extended over the Children of
Men: and perceived reversed;with mine Understanding; the Breakinge-fourth of
the Esa. 13. a. Amos. 5. h. Joel. 2. a. b. Soph. 1. b.

Breaking-fourth of the-same great Day, God will also now in the last time
reversed;as a Nahum. 1. a.
Revenger against all his Enemies; make-vpp himself and appear / and Act. 17.
d.
judge the universal Earth with Righteousness / according to his Promises.

3. I insawe also / that God will powre-fourth his Romans 2. a.
Amendment; taken-heede unto his Love / Grace / and Long-sufferinge ^ but, in
the Mercy of God / and in the Time of Grace reversed;when as the Mercy was
proffered unto them; Pro. 1. c.

the Lord; loved and ensued the worldly Foolishnes / Malitiousnes / and
Self-mindednes / as also the Infidelity of the Good-thinking-wise, more then
the Salvation of God.

4. In all thissame reversed;wherewith the Lord so moved Me, in his Mind; I
took good-heede reversed;in mine Understanding; what the Lord-his Meaning and
Will was: and wher-to or to what-maner of Service, the Lord moved my Mind.

5. When I then perceived or understood it / so was the Lord-his Meaning and
Will unto Me / eauen-such, as his Beeinge reversed;or Essence; spoke unto Me.
For the Being of God gaue-fourth his Sound and Voice: and spoke unto Me H^
reversed;through his Spirit of Love; all these Words / and said:

6. GO now out / and bide always in Mal. 3. 2.

righteous Judgment do com; let the Sound of ye Voice of my gracious Word
passe-fourth, over the universal Earth. Show all People, my Will: declare my
Laws / Ordinances / or Institutions, to the Vnunderstandingones: forbear not
any longer the Transgressinge of Men: nether wynke thou hence-fourth at the
Offenses of any People: but make-manifest their Esa. 58. a.
Unrighteousness unto them: and correct or reprove them, for all their
Ignorance / Blockishnes / Self-seeking / and Hypocrisy / and for all their
Lying-imagination of the Knowledge / wherewith they geeue-fourth themselves
before thee, as-though I approved their cause: in which dooinge, they all
make-manifest their false Righteousness before Me / and bring their Filthynes
before my Face / making themselves eauenso Esa. 1. b. Amos. 5. ^.

7. Let also the Slothful / Pro. 6. a. 24

Fasshion and Beeinge of the wicked World / Ier. 7. 6. 11. a. 13. b. 18. b.

Love; nor have any regard therto] know and understand, that they all are Esa.

gracious Word of the Lord reversed;in living Power; out of the living God,

10. Have a good regard therefore reversed;O ye Children of Men; unto that
which becomes This-day reversed;out of the gracious Word of the Lord and his
holy Spirit of Love; spoken and expressed unto you: and harde^ Psalm. ^. b. Heb.

the gracious Word and his holy Spirit of Love; how can I reversed;in
any-case; suffer you any longer, then I have suffered you? Seeing that the
Lord himself will not forbear you any longer, in your Unwillingness to his
Righteousness.

2. Thus-longe have I, with the Romans 2. a. 2. Pet. 3. b.
Longsufferinge of the Lord / beheld and considered-it also with
Longsufferinge, what manner of Ways it might be / that ye all loved to walk
in: and whether also any-man loved / or desired to enter obedientlye, into the
Pro. 3. b. 4. b. Math. 3. a. Mark. 1. a. Luke 3. a. Act. 2. d. 3. c.

as the same becomes administered reversed;under the Obedience of the Love;
according to the Truth of God.

3. Thus-longe have I ben conversant reversed;in stilnes; with many of you. and
ben by you, like as one that can well abide to looke-on the Wickedness of Men /
and yet not correct or reprove the same. But in all thissame, my Spirit has been
greatly Ier. 9. a. 14. b. Lam. 1. b. ^. b.
bourdened with grief ^ and reversed;with much heauy-cheere; very woeful and
sorrowful for you all, O ye Children of Men.

4. For, vewinge the whole Face of the Earth / I 4. Esdr. 14. ^. Math. 24. b.
Iniquity of the perverse World. and the manifold Dan. 9. c. 11. Mark. 13. b.
Abominations of Desolation, wherewith she has brought herself into a most
confusedestate: also the many and manifold Esa. 5. c. Romans 1. c. 12. 1. Cor.
1. b.
Self-wisdoms / Chosen-holynesses Col. 2. a. 2. Tim. 3. a.
/ and false God-seruices or Religions of Men / which they have taken-on unto
them, out of the Scripturely-learnednes / and Imagination of the Knowledge ^
and made or divided themselves reversed;ther-through; into many Sects /
Dissentions Mat. 24. a. 1. Cor. 1. b. 3. a Gal. 5. c. Iam. 3. b.

5. I Have moreover, marked reversed;with Longsuffering; the Fourth-going of
all such as bost them of the Love / and persuade themselves, that they cleave
unto the Love and the Wisdom / Whether that there were any better-thing loved by
them, then by the World: and whether also, that they approached any nearer to
the Truth of God / and to the upright Being of the Love, then the Wise of the
World and Scripture-learned.

6. I have also for-that-cause, walked louelye among certain of them / and
behaved myself 2; Cor. 5. b. Tit. 3. a.
very gentlelye with them: hopinge eauenso, that the true Fear Pro. 1. a.
Eccli. 1. a. b. c. 2. b.

Zeal to the Righteousness / and the Concord Ezec. 11. b. 1. Cor. 1. a. Ephe.

worldly Wise and Scripture-learned.

7. But reversed;alas; like as the World / together Romans 1. c. Ephe. 4. b.
blinded in Heart / and deaff in the Understanding (which comprehend not Sap.
1. a. Math. 11. c. ^. Cor. 2. b.

reversed;through the Spirit of his Love; requires: but have always a Lust to
themselves / and cleaue-vnto the Covetousness / the Volupteousnes of the Fleash
/ and the Self-wysdom, which seduceth them) eauenso I have found many of you
reversed;yea / almost all, which make-bost of the Love / and talk much thereof;
to stand in suchlike case: and also advisedly marked, that ye reversed;under
the Pretense or Color of the House or Service of Love; have taken-on to
your-selues, the 2. Pet. 2. b. Iudae. 1. b.
Volupteousnes of the Fleash reversed;according to the manner of the World; to
be your freedom ^ and your own Ier. 7. c. 11. a. 18. b.
Thoughts of the Goodthinking, according to the Imagination of ye Knowledge
(like unto many vnilluminated 1. Cor. 1. b.
Scripture-learned and Goodthinkinge-wyse) to be your Wysdom: and have no
regard to the godly Life of the gracious Word / nor to the Pro. 1. c.
Counsel of the Testimonies of the holy Spirit of Love / nether-yet humble you
obedientlye to the Love and her Service. And yet notwithstanding reversed;when
one asks you, whether ye have adjoined you to the Love / or are minded to
continewe with a good will, by the same; ye answer and say expresslie: O yea:
We will cleave unto the Love / and not forsake the same in any-case.

8. Howbeit / ye cover ther-withall, your false Romans 1. c. Ephe. 4. b. 2. Pet.
2. b. Iudae. 1. b.
live and walk: and remain eauenso without the Obedience of the holy Word
/ and of the Requiringe of his Service of Love / and bide also bound or owned
to yourselues / and to your own Counsel and Will: and com not to the Truth
of God / which floweth-fourth seruiceablelie, out of the Love / for to be
obedient reversed;as right John. 8. b. Iam. 1. b.
Disciples of the Word; unto the same.

9. But verily / after such a manner, ye are reversed;toward the gracious
Word of the Lord / and his Service of Love; Psalm. 50. e. Ier. 2 d. 3. a.
Oze. 4. 5. a.
eauen like-vnto an Whore, which after her hearts Good-thinkinge reversed;to
a Cloking of her Whordom; chooses an Husband / and coupleth herself in
mariaige unto him / for that she might bost her as a Maried-wife. and under
such a Covering / and Bosting that she has an Husband, commits her Whordom
/ Seeing that ye in like manner without Christ / and against Christ
reversed;although ye make great boast of him; commit Whoordom / and deal nor
walk not according to the Doctrine or Requiringe of Christ.

10. For which your covered or cloked Whoordoms-cause and unrighteous Walkinge,
the Lord has moved my Mind. and commanded me, to figure-fourth your
Whordom and Ier. 7. a. b.
unrighteous Ways before you / also to Esa. 58. a.
reprove you thereof / and to exhort you to Amendment: and to warn you
eauenso of the Destruction / that is for to com upon the Ungodly, in the
righteous Judgment of God.

11. O Thou whoorish Nature! Be ashamed reversed;I say; presently before the
Lord / and before the Seat Esa. 16. b. Mat. 25. d.

bostest thee so of Christ, the gracious Word of the Father reversed; ^. Cor.

reversed;whilst thou so do; hold thine Heart common or of-one-beeing with

and his Love.

12. O Ye Children of Men: When ye now Ier. 2. d. 3. a.

repent you: and let yourselues eauenso reversed;under the Obedience of the

3. For although ye dissemble with Me: and how craftelye soever ye cover or

so-much the more naked and bare, Psalm. 44. a. Heb. 4. b.

turn them not Ier. 3. a. b.

2. For that cause / such show plainly their Unfaithfulness: and, in turninge

which they take unto them, through the Imagination of their Knowledge) that they
are utterly estraunged from the gracious Word of the Lord / and from his
Requiring / and turned toward their own Word and Will.

3. c. Ephe. 5. b.
thyself shall not choose but acknowledge by the Light / that thou art false ^

judged falsely, in all thy Judgment ^ and always dealt or walked wickedlie:
that thou also art worthy Apoc. 17. b
of the everlasting Condemnation / and that it appertains or belongs not
unto thee, to have or bear any Dominion upon the Earth.

11. But if thou refuse to com by the Light / and wilt yet notwithstanding
excuse or go-about to clear thyself, before all Eyes of the Fleash Esa. 58 a.

2. Cor. 11. a Apoc. 21. a
Bride or Church of Christ: and that thou have not dealt as an adoulterous
Whore ^ but faithfully, as an upright Maried-wife / So will I then, out of my
Jealousy which I bear over thee (O thou false Nature Esa. 1. a. John. 8. c.

the same shall thou be constrained to drink / To the end that it may eauenso
thereby become manifest and known, Whether thou art an adoulterous Whore / or
the upright and faithful Maried-wife of ye Man Christ.

12. For verelie / li^e as the Jealousy of an Husband stands over his Wife /
that she deals not faithfully / but as an adoulterous Whore / Eaue^so
stands also my Jealousy over thee, thou earthly Man reversed;which wilt 2.

thyself for the same; and also over all such / as reversed;with the Spirit of

13. FOr-that-cause / if thou now account not thy self, for an Whore: but
esteemes^ thee for the faithful Espoused-wife of Christ: and that my ielous
Conceauing cannot stand otherwise toward thee, but that thou art a
presumpteous Whore / which dissembleth or playeth-the-hipocrite with Christ /

Whore / or of an unfaithful Wife.

14. But if now thou be faithful / and the upright Espoused-wife of Christ /
the^ fear not to drink these bitter Waters, for any Destruction that can
chance unto thee therout / or endamaige thee thereby. For the upright
Maried-wyfe or Bryde of the Man Christ [namelie / the faithful Romans 12. a. 1.

and the bitter Waters have not hurt or endamaiged Her.

15. But truly, as for thee reversed;O thou corrupt Nature of the earthly
Man; thou shall in thy vaineglorious Bosting reversed;that thou art the right
Espousedwife of Christ; he found a Liar ^ and as a wicked, mischeuous, and Apo.

any Hypocrisy or Couerednes: nether-yet likewise shall anyman know how to

6. But the Strangers reversed;which walk without the Famelie of Love / or

understand nor Esa. 6. a. Act. 28. c.

7. But reversed;alas; this cannot an earthly Man Romans 8. a. 1. Cor. 2. b.
but fleashlie minded; comprehend nor understand: yet will he nevertheless
always go-on, with his lyinge, earthly, and fleashlie Minds / and judge
eauenso the spiritual and heavenly Understandings therout. For-that-cause
he cannot have any Lust nor bear any Love, toward the True / Spiritual /
and Heavenly. but well, toward the Lyinge / Earthly / and Fleashlie:
wherout he likewise (as it is right-well to be perceived) bringeth-fourth
nothing-els, but the Gal. 5. c.

8. But a spiritual Man Romans 8. b.
is clothed with the Spirit of God and the Truth: For that cause he is also
according to the Truth, spirituallie minded. His Fourth-goinge and the Lust of
his Works, is reversed;in all; to the Gal. 5. c. 6. b.

Difference, betwixt the Math. 13. f. John. 3. d.

2. But he may well hear witnessed thereof reversed;according to ye manly

3. If he therefore will judge / speake-fourth / and 1. Cor. 1. 2. b.
knows not anything at-all of the Spirit of God: and that it is all
Foolishnes, what he judges or speaks thereof.

4. Verelie / therefore they all do err very much / that judge, according to

Fleash or Letter; God-his Truth reversed;which is heavenly and spiritual;
and his Wonderful-actes (whether it be of h Esa. 41. c. 48.

Time of Grace / whylst there is yeat Grace and Comfort at-hande / and to be
obtained: and have a diligent regard unto the Service of Love. and what
the same requires.

7. Verelie / It requires not This nor That / according to the Fleash of the
worldly Dealinge / nor according to the Dealinge of the false Hearts and
unregenerated Hypocrites. but, Ephesians. 4. b.
an upright Being in the Love of Jesus Christ: That is / to become Luke 1. g.
releassed from all Ownednes or Selfnes ^ and hallowed Romans 12. a. 1. Tess. 4.
a.

Service of Love.

8. Whosoever then reversed;in all Obedience of the Requiring of the gracious
Word and of his Service of Love; does reversed;in such sort; respect-well or
take good heed unto the same / He shall also be John. 14. ^.

Yea / they shall com to him / and make a godly Dwellinge with him.

9. HEer-vnto give you now all wholly over / Deu. 30. a.

10. For I say unto you verelie: Whosoever now reversed;in thissame Day of
Love; bideth slothful and careless, toward the upright lovely Beeinge: and
eauenso estraungeth his Heart, from the Ministration of the Elders in the
Service of Love / either holds it common or of-one-beeing with the consumable
Romans 1^. a. 1. Cor. 7. d.

Heb. 3. b. 4. b
Rest of the peaceable Kingdom: but be Apo. 21. 22. b

Ungodly.

11. Therefore remember now bytimes (ye all which are now reversed;in thissame
Day; so sloth full or sluggish, toward the Service and Entrance of the
upright Beeinge of God ^ and so self-wise against the holy Spirit and the
Requiringe of his Service of Love) what a Misery and Sap. 5. a.

shall gather them together reversed;in the Perfection of the Love; Math. 24. d.

find yourselues shutt ther-without.

12. Verelie / then will it fal-out to-late for many,

13. Whosoever now therefore respects not the right Eccle. 3. a. Pro. 6. a.

Harvest reversed;or Fulness of the Time; may get his Math. 13. d.

of his Service of Love / He shall likewise have lack of Pro. 20. a. Amos. 8.
b.
Corn [namelie / of the Fruits of the Woorde]. and then afterward (when he
finds himself poor and Luke 15. b. Apo. 3. b
empty / and sees well, that ye Holyones of God, are filled with great store
of Goods) be constrained to bewail his case with Sap. ^. a. Luke 1^. ^.
grievous Misery / and shall not find anymore meet or convenient time, for
to gather anythinge. but reversed;out of Doubtfulnes; fall into Sap. ^. a. Luke
21. ^.
