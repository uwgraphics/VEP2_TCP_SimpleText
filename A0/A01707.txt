A description of Nortons falcehod of York shyre, and of his fatal farewell.
The fatal fine of Traitors lo:
By Justice due, deseruyng so.

OF late (alas) the great untruth
Of Traitors, how it sped
Who list to know, shall here (...)e
How late allegiance fled.
If Rivers rage against the Sea.
And swell with soddeine rain:
How glad are they to fall again,
And trace their wonted train?
If fire by force would forge the fall
Of any sumptuouse place,
If water floods bid him leave of,
His flames he will disgrace.
If God command the wyndes to cease,
His blastes are laid full low:
If God command the seas to calm,
They will not rage or flow.
All things at Gods commandment be,
If he their state regard:
And no man lives whose destiny
By him is vnpreparde.
But when a man forsakes the ship,
And rowles in wallowing waves:
And of his voluntary will,
His own good hap depraues:
How shall he hope to escape the gulf?
How shall he think to deal?
How shall his fancy bring him sound
To Safties shore with sail?
How shall his freight in fine succeed?
Alas what shall he gain?
What fear by storms do make him quake
How often subject to pain?
How sundry times in Dangers den
Is thrown the man unwise?
Who climes withouten hold on hye,
Beware, I him aduize.
All such as trust to false contracts,
Or secret harms conspire?
Be sure, with Nortons they shall taste
A right deserved hire.
They can not look for better speed,
No death for such too fell?
God grant the justice of the world
Put by the pains of hell.
For such a pensive case it is,
That English hearts did dare
To pass the bounds of duties law,
Or of their cuntrie care.
And mercy has so long releast
Offenders (God does know)
And bounty of our courteous Queen
Too long has spared her foe.
But God, whose grace inspires her heart,
Will not abide the spite
Of Rebels rage, who rampe to reach
From her, her title quight.
Although she flow in pitiful zeal,
And loves to suck no blood:
Yet God a caveat will her lend
To Appease those Vipers mood.
A man that sees his house on fire,
Will seek to quench the flame:
Else from the spoil some part convey,
Else seek the heat to tame.
Who see a penthouse wether beat,
And hears a boistrouse wind:
But heedefull sasetie of himself,
Will force him succor find?
The pitiful pacient Pelican,
Her blood although she shed:
Yet will she seem her date to end,
Or care her young be sped.
The Eagle flynges her young ones down
That sight of sun refuse:
Imperfect fowls she deadly hates,
And rightly such misuse.
The Crane would fly up to the Sun,
I heard it once of old:
And with the king of birds did strive
By Fame, I heard it told
And do woe she would not fall f^e no,
But higher still did mou^^:
Til past her reach (says old report)
Shame made a back recour
I touch no Arms herein at all
But show a fable wise:
Whose moral sense does repr(...)
Of clymers hye the guyse.
Who buyldes a house of many (...),
and laith not ground work(...)
But does ertorte the ground (...)g,
His buildyng can not dure(...)
Who sekes surmising to disp(...)
a Ruler sent by GOD:
Is subject sure, deuoide of grace
The cause of his own rod.
A bird that will her nest defyle
By right should loose a wyng:
And then is she no slying foul,
But slow as other thing.
And he that loses all at games,
Or spendes in foul excess:
And hopes by haps to heal his harm,
Must drink of dear distress.
To speak of brydles to restrain
This wylfull wayward crewe:
They care not for the book of God,
To Princes, men untrue.
To cuntrye, causers of much woe,
To faithful friends, a fall:
And to their own estates, a styng,
To others, sharp as gall.
O Lord, how long these Lizerds lurkt,
Good GOD, how great a while
Were they in hand with feigned hearts
Their cuntrye to defyle?
How did they frame their furniture?
How sit they made their tools:
How Simon sought our englysh Troie
To bring to Roman scooles.
How Simon Magus played his part,
How Babylon bawd did rage:
How Basan bulls begone to bell,
How Judas sought his wage.
How Iannes and Iambres did abide
The brunt of brainesicke acts,
How Dathan, Chore, Abiram seemd
To dash our Moses facts.
How Roman merchant set a fresh
His pardons brave a sale,
How always some against the Truth
Would dream a senceles tale.
Gods vicar from his god received
The keys to lose and bynd:
Baals chaplein thought hes fire woe(...)e
Such was his pagan mind.
Good Lord how hits the ter^ their (...)ts
That says such men shall be
In their religion hot nor cold
Of much variety.
And sundry sorts of sects sur(...)
Division shall appear:
Against the father, son sha(...)ue,
Against mother, daughter (...)e.
Is it not come to pass trow you?
Yea, bastards sure they be,
Who our good mother Queen (...)
Withstand rebelliouslie.
Can God his vengeance long reta(...)
Where his true servants feel
Iniuriouse spights of godless men,
Who turn as does a wheel?
No no, his suffryug long (be sure)
Will pay his foes at last:
His mercy moved once away,
He shall them quight out cast
With sentence just for their untruth,
And breakyng of his will:
The fruits of their sedicious seeds,
The barnes of earth shall fill.
Their souls God wot sore clogd with crime
And their posterity
Bespotted sore with their abuse,
And stand by their folly.
Their liuyngs left their name a shame,
Their deeds with poison sped:
Their deaths a wage for want of grace
Their honors quite is dead.
Their flesh to feed the kytes and crows
Their arms a maze for men:
Their guerdon as examples are
To dash dolte Dunces den.
Throw up your snouts you sluggish sort
You mumming maskyng route:
Extol your exclamations up,
Baals chapleines, champions stout.
Make suit for pardons, papists brave,
For traitors indulgence:
Send out some purgatory scraps,
Some Bulls with Peter pence.
O swarm of Drones, how dare ye still
With labouryng Bees contend?
You sought for home from the hiues,
But gall you found in end.
These waspes do wast, their stings be out
Their spite will not avail:
These Peacocks proud are naked left
Of their displayed tail.
These Turkye cocks iu color red,
So long have lurkt a loofe:
The Bear (although but slow of foot)
Has pluct his wings by proof.
The Moon her borrowed light has lost,
She wayned as we see:
Who hoped by hap of others harms,
A full Moon once to be.
The Lion suffered long the Bull,
His noble mind to try:
Until the Bull was rageyng wood,
And from his stake did hye.
Then time it was to bid him stay
Perforce, his horns to cut:
And make him leave his rageing tunes
In scilence to be put.
And all the calves of Basan kind
Are weaned from their wish:
The Hircan Tigers tamed now,
Lemathon eats no fish.
Behold before your balefull eyes
The purchase of your part,
Survey your sodeine sorrowful sight
With sighs of dubble heart.
Lament the lack of your alies
Religious rebels all:
Bewepe that ill success of yours,
Come curse your sodeine fall.
And when ye have your guiles out sought
And all your craft approved,
Peccauimus shall be your song
Your ground work is removed.
And look how Nortons sped their wills
Even so their sect shall have,
No better let them hope to gain
But gallows without grave.
que William Gibson.
