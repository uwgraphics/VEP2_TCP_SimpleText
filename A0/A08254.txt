Here begins the Rule of saint Benet.







Or asmoche as every person ought to know the thing that he is bound to keep
or occo^plisshe / and ignorance of the thing that he is bound to do / cannot
nor may not excuse him / and for so much also / as the reding of the thing
that a person is bound to do and execute / except he understand it / is to
the executinge thereof no thing vailliable / but only thing i^utile / travel in
vain / and time lost. we therefore Richard by the permission and suffrance of
our lord god Bisshope of winchester / reuoluinge in our mind / that certain
devout and religiouse women being / within our Diocese and under our
pastoral charge and cure / have not only professed them to thobseruance of the
Rule of the holy co^fessoure Seinte Benet / but also be bound to read / learn
/ and understand the same when they be Nouices / and before they be professed /
And also after their profession they should not only in them self keep /
observe / execute / and practice the said rule / but also teache other their
sisters the same / i^ so much / that for the same intent / they daily read /
and cause to be red so^me perte of the said Rule by one of the said sisters /
among the^ self / as well in their Chapter house after the redi^ge of the
Martyrologe / as so^me time in their Fraitur / in time of refeccio^s and
collacio^s / all the which redinges is always don i^ the latin tongue / whereof
they have no knowledge nor vndersto^dinge / but be utterly ignorant of the same
/ whereby they do not only lose their time / but also run i^to the evident
danger and peril of the perdicion of their souls. we the said Bisshope
knowing and co^sideringe the premises / and rememberyng / that we may not
without like peril of our soul: suffer the said religious women: of whose
sowles we have the cure: to continue in their said blindness / and ignorance
of the said Rule / to the knowledge and observance whereof: they be professed /
and specially to thentent / that the young Nouices may first know and
understand the said Rule / before they profess the^ to it / So that none of
them shall mow afterward probably say / that she wyste not what she professed
/ as we know by experience / that so^me of them have said in time passed. For
these causes / and specially at thinstant request of our right dear and
well-beloved daughters in our lord Ihu^ / Thabbasses of the monasteris of
Rumsay / wharwel / Saint Mary's within the city of winchester / and the
prioresse of wintnay: our right religious diocesans / we have translated: the
said rule into our moders tongue / common / plain / round englisshe / easy
/ and ready to be understand by the said devout religiouse women / And by
cause we would not / that there should be any lack amongis them of the bokis
of this said translation / we have therefore / above and beside certain books
thereof / which we have yeuen to the said monasteris: caused it to be emprinted
by our well-beloved Richard Pynson of London pri^ter. The.xxii. day of the
Monethe of January. The year of our Lord.M.CCCCC.xvi. And the.viii. year of
the Reign of our sovereign lord king Henry the.viii. and of our translacio^
the xvi.

The rule of saint Benet.
In the name of the Trinite / Here ensues the prologue of the rule of the
black monks and minchins / made by the most religiouse fader saint Benet /
which in the begynni^ge of the said prologue says thus.


FEre and mark well my children / the precepts and commandments of our
fader and master / and diligently apply and inclyne the inward spiritual eres
of your hertes / and gladly perceive and admit the fruitful admonicio^s of
your good and louinge fader / And effectually accomplish and fullfyll the same
/ so that by the labor and virtue of obedience: ye may return and come
again to all mighty god / from whom ye were departed: and disseuered through
Idelnesse / vice / and disobedience. Unto you all therefore / my words be now
derected and spoken / what so ever ye be: that will forsake and renounce your
own wylles / sensualytes / and pleasures / and take upon you the mighty and
noble spyrituall armure of obedience / to do service to that noble and very
true king / almighty god Jesus christ. And first what so ever good purpose
or work ye begin to take upon you / ye shall before ye begin it / ask and
most instantly desire the good lord to perform / and make perfeyte your
said purpose or work / that he which has vowchedsafe to accept us / as in
the number of his chosen children / be not at any season moved / displeased /
or grieved / through our evil offenses and misdedes. For at all seasones / we
ought for the great goodness that he has showed unto us / so to bow and obey
unto him / less that he as a displeased fader: for our demerites / not only
disinheryte us as his unkind children / but also as a ferefull lord and
master? provoked by our evil deeds / co^dempne us as froward and unkind
servants to perpetual pains / because we did not our diligence to follow
him to everlasting glory. Therefore now at the last / let her arryse holy
scripture exciting us with these words / Time is now that we arrise from
sleep / and that we open our yes: to the clear light of allmighty god / so that
we may perceive and here with attentyue erys / what daily is commanded us by
the word of god saying thus. If ye this day have hard the word of almighty
god / be ye not hard nor stobborne / nor stop not the erys of your heart.
And also he says again / He that has erys to here: let him here what the
holy ghost says to all christian people / But what says he? Come ye my
children and here me / I shall teache you to dread god / Run ye and be
diligent: whiles the light of life is a monges you / less the derkenes of death
catch you / Also all mighty god / seeing his faithful people and obedient
servants and workmen: among the multitude of his people / not only cryethe
after the manner a foresaid / but also he says and demau^deth in this wise /
what man is he that will have everlasting life / and desires to see good
days? And if thou heryng these words woll answer and say / I am he.
allmyghty god then says to the again. If thou wol have true and everlasting
life: with draw and keep thy tongue from all evil / and suffer no fraud ne
dissayte pass through thy lyppes / turn the from all evil / and do that is
good / seek out and pursue peax / and follow the same. And when ye do after
this manner says allmyghty god / then shall mine yes be open and fixed upon
you / and mine erys allway ready to your prayers and peticions / and before ye
shall call upon me I shall p^uent you / and shall say / low here I am / ready
to your desires. O dear susters (says saint Benet) what thing may be to us
swetter then this voice of our savior? in the manner a foresaid / calling us to
him. Be hold susters (says seint Benet) Since almighty god of his own kyndnes
/ pity / and mere mocio^ / before we ask it: shows to us the way of life /
let us therefore array / and excercyse our selue in the faith / and in the
obserua^ce of good works / and let us take upon us: the Journey of allmyghty
god / folowinge the law and ledinge of his gosple / that we may deserve to see
him in his kyngdo^me of heaven / which has thus called us to him by his grace.
In which kyngdo^m / if we inte^de to have a restinge place / we must diligently
inforse and endeavor our self to labor in good works / without the which the
said restinge place and kyngdo^me / can not be attaygned. But then ask we all
mighty god with the prophet saying thus. Good lord who shall dwell in thy
heavenly kyngdo^me and place / or who shall make his resting place in thy holy
mount of heaven? After this interrogacion. Dear susters (says saint Benet)
let us here our lord answeringe: and shewinge to us the right way to his
heavenly mansion. He (almighty god says) shall dwell in my heavenly house /
that lives without spot of sin and does ryghtfull works. He that thinks
truly in his heart / and works no desseyte with his tongue / he that has
done none evil to his neyghbor: nor enterprysed none obprobriose sclaunderose
/ nor shameful thing to the hurt of his neyghbor. He that dispiseth and
puts out of his heart. our mortal foo the cursed find / and has utterly
brought him to naught / with all his suggestions temptacions / and entisinges /
and has brokyn and resisted them at the first monicion of them / and
steadfastly holden his inward thoughts unto christ. they that dread god and
extol not them self / ne be proud of their good religiose deeds / but
supposinge and thinkinge verily the goodness which is in them / not to be of
them self / but of the gift of god: do lawde / and magnify god for his
graciose operacion i^ them / saing with the prophet thus. Not to us good lord
/ not to us / but to thy holy name give thou praise and glory / as thapostell
Paul which did not impute any part of his p^ching and techinge to himself /
but said. By the grace of god and not of my self / I am as I am. and again he
says. He that ioyeth or seeks any laud or glory / let hi^ joy i^ god / and
give laud and glory to hi^. whereof our lord speaks thus i^ his gospel / who
so hereth these my words / and does the same in deed: I shall lyken hi^ to a
wise man that has bulded his house upon a rock. there came bitter storms /
both waters and wyndes / and brast i^to the house / and yet it fell not down /
why? for it was buelded upon a steadfast stone. Our lord which did
accomplisshe and perform all these points and conditions in his own person
/ looks daily that we shall make good / and by our works satisfye and
conform us to these his holy monicions / And therefore the days of this
present life be prolongued unto us and prorogued as a day of treuxe / for the
amendinge of our shrewde deeds / the apostell saying thus. Can thou not tell
man / that the longanimite / patience and long sufferance of almighty god / is
to induce and excyte the to repentance penance and reformacion? For our lord
says of his great mercy and pity / I will not the death of a sinner / but I
desire that he be converted and amended / and live. Now dear susters (says
seint Benet) wha^ we asked our savior of the dwellers and inhabitants of his
holy and heavenly ma^cion / we hard by and by / his precepts how we might
attaygne to it / and to deserve to dwell in it. And if we do the office of
true inhabitantis / we shall be inheritours of the kingdom of heaven /
Therefore dear sisters (sayith saint Benet) ye must make ready your hearts /
and your bodies to obey the precepts and commandments of our rule / by
virtue of obedience / And where through the fragilite of nature / and the
infirmite of our self we be insufficient and unable so to do / we shall
beseech all mighty god that his grace may be to us / aid and socoure in that
behalf / And if we woll eschew the pains of hell / and come to everlasting
life / let us then whiles we have time and laysour: and whiles we in this our
mortal body live: and may fulfill by the light of this present life / all
these forsayde p^ceptes: diligently ren and labor. and so good works do now /
that they may profit us in time to come. wherefore (says seynte Benet) we
must now orden a schole of the service of almighty god / that is to say this
p^sent rule / i^ the which ordinance (says saint Benet) we trust to put
nothing that hard is / sharp / or grievous / Albeit / if any manner of thing for
any reasonable cause / pass by our said schole and ordinance for the
redressinge of defaultes and for the co^seruacion of charity / the which thou
shalt think rigorouse or straiete / thou shall not therefore be suddenly
afraid / and for fere at a chop flee and forsake the way of everlasting life
/ saying that it cannot be entered: but with a hard and a straict beginning /
For in process of time / and by continuance of good co^uersacion / the way of
the commandments of almighty god / is by thexcellent swetnesse of his love /
and with glad heart / easily and joyfully walked / And so this schole of saint
Benet / is ordeygned to thente^t that we never departinge from christis
instructions and p^ceptis / but always perseueringe in his doctrine in
monasteris: till death come upon us / through patience and tribulacions /
bear so in us part of his passion / that finally we may deserve to be
cytezins of his kyngedom of heuyn.

Here begins the rule of our holy fader saint Benet.
The first chapter treats of.iiii. manner of monks.
IT is manifest: that there be.iiii. diverse kyndis or sects of monks. The
first is of Cenobitis / that is to say of monasteriall persons / serving god to
gedder or in co^gregacio^ / in monasteris / under oon rule: and oon abbot or
oon priour / And of this sect or kind be mynchins seruinge to gedder in
monasteres under oon rule / and oon abbasse or oon prioresse. The second manner
or sect is / of Anachorites and Eremites that is to say / of the^ which not as soon as they have takyn religion upon the^ / but by long co^tinua^ce and
proof i^ monasteris / have learned / and had experience through the comfort of
other / to fight ageynste the suggestions and temptacions of the devil / And
so well they be armed and i^structed by the good counsel of other / that they
may suerly take upon them / and be hable to fight sole and solitarily: through
the help of all mighty god / without the comfort of other: against the
temptacions of the fesche / and against all oder evil thoughts. The.iii.
kind / manner / or sect / is of Sarabites / a sect detestable: which live
not under obedience of any superior / ne under any Rule that is good and
approved / nor be tried in monasteres: as gold is by the furnace / but be more
like unto led / supple and pliable to all vicis / And fayning the^ self to
be religiose / under the simulate habit / and to^sure of religiose men / be in
all their deeds: vain / ydell / and wordly / which by.ii. to geddre / or.iii.
to gedder / or else by oon a lone / led their lives: without head or superior
/ nor in abbayes or monasteris / but where they lust / folowinge their own
appetites and desires / and taking volup tuosite for there law and reule. For
what so ever they co^iect / or choice after their own minds to be good / that
they call holy. and what is not aggreable to their appetitis / be it never so
good i^ deed / they say it is not lawful. The.iiii. kind or sect is of those
that be vagabu^des / that ren from province to province / from Cell to cell /
abiding not in son place passing.iii. or.iiii. days / ever wa^deringe / and
never stable / gyuing them self to glotony and other lusts of the flesche /
and in all their deeds be worse then the Sarabitis. Of whose most wretched
conversation: better it is not to meddle then to speak of them. wherefore (says
saint Benet) omitting and ouerpassinge them / let us through the help and
succurre of all mighty god / entende to set an ordinance and to make a Rule /
co^cerninge those monasteriall and religiose persons / of whom we spoke of
first / that is to say of the Cenobitis.

The second chapter treats of what qualites an Abbasse ought to be.
AN abbasse that may be hable and worthy to take upon her the Rule and
governance of a monastery or congregation / must all wey call to her
reme^beraunce and co^sydre the name of the dignite that she is called by / and
labor effectually that her deeds be according to her name / and in nothing
contrary to the dignite that she is called to / for she occupies the place of
almighty god: in the monastery / in somoche as she is named after him /
thapostle sainge thus. ye have received the holy ghost: by whom ye be made the
children of god / in whom we cry all to geder to almighty god / and call hi^
Abba pat / that is to say fader / of the which name all abbottes and abbasses
take their names: thabbot to be to his coue^t a fader / and thabbasse a mother /
And therefore the abbasse shall nothing ordeyne / teache / ne command (as god
forbid she should) contrary to the commandments of all mighty god / whose
rowme and authorite she has and occupies / but her commandments and
doctrines must be in such wise ordered and vttred: that they may take place /
and effectually work in the minds of her sisters and disciples / like unto
the swernes and savor of the ryghtuisnes of all mighty god. Thabbasse must
always have i^ her mind / that of her doctrine and of the obedience of her
susters and disciples / and of either of the^ to gedre / that is to say as well
of her doctrine as of their obedience: there shall be a strayte examinacio^ and
trial made in the fereful day of the last judgment. Thabbasse must know also
/ that what so ever damage / i^co^modite / lack of fruit or vtilite / our
lord findith in his sheep: that is to say in the coue^t / it shall be laid and
imputed to the charge / blame / and defaute of the sheparde / that is to say of
thabbasse / Albeit she may thereof discharge and acquit her self by this mean
and by none other / that is to say / if so be that she have don her diligence
to the trowblouse and obstinate flock / and that with all her labor she has
endeavored her self to the ame^deme^t of their evil deeds: than may she well
for her discharg and acq^tall at the day of dome / say to almighty god with the
prophet I have not hyd ne kept within my breast thy justice nor rightuisnes I
have showed and declared to them thy treweth: I have declared thy wholesome
communadementes / and they despisinge them: have set my words and doctrine at
naught. and then in conclusion / everlasting death shall be their reward and
punisshment / worthy and conueni^et to such an obstinate and disobedient
flock: not consydering nor regarding their duty as they ought to have done.
Therefore when so ever any oon takithe upon her the name of an Abbasse / she
must Rule and govern her disciples by two manner of doctrines / that is to say
/ she must show unto them good and holy things by her words and doctrine /
and more largely by example of her deeds / so that to them which have capacite
of wit to understand / she must teache and declare the commandments of
almighty god in words and doctrines / and to other that be dullardes / hard
wytted / and more simple of understanding / she must more openly and largely
show and teache the commandments of almighty god by her own deeds / For all
those things which she forbedith her disciples by her words / she must by
her own deeds show / that they ought not to be don / less that she p^chinge
and techinge other: be found reprouable in her self and less that god for
such her sins and offe^ses: say unto her in this wise. why do thou teache
my ryghtuisnes / and why takes thou upon the to utter the words of my laws
and testament thorough thy mouth. Thou haste by thy deeds hated my doctrine:
and cast far from the: my words and commandments. And thou Abbasse which
haste espied a little mote in the Iye of thy sister: haste not seen a great
block in thine own Iye. The Abbasse shall another put nor make any difference
by twene person and person in the monastery / nether she shall bear more love
to one then to a another / Except only to such / as she fyndeth better then
other in good deeds / in the observance of the Religion / in the service of god
/ and in lowly obedience. She that came of higher or noble lineage or of a fre
kynrede: shall not be p^ferrid in order of sto^dinge: or unto office / before a
another of lower birth or of a bond stock / except there be some other
reasonable cause then their birth / as excellence in any manner of virtue and
lerninge requiringe it / and if any such cause reasonable be / the^ the abbasse
according to their merits and aptnes may favor / dispose order / and prefer
/ in standinge or other wise / as she shall think right to requier /
notwithsta^dinge there diversity and condition of birth or any such other
thing / or else lat them keep their place and order. For be she bond / be
she fre / be she of noble / or ignoble blood / and lynage / all be oon in our
lord Ihu^ chiste / and under oon lord does bear equal borden of service.
For god takith no consyderacion ne regard to the person / but to the vertuose
works and merits. And makes only difference by twyxe those persons that he
fyndeth more obedient and better than other in good works. Therefore the love
and favor of thabbsse must be indifferent and equal unto all her susters /
And also oon discipline and correction must she give unto them all after their
offenses / deserts / and demerites in her doctrine / she must keep the manner
and form of thapostel where he says / blame them / exhort them / and rebuke
them / that is to say / be it time of correction or of praise and co^me^dation
/ she must ever meddle with terrors blandishementes / and with sharpness /
swetnesse / she must show the sharp mind and auctorite of a maystresse /
and the loving afeccion and tendrenes of a mother / that is to say / she must
sharply blame and rowghly rebuke wylfull unruly rude and comborous persons /
and such as be obedient / meke / pacient / and soft persons / she must in
louinge manner exhort and desire them to encrece daily more and more in their
vertuisnes / fro good to better. And such as be very negligent obstinate and
rebelliose / we woll and command that the abbasse not only sharply rebuke
them / but also effectually punisshe and correct them. Also the abbasse may
not disimyll / cloak / ne hyde the faults or offenses of them that does a
mysse / but as soon as the faults begin to spring / she shall to the
vttermoste of her power / pluck them up hard by the rotes / having always in
mind the ioperdye of Hely the priest and minister of god in Silo / which for
the negligent correction of his children / by the stroke of god fell and brake
his neck? And such persons as be of more honesty bettre capacite and
understanding / she shall warn and correct oons or twyse by words of mouth
but such as be yeuen to vices and be hard hearted / proud / and disobedient /
she shall punish at the first offense either with rod / or with other
chastisement of the body / after her discretion / according to that: that is
written / a fool can never be amended nor corrected by words. And again
punysche thy son with a rod / and thou shall deliver his soul from
everlasting death / the abbasse must allwey remember both her own frail
nature / and also consydre the name of a mother that she is called by / and
right well know / that to whom a gretter charge is committed of him or her /
so much the more fruit is demanded and required. She must understand also
how hard / and labourose a thing she has undertake / that is to say to
govern sowles / and to be have her self co^modiousely in her cures /
according to the diversity of manners and conditions of a multitude of persons
/ for so^me she must conquer with fair words / so^me with rebukes / so^me
with good reasons and exhortacons / yea. and aftur the behauoure and capacite
of every person / she must so shape and confourme her self to them all / and
ever / oon of them / that not oonly she shall not suffer any damage or
appeyringe of her flock committed unto her / but she shall so order her / that
she may have cause greatly to rejoice for thencrease of the number and goodness
of her said flock And before all things she must be well ware that she do
not dissimull or little regard the wealth of sowles / committed unto her /
settinge more her mind upon things terrestiall and tra^sitory / as works
temperall and wordlye matires / but she must always remember / that she has
take upon her the governance of christen sowles / of the whichesht shall give
accomptis. And so thente^t that she by the pretense of the poverty and
necessite of the monastery / shall not have any ^appat^^t o^ probable came to
^e busy and solicit aboutes wordly goods / taking the loss heed to the
spirituell and god^^^y sowles / let her remember that it is wrettyn. First
fe^e ye with all your force and diligence / to poursue the kyngdo^me of god /
and his justice by ryghtwose service / works / and doing to god / and all
things necessary shall be provided for you / by almighty god / without your
great labor and study / and nothing shall you lack. And again he says /
nothing is lacking to them that dread and serve god. The abbasse must know
well also that she / that has takyn upon her to guide sowles / must be all wey
ready to give and make accomptes of them. And how so ever great the number of
the systers under her cure be / let her know for certain / that at the day
of judgment / she shall answer for the sowlle of every oon of them / and for
her own also / and thus the abbasse ever having before her yes / and
continually fering the strayte examinacio^ of the master sheperd / towchinge
his flock of sheep committed to her charge / when she is so wate and ferefull
of the accomptis and rekening that she must make for other / she cannot but
diligently and warely / remember her own self. And whiles through her good
exhortacions and monicions / she ministers socour and ame^dime^t to other /
she cannot be but thereby ame^did her self.

The.iii. chapter treats / how and when the abbasse shall ask counsel of
her susters.
AS often as any matters of great weight and substance be to be treated and
spoke of / in the monastery / the abbasse must call the hole coue^t / into the
chapter house / or into so^me other place convenient / and there must she her
self declare unto them / what the matter is that is to be treated of / and when
she has herd the mind and council of every oon of her susters / she shall
then take deliberacion and counsel with her sealfe / and what thing she
iugeth more profitable to be done: that shall she do. And for this cause we
have commanded (says saint benet) that all be called to cou^sayll / For often
times to the young person god gives reuelacion what thing is best to be
done / And the susters shall so behave them in yeuinge their counsel with
all lowlynesse and humilite / that they presume not obstinatly and prowdly to
defend their own opinion / or mayntaigne that thing / which after their mind
they thought best / but rather let it hang: and remaygne in the arbytriment
and Judgment of the abbasse / so that what so ever she think best to be done /
all they therein do obey unto her. But as it is convenient for a disciple to
obey her mastresse / even so it does become the mastresse to dispose all thing
wisely and ryghtuysly. And therefore i^ every thing as well the abbasse as the
covent / indifferently ought to follow their mastresse / that is to say their
rule / which is their very mastresse / neytherony oon of them / ne the abbasse
nor other / shall folysshe hardy nor without great consyderacio^ or weyghty
cause swerve from it / but fermely and fastly hold them there to. Noon i^ the
monastrey shall follow their own will / neither any shall presume frowardly
to strive with the abbasse either within the monastery or without / and if any
oon presume so to do / let her be put to reguler discipline and correction
accordingly / And yet the abbasse shall in all her works / iugementes and
gouerna^ces / have before her yes the dread of god / and ever regard the
obserua^tes and statutes of her rule / being well assured and in no wise
dobtyng / that of all her iugeme^tes she shall give an accomptes before the
most equal judge all mighty god. But if there be to be done any matters to
wchinge a smaller substance / co^cerninge the welthe and profit of the
monastery / the abbasse shall then counseyle oonly with the head officers / and
such seniors: as has been of long continuance and experience in the monastery
according as it wreten. Do all thing with council / and then thou shaltnot
afterward repent nor be sorry of thy deed.

The.iiii. chapter treats of the instruments of good works
LIke as all worldely artificers have materyall instruments apt for the
accomplyssheme^t of their worldely works / in like wise there be instruments
spirituell / for the craft of religiose lyuinge / by the which religiose
persons / both in this p^sent life / may honestly and after the pleasure of
god be derected / composed / and ordered / and also after the same life / they
may blessedly reign with christ i^ heaven.

The first of these instruments is / that ye love your lord god with all
your heart / that is to say / applyenge all your thoughts oonly to him / and
with all your mind / that is to say applyenge all your studies / wits and
dilectacions oonly to hi^ / and with all your might / that is to say applyenge
all your bodies strenght and powars oonly to his service.

The second is that ye love your neighbor as your self / whereby it apperith
that ye shall after god / love your self / and then your neyghbor as your
self.

The.iii. is that ye sle no person / that is to say / bodily nor gostly with
hand nor tongue / And specially thou shall not slay thine own soul by any
deedly sin.

The.iiii. is that ye break not your chastity / that is to say / that ye do
no manner of aduoutrye / fornicacion / inco^tinencie nor any other sin or
uncleaness of the flesche / and in like wise ye shall do no spiritual
fornicacio^ / that is to say / ye shall worchip no falce gods nor love
inordinatly your self nor any other erthely creature.

The.v. is that ye do no theft / that is to say / ye shall not take nor use
the goods of an other frauduletly / nor without the owners will license or
asse^t / nor that ye religiose sisters take / receive / or keep any thing /
without the certain knowledge and special grant or license of the abbasse. In
like wise ye shall not withdraw any service that ye owe oonly to god / and do
it to the devil. and if ye do / ye do theft.

The.vi. is that ye coueyt not / that is to say / that ye neither coueyt /
whysshe / nor desire any person where with to do carnally any syn / nor coueyt
any man's gods fraudule^tly / nor assent to any such desire of the flesche
or goods / nor yet inordinatly desire auctorite or honor.

The.vii. is that ye shall not bear ne say any false witness whereby it is also
prohybyte making of leasynges / or false or wrongful tales / and brekynge of
any promise or vow.

The.viii. is ye shall of your humylite do reverence to all people wherein is
i^plyed that ye shall think and adiuge every person beter then your self.

The.ix. is ye shall not do to another / that ye would not should be done to
your self.

The.x. is that ye shall for sake your self: that is to say your lust /
pleasure / will / sensualite / and concupiscence to thente^t ye may i^ all your
thowghtes / words / and works / follow christ and serve hi^.

The.xi. is that ye shall chastise your body / that is to say / with reasonable

Here follows the.v. chapter which treats of thobedience of Minchins.
THe chief and principal degree of humilite is Obedience without taryeng or
delay making. This virtue agrees well and becomes those virgins / and to
them does eapperteygne / which in their love prefer no thing / before the
love of all mighty god / or to whom no thing is so dear as christ. For
either of the holy religion which they have professed / or for fere of the
bitter pains of Hell / or else for Joy of everlasting life / as soon as any
thing is them commanded by their superior to be done / euin as it were
commanded by god / they cannot nor may not make nor suffer any delay in the
performynge or executynge thereof / but incontinent and forthwith do it / even
as it were commanded of god / of which obedient persons all mighty god says
thus / as soon as she hard me: she obeyed my comaundeme^t. And again he says
to them that be techers of his laws / who so ever herith you: hereth me /
Therefore all those persons that forsake all that theyers is / renou^cinge their
own wylles / and gyuinge up anon their business / leuinge that thing
vnperfited and vnfinisshed that they had in hand / do follow the
commandments of their superior in deeds / by and by and forthwith / and as
in oon instant both those two things / that is to say the commandment of
the maistres / and the perfect deeds of the disciple / be acco^plisshed to
gydder swyftly through the dread of god: of such as has a zele and inward
desire to goo to everlasting life / for the which zele and desire / they take
upon them a narowe passage / whereof (god says) It is a narowe and a strayte
way that leedith unto everlasting life. that is to say not living after their
own will / ne being obedient to their own desires and unlawful pleasures /
but continuinge their life under the Judgment and power of a another / lyuinge
in monasteris: have a full desire that an abbasse or prioresse / have the
preemynence and rule over them / all such persons doubtless follow the
sentence of all mighty god / wherein he says I am not come to accomplish mine
own will / but his which has sent me. But this sealfe same obedience shall
then be acceptable unto god and pleasant unto other / when that thing which is
commanded is effectuosly brought to end / not ferefully / slowly / or fayntly
/ ne with grutch or denyeng nor arguinge nor resoning it / for obedience which
is showed unto superiors in religion / is showed unto god / he says him sealfe
as it is above said / who so herethe you herethe me. Moreover the disciple
must be obedient with a good and free will / for god loves him that gives a
thing with a cherefull and a merry heart / for if so be that a disciple be
obedient with an evil will / though she grutcheth not in words / yet if she
grutch inwardly in her heart / notwithstanding it / she fulfill the
commandment that is given unto her / yet is it not acceptable unto god /
which beholds and consyderyth the stomach / the heart / and mind of the
grudger. And for such a thing though she do it / she purchasyth no grace nor
thank / but rather she rennith in danger and pain of such grudgers without
she make amendis therefore.

The.vi. chapter treats of silence and soberness in words.
LEt us do as the prophet says / I have aduysid and purposed with my sealfe
to take heed of my ways / that I offe^de not with my tongue / I have put a
ward and kepinge upon my mouth / I have holden my peace / I have meked my
sealfe / and I have ceased and forborne from time to declare / that thing that
has been good. Here in shows the prophet that a man must some time cease
of good co^municacion to show the virtue of silence and sobernes in words /
much more he ought to cease of evil co^municacion / for fere of punishment
for his offenses. Therefore unto disciples all though they be perfect / we will
(says saint Benet) that syldome license be granted to speak / though it be
in good / holy and edifyenge co^municacion / for luffe of the grauite and
virtue that is in usage of few words. For it is written. in many words it is
hard to a void sin. And also in a another place it is written / death and
life hangs i^ the power of the toonge. For it becu^meth a mastresse to speak
and teache / And a disciple to keep silence and here / therefore if any things
be to be inquired / let the inquisicion be made of the superior with all
mekenes of spirit and body and with good reverence. Scoffis and Idle words
or excitynge lawghter in all places for ever we forbede and dampne (says saint
Benet) And we will not that a disciple at any season be suffered to open her
mouth to such light speech or co^municacion.

The.vii. chapter treats of humilite.
Dear susters (says saint Benet) holy scripture cries unto us with these
words. Every person that exalts him self shall be humiliate / and brought
under / And be that meketh and humbles him self: shall be exalted and brought
up. In this saying holy scripture shows unto us that every manner of a man's
own exaltation or extollence is a kind and spice of pride / of the which
thing the prophet shows him self to beware: sayng. Good lord my heart is
not exalted / nor my countenans is not high / proud / nor stately. Nether I
have reioysed nor be proud of any great art / speech / or virtue / nor I have
desired for any merueyles to be known to the people. Nor I have any thing
sought above my might. But what good lord / if I have not mekely behaved me /
but exalted my mind by pride / vain glory / or presumpcion / then let my
punishment be like unto the punishment of a lokynge child the which is
wayned and denied his moders breast / and then does perish / wherefore good
susters (says saint Benet) if our mind be to attaygne to the perfection of
high humilite / if we will swyftly come to that heavenly exaltacion / to the
which men do ascend by the virtue of humylite in this present life / that
same ladder must be rered and lift up with our deeds ascendynge / which
apered to Jacob in a vision / by the which ladder angelis were showed unto hun
descendynge and ascendinge. All which descension and ascension / without doubt
is noon notherwyse to be taken ne understand / but that men by exaltyng them
self / do discende and by humling them self they do alce^de. The ladder to
rered is our present life in this world / the which through a meke heart is
lift up by almighty god unto heaven. The sides of the same ladder / we call our
body and soul / between the which sides through the calling of all mighty
god be ordered and set diverse steps and degres of humilite and discipline as
followith.

The first degree of humilite
THe first degree or step of humilite is that a religiose person have ever
before his Ies and never forget the dread of god / and that she have also in
remembrance the commandments of all mighty god / and how the breekers of
his commandments for their offenses fall into the bitter pains of Hell /
and reuolue always in her mind the everlasting life. which is ordained for
them that dread god. And so keeping her self every hour from sin / and
vice / that is to say of thought / of tongue / of Ies / of hands / of fete and
of her own propre will / and also with all speed / keite a way the appetites
and desires of the flesh. Lat a man well suppose that he is over looked every
hour from heaven by all mighty god and that his deeds be seen of the godhed in
every place / and that angels do howerly show the deeds of man to all
mighty god. This the prophet declares unto us in that he shows / that god
is allweye present to our thoughts saying thus. God sercheth what me^ think
and what me^ delight i^. And again he says. God knows the thought of man.
Also the prophet says / Good lord thou haste understand my thoughts afar.
And the thoughts of man shall make confession and be open unto the. And to
thentent that a religiose person be very studiose and dilligent in withstondinge
evil thoughts lat her say always in her heart. Then shall I be clean and
immaculate before him when I keep me from sin and iniquite. And also in like
wise we be forbid to do our own will / by cause scripture says unto us. Be
thou contrary to thine own will. And also we make intercession to god in our
prayers / that his will be fulfilled in us. Therefore not without cause we be
taught not to do our own will / when that we take heed of that / that holy
scripture techeth us sayng / certain ways there be / which seems unto man
right good / but the end overthrows a man and brings him to the deep pytt of
hell. Moreover we be tawght in like wise / when we be ware of that is said of
negligent persons in this manner. They be corrupt and made abominable in their
desires and wylles / and for the exchuenge of the appetites of the flesh / let us believe and think that god is always so nyghe and present to us / that
they be ever opyn and manifest unto him sithen the prophet says to all mighty
god. Before the and to the is known every of my desires / Let us therefore
beware of evil lust or desire / for even right at the enter into delectacion /
stands death by dedly syn / wheruppon scripture commands saying. Follow
not thy concupiscence and deris. Therefore sens it is so that god beholds
good and evil / and ever ouerloketh from his heavenly mansion the children of
men / to see if there be any that has any understanding and seeks him. And
moreover sens it is so that our deeds be showed daily unto our maker by
angels: deputed to our custody / we must therefore dear susters (says saint
Benet) needs beware every hour / as the prophet shows us in the psalm /
that god find us not in any time geuynge our self unto that thing which is
evil / or find us mutill or unprofitable. And les that god sparynge us in
this p^sent fyfe / because he is full of pytie / and looks that we should
turn and a mende / say unto us in time to come / Thus and thus haste thou
done / and I have suffered and hold my peace.

The second degree of humilite is wha^ a religiose person luffeth not her own
will / nor delyteth to fulfill that thing that she desyrethe. But follows the
voice of all mighty god saying / I have not cum to fulfill mine own will / but
his that has sent me / that is to say gods will my fader. Moreover scripture
says after will followith pain. And after the necessite which comes of
obedience comes a crown for a reward.

The third degree of humilite / is that a reliose person / for the love of god
in every point of obedience / submit her self to her superior / Following the
steps of christ / of whom thappostell says / he was obedient unto the
Fader of heaven yea unto death.

The.iiii. degree of humilite is / when a religiose person for the virtue of
obedience / in things that be hard and contrary to her mind / yea and in
wrongs takith patience / and sufferynge / chidethe not / grudgethe not / ne
therefore turnethe her mind from her good purpose / the scripture of all
mighty god saying / who so continues to the end: he shall be sauffe / and
again have a strong heart / and suffer for all mighty god. And moreover
scripture showing / that a feythfull person ought to suffer contrariose
things and adversities for gods sake / says unto god as in the person of
the pacient / For the good lord we be punesshed with death all the day long
/ and none otherwise be we accomptyd / but as sheep be (...) to the slauthter /
and thus persistinge sure in hope of reward of almighty god / they co^sine we
Ioyfullly saying these words. yet in all these things: we have the victory
and ouerhande by him which has loved us. Moreover in a another place holy
scripture says. Good lord thou haste proved us / thou haste tried us / as
silver is tried i^ fire / thou haste brought us into danger / thou haste laid
upon our backs tribulacions / And by cause scripture would show / that we
ought to be under a superior / he co^tynuyeth sayng / thou haste ordained and
set me^ to be over our heddes. But what religiose persons fulfyllyng with
patience the co^mau^diment of god in adversities and iniurys / the which when
they be strycken upon that oon cheke / offer the other / which leave their
mantell to him / that takes away their cote / which when they be enforsed to
goo oon mile / re^neth.ii. / which with the apostell Paul suffers false
brethren and sistren which suffered persecution and blessith / or says well
of other that says evil of them / All these persons keeps this degree of
humilite.

The.v. degree of humilite is if a religiose person hyde not / but by lowly
confession show to the fader spirituell / all evil thoughts coming to the
heart / and all her sins pryuily committed. Scripture exhorting us to this
thing says. Show unto god thy life and thy demeanoure / and trust unto
him. And again he says / Make your confession unto our lord god in so much
as he is good: For his mercy is without end / and also the prophet says. I
have declared unto the my fault / and I have not hyd my iniquities: I have
said. I shall confess ageynste my self my sins to all mighty god / and
thou good lord haste forgyuen me the iniquite of my heart.

The syxth degree of humilite / is when a mynchyn is content with every vile
work / and lowest office / and with the extremite of every low degree / and
that she judge her self unworthy and unprofitable to all things that be
committed unto her / saying with the prophet. I am brought to naught and was
not ware nor knew it / I am but as abeeste toward the good lord / and yet am
I allwey with the.

The.vii. degree of humilite is / if that a mynchyn in every behalf show her
self to be inferior under all other / and more vile person than any other /
and that she do thus not only with her toonge / but also that she think it
inwardly in her heart / submittynge her self / and saying with the prophet / I
am a worm: and not a woman / the rebukynge stock of me^ / and outcaste of
people / new exalted / now put down and confounded. And also it is written /
Good it is for me good lord that thou haste brought me under / whereby I may
learn thy commandments.

The.viii. degree of humilite is / that a Mynchyn do no thing except that /
that the common reule of the monastery or else the examples of their elders and
superiors me^ of the holy doctrine and co^uersacion / byddeth or exhorts.

The.ix. degree of humilite is / wha^ a mynchyn refrayneth her toonge from
speaking / and when she keeps silence and puts not fourth nor speaks no
word / till she be questioned / holy scripture shewinge / that in much
speaking syn is hardely avoided / and that a man fulle of words: cannot be
well ordered / or keep straight way in this present lyffe.

The.x. degree of humylyte is. when a mynchyn is not light or prone to lawghter
/ for it is written / he is a fool that exalts his vice in lawghter.

The.xi. degree of humilite is: if a mynchyn / when she speaks / do speak
sofftly without lawghynge with mekenes of spirit and body / and with grauite /
few words and reasonable / and that she be no great crier / nor speak a loud
/ as it is written / A wyseman is known in few words.

The.xii. degree of humilite is: if a mynchyn show mekenes and lowlenes to
them that look upon her / not only in heart / but also in body / that is to
say / when she is i^ her labor / when she is at work / when she is in her
oratorye / when she is in prayer / when she is in monastery / i^ garden / or
wheresoever she be / sitting / walking / or stondynge she boweth down her
hedde / her yes fyxed toward the Earth. And supposing / and every hour
thinking her self to be gylte of her sins / thinks that she is presented
to the ferefull Judgment of all mighty god / saying all way as the publican of
whom is made mention in the gospel / the which his yes fyxed into the earth
said. Good lord I am not worthy to lift up mine yes toward heaven / And
ageyn with the prophet. I am bowed down: and made meke in every condition.
Now in conclusion all these degres of humimilite ascended and clymed: a
mynchyn at oons shall come to that brennynge love of god / the which love
co^mes stablyshed and made parfeyte in her / dreueth out all fere by the which
she shall begin to keep / of custom and in manner naturally / without labor
and pain / all manner of vertueux things / which she kept not before without
great pain and labor / And that not for the fear of the bitter pains of
hell / but for the love of christ / and for the same good custom and for the
delectacion of virtue / which things all mighty god shall then vouchsaue to
show in his servant puryfyed and made clean of vices and sins / thurghe the
grace of the holy gooste.

The.viii. chapter treats of the divine service by night.
IN winter that is to say / fro the first day of Nouembre unto the feste of
Easter / mynchyns must arise at the.viii. hour after it be night / that is to
say / after the son be serre / taking the same hour during all that time
as it is aforesaid. First day of Nouembre to the intent that they may take
their rest / unto somewhat after mydnyght / and then arise having natural
dygestion. And when the nocturne is ended / they shall all the resideue of the
time between that and matyns or lauds which is all oon / give them self to
redynge / some the spaulter / some lectournes / or other divine service / whereof
they have most need or wherein they be most unready. From Easter unto the
first day of Nouembre a forsayde / the hour of their waking and arysynge
shall be so ordered / that a lyttel pause made after the nocturne is ended /
wherein the mynchyns may goo to do such necessary business as nature requires
/ anon matyns or lauds shall follow / which they must be saying in the break
of the day.

The.ix. chapter treats what psalms shall be said at the nocturnes in the
winter time.
IN wi^ter after this verse Deus in adiutorium meum intend: Dn^e ad adiuuandum
me festina / followethe next and immediately. Domine labia mea aperies: and os
meum annu^ciabit laudem tuam / the which thryse song / follows this psalm
Dn^e quid multiplicati / with glia patri / and after that Venite with the
Inuitatorie must be song. Tha^ follows the hymn / and after it.vi. psalms
with their antems / the^ the versicle: which ended / theabbasse shall give the
vn^diction. And all the quere sitting i^ their stalles or setes / there shall be
red by.iii. mynchins appointed thereto.iii. lectours within book / upon the
deske or lectourne / between which lessons.iii. respo^ses must be song whereof
ii. responses shall be without glia patri. and the third with glia patri. And
when the gloria patri is begone / anon all shall arise out of their setes /
making obeyssance toward the high altar / in the worship and reverence of
the holy Trinite / The lessons which they read at the nocturne / shall be of
books as well of the old testementes as of the new / and also the expositions
of both the testamentes / which have be made of most famous doctors and
best learned in holy scripture / and most catholic faders / After
these.iii. lessons with their respondes / follows other.vi. psalms / with
alleluya / then the Chapter must be read by heart / with a versicle and
kyryeleyson / with the preces / And so ended the nocturne which we call
comunely matyns to the lauds.

The.x. chapter treats of the divine service by night in the somer time.
From Ester unto the first day of November / the quantite of the psalmodie
shall be observed / as is abouesayde / but the.iii. lessons which were wont to be
read in the book / shall by cause of the shortness of the night not be read /
but for them there shall be read / oon lesson of the old testament by heart /
without book / with the which a short respo^se shall follow / and all the
remenant shall be observed and done / as is abouesayd / And it is to understood
/ that never less then.xii. psalms shall be song at the noctourn / by sides
domine quid multiplicati and venite.

The.xi. chapter shows how the Nocturnes shall be said upon the sondayes.
Upon sondayes / the Mynchins must arise more erely to the nocturne / i^ the
which must be kept a another mesure / that is to say / the.vi. psalms shall be
song as we have a fore ordered with the versicle / and then all sittyng in
order i^ their seetes / there must be read upon the book.iiii. lessons with
their respondes / where oonly after the.iiii. responce / shall be song gloria
patri / which begone / anon all must arise with reverence making their
obeisance / After the which lessons followith by order / other.vi. psalms
with their antemes as the.vi. before did / and with a versicle. after the which
again / other.iiii. lessons must be read / with their responses / after the
order abouesayde. After the which must be song.iii. canticles of the
prophets / which the abbasse shall assign / and they shall be song with
alleluya. Then the versicle song / and the benedictio^ given by thabbasse /
other.iiii. lessons of the new testament must be read / after the manner

versicles / and canticles shall be continued as is abouesayd. At co^plen / oon
manner of psalms shall be had through out the weke / that is to say. Cum
Inuocarem. Qui habitat. and Ecce nunc. Thus a direction set of the psalmodie /
which shall be song in the service of the day time / all the residue of the
psalms of the psalter / must be equally divided into the nocturns of the.vii
nyghtes of the weke. Diuidynge always in two / those psalms which be lengeste
among other / And ordering.xii. psalms to every night / yeuynge spiritual
kowlege / that if fortune any man to be mysconte^t with this division of
psalms. Let him order them other wise / if he so think it better / so that
this be always observed and well take heed to / that every weke the psaulter
of the hole number of.C.l. psalms be song to the end. And upon Sunday at the
nocturne / that they begin at the head again. For mynchins shows them
self / to be very dull / and of small devotion / which by the co^pase of a
hole weke / syngeth less then the psaulter / with other divine service
accustumable / saying that we read that holy fathers have done valliantly and
gladly with great currage that thing in oon day / the which would god / we
of a faint currage might bring a boute in a hole weke.

The.xix. chapter treats of the doctrine of singing.
WE believe that god is every where present / that he beholds in every place /
both them that be good / and them that be evil / But specially let us then
think and believe / that it is so without any manner of doubt / when we be at
the divine service / therefore let us allway have in remembrance / that the
prophet says. Do your duty and service unto god with fere / And again. Sing
ye wisely and intentyuely. Moreover he says I shall sing unto the in the face
and sight of angels. Therefore good susters (says saint Benet) let us well
consider / how we must behave our self in the sight of all mighty god / and
of his angels. And whansoeuer we come to gydder / to sing the service of
god / let us take good head / that our mind accord to our voice / and that
they twain run both oon way / and upon oon thing.

The.xx. chapter treats of the reverence that ought to be had in prayers.
IF it so be that we intend to labor / or break any matier with a noble man /
we take nothing upon us / nor nothing presume / but with humilite and due
reverence / how much more then ought we to make our supplicacion to all
mighty god / king of all kings / and lord of all men / with all manner of
mekenes / lawly reverence / and pure devotion. And know we for certain / that
not in many words / but in clennesse of heart / and co^puncion of teres / he
will gracyousely here us. Therefore / prayer must be short and pure / except
parauenture it be be prolonghed / through the love and affection of the
Inspiracio^ of the grace of god. How be it all way in congregation / prayer
shall be short / And after a serteyne sign or token made of the prioresse /
all shall arise and goo to gyther.

The.xxi. chapter treats of the deanes of the monastery.
IF the covent / be great / we woll that certain of the susters of good
proof / and holy co^uersacion / be chosen and made deanes / which so made and
ordeigned / shall with all diligence. take charge and head / upon their
deanres / in all manner of things / that apparteyneth to the co^mau^dimentes of
god / and precepts of their abbasse. which deanes / we will be elected such
persons / among whom / the abbasse may suerly divide and distribute / part
of her office and charges / and the said Deanes / shall not be chosen by order
/ but after the deserts and merytes of their lives / and after their wise
doctrine / and good example / and if any of them inflamed with pride / be
found reproueable / if after that she be corrected / ons / twice / or thryse /
If she woll not then amend / let her be avoided / and a another succeed in her
place / which is worthy the rowme / And of them that be or deyned
prepositours / which may be called Prioresses / we make like constitucion.

The.xxii. chapter treats in what manner Mynchyns shall take their rest and
sleep.
EVerye oon of the mynchyns shall have her bed by her self alone to rest in
/ they shall take their beddinges according to the manner of their co^uersacion
/ and after the disposition and ordinance of the abbasse. And it may so be /
all shall sleep in oon dorter. If the multitude will not suffer it / then.x.
or.xx. or moo / shall rest and have their bed to geyther with certain
senioures / that may diligently look unto them. A candell shall continually
brenne in the dorter / unto it be morninge / they shall sleep i^ their clothes
/ and they shall be gyrde with thonges or with cords / and they shall have no
knyfe at their side / when they sleep / less be the mischaunce they be hurt
slepynge. And this shall Mynchyns do to thente^t / that they may al way be
ready / and that they at certain watch or token made / may rise up without any
tarcynge / and make speed / every of them to prevent other / to the service of
almighty god / yet not withsto^dynge they shall do it with all grauite and
sobernes. The younger susters shall not have their beds together / But
meddeled by twyxt the beds of their elders / they that be furste up and ready
toward the service of god. Shall make soon soft and sobre styrrynge / with the
sou^de of their mouths / or of their ete / or knocking upon the beds sides
/ to a wake them that be sluggardes.

The.xxiii. chapter treats of exco^municacion.
IF any suster be stubbern / inobedient / proud / or i^ any manner grutchynge
of things / contrary to the holy rule or else be espied and found a dispiser
of the precepts of her elders / let her be monished / according to the
commandment of all mighty god / oons or twyse / secretly of her seniours. If
she do not thereby amend / then let her have a open rebuke / before all the
covent. And if she will not so amend / and know what the pain and danger of
exco^municacion is / let her be excommunicate. But if she be rude and sturdye /
without shame or fear of god / let her be put to bodily punishment.

The.xxiiii. chapter treats of the manner of exco^municacion.
AFter the quantite of the offense / must be the mesure of eccxmunicacion and
discipline. The which manner or quantite of thoffyce / hangs in the judgment
/ and estimacion of the abbasse. But if any susters / be found in a light
offense / she shall be deprived the company of her susters / at the table. And
of her that is so deprived from the company at mete / this shall be the order /
that i^ the quere / she shall not begin psalm ne anteme / nor read any
lesson / unto the time that she have done satisfaccion for her offense / she
shall take refection of mete and drink / after her susters alone as thus. If
her susters take repaste at the.vi. hour of the day / she shall take repaste
at the.ix. hour. And if her susters at the.ix. hour / tha^ she at the
euynynge unto the time that she purchase forgyuenes / with convenient
satisfaccion.

The.xxv. chapter treats of the offenses that be most greuouse.
THat suster that is noted and taken in a more greuouse offense / shall be
suspendyd / both from the table / and from the quere. None of her susters shall
either accompany with her / or speak with her. She shall be alone at all
occupacion and work that is enjoined unto her / persevering in the weylynge
of penance / understanding the frutfull sentence of the appostle / saying
such a woman is given to the devil / as far as tocheth the destruction of her
body. that her soul may be sauffer at the day of judgment of all mighty god.
She shall ete her mete alone. in what mesure / and at what hour thabbasse woll
judge convenient / And none of her susters passing by her / shall salve or
bliss her or her mete.

The.xxvi. chapter treats of them that accompany with exco^municat persons.
IF any suster presume without the commandment of thabbasse / to accompany
her self with any excommunicate suster in any manner of wise / or to speak with
her / or else to direct any message or writing to her / let her be punished
with like pain of exco^municacion.

The.xxvii. chapter treats how the Abbasse must be diligent about the
susters excommunicate.
THe abbasse must take heed with all her diligence upon those susters which
do offense / for they that be seek and they that be hole / have need of a
phisicio^ / and therefore she must [vse all ways as a wise and an expert
Physician / to send to the offender / some aged susters as though they were her
secret friends and aydours / which shall privily confort her suster / that is
wauerynge / and styr and provoke her to do satisfaction with humilite / and so
shall they show comfort unto her / that she fall not into despair. But (as
the appostle says) charity may be in her co^fermed and establysshed / and let
all her susters pray for her. Trewly thabbasse is bound greatly to be ware /
and with all her wysdo^me and labor to take heed / less she lose any of her
sheep committed unto her cure She must well know that she has take in hand
/ the cure of feeble sowlles / and not to be as a lady over them / that be hole
and strong. And let her fere the thretnynge of the prophet / by whom all
mighty god says. That thing which ye did see hole and sownde / that ye took
and deuowred / and that that was seek and feeble / ye despised and did cast
out. And thabbasse shall also follow the piteouse example of the good
shepeherde / which leuynge.lxxx. and.xix. of his sheep / in the hills and
wilderness / went to seek his oon sheep which was wandering and strayed away
/ upon whose feebleness and disease he had so great compassion / that he
vouchyd save / to couche her upon his holy shulders. and and so to bring her
again to his flock.

The.xxviii. chapter treats of them that amend not them self after due
warnynges and monicions.
IF any suster rebuked or corrected for any manner of offense / yea and after
exco^municacion / if she do not amend / she must have a sharp correction /
that is to say / let her be punished with betynge. And if thereby she will not
amend or else perauenture (as god defend) She does leuate her self in
pride / and will also defend her deeds / tha^ shall the abbasse do like a
wise physicion / that is to say. If she have first laid unto her sople and
nurrisshynge medicynes / If she have also laid unto her the oyntementes of
good exhortacio^s / If she have laid unto her the medicynes of holy scripture /
yea and at the last / if she have added thereto the corrosyue of exco^icatio^ /
or else punisheme^t of betyng / And yet for all these espy that her labor
p^uayleth nothing / the^ let her to the said medecines add that thing / which
is more sovereign / that is to say / her own and all her susters prayers for
her / that allmyghty god / which all thing may / will vouchesafe / to mynster
health to their syke tuster / and if by these means she be not heled / Than
let thabbasse use the Instrument of abscision / as thapostle says. Cast a way
the evil from among you. And again he says. An unfruitfully person / if she
goo / let her goo / less oon scabbyd sheep do infect and poison the hole
flock.

The.xxix. chapter treats / whether that susters which have departed or be
put out of the monastery / shall be received again.
A Suster which goyth out / or be put out of the monastery thurght her own
fawte / If she will return again / furst let her promise / fully to amend the
fawte / for the which she went out / or was put out / and so let her be
received into the loweste degree / That thereby her humilite may be proved. And
if she goo out again / let her be received in like manner the third time. But
after that / Let her know well / that all returning into the monastery /
shall be denyghed unto her.

The.xxx. chapter treats how mynchins being children shall be corrected.
FOr every ayge and understanding / must be a very propre and special mesure
of correction or discipline / and therefore / damaselles or children of less
age / yea and also they that understand not how great pain of
exco^municacion is: all such when they do offend / must be punisshid with
great fasting or else be kept under / with sharp betynges / whereby they may
amend.

The.xxxi. chapter treats of the Selleresse and her office.
THe Selleresse of the monastery must be chosen oon of the covent / wise /
ripe in good manners / sobre / no great eter / not proud / not troublouse / no
rebuker / or reuiler / not slow / not prodigal. But dredynge god / which
must be to the hole covent as a mother. She shall take charge of all manner of
things / she shall nothing do / without the commandment of thabbasse / and
what so ever thabbasse ro^maundeth: that shall she fulfill / And what so ever
thabbasse co^mytteth to her custody / she shall keep it / She shall not moleste
/ anger / nor make heuye her susters / And if her suster acke of her any thing
vnresonably / she shall not despiteousely anger / or weary her / But resonablye
with good mode and meekness / she shall deny her / that asks other wise
the^ she ought to do / Let her see well to her own soul / having in mind
the words of thapostle / that she that does her dewte and service well:
purchases unto her self a good estate and degree. She must take upon her the
charge and over sight / with all her diligens of seek persons / children /
gifts / and pour people: vndersto^ding out of the doubt. that for all these /
at the day of dome she must give acco^ptes. she shall ouersee all the vessels
and vte^siles of the monastery and all the substance of the same / and so look
to the^ / even as they were they consecrate and hallowed vessels of the
Aultre: And she shall suffer nothing / though it be of little value / to goo
to waste / nor unlooked to nor neclygently left or lost / She shall not give
her self to covetousness / ne yeat be prodigal in expenses / or else a
distroyer of the substance of the monastery. But she shall al things do in
mesure / and according to the commandment of the abbasse / Above al things
she shall prefer humylite / and when she has not for to give the thing that
is asked: she shall give a fair answer / as it is written / a fair word is
more worth: than the gretteste gift that may be / All manner of things that
the abbasse has committed unto her shall have under her charge: and what so
ever thabbasse does prohibyte: that shall she not p^sume to do. She shall
deliver to her Susters / their duty of mete and drink / without any
simulacio^ / check / or grudge / and without delay / so that by her they have
no occasion to offe^de / remembrynge the saying of all mighty god / what is
she worthy to have: that gives occasion of sin / to an innocent and lowly
person. If the covent be great / she shall have help and comfort of other / by
whose socour / she shall do her duty and office committed unto her / with a
good will / without any grudgynge / that that is to be given / must be given
in a competente time / And that that is to be asked / must be in like wise /
so that no person be troubled / vexed / grieved / or made angry: in the house
of god.

The.xxxii. chapter treats of the keeping and occupyenge of the goods of
the monasterye.
AS touching the keeping / occupyeng / or ministryng of the mouable goods of
the monastery: as serrame^tes / instruments / loomes / vessels / vesture /
and all other manner of such things / thabbasse shall provide such susters /
of whose living and good manners / she stondeth in suerte of / and deliver
every thing to them / to be kept and gadered to gyder as she iuggeth to the
more profit. Of the which goods thabbasse shall keep an Inuentatory or a byll
indented: that when so ever / susters succedethe oon after a another into the
said office: she may know what she delivers / and what she receives. If
any suster handle or entreat the goods of the monastery ungoodly / or
necligently: let her be rebuked / and if she do amend / let her suffer
discipline and correction / according to the rule.

The.xxxiii. chapter treats of propriety.
PRincipally and before all other vices / this vice of propriety must be cut
out of the monastery by the root / that is to say / that no mynchyn presume
to give or receive any thing without the commandment of the abbasse / ne
have any thing propre / that is to say / by no manner of wise no manner of
thing / another book / another tables / poyntell / ne no other thing erthly /
For so much that to them it is not lefull / to have their own bodes / another
their own wylles in their own power. But they must oonly trust / to have all
manner of things necessary / of the mother of the monastery / Neither it is
leefull for them / to have any all manner of thing / which the abbasse has
not given to them / or of her certain knowledge expressly and specially has
suffered them to have. And all things must be unto them inco^mune / as it is
written / Another any of them shall call / any thing her own / or presume or
suppose any thing to be her own. And if any mynchin be espied to delight or
to have pleasure in this most cursed vice of propriete / let her be monysshed
ons or twyse / and if she do not then amend / let her be put to correction
and regularite of discipline.

The.xxxiiii. chapter shows whether every Mynchyn shall equally receive the
things that be necessary for them /
AS it is wreten division was made to every oon of the disciples and apposteles
of christ / as every of the^ had need. where we say not (as god forbed we
should) that any respect be had in the accepting of the persons. But that
co^syderacio^ be had of their necessite. wherefore she that nedethe less: let
her thank god / and be not mysco^tent / if an other have more. She that needs
more / let her submyt and humble her self for her infirmite / and be not
proud of the pity and compassion / that is showed unto her. And so shall all
the members be in rest and peace. And before all things let it be seen that
no spark of grudgynge appear in any oon of them / for any cause / in any manner
of word or toke^. And if any mynchyn be espied in this fault / let her be
subdued to more strayt punishment of discipline.

The.xxxv. chapitre treats of the wekely kychynners.
SVstres shall so do service each to other / that none be excused from
thoffice of the kychin / except it be so / that any be let / either by sekenes
or else by so^me cause of great profit / for thereby is purchased a great
reward / to them that be feeble and weked / shall be ministered help / soucour /
and comfort of other / to thentent that they do not their business / with an
evil will / but all shall have help / comfort / and socour / after as the
congregation is / and after the site and setting of the place. If the covent
be great / the abbasse shall be excused of the kychyn / and such other as we
have abouesayd / that be occupied in things of more profit. But the resideue
/ shall do service to other in love and charity. She that goth out of her
office / at the wekes end upon the saterdaye / shall make all things clean.
She shall wash the clothes with the which her susters wype their hands and
their fete / The feet of all the coue^t / as well shall she wash that gothe
out of office as she that enters i^to the office / she that goth out of office
/ shall show and deliver all the vessels and vte^syles of her office / to
the celleresse / clean and sou^de / the which / the celleresse ageyn shall
show and deliver to her that enters into the office / so that she may know /
what that she delyuereth / and what she receyuith. The seruitours by the weke
which be called hebdomadares / oon hour before the refectio^ of the coue^t /
shall take a morsel of bread / and a draught of dri^ke / be sides their duty
/ to thente^t that they may do service to their susters at meals / without
grudge and greuouse labor / yet upon sole^pne days / the said wekely
seruitours shall take patience / and abide till the last mass be done. The
said wekely seruitours / as well she that enters / as she that goth out / by
and by in the quere when matyns or lauds be ended upon the sunday / shall
prostrate them self before all their susters / desiring them to pray for
them / They that goo out of their office shall say this verse. Benedictus es
domine deus qui adiuuisti me et consolatus es me. which is thus much to say.
Blessed art thou lord god / which haste helped me and conforted me. she which
thries said / she shall receive a Benediction / and so depart. And then she
that shall enter / shall follow and say / Deus in adiutorium meum intend:
domine ad adiuuandum me festina. The which is in english. Gracyous god intend
to ward my soucoure / good lord make speed to help me. And that thries shall
be repeted of them all. And after a benediction she must enter her office.

The.xxxvi. chapter treats of syke susters.
THere must good head be taken to the susters that be seek and diseased /
before and above all thing / and as ye would do your duty and service unto
christ so shall ye unto them / for christ says. I was seek / and ye did
vysit me / and again / what so ever ye did to oon of the leeste of these my
servants / to me ye did it. But such seek susters must consider / that
service is done unto them / in the worship and honor of god. And let them
not weary their susters which minister and does service unto them / with
inportunite or demanding things superfluose / And yet such seek persons
must be forborne pacyently / For by the reasone of them / a more buntefull
reward is purchased. Therefore thabbasse must chefely take heed / that they
suffer no damage thurghe negligence / To the which susters / being seek /
there shall be deputied a certain chamber / and also oon to serve them which
is both dredynge god / and also dilligent and quycke / The use of bathes / shall
be offered unto seek susters / as often as shall be expedient / but to them that
be hole / and namely young persons / it shall be sildome granted. Also eating
of flesh / may be granted all way / to such as be seek and feeble / for
their more spedy recovery. And after that they be amended / then must they all
abstain fro flesh / as they were wont to do. The abbasse must have
asinguler cure and charge / that the seek susters be not negligently seen to /
of the celleresse and seruitours / For unto her charge it belongs what so
ever fault / offense / or negligence is done by her disciples.

The.xxxvii. chapter treats of old men and children.
Though nature of mankind of it self be prone appliant / and ready unto mercy
and compassion of these agys / that is to say of old folks / and young
children / never the less for a more suerte / by cause all persons does not
use these natural compassions / we woll that also thauctorite of these Rule
shall provide and see for them / to the intent that in no wise they lack /
and be destitute of their necessaris / wekenes of nature must be always
considered in them / and therefore they shall not be bound to the strayghtnes
of the Rule / as tochynge their fedyng / but there must be had toward them a
good consyderacion / and let them prevent the hours / lymitted by the Rule.

The.xxxviii. chapter treats of the wekely reder.
AT the table of the susters / whiles they feed: there may want no lecture.
whoo so catches a book in her hand / shall take upon her to read at all
aue^tures / But she that shall read the hole weke / must enter the sunday /
the which so entering / after mass and after she has received the blessed
sacrament of the altar / must desire all her susters to to pray for her / that
god keep her from the spirit of vain glory. And this verse shall be said in
the quere thryes of all the covent / so that she that enters / do begin it
saying. Domine labia me aperies: et os meum annunciabit laude^ tuam. which is
to say / Good lord open thou my lyppes / and my mouth shall show fourth
thy laud and praysynge / and thus after a benediction received / she shall
enter toward her lecture. And deep and profunde silence* shall be kept at the
table / so that the wysperynge or voice of no person there be hard / but
oonly of the reder. Souche things as be necessary to them that ete and drink
/ the susters shall so redely minister each to other / that none of them have
need to ask or call for any thing. And if so be they need ought / let them
ask it rather by the sound of some manner of sign or tokyn / than by any
voice / and to thentent there be noone occasion given of any evil temptacion /
none of them shall presume to talk any thing there either of the lecture / or
of any other thing / except perauenture the prioresse would breuely declare
ought / for the edyfyenge of her susters / She that redeth for the weke / shall
take a morsel of bread and a draught of drink before she begin to read /
for the more suertie of the holy communion / and less it should be a pain to
her to co^tynewe so long fasting. Afterward she shall take refection with
them that be hebdomadarys in the kychyn / and seruitours in the refectorie. The
susters shall not read nor sing indifferently by order / but oonly they that
can best to the difyenge of the hours.

The.xxxix. chapter treats of the mesure of meat.
WE think that in all months of the year.ii. diverse manners of meats be
sufficient / to the daily refection / as well at the.vi. hour of the day /
that is to say / at none upon etinge days / as at the.ix. hour / upon
fasting days / in all months of the year / and that for the diseases of
diverse persons / to the intent / that she which perauenture may not eat of
that oon / may eat of that other. Therefore two manner of meats well dressed
and seasoned / shall be sufficient to all the susters / and if any oon of the
said two meats / be appules / herbs / or pease / let them then have the
third meat / bread of a pound in wayght / shall suffice to oon of them for
a day / and that whether they take but oon refection / or else dyne and
suppe. And if they shall suppe / the third part of the same pound of bread /
shall be Reserved by the Celleresse / to be delivered to her Supper. And if the
labor of the susters be great: it shall be in the discrecion and power of the
abbasse / when it shall be expedient somewhat to increase their portion /
surfettes always set a side / that a mynchyn never fall unto indigestion
before she be ware / For nothing is more co^tagiouse and contrary to a
christen man or woman than surfeit: or dronkenes / as our lord says. Se that
your bodis be not ouercom in surfeit or dronkenes / But unto damaselles and
children young in age / the qua^tite abouesayd shall not always be kept and
mustrid but less then to them that be elder / scarcite kept in all things.
The etynge of flesh of.iiii. foted bestes must always be forborne of all
mynchins / except them always that be feeble or seek.

The.xl. chapter treats of the measure of drink.
EVerye person has a gift by him self of god / oon after oon manner / a
another aftur a another manner / And therefore the measure of meat and drink for
other persons (says saint Benet) is set an ordered by us / with some
scrupulosite and doubt. Notwithstanding we considering the wekenes of them
that be deseased / think verily / that hemma the which is nygh abowtes a mydes
in the Italion toonge / a pynte in the french / and the Englysche toonges
(which be nyghe by all oon measure) suffyseth to every person in wine for oon
day. But they to whom god grants / that they may suffer abstinence of
less drink / may well know that they shall have their reward accordyngly.
And if the necessite of the place / or great labor / or else the great hete
of summer woll require more. Let it sto^de in the will and arbytrement of the
soueraygne / regarding among all things / that repleccion or dronkenes:
under mine them not before they be ware. All though we read that wine ought
in no wise to be the drink of mynchyns / yet for as much as in our days /
that thing cannot be persuaded unto them / at the leest / let us grant and
observe this / that we drink not to our full and saciate / but scarcely and
soberly / for wine causith / yea them that be right wise for to err and goo
out of the way of good living / and the same reason tochynge soberness / is
to be understand / not oonly of wine / but also of ale / bear / and all other
drynkes / But where the poverty of the place co^pelleth / that the mesure
aforesaid cannot be had / but much less / or else nothing at all / let
them thank god that their dwell / and grouch not at it / For this we warn /
counsayll and exhort above all thing / that susters leede their live to
gydder without grutchynge.

The.xli. chapter shows at what hours the susters shall take their
refection.
FRom the holy feeste of Easter unto witsontyde / the susters shall goo to
dinner at the.vi. hour of the day which is after the English rekenyng
abowtes an hour before the mydday / and soap i^ the euynnynge. And from
witso^tyde through out all the so^mer / if the mynchyns have no labor in the
field / or if they be not trowbled with over much hete i^ so^mer / the^ upon
wednisdays and frydays they shall fast unto che.ix. hour of the day / which
is aboutes.ii. of the clock in the after none / upon other days they shall
dyne at the.vi. hour of the day / which.vi. hour if they have business in the
feelde / or else the hete of so^mer be fervent / shall be continued and kept /
also the wednesdaye and frydaye / if thabbasse so woll dispose and ordere it.
And yet in all dispensacio^s / moderacions / and lycences / the abbasse must
have such regard and consideracio^s that her sustreses sowles may be saved /
and that they shall do / may be do without grudge or murmr reasonable. From
the Idus of Septembre / unto Shrouetyde / they shall take their refeccion
at.ix. of the day / In lent till Easter they shall eat at the even time / and
eue^song shall so be doo^ / that at their meat / they shall need no light of
candel / but all shall be ended by day light. Also at all times / be it soper or
other refeccion / so shall the hour be moderate / that all things be done by
daylyght.

The.xlii. chapter shows that after complain all the Sisters shall keep
silence.
AT all seasons mynchins ought to do their devour to keep silence / and
chefly in the hours of the night. And therefore at all times / being fasting
day or etynge day / If it be etyng day / anon as they arise from soper / they
must sit all to gydder in oon place / and oon of them must read collacions /
that is to say / a book called collacions / or else Vitas patrum / er else some
other book that is apt to edify and do good to the herers. They shall not
read the books of the old law / or the books of kings / for unto them that
be feeble of vndersto^ding / it shall not be fruteful not to her that redes
scripture i^ such an hour. At other times they may be red. If it be fasting
day / the^ within a little while after that euensong is done / anon they shall
come to the lecture of the collacion / as we have said before / and.iiii.
or.v. leaves thereof read / or else as much as oon hour will permit so that
all the coue^t in the mean time may come to gydder / if any of them be then
occupied in any manner of thing / committed unto her / she must forthwith
leueof / and come to the coue^t / and so all they gaderyd to gydder in oon
shall make an end and execute co^plene. And departing srome co^plene it shall
not be lefull to any of them afterward to speak any word to any person. And
if any of them be found to have broke this Reule of silence / let her be
subdued to a strayt punishment except that necessite of gestes com upon / or
else perauenture thabbasse commits to any of the^ somewhat to be done. And yet
that same thing must be done with great grauite / moderacion and with honest
and good behauour.

The.xliii. chapter is of them that come late to the service of god and to
grace before they goo to mete.
AT the hour of divine service / anon as the sign is hatde or the bell ronge
/ all things left a part what soever shall fortune to be in hand / they must
run with all speed that may be. How be it / it must be doo^ with grauite /
so that lewd behauour / or lyghtnesse be not found among them / For
nothing shall be preferred the service of all mighty god. And if any co^m to the
nocturne in the night / after glia patri of Venite / the which psalm / we wol
(says saint Benet) shall be prolonged and song treatably allway / for the same
cause / she shall not stand in her order i^ the quere / but she must stand
last of all / or else in a place aparte which thabbasse shall ordeyne for
such slothful and negligent persons / so that she may be seen of the
abbasse or else of all the coue^t / unto the time that the service of god be
ended / she take repentance with open satisfaccio^. And therefore we have iuged
the^ to sto^de in the lowest place or else a part a side / to thente^t that
whiles they be seen of all their susters / at the leeste for very shame they
must amend. For if soche a slow person should remain without the quere /
peraue^ture such oon she might be / that would take her rest or sleep / or sit
without at large or else give head to fables therefore let noon occasion be given
to the Devil in her. But let her enter i^to the quere / to thentent that she
lose not all / and that she may make amends for the resydew. At the hours of
the day / she that comes to divine service after Deus in adiutorium / and
gloria patri of the furste psalm / which is said after Deus in adiutorium /
according to the ordenance abouesayde. Let her stand in the last place of
the quere / nether she shall presume to be accompanied with the^ that sing /
unto the time she do satisfaction / except perauenture thabbasse give license
unto her by suffra^ce / so that yeat she being guylte do satisfy therefore.
At the hour of refection she that co^methe not before grace / that they may
all to gydder say grace and pray / and that they all may goo to the table to
gydder / she that by her own negligence and fault does not so come / Let her
be rebuked therefore unto the second time. If then she do not amend. Let her
not be fussred to be at the table among them. but sequestrate and let her be
diuorcede from the company of them all / and let her ete alone / Her porcyon
of wine and other drink (except water) takyn away from her / unto the time
she do satisfaction and amend / Like punischement shall she suffer that is
not present at the grace / which is said after mete. And we woll that none
presume to take mete and drink before and after the hour limited And if any
of them resuse any thing that is offered to her / by the suffraygne / the next
time that she desires ought / she shall take that she furste refused / or else
she shall nothing have / till she make a convenient amends.

The.xliiii. chapter treats of those that be exco^municat / how they shall
do satisfaction.
SHe that for a more grievous offense is excommunicate from the quere and from
the table. when the service of god is soonge in the quere must lyghe down
before the Quere door saying nothing / but oonly being prostrate grouelynge
with her hedde towchynge the Earth at the fete of all her susters / coming out
of the queer / and that shall she do with contynuance / unto the abbasse judge
that she have done satisfaccion / which mynchyn / when by the commandment of
thabbasse / she does come into the chapter house / shall prostrate her self
before the fete of the said abbasse / and afterward at the fete of all her
susters / desiring them to pray for her. And than if thabbasse command she
shall be received i^to the quere / in what order or degree that thabbasse woll
decerne and limite / So that she presume not to begin psalm / lecturne / or
any other thing in the quere / except thabbasse give a new commandment. And
at every hour when the service of god is soonge / she shall prostrate her
self upon the earth i^ the place where she stondeth / and so shall she do
satisfaccion in the quere / till thabbasse command her to cease: they that be
excommunicate for light fautes oonly from the table / shall do fatisfaccion in
the quere / unto the time the abbasse give other commandment. This shall they
allway do till the thabbasse give them there absolution and say that it is
sufficient.

The.xlv. chapter treats of them that does amysse in the quere.
IF any mynchyn wha^ she begins a psalm / respo^de / anteme / or lectourne
/ make any fault / except by dew satissfaction / there before all her
susters she do submytte her self / let her be put to a more punishment / And
that because she would not be corrected with mekenes that: that she trespaseth
thurghe negligence. But children for such a fault must be bette.

The.xlvi. chapter treats of thoos which in any manner of other things do
offend
IF any Mynchyn whiles she is in any labor in the kychyn in the celler / in
the executinge thoffyce of a seruitoure in the bakehouse / in the garden / or
in any manner of occupacion whiles she labourythe / where so ever it be / do
ought a mysse / or break any thing / lose any thing / or else make any
excess in any manner of place / if she come not by and by before the abbasse
or the covent and of her own free will do satisfaction and show her trespase
before it be known by some other / let her be subdued to a gretter ame^des /
and if the trespass be oonly to the hurt of her own soul and secret / she
shall show it oonly to so^me wholesome and aged goostly fader / which can cure
and make hole not oonly his own offenses and sykenesse / but others also and
never disclose nor publyshe them.

The.xlvii. chapter treats of thappoyntment of the hour of divine service
IT apperteigneth to the charge of thabbasse to show the hour of the service
of all mighty god / both by day and by night. Either must she do it her
self or else commit this charge to some dyligent sustre so that all things
be ended inco^uenie^t hours. They shall begin psalms or antems every of them
except the abbasse by order / or to whom so ever the commandment be given.
There may none presume to sing or read aught / but she that may so well do
and perform it / that the herers may be the better thereby / which thing she
must do with humilite / grauite / and fere / and by the abbasse commandment
or else not.

The.xlviii. chapter speaks of daily hand labor.
Idleness is an utter and extreme enemy of the soul / and therefore certain
times susters must be occupied in labor of the hand / and certain times in
redyng godli lectours or i^ good meditacio^s And therefore we think both the
said times in this wise to be well ordered / that is to say that from Easter
unto the Kale^das of October in the morninge fro the first hour of the day
unto almost the.iiii. of the day let them labor about such things as be
necessary. And from the.iiii. hour of the day / unto almost the syxte hour /
they must give them self to redynge. Aftur the.vi. hour rysynge from the
table / they shall rest a wyle in their beds / with all silence / or else if
she woll give her self to reding / let her so read softli by her self / that
she trouble none other. And the hour of none must be executed at the half
hour before the.viii. hour of the day. And then again what so ever is best
to be done / let them labor in it unto euynsonge time. And if the necessite
of the place or else pouerte compels that they must be occupied them self
/ about the gatheringe in of Corn / they may not take it heuely nor be grieved
there with / for than they be very true mynchins / when they live with the
labor of their own hands / as did our faders and the appostles /
notwithstondynge all things shall be be done in measure and with discrecion /
because of them that be feeble and weke in body or spirit. From the kale^das
of October unto shrouetyde / they shall give them self unto redynge / till
the second hour of the day be full. And at the second hour of the day they
shall execute the third hour. And then unto the.ix. hour of the day every of
them shall labor about her business / which is enjoined unto her. Than the
first sign of the.ix. hour stricken / every oon of them shall depart from
her work / that they may be ready / when the.ii. sign stryketh. And after they
have dyned / they shall give some to redynge of lessons / and some to redynge of
psalms. In the days of lent from the morning unto the third hour of the
day / full they must give them self to redynge / and from that time till
the.x. hour of the day full / they must labor in such occupacion as is
committed unto them / in the which days of lent / every of them shall have
by her self a book out of the lybrary which book she shall read from the
beginning to the endinge by order. and the same books must be delivered unto
them at shrouetyde / Before all thyngys oon or two sustres of the eldest i^ the
religion shall be deputed which shall goo about the monastery at all soche times
and seasons as there susters be at there redinge / and ouersee them less
perauenture some suster be found slothful / which gives her self to idleness
and telling of tales / and is not myndyd toward redyng. And so is not oonly
unprofitable to her self / but also she disturbeth and lets other / Such
oon if she (as god forbede) be found / let her be rebuked ones and the second
time if she do not so amend / let her be submitted to correccio^ regular / in
such wise as other by her may have cause to be effrayde. Nether oon suster
shall accompany her self with a another / but in hours and times convenient.
Upon the sunday they shall all give the^ self to redinge / except those which
be deputed to diverse offices. And if any of them be so neglygent and slowthfull
/ that she will not / or else she cannot give her self to meditacion or to
redynge / let some manner of business be enjoined unto her / to thentent that she
be not idle / The susters that be feeble / or else be tender / or have be
delicatly brought up / to them such occupacion or business shall be committed /
that nether they be idle / ne yeat oppressed with over much labor / where
through they should forsake the monastery / which wekenes and tendrenesse
must be co^sydered by thabbasse after her discrecio^.

The.xlix. chapter treats of the observing of lent.
THough at all times a mynchin in her lyuinge ought to keep the obserua^ce of
le^t / yet i^ so much as that virtue of that continual observance is but i^
few persons / therefore we counsel that they keep their life in the days of
lent / with all cle^nesse / that is to say / that they in those holy days /
cleanse and wash clean away / all their necligences of other times paste. The
which is the^ done acceptably / as it ought to be / when they keep their Self
from all manner of vices and give their diligence to prayer with weeping / to
reding / to co^punction of heart / and to abstinence. Therefore in those days
of lent / let us increase some thing in our self / over and above the duty of
our custumeable service / which we were wont to do / and pray at other times /
that is to say / addinge special and pryuate prayers / with more abstinence of
mete and drink. And let every oon in those days of le^t offer unto god of her
own fre will / with gostly Joy / some thing above her custumable service or
duty / and above the measure to her commanded / that is to say / let her
withdraw from her body / somewhat of meat and drink / of sleep / of speaking
/ of skoffynge / and tryfelinge / and with Joy of a spirytuall desire / let her
long for the feste of Easter. How be it that self thing that any of them
does above her custumable deuty / she must show it to her abbasse. And with
her will and prayer it must be done / For what so ever be done without the
will and leave of her spiritual mother / shall be accounted presumpcion and vain
glory / and to no reward. Therefore all thing must be done with the will of
the abbasse.

The.l. chapter speaks of susters that labourth far from the quere.
SVsters which be far fro the monastery or oratory in labor / and may not
com to the quere in a convenient hour / if thabbassed do perceive it so to be
of trewthe / let them the^ there do their dewty unto god / where as they
labor / with goodlye dread and fere / knelynge upon their knees / Also the
hours of gods service accustumed and appointed / may not be forget of them
that be sent forth in journeys / But as much as they may / they must do their
dyuyne service and negligent / not to pay the duty of their service in dew and
convenient times.

The.li. chapter speaks of susters which goith forth / but no far Journey.
SVsters that goith forth in any manner of messayge / and trust to return to
the monastery the same day / shall not presume ne take upon them to eat
without the monastery / all though they be desired of any person / except
perauenture they have a commandment of thabbasse / And if they do other wise
/ let them be excommunicate.

The.lii. chapter treats of the quere of the monastery.
THe oratory / which is as much to say as the place of prayr must be in deed
and in effect as it is called / that is to say that nothing erthly may there
be done / laid / or left / that does not apperteygne to the service of god.
when the service of god is ended / all the covent must goo out with silence /
and do reverence unto god / to thentent that a suster / which perauenture woll
bid su^me peculier or special prayers of her pryuate devotion / be not let
thorough the ungoodly be hauoure of a another / and if so be that a another also
would pray secretly by her self / let her com in with all silence / and pray
not with a loud voice / but with teres and full intencion and entirenesse of
heart. Therefore she that occupies not her self about souche business of
prayers and meditacions / may not be suffered / after the service of god is done
/ to make any taryenge in the oratory / as is abouesayde / less that a another
suffer impediment by her.

The.liii. chapter treats of hospitalite and the manner of receyuinge of
gestes.
THe.liii. chapter treats oonly of hospitalite / and of the receyuinge and
charytable entertaynynge of gestes and pylgrimes / which for many
i^co^uenientes that might there upon ensue / specially by much co^uersacion
with men cannot conveniently nor without great peril of sowles be executed nor
performed among mynchins / after the form expressed i^ the same chapit /
Nevertheless to thente^t that they may know the devout and charitable manner
of hospitalyte / and the receyuinge of gestes that monks be bounden to. And
that no part of saint Benettes rule be by us conceyled or hid for them / we
have therefore translate the said chapter applyenge it to the monks oonly /
according to the original text as follows / without any mention maki^ge of
mi^chi^s / sei^ge that they cannot co^uenie^tly as a boue is said observe it.

ALl gestes and estraungers coming to the monastery shall be received in like
manner as christ should be / for he shall say I was a geste / and ye received me
/ And to all manner of people deue reverence shall be showed / how be it
chefely to men of our own faith or religion / and peregrines / Therefore as soon as it is showed that a geste is come / the soueraygne or such oon as
has the office of the hospitular must goo against him with the show and a
demonstracion of all cherfull and charytable manner / And furste of all / let
them goo into the oratory and pray to gydder / and then salute them self with
the kiss of peace / which kiss shalnot be offered / except they have first
prayed to gydder / for excheuinge of illusio^s that comes of the devil / In
that same salutacio^ all humilite must be showed. when gestes com and goo /
christ which is received in them / must be worshipped in them / with
submission of the head / or else with prostracion of all the body / upon the
earth. Gestes ones received must be brought unto prayer / and afterward let the
soueraygne sit with them / or else such a brother whom the soueraygne will
command. The law of all mighty god shall be read before the same geste / for
gostely edificacion / and after that let the geste have all the chere that may
be. The soueraygne shall break his fast for a strangers sake / except it be
so great a day of fast that it may not be broken / that is to say a fast
vowed / or commanded by the church / but the remena^t of the brethren shall
prosequte and continewe the custom of fasting. Thabbot shall give water to the
estrangers hands. And as well the Abbot as all the hole covent shall wash the
fete of the gestes and estraungers / which done they shall say this verse /
Suscepimus deus misericordia^ tua^ in medio templi tui / that is to say. Lord
god we have received thy mercy i^ the mids of thy temple. The receyuinge of
pore people and peregrines must principally with all diligence be regarded /
for in them more than in other christ is received / for as for rich men / the
fere and dread of them requires of force / honor and reverence to be do
unto them. The kychin of thabbot and of gestes which is all oon / shall be
disseuered fro the covent kechin to thentent that gestes coming upon at
uncertain hours / which never fails in a monastery / shall not trowble the
brethren of the coue^t. Into the which kychin.ii. brethren shall enter for a
year / which can and may well do that office. To whom after as need shall
reqre: there shall be ministered solace and succurre of other / so that they may
do their service without grudge. And again when they have less to do in the
kychin / then let them goo to such business as is commanded unto them / and
not only in this office of the kitchen but also in all other offices of the
monasterye this consyderacion must be had / that when they need solace and
help they must have it / and again when they have nothing to do in their
offices: they must obey their superior in that he woll else command. And
also a brother whose soul dredeth god singularly / must have a house assigned
to hi^ / to receive gestes i^to / wherein shall be beds made sufficiently /
and the house of all mighty god / that is to say the house assigned for
hospitalite must be wisely ordered by wise persons. But no Brother in no manner
of wise shall accompanye him self / or hold co^municacion wit a geste /
except he have license / or be commanded / And if he mete and se any gestes or
estraungers / a salutacion mekely (as is above said) given unto them and
blessinge desired / be shall pass by / saying that it is not lefull for him /
to speak with a geste or a stranger.

The.liiii. chapter shows that a mynchin ought not to receive letters or
tokyns.
IN no wise it shall be lawful to a minchin to receive letters / tokens / or
any other small gifts from fader other or mother / or from any person / or
else oon of the^ from a another among them self / nether to se^de any such
things without the leave and also the commandment of thabbasse. And if any
manner of thing be sent unto a mynchi^ from her fader or mother / she shall not
take upon her self to receive it / except it be showed to the abbasse before /
And if the abbasse command that it be received / it shall be in thabbasse
power to whom she will command the said minchin / after that she has it so
received to give or deliver it. And the suster to whom that thing was sent /
shall not be therewith misco^tent / less the devil have thereby occasion
toward her / and she that presume the otherwise than thus / shall be
submitted to reguler discipline.

The.lv. chapter treats of the raiment of the mynchins and the houses of
office belongyng to the same.
Garments and clothinge shall be given unto the susters / after the qualite of
the place where they dwell / or after the temperatnes of the air / For in
cold regyons is more need / in hot regions less need / And thus
consyderacion rests oonly in thabbasse. And as for the color or cursnes of
the clothe / and of all other apparel ganerally / the minshins shall not
grudge nor compain / but be content with such cloth as may be gotten i^ the
proui^ce or country / where they dwell and with that cloth that is courseste /
and that may be bought best chepe. Thabbasse shall se for the mesure of their
garments / that they be not to short for the werers / but meserable. They that
take new garments / shall deliver always their old by and by / to be put in
the vestiarye for pore people. It is sufficient for a mynchi^ to have two
grarme^tes of every sort / by cause of nyghtes and for washing of the same /
And what so ever and above the said two garments that is superfluous and
must be take away. Also shoos and what so ever other old thing there be /
they shall deliver them when they receive new / as touching their Bedstuffe /
a mat / a stamyn / a couerlet / and a bolster be sufficient. The which beds
must be often times serched of thabbasse / less the mynchins take or keep any
thing / that thabbasse is not priuey unto / And if ought be found with any of
them / that she has not received of the abbasse / let her be submitted to the
most grievous discipline. And to the intent that this vice of propriete may be
plucked up by the rote / all things necessary must be given by thabbasse to
the minchins / as well garments / books / and instruments for their craft
and occupacio^s / so that all excuses of necessite may be taken away. yet the
same abbasse must always consider the sentence of thactes of the appostels that
distribucion was made to every oon of them / as necessite required. And
therefore the abbasse must consider the infirmytes of them that lacks / and
not the evil will of them that be enuyous / How be it in all her iugeme^tes
/ let her well think / That after her deeds she shall be again rewarded of
almighty god. Other things there be in this chapter / concerning the
garments of monks / which by cause they be not mete nor convenient / for
women we have in this our translacion made no mention of them.

The.lvi. chapter treats of the table of thabbasse.
THabbasse must allway have at her table peregines and gestes / how be it as
often as there is no gestes / thabbasse may call unto her whom she lust of
her susters / but she shall ever take heed / that oon or too of the eldeste in
the religion / be left with the sufters for their discipline.

The.lvii. chapter treath of the artificers of the monastery.
IF there be any artificers in the monasterye / they shall do their occupacion
with all humilite / so that they have first the commandment or leave of the
abbasse / And if any of them be proud for the conninge of the craft that she
has before a another / because she semith to do soom profit to the monastery
above other / such oon must be withdrawn and sequestered from that craft /
and shall not goo to it again / except thabbasse command her after that she
has meked and submitted her self / If any things of the warbes of
thartificers be to be sold: they that shall have the sale / must se wisely /
and beware that there be no fraud / nether in the worker / nor in the seller /
nor no fraud do to the monastery. And let them all way remember Ananie and
Sapphire / less perauenture they and all other / which do any deceyte in the
goods of the monastery / suffer like death in their sowles / as the foresaid
Ananie and Sapphire suffered in their bodies / that is to say sodeyne death. In
the prices of all such stuff / the sin of courtouse must utterly be
exchued / and therefore let it be sold somewhat better chepe / than it should
have be of secular persons / to thentent that god may be glorified in all
things.

The.lviii. chapter treats of the manner and form of the receyuinge of
susters into the monastery.
When any person commethe newly to conuersyon toward religigio^ / her
entering shall not be lightly granted to her but as the appostell says /
take ye a good proof / whether her inward intent and desire / com of god or
not. And therefore if such oon coming / do persevere in her desire / and be
perceived to suffer pacyently iniurys said and done unto her / and to be
contented with the difficulty that is made for her entringe by the space
of.iiii. or.v. days / and that she stand steadfast in her peticion / let her
be admitted to enter / and then let her be in the gesten chamber a few days /
and afterward let her be in the chamber of the nouices / where she shall
co^tynewe in meditacion / and there eat and drink. And such an aged suster
shall be deputed unto her which is an apt person to win sowles / which shall
tenderly and diligently take heed upon her / and apply her self to
understood / if she seek god verily without feyning / and wether she be
diligently gyuin to the service of all mighty god / to obedience / and to abide
and suffer rebukes. Hard things and sharp things must be declared unto her
/ by the which men goo unto god / and if she promise to co^tinewe in her
stedfastnes / the^ after tow months be passed / let this rule be read unto
her by order / and these words say unto her. Behold and look / This is the
law under the which thou wylt continewe and do service / If so be thou
may keep it: enter / If thou may not / goo thy way wyles thou art fre.
And if she contynewe still / Then let her be brought into the forsayde
chamber of Nouices / And again let her be proved in all patience. And aftur
the space of.vi. months let the Rule be read unto her again / That she may
well know whereto she entrethe. And if she stand yeat in her purpose by the
space of other.iiii. months / then after the same.iiii. months / let this
same rule be read unto her again / And if that she taking with her self a
delyberacio^ / will promise / that she will keep all manner of things in the
rule / and observe all things commanded of her superior / then let her be
received into the covent / knowing for certain / that it is ordained by the
law of the rule / that it may not be lefull for her fro that day forth ward
/ to goo out of the monastery / nor to cast the yoke of the rule from her
neck / nor pluck her neck out of the yoke of the Rule / which with so
long a visement she might before have refused / when she shall be reseyued /
she must in the quere / in the presence of all the covent / make a promise of
her stabilite / and of the co^uersacion of her manners / and obedience / before
god and his saints after the said rule / to thentent that at any season when
she do otherwise / she may well know her self to be dampened of allmyghty god
/ whom she mocketh / and scorneth / of the which her promise she must make a
wrytinge to the name of the saint / whose relequys there restith / and to the
name of thabbasse there being p^sent / The which writing she shall wryght
with her own hand / or else if she be not learned thereto / some other at her
desire shall write it / and she shall sign it / and with her hand ley it
upon the altar / and therewith begin this verse Suscipe me dn^e secundu^
eloquiu^ tuu^ et viua^: et ne confu^das me ab expectatione mea / that is to
say. Good lord receive me after thine own word / and grant me to live in
the / and put me not abacke from that that I look for and trust unto / which
verse all the coue^t must repete thries / adding to it Gloria patri. Then she
must prostrate her self to the fete of every mynchyn / and desire them to
pray for her / And from that day forth she must be accounted as oon of the
covent. Goods if she have any / either let her before her profession
distribute them to power people / or else let her by solemn and open grant
/ give them to the monastery / reseruinge nothing to her self thereof at all /
for from that day forth / she must well know / that she shall have no power
of so much / as of her own body / Therefore anon in the quere: let her be
put out of her own apperell / with the which she is clothed / and do on the
clothes of the monastery. But the garments which she is put out of / must be
kept in the vestiarye / that if in any time / through the intysynge of the
devil / she consent to goo out of the monasterye (as god forbede she should)
then doing of the clothes of the monastery / let her be cast out in her old
array / how be it that writing which thabbasse received upon the altar:
she shall not receive again / but it must be kept still in the monastery.

The.lix. Chapter treats of the children of noble men and pour men.
IF it forfune any noble man to offer his daughter unto god in the monastery /
if that child be within laufull ayge. Her fader and mother shall make the
writynge which we have declared before. And with their oblacio^ they shall
wrappe the said wrytinge / and the hand of the child in the alter clothe /
and in that manner of wise must they offer their child. And as for their
goods / they shall promise in the same wrytinge with an oath / that nether by
them self nor by any other person / nor by no manner of way / nor at any time /
they shall any thing give to their said child / nor give occasion that she
shall any thing have. Or truly if they will not do thus / but they woll in any
wise somewhat give unto the monastery in alms for their own soul health / let
them make a grant thereof unto the monastery / reserving to them self (if
they so woll) the use and profit thereof during their lives. And so every way
must be stopped that no suspeccion of propriete remain to the child / by the
which she deceyuyd (as god forbede) might peryshe / which thing we have
learned by experience. And in like manner shall pouer men do for offering of
their children. But they that have nothing at all / let them make their
writing without grant of any thing. And let them offer their daughter with
their oblacion before wytnes.

The.lx. chapter treats of seculer prestes that desire to enter into
religion in any monastery.
ALbeit that this.lx. chapter nor no part thereof may touch or concern the
congregation of Mynchins / yet for the cause above rehearsed i^ the other
chapiters of this rule not towchynge them / and specially for the instruction
of some monks meynly lettered / we have translated the said.lx. chapter i^
form following. If any preeste desire to be received and takyn into the
monastery / it shall not be lightly at the first desire granted to him. How
be it if he continually persiste in this his desire and supplicacio^ / let him
know and be well assured / to be bound to observe all the strayctnes of the
rule / and that no manner of thing shall be to him thereof released / according to
the scripture. Friend or brother wherefore ca^me thou? Nevertheless: he may be
licenced to stand in order aftur the abbot / and to give benediction / and to
sing mass / if so be that thabbot so command. And else being not
commanded / let him in no wise presume any thing above a another brother. But
let him ever remember that he is subject and bound to reguler observance / and
by the reason of his order / let him the rather give all other example of all
mekenes and humylite / and if he be the cause of any good ordinance or order
of any other good thing in the monastery / let him ever regard that place and
degree that he entered into / when he ca^me first into the monastery / and not
that place nor degree which for the reverence of presthod to him was granted.
And also if any clarke not priest of like desire / covet to be accept and
associat i^to the monastery / let him be set in ameyne place / so that first
he promise thobseruacion of the rule and his stabilite in the same.

The.lxi. chapter treats of mynchyns Strangers.
IF a mynchin estraunger come from fer country / if she will abide in the
monastery as a geste / and be content with the custom of the place as she
fyndeth / and with her excess or superfluite trouble not the monastery / but
utterly be content what so ever she find / let her then be received for as
long time as she desires / If she with reason / charity and mekenes rebuke /
or find in any defaulte in any thing that is a mysse in the monastery /
thabbasse must handle and treat the matter wisely / For perauenture all mighty
god has sent the same person thydder to that intent. And if afterward the
said mynchin wol stablyshe her self there / her will shall not be refused /
especially for as much as in the time that she has been there as a geste /
her life might well have be known / and if she be found wastfull or vicious
in the time that she is there as a geste / then not alonly she must not be
associate to the body of the monastery / but also it must be honestly said
unto her that she depart / less thoroughe her wrechednes other be made the
werse / And if she be not such oon as is worthy to be put out / then not
oonlye if she desire it / she shall be received and associate to the covent /
but also she shall be desired to bide and co^tinewe there / to thentent that by
her virtues / other may take example / or by her good example other may the
better be instructed. And in as much as in every place / we do service to oon
lord and to oon king it is lefull for thabbasse to set her somewhat i^ a
higher place / if she perceive that she be a person worthy thereto. The abbasse
must beware always that she take not at any time a mynchin to continewe in her
monasterye which is of an other known monastery / with the consent of
thabbasse of the same / or else her letters of co^mendacon / For it is written
that that thou will not have done to thy self / do not thou to a another.

The.lxii. chapter treats of monks promoted to presthod after their
profession in the monastery.
IF any abbot have need of a priest or deaco^ let the^ chese oon of his own
monks / which maybe worthy to take upon him and use that order / the which
brother after that he be ordered / let him beware of all elacion and pride / and
let him not presume to do no thing / but such as shall be commanded by thabbot
being well assured that for the dignite of his order / he is the more bound
unto regular life and co^uersacion. And also let him take heed / that by the
occasion of his presthod / he forget not the obbedience and discipline of the
rule / but rather more and more increase and profit in virtues and good
living toward god. But let him all way (except when he ministrethe in the
auter) regard and remember that place and rome that he was in / when he entered
the monastery / and if perauenture the abbot and the covent / by oon assent for
his great virtues and the merits of his life / will promote and exalte him
above his seniors / yet let him know and consider that he is never the less
bound to keep and observe the rule and precepts ordained and assigned by the
Deanes or suffraygnes / and if he woll otherwise presume then let him be Iugged
/ estimed / and reputed / not a priest / but a rebel / And if he after sondray
monicions woll not reform him self / than let the bishop of the diocese have
knowelege thereof / And if he will not amend by the bishop / then his offenses
being manifest and open / let him be eiect and expelled out of the monastery
/ specially if his co^tumacye and rebellion be such that he woll not obey ne
be subject to the rule. This the.lxii. chapter in like wise towcheth not in
any thing the congregation of mynchins / yet for like cause as we did the
other chapiters above rehearsed / we have translate and insert it among the
rules of the same mynchins.

The.lxiii. chapter speaks of the order of the coue^t.
MInchins shall keep and co^tinewe their order and degree in the monastery / as
the time of their conversion and the deserving and merits of their lyuinge /
does require / and as the abbasse will deserne and order / allbeit as thabbasse
must be so discrete and circu^specte / that she in that behalf trowble not to
the flock committed unto her. Nor She may not / as she had an absolute power
and fre will over her susteres / order or dispose any thing wrongfullye. But
she must remember always that of all her iugementes and deeds / she must give
accomptis to all mighty god. Therefore according to the order that thabbasse
does / or else to that / that the susters have the^ self by order of their
co^uersio^ and profession so they shall com to the paxe / and to receive their
maker / to begin a psalm / and to sto^de in the quere / And ever in all places
i^ order keeping / there shall no regard had to age of years / nor ayge of
years shall be prejudicial to the younger being elder in conversion or
profession / For Samuel and Damuell being but children in ayge / gave
judgment upon them that were their seniors. Therefore except oonly them the
which of a great auiseme^t thabbasse has preferred / or else degraded and
put back for certain causes / al other as they come into the religion / so
shall they be in order as thus. She that comes into the monasterye at.ii. of
the clock of the day / must know that she is Junior to her that came at on
of the clock / what so ever ayge or dignite she be of. And the young mynchins
in all things must be kept in discipline and fere of all their susters. The
younger must do reverence to the elder and the elder must love the younger / In
their calling or spekyng oon to an other / It is not lefull for any / to name
another by her propre name / but the elders call their Iuniors susters / the
Iuniors shall call the elders Dompnas / which is to say dames a name of
reverence and suffrage^tly / Thabbasse sto^deth in christ's stead and shall be
called Madame and abbasse / and this name she has not of her own presu^pcion
and usurpation / but for the honor and love of christ / She must remember and
consider / and so behave her self / that she be worthy such honor /
whersoeuer susters mete / the yo^ger shall ask blessi^ge of the elder / If the
elder pass by the younger / the yo^ger shall arise / and give her place to sit.
The yo^ger shall not p^sume to sit down except her elder command her / to
thente^t that it may be acco^plyshed and fulfilled among them / that is
written by thapostell / every oon preuentinge an other in doing reverence.
young children and damaselles in the quere and at the table must take and keep
their places / under fere and dread / And without the quere and fro the table
and else where they must be kept under tutell and governance of their seniors
thereto assigned / unto the time that they com to the ayge of understanding /
and discrecion.

The.lxiiii. chapter treats of the eleccio^ of thabbasse.
IN the ordinance and making of thabbasse this consyderacion must allway be
had / that is to say / that she be made Abbasse / whom all the hole covent in
the fere of god / or a part of them / though it be but small / being of
better counsel and zele then the more part is / woll chose. She that shall be
abbasse must be chosen for the deserte and merits of her life / her doctrine
and wisdom / yea and though she be to weste in degree of all the coue^t. And if
all the coue^t be given to vices of oon assent (as god forbede) chose a person
which they think will concent and conform her to their vices / and so to to
be of like mind in live unto them / if those vices in any wise com to the
knowledge of the Bishop / to whose diocesses that place belongs / or else
be evident to abbasses or other of their neighbors / christen men they shall
prohibyte and let the co^ce^t of such evil religiose persons to take any
effect. and they shall set and ordeyne oon / that is worthy to have the
dispe^socio^ and administracio^ of the house of god / knowing well that for
the sittynge a part of an unable person / and prouidynge an hable / person /
they shall receive a good reward if they do it of pure mind / and for the
love of god / As contrarywyse / it is great syn if they be negligent / and se
not thereto. But it is to be remembered that this manner of election was made by
saint benet / before the ordinance of the se apostolyq^ which now be to be
observed and p^ferred to his institucio^ of saint benet. Thabbasse ones
ordained / must always remember what charge she has take upon her / and to
who^ she must give acco^ptes of her villicacio^ and dispe^sacion. She must also
well know that it is her duty / more to do good and profit / than to have
pre-eminence. Therefore she must be well learned in the laws of god and her
religion / and that she understand and be that person that can she we and
teache the laws / rules / and co^stitucions of the religion with such histores
of holy scripture and seyntes lives as be most expedient for the congregation.
She must be chaste / sober / merciful / and meke / and ever in all her works
/ let her extol a exalte mercy and equite above Justice and seuerite / to
thentent that she may purchase that same her self. Let her hate vice / and
love her susters / and in her correction she must deal wisely that it excede
not / less whiles she coueyteth ouersore / to rub a way the ruste / the
vessel break / She must all way consider her own fragilite / and remember /
that a read all though it be somewhat bruzed. yet it is not to be utterly broken
and destroyed. But by these sayings / we do not mean nor entende that she
suffer vices to grow / but wisely and with charity she shall cut them a way as
she sethe to every of her susters to be expedient / as we have a forsayde / and
she must covet and effectually labor more to be loved of her susters than to
be dradde. She shall not be full of hastines / trowbelowse / ne of sour mode /
or displaysant countenance / she shall not be importune or intolerable nor
obstinate nor self wylled / she shall not be i^tangled with ielosy / nor be to
much suspiciose / for such a person is never in quietness / nor never takyth
rest. In her commandments she must be wise / provident / and circumspect.
And all such labor or occupacion / as she shall enjoin to any of her susters
/ be it that it concern the service of god / or the business of the world /
she must have good discrecion and moderacio^ / calling to her mind / the
discrecion of holy Jacob saying. If I cause my flock to ouerlabour them self
/ they all shall dye in oon day. Therefore taking these witnesses / and other
moo examples of discrecion / mother of virtues / she shall so moderate all
things / that strong persons shall desire to do the said labors and
occupacions / and weke persons shall not refuse them. And specially she must
regard / that in all points she observe this present rule / to thente^t that
for her good adnu^stracion / she may here of almighty god / that the good
seruante hard / which distributed the corn to his fellows i^ time / I tell
you troth (says the gospel) God shall for his dispensacion in few things /
commit unto him the ouersyght of all his goods.

The.lxv. chapter she with of the proueste or priores of the monastery.
OFten times truly it happens / that through the making of a prouest or a
prioresse / grievous sclaunders and occasioons of inconuenientes be raised in
monasterys / for whiles there be some inflate with the cursed spirit of pride /
supposinge them self to be second abbasses / taking upon them cruel
ladyship / they noryshe slanders / and make dyscencions and debates in the
covent / and princypally in those places / where the prioresse is made of the
same bysshope / or of the same prelate which made thabbasse / which thing
how far out of reason it is / a man may sone perceive / for even from the
beginning of her making and orderyng / and occasion is given unto her to be
proud / whiles her own mind does make suggestion unto her / that she is
clean delivered / from the power of her Abbasse / by cause she was made
prioresse of him / that thabbasse was made of. Thereof be raised Inuies /
wrothes / strives / backbytinges / hatredes / dissencions / making and
marrynge / discordes and discorders / And whiles thabbasse and the prioresse be
of contrary minds / it follows necessaryly / that whiles this dissencio^
hangs there two sowlles must be in Ioperdy / And also they that be under
tha^ / whiles they flater the parties / do rynne unto utter perdicio^ and
dampnacio^ / Of the which iuperdie the mischefe pri^cypally towcheth the^ /
which were the causers / ayders / and procurators or assiste^cz / of the making
of the said prioresse. And therefore we se before our Ien that it is expedient
for the consernacion of pease and cheryte within the monastery / that the
ordinance of all thofficers of the monastery / hang in the will and
disposicion of the abbasse / And if it may be let all the profit / vtile /
charges / and administracions of the monastery / be ordered as we have
abouesayde / by the deanes such as the abbasse woll assign / and not by a
prioresse. For whiles the charge is committed to diverse persons / oon person
shall not fall into pride. And if the place reqer to have a prioresse / or
else the covent desire it resonably / with humilite / and if thabbasse judge it
to be expedient / then whom so ever she does chese with the cou^sayll of her
susters dredynge god / she may make her prioresse. The which prioresse shall do
all such things with reverence / as be committed and commanded unto her by
her abbasse / And nothing do contrary to the will and ordinance of thabbasse.
For the more that she is p^ferred above other / the more busy and diligently
she must observe the p^ceptes of the rule. which prioresse if she be espied
vicious or deceived with the spirit of pride / or else be proved a breker or
a dispiser of this holy rule / let her be warned with words unto the.iiii.
time. If she do not then amend / let her then be corrected as regular
disciplyne woll requyer. And if thereby she do not amend / let her then be put
out / and eiecte of the office of the prioresse / and a another which is worthy
her rome / be surrogate and succeed. And if afturwarde among the covent she be
not quiet and obedient / let her be expelled the monasterye yet never the
less to exclude the flame of envy / and evil will. out of thabbasse mind and
soul / let her in this process a yenste the prioresse think that she must
give an accomptes to god of all her iugementes.

The.lvi. chapter treats of the porters of the monastery.
AT the gate or the monasterye there shall be set a wise old suster / which
can receive and give an answer / And she must be of such grauite / that of
lyklyhod / she shall be no wanderer / which porter must have a lodge nygh the
gate / that co^mers may find oon all way present / of whom they shall be
answered / And as soon as any oon knokketh / or else a pore body callyth / she
shall say deo gracias / or else some other good word / And with all mekenes
and fere of god she shall give an answer by and by / with veruent charity /
which porter if she need help or comfort / shall have with her a young
suster. The monastery (if it may be) must be so bylded / that all necessaryes /
that is to say / water / a mylle / a gardyne / a bakehowse / and other diverse
occupacions may be exercysed within the monastery / that the mynchins have no
need to wandre out of the monastery / for wa^derynge out of there manastery in
no wise is expedient for their sowles / we woll that this rule be often times
red among the covent / less any suster woll excuse her self by ignorance.

The.lxvii. chapter treats of brethren sent forth in journey.
Monks that must be sent out of the monasterye for any business / must
commend them self to the prayer of all their brethren / or else of thabbot
/ And allway at the last oryson of the service of all mighty god / there shall
be had a rememberance for them that be absent. And brethren retorninge home
from their Journey / that same day that that they come home in / at every hour
of the day when the service of god is said / shall prostrate their self upon
the payment of the quere / And there shall desire the prayers of all their
brethren for their excesses / done in their absences / less by chance they
have offended by the way / other in seeing or herynge of any evil things / or
idle speech. Nether any of them shall presume to tell any manner of thing that
they saw or hard without the monastery / for of that co^methe mouche
distruccion / And if any presume to do it / let him be punisshed by reguler
discipline / In like wise also shall he be punisshed / that p^sumeth either to
goo out of the cloister of the monastery / either to goo any whither / or else
do any manner of thing / be it never so little wothout the commandment of the
abbot. All be it that the matter of this chapter cannot towche any minchins /
by cause they ought not for any cause / be it never so great to be sent out of
the monasterye / yet be cause we woll co^ceyle no thing of the rule from them
/ we have therefore translate this chapter in manner and form following.

The.lviii. chapter treats what is to be done if impossible things be
enjoined to a suster.
IF fortune / that to any sustre any greuouse or impossible things be
committed to be done / she must yet accept the commandment with all mekenes
and obedience / and if she se that the weight of that charge / far pass the
measure of her power / let her show the causes why she may not do it to her
soueraygne sobrely / pacie^tly / and i^ time / not with a proud stomach with
sto^dynge / or ageyn saying it. And if aftur she has thus showed her cause
to her Soueraygne / it be thought to the same that the said iniunccion or
commandment / ought yet to be executed and done / then let that suster well
know / that it is expedient for her to do it / and trusting to the help of
god / lat her charitably obey.

The.lxix. chapter commands that oon presume not in the monastery to
defend a another.
CHefely mynchins must be ware / that oon of them presume not / for any manner
of occasion / or in any manner or wise / to defend a another in her offense in
the monastery / yea all though / they be never so nygh in kynrede / This
thing in no manner of wise may be presumed of minchins. For of it co^munely
spryngeth most grievous occasions of slaundeers and debates and other
inco^uenintes. And if any oon do offend in this / let her be more sharply
punished.

The.lxx. chapter commands that none presume to beat a another.
ALl occasion of presumpcion / must be a voyded in the monastery / wherefore we
make and ordeygne (says saint Benet) that it be not lefull to any suster to
exco^icate or beat any of her susters / her oonly except / to whom power is
committed of thabbasse so for to do / They that does amysse must be rebuked
opynly / before all their susters / to thente^t that other may be affrayde
thereby. To children unto the time they be.xv. years of age / diligence of
discipline / tutell / and sure keeping / must begyuen of all their susters /
and that with all measure and reason. For she that either presumethe to punish
/ or stryke any suster of a gritter ayge the^.xv. with out the commandment of
thabbasse / or else is over sharp or hasty with the children without
discrecion / She must be puneshed by reguler discipline / for it is written.
That / that thou wylt not have done to thy self / do thou to none other.

The.lxxi. chapter shows that susters be obedient each to other.
THe virtue of obedience / is not oonly to be showed and exhibit unto
thabbasse of all the mynchins / But also all the sustres / must show
obedience / each to other / knowi^ge that by this way of obedience / they shall
goo to god / Therefore the commandments of thabbasse or prioresse / ever
p^ferred and set before / to the which we will no private commandment be
preferred after them / every Junior shall obey her Senior / with all cheryte
and diligence. And if any be found co^tencious / let her be rebuked. If any
suster for any cause / be it never so little / be rebuked in any manner of wise
of the abbasse / or if any that is superior unto her / or else if she
understand the mind of any of her superiors some what angrey or moved ayenste
her / all thoug hit be but little / by and by without any taryenge / so long
shall she prostrate upon the ground / before the fete of the same superior /
doing satisfaction / unto the time that the same anger or mouynge be heled
with a benediction / which thing if any oon refuse to do / let her have bodily
punisheme^t / or else if she be stubborn / let her be expelled the monastery.

The.lxxii. chapter treats of good zele which mynchins ought to have.
AS there is an zele of bitterness / the which desseuerith man from god / and
ledith unto hell / right so there is a good zele / which disseuerith man from
vices / and ledeth man unto god / and to everlasting life. Therefore this zele
must mynchins excersyse with most fervent love / that is to say / that each
prevent other in doing reverence. They must suffer most patiently the
infirmities of their susters / be the infirmites of body or of conditions /
They must show obedience / as every of them would be the furste to do
obedience and in manner strive among them self / who shall be most obedient.
None of them shall pursue the thing that she iugeth profitable for her self /
But rather that / that she iugeth to be profitable to a another. They that thall
show charity as susters ought / with pure and vnfeygned love. They must dread
god. They must love their abbasse / in pure and meke cherite. They shall
prefer nothing unto christ. who bring us to gydder to everlasting life.
Amen.

The last chapter shows all obseruacion of Justice is co^teigned in this
rule.
WE have written and declared this rule (says saint Benet) to thente^t / that
obseruinge the same in monasteres / we may show our self / to have somewhat /
either of the honesty of good manners / or else at the leest* soom beginning of
good conuersacyon. But furthermore they that effectually / and spedely pursue
to have the very perfection of good lyuinge / to them be necessary the
doctrynes of holy fathers / the keeping of the which doctrines / brings a
man to the higheste degree of perfection / For what book / or what sentence of
the auctoryte of almighty god / of the old or of the new testament / is not
the most straight rule and directyue of the life of man / Or what book of holy
catholyque faders does not declare the straight way / and even curle / whereby
we may com to our maker. Also the collacions and sermons of faders / and their
lives and ordinances / yea and also the rule of our holy fader saint Basyle:
what other thing be they? But for the well lyuyuge and obedient monks and
minchins / examples and instruments of virtues? But to us that be slothful /
evil lyuers / and neglygent persons / they be shame and confusion. Therefore
(says saint Benet) what so ever thou art / that makeste speed / toward the
heavenly co^tray / perform thou by the help of christ this small rule written
by us / forth beginning of good live / and religiose co^uersacion / And then
in co^clusyon / thorough the protection of all mighty god / thou may attain
to far higher steps of doctrine / and virtues / whereof we have made mention
before.
