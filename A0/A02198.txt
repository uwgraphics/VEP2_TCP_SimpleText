AN AVNSVVER TO GEORGE GIFFORDS PRETENDED DEFENSE OF READ PRAYERS AND DEVIsed
Leitourgies with the ungodly cauils and wicked sclanders comprised in the
first part of his book entitled, A SHORT TREATISE against the Donatists of
England.

BY JOHN GREENWOOD CHRIST'S POOR AFFLICTED prisoner in the Fleet at London,
for the truth of the gospel.

1590.

To the Christian Reader / grace and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ
our Lord.
BEcause Prayer unto God is a most Christian exercise and fruit of faith /
being rightly used: having so many commandments and promises concerning it in
the Scripture: by which we come most near unto God / as in any other part of
his worship / speaking to him (as it were) mouth to mouth / when we lift up our
hearts and power forth our requests unto the Lord: it was thougt needful /
seeing these latter Treatises of Mr. Greenwoods towching this Argument are now
published again / and his first concerning it cannot be had / here therefore
to note down briefly a few things both concerning the doctrine and right use
of prayer: and in particular concerning read prayer / by means whereof it is
come to pass that true prayer is so much unknown / neglected / and profaned.
And this we pray thee (Christian Reader) to take in good part / and to examine
up the word of God / which is the only rule of truth / and light of our feet
in the darkness of this World.

Prayer is the lifting up off the heart unto God / to call upon his name / with
faith / by the work and help of his Spirit. Psalm. 25.1. Romans 10 1;.14. Mat.
21.22. Romans 8.26.27.

Prayer is either with words / or without words. With words / being uttered in
speech / either publicly or privately: either in mo or fewer words: yet always
briefly: according ^o the present and several occasions. Exodus 32.11.12.13.
Ezra. 9.6.15 / 2. ^am. 7.18.29. and 15.31. Mat. 26.39 Ioh. 17. chap. Act.
1.24.25. and 4.24.30. Heb. 13.15.

Without words / being conceyved only in the mind / and so presented before
the Lord who knows the thoughts and secrets of the heart. Exodus 14.15 / ^.
Sam. 1.12.13. Esa. 38.14.

Prayer is either Request or Thankesgiving. Both these are either for our
selves / or for others. Request for our selves / is deprecatio^ or
supplication: for others / intercession. 1. Tim. 2.1.

Deprecation is for some evil to be kept or removed by the Lord from us. Mat.
6.13. and 8.24.25. Psalm. 70. Genesis 32.9.12 / 2. Cor. 12.8. Ia^. ^.13.

Supplication is for some good thing to be granted or co^tinewed of God unto
us. Mat. 6.9.12. Genesis 24.12. Exodus 33.12.13. Psalm. 4.6. Luke 11.13. and 17.5.

Intercession is for others / either for some good to be given / or some evil
to be taken from them. Mat. 6.9.11.12. and 5.44. Exodus 32.11.12. 13. Ephesians.
6.18.19.20. Romans 15.30.31.32. Iam. 5.14.18 / 1. Ioh. 5.16.

Thankesgiving is the yielding of praise and thanks unto God for his mercy and
benefits either given or promised. M^.. 6^9.13. Genesis 24.27. Exo. 15.1.21. Psa.
69.29.36. and 103.1.5: Ioh. 11.41. 1. Tim. 1.17. Re. 7.1^

Prayer is to be made always and only in the Mediation of Christ. Ioh.
14.13.14.1. Tim. 2.5. Not that this need always to be mentioned / but that we
ought always to come before God and present our selves / and our prayers unto
him with faith in the Mediation of Christ ^ by whom alone / we and al our
sacrifices are made acceptable unto God. For in him are all the promises of God
yea and Amen. 2. Cor. 1.20. Through him are all the graces and mercyes of God
conveyed unto us Ioh. 1.16. Ephesians. 4.7. By his Mediatio^ our prayers being
presented before his Father / all the weakness / want of faith love hope / and
any other corruption wherewith our prayers (as they proceed from us) be
disteyned / are covered and taken away. Because he puts the sweet odor of
his Mediation unto our prayers / and so presenting them to his Father / they
are accepted of him. Rev. 8.3.4. with Exodus 30.7.8. Psalm. 141.2 Mar. 9.22.23.24
/ 1. Pet. 2.5.

For this cause therefore / must prayer / in faith / always respect Gods promise
/ and Christ's Mediation. Mar. 11.24. Psalm. 50.15. Romans 8.34. Heb: 7.25. and
9.24. And for the same cause / must the person that prays first be accepted
of God in Christ / before their prayers and sacrifices can be approved. Rev.
1.5.6 / 1. Pet. 2.5. Prove. 15.8, Hag. 2.13.14.15. Genesis 4.3.4.5. and 6.8. and
8.20.21. with Heb. 11.4.7. Whereupon we are bound to be careful / first our
selves to be in the true faith and Church of Christ / under his Mediation /
that we may our selves be accepted of the Father in him: and then in faith to
offer our prayers / both for matter and manner / so as we have warrant by the
word of God / that he will hear us / and that Christ will be our Mediator /
therein. For which see the Scriptures a foresaid: and Mat. 6.9 Ephesians. 2.19. and
4.4.5.6. Act. 2.41.47. Exo. 30.9. Levi. 17.3.7. Deuteronomy. 12.5.8. Psalm. 16.4. and
50.8.14.16 17.23. Esa. 1.12. etc. Mal. 1.14 / 1. Tim. 2.1.2.5.8. Iam. 1.5.8.
John 5. 13.14. Rev. 8.3.4.

For our better direction and assurance herein / has Christ give^ that form
of prayer / which is commonly called the Lords prayer. Mat. 6. 9.13. Luke
14.1.2.3.4. Where he has prescribed a direction for the framing of all our
prayers both for matter and manner according to that rule. For in it we are
taught / as towching the matter of all our prayers / that they be for things
first and chiefly concerning Gods glory / and then concerning our good / so as
will stand with the glory of God. Ioh. 12.27.28. And towching the manner of
prayer / that it be in faith hope and love / with reverence / briefly and
humbly propounded / that he in all may be glorified. In faith (I say) both of
Gods willingness to hear and help / as being our Father in Christ / and of his
ability thereunto as being in heaven able to do whatsoever he will. Esa. 63.16.
Psalm. 115.3. In hope / of his mercy and favor toward us / he being our Father
and we his children in Christ. Luc. 11.9.13. In love both off God and one off
another / in Christ. Psa. 116.1. Mar. 11.25.26. Act. 4.24. With revere^ce / as
coming before our heavenly Father / who is full off glory and Majesty / he in
heaven / we on earth etc. And therefore also ought our prayers briefly and
hunbly to be propounded: not seking after long or affected speech / nor using
vain repetitions etc. Mat. 6.7.8.9. Genes. 18.27. Exood. 34.8.9. Ecclesiast.
5.1.

And note here / that Christ has propounded this direction / not by way off
exhortation or doctrine / as in other cases he was wont / but in form off
petitions / and those very brieff: Least otherwise we should have doubted that
we might not with such confidence in few words have spoken directly unto God
himselff: but that we must have used either mediators for us / as the Papists
/ or sighs only without words as the Anabaptists / or never ceasing from
prayer / as the Eutychians / or at least some long circu^sta^ce off words and
great affectatio^ of speech or the like / as ignorance / superstition / and
hypocrisy are ready to lead unto.

Finally / in this form off prayer / by Christ we are taught / that the end
and scope off all our prayers / ought to be the glory God in Christ. And that
therefore we pray always / with submission off our selves and our requests unto
his will / who being King and Lord over all / knows and will perform what he
sees best for his glory and our good. Mat. 6.13.

And thus prayer conceyved or uttered in five words / is better then ten
thousand otherwise / as the Apostle speaks of prayer in another case / 1.
Cor. 14.19.

Now the help which God has promised and gives unto us in prayer is his
Spirit. Which is as the fire / quickening and stirring up our spirit to and in
prayer: given of God unto us for the helping off our infirmityes / that we by
it in faith should call upon the Lord our Father in Christ: Romans 8.26.27. Gal.
4.6. with Exodus 30.7.8. And this fitly agrees with the nature of God / who as
he is a Spirit in himselff / so will he off us be worshipped in Spirit and
truth. Ioh. 4.24. Ephesians. 6.18.

Other helps as off praying upon a book / or of beads / or the like / read we
not any appointed by God. Many times in deed we read in the Scripture off the
prayers off the faithful made to the Lord / but never off any one that read
their prayers upon a book or reckned them upon beads etc. And no marvel /
seeing the Lord did never either command to use / or promise to accept such
service off him. Therefore must it needs be / that book prayers / etc. are an
invention off man / and a vain worship off GOD. Exodus 20.4.5.6. Esaie 29.13.
Matthe. 15.9.

Neither can this stand with the nature and duties off prayer / before
mentioned: But in deed breeds and nourishes both ignorance and neglect off
true prayer / as by lamentable experience may be seen.

But into this point we will not now further enter / seeing it is sufficiently
handled in these Treatises which were purposely written concerning it. Only
because Mr. Henry Barrow (who was Mr. Gree^woods fellow prisoner and fellow
Martyr) has also written of this point / and namely concerning the book of
common prayer particularly in some books of his / which now are scant to be
gotten / we thought it good likewise / from thence to annex these few lines
following concerning it. Mr. Barrow therefore in his discovery of the false
Church / speaking of the book of common prayer / writes thus: Page 64.65.66.67.

This book / in that it stands a public prescript continewed Leiturgy / as
if it were the best that ever was devised by mortal man / yet in this place
and use / being brought into the Church / yea or into any private house / yt
becomes a detestable idol / standing for that yt is not in the Church of God
and consciences of men: namely / for holy / spiritual / and faithful prayer /
yt being nothing less / but rather abominable and loathsome sacrifice in the
sight of God / even as a dead dog, Levi. 1.2.3 / 4. Chapt.
Now under the law / might neither any corrupt or any unlawful sacrifice / with
any seen blemish / be offered at the Altar / nether any part of any beast
(though whiles / yt lived never so sufficient) being slain before yt be
brought unto the Altar / yt was abomination unto the Lord: Every sacrifice
must be brought quick and new unto the Altar / and there be slain every
morning and evening: 1. Cor. 6 / 19. 1. Petri 2 / 5. (...). 21:10. ^om. 12.1.
how much more in this spiritual Temple of God / where the offringes are
spiritual / and God has made al his serva^tes Kings / and priests / to offer
up acceptable sacrifices unto him / through Jesus Christ / who has thereunto
give^ the^ his holy spirit into their hearts / to help their infirmities / and
teach the^ to cry Abba Father. Romans 8 / 26.15. Ephe. 4 7.8 / etc.
How much more has he which ascended / give^ graces to those his servantes
(whom he uses in such high services) to the repairing of the Saints / the
work of the ministry / and the edificatio^ of the church? unto whom God
uses the^ / as his mouth: the Church again on the other side / uses the^ as
their mouth unto the Lord. Isa. 28 / 9. etc. Hebr. 5.13
Shall we think that God has any time left these his servantes so singly
furnished and destitute off his grace / they cannot find words according to
their necessityes and faith / to express their wantes and desires / but need
thus to be taught line unto line / as children new weaned from the breasts /
what and when to say / how much to say / and when to make an end / to say this
collect at the beginning / that at the end / that before / the the other after /
this in the morning / that at after noone etc. How like children / or rather
like masking fools are these great clerks dressed? ^ / Corin. 3 / 2
show they not hereby / that either they have no faith / or else are such
infantes / as they have more need to be fed / the^ to divide the portion unto
others? Heb. 4 / 16 2 / Ephesians. 3 / 12
Know they trow we / what prayer or the spirit of God means? Prayer I take to
be a confident demanding which faith makes through the holy Ghost / according
to the will of God / for their present wa^tes / estate etc. How now ca^ any read
/ prescript / stinted Leitourgie, which was pe^ned many years or days before
/ be said a pouring forth of the heart unto the Lord? or those faithful
requests which are stirred up in them / by the holy Ghost / accordingl^ to
their present wantes and estate of their hearts / or Church? 1 John. 2 / ^.
Ephesians. 6 / 18. Phil. 4 / 6 The whole book of Psalms Lament. 3.40.41. Joel ^ /
14 Moses 14 / ^. Prove. 4 / 18 / 19. Luke 11 / 2^ /
unless they can say / that their hearts and Church stand in the same estate
now / and so still to their lives end shall continue / without either further
increase or decrease / change or alteration / as they did the^: yea / that
their childere^s children shall also so continue / to whom they leave and
incommend this Leitourgie, unto the worlds end. What a strange estate is this
/ that always thus stands / at a stay? The way of the righteous (Solomon
says) shines as / the light / that shines more and more unto the perfect
day: as on the contrary / the way of the wicked is as the darkness / they know
not wherein they shall fall. Our Savior Christ says / that if we gather not /
we scatter. 1 Petri 2 / 2 Ephesians. 4 / 13.
The Apostle Peter wills the newborn babes to desire the sincere milk of
the word / that they may grow thereby: until they come to the measure of the age
of the fulness of Christ says the Apostle Paul. Now then if they and their
church increase not in the measure of knowledge / grace / holiness / etc. yt is
an infallible sign that they have not the Spirit of God. If they do increase
why the^ is not God served with his own best gifts? Is not the judgment of
the Prophet the^ upon the^ / which says / cursed be the deceiuer / with has in
his flok a male / yet voweth and sacrifices unto the Lord a corrupt thing.
Mala. 1 / 14.
Is this old rotten leitourgis their new so^gs they sing unto te Lord with and
for his graces? May such old written rotten stuff be called prayer / the
odours of the Saints / burnt with that heavenly fire of the Altar / the lively
graces of the Spirit etc. may reading be said praying? may such apocrypha
trumperie be brought into the Church off God / and there be read / reverenced
and received / as the sacred word of God? thrust upon men's consciences / yea
upon God himself whether he will or no? Is not this presu^ptuously to undertake
to teach the spirit of God? and to take away his office / which (as has been
said) instructs all the children of God to pray / eve^ with inward sighs and
groans in expressable / and gives both words and vttera^ce / yea and (as the
Apostle Ihon says) we need no other teacher to these things / then that
anointing which we have received / and dwells in us. Ro^ 8 / 26 / 27 1 /
Ioh. 2 / 27
Is not this) if they will have their written stuff to be held and used as
prayer) to bind the holy Ghost to the froth and leaven of their lips / as yt
were to the holy word of God? Is it not utterly to quench and extinguish the
spirit off God / both in the ministry and people / whiles they tie both the^
and God to their stinted numbered prayers?

Is this the unity and uniformity that ought to be in all Churches? and is
amongst al Christ's servantes / to make the^ agree in a stinking patcherie
devised apocrypha leitorgie, good for nothing but for cushsions and pillowes
for the idle priests / and profane carnal Atheistes to rock them a sleep and
keep them in security / whereby the conscience is no way either touched /
edified / or bettered? Truly I am ashamed to think / much more to write of so
gross and filthy abhominacion / so generally received / even of al estates /
of these parts of the world / who have by a popish custom and tradition
received yt one off / and from an other / without any warrant from the word.
For the Apostles (I am sure) these master builders / have left no such
president in / or commandment unto the churches / neither given them any such
power to bring in or set up any such apocrypha Lyturgie in the church of God.
1. Tim. 2.1. Hebr. 13.15. Ephesians. 6.18 Philip. 4 / 6 1. Cor. 14 / 15 John. 4.24
They always used spiritual prayers according to their present wa^tes and
occasions / and so taught all churches to pray / always / with all manner off
prayer and supplication in the spirit / and thereby to make known their wantes
/ and show their requests in all things unto God their heavenly father: Our
Savior Christ also / he taugt his disciples / that God is a Spirit / and will
be worshipped in spirit and truth. He has likewise set down most excellent
rules / and a most absolute form for all prayers in that part of scripture Mat.
6.9.10.11.12.13. commonly (but falsely) called the Lords prayer: wherein he has
most notably instructed / directed / and restrained our ignorant and inordinate
desires / to those excellent heads. In which / whatsoever is needful for us to
desire / or lawful for us to pray / is in some one or other of those branches
included: every one off the being a base and foundation / wherevpo^ and whereby
to frame many millions of several peticions / according to the several wa^tes
and occasions / at such several times as the saints have cause to pray. They
are al of the^ / so many euerrunning fountains from which Gods servants by
the holy Ghost / derive and draw continually fresh and new graces: and are al
together such an abisme and unmeasured ^ea of wisdom / from which al Christ's
servants thorough the world / have always fetched all their knowledge / graces
/ confort / and assurance of and in their prayers (according to the capacity
of the vessel of their faith) some more / some less / al some / yet have not
al of the^ together / much less any one of the^ is able in the little dish of
his shallow understanding / to comprise the unmeasurable depth and greatness of
this Ocean of al wisdom and grace. Whereby yt is evident / as also by the
circumstances and manner of delivering the same by our Savior Christ / by his
Apostles / Disciples and Churches spiritual use of prayer according to their
present estate and wantes / that these prescript words were not given or
enjoined as a prescript prayer / so to be used by any / even the wisest / much
less the simpler / unbroken up / vnexpounded / etc. so much as a compendious
summarie of al necessary knowledge / and rules for all prayer / gathered (by the
Author of all wisdom) into a brief / for the direction and instruction of our
weakness and ignorance.

Of which ends and uses / whiles some are ignorant / or rather (as their
gross idolatry / carnal dulnes / and superstitious presumption shows) are
ignorant either what faithful prayer / or the spirit of God is: whiles they
both popishly abuse this Scripture as a principal collect in their public
leitourgie / with their often and idle repetition thereof / five times in their
morrow mass / etc. and / also through this abuse they grow further bold to
mould a new calfe / a new Leitourgie of their own / and set that up also in
the church of God / as they count yt.

If yt were granted the^ / that this scripture / and sundry psalms / and other
scriptures they alledg out of the prophetts / were commanded and enjoined to be
read and used / as / and for the very prayers of the church and of the Saints
(then which nothing can be more false or grossly fond to conceive) yet which way
(if this were granted them) can they hereby prove yt lawful for them to bring
in their ow^e apocrypha devises / and set them up in the church as and with the
holy canonical word of God? May their stinking filth be compared or placed with
the heavenly lively word of God / without v^sufferable blasphemy? may the
froth of their lips / and folly of their hearts be thrust upon men's
consciences / yea even upon the Spirit of God himself in this manner? In the
church of God may nothing come / or be heard / but the canonical scriptures and
lively graces of Gods Spirit / according to the same. But these their
apocrypha Leitourgies / can neither be said the word of God / neither the
lively graces of Gods spirit according to the same word / seeing they were made
and conceived long before / and are wholly thus used / without warrant / example
or commandment in the word of God / yea are contrary to the rules of and for
prayer / to the exercise and use of Gods Spirit / and directly set against all the laws of the first Table / by worshipping God in vain / afther their own
traditions / precepts / and devises / and not according to his holy Will / and
commandment.

And again / in his Refutation of Mr. Giffard / he briefly summeth up in
general / some especial reasons against the common prayer book before said /
besides the discu^sing of it in particular from point to point. His reasons
concerning it in general / he thus propounds / Refutat. page 49.50.

1. In that they presume to give and enjoin their prescript words in prayer,
they take the office of the holy Ghost a way, quench the spirit of the
ministry, and of the whole Church, stop and keep out the graces of God,
thrust their own idle devises upon the whole Church, yea upon God himself
whether he will or no: 2. In that by their Leitourgie they prescribe what and
how much to read, at Morn to their Mattens, at Eauen etc. teachinge the
church and ministry to pray by number, slint, and proportion, it is not only
popish, but most frivolous and vain, disgracing and not instructing the Church
and ministry: 3. In that by this their Leitourgie they prescribe unto the
Church what Scriptures publicly to read and when to read them, as these
Chapters and Psalms at their matte^s before noone, those at afternoon etc. On
all the days that they have public meetings and service through the year,
and so from year to year. They therebie take from the Church the ^olie and
free use both of the Scriptures and spirit off God. They therbie conceal and
shut out of the Church a great part off Gods holy word which they read not.
As also abuse without order those Scriptures they enjoin to be read: 4. In
that they shread, rend, and dismember the scriptures from the holy Order and
natural sense of their context, to make them Epistles, Gospels, Lessons, select
Psalms, to their festivals and idol worship aboue-said, They most heinouslie
pervert and abuse the Scriptures to the high dishonor of God and their own
fearful judgment. 5. In that they bring in and command the Apocrypha
writings to be publicly read in the Church: They both mainetaine and
publicly teach the dangerous errors therein contained, to the poisoning and
subverting of the faith of the church. They thrust these devises of me^ into
the place of Gods word, causing the people therebie to reverence and esteem
the^ as the holy Oracles of God, of like authority, dignity, and truth, and
to resort unto the^ to build their faith thervpo^, and therbie they bring in
an other foundation into the Church: besides the high injury done unto God
therbie: 6. Finally in that by this their Leitourgie they bring in, erect, and
enjoin a new and strange kind of administration, as is above proved in the
perticulars: They make and erect a new Gospel, and so must needs also erect
unto yt a new ministry. For the ministry of Christ is only bound unto, and
vvil only administer by Christ's Testament wherein they have a most perfect
Leitourgie for the whole administration of his Church. Therefore this present
Leitourgie and ministry of England: are by all these reasons in general and
particular found and proved at once to be counterfeite, ungodly, and
Antichristian.
Hitherto Mr. Barrow / and much more in his books before named / as the reader
there may find. Now to conclude / the end of publishing these things / is to
stir up all that fear God / seriously to mind what true prayer is / and to be
careful to use it aright / according to the word off God / which in all things
/ faith (without which it is imyossible to please God) must always respect and
build upon. Romans 10.17. and 14.23. Heb. 11.6. Josh. 1.7.8. That so we may in
this / as in all other duties of godlynes / learn to perform it so as whereby
we may be comforted of God / and God may be glorified off us / in Jesus Christ.

FINIS.
TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.
TOvvching the treatises follovving, know (Good Reader) that Mr. GREENVVOODS
first vvriting concerning read prayer etc. was by the Prelates taken from him.
Whereupon he desired Mr. GIFFORD, who vvrote against him and had the copy of
it, to publish it also to the world. But he would not do it: and so by their
means it yet remains suppressed. For what cause, thou may well
conjecture with thy self.

These things, Mr. GREENVVOOD himself signifies here in the Treatise ensuing.
Now if by any means that first of his come into thy hands, be thou
entreated, for the truths sake, either thy self to publish it, or to deliver
it to such as will: That so the whole matter and carriage of it may better
appear to all men, for the ^urther manifestation of the truth in this behalf.
In the mean time, these are published for thy benefit. The Lord give thee so
to use them. as may be for his praise, and thy comfort in Christ: Remembering
alvvay, that he is Mediator, not for any false worship whatsoever, but for
that only which is according to his word. Which point well minded (as it
ought) would soon end the question here controverted, and all other the like:
with all such as fear God* Mind it therefore, and so farevvell in the Lord.

The preface
1. Cor. 2. 11. What man knows the things of a man if not the Spirit of man
which is in himself: Even so the things of GOD knows no man if not the Spirit
of GOD.

12. Now we have received not the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is
of God, that we might know the things of GOD given unto us.

13. Which things we also speak, not in the words taught of man's wisdom, but
in words taught of the Holy Ghost, we compare spiritual things to spiritual
things.


My first writing being about that spiritual exercise of prayer and true
inuocacion of Gods reverend name, whereby the distressed soul of man, laden
with the burden of sin, compassed also about with so many deceitful enemies,
contynual assaults of Satan, rebellion of the flesh, entisements of the world
etc. seeks daily help of God the Father, giver of all good gifts, having
thorough. JESUS CHRIST free access by the direction of his holy spirit, for
all occasions to unburden yt self of whatsoever grief, or occasion of thanks
yt is moved with: I ought still* and by Gods assistance shall keep me in the
meeknes of the spirit, not witstanding his unchristian railinges, sclanders,
and reproaches against me and the truth. I then showed that no other prayer
could utter and ease the several occasions and distresses of this conscience*
and that no other man's writing could speak for this soul unto God, but the
heart and mouth of him that prays for himself, or is chosen the mouth of
many, uttering to God his or there minds for their present wantes or occasions
of thanckes giving, according to the will of God, as need and occasion urges,
and the spirit gives utterance. And I further proved that only this prayer
pleases God, and is grounded of faith; to this effect I brought many reasons
out of Gods word, admiring the ignorance of this age, wherein (having had the
gospel of Christ thus many years in our own language to search and try al
things by) whole congregations do make no other prayer to God then reading over
certain numbers of words upon a book from year to year, month to month,
day to day etc. the same matter and words as they were stinted, even out of
that Port^is, englished out of Antichrists masse-booke; besides private reading
of men's writings instead of praying. And seeing this counterfeit show of worship
and pretended prayers was made common merchandise in every assembly by this
Antichristian priesthood, and that al men every where were compelled to bow
down hereunto, and to offer by such counterfeit sacrifices; I perceaved the
first principle of Religion (which is to invoke the name of the true God,
through the meditation of Christ in spirit and truth, with heart and voice, for
our present wantes according to the will of God) was never yet sincearly taught
by these time-seruing Priests: But as an agreeable service to the humors of
earthly minded men which have not the spirit of God, this ware was thrust upon
al people, they well knowing, that such a ministry and such a Church of
wordlings could never have stood, without such a Samaritan worshipp and
Egiptian calf; and like earthly devised to counterfeyt a Religion, al men
inclyned to some. And long have I heard this pretended worship inveyed against
by many (sometimes zealous) for the errors and confused order thereof: Yet
could I not hear any to set down or teach, which was the true prayer that
only pleased God, many contriving diverse forms of words, as though they had
known the heart of man, counseled them to read them, day unto day, year
unto year, at evening, morning, dinner, Svpper etc. by portion, measure, and
stint, as an offering to God what state soever the soul were in; not teaching
the difference between reading upon a book, and prayer unto God, all this
time. So that true and only prayer has not been taught all this time, and
those that knew how to pray aright neglect it, this reading being most easy
as they think, and they a^test thereunto, compelled in the public assemblies
thus to mock with God, after the manner of the papists mattins, true zeal no
where found, but in the persequted remnant.

These my first writings, carried abroad by such as desired true instruction,
and willing to make others partakers of such benefits as God imparted unto
them, yt fell into Mr. GIFFORDS hand; Who (as yt seems being a merchant of
such ware* fynding the gain of the priesthood to depend here upon, or as he
says ( the peace and uniformity of the Church) made head unto yt; and that
not with purpose (as the fruit of his labor shows) to edify others, but
standing himself a minister to this Liturgy, having made shipwreck of that
conscience he sometimes was thought to have; with all bitterness of spirit, and
carnal wisdom, having no more savor of grace in his writings, then there is
taste in the white of an egg, flees upon me with uncharitable raylings,
sclanders etc And loadeth not only me, but all the faithful that walk by the
rule of Gods word, with opprobrious titles, of Donatists, Brownists,
Anabaptists, Heretics, Schismatiques, seditious, foolish, frantic, etc. to
bring not only us, but the truth of God into contempt with our Sovereigne
Prince, and all that fear God: for he cease not with laying al reproaches he
can devise upon our persons; as one of those Locusts, Reu. 9. whose similituds
are like unto horses prepared to battle, whose faces like men, but their teeth
as the teeth of Lions; But also perverteth, blaspheameth, and by all means de
faceth the truth offered him. Well seeing the natural man perceaveth not the
things of the spirit of God* (I speak not here of the gifts of the spirit but
of the grace of God which sanctifies the same, many having Charismata that
have not Charin.) And seeing I am already thus rent, Gods truth delivered by
me, trodden under his feet, I will follow the council of Solomon who
forewarneth me that he which reproves a skorner receaueth to himself shame,
and he that rebukes the wicked himself a blot: And so turn me from him,
leaving him to the consideration of his own words: where he says in his
Epistle to the reader, He that seems most zealous in Religion and refrayneth
not his tongue, has but bitterness in his heart in stead of heavenly zeal. And
though nothing else can be looked for at their hands that are Apostate from
that light they have sometimes themselves published, (of which sort the world
was never more full) yet for the good of Gods chosen scattered abroad, and for
the defense of Gods truth I cannot hold my tongue: And for the more
playnenes, I will answer as to him, though I mind not to have any more to
do with him, till God give him repentance. Wishing grace by the direction of
Gods holy spirit to him that reads, to weigh both sides uprightly, and to
follow the truth to his own salvation. IO. GRENWOOD.

GEORGE GIFFORD.
To condemn and overthrow read prayer, ye bring as the ground or foundation of
all your matter, this Sentence, GOD is a Spirit and to be worshipped in
Spirit. John. 4. This Scripture in deed is clear and strong to cut down al
Carnal worship, as disgreeing from the nature of GOD. And if any mayntaine that
the very bodily action of reading is the worship of God, it may fitly be
alleged against them, etc.

JOHN GREENWOODS ANSWER. Wisdom is Justified of her Children.
IT is agreed upon and consented unto on both sides, that seeing God is a
spirit, and only requires such to worship him, as worship him in spirit and
truth: all carnal worship is cut down hereby, of what sort soever, as
disagreeing from the nature of God: And that all fantastical devises of men;
namely, whatsoever is not warranted in his word, is carnal worship, a
wearisomnes unto him, and loathsome in his sight: So that no man ought to
intermedle, attempt, or practice any thing in show of worship whereof they
have not sure ground of his word: For even our God is a consuming fire.

Now to put away all your ( bodily) distinctions and earthly cauils, I still
affirm (as I have proved) the stinting, imposing men's writings upon public
assemblies, to have them read over by number and stint, or any other way, as a
worship of God in stead of true invocation, is a mere devise of man, and so
carnal worship; as also all other reading of men's writings publicly or
privately in this abuse, for praying to God. Yet say you to apply this Scripture
John. 4.22.23 in this manner against read prayer, is frivolous, where I appeal
to all men's consciences, for the weight thereof. It is frivolous, you say,
except I can prove that a man cannot pray by the spirit of GOD with sighs and
groans upon a book, or when prayer is uttered after a prescript form etc. At
the first step you go about to alter the question. All our prayers ought to be
uttered after a prescript form, even that perfect rule and form our Savior
gave to his Disciples and al poste^ities: But this is nothing to the matter.

For the other which is nothing but a begging of the question. I alleged
certain reasons to this effecet. First that those sighs and groans in
reading instead of praying were not of faith, seeing in praying the sighs and
groans that proceed of faith, minister matter to pray without a book.
Secondly that you did but barely affirm the question in calling it prayer by
the spirit when one does read, seeing reading is not praying at al: for as I
then alleged, to invoke the name of God in spirit, is by the work of the
spirit to bring fourth of our hearts prayer to God, which is than in truth when
yt agrees to Gods word. But reading is another matter, namely a receiving of
instruccion into the heart from the book. Out of the first Mr. GIFFORD makes
men believe he has fetched two heresies; the one a perfection of faith, the
other that faith cannot be joined unto, or stand with any outvvard helps for
the increase thereof. Little marvel, he found so m^nie heresies in our whole
writings, that could find two or three in my first reason: but that you may
remember your self better (though you had two years to consider) I will bring
the words before you again, if peradventure you may have grace to call back
yourself. I said if the sighs and groans (in that kind of praying) were of
faith, yt would, minister matter without a book: this sentence I may confirm
by many testimonies of scripture, that no perverted spirit can gainesay or
resist: the scripture teaches us every where, that in praying the spirit only
helps our infirmities, no other helps mentioned or can be collected in the
present action of prayer through the Scripture. He has sent into our hearts
the spirit of his Son crying: Romans 8.26. Gal. 4.6. 2. Cor. 4.13.
ABBA Father. we believe, therefore we speak. Yet here is not any show of
perfection of faith, but of the contrary, praying for our wantes. But this may
be gathered, that God only accepts the fruits of his own spirit in prayer,
and requires no more of any, but that every one according to the proportion
of faith, pray unto him, as occasion in them requires. Now to conclude that
because in praying we need not a book to speak for us, when the heart it
self and book of our Conscience speaks with God; that therefore faith never
needs instruction, but is perfect, were sclanderous, false, and senseless.
The cause then of these heresies proceed hereof, that your self Mr. GIFFORD
would needs frame two syllogismes, and in the moodes of your malice,
co^straine the proposition of the present action in praying, to a general
sentence of all times and actions, though both our question here was of the
very action of praying, and in the conclusion of that very point within six
lines after this, you had these words; Even in the time of their begging at
Gods hands; so that these heresies must be Mr. Giffords and not mine, seeing
they are found to be coined of his idle brain, and godles heart, only to
defame the truth.

But (say you) the most part are ignorant, weak, short of memory, etc.
therefore need al helps to stir them up to pray, etc. where, by your own
confession, reading is not praying, but a help to stir up to pray. And even
hereupon all our errors arise, that you cannot discern the difference of
spiritual gifts, with the distinct use of them. We doubt not but before
prayer, and all the days of our life we have need of helps of instruction to
pray aright, and for the fitnes of the mind and body, often fasting, reading,
meditating, etc. are great helps to go before to humble our selves in praying:
but in the present action of prayer when the heart is talking with God, the
eyes, hands, etc. with attention lift up to heaven, all the powers of our souls
and bodies conversant with God, to take a book and read cannot be called in
this action a help, but a confounding of the mind, of Gods ordinances, and a
doing we know not what, though before and after, it be an excellent means
ordained of God, to instruct us to pray and al other duties.

As for the confirmation you talk of, where I alleged that a troubled mind
is the pen of a ready writer / therefore needs not a book to speak for yt
in the action of praying: By troubled mind i understood such a mind / as is
presently moved with the sight of some sin / or urged by other occasion:
Psalm 5^ 17.
a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart: and not such a mind as in
despair or doubt is perplexed: and that the heart which is moved in faith with
present occasion to call upon God is the pen of a ready writer / (that is)
has matter and words enough without a booc^ to utter yt own wantes / we may
read throughout the Psalms. My throat is dry (says David) I am vvearie with
crying etc. But here again instead of answer / you tell me / I run upon
the rock of an heretical opinion of perfection: Wherein i wonder (but that i
perceive your right eye is blinded) you should be so careless what you say /
nay what after two years study you put in prynt. Does it follow / that
because the heart / moved with occasion through the work of faith has words
and matter enough in praying without a book to speak for yt / that therefore
faith is perfect? let equal Judges consider.

Here you say many are so troubled and perplexed in mind, that they cannot
pray till they have some consolation by the direction of others; which when
they cannot have, reading upon a book is a notable help, I allow all this and
agree / if you would make reading one thing / and prayer an other / diverse
exercises of the spirit etc. But in the very action of praying to have an
other speak unto us never so good words of exhortation / were but a
confounding of the mind and actio^ / and an abuse of both those holy
exercises. Even so / by your own comparison / reading upon a book in the
action of praying / seeing we cannot do both at once. Yt is the Spirit of God in
the very action of prayer that helps our infirmities. David in praying
finding his soul heavy / stirs up himself thus. My soul why art thou
cast down, Psalm 4^ end 43
why art thou disquieted within me, wait on God; For I will yet give him
thanks, my present help and my God. He had a troubled mind / his mouth wanted
no words to provoke the Lord to hear his complaint / and his heart to wait
upon the Lord / and so through all the Psalms you shall find the conversing
of the soul with God to be such / as yt were a mockery to think reading upon a
book could have any place in that action / or that any man's writing could
lay out the present estate of the soul with the passions thereof. The Priest
may say / my book why art thou so evil prynted, for when they read the
heart cannot reason and talk with God.

To the second point / which was but your bare assuming of the question / to
say a man may pray by the spirit upon a book etc. I alleged that to worship
God in spirit / is / when the inward faith of the heart brings fourth true
invocation / etc. this you grant to be most true / and that none other is
accepted of GOD / then that which proceeds from the inward faith of our own
heart: But you think that reading upon a book is to bring fourth of the heart
true invocation. This cannot be if we consider the difference between
proseuche and anagnosis prayer and reading / the one being a pouring fourth of
vows / petitions / supplications / the other a receaving into the soul of
such things as we read. This therefore i leave to all men's consciences to be
considered / whether the matter we read can be said a pouring fourt of the
heart / the whole use of those diverse actions through the whole Bible show yt
cannot. Now where I said that you teach men insteade of pouring fourth their
hearts / to help them selves with matter and words out of a book / you say I
speak fondly and foolishlie / etc. Mine answer now is / yt is well I lied
not / if I had said you compel men to read upon a book in all your public
assemblies / certain words of your own writings by number and stint / from
year to year / and day to day the same / instead of pouring out their hearts
before the Lord for their present wa^ts. I had not lied. Now let all men by
that which has been said consider the grossnes of yt / and so the folly
remains to your self. But to help this matter / and to deliver your self
conningly in such strayte / you sa^ you wish all men to use the help of the
book* that they migt the better power fourth their hearts unto God / being
such as are not thoroughly able. First you grant here / the prayers read upon
the book is not the pouring fourth of the heart / but ought to be used only as
an help wherbie you grant the whole question / and further all your assemblies
have had no other invocation of Gods name this many years / but a help to
teach the^ to power fourth their hearts. But whether men's writings may be read
in the public assemblies to this use / we shall after make manifest / Here yt
is granted but an help / and not the pouring fourth of the heart. And to whom
is yt an help? to such as are notable to pray. Here either you must confess
your whole ministry is unable to pray / or that they transgress in this high
worship of GOD: for in an other place you grant in all your assemblies this
reading is used of men's writings for prayer / thus you may behold your best
worship to be nothingh but a help to teach you to pray.

Where I said that you teach men to fetch the cause of their sorrowing from the
book / even in their time of begging at GODS hand / you say I speak fondly to
call that the cause / which is the manifestacion of the cause etc. You here
forget your arts / Is there no more cau^es then one? if yt be the isntrumental
cause / it is sufficient to prove / that if your Mininisters had not their
book / they had nothing to ask / or else asking that which is in the book /
they ask not that which before was in their own hearts / so not coming
heavy laden / they go empty away / and leave the matter in the book as
they found yt / till the next day / and then sing the same song. But true
prayer is / when the heart is first prepared / and moved with the sight of
their wants as the child that asks bread: So we should not pray of custom /
but ask the very thing whereof our heart feels the want^et. Your comparison
again betwixt the being stirred up by a Sermon / and stirred up by reading
shows / that your self will not make the reading the pouring fourth of the
heart.

There is no question but the exercise of reading is chiefly for instruction
and increase of knowledge / and meditating is not the same / nether can be said
to be all the use of reading / though we deny reading to be praying: but
because we are forbidden conte^tion about words / and I have offered you as
much wrong in saying you denied reading to be for meditation at all / I will
proceed to the more necessary doctrines. Also for the controversy of
Canonical and Apocryphal / we shall speak in due place.

Thus (say you) you have answered nothing at all unto this Commandment given
by our savior Christ to use that prescript form of prayer, say, Our Father
etc. but by shift and cavil etc. Here you think you have put me to a plunge /
your self needed nothing doubt / but that I allowed the Commandment holy and
good / and to extend to al Christians / as well as to the Apostles / namely /
to use that prescript form of prayer as the perfect pattern and direction to
all men's true prayers. But you I trust will make difference betwixt a form to
all prayers / and praying / or prayer. And here you vehemently urge me to
answer you / before I see you conclude any thing from the place / and so I
should run into folly / to answer a matter before I hear yt. In your
first entrance of this discourse / you were round in your Syllogismes, by two
at once to wrast my words / and can find none for yourself / Yt seems your
conscience is witness the matter would not hang together. And me thinks you
had never more need to have showed what you would draw from this place Luke
11. seeing I either mistook you last time / or else you make a simple
collectio^: which was this: Christ said to his Disciples, when you pray say Our
Father. etc. and not when you meditate say Our Father. Now what would you
conclude of this / except as I said that Christ would not have them meditate
that Scripture: But this I perceive was not your meaning: now I partly think
your Argument should be (if the sword were not broken in the sheath) thus*
Christ commanded his Disciples when they prayde to say Our Father, etc.
therefore to be tied to read over or say by roate certain words, is law full
praying. For the first / that our Savior Christ tied no man or commanded none
to say over those very words when they prayde / but to pray according to that
form / after that manner as Matthew. 6. I manifested in my first writing 1. that
our Savior did not command us to use those words. 2 that Matthew. 6. does not
keep the same words / nor that number of words which Luke 11. does 3. that
he did not say / read these words when you pray / or say these words by
roate. After all which reasons slilye passed away in both your answers / you
come with your bare affirmation / that he commanded those words to be said
over by roate or reading: yea a little after you say / it is false to say that
he commanded not the very words to be said over when we pray. And you further
conclude / that because Christ commanded his Disciples to say over those
words / therefore all men's writings in the form of prayer may be brought into
the public assemblies to be read for prayer / being agreeable to the word. To
which I a^swere that seeing no ma^s writings are without error / yt is
pernicious and blasphemous doctrine you collect. First because you make men's
writings of equal authority with the form of prayer which Christ has
prescribed 2 for that you give me^ as much liberty and authority to frame and
impose their Liturgies as Christ had to set down a form of prayer / he being
Lord of the house. The wickedness of which collections you shall never be able
to answer.

And because you here urge me thereunto / I will make answer to your two
places of Scripture / wherewith by false interpretation you deceive the simple /
which taken from you / your matter is nothingh but cauilling: The places are
these / Luce 11. Nom. 6. and because the one explanes the other / and your
collections the same from both / I will begin with nombers 6.32.33.34. etc.
Thus shall you bless the Children of Israel saying, the Lord bless thee and
keep thee, etc. Here you say they were commanded to use the very words
prescribed, in all their blessings. This I say is not true / for the Hebrew
word is Coh Tebaracu. thus shall you bless: where the word Coh is an aduerb
of similitude / as we say / after this manner; which cannot be to say the same /
but according to the same instructions. This word Coh is ysed throughout the
Bible in this manner / in all the Prophets when they say / thus says the Lord:
where the sum of their prophesies are only recorded to us by the holy Ghost
/ and not all the words. Again this blessing is used in the Psalms and
Chronicles in prayer / for the people / in many other words. 1. Sam 1.17
Ely blessed Hanna in other words / etc. And where by L^ce 11.2. yt is
recorded / that our Savior Christ commanded his Disciples / when you pray,
say our Father, etc. yt is plain by the doctrines following. 4.5.6.8.11.
verses / that Christ tied no man to the very words saying over / for he
teaches them to ask their particular wants / as a child asks bread or an
egg of his Father: also to importune the Lord for our particular wants. But to
make this place more plain / the same holy Ghost in the 6. of Matthew 9. verse
says when you pray, say thus, Our Father, etc. where the greek word houtos
has the same signification that the Hebrew word Coh had which is / after this
manner: and cannot be referred to the very words saying over / whereupon Mr.
Calvin upon those words says / Noluit filius dei prescribere quibus verbis
vtendum sit: The Son of God would not prescribe what words we must use. Now
consider how falsely Mr. Gifford has interpreted these Scriptures / to say the
Priests were commanded to use the very words / and that Christ commanded to
use the very words. As for his collections / that therefore men's writings may
be imposed upon public assemblies by stint and number to be prayde, vt is
intolerable error, and brings in all popery.

Here I must call all men that read this fruictlesse discourse to be witness of
Mr. Giffords abuse of his tongue / to the defacing of Gods truth. In his
Epistle he proclaimed / that I called all men Idolaters; which you shall
perceive to be his own words / and to that end I will briefly repeat yt. In
my first writing I affirmed the reading imposed Liturgies by stint and
limitation instead of true invocation / as also all reading men's writings for
praying / to be idolatrye. In his answer he said / he could not see by what
color yt could be called Idolatry, or maintained out of Gods word so to be;
but yt seems the penners of these things take every sin against the first
table of the law, to be Idolatry: if they do so (says he) and with all do
hold that no Idolater shall be saved, then doubtless all are lost, etc. Tothis
ignorant excursorie I answered / that all false and devised worship by man's
invention was Idolatrye / as the first and second commandemens did testify:
And so admit all the breaches of the first table were not idolatrye / yet
reading of men's writings instead of praying must needs be idolatry / seeing yt
is a transgression of the second Commandment. Further (though I needed not have
followed his emptye head / even a cloud without water) yet I proceeded to
prove / that no idolater could be saved but by repentance for their known
sin / and craving pardon with David for their hidden sins and secreat
faults. Psalm 119
Moreover (said I) do you think any man is free from all inward and outward
idolatrye / seeing we cannot keep one Commandment / and in some things we
sin all. In which words i plainly reproved his grossnes that concluded all
men idolaters which committed any idolatrye / and that no idolater could be
sauld / and distinguished between the sin of ignorance / weakness / and
inperfection etc. in Gods children / and open professed obstinate idolatry.
Yet this godles man would lay to my chardg / that i should call all me^
idolaters / whereas i never used such a word in all my writings / But only
answered his folly in this running out from the question / they were his own
words that brought this upon his own head / by concluding / that if every
sin against the first table were idolatry / and no idolater could be saved /
then all are lost / let the grosnes then be his and not mine. And i leave it to
the consideration of all men / whether i may not say / that they which
tra^sgresse the first or second Commandments / do commit Idolatry / without
absurdity. But says he though yt be so / yet the Scripture calls not the
godly / murderers / Idolaters / etc. for the relics of sin remaining. I
answer that therefore your former absurd cauilling where you said / if we hold
it Idolatry etc. is by your own mouth fully answered.

But to avoid this foil / he has an other evasion. I thought (says he) we
had reasoned about such gross idolatry as a Church is to be condemned and
forsaken / which is defiled therewith. Here again you misreport me: I never
reasoned to that end in this whole discourse / but only labored to show all
men this error of reading men's writings instead of praying / that they might
learn how to converse with God and their own Conscience / in prayer. And what
mendes will you make for this sclandering and defacing of the truth / to all the
world? all that I desire is your repentance and amendment / which God grant
unto you if you you be his.

It follows in your book thus: But seeing you confess tha^ all men be
Idolaters, that is touching the remanents of sin, it must needs follow there
is no Church free from spots, etc. This word idolaters must still be yours and
then i willingly grant / that no man living is free from idolatry /
concerning the relics of sin: Also that no Church upon earth can be without
spot upon earth: So that now / by your own confession / I plead not for
perfection in this life / though the more we want / the more we ought to
endeavor. With what face then could you publish me an Anabaptist in your
Epistle / and out of one mouth give contrary sentence? Does your ordinary
teach you to cast out such bitter waters of untruths? was yt possible I should
hold al men Idolatres / and some men without committing of sin after
regeneration / especially to mainetaine both such heresies as you gyve out?
Well consider your self / before the Lord call you to account for defacing his
truth / and pleading for Baal. I grant / yea / I were not of God if I should
speak otherwise / that the dear servants of God fall into most loathsome
sins after regeneration / that the riches of Gods mercy might appear in
their repentance / through the work of his grace. Then you reason thus: if
there be allwaies spots and imperfectnes in the true Church upon earth / then
al your Arguments you bring against the Church of England / are of no force /
except you will mainetaine a perfection. M^ne answer is / I will not meddle
with your Church to prove yt a false Church in this treatise / but refer you to
Mr. Barrowes refutation of Mr. Gifford* him that handles that part of your
book. Yet I must tell you your argument is very simple: For after the same
manner you migt reason thus: If there be no true Church without spots upon
earth, then the Church of Rome is the true Church, for yt has many spots,
and you all Schismatiques: Again you assume the matter you should prove. It
will be proved against you / that you have not Ecclesia^ a people called fourth
of the world to the obedience of Christ: Then / that the spots of your Church
are Egiptian ulcers incurable running botches. But I purposed not to deal with
your Church / only my mind is to show the vnlawfullnes of this readingh and
imposing men's writings upon men's Consciences in stead of true praying. Of which
sin the Lord give you and this whole land grace to repent / that so men may
learn more fervently to call upon God.

The first Argument against read prayer, etc.
No Apocrypha must be brought into the public assemblies: for there only
GODS word and lively voice of his own graces must be heard in the public
assemblies. But men's vvritings and the reading them over for prayer are
Apocrypha, therefore may not be brought into the public assemblies.

G. Gifford. First touching the Proposition, No Apocrypha is to be brought into
the public assemblies: What can be more false? Apocrypha is opposed against
Canonical: If nothing may be brought into the public assemblies but
Canonical Scripture, then the Sermons and prayers of Pastors are to be
banished etc.


I. Greenvvood. IN the answer of this / you will needs oppose against both
Proposititions / and yet have nothing to say / if not to royle the doctrines
delivered with your feet / least others should drink thereof. The part of a
wise man had been to lay his hand on his mouth. In the first Proposition you
would oppose the word Apocrypha against the lively voice of Gods graces when
you see I said only / that no Apocrypha might be brought into the public
assemblies. And further to explane my mind / least you should willingly find
such a cavil / I added this reason for there only Gods word and the lively
voices of his graces are to be heard: Where I acknowledged those lively voices
to be Gods ordinance / yet nether to be called Apocrypha nor Canonical. How
can you say then I would have these / or that these are banished / if all
Apocrypha writings be banished the public assemblies? Yet as I told you / I
take Apocrypha to be all writings / but the Canonical Authentic Scriptures.
But (say you) then I will exclude the Paraphrases upon the Scriptures and the
Psalms in meter etc. Affirm you them to be Apocrypha as you do / and can do
no other / and I will through Gods grace prove they ought not to be brougt into
the public assemblies. First / no man's writinghs are given to the Church by
testimony of Gods spirit / and we are only commanded to hear what the
spirith says: Rev. 2 7.11
therefore though men's writings be permitted to be read priuatlie of them that
will / and thereupon called Apocrypha (that is hidden) they may not be brought
into the public assemblies. Secondly no man's writinhs are without error and
imperfections / therefore not to be brougt into the public asse^blies: 1. Tim
3.15
The Church is the pillar of truth. Thirdly the Church is builded upon the
foundation of the Prophets and the Apostles Christ Jesus being the chief corner
stone / and not upon men's writings / Therefore men's writins may not be brougt
into the public assemblies. Other foundation can no man lay. etc.
Ephesians. 2.20. and 1. Cor. 3. Fourthlie if we might bring in any men's writings
into the public assemblies / the^ all men's writings which we judge agreeable
to the Scriptures. But this is forbidden / Ecclesiastes 12.11.12. My proof of
the first Proposition to this: If any men's writings are to be brougt into the
public assemblies by Gods commandment because they are agreeable to the
Scriptures / as you in an other place allege / then all that are thought
agreeable to the Scriptures ought of necessity by the same commandment / and
if there be no commandment / then none are to be make Authentic which God
has not made Authentic / For that were to set man in the place of God.
Gallat 3.15 ^ebr 2.3.4. and 9.14. Matt 5.18 2. Timot 3.15.16.17. rev 22.18.19*
No man's writings carry that majesty / that the pen of the holy ghost. No
man's writings are Cecuromenai, Authentic, confirmed by signs and wonders
from heaven / sealed by Christ's blood / that not one word or title shall be
unfulfilled / The Scriptures are all sufficient. All men must walk by that one
rule; To think there were not rules ynoug prescribed by the Lord for his house
were blasphemous and papisticall. Now for the explication / interpretation etc.
and speech unto God in prayer: God has given gifts unto men to pray and
prophecye / and ordained his ministerye of Pastors / Teachers / whose lively
voice is appointed to be the mouth of God unto the people / and of his people
unto himself / in the public assemblies. And th^se graces are not
Apocryphal, for no prophecy of the Scripture is of private interpretation
idias epiluseos: to every one to given the manifestatio^ of te spirit to
proffit withal. 2. Pet. 1.20 1. Cori 12.7.
Most excellent me^ serve but their time in the public asse^blies. Now I may
conclude a I began.

That only Gods holy word and the lively graces of his holy Spirit are to be
heard and offered up unto him in the public assemblies.

Where then in way of answer to the Minor Proposition, you say you see not how
our speech unto God should be Apocrypha: It answeareth not me / who deny an
other man's writing to be our speech in prayer unto God But conuinceth your self
by your own mouth / thus: True prayer is not Apocrypha, but all men's writings
are Apocrypha; Therefore men's writings is not true prayer. Here when you have
nothing to say for your self / you would make me believe that I account the
Psalms and the other forms of prayer in the Scripture to be Apocrypha when
they be read / though a little before you confessed / you had in your last
writing done me wrong therein. I do account the reading of the^ for praying /
to be a gross and superstitious abuse of the^ / yet the^ to be holy and
canonical Scripture. And here you have flatly overthrown your self: saying the
word Apocrypha is used with us for that which is not Gods undoubted word unto
us: And in your last writing / which should have been your answer / you said
/ God speaks to us only by the Canonical Scriptures. Now seeing you would
make your liturgies and devised forms of prayer / helps and instruction / and
yet cannot make them Canonical / or Gods undoubted truth / they must not be
brought into the public assembly / much less imposed by law upon the
Consciences of all men. And here remember all your Liturgies are cast out of
the door: besides that / you have not made in both writings one direct
answer to this most firm Proposition: which I will still leave upon you /
thus. Only the Canonical Scriptures and lively voice of Gods own graces are
to be brought into the public assemblies for doctrine and prayer.

But men's writings are neither Canonical Scripture nor the lively voice of
Gods graces in such as he has appointed to speak in the public assemblies.

Therefore no man's writings, may be brought into, nor imposed upon the public
assemblies.



Thus migt I make an end with this vain man / considering the whole matter is
proved against him / all that follow being but repetitions of these former
cauills / but that I must clear my self of his unconscionable sclanders.


The second Argument.
We must do nothing in the worship of God without warrant of his word. ^ut
read prayers have no warrant in his word. Therefore read prayers are not to be
used in the worship of God.

G. Gifford. To this I answer at the first, that it is a great audacitie to
affirm that there is no vvarrant in the word for read prayers. when there be
sundry testimonies to vvarrant the same, unless you will make difference
betvveene that which a man reads upon a book, and that which he has learned
out of the book. Further I said, I do not remember that ever I have read that
God commanded in the Scriptures the prayer shall be read upon a Book, etc.


I. Greenvvood. Seeing you have indeed not answered one reason or proof I
alleged in my last writing* but with much evil conscience (as the handling
shows) perverred them / I will leave them to be judged of them that shall see
my writing. And here / seeing you would not prynt yt / I will answer your chief
obie^^^o^^. First then you grant / that if I put difference between reading
upon the book / and that which he has learned out of the book / mine
Argument to sound: For by your own confession / God has not given any
Commandment to read prayer, and so yt has no warrant. Whereupon I gain thus
much: First / tha^ they which impose read prayer upon the Church / do that
whereof they have no warrant in the word / and that in the high service of God.
Then that they which read upon a book for praying / do that whereof they have
no warrant in Gods word: whereupon all your Ministers must leave reading their
s^nted prayers upon the book / or else stand under Gods wrath* and all that so
pray with them / which will be a fearful reckoning if they repent not their
sin showed them. And although our question he cheiflie concerning the reading
of men's writings instead of praying / yet I am content the other abuse of the
Scriptures be included also though I make not both in the same height of sin
/ as shall appear in my several reasons. As an unconstant man then / you in
the latter end of the answer to this Argument would call back again that /
which you here have granted: Namely / that there is no Commandment to read
prayer upon a book for praiyng.

Of the contrary thus you reason: The people of God did read the Psalms upon
a book when they did singe, therefore men may read upon a book when they
pray. I deny your Argument: besides that all men may see your unstableness in
denying and affirming with one breath / you now go about to make reading of
prayer a Commandment: thus you prove yt. Singing (say you) is a part of
prayer. Singing may be read upon a Book* therefore prayer may be read upon a
book. Admit that Singing were a part of prayer / yet does it not follow that
all prayer may be read upon a book. But you speak like an ignorant man to say
that Singing is prayer / seeing they are two diverse actions and exercises of
our faith^ the one never read for the other / nor said to be a part of the
other through the Scriptures / but are plainly distinguished 1. Cor. 14.15.
what is it then. I will pray with the spirit / bu^ y will pray with
understanding / I will sing with the spirit etc. again / if you be sad / pray /
and if you be merye sing Psalms / pro^^^xon ai and psalo. I will pray / and I
will sing are diverse exercises of the faith / if a man should say reading a
chapter of the scripture and prophesying were all one / were he not wide? Ian.
5.13.
Eue^ so every part of Gods service is not prayer. I grant we are every where
commanded to singe Psalms unto God. And alleged that place of the Apostle
to the Ephesians. 5.19. Speaking to your selves in Psalms and Himnes and
Spiritual songs / etc. and that of the Colo. only to this end / that in
Psalms singing we do not always speak unto God / as in those Psalms which
are only instructions and prophesies / in the 1. and 2. Psalms you have not
one word spoken unto God. Again / as all reading of the prayers in the
Scriptures is not praying or speaking unto God / so the reading or singing of
Psalms I took to have been a speaking to our selves a stirring up of Gods
graces in us etc. But I do not now / nor did not then hold yt so / in all
Psalms singing. And where you say I purposely left out the latter part in both
places / which was this sing unto God with a grace in your hearts / the Lord
knows I had no purpose to injury the Scripture / nor maintain an untruth /
But thought we might do those things with a grace to God in our hearts /
which were not properly and directly a conversing by thought and word with him
alone / but one thing might have kept you from crying out / heresy / in that I
added this / that I would not stand upon that reason / but desired to know yt
further. But how unjustly could you number this for an heresy maynteyned of us
al in your Epistle / that we should deny that Psalms should be song unto
God. The Lord keep me from such error. And a woeful Physician you are / if I
had been in such error, For the 102. Psalm I never denied: but that yt was a
most excellent Psalm penned by Daniell or some other PROPHET / and given to
the whole Church to be so^ge or read as other Psalms / in the form of prayer:
But you must prove that the Church did use yt as you say / to read yt over for
praying / or were commanded so to do. This is proof inoug they did not /
because yt is a Psalm. Now thoug the Church speak many times in the singular
number / yet it is expressed in some other verse that yt is so. But now admit
that you could prove that the psalms were read insteade of or for invocatio^ /
which you shall never be able to do / it does not follow that men's writings
shoud be brought into the assemblies and read for prayer. The 6. of No^bers I
have answered before: From the 92. Psalm you reason thus. If the psalms and
other forms of prayer in the Scriptures were read or said by rote the very
form of words for praying; The reading instead of or for praying. Here you
durst not set your assumption, it was so false / which should be thus. But the
Psalms and other forms of prayer were read for praying etc. This I showed you
was very untrue / they were never commanded so to be used / nor never so
used. My proof was this / they are given by the holy Ghost for other uses / as
singing / reading / etc. and not commanded any where so to be used / so that
you do but cavil / not having one proof for all your shameless assertio^s. Now
where I demanded what this made for your liturgies, and reading men's writings
for praying / except you would make your own writings of equal authority
with the Scriptures: You a^swere / That if I deny the consequence / it was
lawful to use the Psalms / therefore men's writings / the^ I will shut out all
prayers / eue^ the prayer of the Pastor. See your carnal handling / shuffling
/ and co^founding Gods ordinances: Does yt follow that because men's writings
may not be brought into the public asse^blies / or there read for praying /
therefore the prayers uttered by the lively voice of the pastor should herebie
be excluded? this your shift was answered in the first Argument / your cavils
are stale / you are again convinced. Touching the other matter of co^ning
phrases and forms of prayer by roate / to say over certain number of words /
yt is popish and a mere euasio^ / and bewrays your ignorance in prayer. In
this you have granted me that he which prays not with a feeling of his
present wa^ts of his soul / but says over certain number of words of
custom or affectatio^ / he is an hipocrite / which is true / proved. Mat 6.7.
Now by this examine your daily / monethlie / annual etc. saying over / nay
reading over certain words / every time the same / as you are stinted. It is
plain the sacrifice of fools / Ecclesiastes. 4.17. The two points wherein you
protest so willingly to agree with me / were these. First whether only such
prayers as were made without the book / were accepted of Gods children.
Secondly whether the same spirit teaches us to pray / that taught the holy
men of God before time. You grant both these / but that you would seem to
alter the first question: well then / Gods own spirit that taught the^ to pray
without a book / or stinting of words / teaches us so to pray now / and in
the action of praying gives the mouth to utter what the heart desires / moved
with the same spirit. Still then after your long shifting to and fro / I trust
you will stand to your first words / that you never read in the Scriptures
any commandment for reading of prayers. Secondly / to say over certain
numbers of words or phrases of the Scripture of custom or affectatio^ /
without feeling of / or asking for our present wantes / is hipocresie. Therefore
I will conclude as I began / mine Argument standing good / that / To do any
thing in the worship of God werof we have no warrant of Gods word / is sin.
But read prayers have no warrant in Gods Word / Ergo. etc.


The third Argument.
We may not in the worship of God receive any tradition which brings our
liberty into bondadge. Read prayer upon commandment brought into the public
assemblies, is a tradition that brings our liberty into bondage. Therefore
read prayer etc.

The Minor is thus proved / that God has left it in all men's freedom to pray
as the present occasion requires and the spirit gives utterance / according
to his will. Again no man has power to command any thing in the worship of
God / which God has not commanded etc. Mark. 7.7.8.9. Mat. 15. Gal. 5, 1.
etc.

G. Gifford. I say it is ungodly and near unto blasphemy, to affirm, that
prescript form of prayer is a tradition bringing our liberty into bondage
etc. my reason was and is, that the Lord by Moses prescribed a form of
blessing etc. Nom 6. the Prophets in the Psalms have prescribed many forms
of prayer. Our Savior Christ prescribed a form of prayer etc.


I. Greenvvood. HEre is a great storm / and yet nothing but wind. If you
were in Cai^has his place you would either have rent your clothes for zeal /
or else condemn me before you understand what I say. Is yt simple dealing do
you think to say / I hold it a bondage breaking our liberty, for the Lord by
Moses, (...) Prophets, our Sauiou^ Christ also, to set down a form of prayer
or to prescribe a form of prayer: Did you not see that the Minor Proposition
speaks of the reading / for praing / and not of the form of prayer? Again /
of the commandment / where by men are compelled to read instead of praying?
Did you not see that these words brought in to the public assemblies, did
specifye the matter to be men's writtings to be read in the assemblies as a
worship / yea invocation of Gods name: which is a gross mockery. Not that there
is any Commandment to read over those forms of prayer mentioned by you / for
praying: and so the Commandment so to read them for praying is an abuse of
them / and a Commandment of men and not of God etc. But that much more odious
yt is to bring in men's writtings into the public assemblies / proved
unlawful in the first argument / and then to commit Idolatry with them by
reading them instead of praying / and that to compel men by Commandment where
God had set no Commandment (...) use them / was a bringing all men into
bondage of popish traditions. So that your common recital of these places of
Scripture is abuse of them / and you do but palinodian canere. I think if you
get St. IHONS gospel about your neck as the Papists / you will think you
have religion enough. The more fearful is your Apostasy / you proceed from
evil to worse.


G. Gifford. About the Commanding a prescript form of prayer to be used, our
Church does agree with all godly Churches, yea the reformed Churches have and
do practice the same. here therefore I wish the reader to observe that you
Brovvnists do not only condemn the Church of England, but all the reformed
Churches whatsoever, and can be no other but Donatistes.


I. Greenvvod. I Trust your madness will appear to all men / the poison of
Aspes is under your tongue: he that cannot rule his tongue his Religion is in
vain. Shall I in your hea^e be pressed with multitude of Churches? the^ hear
what the Lord says / Thou shall not follow a multitude to do evil. Exo. 23.2
we have the word amongst us / we shall by that word be either justified or
condemned. Then either prove your matter from te Schriptures. or else give ear
to the Scripture. If those Churches you speak of / bring men's writings in to
the public assemblies / et in force them to be read for praying / I would see
their warrant / we believe not because men say so or do so / but because God
speaks: And where he speaks / al men must besilent. You may accuse ^ther
Countries as you will / I know not their estate / but your drudgery insteade of
true worship / is loathsome / the Priest with his masse-booke / and beggar with
his clapdisch canuize over the Pater noster for their belly / which is your
com-mon worship / with other trinckets. We shall speak of a Liturgy in due
place. Here you breath out your accustomed lies / sclanders / and (...). First
you term us Brownists and Donatists / whereas I never conuersed wit the men nor
their writings: I detest Donatus his heresies. And if they had been
instruments to teach us any truth we were not therefore to be named with their
name / we were baptized into Christ's. Brown is a member of your Church your
brother / and al Brownists do frequent your assemblies.

And here you wish the reader to consider / that I condemn all reformed
Churches / do I condemn all Churched for reproving a sin by Gods words May
not the true Church^^ (if they were such) err* Did I affirm at any time tha^
they were no true Church that used read prayers / remember your self / you
know who is the Father of such untruths. But because your Conscience bare you
witness you had wrongfully chardged me / and for me / all true Christians: you
bring yt in by necessary consequence thus, you affirm (say you) prescript
forms of prayer brought into the public assemblies to be the changing the
work of the Spirit into an idol, a tradition breaking Christian liberty, a
dead letter que^ching the Spirit etc, and therefore most detestable. But all
reformed Churches recieue and use it etc. ^ therefore. You ca^ reason well to
bring the thruth into contempt / your mouth to open and tongue where as a sword
thereunto. If the proposition be true / draw what consequence you will / it is
yours an not mine / if the doctrine be true yt is Gods word that gives
sentence against the sin. And if you have (...) spar^^e of grace / procure
that we may decide the truth with other Churches. Does it follow that because
imposing of men's writings to be read for praying is an ^ynous sin / therefore
they that use yt are no Church* If I should say so / I should justly be called
an Anabaptist.

And here you accuse me to plead for such a freedom in the Church / that
nothing be received which is imposed by commandment. Abaddon is the Father of
such Prophets. Does yt follow that because we would have ^he Church free from
al traditions of men which have no warrant in Gods word / that therefore we
would not receive Gods ordinances by Commandment. That we ought to receive
nothing by Commandment in the worship of God / which God has not commanded
/ the second commandment with the Scriptures I have rehearsed / are evident.
Deuteronomy 5.32 33. Mat. 25.2.3. Gal. 4.9. Collos. 2.20. But seeing your self graueled
/ considering all the world cannot lay a Commandment to bring their own
inventions into the assemblies / where God has laid none / but forbidden yt:
you ran to your former places of Scripture to wrast them as before / where
your collections are but vain repetitions of that which has been co^vinced
before. Moses / the Prophets etc. prescribed forms of prayers / therefore men
now may thrust their writings into the public assemblies: Your Argument is
denied: and yet here is no warrant for the reading them over for prayer.


G. Gifford. The Church has power to expound those prayers mentioned in the
Scriptures, and to apply them to their several necessities etc.


I. Greenvvood. If you mean by expounding / the breaking up off them by
doctrine / and by doctrine and prayer to aplye the^ to the several uses of the
church by lively voice / far be yt from me to think otherwise. But if you
mean by expounding / to make homilies upon them / or liturgies by writing to
be thrust upon the public assemblies / you are wide / and now justify
homilies instead of preaching / and written prayers instead of praying* show
your warrant: The CH^^CHES power is limited by the word.


G. Gifford. When the prayers be framed and composed of nothing but the
doctrine of the Scriptures, and after the rules of true prayer, nothing is
broug^ in which God has not commanded.


I. Greenvvood. THis might have come in before your raylings / but you saw yt
was too silly* where is that commandment of God / that all men's wri^tinges in
form of prayer agreeable to the Scriptures should b^ brought into the public
assemblies) your bare word is not enough t^ put (...) to silence. And when you
have got them into the Church / yo^ must prove that GOD has commanded they
should be read for prayer.

Where I said our Savior Christ never used the words when h^ prayed / of that
form of prayer he gave to his Disciples / nether co^mau^^ded his Disciples to
say over these words / nether do we read tha^ ever his Apostles did use them
/ or enforced others to use any certain number of words / you say I speak
untruly. For say you the Disciple desired him to teach them to pray / as John
taught his Disciples / an^ he commanded them / when you pray / say Our Father
/ etc. Luke. 1^ and S. Math. an Apostle has delivered the same to the whole
Church. I answer I have never heard that Ihon Baptist taught his Disciples to
say over certain words / nether can yt be gathered by our Savior Christ's
answer: for he answered not always their very demand according to their
words / but thereupon took occasion to instruct them as he saw need. And I
have proved by the 6. of Math. that our Savior did not command them to say
over the very words when they prayed; for the word Houtos in Matthew signifies
after this manner: Again that Math. records not the very number / or the very
same words that Luke does. And now I reason thus: if Christ had commanded
those very words to be said over in praying / then we must always when we
pray / say over those words: for in Math. ^. he says when you pray / pray
thus / Our Father etc. The word when shows / that this commandment is to be
observed at all times: And then the Apostles sinned in praying other words
Acts. 4.24.25. Further yt being the most summary form of prayer / most ample /
most perfect etc. if those words were commanded to be said over / then we
ought not to use any others for he is accursed that brings not the best
offring^ he has. Malach. 1.14. By all these yt is evident that our Savior nor
his Evangelists tied no man to the very words saying over / but according to
that form and those instructions: and now leave of your popish dreams. Yet
you would make me^ believe I reasoned thus / that the Apostles did not / nether
our Savior himself / nor any that we read of / use these words in prayer /
therefore they did not use yt. Nay I said they did not use those very words in
their prayers / but used other words according to their particular wants / as
our Savior in the 17. of John is said to do: therefore he nether used nor
commanded others to say over those words. And so I may well conclude / that
to impose certain words to be read or said by ro^te for praying / upon the
church / espeaciallie men's writings / is an intolerable pride / even a setting
of men in the place of God: Also to use them or bow down unto them in that
order / is sin / and breach of Gods law.


The fourth Argument.
Because true prayer must be of faith, uttered with heart and lively voi^^: It
is presumptious ignorance to bring a book to speak for us unto God etc.

The fifth Argument.
To worship the true God afther an other manner then he has taught, is
Idolatry. But he Commands us to come unto him, heavy laden with contrite
hearts, to cry unto him for our wants etc.

Therefore we may not stand reading a dead letter, instead of pouring fourth our
petitions.

The Sjxt Argument.
We must strive in prayer with continuance etc. But we cannot strive in prayer
and be importunate with continuance, reading upon a book Therefore we must not
read when we should pray.

G. Gifford. These 3. I joined together as having no weight, you say I
answer by plain contradiction without Scripture etc. And afterward, is not
my bare denial as good as your bare affirmation: etc.


I. Greenvvood. STay your selves and wonder / they are blind and make blind. Is
there any doctrine more spiritual / any more inculcated by the Holy Ghost /
then this access unto God in the mediation of (...) own spirit / to make our
minds known unto God / to offer up the (...) own spirit in us / and fetch
increase from him by this (...) true (...) with the heart and voi^e? This
colioquie with the high ^^iestie of God is it a m^rter of no weight to learn
to discern between (...) exercises of the spirit / and to exercise his graces
aright according to (...)? Rightly is it said / the wisdom of God is
foolishnes to the natural man. But Mr. GIFFORD will say he grants the
propositio^s true and weighty matters (...) is the Assumptions that be so
frivolous / and as he says a little after / ridiculous: well / let them be
weyed. 1. That reading instead of praying is not a powringh fourt of the heart
by lively voice. 2. That it is a quenching of the spirit / to read an other
man's words upon a book / in the very action of pouring fourth our heart as we
pretend. 3. That yt is not an vn^ordening of a contrite heart by faith / but an
ignorant action to read for praying. 4. That we cannot s^riue in prayer /
continue in prayer / be importunate etc, by reading upon a ^oo^e. These are the
(...) he t^incketh of so little weight: the bare denial and contradiction
whereof he holds of such credit / that it must suffice for answeere / seeing he
sait he has before proved the use of reading. See here he calls yt the use
of reading: he could not say that reading is praying / neth^r that these two
exercises of our Faith can be used both in one instant / as one action. I have
sheweed that pro^^che and an^gnosis / praying / and reading / are diverse
actions both of the mind and body let the reader consider what weight then
this matter is of / to talk with the living God.

But for the benefit of such as have grace to savor the things that are of God
/ I will a little illustrate these Assumptions / at least some of them. 1. That
yt is a quenching of the spirit to read an other man's words upon a book when
I should power fourth mine own heart / the word yt self must be considered /
the Apostle commands saying 1. Thessalonians 5.19. extinguish ye not the
spirit. Now to suppress and leave vnvttered the passions of our own heart by
the work of the spirit / giving us cause of prayer / and instead thereof to
read an other ma^s writing / I doubt not will be found and judged of all that
have spiritual eyes to see / a quenching of that grace yea in that action /
the reading hinders us from pleading our cause with God / according to the
occasions we see in our own hearts. And by not teaching men to draw out the
graces of God in the^ / to offer up the sweet incense of his own spirit in
prayer / but an other course devised by fleshly pollicye / the people grow in
such Atheism / that they learn not all the days of their life to lay open
their own soul before the Lord in prayer. How much more then / by imposing
stinted words to be read in the whole assemblies insteade of the lively graces
/ making yt a sufficient ministry to read over such beggarlie ware / do you
abondon Gods spiritual gifts / and make an assembly of Atheists in most
places of this land / yea in the best assemblies you compel such ware to be
read / when and where the lively voices of Gods present graces should only he
drawn fourth as an holy odor unto the Lord. Yea I appeal to the
consciences of all that fear God / if this have not brought the land generally
into Atheism / that not one amongst an hundred can call upon God.

2. That it is an ignorance to presume to come into so near a conversing with
God / and to do one action for an other / so offering the sacrifice of fools /
let yt be sufficient proof that reading is not praying. That yt is presumptuous
/ to bring such lame sacrifices when you know to do better / let yt be
considered whether you would so uncircumspectly / and carelessly approach to the
presence of the Prince or any noble personage. Then if he be our Lord / where
is his honor / his fear etc. when we will teach men and compel me^ to do
they know not what in his sight / and to offer such lame sacrifice. The
Priests themselves care not what offering they bring him / Malach. 1.

Thirdly the reading prayer can be at no hand a striving in prayer / for the
word agoniso which is read Romans 15.30. signifies to conte^d in feruency both
in mind and word / to prevail with God as Iaakob wrestled with the Angel /
and said / I will not let thee go except thou bless me. Genes. 32.24.25.26.
such s^rift you shall see through out the Psalms in the prayers of David and
the Prophets / alas / how this should be performed either in feruencie or
contynuance / let the wise consider.

4. For importunacy and contynua^ce in prayer / whereof we have many precepts /
let the word be looked upon / which is proscart^reo to insist by perseverance
etc. as we see our Souiour Christ make plain unto us by a parable Luke
11.5*6.7.8. and Luke 18.1.2.3.5.7. now shall not God auendge his elect which
cry night and day? Experience we see in Moses / who when he lifted up his
hands to heaven the Israelites so long prevailed: Exodus 17. You can not make
your read prayers serve in this use with all your divises. For how would you
effect this / except to make the Priest read till he sweat again / with vain
repetitio^ / and the people that use such stinted prayers to say the^ often
over / as the Papists their fifteen Aue marias and five Pater nosters as a
cure of al their grieves. By this little I have spoken / yt may appear (though
the Lord knows I am a man of uncircumcised lips / neither able to utter
that God gives me by faith to see in these high things / neither yet
co^prehending any title of the exce^llcy of the) yet I hope yt shall appear to
Gods children / how odious your merchandise is in Gods eyes / and how you make
the ordinances of God of true prayer / of none effect / by your traditions he
only approving the lively graces of his own ministry / and such as have
gifts and are caled thereunto / to be his mouth unto the people and the peoples
mouth unto him in the public asse^blies: you invent a new worship and
extinguish his / which makes me^ fall into dissolutenes and bloody tyranny
against his Saints.

And where I alleged that Paul would pray with the spirit and understanding /
and therefore not up on a book / you answer that Paul had no such need of a
book as other men have. But if you had looked upon the text better / you
should see / that the Apostle in his own person teaches what ought to be
done in all Churches and of all men / And that he there takes away the abuse
of spiritual gifts 1 Corin. 14.15. and in the same Chapter shows that this
and all other his doctrines are commandments of God. verse. 37. now either
God prescribes two ways to pray / or else your reading for praying is a devise
of man. But your self have confessed there is no commandment to read prayer
for praying. Yet here you cavil with your stale shift / that Paul taught
others to singe Psalms upon a book / which is a mere evasion / seeing singing
is not praying. The same Apostle says to all that are borne of God / because
we are sons God has sent fourth into our hearts the spirit of his son
which cries Abba Father. So that althoug we have not like measure of grace /
yet if we cannot pray we have not the spirit of God / Gal. 4.6

I alleged as you say a reason here why prayer read cannot be true prayer. In
readi^g we fetch the matter from the book which moves the heart / In true
prayer we fetch the matter from the heart which causes the mouth to speak.
Your answer is / that this is a most ridiculous vanity / for tell me (say
you) this / when we bring fourth in true prayer matter from the heart which
causes the mouth to speak / has not the heart been first moved with the
word of faith / etc?

Let men here witness with me / what cause I had to esteem you as a shorner /
Again / how empty you are of any spiritual savor. And here you have no
answer to give / but ask me certain questions: First whether when we bring
fourth in true prayer / etc. the heart has not been first instructed. To this
I answer / that again you confess the reading prayer upon a book is not
praying / but an instruction of the heart to pray. If you would stand to this
/ we should not need have so much labor / and all the places of Scripture
which you have alleged for to prove reading praying / have been merely
wrested by you to deceive the simple. Well (say you) but if the heart be first
instructed before yt can utter matter in prayer / why may not the heart again
be moved with hearing or reading the word / and so utter prayer. Yes I grant
/ and still you grant me / that reading is not praying but moves to prayer:
Then all your assemblies that have no prayer but reading prayers / have no
prayer at all / and all that use read prayer for praying do not pray but mock
with God. See if your Ordinary will here be pleased with you: Yet you would
deny all this with the same breath by a shifte / saying: The heart is moved
when one hears the prayer of the minister and presently sends fourth
prayers together with him. I trust you will not say that the heart of the
hearer prays one thing / and the Minister an other / again the prayer of the
minister is the prayer of the people / by Gods ordinance / whiles they thinck
one thing / and are met to one end / for avoiding confusion one speaks /
yet al pray together one thing. But the minister may as well preach and pray /
or read any chapter and pray / as read prayers / and pray both in one
action of the mind / and voice / which were strange. Your cavil then /
whether the heart may be moved / and pray / both at once / is taken away /
seeing you grant reading and praying / two several excercises of the heart and
voice / which cannot be performed at once with lively voice. The conclusion is
then / that either ye must fetch the matter out of your book when you read
prayer / and so do not pray for the particular wa^ts where with the heart is
moved and pressed before you come / or else you pray not with lively voice at al
/ when you read. The Lord then having taught us to break up our own hearts /
and power fourth our own petitions with heart and voice / gyve grace to all
his people so to worship him. We must pray as necessity requires. 7. Argu.
But stinted prayers cannot be as necessity requires. therefore stinted prayer
is unlawful.

To this I answered, approving the Proposition. And in the Assumption I did
distinguish of matters to be prayed for: G. Gifford.
as that there be things necessary to be prayed for at all times. and of all
men: of these a prescript form may be used at all meetings of the Church.
there be matters not at all times needful to be prayed for, for such there can
be no prescript form to be used contynually. etc.



I Have proved in the first Argument / that no men's writings are I. Greenwood.
to be brought into the public assemblies / for there the lively graces of
Gods own spirit and Cononicall Scriptures only must be heard: In the Second /
the vnlawfullnes of reading for praying / In the third / the vnlawfullnes to
impose any thing by commandment / that God has not commanded. And here we
shall handle in few words the end of your stinted prayers. Your distinction is
far differing from the wisdom of the spirit / for though many things be at
all times needful to the public assemblies / yet stand not the assemblies
either al at any time / or any at all times in the same need and feeling of
them / or fitnes to receive them / so that except you can make all assemblies
in the same want of such things as are always needful / or any at al times /
in the same preparednes to ask / and use the^ that be needful / you ca^ make
no stinted prayers for them. Give ^are then to the Scripture in this point 1. Corinthians. 2.11. Ia. 4.14
For what man knows the things of a man, if not the spirit of man which is
in himself, etc. Again, who knows what (shall be) to morrow? Whiles you then
thought to have found out more then the only wise governor of his house saw
needful for his worship in his Church / and of every soul / you have lifted
up your self into his seat / and taken the office of his spirit upon you /
who searches the hearts and knows the reins / and teaches his people how
and when to ask / according to his will and eheir needs. Romans 8.26.27. also
the spirit helps our infirmities, for what we should pray as we ought we know
not: But the spirit it self makes request for us with sighs and groans which
cannot be expressed: Yet searching the hearts knows the meaning of the
spirit / because he makes request for the saints / according to the will of
God. And where you say then / that if we marck the prescript form of prayers of
all Churches / we shall see this regard / that nothing be left out which is
necessary etc. Romans 8.7 and 11.34 1. Cor 2.16 ^^d 3.19
This bewrays your shallownes / the wisdom of the flesh is foolishnes with
God: who has searched the depth of Gods spirit / or known the mind of man?
who ca^ prescribe the estate of al Churches / and what every moment is needful
to be prayed for^ Odious then is such dross of a fleshly man's heart.

Your second provision / that nothing be prayed for in your liturgy that
falls seldom out / but they are limited to the time. Your Church has not
this provision / you compel men to pray against thunder and lightning at midd
winter / and in your most solemn feasts against sodeine death: But the truth
is / till you amend your ways / God will accept no sacrifice of you / much
less requires this at your hands / to do more in his worship then he has
commanded.

And where you say / in the Church of England the preachers are not limyted
touching the matter of their prayers / it is not true / you are all sworn to
your portuis, howsoever / you may omit some of yt for your Sermons / and under
pretext thereof / what part you will. And why is there not a form for prayer
prescribed / to be used after and before your Sermons? is it because the text
is not allwaies the same / or that the speaker is not in like fitnes / or the
auditorie in the same preparednes? I assure you these things might be
sufficyent cause why you cannot use always the same words / and pray
according to your necessities / and even so stands the case for all other
affairs in the Church. The disposition of the soul and the distresses thereof
/ continue not in one state one hour. But let me tell you why you have no
form of prayer for your preachings: In many of your parishes / or (as you
would have them) Churches / Sermons are of those rare things / whereof you say
there ca^ be no proscript form of prayer / yea your liturgy approves a
ministry and sufficyent administration without any doctrine / which shows
yt came out of the devils forge / and not out of Christ's Testament.

But seeing you would take upon you to set so many perscript forms of prayer /
as there is things necessary for every assembly to pray for / where Christ
has set none / And if yt were a thing so necessary to have prescript words
at the administration of the Sacraments / I asked you whether our savior
Christ had not forgott himself as you thought that when he commanded his
ministers to go preach and baptize / and showed them the words of institution /
and the Elements to be used with all things thereunto needful / he did not
prescribe some form of words for prayer in particular: In the tabernacle
every pin was prescribed / so that either such forms of prayer are not
necessary / or Christ's Testament has some wants. To this you answer / that
yt is not of necessity there should be a set form of prayer prescibed for the
administration of the Sacraments: The minister may conceive prayer / etc. Hold
you to this / that it is not of necessity: you will deny it again the next
Argument. Well here you grant / yt is not of necessity / But you have not
answered me / till you tell me whether you hold it necessary or no: if ill be
at all times necessary / the Testament is not perfect. Again do you not hold
yt of necessity / when you eycommunicate men / and depose your ministry for
not observing yt? But you say / yt is for conueniencye. If it be a part of
Gods worship / and all times convenie^t / then is it necessary / and if yt be
not necessary / put such conueniency in your cornerd Capp / or surplus. Now
if yt be necessary at all times / you must prove yt is commanded in Gods
word / or else say that all things necessary in Gods worship be not contained
in Gods word / which were-blasphemous and papisticall to affirm. To this you
grant all things necessary and convenient are contained / and ask if I be
ignorant that there be many things contained in the scriptures / that are not
expressed in particulars / but be gathered from the general rules. No / I am
not ignorant of this: but if it may be gathered either by express words / or
by general rule / that there should be prescript forms of prayer for the
administration of the Sacraments / or any other particular action of the
Church / then must yt be so of necessity / because God has commanded yt /
though not in particular / yet in general rules: But you grant yt is not of
necessity: therefore yt is not commanded in particular / nor contained in any
general rule.

Yet you demand of me / if one should object that there were not commandment
in the Scriptures / nor example for any prayers to be made at all before
preaching etc. I would say he should lie against God / we have both. For the
Apostle shows yt was the chief part of their office / to perdure in the word
and prayer. Act. 6.4 / 1. Cor. 14. and 1. Tim. 2.1 / Acts. 2.42. besides / all
things are sanctified unto us by the word and prayer. And because they never
used doctrine in Church / but prayer went before / their meetings is said to be
unto prayer. 1. Tim. 4.5 Act. 16.13 ^6.
Some things there are I grant that are not prescribed in particular / and yet
are commanded by general doctrine / as baptism of Infants. But whatsoever is
commanded either in particular or necessary collections from general rules /
are of necessity to be obeyed / as the commandments of God / and may not be
altered / but your particular forms of prescript words have no such warrant.
Now seeing you would have no prescript words of prayer for the minister to use
before his preaching / nor of necessity for the Sacraments / and have none for
excommunication / etc. I wondered whereof your Portuis is made / and whereto yt
should serve / except for churchings and burialls and such popery / whereby you
leave the commandments of God / to set up your own traditions. And here
upon I demanded whereupon you would make your stinted and set prayers. You
marvel I should be so babbling and make such questions you mean about your
babbling worship. You say of the particulars of the Lords prayer. I demand
now again / whether you can number the stars of heaven / or the sands of
the sea / if not / much less the^ particulars of the Lords prayer / There is
medecin / and direction of prayer for every soul / and every disease thereof
to be drawn fourth by doctrine and prayer as the need requires you would set
a liturgy upon some things / and compel me^ thereunto every meeting / which
were nothing else but to seal up the fountain / and send men to the dry pitts
of your execrable devises / from the whole fountain / to a pitcher of water /
from the lively graces of doctrine and prayer / to your own writings. Paul
commanded to pray for Kings and Princes / yet bound no man what words to
use. 1. (...). ^. 1.2.3.4.5
The Lord gyve you repentance of such presumptuous sin / as to alter his
worship. If you cannot know the estate of the soul before hand / you can make
no forms of words for yt. ^* Argu*
Read prayers were devised by Antechrist, and maintain supers^ition and an
Idol ministry: therefore read prayers and such stinted service are
intolerable etc.

G. Gi^^ford.
Antichrist devised many blasphemous wicked prayers. But to say that the
reading or following a prescript form of prayer was his, is most false, for
there were Liturgies in the Church of old, before Antichrist was set in his
throne etc.



THe Scripture never enforced to read prayers for praying / nether stinted v^
what / or how many words to use / nether is the forms of prayer prescribed
in the Scripture / any devise of man. I. Greenwood.
Let us then hold these two to be the matters in hand / the one / reading in
stead of praying / the other / stinting and limiting by a written liturgy,
what and how ^anie words to pray / with all other such prescriptions as your
liturgy conteyneth. All may be affirmed antichristian which is not warranted
by Christ's word: Yet your liturgy, is eue^ from that Antichrist lifted up
into the throne you speak of / as may of all men be seen that will compare yt
with the Portuis: And (as I have heard) the Pope would have approved of your
liturgy, if yt might have been received in his name. Now we have proved in
the discourse before / that reading for praying has no warrant from Gods Word
/ which makes them two several and diverse actions every where.

Here then we must consider something for an other liturgy, the^ Christ's
Testament / which we shall find to be nothing else / then an other gospel. And
because Mr. Gifford says there were liturgies in the Church before Antichrist
was lifted up into his throne (which I will not deny) I would have all men
understand that I do not go about to prove the Church no Church that has a
liturgy (as mine Arguments are falsely wrested to that purpose) but to prove
the vnlawfullnes og such liturgies thrust upon men's Consciences / is only my
determination through Gods assistance. The word liturgia signifies publicum
munus, ergon Laou, the worck of / or for the people: that is the very execution
of the m^nisteriall actions in the Church / according to the word / of all the
officers thereof that is the practice of those ministerial duties prescribed by
Christ / we may every where read. In the first of the Gospel of Luke the 23.
verse it is said. And it came to pass that when the days of his ministration
were past he went home to his house, meaning Zacharias: where we see the word
Leitourgia for his execution of his ministerial function. Now this Leitourgia
of the new Testament / is even the rule and function prescribed by Christ /
for the public actions to be done in his Church: which leiturgie of Christ
is perfect / Gal 1.8.2 Heb. 22.18.19 2. tim 1.13 1 timothy 6.14
and he pronounced accursed that adds any thing thereto / or takes any there
from: yea all me^ are bound to keep the true pattern thereof / without
alteration or innouating any part of the same: yt is called a commandment to
be kept without spott / till the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now / to
make an other leiturgie, is to lay an other foundation / and to make an other
Gospel / not that there is an other Gospel / but that there are some willing to
pervert the Gospel of Christ. The^ your leiturgies to which you are sworn /
and by which you administer / being (as you cannot deny) an other leiturg^e
the^ Christ's Testament / is plain an other Gospel / for the Canons and rules
you prescribe and impose are such as he has not prescribed or commaanded / or
at the best / a transforming of his ordinances / Now if you should say / you do
nothing but make laws of particular things collected from the scriptures /
and with that color impose your liturgies, we have showed the vnlawfullnes of
bringing any man's writings / as rules into the Church. For the explaning of
the whole will of Christ / so far as is meet for us / he has given us his
officers to administer / according to his liturgy by lively voice / and due
execution of all things by one rule. Making then a new litourgia, you must
also make a new ministry / for Christ's ministry cannot administer after a
counterfeit liturgy. And that Antichrist was the theif Innouator of this
liturgy (howsoever the thing might be long a working by little and little) yt is
plain when he is called Antikeimenos, 2. Tes. 2.4
that opposite man / or laier of an other foundation Now we must not make all
liturgies beside the Testament / of like wickedness or blasphemy / But how
near the most heynousest yours approach / let him that answers the other
part of your book witness unto me.

Now where I said you had confessed that you never read in the Scriptures any
warrant to read prayers unto God / you say now / I know I have falsified your
words. Surely yt would be known / for I would not willingly so do / your
words you say were these / to your remembrance: God never commanded a man to
read prayer upon the book: Is not this the same that I say: you confess
there is no warrant for reading prayer, is there any thing warranted in his
worship / that he has not commanded? Then you ask me if I will gather thus /
is it not express commanded / therefore yt is not warra^ted. No you forgot the
word expressie / to help your self to say and vnsaye. I gathered / that
because you said absolutely it was not commanded / therefore yt was not
warranted. Here you come again to show your ignorance in the Scriptures / to
say there is not any express commandment to use prayer before or after
doctrine. And remember / you here will have it a commandment / and said
before you hold yt not of necessity. G. Gifford.
There would sundry inconveniences grovve for want of a Liturgy, or prescript
forms of public prayers.

I. Greenwood.
STill I must put you in mind of the wisdom of that governor of his house /
the builder / beginner and finisher of our Faith Christ Jesus: he foresawe what
inconuenie^ce would have grown if either me^ or Angels should make new
liturgies, or other forms of prayer / the^ he has prescribed / for the
public assemblies. Here therefore you deeply chardge him / not to have done
all things that were needful / in not prescribing you more forms then he
has done / or not suffered learned divines to impose their own writings upon
public assemblies / as rules for the Church / and worship unto God. But see
what the Scripture says / who has known the mind of the Lord, ^ Cor 2.16
(...) 2.20 /
that he might instruct him. Again* where is the wise, where the Scribe, where
the disputer of this world, has not God made the wisdom of this world
foolishnes? To put you out of doubt then / that we need not any new liturgy
/ nor any men's writings to be brought into the public assemblies / the
Holy Ghost says / 2. Timot. 3.16. The whole Scripture is Theopneustos,
inspired of God / and profitable unto doctrine / unto improof / unto correction
/ unto erudition which is in righteousness / that the man of God may be absolute
/ perfect fully furnished unto every good work. Now if only the Scriptures
be Theopnestos, and sufficient to make Gods children absolutely perfect / even
fully furnistied to every good worck / what blasphemy is yt to say / sundry
inconveniences would grow / if men's writings were not imposed upon the
public assemblies?

And in this your wisdom / let us see what is the chiefest inconuenie^cy that
would grow. You say every fra^ticke spirit (of which sort there be many in
the ministry) would not only be unlike themselves / but vary from others. I
answered / and still do / that the Papists have not so weak a reason for their
Idolatrous liturgies / Rubricks, and Canons. You say yt appears by all my
Arguments / how meet a man I am to judge the weight of reasons alleged by
the Papists / and others: well I am weak / and you strong / foolish / and you
wise / yet might you have showed me a weaker reason which they allege for
their constitutious ecclesiastical / as they call them. But my chief answer
was (whereby you might have been satisfied) that if it were but in Phrases the
ministry should differ / yt is no sufficient cause to ordeine liturgies. And
if they offend in matter of doctrine or conversation / the censure of the
Church should help that. The first you grant / the second also you confess /
that the Church should censure such things: But you say there are sundry other
differences in administration of public prayers and Sacraments as in order
and ceremonies which the Church is to have regard of / and not to leave
arbitrarie. All other ceremonies in Gods worship then Christ and his Apostles
have prescribed us / are diabolical / and not Apostolical. Then / for all
things done in the Church in those public actions / the offenders must be
admonished / if they transgress the rules of the word. And for the orers you
speak of / you mean circumstances of time / place / kneeling / sitting /
standing etc. of them thet can be no further laws / then Christ has prescribed
/ that all things be done to edifying / in comelyues and decency etc. of these
to set particular laws / were to break the law of God / which leaves them
in the Churches liberty as need requires / to the glory of God. In these
things to do any thing contrary to the general rules of order / edifying /
decencye etc. the tra^sgressour is by those rules to be instructed / admonished
and ce^sured.

Well / here you have made a fair hand / to make read prayers but a matter of
order / which is all the worship you have / to bring in men's writings into the
public assemblies / to make then either rules to bind the conscience / and so
put them in the place of Gods book / or to read them over for praying / is
but a matter of order / well then put them in your cornerd Capp / we have
enough rules for the ordering of Christ's spouse / without such Babilonish ware.
Here you say mine experience is not so great as my boldness. I pass not to be
judged of you / yt is not like that the enchaunters of egypt should know the
beautye of Sion: there is a cloud between you and us: we have (blessed be our
God) a pillar of fire before us. An other fault you say in my former reason /
is / that because the censure of the Church should redress defaultes /
therefore there needs no liturgy. Nay take all with you: No fault ca^ be
censured that is not a transgression against the rules of Gods word, and those
to be censured by the doctrine and admonitions of the Church, the^fore we need
no leiturgies. To the word of God only / ought all me^ to be bound by
covenant / and for the transgressions thereof only / to be censured.


G. Gifford. The Church has this power, to ordeine according to Gods word,
and to appointe such orders in matters of circumstance etc. as shall most fitly
serve to edification. And then these orders being established the Church is to
drive men to the observation of them.


I. Greenvvood. FIrst / in this your papisticall mudde / I must tell you / your
reading of men's writings for prayer / is a false worship of God / and not a
matter of circumstance, And for matters of order and circumstance / which are
no part of the worship / there can be no other laws made of the^ / the^ Christ
has made: As for ordeyning of laws in the church / it is to plead for
unwritten verities / and to make the law of God vnsufficie^t: nether ca^ yt be
according to the word / to make any law / that God has not made / but an
adding to his word / which is execrable pride: these your words then
(according to Gods word) was but a cloak to cover the grosseues of your
position: for the word / ordeyne / or create laws / is to make some / that
are not made before: let us the^ see your clean sentence to be this / The
Church has aucthority in matters of order and circumstance to make and ordeine
laws in his Church* for his worship: now see how you contradict these
Scriptures. Rev. 22.18.19. Prove. 30.5.6. every word of God is pure etc. put
nothing to his word least he reprove thee and thou be found a liar. likewise
Deuteronomy. 4.2. and 12.32. and Gal. 3.15. though it be but a man's covenant / when it
is confirmed / no man does abrogate it / or superordeine any thing to it. And
the second Commandment forbids any such humane tradition in the worship
of God: all the Popes trinckets might be brought in by the same ground: We
would willingly have seen your warrant for this doctrine / your bare word is
not sufficient to impose other laws then God has made / upon his Church. This
is the foundation of popery and Anabaptistrie / to give liberty to make laws
in the worship of God. Yet you will go further / that such laws being ordained
and established by public auctoritye / the discipline and censures of the
CHVRCH are to drive men to the observation of the same. By your judgment our
Savior CHRIST was an Anabaptisticall Schismatique / that would not himself /
nor his Disciples / obey and observe the traditions of the Elders: And what
says he unto pleaders for traditions. It is thus written Mark 7.5. the^ asked
him the Pharisees and the Scribes, why walk not thy disciples according to the
tradition of the elders, but eat meat with unwashed hands. The^ he answered,
surely ISAY hat prophesied well of you hypocrites, as it is written* this
people honoreth me with their lips but their hearts are far from me. But
they worship me in vain, teaching doctrines men's precepts. For you lay the
commandment of God aside and observe the tradition of me^.

And to help fourth your evil matter / instead of proof from the scripture /
you fall out into furious exclamation against them that desire only to have the
word practiced: saying / who is able to imagine the innumerable divisions and
offenses in the practice of your anabaptisticall freedom / in which you deny
the Church to have power to ordeine and impose any orders? let all men judge
the venemousenes of this tongue / Christ pronounces them accursed that add or
super ordeyne any thing to his word / and you pronounce judgment of them /
that only obey his word. Shall yt be said that Mr. Gifford holds / that the
only practice of Gods word / would be the cause of innumerable divisions and
offenses? This has been Satan's old accusation in the mouth of the most enemies
of Christ's Gospel: now yt must be Mr. Giffords accusation of Gods ordinances
/ to be insufficient ^ imperfect / etc. fearful is his Apostasy from that
truth he has known. I take it / yt is more like to be Anabaptistry / to
practice any thing without warrant of the word / to make their own devises
laws / in Gods worship / then to do nothing but what God has commanded /
within the limits of our callings.

For the fra^ticke ministry / yt came of your own words / that therefore you
must needs have a liturgy, because there are many fra^tick spirits in the
ministry? then I say / it is like you have a frantic ministry / that
cannot be governed without an other liturgy then Christ's Testament: For their
great gifts you speak of: I will not compare with them.

My reason from the Colossians was that as the church there is commanded to
admonish their Pastor Archippus / if he transgressed / and to stir him up to
his business / so all minister^ that caused divisions / contrary to the doctrine
of Christ / were to be admonished / and avoided / if then repent not: so that
the word of God / and admonition by the same / if they transgressed / is the
way to keep all men in due order / and not imposing liturgies upon the church
/ besides Christ's Testament.

And where you collected thus / that if read prayers / and imposed liturgies be
Idolatrous / the^ where will you find a visible church / say you. I answered
that the true Church might err / even in this point / though not in like
height of sin. Then you desire / that the churches of England may find lik^
favor at our hand: M. Barrowes refutation discovery, etc.
to which I answer / let him that handles that question with you / show you
/ how your sins herein exceed other countries / and persequ^t such as
reprove you. Your church (as you call yt) cannot plead ignorance. Your railing
speeches / of blind Schismatiques / Donatists etc. bewray what sweet water is
in the heart: if you cannot prove your church to be the established church of
CHRIST / they light all upon your self. There are none Schismatiques, but such
as depart from the faith / show wherein we have transgressed / and will not be
reformed. In the mean time you are Schismatiques from Christ / in that you
practice the Statutes of omry. You chardge us with pride / for that (you say)
we imagine to know more then all the Churches upon earth. This also has been
Satan's old weapon to deface the truth Iere. 18.18. why may not a simple babe
in Christ see that / which whole nations have not seen? we cannot but speak
the things GODS Word teaches us: if we speak truth / you need not oppose
that we judge any man / yt is the word of God shall judge us all / and I say
/ yt is an old popish Argument to reason thus (all Churches do such a thing /
therefore it is lawful) except you hold with the Pope / that the Church cannot
err / which were blasphemous. You are not well pleased that I will not say it
is no Church that has a liturgy imposed upon yt / and because you have so
often sclandered me / that I hold yt so / you take great pains to conclude it.
I have said that to impose men's writings / to be read in stead of praying / is
to worship God after a false manner / that yt is a devise of Antichrist / a
dead letter / quenching the spirit / not of faith / Idolatrous is changing the
work of the spirit into an Idol / breauing our Christian liberty / and so
most detestable. By these speeches I condemn al churches say you: this is not
true / I condemn but the sin. But you have said I deny that to be the Church
/ that has any thing ymposed, I say you speak an open untruth / and remember
the judgment of him that inuenteth and makes lies: And God give you grace to
repent / if you belong to him. The consideration of this our discourse / I
hartelie comme^de to be duly and uprightly wayed / of all that fear God / who
grant us his grace to forsake any sin / where it shall be showed us / by how
weak instruments soever yt be reproved / and pardon me all my defaults / in
this my hasty answer. Thus have we seen the vnlawfullnes of thrusting men's
writings upon public assemblies / and reading instead of praying.


A general Argument against their worship, in respect of their present
estate, both of Ministers and people.
The prayers of such ministers and people, as stand under a false government
are not acceptable, not only because they ask amiss, but because they keep
not his Commandments:

The prayers of such ministers and people as be subject to Antichrist are
abominable:

Those ministers and people which stand subject to the Bishops and their
Courts, are subject to Antichrist etc. Therefore their prayers etc.

G. Gifford. These do oncerne the third and fourth accusation, and therefore the
answer is included in the answer to them, Yet I take exception against the
first, that the Church may be holden by force from executing Gods commaundemens
touching external government, and yet be the true Church of Grd, I alleged
the Church that was holden captive in Babylon etc.


I. Greenvvood. HEre / after your acustomed manner / you offer me great wrong:
first / insteade of answer / you alter the question very subtylie: then you
dismember my former answer / and not only so / but you have nether let my
former a^swere be a^swered / nor prynted. Thus you alter the question / and
answer not / where the Proposition speaks of a ministry and people
standing under a false government / you say the Church may be holde^ up force /
from executing Gods commandments in external government / whereof I never
doubted: what is this then / but to deceive your Reader / both to judge
sinisterlie of me / and be drawn from the truth himself? But indeed you mean
not this (holden by force) of civil bondadge or persequution / for then there
were no difference between us / and mine Argument should stand untouched. You
affirm then that the Church may stand under a false government / enforced
thereunto by the tyranny of the ennemie / and yet in that estate be the true
apparent Church / by open profession / which is nothing / else / then that the
Church may profess Christianisme and Antichristianisme / both at a time /
subject in mind to Christ / and subject to Antichrist in outward obedience.
That you hold this doctrine in this place / the process of your matter proves
/ and to make all plain / your words in the last writing (which here you
sum up) were these. But if the Church at any time be by main force
restrained from some privileges, or have some government set over it, which
agrees not with GODS word, which it cannot avoid etc. See now how smoothly
this man has put away the cross of Christ / by teaching men to stand under a
government / contrary to Christ's. I thought the ordinances of the new
Testament had been a kingdom that could not be shaken. Heb.: 2.28. that none
could have been a member of Christ / Rev. 14.9 10.11.1^^
that receaueth the marcke of the Beast / though yt be but in his hand / or
could be holden a member of Christ / by outward profession / that here had
been the patience of the Saints / to suffer unto death / rather then to bow
down / either in mind or body to an other government / then Christ's. How is
he a Lord to them that are not governed by him? Well I needed not have stand
upon this doctrine / but that he nether prynted my former answer / nor
answered in these points / and mine own copy taken from me by the Bishops:
so that this man may retract what he will and accuse as please him: if he have
any common honesty / let my former answer be seen.

But to prove the Church may be subject to an other government then Christ's /
which is even to say / that a man may give all allegiance by outward practice
to the King of Spaigne / and yet be her Man* true subject / He says / the
Church was holden captive in Babylon / where he as conningly hides himself as
before / though in my last writing I urged him to answer / whether the Church
in Babilo^ was subject to their Idolatry / or no. To the civil power I doubt
not they were: But if the Priests and Levites stood Priests to the Idolatrous
worship in Babylon / whether the people of Israel bowed down to the outward
practice and obedience of their Idolatry / or no: then / if they did so /
whether they stood by profession the children of God / or apostatate in that
estate None of these things have you answered me. Let the examples of Hanania
/ Mishaell / and Azarin testify Dan. 3. The people that returned repented
their transgressions / where they had any of them sinned / and made a new
covenant with the Lord / before they were received / Ezra 9.14.15. and 10.
Cap. 2.3.8. Yea the voice of God was this / come out of her my people / and
touch no unclean thing and I will be your God. We are before thee (says Ezra)
in our trespass / and we cannot stand before thee because of it. Esa 52.11
Jerem 51.6.45.
You never renounced your Antichristian ministry / you never made new
covenant since the deep defectio^ of Poperye / but still minister in that
kingdom / and will not repent / yet boast your selves to be the Church of God /
cryinge out / the Temple the Temple. I answer then directly / that whiles
you stand subject unto / and practice and communicate with other orders and
governments / then Christ's / you are not by outward profession the Churches
of Christ. I may not with you omit the word (wilful) because you persequute
the light / and so much higher is your sin. Here I must forewarne the Reader
/ with diligence to consider Mr. Giffords disagreement and mine / he having
accused me of a fundame^tall heresy (as he calls it) whereas he himself still
maintayneth most gross errors / where of I reproved him / yet he persisteth /
Namely / that the regenerate man may be said to stand in bondage to sin / by
reason of the corruption of the flesh that is in us / and of our imperfectness
in this life. Then / that one standing in outward bondage to open known sin
/ may in that estate be accounted and communicated with / as the servant of
Christ by outward profession / both at one instant: which is as much to say / we
may be to ma^s sight / the servant of the devil / and the servant of Christ
/ both at one time / by outward profession: so none should be excommunicate:
none be without / te world and the church light and darcknes / Christ and
Belial / should be mingled together.

The heresy whereof / he most unjustly and untruly proclaymeth to be mainteyned
by us / is / that the regenerate man consents not to sin / after
regeneration / although in the last writing I testified the contrary: Namely
that the whole church might err / might co^mitt some kind of Idolatry / that
no man was free from committing sin etc. And now I testify to all the world
/ that I was never infected with any such Anabaptistry, but have every where
resisted such dannable heresy. I have learned and taught many degrees of
sin / and differences of tra^sgressions / which the dear children of God
fall into / after regeneration / in thought word and deed / of ignorance / of
knowledge / of presumption / slippes / transgressions / and obstinate sin:
Yea that there is no sin / except ehe sin against the Holy Ghost / but Gods
children / may co^mitt it after regeneration / and be renewed by repentance /
which we ought to pray for in all sinners / but that one sin except. Not that
men should hereupon take boldness to sin / because God gives repentance to
his elect / wherein the riches of his mercy appears / but rather serve him in
trembling and fear / as a jealous God / least with Esaw we find no place to
repentance / though we seek yt with tears. Again / though in Gods sight /
his elected are never forsaken utterly / nor the Holy Ghost utterly
extinguished in the repenerate / yet to man's judgment he that commits open
known sin / and persisteth obstinatly in the same / cannot be held the child
of God to us / by outward profession / but must be cut of Nombers 15.27.31.
Math. 18.17. and 1. Cor. 5. till they repent: Much more none that stand open
professed members of te false church / subject by the least outward bowing
down to this antichristian Hierarchy, and so continuing in bondage to a false
government / ca^ be holde^ of us te true professors of Christ's Gospel. Now let
us peruse te several doctrines. Mr. Gifford affirms / that the true church
migt stand in bondage to a false government / yet in that estate be held / and
communicated with / as the true Church / by outward profession: his words in
way of proof / be these. They may with St. Paul say / it is no longer I that
do it / but sin that dwells in me: for if the yoke wherewith he was held
captive in part / could not take from him / but that he was the Lords free
servant / it is no reason that some outward bondage should make the Church
not to be the spouse of Christ. If a man command his wife (says he) to do a
thing / and there be violent force to withhold her / she is not to be blamed.
Romans 7. Mine answer to this he durst not print / but peruerteth my words / so
many as pleases him / nether can I yet come by a copy of my former writing
to show / what I the^ replied. Now consider what gouernmnet is / and what
bondage is / and then behold the wickedness of this man: Spiritual government is
that souereigntie / Dominion: and regiment that Christ Jesus / by his spirit /
laws / ordinances / and officers / exercises in and over his church / as yt
is written: And thou Bethlee^ Judah art not the least among the Princes of Judah,
for out of thee shall come a governor that shall govern my people Israel.
again / thy Scepter is an uer lasting Scepter. I have set my king upon Syon my
Holy mountain, Mat. 2.6. Psa. 2. and 45. and 110. these laws and ordinances
whereby this king reigns / are caled a kingdom that cannot be shaken Heb.
12.28. Mal 12.6
they that have not him to reign over the^ / are by outward profession none of
his. If I be your lord, where is my honor? again those mine enemies which
would not that I should reign over the^, bring bether, and slay the^ before
me. Luke 19.27 Also bondage or servitude is to be al commandment / and to
yield obedience in subjection. Now to be in outward bondage to an other outward
government / other laws / officers / and ordinances then Christ's / is to be by
outward subjection servantes of Antichrist / which lays an other foundation:
for by outward profession we cannot stand (to man's judgment) professed subjects
to two kings at enimitye / But we must be an enemy to the one / and so
esteemed of all me^ / much less members unto two diverse heads.

This then is mine answer here. 1. That it is an heresy to say a man may
stand in bondage to open known sin / and the free servant of Christ to us
by outward profession / both at one instant. 2. That it is a falsifying of the
Scripture / to say that St. Paul (in the 7. to the Romans) was in bondage to
sin / when he / in the inner man resisted sin / and daily prevailed
against the sin / which his flesh would have led him captive in / if there
had not been a stronger power to overcome that enemy. For he there reasons
of the benefit of the law / to manifest our sin / and our conquest over
sin by daily repentance / and reproving of sin in our selves / fighting
against sin / victory over sin / though yt contynuallie rebel. 3. How
blasphemous were yt to continue in known sin / in bondage to yt / and to say
/ it is sin that dwells in us / and not we / and so still to bless our
selves without amendment. O horrible peruertinge of the Scriptures to men's
destruction. 2. Pet. 3.16.4. That there is no Argument to be drawn / nor
consequence to follow / from the relics of sin / and corruption of the
flesh in one man / or the whole Church / and a professed bondage to al false
government: no not between the open committing of sin in the whole Church /
or some m^mbers thereof / and a professed homage and subjection unto a false
government / we cannot be partakers with the false Church and true / at no
hand. 1. Cor. 10.21 / 5. Lastly / that the subjection to an other government
/ is as a wife that commits adultery. Hosea 2.

I then reason thus on the contrary with you. Any man that after regeneration
commits open known sin / and contynueth obstinate / as a bond servant
thereunto / stands not the professed servant of Christ / but of sin
Ezechiel. 18. till he repent / so the whole Church / that persisteth in open
known sin / and persequuieth the messengers that reprove the same. Then / as
every member of the false Church stands a professed servant of sin / so
the whole assemblies that stand professed subjects of false government / no
censures sf admonition belonging unto them / but calling of them to repentance
and separation from the false Church. Then / as the wife that gives her self
to be one with an other man / is an adulteress Romans 7.3. so that Church that
subiecteth herself to an other government / ordinances / and laws then Christ's
/ is an harlot. Now let all men say / whether I had not just cause to say /
you spoke like a carnal libertine / and an Athiest* yea now / as one having
his conscience ^eared / to affirm / that the Church / remayninge in open know
bondage to a false government / may say as Paul said / it is not I that sin.
And / that contynuing in that adultery / she is the spouse of Christ by
outward profession. You would say it were a false Argument / to say / the
Church has many imperfections / ignorances / transgressions etc. therefore
stands in bondage to sin / nay stands in bondage to an other head / and
an other government then Christ's / Even so / to say the Church does sin /
therefore may continue in bondage to sin / is false doctrine: nay / to say it
may stand in open professed subjection to Antichrist / and be esteemed the
CHURCH of CHRIST by outward profession in that estate / is damnable doctrine.

It is the flat contradiction of all the rules of the Scripture / to say / a
man may stand in bondage to sin / and the free servaunt^ of Christ by outward
profession / by man's judgment / at one time / seeing the obstinate offenders are
to be cast out of the assembly: But now / though the regenerate may fall into
these high sins / and continue in their sin a long time / yea many years
deprived of GODS grace / to man's seeming / and to us is the servant of Satan
for any thing we see / yet the Spirit of GOD is never utterly extinguished
or departed / after regeneration / but will recover the man again / and bring
him to repentance / as David after a whole year / for the strong man once
displaced and cast out by a stronger then he / the spirit never utterly
departs again / for then yt were impossible that man should be renewed Mat.
1.2.31. Heb. 10.26 and 6.4.

And hereupon I might say / Paul never continued captive in sin / but was
always renewed by repentance. Further / this spirit of God (the sparks whereof
were never quenched utterly) did not / nor could not consent or give place
unto sin / for here is the enimitye and battle between the spirit and the
flesh / every where spoken of Gal. 5,16.17. Romans 7. May I not now say then /
that Paul never continued captive unto sin / nor consented unto sin
concerning the Inner man or gave place unto sin in that place mentioned /
without heresy: And still reprove you / that when Paul reasons of the old
man / or corruption in him / you will conclude yt of the new man / or inner man
/ and of the whole man / when you see evidently / he opposes the one against
the other: For whiles the spirit strives against sin / and reigns in us /
though the flesh rebel / and cause us to sin seven times a day / yet are
we not overcome of sin / so to remain in bondage to sin / that it should
continue to reign in us / as you may see in the same chapter Romans 7.5.6. Where
you allege then / that Paul saw a law in his members / which did lead him
captive unto sin / you do falsify the text: for he says leading me captive
/ and not did lead etc. for there was a stronger man / or a stronger then man /
that suffered not the law of his members to reign: for says he / I my self
in my mind serve the law of God / but in the flesh the law of sin / so that
the whole man could not be said to serve sin. But (say you) afterward as
concerning then the inner man we may be said to serve the law of God / and
thereupon be called the free servants of Christ / notwithstanding this
corruption of sin in the flesh: So the whole man by reason of our
imperfectnes may be said to be the servants of sin. No / yt is not true / for
the whole man is called after the part thath hat greather rule in us: as if the
flesh rule in us / we are the servaunts of sin / and ledd by Satan at his
pleasure / but if the Spirit rule in us / we are the servants of God / Sons
of God / Saints of God / Citizens of Jerusalem / holy and free people /
Kings / and Priests: not that we are perfect / or sin not / but that sin
reygneth not in us / but the spirit / whereby we suppress sin / reprove sin
/ strive against sin / subdue sin / and though we fall seven times / yet we
rise again by repentance / and serve not sin. Rightly therefore did I say /
that no man can serve two masters: for his servantes we are to whom we give ^
our selves as servants to obey / whether yt be of sin / unto death / or of
obedience / unto righteousness. Romans 6.16.18. being made free from sin / we
are made the servantes of righteousness: So that the regenerat man / or he that
is by outward profession the servant of Christ / cannot be called the servant
of sin / by reason of the co^^uption of the old man / and dregs of sin /
neither can he that stands in bondage to any sin / and gives himself over
to yt / be called in that estate the servant of Christ / till he repent / but
the servant of sin. 2. Pet. 2.19.

Therefore you must recant your false interpretation of Paul in the 7. to the
Romans and cease your blasphemous raylings / in calling the truth of God / the
rock of Brownisme. And consider the height of your sin / by concluding a
bondage unto sin of the wholeman / for the corruptions of the flesh / which
through the work of the Spirit is daily subdued / though never utterly rooted
out of our earthly members: and from the committing sin through frayltie /
an obstinate professed bondage to the false Church / false government / false
ministry etc. which is plainly the marck of the Beast / to whom with outward
obedience they bow down / and stand servants in his kingdom Revel.
14.9.11.12.

As for the 4. of the Galat. 26. where the Apostle says / Jerusalem which is
above is free with her Children / yo udurst not open yt / nor expound yt / but
blaspheame / rail / and sclander / as though we should plead for such a
freedom / as should detract from Magistrates lawful aucthorities / from
having Gods ordinances established by commandment upon the Church etc. yea /
that we should hold Anabaptisticall freedom / as though we had power not to
committ / or consent unto sin whereas we have every where by practice and
protestation / by word and writing testified to our Sovereign Prince / and to
all men / the contrary. But Satan that old accuser and detracter of Gods
children / to deceive the world / sends out such lyinge spirits to deface
the truth. We / with all subjection and willinge obedience to our sovereign.
Prince / teach all men their obedience to the higher powers: Subjects to
Magistrates / Flock to Overseers / children to Pare^tes / wines to their
husbands / servantes to their Masters etc. in all things in the Lord: and if
they command us any thing contrary to the law of God / we then patiently
suffer without resistance / or rebellious thaughtes: The freedom then we have
to speak of here / which Christ has purchased for us / is / first that
triumph over Hell / Death / and damnation / through the merits of Christ
apprehended by faith / waited for in hope / Romans 8. Secondly / that because we
were sons by election / he gives us the spirit of adoption / and
sanctification / wherebie we mortify the flesh / have reign and dominion
over sin / that yt shall never reign in us more unto condemnation /
repenting daily our trespasses / and craving pardon for our hidden sins /
and secret faults. Thirdly / we are through the same spirit and word of
truth delivered from all subjection of Antichist / of the false Church / false
ministry / false government etc. And. they that have not this freedom / are
not by outward profession the servants of Christ. Further / we have freedom
from all traditions of men that seeing we are bought with a price / we are no
longer servants of men / to be in bondage to any beggarly rudimentes or
devises of me^ / but in all peaceable manner / to worship and serve God within
the limits of our callings / according to the word of God / as yt is revealed
unto us: We have freedom to speak the truth with all boldness / though all
men should inhibite us: we would not have the doctrine limited / stinted /
bought and sold / for Iewishe tithes or mercenarie stipendes.

We have freedom to separate from such false* Prophetts as your self / to come
out of Babel etc. And in the true Church to reprove and withstand any sin or
traditions of me^ in due order / only to be guided and governed by Christ's
laws and ordinances: In all this I trust you shall not find any Anabaptistrie
in the freedom we profess: this is the truth of the Gospel / wherbie we are
made free.

Thus then we still affirm / that they which stand in open known bondage to
sin / are the servants of sin / and not of CHRIST / till they repent / by
outward profession. Further / that allwhich stand members of your parish
assemblies / stand not members of CHRIST by outward profession / but in bondage
to a false and Antichristian ministry / government / worship etc. and the bond
woeman and her son must be cast out. Further / for all liturgies, and other
devises of me^ besides the canonical Scriptures and lively graces of his
Spirit / we hold they ought not to be brought into the public assemblies /
nor imposed upon men's consciences: But if any will write such / or read such
/ let yt be for their private use / as all other men's writings: we despise not
any directions by word or writing / that may further us any way to the practice
of GODS ordinances / yet may they nether be imposed upon men's consciences / not
be made a part of GODS worship.

The Lord therefore that has thus far fourth discovered the ^haff and mist of
Antichrists delusions / even to babes and sucklings / publish the glorious
light of his blessed Gospel / that the people may see the counterfeit
iuglinges of all such false Prophetts / and come out from amongst them / that
you may be ashamed of your execrable wares / and forsake your Romish
Priesthood / and give glory to God / that yet offers grace. Amen.


Christ's unworthy witness for the truth of his Gospel JOHN GREENVVOOD.

FINIS.
A Few observations of Mr. Giffards last cavills about stinted read prayers /
and devised Leitourgies.
HAving hertofore written an answer to Mr. George Giffards pretended defense
of stinted read prayers and devised Leitourgies / and since received an empty
reply / wherein he does nothing less then yield to any sound reason alleged /
but ungodly cauilleth at and peruersly wresteth the sense of so much as he
touches / I seeing no cause of further strife (his former convinced) to
intermedle again with particular handling of his chafe and smoke / his
reasons in effect the same before a^swered / have only thought it my duty to
illustrate unto the Readers / some few brief poincts abused by him / that they
may the better be able to judge of the former writings / where unto with these
few helps following I refer the trial.

Whereas I alleged out of the 8. to the Romans and out of the 4. to the Galath.
that in the very time and action of our praying to God / the spirit of God was
the only help / no other help mentioned or that can be collected in the
Scriptures / Mr. Giffard having granted that reading prayer is not praying /
does now answer / that howsoever the Scripture does extol and magnify outward
helps and means, yet when they are compared with God which works all in all
by them, or when the Scripture will set forth the efficacy and work to be his
alone, they are either not mentioned, or else if they be mentioned, so cast
down, as if they were nothing. God buyldeth his Church (says he) by the
ministry of men, yet Paul is said to plant, Apollos to Water, but God to gyve
the increase 1. Cor, 3. and therefore to gather from those places Romans 8. Gala*
4. that there need or may be no outward help or means in the very action and
instant of praying, is far awrye. In which answer it evidently appears he is
so bent to turn away all truth and raise new strife / as there can be no
expectation of agreement: There is no sequence / neither does the scripture
alleged prove his own reason / so that nothing ha^gs together. No man
doubts but that sometimes and in some places of scripture the outward means
of begetting and increasing faith is only recited / and sometimes the secret
work of Gods spirit only / sometimes both / when yet they are not divided but
go together / and all of God both inward work and outward means / though in
way of comparison I never so read / but rather the one repeated for both: For
shall I say / that when the work of God and preaching thereof is showed to be the
power of God unto salvation / that the inward work of the Spirit is therefore
not mentioned / because the other is of God? then both inward and outward
means being of God / and Gods own work / though the one by instrument / that
there is silencing of the one in way of comparison / is not true. But all this
is nothing to our matter: He should plainly have affirmed / that from these
places Ro^. 8. and Gal. 4. it cannot be proved / that in the very instant time
and actio^ of owre praying to God / the spirit only instructs / without
outward helps of instruction / and he should have seen I could prove (as the^
I did) the contrary unto him Ro^. 8.26. The spirit does together supplye or
help our infirmities for we know not what to pray as we ougt, but the spirit
yt self makes request for us with sighs and groans unutterable. In the actio^
of praying the spirit is here set down in this place to be the means and help
of instruction / teaching us to ask aright / no other means or helps of
instruction in that instant time and action of praying mentioned in this or any
other place of scripture: Therefore in the time of our praying and laying our
hearts open to God / the Spirit only does instruct and opens our mouth. In
this place let the word synan^ilambanetai be well considered. Again Gal. 4.6 it
is said because ye are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into your
hearts crying, Abba, Father, The Argument here is the same thet before: this
word ( crying) shows the work of his Spirit or rather office / in our
continual occasions of prayer to direct us to unburden and unfold the heart /
so that in the instant action we see no other. And where I showed him that
reading in the actio^ of praying could not be caled an help of instruction at
that time when we were pouring forth our hearts unto God / the eyes and hands
lift up to heave / our meditation fixed upon our known occasions / and heart
and mouth unfolding the^ / my reason this / That the mind and body could not
be intent upon two diverse distinct and several exercises and duties of mind
and body at one time and instant / he inverteth my words / and steals the^
as a new shift to help him self (as he supposes) returning the^ thus in way of
question / demanding whether fasting / lifting up our eyes and hands to heaven
/ prostrating the body and kneeling be prayer yt self / or outward means and
helps to make the prayer more ferve^t. Every simple man will laugh at him
(says he) if he make the^ prayer ytself: and if they be helps / the^ I have
brought the former proofs not from an idle / but from an unsound brain. Leave
scorning and reproach / and consider what helps we did all this time entreat of
was yt not instruction of the mind by some other spiritual exercise then
prayer in praying / will he call fasting / kneeling etc. instructions of the
mind what to pray? the^ he must needs plead for his Image and al popery / if
these bodily actions and gestures be instruction of the mind / which are but
preparations to make the body serviceable and apt to and in this duty. Further
/ how learnedly he disputes to make reading one of these bodily gestures or
bodily actions only / let it be considered of. And as he co^foundeth these
bodily exercises and spiritual exercises / so he shows himself ignorant and
unable to discern spiritual gifts and exercises one from an other / with the
distinct use of them: demanding whither the voice of an other tha^ prays / be
an outward help or prayer yt self / an outward means to make our prayer more
fervent. He thinks I will be laughed at / if I say it be prayer yt self. Sure
if in any assembly / or where two or three are in Christ's name gathered
together epito^uto and homothymadon unto the same thing and with one mind /
for avoiding confusion they do use but one voice / and that by Gods order and
commandment / the others hearts going with the words and saying Amen, they
that hear pray not as well as he that according to Gods ordinance speaks /
our public prayers are not the prayers of the Church / but of him that
speaks only. But now God has otherwise taught 1. Cor. 14. and Acts. 4. yt
must needs be / that Mr. Giss. is in great error to think none but he that
speaks prays. I take then such hearing of an others voice / praying / and
this to be a foul error to publish the contrary but that prayer both edifieth
him that speaks and him that hears / and together in heart prays / I make
no doubt. Yet hereupon to affirm / that here are other means of instruction
to be used in the instant action of praying then praying yt self / were as
gross as the other / and both a confounding of spiritual exercises / and flat
contradiction of the Scripture / especially so diverse weighty actions of
mind and body / as proseuche, and anagnosis, pouring out our hearts to God in
prayer / and reading. At other times I did not only allow / but teach / that we
have all the days of our lyves need to be instructed to pray aright / and that
reading is a blessed means thereunto. So that you see whiles you of purpose
will oppose / you run your self upon the rock: in stead of justifying your
accusation of two heresies to be found in my first reason / you have published
this folly / which you must retract / if you will obey the truth. Mr. Giffard
the^ granting / that reading is but to help to prayer and not praying / and now
being showed that it ca^ be no help in that instant action of praying / let us
proceed to pervse an other of his mistakings and willful peruertings. I
affirming that the holy Ghost never enjoined us to any certain number of words
by stint and limitatio^ in praying / as commanding the very words to be said
over when we pray / he every where in his wrytings as a supposed foundation to
their Leitourgie and Collects / alleged out of Numbers the 6. Mat. 6. Lu. 11.
example of Psalms / and now Deu. 26. that the Lord did by co^ma^deme^t bind
the^ to those very words saiing over / when they prayed or blessed in those
forms which are there prescribed. For my reasons in disproving this popish
carnal co^ceipt / I refer the Reader to my former answer to his plublished
pretended defense of reading for praying. One reason was drawn from the words
of the text Numb. 6.32. where the hebrew words Coh Tebara^u, thus shall you
bless / do not import a tying the^ to the very words of this form in
blessing / but to the rules and instructions there taught them concerning the
matter yt self for their direction / which I collected by this word Coh, which
is an adverb of similitude / signifiing with us as much as (after this manner)
and therefore cannot be ^o say the same words / but according to the same
instructions. Where first he reprocheth me for that Tebaracu was false printed
/ thereupon chardging me I cannot read two words right of hebrew / which were
no great ignominy in their priesthood: But shall we say Mr. Giff. cannot read
two words in latin rightly / because in the 28. page of his book he repeateth
out of Augustine / upoli sui / for populi sui? This I mention / as sorry to see
the defendor of his false Hierarchy so empty / to leave found doctrine / and
thus to trifle: if he had been at the print / it should have been amended it
seems. Now to the doctrine gathered of this word Coh. Mr. Gif. would invert
the words in his own sense / thus: that where I said / the Lord did not
command to say the same words but the like / that is according to those
directions of doctrine / he gathers / that I should affirm yt unlawful to
use those words at all / yea that they might not use all or any of these words
at any time. Whether this be a Christian interpretation of my words or no / I
leave not only to all men's / but chiefly to his own conscience to be
considered. Yet he still covertly persisting in his error / produces a place
of scripture / where the word Coh (as he thinks) is used for the saying of
the very words. Exodus.;. The Lord said to Moses / Thus shall thou say unto the
children of Israel Eheie has sent me unto ye / moreover God said unto Moses /
thus shall thou say unto them / The God of your Fathers etc. According to Mr.
Grenewoods interpretation (says he) Moses is not commanded to say those words
/ but the like. True / he is not here bound to this certain number of words /
or the same words. If then they should say / what is his name that has sent
thee / he may not say Eheie has sent me / because God said Coh etc. Now Mr.
Giffard shows himself ashifter: I did never hold it unlawful to use any
words of the Scripture as need required / it is your sclander: where you have
in all your books affirmed we hold it unlawful to say thy kingdom come / or
use any phrase of Scripture to right use: your woeful wresting of the tongue
for untruths / will turn to your further judgment. I proved only by the word
Coh, which signifies (after this manner) that God commanded not the very
certain number of words to be said.

And where I said the word Coh was so used in all the Prophets (when they say /
Thus says the Lord) to this end / that neither the holy Ghost had registredal
their very words they spoke* nor that they were tied to the prescript number
of words / he would have it thought I should hold those words which are
recorded / not to be the words of God / which wresting of my words / is but his
empty quarreling to turn away this firm doctrine: namely / that God did in
those forms of prayer mentioned by him / prescribe the sum of their
blessings and petitions / whereunto they ought according to their several
occasions within the limits of these doctrines / frame their suites and desires
/ and did not tie them to a certain number of words. Now he finding himself
pressed / in that al his proofs are at once brought to be weapons against him
rather then warrant / It being prooved unto him that those forms are repeated
in other words in other places / and that the Priests used other in blessing
the people / as Eli blessed Hanna: also that the Apostles used other words in
prayer / and never that very form and number of words / he plainly denies
that our question was about the bynding and limiting to the very words by
commandment / and says our question was / whither it were idolatry to use
those prescript phrases or no. Thus the man is sled / not only contradicting
all his writings / making void his proofs / but granting as much as I
affirmed upon the word COH has gyven me the whole cause against ^is will: For
if these places will not serve to prove an apportioning by number and stint
upon commandment / then Mr. Gissard has no proof for his Collect^ / no though
these had been so / yet his patched broken mass book should have been far
from coming in place of true pr^yer.

But that this is a popish dream to think in prayer they were bound to some
certain number of words saying over / it was also convinced unto him by the
Greek word Houtos, where Christ commands his Disciples saying / When you
pray, pray thus, Our Father, etc. Which word Thus Mat. 6.9. singnifieth (after
this manner) or according to this form / rules / and instructions: for if the
commandment should go to bind us to the very words / then this word ( when
you pray) would bynd us never to use other words / for the text says / when
you pray, say thus. To this he answers / that respecting the rules for
matters / when is as much as whenever you pray / because we may not depart
from those matters contained in those general petitions: But in words it is not
so there / We must consider to distinguish et^3. Well / has he not lost himself
/ and still against his will yielded the matter: namely that we are not in
these forms of prayer bound to the very words saying over / and that the holy
Ghost did never by commandment stint or limit us to any words in praying /
which in deed is common with inchanters: And I take it he will easily yield me
this point / for if he remember Augustine to teach / that then we pray that
prayer which Christ taught his Disciples / when our prayers are grounded upon
those doctrines and instructions / or to that effect: And Calvine to say: the
Son of man would not prescribe us what words we must use in prayer / he
should have put us to less trouble: So that besides his mass-booke was never
prescribed by the Lord himself or warrant of his word / he sees it unlawful to
apportion / limit and stint as by measure and weight certain numbers of words
/ sentences etc. in prayer. As for his examples of the Psalms: I refer to my
former answer / namely / that praying is our thing / and singing a psalm an
other.

Now then we have heard that reading is not praying or any help to pray in the
instant action of praying / when we should power forth our own hearts to God:
Also that it is unlawful to bind man to numbers of words or sentences in
praying. Let us come to the first general argument / which is this. No
Apocrypha must be brought into the public assemblies / for there only Gods
word and the lively voice of his own graces must be heard in the public
assemblies: But men's wrytings and the reading them over for prayer are
Apocrypha: Therefore may not be brought into the public assemblies / either for
laws or worship. Here he finds fault with the word Apocrypha (although it
has been an ancient word in this sense / and now published in their Bibles to
distinguish other writings from the authentic scriptures) willing me to go
to the matter yt self / drawing by firm conclusion / that nothing is to be
allowed any place in the Church / which is not the perfect rule yt self in
writing or without error uttered in speech / and he will yield. This I did
prove unto him by an Argument he was not able to answer / and did leave out
the word Apocrypha, thus. Only the Canonical Scriptures and lively voice of
Gods own graces are to be brought into the public assemblies for doctrine and
prayer: But men's writings or Collections are neither Canonical Scripture / nor
the lively voice of Gods graces in such as he has appointed to speak in the
public asse^blies. Therefore no man's writings may be brought into nor imposed
upon the public assemblies for doctrine and prayer.

Now where he cauilleth about the perfectnes of the rule and absolute
perfectnes of the graces / it does not help him: For the word of GOD being of
necessity by the law and ordinance of God / to be read in our own language /
I trust he will not deny yt to be the written word of GOD for the imperfectness
of the translation / being (to the best search the Church can make) skanned by
the original tongue and still amended / or at least the Church no further bound
to yt / then yt shall be found to be the perfect rule: so likewise the lively
voice of GODS graces are not for the imperfectnes to be excluded / being Gods
appointed ordinance / neither is any fault in the translation to be allowed /
and error in doctrine or prayer are presently to be admonished and repented
of. Master Giffard then must deny the Bible translated into our own language
to be the Canonical Scriptures / and deny the lively voice of GODS lawful
officers / and such as are thereunto called / in doctrine and prayer / to be
the manifestations of the Spirit and utterance of Gods graces for the assembly
/ or else grant the proposition firm: And if he can put dead men's writings
into the place of either of these / I will yield. In the mean time I hold such
translations to be the word of GOD / and by Gods ordinance put into our own
language / to all our knowledges retayning the words of GOD / which word and
the lively use of Gods own graces in the mouth of such as he thereunto
appoints / are only to be brought into the public assemblies for prayer and
doctrine / for GOD has commanded these unto us as his own ordinances in his
assemblies / and no other means whereby either God speaks unto us / or his
people unto him / in the Congregation. To this all the Scriptures bear
witness / the word is always firm / confirmed with miracles from heaven / and
commended to us by Christ / the Prophetts and Apostles / to be the foundation /
Canon / light / lantern / etc. the graces of the Spirit gyven for the
interpretation / prayer / doctrine etc. Christ is ascended up into heaven / and
has given gifts unto men to serve their time and minister in their place in
this house. These graces still renewed / not only in those called of GOD in this
service for their daily administration / but new workmen thrust forth into
this harvest / as the Lord of the house disposes: which graces of his Spirit
are compared to two olive branches / which empty out of themselves through two
golden pipes. Zachary 4.12. And to seven thunders which utter their voices
that cannot be written. Away therefore with your patched mass-booke / yt may
neither stand for a foundation in Gods house / nor for the lively voices of
these thunders: you make yt a monstrous Idol by putting yt in either of these
uses / yet you will make yt serve for both. We have nothing to do with your
matters of order / as you understand that order for time / place / etc. we
reason of the Spiritual action yt self / when we entreat of the means
whereby God speaks to us / and appoints us to speak unto him. We can cast
out the errors in the translation or doctrine or prayer / and yet reeaine Gods
word in our own language / and the lively voice of his graces in the
^assemblie: When you can do so with your devises and new hatched Leitourgies
we will give ear unto you and them / till then we thinck of your counterfeit
plays and pleas for your Idols and detestable sacrilege and high
profanation of GODS ordinances with Iannes and Iambres to resist the truth.
Paraphrases we hold to be men's writings and expositions / and not the word of
GOD / nor the lively voice of Gods grace of interpretation or prayer /
therefore to be excluded this place of service unto GOD. Thus you see the
further you wrestle / the further you make your wares / the best of them /
odious to every godly conscience. You say I deceive the simple by gyuing them
one crabbe amongst many apples: but you may behold your best apples such as the
holy GHOST has foretold us Revelation. 18. to be entisements to evil: It is
well you will grant my Propositions so sound: and I would wish (if such de GODS
will) they might be better sauoured.

Now because I will not stand either repeating or contending about Syllogismes
/ I will take this much yielded of your own conclusions / which is as much in
effect as I have affirmed were you teach me thus to reason. No man's writings
are the undoubted truth of God / but have errors and imperfections: therefore
men cannot further ground upon them / then they be consonant to the Canonical
Scriptures. Again / The Church is builded upon the foundation of the Apostles
and Prophets: therefore our faith is not to rest upon men's writings. Whereupon
does necessarily follow / that if men's writings may not be builded upon nor
rested upon / how should you dream it lawful to impose them for laws upon
the public assemblies / or to have them there read to bear rule as the words
of God? And this you confessed in an other of your writings / that GOD spoke
unto us out of his undoubted word / or by his own word. If then GOD speak
not unto us by men's writings that be of private interpretation / in the
assembly / nor that they can be made groundwork to buyld our faith upon / or
to rest assured upon / yt will be granted I hope that they are not to be
imposed v^on the public assemblies as laws and rules / but left to every
man's private use in their liberty / as they will answer for themselves what
use they put them to / and whither they do not prefer them before the book of
GOD / or prejudice themselves by them. This first poinct is then plain / That
only GODS undoubted word is to be imposed / brought in / and maintained in the
public assemblies as laws and rules / no other writings being authentic or
Canonical.

But here Mr. Giffard does in effect affirm / that the word of God yt self is
not authentic or Canonical / except in the Hebrew or Greek Copy: Wherein he
goes a little beyond the Papists / that will yet allow the word of GOD in
latin: And if it should be defended / that the word of GOD were not the
word yt self that we have in our own language / it will follow that no man
could have assurance of faith / except he understood both Hebrew and Greek /
yea be able soundly to interpret the Scriptures in both. If the translations be
so far men's writings that yt cease generally to be the word of GOD that is
not written in Hebrew or Greek / and men's writings not to be grounded or
rested upon / where shall our assurance stand? And might not Mr. Giffard as
well say the Hebrew and Greek Copi^ are but paper anky^ck / many faults and
errors by the print in vowells / accents letters / and so conclude we had not
Authentic or canonical Scriptures at al / except men's erroneous writings
might be of equal authority in the assembly that the Scriptures? must he not
bear with me in accompting him an Atheist or Libertine in thus reasoning?
Hence then we see whiles you go about to abase the Canonical Scriptures / and
extol your patched Le^tourgie you fall into many blasphemies / as I have
before told you. We hold yt the word of GOD in what language soever / still
rejecting the errors in the print / in the translations etc. as they are
known unto us / and not the word y^ self for the imperfections or errors in
the translation and print. Now when you can make that which remains the
undoubted word of God / not agreeable only but an Authentic approved
Canonical Scripture / authorized from God to be the very eternal foundation
and rules / limitts and laws given by himself unto his people you may lift up
your (...) Dago^ into this place / if there be some truth in their writings (as
what men's writings have not some / and the holy name of GOD very much) yet is
that truth in the Scripture yt self and here so mingled with chafe / that it
were not only unprofitable and a hinderance of the true use of GODS word / but
an abolishing and defacing of the word yt self / the majesty whereof ought to
terrify you from this presumption.

And where you say that you decide not controversies by any translation / but
by the Authentic Copies of the Hebrew and Greek / I trust you speak only of
such as are able by the interpretation thereof so to decide controversies / and
hold it not unlawful for any such as have not that help / to convince error
by the power of the word and conferring one place with an other in any
translation / according to the analogy of faith / though I grant we ought to
use the best approved. But if this were not lawful surely no man might
prophecy in the Church / which has not the gift of interpretation of the
tongue / neither might any affirm any Scripture to be true but they which have
knowledge of tongues: How blasphemous is this g^are / whiles you are ignorant of
the power / wisdom and agreement of the word and Spirit and diversity of
gifts given unto men: The Word and the Spirit approve each other / and bear
w^^ness each of other / in what language soever GOD gives yt / to our
understanding. Prophecy and knowledge of tongues are two several gifts not
always given to one member / but distributed as God in his wisdom has
appointed. 1. Cor. 12. and prophecy commanded for the more excellent Cap. 14.
But this is sufficient in this place / that the word of God is the word of God
in what language soever / and to account yt being verbatim translated or at
least so far forth faithfully translated / man's writing / were blasphemy: but
men's writings can never be so holden the authentic Scriptures of God / how
agreeable to the wo^^ soever they be. My argument is then firm / and thus left
upon you: Those writings which be not the word of God being imperfect / and
never without error / may not be imponed as laws and Canons upon the public
assemblies / or there be read or interpreted / or offered up in worship: But
such are al men's writings that be not the authentic word of God yt self* The
public assemblies are only bound to the reading and interpretation of the
Scriptures / which God has ordained to be read in a known language / and for
prayer and prophecy has ordained the lively voice of his own graces in the
mouth of such as he has appointed to be the mouth of the Congregation unto him
and his mouth unto the^. So that your patched Leitourgie / paraphrases songs
in rhyme / homelies / and al your dead men's writings / are cast forth of the
public assemblies / and manifest to be Idols when they are thrust into that
place.

Now where I ^^ledged that the binding of the public asse^blie / yea of all
assemblies / to certain writings of men every day and year their number and
portion of words daily mo^thly and yearly in all asse^blies the same matter
and words reiterated in s^ead of pouring forth their hearts unto God according
to their present needs and occasions was a setting of themselves in Gods seat
and taking the office of his Spirit / which only knows the wantes of the
several assemblies according to their diverse occasions / he runs away from
the matter / as one unwilling to hear of this their Tautologia and counter^et
babbling / dema^ding wheter every one should utter their own particular wantes
in the public assembly / or should pray nothing but that every one feels
the present want of in himself / or should tell the Minister before hand what
every one of their wantes were* then how the Minister should remember al. Are
these any thing but m^re cauils? can any of these follow upon the former
doctrine? And let him look again / whether he that is the mouth of the
Congregation unto God in public prayer / must not consider the present public
occasions of that public assembly / and thereafter frame his prayers / all
the people joining in heart to his words of petition or thanksgiving / saying
Amen to so much as he asks according to the will of God and need of the time
/ yea and if they have not feeling in such prayers / they are unfeeling
members: yet neither does he intermedle with private or secret wa^tes / neither
need they tell him them he is sent for the public affairs of the Church / to
commend the several actions general and public / unto God: And as they are
diverse in every assembly / so must he be a man of wisdom to know / see /
and consider them / lest they al rashly step into the house of God to offer up
the sacrifie of fools / and make a counterfeit babbling Eccle. 4. Yet the sin
of this is nothing comparable to the do^ng your Priests cast forth by prattling
over your English Portuis / which the Lord will one day cast in your faces. As
then in private prayer we are to lay forth our own wantes and estate of our
own soul / which cannot be done by reading an other man's writings / always
singing one song / customably repeating in superstition certain words / our
hearts never ripped up / examined / nor the diseases thereof laid open unto God
/ seeking due cure: So the man that is the mouth of the whole assembly prays
/ as the mouth of one body / for all their open public present wantes and
occasions: Which occasions / considering the persons and actions / are diverse
and cannot be written for one assembly before hand / muchlesse for all
assemblies in a whole kingdom / neither by man nor Angel. See the^ the
mockerye of your service book / and what Idolatry is committed by yt / to the
abandoning true prayer according to the present wantes and occasion.

The next thing to be considered / is / about making of laws in the worship of
God. Where he would persuade us that their whole Leitourgie containing al their
public worship / government / offices and ordinances of their Church / be but
matters of order and conveniencie. Then the compelling and teaching the public
assembly to read over men's writings both as Canons and laws in the Church /
and publicly and privately to offer them up in stead of true prayer and holy
invocatio^ is a matter of comelines and conveniencie. In the mean time it must
be a turning away of the whole order and ordinances of God: For what is the
whole Testament of Christ but an order for every office / person / action in
the Church / if he will have it taxis and then must confess their Leitourgie an
other order of public administration / and so as I have said an other Gospel /
an other Testament / a setting up an other worship. And hereupon I trust I may
call all this an adding to the word of God / yea I will go a little further / an
abolishing and disabling and dishonoring of the word yt self and graces of his
spirit. And whither all this smoke of the bottomless pyt may not be reproved
with these Scriptures / not only Proverb. 30. verse 5.6. Deuteronomy. 4. verse. 32,
but also Revel. 22. verse 18 19. let the godly ponder and search: and let the
fearefulnes of the threats deter all flesh from presuming to alter the
ordinances / laws and worship of the most high God. And that the very reading
of an other man's writing for my own prayer / or the prayer of the Church / in
stead of pouring forth our own hearts / is a changing of the whole worship
into the making men's writing an Idol / which is by these places condemned as
an accursed sin: let the most hard text (as he in carnal wonder exclaymeth)
be looked into Revel. 22. verse 18.19. The words are plain: If any man put or
add any thing unto these / or if any man take away from these words / he
shall be judged as follows. Now if the adding an other whole Worship / and
suppressing of that God has appointed / be not an adding to these things
written / give sentence as you will answer.

O (says he) but it is said God will add unto such all the plagues written in
this book / and there is in this book mentioned the lake of fire: As though
the lake of fire is not due for every sin / and yet not every one that
commits sin to be condemned / what sin is it that deserves not the
eternal wrath of God? yet not every one that sins given over to that
judgment / for either yt may be of ignorance / or of negligence / and washed
away by repentance in the blood of Christ / or it may be repented of and lest
when we see yt. Mr. Giffard has read well the curses of the law and all the
curses due for sin that sees not how many curses the law and the Prophets
pronounced upon sin / to call the persons themselves to repentance: showing
together the equity of God^ law / and yet withal the free mercy of God to all that truly repent their evil ways. All that receive the Beasts mark in their
hand or forehead / are thretned to be cast with the Beast and false Prophet
into that lake / yet i doubt not but many that have been so seduced into that
sin / shall by repentance be saved: Not that I encourage any to continue in
such fearful estate / to harde^ their hearts against the threatenings of GOD but
that I would have Master Giffard to put difference between the curse laid to
the sin / and condemnation of the person sinning: And seeing he takes that
lake a particular severe threat to the Apostasy under ANTICHRIST / I would he
had the grace to consider how it lies upon him / whiles he speaks out of the
mouth of the Beast / if he repent not to turn from his evil ways.

Let it further be weighed how ignorantly he charge me to condemn al
Churches / for this finale examplifying of this Egiptian darkness / Idolatrous
worship / and exalting men's writings into this defacing of Gods word and true
worship / they neither being guylty of such a sacrilegious Leitourgie / as this
Egiptian Calf hatched at Rome / neither are to be presently judged no Church
for others sin / till they join obstinacy to their transgression. But shift
the matter as you will / or rather as you can appear before God / I will not
make less the sin / or the judgment due to sin / for men's persons no not
of whole Churches / if they shall be guilty therein: My desire is by discovery
of the sin / to bring men to repentance / and unto the awe of God in his
worship: who are guyltie besides your selves in such sacrilege / as to
abrogate the Leitourgy of Christ / and set up an other / or to restrain Gods
true worship and to give life to the image of the Beast / it shilleth me not:
let sin be sin / and GOD righteous / and them examine yourselves / if they
or you be clear I rejoice / neither do I thinck or can charge them with such
Idolatry as is here erected: I take it you will be found the sclanderer of
other Churches / to hide your own filthiness.

But says Mr. Giffard those Scriptures are against the adding of humane
precepts and laws to be kept as par^^s of Gods wurship to ^ind the conscience
to seek righteousness and the forgiveness of sins / or the merit of eternal
life in them / or against such rules of government as God has set to be
perpetual. In which we must take your meaning to be this / that you grant where
any humane precepts and laws be enforced as a part of GODS worship / or as
laws to bind the conscience / or when righteousness is sought in them / and
forgiveness of sins by observing of them or merit by them / or if they be
against such rules of government as GOD has let to be perpetual / if the
additions or constitutions be such as any of these then such laws and
constitutions are against the perfection of the word of God / against Christian
liberty / and in the chief things which concern Gods worship against the
ground and foundation of our faith and so a thing most detestable and accursed
/ which our Savior CHRIST refused justly to observe with the blind Pharis^is
/ wherein you have granted as much as I ever affirmed: For is not your whole
Leitournie being an other then CHRIST'S Testament your whole reading men's
writings in place and in stead of laying forth your own present wantes and
occasions in prayer to God humane constitutions / and made a part of Gods
worship? at least such pretended worship as you think good enough for him?
Weygh the matter unrightly: Again / whither your whole Antichristian
government / offices / Courts and ministry / be not constitutions and
ordinances against such rules of Christ's government as be perpetual and an
innovating of his Testament / examine / which you shall soon perceive / if you
look but what Christ's perpetual ordinances / offices / officers and laws for
the guyding / ordering and governing of his CHURCH be / prescribing every one
their place / duty and limits jointly and severally / and not find your
ministry registered there / but a strange Leitourgie and worship borrowed
from the Pope / which came out of the bottomless pit / confess your
sacrilege in suppressing CHRIST'S whole ministry and ordinances / and
erecting an other for the perpetuity of his / even to every nail and p^^n:
The holy Ghost shows that only to be his ministry / till we be all a
perfect body in him / and his whole ministry and ordinances a kingdom that
cannot be shaken. Hebre. 12. Ephesians. 4. a commandment to be kept undefiled till
the apearing of JESUS CHRIST: his Scepter an everlasting Scepter / the Son as
faithful in his house as Moses a servant in the Tabernacle / who made all
things according to the pattern: So that it is to be wondered Mr. Giffard should
think any part of Christ's government should not be perpetual / that was given
by his Apostles the master buylders and layers of the foundation / whereby all
actions should be tried to the worlds end. May not Mr. Giffard as well call into
question the perpetuite of the Testament / as the laws and rules for the
government of his Church. Now if your whole false Hierarchy / Offices /
Officers / Laws / Worship / be plainly other then Christ's / as in our other
writings are proved / and shame will inhibit you to deny / how can you be so
drunk with the cup of the Whores fornication / to think you have no
constitutions / laws or traditions / which are a part of worship / and against
such rules of Christ's government as the Apostles have prescribed for the
ordring of his house / and the same ordained for all Churches til we become all
a perfect body in him?

But if Mr. Giffard will show himself so void of al conscience and truth to say
al their traditionall worship and Antichristian Offices and ordinances be
neither part of their worship nor constitutions disanulling the ordinances of
Christ / yet will he confess I doubt not this kind of worship and government
to be imposed as matters to bind the conscience / being all the service of God
they have / seeing he would also have all that observe them not / to be
censured and excommunicat for this merchandise: yt were a sore matter a man
should be cut of from Christ and his Church / given over to Satan / and the
judgment ratified in heaven against soul and body / for a matter that byndes
not the conscience / As though the soul and body (howsoever some things
perteine to the one / or is done by the one as proper work there of) were not
both to be counted when the conscience shall be opened to answer for all done in
both / or by either of both / even whatsoever we have done in soul and body:
and Calvine would but divide the soul and the body in Civil causes. But
Master Giffard would go a note further ^ namely / that in the service of GOD
in such causes as the transgression deserve excommunication / to be no matter
bynding the conscience.

But it may be Master Giffard does suppose / that except the constitutions
ecclesiastical be such, as righteousness be commanded to be sought in the doing
them, and forgiveness of sins and merit by them, all is well. Then / besides
the other hbuses granted / he must de demanded whither those traditions of the
Fathers / which our Savior Christ and his Disciples refused to observe / were
imposed as meritorious / whereunto we answer / No: For in the superstitious
washings of cups / of beds / with all such trincketts / we see to be no
such matter Mark 7. and Christ's words in saying / they laid the commandments
of God aside to set up their own traditions / does show wherein the sin was:
namely / to do and observe such things of vain glory / superstition / or
custom as God had not enjoined them / and to leave undone the laws and
commandments of God / which sin is your transgression at this day: Read
therefore the 7. of Mark / and 15. of Matthew more diligently. Further those
superstitious traditions Gal, 4. and Colos. 2. the observing whereof were the
denial of Christ / were neither held meritorious / nor justification sought by
them / many of them being Jewish ceremonies / sometimes as rudiments commanded
of God / now abolished and no further burden to be laid in such outward
things / no / We read not that the law of God yt self was either commanded /
or so observed / as to seek righteousness by yt. Now then to the matter: Mr.
Giff. thinks Christ and his Apostles did well in refusing to obey the
traditions of the Fathers at the Pharisees commandment, and so must confess
it lawful and a duty of us to refuse to observe your Jewish ceremonies and
Romish superstitious traditions / which are so many as even your whole
Leitourgie and worship contain nothing else / Gods laws and ordinances not
only left undone but all that plead for them and seek to walk in them /
persecuted with deadly hatred.

And how Mr. Giffard will prove that there is no adding or diminishing to or
from the word of God / by imposing and creating more laws the^ God has made
in his worship and government of his Church / but such as be made part of the
worship / or bind the conscience / or be meritorious / or against such rules
of his government as be perpetual though I take all your orders / laws /
worship in this compass / yet how you can poue this / I know not / for look
again upon the scriptures Pro. 30.5.6. Deuteronomy. 4.2. and 12.32. and Gal. 3.15.
Revel. 22.18.19. and you shall find / that to add / superordeine / innovate or
diminish or take any thing from the laws of God already prescribed for his
worship / were to abrogate his law / to lay further burdens then he has
laid to make his law imperfect / and set our selves in his seat / yea
whatsoever we put to which he has not commanded / or whatsoever we inhibit
that he has commanded / is here forbidden: For this says the Lord / Ye
shall put nothing unto the word which I command you, neither shall you take
ought therefrom that you may keep the precepts of the Lord your God which I
command you Deuteronomy. 4.2. And that this was as well in the outward ordinances of
the Temple as in the judgments / is plain in the first verse. Again in the
12. Chap. 32. Whatsoever I command you, take heed you do yt; Thou shall put
nothing thereto nor take any thing therfrom: and in the Proverbs. Every word
of God is pure, put nothing unto his words lest he reprove the and thou be
found a liar. Now the scripture speaking so absolutely and generaly against al
addition or detraction to or from his ordinances / Mr. Giffard ouershooteth
himself of his bare word to contradict and limit so express commandementes /
for these Scriptures (says he) are against adding of humane precepts and
laws to be kept as parts of Gods worship / to bind the conscience to seek
righteousness / forgeuenes of sin / merit in them / or against such rules of
government as God has set to be perpetual. This is true / but this is not all
/ for the law is general against all inventio^s / traditions / constitutions
/ whatsoever God has not commanded / as the second Commandment does also
teach. Thou shall not make to thy self etc. so that God has left nothing to be
laid upon his Church by commandment / Which he has not commanded: And
therefore that place of the Apostle to the Gal. 3.15. must be better perused: If
it be but a man's Testament when yt is confirmed no man does abrogate yt or
superordeine any thing to yt: CHRIST'S Testament then being much more perfect /
his whole mind for the ordering of his house manifested therein / it is wicked
presumption to alter the ordinances thereof / or to hold them unmeet or
insufficient for any age or estate.

Well Mr. Giffard could now be content thus far to limit the power of the
Church: namely / to have her subject and obedient to his voice: but that he
supposes there may be laws ecclesiastical made / of things in themselves
indifferent: that where the scripture has commanded such things to be used at
our liberty for order / for comelynes / edification and glory of God / as
matters of place / time / and such circumstance. But he here mistaketh his
text / for the Lord commands by the Apostle in that place / ^. Corint. 14.
that those public business and exercises of the assembli^s / should be done
in order / in comlynes / to edifying / and does not leave something to be
commanded / which the master buylders has not prescribed: For to bind those
things by law which God has not bound in his worship / were to add new
traditions to bring us into bondage of the creatures / which the same Apostle
denies ever to be brought into bondage unto 1. Cor. 6.12. in his own person
teaching us so to walk: the Lord see in his wisdom cause to leave them in our
liberty / knowing there would be no end of such particular laws /
especially if he had left it to man's wit to make and unmake laws therein: For
the orders you speak of then / meaning circumstances of time / place /
kneeling / sitting / standing etc. there can be no further laws of them / then
the Apostle has set / and (as the Minister of Christ prescribed) that al be
done to edifying in comlynies / order / etc. Of these to set particular laws
/ were to break these general laws of God / whereby he teaches us the true
use of them / and leaves them in the Churches liberty as need requires to
use them or not use them: Neither can all assemblies be bound in these things
to the same in particular / that being needful and decent in one / that is not
in an other. And in that you would have them no further commanded / then they
be needful / convenient / decent etc. you condescend that there can be no
settled law in particular laid upon the Church in the^: For to use them so far
as they be convenient / necessary / and to edifijng is the law and
commandment of God: and to use them further at any man's commandment / were
both a breach of Gods law / and making the creatures stumbling blocks /
Idolles / bondages / and every way sinful. And when the Church commands
them so far to be used as they are commanded of God / the Church does but
ratifye and see GODS law executed: so that you have lost your self / whiles
you should have proved your bold affection: That the Church has power to
ordeyne laws / for to create or make laws / which you see the folly of /
being now driven to another shift: that in the particular things whereof GOD
has given general laws / we may make settled laws / and yet but for the
time they be convenient: Whereas in deed GODS law is the same and nothing else.
But because they be necessary in one place / that be not in another / at one
time / that be not at another / of sum persons / that be not to other /
there can be no law set in the particular one day for all assemblies in such
things. Neither shall any disagrement be such amongst the several Churches
/ as need any contention for them / whiles every assemblye do that which is
to themselves most meet / most convenient and necessary in such things / for
the present time. The Pastor and Elders were of small discretion if they might
not have these things in their liberty: and even these doctrines and examples
are in this point against your self / which you have alleged from other
CHURCHES. But my purpose is not to contend about men's writings / nor to be
drawn into controversy with other Churches / when I am to deal with your
present sin / for the avoiding whereof you thus rage. If your cause be good /
plead it by the Scriptures / and I will be so far from casting out darts
against al CHURCHES / as I will not deal with their estate / till I be further
occasioned / the rather may I omit this labor / for that you have alleged
one place of scripture which you suppose will bear up all your matter: If yt
help you not / I see not how you will defend your assertion.

In the 15. of the Acts where it is said the Apostles / Elders / and brethren
at Jerusalem met about the question of Circumcision and other Ceremonies of
Moses law / which some would have burdened the Gentiles with / we see there
(says he) that the Apostles themselves did decree some thing for the time /
which afterward were to be altered when the occasion was taken away / namely /
that the Gentiles should absteyne from blood / and from strangled / for
avoiding offense to the weak Iues. First let us see what the decree was / and
then it will appear how little yt serves Master Giffard his purpose: these be
the words. Act. 15.28.29. It seemed good to the holy Ghost and to us, to lay
no more burden upon you then that which is necessary of these things, to
absteyne from Idolothytes, and from blood, and from strangled, and from
fornication; from which keeping your selves, ye do well.

For one of these / which is (fornication) we have here no question / it being
by the moral law always forbiden: For the other Master Giffard would thus
reason. The Apostles themselves did decree them for the time / therefore the
Church has power to make and ordeyne laws in things of themselves indifferent
/ about the worship of God and public exercises. For our answer / we would
have Master Giffard first learn / that he / in saying the Apostles themselves
did this by the direction of the holy Ghost / has overthrown himself / for
these were the Master builders / appointed of God to be law makers for the
whole Leitourgie and worship of Christ to all posterities / even all the laws
and ordinances of the new Testament / confirmed by miracles from heaven /
delivered by their ministry unto us: It will not follow then / if the APOSTLES
had made and ordained some law here / that therefore every Synoode or any
Synod may impose laws and commandments by themselves ordained / till they
show they have that power given them the Apostles had / and an other Leitourgie
to be made / which they shall never de able to do / without a new CHRIST: We
have a sure foundation already laid / whereupon all Synods and Counsels must
build / and suffer their actions to be tried thereby / they have not power to
inioyne one title / which is not by the word of GOD enjoined us. Further / what
did the Apostles here that they had not warrant for: neither would they lay
any yoke or burden. And as for these things / they do as much bind us now
if there be like cause / namely / not in Idolothyts / blood / or that which is
strangled to offend our weak brethren / if the Iues should be now again called
/ neither to offend any in meat or drink for whom Christ has dyed: Neither
was there here any absolute law made of these things / nor necessitye for the
present time / further then it should be necessary for the respect set down /
for otherwise it had been to build again the things destroyed / only they
thus counseled and admonished the Gentiles to use their liberty in these
things / as they might gyve noe offense to their weak brethren of the Iues /
the more to draw them on in the ways of CHRIST: for they do not inioyne yt
as a law / but tell them they shall do well if they observe these things /
by no necessitye enforced. But we do not now observe these things / the
occasions being removed. True / therefore I trust you will grant / that no man
shall be further bound to any constitution in such things indifferent / then
there shall be cause / neither need we public order to retract: so that you
leave the matter to me / that we can be no further bound in such things /
then by those rules of edifijng / order / comlines / occasion shall require /
so that we neither need nor can have settled laws herein: how much more
bondage and burden is imposed under this Antichristian yoke / the things being
of themselves most loathsome and detestable Popery / abrogating and making void
all the true ordinances laws and worship of CHRIST / and so enforced as whot
persecution proceeds against any that of conscience absteyne from them let it
be considered. Neither has there ever been detracting this thirtye years of
any your abominations / neither is held lawefull for them that sees them
unlawful / to forbear them / without deadlye hate / to be followed to the
death. Blessed be our GOD / that has delivered our souls out of such
Egiptian servitude / our lives are not dear unto us / neither shall your
reproach move us.

Now concerning the last places of the Treatise / where he is utterly mute
in this / that all which stand under another Hierarchy or spiritual Regiment
then CHRIST'S / be by outward profession no true Christians / or under the
promise of salvation / also for the freedom we profess in holy obedience to
all statutes and ordinances off GOD / as he has left untouched the matter /
for which he aledged the 7. to the Romans / namelye / the outward professed
bondage to a false Spiritual government / so I having before largely expressed
my mind in that poinct of doctrine / and in such as then were about these
things opposed / refer any that desire the truth herein / to ponder the
reasons and proofs there set down / not minding to repeat again / or to be
set aworke in unfolding his troublesome and confuse cauills in abusing this
place / or to make further replye / till I see more capeable conceypt in him of
such principles of regeneration and sanctification / of freedom and bondage /
yet for others direction / one cauil or two shall be briefly set in veiwe.

First where he supposing I had been in error (and he himself fast fettered in
heresy and sees it not) charge me to run as far on the other side / as
a wheel turned with contrary motions of the stream / for saying I held the
dear children of GOD might fall into any sin / except the sin against the
holy GHOST / yet be restored by repentance / GODS grace so far abounding /
always considered (as then I noted) that obstinacye in any sin / make them
to us the servants of sin whiles they so remained / not speaking this to give
leave or encouragement to presume in the least or first step of sin / lest
GOD leave them to themselves / but to give them hope if they return that have
so fallen: he excepteth generally against all presumptuous sin / saying / of
frailty Gods children may fall / but of presumption he makes great doubt /
for any so sinning to be renewed by repentance / for it is spoken of the
Maranatha to be pronounced in this life to none / but that be in that sin
against the holy Ghost: and here to fill his paper (as his common shift is /
when he can neither affirm nor deny) he puts me to new questions: You
must (says he) declare how filthye incest is / not sin against the holy
GHOST / nor if a man kill his Father or Mother or children / nor witchcraft /
nor familiarity with Spirits / is not your meaning that the regenerate man may
of presumption and obstinacy commit these? If Master Giffard should thus
understand the word may he is in the same fault to say the regenerate may
sin of frailty: And I answer further / he could understand the word may
otherwise / if (as in all his writings) he carried not this mind to take all
in evil part / to quarrel / he could have understood it thus: that God
suffers of his elect to fall into such sin / yet he is able to reduce them
by repentance / and has made promise to receive them if they return / and
not have cauilled in this manner in such things / the horror in the very
naming of which sins shakes the flesh and bones of the godly to hear or
behold: so that his drift is but to cast in a little wormwood / to deface the
truth delivered: Therefore I will only prove the general doctrine before
affirmed / and for these perticulars / let him that takes pleasure in raking
in them / being sins not once to be named amongst GODS children / answer
himself. And much better might he have put his question thus. Whither
wilfullye committing of sacrilege / and presumptuous continuing to enchant in
a false ministry / with Iannes and Iambres resistinge the truth / persecutinge
the light against their knowledge / be not within the compass of that sin
against the holy Ghost.

That GODS elect after regeneration do fall into presumptuous sin / and for
a time persist in obstinate sin / and may be restored by repentance / I thus
prove: Many of GODS children may be excommunicat / and upon the repentance
be received again / as the incestuous person 1. Cor. 5. therefore do for a
time remain in obstinate sin. Again every sin is to be prayed for / but
that one sin against the holy Ghost 1. John. 5.16. Therefore presumptuous
sin is committed of GODS elect after regeneration. That all presumptuous
sin is not sin against the holy GHOST / we shall see by the description of
that sin Hebr. 6. and 10. where there is dispyting of the Spirit / accompting
the blood of JESUS an unholy thing / persecuting the light they have sometimes
tasted of / and such like notes / which are degrees. further then presumption:
for there is presumption of ignorance / of rashness / of hope of mercy / and
many times do the Prophets charge the people with rebellion against GOD: so
that all presumption cannot have the curse maranatha pronounced upon it / or
the persons not to be prayed for. But sure I grant / that presumption is near
to that sin / and there cannot be that high sinue without presumption. But
now if all sin but sin of frayltie were unpardonable / your Clergy were in
a woeful case / that thus maynely resist the truth / and persecute GODS
servants.

Neither is this doctrine any way contrary to that I delyvered / namelye /
that the regenerat man cannot be said to stand in bondage to sin after
regeneration / and the servant of GOD at the same time by outward profession /
for none are in bondage to sin after their calling to the faith / (to our
judgment) but such as continue obstinate in their open known sin after due
admonition: that such stand not by outward profession the servants off CHRIST
but of sin / and are to be excommunicate / he willingly grants: and
hereupon merueileth how I should gather / that obstinat gross sinners should
not be excommunicat: which he might plainly perceive if he had eyes / for
if all the regenerat be in bondage to sin / and so the servants of sin and
of Satan / how should they cast out an other for bondage out of their
fellowship by the power of CHRIST? If Master Giffard say / because the
obstinate is in greater bondage then the other / this proves not that the bond
can cast out the bond by the power of Christ.

Again / if all be in bondage / then none can be houlden without for being
in bondage to sin: so that none should be excommunicat / none without / the
world and the CHURCH / light and darkness / CHRIST and BELIALL should be
mingled together.

To all which he has made no answer / but demands certain questions / and
makes such a formal conclusion / as if all were in bondage unto sin. His
questions I grant all affirmantiuely / yet deny his consequence. Let him
plainly prove therefore by evidence of SCRIPTURE / that all that do sin are
bondslaues of sin / and when he has so done / I shall thereupon conclude
him a flat Anabaptist in the chief ground of their profession. Very gladlye
therefore would he leave out the word (bondage) / and falslye accuses and
sclandereth me / in saying I hold that men can not outwardly appear sinners
/ and stand the servants of CHRIST both at a time / which is an open untruth:
Yt is he / that cannot put difference between sinning / and bondage unto sin
/ so that in one word all his questions are answered: If any be in bondage
to sin / he stands a servant thereof.

Now for the 7. to the Romans / the APOSTLE setting forth the strift between
the flesh and the Spirit / speaks sometimes in the person of the one (if I may
so speak) and sometimes of the other / sometimes of the new man or regenerat
part / or of himself so far as he is regenerat: sometimes of the old man /
which is not wholly slain / but full of rebellion strives for maisterie. Now
I must demand of him / whether of these two have the pre-eminence / dominion
and rule in the regenerat / the graces of the Spirit / or the rebellions of the
flesh? The same APOSTLE says the SPIRIT / and that part off the man renewed
there with / which we call the inner man: In the 8. Cap. he makes it plain /
The law of the spirit of life in CHRIST has freed me from the law of sin
and of death. What is the law of the Spirit but the power / rule / and
dominion of the Spirit of GOD in us? And what is the law of sin / but the
power of sin / and bondage / wherewith we were sometimes led headlong by
Satan at his pleasure / but are now freed / that it no more does reign or
bear rule in us unto condemnation. Again / whosoever are ledd by the Spirit
of GOD / are the sons of God / and in the 7. Cap. 4. and 6. Cap. 16. Know
you not that to whom you exhibit your selves servants unto obedience, his
servants you are to whom you give your selves obedient? David feeling the
great assaults of sin in his flesh / and his inhabilitie to keep the Law
of GOD / earnestlye prays unto the Lord Direct my steps in thy word
(says he) and let none iniquity have dominion, over me. After the strong
man is cast out / CHRIST bears the rule over us and in us / by his Spirit. So
the scripture every where pronounces us Saints by calling / Kings / and
Priests / a people set free / not that we sin not in thought word and deed
howrely and daily / but that sin has not dominion over us: If then we were
in bondage to sin / we are the servantes of sin and of death / which GOD
forbid.

Where Master Giffard therefore reasons thus: the regeneration is imperfect /
therefore the freedom is imperfect / therefore there is some bondage / yt is
blasphemy: For first our freedom is perfect in CHRIST / else his death is not
sufficient. Then though our sanctification be not perfect / yet is there no
bondage / but a rebellion of sin: which if yt should reign / we were not
the servantes of CHRIST: And while it seems for a time to reign / and we
obstinatly to cleave unto yt / we are judged (so far as men can judge) the
servantes of yt / and so given over from / CHRIST unto Satan / till the grace
of the Spirit again to our judgment appear to bear rule.

As for David in the whole year after he had committed adulterye and murder
/ he never pleaded for his sin when he was reproved not did no longer
cleave unto yt. So likewise though we fall and sin / and be ledd away
with sin / yet are we not in bondage thereunto / until we obstinatly and
wilfully give our selves unto yt from CHRIST / which you find not in the 7. to
the Roman. but resisting of sin / a hatred of sin / a will to do good / a
repentance and contynuall recouerye of himself / and flying unto Christ. So
that your doctrine is false / to say / the Apostle stood in some spiritual
bondage / and my Argument still firm / that these Ministers and people which
stand in a professed bondage to a false government / their prayers are an
abomination unto the Lord / till they repent and submit themselves unto
CHRIST and his laws and ordinances. Which the Lord give them grace to do /
even speedely to depart out of the house of bondage / and from all subjection
of his Antichristian Hierarchy.

Christ's unworthy witness for the truth of his Gospel JOHN GREENVVOOD.

FINIS.
