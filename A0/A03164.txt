A most excellent new Ballad, of an old man and his wife, which in their old
age and misery sought to their own children for succor, by whom they were
disdained and scornfully sent away succourlesse, and how the vengeance of God
was justly showed upon them for the same.
To the tune of Prissilla.
IT was an old man, which with his poor wife,
in great distress did fall:
They were so feeble with age God wot
they could not work at all
A gallant son they had
which lived wealthily
To whom they went with full intent,
to ease their misery
Alack and alas for woe,
Alack and alas for woe.
A hundred miles when they had gone
with many a weary step
at length they saw their sons fair house
which made their hearts to leap:
They sat them on the green
their shoes and hose to trim
And put clean bands about their neck
against they should enter in. Alack etc.
Unto the door with trembling joints
when this old couple came
The woman with a shaking head
the old man blind and lame
Full warily they did knock
fearing for to offend
at last their senne does frowningly come, Alack, etc
unto them in the end.
Good folks quoth he what would you have here
me thinks you are too bold
Why get you not home to your country
now you are old and Lame
With that they both replied
wish sorrow care and grief
Here are we come to thee our son
for succor and relief. Alack, etc.
This is thy father gentle son
and I thy loving mother
That brought thee up most tenderly,
and loved thee above all other
I bore thee in this womb
these breasts did nourish thee
And as it chaunst I often daunst
thee on my tender knee. Alack, etc.
And humbly now we do thee entreat,
my dear and loving son
That thou will do for us in our age
as we for thee have done
No, no, not so he said
your suit is all in vain
It Is best for you I tell you true
to get you home again. Alack etc.
The world is not now as when I was born
all things are grown more dear:
My charge of Children is not small
as plainly does appear
The best that I can do
will hardly them maintain:
Therefore I say be packing away,
and get you home again. alack, etc,
The old man with his hat in hand
full many a leg did make.
The woman wept and wrong her hands
and prayed him for Christ his sake:
Not so to send them back,
distressed and undone
But let us lie in some barn here by
quoth she my loving son Alack etc,
By no meenes would he thereto consent,
but sent them soon away,
Nuoth he you know the peril of Law
if long time here you stay:
The stocks and whipping poast
will fall unto your share
Then take you heed and with all speed
to your country do repair. Alack, etc.
Away then went this woeful old man,
full sad in heart and mind
With weeping tears his wife did lament
their son was so unkind.
Thou wicked child quoth they
for this thy cruel deed:
The Lord send thee as little pity,
when thou do stand in need. Alack etc.
His children hearing his father set
his parents thus at naught
In short time after to have his lands
his death they subtly wrought
What cause have we quoth they
more kindness to express
Then he unto his parents did,
in their great wretchedness Alack, etc.
They murdered him in pitiful sort
they wayde not his intreates:
The more he prayed impassionately
the greater were his threats
Speak not to us quoth they,
for thou the death shall die:
and with that word with Dagger and sword
they mangled him monsterously Alack etc.
When they had got his silver and gold
according to their mind
They buried him in a stinking ditch
where no man could him find:
But now behold and see
Gods vengeance on them all:
To gain that gold their cousen came,
and slew them great and small. alack etc.
He came amongst them with a great club,
in dead time of the night:
Yea two of the sons he brained therewith,
and taking of his flight
The murderer taken was,
and suffered for the same:
Deservedly for their cruelty,
this vengeance upon them came.
Alack and alas therefore,
Alack and alas therefore.
Finis.
