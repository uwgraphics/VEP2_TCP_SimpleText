A GOOD WIFE GODS GIFT: AND, A WIFE INDEED.

Two Marriage Sermons.

By THOMAS GATAKER B. of D. and Pastor of Rotherhith.

PROVE. 12. 4. A virtuous Woman is a Crown to her Husband: But she that shameth
him is as rottenness in his Bones.

LONDON, Printed by JOHN HAVILAND for FVLKE CLIFTON. 1623.

TO THE WORSHIPFVLL MY LOVING COSENS, Mr. JOHN SCVDAMORE of Kenchurch in
Hereford-shire, and Mrs ELIZABETH SCVDAMORE his Wife, many happy days
together, with all true Blessedness, both temporal and eternal.
RIght dear, and unfeignedly beloved in Christ Jesus, I have a long time much
desired some good occasion of testifying mine hearty affection to your selves
in particular among others of that Family, which I acknowledge my self so
deeply indebted unto. And I seem now at length to have lighted on that, that I
have so long longed for. Being to publish a wedding Sermon of a worthy Friend
deceased, (which Mr. W. Br.
I wish, if Gods good will had so been, he had lived to do himself)
containing matter concerning the holy disposition and Christian managing of
Marriage Feasts; I thought good to adioyne to it (being it self but short) some
Meditations of mine own, of somewhat a near subject, the occasion of such
Feasts, to wit, A good Wife, by Solomon said to be Gods Gift. That which here I
address unto you, as to remain a Monument of mine hearty wel-wishing unto
you, so to abide by you, as a Monitor to put you both in mind, what a blessing
of God you enjoy either in other, and what cause you have to be thankful to
him either for other. Since it pleased God by his providence and your Friends
agreement to bring you together, and to knit that sacred knot between you, I
have not yet bin so happy, as to be an eie-witnes of your Christian and
religious cohabitation and conversation: but have by many been informed of it,
to my great joy, that you tread both in the steps of your pious Parents, and
therein show your selves to be their Children, Rom 9. 3.
not according to the flesh only, but (which would have bin their greatest
comfort, had they suruiued to have seen it, and shall be your chiefest
happiness both here and hereafter) according to the promise, even of eternal
salvation, annexed to the gracious Covenant of Faith in Christ; which by your
godly practice you show your selves to have common interest in with them. And
indeed to speak in the Holy Ghosts language, then Eorum filij dicimur, quorum
actus imitamur. Origin. in Ezech. hom. 4. and Greg. Romans mor. lib. 20. cap. 17.
are we truly the Children of our religious Parents and Ancestors, when in

A GOOD WIFE GODS GIFT.
PROVERBS 19. 14. Houses and Riches are the Inheritance of the Fathers: But a
prudent Wife is of the Lord.
THERE be two things especially that commend a work, Author opus laudat. -
Ovid. de pont. lib. 4. eleg. 9.
the Author, and the Matter. Both of them conspire to commend this Book, as in
the Title of it they are both expressed.

Prove. 1. 1.
The Proverbs, or Parables of Solomon, the Son of David, King of Israel.

For the Author, (to omit the Principal, 2 Pet. 1. 21.
Gods Spirit: Author.
for, (...). 2 Timothy 3. 16.
All Scripture is inspired of God:) the Penman of it was Solomon, 2 Chronicles. 1.
12. 1 King. 3. 12. Matter.
the wisest mere man that ever was in the world since Adam, by the testimony
even of wisdom it self.

For the Matter; it is Proverbs or Parables, (as the word in the Original
signifies) (...) a (...) quod (...) and dominari significat. (...) sive
dignitates, quae vitae Dominae and moderatrices esse dibent. Cartwright in
Prove. Coherence.
Master-sentences, such as rule or sway, and are or may be of principal use in
man's Life.

Now consisting for the most part of such Aphorisms and short Sentences, from
the beginning especially of the tenth Chapter; it is not necessary, that they
should have any coherence one with another; neither indeed for the most part
have they.

Yet this and the next before it, have some connection: Verse. 13.
the former being of the inconvenience that comes by a bad wife,

Verse. 14.
This latter of the benefit that a good wife, that a wise and a discreet woman
brings with her.

There Solomon compared two grand evils together, and made a bad wife the worse
of the twain:

Here he compares two great benefits together, and makes a good wife the
better of the two.

For the former; Verse. 13.
A foolish son, says Solomon, is his Fathers sorrow: and a brawling wife is
as a continual dropping.

(...). Plut. de tranquil. Dolores eo acerbiores, quo interiores. Aug. in
Psalm. 45.
Mala intestina gravissima. Evils are the more grievous, the nearer, and the
more inward they are; as diseases in the entrails. And Molestissimn^ malum
intestinum and domesticu^. Bern. in Cant. ser. 29. and 33.
mala domestica, domestical evils, vex a man most, when Matthew. 10. 36. Mica 7.
6.
a man's enemies, as our Savior speaks, are those of his own house.

(...). Hesiod. oper. Hinc Themistocles (...). Plut. apophth. Est vetns ver^m,
^liquid maliesse propter vicinum malum. Plaut. Merc. act. 4. sc. 4.
It is no small inconvenience to dwell near a bad neighbor; were such a one
further off us, he would be less troublesome to us. And surely if to have good
neighbors be a matter of no small moment, then somewhat also it must needs be
for a man to want such, and much more for a man to have them that dwell near
him euill-affected toward him. An evil at the next door may be bad enough,
and may prove over troublesome; an evil within doors, at home, in a man's own
house much more.

But again within doors there are degrees also: in a man's own family there
are some nearer than others. A John 8. 35.
son is nearer than a servant, and 1 Samuel 1. 8.
a wife than a son. Quo^ s^rui, ^hostes. Sen. epist. 47. Macrob. Sat. lib. 1.
c. 10. and Fest. lit. Q. Quot scrui, tot fures. Serve. ad Virg. eclog. 3.
It is a sore cross to be troubled, and it be but with bad servants. It is no
small vexation for a man to find untoward and unfaithful carriage toward him
Psalm. 41. 9. John 13. 18.
in those that eat his bread, that feed at his board; much more to sustain it
at the hands of her, that takes up the same bed with him, Mica. 7. 5.
that lies in his bosom. No evil to a bad bedfellow, (...). Aesopu^ apud
Gabriam. C^luber in sin^.
to a bosomeeuill, to that evil that lies next the heart, either within or
about the breast.

Again, though true mercy and compassion in some measure extend it self unto
all those, whose miseries and calamities we are acquainted with: yet the
misfortunes of our dear friends affect us more than of mere strangers: And
Qui ignotos l^dit, la^ro appellatur; qui ^micos, paulo minus quam paricida.
Petron. satyr.
the wrongs and injuries offered us by professed and pretended friends we are
wont to take more to heart. Ps. 55. 12, 13, 14.
It was not mine enemy, says David, that did me this wrong; for then I could
have borne it. But it was thou, o man, my companion, my guide, and my familiar
friend.

But Brethren are nearer than Friends. And howsoever Solomon truly says, that
Prove. 18. 24. (...). Dion. Chrysostom. ^rat. 3.
a Friend sometime sticks closer to a man than a Brother: yet in nature a
(...); (Psalm 133. 1.) (...). Menand. Vide Hier cle^ de amore frat^rn. and
Muson. de lib. tollend. apud Stob. tom. 2. cap. 82. Hinc vetus verbum, (...).
Plato polit. 2.
Brother is nearer than any Friend is or can be. There is a civil knot only
between Friend and Friend; there is a natural band between Brother and
Brother. And therefore, Prove. 18. 19. (...). Euripid. apud Plut. de frat. ^m.
(...). Aristot. p^lit. l. 7. c. 7.
A brother offended is harder to win than a strong City; and their contentions
are as Vectes arcis: qui ferrei aut aenei esse solent. Psalm. 107. 16. Esai. 45.
2.
bars of brass. (...). Plut. defrat. amor.
It is easier glewing again of boards together, that have been vnglewed, than
healing up the flesh that is gashed and divided: and the reason is, because
Contiguum ibi, istic continuum solvitur.
there was but an artificial connection before in the one, there was a natural
conjunction in the other: so it is easier reconciling of Friends than of
Brethren, there being a Civil bond only broken in the disjunction of the one,
a Natural tiall violated in the dissentions of the other.

But Children they are yet nearer than either Friends or Brethren. They are
Parsque tui latitat corpore clausa meo. Ovid. epist. 2.
parts nostri, viscera nostra; they are as Pignora nostra, Vis^era nostra;
potius quam opes, (...) Ovid. ep. 1. 2 Samuel 16. 11. Philem. 12, 20.
our very bowels, and part of our selves. And therefore no marvel if Solomon
say, that Prove. 10. 1.
A foolish son is a sorrow to his father, and an heaviness to his mother.
And, Prove. 17. 21.
He that begets a fool, begets himself sorrow: and the father of a
fool Nemo quisquam fere unquam fic dolet, ut non idem aliquando gaudeat.
Sedenim qui omni momento dolet, is vere dicitur non gaudere. Drus. observe. lib.
1. cap. 22. Vise and Agell. noct. Attic. lib. 2. cap. 6.
shall have no joy.

But behold here a further evil than any of the former. An evil wife, a
contentious woman worse than any of them all. Husband and Wife are nearer than
Friends, and Brethren; or than Parents and Children. Children, though they
spring from their Parents, yet they abide not always with them. They are as
Prove. 5. 16, 1^.
rivers rising from one head, but taking several ways, making several
streams, and running apart in several channels. But man and wife must bide by
it. They are as two streams, that rising from several heads, fall the one
into the other, Prout Alpheu^ Arethusae a^unt commis eri.
mingle their waters together, and are not severed again till they are
swallowed up in the Sea. Children are as Genes. 49. 22. Psalm. 128. 3.
branches shooting out of one stem, divided and severed either from other, or
as grifts and siences cut off, or boughs and branches slipped off from their
native stock, and either planted or engraffed elsewhere. Man and Wife are as
the stock and sience, the one (...). Romans 11. 24.
ingraffed into the other, and so fastened together, that they cannot again be
sundred; or as Ezech. 37. 17. Vno Vt siquis gemin^s conducat cortice ram^s,
Crescendo iu^g^, parite^que adolescere ce^. Ovid. Metam. l. 4.
those two pieces in the Prophets hand enclosed in one bark, and making both
but one branch. And Gen^s. 2. 24.
Therefore, says the Holy Ghost, shall a man leave father and mother, and
(...) Ch^^stus Mat. 19. 5.
be glewed unto, or (...) Moses.
cleave fast to his wife: and They Ita Mosen supplet Christus: quomodo and
Matthew. 4. 10. ex Deuteronomy. 6. 13. and 10. 20.
two shall be one flesh.

The nearer the bond then, the greater the evil, where it falls out
otherwise than it ought. Prove. 19. 14.
A foolish son, says Solomon, is the calamity of his father. And how is he
his calamite? He is (...) Prove. 105 and 17. 1. and 19. 16. and 29. 15.
silius pudefaciens, such an one as shameth his Parents, and makes them glad
to hide their heads in the house. But Prove. 19. 13.
an evil wife is as the rain dropping in through the tiles, that makes him
weary of the house, that vexes him so that it drives him out of doors.

Yea Prove. 27. 15.
as a dropping in a rainie day, when it is foul without and it droppeth
within. So that it makes a man at his wits end, uncertain whether it be
better for him to be abroad in the rain, or to bide within doors in the
dropping. And for this cause Augustine compares an evil Conscience to a bad
wife, (and it may seem that he pleased himself somewhat in the similitude,
August. in Psalm. 33. and in Psalm. 35. and in Psalm. 45. and alibi.
he makes use so often of it:) which when a man has many troubles and
afflictions from without, and would look home, hoping for some comfort from
within, is much more troublesome to him than any of those his outward crosses
are; is as a rock or a shelfe to Seamen in a storm, where they hoped to have
found harbor and shelter against it.

Yea further, not as a dropping only that drives a man from his house and
home, and that when it raineth; but Prove. 19. 13.
as a continual dropping in such a day: So that (...). Simonid.
a bad wife is worse than a quartane ague, wherein a man has two good days
for one evil. He that has an evil wife, is as one that has an evil soul,
a guilty conscience, that evermore sticks by him, that every where
accompanies him, is a continual evil companion with him In cubi^ulo, in
cubili ipso. Aug. in Psalm. 45.
at bed and board, Quam nec sugere, nec sugare lice^. Bern. in ^ant. 33. and
Lips. in politic. Conscient^am ^nim a Deo (comitem individu^m) accepimus, quae
divelli a nobis non potest. Cic. pro Cl^^nt.
such as he cannot shift off or shun. And no marvel therefore if it be deemed
the greatest temporal evil, because the most continual, and the most inward,
for a man to be matched with an evil wife, or a woman with an evil husband:
For what is said of the one, is as true of the other, the relation between
them being alike.

To draw all to an head then. An unkind Neighbor is a cross: but (...);
Sopho^. Antigon.
an unfaithful Friend is a great cross; an unnatural Brother a greater; an
ungracious Child yet a greater: but a wicked, unquiet, or disloyal wife is
the (...). Menand. Penus malerum est omniu^ mulier mala.
greatest of all, and if we believe Solomon, goes beyond them all. In regard
whereof he also els-where pronounces, that Prove. 21. 9. and 25. 24.
it is better to abide on a corner of the house top without, than to continue
with such a one in a wide house: yea that Prove. 21. 19. Sirac. 25. 18, 22.
(...). Menand. Mala mul^er quavis s^ra tr^c^lcation. H. Steph. Sum.
it is better to live in the wilderness with the wild beasts, than with such.

But to leave this that is without my Text, and yet next door to it, (so near
here do good and bad neighbor together) and to come nearer home: Some it may
be hearing Solomon speak on this manner, might say, as our Saviors Disciples
sometime said, Matthew. 19. 10.
If the case so stand between man and wife, it is good then not to marry.

Now to such Solomon seems to answer in the words of my Text, that It is not
evil to marry, but it is good to be wary: that it is not the abuse or
badnesse of some, that ought to make Gods ordinance the less valued, or the
less esteemed, being in it self and of it self a matter of great benefit:
that as the inconvenience is great and grievous that a bad wife brings with
her; so the benefit on the other side is no less that comes by a good wife,
by a wise and a discreet woman: who is therefore here commended as a special
Gift, as a principal blessing of God, such as goes beyond any other temporal
blessing whatsoever. And surely (...). Hesiod. (...). Sim^nid. apud Clem. Alex.
^^rom. l. 6. Sorspotior muliere proba non ^btigit unquam Vlla vno; (...) mala
nil t^trius isquam est. Erasm. (...). Menand. Salus and ex^ium muli^r est
(...). H. Steph.
as there is no greater temporal cross or curse than the one; so is there no
greater temporal blessing than the other.

Now this Solomon to show, as Verse. 13.
before he compared two great evils together, and found a bad wife to be the
worse: so here he compares two great benefits together, and affirms a good
wife to be the greater.

House and possessions, wealth and riches, land and living is Psalm. 4. 6.
(...). Antiphanes. - (...). Sophocles. (...). Hesiod. Prima fere vota and
cunctis notissima templis, Divitiae ut crescant. - Iuven. sat. 10 Totus
populies in alijs d^s^ors, in hoc convenit: hoc suspiciunt; hoc sibi, hocsuis
optant. Sen. epist. 115. Meaning.
that, that most men regard, and look after: yea men are wont to seek wives
for wealth. But says Solomon, as Prove. 22. 1. (...). Mena^d.
a good name, so a good wife, a wise and a discreet woman is better than
wealth; Prove. 31. 10.
her price is far above pearls: For House and possessions are the inheritance
of the fathers; but a prudent wife is of the Lord.

Which yet we are not so to understand; neither the former part, as if worldly
wealth, and riches, and possessions were not Gods gifts: for Prove. 10. 22.
(...). Pindar. Pyth. 8. (...). Aeschyl. Theb.
It is the blessing of God that makes a man rich: Psalm. 127. 1, 2.
unless he build the house it will never be built: and Deuteronomy. 8. 18. (...).
P^^d. Pyth. 8.
it is he that gives men power to gather wealth together.

Nor yet again the latter part; as if Parents had no hand, right or power in
disposing of their children, or in aduising them and providing in that kind
for them. Judge. 14. 2.
Sampson requires his Parents consent. And Deuteronomy. 7. 3.
God charge his people not to make matches between their children and the
Canaanites, either by giving their daughters unto the sons of the Canaanites,
or by taking the Canaanites daughters unto their sons: which he would not
do, were not they at all to deal in the disposing of them. And many, no
doubt, would they take advice of their Parents, and not follow their own
fancies, and make their wanton eye, or their wandering lust, their choser and
counsailer in such cases, might do much better than for want hereof they do.

But the meaning of Solomon is this only, that the one is a more special gift
of God than the other; that there is a more special hand of God in the one
than in the other. As that is a less benefit than this: so that is in man's
power more than this.

So that two points then here in Solomon's words Points 2.
offer themselves unto us:

The former, that (...). Greg Naz. Epit^p. Patr. Point 1.
A good Wife is Gods gift.

The latter, that Gods providence is more special in a Wife than in Wealth.

For the former. A good wife is Gods gift. For a prudent wife, says Solomon,
is of the Lord. And Prove. 18. 22.
He that finds a wife, (that is, a good wife, as, a (...) Eccles. 7. 1. Prove.

indeed.
as if an evil wife were no wife, deserved not the name of a wife:) has found
a good thing; and has obtained a special favor from God.

It was one of the first real and royal gifts that Genes. 2. 22.
God with his own hand bestowed upon Adam. And it must needs be no small
matter that God gives with his own hand. The Kings Almoner may cast small
silver about: but if the King give a man somewhat with his own hand out of his
purse or pocket, it is expected it should be a piece of gold at least. The
woman was Gods own gift to Adam. And she was Gods gift bestowed on him,
Genes. 2. 18.
to consummate and make up his happiness. Though he were at the first of
himself happy, yet not so happy as he might be, until he had one to
partake with him in his happiness.

It was God that at first gave Adam his wife; and it is God that gives every
man his wife to this Reason 2.
day. Genes. 24. 7, 56.
God, says Abraham to his servant, will send his Angel along with thee, and
will prosper thee in thy journey; when he sent him about a wife for his Son
Isaak. And Matthew. 19. 6.
Those that God has joined together, says our Savior, let not man sever. As
Augustine says, that Qui creauit ^eminem sine homine, procreat ^ominem ex
homine. Aug. de verb. Ap. 11. I^r. 1. 5.
He that at the first created man without man, does now procreate man by man:
so he that gave man a wife at the first immediately, does still give men wives
by means; Prove. 18. 22.
good ones in mercy, (...). 7. 26.
evil ones in wrath; the one for solace and comfort, the other for trial,
cure, correction, or punishment. (...). Eurip. Menalip.
No marriages are consummate on earth, that were not first concluded and made up
in heaven: and none are blessed here, that were not in mercy made there.

For the latter; There is a more special providence of God in a Wife than in
Wealth. Humane wisdom Point 2.
and forecast, endeavor and industry, may strike a greater stroke, and have a
more special hand in the one than in the other. Men of wealth may leave their
heirs land and living; but (...). Mena^d. Haud facile coniugem nanciscier
bonam. H. Steph. Reason 1.
they cannot so easily provide fit wives for them.

For first, they may be deceived in their choice. Many have good skill in
choosing of wares, in valuing of lands, in beating a bargain, in making a
purchase, that are yet but blind buzzards in the choice of a wife. Yea the
wisest that are may be soon here ouer-reached. Since all is not gold, as we
say, that glistereth. Ierem. 17. 9.
The heart of man, says the Prophet, i^ deceitful above all things. And, 1
Cor. 2. 11. C^rd^ humana alienis oculis clausa sunt. Greg. Romans mor. lib. 25.
c. 9. Non est homini^ scire quid sit in homine, nis^s^rte qui^ ad hoc ipsum
fuerit vel spiritu Dei illuminatus, vel angel^ca informatus industria. Bern. in
Cant. 65. Reason 2.
None can tell what is in man or woman, but their own spirit that is within
them.

Secondly, they cannot lincke hearts as they list. A Father may find out a fit
wife, and think such a one a meet match for his Son: and her Parents may be
also of the same mind with him, as willing to entertain the motion as he is
to make it; and yet it may be, when they have done all they can, they cannot
fasten their affections. As Fides suadenda non imperanda. Ber. in Cant. 66.

none freer from force and compulsion. The very offer of enforcement turns
it often into hatred. There are secret lincks of affection, that no reason can
be rendered of: as Non (...) te, Sabidi, nec passum dicerequare: Hoc vnum
possum dicere, Non (...) te. Martial. ep. 33. lib. 1.
there are inbred dislikes, that can neither be resolved, nor reconciled. When
Parents have a long (...)e beaten the bush, another often, as we say, c^th the
bird: affections are set some other way, and cannot be removed. And things fall
out many times so unexpectedly, such strong liking taken to some suddenly not
once thought on before, and such strange alienation of affections, where there
has been much laboring to lincke them, and that where outward inducements of
person, estate, years, etc. have concurred, that even a natural man's dim
eye may easily see and discern a more special providence of God often carrying
things in these cases: And the tongues even of such are enforced sometime to
confess, as the Egyptian Magitians of Moses his miracles, Exodus 8. 19.
Digitus Dei hic est, There is a finger of God here; so with Rebekkaes profane
friends, in such Marriage matches; Genes. 24. 50.
A Domino factum est istud; This is even Gods own doing; and there is no
contradicting of it.

To make some Use of these Points.

First, Is a good wife such a special gift of God? Use 1.
Then is Marriage questionles a blessing, and no small one, of it self: one of
the greatest outward Blessings that in this world man enjoys. Psalm. 128. 1,

Blessed is every one, says the Psalmist, that fears God, and that walks
in his ways. For thou shall eat of the labor of thine hands: happy art thou,
and it shall go well with thee. Thy wife ^l be as the fruitful vine by the
sides of thine house: and thy Children like the Olive plants round about thy
table. Lo, thus shall the man be blessed that fears God. In the first place
comes the Wife, as the first and principal blessing, and the Children in the
next. And surely to reason backward to that the Apostle does: Romans 11. 16.
If the root, says he, be holy, the branches also be holy: and, If the
branches, say I, be holy, then the root that bears them much more. So here,
If the branches be blessed, the root that bears them much more. If Children
be a Blessing, then (...). Hierocles de nupt. apud Stob. ^^m. 2. cap. 65.
the root whence they spring ought much more to be so esteemed. Psalm. 127. 3.
Behold, Children and the fruit of the womb, are the gift of God, says Is
enim ex titulo Author videtur.
Solomon. Children are the gift of God; but the Wife is a more special gift of
God: she comes in the first place, they in the second: And gifts are usually
answerable to the greatness of the giver. It was a witty answer of a great
Prince, when he was disposed to be rid of a bold begging Philosopher: he asked
a groat of him, and the King told him, (...). Drachmam dare non est regium.
It was too little for a Prince to give; he requested the King then to give
him a Talent, and the King told him, (...). Tale^tum p^tere non est Cynicum.
Antigonu^ Thr^syll^ apud Plut. in ap^phth. Et Sen. de benef. l. 2. c. 17.
It was too much for a Beggar to crave. And surely God indeed in his special
gifts to us, is wont Non qu^ro quid te accipere deceat, sed quid me dare.
Alexand. apud Sen. de benef. lib. 2. c. 16. Idem Perillo amic^ cu^ ad silias
^l^cand^^ taleta quinquaginta assignasset, is autem december sufficere
affirmasse^. (...). Plut. in apophth.
to regard not so much what is fit for us to ask or to expect, as what
stands with his goodness and greatness to give.

Genes. 1. 31.
God, says Moses, looked upon all that he had made, and behold all was very
good. And (...). 1 Timothy 4. 4.
Every creature, or ordinance of God, says the Apostle, (and he had spoken
of Meat and Marriage in the words beforegoing:) is good. All Gods Creatures and
Ordinances are good then; but some are more excellent than others. And Marriage
being of this latter sort, it is not holy only, but even honorable also.
(...). Heb. 13, 4. Use 2.
Marriage, says the Apostle, is honorable among all men: and no disgrace then
to any man. So are we to esteem of it, and not to contemn what God has
graced, or to dishonor what he has honored. We shall but wrong the giver in
debasing his gift.

Again, is a good Wife such a special gift of God? Then if we find in
marriage, inconveniences, hindrances, distractions, disturbances: Let us learn
what we are to ascribe it unto: Not to Gods gift or ordinance, but Si Dei
benefici^ vtentium prauitate perpendimus, nihil non nostro malo accepimus.

the Sun beams receive a tincture from the colored glass that they pass
through: so our foul hands and filthy fingers often soil and sully Gods
Ordinances, and our filth and corruption does ost so taint and infect them,
that they lose not only much of their native grace, and are so strangely
transformed, that Esai. 58. 5. and 1. 11, 12, 14. Secundum libidinem suam

God himself can scarcely discern his own in them, but they miss also of
their fruit and efficacy, and Improbo ^ihil prodest; quia quicquid ad illum

Tyranny in government is not the fault of Gods Ordinance, but of man's
corruption abusing it: so in these cases, the evil and inconvenience is not
the fruit of Gods Ordinance, but of man's corruption accompanying it.

If we shall find then in the married estate troubles and distractions, etc.

whom Solomon says; Prove. 19. 3.
The folly of a man peruerteth his way, and his foolish heart fretteth against
God.

Secondly, Is a good wife Gods gift? then let those that want them, learn how
and where to seek them. Do thou want a wife, and would have one, and
such a one, as thou may have comfort in? Seek her of God, seek her with God.

Seek her, I say, first at Gods hands, seek her where she is to be had.

Every good gift, says James, is of God from above: and to be sought
therefore at his hands: and if every good gift, this more specially, that is
so special a gift, and of so principal use. And, (...). 1 Timothy 4. 4.
Every Creature or Ordinance, says Paul, is to be sanctified by prayer. And
if every Ordinance of God should be sanctified by prayer; and it ought (...).

others, yea this above and before others, (...). Menand.
as that which (through the blessing of God upon it) may prove a matter of the
greatest benefit unto us, and without it a means of the greatest evil.

Yea, seek her as of God, so with God. Ask counsel at the mouth of God, when
thou go about Use 4.
any such business. 1 Timothy 4. 4.
The Ordinances of God, says the Apostle, are sanctified unto us, as well by
the word of God, as by prayer. Then are they sanctified unto us by prayer, when
we crave leave for the use of them, and a blessing upon the use of them by
prayer at Gods hands. Then are they sanctified unto us by the word of God, when
we have warrant, and take direction, for what we do in them, out of Gods
word, when we Io^^. 9. 14.
ask counsel at Gods mouth. Then we seek them with God, when we seek them
by good means, when we seek them in due manner.

For when it is said that a good wife is of God; we are not so to conceive it,
that we are in such cases to use no means at all; but that we are to use none
but good and lawful means, such as God has appointed, either prescribed or
permitted. 1 Cor. 7. 39.
The wife is bound, says the Apostle, while her husband lives: but if her
husband be dead, she is at liberty to marry where she will, but yet, (...).
in Domino, in the Lord.

Wherein they offend, either that go too near, matching within those degrees
that Leuit. 18.
God has inhibited: or that go too far off, matching Deuteronomy. 7. 3, 4. 1 King.
11. 1, 2.
with such as for matter of religion they are prohibited to marry; and so
transgressing those rules and directions that the word of God gives.

As also those that be under the government of others, or that desire those
that be in the power of others to dispose of; they then seek in the Lord,
when they advise with, and are content to be disposed of by those, whom God
has given power over them; or when they seek not to them in the first place,
but to those, by whom God will have them to be disposed. That which not Gods
people alone, but Genes. 34 6, 11. Virginitas non t^ta tua est: ex part p^
est; Altera pars patri, data part est altera matri; Tertia sola tua est.

A^r. l. 1. ^9.
the Heathen also, by the light of Nature, saw to be equal and right. When
they take other courses, they seek beside God, and cannot hope or expect any
blessing from God, whose order and ordinance therein they break. In a word,
would thou be blessed in thy wooing, in thy wiuing; Take God with thee in
wooing, inuit him to thy wedding. He, if he be pleased, will l. b. 2. 9.
Use 5.
turn thy water into wine; if he be displeased, he will turn thy wine into
vinegar.

Thirdly, learn hence what principally to aim at in the choice of a wise: to
wit, at virtue and wisdom, discretion and godliness; for that is indeed true
wisdom.

Solomon says not, a fair wife is the gift of God. And yet is (...). Act 7.

beauty Gods gift; and (...). Menand. (...). Plat. po (...). lib. 3. ^ratior

Stob. tom. 2. c. 63.
a gift of good regard. Neither says he, a wealthy wife is the gift of God:
And yet is 1 Chronicles 29. 12, 14. 2 Chronicles. 1. 12.
wealth also Gods blessing, where it is accompanied with well-doing. But, a
discrcet, or a wise woman is the gift of God.

Many indeed there are, that choose their wife by the eye: Genes. 6. 3.
The Sons of God saw the Daughters of Men to be fair: and they took them
wives of them where they liked: as if they were to buy a picture or an image to
hang up in the house, or to stand somewhere for a show. But (...). Nescio quis

vanity: but a woman that fears God is praise-worthie indeed.

Others again regard wealth only; as if they went about a purchase, as if
they were to marry not them but their money, (...). Chrysostom. tom. 8. sermon. 15.
as if they were to wed not the wife, but her wealth. But Solomon, when he
says, Houses and Riches are the inheritance of the Fathers: but a prudent Wife
is of the Lord: he implies that these things may be severed, the one may be
without the other. Lands may come by inheritance; when Virtus non est
haereditaria. Non est res beneficiaria: non obvenit. Sen. epist. 90.

Goods they are wherewith men may do good, but not such as make those good
that have them. (...). Themistocl. apud Plut. apophth. Malo virum qui pec^^ia
^g^at, quam pecuniam quae viro. Cic. offic. l. 2.
Better it is, said the Heathen man, to have a man without money, than to have
money without a man: so better it is to have a wife without wealth, than to
have wealth without a wife. And surely, what comsort can a man have of wealth
with such a wife, that shall be as a corrosiue to his heart, Prove. 12. 4. Sicut

as corruption and rottenness in his bones?

Again, let Parents learn here what to aim at in the education of their
Children, whom they desire to dispose of, and to dispose of so as they may be
a blessing, not a cross or a curse to those that shall have them: Not study
only how to provide portions for them: though an honest care also is to be
had in that kind. 2 Cor. 12. 12.
Parents, says the Apostle, ought to lay up for their Children. And, 1 Timothy 5.
8.
He that provides not for his issue, is worse than an Insidell. Nor how to
trim them up, and set them out, in whorish or garish manner, to make them baits
to catch fools with; but labor to train them up in true wisdom and
discretion, in the fear of God, and such graces, as may make them truly
amiable, as 1 Pet. 3. 3. (...). Cl^. Alex. paed. l. 3. c. 1.
well in Gods sight as in man's eyes; in houswifrie, and industry, and skill to
manage household affairs: that so they may be helpers to their Husbands, (and
not hinderers;) as Genes 2. 18. Use 7.
to that end they were made at first.

Yea hence let the wise learn what she is to strive to, and labor for, that
the may be indeed a good gift of God: 1 Timothy 2. 9, 10. 1 Pet. 3. 4, 5. Cultus
magna cura tib. magna (...) tut^ i^curia. Cato Cens. apud A^. b^st. l. 16. C^

(...). Clem. Alex. paed. l. 2. c. 12. (...). Ibid. l. 3. c. (...). (...). Ibid
c. 11. (...). Ibid. lib. 2. cap. 9.
Not so much to deck and trick herself up to the eye, as to have her inner
man adorned with holy skill and discretion, whereby to carry herself wisely
and discreetly in that place and condition that God has called her unto: That
she may with the wise woman, Prove. 14. 1. (...). Menand.
build up the house; and be Prove. 12. 4. Digna suo coniux fida corona viro.
a crown, and Prove. 31. 23.
a grace to him that has her. That Prove. 31. 28. (...). Clem. paed. l. 3. c.
11.
her Husband and Children may have cause to bless her, and to bless God for
her; and count it a blessed time when they came first together.

Let her consider what a fearful thing it is to be otherwise. For her that
was Genes. 2. 18.
made for a help, to prove not an help but an hurt: for her that was given
for a blessing, to prove a cross and a curse. As one says of Eve, (...).
Basil. S^l. Use 8.
reaft from Adam as a rib, and shot by Satan at him as a shaft: bestowed on him
by God to consummate his felicity, but made by Satan's slight and her own
default, the means of his extreme misery.

Fourthly, let men be admonished hence, whom to ascribe it unto, if ought have
been done in this kind for them: even to God himself principally, whose
special gift a good wife is. Let us take heed how in this case Habba. 1. 16.
we sacrifice to our yearne, or burn incense to our not. Ascribe not what is
done for thee, to the mediation of friends, or to thine own plots and
policies, smoothness of language, fairness of look, or the like. No:
acknowledge God to have been the principal agent in the business: regard man
and thine own means, but as his Instruments. Of him she is, says Solomon: not
Genes. 2. 22. and 1. 27.
as a Creature only made of him, but as Genes. 2. 22.
one matched unto thee by him: nor ^s knit to thee by his ordinance, but as
(...). Torus ^^ri atque ^^minae fa^al^t est. Aeschyl. Eumen. Haec s^cet res
v^a, si vlla, sato gubernatur. Dun^^^ ad Lys. Use 9.
assigned thee by his providence: For that is it, that Solomon here principally
aims at.

Yea, let them hence learn what they owe unto God, whom God has vouchsafed
such a blessing unto. Has God bestowed such a Wife on thee, as Solomon here
speaks of? It is a precious Jewel; such as thy Father could never leave
thee. It is a greater Treasure than the greatest Prince on earth, than the
mightiest Monarch in the world is able to bequeath to his Heir. We see how
Parents are often troubled in making search for their Sons, and yet when they
have done their best endeavor, miss of that they desire. We might here rise
by degrees on the better side, as we did before on the worse. As evils, so good
things, the more inward the greater. A Prove. 17. 2. and 14. 35. Luke 1^. 4^.

a faithful friend a greater; Prove. 10. 1. and v. 20 and 17. 6. and 23. 15.
(...). -Menand.
a wise son yet a greater; and a prudent wife the greatest of all: a greater
blessing than any of the former, that yet for temporal blessings may seem of
the greatest. And how do married persons then stand engaged to God above others,
whom he has blessed in their choice? A great measure of thankfulness owe they
unto him, proportionable in some sort to the blessing bestowed on them.

Yea, as there is a greater measure of thankfulness required of them, than of
others whom God has not blessed in that manner: so there is a peculiar kind
of thankfulness required on their part. All Gods favors require
thankfulness: and the more favors the more thankfulness: but some special
favors require some peculiar kind of acknowledgement, proportioned to the
quality of the favor received. Psalm. ^27. 3. Genes. 33. 5.
Children are Gods gift: and our thankfulness to him for them is to be showed
in such duties, as he requires of us in the behalf of them, Ephesians. 6. 4.
in the careful education and training them up in good courses. In like
manner: Thy Wife thou have of Gods gift: and thy thankfulness to him for her,
must be showed in the performance of such duties, as he requires of thee in
regard of her Ephesians. 5. 25, 28, 29, 33. Coloss. 3. 19. Use 10.
, as of love, of kindness, of concord, counsel, contentment, etc.

Fifthly, Is the Wife given unto her Husband by God? then must she resolve to
give herself wholly to him as her Owner, on whom God has bestowed her, to
whom he has assigned her. When Parents have put out their Children, the
Children must be content to be guided by those to whom they commit them: and
when God has given a Daughter, she must be content to live with him, and be
guided by him, whom God has given her unto. Neither is she to forsake him. For
Matthew. 19. 5, 6.
they are not to be sundred, nor severed, whom God has conjoined and made
one. And there is a foul brand therefore upon her, Prove. 2. 17.
that for saketh the guide of her youth, and forgets the Covenant of her
God. Nor to refuse to be ruled by him: but Ephesians. 5. 22. 1 Pet. 3. 1.
submit and subject herself unto him, unto whom God has given her: for Col^.
3. (...). (...).
that is comely, says the Apostle, in the Lord: and to be embraced therefore
of her, as her Lot by God assigned her.

Yea, is the Wife given the Husband by God? Use 11.
then should he esteem her as a gift of God: and 1 Pet. 3. 7. (...).
live with her, as with one given him and bestowed upon him by God. D^num quis
aegr^ despici non ^er^ suu^?
We cannot abide to see any thing that we have given another euill-vsed. And
it be but a dog, an ^ound, or a whelp, if we see it neglected, where we
bestowed it, we are wont to take it evil. But Brads^. Prep^^. to Lords Sup.
part. 1. c. 4.
if we should see a Jewel of some value, bestowed by us on a friend as a token
of our love toward him, set at light by him, or should find it cast aside in
some corner, would we not much more be grieved at it, and judge that he set as
light by our love, as he does by our loue-token. And has no^ God then just
cause to take it evil at thy hands, when he shall see his gift abused, evil
entertained, and worse used; when he shall see her mis-vsed of thee, whom he
has as Pro^. (...). 1^. (...).
a special favor bestowed on thee, and has therefore given thee Ephesians. 5.
33. Coloss. 3. 19.
a special charge well and kindly to use? How are we wont to be grieved, when
we see matters fall out amiss, where we have been means to make the match?
If the wife be mis-vsed, that we have helped one to, we are wont to count it a
wrong to our selves. And no marvel then, if God himself take to heart the
wrongs done by us, to those that he has joined to us, if Malach. 2. 13, 14, 15.
he have a quarrel against him that shall transgress against her, whom he
has inseparably joined to him, to be his Companion and his wife by Pactum
salis, pr^ s^r^sanct^ invi^^^bili. Numb. 1^. 19.
a Covenant of Salt.

Lastly, if a good Wife be such a special gift of Use 12.
God, then a good Husband is no less. For (...). Aristot. Eudem. l. 7. c. 5.
the Husband is as needful for the Wife, as the Wife is for the Husband.
Genes. 3. 16.
Thy desire, says God, shall be unto him. And if the Husband then be so to
esteem of his Wife, and to be thankful to God for her; then is the Wife no
less to esteem so of her Husband, and to be thankful likewise to God for him.

In a word, let both man and wife so esteem either of other, as joined by Gods
counsel, as given by Gods hand; and so receive either other as from God, be
thankful either for other unto God, seek the good either of other in God; and
then will God undoubtedly with his blessing, accompany his gift to his own
glory, and their mutual good.

RIght Worshipful; A former Sermon of mine concerning matter of Marriage being
now the second time called for to pass the Press; In stead of adding to that,
which some desired, I was advised and requested rather by others to annex this.
Whereunto having yielded, I knew not which way better to direct it than to your
selves; ut whose happy conjunction some part of it was preached, the residue
through streits of time being for that time suppressed. What then you should
have heard, if the time had permitted, both your selves may now read (if you
please) with some further enlargement, and others also (if they think it may
be of use to them) under your Names. Therein, as in a Glass, as you, Worthy
MADAM, may (I doubtnot) see your self lively deciphered; so you, Blessed SIR,
yea thrice blessed in this your happy choice, might learn, but that (I know)
you are not now to learn it, what a precious Jewel God has in her bestowed
on you, and how great a measure of thankfulness you owe to him for his mercy
to you therein. Yea both of you may behold here, what a blessed estate and
condition of life it is, that GOD has pleased to call you unto, where the same
is managed through his grace according to his will; notwithstanding those vile
and foul aspersions here in part laid open, that those of that Romish faction
are wont to cast upon it. If of those that abuse this holy and divine
Ordinance, and carry themselves otherwise therein than they ought, there seem
to any a Censure ouer-harsh here to be passed; Let them consider that it is no
other than Gods word gives good warrant for; and let them take heed, lest by
censuring it, they give suspicion that themselves come within compass of such
Censure. To your selves (I am assured) no Apology shall need either for it, or
mine addressing it to you. But hoping it will be accepted, as it is intended,
as a testimony of my sincere and entire affection to you both; with hearty
prayers to GOD for your happy cohabitation to be long continued to his greater
glory, your mutual comfort, and the further benefit of those that may have
dependence upon you: I commend you to Act. 20. 32.
him, and his gracious Word, who vouchsafe thereby to build you further in
those good graces that he has begun in you, that you may have inheritance

select and choice Sentences. So that we need not stand picking or culling
here: As he said of Cyrus his Court, (and I wish might be said of ours) (...).
Xenoph. ^yri paed. l. 8.
though a man should seek or choose blindfold, he could not miss of a good
man; though we go here at adventure, we cannot do amiss, we are sure to
meet with some choice matter or other. It is the manner of the Learned in

marks in the margin, upon such passages as are most remarkable. But there is
Gods own Mark set upon every Sentence in this Book, not by Solomon only,
but by the Spirit of God himself.

Among the rest of these select Sentences, there are some, and those not a few,
that contain matter Matter, General:
concerning Marriage, either the Praise and commendation of a good Wife, or the
dispraise, discommendation, yea and detestation of a bad.

The Sentence contained in my Text, is concerning the former, though not wholly
without some Special.
secret intimation of the latter; as in the opening of it shall appear.

And in it we may observe these Particulars; Distribution. Branches 5.


1. The party commended; a Wife: 2. The commendation given her; Good: 3. The
means of compassing her, by seeking, implied in the word, Finds: 4. The
principal Doner or Giver of her; God: 5. The nature and quality of the gift;
a Favor.
For the first of them: A Wife? may some say, What? Is every Wife, or every
woman then such as Branch 1. Objection.
Solomon here says? yea, does not the same Solomon himself elsewhere say,
that some Wife there is, Prove. 14. 1.
that pulls down the house? that is, not as a corrosiue at her Husbands
sides, but Prove. 12. 4.
as corruption in his bones? or Prove. 19. 13. and 27. 15.
like a continual dropping in a rainie day, that makes a man weary of his
home, and either drives him out of doors, or will not suffer him to rest
within? And that Prove. 21. 9.
it is better for a man to dwell on the house top, exposed to wind and weather;
or Prove. 21. 19.
to live in the wilderness Sirac. 25. 20.
among wild beasts, than to keep house with such an one.

To this there are diverse answers given. Answer. Solution 1.


For first some say, that Vxor, quamdiu vxor, quamdiu non adultera, licet
difficilis morosa, contentiosa, rixosa, in bonis, in beneficij^ est numeranda.
T. Cartwr. in Prove.
a Wife so long as she continues a Wife; that is, so long as she is not
disloyal, but is honest, as we say, of her body, though she be never so
contentious, unquiet, or inconvenient otherwise, is to be esteemed as a
Benefit. As Malus etiam Princeps nullo melior. P. Martyr. i^ Iud. 19.
Reiection. Exception 1.
a bad Magistrate, say they, is yet better than none: ( (...). Aristoxen. apud
Stob. c. 41. Et Sopocl. Antig^n. (...). Exception 2.
Better a Tyranie, than an Anarchie:) so a bad Wife is yet better than none at
all.

But this seems scarce sound.

For first, it were but a very sorry commendation of a Wife, to say, Better
such an one than none at all. Quale bonum, quod bonum non censetur nisi
comparatione maioris mali? Suspecta est mihi bonitas eiu^ rei, quam magnitudo
alterius mali malum esse c^gi^ inferius. Hieron. in Iovin. l. 1.
What manner of good call you that, says Jerome, and before him Tertull. ad

Tertullian, that is not deemed or termed good, but in comparison of some
greater evil? That is not good, to speak properly, but Prout 2 Pet. 2. 21.
Bonum ita est, si per se nomen hoc obtiet. Cae^erum si per mali collationem
cogitur sic dici, non tam bonum est, qua^ ge^^s mali inferioris, quod a
superiore malo obscuratum, ad nomen boni impell^tur. Vt cum d^^itur, Melius est
vno oculo carere quam duob^^. Idem ibid.
less evil only.

Again, when Solomon says, that Prove. 21. 9.
it is better to live on the housetop, or abroad Prove. 21. 19.
in the wild wilderness, than with such an one, he plainly implies, that
(as (...). Plut. ero^ic. Solution 2.
Sophocles says of some friends) it is much better to be without her than with
her; to live solitary, than to live with such.

Secondly, the answer of some others is, that M. Cope on the Proverbs.
Solomon speaks this in regard of the end for which the woman was made, and
for which God gave her, which was Genes. 2. 18. Reiection. Exception 1.
for man's good.

But neither does this satisfy.

For first, Solomon seems to speak here rather of the fruit and benefit that
comes by a Wife, where she is such as she should be, than of the bare end for
which she was made, or is given: And greater is Exception 2.
the evil, if being made and given for such an end, she prove contrary
thereunto.

Again, howsoever Genes. 2. 1^.
the Woman was at first made for man's good: Yet is not every Wife given of God
for good, but some, as Solomon says, Eccles. 5. 13.
of worldly wealth, In malum habentis.
for the evil of him that is to have her: as 1 Samuel 18. 21.
Saul sometime gave Micol his Daughter to David, that she might be a snare to
him. As Rulers are sometime given in wrath: Hosh. 13. 11. De^ iratose^u^dum
^erita nostrae rectores ^pimus. Greg. moral. l. 25. c. 20.
I gave them, says God, a King in my wrath: so are Wives also sometimes given
not in mercy, but in wrath. Eccles. 7. 28. and Prove. 22. 14. (...). Menand.
Stob. c. 70. Solution 3.
The Sinner, says Solomon, and he that God is angry with, shall light upon
such.

Thirdly, others answer, (and their answer is more probable) that it is Piscat.
in Proc. Synecdoche Generis pro specie.
a Synecdoche, a putting of the general for the special; or Mercer in Prove.
an Ellipsis, a defective speech; that there wants the word good: as Esai. 1.
11.
wool, for white wool; and Malach. 1. 14. and R. Kimchi ibid.
a Male for a sound M^le: so Leuat. in Prove.
a Wife for a good Wife; which the vulgar Latin therefore has put into Bonam
Vxorem. Lat. vulgata. Exception. Solution 4.
the T^xt.

This may well seem somewhat: but yet this is not all: there seems somewhat
yet more in it than so.

Jewish Talmud, an ungracious Sonn^ is called (...) (...), (...) fili^^ pro

an Eunuch, a Man no Man; and the B^t, or the Flitter-mouse, a Bird no Bird:
and the Ferula, or Giant Fennel, a tree no tree; and the P^mice, a stone no
stone: So a bad Wife in Salomons reckoning, a Wife no Wife.

It is like that of S. John: 1 John 2. 4.
He that says, I know him, and keeps not his Commandments, lies. But what
then? Does every one that knows God, keep his Commandments? Does not S.
Paul say of some, that Romans 1. 21.
when they know God, they glorified him not as God? yea, but Hinc ^r A^r^ae.
Vbi non est p^a, non est ^a. Drus. apoph^h. l. 1.
such knowledge, in S. John's account, is as no knowledge: it is at least 2 Pet.

like sort here Solomon, He that finds a Wife, meaning only a good Wife; as
if none but such deserved that Name.

So that the Point of Instruction which we observe hence is this, that She
that is not a good Wife is as good as no Wife.

hands, and feel not; feet, and walk not: they have the limbs and lineaments
of a Man, but without motion and action: And so those; Esai. 56. 10.
they are called Seers; but they see not; and Watchmen, but they watch not:

part of their Parents; because they have their being originally from them: So
the Woman may well be said to be a part or limb of Man, because she had her
beginning and her being originally from him. For 1 Cor. 11. 8.
The Woman is of the Man, says the Apostle; and not the Man of the Woman: as

Every Wife should be then as a part of her Husband; as a limme of him that

Salomons judgment than either of those to him that has her; the rather since
that as she came from a part nearer the heart than they, so her perverseness
may well go nearer the heart with him, than their untowardness with them.

As well therefore may a wart, or a wen, or a wolf, or a cancer be termed a
part of the body, as that woman be termed a Wife, that is but a blemish, as a
wart; or a burden, as a wen; or a continual heart-sore, as a wolf; or
corruption and rottenness, as a cancer or a gangreane, in the bones of him
that has her. And no marvel then, if a bad Wife be not accounted with God as
a Wife, when she is (not only as good as, but) far worse than no Wife; when
it is so much better to be without her, than with her.

the Philosopher willed his followers to view themselves often in a glass, that
if they found themselves fair and comely, they might be careful to have their
carriage and courses correspondent, if otherwise, they might strive by moral
abilities to make amends for and recompense what were wanting that way: so that
every Married Woman did, if not once a day, or once a week, yet once a month at
least seriously look her self in this Glass. Which it is to be feared that
too many are theresore very loath to look into, because they know how they
shall find themselves there beforehand: And as (...). De Laid Plato. (...).

that old withered Harlot therefore cast away her looking Glass, because she
could not therein see her self such as she would; so they shun this Glass,
not affecting it, because they cannot see themselves therein such as they
should. But Scriptura sacra quasi Speculum me^tis oculis opponatur, ut in ea

let us set the Glass before them that they may look on it, and view
themselves in it if they will: which if it shall show them themselves far
other than they would seem to be, it is not the fault of the Glass, but their
own; let them blame themselves, and not it.

Again, she is a Wife, as Prove. 31. 10.-
Salomons Mother describes her, that is not a good Houswife only in the
House, but a good Wife also to her Husband; that Prove. 31. 11.
does him good all his days, all the days, at least, that she lives with him.

She is a Wife then indeed, and none but she, in whom these two concur,
that she is both a good Hous-wife, and a good Wife too to him that has her.
But how many Married women are there, in whom neither of these are? how many in
whom they meet not? How many are there not Hous-wiues, but (...). Theophyl.
epist. 42.) (...). Simonid. (...), etc. Plut. de virt. and vit.
Drones rather? living wholly on the sweat of their Husbands brows, as the

not Drones, yet Droiles rather than Wives? that will toil and moile indeed

c. 71.
of so crooked and crabbed a nature, of so currish, unquiet, and contentious a
disposition, that their Husbands can have no joy, nor comfort at all of them:
there can be no comfortable cohabitation or conuersing with them.

There may be good cause therefore even for married Women to examine themselves
whether they be Wives or no: since that if they answer not that, which Gods
word and will, yea which the very Name given them, requires of them, they are
as no Wives in Gods account.

But here a Question or two would be answered. Questions 2. Quest. 1.


For first, may some say: If such a Wife be no Wife, may a Man then lawfully
put away such a Wife?

I answer; No: As the Rabbines speak, Os, quod in sort tua cecidit, rodas.
Drus^in Adag. Ben-Syrae.
The Answ.
bone thou must gnaw, that is fallen to thy Lot. There is Pactum Dei. Pro. 2.

a knot of God between you, that cannot be unknit. Matthew. 19. 6.
God has joined her unto thee either in mercy, or in wrath; to be, as he
says of Rulers, Bonus si fuerit, qui tibi prae^st, nutritor tuus est: malus si
fuerit, tentator tuus est. Aug. de Verb. Dom. 6. Answ.
either a Nurse to thee, or a Scourge. And Matthew. 19 6.
Those that God has joined together, Man may not sever.

Yea but, may not a Man forbear to do the Duty Quest. 2.
of an Husband to such an one? For Ita legit Iun. verba Domini, Ier. 31. 32. Et
ego ill^^ Maritus essem? ut concil^et, cum Hebr. 8. 9. (...). Sic Cic. Phil. 2.

Scalig. de Eras^o Epist. 15. Si non est mihi Christianus, ^ur ego illi sim?
why should I, will some say, be an Husband to her, if she be not a Wife to me?

I answer; No: ^eb^s Deo.
Thou owe it to God. And it is not default of duty on her part, that can
discharge thee of thy debt to him. As Basil says of Rulers, (...). Basil.
Caesar. Romans 13. 5. 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14.
We must obey, the good as God, the bad for God. And S. Peter of Masters, that
1 Pet. 2. 18, 19.
Servants must for (...).
conscience sake be subject to the froward as well as the courteous. So must
thou do the duty of an Husband as well to a bad as to a good Wife, for
conscience of Gods command. Do thou thy duty for God, and thou shall have thy
reward from God. As our Savior says Luke 14. 14.
of those that relieve the poor, though they cannot requite them, yet God will
reward them; so though she do not with kindness answer thee, God will requite
thee, in the Resurrection of the Righteous.

And so much briefly for Answer to those two Questions.

Secondly, this Point may serve as for Examination, so for Premonition, to
those that are to enter into Use 2. Premonition.
this estate, that they consider seriously beforehand, what they undertake,
that they weigh well what they go about: Not think as many do, that they
marry for their ease, or they marry to be maintained; to be maintained in
sloth and idleness, or in vanity and pride: like those, who, as Bernard
speaks, Tum demum sine curis victuros se sperant, postqua^ ad curas
pervenerint. Bern. epist. 42.
think to live without Care, when they have gotten a charge or a cure.. No:
thou mariest to be a Wife; and that is not (...). Greg. Naz. Apolog. Nu^u^
nome^. Quomodo Apul. in Apolog. Nuptiarum titulus falsus and imaginarius.
a naked Name, or a bare title; it is the Name of an Office, that has many
Duties annexed to it. Genesis 2. 18.
It is not good for man to be alone, says God; I will make him an Help. He
does not say, I will make him a wife: or, I will make him a woman, that may be
an Help to him: though he meant so to do: but, I will make him an Help. So
that A wife is a Woman joined to Man to be an Help to him: And for a Woman to
be a Wife, is to be an Help to her Husband. But wherein to be an Help? 1 Timothy
5. 14.
Let the younger Women, says the Apostle, marry, (...). Quo loco (...)
includit, quod and exprimitur, cap. 5. 10. quo modo and (...) etiam (...) co^.
prehendit. cap. 2. 15.
breed, (that is, bear, and bring up) children, and govern the family. That
is the end of their Marriage: and to do that, is to be a Wife. And that
therefore must every woman that intends to marry, fore-thinke of, resolve
on, and make account of before hand, if ever she mean to be a Wife.

Hebr. 13. 4.
Marriage is honorable, as the Apostle says: And the Name of a Wife is an
honorable Title. We are wont to give them place before those that be yet
unmarried, unless they be far unequal otherwise. But Henos omnis and o^^^
^um habet. Bern. epist. 42. Nec datur beneficium nisi propter officium. Reg.
Iur. Can. Et, Rationi congruit vt succed^t in onere, qui substituitur in
honor. Bonif. in 6o. reg. jur. c. 77. Use 3. Admonition.
every dignity has some duty annexed unto it. And Non est dignum vt inde
exigas honorem vnde refugi^ laborem. Bernard. epist. 87.
it is not equal that those that refuse the one, should expect ever to enjoy
the other. Yea, the greater the honor is, the greater is the dishonor, if the
duty be not done that that honor exacteth.

Thirdly, it may serve, as for Premonition, so for Admonition; for premonition
to those that intend or desire to enter, for admonition to those that are
entered already. Art thou a married woman then? As Ierom says to the Monk; Lege
quod appellaris; es^o quod diceris. Hieron ad Nepol. and ad Rus^ic. Cura esse
quod audis. Horat. epist. 16.
Read what thou art here called, and be that that thou art stile^d. Thou art
styled a Wife. But thou art no wife, if thou do not a Wives work: no more
than Zech. 11. 5. 16, 17. Non omnes Episcopi Episcopi sunt. Hieron. ad
Heliodor. Nec est verus sacerdos omnis qui sacerdos nominatur. Gratian. d^^r.
d. 40. c. 12. Nec Episc^pus enim aut presbyter est dicendus, cum non si, qui
praeesse velit, prodesse nolit. Iuell. apolog.
the Shepherd is a Shepherd if he feed not his flock. Consider therefore well
what the duty of a Wife is, that thou may indeed faithfully and
conscionably perform it; that thou may make good what in that Name is
required of thee. Else as one says well, that Ipsum rea^ (...) est ^ium non.
en. Sal^ian. de provident. l 4.
the very title of godliness makes the ungodly man guilty: so Magis enim
est damnabilis malitia, quam titulus bonita^is accusat. Ibid.
the very Title that thou art called by, will one day condemn thee. And it
had better for thee never to have taken that Name on thee, if thou do not
that that the Name imports. For as it were no sin for a man not to feed a
Flock, if Ezech. 34. 2, 3. Locum pastoris tenent and non pascunt; stipendia
praedicatoris accipiunt, and non praedicant: doctores vocari volunt, and non
docent: qui merito securi aeternae damnationis succid^nd^ sunt, quia terram
occupant, and fructum non faciunt. Rad. Ardens in Vigil. Ascens.
he did not bear the Name, and take up the place of a Pastor, if he were not
called so to do: So it were no sin for a Woman, not to be in this manner an
Helper to Man, if she did not bear the Name, and supply the place of a Wife,
if she were not called to be such an one.

And this is a great fault, with much grief to be spoken of, among many
Professors, that they seem very careful of the observance of the general
duties of Christianity; but are too too careless of performance of the
special duties of their particular states and places: Forward Christians (to
see to) in the general; but failing foully and fearfully, when it comes to
the particular; careless householders, (and you know what 1 Timothy 5. 8. (...).
Author. quaest. orthodox. apud Justin. quaest. 3.
the Apostle says of such;) sond Parents; negligent and undutiful servants;
no good Husband to Wife; no good Wife to Husband: like a blind Eye in the
body, that has sense and motion, the general faculties, common to it with
the other parts, but wants sight, that is Romans 12. 4, 6. Singula suu^ membra
habent o^^i^iu^: ^culus videt, and non audit; auris audit and non videt; manus
operatur, n^c audit, nec videt; p^s ambulat, nec audit, nec videt, n^c facit,
quod facit manus. Aug. in Psalm. 130. Videmus hominibus inspiratam velut aurig^m
rectricemque m^mbrerum animam, sensusque inj^c^os ad ea dis^er^^^da, quae
^actu, naribus, auribusque and oculis i^dagantur, pedes ad progressum
compositos, brachia ad complexum, etc. nihil aures agere valent, quod oculorum
est, nihil oculi, quod aurium. ^m. d^ re ^ust. l. 3. c. 10.
the proper function and office of it: or a lame hand, that is as sensible, yea
more sensible it may be than any other part of the body, but either cannot, or
does not any work. That which brings a foul scandal often upon Christian
profession; when we shall hear, as many complain, that they have found more
faithful and diligent service in such servants as have given little show of
saving or sanctifying grace, than in such as have made great profession of
piety; so others again, that more loving and kind carriage, and more dutiful
demeanor toward their Husbands, is found in diverse women, though well
natured, yet not religiously nurtured, than in many that would seem to have
made great progress in piety: when many mere civil persons live more
lovingly, more comfortably, more contentedly together, than not a few of those
do, (wheresoever the fault be, sometime in the one party, and sometime in
both,) that are otherwise very forward and eager professors. As Plus in bono
valere vires ingeni Quam Gratiam, infirmat valorem gratiae.
if Nature were able to do more than Grace could do: or as if true piety and
godliness did not exact of Men and Women, a diligent, careful, and
conscionable performance of good Duties, Quaedam De^ praecepta sunt communia
omnium, non specialia aliquorum. Vt ergo audacem r^um temeritatis suae patenti
objectione conueniat, non cum praecepta communia, sed propria and singularia
contemps^sse demonstrat. Greg. in illud 1 Samuel 13. 13. Non obseruas^ manda^^^
D^i, quod mandauit tibi. Use 4. Information.
as well in the one kind as in the other.

Fourthly, it may serve for Information, to inform us how God esteems of
such as are faulty or defective this way. Art thou a Wife; but not a good
Wife? God esteems thee as no Wise; yea, as no Woman; for (...) Hebr. ^t and
(...) Graec.
the same word signifies either.

he called Men, and not them; thereby implying that they were not such Men as

So bad Wives are no Wives in Gods account, nay, nor Women; but wild beasts, as

not the work of a wife.

such: and they must look one day to answer, not only for the wrong that they

ordinance, by bringing through their fault a foul imputation upon it.

Fifthly, this may serve for a Caveat to such as are yet to choose. Do thou
want a Wife, and would have one? Make inquiry for a good Wife; else thou
were better have no Wife; better without her, if she be a bad one, than with
her.

such as we commonly call friends) and yet among his many friends, he may
find little friendship. And so may a man have many a Wife, such as usually
bear the name of Wives, and yet find little enough of that good in any of
them, that Solomon here intimates to be in a Wife.

If thou would have a Wife then, Vbi quaeret quis vxorem, videar an nuptias

a cold comfort, a wife, and yet no wife, in regard of any joy or comfort in
her, in regard of any help or furtherance from her. And were it not much
better for one to be altogether without? For what can be more miserable than to
have a Wife, as (...). Bion apud Laert. Nec habendi fru^tu soelix, and

covetous wretches have wealth; to have the burden of a Wife, and to want the
benefit of her, to have the care, and not the comfort? whereas the man that
lives single, as he misseth of the one, so he is yet withal freed from, and
eased of the other.

Lastly, Is such a Wife in Gods account as no Wife? Let such then never look
for respect or regard with Use 6.
God, for any recompense or reward from God. If thou do not a Wives work,
never look for a Wives wages, never look for a Wives reward. There is no
Christian Servant, that serves his master faithfully and conscionably, but
(...). 3. 23, 24.
he shall for the same from God receive a royal reward. And much more the
Christian Wife, that does carefully her duty to him, whom God has joined her
unto. Such as they be 1 Pet. 3 6.
Daughters of faithful Sara; so they shall have their part and portion with
her. But for the rest, since Avidus ad merc^de, piger ad lab^rem, qua front
sp^ras quod promisit Deus, qui non facis quod iussit Deus? Prius audi
monitiones, and sic exige repromissiones. Prius audi iubontem, and sic exige
poll^em. Aug. de sanct. 4.
they refuse to do the work, they have no reason to expect or look for the
wages. Their wills they may have with their Husbands while they live here; but
they are never like to have any reward at Gods hands. How can they hope that he
should reward them as Wives, who reputeth them as no Wives? yea Ideo d^ter.
(...) sumus, quia ^res esse d^. Saluia^, de Provid. lib. 4.
worse therefore than no Wives, because they ought to have been Wives, and did
bear the Name of such.

In a word; would thou be a Wife in Gods account? Thou must then be a Wife
not in Name, but in Deed. For, Romans 2. 28, 29.
He is not a Jew, says the Apostle, that is a Jew outwardly: (...), Oecum.
s^h^. ^d Phil. 3. 3. Circumcidens cor, non metens carne^. Tertul. ad Marc. lib.
5. Illam enim non (...), s^d (...) Apostolus appellat: quo modo Diogenes Zen^
(...), and E^dis (...) dixit. Laert. vide Ierem. 9. 25, 26.
Nor is that Circumcision, that is outward in the Flesh. But he is a Jew, that
is a Jew within: and that Circumcision that is in the heart and the Spirit is
the Circumcision, whose praise is not of Man, but of God. So she is not a
Wife, that is, a Wife is Name; but she is a Wife, that is, a Wife in Deed: She
is that Wife, Pr^u. 31. 31.
whose praise and reward is both of Man and God; or if not of Man, yet
doubtless of God: From whom, as she does the work of a Wife, so she is sure
to receive the reward of a wife, though Man should not yield it.

And so pass we on to the second Point; from the Branch 2.
Party Commended, to the Commendation here given her.

A Wife then (such an one as deserves the Name Doctr. 2.
of a Wife, as is a Wife not in Name only, but in Deed, not in Title barely,
but in Truth) is (...). Hip^. apud Sto. c. 65. (...). Clement. A^ex ex Eurip.
Paedag. l. 3. c. 11.
an exceeding great Benefit, a means of much good to him that has her: He
that finds a Wife, finds Good, says Solomon. Good; that is, much good,
exceeding great good: (For it is spoken (...).
by way of excellency or eminency;) as if he could not well tell how to
express how much good might by her accrue to the Husband of such an one. And,
Prove. 31. 12.
She will do him good, says Salomons Mother, and no evil, so long as ever
they shall live together. (...). Menand. Benefits 6.
An whole treasury of good there is in a good Wife.

To point only at some general Heads of this Good, that such a Wife brings
with her. For the Time will not suffer me to insist long on ought.

Eccles. 4. 9.
Two therefore, says Solomon, are better then One: in mankind especially
naturally so made. And Adam in Paradise, though he were truly happy, yet was
he not fully Happy: his Happiness was not complete; he was nothing so well
yet as he might be, while he was yet without a Mate. Yea Nec in coelo sine

Secondly for Assistance. Genesis 2. 18.
It is not good, says God, for Man to be alone: I will make him an Help, or
an Assistant; not a Mate only, but an Help; not a Companion only, but an
Assistant too. (...). Aristot. histor. animal. lib. 1. cap. 1. (...). Idem
Polit. l. 1. c. 2. and l. 3. c. 4. (...). Idem Ethic. l. 8. c. 12.
Man being a Creature of the kind, not of those that love only to flock, and
feed, and bide, and live together, as Dawes and Stares do; but of those that
desire to combine, and work and labor also together, as the Be and the
Pismire; he stood in need, as of Society, so of Assistance. Adiutorium

God of his goodness therefore provided such a Mate for him, as might also be

an Help and an Assistant unto him. And if Man before his fall in the state of
innocence stood in need of help, when his labor was no toil to him, no
pain, but a pleasure; then much more since his fall, now that his travel is
become toilesome unto him, and the fruit of his sin has brought so many
burdens upon him, which he was not before, nor ever should have been encombred
with, had he continued in his first estate.

A man has need of it at all times. We are as Romans 12. 4. 1 Cor. 12. 20, 21,

This was a great Be^e^^t before Man's fall. In some respects it is far
greater since his fall. Man was then immortal: Psalm. 49. 20. and 89. 48. and

he is now become mortal and corruptible. And want of issue is consequently

The Roman Lady Cornelia Gracchorum matter cum campana hospita ornamenta illi

inquit, orname^ta mea sunt. Ex Pompon. Rufi. collect. Val. Max. memorab. l. 4.

Cornelia counted her two worthy Sons her chiefest Jewels, whom she showed
therefore to a stranger lodging with her, that desired to see what Jewels she
had: as of (...). Ex Serini memorab. Stob. c. 73.

Solomon also terms them; She his. Well might She be termed her Husbands
Crown, who for his sake and her Childrens good, (...). Plut. in Grach.
refused a Crown offered her after his decease. And well may the Husband of
such a Wife esteem her as his choicest Jewel, who by the testimony of Gods
Spirit does as much grace him that has her, as a Crown does him that wears
it.

And thus you see some few Branches, and rude Conclusion.
Lineaments of that goodness and beneficialnesse of this divine Ordinance,
which the Spirit of God by the Pen of Solomon here points us unto. A good
Wife being, as you have heard, The best Companion in Wealth;
The fittest and readiest Assistant in Work;
The greatest Comfort in Crosses and griefs;
The only warrantable and comfortable Means of Issue and posterity;
A singular and sovereign Remedy ordained by God against Incontinencie;
And the greatest Grace and Honor, that can be, to him that has her.
In regard whereof even (...). Theogn. (...). - Hesiod. apud Clem. Alex. Strom.

the very Heathen themselves also, though led by the ba^e Light of Nature
alone, yet have admired the excellency of this divine Ordinance, and have
worthily preferred it before all other external and temporal Blessings
whatsoever.

Now the due Consideration hereof may well serve;

First to control those of the Church of Rome, who labor so by all means to
vilify, depresse and debase this Divine Ordinance, as if they strove who
should cast most mucke, and dirt, and dung, and filth in the face of it.
Nothing is more odious and contumelious among them than the Name of a Wife, or
a Wiued Person in some. The Name of a Concubine (as we shall show) is more
acceptable with them, and more gracious in their Eyes.

them marry, if they cannot contain. For that is Melius enim nuberent, quam

the better course for them, says Augustine, and long before him Cyprian, Si

Nay, say these Men, Vtrumque malum est, and nubere and vri. imo peius est

Both are bad, but the latter is the better: (as if they strove directly herein
t^oppose the Apostle) Quae nubit post votum, aliquo modo magis peccat, quam
quae fornicatur: quia reddit se impotentem adseruandum votu^, quod quae
fornicatur non facit. B^ll ibid.
It is better for some to burn, than to marry, yea to do that that is far
worse. For by Marriage their Votaries, Monks, Friars and Nuns, are disabled,
says Bellarmine, to the keeping of their Vow, which by Fornication, yea or a
worse matter they are not. And, Bigamia metaphorica, vti Hier. Llamas appellat;

principal enacters, eager vrgers, and severe executers of these their Canons
against married Priests, have yet made no bones of living otherwise indeed
loosely and filthily themselves. Witness Ioannes Cremensis Apostolicae sedis
Cardinalis vbi in solemni apud Londonias Concilio de vxoribus Sacerdotum

Pope Honorius his Legate, who in a Synod here at London, having inueighed
most bitterly against Priests Marriage, and made a solemn Decree against it,
was the very next night taken himself with a Whore. As also Bishop Hulderick,
who tells Pope Nicholas in an Epistle of his to him, that Cum quidam Episcopi
and Archidiaconi ita praecipites sint in libidinem, vt neque adulteria, neque
incaes^us, neque masculorum turpissimos amplexus sciant abhorrere, tamen casta
Clericorum conjugia dicunt sibi foelere, and ab eis jabent and cogunt clericos
abstinere. Hulderic. epist. ad Nicol. Pp.
their Bishops and Archdeacons that make Priests marriage so unsavory, and
compel them to leave their Wives, are yet so leacherously given themselves,
that they neither abhor or forbear adultery, no, nor incest, nor Sodomie.
But one Instance more of their Iniquity in this kind shall suffice. They have
a Canon, that Bigamum censendum, nec ordinandum esse, qui vxorem vnam ante
baptismum, alteram post baptismum habuerit, statuit Innocent. Pp. apud Great.
did. 26. c. 3. epist. 2. c. 6. and ep. 22. c. 2. and ep. 24. c. 6.
if a man shall have had two Wives successively, the one before Baptism, the
other after he was baptized, he shall by the Apostles Rule, (as they Ne bina
pariter aut trina conjugia sartiantur: sed vt singulas vno tempore vxores
habeant. Hieron. ad Ocean. Neque enim secundum reiecit Matrimonium, qui illud
saepe iussit fieri. Theodoret. in 1 Timothy 3.
mis-expound it;) 1 Tu^. 3. 2. Tit. 1. 6.
The Husband of one Wife, be made incapable of holy Orders: Which yet Posse

he should not have been, had he before Baptism in stead of taking that one
Wife lived never so loosely otherwise. And the Reason they give for it is, Quod
peccatum non fuit, non est di^ in bap. ibid. Et Inno* e^t. vbi sup.
because the one being Sin, was in Baptism done away, the other being no
Sin, was not. This when it was questioned in Ieromes time, what says he
(though one otherwise Durior in Matrimomu^, and Nupt^js iniquior. Erasm,
prafat. in lib. contr. Iov^.
not so equal to the Married estate) to it? Rem nouam audio. Quia peccatum non

This is new learning, says he, that something shall be reckoned therefore for
sin, because it is not sin. (...) s^orta, and publica colluvionis sordes,

extraordinarias voluptates vtriusque sexus m^^ata natura, Christi sonte

Are all Whoredoms, defilements with common Queanes, impieties, paricides,
incests even with parents, the unnatural pollutions of either sex by
extraordinary lusts, washed off in Baptism? And do the stains of a lawful
Wife stick on still? And are the Stews then preferred before the
Bride-chamber? That Praet^reunt quod non licet; and objiciunt quod concessum
est. Ibid.
they pass by that that is not lawful, and object that that is. Or Tam
ma^ulosum nomen vxoris non potest vlla nouitate deleri. Ibid.
is the Name of a Wife so foul a matter, that nothing can wipe it away? Belike
Audiant Ethnici, etc. audiant Catechumeni, qui sunt fidei candidati: Ne vxores
ducant ante baptisma, ne honesta jungant Matrimonia: sed promis^uas vx^res
hab^ant, in* o caeveant qual^cumque vocabulum Coniugis; ne postquam in Christo
crediderint, noceat eis, quod aliquando non con^^binas, nec meretrices, sed
vxores habuerint. Ibid.
Men had need to take heed how they take wives before Baptism, and contract
honest Marriage; Yea they were better to live as those that have Wives in
common; or rather by all means avoid any Name of a wife whatsoever; lest that
after they come to believe in Christ, it become prejudicial unto them that
they had not Queanes, or Harlots beforetime, but Wives. Vere Scribarum and
Pharisaeorum similes: culicem liquantes, and camelum glutientes. Ibid.
These are like the Scribes and Pharisees indeed, straining a Gnat, and
swallowing a Camel. Imputatur infoelicitas coniugis mortuae: and libido
meretricia coronatur. Ibid.
They punish Martage; and (not pardon only, but even) crown Whoredom.
Iu^scriptum est, Honorab^les Nuptiae, and cubile i^aculatum. Tibi Iegitur,
F^rnicatores autem and Adult^ros iudicabit Deus. Ibid.
Whereas of the one it is said, Marriage is Honorable, and the Mariage-bed is
undefiled; of the other, Whore-mongers and Adulterers God will judge. Quomodo
tuae sordes lu^ae sunt, and meae munditiae sordidatae? Si sordes ^mundantur,
quanto magis munditiae non co^quinantur? Ibid.
Sure, if that that is filthy be cleansed in Baptism, that that is clean is
not thereby defiled. And if for this one Particular Jerome charge them so
deeply: how much more, all considered that before has been said, may they
be truly charged (as their own Glossers being Canonists also themselves
confess of them) to show more grace and savor to Incontinencie, than to
Chastity, and to set lawful Wives behind Concubines and Queanes? So that if
it were, as these men seem to say, nay as they peremptorily auow, it were not
only no great good, (as being no furtherance, but a maine Sunt opera bona,
quae tamen maiora bona impediunt vt ducere vxorem. Bellarm. de Menach. c. 15.

Secondly, Is a Wife such a Benefit, where she is such as she should be? This
may serve to put us in mind of the great corruption of Man's Nature, what a
miserable deprauation Sin has brought upon Mankind, even to the inuerting
and corrupting of the greatest Blessings of God both on us and in us.

For (...); Anuphan. (...). Epicharm. (...). M^nand. (...). Idem St^b. c. 66.
what greater curse, or heavier cross befalls a Man often than a Wife? Or what
one thing produces more mischiefs and miseries than Marriage does, where the
parties are mismatched? Many a one Sylla Foelix si non habuisset vxorem. Et

And whence comes all this but from Man's corrupt Heart, that Apes ex herbis

like a Toad or Viper, turns all that it takes, and the juice of all that it
feeds on, though never so good and wholesome of it self, into rank poison?
This their corrupt nature therefore must married folks seek to quell and to
kill, if they desire to find that fruit in, and reap that benefit by this
Ordinance, that Solomon here speaks of, and to enjoy that sound comfort
either in other, that Christian Man and Wife ought to do. And this their
Corruption must they ascribe it unto, if they meet with the contrary, and
find ought otherwise therein. In moribus culpa est, non in aetate; in senum
stultitia, non in vitio sen^ctutis. Cic. de Senect. Use 3.

Again, all evils, as the Elementum in locosu^ non ponderat. Simpl c. and
Coelo l. 4.. 46.
Elements, are most combersome and burdensome, when they are out of their
proper place; as Impiety in Professors, Injustice in Judges, because
Criminosior est culpa, vbi honestior est status; and atrocius sub sancti
nominis professione peccatur. Salvian. de Provid. l. 4.
Impiety is in the proper place of Piety in the one, Eccles. 3. 16. Vbi, qui
sedet crimina vindicaturus, admittit. Cyprian. ad Donat.
Iniquity in the proper seat of Justice in the other. In like manner from a
Wife is matter of discomfort more grievous, because discomfort there is in the
proper place of comfort, a great evil in the native seat and soil of a great
good. And what greater Judgment can befall any Man, than to have those very
things turned to his evil, that were at first ordained for his good; those
things especially converted, or perverted rather to his greatest evil, that
were created for his chiefest good? To have Psalm. 69. 22.

an Ocean of troubles, an inextricable Labyrinth of inconveniences and
annoiances. As if that estate like Genes. 3. 18. Hebr. 6. 8.
a cursed soil, yielded nothing, though never so well manured and managed, but
thorns and thistles, but briers and brambles, but hemlocke and henbane, and
the like noisome weeds. As if all the good and joy of a man's life were gone,
when he had once gotten this good; all the comfort of it were over, when this
Comforter once came; and (...). Simo^d.

men do not yet therefore either shun or abandon other courses of Life in
regard of those Crosses that either are incident unto them, or that occur in
them.

It is true indeed that Marriage brings many more Cares, as more Charge, with
it, then the single life is ordinarily encombred withal. But yet are those
Cares counter^ailed with many singular Comforts that the single life is berest
of: and (...). (...). is (...). Co^ qua (...) (...). (...). (...).

From the want whereof the annoiances, inconveniences, mischiefs and miseries
against this estate objected do for the most part arise; either because the
parties matched sort not well together, or want wisdom and discretion to
carry themselves as they ought, either toward other.

Not to add, that in regard of some such cares and encombrances as necessarily
accompany that estate, to abhor and abandon Marriage, being otherwise so
beneficial, and so excellent an ordinance of God, is as Clemens well
observes, a note but of (...). Clem. Alex. Strom. l. 2.

unthankfulness to the Author of it.

Fifthly, let the married Wife learn hence what to apply her self unto, that
she may be a Wife indeed. The more Prove. 31. 12.
good she does her Husband, the more Comfort he receives from her, the more
Benefit he reapeth by her; the more she does the office of a Wife, the more
she answers the Name she bears.

And on the other side (...). Nicostrat. Stob. c. 72.
she cease to be a Wife, yea to be a Woman, when she cease to be a means
of good to Man: Since that the Woman was not made but 1 Cor. 11. 9.
for Man, and Genes. 2. 18.
for his good; and therefore she answers not her original, if she be not
so. And in vain will it be for her to bear the Quid enim proderit appellari
quod non es? Quid nomen prodest, vbires non est? Aug. in 1 Joan. tr. 5.
Name of that she is not.

Lastly, hence may the Married Man also learn his lesson. For how ought he to
make much of her, that is a mean of so much good to him? Prove. 31. 31.
Give her, says Solomon, of the Fruit of her Hands: requite her in the same
kind again. If Prove. 31. 12.
she do thee good all thy days; then ought thou all thy days by all
means in all kinds to seek her good, her temporal, her spiritual, her
eternal good. For Ab alio officia pos^ens, promittit sua. Sen. de ben. l. 2.
c. 18. In lusu est aliquid pilam site excipere; sed non dicitur bonus lusor,
nisi qui apt e and expedite remisit quam exceperat. Ibid. c. 32.
good requires good; and one good-turne, we say, asks another.

Otherwise if thou be found failing herein, her goodness to thee shall one
day witness against thee. And the better ^he is to thee now, the worse it
shall go with thee then. Better it were for thee to have no Wife, or one as
good as none, if thou be not an Husband to her, as well as she is a Wife to
thee; if thou be not an instrument of good unto her, as well as she is unto
thee. For look Sunt parts mariti, sunt and vxoris-Invicem parem ista
desiderant regulam. Sen. de ben. l. 2. c. 19. (...). Isidor. Pelus. lib. 3. ep.
12. Branch 3. Question.
what is required on her part toward thee, is required the same on thy part
toward her: which unless thou answer her with, thou art no more an Husband to
her, than she, if she should fail therein, were a Wife unto thee.

But how may a man come by such a Wife, as is here spoken of? may some say:
such a one as shall be a means of so much good to him that has her?

She must be sought; says Solomon. For (...). Sopho^l.
finding Answer.
implies seeking. And Luke 11. 10. (...). Sopho^l. Plut. de fortun.
He that seeks, finds; says our Savior. We must not think, becouse
Salomen elsewhere says, that Houses and inheritance are of the Fathers, but a
good Wise is of God; that therefore no industry is to be used on our part, but
that men should lie still, or sit them down, expecting that God should drop
Wives down out of the clouds for them, as Towns were said to come into Que^
aemuli ipsius dormientem pin^ (...). Plut. Sylla. Vnde enatum Proverb. (...).

Timotheus his toiles, while he slept. No; unless we seek, we are not like
to find. And if by seeking we may find, if after much search made, we may
light on such an one, we are well.

Such a Wife then must be sought.

And so sent Genes. 24.
Abraham his Servant to seek a Wife for his Son Isaak. So Ruth 3. 1, 9.
Reason 1.
Naomi tells Ruth her Daughter in Law, that she will seek out some fit
match for her.

There is good Reason to seek such an one in two Respects:

First in regard of the Rarity, the Difficulty. Because such are not easily
found. Genes. 41 38.
Where may we find such a Man? says Pharao of Joseph, implying that such an
other as he could very hardly be found. And, Prove. 31. 10.
Where may a Man find such a Woman? says Solomon. As he says elsewhere of a
faithful Friend; Prove. 20. 6. (...). Aristot. vt Laert. ex Favorin. comment.

Many Priests, and yet Few Priests too; says one of the Ancients: many in

sought for a Man in a multitude of Men: so may such a Wife as Solomon here
speaks of, be sought, yea and scarce found sometime, among a multitude of
Women.

Secondly, In regard of the worth and dignity. It is well worth a man's labor.
He need not think much of his search, if he have good success in it. As the
difficulty of finding requires it; so the dignity of the thing sought
requiteth it. ^habere ^^gas: Et stultus labor est ineptiarum. Martial. l. 2.
epig. 86.
It is no wisdom indeed to seek after toies and trifles, matters of no
moment, that will not recompense a man's pains, when without much difficulty
they cannot be had. But a worthy Woman is a matter of worth. She is well worthy
the seeking. She is (...). 19. 14 (...). Nicostr. t. Stob. c. 72.
a greater blessing than either House or Inheritance: and (...). 31. 10.
her price is abone Pearls. And if there be Psalm. 4. 6. -itum est in viscera
terrae: Effodi^ntur opes. Ovid. M^t^m. l. 1. Omnesque terrae fibras exquirimus.
Plin. hist. l. 33 Quin and maris etiam gurgites omnes. Quest. Answ. Means 1.
so much seeking generally on all hands after the one, much more may there
justly be as much after the other.

But how must she be sought then?

I answer: First (...), etc. Antipat. de convict. ^marit. (...). Hesiod. oper.
Means 2.
by due and diligent consideration of, and careful search and inquiry into
the nature, quality, and disposition, and into the life, courses and
conueisation, of the party motioned or affected for Marriage: whether she be
so qualified as a Wife ought to be, and as is fit for one to be that should be
thy Wife. For (...). Callicratid. Stob. c. 68. (...). Euripid. Antiop. (...).

male inaequales veniunt ad aratra juvenci? Si qua voles ap^e nubere, nube pari.
Ovid. Epist. 9. (...). Plut. nupt. praec.
fitness in special, as well as goodness in general, is one maine ground of
the good and benefit that a Wife is to bring to him, whom she is matched unto.

Secondly, by using the help and taking the advice of Friends. A course
especially to be embraced and entertained of those that are themselves
unexperienced, or that are yet under the power of others. So did Genes. 28. 2,
5. and 29. 18.
Jacob herein follow his Father Isaacks advice; contrary to Genes. 26. 34. and
27. 46.
the practice of his Brother Esau And Ruth 3. Means 3.
Ruth was content to be ruled by her Mother in Law Naomi, though having not the
power over her of a natural Parent.

Thirdly, by seeking unto those that are the Parents or Governors of such as
they affect or desire, being yet under the power of such. So did Genes. 24. 48,
49.
Abraham's Servant deal with the Friends of Rebekka. And Genesis 34. 4, 6, 8.
Sichem (though Genesis 34. 2, 7.
he had been before indeed too forward) with the Brethren of Dinah, and with
her Father Jacob, by his Father Hamor; the very light of Nature leading and
directing them thereunto.

Fourthly and principally by Prayer to Means 4.
God. As did Genesis 24. 12, 14. (...). Chrysostom. tom. 8. sermon. 15. (...) Ibid.
Abraham's Servant, when he was sent to seek a Wife for his young Master: And
as Genesis 28. 2, 3. Branch 4. Doct. 4.
Isaak did when he dismissed his Son Jacob with Instructions and charge what
course to take concerning a Wife.

For (and so pass we to the next Point) God is the principal Doner here. He
that will find a Wife, says Solomon, must obtain her of God. And, Prove. 19.
14.
House and inheritance are of the Fathers; but (...). Simonid. Stob. c. 71.
Reason 1.
a prudent Wife is of God. From God therefore it is that a Good Wife must be
had. And no marvel.

For first, (...). Pindar. Nullum bonum quod non a summ^ bono. Aug. de diverse.
3. Quisons est and origo bonorum omniu^. Salvian. de provid. lib. 4.
All good is of God. Iam. 1. 17. Reason 2.
Every good Gift, says S. James, is from above. And if every good Gift, then
this also among the rest doubtless, if not above the rest, being so principal
a good.

Secondly, Psalm. 127. 4.
Children, says the Psalmist, and the fruit of the womb is Gods Gift. And,
Josh. 24. 3, 5.
I gave Abraham Isaak; and Isaak Jacob and Esau, says God by Joshua. And,
Genes. 33. 5. Reason 3.
They be the Children that God has given me; says Jacob to Esau. If Children
be his gift, the Wife is much more. Neither can we have them without her; not
her without Him.

Thirdly, Every good Woman is Gods Daughter: as Luke 3. 38.
Adam is said to be Gods Son: 2 Cor. 6. 18.
You shall be my Sons, and my Daughters; says God. He has a special
interest, more than ordinary, in them: and they cannot therefore be had without
him.

Fourthly, Conjugium non facit sola copula carnalis. Nuptias non concubitus,
sed^consensus facit. Vlpian. reg. Iur. leg. 31. Matrimonium non facit de
floratio virginitatis, sed pactio nuptialis. Ambr. instit. virg. c. 7. (...).

Muson. de nupt. scop. Stultum est, venatum ducere invitas canes. Hostis est
vxor, invita quae ad virum nuptum datur. Plaut. Stich. 1. 2.
better it were, Reason 4.
that Men and Women should never come together, unless they bear hearty
affection either to other, unless they join hearts as well as hands. But as
Prove. 21. 1.
the Kings Heart; so Solus Rex mentium Deus. Aug. in Joan.
the hearts of all Men and Women are in Gods hand. As Psalm. 33. 15.
he made them all, and Acts 15. 9. and 1. 24. 1 King. 8. 39.
he alone knows and Psalm. 33. 15.
understands them all; so Ezra 7. 27, 28. Nehem. 1. 11. Psalm. 106. 46.
he windeth and turns them all which way he will, nor can any win or wind
the Heart of any contrary to his will.

Now, as such a Wife is of God; so (which was the last Particular)

It is a special favor of God for any Man to obtain such an one.

As Prove. 8. 35.
the Man that gets Wisdom; so the Man that gets a Wife, Prove. 19. 14.
a wise Woman, (for there is (...)
the same Phrase used in both places) has obtained a special favor (that is,

Tertull. ad uxer. l. 2.
a singular Blessing, and such as he is wont to confer on such as he
specially favors) at Gods hands. Psalm. 128. 1.
Blessed is the Man that fears God, says the Psalmist, and that walks in
his ways. And Psalm. 128. 3.
his Wife the fruitful Vine, comes in in the first place, as one of his
chief Blessings; and his Children, the fruit of this precious plant, in the
next. And, Sirac. 26. 1. (...). Eurip. (...). Idem.

Now the Consideration of these Points may well serve, Partly for Reprehension,
and Partly also for Admonition.

not at all; make no search or inquiry; but take Wives as they stumble on them

ductam postridie repudiavit. Su^ton. Tiber. c. 35.
such as cast Lots for Wives this day, be willing the next day to part with
them again.

Secondly, it serves to reprove those, that seek indeed, but seek amiss;
that seek without light, yea that refuse to use such light as would be lent
them, and is tendered unto them, and that, when they have more need of it then
they are, it may be, aware of. Such are they, the younger sort especially, that
think scorn to take advice of their Friends, imagining themselves Cons^j
satis est in me mihi. Ara^hne apud. Ovid. Metam lib 6.
wise enough to advise themselves, and to make their own choice. (...).
Hierocl. de nupt.
That that proves the very bane, and utter overthrow of many an one, that
might well have done well, if they would have been ruled by those that wished
them well, and were both able and willing well to advise them: but refuse to
hearken to any good advice, till it be too late, when they come to be scourged
soundly with a rod of their own making.

Thirdly, it serves to reprove others that seek Use 3.
amiss in another sort: they knock at the wrong door, they go not the right
way to work; that seek Genes. 34. 3.
by indirect courses to ensnare the hearts and entangle the affections of those
whom they desire, being under the power of others, passing by their Parents, or
others under whose power they are; and whom as (...). Hier^cl. deliber. offic.

priori adjudicat Philo Iud. sacitque (...), uti est revera, (...). Use 4.
God has set in his place, so he has in part imparted to them his power of
disposing. Such cannot expect any blessing from God on their seeking, seeking
contrary to his word and will.

Fourthly, those especially come here to be reproved, that pass wholly by God,
never look up to him: use their own industry, it may be, and take advice of
their Friends, but never think on or look after him that ought to be their
principal aduiser, their chief Counselor, their best Friend, either to crave
his advice or to ask his good will. And no marvel, if so much neglecting him,
they speed accordingly, they miss of that (...). Eurip. Menalip. (...).

Rhenan. in annot. Hinc pie virgo orthodoxa a^ Haeretic^ solicitata, (...).
Cle^. Alex. Stro. l. 3. Admonition. Use 5.
Thou would take it evil, that any man should be a Suitor to thy Daughter,
and never come to ask thee thy good will. Much more may God take it evil that
thou should seek to win his Daughters love without craving his good leave.

Fifthly, Is such a Wife a special Favor of God? Then be careful to reconcile
thy self in the first place unto God, if thou would hope, or do dedesire
to have such a special favor at his hands. If thou desire a Man's Daughter,
thou will seek to get her Fathers good will: And if there have been any
breach formerly between thee and him, thou will use all good means of working
an accord and agreement between you, ere thou will come to make suit to him,
to bestow his Daughter upon thee. For little hope could thou have to
prevail with him in a suit of that nature, Legantur quae de Scipionis filia
Tib. Graccho desponsa Live. hist. l. 18. Val. Max. l. 4. c. 2. and Gell. noct.
Attic. l. 12. c. 8.
Use 6.
so long as there were jarre and enmity between you otherwise. And how can
thou hope to obtain the like favor at Gods hands, if there be enmity and
hostility between him and thee?

Lastly, let such married persons as God has blessed in this kind, learn
hence what cause they have to be thankful to God either for other. Yea let the
jarres and discord that they see between other Men and Women mismatched, and
the cross and cursed carriage of them either toward other, together with the
manifold annoiances and grievous mischiefs and inconveniences that ensue
ordinarily thereupon, be a means to put them in mind of Gods great mercy and
goodness to them, and of his special favor toward them; and to make them
the more thankful unto him for the same.

And since that they have received either other from God, let them herein
strive to show their thankfulness unto God, by endeavoring to bring either
other nearer unto God, by Hebr. 12. 24. (...). Greg. Naz in Basil and in
Athenas. (...). Idem in Maccab.
helping either other forward in the good ways of God: Do either with other,
as Anna did with her Son Samuel, as 1 Samuel 1. 11, 27, 28.
she had him of God, so she bestowed him on God again; return either other
again to God, and labor to return them Ita Socrates Aes^hini, qui se ei dono
dederat, Habebo curae, ut te meliorem tibi reddam, quam ac^epi. Senec. de beni.
l. 1. c. 8.
better than they received them. The better they shall make either other, the
better shall they enjoy either other: and the nearer they shall bring either
other to God, the more good, through Gods Goodness, shall they have either of
other. The more Man and Wife profit in the Fear of God, the more comfortably
and contentedly shall they live together, the better shall it be for them both.

FINIS.
