A good Exhortation to every man what he should do when he goes to bed and
when he rises.
To a new Northen tune.
AT night lie down prepare to have:
thy sleep, thy death, thy bed, thy grave.
A rise a wake think that thou have:
thy life but lent, thy breath a blast.
Let not the sluggish sleep,
close up thy waking eye:
Until with judgment deep,
thy daily deeds thou try.
He which one sin in conscience keeps,
when he to quiet goes:
More ventrous is then he which sleeps,
with twenty mortal foes.
^herfore at night call unto mind,
(...) the day have spent:
(...) if naught amiss thou find,
if ought betime repent.
And since thy bed a pattern is,
of death and fatal ^earie:
Bedward it shall not be amiss,,
thus to record in very.
The stretching arms, the yawning breath,
that I to bedward use:
Are patterns of the panges of death,
when life must me refuse.
The nightly Bell which I hear sound,
as I am laid in bed:
Foreshowes the Bell which me to ground,
shall ring when I am dead,
My bed is like the grave so cold,
and sleep which shuts mine eye,
Resembles death: Clothes which me fold,
declare the moules so dry.
The frisking fleas resemble well,
the wringling worm to me:
Which with me in the grave shall dwell,
where I no light shall see.
The waking Cock that early crows,
to wear the night away:
Puts me in mind the trump that blows
before the later day.
The splendent Sun whose golden ray,
no eye can dure to see:
Declares how in that dreadful day,
God shall appeer to me.
The rising in the morn likewise,
When sleepy night is past:
Puts me in mind how I shall rise
to judgment at the last.
I go to bed as to my grave,
God knows when I shall wake:
But Lord I trust thou will me save,
and me to mercy take.
Thus will I wake, thus will I sleep,
thus will I hope to rise:
Thus will I neither wail nor weep,
but sing in godly wise.
Repent, repent you sinners all,
and call to God for grace:
That he may grant unto us all,
in heaven a dwelling place.
FINIS.
