Oh read over D. John Bridges / for it is worthy work: Oranepitome of the
first Book / of that right worshipful volume / written against the Puritanes
/ in the defense of the noble clergy / by as worshipful a priest / John
Bridges / Presbyter / Priest or elder / doctor of Diuillitie / and Deane of
Sarum. Wherein the arguments of the puritans are wisely prevented / that when
they come to answer M. Doctor / they must needs say some thing that has been
spoken.

Compiled for the behoof and overthrow of the unpreaching Parsons / Fyckers /
and Currats / that have lernt their Catechismes / and are past grace: By the
reverend and worthy Martin Marprelat gentleman / and dedicated by a second
Epistle to the Terrible Priests.

In this Epitome / the foresaid Fickers / etc. are very insufficiently
furnished / with notable inabilitie of most vincible reasons / to answer the
cavil of the puritanes.

And lest M. Doctor should think that no man can write without sense but his
self / the senceles titles of the several pages / and the handling of the
matter throughout the Epitome / show plainly / that beetleheaded ignorance /
must not live and die with him alone.

Printed on the other hand of some of the Priests.

Martin Marprelate gentleman / primate / and Metropolitan of all the Martins in
England. To all the Clergy masters wheresoever / says as follows.
WHy my clergy masters / is it even so with your terriblenes? May not a pore
gentleman signify his good will unto you by a Letter / but presently you must
put your selves to the pains and charges / of calling four Bishops together.
John Canterbury / John London / Thomas Winchester / William of Lincoln: and
posting over city and country for poor Martin? Why / his meaning in writing
unto you / was not that you should take the pains to seek for him. Did you
think that he did not know where he was himself? Or did you think him to
have been clean lost / that you sought so diligently for him? I thank you
brethren / I can be well though you do not send to know how I do. My mind
toward you / you shall from time to time understand by my pistles. As now /
where you must know / that I think not well of your dealing with my worship /
and those that have had of my books in their custody. I Will make you rue that
dealing of your^ / unless you leave it. I may do it / for you have broken the
conditions of peace between us. I can do it / for you see how I am favored of
all estates (the puritans only excepted.) I have been entertained at the
Court: Every man talks of my worship. Many would gladly receive my books /
if they could tell where to find them. I hope these Courtier^ will one day
see the cause tried between me and you. I have many sons abroad / that
will solicit my suite. My desire is / to have the matter tried / whether your
places ought to be tolerated in any Christian commonwealth. I say they ought
not: And I say / John Canterbury and all / ought to be out of his place. Every
Archbishop is a petty Pope / so is every Lord bishop. You are all the pack of
you / either hirelings or wolves. If you dare answer my reasons / let me see
it done. Otherwise / I trow / my friends and sons will see you one day
deposed.

The Puritans are angry with me / I mean the puritan preachers. And why?
Because I am to open. Because I jest / I iested / because I dealt against a
worshipful iester. D. Bridges / whose writings and sermons tend to no other
end / then to make men laugh. I did think that Martin should not have been
blamed of the puritans / for telling the truth openly. For may I not say /
that John of Canterbury is a petty pope / seeing he is so? You must then bear
with my ingramnesse. I am plain / I must need call a Spade a Spade / a Pope a
Pope. I speak not against him / as he is a Councellor / but as he is an
Archbishop / and so Pope of Lambeth. What will the Puritan seek to keep out
the Pope of Rome / and maintain the Pope at Lambeth? Because you will do this
/ I will tell the Bishope how they shall deal with you. Let them say that the
hottest of you / has made Martin / and that the rest of you were consenting
there vnto^ and so go to our magistrates and say / lo / such and such / of our
puritan / have under the name of Martin written against your laws: and so
call you in / and put you to your oaths whether yon made Martin or no. By this
means M. Wiggington / or such as will refuse to take an oath against the law
of the land / will presently be found to have made Martin by the bishops /
because he cannot be gotten to swear that he made him not: And here is a
device to find a hole in the coat of some of you puritanes. In life sort / to
find the Printer / put every man to his oath / and find means that Schilders
of Middleborough shall be sworn to / so that if any refuse to swear / then he
may be thought to be the pri^^ter. But bishops / let your fatherhoods tell me
one thing? May you put men to their oth^ against law? Is there any law to force
men to accuse themselves? No. Therefore look what this dealing will procure at
the length: Even a plain praemunire upon your back / for urging an oath contrary
to statute: which is a piece of the foreign power bannished by statute.

For the rest that will needs have my books / and cannot keep them close: I
care not how the bishops deal with such open fellows. And bishops / I would
I could make this year 1388. to be the woonderful year / by remoouing you all
out of England. Martin has told the truth / you cannot deny it / that some
of you do injuriously detayne true men's goods / as John of London: And some
have accounted the preaching of the word to be heresy / as John of Canterbury
/ etc. All of you are in an unlawful callng / and no better then a brood of
petty Popes. It will be but Folly for you to persecute the Courtier Martin /
until you have cleared your selves (which you can never do) of the crimes he
has laid to your charge. Alas poor bishops / you would feign be hidden in a
net I perceive. I will grow to a point with you. Have but a free disputation
with the puritans / for the unlawfulness of your place / and if you be not
ouerthrowen^ I will come in / and do unto you what you think good: for then I
will say that you are no Popes. There was the Demonstration of Discipline /
published together with mine Epistles which is a book / wherein you are
challenged by the puritan / to adventure your Bishopprick^ against their lives
in disputation. You have gotten a good excuse to be deaff at that challenge /
under color of seeking for Martin: Your dealing therein is / but to hold my
dishe / whilo I spill my pottage: you defend your legs against Martine
strokes / while the puritans by their Demonstration / crushe the very brain of
your Bishopdomes. Answer that book / and give the puritan^ the overthrow by
disputation / or else I see that Martin has undone you. Be packing bishops /
and keep in the P^^rcivants / or if you will needs send them abroad to molest
good men / then pay them their wages / and let them not pull it out of poor
men's throats like greedy dogs as they do. You strive in vain / you are laid
open already. Fryar^ and Monks were not so bad^ they lived in the dark / you
shut your eyes / lest you should see the light. Archbishop Titus and Timothy /
will never maintain your popish callings. I have pulled off your vizards /
look to your selves / for my sons will not see their father thus persecuted
at your hands. I will work your woe and overthrow / I hope: And you are
already clean spoiled / unless you will grant the puritans a free
disputation / and leave your persecuting.

Either from country or Court /
M. Martin Marprelate / will do you hurt.
Rhyme doggrell /
Is good enough for bishops I can tell /
And I do much marvel /
If I have not given them such a spell /
As answer it how they cannot tell.
Doctor Bridges up and down /
Writes after this fashowne.
The Epitome of the first book / of this worthy volume / written by my
brother Sarum: Deane John. Sic foeliciter incipit.
THe whole volume of M. Deanes / contains in it / 16 books besides a large
preface / and an Epistle to the Reader: The Epistle and the preface / are not
above 8. sheets of paper and very little under 7. You may see when men have a
gift in writing / how easy it is for them to daube paper. The complete work
(very briefly comprehended in a portable book / if your horse be not too
weak / of an hundred threescore and twelve sheets / of good Demie paper) is a
confutation of The learned discourse of Ecclesiastical government. This
learned discourse / is a book allowed by all the Puritan preachers in the
land / who would have all the remnants and relics of Antichriste dauntehed
out of the Church / and not so much as a Lord B. (no not his grace himself)
dumb minister (no not dumb John of London his self) nonresident / archdeacon
/ abbie lubder / or any such loyterer / tolerated in our ministry. Insomuch
/ as if this strong hold of theirs be overthrown / hoe then all the fat is
run to the fire with the puritanes. And therefore has not the learned and
prudent M. Deane dealt very valiantly (how wisely let John Cant. cast his cards
and consider) in assaulting this fort of our precise brethren / which he has
so shaken with good vincible reasons very notably out of reason / that it has
not one steane in the foundation meare then it had.

Trust me truly / he has given the cause sicken a wipe in his brick / and so
lamb skinned the fame / that the cause will be the warmer a good while for it.
The reasons that moved him to take this pains was / that at the first coming
out of the Learned Discourse / the D. in a Sermon of his at Paul's cross / did
not only confute a great part of this book / but by his said learned sermon /
made many of the puritans relent and distrust their own cause. what cannot a
smooth tongue / and a schollerlike wit bring to pass? (...) brother dean that
you are ^uch a doer.
Some other of the puritans / in deed / being more untoward to learn then the
rest / stood stiff in their former opinions / concerning the government of
bishopps / (notwithstanding this sermon of M. doctors) and challenged him for
his sermon / offered him ye disputation (yea and the non plus too / or else I am
deceived) here M. dean promised them a large confutation of the Learned
discourse / which in this ^ooke he has now performed: wherein he has behaved
himself very scholerlike. His style is as smooth as a crabtree cudgel. The
lieader cannot choose but have as great delight therein / as a Jack an Apes
has in a whip: he has so thumped the cause with cross blows / that the
puritans are like to have a good and a sound cause of it as long as they live.
In this one thing I dare prefer him before any that ever wrote: to wit / that
there be not 3. whole periods for every page in the book / that is not graced
with a very fair and visible solacism. O most excellent and surpassing
eloquence. He speaks every thing so fitly to the purpose / that he never
touches the matter in question. A rare gift in a learned writer. He has used
such variety of lerning / that very often he has translated out of one man's
writing / 6. or 7. pages together / note here a new found manner of
bookemaking. And which is more strange / he brings those testimonies for his
purpose / whose very words translated and set down by him / are as flat against
the purpose whereto he brings them / as fire in quallity is contrary to
water. Had not he a right use of his wits think you / while they were thus
bestowed? Not to stand long in this place of those quallities in him / whereof
before I have made some mention to his praise in the former Epistle. Whatsoever
might be for the ornament and furthering of an honest cause / he has in this
book so defied them all / that elsewhere you are to seek for them / for here
they are not to be found. Wherein he has very wisely and prudeutly observed the
decorum of the cause in hand. Like lips like Lettice / as it is in the
proverb. The goodness and honesty of the matter he handled / required such
good and honest proffs as he brought. Let those that handle honest and godly
causes / labor to bring good prooffs and a clear style. Presbyter John
defended our Church government which is full of corruptions / and therefore
the style and the prooffs must be of the same nature that the cause is. The
priest leaves not so much as the title of the Discourse unexamined. The title
forsooth is A learned discourse, etc. A saucy title / but what says the
learned Bridges unto it. O you know he is good at a stale jest / ever since he
plaide my Lord of Winchesters fool in his sermon at Sir Mary's Church in
Cambridg / and therefore he iesteth at the title. I us / the puritans have
nothing to do with that sermon: why should they hit their brother in the teeth
therewith? he has made their betters to laugh at him for his Sermon since that
time. And why should he not? for his grace will allow him / because he is
content that bishops should be Lords: he has subscribed / wears a corner cap
and a tippet / and would gladly come to the honor / to wear that which might
make him a lord spiritual / and if it were a shaven crown / or a coxcombe /
which his grace his articles would enioyn him to wear / what hurt could that
do unto him?

Now I wonder what our brethren will say to this / that their book is scoffed
at / at the first dashe. I am sure their noses can abide no jest. What say they
man / do you make any question of that? I warraunt you they will affirm that
the author of the Learned Discourse / and 500. green heads more that are on
their side / within 2. Syllogismes / would set the deane of Sarum at a flat non
plus, and answer his whole work in a threepenie booke^ Are they so good at
disputing and writing in deed? I hope his Canterburinesse will look to this
gear / and suffer them to have liberty neither to write / nor to dispute / the
black Ox has trodden on his foot / he has had some trial by woeful experience
/ what small credit / and lesse-gaine there is to be had / either in writing
or disputing with these fellows.

To the matter. The state of the whole controversy between my brethren
bishops / and my brethren the puritans / and so between this worthy doctor /
and these discoursers / is: whether the external government of the Church of
Christ / be a thing so prescribed by the Lord in the new testament / as it is
not lawful for any man to alter the same / any more then it was lawful to
alter ye form of regiment prescribed under the law in the old testament. And
see whether if there be any government in ye Church (as necessarily there must
be / or else all confusion will ensue) the same must be by those offices and
officers alone / and by no other / which the Lord has set down and limited in
his word. Or else whether man may alter these offices and officers at his will
and pleasure / and make new offices and officers / as he may in the civil
governments. The puritans say / that these offices and officers / which our
savior Christ and his Apostles did ordain / ^re unchangeable / and that it is
not lawful for any prince to alter them / no not though the circumstances of
times / places and persons / should seem in regard of conuenience / to
enforce him thereunto. The doctor with all the Lordly priests in the land /
hold the contrary. And swear it to be lawful for the magistrate to ordain
what government he will in the Church: yea / that the Church governors /
contrary to the flat commandment of our savior Christ / Luke 22.25.26. may be
Lords. And that the Church government prescribed by our Savior Christ / and
enjoined by the Apostle / was not immutable / as the regiment under the law
was. In so much as in the opinion of M. Bridges and the rest of the clergy /
Paul was deceived Ephesians the 4.13. in saying that pastors and doctors were
to continue in the Church until we al meet together: that is unto the end of
the world. Here then is the puritans^ ^ / for the permanencie of this
government / and M doctors no.^ Our brethren (for so of his mere courtesy it
pleases M. deane to call them / whom men commonly call puritans and
precisians) to make their party good / propound the cause by a like example
after this sort.

The sacrifices of ye old law (after the building of the temple / were to be
offered Deuteronomy. 22.21.
only at Jerusalem / by a Leuite / of the li^e of Alia^on 1. king. 8.29.
only: unless a prophet extraordina^ily ordained it otherwise as 2. chron.
6.5.

Eliah did. And the said sacrifices were to be consumed and burned / only by a
fire proceeding from the Lord. 1. King. 28.32.

Leuit. 9.24.


Briefly / none were to m^ddle with the tabernacle / or any thing belonging to
the service of God / but the sons Nomb. 3.12.35.
of Leui / whom the Lord appointed for his own service. So that if any
sacrifice were offered out of Jerusalem / by any other then a son of Aaron /
consumed by any Leuit. 30.10.
strange fire / or any service about the Tabernacle Ezekiel. 44.^.

(...) Corah Dathan Abi^am / and the two hundredth and fifty captains of the
Congregation / who not being of the sons of Aaron / would needs offer incense
before the Lord.

In like sort / Christ Jesus ordained / that when there should be any
ministers in his Church / they should be able to gather together Ephesians. 4.12.
the saints / and that those in their proper and limited places / should be
either pastors or doctors. In like sort / he ordained that some should Acts.

of the poor should be committed Acts 6.6. romans 12.8. phil. 1.1. 1. tim. 3.8.
unto Deacons / under which also the widows and Church servants are contained.
He farther ordained / that before these officers should be instituted / and as
it were invested into their offices / there should be had one examination of
their 1. Tim. 5.22. and 3.10. romans 12.3.
fitnes to exemte the same / and their unreprovable Titus 1.6.7. 1. tim. 3.8.
and 5.11
life. (And that) their ordination should be Acts. 14.23. and 6.6. 2. tim. 1.6.
by imposition of hands / with fasting and prayer. And by these 4. officers
(say our brethren) Pastors / Doctors / Elders and Deacons / God has appointed
that all matters of the Church / should be decided and determined. For these
officers only (and none else) must have to do with the preaching of the ^ord^
administering the sacraments / making of mu^sters / excommunicating / and
administering of all other Church censures and punishments. But as for civil
government / punishment and censures / they must not meddle with them. Because
these things only belongs to the civil magistrate whose off^^e is not to
be usurped by any of the ^^^mer. Thus our brethren set down the whole state of
the controversy / and thus by Scripture they confirm their I / and overthrow
M. doctors no. Parlous fellows I assure yo^. For believe me / it would put a
man to his trumps / to answer these things soundly by scripture again. Well /
M. Deane on the other side / very stoutly proosteth his no^ page 54. Page 54.
of his by a conner axiom to begin withal on this manner.

A very fit reason to prove the mutabilitie of the Church government.
If this Church government, by pastors, doctors, elders and deacons, be
necessary, then the Church in some age and place, either had this government,
or has labored for it. A most true and tried truth / what then brother Sa^^^^
/ do you assume from this true government? ^ay sof^ there ^a mass deane / I
trow the puritans will not drive me to make syllogismes in this book. That is
no part of mine intent / for if I had thought they would drive me to such
pinches / I would not have meddled with them. Nay by their leave / if the
assumption or proposition be either more then I can prove / or be against my
self / I will omit them. Now good doctor send me the measure of thy head /
that I may provide thee a good nightcap.
Pardon me I pray ye my masters / I will set down nothing against my self / I
have brought in a true proposition / and that is enough for one man / I think.
Let me see what you can say to that. Mine assumption shall be brought forth at
leisure. Is the wind at that door with you brother deane. I perceive you will
be of the surer side / howsoever it goes. But brethren / what then say you to
M. deanes reason? Your answer I know / may be of 3. sorts. First you may say
that the reason is popish. Secondly / you may demand / whether it be mid summer
Moon with him or no / because he brings in / a couex proposition / and
assumeth nothing. Can you blame him in so doing: For the assumption must have
been either affirmative / or negative. Now if he had assumed affirmatively / he
had overthrown himself: If negatiuely / then you brethren / would have denied
the assumption / which M. Deane would never have been able to prove. So a man
might put himself to a pecke of troubles in deed. And this is a point for
your learning / closely to pass by that / wherewith a man shall have no
honesty to deal. Thirdly / you may grant the proposition to be very true (to
what end then did Sarum bring it in) because Geneva / and other the Heluetian
Churches have this government / and you labor for it. Seely fellows / can you
say no more / then upon them again M. deane / with your second reason thus
concluded / page 55. with 4. good substantial terms. Page 55.
No government is an uniform prescript that cannot be altered, but that which
God in his word prescribes to be such. But the Lord has not prescribed the
Church government to be such, as all things appertaining thereunto, is an
uniform prescript that cannot be altered. Therefore the Church government is
not an uniform prescript which cannot be altered.

Thou know not how I love thee for thy wit and learning sake / brother John
(as for thy godliness / I might carry it in mine eye / and see never a whit the
worse) notwithstanding me thinks your syllogism should have four terms. 1
The Church government. 2 All things belonging to Church government. 3 An
uniform prescript / etc. 4 A government prescribed in the word.

And ten to one brother / you never drempt to have me^ with your brother Martin
/ when you wrote this volume. Well seeing we are now come together / let me
about this point of Church government / father mis^erly spur a question unto
you. The bishopp^ woonted manner in this controversy / to run from the
consideration of those things that are moral unto things indifferent.
Tell me then bethout dissimblation / what the bishops and you mean / when the
question is concerning Church government / to run by and by into the
controversy of things appertaining to Church government: which for the most
part are indifferent / and not set down in the word / but left to the
discretion of the Church. As though there were no difference between the
questions. By what and how many offices and officers / the Church is to be
governed? In what causes it is lawful for church governors to employ
themselves: whether it be lawful for one of them to meddle with the office of
another? Or for one to do that action wherein the whole Church should be an
agent? Whether they may be magistrates and church governors both at one time?
As though (I say) there were no difference between these questions which are
grounded upon the certain prescript rule of the word that cannot be changed
/ and other questions: which although they belong to the service of God / and
the outward government of the Church: yet depend not upon any thing prescribed
and exactly set down in the word / but upon the grounds^ of what in regard of
the changeable circumstances of time and place may be most comely / most decent
/ most orderly / and best belonging to edification. Of this latter sort are
these points: whether it be most convenient / that prayer should begin at 8.
or 9. of the clock: whether the sermon should continue an hour or an hour and
an half: whether the pulpit should be of wood or of stone / etc. Concerning
which / the word has expressly set down nothing / but commanded that al of
them should be squared according unto the rule / let all things be done
honestly by order / and to edification. 1. Cor. 14.40.


Now reason with one of our corrupt bishopps / or any other that defend their
corruptions / and say that our Church government is wicked and unlawful /
because it is not expressly. set down in the word. They will by and by demand
/ whether any thing belonging to the service of God be lawful / but that
whereof there is express mention made in the word. And whether any thing
belonging to Church causes be changeable. As whether it may be lawful for the
minister to preach in his gown / whereas there is no express mention that our
Savior Christ and his Apostles did so? Or whether it may not be lawful for the
Church of Geneua to begin his sermon at 8. of the clock / whereas it may be the
Church of Hel^etia begins at 9. or at 10. So the worshipful Deane of
Lincoln (sometimes unlearned John Whitgift) not being able to deny / but that
the ministers ought to be chosen by ^ayes: demands whether women forsooth
were not to have a voice in their election or no? And thus all the pack of
them run from the matter in controversy / unto the question of things
indifferent. By this means / thinking they may bleare the eyes of men / if they
cann bring any cavil / though never so impertinent to ye matter. As who say
all men were so ignorant / unlearned / and blinded with the world / as
nonresidentes and (...). are. I Will besire them to leave this order / or else they
are like to hear of it. And i will besire you pres ryter. Bridges / not to bring
four terms in your syllogism again / for an you do / it shall cost me the
setting on^ My brethren the puritans in this place / it may be / would grant
your syllogism to have but 3. terms in it / and so would say / that the
words (all things) in the assumption may be (...) ambiguous / for if thereby
your worship mean all things appertayning to the circumstances of the outward
service of God / as the hours of prayers / the number of communicantes in one
congregation / etc. as you set down your meaning to be / page 56. sect. 3.
Then they say your assumption is nothing to the matter in question. The
question my masters? why what a question is that? Did not I warn you aforehand
/ that M. deane had made a vow / not to meddle with the question. But if say
they^ you mean the Church officers and their subjects / concerning which the
controversy is instituted then we deny the assumption.

And I warrant you brethren / he proves the assumption by 2. reasons / page
55. First Christ is the owner and governor of his house which is the Church,
concerning the inward and spiritual government of the heart. page 55.
Therefore he has not prescribed the outward government thereof, Surely
brother John / I marvel upon what topike place this reason is grounded / for
scripture is not the foundation (you know) of the established government you
defend. As though (will M. Bridges say) you are ignorant brother Martin whence
I drew this argument. You would make the world believe / that you know not
that I resoned as my brother London did / in his H^^^orough of faithful
subjects. The bishop of Londons book.
I tell you / I drew mine argument from that place whence he drew his / which
you shall find set down / page 42. of his book (for I am sure M. Marprelat
your book has the pages set down in it / although the printed book has
them not) O I remember well in deed brother Sarum ye place you mean / and I
remember that John Elmars reason is very like yours. For (says Elmar) The
scripture medleth with no civil policy, any farther then to teach
obedience, therefore it teaches not what persons should bear rule. And again
/ page 44. The ministers office is over the soul, therefore a minister must not
reprehende disorders in the civil state. page 47. Paul's commission is to
teach obedience, therefore he has nothing to do to call for a redress of
matters in civil policy: yea in this 47. page / line 19. John of London has
these words / which to his commendation I will set down as follows.

And this being a great matter of policy (says he) as it is the greatest
(for it contains the whole) it cannot be within the compass of Paul's
commission, and so it follows, that Paul in this place meant no such matter as
they gather, or if he did, he did it without the compass of his commission,
etc.

Now truly brother Bridges / I thank you heartily for putting me in mind of
this point / I hope my brother London cannot be offended with us / for /
quoting him for our authority. I see now it is no marvel though Paul be put
to silence within the diocese of London / for I perceive there is an old
grudg between my Lord and him: yet I commend your fatherhood / better then
his Lordship in this point. For in the 57. page of your book / you allow
Paul a larger commission / where you say / that the word of God is able to
make the civil government perfect: yea, and that the perfection of the civil
government, must be out of the word, and in the word inclusiuely. But for all
this / you must give me leave to doubt how this reason of yours follows.
Christ has prescribed the inward government / therefore he has not prescribed
the outward. It may be your second reason will make the matter more clear
unto me / which is in the same page / and thus framed. Page. 55.
We are his Church if we hold fast the confidence of our hope unto the end.
Therefore there is no external government of the Church set down in the word.
This reason / to omit what ground it has in the word / is very plausible even
in nature: is it not think you? A man is a man though he go naked. Therefore
by maste^ deanes reason / the Lord has ordained no covering for his nakedness.
Again / a man is a man if he be once born / though he never eat meat:
therefore it is not the ordinance of God he should eat meat. Let our cauilling
brethren / go see now what may be brought to reproach the credit of such
inforcible proofs. M. Doc. doubtless will stand to his tackle whatsoever they
bring. If they should be so ignorant as to deny the consequent of both these
reasons / they must stay until M. Deane has read ever his predicables / and
predicaments with friar. Titlemanes rules / De inveniendis medijs.v^. until he
has gotten a bishoppricke / before he prove either of them. And it may be
then to / that he will prove what they deny / as master Canterbury has
proved / that which master Cartwright confuted.

In the mean time / mark how stoutly M. deane goes forward. Page. 56.
And although page 56. he meet by the way with his nowne sweet friend
Bellarmines / a popish writers distinction / of agreeable / and not contrary
to the word (the papists affirming all their m^ditions to be agreeable / and
none of them contrary to the word) yet his answer / page 57. Page 57.
to the place of Paul / 2. Tim. 3.7. is as good and as canonical / as any of
the former reasons / concluded thus. The place of scripture which does not
deny, but that the civil government, which must be inclusiuely according to
the word, Your co^sequent is false master Deane.
may be elsewhere prescribed then in the word, that place also does not forbid
the Church government to be fetched from some other fountain, then the
prescription of the word. But this place 2. Tim. 3.7. does not deny, but that
civil government being a government nor prescribed in the word, may be
learned elsewhere, then out of the word, and yet be according to the word.
Also it does not deny but that the church government may be a church
government according to the word, which is not therein prescribed.

It is a hard matter I tell you / to conceive all the wisdomnes of this
syllogism. For if you mark the proposition very well / you shall therein
find the errors (as M. doctor accounts them) of Peter and Paul / very
notably ouerthrown. The one of them calls 1. Peter 2.13.
the civil government / an humane ordinance: the other Ephesians. 4.12. rom
12.8. 1. cor. 12.28.
affirms our savior Christ to have ordained every minister and Church
officer / that were at any time to be in the Church / and to have tied the
ministerye unto two ordinary functions / of pastors and doctors. But his
worship lighting upon william Woodcockes divinity / puts in the
propositions / both / that the Church government is an ordinance of man /
invented and ordained by man / and also that there may be as many sorts of
ministers in the Church (if the magistrate will have it so) as there be degrees
of civil officers in a commonwealth. For the Church government is no more
prescribed in the word (says the deane) then the civil government is.

You may see then / how headie and perverse these our brethren are / that had
rather stick unto a poor fisherman and Tentmaker / Peter and Paul / in a
matter of truth / then embrace the manifest falsehood of so plain an untruth
/ with a fat deane / and all the brave spiritual Lords in the land. Well fare
our clergy men yet / (who being like the priest whereof John of London makes
mention of / in his foresaid book / page 32. line 3. Another course at you
brother London.
that swear by his priesthood / that if the Trinity were not in his portesse /
he would not believe it) will allow of nothing / but that which is in the B. of
Canterburies Articles / be it never so often read in Paul's writings.

And I trow M. doctors reasons following / will make the puritans stoop unto
his grace / and leave their peeuishnes / and running beyond their commission /
after the example of Paul / in speaking against any established government:
yea and a government established by act of parliament. I think my L. of London
gave Paul enough / as we heard before / for meddling with state matters. And
his grace admonishes the puritan preachers often enough / that howsoever they
have truth of their side: yet they must not run beyond a law / and without
law: if they do / though they have Peter and Paul to speak for them / yet by
your leave / he has in his hand that which will tame them and all their
fa^tors: If the abusing of the high commission and an whole popedom be able to
do it. But all this while / we go not on forward with you brother Sarum. Page
^7.
Therefore in the next page / let us here how you fetch your brethren over the
coals with your next reason / whereof trust me / I know not / almost though it
were to gain a bishopric / how I should make a good syllogism / but I will
do my best after this manner.

It suffizeth that such orders as are not prescribed in the word / as things
necessary to salvation / be they civil or ecclesiastical / be only foulded
up within those that are prescribed / and to make them as things expedient to
edification / order and comelines / for obedience sake / although they be none
of those things that appertain to any necessity of our salvation / or to any
absolute necessity of our obedience. But such is the Church government as it
is not prescribed in the word / as necessary to salvation / or of any absolute
necessity of our obedience. Therefore it is sufficient that the Church
government be only foulded up within the things prescribed in the word / and
be of the nature of the things that only belong to edification / order and
comlines.

I was never so afraid in my life that I should not come to an end / till I
had been windlesse. Do you not see how I pant? Our brethren now are to come to
their answer / Concerning necessary to salvation / then say they / we would
know brother Bridges / and thrice learned brother Bridges / we would know
what you mean: whether such a necessity / as without which / men cannot be
saved. I mean even the same (says M. deane) as it appears page 60. line
21.22. of my book: then we reply that nothing is of this necessity / but only
justifying faith / and we deny the sacraments to be of this necessity. For
the thief on the gallows Luke 23.43.
was saved without them. And we think moreover / that your impiety and
ignorance (M. deane) to be outrageous / and intolerable (say they) in that you
go about to teach the holy Ghost what he shall prescribe in the word: because
by this proposition of yours / nothing should be prescribed therein? concerning
the sacraments: for they are not there prescribed / as things necessary to
salvation / in such sort as men cannot be saved without them.

But if you meant not this necessity / then we would know / if you can tell
your self what you would have / (forsooth brethren / a bishoppricke he would
have / and all such troublesome fellows as you are / bannished ye land) Hoe
yon mean such a necessity / as every Church is not bound to observe the
same order upon their obedience. For example / you mean that every Church or
several congregation in Europe / professing the truth / is not bound to have
their Church covered with lead / as the monastery of Sarum is. M. deane / my
friends is not so precise as he think^^ it necessary for them to have a sermon
upon the Sabbath.
For they may lawfully have it covered with slade or tyle. You mean that they
are not bound every one of them / to have a sermon upon the wednesday / for
they may lawfully have it upon any other day in the week. That every Church is
not bound to have a pulpit 4. foot high / for they may without sin have one
lower or higher / if expediencie and edification require the same. That is even
my moaning in deed / and so ^ would / page 59. (says M. dean:) That these
things should be urged no otherwise, then Paul does urge them: that is, not
placing the perfection of religion in them, or making them orders necessary
for the building, but rather for the ornaments of the building, and so squaring
them all according unto the rule: Let all be done honestly, and by good order.
Is this your meaning (M. doctor) you have spun a fair thread. Can you tell your
brother Marprelat with all your learning / how to decline what is Latin for a
goose. Why this every one of your brethren his self will grant to be true /
and they never denied it at any time. But this is not the question. For it is
neither concerning Church officer / office / or any part of Church
government / whereof the question is instituted: but it is concerning matter
of circumstance. Yet (brother John) what do you mean by these contrarieties in
this point. For you have heard / page 59 / you mean by things necessary to
salvation / matters of indifferency: and page 60. line 21 / 22. you mean an
absolute necessity / without which / men cannot be saved. Do you think that
you can answer men / by saying that you in deed wrote / page 79. But D. Perne
wrote page 60. the which you had no leisure to ouersee. This is a pretty
answer / is it not think^ you? Let me take you again in such a pranck / and
i will ^ourse you / as you were better to be seeking. Gammer Gurtons needle /
then come within my fingers. And warned M. doctor / say the puritanes / we
will give you leave to take either of these 2. necessities to be your meaning.
If you mean / as page 59. be necessary to salvation / then they deny the
assumption. And yet they will have one course more at the proposition before
they go / because it came from home: and will bring forth a Jesuit / unless
betimes it be had to the house of correction. They say the^ that you still
join with Bellarmine. For in the state of the question / concerning tradition:
He has the same cavil / cap. 3. lib. 2. against Calvin / Luther and Kemnitius
/ which you have concerning comdines / and order in this place / against your
brethren. What a saucy fellow was that Bellarmine / that must needs publish
his work for the Pope / one just year before you published yours for the
Archbishop? Could he not keep it in / until both your books might be published
together. For now these puritans do shake you very shrewdly / for borrowing
popish stuff from Bellarmine / and overthrowing her Majesty's supremacy:
whereas I am persuaded / that although Bellarmin had never written / yet the
master that taught him / would in time have fully instructed you / in all these
points that are forged upon his Anvil. And although (as I think) he saved you
a great deal of study / yet I pray you let D. Perne write unto him / that he
may know his fault / and you be certified when he writes again / that both
your books may come forth together.

Now if in your assumption (say our brethren) if you mean by necessity to
salvation / that without which men cannot be saved as before: it is true / that
the Church government is not of this necessity / for in that sense as was said
/ the sacraments are not necessary to salvation / or of a^y absolute
necessity unto our obedience. Nay to be no traitor / no ^dolator / no
whoremonger / is not of that absolute necessity to salvation / but yt he may
be saved / which has been (so th^^ now he be none) sometimes an idolator /
etc. If you mean that other necessity / whereby al they that will have any
government in the Church / are bound to have that only / and none else which
God has prescribed in the word / or else transgress yt inviolable prescript
ordinance of God / concerning the government of his Church. Then they deny
the assumption. Here is a pretty matter / that one poor syllogism must be
thus handled / I would his worshipp knew who they were / that thus deal with
him. I hope it should not be long ere (...) the Pur^iuant (as unnatural a
sourfaced (...) / as en^^ was in that office) should trudge for them. They
shall be met with one day I doubt not.

Page 18.
M. deane page 58. shows very wisely that men must warily take heed how they
build (for the Bb. have these 30. years so builte / that they are almost come
to digg at the foundation of the Church) le^t velike men should by building
after the manner of the Apostles / overthrow the Monastery of Sarum. And that
were pity seeing from thence these natural reasons following have issued.

Every thing that is prescribed in the word, contains in it the perfection
of religion. But the Church government does not contain in it, the
perfection of religion. Therefore the Church government is not prescribed in
the word. No brother John / nor baptim neither: For baptim does not contain
the perfection of religion in it / and therefore as you may wisely conclude /
it is not prescri^^^ in the word. We may alter what we will now / so that the
part which we alter / contain not the perfection of religion in it / and be
agreeable unto my ^. of Cant. articles. For they must be altered in no raze.
And what reason is it that the Lord supper should be received under both
kinds / if the civil magistrate and the Church / will otherwise ordain. For
no sacrament contains in it the perfection of religion: and therefore by M.
deanes ^r oposition / the celebration thereof / is not prescribed in ye (...). A
man might keep good stir in ye pulpit / or in writing / having but this ground
allowed him. And I think of such a preacher as this should be / John of
London spa^^e in his foresaid book / page 49. line 2. where he describes his
preacher after this manner: that he should be no milksop, no white liuered
gentleman, that for the frowning and cloudy countenance of every man in
authority, will leave his flock and cry Pecaui. And again / in this page /
When they come to handigripes, John (...) you must knows was a very good with
a twoe hand swerd in his youth.
they must not only flourishe, but they must know their quarter strokes, and
the way how to defend their head, etc^ Such a pr^cher I say as this / would
quickly with his quarter strokes / ouerturne al religion / and with very good
reason / if deane John's proposition be true / That every thing which is
prescribed in the word / contains in it the perfection of religion.

Will you have any more of these blows brethren / then touch them again
parson John / with the second reason in this page. Every thing that is
prescribed in the word, is of the substance of the building. The church
government is not of the substance of the buylding. Therefore it is not
prescribed in the word. Nothing but pa^alog^^^nes. Sir Bridges / do you not
know before whom you speak? You think now that you play my ^. of Winchesters
fool / do you? Or that you are in the monastery of Sarum among your roaring
quiristers. I would advise you / learn this of me: That the Church government
is a substancial point of religion. And therefore of the substance of the
building. That it is a substantial point / it appears / because it is
included within the commandment which our Savior Math. 28.19.20
Christ gave unto his Apostles / when he sent the^ to build his Church /
commanding them / not only to teach and baptize all nations (which are the
things that you think only to be substantial unto the building (Nay wicked
bishops / will not acknowledge preaching to be of the substance of the building)
but also to teach them to observe whatsoever he commanded them. Now he Romans
12.^. 1. cor 12.8.2^. Net. 15.6. Ephesians. 4.12.
orday as ^ he commanded that the church should be governed by these 4. offices
/ or else the Apostles would never Acts. 6.6.^.^.14.23. 1. Cor. 23.1. tim.
5.17. ^am. 5.14.
have observed them / and prescribed them unto the Church. Was there nothing
wanting unto the building in Greek / while they wanted Fiders there. Titus. 1.5.
If there was not / why should Titus stay there / to ordain Fiders in every
city? If there was / what a dunse art thou to deny the Church government
(...) salvation / such a necessity / as without which men cannot be saved. The
next reason is for the golden pen. Either necessary, or vnnecssarie: But not
necessary to salvation. Ergo, unnecessary. Thus M. Doc. carries away the
matter very clearly. Only he strayneth a little courtesy with the Learned
Discourse, in putting necessary to salvation / for appertayning to salvation.
You know he that can with a guilty conscience / have a faculty for two livings
/ may as well be dispensed with / for a lie or two. And I wisse these fellows
need not to be so precise of swearing by faith and troth / and strayning out a
small lie for a benefit / they commit groser sins many times. And this M. Do.
has overthrown their whole buylding in general. Now he comes to the
spoiling of every particular part thereof.

But before I come to these points / I care not inasmuch as there has been
often mention made of my L. of Londons book / between our brother Bridges and
me / if I set down some part of my judgment / concerning that book.

O but M. Martin / will my brother Bridges say / will you meddle with that
book / which M. Amar wrote in the defense of her Majesty's government. Here
is an inde little person in this speech I know / for the D. should not give me
this warning / but you know my purpose is to play the dunse after his example.
So you will give me and the Bb. just cause to say that you are a sedicious
fellow / and one that disliketh of her majesty's government. And by this
means you will incense many against you / that otherwise could not but favor
your worthiness and learning. I would they durst say / even any B. of them
all say that I dislike her majesty's government. I would make poor Bb. of
the^ or I had done with them / if they should slander me in this sort. And they
dare but raise up this slander against me / I will persecute the whole
generation of them / and make them weary of slandering while they live. Shall
they deal with me / as you do (brother Bridges think you) with Daneus in your
book / whom you bring as an enemy to her majesty's government: whereas he by
name / and in manifest words commends / and prayseth very highly her
majesty's regiment above all others. Or will they deal with me / as they have
done with M. Beza? A horrible Part and an ungodly. ^onfer the Eng^ish with the
latin copy.
M. Beza cap. 44. of his Confessions written in Latin / says / that he
disliketh their judgments / who think it unlawful for women to bear rule.
This book is translated into English / but it has all this point left out in
the English copy / to the end they may (as it is reported) bear her majesty
in hand / that M. Beza is against her regiment / and so / that her majesty may
be brought in detestation of the Church government which M. Beza favors / as
being a Church government that cannot stand with the civil government of women.
What say you to this gear Bb. have you dealt well with M. Beza? Deal thus with
me an you dare. If you will say that you had no such intent / as to slander M.
Beza / in leaving out the said point. Then I say that you are enemies unto her
majesty's government / in that you will wipe out of a printed / and a
translated book / that which was written in her defense: especially suffering
the rest of the book to be printed.

To return to John of Londons foresaid book / I say although he has therein
/ spoken against bishopps / even our bishops now living / and so against
himself / as being now a B. yet that his book is a carnal and unlearned
book / smelling altogether of earth / without rhyme / and without reason. And
that his speaking against bishops therein / was but a snare to catch a
bishopprick / as it now appears. The particular sentences and marginall notes
shall be set down / and where I set any note upon your book / there shall be an
m. for difference sake / added thereunto. We will beginn with your own words
unto the Bb. that is unto your self and your brethren / page 23. Page 23. The
Prelates have time of rep^nta^^^s


Oh they may thank God (say you) that they have this time to breathe them, and
bethink them of their naughty and hellishe cruelty, and to call daily and
hourly for pardon and forgiveness, for let them think, that if they be not
punished in this life nor repent: God accounts their deeds so vile, Note you
prelates.
and their ^ults so heinous, that no temporal pains be enough for such
offenses. And therefore reserueth them to eternal damnation. Oh howl and
wayle you priests and prelates, not for the danger you stand in, of loosing
your bishoprics and benefices, your pride and your pomp, your dignities and
honors, your riches and wealth: But for that hell has opened her mouth wide, and
gapeth to swalow you for the sheding of so much innocent blood, for murdering
so many martyrs (though this her true in our bishops / yet let me in steed
thereof say / for imprisoning so many innocents / and murdering the souls of
so many in ignorance) and spoiling Christ's church of so many glistering and
glorious ornaments, The Queen deceued by her churchemen
commended of all for their learning and discommended of none for their living.
Nowa lest any man should think that he writes these things to popish
bishops / you are to know / that he wrote them unto such as were bishopps in
the reign of her majesty / unto bishops prosessing the gospel in name / but
in deed deniyng the power thereof. And in the next page line 10. he has these
words against those bishops / and now against himself. Page 24.


But Christ knowing the bounds of his office, would not meddle with externe
policies, translating of realms, and depriving of true inheritors. Now when
he was desired to be arbiter betwixt two brethren: (...). 12.
he asked not how the plea stood, Spiritual men should not medl^ wi^h poll^ces.
but who made him an officer? Divines (me thinks) should by this example, not
give themselves too much the bridle, and too large a scope, to meddle with
matters of policy, as this is, whereupon depends, either the welfare or
ilfare of the realm. If these two offices, I mean ecclesiastical and civil,
be so iumbled together, as it may be lawful for both parties to meddle in both
functions, Mark this well you ^haha^^ state men. m
here can be no quiet, nor well ordered common wealth.

Thus the reader may see / what a pattern of hypocrisy this wicked bishop
since he wrote this book / has showed himself to be: in taking upon hi^ / not
only that calling / which in his own judgment is unlawful / but also in
joining those two offices together: the coupling whereof / he confesses to be
joined as well with the most vile disorder / as with the dangerous disquietnes
of the common wealth. And yet he has not here left off speaking against
bishops. Therefore / as before in the Epistle has bin touched / he deals
more roundly with the^ / page 103 then before / in these words. Advise to the
bishope.
Come off you bishops, away with your superfluities, yield up your thousands,
be content with your hundreths, as they be in other reformed Churches, where be
as great learned men as you are. Let your portion be pristlike, and not prince
like. Let the Queen have the rest of your temporallities and other lands,
Bishope lands.
to maintain these wars which you procured, Will you be content Bishop it
shall be so now? m
and your mistress left her, and with the rest to build and found schools
throughout the realm: that every parrishe Church may have his preacher, every
city his superintendent, to live honestly, In any case / let there be one
minister above the rest of his brethren. m
and not pompously, which will never be, unless your lands be dispersed and
bestowed upon many, which now feeds and fatteth but one. Remember that
Abimelech, when David in his bannishment would have diued with him, 1. Sam. 21.
kept such hospitallitie, that he had no bread in his house to give him out the
show bread. Where was all his superfluity to keep your pretenced
hospitallitie? For that is the cause you aleage, why you must have thousands,
as though you were commanded to keep hospitallitie, rather with a thousand,
And I would mine Epistoma^^^^ were in print / there should you see that would
not like you. m
then with a hundred. I would out countriman Wicklieffes book which he wrote,
De Ecclesia, were in print, and there should you see, that your wrinches and
cauillations be nothing worth.

Hitherto you see that this Balaam / who has I fear me / received the wages
of unrighteousness / spoken in general / as well against the callings of
bishops / and their usurping of civil offices / as against their pride / pomp
and superfluity. Must not he think you / have either a most scared / or a
most guilty conscience / that can find of his heart / to continue in that
calling: yea / and in the abuse of that calling / which his own conscience /
if he would but awake it / tells him to be unlawful? The Lord give him
repentance / if he belongs unto him / or speedely rid his Church of such a
scourge. And may not all the former speeches be fitly applied unto him? Is
without dout. But the next he may be thought to have written to himself /
which he has set down / page 34. Page 34. lin. 15.
As if you should say, my L. Lubber of London is a tyrant, Ergo he is no
Bishop. I warraunt you though he granted you the antecedent, Does be mean
Watson the pure ciuant trow you m
which he can hardly deny, yet he would deny the consequent, or else he would
call for wiely Watson to help him. Here brother London / you have crossed your
self over the costard once in your days. I think you would have spent 3. of
the best Elmes which you have cut down in Fulham / and 3. pence halfepenie
besides / that I had never met with your book. But unless you / and John of
Excetor / with Thomas Winchester / who have been in times past hypocrites as
you have been / leave off to hinder the word / and ver godly men / I will make
you to be noble and famous bishops for ever. And might not a man well judge yon
three to be the desperate Dicks / which you brother London / page 29. affirm to
be good bishops in England. For to allude unto your own words / page 28.29.
Whereas other bishops in the land / for the most / (only John Canterbury
excepted) lest they should one day answer for their proceedings unto her
majesty / and gain the evil will of the noble men / and gentlemen that
favor the sincerity of the gospel / will not seem to be such dealers as
you 3. are / though they serve at an inche in their place / to maintain his
graces pride and cruelty / to stay the course of the gospel / and to fetch in
men with in the compass of subscription / yet are they those for the most part
/ that will imprison none / and trouble very few unless it be for fear that if
they should tolerate to much / they should have a check of their worshipful
Paltripolitan. But you three / like furious and senceles brute beasts dread no
peril / look no farther then your feet / spare none / but with tooth and
nail / cry out / down with that side / that favors the gospel so. Fetch
them up with purciuants / to the Gatehouse / to the Fleet / to the Marshalsey /
to the Clinck / to Newgate / to the Counter with the^. It makes no matter with
you (I follow your own words brother London) so you may show your selves (in
show though not in truth) obedient subjects to the Queen / and disobedient
traitors to God and the realm. Thus far I have followed your words / howbeit
I think you are not well pleased with me / because yo^ mean not to stand to any
thing you have written. Nay you hold it unlawful now / for a preacher / as
far as the two tables of the law do reach / to speak against bishops / much
less any ungodly statute. And yet you say / page 49. line 7. That prechers
must not be afraid to rebuke the proudest, yea kings and Queens, so far forth
as the two tables of the law do reach. As we see in Samuel, Nathan, Elias,
John Baptist, and many other. They may not stoop to every man's beck, and
study to please man more then God. Thus far are your words / and they are as
far from your practice / as you are from the imitation of these godly examples
which you have brought. I see a bishoppricke has cooled your courage / for in
those days that you wrote this book / you would have our parliament to over
rule her majesty / and not to yield an inche unto her of their prileadges.
Your words I will set down.

Page 53. line 19
In like manner (say you / page 53.) if the parliament use their privileges
the king can ordain nothing without them: The parliament resisted King Henry
the 8.
if he do, it is his falt in usurping it, and their folly in permitting it:
wherefore in my judgment, those that in king Henry the 8. days, would not
grant him that his proclamations should have the force of a statute, wear
good fathers of their country and worthy of commendation in defending there
liberty, etc

I assure you brother John / you have spoken many things worthy the noting /
and I would our parliament men would mark this action done in King Henry the
8. days / and follow it in bringinge in reformation / and putting down lord
Bishops / with all other points of superstition: they may in your judgment not
only do any thing against their Kings or Queens mind / that is behoofull to
the honor of god / and the good of the commonwealth / but even withstand the
procedings of their sovereign.

But me thinks you have a palpable error / in the 48.49 and 50. page of your
book / which is that women are incapable of the ministry / not in regard of
their sex Women capable of the ministry in regard of their sex by the bishop
of Londons judgment.
/ but of certain wants and imperfections in their sex / vz. their want of
learning and courage / so that if a woman should be brought up in learning / and
trained in disputations / and were not milder in nature then men (of al which
wants in women / you speak page 48) but knew their quarter stroke (which
knowledge you require in the minister page 49) then by your reason they might
prech in your di^ces: whosoever will read your 50. and 51. pages / shall find
this to be your judgment.

Besides all this / the reader shall find such earthly and carnal stuff in all
these pages / that you must needs give this judgment of the whole book / surely
flesh / even a lump of mere flesh writ it. For there you shall see the
English man prefered before other people: only because he feeds upon (and
has in his possession plenty of sheep / Oxen / kie calves (I keep John
Elmars words) Con^es / fish / and where as other nations feed upon roots /
raw herbs / oil / grapes / etc. Page. 110. and 111. Yea we have such
plenty of calves in England that we have calves to our Bishopes.
In the last place against the French King he raileth and outrageth in this
wife. That Turkish valesius, that French tyrant. Is he a king or a devil, a
christian or a Lucifer, that by his cursed confederacy with the turk. Page.
112. line 27.
Page 113. line 4. O wicked ca^tife and fyrebrand of hell, And line 8. O
foolish Germans, which conspire not together with the rest of christian
princes, to pull out such a traitor to God and his kingdom, by the ears out
of France, and hang him against the Sun a drying.

The discreet reader of that which has been spoken / may apparently see the
indiscreet briutishnes that was in you / even then / when you were best worthy
to be accounted off. And thereby may gather what you are now / when you have
bidden farewell / not only unto the synceritie of religion / which then you
seemed to embrace / but even unto all humanity and civil behavior. And yet
you do not thus leave the French king / but in this page. 113. line 13. You
say that the devil has none of his side now / but him to maintain both the
spiritual and the temporal Antichrist: in the same page / Wherefore seeing he
has forsaken God, like an Apostata, and sold himself to the devil, etc. And
line 27.28. Proud Holophernes. Oh blessed is that man that loses his life
against such a Termagaunt. Again page 114. line 2. but this Iulia the
Apostata, is named a devils name, Christianissimus. Line 3. And like a
traiterous Sarazen is Christ's enemie^ Here he leaves the French king / and
here I leave his book.

Now I entreat the reader to consider these things / that I have set down
out of his book / and judge whether such things as he wrote could proceed
from a religious heart: and whether the book be not an offspring proceeding
from a lump of earthly flesh. This book is almost all the tokens of
Christianity / that ever he showed. Since the time he became bishop / he has
been a continual oppressor of the Church of God. His practices against God
and his saints / was the only cause why I have taken this pains with his
book / and he shall be more beholding unto me / unless he leave his tyranny.

But now alas / alas brother Bridges / I had forgotten you all this while / my
brother London and I were so busy / that we scarce thought of you. Why could
not you put me in mind that you staid all the while. But it is no matter / we
will make the quicker dispatche of our business. You shall see I will be the
more favorable to you. And let me see how roundly you ouerturne these puritans
/ for you are now to overthrow the several parts of their discipline. Our
brethren say / that our Savior Christ ordained an holy ministery^ of men / for
the buylding of his Church / and prove the saying by the place of Paul Ephe.
4.11.12. Your mastership 3. manner of ways show the place they allege / to
make nothing for their purpose. First say you / Paul speaks of diverse
functions / therefore nothing of Ecclesiastical government. This reason
brethren is a very sound one / if you should deny it / then in deed / I must
think you not to be altogether so leaddenheaded as your brother Bridges. For
do you think that a man entreating of the Mayor of London / the two Shiriffs
and their offices / speaks by and by of some part of the order and government
of the city of London? or of some of the governors of the city. As though my
L. Mayor and the two Shiriffes were now become to be any of the governors of
the city of London / or their offices any part of that government. Who sees
not by this example / the folly of our precise brethrens reason evidently
declared. The Apostle (say they) speaks of Apostles / prophets / Evangelists /
pastors / doctors / and their functions (for this M.D. confesses) therefore he
speaks of some ecclesiastical governors / and of some part of
ecclesiastical government. Apostles / prophets / pastors and doctors / are
church governors with them / and their office a part of ecclesiastical
government. Let them learn / let them learn simple siginnes as they are / that
the Apostle speaks in this place / of ecclesiastical functions / and not of
any part of ecclesiastical government. For so M.D. in this 61. page compare line
17. with line 22. teaches us to speak English: making an ecclesiastical
function / to be a thing altogether differing in nature / from every part of
ecclesiastical government. A very proper and pleasant distinction.

In the second place / this testimony brought in by our brethren / is proved
to make nothing to their purpose / by two reasons. You see that cousenadge is
likelye within a while to be the steward of my brother Lichefields house.
And what bommination vmbertie of reasons here be / to perceede forth one head
/ and yet every one fause / as it is true / that my good brother Ouerton / the
B. of Liechfield and Couentree / sold his Chauncellorship at one time / unto
two se^erall men: to wit / to D. Beacon / and the good Chauncellor / M.
Zachary Babington. Well parson Bridges his 1. reason is after this sort. That
place which shows gifts and functions to be ordained in the Church / to the
buylding up of the body of Christ / in the unity of the faith and knowledge:
makes nothing to prove that there is an ecclesiastical government prescribed
in the word. Thou say even true parson John. For what has the functions of
pastors / doctors / Apostles / etc. to do with Church government. A pretty
matter / every beggarly Apostle / pastor / doctor / or Evangelist / yt cannot
spend / no I am sure no^ 40. marks yearly / by all the spiritual living he
has in his hand: must now be a Church governor with our brethren / and
their offices be a part of Church government. Why brethren / what mean you by
this place you have brought? O^ you think / that the Apostle by those
functions / and those persons / spoken of / Ephesians. 4.12. means that any of
them functions should be a Lordlike functiou / or any of the persons Lord. You
say he does not. No does not? Then out of your own grant he speaks nothing
of ecclesiastical government and governors. Because every ecclesiastical
governor must needs be a Lord / and so ecclesiastical government / a lordly
government. If this be not true / ask my brother Bridges. For should God
ordain great men / and great Lords to be rulers in common wealths / over whom
he has not so great care as he has for his Church / and ordain none but
beggarly fellows (not able to spend 200. marks by the year / nay nor 20.
neither) to bear rule in his Church?

I grant in deed / that you brethren puritans / say the truth as it ought to
be / that bishops or ministers ought not to be Lords in any wise / either as
ministers / or as civil magistrates. Thus in deed it ought to be / I and my
brethren the Bb. do grant unto you. And you know we would it were so. But you
know also that our laws will have Church governors to be Lords / and what?
should our Bishops (good noble men) refuse that which the law would have them
to take? Get you the law to be against their lordly callings / and see whether
they will not give over their Lord bishopdomes / whenever law compels
them. And whenever they give over / they shall have no cause to thank such
envious brethren as you are. Howsoever it be / you see the Apostle / speaking
of all sorts of ministers / by your own confession: speaks nothing of any
Lord / or Lordly government among them all / and therefore speaks nothing of
Church government. Again / all those functions whereof the Apostle makes any
mention / (as my brother Bridges has well noted) are ordained to the buylding
of the body of Christ / in the unity of faith and knowledge. Now I would
any puritan of you all / durst say that our Church governors: that is / our
venerable and worshipful Lord bishops / are ordained of God / for the building
of his body / which I know you will say to be done by preaching? As though ^.
bishops / being civil governors should preach. Were it meet (I pray you) to
see Steven Gardener / being the^ of the privy Counsel in the pulpit?
Counselors now / must have ^omething to do with pulpit matters / must they
I pray you? Will you allow that civil governors should be ordinary preachers
in your new platform of a reformed Church? I know you will not. And what
reason is it then / that you should require Bb. to be ordinary preachers /
seeing every bishop is a civil governor. I tell you true / I am so far from
thinking / that bishops ought to be ordinary preachers / seeing they are
civil governors / that I hold it a sin for them to preach ordinarily. And
brethren / you do not well therefore / in urging civil governors to preach /
especially seeing you your selves / in your platformes / are against this point.
And because it shall be seen that I deal uprightly between you and the P.P.
prelates. I will set down my reason / and answer it when you can: it shall be
concluded I warrant you in mood and figure. But in deed I have invented a new
mood of mine own (for I have bin a great schooleman in my days) which
contains in it a great mystery. The mystery I will expound / it may be in a
book for the purpose. In the mean time / if you resort to my son Martin
senyor / that worthy wight / he it may be / shall be able to unfold the secrecy
thereof. This is the syllogism / the mood answers unto Celarent, elder
daughter to Barbara, and I will have it called / Perncanterburikenolde.

Perne No civil magistrate can be an ordinarye preacher without sin. Ce la
rent Canterbury Every Lord Bishop is a civil magistrate. Therefore Ce la
rent Kenolde No Lord Bishop can be an ordinary preacher without sin. Ce la
rent

What say you now brethren / would you have civil governors (such as our
Bishops are) to preach? I hope not. For although I cannot deny / but some of our
bishops are very great breakepulpits / and have as marvelous raw gifts in
preaching / as any that ever came to Paul's wharff / yet surely I cannot see
what warrant you have to urge civil officers to preach. Wherefore also you do
not well / in crying out against civil governors / because they preach not / as
though their function were an ecclesiastical function / or as though you would
have any to preach who had not an ecclesiastical function. If you demand then
/ whether bishops be Ecclesiastical or civil governors. They themselves say
beath / and ai say brethren / that for the stopping of your meathes and other
causes / I wad counsel the^ / if they wad be ruled bai me / to be nether
another. Now if yaw demand again / whether Bishops sin in being ministers /
seeing they are civil officers / or in bearing civil offices / seeing they are
ministers. I have already showed that civil officers must be no ministers. And
my brother London has long since affirmed it to be dangerous for the common
wealth / that ministers should be civil governors: and therefore brethren / to
answer this question of yours / you are to know that I am fully of your brother
Londons mind / who says page 24. line 19. of his Harborough. These 2. offices,
I mean the ecclesiastical and civil, be so iumbled together, as it may be
lawful for both parties to meddle in both functions, there can be no quiet, nor
any well ordered common wealth. Now brethren you must not think the worse of
this learned man's judgment / because he is a Bishop him self, For even since he
has joined these 2. offices together he has proved his own saying to be true
for his part / in that his whole endeavor has been ever since he was Bishop /
that we should have no quiet nor any well ordered church or common wealth. I
hope by this time you see it plain that Bishops sin / both because they are
civil governors / and being civil governors / because they are bishops.

Your 2. reason is / page.61. line 39. Paul speaks of these gifts and of
this building, and of the orders and ends thereof: therefore he speaks
nothing of ecclesiastical government. This is put home I trow / and
overthrows the puritans out of all cesse. It is altogether as good a reason /
as an old man yielded sometimes to sir Thomas More / concerning the cause of
Goodwine sands / and the stopping of Sandwich haven: which was / y^ Tentertons
steeple was the cause of Goodwine sands. M.D. 2. reason to show that the place
of Paul makes nothing for ecclesiastical government / is after this sort. Paul
in rekoning up these gifts, refers all to the unity in doctrine of faith,
and to the holy conversation of life. Ergo he makes no mention of
Ecclesiastical order of government.

That were a pitiful hearing in deed sir / that the Apostle should speak of
ecclesiastical government / and speak not a word of any lordlike government:
that the Apostle should make any mention of ecclesiastical governors / and
not name a Lord among them all. Fie / fie / this were too bad / and my Lord of
Canterbury would never abide such scripture.

But in good sadness (says the puritans) presbyter John Bridges / will this
place of Paul prove no part of this government which you oppugn? will it not
prove that God has ordained pastors / and doctors / to continue in his Church
unto the worlds end? No forsooth will it not quoth the Deane. And I am so far
from thinking that God has ordained your preaching pastors / and doctors / to
continue always in his Church / that I have made a prayer / page 655. line 28.
of my book (as my brother Martin you know has noted already) that we might
never see that day in England, In the Epistle ^o the terrible Priests.
wherein preaching might be had in all places. His grace of Canterbury (I tell
you) has condemned the preaching of the word (as being the only ordinary
means to salvation) to be an heresy. This scripture of Paul / that God has
appointed preaching pastors / to continue in his Church unto the worlds end /
is a chief ground of the former heresy. I will allow of no such scripture I
trow / as may impech the opinion which my ^. of Canterb. conceived of the
preaching of the word.

You see therefore my friends / that M. Deane in this point / will have
nothing to do with you / or Paul's testimony. And you are not ignorant I am
sure / how soon all lords would be out of the ministry / if we had none in
England / but the pastors spoken of by Paul / and therefore M. doctor has
prayed against this order. Yea / and he has brought such a reason against this
your platform of government / as is just Secundum vsum Sarum. For in deed it is
popish / and therefore you might smell it a far off. If the Lord (says he
page 62.) had thought this government needful for his Church, then he would
not have suffered his Church to be without the same. But he suffered his
Church of a long time to be without this government. Ergo he thought it not
needful.

Ah craft / craft / craft and subtlety / that can in jest deceive his brethren
with a popish reason in this sort. But my masters / you must not think that
our brother Sarum brings this in good earnest / but only to try whether you
be so simple / as you cannot know a popish reason when you see it. And to this
purpose / I think that both his worship / and John Whitgifts grace / have
brought in their writings / many things that are palpable popish / that they
might try / whether of knowledge / or of peevish and chollericke rashness / you
speak against their government. Now if so be that you could not discern their
popish reasons (whereof in deed you shall find great store / every third
reason I warraunt you / in all their books) then they would have this
advantage against you / that you were not able to know truth from popery.
For (might they say) we brought in papish resons of purpose, but si^lie fellows
/ their skill is so small in all kind of learning / that they cannot know a
popish reason / especially if we can face it out with a bragg / that we have
old and new writers of our side. Now brethren / you must not the^ / mislike
your brother Bridges purpose / in bringing in this popish syllogism. This I
speak / to the end you should not cry out (as some of you have done) that
our bishops have no better warraunt for themselves then the pope has / for
their government. I grant in deed / that if you should take M. deane at the
worst / you might say that he might herein / reason as well for the Mass / as
he does for the established gournement. As for example / he might thus argue.
If the Lord had thought the Mass to have been a false worship of him / then he
would not have suffered it so long to have continued / where any weak one
should be endangered / of being enforced to be present thereat. But he suffered
it to continue a long time / etc. Therefore he thought it not to be a false
worship. I say you must not mistake M. doctor in this sort / but know that he
dealt after the manner of the schools / wherein it is lawful (as Thomas
Cartwright who has been professor of divinity / both in Cambridge and in
Gene^a / knows well enough) for men to argue / pro and contra, as well with /
as against the truth: and all is to try out the truth / which is only the
sole meaning that M.D. has not at all thought off. But I pray you / let us
pass from hence / unto the 64. pa. where you shall find the calling of an
Archbishop most notably proved / out of our brethrens own words. Our
brethren (^a the cloister master of Sarum) affirm that Paul and Barnabas,
ordained presbyters, priests or elders (for thus M.D. to his neuerlasting fame
/ has full often in his book / translated the greek word presbyteros) at
Derbe, Iconium and Lystra. Ergo, some of these priests or elders, were
ordained over whole towns, some over regions. And what could be more aptly
spoken to the purpose / or more fitly prove an Archiepiscopall calling? But
truly I think brothe^ Bridges that Titus was neither Archbishop nor Deane of
Sarum.
But the reason following / proves it yet more evident / and that is the
ilsample of Archbishop Titus / whom the D. of diuillitie in this 65. page
affirms to have been Arch. of Creet. Nay good M.D / not many Archbishopps in
the person of Titus I pray you. Titus was an Evangelist / therefore no
Archbishop. Yea says he / Titus was a very Archbishopp / and there is plain
scripture to prove it / which is the subscription of the Epistle to Titus.
Whope papist / say the puritans / is that become scripture with you? Why M.
Beza has long since proved this to be no scripture / but an uncertain and
false guess / added by some Scholiast. The reason of Archbishop Titus is no
popish reason.
You know also that your brother Turrian the Jesuit / bringing in this for
Scripture / was soundly confuted by M. Sadel / and dare you Deane John / bring
this in for Scripture? Yes that I dare (says he) and prove Titus to have bin
an Archbishopp / even by this reason: because Paul gave him the authority to
be the ordinary of all the Bishopps in Creet. And this I prove / because
Creete / where my Lord Archbishop Titus his grace / was Primate and
Paltripolitane / had many famous cities in it. This is my very reason / page
65. line 21. and i will stand to it.

Now M. Fickers / parsons and currats / if ever I hard better proof in my life
/ I would all dumb dogs were whipped out of the Church. Now truly this is
sport alone. But brother parson Bridges / I pray you tell me / was there
canonical obedience sworn to Archbishopp Titus? What else man. Did they call
him my Lords grace to? Do you dout of it? Did his gentlman Ussher go bareheaded
before him? As though he could not be as popelike and pontifical / as my Lord
of Canterbury. But I hope a pore hedge priest might have his letters of orders
of him / though he would give no bribes unto his Secretorie / cook / butler /
etc. Might he so goodman noddie? Then how should his men I pray you be able to
live? As though bishops should give their men any wages? Their blessing I trow
will serve their men in steed of wages.

In page 66. M. doctor demands a question / and that is / whether one man
might not have diverse of these offices and gifts which were in the Apostles
time. In deed brother parson / we read of never an Apostle that was a
nonresident / but of one Judas / one Simon Magus / and one Diotrephes in all
that time. The reason belike was / that men wrought miracles in those days /
which gift the noble Lords of our clergy / have now bestowed upon their
horses. For in the Aposiles time / a horse usually carried not above one or two
men at the most: Or so many Simonical promotion^.
whereas you know / that Master D. Humffrie / and D. Matthew / had two horses
between them / that never carried under 14. men / whenever their masters were
on their backs. And our bishopps are so expert in adorning horses with those
miraculous gifts / that they are no sooner on their horse backs / then
presently the horse whereon they ride / is able to carry as many as either of
the 2. former / besides their boots? 2. or 3. pair of trulling square dice /
and so many pair of cards.

Parsou Bridges / page 68. says / there are more gifts and callings then 4.
pastors / doctors / elders and deacons remaining / because says he / page 69.
the gifts of doing miracles, prophecy, the gifts of healing, diverse among the
papists have and do enjoy, and especially, the gift of tongs, not attained unto
by study, had diverse of them, as Anthony, etc. Anthony among the papists /
had the gift of tongs without study: Now what a goodyeare was that Anthony?
The god of the pigs trow ye? In deed master D. quoteth no author for his
warraunt / he is redd you know in the Legend of lies. There is a book of this
name / which M. doctor made no they say.
There it is: what have the puritans to do where he found it? Let the^ answer
to it. What if he found it in Hodge his breechs / seeking for Gammer Gurtons
needle? Is the reason worse then the rest of his book / because it is without
authority.

As for the matter contained in the 70.71.72. pages / M. D. confirms it by
the authority of a puritan writer / which wrote (as he says) A fruitful
sermon upon the 1. Cor. 12. printed by Robert Walde-graue / 1584. A Sermon
upon the 1. Cor. 12. printed by Robert Walde-graue: say our brethren / why
there was never any sermon upon that tert / printed by Robert Walde-graue. M.
D. belike means the sermon upon Romans 12. Tush brethren what should you tell
us of M.D. meaning / he means the sermon upon 1. Cor. 12. If you do not
believe me / look the 255. page of his book / and there you shall see the
sermon upon 1. Cor. 12. twice cited. M.D. if he were more beetleheaded then he
is / could not possible miss so often in the naming of the sermon / upon Romans
12. which is so commonly known. It may be in deed / you never saw any sermon
extant upon that text: but I warraunt you Deane John knows the way to
Salisburie / so do not many thousands of you puritans. Why / you never saw
the Syriacke Testament translated by Iunius (for that which is abroad / was
done by Tremelius alone) but M.D. has quoted Iunius his Syriack Testament. Why
then may he not as well find a sermon upon 1. Cor 12. printed by Robert
Walde-graue / as a Syriacke Testament of Iunius his trauslation? Now say the
puritans what a notorious block is this deane / who inasmuch as he has heard
that M. Tremelius / and M. Iunius were joined together in the translation of
the Syble / thinks therefore that Iunius translated the Syriack Testament /
which was done by Tremelius only.

For shame my masters deal more charitably / and bear with the infirmities of
your brethren. I grant in deed it was M.D. oversight / in naming Iunius his
Syriacke Testament: and the sermon upon 1. Cor. 12. in stead of Romans 12. But
what then / should you therefore take him up for it / as though he were the
veriest ass in a country. Learned men may easily commit such ouersights /
especially quoting authors upon other men's reports / as M. D. has done. But
it is no marvel that you deal thus with M. deane / when you dare abuse
Antichrist / and say as the author of the Learned Discourse has done / that
this government of yours continued in the Church until Antichrist brought in
all kind of false doctrine and confusion. For Antichrist / and against the
government of Christ.
Nay who there masters mine / quoth M. deane / for these be his own words /
take my reason with you / you slander Antichrist. For

If your government had continued in the Church until all kind of false
doctrine came in, This is the D. reason in very deed.
it had been exercised without interruption until this day (especially until
the year 1587. wherein you made this book) For I doubt me whether all kind
of false doctrine has been yet sown. But your government has been
interrupted long since. Therefore you slander Antichriste.

They slander him in deed / John O Sarum / if they say that he brought in all
kind of false doctrine. And you have never proved proposition better in your
life / then you have proved this. For any man that will read your book / or
John Whit gifts / will say that Antichrist brought not in all kind of false
doctrine / if he had / your book I am sure / had not been sold for 7.
shillings as it is. In the 78. page / M. D. shows that the office of
Archbishops / and Lord bishops / are in nature pastoral / though in dignity
they are of another office and ministry. And what say you to that brethren?
Even this say they. In dignity they are popes / in office proud prelates / and
in ministry / plain dumb dogs for the most part. This is proved / has been
proved / and will be proved / to the proudest of the Bishops teeth / if they
do dispute with us in these points. I would wish you / my puritan masters / to
keep you well while you are well. It may be you shall answer this saucines of
yours / to offer disputation to my lords grace / before the high commissionrs.
Master D. has confuted all the pack of you. In the 82. page / by a tale or 2.
of a Fox tail / and another of the Ass / laden with spunges / page 83. From
the 90. page / to the end of the book / he goes so readely to work about the
office of the civil magistrate / that I marvel that men will not say / that he
deserves to be cased in a good moatley clockbagg for his labor. In the 93.
page / he proves that no man ought to direct the magistrate in any thing.
Simply I Will be sworn thou ghost simply to work
For says he / brethren I go plainly / and simply to work / he that
directs he governs. Alas the day brother (cloister master) do the puritans
say in deed / that the magistrate should be directed by any within his own
dominions. Belike then if they should find a magistrate out of his way / they
would go about to direct him / would they? And that in his own dominions to?
Why brother Bridges can this stand with the duty of a good subject? Why? He
that directs he governs. I perceive it is time that such fellows wear
looked unto. We should never have done with them I perceive / if we should
still stand answering their absurd fancies. By this time I hope / they see
their folly. They have been sufficiently confuted / or else let Andrewe ambo
judge between you / he is an indifferent man. Docter Porn^
From the 99. page unto the 130. just 31. pages / at which game O the cards /
D. Redman Archdecon of Canterbury is very good / besides his rare skill in
iuglinge / and to the end of this book / they agree with you in any thing /
that lawfully belongs to the office of the civil magistrate.

How say you now M. cuntry Parsons and Fickers. Are you not by this time able
to withstand the cauells of the puritanes. Do you not see upon what good
ground our Church government and my I. of Canterburies chaier is bullt? I
would you did else. And let the learned reader judge whether other men cannot
play the ignorant sots as well as you brother Bridges. Tush / Tushe / I would
not have you claim all the skill / in Barbarismes and Solecismes unto your
self. Other men can behave them selves with commendations that way as well as
you / though in deed not so naturally I grant. Farewell sweet Doctor / and
make much of the courtier Martin.

Errata, or faults escaped.
1 Whersoeuer the prelates are called my Lords / either in the epistle to the
confocatiou house / or in this Epitome / take that for a fault. Because they
are none of M. Martins Lords / neither shall any priest of them all be my Lord.
For I tell thee true / I think foul scorn they should be my Lords / or the
Lords of any of my sons.

2 There is nothing spoken at all / of that notable hypocrite Scambler / Bishop
of Norwich. Take it for a great fault / but unless he leave his close dealing
against the truth / i will bestow a whole book of him. And let the rest of you
hypocrites take heed of persecuting.

3 But the greatest fault of all is / that I could say against our ungodly
priests / but unless they mend / ise fully amend this fault / and I can do
it with a small warninge. And I would devise them not to persecute men for my
worshipes book as they do.
