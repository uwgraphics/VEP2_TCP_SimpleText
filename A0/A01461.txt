The Preface of the tra^slatour to ye gentil reader.
I Have heretofore / with no small admiracion / readde a certain Sermon / made
in Englshe / before our late sovereign lord King Henry theight / about
xiiij. years past by doctor Tonstall than bishop of Dures To^stal
me / and set fnrthe in Printe / by like for his ow ne glory or rather
purgacion / being suspected (and not without cause) to be a favourer of ye
pretensed authority and antichristian power of the Bishop of Rome (whereof he is
bent at this day with other his accomplices to show him sell fe / that Sermon
notwtstonding / not only to be a frendely favourer / but an open diligent proc
tour) and a certain oracion also written in Lati ne by doctor Samson than
bishop of Chiches tree / and now the doublefaced epicureous biteshepe Sa^son
of Couentrye and Lichefelde as well for ye proof and assercion of the Kings
supremacy by the undoubted truth of Gods vufaili^g worcester de / as of the just
abrogacion of the said bishop of Romes feyned power out of England.

By which Sermon and oracion / I bei^ge indif ferently instructed in the truth
for those days / in some points / can not chose but marvel somewhat / at this
their so sudden alteracion of mind and procedi^ges presently seen to al
me^nes understanding. Howbeit forasmuch as To^stall has been long reputed a
still dreamy^g Saturn always ymagyning myschief / and Sam son an idle bellied
carnal epicure / which for worldly honor and paltri^g pelfes sake / has
ever holden with the hare / and run with the hounde / as they say: and if he
were bidde^ / (...) (...).
de say / Christ were an hangma^ / and his father a thief. I compted not much
upon them / nor thought / that their Sermon and oracion proceeded of any
persuasion of conscience / but to serve the time / as the common practice of
that foxie generation is.

But now of late / I chanced to read an excel lent and a right notable
Oracione entitled De vera obedientia, made in Latinc about xx. (...).
years past / by D. Stephan Gardener than bishop of winchestre / now lord
Chancellor and common Cuttethrote of England / touchi^g as well the Kings
supremacy and absolute power (under God) of the church of England / and the
necessary divorce (as he calls it) of the said King Henry theight / from
the Queen's mother that now is / together with the laufull and chaste marriage
(for so he terms yt matter) had between the said King and Queen Anne / Quen
Anne.
to consiste by the vnfailing almighty word of God: as also concerning the
false feyned auto ritie and usurped power of the bishop of Rome and unlawful
or vnadvysed oaths and vows: joined with the Preface of doughtie doctor
Bonner / than archediacon of Leicestre / gapin Bonne
ge to be a bishop / as he is now (by the way of usurpation) of London / for
the commendacio^ and praise of the same Oracion.

And forasmuch as Winchestre confesses in the same / his long advised
deliberacio^ / before he was persuaded (by the truth) of the Kings
supremacy: and seeing he was the cheaf procurer and labourer / at that time /
of the Kings said divorce / and second marriage: and now Divorc
even he with his blowebolle bocherly brother Bonner / turning like

but also (like sedicious and most antichristian angels of Satan) to set up
their father Antichrist Satha^s:
of Rome in this realm again: I have thougt it good / to turn the same
Oracion and Preface in to our vulgar tongue / that every true English
subject may plainly behold / by these men's fruits / what they them selves
are: dissemblers with Princes / to whom they owe their bounden allegeau^ce.
deceavers of Gods people the Queen's subjects / for whom Christ has sheadde

Now to geve ye certain notes / to behold that stowte champion winchestres
double perjury and traitorous villainy the better by: thou shall mark in
readi^g this oration / that he affirmed at those days / that the bishop of
Romes authority in England / was against Gods wordeand now he iuggleth to
bring it in again.

Than he said / ye king was ye supreme headde of the church of England next
under Christenow he gothe about to impeche the crown of that supremacy. Than
he avouched / that the king might not put away yt supremacy from him /
because it is given him of God: now his policy is / to deceave the Queen's
highness there A seducer.

Than he affirmed that all true subjects were dettebounden to defend /
maintene and uphold / the supreme authority of the crown: now he would have
al English subjects to be foreswor ne to the crown / and help in his father
of Rome again. Than he said / that men's traditions were for the most part
repugnau^t to Gods word: now he prefers such false popish tra (...) ons.
ditiones / garnishinge them with the name of ye church / as thoughfolkes were
bounden to cre dite and obey them / as much or more than the bible. Than he
prated / that in the only scriptu res was the truth to be sought for: now the
scriptures must be cast out of the doors / as though they were the chief
teachers of untrue the. Than he confessed that the true light was hidden / as
long as the bishop of Rome have to do here: now he and his fellow shaveli^ges
say / and caused Dudley the wicked Duke to Dudley
declare by his learning and conscience / that the truth has not ben opened
/ and that England has be^ divided from the catholic faith and church /
sithence that power was abolished.

Than he affirmed / that the marriage of King Henry theight with the Queen's
mother / was unlawful / and therefore justly divorced / as of no^ effect: now
he says that ye same marriage was Mariaage.
lauful by Gods word. Than he affirmed / that the marriage of the said King
with Queen Anne / was a chaste and a lauful marriage by Gods word: now his
deeds declare his judgment to be contrary. Than he confessed that the said
divorce and second marriage were done by the undoubted word of God / the
censures of the most famous universities of the world / the iud gement of the
church of England / and by act of perliament / whereof he him self was the
pro Parliament.
curour in the universities / and in all points a principal doer: now he
lays all the fault to the Archbishop of Cantorburie / as though it had been
tharchbishoppes only deed. Than he wrote advisedly of a conscience / and to be
highly regarded with the King: now he is not ashamed to say nay and recante
/ to please and rule the Queen. Than he brake the Queen's headde / in procuring
and affirming her to be illegittimate: now he geveth her a plastre / with his
recanting and saying she is legittimate.

Than he took him leisure / a fore he would be persuaded: now he runs post
haste in to a contrary Dissuasion. From that time hitherto / he confesses he
has done wrong in these cases / scilicet / that he has been a traitor above
these xx. years / and now he would be taken for a true man / repe^ting scarce
xx. days / A traitor.
and that more for fear and ambicious flattery / than for truth or
conscience.

These tricks and many such like thou may easily epsy in this Oration and
Preface / good rader / whereby thou may beware of these in carnate Devilles /

these worthy pillars of the malignaunt madame / the Babylonicall holy mother

Edmonde Bonner Archedeacon of Leicestre / the King of England his most
excellent Majesty's Ambassador in Denmark / To the sincere / gentill hearted
and godly reader.
For as much as there be some (doubtless) even at this present / as it has
always ben the wont of men's judge mentes to be variable and diverse / which
thike / the controversy / that is betweue the King (...).
of England and of France his most Royal Majesty / and the Bishop of Rome /
consists in this poi^t / because the Kings said Majesty has taken the
most excellent and most noble Lady Anne, to his wife: where as in very deed not

the intent all / that truly and hertily favor the Gospel of Gospel.

and to the profit and commodity of all christian people) and that hate not /

leinght / as mete it is they should) may the more fully vndrestande the
chief point of yt co^ trouersie / and because they shall not be ignorant /
what the hole voice and resolute determination of the best and greatest learned
bishopes / with all the nobles and commo^s of England / is not only in that
cause of matrimony / but also in ye defendinge of the Gospelles doctrine: this
ora cion of the bishop of Winchestre (a man excel Wiche: stre.
lently learned in all ki^de of learning) entitled De vera obedientia, that is
/ concerning true obedience / which he made lately in England / shall be
published: but as touchi^g this bishops worthy praises / there shall be nothing
spoken of me at this time / not only because they are infini te / but be cause
they are far better known to all Christendom / than becomes me here to
make rehearsal. And as for the oration Oracy
it selse which as it is most learned / so is it most elegant / to what purpose
should I make any words of it / sei^ge it praises it self enough / and
sense good wine needs no tavern busshe / to vttre it. But yet in this oration
who so ever thou art most gentill read: thou shalt / beside other matters /
see it notably and learnedly handled / of what importance and how invincible
the power and excellency of Gods truth is: which as it may now and than be
pressed of enemies / so it can not possibly be oppressed after such sort /
but it comes again at leynght behind the scriene / more glorious and more
welcome. Thou shall see also / touching obedience / that it is subject to
truth / and what is to be judged true obedience. Besides this / of men's
tradicions / which for the most part are utterly repugnaunt against the truth
of Gods law. And there by the way / he speaks of the kings said
highnesses marriage / which / by the ripe judgment antoritie and privilege of
the most and principal universities of the world / and than with the consent
of the hole church of England / he contracted with the most clear and most
noble Lady / Queen Anne.

After that touching the Kings Majesty's title / as perteynyng to the supreme
headde of the church of England.

Lastly of all / of the false pretensed supremacy of the Bishop of Rome / in
the realm of England / most justly abrogated: and how all other bishops /
being fellow like to him in their function / yea and in some points above him
within their own Provinces / were before time bound to him by their oath. But
be thou most surely persuaded of this / good reader / that ye bishop of Rome /
though there were no cause else but this marriage / will easyly content him
self specially when there is one morsel or (...) laid to him to (...). But
when he sees so mighty a king / being a right virtuous and a great learned
Prince / so sincerely and so heartily favor the Gospel of Christ / and
perceaveath the yearly ravenous pray (yea so large a pray / that it came to
as much all most as all the kings revenues) snapped out of his hands / and
that he could no longer exercise his tyranny in the Kings Majesty's re alme
(alas it has been to cruel and bitter all this while) nor make laws / as he
has done many / to the contumely and reproach of the Majesty of God / which
is evident that he has done in times past / under the title of the ca tholike
church / and the authority of ye apostles Pe tree and Panle (when notwtsto^ding
he was a very raveni^g wolf dressed in shepes clothi^g / calli^g hi^ self
servant of servants) to ye great da^ma ge of the christen common wealth: A
man may say / there bego^ne ye myschief: there of rose these discordes / these
deadly malices / and so great trou blous bustling. For if it were not thus / no
man could beleve / that this Jupiter of (...)
Olympus / which has falsely taken upon him power wherein is more brag than
hurt / would have done his best / yt this good / and godly / and right
gospellike Prince should be falsely betrayed to all the rest of Mouarches and
Princes. Nether let it move the / gentle reader / that the bishop of
winchestre / did not a fore now apply to this opinion / for he him self in
this oration shows the cause / why he did (...)
it not. And if he had said never a word / yet thou know well / what a
wittye part it is / for a man to suspende his judgment / and not be to rash
in geving of sentence.

It is an old said saw: Marie Magdalene profited us less in her quycke
belefe that Christ was risen / than Thomas that was longer in doubt. A man may
rightly call him Fabius / that with his advysed taking of leisure / restored
the matter. Albeit I speak not this as though Winchestre had not boulted out
this ca se secretly with him self before hand (for he (...).
boulted it even to the branne long a goo / out of doubt) but that ru^nyng
fair and softly / he would furst with his paynefull study / pluck the matter
out of the dark / although of it self it was sound enough / but by reason of
sundry opiniones / it was lapped up and made dark / and than did he debate it
wittyly to and fro / and so at last (after long and great deliberatiou had in
the matter) because there is no better cou^sailour Counsel lour.
than leisure and time / he would resolutely with his learned and consummate
judgment confirm it. Thou should / gentill reader / esteem his censure and
authority to be of the more weightye crede^ce / in as much as the matter was
not rashely / and at all adve^tures / but with judgment (as thou see) and
with wisdom examined and discussed. And this is no new example / to be
against the bishop of Rome / sei^g that not only this man / but many men many
ty mes / yea and right great learned men / before now have done the same / even
iu writings / wherein they both painted him out in his colors / and made his
sleightes / falsehead / frauds / and deceiptfull wyles / openly known to the
world. Therefore if thou at any time heretofore have doubted either of true
obedience / or of ye kings majesty's marriage / or title / either else of ye
B. Marya ge.
of Romes false pretensed supremacy / as if tho (...) a good smelling nose /
and a sound judge meant / I think thon did not / yet having (...) over
this oracio^ (which if thou favor the truth / and hate the tyranny of the
bishop of Rome and his develishe fraudulent falsehead shall doubtless
wondrefully content the) throw down thine error / and acknowlage the truth
now freely offered the at leynght / considring with thy self / that it is better
late to do so / than never to repent. Fare thou heartily well / most gentill
reader / and not only love this most valaunt King of England and of France /
who undoubtedly was by the providence of God / borne to defend the Gospel /
but also honor him / and serve him most obediently: As for this wi^chestre /
who was long agoo without doubt reputed among the greatest learned me^ / geve
him thy good word with honorable co^mendacions.

it were long of me^ or of times) have been of long season co^fu sely io^bled

And I doubt not / but many both learned / gra ve / and right good men were in

furthe and defendour of the law and of the lettre / as I may so say and where
I could do nothing with a worse will nor more against my mind / than to
shrin ke from any thing that I had been before persuaded in / what so ever it
were: the further that my Judgment swarved from the truth in that behalf /
so muchc the more vehementlye and eagrelie me thought I was astonished / wha^ I
knew ye truth: even as a man's eyes being dulled with darkness / are wo^t to
be amassed at sudden brightenes / wha^ ye light breaks out. For I had not the

will thou have me to do? For that chosen vessel had so much pleyntye of the
grace of God / that he co^ fessed by and by / it was the voice of God / that
checked him / and called him from his error / and so committed him self
hoolly to the governaunce of God / and obeyde him in all truth / and did after
him in all points without any more adoo. But as for me (albeyt my Judgment
has been always / that the true the ought to be obeyde / which doubtless does
come all together of God) yet in the discussing and trial of the truth / I
did not so easily content my self. But I so framed my self / yt / as it

the intent I might submyt and captiuate the wit of my understanding to the
truth / as though I had thoroughly perceaved and known it.

This my leisure taking / which some perchau^ ce reckon for a to much
obstinate rebelling / my my^dc is not to ascribe unto mine own wisdom or
gravity / lest any man would think / I were feign (as they say) to praise my
self / for lack of good neighbors: But I do most co^stauntly affirm and

So that mine intent is not / persently to re^dre the cause of my slackenes /
or to claim that ad vised leisure taking / as a propre inward gift of mine
own / which were not only a token of folishnes with me^ / but also a very
wyckednes toward God: but I would rather yield acco^ pte to the world / what
it was / that changed mine opinion so much / and what caused me now at leyngh
/ to dissent from my self / and from mine own former words and deeds.

And in deed (to tell you at a word) that compelled me / that compelled all
men / when God sees his time / even the mighty power of the truth / whereunto
all things at leyngh Truth compelled winchestre to forsake his fayer of To.
nay forsothe a fat bisshoprick but yet he loved hi never ye worse in his
heart:
obey and do there after.

Nou I desire and heartily pray the / gentill rea der / to bear friendly with
me / in speaking of true obedience / and such things / as for thy sake / the
rules either of Rhetorike or Logike / require of a writer yt is / yt I should
/ at ye beginning / give the occasion either to be lovingly bent / or fytte to
be instruct / or else to be atte^tyve / wc as yet I have nothing done / yet
geve the^ to me again / as if thou had received the^ / and forgeve me the^
/ as though thou were perfitly paid of them in deed.

For saying I perceave that I have obeyed truly / in acknowlageinge the truth
/ I can not chose / but set furthe somthinge openly / touching true obedience /
and though I am not hable to speak of it / according to the worthy nes of the
thing / yet mine endeavor shall be to speak it openly / and open it plainly.

And to come spedely to my purpose: I think / that to obey truly / is nothing
else / but to obey unto the truth.

And God is yt truth (as scripture records) Truth to be sought only in
scriptures.
where in he geveth his chief light unto us / so much / that who so ever
seeks it in any other place / and goth about to fette it out of men's puddles
and quallmyres / and not out of the most pure and clear fountain it self /
they draw and bring up now and than / I wot not what / foul and myrye gear
/ vneffectual and to no purpose / for the quenching of men's thirsty desires
/ which perteigneth all together proprely unto the truth it self. For it is
only he / that geveth us the holsom water of the truth / whereof / he that
drinks / in obeyeng the faith which Jesus Christ has published / he shall
also bring furthe the fruit of true obedience / so that he shall never be
thirstye.

For albeit God in the old law / when he had determined in slain sacrifices
and offringes / to shaddowe and signify / his own sincere and pure service
and honor (which the true wurshippers should do now in spirit and truth)
and for that cause gave strait commandment / yt those slain sacrifices and
oblaciones should be had in high honor and devocio^ / to show / how much
more dearly he esteemed obedience / he has manifestly declared in many places
of the scriptures / yt he sets more by obedience / than by all oblaciones
and sacrifices. For so spea f. (...) xv.
keth Samuel out of the spirit of God / unto Saul: Would the Lord have
offrynges and sacrifices (says he) and not rather that the Lords word
should be obeyed? Obedience is better, than burnt offrynges, and to take
head, is more, than to offer the fat oframmes. Moses also in Deuteronomio,
Deu. xj
commending obedience unto the people / says: Lo (says Moses) I set before
your faces this day, blessinge and cursinge. Blessinge, if ye obey unto the
command mentes of the Lord your God, which I co^ maunde this day: and
cnrsinge, if ye do Rom j.
not obey. Of this true obedience Saint Faith requires obe dience.
Paul makes mention / in these words writi^g to the Romans / where he
says / he received grace and apostleship / that faith might be obeyde among
all people. etc. For faith requires Than a trne faith makes no reco ny^g of
his own worcester kes.
obedience / that is that we acknowlageinge the will of God in Christ / which
is the word of the father / and being made partakers of the grace of god / by
his merit / should also / through the same Christ our lord / both believe in
obeyeng / and obey in beleving.

And who so ever puts his perfect belefe and hope in God / looks for
reward at his only ha^ des / and without God compteth not upon his own works
/ and deeds / but poynteth them their limits / so that he renders them unto
God / as though they were done of God / from whom al good things proceed / and
acknowlageth God to be the only beginning and fynysshing of all goodness: that
man is doubtless he / that may be said / to obey truly / that is to say / in
following the truth / and for true these sake in contemnyng all things / that
this deceaveable world / is wont both to make show of / and to magnify.

And to the intent mankind should clearly and plainly / not only with ears /
but also with eyes / understand and see this truth of obedi ence / that is to
say / to the intent as many as are children / should be drawn / both
ontwardely / and inwardely / of the heavenly father / to atteyne that truth:
the word (Jesus Christ) proceeded from the father in to the virgin / and
taking upon him a very true and a mortal body / became flesh / and the very
same / both God and man dwelt among us / Joan. j.
showing his glory in sigues and power as the No man has seen God / at any
ty^
glory of the only begotten son of the father / and told us plainly of God /
whom no man has seen at any time / and went before / and showed us the true
ways of obedience / that like as by the disobedience of one man / many became
sinners / so by the obedience of one / many should be made righteous / and
that / death (wo^ the sin of disobedience brought in) being overcome / men
should truly lyve in deed / in Christ / by virtue of obedience.

For to beleve surely in God / and to cleave con stauntely unto him / which the
scripture calls a righteous man's life / is doubtless to obey him / and in
exercising obedience / to chasten the body / to bring the flesh in to
seruitute / to subdue the kingdom of sin / as much as lies in us: to
depend of God / to make our members servau^tes of righteousness / to set light
by our own commodity / and for Gods sake / to care for other men's / to
trust that God hi Matthew. xxij.
self will be our reward / and without God / or besides God / to compte
nothing pleasant (...). xx.
or delectable.

This is to love the Lord / with all our heart / which is a gelous God / that
can not away with any man / that serves every master / but he requires to
have the man all holle to him self / and not to be hewn in pieces / to serve
two diverse maistres commandments / but he will be only worshipped / and he
will be only served of them that be his. Gods secret will reveled in Christ.


This secret will of God / being (by his (...) cheable devise) hidden from the
beginning / is now in the end of the world / reveled unto us / by our Christ /
the (...) sacrifice and rau^som of mankind / who in appeaceing the most (...)
deserved wrath of God / has declared the holsom doctrine of obedience in his
deeds / and has suffered for us / leaving us an ensample / yt we should
follow his fotesteppes / we (...) we will considre / we shall plainly find /

practiceth the will (...) God / expressed to manky^de in the word / which is
Christ / and being stered up of god / (...) also the effect and end unto god
/ which (...) the gift / both to will and to work / according to his own
good will. Therefore when Chr stes mother troubled him / as he was teaching in

And in an other place / I am not sent, but unto Mat. (...)
the lost sheep of the house of Israel: showing thereby / yt nothing ought to be

When the hour of Christ's passion drew ne re / and when he had made that
form of prayer / that should be most co^venient for our wea ke frayltie / at
the peril of death / Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:
he added straightwayes (to declare the victory Matthew. (...).
of obedience / more plainly) Not as I will, but as thou will. Which his
fathers command ments / God the son obeyed to the uttermost in the mystery
of our redemption / to show us how we should obey / and because (as the
(...) saydesawe is) we should not spill the wine with pouring in water / and
lose all the fruit of obedience / he has also with his own most true and
most certain words / taught us in (...) other place (and performed the same
also in his deeds) that he sought not his own glo rye / through his obedience
/ but his fathers. I (says he) seek not mine own glory, but my fathers. If
I (says he) glorify my self Joan. (...).
my glory is nothing. And in an other place / he geveth us more plain warning
of this / say (...) / Let your light (says he) so shine before men, that they
may glorify your father, Mat. v.
which is in heaven. If we trust upon commendacion or vain glory at men's
hands / we lose our reward / and shall appear Take (...) of yt be time there

one day before the presence of almighty God / with empty vessels like the
folishe virgins / and shall suffer a most grevous repulse of the spouse at his

(...).
left hand matter is vugayne / and wicked what so ever proceeds of the
flesh. Do not therefore Mat. vj Defile not god des matters with ye deuyses of men.
defyle nor mar Gods matters with man's devises / but obey secretly from
the flesh / and God shall reward the in secret.

And hereunto I suppose it may be applied / that. S. Paul writteth / saying:
Not he that is a Jew openly, is a Jew: nether is the circuncision of the
flesh, that is done openly, circuncision, but he that is a Jew secretly, is a
right Jew, and the circuncision Kum. ij.
of the heart, is the circuncision, that consists in the spirit, and not in
the lettre, whose praise is not of men but of God.

Let the lord therefore be both our part / and the hole sum of our
enheritaunce / who Psalm. xvj.
only shall restore a sure enheritaunce unto us: that is to say / let us obey
God for (...) sake / which only is true obedience: which returns thider /
whence it came / and where it proceeded of truth / it gothe in to truth / and
is contained of all one beginning and endinge.

By this manner of order / it seems that Saint Paul set furthe the rule of
obedience / when Col. iij.
he badde servauntes / be obedient unto their maistres for Gods sake /
declaring plainly / that God is the author and rewarder of that just obedient
service / that servants do unto their bodily masters: so that what so ever
shall certainly appear to be done in his name / we may not doubt / but he
will accept and take it in good part. And according thereto / it appears to
be written in the Gospel:

Blesshed shall you be, when men hate you, and persecute you etc. For the son
of Mat. v.
man's sake, rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven. For
if we suffer (...) justly for our faults (as. S. Petre says) what gramercie
is it to us?

For yt is exhibited unto yt laws and not unto god / even as that is not
worthy of any reward at Gods hand / how godly so ever it seem in outward
appearau^ce / yt hunteth after any earthy matter / glory / or estimacio^ of man
/ with is yt ppretie of hypocrites / unto who^ ye saying of God is me^cioned:

either when we put the commandments of God in practyce in outward show
before me^ / or else for ambicious vain glory / or vaunta ge sake / whereof I
have spoken something already before. As for the final judgment of this matter
/ God has particularly reserved it unto him self / to be pronounced at the
day of his just judgment / most earnestly inhibiting us / that we pronounce
not rashely of any man's heart in that behalf / yea / thouh they do al
together as evil / as we have done in this kind of sin / as he has not

to talk of all things / or in that / that men are permitted to judge of /
when we cloak true obe dience with countrefait obedience / and neclecting that
/ that God commands we provide us other ware to keep us occupied withal /
turnyng the deaf ear to that most sore sentence of Gods truth: In vain
do you worship Mat. xv
me, in the commandments and doctrines of men, seeing you have broken my
praeceptes for your own tradicion.

And to the intent we do not so / we ought furst of all to take heed / that
we keep surely that mark / which is certai and is signed with the syngre of
God / whereby we may make a distinction between Gods causes and man's / that
they be not shuffled together. Furst of all therefore / reckon upon this for a
certayntie / that the talk of God / contained in the holy scriptures / by the
declaracion of the holy ghost / does report unto us the most certain true worcester
de of God / that we may thereby understand and learn his will / and the
certayntie of his commandments and doctrine / to the intent / bei^ ge
instruct that way of commandments / we may goo straight to ye country
everlasting. Than Sir / what is commanded in the^? Many things are commanded
in them surely: whereof some things in the old testament were chiefly spoken /
not to justify the soul inwardely / but for the keeping of the people in order
/ which in this new people regenerate in Christ / are va nyshed away even as
it were by the light of truth succedinge darkness / which it were superfluous
/ and not to the purpose / to treat of at this present / for somuche as mine
intent is to speak only of those precepts / which God determined to signify
/ not unto ane only sort of people / but by one sort of people / unto all
nationes / whereof not so much as one (...) or one title could be pretermitted.

And these / of some men are called / moral precepts / which / forasmuch as
they perteigne also to holiness and chastity of life and manners / they are
denied to abide still perfitily in their full streynght and virtue. And there of
we may be per suaded / as well by many other places / as namely by this place
of the gospel / where Christ teaching the people / pronounces so plainly / yt
we shall not enter in to the kingdom of heaven / onles our righteousness excede
the righteou snes of the scribes and Pharisees. In which saying / albeit Christ
did not altogether allow the righteousues of the Pharisees / because it was
only a humayne and a carnal righteousness / that is to say / it consists in
outward hypocrisye of deeds / and sprung not out of that fountain of the
spirit / whom the only grace of God (in the same Christ's merits) causes to
spowte water: yet by this conference / we take it / that he showed and
admonished us / the pure behaueour / which the law required in the Scribes and
Pharisees / and not to remitte nor to set it at liberty by the doctrine of the
Gospel / but by that significacion of words / to enlarge the limits of
holiness and chastity / and to require the encreace and gooing forewarde there
of / in this new law of the Gospel. For the liberty which is given unto us
by the Gospel / and is thought tohaue abrogated Moses law / pertains not to
that intent / yt we may forgete the moral precepts and haunt a light
dissolute / and filthy manner of life / but yt we should be free from sin /
and become the servau^tes of righteousenes / and that / look what the will of
God / teaches us in the scriptures / to te^de unto godlynes / we should
hau^te yt / and embrace that / according to gods commandment / so as the
sta te of our obedience may be co^stauntly certain of the which moral
precepts in the old law / to speak of some (for my purpose is not to make
present rehearsal particularly of the^ all) the Leuiticalle precepts / touching
forbidden and incesteous marriages / as far as they concern cha ste and pure
wedlock / where in the hole custom of (...) life is contained / and the
original fountain of the encreace of people consists / are always reputed
to be such sort / that being in deed given furst to the Jews / (because they
should be declared to advaunce the Law of nature) they should perteyne to all
manner of people in the hole world for (...). Where in doubtless / both the

And among these / seeing / there is a (...) dement that a man shall not mary
his brothers wife / what ought or could the king of (...) de his most
excellent Majesty have done / other wise than. Tha^ yt vish. of Cantorbury was
not all yt doer / but yt church and perlia meant.
. by the hole consent of ye people / and judgment of his church / he has
done? that is / that he should be dyvorced from unlawful marriage / and use
laufull and permitted copula cion: and obeyeng (as mete it was) co^formablye
unto the commandment / he should cast of her / whom nether law nor right
permitted him to retain / and take him to chaste and law full marriage. Wherein
/. T. for afmuche as the judgment of gods word might have suffised / where
unto all me^ ought to obey without stopping or stayeng / yet the kings most
royal Majesty was content to have the assisting con sentes of men of notable
gravitie / and the censures of the most famous. D. universities of yt world.
And all to the intent / that men shoul / de think / he did / that he both
might do / and ought to do vprightely well / seeing ye best lear ned and worthy
good men have subscribed / un to it: and that he showed such obedience in so
doing / as the truth of gods word / seems to it were so by gods word

obeyde God / and obeyde truly: of whom / forasmuch as I am purposed to speak
/ I could not pass over with si lence / that / that occasion had commodiously
offered / upon this matter.

But let us return to the purpose / which chiefly stands in this point /
that / we show / that he obeys truly / which walks in the law of the
lord and blenchet not out of the way of Gods commandments / but with an
humble and willinge heart commits him self to Gods will / never to
refuse the authority of God / and to obey both him and al the^ / whom God
commands him to obey for his sake. In deed / God / according to his (...)
great and unspeakable goodness toward mankind / to encreace habundaunce of
glory in us / whereby he might establishe present matter for us / to exercise
our selves godly and thank worthyly in / substituted me^ / who being put in
authority as his vicegerentes / should require obedience / which we must do
unto them with no less fruit / for Gods sake / than we should do it (what
honor so ever it were) (...) unto God him self.

And in that place he has set princes / whom / Prices represe^t Gods Image
/ and excel all me^. (...). Pet. (...) Pro.
as representours of his Image unto men / he would have to be reputed in the
supreme / and most high / rowme / and to excelle among all other humayne
creatures / as Saint Petre wri teth: and that yt same princes reign by his
authority / as the holy Proverbs make report By me (says God) Kings reign
/ in so mu che / that after Paul's saying / who so ever resists (...).
power / resists the ordinance of God. Which Paul openyng that plainly unto
Titus / which he speaks here generallye / commanded him / to warn al men /
to obeie their Princes. And there be other men appointed also of God / to
require obedience / howbeit in an inferior order. For the wife being in
subieccion to her husband / the servant to the master / and to whom so ever
any man is in subieccion / they must also obey their governors for Gods
sake. Whereof it chances now and than that some men / not understanding ye
sense of Gods law rightly / stand in doubt / when two governors
commandments given at all one self same time / varye / and be contrary and
manifestly repugnaunt one to ye other / whether of them ought furst and (...)
principally to be obeyde.

As for example: The master bids the ser uaunt do a thing / and the king
commands him to do a clean contrary thing / and bo the at one time / and
in one moment.

And forasmuch as they ought both to be obei de for gods sake / by the
word of God / the very nature of things / can not admit / both their
commandments / to be applied in at al one self same time / and of al one
self same man here in like as it might perchance be doubted of some man that
hatheth not yet his wits / mu che exercised / whether of them the servant is
bounden chiefly and most principally to obey / even so unto him / that marketh
well other like causes / the solucion of such a question shall anon plainly
appear / that nature it self frames the matter so / that ye inferiors must
also serve and geve place to the superiors.

Therefore in this propou^deth example / the ser vaunt must not obey his master
/ but the king / as his superior master / as him / whom both / the master
and servaunt are bounden to obey.

And for as much as we acknowlage / that there is one above both the servaunt /
master / and King / even God / which is the King of Ki^ ges and Lord of
Lords / of whom al things / things / by whom all things / and in whom all
things are: his commandments all men ought (...) men ought to obey Gods
co^maun (...) though Princes co^maun de a con trary.
to obey / principally and before all things / both servant / master / and
king: that they may appear / to have obeide all men for Gods sa ke / but
noma^ without God / nor against God.

Therefore is the wife praised that obeys her husband / yea / unto death.
For it is better to obey God than men.

Thus in as much as it is manifest / yt an order ought to be kept in obedience
/ and that our due tie is to obey every one chiefly / after such sort / as he
excels other in order and prerogatyve by the testimony of Gods law: I
think it (...). v.
requisite for me (saying I am speaking of the necessary degree of ordres) to
touch also in this place / that cause / which is commonly in ure / and spoken
of at this day almost in all men's hands and in all (...) mouths: whether
ye hole consent of English me^ be grounded upon The Ki^ ges supremacy grou^
ded (...) Gods law.
Gods law / in that they declare and honor the most victorious and most
noble prin ce Henry theyght King of England and of Frauncc / defendour of the
faith / and Lord of Irelande / to be in earth the supreme headde of the
church of England / and is granted unto him / by authority thereof / in the
open court of parliament / freely to use his right / and to call himself
supreme headde of the church of England / as well in name as in deed. Wherein
/ there is no newely invented matter wrought / only their will was / to have the
power perteinyng to a prince / by Gods law / to be the All men bound to

more clearly expressed / with a more fit term to express it by / namely
for this purpose / to withdraw that countrefait vain opinion out of the
common peoples minds / which the false pretensed power of the bishop of Rome /
had / for the space of certain years / blinded the^ with all / to the great
impeaschement of the kin ges authority / which all men are bounden to wish /
and to their uttermost power / see kept safe / restored and defended from
wrongs.

Wherein surely I see no cause / why any man should be offended / that the
king is called the headde of church of England / rather than the headde of
the realm of England. Here now I appeal unto the / gentill reader / to set
aparte the termyng of term words in the mean sea son and to weyghe the matter
self. For I am not ignorant / of the force of both the (...) of speches /
and that this word (church) signi What ye church is.
fieth not every congregaciou / but with an adiec (...) (as / I hate the
malignau^t church) but that only multitude of people / wc bei^ge (...) in the
profession of Christ / is grown in to one body. For this came in by custom /
that this term / church / which else is a common term / became
(notwithstonding) the propre name of a more excellent body. But this word
(Realm) is more plainly known / and comprehends all subjects of the kings
dominions / who so ever they be / and of what condition so ever they be /
whether the be Jews / Barbarianes / Saracenes / Turks or Christianes.

Than / saying in this matter / which I have in hand / the matter that is me^t
by it / is of such sor te / that is agrees indifferently with both manner of
speches / and saying the church of England consists of the same sorts of
people at this day / that are comprised in this word / realm / of whom / the
king his called the headde: shall he not / being called the headde of the
realm of England / be also the headde of the same men / when they are named
the church of England? Shall the termynge of words / inas much as they have
no^ other use / but to signify the things / be of such force in this cause /
as to turn the nature of the things them selves up side down? that one man
should be taken in (...) estate of being / and an other in his estate / all

For there is no subieccio^ against God. What a folly were it than / for a man
to confess / that al one man (if ye lust to call him Johan) dwelli^g in

confess the ki^ge to be supreme hea de of the realm / and yet grant him not
to be supreme headde of the church (on Gods na me) being one congregocion
in the same realm (which is either their own ignorance / or their own

unfaith full / and not of the faithful: except the king / him self be an
infidele / that either an infidele king does bear rule over a faithful or
vnfaithfnll people / or else the same ki^ge copuli^g him self to the

absurd and folishe saye^g is that? As though / because the people begins
now to beleve in God / it were a just cause / why they should be no more in
subieccio^ to the king / Gods lief tenant / but be exempte quyte from his
body. But Paul taught not so / which said / that ye authority of maistres
over their servants should not be changed or dyminished through pro fessing
of Christ / but warned them to keep it still in perfect authority / bidding
servau^tes / to be obedient unto their bodily masters for gods sake. The
converting of a wife unto faith / withdraws nothing from thautoritie of Col.

her husband / for he is the headde of the wife / still / and because she /
after she had professed ye faith / should show no token of mysordre / whereby
she might pluck the my^des of some from religion / Saint Petres mi^de was /
that wives having professed the faith / should leave of ye office of
preachi^g / which they executed by worcester des / and win (without ye word) their
hus bands through their chaste conversacion.

Therefore / the authority of the Maistre / toward the servaunt / and the
right of the hus bands superiority over yt wife / is not lost by ye mean of
religion: and shall it be lost to yt ki^ge? who / forasmuch as he (yea though
he be an infidele) represents / as it were the image of God upon earth / so
that he is called the headde and the guide of the people / shall his state be
nypped of because of the christian profession? and shall he be called no more
the headde of the peo ple / which is the church / but the nerer he draws to
God by faith (which is the only mea ne to com to God / shall he so much the

say yt a King ordained of God (which is yt eternal spirit) should ta ke
charge of spiritual and eternal affairs / before and rather than corporal
matters / and thin ges that shall perish in time. This Ezechias therefore / the
scripture commends so highly / that there was non of all the Kings of Judah /
which observed all the lords precepts like unto him. For his will was to seek
the lord with all his hole heart / as he did in deed and pros pered / as the
scripture testifies. (...). Par. xxviij. What did this Ezechias / I say? In
the very furst year and furst month of his reign / he did not only build up
the gates of the lords house again / but also gave diligence to refourme the
priests them selves / and to repair the lively buylding / that was decayed.
For he not only admonished yt priests / yt dwelt together on the east street
of the city / of their neclige^ce in their office / but also like a man of
authority / said: Hearken o ye Levites and priests: be ye sanctified and make
clean the house of the Lord, the God of your fathers, and put a way all
vnclea^nes from the sayntuarie. etc. I pray you / what could he speak more
impe riously? For he spoke not / as one / that exhorted the^ / as inferiors /
or those that be follow like / use to take in them selves with all / to cau se
the communicacion of the matter / to be the more easily taken. Which manner of
talk is re quisite some time in a gentill godly heart in an others man's
cause. And if Ezechias lusted to have spoken after that rate / he would not
have said / Be ye santified / but let us be santified: not make you clean,
but let us make clean: not put ye away, but let us put away: or if the matter
had been such / that it would not admit feloweship / if a private man should
hawished or declared those cases / it had become him nether to make him self
fellow like with the matter to be required / to exhort them / nor to require it
by the way of commandment.

But the right good prince Ezechias / being taught of God / what his Regal
office / charge and administracion was / used such manner tal ke unto the
priests / as should declare yt autori tie and power of the speaker. Therefore
he spea keth in the imperative mode: Hearken, make clean, and put away. And

order and moderate every thing / that the glory of God / and the profession
of the faith may be advaunced from day to day. But these me^ will sayc:
Princes have acknowlaged the Bishop of Rome / to be the headde of the
universal church: to him they have geven condign honor / as to supreme
headde / to him they have submitted selves / his authority they have
acknowlaged / reuerenceing him as their father / and reioyceing that he called
them sons / so that if we should esteem the right by the deeds / and if it
be enough to teach deeds for the prose of the right / so as / what so ever is
apparauntly done / we must confess it to be done rightefully: than doubtless
the Bishops of Romes cause shall be on the better hand.

I would not be reputed so vain or so (...) a man (which is yt formust end of
my thought) winchestre not ipude^t / no full loathe.

when I shall grant to such things as ca^ not be denied / me thinks / that

yet it shows his efficacy / by one shifte or other / that we may
understand it to be presently oppressed / but not utterly extincte / even so
in the mean season / deeds / which seem to dymynishe the right title / and
authority of the prince / a certain light of the truth has always peeped
out / as it were / out of most deep darkness / whereby he that mark it more
nerely and. more surely / might perceave / that these deeds were not hoole nor
perfect / ne grounded upon just foundaciones / but had a greater appearaunce
of truth / than true in deed / and tokens of honor rather borrowed than
paid. For if that opinion had ever sonke in to Princes hearts / that the
Bishop of Rome had been Christ's vicare on earth / that is / the headde
ordained of God to be over all / unto whom al things should bow / all
things should obey / without whom / nothing must be reconed holy nor sacred

than strong testimony of Gods truth / if they could yet to this day have
brough out any such / in the defense of their authority: nether durst the
princes have been so bold / every oue in his time / as to nyppe away that same
authority (which they seemed to grant in words and terms of speech) after
that facio^ in their procedinges / and doings / not in corners but openly in
the face of the world: I speak of such princes / whose excellent religious
devotion / the world now after their deaths / reverenceth and worshippeth:
and reconeth them among the nombre of Sai^tes verily if our elders had believed
/ that God had committed the charge of all the hoole world / unto the bishop
of Rome / what wilful boldenes caused them / to make so many sta tutes against
/ and contrary to that charge and power aduau^ceing it self / under that
prete^se? and as they would have done many other thin ges / yet they durst
never have been so bold / to do / that they did / to have purposed to

the superior / or against him / it is not laufull to make any law. For
inferiors prescribe not laws to the superiors / nether do they laufully
make penalties against their gouuernement / how wicked / or intolerable so ever
it be. Therefore our elders / and princes / that were before time / when they
assembled together to counsel upon matters of the common weal / taking
deliberate advisement in their open counsels / have by statutes and laws

Romes eyes / that it should not serve the^ to look over / so far as unto us:

that is his vicare / if he do his office faithfully / are / not to bear rule
/ but to be in subieccio^ / not to commau^de princes / but to acknowlage him

things indiffe rent / and easily to bedone / but also when they command
things not indifferent / so they be not wicked: in checkes / in scourgi^ges /
and beatinges unto death / yea eue^ to the death of the cross. In deed /
these are Christ's fotesteppes / and this is the majesty of rule bearing in
Christ: This / I say / is the true power of Christ / unto us both wondrous /
and exceeding holsom: by the which also is power given to us / to become the
children of God. This he taught and expres sed in his doi^ges / touchi^g yt
kingdom of Israel. His dreami^g disciples he always rebuked: but he never
hyndred Cesares tribute / nor any man's authority / one jot by his deeds. And
seeing it is so / I wene / I have made it manifest / if we considre Christ's
deeds / which may not be altered nor doubtefully interpreted: we shall find
plainly / that all is clean contrary / that the bis shop of Rome chale^geth to
hi^ self / as Christ's vicare. This therefore only remains / that he flee to
the words of the evangelists / which (how so ever men have varied in the

them? Mary Sir / this. Whether Christ / the way / the truth and the life /
spoke ever any thingh / wheri he should disagree from his own deeds? yt where
he never sought authority among me^ / he gave it not withstondi^g to the bishop
of Rome / to use as his vicare. This in deed is the sum of the question / in
words (as it is pro pounded) blasphemous / and wicked / but yet it paynteth
out the matter / that I have in hand. For where in all other matters / as ye
eua^geliste reports / Jesus begane to do and to teach / and to teach that
he did: And in this one only matters / which we now treat of / if he taught any
whitte of that / which the bishop of Rome claymeth at this day to him self /
by Christ's title / that is / to be above Princes / by Christ's worcester des / we
must needs confess / that Christ taught in words / that whereof he not only
showed no example in him self / but showed clean contrary in all the hole
course of his life before. Let this therefore remain still iu ye cause / that
Christ's deeds stand on our side / which may not be wre sted by no man's
interpretacion: only the que stio^ is i Christ's words / we now and tha^ /
ma^ues interpretacion is so sawcye as to blemyshe.

Albeit he that shall stand with the bishop of Rome in this cause / might
furst of al / stick fast in this point: that there is not found in the holy
scriptures / so much as one syllabe / of ye bishop of Rome / so yt what
interpretacion of Christ's words so ever he will stand to / he might seem to
lose his accion / as they say. For what is the consequency than? Christ would
have Petre to be above Princes / asit appears it was never his mind. Ergo he
would have the bishop of Rome to be so to. Why / because he his Petres
successor? I say no more / but I would he were. And than / in that case / I
doubt not / but he should be above all me^ / though not in hault estate of
worldly power (as out of doubt he ha the non such) yet in admiracion and
reverence of in ward virtue / and in that point / Christ would have those that
his be / to excelle and be ring leaders even above emperors: as those / unto
whom / bei^ge his Ambassadors / he gave the keys of the kingdom of heaven /
and among them / unto Petre / which in all their names / Petre spoke one for
the^ all.
had spoken so wholesome a confession / to acknowlage Jesus / to be the son of
the living God. Which confession / like as flesh and blood had not reveled /
even so was there no prerogative given unto flesh and blood in Petre / what so
ever was given / but to the chiefer part / which was the spirit / to ye
intent / that being endued the more pleynteously with the Grace of God / he
should be the ring leader in virtue and might of the word of God / and in
the power of ru ling affecciones. Yfwe should so interpret Christ's words /
as if they meant some externe power / in rule bearing / which al other folks /
should acknowlage them selves to be under / yea even Princes to / albeit the
same self God have set them in the superior rowne / so that nothing else
could be allcged / how could that sentence of Christ sto^de together? The
disciple (...). xiij
is not greater than his master, namely if the disciple would not be co^te^t
to be in subieccio^ / as Christ was / but execute ye supreme power him self /

of Petres supremacy / and Eusebeus in Ecclesiastica historia / reports /
that Clemens in sexto li. Dispositionum, affirmed / that Petre / Ioha^ / and

although he had set them almost above all the apostles / yet they took not the

never a word of any supremacy of wordly ad ministracion / but he appointed

/ the flesh and the dyvell / to be the forewardest / and as it were the
enseigne bearours / in the very foremost rank. Whom he knew / to be of better

they were not tangled nor let with any charge of worldly matters / and might
by their example of constaunce / encoura^ge / allure / and provoke other of the
weaker sort / to become soldiers of yt band also. In which kind of
warrefarre / though Christ / maki^g choice of his own / gave the uppermost
standing to Petre / among the brotherne / it was no marvaill: saying he had so
armed him / yt he knew before hand / though he would geve back from the
enemy perhaps for a time / yet he would not geve it over so / but to it
again stotaly / and fight like a tall fellow for the defense of the truth. Ha
/ was Petre the chief than? No man says nay. For he confessed Christ / to be
the very son of the lyvyng God / furst. And Petre was of as constaunt and
steadfast minds / in defending of the same truth / at all times / as any man
was. He was the furst after Christ / that taught the Jews. And i^ thassemblye
of thapostles / wha^ one should needs speak in all their names / Petre /
sometime as the matter required / was chief in the tale telling. Therefore I will
not say nay to the argument / which they call: Argumentum a coniugatis, but
that Saint Petre / bei^ge by so many ways and reasones / the furst / might
also be thought to be chief among thapostles. For like as the wise man has
wisdom / in that he is a wise man: so has the chief man ye chief place or
supremacy. What than? he yt is chief of all ye Phisicianes / has not he also
the supremacy among Phisicianes? For why should he not? Among Paynters also /
if there were any in these days / as connyng as Appelles or Pharrhasius was /
and were called therefore ye head Paynter / would we not say / that he had the
supremacy among paynters? yea doubtless. In universities / again / if it were
agreed by all (...) consentes / that (...) of Parrise / as being a vniuer sitie
most playnteously furnished and occupied with great learned men / should be
called the headde university of the world / might not ye name of supremacy
be fit for it / being chief among other universities / yes doubtless. But let
us come nerer to the matter. If a man / when he had set one man to govern the
hole householde / wherein inasmuche as he had a great forte of young men / whom
he would feign have taught and instructed in good arts / and would provide
many scholeruaisters / and among other / there were one man excellently well
learned above the rest / whom / as a notable man among other / he would call
the chief of all the scholemaisters that he had gotten: and to whose
instruccion he would commit / those that he sets most by: has not he /
seeing he is chief scholemaister / the supremacy? yes. For the chief person can
not chose / but have chief rule in any matter: For these two words / Primus,
which is furst / principal / or chief / and Primatus, which is chief rule /
preeminence / and is here rightly englished / supremacy / are coniugata, that
is to say / lynked to gether / the one depen ding of the other / not only in
speech / but also in matter. Nevertheless this question may be asked: he / of
whom I spoke / ye chief scholemaister in this householde / if there should fall
any controversy / touching manners / or order / whether of their autoritics
should be esteemed above the other / his / unto whom the householde was
committed / or his / that is callad to instrue te the youth? he that is called
the chief / as I said / and therefore he has the supremacy. Who doubts /
but his rowme is the greater / that has charge of the householde? why so? For
it sto^deth most with reason / because order is sometime changed by relacion.
And that / which in one relacion is supreme and chief / in an other or in a
contrary relacio^ / has (...) an inferior place / and often times the lowest
place of all. And so God ye son / is equal with the father / after his
divinity / but he is less tha^ the father / after is humanity.

Also God the son / in that he is God / is in ye beginning / and is the
beginning it selse: but in that he is the son of God / he is the second
person in nombre: (...) without all consideracion of time / he is without
beginning as God the father is. But to fette examples / out inferior matters:
Do we not fee all one man to use diverse offices at home / like Arithmeticall
figu res / now to occupy the furst and chief rowme / than the second /
afterward the third / and sometime a lower rowme / as the cause / wherein he is
occupied / and place / where company meteth / do require? Do we not see him /
that sits highest among judges / and for that cause / is called / the chief
judge / when he is required / to be present in extraordinary judgments / as
it is often seen / placed after others in the third or fourth rowme? But in
divine offices / I pray you / how great a supremacy as I may to call it /
has the chappelayne over his master / as long as he is in divine
ministracion? And (...) when he is out of the place / and cast of his gaire /
he leaves his supremacy behind him.

And it is no marvail. For in this case / the matter stondeth so / that who so
minds to reteyne the name of the chief person and chief office still / must
not swarve from the thing / whereunto ye nvme was applied and setto. Therefore
to return unto examples. Admit / there were a fa mous chief Phisician / that
is to say / were as conning in Phisike as any man / and so / because the matter
so requires it / he keeps still / his preeminence / yea Sir / but while he
meddleth with Phisike: But forasmuch as there is an other manner of office in
the administracion of ye common weal / let him be content also with his
second form / and stryve not to bear rule over other / because he is the
chief Phisician: nether let him take autortie upon him to be a co^maunder of
the rest of the Phisicianes / which is not given him in his preeminence / not
because he could not give it hi^ / which so preferred him / but because it was
not his pleasur to give it hi^ for it was no reason why he should: or else
which is the sorest thing to speak of all / why he did not: Mary Sir /
because he made him not absolutely chief / but he called him the chief
Phisician. Admit also a curious (...) payntour / to be chief payntour / let
him stryve also to continue still in his chief payntourship / lest an other
pass him in connyng / and so have the name of chief payntour from him /
because he is more worthy than he. Let the university of Parrise rejoice not
so much of the honor of the name / as to study to make it good / that it
attributed by the name. Finaly let this scholemaister / which is called to
teach children / because the good man of the house thought not the person of
the man / but the virtue hidden under the person / whorthye the honor of chief
scholemaister / remember and remember again / that he is not honored / but
burdened with ye name / and let him study rather according to ye the intent of
the name / to show him self chief / in the office of teaching / than to abuse
the vain title of a name / and as though he were chief absolutely without
condition / yet neclecting his office / and so losing his supremacy / to
contend and stryve / about the name and term of it / with them / that as
being set in authority to govern the householde / have the true and absolute
supremacy in deed: and to myngle Gods matters / and the worlds matters
together / so that he may overcome / by right or by wrong / and have it as him

of Rome have done / which not regarding those things / that were added unto

Boniface had perceived / he nedde not to have gotten that / by pri uilege of

surcesse not their old ca^kred mind: that they were counseled of some body /
not to conte^de to be called supremes / as long as they are still postremes:
But if their delight were to be so called / they should see / by what things
that title was gotten / and by what things / it was proprely attributed. For
like as in a well ordered city / those that are chief in riches / are not
therefore chief in authority: even so in Christ's church / they are not put i^
authority above other / that excede other in po^pe / lordely estate and riches.
And therefore if the supremacy of ye church of Rome in times past / with great
consent of the world / stood / in ye office of preachi^g Gods word / if in

charge of Christ's name if i^ pro^pte valeau^tnes of mind / to defend the
truth / and to keep ye faith of Christ from heresies / as it is most plain
that in those days it did / when the bishops of Rome (yea almost non but they)
at the furst beginning of the spring of the church / were diligent to heal
the furour of tyrannes ragei^g against christian people: I wene / there is never
a christen prince in the world / but if he saw the bishops of Rome /
contend about that su premacie faithfully / that they might godly and zelously
pass all other bishops (that ye church of Christ / where so ever it is
scattred / has) in godlynes in faith / and religious devotion / and would
stryve to goo so far before / that in this race they might be worthily called
ye furst. If the princes / I say / might see this in them / they would with
good will / call them by those true names / that they saw with their eyes: and
him that they spied to be furst / they would call chief / in that match game:
and in that kyndc of supremacy / they would reverence him with due honor /
according to his virtue. And with this opinion / seems our elders were induced
(which openion also dured unto our time) yt (...) how hipocrysie ca^begile men
of simple wits.
they would give ye bishops of Rome wages / for their pains / which called
them selves the seruauutes of Gods servants, not only in name / as they do
now / but matter in deed in those days. Howbeit the name of a seruau^te /
signifies a service. For a servant commands not his labors to be set out
/ but he sets them asale / as it were in an open place / to provoke some body
to hyre him. Wherein notwithstonding / some make such a show of their labors /
in commending their diligence and fidelity / and make them so sale kene / that
they cause many to be desirous of them: and bring them in that mind / that /
when their busynes might both better and more spedily be dispatched at home /
yet they think / nothing can be comely nor well done / without their counsel.
And forasmuch as we see that daily chance / in sundry kinds of craftesmen /
and in every trifling matter: it is no marvaill / though it be so in religion /
wherein / all men wish / that all things were ordered / according to the most
perfect example / wherein for all that / many men partly distrust their own
wits / partly use currupte wits / in that / they esteem strange ware more
than domestical stuf: no man ought / I say / to think it any marvaill /
though the glorions name of the church of Rome / being at that time famous in
excellent virtue / drawing and alluring almost all the parts of the world /
in to admiracion of it / for virtues sake / which is the most sure bond / knyt
all men to it / and cau sed that church / whom al men might see so notably
virtuous / to be reverenced / as the chief and principal church among other.
And Godly me^ beautified it also with those names / wc ye To mishe bishops
make boast of to the world / as though they were set furthe by oracle from God
/ to the supremacy withal / not the supremacy of virtue / but the supremacy
of power / and that earthly / an externe and a fleshly power / such a one as
Christ never exercised / nor committed it at any time to any (...) to exercise
/ as far as we may gather out of holy scriptures. Wherout notwithsto^ding /
seeing some men have piked out somthinges / wherewith they would confirm it to be
commanded and ordained of Christ / whereunto the people and ye princes / would
even of their own voluntary will / because of their great virtue / wherewith
they were allured / as it had been me^ drawn up with an admounde ston / would
have granted them / that is / that they would not only honor and reverence
that church of Rome / and the bishop thereof / but also advaunce the^ with
those titles: which godly affeccion is wont to divise and vttere / wherein good
me^ do sometime errc: yet forasmuch / as because many men have set furthe many
books touchi^g this matter / and by reason of mutual conflicte of men reasonyng
with it and against it / it is more than manifest that those place of
scripture / are wrested from their true and propre meaning / to defend that
authority / I though it not mete / to do that is done already / and in maki^g
rehersall of them / to make men think / I had given them a pigge of an others
ma^nessowe. Wherein the mean space / lest I should seem to cast away al menues
wrytinges / I do not so much contend about the supremacy so they rack it
out no further / tha^ it appears to be me^t from ye beginni^g But this I
utterly deny / that God ordained the bishop of Rome to be the chief / as
touching any absolute wordly power: of this is the question / in this point the
hole cause consists.

In this matter / I wene / I have made it plain enough / that Christ's deeds
stand on ourside / and that ye name of supremacy usurped of our elders makes
nothing against us: and that the title / having a right interpretacio^ joined
unto the power / which the bishop of Rome claims now to himself / makes
nothing for his purpose / and moreover / that the prerogatives / wc God gave
unto Petre / crownyng his own gifts in him / help ye Bishop of Romes cause
nothing at all: which: prerogatives were not given unto flesh and blood / but

nie of that exellent profession of his faith.

And such would God (whose liberal goodness does never waste) give yet still /
unto these bis shoppes of Rome / if they followed thexample of Petres faith.

But if the bish oppes of Rome goo about / to ke pe in state still and hold up
ye decays of their power (whose bulding was naught / and therefore has wryed
on the one side long a goo) with proppes and stays / divised by man's brain /

gaire almost every body has in their mouths. Yea / some cry out / that they

some speak less / and more temperatelye than some. and some there be also / which

church upon earth. They bid the bishop of Rome farewell: whose labor /
how so ever it has been received in times past / even so now as unprofitable
and discommodious / they have no more devotion to it / as a thing / wherein a
man should have no deuocio^ / but to turn such a chappelayn / out of the
doors / will he nyll he / as bei^ge hired or prayed to ministre divine service
/ has not showed him self faithful and diligente / in his office / unto

upon him to be lord of lords / in his doi^ges / though in the mean space /

And yet all men / for christian charites sake / pray for him and wish him

may now write from Rome / to them that be under his obedience / such things
/ as tend to the true glory of Christ / and concern the advauncement of
faith / rather than such ware / as has crept in to ye world / these years
past / from those high pote^tates (...) stoare houses. To be short / God
send him good life / and well to fare in the lord.

But I will return to my purpose: that is / that I may move all men to
obedience / which only in ye commandments of God / and for Gods sake /
makes us happy and blessed. And commandments of God / are clear / and

For it comes to pass by the grace of God / which is made by Jesus Christ /
that things impossible unto the flesh / are accompli shed by the spirit with
chearefulnes / by love / that is powered in our hearts / by ye holy ghost /
which is given us / and seeing we are now renewed in the spirit of our mind /
and become spiritual: we may say with Saint Paul: We are hable to do all

cause than / to make us afraude / of the weightye importance of the thing /
which through the benefit of Christ / by means of Me^nes intcrpre tacions not

And here I could have made an end of my tale / had not some folks folishe
words ben / yt had almost pulled me down backewarde and enforced me to render
account of my self / what caused me to be so hardye / as to write one worcester de /
concerning any manner of obedte^ce / namely true obedience / seeing I nevertheless
/ entreprising to teach obedience / disclose mine own dis obedience / and
give the ousette against his power and authority / for whose defeuse I was
called ones to be a patron / and bounde^ by mine oath to defend and maitene
his authority to my possible power? where is the keeping of oaths become / say
they? Where is fidelity? What may a man beleve now a days? Who^ may a man
trust? ffor he was made a bishop and by the privilege of the Bishop of Rome /
admitted in to the order of Bishops / and consecrated by his commandment /
and sworn upon the holy evangelists to defend the rightes of the church of
Rome: all which things he willi^gly and with all his heart obeyde / and
permised to perform. So / say they / even the very self same man / to the
most horrible example of breach of his fidelity / and forgotting the solemn
oath / he made / or if not through forgotefulnes / yet (which is the worse of
the two) having contemned and defied his oath and fidelity / he professes
him self an open enemy of the chur che of Rome / and to shote his poisoned
shaftes the more surely against it / he boroweth a piece of artillary as it were
of obedience / and thinks he lies closely in covert / as though his sides
were ouerhilled / when for all that / he lies open and naked to al menues
sightes / both like a fool and a naughty man. Such me^ / as will talk on this
sort / I am afraid / and in great doubt / how I shall satisfy them. For they
will allege perhaps / to amend the matter withal / a cer tai^ prejudice of
soul / I wot not what / wherewith their mind being blown full / they will
spue out that that I shall speak / even as it were a vessel being top full
of water / that receaveth no more liquor / wha^ it is poured upon. But they yt
shall hear these men's talk / and than on the other side will indifferently
read my saying / with an empty and free mind / and not all ready brynke
full: I doubt not / but I shall show unto them / and persuade them so / that
their words as weyghtye as men think them (in deed they accuse me of perjury
and slaundre (condemn them for false reporters / yt speak them: and that they
ought no more to move me / against whom they be reported / than the blombling
sound of an old barel / as they say. For in oaths or promises / the form

ought not so much to be respected / as yt matter. But let a man / say /
swear / or promise as faithfully as he can / that thing that he ought not to
do nor perform / ye promise shall not be above the nature of the matter self:
nether shall yt form in these cases / change the condition of the matter / but
the faithfully made oath / if it be stark naught / or not good / is better
broken / than under pretense of the oath / as though it were the bo^de of
widkednes / it should be performed and kept: onles we must be persuaded /
that constauncie is commendable in naughty and and perverse matters / and that
it is a greater fault to turn again in the mydde way than still to run
always naught. And for the more clear demonstracion of this matter / I take
this to be the most fit example. A certain married man / when he thought by
most just likelyhodes / that his furst wife had be^ undoubtedly deadde: as a
man that had be^ free from marriage / by the authority of the church / took
another woman / which was a fair damoysell / and An example / fatched not
far of.
thought to be a maid / to wife by consent of her parents: by who^ / after
they had dwelt a few years together / and he had children by her: Lo / his
former wife unlooked for / came again / as it were peeping behind the post.
Well / she requires to have her husband again / that had done evil in marieng
an other woman. Than ye man being astonyed at that / as a matter almost
incredible / and dryven at the furst to deny her to be his wife: than to ask
her what tokens she could tell him / and last of all / because he was
wondrous loathe to be divorced from her / that he had married the later / to
make as long delays as he could: and at leinght to call her to the law / and
there to make all the shifte he could / to defend his second wifes cause. But
when he was cast / he gave place to the truth / and takes his furst wife to
him again by the judgment of the church. In this case now / if the woman /
that he married last be justly put from him / or for sorrow and heavines
speakig never a word / her Parents or friends would cry out: Out upon men's
manners? out upon it / what a world is this? and after this sort would make
such a like wondremcnt / as these me^ seem to use against me: thou helhounde /
thou wicked covenant breaker / do thou forsake and cast of this woman now /
unto whom thou made ones so faithful a promise in the open face of the
church / when God him self was a present witness? have thou forgote^ the
words which thou spakest in the temple / the ministre of God rehearsing them
unto the / in the presences of so many people / this woman / yt thou have now
shamefully cast up / being present / and making covenant and promise to the in
like sort again? Did not thou ones desire us for her / and made much
entreatie to have her to thy wife / and promisedest us upon thy oath / yt thou
woldcst use her as the good wife of thy house for ever / and never to forsake
her during thy life? Art thou not ashamed / seig thou have such children by
her / to cast her of now / as though she were an whore? and now when thou
leavest her to take her part / that caused the to be divorced from her? Where
is the keeping of oaths become? where is fidelity? what may a man beleve now a
days? whom may a man trust? The husband forsakes the wife.

Which manner of communictcion / as it may be borne withal in the woman's
heavynes / both for the great grief of her present calamity / and because she
is the weaker vessel / even so when it is spoken of other men's mouths /
which would have folks to thike / they speak pithily / it would make men
think / they were stark foles / and in open company / every body would laughe
at them / and in trial of law noman couldc abide them. But after a certain
space / if a man would answer yr womau: and say: woman you do not well to
accuse him / that you want now to be your husband and defendour: For what
fault find you now in him? For as long as the farther wife held her away /
he loved you / he honored you / he used you as his wife: yea so much / that
wha^ the furst wife came again / who^ he thought had been deadde / he was not
rash in giving credence unto her / nor suddenly assented unto her: he could
do no more for your sake / than he did. If he had fallen to whores / and so
forsaken you / your querell had been somewhat. But now / what cast you him in ye
tethe / with faith breaking / which to keep his faith / departed from you /
and kept him to that other wife / that he had laufully married before? Why do
you complain still? the woman / I wene / would give over: in deed she had no
cause to complain. If she had not be^ a maiden / as she was taken for / but an
evil dispo sed woman / and had occasioned this man's first wi fe / to be sent
in to some far ylondes / to have this man to her husband in ye mean time /
and cau Say youtrue do you love change of women / as he did?
sed ye furst marriage to be broken: whether should be thought to be more in
the fault? this man / yt married (as he thought) rightly / were in no fault:
and the subtle woman werein yt greatest fault / as one yt delighted to have
an other woe ma^s husband. And if a man would considre this gaire / shall he not

wc will require the furst promise / at all me^nes hands to her I applied / to
her I cleaved: and from my second knotte / as of no^ affecte / by ye iud
geme^t of my church / I departed. And shall any man think it indifferent /
that I shall be called a liar / because I obey the truth? Because I serve God
/ in obey eng my Prince / yt I shall be reported to be a contemner of the
sacraments / or an oath breaker? And that / that is fondly laid to the
husbands charge / after he is divorced / because he performed not his promise
/ that he ought not to have made: shall that in this cause be grevously and
earnestly tromped in my way / because I am by most grave judgment of the
truth / divorced from the church of Rome / which it was not laufull for me to
keep still and am compelled to take my wife Truth to me / when she comes
again at leynght peeping behind the scrine / and to cleave co^stauntly unto
her? If he could teach me / yt she is not the truth / whom / I have received
