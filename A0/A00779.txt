This sermon following was compyled and said in the Cathedral church of saint
Poule within ye cite of London by the right reverend fader in god John^
bishop of Rochester / the body being present of the most famous prince
king Henry the. vii. the ix. day of May / the year of our lord god. M.
CCCCC. ix. which sermon was enprynted at the special request of ye right
excellent pryncesse Margarete mother unto the said noble prince and Countess of
Rychemonde and Derby.



DIlexi. etc. For as much as this honorable audyen ce now is here assembled to
prosecute the funeral obseruaunces and ceremonies about this most noble
pry^ce late our king and sovereign / king Henry ye seventh. And all be it I
know well mine un worthynes and vnhabylytees to this so great a matter / yet
for my most bounden duty / and for his gracyous favor and synguler benefeytes
exhybyte unto me in his life / I would now after his death right affectuously
some thing say / whereby your charytees ye rather might have his soul
rece^mended. And to that purpose I will entreat the first psalm of the dirige
/ which psalm was written of the holy king and prophet king David /
co^fortynge him after his great falls and trespasses against almighty god and
read in the church in the funeral obsequyes of every christian person when
that he dies. And specially it may be read in the person of this most noble
prince / for in it is comprysed all that is to be said in this matter. And in yt
same order that the seculer orators have in their funeral oracyons most
dylygently observed which rests in. iij. points First in the co^mendacyon
of him that deed is. Second in a styrynge of the herers to have compassyon
upon him And third in a comfortynge of them again. Which. iij be done by
order in this same psalm as by the grace of our lord it may here after
appear. First as touching his laud and co^mendacyon let no man think that
mine intent is for to praise him for any vain transytory things of this life /
which by the example of him all kings and princes may learn how slydynge /
how slyppery / how faylyng they be. All be it he had as much of them as was
possible in manner for any king to have / his polytyque wisdom in governance
it was synguler / his wit always quycke and ready / his reason pytthy and
substancyall / his memory fresshe and holding / his experyence notable / his
counseylles fortunate and taken by wise delyberacyon / his speech gracyous in
diverse languages / his person goodly and amyable / his natural complexyon of
the purest myxture / his issue fair and in good nombre / leages and
confederyes he had with all christian princes / his mighty power was dredde
every where / not only with in his realm but without also / his people were
to him in as humble subgeccyon as ever they were to king / his land many a
day in peace and tranquyllyte / his prosperyte in battle against his enemies
was meruaylous / his delynge in time of perils and dangers was cold and
sobre with great hardynesse. If any treason were conspyred against him it came
out wonderfully / his treasour and richesse incomparable / his buyldynges
most goodly and after the newest cast all of pleasure. But what is all this
now as unto him / all be but Fumus and vmbra A smoke that soon vanyssheth /
and a shadow soon passing away. Shall I praise him than for them. Nay
forsothe. The great wife man Solon when that the king Cresus had showed unto
him all his glorious state and condycyon that he was in as touching the
things above rehearsed he would not afferme that he was blessed for all that
but said. Expectandus est finis. The end is to be abyde^ and looked upon /
wherein he said full truth / all be it perauenture not as he intended but
verily a troth it is / in the end is all together / a good end and a gracyous
conclusyon of the life makes all / and therefore Senec in his epystles says.
Bonam vite clausula^ impone. In any wise make a good conclusyon of thy life /
which thing I may conferme by holy letters. In the prophet Ezechiel it is
written and spoken by the mouth of god in this manner. Iusticia iusti non
liberabit eu^ in quacu^que die peccauerit and impietas impij no^ nocebit ei in
quacu^que die co^uersus fuerit ab ipietate sua. That is to say / if ye
rightwyse man have lived never so virtuously / and in ye end of his life
committee one deedly syn^e and so depart / al his ryghtwyse delynge before
shall not defend him from everlasting dampnacyon / and in contrary wise / if
the synful man have lived never so wretchedly in times past yet in the end of
his life if he return from his wyckednes unto god / all his wyckednes before
shall not let hy^ to be saved. Let no sinner presume of this to do amysse or to
continue the longer in his sin / for of such presumers scant one among a.
M. comes unto this grace but the death takes them or they beware. Let no man
also murmr against this / for this is the great treasour of the mercy of
almighty god / and against such murmures is suffycye^tly answered in ye same
place / for what should become of any of us ne were this great mercy. Quis
potest dicere mu^du^ est cor meu^ innocens ego su^ a pcto^. Who may say (says
ecclesiasticus) mine heart is clean / I am innocent and gyltles of sin. As who
says / no man may speak this word. When than all men have in their life
trespassed against almighty god. I may well say that he is gracyous that makes
a blessed end. And to that purpose saint John^ in the appocalyps says. Beati
mortui qui in dn^o moriuntur. Blessed are tho which have made virtuous end
and conclusyon of their life in our lord / which verily I suppose this most
noble prince has done / the proof whereof shall stand in four points. The
first is a true tournynge of his soul from this wretched world unto the love
of almighty god. Second is a fast hope and confydence yt he had in prayer.
Third a steadfast believe of god and of ye sacraments of the church. Fourth in
a dylygent asking of mercy in ye time of mercy / which. iiij. points by
order be expressed in the first part of this psalm. As to the first at the
beginning of lent last passed he called un to him his confessoure a man of
synguler wisdom / learning and virtue / by whose assured instruccyon I speak
this that I shall say. This noble prince after his confession made with all
dylygence and great repentance / he promised three things that is to say / a
true reformacyon of all them that were officers and ministres of his laws to
the intent that Justyce from hens for ward truly and indyfferently might be
executed in all causes. An other that the promocyons of the church that were
of his dysposycyon should from hens forth be dysposed to able men such as were
virtuous and well learned. Third that as touching the dangers and Jeopardyes
of his laws for things done in times passed he would grant a pardon
generally unto all his people / which. iij. things he let not openly to speak
to diverse as did resort unto him And many a time unto his secret servants
he said that if it pleased god to send him life they should se him a new
changed man. Ferthermore with all hu^blenes he recognized the synguler and
many benefeytes that he had received of almighty god / and with great repentance
and meruaylous sorrow accused himself of his unkindness toward hy^ /
specially yt he no more fervently had procured ye honor of god / and that he
had no more dylygently performed the will and pleasure of him / wherein he
promised by the grace of god an assured amendment. who may suppose but that
this man had verily set his heart and love upon god / or who may think that in
his person may not be said Dilexi. That is to say / I have set my love on my
lord god. King David that wrote this psalm / all be it he had been an auoutrer
and murdrer also / yet with one word speky^ge his heart was changed saying.
Peccaui. This king said and confessed it many times with great sorrow and
great repentance / promisynge fully a true amendment of all h^s life /
wherefore in his person it may also be said Dilexi. That is to say / I have
turned mine heart and love un to god. The cause of this love was ye fast hope yt
he always had before in prayer / It is not unknown the studyous and desirous
my^de that he had unto prayer. which he procured of relygyous and seculers
church thrughout his realm In all ye chirches of England daily his collecte
was said for him. Besides that diverse years about lent he sent money to be
dystrybuted for. x. M. l. masses peculeer to be said for him. Over this was in
his realm no virtuous man that he might be credybly enfourmed of / but he gave
him a contynuall remembrance yearly to pray for him / some. x. mark / some.
x. li. besides his yearly and daily alms unto the prisoners / and the other
poor and nedy / for the which it may be thought undoubtedly that he had great
hope and confydence in prayer / which prayer and confydence therein / no doubt
of was cause of the very tournynge of his soul to the fast love of god. And
for that he says. Dilexi quonia^ exaudiet dn^s. I love because I had an hope
that my lord should gracyously here me / but what shall he here. Vocem
deprecationis me The voice of a prayer makes it more audyble. A soft breast
may not be herd far of / his prayer therefore was helped with all theyrs that
prayed with him and for him / and their prayer was as the voice of him which
was so great that it must needs be herd. Impossible est multorum p^ces no^
exaudiri says saint Austyn / that is to say / the prayer of many can not be
but herd. One of the kings of Juda whose name was Manasses after many great
abhomynacyons and outrages against almighty god as it appears in the fourth
book of the kings / and in the second of paralipomenon / he prayed unto hy^
for mercy with true repentance / and mercy was given unto him. If this so
great a sinner for his own prayer were herd of god. How may we doubt / but
where so great a nombre prays for one as did for our late king and sovereign
/ but that all yt nombre shall be herd. Qm^ exaudiet dn^s voce^ dep^catio^is
me. The cause of this hope was the true believe yt he had in god / in his
church and in the sacraments thereof / which he received all with merueylous
devotion / namely in the sacrament of penance / the sacrament of ye auter /
and the sacrament of anelynge. The sacrament of penance with a meruaylous
compassyon and flow of teres / yt at some time he wept and sobbed by the
space of. iij. quarters of an hour / the sacrament of the auter he received at
mydlent / and again upon eester day with so great reverence yt all that were
present were astonyed thereat / for at his first enter in to the closet where
the sacrament was he took of his bonet and kneled down upon his knees and so
crept forth devoutly till he came unto ye place self where he received the
sacrament. Two days next before his departy^ge he was of that feebleness yt he
might not receive it again. yet nevertheless he desired to se the monstrau^t
wherein it was contained / the good fader his confessor in goodly manner as was
conuenyent brought it unto him / he with such a reverence / with so many
knockynges and betynges of his breast with so quycke and lyfely a countenance /
with so desirous an heart made his humble obeysau^ce thereunto / and with so great
humblenes and devotion kyssed not the self place where ye blessed body of our
lord was contained / but the lowest part the foot of the monstraunt / that
all that stood about him scarssy might conteyne them from teres and weeping
The sacrament of anelynge when he well perceived that he began utterly to fail
/ he desyrously asked therefore / and hertely prayed that it might be
admynystred unto him / wherein he made ready and offered every part of his body
by order / and as he might for weykenes turned himself at every time and
answered in ye suffrages thereof. That same day of his departing he herd mass
of the glorious virgyn the mother of christ to whom always in his life he had a
synguler and special devotion. The image of the crucyfyxe many a time that
day full devoutly he did behold with great reverence / lyftynge up his heed
as he might / holding up his hands before it / and often enbrasynge it in his
arms and with great devotion kissing it / and betynge often his breast / who
may think that in this manner was not perfyte faith / who may suppose that by
this manner of dely^ge he faithfully believed not yt the eere of almighty god was
open unto him and ready to here him cry for mercy / and assystent unto these
same sacraments which he so devoutly received / and therefore in his person
it may be said. Quia inclinauit aurein suam michi. For the fourth point which
was a dylygent asking of mercy in the time of mercy. It follows. Et in diebus
ineis inuocaui. That is to say / and in my days I have called for mercy /
which were his days. Ueryly all the time of his life. As long as a man
lives in this mortal life and truly calls upon almighty god for mercy / he
may trust assuredly to have it. So it appears by saint John^ in the appocalyps
saying. Ecce dedi illi te^pus vt pniam ageret. I have given him time to
repent him / and all this time almighty god mercyfully abides the return of
the sinner to the entente he may have mercy upon him / as it is written in the
prophet Esaye. Expectat vos deus vt misereatur vestri. There is no part of
his life but a sinner if he truly call for mercy he may have it / wytnessynge
the prophet Ezechiel Impietas impii non nocebit ei in quacu^que die conuersus
fuerit ab impietate sua In what day soever the sinner tourneth him from his
sin / his sin shall not noye him / much rather than if he do it many days
and specially those days that be to almighty god most acceptable as be the
days of lent / of whom the church redeth. Ecce nu^c tempus acceptabile ecce
nunc dies salutis. This is the time acceptable / these be the days of health
and mercy / than for all penytentes the hole church makes special prayer
wherefore it is verily to be trusted that so true a turnynge to the love of god
/ despysynge this world / so fast an hope in prayer / so ferme a believe in the
sacraments of the church / and so devout a receyuynge of them / so many
holding up of his hands / so many lyftynge up of his eyes / so many betynges
and knockynges of his breast / so many syghes / so many teres / so many
callynges for mercy / by all that gracyous time / by all the hole lent / with
the help of the hole church than prayenge for him could not be in vain / for
the which as I said before / he thus departing made (I doubt not) a gracyous
end and conclusyon of his life which was the first part promised.

THe second part of this psalm I said should styre us to have compassyon and
pity upon this most noble king / and that for a lamentable and pyteous
complaynt following which rests in four points. First touching the
sorrows of death in his body. Second touching the dredes of his Jugement in
his soul. Third touching the miseryes of this world full of labor and
greuaunce. Fourth touching his sorrowful cry to god for help and socour. As
to the first it is said. Circu^dederu^t me dolores mortis. The sorrows of death
has enuyroned me. when we here a lamentable complaynt of any person that is
in sorrow or heaviness / if therebe in our hertes any gentylnes or pity it will
move us to co^passyon / though he were right simple and of poor and low degree
/ much rather if it were some noble man which of late had been in great
prosperyte / but most of all our lord and sovereign / that should perse our
hertes with sorrow to here him lamentably compain of any of his sorrowful
greuau^ces / and what can be more sorrowful and more paynful than be the pains
and sorrows of death. Mors oi^m ter ribilissima. Says Arystotle. And why is
death so ferefull: but for the grievous pains yt are in it / there is so great
an amyte between the soul and ye body / and so surely a Joined knotte and
bond / that dysseuerau^ce of them is to paynfull / which thing appeared well
in our savior christ Jhesu. where here remembrynge the nyghnesse of his death
complained him unto his apostles / saying. Tristis est ai^a mea vsque ad
morte^. And after for ye very dread of tho pains was in so great agony of body
and soul that he swette water and blood for the only remembrance / he than
that is wrapped in deed in ye very sorrows and pains of death / he feleth much
greuau^ce / specially if his body be delycate / and he of tender and sensyble
nature as was this noble king. Let us therefore tender his complaynt / saying
in this manner. Circu^dederu^t me dolores mortis. That is to say / the bitter
sorrows of death have envy toned me on every part / not only one sorrow / but
many sorrows. Dolores and many sorrows of death which is most paynfull.
Dolores mortis not touched hy^ or pynched him / but on every part has
assailed and oppres sed him. Circu^dederu^t me And yt no short while but by
long contynuau^ce by the space of. xxvii. hours to gyder / so long I
understood he lay co^tynually abidynge the sharp assautes of death / and
therefore he says pyteously co^ playnynge. Circu^dederu^t me dolores mortis
Secondly as touching his soul / in what agony suppose ye that was / not for
the dread of death only / but for ye dread of the Jugement of almighty god /
for all be it he might have great confydence / by the reason of his true
co^uersyon unto god / and by the sacraments of crystes church which he with
full great devotion had received before / yet was not he without a dread. Nemo
nouit an sit odio an amore dignus. There is no man be he ne uer so perfyte
oneles he have it by reuelacyon yt knows certainly wheder he be in the state
of grace or no / for of an other manner be the Jugementes of god than of men.
And the holy abbot Hely said likewise. Three things said he there be that I
much dread / one is what time my soul shall depart out of my body / an other
is when I shall be presented before my Juge / the third is what sentence he
shall give whether with me or against me. If these holy fa ders which had
forsaken this world and had lived so ver tuously were in this fere / no
marvel though this great man which had so much worldly besynes and daily
occupied in the causes thereof / no marvel though he were in great fere / and
thereof he complayneth saying. Et pericula inferni inuenerunt me. That is to
say / and the perils of hell did find me. Who that will not make his
remembrance famuler with them before / and often set them before the eye of
his soul / they shall at the hour of death in more terryble manner offer
themself unto his mind even as ye se these wood dogs these great mastyues
that be tied in chains / unto such as often vysyte them they be more gentle
and easy / but to the strangers which have none acquaintance of them they
ragyously and furyously gape and rise against them as they would devour them.
Et pericula inferni inueneru^t me. Thyrdly touchy^ge these worldly pleasures
wherein men set great part of their comfort both in body and soul / he had
than full little comfort or pleasure in them but rather dyscomforte and sorrow
/ all his goodly houses so rychely dekte and appareyled / his walls and
galaryes of great pleasure / his gardyns large and wide with knottes curyously
wrought / his orcheyardes set with vynes and trees most dyly cate / his
meruaylous richesse and treasour / his metes and dryn kes were they never so
dylycately p^pared might not than help hy^ / but rather were paynfull to hy^ /
so much yt long before his death his mete was to him so loathsome (were it
never so dilicately p^payred) that many a time he said / but only to follow
counsel he would not for all this world re ceyue it / wherein he well perceived
ye miseryes of this wretched world. Tha^ lo he had experience of that / yt
long time before ye great and wise Salamo^ reported in his book eccliastes.
Cu^que me conuertisse^ ad vniuersa opera q^ fe cera^t manus me and ad labores
i^ quiabus frustra sudauera^ vidi in oibus vanitate^ and afflictionem animi.
That is to say when I had turned my remembrance to all that I had ordained /
and to the labors wherein I swette in vain I found in them all but vanyte and
turmentry of soul. This co^clusyon our late king and sovereign full truly
than had learned and the vain trou bles and labors which many take for this
wretched world / wherein as I said full little pleasure than he had but much
displeasure and sorrow / wherefore it follows in his co^playnt. Tribulatione^
and dolore^ inueni The fourth percell of his complaynt is a lamentable cry
unto almighty god for help and socoure / for when he saw plainly that no
where else was any socoure or comfort / the cruel assautes of death was fyers
and sharp against him / the dangerous perils whether he should become was
importunely grievous / all this world and worldly pleasures were to him vnswete
and full dyspleasaunt therefore with all his might and power he cried upon the
name of our lord / for the which name is promised by saint Poule. Ois
quicu^que inuocauerit nomen dn^i saluus erit. That is whosoever call upon the
na me of our lord he shall be safe / he therefore full besyly / full studyously
/ full ernestly called upon that blessed name for socour and help / and so it
follows in the psalm. Et nomen dn^i inuocaui. O my blessed Ihesu / o my most
merciful Ihesu / o my lord and creatoure Ihesu. O dn^e libera anima^ mea^. O
my lord deliver my soul / de liver my soul from the myseryes of this world
/ deliver my soul from these deedly pains / deliver my soul from this
corruptyble body / deliver my soul from the bonds of sin / deliver my soul
from my mortal enemies / deliver my soul from the dangers of everlasting
death. O dn^e libera ai^am mea^. A my lords and masters let this pyteous and
lamentable co^playnt of him that of late was your king and sovereign / let it
enter and synke into your breasts. Scripture there unto does move you saying
this wise. Fili in mortuu^ produc lachrimas and quasi dira passus incipe
plorare. And in an other place thus. Supra mortuu^ plora defecit eni^ lux eius.
Example hereof we have of the gentyles. The cruel warryour Hanyball he pyteed
the death of his enemies Paulus / Enulius / Tiberius / Graceus / Marcus /
Marcellus. When he saw their bodies lie deed before him. And in holy letters
also king Dauyd when it was told unto him the death of his enemies at diverse
times he wept right pyteously as at the death of Saul / Absolon and Abner. If
they so great and noble men so much pyteed the death of their mortal enemies.
We should much rather tender and pity the death of our own king and sovereign.
But whereto rehearse I them when he that was the lord of all this world our
sauyoure christ Ihesu wept at the monument of Lazarus when he had been buried
the space of four days / gyuynge unto us all thereby example of pity. If he yt
was the king of all kings wept for the death of his subgecte so long after
his buryall / what should we that be subgectes do for the death of our king and
sovereign having yet the presence of his body unburied among us / forsothe
it should move us to have pity and compassyon the rather upon him. A king
Henry king Henry if thou were on live again many one that is here present now
would pretend a full great pity and tenderness upon the. It is remembered in
the book of the kings how a servant of king David whose name was Ethay when
his lord and sovereign was in trouble he would not forsake him / but answered
him plainly in this manner saying. In quocu^que loco fueres dn^e mi rex sieve i^
morte sieve i^ vita ibi erit seruus tuus. That is to say in what place soever
thou shalt be my lord my king in the same place shall thy servant be A
squire also of king Saul when he saw his lord and master deed his sorrow
was so great that he slew him self incontinent. Alas where is the true pity
and very compassyon become that should be in the hertes of men. These two
persons had so great ruthe and compassyon of their masters that they refused
not to suffer ye death with them How hard are our hertes / how stony / how
flynty. If we relent not with pity and compassyon / herynge so lamen table a
complaynt of our late sovereign / and herynge him so pyteously cry saying. O
dn^e libera ai^am mea^ O my lord deliver my soul. Let us help him at the
lest with our prayers besechynge almighty god for his infynyte mercy to deliver
his soul and to pardon it. And or we proceed any ferder of our psalm let us
here devoutly and affectually say for his soul and all christian souls every
of us one pater noster.

THe third part of this psalm entreats of comfort / which is contained
in. iiij. points. First yt almighty god is merciful / second yt he has
taken hy^ in to his custody / third yt he has delivered hy^ from al euylles
fourth yt hens for ward he shall continue in the gracyous favor of almighty
god. For the first it follows. Misericors dn^s and iustus et deus nr^
miseret^. That is to say. The lord is merciful and right wise and our god
will have pity / who is this lord that is merciful and right wise / who but
our savior christ Ihesu which of his infynyte mercy came into this world to
dye for sinners. Christus jesus venit in hu^c mu^du^ saluos facere pcto^res.
Why than says he. Et iustus. that he is right wise also / that rather should
make against the sinner than for him. Nay forsothe / the prophet and king
Dauyd brought in this word for himself and not against him. Two ways it
makes for the sinner / one by reason of promise made through out all scripture
unto the penytent that will utterly forsake his sin. Our lord yt is most
Just of his promise will pardon the sins so repenting himself and so
truly retournynge which thing saint John^ plainly witnesses in his first
epistle Si co^fiteamur peta^ nr^a fidelis and iustus est vt remittat nobis
peta^ nr^a and emundet nos ab om^i iniquitate. That is to say. If we will
knowledge our sins ye lord is faithful and Just in his promise to forgive
all our sins and make us clean from all wicked nes / this is one way.
Another way also it may make and that is this. Our savior Jhu^ is Justus /
for he is innocent and gyltles / and therefore he is a conuenyent mean / a
suffycyent vocate for us before the face of his fader according to the words
of the same saint John^. Si quis peccauerit aduocatu^ habemus apd' patre^ jesus
xp^m iustu^ and ipse est propiciatio pro pcti^s / no^ pro nr^is tm^ sed and
tocius mu^di. That is to say. If any of us have sinned / let us not despair /
for we have an advocate for us before god / our savior which is Just and
without sin / and he shall be a mean for our sins / not for ours all only
/ but for all ye worlds. Who may be thought a more conuenyent vocate for
sinners than he yt never did sin than he yt suffycyently has paid for ye
ransom of sin his own most precious blood and paynfull and bitter death
than he that is the sone of almighty god and that before his own fader. But
perauenture his fader is hard and strange and will not be moved. Nay forsothe
/ for rather the contrary / he is full pyteous and full ready to have mercy. And
therefore it follows. Et deus noster miseretur. And our god will have pity and
mercy. For the which saint Austyn says in his book depni^a. Quecu^que
necessit as pcto^rem ad penitencia^ cogit neque qua^titas criminis / nec
breuitas te^peris / nec enormitas sceleris / nec hoar extremitas / si pura
fuerit voluntatis mutacio excludit a venia. That is to say / what necessyte
soever compel the sinner to repentance / neither the gretnes of his sin nor
yet the shortness of time / nor the enormyte of his tres pass / ne yet the
uttermost hour of his life shall exclude him from pardon / if so be yt his
will be clearly changed and turned to god. This is than one great comfort
that our late king and sovereign may have / and all tho that bear him true
faith and service. The second comfort that he was taken in to the custodye of
our lord follows in the next verse. Custodie^s paruulos dominus humiliatus
sum et liberauit me. Who that is in thraldom of sin is in full shrewed
custody / and if he would be at lyberte he must do as these prisoners do that
sometime undermine the walls and crepe under them out at a strayte and narowe
hole. And so they escape out of the custody of prysone and come to their
lyberte / In like wise the sinner must do / he must undermine the strong
walls of sin by true humblynge and lowynge of himself / and make himself
little to the intent he may crepe out at the narowe hole from the danger of
sin and so come unto the lyberte of grace. For the which our savior said.
Nisi conuersi fueritis et efficiamini sicut paruuli. Onelesse ye be changed
and be made little ye can not enter to lyberte. Saint Anthony saw by
reuelacyon that all the world was full of snares / and he asked this questyon.
Blessed ^orde said he who shall pass these dangers. It was answered him Sola
humilitas. Only humblenes and lowlynesse. The king Achab of whom scripture
says that he did more dyspleasure unto god than all the kings of Israhell
that were before his time he did so great ydolatry / he slew so many
prophets / notwithstondynge so many wonderful tokens and miracles that were
showed unto him / yet at the last when the prophet Hely came to him in message
and thretened him fore in the name of god / he began to repent him / and to
humble himself in the sight of god / for the which inco^tynent almighty god
said unto the prophet Hely. No^ne vidisti humiliatu^ achab cora^ me: qr igit^
hu^iliatus e^ mei ea^ in induca^ malu^ in diebus eius. That is to say Did thou
not se Achab humbled before me / I tell the for that he because of me did so
humble himself I shall not do that evil that I purposed in his time to have
done. O synguler goodness and gentylnesse of almighty god. O meruaylous
redynesse of him unto pity and mercy. So soon as the sinner can humble and
make little himself / so soon he sets him at lyberte and takes him in to
his custodye and tuicyon / herefore gretely we may be gretely comforted in our
late king and sovereign / which so much humbled himself before his death
humbled him unto god / humbled him unto his co^fessout humbled him unto
penance / humbled him unto the sacrament of the auter / and to the other
sacraments / humbled him unto the crucifyxe / and with a more humblenes and
pacyence took this sickness and every thing in it than ever he did before to
the marvel of all that were about him / wherefore he now may say to our and
his comfort Custodiens puulos dn^s humiliatus su^et liberauit me That is to
say / our lord takes into his custodye the little and humble persons. I was
humbled and he set me at lyberte. The third comfort is that he is now at rest
and the myseryes of this world has escaped / what is in this life but
miserable vanyte / so he does witness that thereof had experyence at the full
/ he that had most haboundau^ce of all worldly pleasures I meant the king
Salamo^ which said. Canitas vanitatu^ and oi^a vanitas / quid habet ho^
amplius de labor suo qui laborat sub sole. That is to say vanyte of banytees
and all is but vanyte / what has any man more of all his labor and besynes
under the son. A my lords and masters that have this worldly wisdom that
study and enploy your wits to cast and compass this world what have ye of
all this besynes at the last but a little vanyte. The spyder craftily spynneth
her thredes and curyously weueth and Joyneth her web / but comes a little
blast of wind and dysapoynteth all together to the which purpose Cietro in his
third book be oratore makes this exclamacyon. O fallace^ hou^n spe^
fragile^que fortuna^ and inanes nr^as co^tentiones q^ medio in spacio sepe
frangunque et corruunt. That is to say. O deceytefull hope of men and bryttell
fortune and bayne enforsementes, which often break; and come to naught or ever
they have entered half their course / which thing wisely considering this
noble prince ordered himself thereafter / let call for his sone the king that
now is our go uernour and sovereign endued with all graces of god and nature
and with as great habylytees and lyklyhodes of well doing as ever was in king
/ whose begy^nynge is now ^o gracyous and so comfortable unto all his people /
that the ^eioysynge in him in manner shado weth the sorrow that else would have been taken for the death of his fader. He called (I say) unto him and gave him
faderly and godly exhortacion / co^myttynge unto him the laborous gouer nau^ce
of this realm / and gadery^ge his own soul in to the true rest co^fortynge
it and saying unto it. Co^uertere ai^a mea in requie^ tua^ quia dn^s bn^fecit
tibi. Be turned my soul in to thy rest / for thy lord has been benefycyall
unto the / benefycyal at every time before / but now specially by this most
gentle and merciful calling by so long respyte and space gyuy^ge of
repentance whereby he has escaped so many dangers / dangers of everlasting
death / dangers of everlasting teres and weeping / and dangers of falling
again to syn^e / for the first it is said. Quia eripuit anima^ mea^ a morte.
That is / for he has delivered my soul from death / both temporal and
everlasting dangers of everlasting weeping and sorrow / for the which ye
good fader Arsenius said unto his brethren Brethren said he / either we must
needs weep here with teres that will wasshe our souls / or else after this
with teres that will brenne both bodies and souls / from these teres also he
is delivered / and therefore it follows. Oculos meos a lachrimis. And mine eyes
from teres. Thyrdly from the dangers of falling to sin again. No man that
lives here can be assured not to fall. And therefore saint Poule says. Qui
stat videat ne cadat. He that stands let him beware that he slydeth not for
the way is slyppery / but tho that be hens departed in the state of grace be
assured never to fall again. And for that it follows. Et pedes meos a lapsu.
The fourth and the last porcyon of his comfort / which is to be assured of
contynuaunce in the favor of almighty go^ passes all the other. A great
comfort it is unto the sorrow full penytent that he has a merciful lord and
god. A great comfort also that he is taken in his tuicyon and custodye A
greter yet that he is delivered from so many euylles and perils. But the
gretest which surmounteth all other is to have the presence of that most
blessed countenance and to be assured ever to continue in that gracious favor
/ no tongue can express / no speech can declare / no heart can think / how
great / how far passing this comfort is. Si dece^ mill iehe^nias quis
dixerit says Crysostome Nichil tale est quale est ab illa bta^ visione
excidere and exosum esse a xp^o. If one would think the greef of. x. M. helles
/ all that is yet no thing like to be excluded from that blessed countenance
and to be hated of christ. If this greef be so excessyfe and far passing the
contrary thereof must needs be of as extreme comfort and Joye again / that is
to say to have the co^tynuall presence of that blessed sight / and to know
the assured favor and grace that he stands in for the which is said. Place
vo dn^o in regione viuorum. That is to say / I shall please my lord god in
the regyon and country of living persons / where as is the very life ever
continued without any interupcyon of death. Thus according to my pro myse at
the beginning I have perused this psalm in the person of this noble man /
deuydynge it in three parts in a co^mendacyon of him / in a mouynge of you to
have compassyon upon him / and in a comfortynge of you again The co^mendacyon
stood in four points / first in a very tournynge of his love to god / second
in a fast hope and confydence of prayer / third in a steadfast believe of the
sacraments and a devout receyuynge of them / fourth in a dylygent calling
for grace. The mouynge to compassyon stood also in. iiij. points / first for
the paynfull greuau^ces of death that he felt in his body / second for the
ferefull remembrance in his soul of the Jugement of god / third for the
miserable vanytees of this life wherein he found but pain and travail /
fourth for the lamentable cry to god for help and socour. The comfortynge
again was like wise in. iiij. points / first for that he has so merciful a
lord and god / second for that he is taken in to his tuicyon and custody /
third for that he is now delivered from so many perils / fourth for that he
shall from heus forward continue in the gracyous savor of almighty god the
which comfort he grant him yt for us all dyed upon the cross our savior
christ Jhesu. Amen.
