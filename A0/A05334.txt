With heart receive, with mind embrase:
This small work, though name be base.
The Reader may, with careful pain,
By perusing it, some profit gain.
Refuse not thou, which is thine own,
Thou reapest that, thou have not sown.
The Author holds it, double gain,

To the Right Honorable and my very good Lord the Lord Edward Seamour, Viscount
Beauchamp, Earl of Hertford. I. R. wishes long life, perfect health, increase
of honor, and endless Felicity.
THe chief and principal thing (right honorable) apertaining to every
honorable personage (which thing is good too see that your honor does well
consider) is to walk in the garden of humility: and the direct way to the
same, is to pass by the gate of virtue, whose fou^dacion is ankerd to the fear
and love of God: for as by the one is covered the multitude of sins, so by the
other is obtained blesednes, wysdo^, and knowledge, whose godly preseuera^ce
therein will (no dought) much multyply the great and blessed benefits of
almighty God, upon your honor and all your whole seed and posterity, Knowing
therefore (right honorable) the great love and affection which your honor ever
has and does bear to virtue and good letters, I was thereby moved the more
boldly after I had printed this work for the Lute divided into three books:
(the first an easey and plain method to set al songs of eight diverse tunes in
tablature for the lute, the second how to ha^del the lute, the third and last
co^teineth diverse excelent tunes) to dedycate the same to your honor, nothing
doutinge but that it shall most acceptably come into your favorable and sure
protection. I therefore most humbly beseech your honor too take this small gift
in good part, which coming as it were from your honor into the hands of many
shall (I dought not) do many good. God whose holy word your honor does most
fervently love and most ernesty practice in your daily conversation, mough^
vouchsafe to preserve your honor and your virtuous children in continual
health and daily increase of honor, unto the glory of his name.

Yours honors most humble at commandment. J. R.

To my very good Lady my Lady the Countess of Retz.
THe small present (right Honorable Lady) which I make unto you of this my
simple work, is not done for flattery respecting only your great calling,
according to the manner of most part of Authors now A days, but the virtue
and knowledge so manifestly apperinge in you above other Ladies of this our
time, does draw unto yt (as the adamant does Iron) the works that are of good
invention: chiefly from him, who is your servant by inheritance: having
before time served with all obedience the late Lord Dampierre your father
while he lived, in the room of captain of fifty men of arms, at ^utche time
as he was the Kings Lieutenant general at Ardes: where he died nobly in the
service of his majesty. Which I cannot remember without renewing the tears
that I did then let fall upon his body. For all that may be mine, must of
necessity be yours, by reason of my bounden service, although that bysyd^ my
duty in that behalf, I could not direct this my work any better, then to your
Ladyship, for the worthiness of your excellent knoweldge rare in your kind, rare
in our age. The which I esteem worthy to be compared with any of the most noble
Ladies that were of ancient time in Room, Mutia, Lelia, Cornelia, Aurelia. By
whose private teaching at home, sprang forth Hortensius, Julius Caesar and other
the most eloquent Orators of their time. But every good judgment will allow
me to prefer yours far above theirs, in asmutch as the Lattin tongue gotten by
your diligence, deserves more praise, then that which they had borne with
them, and as it were sucked out together with the milk of their nurses breast:
Eue^ as according to the mind of Cicero, that Knight deserves more
co^mendacio^, who has won fame by his own manly acts, the ^ee to whom it
comes by succession from others, as it does by race from the father to the
son. For this cause this book is by good reason presented unto you, as to a
Judge sufficient in all knowledge, containing an easy instruction of all the
Art of Music to be reduced in Tablature for the Lute. Which has no^ ben
heretofore communincated by the doctors of this science, making strange to
acquaint many with the secrets of there facculties. Now have I brought to
light and public knowledge this Musical method for the Lute to be the more
easily learned by eueri one by him self without any teacher, taking beginning at
the first grounds of the science, the^ exemplyfieng it by plain plaieng, and
after showing the more cunning, for which all theye that shall take any
pleasure or proffit by it, shall have to thanck you, as a thing proceeding from
you: which I desire your Ladyship to receive in good part at the hands of your
humble servant, who protests from henceforth to dedicat and consecrat to
your Excellency all the fruts which may spring out of the forge of his simple
wit, to be the better allowed of by the favor of your woorthynes.

Your humble servant, Adrian le Roy.

The Preface of Iacques Gohory. unto the courteous Reader.
THE affection which from my youth vpwardes (right Christian Reader) I have
borne to Music, above all other sciences, and to the instruments of the same,
was sufficient cause enough for me to have it in high price and estimation: but
the old familiarity which it has caused me to have with the Aucthor of this
present Book (as Poetri^ wrought between Lelius, and Terence) has provoked
me further to make this short discourse, and to direct it to you: The which
shall be as well of the worthiness of his person as of the cunning of his work,
and the singularity of the Lute, whereof the question is here. For as touching
him: besides his kno^ledge and dilig^^c^ both in Music used by voice, and
also upon instruments, all in general are greatly beholding unto him, for he
has reduced them into the best form that has be^^ hitherto seen, wherefore
by good reason, he has deserved to be taken for prince or chief. Now it is a
token of a person w^ll borne, that his spirit has been always so inclined to
Music, as being ^ compounded of proportion and temporatiue harmonicall: a
science so perfect, that i^ gives rejoicing to the heart, a great part of man's
felicity, that it appeaseth the troubles and passions of the mind, yea and by
the report of Aristotle in his politicques, that is able to reform and
establish the manners of a whole City. As touching the Lute, which without
doubt i^ holden for the most^ noble and melodious instrument of Music, I will
no further dilate the common praises thereof, but only by the great
singularity of agreement and disagreement which by (...) showed in it, in
this, that if one Lute be sounded near unto an other that is tuned in the same
tune: it is a strange thing and in a manner marvelous, that the stringes of
the other Lute will move at the sound and will shake not being at all touched,
by an effect of correspondence wonderful. Which the Poet Augurall in his
Chrisopeied: nor other Authors of secret Philos^phi^ have forgotten. But to
open to the reader, the matter and argument of this Book* containing an easy
and plain method to set all songs of the eight diverse tunes in Tabl^ture for
the Lute. The Author fears not to be reproved by the Masters of this Art for
having diclosed the mysteries of this Science, herebefore always kept hidden
in their bosoms without (...) it to others then to such as had spent many
years in their schools. In which he makes not so much conscience to profane
holy things, as it were to them that ^e not professed, at (...) common and
thereby more profitable, a treasure before hidden: deserving thereby no less
honor, then sometime Cuslauius: received for a like occasion at Ro^me, who
being clarke to Appi^^ the blind, published the fasts, and set them up in open
Tables: yea as Cicero says, the very style and form of actions: for the
which before men must ordinarily have go^ too (...) of his Master and certain
other who religiously kept them secret in a register: Wherefore the people being
not unthankful did recompense him worthily, making him first Tribu^e of the
people: and after Edile Curule. Like thanks ought they to give to Adrian le
Roy: which shall become good players on the Lute without further help: chiefly
those with being far from Cities and teachers, shall even so receive this
commodity to learn to set all songs upon the Lute, whereby they may obtain
the glorius title of A^ctodidactes such (...) Manilius the (...) ^omane, as
Plini witnesses: such as was that holy Doctor Aurelius Augustine, and within
our memory the well learned par^on William Bude. Now this author shall bring
that to pass i^ thi^ Art, which Picus Mirandula in his Book against
Astronomers, says that Abu^ba^ter the Hebrew did, teaching the manner by the
which every man by him self might become a Philisopher. For although that
Cicero writing to Trebatius, says that no Art nor Science can be learned
without a Master and Instructor, this may serve for answer to that, that
Books that (...) unto this, be true, though not speaking teachers, setting
forth the Science so lively, and easily, that they may well supply the default
of live speech: Here then will I end, after I have advertised you that all the
examples of this Book be taken and chosen out of Orland de Lassis, of whom I
will further witness this unto you in french agreeable to mine in Latin set to
the (...) of his last works not long ago put in print: that is to say, that
he is this day (without danger of offense to any man) esteemed the most
excellent Musician of this time, as well in grave matters, as mean and more
pleasant, a thing given from above to few other, in the which he has
attained not only the perfection of melody, but also a certain grace of sound
beyond all other* such as Appelles did account of Venus portrature: wherein he
has more then all other observed to fit the harmony to the matter, expressing
all parts of the passions thereof being the first that has eschewed bonds and
common holdinges of the letter by right placing of the sillabelles upon the
notes, and observing the accent in french and quantity in Latin: And if it be
permitted to every good ear to judge somewhat of Music as by Cicero it was
permitted to the people to judge of painting in which they have no skill: I do
protest unto you that if the songs of other Musicians do delight me, those of
Orland do ravish me, who also in his songs has often practiced experiments of
copy in variety of harmony upon one self sound of word, in such sort as we
(...) Vergill to have done in some Epigrams, and as it is told that Cicero used
with Roscius the player, to practice which of them could express one self
thing most diversely, the one with most variety of speech, the other with
most variety of gesture: Receive thou good Christian Reader this work of
Instruction with a cherefull countenance, favoring hereafter the author
thereof, to give him occasion to be able to furnish you often with more: and as
for me I have the first History of Titus Liuius to continue, being ^^goon long
ago, and also by way of rec^^ation, the ^3 Book of the Spanish Roman of
Amadis de Gaul, the which I would account my self happy to present to you,
if I might perceive they would be to your liking.

An Instruction to set all Music in Tablature for the Lute. The Preface of
the Author.
TO begin by that is first necessaryly to be understood, albeit I have
sufficiently treated of it in another book joined to this, which contains an
easy instruction to the plain Tabletur of the Lute, and the ordering of the
hand theruppon, the Reader must understand that the five lines represent the
five stringes of the Instrument, and the space last below the sixth or great
basse.

Mine intent is now to teach them that are desirous to play on the Lute, how
they may without great knowledge of Music set upon that instrument all
Ballets or songs, which they shall think good, so as they can only sing, vt,
re, my, fa, sol, la, and know the valuation or time of notes, without that that
it shall be needful for them any farther to wade for the knowledge of any
composition or concordes, that is to say, that it shall suffice them to know
that this note ^ called a sembrief, in the measure of two signified by this
figure ^ differring from the measure of three commonly called Triplee, is in
value two minims ^ and two minims are as much as four Cratchets, ^ four
Cratchets as much as eight quauers, ^ eight quauers as much as sixteen
semiquauers. ^ There rests no more to consider but the little mark which is
called a prick, which always is half as much in value as the note going
before. As touching Triplee ye must understand the like correspondence for the
value of the notes thereof.

To enter then into the ground of this present Art: all our Music consists
in eight tunes although Glarian and some other would divide them into a greater
number, as far as twelve. The first whereof as consequently of all the rest
we will treat of by rules and examples.

The first Chapter of the first Tune of Music.
FOR the first tune we will take for example the song of Orland de Lassus
beginning Quand mon mary vie^t de dehors, in which we must firstly set the
treble: the first note whereof being in gsolreut must be set on the second
string of the Lute open, that is to lay, so as the finger of the left hand do
not toutch upon that string: although we see in other tunes that the treble
open serves for Gsolreut, and sometime for Ffaut, as in the sixth tune. True it
is that such as be cunning in this Art, do dispose of them diversely at their
pleasure: but it is not to them that I direct my present work. Now of these
eight tunes there is made a difference of four called the Master or principal
tunes, that is to say, the first, the third, the fifth, the seventh, and of
four called their sequels or servants, which be the second, the fourth, the
sixth and the eight. Of these eight the first and second end in re, the third
and fourth in my, the fifth and sixth in fa, the seventh and eight in sol:
notwithstanding that there may be a changing or trasposition, as in the first
and second tune from Re of Gsolreut, and from Re of Dlasolre, and so in the
other of diverse My, Fa, sol. To return then to the discourse of the first
tune, we have to give a reason wherefore we have before ordered, that the second
string of the Lute open shall serve for Gsolreut, which is because this first
tune has his retche or compass a fourth or four notes higher then the
second* as contrariwise the second has his retch or compass a fourth lower.
So is it of the other six tunes, that every Mastertune has always his retch
or compass higher by a fourth and the sequeles or servant tunes, the base
likewise contrary. Now must be understood the cause why herebefore we have
laid for foundation, that in setting songs to the Lute, we proceed by
sembreues, Which is by occasion of ye nature and disposition of this
instrument, as it is likewise in that of y^ Uirginalles, but contrary in
Orga^s. For in Orga^s, the tune may hold a Maxim being as long as eight
sembreues, yea and longer by means of the wind continu^^ by the bellows. But
in the other two instruments their sound, which depends altogether by the
toutch of the fingers, cannot endure longer then a sembreue: if the string on
the one, or the key on the other, be not touched again by the hand: which is
the reason in consequence, that forces us when we set in Tablature, to divide
Maxims always in eight parts, Longes in four, Breues in two, and so forth of
other great notes which are augmented with pricks. Herein lies the reason for
the Etimologie of the word.

To omit nothing of the whole instruction of the Tablature of the Lute, I have
divised this foundacio^ to be thereunto necessary: that is to say, the manner
of music to set a song by setting forth the retch or compass of all the notes
in every one of the four parts, by examples of the first Tune in ye song Qand
mon mary vient de dehors, where I have set forth all the notes as far as they
did retch in the whole making of that song. In the which I have to advertise
you, that there is first to be seen, the letters of the tablature, aunswerable
to the note of the song, and the vnissons which may chance upon ye strings
of the Lute.

Also the reader shall find in the example of the Base, that in the first note
we were dryue^ to have recours to the eight above, as yt appears in the Retche
or compass: which must serve herafter for a general rule in all other songs
here given for examples: that is to wete, as well for refuge to the said eights,
as to the compass of the note. Which I would to be understood for all songs of
the first Tune, which are to be set on the Lute: in which it cannot be often
found that they excede this compass above one note higher or lower. And so
shall it be presupposed of the other Tunes following, and likewise of the
compass of them. Here I will not forgette to tell that the learner of this
Art, may not fail after he has set out his Treble in Tablature to tell
diligently all the measures of the same, for fear of this Inconvenience, which
chances oftentimes, yea to the most expert for Lack of this diligence, to
goo over and begin again the work now already half done, for that there
may happen to much or to littell: so as if the foundation be not good, all
that is Laid upon must needs goo to ruin.

TO begin the example to set, first you must know, that this mark ^ like
unto a C, with a strike through, signifies the measure to be by the number of
two, which having no strike, betokens double measure, which the Italians
call the black note: because that in that kind of song, there are used many
quauers yea, and sem^e quauers, which hapen very seldom in the measure of
two, as the Battle, Caquet des femmes, chant des oyseaux, and such other
songs of Clement Ianequin. Now as touching the first drafte of this example,
you see there the first note, a, to be in value a Minim, the second.d, in
value a cratchet with the other next followyng, which is of the same value the
former is, although it be not marked upon: in which matter you shall know
that this mark ^ is in value ^ this ^ in value ^ this ^ in value ^ this ^ in
value ^ and this last ^ in value ^. As for the pricks where soever they
chance, they increase the value of the note next before, by the one half, as
it has been showed here before in the notes of Music. As to the first
measure of the song of Orlande, we must make the distaunce large enough (as it
is to be observed in all the rest) because there may chance many Cratchettes
or Quauers, in some other parts of the song, besides those of the treble:
which as you se we do here place first. For this cause the two distances,
the fifte and the sixte be seen void, because of the restes of the treble
there. Also in the seventh distaunce, you see the first mark to be in value
a Minim, which having no letter underneath, signifies there a Minim rest. The
two strikes marked with pricks after the fiftenth distaunce, do signify
that you must repeat the line endyng there. In the distaunce next after the
same strikes, after the rest, there is marked but the half of the value of
the sembrieue standing between both, which is notwithstanding, marked whole
in the song or Music: because that the string being stricken once, does hold
the sound of the sembrieue: as it happens also sometime of a Minim standing
so between both. You must also mark, that at the repetition showed before,
you must begin at the second distaunce, noted with the mark to begin again
^* and not at the first distaunce which must be likewise at all times
hereafter observed, when so ever ye shall see that mark. Note also that the
double strike, next the strike of repetition, does signify that, that which
is enclosed between them, must be left out in the plaiyng forth of the song,
after the repetition of the first part of the same.

AFter the mark of repetition, in the twelfth and eightenth distaunce, there
be two marks ^, without any letter underneath in Tablature, which signifies
so many half restes, ^, in the Music. In the last distaunce being the end
of the treble, is the letter, a, alone, which tarieth for the end of the
other parts: repeatyng the last words of the song. And this same self
letter, a, shall continue still to sustain, and accompany the other parts to
the end, as long as they shall hold out. In which must be noted and observed
that in setting, the end of any song must never be closed, till all the
parts be joined together: for so much as sometime the treble holds the
note, and sometime some other of the parts.

NOw it is conueniente for us to declare the orderyng of the neck of the Lute,
to wete, the vt, re, my, fa, sol, la, upon the strings, and of the tunes upon
the stops. There be ordinarily eight stops in number: whereof every one
contains but half a tune or note: and any stryng open has his first tune
or note whole, so every other note does take two stops: being none other
difference, but of half a note from one stop to an other next, which is a
thing necessary to be understood for this present work, to set in
Tablature. Also that from the great Base, being open to the second^ Base,
called the first stryng, are four notes, from the first stryng to the
fowerth, are four notes, from the fowerth to the third, three notes, from the
third to the second, four notes, and from that to the Treble, are also four
notes.

NOw as touching whole notes, and half notes, whereof we began to speak, it
is to be noted, that the change, ^ commonly called b. sharp or square,
altogether differryng from b. flat, in that b. sharp does hold up the ^une
half a note higher, and b. flat, contrariwise does let it fall half a
note lower, which change is necessary to be known in every descente of
Music (this must be understood of the Treble) albeit they do not use to
mark them, in many sorts of song, saving in this as well in the Treble, as in
the other parts. Which descente must be understood, to be like unto the
Treble, in what tune so ever it be found. And if the learner of this art
should not well understand, that the change into b. sharp in the descente,
does fall upon the last note save one, he shall know it evidently by the
mark, which I will not forget to set throughout all mine examples. But he
must also know, that the change into b. sharp, may chance in any there
place, then upon descentes. Also there rests to consider, that in the vt, re,
my, fa, sol, la, my toward fa, does bear but half a note, nor fa, toward
my, that is to say, as well in going upward, as coming dounwarde, but both
these in all other respects, and also all other notes do bear a whole note.
Also every note takes two stops upon the neck of the Lute, and the half
note one stop only: but.A. has been put and set forth for a mark,
betokenyng a whole note upon every stryng opon, then B. in the first stop in
the top of the neck, a half note.C. an other half note in the second
stop.D. in the third.E. in the fowerth.F. in the fifte.G. in the sixte.H. in
the seventh.I. in the eight: which be the number of the stoppes, most
accustomed upon the neck of this instrumente, notwithstanding, that they do
not let to go further toward the knotte upon the bealie of the Lute, by the
guidyng and judgment of the ear.

Having understood the manner how to set the Treble in Tablature, we must now
in proceadyng, se to the other parts, beginning at the high Tenor, called in
Latin Contratenor* which is next to the highest, or Treble: whereof here
follows the example.

The ioynyng of the Treble with the Countertenour.
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^



Upon this beginning of ioynyng the Treble with the Countertenour in Tablature,
is to be noted the excellency of the Lute above the Uirginalles, in the first
accord of this song, in that the.F. there does furnishe the vnisson,
fillyng so much the more the Harmony. In which accord, and the next
followyng, because the Treble occupies the place of the Countertenour: we were
forced to set the.F. upon the third stryng, where the vnisson of the.A. of the
second stryng is. You must mark that in the eight distaunce in the Treble
part, as it was first set out alone, there were marked two Minims: but in
this second example, wherein is added the Countertenour, we have been driven
to change those two Minims into four Cratchettes, because of the aunsweryng
of the prick, and the three Cratchettes, which meet there in the
Countertenour: and yet nevertheless, the two Minims keep their part still in
the instrument. And in the thirtene distaunce, ye may see two Minims first
together, that is to say, both of the Treble and Countertenour, but the
second Minim of the Treble, which was in the first example single, in this
(which is as it were a second or double example) is necessarily converted
into a Cratchet, because of the prick, and the Cratchet of the Countertenour.
Here must be noted, that where soever there chances a prick, it shall be
always best for the easiness of the Tablature, to turn that prick into
the figure of the note of his Tune or value, to answer to the other notes, of
the parts coming together: as is to be perceived that I have used in all this
book. Likewise in the last note.A. of the Treble (which is in this example
double of two parts) marked in the two distaunces, the last save one, and
the last, because) as it has been told already) of holdyng the end, the
Semibreue is of necessity turned into Cratchettes.

Examples of three parts.
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^



TO treat now in this example of the Tenor, as of the third part, we must
first tell you, that where you see but two parts in the Tablature, that
betokens so many restes in the Music of the Tenor: which begins to fill
with the rest in the fowerth distaunce, where you see, that besides the
sembrieues of the Treble, and Countertenour, you must set a Minim, and two
Cratchettes, because of the Tenor, that is to say, in the figure of setting
in Tablature although that in the truth of plaiyng, by the touching of the
finger, the Sembrieue remain always whole, both here and in all other like
places, as it has been before declared in the parts, as they were set out
severally: and note that the two distaunces, fifte and sixte, which were
before void, are here filled by the coming in of the Tenor: as the next
space followyng, is perceived to be filled with a Minim by the Tenor,
although in effect upon the Lute, he holds the time of a whole Sembrieue,
Here, nor at any time hereafter in plaiyng, is to be forgotten the skip, or
leauyng out, which must always be made of the notes between the two bars,
and the place of repetition.

The ioynyng of four parts together.
Quand mon mary. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^



IN these four parts of Music now joined together in Tablature, this is to
be considered upon the fowerth distaunce, where the Base does begin to come
into the other parts, that although we see there but three letters, which
can represent to the sight but three parts, yet in effect the^ be taken for
four parts: for so much as the first note of the Base beginning, is in an
vnisson with the Tenor. True it is, that there might be an.H. put on the
great Base, or last stryng (which makes an v^isson with the present.C. but
it is let pass in this, and all other like places, to make the play more
easy, and to avoid much strain^ng of the hand.

The former song finely handeled.
^ ^Quand mon mary. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^



Of the transposition of the first Tune.
THere rests for the clear endyng of this first Tune, to beat a word or
two of the transposition of this first Tune, which shall serve for a general
rule to all other Tunes followyng: that is to say, always from.b. sharp,
to.b. flatt. The first in distaunce of a fowerth, the second of a fifte. The
third of a fowerth. The fowerth of a fowerth. The fifte a fowerth. The sixte
of a fifte. The seventh of a fifte. The eight of a fowerth.

TO make this work in all poinctes parfite, and to show you (as a man might
say) not only the plain and rude Gramme^, but also further somewhat like to
the eloquence of Rhetorike, I have thought good in this place of the first Tune
^to croune as i^ were the work withal) to add an example of the same song,
adorned with runnyng poinctes and passages, as we will likewise do in the
example of every song, given for example: to the intent the scholar may
learn to deck other songs or daunses, with like flowers and ornaments: in
which he shall be forced sometime, for the better grace and pleasyng of ^he
ear, to leave out some one note of the accord, of some one of the parts: not
so much for all that for necessity, as for the pleasantness of the sound:
yea, and that with fall recompense of the lack of the note, which shall be
omitted, by the puttyng to of a runnyng poinct or passage, wherein lies all
the cunnyng.

IN this example of Trasposition, we must consider once for all, that although
the end of this song of Aacadet (of which always the judgment is made)
does fall and end in Dlasolre, it is nevertheless, taken for like to the
former example of Orlande, which ends in Gsolreut. Also we make no
difference of Tune* but make him end vpopn the Lute, on the same second
stryng open. There remains to prescribe, or observe in setting, that as often
as there is one, two, or mo restes in any song, as in the first distaunce of
the Treble of this present, that you begin always to set in Tablature, the
mark of the Semibreue, because it shall be easy for you, if there happen any
shorter measure in any of the other parts, to convert that mark of Semibreue,
into a Minim, Cratchet, or Quauer.

The ioynyng of two parts together: Treble, and Countertenour.
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^



IT is needful to take heed to the fowerth distaunce of this example, of two
parts: that is to say, of the Treble with the Countertenour: that naturally
the.F. which you see there, was an.A. in Semibreue (as it is to be see. ^ in
the former example of the single Treble) which it behooves us to change, by
reason of the Countertenour coming to that place, which mounteth a third
higher then the Treble, in the last half of the Semibreue: albeit the A. might
have remained for this first half, but so had the other half lost his Tune.
For this cause it was necessary, to go down from the second stryng, to the
third, tournyng the.A. into.F. (which is his vnisson upon the Lute) which
shall maintain the sound of the Semibreue whole: a thing necessary to be
observed in all other like haps, that as often as the proper and natural place
of the one part, shall be occupied by an other, you must of necessity have
recourse to an other stryng, that makes the vnission with that, for the
understanding of which vnissons thoroughly, we will here underneath by way of
example, give you a general collection of all the vnisson, which may be
found on the neck, or beallie of the Lute.

A generality of vnissons.
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^



IN this example of three par^e^, we will (...) particulerly all the
distaunces, in which the parts meet (...) an other, with (...) of the notes:
as the Treble being a Semibreue, the Countertenour (...) Cratchettes and
Qa^ers: In which we have to prescribe (...) a general rule, that as often as
that happen^th, the notes of each part, one after the other, which were set
(...) in their natural order (as you have been (...) before) must be
changed and converted in all four pa^tes se^e^ally: sometime it chaunseth,
that the Countertenour has a Semibreue, where the Treble against him has
Minims, and so likewise of the other two parts, which may happen in all
diversities of value.

The second Chapter of the second Tune.
THis second Tune, which is called follower, or servant to the first master
Tune, because he has his reche or compass a fowerth lower, therefore it
behooved us to set him so much the higher, that is to say, in the Treble open
which shall serve for Gsolreut, where it was in the second stryng open in the
first Tune. In this example of the Treble, I have to advertise you upon the
fowerth distaunce, in which ye se a mark of the value of a Minim, without any
other letter in the Tablature under it, that the same proceeds because of the
prick, which is in the Music joined to a Semibreue of the third distauce:
and that following a rule, which we have given you before, that the Lute strike^
out once, could not hold the sound above the time of one semibreue: which must
be understood for the perfection of the more greater harmony: albeit that
the sound of the stryng, might partly endure the value of a prick added, or
of the half more, but the sound toward the end is always naturally of less
force, as the second sound of an Echo in his doubling. So may the prick of
the Semibreue (as it shall like him that sets, be left out from being marked
with any letter in Tablature, or else be marked by the discretion, and judgment
of the ear. For it is certain that the sound is more strong, and of longer
tariyng, according to the goodness of the Lute.

IN this example of the Countertenour joined to the Treble, in the first
distaunce, there is an.F. twice upon the second stryng, which had their
natural place in the Treble, where a learner smally exercised might have
placed them. But because the.H. which must be in the place of.C. of the
Treble, the placyng of the two.FF. did come to better purpose, for the art and
grace of the plaiyng. Also because these two, A.A. had done wrong to occupy
the place and tune of the.F. of the Treble which is in value a Minim and a
prick, which must be observed generally in every like hap, upon what stryng
so ever it be: which thing often use in setting diverse songs, will teach
sufficiently.

^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^



HEre where three parts are joined together, we have to declare that in the
fowerth distaunce, in setting after the^ common sort, there is.B. and.D. on
the second and third strings, in the first Minim, which if it should stand
^o would bring an inconvenience in the prick.B whose sound would be lost, in
going to the next stop. To prevent which, we will amend them otherwise, in
the example of four parts together hereafter, tournyng the.B. here into.G.
upon the third stryng (which is his vnisson) likewise the.D. into.H. upon the
fowerth stryng* which being so brought to perfection* shall be in that order
also more easy for the hand: besides the necessity it has by reason of the
stop of the next distaunce, of which also the two.D.D* of the third stryng
be to be changed into as many.H.H. upon the fowerth stryng. These be things
that happen often, so as to declare every one, it were almost infinite, if the
judgment of the learner of this art, should not supply it by reason, as well
having regard to the grace in plaiyng, as the ease and commodity of the
hand. So I omit in this example to go over again many distaunces of like
sort, reseruyng the correction, for the next example* where four parts are
joined together.

IN this present song of Orlande of the second Tune, beginning, Ie l'aame
bien, which you may see here of four parts set in Tablature, all the
distaunces which I had left in the former example of three parts, only in
their natural and gross order, here I will deliver them unto you, brought
into a more artificial sort: so that you do understand, that the first
manner is always necessary to begin to set in Tabloture, because in setting
(as we have showed you in all the former examples) one part after the other,
we do not see at the first, the best form every stop is to be brought into.
We know well that the same might be practiced in an other sort, that is to
say, to set first the Music in measures, assemblyng all the parts together
one over the other, whereby there could be none occasion to race out, but then
ye must after do as much to bring the same into Tablature for the instrumente,
which would be two labors for one, because that in our fashion, we shall
as soon have set it in Tablature, as in the other ye shall only have done the
Music.

Of the transposition, or alteration of the second Tune.
IN this song of Orlande of the second Tune transposed, beginning un deux
Nennin, I have to advertise the reader, that he do not trouble himself, for
that he sees not the last note to fall in Dlasol upon the Treble open, as it
has been prescribed here before, because it is so, by reason of the drafte of
the last end, procedyng of the pleasure of the master Musician, being
disposed as it were, to pass a carriere: although those that be expert, do
know evidently this Tune, by the continuance of his other descentes.

difference, as touching the letters of the Tablature, but only in the notes,
for the first note of this song, which begins in Alamire is taken for D

but as concerning the Tablature, he does not change his place.

IN the present song given for example of Transposition of the second Tune,
in the.F. which is the second Minim of the twenteth distaunce, we have to
consider the lost Tune of the eight, of the.F. below, which happens often
in our plain ordinary Lutes, which be but of eleven strings, and might
easily be remedied by setting the song one note or two higher, but it would
be harder for the hand, and the grace of the play would be woorsser. Truth
it is, that it were possible to supply that lack upon our plain Lutes, by
setting the base a note lower, but that would make the play a great deal
harder, because it would cause a change of all the letters of the great Base.
The Lutes of the new invention with thirtene strings, be not subject to
this inconvenience, whereof the last is put be low: which according to the
manner now adays, is thereby augmented a whole fowerth: where here before it
was used only to supply the lack of this one note, whereof we speak now. I
will not here forget to tell you, that cunnyng Masters (to give remedy to
this defecte) heighten their play upon the Tablature, as many notes as they
think good. Here rests yet to consider upon that we have spoken of before,
concerning the prick, how it is to be kept with his note: notwithstanding in
the.83. distaunce of this example, we be constrained to lose him, by reason of
the Tunes, which mingle and pass one among an other: which also may be
found in some other distaunces followyng.

The third Chapter, of the third Tune.
THis third Tune is one of the four master Tunes, which ends in my, as
the fowerth also his servant or follower does, of the transposition of which
Tune, I will give you none example, being therein no new difficulty to
declare, besides that I have said before. Also because these two Tunes, be
less used then the other, seruyng only for Melancholy and doolefull matters.
Seeing this song to end in A. of the second stryng, a man might take it to
be his proper and natural Tune, although there do happen a change into B.
sharp, for a grace (which is a third higher) but yet it is to be known by
the other parts, coming together in the natural falling of the third Tune,
which nevertheless ends upon the same stryng: by this that in the first,
the A. upon the second makes re, and in the third serves for my, It is true
that in this example I have set the Tablature one note lower then ordinary,
for the ease of the hand, having also regard, that the Music was kept
altogether as it ought, which is a thing much to be considered in setting,
if it may be done, that there be nothing drouned of any of the parts.

explain hard points, which shall chance in any of the Tunes followyng,

be needful, either in the transposition of the Tune, or in any other accidente.

The fowerth Chapter. Of the fowerth Tune.
IN this fowerth Tune, of the which I give you for example, the song of
Orlande, beginning Du corpse absent, a man ^ight think it strange that this
Tune, which followyng the order of the rest, ought as a follower or servant
to be set ^ower notes higher then the third Tune, his master before, but
we be constrained to set him only but one note higher, by reason that this
present song, does go but one note lower then his master: together with that
it agrees better with the natural Tune of the Lute, which in this sort is
handeled with more ease and perfection.

IN the 23. distaunce of this song, Du corpse absent, we have to show the
reader, that in place of an.F. in the last Minim of that measure, in the
second example of the same song, garnished with runnyng poinctes, ye shall
find the same.F. changed into.D. with a double passage, keeping the fall,
which was corrupted in.F. nevertheless the Tune self of the same.F is found
in the same compainie, and eight of the great fifth stryng: which reason could
not be in Lutes, tuned after the manner of Fabrice Dentice the Italian, and of
other his followers. Where those strings that stand two and two together,
be set in one Tune, and not by eightes, which they do for a perfection of
harmony, in auoydyng many vnissons, which those eight would cause. In the.27.
distaunce likewise it will be to be considered, that the letters which be set,
according to their natural order upon the last Minim (making the accord of
Music) do bring a hardness of play, beyond the power of the hand, in the
greater sort of Lutes, although upon less instruments, or to a very great
hand well exercised, it might be possible. For this cause our scholar, which
will not content himself of this plain and naked Tablature, may have
recourse to the same distaunce in the Tablature followyng, where he shall find
the same accordin his perfection, notwithstanding the chaungyng of letters.

The fifte Chapter of the fifte Tune.
IN this example of the song of Orlande of the fifte Tune, beginning, Trop
endurer, we must declare, that the play is much constrained, and the hand
forced, and the notes of the same all contrary to ordinary, because that
the.C. whche for the most part in other Tunes serves for my, here serves
for sol, and so consequently of the other letters. For this cause I have put an
other song after this of the same Tune, a note lower, to show the easines of
the one, in respect of the other. Notwithstanding, the constrainte is so much
the more perfect, because of the loss of some note in the Base of the other.
It remains to show here, that in the 64 distaunce, the prick of the Minim
of the Base is there lost, and it cannot be done otherwise, but by the
florishyng of them that be cunnyng, as may be seen in the second Tablature of
the same song.

IN the example, which we give for the more easy of the fifte Tune, in the
song of Orlande beginning Vray dieu disoi^* in the 34, distaunce, there is a
place in the Tenor followyng the Music, in the which there is found a
great difficulty, and strainyng of the hand, so as it cannot be played,
without taking the hand of, which causes the sound of the other parts to
cease, which is one of the greateste faults and inconvenience that can
happen to the plaier on the Lute, which error the common sort for the most
part do fall into, except such as be excellent doers in this art,
wherefore it is better to make that place all plain, without taking of the
hand, although it be marked double in the Music: because so there is nothing
lost of the perfection, seeing it is not doubled, but for pleasure and joy of
the heart, more then for any occasion of the accord, or of the harmony: So
shall you find how to use this place in the example followyng, more cunnyngly

The sixth Chapter of the sixth Tune.
THis sixth Tune, which is servant or suffrigan of the first Tune before,
has his compass or reche a fowerth lower, then his master in Music, as
also all the rest of the folowers have. Of which Tune I give you here for
example, the Song of Orland, beginning, En vu lieu ou l'on ne voit goutte,
which ends in Ffaut, to the which the great Base of the Lute serves open,
notwithstanding, that in many of the other Tunes, it serves for Gsolreut, and
for other also, whereof I will not make you a certain rule, and special
determination, because the same passes by the discrecion of the master, who to
make himself sport in his play, or to join with some other Instruments,
whereof he would make a noise, does set him high or low, without making any
scruple for the losyng sometime of some little note. We will not repete here
the rule for Tripler, whereof this song is full in many places, that there
three must be observed for two under one measure, because we have
sufficiently declared it in former Chapiters. The scholar may not thinste it
strange, if while the Treple dure, he finds but Minims marked in the
Tablature in stead of Semibreues. The reason is, for that where there should
be so many Breues, they must be stricken twice, which were but a foolish
manner. For we have already told, that a good Lute will hold his sound, as
long as a Semibreue, and his prick, and the Brief in Triple is no more in
valewe, wherefore to make plain this hardness, I have marked the Semibreues
into Minims, which for all that, shall go no faster nor slower, then if they
were Semibreues, being no difference nor perfection, more in the one, then in
the other.

The seventh Chapter of the seventh Tune.
WE will frame an example in Tablature, for this seventh master Tune, upon the
song of Orlande, beginning Ie ne veux rien q'un baiser de sa bouche. Which to
them that should be ouermuche scrupulous for the loss of certain notes
(which notwithstanding, do recompense them selves upon the eightes, as it is
to be seen in the end of this song) such would set it two notes higher,
to save those notes: but they would because of great difficulty, much
vnpleasauntnesse, and constrainte, so that we think it better to leave it in
his natural Tune, then to change it otherwise. Because that this Tune of his
ordinary property, is not accustomed to extend to those two lost notes, so
low as the Musician would here for the poursuite and excellency of his
pastyme. Now is there in this song present, many things worthy to be noted,
in certain distaunces of the same, albeit that in the example better poolished
followyng, there is remedy to be perceived for all the difficulties, but the
reader could not perceive them, because the knowledge could not be had but in
the setting. The first is in the seventh space, where the highest C. must hold
a whole Semibreue for the Countertenour, if the division in the Treble did not
take away one quauer from him which thou shall find the means to save unto
him in the.22. distaunce following. In the.16. distaunce there is a runnyng
point which is made to observe the letters with the Music: whereby both the
Tenor and the Base be let, wherefore it is better there to make that
point all plain, then so much to hinder those two parts, although it be
not to be seen so in this distaunce (already by me amended there) as it is
set out in the Music. In the.31* distaunce is last the prick of the
Countertenor in the beginning of the measure, where there is place to have set
him, but we have told before that the prick is not stricken, wherefore it is
better left out then stricken again. In the.65. distaunce, the second Minim
leeseth half his valor, by reason of a Cratchet in the Treble, and cannot be
otherwise done, for the constrain of the other parts.

The eight Chapter, of the eight Tune.
OF this eight and last Tune (after the common use) servant or follower of
that before, we give you for example the song of Orland beginning, Ce faux
amor. which takes his Tune natural, that is to say, his Gsolreut in the
Treble open, wherein you shall find no difficulty for the Tablature, which
has not been declared in the Chapiters before, and which the learner of the
Art has not sufficiently learned, if he have practiced all the songs and
examples of the Tunes before set forth.

An accessarie or incident.
WE do yet further present here unto you one song, by way of accessory,
which is of Orlande, beginning Las voulez vous qu'une person chante.
Although it might seem superfluous to put it in Tablature, to them that would
in this follow the common opinion, which place is under the second Tune, but
to many it seems otherwise. For so much as this Tune, of the which there be
found sondrie songs and ballettes, does end in Alamire, without
transposition, and being transposed in Dlasolre, by b. sharp. In this example
here set forth unto you, there is seen in the 13. distaunce (which has
been often seen in some other of the former examples) that is to say the last
half of the Minime of the Base, by reason of the coming of a certain passage
trauersyng, as it is ordinarily found in all Music. In the.35. distaunce
there is found a like difficulty in that, that of necessity, the half of
the last Minim must be lost of the Treble, or of the Countertenour. But the
best is to leave out the last Cratchette of the Countertenour, which is
cause of this trouble, as you may see that I have left him out in the second
Tablature of the same song, more cunnyngly set forth. In the.82. distaunce is
lost the prick of the first Minim of the Base, but the place of this prick
is void, which I will acco^mpt a fault to strike again, as ye shall perceive
by the last handlyng of this present song, that is to say, that in place of
the accord on high, we have put him in the eight beneath. For end and
conclusion of this work, we have none other thing to hold you with, but
that it has not been by negligence, or not taking heed, that we have not
added yet more examples of songs and ballettes of three, five, six, seven,
and eight parts. But I have done it by reason, that who shall be diligently
exercised in the Tablature of four parts only: which I have set forth in
this book, shall not find any new difficulty, in that he would set mo
parts: that is to say, that there is no further thing to be considered and
observed, but the rules largely set forth and desciphered by our Chapiters, as
above all, the change and alteration of the value of notes of one part, in
the coming in and ioynyng with the other parts Also that there must be
excused some leauyng out of accordes, sometime for the necessity of the
bearyng of the instrument, which is not for all that, to condemn the Lute
alone of imperfection: the Harp, Uirginals, and other made of like harmony,
having all need of like excuse.

The nineth Chapter.
TO put the last hand to this work, I will not omit to give you to
understand, how to know stringes, whereof the best come to us out of
Almaigne, on this side the town of Munit, and from Aquila in Italy: before ye
put them on the Lute, it is needful to prove them between the hands, in
manner as is set forth in figures hereafter pictured, which show manifestly
on the finger, and to the eye, the difference from the true with the false:
that is to wete, the true is known by this that in strikyng him between the
fingers, he must show to divide himself just in two, and that for so much
as shall reche from the bridge below, to the top of the neck: because it
makes no matter for the rest of the strings, that goes among the pinnes,
notwithstanding ye may not be satisfied in assaiyng the string, holden only
at that length, but that you must also prove him mistrikyng him, being holden
at shorter lengthes to be well assured of his certain goodness and perfection.
Also the false stryng is known by the show of many strings, which it
represents, when it is stricken between the fingers: so must you continewe
the same trial in strikyng the stryng, till you perceive the token of the good,
to separate him from the ^adde, according to the figures followyng.

A good stryng.


A false stryng.


A brief instruction how to play on the Lute by Tablatorie, with certain
easy lessons for the purpose: gathered together: to the great commodity and
pleasure of the learner of the same. By A.R*


The first Rule.
First thou must understand, that the Lute is commonly strung with six
strings, I say six strings, although there be eleven because the five
first, accoumptyng from the Base, be doubled, which make ten, and the Treble
is only single and alone, which makes the eleventh, as thou may perceive
by the figure of the Lute, which I have here represented unto thee.

The second Rule.
These six strings be figured by five straight lines, of the which, the
first do^oth signify the highest stryng, called the Treble, the second line
is the second stryng, and so consequently all the other unto the sixth, the
which sixth line, is not noted in our French Tablature, because it may easily
be judged to be the last.

Treble. Small mean. Great mean. Countertenour. Tenor. Base.
The third Rule.
And because these six cords be not sufficient of them selves, to express
many and diverse soundes, it is necessary to find means, whereby every
stryng may give many and diverse soundes, and the means and way thereof, is
the invention of the frettes, which thou see about the neck of the Lute
here figured.



FOr to speak of the frettes, I will not here declare the proportions, that
ought to be observed, to say, the space or distaunce betwixt frette and
frette, which we do call stoppes, for to compass them justly, nor the
greatness of the frette strings, which must be also observed, these things
shall be declared an other time, thou shalt content thy self, to mark what I
will now say unto thee.

The fowerth Rule.
WE call the frettes, the stringes that be tied about the neck of the Lute,
which be ordinarily eight in nom^er, represented and figured by the
letters.b.c.d.e.f.g.h.i. and be called stoppes, because that whereas those
said letters be found, followyng the order of our Tablatorie, the spaces
betwixt the frettes must be stopped with the left hand. In the French
Tablatorie is used the letters of the Alphabet, and the Italians and other
nations, in stead thereof, use Sciphers and other Carecters.

The fifte Rule.
THe first stop is signified and marked by the letter b. the second.c and so
consequently the rest, unto the eight and last stop, with the letter.i. As thou
may see by the figure of the Lute, which I have before represented unto
thee.

The sixte Rule.
AS touching this letter.a. we have not comprised it among the number of the
eight stoppes, because that where the said a. is found, it must be stricken
open, that is to say, you must strike or gripe as many strings, as there be
marked A^^ with the right hand, not stoppyng with the left.

Example.

^

The seventh Rule.
AS for the letters that come after the.I. (which we have set last) they have
no frettes, notwithstanding those that be exercised in the same art, stop the
strings justly, where they should be stopped, that is to say, where the
letters be marked, which be ever above the number of eight, as cunnyngly as
if they had frettes.

Example.

^

Having now spoken of the strings, letters, frettes, and stoppes, thou must
also understand, how, and with which fingers the strings of the Lute must be
stopped.

The eight Rule.
NOw seeing the letters do signify the stoppes (the which do only
appertain to the left hand) if you should not strike the said strings
beneth on the beallie, the Lute would give no sound: you must with the thombe,
and the fingers of the right hand, gripe or strike as many strings, as
shall be found letters marked in the lines, signifiyng the said strings* I
mean, that shall be one above an other in the same stop: and if there be but
one letter, you must stop but one stryng, if there be two, you must only
stop two, and so consequently to the number of six, which makes six
parts in one stop, because every letter does his part, and there must be
two letters at the least, one above the other, to make the accord.

Example.

^

The nineth Rule.
WHereas thou do find but one letter to be stopped, thou shalt strike him
dounewarde with thy thombe, be it first, second, or other, the stryng
signified by the line of the Tablatorie, upon the same line that the letter
stands on, so that there be under that letter no poincte or prick. For if
there be one, it must be stricken vpwardes with one of the fingers, as shall
best fit it.

Example.

^

The tenth Rule.
IF you do find one, two, or three letters, having no prick or poincte
underneath, you shall strike vpwardes as many strings, as you shall find
letters upon the lines of the Tablature, signifiyng the said strings, with as
many fingers as there be letters and strings, and you must also note, that
although there be but one poincte or prick under one, two, or three letters,
they must be all stricken with the fingers, without the thombe, as if every
letter were marked severally with his prick or poincte.

Example.

^

The eleventh Rule.
IF under two, three or many letters comprised in one stop, be found no
prick or poincte, then you must gripe, or draw as many strings, as there
be found letters: gripyng, or drawyng* is to be understood, when the thombe
and the fingers of the right hand play together. Because in the eight Rule,
we have spoken of six parts, the which will not be full, except all the
six strings be sounded, and yet having but five fingers to each hand,
accoumptyng the thombe for one, and yet of the five, the little finger serves
but to keep the hand from upon the beallie of the Lute: some would think it
hard to be done, and almost impossible, to play five or six parts upon
the Lute, but when it shall be understood, in what sort it may be done, it will
not seem so strange.

The twelfth Rule.
BEcause it shall be hereafter necessary for the understanding of the Tablature,
to know the division of the hand and the fingers, and with what names I will
surname them, I will advertise thee, that after the thombe, the next followyng
shall be the first, next unto that shall be the second, the third to be the
third, and the little finger to be named the little finger.

The thirtene Rule.
AND to the end thou shalt not be abused by these terms, to strike
dounewardes, to strike vpwardes, or to gripe, you shall understand, to strike
down the strings, is when the thombe plaieth alone, which strikes the
stryng dounward, or lift or strike vpwardes, those be the fingers that
strikes the strings vpwardes, when the letters be marked with poinctes or
pricks to gripe, is when the thombe and the fingers play together, the which
notwithstanding, does not leese their office to strike vpwardes, or
dounewardes, that is to say, to strike dounewardes with the thombe, and
vpwardes with the fingers.

The fowertene Rule.
WHen thou will play six parts upon the Lute, thou must strike
dounewardes, the sixte and the fifte stryng, with the thombe only, trainyng it
upon the two strings, or two parts, as if thou would shut thy hand,
and strike vpwardes the third and fowerth parts or strings, with thy first
finger, as if thou would join, or shut it to thy thombe, which finger
and thombe, after that sort strikes four parts, and to strike vpwardes the
second part, with the second finger and the first, which is the Treble
with the third finger, which makes the full six parts.

Example.

^

The fiftene Rule.
IF it so happen, thou have but five parts to play, thou may as in the
foresaied Rule, strike dounewardes with thy Thombe, the sixte and fifte stryng,
or the fifte and fowerth, and to strike vpwardes the three other strings, with
the four other fingers, so that the Counter Base, and the next part be ne^e
one to an other. Otherwise it were necessary, that the first finger should
strike vpwardes, the third and fowerth strings or parts, to make the fowerh
and fifte part. As for the example.

Example.

^

The sixtene Rule.
FOr to play four parts, it is easily to be understand, that the thombe and
the three fingers together, serve easily to strike the four strings or
parts, each doing his part, strikyng upward and dounewarde.

Exemple.

^The.x. Commandments. ^ ^

The seuentene Rule.
FOr to play three parts only, the thombe will serve, as we have already
taught thee in the Rules aforesaied, to strike the Counterbase dounwardes, the
first and the second finger, to strike vpwardes the two other, which make
the three parts.

^ ^ Ie ne veux plus a mon mal consentir. ^ ^ ^ ^

The eightene Rule.
FOr to play two parts, the thombe, as of custom shall strike dounwarde the
Base stryng, and the first, or other finger, the other stryng.

Example.

^ ^ ^ ^

NOw that we have spoken briefly, the disposicion of the right hand, and with
what fingers we ought to gripe, strike vpwardes, and strike dounewardes the
strings, we will come to the left hand, and speak thereof, how it ought to
be disposed, retainyng the selfsame names of the fingers, that we have used,
in speaking of the offite of the right hand.

The ninetene Rule.
AS we have in the fowertene Rule made answer to the doubt, that might have
been made, as having but five fingers, of the which four serve only to
gripe, draw, or lift up the strings, that it should be impossible to play
five or six parts. Even so we might answer them that would ask, how one
might stop with ^ower fingers of the left hand, five or six strings, the
thombe being occupied to bear up the Lute, and to guide the hand: when the
first finger alone (I mean that next to the thombe) might easily stop all
the strings, in couchyng the said finger, a long overthwart the stop,
which is a thing ordinary and common, to serve two or three parts, and that
is done, when there be many letters a like, to play in one stop, as
three.BBB. three.CCC. and so of other.

Example.

^

The twenty Rule.
IF it happen that the first finger stop two or three strings, according to
the letters signified in the Tablature, and signified by the stoppes, the other
fingers next, as the second, third, and fowerth, shall stop the others
every one in his rank, according to natural order and degree, as I will
show thee hereafter very plainly.

AND for that in few words, thou may understand, how thou shalt dispose
the fingers of the said left hand, I have chosen for thee certain stoppes,
or familier accordes, common, and difficulte, the which I will teach thee,
showing thee with what fingers thou must stop, and those well practiced, will
easily make thee understand all others that shall come to thy hand.

NOw follow the stoppes, diverse and common, the which be interpreted, one
after an other, and with what finger of the left hand you must stop, and
for the better understanding, you must note, that if there be two, or three
letters of one sort, upon one stop, as two.BB. two.CC. or other letters,
be it the first.B. or.C. it shall be understood of that letter, that stands
vppermoste, be it.B or.C. or other letter* as touching the.A. call to
remembrance what I have before taught thee, because it is not stopped, but is
played open.

Common accordes.
^

THE first.C. of the first stop, that thou see here figured, must be
stopped with the second finger, and the second C. with the first finger.
The.B. of the second stop, with the first finger, the.D. with the third,
and the.C. with the second. The first.D. of the third stop, with the

unto the seuentene. The first and second of the last stop, with the first
finger, couchyng it a long, the.E. with the second, and the.F. with the third
finger. All the above said stoppes, be stopped, as I have taught thee here
before, if sometimes thou do not find thy self forced to change them, to do
some passage.

The one and twenty Rule.
OTher stoppes, which for the most part be played with the finger chouched
all a long, and for the better understanding hereof, you must note, that when I
speak of laiyng the finger all a long, that is to be understood of the fore
finger, which must be couched ouerthwarte the six parts or strings of the
Lute, or at the least to stop the letter which thou shall be constrained
to chouche, that happens when there be many letters of one sort, as
two.BB. two.CC. or other. Always obseruyng the order that I have given thee
in the former article, touching the first and second letter, and when I shall
speak of a natural stop, thou shall note, that this stop cannot be done,
nor played, but after a sort, followyng the natural order of the fingers, or
of the hand.

Example.

^

THe.D. of this first stop, must be stopped with the second finger, the.F.
with the little finger, the.E. with the third finger, and the.C. with the
first. The first.C. of the second stop, and the second, must be couched
all a long with the first finger, the.D. with the second finger, and the.E.

with the first finger, the.D. with the second, and the.E. with the third. The
two.CC. of the eight stop, with the finger couched all a long, the.D. with
the second finger, and the F. with the little finger* The.B. of the nineth
stop, with the first finger, the two.CC. with the second finger, and the.E.
with the little finger. The tenth touch naturally. The eleventh touch as the
first. The two.CC. of the twelueth touch, with the finger couched along,
the.D. with the second finger, the first.E. with the little finger, the
second with the third finger. The thirtene stop is natural. The fowertene
stop like the sixte: The fiftenth like the first. The fifte.H. of the
sixtenth stop, with the little finger, the two.FF. with the first finger,
the.G. with the second, and the.H. with the third finger. The.K. of the
seuenteth stop, with the little finger, the two.FF. with the finger couched
a long, the.H. with the secende finger. The eighteneth stop, like the
sixteneth: The two.FF. of the ninetenth stop, with the first finger, the

three and twenty stop, like the nineth. The three.CCC. of the last stop,
wih the finger couched a long, the first.E. with the little finger, the
second with the third, and the third with the second finger. All the
abouesaied stoppes be down naturally, as it is taught thee, if thou be not
constrained to dispose them otherwise, to make some passage.

The two and twenty Rule.
IT is also necessary to give thee to understand, to what purpose the bars
that be drawn bias. under the letters or passages do serve for, and for thy
better understanding, I have here under drawn thee an example at large, and
very familier, in the which thou shalt not find one example, trimmed or
measured, that thou shalt need to remove any of thy fingers from the said
measure: The knowledge of the said bar is so necessary, that having found
out, and exercised the same, thou shalt not need to remove, but those
fingers, which thou shall be forced, which we call close, or couerte play,
as for the other bars, which come straight ouerthwarte the lines, that
signifies unto us the six strings, serve for no other purpose, but to make a
distinction, and to enclose the measures, sometimes one of a Semibreue, an
other whiles of two, according to the discretion of him that brings Music,
into the Tablature for the Lute.

Exemple.

^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^

The three and twenty Rule.
ALL the other signs or figures, that is found within, or without the
Tablature, be practiced as in Music, that is to say, the poincte of
repetition is thus figured ^ signifiyng that you must repeat twice one thing:
the poincte of rehearsal signifiyng* that when you be toward the midst, or
toward the end, you must return to the said poincte of rehearsal, which
is figured thus* ^ As touching the Orgaine poincte thus figured ^ it is applied
sometime to the midst, sometime to the end, and it has this signification,
that where it is found, you must pause, or rest without discretion. You must
also understand what the two bars do signify, figured in this sort ^
which does serve sometimes to save you labor, from writing one thing twice:
it has moreover this signification, sometime to make you leave some measure,
as coming to some poincte of repetition, or to an end, but when thou shalt
find it before the poincte of repetition, repeated the second time, thou must
leave that, which is betwixt the said two bars, and the said poincte of
repetition. Contrariwise, when they be found in the end, the first time you
must, coming to the two bars, leave that which is betwixt them and the
end, and you must play that, which is beyond the end, then retournyng to
the poincte of rehearsal, thou shalt make and end of that, which thou
did leave at the first, that is to ^aie, that which is betwixt the tweo
bars, and the end, As for example.

Example.

^ ^Ce n'est bien ne plaisir. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^

The four and twenty Rule,
FInally, you must now know the marks, long, straight, crooked, and forked,
which be over the letters of the Tablature, is no other thing, but a certain
valuation of the notes of Music, trimly invented to keep measure, without the
which, this art were unprofitable, or worth nothing, and if thou find but
the first letter, marked with one of these figures, between two bars, thou
shalt understand, that the rest of the letters be all of the same time, that
the first letter is measured withal, it would have been but labor in vain,
to have marked them all with one figure, some mark them with the Music it
self, or with other Ziphers, according to the manner of the Country, when thou
do find any of these figures ^ marked with a prick or poincte, that
poincte does signify the augmentacion of half the time more of the figure or
measure, where unto it is joined, as commonly is practiced in Music. As
touching this figure ^ it has never no poincte nor prick, and it is called a
Semibreue, which is a note of the longest measure, that is practiced upon the
Lute, for if there be longer, of force they must be divided.

The five and twenty Rule.
TO tune your Lute well, although it be hardly to be showed, being subject to
the delicatnesse of a stryng, either to the greatness, or to the smalnesse of
the Instrumente, thou must therein follow nature, who will be by no means
be forced, a good ear is there unto also a good help, to have consideration
to the extreme highness, and the extreme lowness, and thy beginning shall be
at the great Base, which shall be unto thee a very good guide, to conducte
thee to his companion the next string, the which must be higher eight notes.
Then the fifte being the second Base, to set higher by four notes then the
great Base, and the second Bases companion, to be higher by eight notes: the
next unto that, being the fowerth part, called the Countertenour, shall be set
higher four notes above the first part or second Base, and his companion to
be set higher by eight notes. The third part called the great means,
shall be higher by three notes* then the Countertenour, in unity: The small
means, ^ower notes higher then the great means: The Treble or last part,
four notes higher then the small means, which thou shalt truly do, having
a good ear withal, notwithstanding, a thing not easy to all men, but to
them only that have been doers in this art, and that long time have as it
were, married their ear to the sweetness of the stryng, notwithstanding, such
as have a good will, and are desirous to learn, may have recourse unto the
examples and rules, which I have here under written.
