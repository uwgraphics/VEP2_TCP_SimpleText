TO THE HOPE OF HIS COVNTRIE, THE COMFORT OF HIS FATHER, THE JOY OF HIS
FRIENDS, the terror of his Enemies, the most wise, valiant, and virtuous
Prince;
THE MOST HIGH AND Mighty Charles, Prince of Wales, the sole Son, and chief
solace of the most Potent, Prudent, Pious, Learned, Peaceable, Warlick King
JAMES, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, etc.
MOst Mighty Prince; I doubt not but the world may deem me ouer-audacious, and
you this work tedious and troublesome; the former, that I should presume to
dedicate such an indigested, immature Embrio to your Highness; the latter, in
regard you Highnesses eyes have diversity and multitudes of more worthy
objects. To the first, J answer; that by how much the work is more mean, by
so much it has more need of a mighty Protector, and therefore, though they may
deem me impudent, yet it is not a thing imprudent, but important, that it
should seek to shelter it self under the patronage of your Highness. To the
next, J beseech your Highness, (nam nil nisi vota supersunt) not so much to
respect the weakness of the work, as the willingness of the Author, to
perform duty unto your mighty Personage, who though he cannot go for
ability, yet he creeps to offer this Sacrifice unto you, and is emboldned
through the abundance of obedient love, to cast this mite into the treasury of
your Highness.

Far be it from me, with the Ape in the Fable, (who brought her young ones to
the Lion, as the most amorous and beautiful) to present this issue of my
brains, and offspring of my labors, as worthy of the view of your Highness:
Oh no, I am no ways guilty of such a Philautie, but in regard your royal
self is the Subject of which it treats, showing the happiness which is
derived by the most fortunate contract between your Highness and that most
incomparable Lady and pure Virgin of France; in which though with a weak
unable pensile, J have drawn forth and portraied the divine parts of your
princely Personages; of the which, though all knew some, yet some knew not all
which J have related: in the which description and map of your perfections if I
have failed, (as J cannot hope to the contrary) I humbly crave pardon, and
prostrate my self at the feet of your merciful censure; beseeching you that
the true affection of the Author may cover the imperfection of the work.

The reasons which moved me to this boldness to crave your Highness his
Patronage, were these:

First, in respect you are the chief Subject of this Marriage Song, the which
Subject though it be impossible for me to honor by my work, yet it is most
certain, my work is honored by it.

Secondly, in regard as you, for all virtues are the adamant of admiration from
all men, so most especially for your resplendent virtue of humility, who though
you be high in Majesty, yet you are low in mind, and despise not, but
encourage men, though weak and impotent, in any good enterprises and virtuous
endeavors, that so being nourished by your favor, and comforted with your
countenance, they might increase and grow in goodness, and in fine attain to
the sum of all perfections.

Moreover, J know that I do not only owe my labors and all that J have to
your Highness who are the Conduit, by which God conueys felicity not only to
me, but Millions of people; the which constrained me in gratitude to
consecrate this work unto you.

Reject not therefore these fruits of my Industry, which were invented and
presented out of mere respect to your Highness, and the joy conceived for the
late contract with France; and as you are the pattern of all virtues, so
vouchsafe to be the Patron of this book, which is but an abridgement and the
compendium of them, and an expression of the happiness, which is likely to be
an attendant and follower of this your intended and promised marriage with the
Lady Henrette Maria, Daughter to Henry the Fourth, King of the French and
Navarre, and Sister to Lewis the Thirteenth, now French King; the which
grieuing to see, that none more able than my self would undertake, J (though
with weakness) have performed.

Let therefore this book which was written only for your Highness, is
Dedicated to your Highness, be accepted of your Highness; of the which, not
despairing, J wish unto your Highness a higher than the highest Happiness,
that you may have a long and fortunate life, remain the comforter of your
friends, the Conqueror of your enemies, and be the Father of many happy
Children.

Your Highness most obseruant, George Marcelline.

TO THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND every ways accomplished Prince, George, Duke of
Buckingham, Viscount Villers, Baron of Whaddon, Lord High Admiral of England,
Justice in Air of all his Majesty's Forests, Parkes, and Chases beyond Trent,
Master of the Horse to his Majesty, and one of the Gentlemen of his Majesty's
Bedchamber, Knight of the most noble order of the Garter, and one of his
Majesty's most honorable Privy Counsel of England and Scotland.
MOst honored Prince; let it be no wonder unto your Grace, why I do implore
your Joint Patronage with your Prince, of these my Labors, since you are his
Jonathan, and have been a companion and faithful friend unto him in all his
Trauells; manifesting your self to be as faithful to that Son, as you were
favored of the Father. As therefore you were his Associate in his
Peregrination, so join with him in the Patronizing of this work: Moreover, as
you were a chief instrument of hindering the marriage with Spain, and
furthering this with France, by which means, you brought happiness unto this
Island, for the which, it yields unto your Grace; so also you are mentioned in
this work, and a joint Subject of it; vouchsafe therefore to be a joint Patron
of it.

A fourth Motive which encourages me in this request, is, that as you are the
chief Favorite of our King on earth, and of God the King of Kings, so you are
aprincipall favorer of all good and worthy proceedings, by which your name is
embalmed with fame, and your memory will be immortal. Not doubting therefore
but you will grace this work with mild acceptance, though not for the manner
of writing, yet the matter written of in it, I cease to trouble you, but
always rest an humble suitor to your grace for acceptance, and to God, for the
continuance of your happiness in the present, and your increase of it in the
future, that you may be blessed internally, externally, and eternally, and
that the highest would multiply all temporal and spiritual graces upon your
Grace.

Your humbly devoted, George Marceline.

To the Reader.
GEntle Reader, (I hope I shall not miscall thee) the joy conceived by me for
this contract, the love to my Country, the zealous affection I bear to the
virtues of our hopeful Prince, and his happy Princess, have jointly enforced
me to undertake this Enterprise; in the which, though many calumniating
censures may blame my Pen, yet they must honor the Persons handled in it; in
the blazing of whose perfections, if they tax me with flattery, they brand
themselves with folly, and an ill affection to their King, Prince, and
Country, and manifest themselves either to have their ears stopped, and their
eyes blinded, or their Judgments defective; for they ought to account it their
chiefest honor, to honor (if it be possible to add honor to their names,
whose virtues honor themselves, more than lies in the power of any Pen to
honor them) their sovereign, and his only Son, and our only hope; But
sure I am, that multitudes will love and honor this work, if it be only for
the Subjects handled in it, the love of whose worth may claim an obseruant
look on these my labors; in which are showed the fortunate consequences
likely to ensue upon this contract, which are the destruction of the Foes of
Christ, and the Enemies of Christians, the tranquillity of the Truth, the Peace
of the Church, the prosperity of all people; which shows, though in an
Epitome, the virtues of thy King, the Happiness of the Father, in the enjoying
of such a joyous Son, as the mighty Prince Charles, whose names offer not so
much as to read without a true love joined with a trembling fear, for it is
they, by whose means thou do enjoy thy means, upon whose life depends thy
welfare: rather therefore show thy wisdom in silence, for if thou termest me
a Parasite, thou prouest thy self a Parrat which speak.

Epithalamium Gallo-Britannicum, OR GREAT BRITAINS And FRANCES Joy.
THE Felicity of a Kingdom is placed in the Prosperity of the Prince; and
the welfare of a Prince, either made or mangled in his Matching: But never was
Kingdom more happy in a Prince, never Prince more fortunate in his Choice,
than the Treasure and Storehouse of our hopes, the Sum and Substance of our
future bliss, the high and mighty Prince Charles, in obtaining this
Princess, who vnparalell'd for perfections, both external of her body, and
internal of her mind, stands as a matchless Mirror to all her Sex, if not
to be adored, yet at the least admired, has made a Contract between three
Kingdoms and happiness, which were a long time divorced from it; being like
the house of Abraham, troubled until their Isaak had found out a Rebecca.

Oh Peerless Prince! fortunate beyond the imagination of man's mind, then
surely more transcending the limits of my pens relation; could you but pry into
the hearts of millions of people, you should see all the veins and streets of
those Metropolitan Cities of those little worlds, swelled and full with joy,
who formerly found no tranquillity of mind, though in the peace of the State;
because your Royal Self had not found out a Second Self, whereby their
posterity might shroud and refresh themselves hereafter, under the shadow of
your Branches, and that from your Issue, fountains of fortunate joy might flow
to succeeding ages. How many Kingdoms do bathe themselves in the sunneshine
of solace, and find more than earthly happiness, in those resplendent beams,
which shine from this blessed Contract: conceiving no leffe joy in your
relinquishing of the Lady Maria of Spain, and matching and uniting your Soul
(which is the Court of the Highest, and King of Kings, the Temple of the Holy
Ghost) unto the heart of that vnparalell'd Princess, the Lady Henrette Maria
of France, which is a rich Cabinet, filled with the Gemms and invaluable
Jewels, of moral virtues and divine graces.

If it please your hopeful Highness to retire a little from home, and to cast
an eye of consideration upon France, there may be seen such an infinite
ineffable measure of mirth, and an incomparable treasure of true joy, found by
them in this Conjunction, and from the highest to the lowest, from the Peer to
the poor, nothing but applause and triumph. For can they choose but rejoice, to
see that Virtues Paramour and Darling of Venus, whose virtue ennobleth her
birth, whose birth does make her virtues eminent, whose countenance and whose
conditions do mutually grace and adome each other, so worthily bestowed; and
their perfectly accomplished Princess, united to so glorious, so gracious a
Head, as who is the Joy of his Friends, the Terror of his Enemies, the Comfort
and Hope of his Country, the Pattern of Princes, the Admiration of the world,
the mighty Prince Charles? For what Country could have been the Emissarie of
such a Prince; or what Prince the Possessour of such a Country, as Great
Britain of Charles, or Charles of Great Britain? the which, as He is blessed
with all graces, so it abounds with all blessings, that He might be happy in
it, and it fortunate in Him; that as He blesses that with peace, so it might
satisfy Him with plenty. Had she forsaken a fat fruitful soil to come into a
barren Country, it might somewhat have impaired her happiness, and been a
wound to her welfare; but this is a Paradise of pleasure, a Land like Canaan,
flowing with milk and honey. Had she found such a fertile Kingdom destitute
of so royal a Prince, she could not have had so much joy in the one, without
enjoying the other: if the ring be void of a precious stone, it is not so much
esteemed; neither has a Diamond set in lead, such store of luster: But our
Prince, seated and planted in such a pleasant place, is like a Diamond set in
Gold, the one of which makes the other of more estimation.

Oh fortunate France! if thou do not undervalue thy happiness, that art
linked in the bond of amity with fair Albion, whose climate is temperate,
whose air serene and clear; here is not heat so excessiuely parching in
Summer, but that any constitution may endure it, nor the cold so piercing in
Winter, but that the most tender may withstand it. How many Crystal fountains
and running streams be there, like so many veins in this body of our
Kingdom? and to the intent that none of the elements might be defective, but
that all might concur to make us happy, we are sufficiently stored with all
kind of fuel and firing; neither is the womb of our earth barren, but most
fit for conception, multiplies the seed committed to it, so that our fields do
laugh with store of grain, and Autumn crams our barnes with full increase; so
that our Countrey-mans life is crowned with contentment. And whereas in other
Nations they have no want, here they have no fear of want; for what commodity
have we not, either to comfort our selves, or help our neighbors? What
blessings do we not enjoy, either necessary to our subsistence, or requisite
to our well-being? no surely, and I may well say, The Lord has not dealt so
with any Nation; for how do we abound with store of corn and cattle, and all
other commodities? or if we should want any thing for festiuitie (although we
have all indeed for necessity) yet how fitly is it seated for all kind of
traffic, and as (who should say) it were the only Darling of the Sea, it is
lullabide in the lap of Thetis, and hugged in with the Ocean, who does so
enwrap her in her arms, as she does not only permit her trading and commerce
with all people, but does promise to save and secure her from her enemies. Them
who can prescribe bounds unto the joy of the French Nation, who see their
Princess, the Glory of her Sex, so well and worthily matched, that it is to
be expected from her womb shall issue mighty Monarchs, who shall be the most
happy Princes in the world in their inheritance; whose lot is like to fall in
so fair a Land, the which is a Treasury and Storehouse fraught with all
blessings, which denies no kind of sustenance to her inhabitants.

But if you leave the City, and examine but the Citizens, forsake the survey
of the Continent, and look upon the Contents; and you shall have joyful
experience, that the place is not so pleasant, but the people as pleasing; and
from him that is seated in the royal throne of dignity, to him that lies
groueling in the deep abyss of misery, all full of affability and
courtesy. If you inquire into the dispostion of the sacred Majesty of our
most mighty and inuict Monarch, under the wings of whose wisdom we his
subjects take most quiet repose and rest; you shall find him to be repleat
with all graces requisite for so great, so gracious a Sovereign: within whose
countenance like two heavenly lamps shine both Majesty and Mercy, that the one
might win from his subjects a reverent fear, the other obtain a religious
love; whose mind is fraught with humane knowledge, and furnished with divine,
in such a measure and manner, as he may not be more truly styled The King of
Great Britain, than The Solomon of Kings: whose passions are subject to
reason, whose reasons Pilot is Religion; who will not iniure himself by
suffering excess, nor offend any in offering the least wrong unto them; who
though he truly deserves the style of a Peacemaker, yet he does not respect
peace so much as to neglect a just occasion of war; who as he is not like a
raw wound, too sensible or apprehensiue of injuries, so he is not like dead
flesh, void of all feeling; who as he is so conscionable not to tyrannize, so
he is so courageous not to permit a Tyrant to usurp his own or his friends
dominions: for though his anger did a long time sleep, yet being awaked out of
slumber, He will not easily be stilled. The running rough streams which be
soon disturbed, are most shallow; but the deep places which are not so
speedily moved, are more profound. The shrubs, brush and stubble, though they
be kindled in an instant, yet they are extinct in a moment; when heart of Oak
and stout Timber, though it be not so soon accended, yet as it is more solid,
so it is of longer continuance. To be soon inflamed, is a sign of Rashness;
but always to bear injuries, is want of Valor: Therefore this our royal
religious King, to the end that he might be as well void of temeritie as
timiditie, of folly as of fear, will not be stirred but upon just occasion,
nor stilled without due recompense.

Suppose that Wisdom for a long time kept his sword in his sheath, yet Justice
has now drawn it: He knows that Rashness is the abortiue fruit of Passion,
and the blood of his subjects precious; therefore He poiseth all his proiects
in the balance of discretion, He weighs all his injuries with his revenge;
and to show the ripeness of his judgment, he will not suffer his hand to be
the author of any raw action, which is not thoroughly disgested with due
premeditation; whom though none can conquer in love, yet he does love in
wisdom; who though he did seem a while to wink at his childrens misfortunes,
yet Lion-like he did obdormire apertis oculis, and saw the injury done by
others, and the misery endured by them; of the which since peace cannot be the
Physician to prevent a just war, he will make an experiment if a war can
beget a just peace; who has showed more magnanimity in dangerlesse despising,
than many in dangerous affecting others kingdoms, being very loath to hazard
the loss of guiltless souls, or to build upon his neighbors ruins, but
like a wise Pilot to govern the ship well in which God had placed him, and not
to seek to be a head to another body. Neither was this for the defect of any
fortitude; oh no, there are like to be enough bleeding witnesses of his kingly
courage, and he is most wise to see what is best, and most just to perform
what he sees. Indeed our potent King does measure his greatness by his
goodness, and only affects greatness that he may have means to exercise
his goodness; the gravity of whose head is adorned with the grace of his
heart, for he has not only the name, but the nature of a King, and uses not
his Kingdom as Tenants at will do their houses, who care not how they be
ruinated, because each day they expect a departure out of them; but as if he
had an eternal lease, he seeks the perpetual welfare of it; for his sword
is at enmity with those which are foes to virtue, and his purse at peace with
them which are enemies to vice. His Subjects taste not the bitter fruits of
grievous taxation; neither are Laws with us so much made to find faults, as
to prevent and punish them: Our Court is not a privileged place of unlawful
actions and licenciousnesse, but is the resident and abiding place of Him,
which as He is the Father of his Country, so He gives it good example: and
who is most bountiful in rewarding the well-deseruing, and in requiting
courtesies; for He knows sufficiently, that to be indebted, is to be an
inferior: and has a most diligent care, and careful diligence, in his words
and his works, to instruct his people, having life in his doctrine, and
doctrine in his life; for He appears to his Subjects virtuous, as He would
have them be, and labors to be such as He appears, that as his Laws give
life unto his people, so he gives life to his Laws; for they be but as
Maxims, derived and collected out of his life; for it is as a great Volume, in
which they may read whole Lectures of wholesome Precepts. Neither does He
drive his Subjects on the path of Virtue, so much with the Rod of Law, as He
does draw them with the Adamant of Love; for, can they choose, but dearly and
nearely affect Him, who, as He is above them in place, so He exceeds them in
love? who, being the Head, cannot see one of the members hurt, but He does
sympathize in sorrow with it, not placing his gains in their pains, or
esteeming Himself most a King, when they are most basely subjected.

Neither is his Estate with the peoples welfare, as it were in an unjust
balance, so that his goes highest, when theirs goes lowest; but the seat of
all his happiness is situated in their good fortunes. Neither does He rule
them with a Rod of Iron, but a Scepter of Gold, never restraining their
liberty, unless it tended to licenciousnesse; nor pulling goods from any
particular, unless it were for a general good. In fine, He has brought all
his Subjects to such a pass, that though He takes nothing by force, yet He
has all by love; for who would not venture, either his purse or his person, to
perform his pleasure? which of his Subjects would not entertain his death
with sweet embracement, so that his Princes, or Sovereigns Successors and
Posterities welfare, might have birth from his death, and spring out of his
ashes? Certes, there is none but would willingly shake hands with life,
liberty, or estate, in a grateful requital of those blessings we here enjoy,
by the means of his Majesty's most gracious government. Indeed they are so
united unto him, by the inviolable bonds of fear and love, that all his
Subjects, as his Pulses, do beat according to the motion of his heart: For
ought not they willingly to perform his will, who denies to grant none of
their wishes; for has his Kingdoms desired peace? how long have they possessed
it? yea, in such a turbulent time, when almost all Europe has had war in her
own bowels. But do our people thirst for revenge upon those which have
injured their Sovereigns Issue, and wronged the Princely Branches sprung from
their Royal Stock, for fear they should not be delivered of that which they
travel of, but lose their longing? He assumeth Arms for the restoration of
his Son, to do that by force, which He could not purchase by favor.

And sithence He finds his Enemies not to be like Flints, which may be broken
upon the feather-bed of persuasions; but as Nettles, the which, by how much
more they are easily handled, by so much the more violently they sting; He
resolves to handle them more roughly, lest they as much hurt him, as they
injured his Neighbors. Then surely, what unspeakable joy ought this to be, to
that matchless Princess of France and all her Nation, She not more rejoicing,
that She has found such a royal, wise, and every way accomplished Father,
than they, that they have found such a noble worthy Friend? She may exult that
She is ingrafted into such a Stock, they of such Alliance; for He is not only
potent in men, but powerful in money and munition, that as his money wants not
men, so his men want not money. Howsoever, indeed, some may suggest and object,
that his bounty has almost exhaust his Treasury: Yet, as the candle, though
it gives another light, yet it self is not darkened: So, though our Sovereign
has enricht many of his Subjects, yet He has not impouerisht Himself; for
He has so bestowed it upon such persons, as were not so willing to receive
it, but they will be as well content to surrender it up into his hands again,
if either their Kings pleasure, or their Countries profit, give them summons to
make such a redeliuerie. Then surely, not only the Throne, but the Footstool,
not only the French Prince, but the People may swim (I had almost said)
surfeit with delight in this Blessed Union; for what hindrance is there, whereby
that most Christian King, Lewis the thirteenth, may expect, but that as our
Princes Highness ioynes hands with his Sister, so our Kings Majesty will
join Arms with him, for the regaining of those Kingdoms, which unjustly an
usurping hand detaineth from him? for, Vis vnitafortior, and (that I may use
our Proverb) Many hands make light work; Diverse threads twisted together, as
they do more strongly bind, so they are not so easily broken of an enemy. It
was King Richards comparison, A bundle of arrows bound together could not be
broken; but disseuered, with much facility they may be cracked: and I may make
application to these Kingdoms, as He did to that his Kingly Issue. It is not
to be doubted, but that since James and Lewis, two Kings so valiant; Great
Britain and France, two Kingdoms so potent; are united and joined in this
bond, as well of affection as affinity; their enemies shall not be of power
to prejudice them, nor of strength to withstand them. And howsoever the whole
world is an eie-witnesse of the beauty and bounty of both their minds, which
is so great, that each of them do esteem it a greater honor, to give a
Kingdom, than to get it; yet where there is wrong offered them and their
Allies, all the might of their foes shall be as a stone dashed against steel,
which shall rebound in their own faces, to their own disgrace and ruin.

Neither let their enemies think, but that howsoever they do not love to
seek others Dominions, yet they will not lose their own without stirring: For
will our dread Sovereign, when both amity and equity, religion and affection
do give him loud summons to restore his children to their inheritance, detain
his helping hand from his hopeful issue? Will He or can He see without sorrow
(and by consequence, labor to redress it) that his posterities Country,
which formerly was the garden of the world, unpeopled, ruinated, and made a
desolate Desert; his Issue to be exiled from their inheritance, and hope
banished from them; his childrens children forced to fly before they were
taught to go; Can he, I say, see this, and not sorrow at it? Can he sorrow at
it, and yet suffer it? Can he have power, and yet want will to revenge it? Oh
no, his hand is full of vigor, and he is fraught with valor; his subjects
souls do thirst for revenge, and all his foes shall have woeful experience,
that he is as valiant to maintain a war, as wise to entertain a peace, and
he can as well sacrifice at the altars of Mars as Ceres, and is as well
Achilles for his courage, as Ulysses for his counsel. Then who can impose a
period to the endless joy of the French Nation, who have found a way to join
themselves with such a powerful Prince, who does not only make them happy in
his alliance, but is likely to make them also fortunate in conquests and
victories, when these two mighty Monarchs shall mutually aid each other to
right themselves, their wronged neighbors, and affinity? Thus far have I
proceeded in the narration of the never sufficiently extolled perfections of
our mighty Monarch, in so much as my pen is persuaded she has wronged them
in the relation, and made but an imperfect draught of them, being unable to
limme them to the life. From whence France may understand, that her happiness
is higher ascended, in regard their Princess is joined in wedlock with one
which is so worthily descended from one who is the most potent, most prudent,
most wise, most valiant, most magnanimous, magnificent Monarch that ever blessed
the air with a breath, or these kingdoms with a peaceable, yet prosperous
government, as if he had been only sent from Heaven to increase Gods worship
and this Kingdoms welfare.

But as if God had not only intended to bless that illustrious Princess with
such a royal Father who does grace the fruit which is borne of him, he has
also provided a Prince to be her husband, which does adorn the stock he comes
of, who heirs his Father not only in his royal rich powerful kingdoms, but
in his rare perfect accomplished qualities; at whose birth the Senate House of
the Planets did jointly consent and determine to confer both upon his body
and mind all the perfections that can accompany a corporal essence, or
inhabit in a mortal mansion place; at whose Birthday Dame Nature brought her
richest ornaments to deck him withal, and all the Grace took possession of
him for their habitation: and to the intent good education might nourish and
cherish those seeds so sown, he was not nusled and nursed in the night of
ignorance, nor weaned ouer-soone from the paps of knowledge: But the good
instructions of faithful Tutors, the godly example of our religious King, did
continually so blow the sparks, of virtue that Dame Nature had kindled in him,
as in small time they gave forth their utmost heat, setting on fire, and
inflaming the affections of all that knew him: Whose body, as it was composed
of the purest mold that lodged in the bosom of Nature, so it was built up in
the stateliest frame and fashion that can be imagined, wanting nothing that
the Heavenly Influences could infuse into it; so that indeed he seems the
Masterpiece of Nature, as if she had aimed at a reach above herself, and when
she produced him, intended to frame and compose an Angel.

Moreover, seeing it is not fitting, that a poor man of mean estate should
inhabit the Court of a King; for so the rooms might be ruined for want of
employment, and it would seem like a painted Sepulcher, God put in an
Inhabitant, answerable to that stateliness of the building, and rareness of
the edifice; and lest it might seem to be nothing but walls without furniture,
God put such a soul into it, so adorned and beautified with all perfect
graces, and gracious perfections, that the one might be correspondent to the
other, in eminency and dignity, whose mind is of sufficient power to inform
each part and organ of his body; so his body is able to perform whatsoever
noble action his mind shall incite and move him to it, being both of ability
and agilitie, to put in execution the Souls directions. He which has a weak
body and strong mind, which pricks him forward to valiant actions, is like a
woman, which has not strength to be delivered of that which she has
conceived: But on the contrary, corporal strength without mental courage, is
as a servant which wants a master to set him on work: But our noble Prince
has both stoutnesse of stomach and strength of body to put in execution
every valiant enterprise his mind pricks him forward to, so that no man which
sucketh in this vital air, is able to perform any warlike action, either on
horse or on foot more strongly, or deliver that strength more nimbly, or become
that delivery more gracefully, than our hopeful valiant Prince. His stature
of body is neither a Giant or a Pigmie, but placed in the golden in cane, to
each eyes censure He seems an object of pleasure. In a word, each particle of
every part of his body, is so void of deformity, and so full of the best
workmanship of Nature, that He may seem a Prince of all, as well for his
beauty as his birth: And had he nothing but a body, it were sufficient to
command the best man's approbation and affection; for his countenance is an
Epitome of Ethics, in which Modesty and Majesty do fight for superiority,
and Mars and Venus to be in contention for the higher places, yet striving in
such fashion, as neither of them, or their Dominions, are diminished, but
enlarged by these their wars: But if you make a further search, etc leaving
his countenance, look into his (...), you shall find the former, compared to
this, to be but as an Index of a great Volome of Virtue, in the which Center
they all rest in their highest perfection: and howsoever in most men humility
does sildo me accompany honor, and lowliness of mind highness of estate;
(...) in Him it is far other way to: for though He be advanced to the highest
pitch of honor, yet He scorneth to scorn any thing but (...), or to disdain
ought but baseness*

Moreover, it is alwayed his (...), rather to comfort than to contemn the
poor; and as He is full of humility, for He is void of pride, aspiring to
nothing but goodness: and lest that He, being a Prince to so many, should be a
slave to Himself, He continually subdues his passions, and gets the conquest
of them, He knows that anger is a short madness, and madness a long anger;
and therefore He resolves to lodge no fury in his bosom, and is never sick
of this frenzy, only indeed He may be sometimes transported with a god by
zeal, whin either He seem his Country injured, or his God dishonored* for
He accounted (...) his chief (...) and reverence the other. It is a rare
thing to see a Prince that has all store of delicates (for we are ready to
rot our selves with riot, being put into a delightsome great pasture of
plenty) not subject to surfets: but He does never drink, but to allay the
heat and thirst of Nature; nor eat, but to satisfy and mortify hunger; from
which temperancie of diet, his matchless spotless chastity has birth: For,
whereas that man which is superfluous in his diet, is lascivious in his
thought, because Uncleanness is always the child of Riot; He therefore,
that He might not be stained with the one, abstains from the other, to the end
that his Heart (which is Gods Temple) might not be made a Den of thieves; for
when the Body fasteth the Soul feasteth, and the earthly members being
mortified, the faculties of the Soul do grow more lively and powerful.

Thus being Master of his own lusts, He scorns to be a servant to his
substance; but at his pleasure can part from it, and turn it out of his
service, yet never but upon a just occasion; for that were to have too little
and light respect of his servant, being a mere prodigality; but when He
sees it requisite, for the reward of Virtue, or the maintenance of Honor, to
part from it, the Sun is not more liberal of his light at high noonday,
than He of his means: for He loves not money like your covetous man (whose
eyes are out, and he can never see when he has sufficient, who like a Danaidum
dolium is never filled or satisfied,) but only for necessity, like a wife
Mariner providing in a calm against the coming of a storm, and in the
sunshine of peace, preparing to welcome the turbulent tempestuous time of
war. And for his wisdom (as who should say, it were likely He should be in
nothing unlike to his father) He outrunneth his age, and leaves all those of
his years behind Him in knowledge; for He sits in counsel like a sage
Senator, and a Law-making Lycurgus, that it seems a wonder (but wonders are
no wonders in a wondrous subject) how in the blossom of his years He should
have such ripeness and maturitie of Judgment, and in his green youth be
such a grave Counselor: For did not his Gracious Highness, in the last
Parliament, not only in appearance, but in truth, so well provide for the
safety and security, both of his Friends and Country, that He was generally
applauded both of Counselors and Commons, as being the most wise and
watchful Prince, for the welfare of his people: First, showing his ardent
zeal to Gods Glory and Religion, to make wholesome salutiferous Laws, for the
suppressing of the Sowers of Sedition, and the Interminglers of the tares of
their own inventions, amongst the pure grain of Gods Word. And thus having
expressed his love to God (above all under God) He prouides for his Peoples
prosperity, enacts Laws, as Antidotes against former exactions, so
customarily and unconscionably practiced in this our Commonwealth; as if He
were soly and wholly happy in making his people fortunate, and in easing them
of the heavy burdens of oppression imposed upon them, bound upon their backs,
and laid upon their shoulders. And indeed there never was Prince in
Christendom, more commended by mortal men in speeches, or commended to the
immortal God in prayers, than is our mighty inuict Prince; whose worth is
such, that if I should live to the age of Nestor, and in the whole course of my
life do naught but praise Him; praise Him in nothing but that which He is
worthy of: utter his worth compendiously, yet my pen would still be a debtor
to his deserts; for He is not like the vulgar sort (as the vulgar Proverb tells
us) Constant in nothing but inconstancy; but his mind once fixed on a worthy
object, is like a Star which moves not out of her orb; but is ever the same
in her motion. The little shrubs are shaken with eueric little puff of wind,
but the stately Cedar, which is firmly rooted and fastened in the ground, as it
is more noble, so it is more stable. Many Feathers and Weather-cocks in our
days, who are not resolute in any determinations, or determinate in any
resolution, do in an instant loathe that which they have loved: but our
Prince, as He does not lightly settle affection, so He will not easily remove
it; for He deemes the one a defect of wisdom, the other an excess of
wavering, and an ouer-plus of inconstancy.

Therefore, He being always balanced and counterpoysed with due premeditation
in affecting, cannot be induced in an instant to relinquish and distaste that
which He affects. Then has not France great reason and cause of joy and
exultation, who has found out such a Mate for their incomparable Princess?
who is one which has stoutnesse and courage of mind, joined to the strength
of his body, wisdom accompanying his valor, virtue his soul; who is a
Prince as well in worth as birth, excelling in bounty and beauty, and in all
his actions observing the golden mean; who is constant in his love, firm in
his resolutions, whose worth few can conceive, no man utter, all men may
admire; the descent of whose blood does ennoble his birth, the excellency of
whose birth does enthronize and dignifie his virtues; whose virtues (as I may
so say) do almost Deifie his Soul; the inestimable price of whose Soul does
adorn his body, by inhabiting in it; the rare temper of whose body does
bless his soul, by being the Mansion-place of it. And thus He which has all
virtues, is to be all Hers, and that Princess to be blessed with the admirable
constitution of his body, and the incomparable condition of his mind. Had his
body been of unequal unproportionable mixture by the elements, the soul might
have loathed such a muddie building, and would soon have forsaken her
habitation; or has the mind been corrupt and filthy, it would soon have
ruinated the rare body, in regard it would have employed it to such ryotous
ruinous courses, as it would soon have produced her overthrow, and demolisht
this mortal Edifice of Nature; by which means and likelihood, the shortness
of the Princes life, might have made an abridgement of her happiness, and have
cut short the continuance of her joys; but Nature has so tempered and framed
Him, of such an equal proportion of heat and moisture, that the excessive heat
of the one does not threaten a Combustion, nor the abundance of the other a
Deluge: but for his complexion He may be another Methuselah, and She most
superlatiue of her Sex in all felicity, in the possession of so loving a
Husband, so long a time, as He is like to enjoy this vital transitory
uncertain breath. Had He been like a Rose, or a Flower De-luce, which though
they be fair things, yet they are of short continuance: (for the one is no
sooner blown, but it sheddeth; and the other fades in the bud) her joy might
have found sorrow in the fear of the loss of her Joy; but He already is
grown to ripeness, and we hope (as may be coniectured, both by the temper of
his body, and temperance of his mind) is not only pleasing to the eye, but
is also likely to be a lasting fruit. It is the office of an husband to live
with his wife as a man of knowledge, and what Prince wiser than his Highness,
who squares out all his actions according to the Rule of Gods Word? who is so
verst in each verse of Scripture, so well read in Divinity, as He is not
only a Prince to command, but (for his learning) might be a Priest to enstruct
his people. Fear not then (oh renowned France) but He has taken your
Princess by the hand, not only to lead Her to all happiness on earth, but
to bring Her felicity; For what advise can She (who is so well understanding
the duty of a royal loving Spouse) refuse, which distilleth like Nectar from
his lips? Or what counsel shall proceed from Him, but that which tends to
the welfare of her body, and the saving of her soul and body hereafter? Oh
no, never was Princess blessed with a more holy, happy, heavenly Head, than
She, in being united to his Highness; who, as He has knowledge, so He has
love to direct Her to an happy end. Had his heart been the harbourer of love
only without knowledge, it had been but as a blind Guide; and knowledge,
without love to put it in practife, had been but as a fruitless plant, or
power without a will; but our mighty Prince, as He has no small measure of
wisdom, so He has an infinite abundance of affection, affection so great, as
indeed He is nothing but love, love to his God, love to his Princess, love to
his people; all of which are in Him so exceeding, that none of any of those
three particulars can be in any one person more eminent, than they be jointly
found in Him: For He loves God above Himself, He loves Her as Himself,
because She is half Himself, and He loves his People almost as He loves
Her. He loves God, because He is married to Him mystically; He loves Her, as
being knit unto Him in marriage really; He loves his People, as being wedded
unto them representatiuely indeed; He is so much love, as none that lives but
loves Him.

The Lord of Heaven has manifested his love to Him in his mercy; for when He
undertook that dangerous voyage out of his Country, Great Britain, into
Spain, dangerous in the journey, dangerous in the end of it indeed, nothing
but danger, both for his passage thither, his arrival there, his departure
from thence, being full of fear, and composed of nothing but danger; for the
waves, being proud of such a Burden, did swell with ambition, and the surges
soared above the ship, as if the sea had longed to have her womb the Tomb of
such a Worthy, and had intended to have erected her honor upon his ruin.

But God, to whom the winds and the seas obey, did still the rage of Neptune,
and closed up the mouth of Aeolus, in so much, as his people were all made
fortunate in his happy return, rejoicing that they had Him any ways, but
more joyous that they had Him single; but now most exulting that He is united,
by the sacred bond of wedlock, to your Princess of France, and we by that
means conjoined to you. Thus has the Lord, to the comfort of all
well-disposed people, delivered our best affected Prince, and in bringing Him
from Spain, has brought Him to France, that howsoever his love began in the
other, yet it might end in this; in which He has given most infinite content
unto his Kingdoms, who distasted the likelihood of the former, as much as they
applaud the certainty of this new Contract.

Surely, God has manifested his infinite love and respect to our noble Prince,
in so infinitely blessing his proper Self in Himself, and his people in Him,
in respect of his deliverance. Yea, God and man, your Highness and all the
world, may see the happiness we conceive of this Marriage, and hope for from
this Contract: And what was the efficient cause of this? but the love of God to
his Highness, thus worthily disposed to the content and happiness of his
people.

Here was the love of God manifestly and miraculously expressed to Him and all
this Nation, in this one particular: but if I should proceed to make a whole
discourse of Gods mercies as well toward his Body as his Soul, my task
would be as infinite as his blessings. But to leave our mighty Prince, whose
actions do more commend Himself, let France but as nobly conceive of our
Nobles as they deserve, and they shall find a most ineffable cause of most
unspeakable Joy in this Confederation; for their breasts are the lodges of
loyalty. For indeed, howsoever some of our natural Country men have lifted up
unnaturally their hands against their Liege and Sovereign, nevertheless it
was their religion, not their disposition, which moved them to it. And how long
time, has our King rested free from danger, begot and nursed up by his Nobles?
No, such, I dare say, is (or at least ought to be) their love to their
gracious King, that they deem it more liberty to be his Servant, than anies
Sovereign. For whereas generally great Kings wear Crowns like our Saviors,
made of thorns, composed of cares, which makes their eyes as Sentinels, to
watch continually, lest treason should surprise and overthrow; and fears
enjoin the mind to keep diligent watch, lest treason should euert both
Person and people: their petty Crowns are crowned with contentment, they are
not affrighted with danger, neither does fear make their night of rest, a day
of travel unto them; and all by their means, who like a stately Cedar to the
adjoining trees, shelters them from tempests, and drops down the honey of
peace upon them. This labor on his part begets the child of love in them, and
they deem no injury so great, nor apprehend any wrong so grievous, as that
which is done to their Prince: neither do they conjecture any greater
indignity can be done to them, than when He is not dignified; they count that
glory lest which does not redound to Him, and that honor to be as nothing,
with which He is not graced; and therefore like so many pillars, they do
support Him upon the shoulders of their obedience, who is their Roof, their
Cover and Protector. To the grauer sort of the which Nobility, our King stands
as a Pattern for them to imitate, in soundness of judgment, depth of
learning, and other virtues: and to the younger, our Prince serves as a Tutor,
to teach them, and instruct them what way leads to the perfection of honor
and true glory; and indeed none can be more willing to set them an example,
than He; and none more desirous to follow such a Leader, than they; they being
proud in such a Pattern, and He joyful in them.

Oh who can measure the happiness of that Kingdom, where the Prince is so
accomplished in the parts of his body and endowments of mind? in whose actions
all his followers may read whole Lectures of Ethics and Morality; And thrice
fortunate is that Prince, all whose Nobles strive to be his pictures, and
every one desires and strives to have nearest resemblance, and to be drawn
to the life, according to his pourtraicture: each of them rejoices to be the
shadow of such a substance, and to be like the creature which is is so like
the Creator.

Here is no treason plotted, no insurrections made by them, but all those which
do truly fear and love God, do truly fear and love their Sovereign. Happily
indeed, before they were acquainted with his virtues, and the light of his
royal worth shined amongst them, they might attempt some thing unworthy of
themselves, nay base in the highest degree, as to be the death of Him which
gave life to so many, and with the pulling down of the Primus Motor, ruin all
the inferior orbs of our Kingdom; but when they saw that his virtues made
God his Friend, it was in vain for them to be his enemies; for all their
treacherous attempts were but as sowing the shore, or washing a Blackmoore,
labor in vain.

It is folly for Balaam to curse Israel, when God blesses him; and for them to
ruin, when God preserves; in so much, as now his government pleases the
Romish Catholics, whom formerly their palates distasted; and all our Nobles
(if their bad consciences do not infringe that title) do honor Him, and
bear a most affectionate respect to all his Posterity, especially our royal
Prince, whom all our Nobles labor in all their actions to please and imitate.

Oh blessed Kingdom, where the Nobility does so affect the Prince, and the
Prince does so much respect the Nobilite, and both of them are in love with
virtue; where the Peers are so peerless in their courtesy, love to their
Kingdom, and loyalty to their King; who are never more happy, than when they
undertake some enterprise for the happiness of both; who are not servants to
servile fear, but Master-peeces of valor; so that they are as much feared
abroad, as favored and honored at home: and how can they want honor, so long
as our King and Prince, to whom true honor is due, honor them? Or happily, if
they should (as they never do) neglect to respect them, yet then own virtues
would, in silence, speak them worthy; who are so wisely valiant, that they
will not refuse to hazard their lives, for the safety of their Country; their
estate, for the preservation of a limb; nor the cutting off of a limb, for
the welfare of the whole body, who, though they can actiuely suffer prines, to
prevent other dangers which would passiuely fall upon them, yet they will not
submit themselves to any base kind of misery. No surely, they know valor is
virtue, and virtue has ever more her limits: and therefore, as the Eagle
preyeth not upon flies, so they which are nobly bred, and have their great
birth seconded with good education, scorn to aim at atchieuements of small
import; but shoot at high marks of great consequence. Some of them valiantly
defend the walls (as I may so term them) of their Country, lest their enemies
too near approach, might make their Country too near a ruin. Others, like
Hercules, do not stick to forsake their native soil; their wives, their
children, their lands and their possessions, to seek for honor in a foraigne
Country, and restore the wronged to their right; to revenge a Prince, great in
his virtues, though mean in his fortunes, his fortunes not so mean by birth,
but by oppression; oppression of a Tyrant usurping his Dominions; Dominions,
the which I cannot name, nay not so much as think on, but it forces brinish
tears, forced and banished from a grieved heart, to see Religion so defaced, a
Country so dispeopled, the people so massacred and murdered. Then on, brave
Britains Heroes, run in your intended course, and being pricked on with
valor, continue until you come to your iournies end; that so future ages may
erect Trophies to the eternal memories of your famous names, that children yet
unborn may say; These were the Worthies, by whose means a desolate Country
was repeopled, a wronged Prince relieved, an oppressing Tyrant discomfited.
Consider, oh ye truly ennobled, the cause of the war, the justness of the
cause, the virtue of the Prince, the rare perfections of his Spouse, the
hopefulnesse of their Issue, the near affinity they have with your
Sovereign, being derived and propagated from his loins; the consanguinitie
with your Prince: and surely, these motives cannot choose but inflame you with
courage, and accend your fury to make you fight valiantly, and conquer
victoriously, the enemies of him, who is a favorer and follower of your true
religion, a Son to your Sovereign, a Brother to your Prince, a friend to you
all.

But alas, what a needless thing it is to cast a drop into the Ocean? or to
add a spark to the fiery region? My words are but as wind, to blow the fire
which is sufficiently kindled; for I, and all this Realm and Dominion with me,
are verily and really persuaded, that your valor is at so high a pitch, it
cannot be raised higher; such be our Nobles, and therefore fit objects for
such a Princess, who though her sex will not permit her to be an actor, yet her
noble mind does incite her: and no doubt she cannot choose but delight to see
her Court composed of nothing but such undaunted and courageous Captains, who
though they be most affable and courteous in Court, yet they are most terrible
and courageous in combat. I doubt not, but it is a delectable spectacle to see
your brave Martiallists, as Caesar, Pompey, Alexander, and such like, though
painted, and that not unto the life; for time has wasted and worn out the
true pictures of them. But in these your Nobles, most illustrious Princess,
you may see them all living: for if virtue can make one like, there is none
suruiuing has a nearer resemblance to them, than your noble Servants, and
obseruant Nobles have of them. Is it the care of their Country, which we
should make the subject of our comparison? the Public good has been
respected of them, more than their private commodity; They know they are not
borne to themselves only, but to the benefit of the place in which they have had
birth and being. This is their resolution in general, but give me leave: As
the whole Kingdom is bound by duty and gratitude, to nominate some
particulars, as he, who is the Favorite of God, his King, Prince, and
Country, the Duke of Buckingham, who is not so styled unworthily, for he does
truly deserve it: Has he not been loyal to our Sovereign? And whereas other
subjects, which have been (though never thus) advanced, have sought to fly
too high upon the waxen wings of ambition, higher than either modesty or his
Majesty permitted; he never rose higher than it pleased the King to lift him:
so that he has gained more honor by his honesty and virtue, than the King
could give him by his means; for goods may be given by an earthly Sovereign,
but grace is an effect of a higher power, coming immediately from God; the
King might prefer him, but it was God only could make him humble in his
performances, the which he has always been, showing no less loyal
affection to the King, than loving affection to his kindred. But look into his
love which he bears to our Prince, and you shall find him to be as a
faithful Jonathan unto our righteous David; in all his travel and troubles,
how constantly did he attend on Him, being almost as inseparable an Adiunct to
his Highness, as heat to the fire, or light to the Sun? being as Ruth to
Nahomi, ready to go whither soever He went. Neither did his person only, but
his care accompany Him, watching continually lest any treason might be
plotted against Him, lest any trap might be laid to ensnare Him, lest any
subtle Serpents (as those hot Countries are full of them) might sting Him. It
was he that took the least disgrace done unto the Prince, more heavily and
hainously, than the greatest indignity could be offered unto himself. It was
he which discerned all the politic proceedings of Spain; and it is he
(under God) to whom we owe eternal gratitude, for the welfare of this our
Kingdom, and the people are perpetually bound for this their prosperity: and
I doubt not, but those, who are not like Swine, (which eat the acornes under
the tree, but never look up to the tree from whence they fall) do most
worthily acknowledge, and heartily affect that most Illustrious Duke, for his
tender and zealous love, both of his Princes safety, and Countries good.

Truth it self speaks it, and therefore who but the enemies of Truth can
oppose it? that promotion neither comes from the East, nor the West, but
only from the Lord. Moreover, the hearts of Kings are in the hands of God, to
turn them at his pleasure: and it is as far from doubt, as Heaven from Hell,
that indeed our King has honored you, but it was by Gods appointment; He has
preferred you, but it was by Gods directions, and God directed Him to advance
you, that you might benefit this Country, in being an Instrument, to find out
the intendments of Spain, as also to further this blessed Contract with
France; and I dare say, or (if my word may not be taken) I can produce millions
of witnesses, to testify and depose, that the gaping earth, after a long
parching drought, did never more acceptably entertain a lively shower, than
the British Nation this Union. Neither was ever the dew of Hermon, distilling
upon the Hill of Sion, more welcome to it, than this happy and hopeful
Conjunction to us. Neither let me omit to render, in the behalf of our
Contrymen, all possible thanks to my Noble Lord of Doncaster, who has so
well and worthily behaved, and carried himself, in the effecting of this
blessed Confederation, as in making this Match, and effecting this Contract,
he has robbed multitudes of their souls, and won the hearts of all the
people; for should he live never so long, and all his life time study, and
ever study effectually, and all his studies should be wholly to benefit his
Country, he could never have excogitated a means more likely, to bring whole
showers of all kind of Blessings upon these Kingdoms, than this, whereby
England is joined to France, and France to England; the most fertile Countries
of the world are joined together, with the kisses of peace and amity. To you
therefore, most Noble Lord, as the Conduit by which means God has conveyed
this happiness, we present our well wishes. For who is it, but you, most
Honored Lord, to whom we are more indebted, than to your care, for the
finishing of this Union? It was the eyes of your Indgement, which foresaw what
prosperity it would bring to the Prince, and what happiness it would bring to
England, to have (her Lions adorned with Frances Lillies, and the Flower-Deluce
and the Rose bound up, and conjoined. What bed so sweet, as that which is
composed of Lillies and Roses? What kisses more delightful, than when they are
linked together? And what Contract could have been more consolatorie, than this
of France and England? To you therefore, Great Britain sends the best of her
wishes, to attend you, and most powerful prayers to guard you, and preserve
you from all perils, that you may live to do God glory, and your Country
good, in performing many profitable offices unto it.

Here then, if it please France and this most Royal Lady, to take but a
survey of the incomparable excellency of the Peers and Nobles, by whom She
shall be attended in Great Btittaine, She shall happily, and to her great
comfort and content, understand, that She shall shine like Phoebe in this our
Orb, environed round about with these glorious stars and resplendent lights,
the Nobles of our Kingdom.

But to the end they may conceive and consider of their happiness, Capape (as
I may so say) and weigh but the worth of our Commons and vulgar sort of people,
in this our Island, it will soon, appear, that even in the lowest sort of
people, they shall find highest degrees of happiness: First, in regard of the
mutual affection which is likely to be between Her and our Nation, whether it
be for ne^^^nesse of blood, or aequiparancie of conditions.

Moses, when he saw the two Jews at dissension one with another, he could
excogitate no means more forcible to move them to reconcilement, than reducing
their affinity to their remembrance, telling them they were brethen: then
surely, ought there not to be great affection between the two famous Nations
of the British and the French, since there is so much affinity? Yes surely;
and to the end that there may be (as there ought to be) eternal concord, let
us remember we are brethren, and of the same blood.

For there be very few in England, who either directly from their Fathers and
Progenitors, or indirectly by some contract, have not some of the French blood
lodged in their bosoms. And if we examine the dispositions of either Nation,
we shall find them not like Jacob and Esau, or Caine and Abel, of opposite
qualities; but we shall see an absolute agreement between them, in their
virtuous inclination and conditions.

Do we seek for valor? who of more perfect prowess, than the French and the
English? Who have been so often Combatants and Conquerours, both for their
Country and conscience, as France and England?

The French are true-hearted, never carrying two faces under one hood; but
deeming it rather cowardice, than true valor, to overcome by deceit and
policy, for the most part carrying their hearts at their tongues-end; and
though they speak not every thing which they know, yet they speak nothing
with their tongues, but that which they think in their hearts.

Our English are not deceitful and hypocritical, cooling their pottage and
warming their hands with the same breath; but their speeches are the mirrours
of their minds, in which you may see their intentions, and by their words you
may attain to the science of their conscience.

The French are upright and just, deeming it the loss of their worth not to
keep their word, and the most base seruility not to be their words Masters,
scorning fraud and truce-breaking, not seeking to rush upon another man's
possessions, or to encroach upon others Dominions.

The English are performers of that which they promise, proving the truth of
their words by the trial of their deeds, accounting it a deep wound to their
reputation, not to perform their promises; and that the lie deserves (more
than is in the Proverb) not only a stab, but damnation; they are content with
that which the Lord has allotted to them, and do not so much seek to offend
their neighbors, as to defend themselves.

In a word: Are the French affable, sober, wise, modest, temperate, pious,
prudent, courageous, constant, magnanimous, merciful, just? The English do
answer them in all these worthy qualities, and are full of courtesy in their
carriage, of sobriety in their countenances, of modesty in their behauiours,
of temperance in their diets, of piety in their religion, of prudence in their
practices, of courage in their combats and controversies, of constancy and
stayednesse in their affections, of magnanimity in their enterprises, of
mercy in pardoning those offenses which may possibly be forgiven, and of
Justice in punishing those offenses, which may not be permitted.

Therefore of a certainty, no earthly blessing is able to counteruaile your
happiness, whose Princess is combined and conjoined with our Prince; whose
people is so worthy, that He does not seem like a Royal Golden Pillar built
upon a Base of Lead, but a worthy Prince set over a worthy people. Happy
therefore is France in her company, happy the Princess in her command: They
extraordinarily fortunate, that they shall have commerce with a Nation, who
will not be to them as a strange people, of a differing disposition; but will
be of a correspondencie of condition with them: and happy She, that shall
have such subjects, so wise, so worthy, so just, so honest, that She may well
think this her Kingdom, to be a little Heaven, in which She sits as Queen,
and her Subjects as so many Saints.

Neither do the sweet-pleasing streams of joy and solace, flow only to
France from this fountain; but as the stomach, though it be the proper
resident place and receptacle of the meat, yet does not only feed and satisfy
it self; but likewise does nourish and content all the parts about it; so this
blessed Union, and sweet Conjunction, does not only benefit the particular
Countries, between whom it is made; but does likewise rejoice the neighboring
Nations, and the rest of the League and Confederacy. Cast but an eye upon
Venice, and there, even of one half blind, may be discerned, how all in
general applaud and laud it, infinitely rejoicing, that their Friends and
Confederates should be so fortunate; that England and France should be so
joined together, in the knot of true love and amity. From this Contractariseth
a hope of the vanquishing of their foes, and that by this means a happy
success shall accompany all their just enterprises against their enemies:
also, being mounted upon the wings of glory, they shall be seated upon the
necks of their subdued adversaries; and that such conquests shall follow this
Contract, and such victories these Nuptials, and the posterities of men now
living, and succeeding ages, shall see and say, It was the marriage of the
mighty Prince Charles, and the Lady Henrette Maria, which were the Parents
and Producers of Religions comfort, of the restoring of the wronged to their
right; for God, or the very day, in which Hymen's Rites were solemnized
between Them, did matchall good people to happiness, crowned Them with
victory, to the consolation of all true Christian Princes, friends to equity,
enemies of ambition, favorers and followers of virtue.

But if our intelligence travel a little lower, and you make recourse into the
Low Countries, no tongue is able to utter what they conceive, nor any pen
almost to write the joyous speeches they utter, for the confirmation of this
Contract, than which nothing could have been more desired, no news better
accepted: And whereas the speeches of the former Match did seem unto them as
hideous as Hell, and as terrible as Thunder, this is a lightning unto their
hearts; for now in stead of fears, they have friends on all sides, Allies and
Confederates, which are of will and power to assist them, and to make
resistance against their enemies. The former Match did seem unto them as a
storm of war, threatening to demolish the Architect of their welfare; this,
as a Calm of peace, promising security to their prosperity. Oh happy
Britain! in such a blessed Prince, who is by so much more fortunate, by how
much more He is a means to make others happy; and from whom can more
happiness be derived, than from our Prince? who clothes so many Kingdoms at
his Mariage-day, in robes of comfort, and gives to so many Commonwealths such
great favors, as never did any Potentate in former, nor is likely to do in
following time: who has lifted out of the mire of misery, so many drooping
hearts and discontented souls. Indeed, never was Marriage more hopeful than
this of these two most hopeful Princes, by the conjunction of which two
propitious Planets, in this our firmament of Christendom, it presageth the
sweet distillation of the drops of happiness, upon so many, especially the
Low Countries, whose Inhabitants are filled with heaped measure of mirth, for
this consolatorie, most joyful, and happy Conjunction. The famous Prince of
Orange, Grave as well naturally as nominally, as well really as titularly, who
is not only grave and to be honored for his years, but grave and to be
imitated for his virtues, being not only adorned with the gravity of his
head, but with the grace of his heart, does heartily praise the God of Heaven,
by whom all marriages, especially of Princes, be made, for constituting and
appointing this Contract, and crossing that which was pretended with Spain;
For that had laid his breast open to his enemies, it had been a way which had
led to the wasting of his Country; had it proceeded, he might have saluted it,
and said, as Ahab spoke to Eliah, Have thou found me, ob mine enemy? But he
may welcome this with the speech of David to Ahiah, He is a good man, and
brings glad tidings. Neither can it minister any small joy to the most
illustrious, Son of our most gracious Sovereign, the King of Bohemia, who
has along time been rackt upon the rack of hard misfortunes, and endured the
grimme looks of adversity; but now he hopes safely to sail in the Ocean of
pleasure, and to see the smiling countenance of Joy and Solace. He doubts
not, but now his noble affectionate Father, is not only powerful in his own
proper forces, but strong in Alliance, with that mighty potent French King,
who both of them being so puissant in means, men, money, and munition, so
sufficiently stored with wise grave Counselors to advise, with young able men
to act, and put their counsel in execution; They will join forces to reioyne
his detained Diadem to his head, and to restore Him to his Country and
Dignity.

This was the day likewise, which the only Sister of our prosperous mighty
Prince, and Daughter of the Imperial Majesty of our mighty Sovereign, so
long looked for, and so much longed for, in which She might have a Sister by
marriage, though not by birth, with whom She might make a mutual exchange of
entire affection, that She might find one true friend, that might be her
Sister, both in deed and virtue; that having found one so near Herself, so
like Herself, her joy might even almost exceed Herself; and who more fit to
be Sisters, than those who are so concording in virtuous conditions; the least
of whose rare exquisite perfections cannot be imitated by any, but by one
another; for who so modest, so bountiful, so beautiful, so chaste, so
constant, so wise, and every ways so worthy, as Elizabeth, but Henrette
Maria? all that they differ is in that which notwithstanding in either of Them
is a virtue; for the one is a chaste Matron, the other a pure Virgin; the one
the Mother, as well of many children, as of many holy deeds; the other, the
mother only of virtuous actions. The Almighty of his mercy grant, that as
She is her perfect Pattern in the one, so She may truly resemble Her, that
so She may be the happy Mother of many children, and He the fortunate
Father and Progenitour of many Princes, that She being like a fruitful Vine
upon the wall-side, his children may be like Olive Branches round about his
table; and that in his Posterity, not only his Highness, but all the world
may be happy; so also the Pfaltz-graues Princely Babes and hopeful Issue
rejoice, in regard all their Friends are not likely to decease with their
Parents, but that from their mighty Uncle Prince Charles his loins, shall
spring such Princely Sprigs, who will take their parts against all those, which
with an envious eye and a malicious mind behold their persons. For ever
therefore let this Contract be chronicled in the Register of Fame, which has
thus imposed an Epilogue to the doleful Tragedy, so passionately acted in the
bosoms of the Royll King and Queen of Bohemia, and has begun a Prologue to a
joyful Comedy, the beginning of which shall be war and bloody dissension,
but the last act contains the peace of the Church, the relief of the
oppressed, the ruin of Antichrist, and the advancement of Christian Religion.

Thus from these two most excellent Princes, spring tides of happiness,
ouerflowing many Countries; and good fortune, of which they are the Authors,
crowns many foreign Nations, but most especially this our Island, and all his
Majesty's of Great Britains Dominions.

For if we shall but behold France with the eye of mature judgment, we shall
find it stored with all kind of commodities fit for commerce and traffic,
being (as it were) Gods garden, in which He had planted all his blessings and
benefits; for what rare blessing is it not richly furnished with? as corn,
cattle, fish, foul, and all manner of fruit, either pleasing to the eye, or
delightful to the taste? whose soil is clothed in a green mantle, decked
and adorned with all kind of various, delectable, sense-delighting,
odoriferous flowers. Indeed no Kingdoms soil has more beauty and bounty
than France, no Country better situated, more abounding with excellent wits,
both in the time of war and peace, than France: there is no Kingdom
established with godlier Laws, no Monarchy more mighty, of authority more
absolute Sovereign, being a Kingdom so well fortified with power, and so well
qualified with piety: Indeed, never was the foundation of any Empire laid with
more wisdom; and being built, vpheld, and the ruins repaired with more
discretion than France. Do you inquire after the greatness of her Provinces?
They are like so many Kingdoms, yet all united in one Never were there any
Sovereigns of any Kingdoms, which have more constantly labored for the
propagation of the Gospel, and the planting of Religion, than the French
Kings, who have made clean the floor of Christen dome, swept away so much
filthiness, and diuerted that great Deluge of Infidels, which threatened
shipwreck to the French Nation; from whence they have their deserved titles of
most Christian Kings. What worthy men, yea and most excellent Kings, has
France produced? of whom we may truly report, that they were most valiant in
war, most wise in counsel, carrying themselves not insultingly in their
prosperity, nor yet deiectedly in their adversity; but being almost conquered
in show, they became Conquerours in effect; and when they were most in
despair, yet never despaired of the Commonweal; who, as they manifested great
love to their subjects, so their subjects expressed great love and affection to
them.

Do you search who were the Ancestors of the French, and inquire after the
original of that Nation, you shall find them neither in the ruins and ashes
of Troy, neither in the Fens of Moolides, but were principally descended from
them in Germany, a Nation mighty in strength and valor, who by defending
themselves, and succouring others, came to be a people powerful in Arms, who
still maintained their liberty with their sword, from whence they were called
by the other Germans France, which signifies free, or rejecting servitude and
bondage.

And it may be spoken truly and without flattery, that never Kingdom might
better boast of so many worthy Princes as this may; As Pharamond, the first
Layer of the Foundation of this Monarchy; Clodion his Successor in this
building; Meroued the Continuer, and Augmenter of the Edifice; Clouis, whose
memory is to be reverenced of all posterity, and whose worthy deeds are to
be had in an everlasting remembrance, as being the first that added Christian
religion to others conquests, and adorned that rare foundation with the faith
of Christ, the primest ornament of any Principality, by which means the
hearts of the Gauls (who for the most part embraced the Gospel) were as much
united to him by favor, as his was to God by faith; who by this means
obtained from them voluntary obedience, and was made assured possessour of the
others victories, who likewise received the name of his new Dominions, and were
called by the name of France.

To omit that renowned Prince, Charlemaigne who being enriched with singular
gifts, both of body and mind, repaired the ruin of the Empire, and was
confirmed King of France, and Emperor of Rome, to the great advancement of
Religion, and comfort of the Commonwealth; whose issue, although it did not
always inherit, either their Fathers valor or his honor; yet God, who though
He may alter the persons, yet still guardeth and guides the state of
Monarchies, did raise up a worthy Successor of that Race, to wit, Hugh Capet,
a Prince adorned both with wisdom and modesty, joining wholesome Laws to his
force of arms, and well-gouerned equity to his authority, did so ouercast
this erected Kingdom with such, both godly and goodly Ordinances, as it
withstood the storms of many miserable ages.

And of late years, Henry the fourth, the prime Prince of the blood, and
first King of the Royal Race of Burbon, a Prince endowed with all gifts and
rare qualities, requisite for the restoring of a Kingdoms sick and languishing
estate, to the former health and happiness: who succeeding Henry the third,
the last of the Royal Race of Valois, who was slain by a Iacobine, in the
Crown and Dignity of a King, found the Kingdom pestered with so many
pestilent evils, which was like a body surfetted and weakened with all kind of
diversity of diseases, surcharged with melancholy, and diverse other bad
humors, which did so contend for predominancie, as it was full of intestine
broils and civil dissentions, the which being fed with choler of the people,
did daily threaten the overthrow and destruction of the whole Continent, if God
had not in time sent that good Physician, Henry the fourth, whose might and
mildness composed such wholesome medicines and rare remedies, for the recovery
of his Kingdoms welfare, that by his valor he encountered his enemies, and
reduced his distracted and almost destroyed subjects, to their dutiful
obedience; in so much; as his most gracious government was likely to have
brought that Kingdom to a most peaceable and prosperous estate, if a cursed
cruel murderer had not imposed an untimely end by an unfortunate stab to his
life, and by consequence to his government, with whose life the present
prosperity of the Kingdom was ended, in regard He left none to weild his
Scepter, but his Son, then Daulphine, now King, Lewis, whose tender years,
though they promised much, yet they could perform very little in the ruling
of such a mighty Nation: But God, who is evermore a Father of the fatherless,
and a Husband to the Widow, became a mighty Protector of this fatherless
Country, still preserving it from all perils, guarding the Daulphine from all
dangers, till at length, He attaining to the ripeness of years and virtues,
was fit to be the Governor of such a Kingdom; in so much, as now it may be
truly styled, The most flourishing and fortunate Commonwealth in
Christendom: Then what better or fitter amity, than between Nations and
People so faithful, and two Countries so fruitful, as France and Britain?
What greater likelihood can there be of love, than between men so like in
qualities, as the French and English, and two Countries so rich as France and
England?

It is an ancient approved Maxim in Philosophy. Simile simili gaudet, The
like rejoices in the like; and it is as received an axiom in Morality,
Amicitia debet esse inter aequales: For if a rich man be in the bond of
friendship with a poor man, their love is not likely to be of any long
continuance; for the want of the one will weary the good will of the other,
and like Pharaohs kine, the lean ones will eat up the fat.

But when two fertile Kingdom, which are the Palaces of Ceres, and Temples of
Bacchus, shall join together, it is not only likely to be great for the
quantity, but durable for the time, when as they shall not only have the
interchanges of peace, but also of plenty, when as neither of them shall
impouerish, but both of them jointly enrich each other.

This is the joy of our most mighty, wise, inuict Monarch, King James, who is
as well the father of his Country England, as of his Son Prince Charles, who
cannot choose but rejoice to see his Country so well matched to a Kingdom so
commodious and profitable. There is no father but desires and ioyeth to see
his daughter wealthily bestowed upon one of equal worth and means; then well
may his Royal Person rejoice at this Marriage of his Kingdom, which has found
a Mate so powerful, so plentiful, so abounding with all riches, so enriched
with all benefits, as France.

Does He desire peace? it is able in the time of peace to send Him rich
commodities out of her storehouse. Does He desire war? what is wanting there
to maintain it? It is populous for men, powerful for money, plentiful for
provision; there are men to be procured for money, money for men, and
sustenance to be had for money, that nothing might be wanting, requisite for
the upholding, for the beginning or continuance of a just war: Then how is
England for ever obliged to the Almighty, who has thus directed our King,
thus affected our Prince to choose and select so blessed a Princess, in so
happy a Country, which is the fertile Mother of such excellent wits, which is
the Continent of such affable, debonaire, and courteous people, a rich
Fountain From whence all necessary benefits flow to neighboring Nations,
which wants neither a fat fruitful soil to yield increase, nor laborious,
painful, industrious men to till it, which has been the seat of so many
mighty, wise, valiant, unconquered Monarchs.

Oh happy Britain! which though thou were most happy in thy self, yet (if
it be possible) art more than most happy in such a Sister, which is the Palace
of pleasure, and the Mansion-place of delight, which sends all rare
delicates, as gifts unto thy People; and the rarest Gemme of Nature, the most
exquisite Fruit that ever that Country could make it self or other Countries
happy in, The Lady Henrette Maria, to thy Prince, whose virtues show
themselves to the life, more to the eyes of all, than the most perfect
eloquence is able to declare them to the ears of any; who, in her virginity,
was wedded to Virtue, and is now marched with the most virtuous Prince that
ever lived; who for virtue, parentage, education, proportion, and portion,
stands as a matchless Mirror to all her sex, and no whit unworthy of such a
Husband.

Consider but her virtues, and you will say, and yet speak nothing but that
which you think, that She is rather an Angel sent from Heaven, for to be a
Miracle and Oracle of her time, for all to admire, than borne of mortal seed,
for any to imitate; in whom wisdom sits in her perfection, and all to make Her
perfect, whose words are all weighed in the balance of consideration in her
mind, before they be vented by her lips; for She knows words are like time,
once past, they cannot be recalled, and howsoever the tongue be an unruly
evil, and that evil most predominant in a woman; yet She deeming it most
unworthy to command others, and not to command Her self, always
premeditating of whom, to whom, where and what She speaks; and as She suffers
not her tongue to be the key of her minds closet, where silence is a virtue;
so She will not neglect to let her tongue be the testament of her mind,
where necessity enforces Thrice happy Kingdom at this instant, in which
there is such a Princess extant, so fully accomplished with such rare virtuous
qualities: It is She, whose chastity does challenge the superiority of all
her Ancestors, and stands as a Pattern to future ages, whose heart never
harbored the least thought of uncleanness, whose Iuorie Alablaster Soul has
not been touched or tainted with the least impuritie can be imagined; but, from
her infancy, has been the undefiled Temple of Diana; whose harmless heart
has evermore walked clothed in a white spotless robe of matchless
innocence, and has been hurtful to none, except it has been in being too
merciful; and if She has done any injury, it has been in doing good to
those which never deserved it: She is free from the oppression of the
fatherless, or wronging the widow, free from the effusion and pouring out of
innocent blood; her hands were never imbrued in the purple die of infants gore.
And thus being guarded with the armor of proof of innocence, She walks
secure, dreadlesse of danger; for neither do needless fears in the time of
her watching, surprise Her; nor horrid dreams of danger, in her sleep,
affright Her; for her innocence does evermore secure Her.

Neither may her patience be passed over in silence, who heiring her Father in
his spirit (as if He had left Her his good Genius, as part of her Dowry) is
resolute beyond her sex, in bearing adversities; and all afflictions, which
time in the whole course of her life has inflicted upon Her, have been
entertained like snow upon the ground, without any noise or murmuring; Religion
and Discretion did inform Her, that the more patiently She took her
punishment of her Heavenly Father, the more gently He would correct Her; and
She deemes it mere madness, with the fish, to leap out of the pan of
misery, into the fire of impatience; or to seek to withstand that which She
could not avoid: therefore in all those sicknesses and afflictions, which God
either for trial, or otherwise, has inflicted upon Her, She has behaved
Herself with such meekness, such mildness, and yet such courage of Spirit,
as we may truly say, She has been Gods Patient in all her miseries: if She
were sick in the highest degree, yet her comfort was, She could not be
sicker: and thus, though potions could not help her body, yet patience did
cure her soul, and (like a rare extraordinary Bird) She sung in a stormy
tempest, being not only thankful and praising God for his blessings on the
right hand, but her afflictions on the left, and welcomming all her crosses
with such sweet embracements, as they had not the heart to stay long with such
a friend, that gave them such kind entertainment, and good welcome.

Neither may her humility be forgotten, who makes it Gentleman-usher for her
Honor, esteeming that honor cannot follow except humility goes before; She
knows it is the Basis upon which all other virtues are erected, and that pride
is a great disgrace, even in the greatest Potentates: To see a poor dejected
miserable man, which is low and cast down in estate, low in mind, it is no
wonder; but to see one high in honors and preferment, humble in spirit, it is
a strange raritie: And it is most true, that as there is nothing more odious in
the sight of God, than a poor man proud; so there is no sight more acceptable
to his All-seeing Eye, than to see one which is mighty, mean in his own
opinion: But such is this honored, yet humble Lady, who though She be laden
with honors, riches, and virtues, yet like a fertile Plant, by how much more
it is enriched with fruit, by so much nearer it bows to the ground: So this
Illustrious Princess, by how much more God has advanced Her to dignities, by
so much more She does honor Him by humility.

And to the end that She might walk safely between two extremes, and
absolutely attain to the golden mean; as She is not prone to pride, so She
is void of baseness; She does not altogether forget the greatness of her
birth, but through the remembrance of it, is incited to goodness of life; She
holds it the highest indignity, and the greatest unworthiness that may be, to
be superior to any in birth or place, and to be inferior to them in grace and
virtue. And thus striving to exceed, She is beyond compare, and good in the
superlatiue, the which (howsoever Herself does more look on the defects in
her laboring to mend them, than those perfections which cannot be bettered,
whiles her divine soul is shadowed with this veil of mortality, and deprived
of the freedom in this prison of flesh) yet She would have others see her
virtues, not in a foolish vainglory, but a religious piety, that others by
her good example might be the more stirred to the practice of virtuous
actions, and that men seeing her good works, might glorify her Father which is
in Heaven, and as She does holily desire that they might see her virtuous
disposition and pious qualities, so She does wisely labor to cover her
infirmities, and to bury in oblivion her (if there be any in Her)
imperfections. She considers She is set upon a hill, and has many eyes upon
Her, and that which is but a moat in another eye, is a beam in hers; that
infirmity which is but a scratch to another credit, is a wound to her
reputation; She observes also, that as her weaknesses are eminent, so they are
dangerous: For if the King holds his neck awry, all the Subjects will imitate
Him; if the Tutour stammers, the Scholar will scarce speak plain, and vulgar
people think it their greatest perfection to imitate their Prince, although it
be in their imperfections; She therefore, to prevent that which might be
anywayes prejudicial to her underlings, endeavors to be as perfect as may be,
and to hide that in which She is imperfect. But that I may be constant in her
praises, let me likewise commend her constancy; for whereas other women are
like the Moon, ever changing, and in one instant loathing that which they
loved, having the eyes of their affection not fixed upon one certain object,
but having their minds drunk with the variety of affections, they reele here
and there, and their heads being sick of the staggers of inconstancy, they
are indeterminate in all their proceedings. She, on the contrary, being sober
and stayed in her fancy, loves only One, and will never leave to love Him:
Light substances, as feathers, shittle-cocks, and such like, are moved with
every puff, or the least blast of wind; but creatures more ponderous and
precious, as your Diamond, Rubie, Carbuncle, and Saphyr, are not removed out of
the place where they rest, but by violence; and howsoever they be harder to
find, yet it is not so easy to lose them. Some women do love ad libitum, and
can find no center of their desires; but, like your straw, are so accendible,
as the least puff will set their affections on flaming, and kindle their
desires; but alas, as they are soon in, so they are soon out: It is an easy
matter, in every place, to meet with such light stuff, but it is difficult to
find Diamonds, whose affections are well balanced, and whose fancies are of
long continuance: But such is this Princess, so stayed, so sober, so constant,
so Penelope-like, whom many may woo, but none can win from Ulysses, who
though She may have many pleaders for Her, yet non-suites them all but One;
being so divine a Creature, as in her affection, She resembles her Creator;
who, whom He loves, He loves to the end. The beams of her love, as they be
most bright, so they are of long continuance, being no ways wavering, nor
speedily fading, but constant and durable. Neither is She constant in her
affections only, but also in her virtuous actions; for what virtue more
natural or necessary in a Prince, than liberality? and who more liberal
than She? Her bounty, like the Sun, shines upon all She sees; She knows
none are more miserable, than they which are miserably covetous, who starve in
a Cooks shop, pine in the midst of plenty, who, Tantalus-like, have golden
apples above, and Crystal Fountains beneath his chin; but yet, can neither
taste the apples, to satisfy his hunger, nor touch the water, to allay his
thirst. She therefore, holding it a thing inconvenient, to command others, and
not to command her passions and her purse; She therefore esteeming riches, but
the exiles of Fortune, the which She can keep no longer, because She must
part from them, does liberally and freely give to such, whose either earnest
petitions, or silent deserts, do plead for them: For reason teaches Her, that
they are given Her only to give to others; therefore, with most incomparable
bounty, and yet discretion, She does bestow them; and like the Heavens, being
full, She powers and showreth down the dew of her pity, upon the gaping
necessity of poor people: She well remembers, that the faithfullest friends
She can make, are her charitable deeds; for her goods leave Her at her death,
nothing we brought, and nothing we must carry away: Her Friends and Allies
forsake Her at her grave, they may accompany Her to her tomb, but they will
not dwell with her in darkness; but her almesdeeds and pious actions follow
Her, saying unto her soul, as Ruth to Nahomi, Whithersoeuer thou go, I Will
follow thee. It is that which moves Her to show such piety in her pity, that
makes Her a Prop to the poor, a Staff to the needy: It is from hence, that
the blessings of the Lord do still accompany Her, She is so much favored of
Him, because virtue is so much favored in Her; and it is as far from doubt, as
truth from falsehood, that She shall be the most fortunate, most blissful and
happy Princess, that ever was extant in this Christian world.

Thus have you seen her virtues in some part deciphered, though not to the
full described; for that were as impossible to contain her praises (who,
though She be young in years, yet is old in Grace) in this small volume, as
to confine the boundless Ocean to a cesterne.

But because howsoever Virtue is true Nobility, yet Nobility is an ornament
to Virtue; examine but her Princely Parentage, which is lineally descended from
so many Kings and Emperors, never was Branch sprung from a more Regal,
Imperial, and Royal Stock, than She; therefore not to make any troublesome
search into ancient Chronicles, but to look into those later modern times, it
will appear, that never had child greater cause to joy in a father, than this
Princess in hers, whose Father Henry the fourth, of the royal Race of
Burbon, a Prince so truly, fully, and nobly accomplished, as He deserves to
be styled the Worthiest of the French Monarchy; for finding the Kingdom
fraught with hatred, rebellion, infidelity, treason, and such like; but He,
by his moderate and discreet government, like a wise Husbandman of that his
vineyard, rooted out those enormious weeds, planting in stead of them, love to
his Person, submission to his Sovereignty, faithfulness to his Crown, and
loyalty to his Government; and howsoever some did so far oppose Him, as they
sought to depose Him, yet He being directed and protected by a Higher Power, in
spite of all humane violent oppositions, did triumph, both over domestique and
foreign foes, and France may confess truly, and without flattery, that she
languished with the want of such a Prince, until He, like another Hercules,
did ruin and root out those hideous monsters, which did seem prodigious to
her own proper progeny, and restored France to her former reputation, and
crowned her with her pristine beauty. It is He whose acts may stand to
instruct Captains their duties in succeeding ages. It is He that was like
David in his reign, full of afflictions and blessings, that resembled Him in
his zeal of piety and justice (the prime and principal pillars of a
Royalty) who ruled his people happily, to the glory of God, the good of his
Subjects, and the consolation of his own Soul. Indeed, infinite were the
virtues of this royal Prince, who succeeded his famons Ancestors, who were so
worthy, as they may add glory to his immortal fame and memory: For He was
lineally descended, in direct masculine and lawful line of Lewis, for his
singular piety, surnamed Saint, the 44th. French King, whose quiver was full
of such arrows, as David calls blessings, to wit children, as Philip the
Hardy, his Successor in the Crown, Peter Earl of Alancon, Robert Earl of
Alancon, through Peter's untimely decease, and also Robert the eldest and the
youngest, were fortunate in leaving Issue, in whom they might live after their
deaths; the other died without heirs sprung from their own loins. The Issue
of the forenamed Philip the Hardy succeeded lineally, until Henry the third,
King of France and Poland, in whom the name and family of the Valor being
extinct, the Crown fell to the Race of Robert Earl of Cleremont, who by
Beautrix, sole heir and daughter of Archibald Earl of Burbon, had Lewis
afterward created Duke: The which Lewis Duke of Burbon, had Issue by Marie,
daughter to John the eighteenth Earl of Hainhault, had Peter Duke of Burbon,
and James Earl of Ponthieu, Constable of France: Peter had by Isabel, daughter
of Charles Earl of Valois, Lewis and James; Lewis surnamed the Good Duke of
Burbon, had by Anne, Countess of Auergne, Lewis Earl of Cleremont (deceasing
without Issue) John and James; John had by Bonne, Duchess of Auergne and
Countess of Montpensiere, Charles, and Lewis of Montpensiere, father of
Gilbert, of whom issued Charles the last Duke of Burbon; the which Charles Duke
of Burbon, had by Agnes daughter of John Duke of Burgoigne, John and Peter;
John the second of that name was linked in marriage with Ioane of France,
daughter to Charles the seventh, who dying without lawful Issue, the name and
arms of Duke went to Peter his younger brother: Peter the second of that name
Duke of Burbon, married Anne of France, daughter to Lewis the deuenth, and had
Issue by her, one only daughter, Susan the general heir of Bourbon, who was
wife to the abouenamed Charles the youngest son of Lewis abouenamed, Earl of
Montpensiere, and brother to Charles Duke of Burbon; but no children issuing
from this marriage, the branch of the eldest son of Lewis Duke of Burbon was
broken off, and ended in this Charles Duke of Bourbon and Constable of France,
who died at the siege of Rome. Now the Duchy of Bourbonois being incorporated
into the Crown of France, it fell to the line of James of Ponthieu Constable
of France, they youngest son of Lewis Duke of Bourbon, the which James had by
Ioane daughter of the Earl of St. Paul, John his Successor Earl of La March;
John had of Catherine, the only daughter and heir of John Earl of Vendosme,
James King of Naples, who leaving no Issue Male, the right of inheritance was
transported to Lewis the younger brother; Lewis had no Issue by Jane of Russy
his first wife, but by his second marriage he had John his Successor and Earl
of Vendosme: John the second had by Iean of Beauire, Francis his Successor and
Earl of Vendosme, and Lewis Prince of La Roch Syr-you, who of Louise of
Bourbon, the daughter of Gilbert of Bourbon, left Lewis of Bourbon Earl of
Montpensiere, you was father to Francis Duke of Bourbon, and Earl of
Montpensiere, who was father to Henry last Duke of Montpensiere, Prince of
Dombos, Daulphine of Auergne, Lieutenant General for the King in Normandy,
and husband to Catherine Henrette of Ioyeuze, a Prince so famous for all
virtues, as he was admired of all. To Francis were borne, by Marie of
Luxenburg, Countess of St. Paul, and daughter of Peter of Luxenburg, Charles,
Earl; but created Duke of Vendosme, by King Francis the first. Francis Earl
of St. Paul, who by Adrian Duchess of Esterhout ville, had Francis, who died
young, Lewis Cardinal of Bourbon, Antoniette wife to Claude of Lorraine Duke
of Guise, also Louis Abbas of Fonteuaraux. Charles the first Duke of Vendosme,
had by Louis the daughter of Rene Duke of Alancon, Lewis, who died at the age
of seven years; Anthony, who succeeded in his right, and was afterward King
of Navarre; Francis Earl of Anghien; Charles, Cardinal Archbishop of Rouan;
John, who lost his life at the battle of St. Quintin; and Lewis Prince of
Conde. Anthony the Successor of Charles first Duke of Vendosme, and King of
Navarre, had by Ioane of Albret Queen of Navarre (daughter to Henry the second
of that name, King of Navarre) Henry the fourth of that name French King, as
his Fathers Successor, and the third of that name King of Navarre, by the
right of his Mother. This is the Royal Root from whence this Princely Branch
is sprung, which shows the nobleness of her descent: so that as She graceth
her parentage by her virtues, so They grace Her by her birth: For howsoever
wine be good out of a wooden dish, yet we esteem it better, if we drink it
out of a golden vessel: So howsoever virtuous noble personages, though ignobly
borne, ought to be respected, yet those which have virtue joined with their
nobility of birth, are worthy of double honor: Then who more to bereuerenced
in our hearts, extolled in our speeches, than this noble, and neuer-enough to
be honored Lady? who is descended by the fathers side, from Henry the
fourth, French King, who no whit unworthy of his famous renowned Ancestors,
added luster to their former glory, who respecting the Commonwealth more than
Himself, indeed only loving Himself, because He loved the Commonwealth, was
not only the Father of his Country, but also of the peace and tranquillity
of his Kingdom.

But perhaps some will say, the child is not always the inheritour of the
fathers worth: For neither the soul nor the virtues of it come by propagation,
and the only juice we draw from our parents loins, is their infirmities.
Moreover, though the child has not often the fathers wisdom, yet for the
most part it has the mothers wit, will, and affections. Do but search
Chronicles and Histories for her mothers virtues, and you shall find Her before
her marriage, the most virtuous Virgin; after her marriage, so worthy a Matron,
as Heaven could joy in, or earth be proud of: To speak her virtues in
particular, were a burden heavier than Aetna; to pass them over in general,
were a wrong to her perfections; to undertake to write of them severally, were
pride in my pen; and to speak of them, but jointly and briefly, were an
argument of poverty of invention. To avoid therefore both these enormities,
let it be my ambition, to use that commendations of Her, at her entertainment
and arrival in France, formerly uttered by Monsieur du Varais, who making an
Oration to Her, in which he seemed to build the whole felicity of France,
upon her marriage with the King, he praises her perfections in these words.

Seeing in you so many graces, wherewith Nature has endowed you, admiring the
beauty wherewith she has adorned you, considering that natural sweetness
wherewith she has tempered your royal gravity, and hearing with our ears
the voice renowned by fame, which proclaims the quickness of your spirit, the
soundness of your judgment, the eloquence of your discourse, and that which
exceeds all, the incomparable commendation of your holy and religious
disposition; we persuade our selves that you are She, whom the Heavens had
appointed by your pleasing company, to mollify the life of the King, to
prolong his days by his content, and to make his reign perpetual, by the
continuance of a great and happy posterity. We believe that you are only
She upon earth, worthy to make the life of the most triumphant King in the
world, to rest in your chaste bosom; and that He, above all others, did merit
to embrace the most virtuous and pleasing Princess in his victorious arms.
Whereby we presage we shall soon see a number of goodly children carrying in
their foreheads their fathers valor, their mothers virtue, the greatness and
ability of the house of France, whereunto you are allied, the happiness and
power of the house of Austria, from whence you are issued, and the wisdom of
Florence, in which you were borne. To the belief of this presage all things
seem to inuit us, but chiefly the Heaven and the Sea for we see at the
arrival of your Majesty, the Sea full of storms is grown calm, and the
Heaven ouercast with clouds is clear, as if they would, with a pleasing eye,
celebrate with us the magnificence of your reception. For in good time then, oh
great Queen, are you come into our coasts, long may you live happy in France,
and to France, that the age in which we live, may term you a happy wife to a
King, and future ages, a happy mother of Kings.

Here then you may discern the most excellent perfections of this most
excellent Princesses mother, who carried herself so submissiuely to her Lord
the King, that nothing was more dear or near unto Him, than Herself, so
lovingly and royally to her Subjects, that She won the hearts of all those,
whose souls and affections were sealed and delivered to her Majesty; so
worthily to her children, that not only by her instructions, but her example
(which children are most apt and ready to observe) She incited them to
goodness, having a diligent care, that good education might water those good
seeds of virtue and blessed endowments, which Nature had planted in them: For
howsoever the Root, from whence this royal Stem sprang, and the Father of this
Princess, had very short continuance in the wearisome pilgrimage of this
world (as who should say, the Heavens saw it not convenient, that he should any
longer live, when another came to be an Inheritrix of his virtues, and
Possessour of his perfections) whereby Shoe might seem to have some want of
her Progenitors care, to see Her brought up in all virtuous lore, necessary
or requisite for the accomplishment of so great a Princess, yet her mother,
and not only her mother, but her mothers care, still suruiuing and outliuing
her father, has so educated and nourished up this Princely Sprig (although
indeed of Herself, She was declining from all evil, and enclining to all
goodness) that She wanted nothing to make Her most excellent in all rare
virtues and qualities; for her religion having a principal care (as She
supposed that She should be instructed in the truth and Christian faith, the
which this mighty Queen professed, as Catholic and universal) in the which
howsoever there be some positions, like the Coloquintida in the Jews pot,
which spoileth all the pottage, as Justification by merits; Adoration of
Images, which cannot hear us; Prayer to Saints, which cannot help us; for the
dead, which cannot be helped; Purgatory, Mass, Absolution of sins to any,
though impenitent; yet notwithstanding there be many practices allowable, as
holy pious actions, in which She was taught to be abounding, as satisfaction,
if it may, be for offenses committed against our brethren, as frequent and
fervent prayer to God, to beautify our souls religious fasting, to mortify
our bodies; as continency (which many of the Romish Religion profess, but few
of their Friars, Monks, Nuns, or Jesuits practice) And truly She has been
wise hearted, and chosen the better part; for although by her mothers, supposed
good, though truly misconceiued opinion, She has been brought up in the
Romish Religion, yet like the industrious Be. And howsoever She might err in
some things, for want of true judgment, which cannot be expected in such
tender years, especially the semall sex, who are most ready to be seduced,
and to walk as their, leaders guide them, being most credulous, and the weaker
vessels, yet reason and charity may depose, that a Princess of such
ripeness of wit, and incomparable understanding, may easily be brought from
giving any internal worship with her heart, though She may external with her
body to any Image. Oh no; She scorns to worship a thing more base than any
of her basest servants; nay, of a lower condition than any of the meanest
living creatures; for the trees grow, and are clad in variety of garments,
having their summer and their winter suit, putting on in the Spring a vesture
of green, and in Autumn their gray clothing. Morcouer, the flowers of the
field are the work manship of God; and therefore certes, more excellent than
the child of man's industry and invention: but an Image has not power to
cloth in self, as the plants and, flowers, but is the effect of man's labor,
and is only clad in that array, the which the Painter has given it; the trees
increase and bring forth fruit for our sustenance, but an Image has only the
figure according to which the Caruer cut it, neither yields it any profit,
but dishonor to God, and destruction to them that honor it.

And if it be thus, much less then a vegetative, by how much less to be
esteemed than a sensitive creature; for they move, see, hear, taste, smell,
and feel; but an Image is void of motion, and without the help of others,
confined to the same mansion-place, blind and like Jacob, cannot see when
Joseph does him reverence, deaf cannot hear what thou speak, and in every
respect senseless: But how much inferior is it to man, yea even to the poorest
miserable mortal; for look upon his soul, it the Image of God his Maker;
look upon his body, and every organ performs its office, the eye sees, the
ear hears, the palate tafteth, the palm touches, the nose senteth, the foot
walks, the hand works, and that which is more, the heart understands.

And surely, if any thing but God were to be worshipped, it were this little
world, and yet great world of wonders, this masterpiece of Gods workmanship,
called Man. And surely, I deem it a less error with the ignorant Indians, to
worship the Sun and the Moon, for they are heavenly creatures; a smaller fault
in the Egyptians, to adore an onion, for that was their chiefest sustenance;
in the people of Israel, for he was a King, nay a God on earth, for so God
styles Princes, than to prostrate and cast down ones self to an Image: Far
be it therefore to commit such sacrilege to her sanctity, or that our
imaginations should rob Her of so much sense and saving knowledge, to suppose
that She will not be brought from the adoration of Images, if now She does,
or ever will adore a senseless block, a stock, or it may be indeed, She may
do it some outward reverence, as one may do to a picture, in the remembrance
of his friend, or in the respect they bear to him whom it represents. Neither
is it possible, but She will be instructed, that whosoever does trust to his
own merits, does rely upon a broken reed, and builds the houle of his
salvation, upon the sands of his own works, which is ready each moment to be
ruined with every stormy tempest of the Devils temptations; but he that does
build upon the Cornerstone and Rock Christ Jesus, his foundation being fast
and firm, his building is perpetual and everlasting: She, without doubt,
will consider, that the best of our deeds is sin, and the best of our deserts
damnation, that all our works are but as a menstruous cloth, stained with
impuritie; that when we have done all we can, we are but unprofitable
servants; and that although good works justify the faith, yet faith iustifies
the man, that though works prove faith to be living in the man, yet faith
proves the man to be living in Christ; that as faith without works is like the
barren fig tree, or like the wombes oi Sarah and Elizabeth, fruitless; so
works without faith are of no consequence.

Moreover, it is not to be believed, but that She will be brought to believe,
that prayers to Saints cannot ought avail Her, that when She prays unto them,
they have no ears to hear Her, or if they have ears to hear Her, yet it may
be they want hearts to pity Her; or if they have hearts to pity Her, yet they
want hands to help Her: She will easily therefore understand. that her
prayers ought to be directed to the Fountain of all goodness, the Giver of
all good gifts, that as He is her Lord for power, so He is her God for pity,
whose will is not frustrate for want of power, nor his ability unexercised for
want of will, but being omnipotent, He is omniuolent to help Her in all her
necessities: It is He which has commanded Her to call upon Him, which has
promised to hear and to help Her: and surely, She will not forsake the
fountain of living water, to seek the puddles which were dug by humane
inventions, which are as dry as the barren Arabian Desert, in which is no
comfort.

Neither is it to be despaired of, that She will understand, that each
Christian soul has its purgatory in this life; for he runs through a world
of miseries and afflictions, that his soul is purged and cleansed by the blood
of Christ, from all our sins; that our Savior Christ makes mention but of
two waves, the straight and narrow, leading to everlasting bliss; the other
broad, bringing us to the pit of destruction: and if there be but two ways,
there be but two homes, to wit, Dives his infernal, and Lazarus his resting
place, Abraham's bosom. It may be indeed some Devil, in the shape of an Angel
of light, may persuade Her of a third place, alleging Scripture, wrested from
the proper sense, for their positions, viz. that of St. Peter, Christ has once
suffered for our sins, the Just for the unjust, that He might bring us to
God, and was put to death concerning the flesh, but quickened in the Spirit, by
the which Spirit He went and preached unto the spirits which are in prison,
which were sometimes disobedient in the days of Noah, while the Arc was
preparing; wherein few, that is eight souls, were saved in the water. But how
can they from hence prove Purgatory; for was not Christ's Spirit from the
beginning? Has not his Spirit from the beginning been in the mouths of his
Ministers, Prophets, and Preachers? And is not Noah, in the second Chapter of
the next Epistle, termed a Pracher of righteousness? Did not also Noah preach
faithfully to that incredulous and impious people, which stopped their ears and
would not be reformed? Therefore the Text says, were then drowned, and are
now in prison, and without Gods Spirit did preach unto them, as it does now by
his Ministers. There is also great hope, that She will be won neither to fear
the Popes Bull, or esteem his pardons; for who can forgive the offense, but he
which is offended? Can the Subject remit any fault committed against the
Sovereign? We know Gods Ministers have a great prerogative, and that
whatsoever they bind or loose on earth, shall be bound or loosed in Heaven:
and we read that Balaams blessing was of great estimation, yet Balaam must
have a care, not to bless those whom God curses, nor to curse those whom God
blesses; for then it is in vain, and shall light upon his own head. Neither
has the Pope, or any Priest, power to absolve any absolutely, but only such as
God does pardon, and conditionally upon faith and repentance: I do confess,
that sins unconfessed, are as wind in the earth, the which if not vented,
will cause an earthquake in the conscience; and it is a great ease to
acknowledge our sins to Gods Minister, and absolution from his lips, is as a
kind of confirmation and seal of the pardon of them, in regard he is Gods
Angel; for so God terms the Ministers of the seven Churches in the
Revelation, they are his Messengers and Ambassadors sent unto mortals, to
bring unto them glad tidings of peace, and to preach unto them remission of
sins: but when his pardon falls where there is no penetecie,and his absolution
on a soul which is not broken, and on an vncontrite heart, it is like drops of
rain and timely showers distilled upon a slintie rock, the which in regard it
is denied entrance, it makes no abode upon it; for is any man so mad, to think
his sins to be forgiven, which is given over to work uncleanness? Or any
man to believe, that he is a holy vessel, when he is filled with the dregs of
Satan, and his own corruptions? Is any man so mad, to think his sins are
pardoned, when he has not wept for those sins which he has committed, and
does still commit sins, and that willingly, which he ought to weep for? And
therefore She will be, and is truly penitent, that She may be truly absolved;
She is abstinent, that She might be continent; and temperate, that She might
not be brought or wrought unto unchastity. And me thinks She speaks to our
Prince, as the Church to Christ in the Canticles, Draw me, and I will follow
after thee: such is her conscience.

For look into her education for her carriage, and you shall see that She is
enstructed in all manner of courtly and courteous behavior, carrying Herself
humbly to her inferiors, yet honorably amongst her equals; that her
ouerstately carriage to the one might not make them dejected, nor her too much
submissiue behavior to the other, make them too high conceited; for as her
excellencies put all pride out of her countenance, so She is not void of pride,
by being ignorant of her excellencies, but by making all her excellencies void
of pride; and howsoever Nature has so framed her heavenly lights, that there
appears a Parisetene when her eyes be open, yet the two more shining guests of
meekness and Majesty, like two good Inhabitants, beautify and adorn that
lodging. And howsoever her breath is more sweet, than gentle Zephyrus creeping
upon the bosom of Flora, yet the sweet delightful Philomels staying tunes,
carried in that breath, are more pleasing: And as Grace has taught Her to rule
the passions of her mind, so Art has enstrustructed Her to rule the parts of
her body, and like a well-framed Engine, each part observes the due and true
motion. Indeed, what can be that is worthy in a Princess, which is not in
Her? What rareness of education and behavior, either for the captiuating, or
the keeping a Princes affections; for though indeed virtue is the greatest
beauty, yet had She nothing but her beauty, yet no mortal (whose ambitious
eye durst soar at so high an object) could consider of it, but he must
confess, nor confess, but admire, nor admire, but love so rare perfections,
as are pourtrayed in her beautiful countenance, and amiable proportion. A
creature so fair, as except Fame it self will be infamous, it dares not style
any fairer; and that which makes an addition to her fairness, is that her
beautiful body is but the clothing of a more beautiful mind, a mind
fraught and full of wit, more ready to censure, than to show it self; her
words being as rare as precious: who is silent, but not sullen; modest, without
affectation; shamefaste, without ignorance: whose eyes are like the palaces of
Cupid, and yet sets reason upon the desires of all the beholders, and teaches
the spectatours chastity; whose face being the true frontispice of her mind,
is the seat of sweetness and sovereignty; whose cheeks are like gardens of
Roses and Lillies, and Alablaster besprinckled with Vermilion: both of which
are the ineffable ornaments of Nature.

Alas, what should I say more of the rare composure of her Angell-like
celestial countenance, in the framing of which, Nature has showed herself no
stepmother, but has manifested the perfection of her affection unto that sex
in Her, whose praises since I cannot utter in speeches, let it be sufficient to
admire in silence. Not to omit the proportion of her body, in the discourse of
which the most eloquent Orator might find a most spacious field to walk in;
the which is like her mind, neither too lofty, nor too excessive low; but her
stature is indifferent, and in the mean, as if Nature in framing of Her, had
been the Ape of Virtue, and intended to dwell in the mean, and shame both
extremes; each ligament and lineament of her body is so strongly, and yet so
sweetly framed, as indeed they claim the admiration of all, and the affections
of the most Peerless Prince in the world.

As for the portion, which indeed is in the last and least place to be
respected; what Princess can equal Her? For what greater portion than
happiness? and what greater happiness, than that which She will bring tome
Kingdom, into which She shall match, and in the which She shall be resident?
whose Allies shall be as strong Bulwarks to the place, to whose Prince She
shall be conjoined in wedlock, in the time of war; and in the time of peace,
the means of the transporting of all necessary and requisite benefits to that
Kingdom.

Thus her virtue, her parentage, her education, proportion, and portion, prove
Her worthy to be linked with the Worthiest in marriage, these make Her fit to
be a Wife; but the entire affection which She bears to our Prince, prove
Her worthy to be his Wife; and no doubt, but as there is the highest degree
of love betwixt Them, so no doubt they shall have the pledges of true love, and
shall live and give life to this Kingdom hereafter by their posterity.

Thus it appears, that as now She is every ways a most excellent Virgin; so
if virtue, education, parentage, portion, proportion, love, all these, or any
of these, may make a happy Spouse, She is likely to make a most blessed
Yoakefellow; these make Her fit to be a Wise, but her love to Prince Charles,
his Wife; her virtues joy the world in general, but her love to Him, does
solace Him in particular; and who is able to describe her love? not man, for
they are not so violent in their passions; not women, for few or none of them
are so virtuous, to love so chastely affectionate: no surely, neither man nor
woman can relate it to the measure, although they may utter some part of the
manner of it; for her love is even like her virtues, infinite, Oh the
incomprehensible wisdom of the Deity! which even before our birth, does not
only foreknow, but does also predetermine all the actions and affections or us
mortals, effecting things, and that for our welfare, even by almost seeming
impossible means, beyond our hope or imagination: Who would have thought that
Saul should have found a Kingdom, when he went to look his fathers Asses? Or
David a Crown, when he went to carry relief to his brethren? God oftentimes
shows us our home in the midst of our journey; for so did He deal with our
mighty Prince, who manifesting a high degree of wisdom, in looking before He
leapt; and showed no less religion than discretion, in undertaking though a
tedious journey, to view the Cabinet into which He was to put his Soul, and
to place his perpetual welfare, before He trusted it with the custody of it,
most fortunately met with the Center of his affections, even in the mid way;
He aimed, but God directed the arrow of his love at a more happy mark, more
happy and less dangerous for Himself, more happy and more prosperous for
his Countries; In so much, me thinks, that so soon as the lovely
pourtraicture of this Peerless Prince (though by his picture) should be
conucyed through those Crystal Casements of her affections, into the closet of
her secrecies, it should cause her intellectual faculty thus to rationate
with it self in silence: Whither wanderest thou, sweet Prince, so far from thy
home? Thou art lodged in my heart: Oh let it be thy perpetual habitation: Why
do thou carry my heart so far from my body? It is thou which do now
possess it; for I am no more Mistress of that which was mine own: Why
should thou seek far for that which isneerer home? Expose not thy self to
the dangers and troubles of travel: sail not into an Ocean of sorrows, when
thou may lie at road in a more quiet Harbor. Oh let my love be the
lodestone of thy person, and the Remora of thy affections: But if thou will
needs travel into the Western parts, and make a night of sorrow in our
Hemisphere; yet return turn to us again, and let the brightness of thy
beams expel the darkness of our dolor. No doubt but our Prince was
inflamed, before He saw the smoke of her desire: her looks were the
messengers of love, and his heart was open to entertain the embassage: They
were the darts of Cupid, and his heart was joyous in being wounded with such
weapons: Thus did they meet in their affections, and the Almighty seeing (if
mortals can merit any thing) that The deserved what They desired, will join
their hands as well as their hearts, and make Them one really, as they are
mentally. Happy there. fore (oh royal King) which shall live to see your
childrens children flourishing in your Palaces, and these Kingdoms eternally
conferred and confirmed upon your posterity. Happy, o Prince, who shall be
linked to one which is the Golden Chain of Virtue, this Diamond of the world,
whom Nature has so preciously set in the eyes of men, to be the chief work
of her workmanship, and the Ornament of the world. Oh happy Princess, so
happy in finding such a Head, whose welfare shall be guarded by such a Prince,
that you shall seem like sweet Rosewater kept in a crystal glass: Who when
you rejoice, shall see your joy shine in an other; and when you grieve, shall
see the face of your sorrow in another melting liquid heart. Oh happy both of
you, when like two heavenly Strings conjoined together, you shall make a
sweeter harmony: Oh how delightful will the name of Parents be unto you,
when they shall see your Children flourish, in whom they are. Oh what an
ineffable bliss it will be, when they shall see their children with awful
love run about them, and like little modells of themselves, carry themselves
about them. Oh happy pie England! which art like never to be like a flock of
sheep without a Shepherd, or an army discomfited without a Leader; but have
more than hopes, never to want one of thy blessed Kings Race to sit upon thy
Throne, so long as the Sun and Moon endures which have likewise the number
of thy friends increased, more than the multitudes of thine enemies is
augmented. Oh happy France! who gave birth to a Princess, which gives life
to thee, and promises safety to thy Confines, which is the Ornament of thee,
as thou art the Ornament of the world, which may joy in each benefit thou
affoordest, yet in nothing more than Her.

Happy in this Contract is Christendom; for although now it may for a time
endure the corrosiue of war, yet it shall be healed with the plaster of peace;
and a wrangling mother shall beget a quiet daughter; and the purifying of the
air shall be the issue of storm and lightning. Happy in this Contract are
Christians; for they see the bow of the wicked broken, and the horn of the
righteous exalted; the woman in travail shall forsake the desert; the Church
shall put off her mourning weeds, and put on the robes of comfort; the name of
Christ and the Gospel shall be exalted, and the man of sin and perdition
cast into everlasting destruction.

But still me thinks there be some sick queasie stomackt people, who distaste
all sweet delicates, and only delight in sour and unsavory sallets, who have
such timorous tender consciences, as they fear where there is no danger,
making that, which otherwise (well applied) should be the cause of their rest,
the mother of disquiet, fearing lest this Contract should bring an innovation
of religion. For (say they) was not, I pray you, Solomon seduced and brought to
idolatry, by marying? Did not Abraham forbid Eleazar his servant, nay bound
him by an oath, not to take his son a wise amongst the Canaanites, but his
own kindred? and were not the Jews forbidden to match with the Heathen? It Is
true; but it is a question, whether this was any otherwise ceremonially
enjoined to the Jews, and not necessarily imposed upon the Gentiles.

Moreover, if the servant of Abraham could not have found a woman for Isaak,
that would have come with him, he had been discharged of his oath: Likewise
Prince also are public persons, and ought to be Supporters of the public
welfare; and therefore that marriage may be lawful for Him, which seems
inconvenient for a private man, in regard that He is not so much to respect
that which may be for his own, but his peoples welfare; No doubt, could
Joseph have well forsake Egypt, without the prejudice of the Country, and
inferring a general discommoditie, he would have disposed himself, it may be,
with more joy and contentment; but God had allotted, that by his means Egypt
should be preserved; nay, and I may well say, not so much Egypt as Israel
might have safety, therefore Joseph must be brought into Egypt by a strange
means matched with a strange women: and what was all this to intimate, but
that Joseph was sold to Egypt, that Israel might be preserved from famine: and
no doubt Gods wisdom does oftentimes see beyond the reach of man's
apprehension, and may match a diversity of Religion to make an uniformity of
faith, to the end that there may be one Shepherd, one sheepefold, one Christ,
one Christian faith.

For is not in her breast the whole globe of this worlds worth contained? is not
her bosom a stately Theater in which each several virtue acts a lively
part? is not the Iuory compared to her whitenes, and Aurora pale being joined
to her blushes; her blushes, the which modesty does always dye, which
notwithstanding does always live in her countenance, whose matchless virtue
is not like a Pearl found in a dunghill, but dwelling in so fair a lodging:
It is she only whose beautiful form is such rare physic, as it is able to
make an old Prince young, and to make a young Prince live till he be aged.
True, but it is an ancient position, that stately buildings must have great
means to maintain them, and such rare beauties, rich revenues to uphold their
luster, for the whitest cloth does soonest take soil, the richest vesture
soonest spoiled, if not well looked to, and the fairest creature most subject
to be deformed, and wrinckled with want, poverty, and afflictions. It is
requisite therefore that your most curious workemanships should be most
curiously kept, that pictures excellently drawn, should be excellently
preserved. God therefore, with whom all things past, and to come, are present,
foreseeing the excellency of this model of true perfections, gave her beauty
to her virtues, and means to her beauty; for what Princess in Europe shall
have a richer dowry? The treasure which follows her as a servant whithersoeuer
she goes is in finite; and as she wants no wealth her self, so that
Kingdom shall want no riches which does enjoy her; for what greater riches
than happiness, and what greater happiness than that which she brings to
the place she shall inhabit? Is it worth or same which they thirst after? what
greater fame than her beauty? and yet her beauty less than her least virtue:
Surely, that Kingdom shall need no sun, in which her virtue shines; that
Hemisphere no light, in which such a light is resplendent; no riches in which
is such a Jewel Neither is she meanly powerful in her mighty Allies, for as
she is near to all men in affection, (for what heart can hate so harmless a
creature) so she is dear to many Princes by affinity, as to her brother in
virtues, as well as by birth, Lewis the 13, King of the French and Navarre, a
Prince so virtuous, so valiant, that the one might make him prosperous in
peace, the other triumphant in victories, for he is not only his Fathers
heir in his Kingdom, but is like to be his successor in his conquests; for
though his face as yet does scarce show his sex, yet his fortitude proves him
a man, a man of such inuict courage, and incredible force, that few can equal,
none exceed him; for though time as yet has not much outstript him, in regard
of his tender years, yet he has outstript time, who indeed so far goes
beyond all his time and years, that whereas others seem to watch and catch
time, which always steals away with a gliding sly pace, yet he seems to
fly from time, and time to run after to catch him; in so much, as when
following times shall read the story (or rather the beginning) of his life,
they shall admire to see one so young in years and courage, so old in wisdom
and experience, and shall think by his president, that discretion has shaked
hands with the gray head, and hoarie hairs, as an house ouerweake and unworthy
of such an inhabitant, and taken the Castle to defend her self against her
enemies, intemperance and unchastity, rage, fury, and diverse other such like
troops of adverse enemies, and envious adversaries, for though intemperance
and unchastity are usual (I had almost said, for so they are accounted,
venial) sins; yet He is a rider and ruler of his affections, reyneth in his
lusts with the bridle of wisdom: others, if they be distasted in the strength
of their youth, have such heat of blood, and do boil in anger, that they
seem to have enough fury to furnish all the furies in hell, and yet
notwithstanding themselves still have heaped measure, throwing themselves upon
each apparent danger, without consideration or fear, doing any injury without
conscience and religion, but wisely foresees a danger, and seeks to prevent
it, and is so valiant, that He dares not fight but upon just occasion. This is
the royal Brother of so virtuous a Sister; this is that mighty Monarch, with
whom England shakes not only the hands of friendship, but fraternity. And who
is it but the most Illustrious Princess the Lady Henrette Maria which puts the
hands together? It is She whose twinne was happiness, and whose birth brought
in felicity to all this part; nay, to all the world, especially to France and
England; to France, for God (no doubt) foresaw that he had sufficiently stored
it with Sons issued from that fountain of goodness Henry the fourth,
whereby that blessed Country might seem sufficiently strengthened and
fortified in it self. God therefore in due time sent it a daughter, so
excelling and transcending in virtue and beauty, to make it strong without it
self, and to make walls of friendship about it to England, for it was not
obscured from the All, and al ways All-seeing eye of God, before the beginning
of the world, much more Her being, what need England should have to help her
Allies and Neighbors, though not her self; and therefore ordained two such
Potentates as K. Lewis of France, and Prince Charles of England; and likewise
sent this worthy Princess to join these two together, and to make them
Brothers who are so like one another in virtuous conditions, who are both
magnanimous, both wife, both valiant, and no doubt both of them shall be
fortunate; they will draw their swords in Justice, handle them with such
courage, as each blow shall seem to be the postilion of death unto their
enemy; so that they shall satisfy their thirsty blades with the blood of
Tyrants, and die their swords with the death of the enemies to truth and
equity.

And who is the foundation upon whom these hopes are erected, but upon this
gracious Princess, who has not only virtue in Herself, highness of birth
and good education in and from her Ancestors greatness of estate; but also
has beauty to move love, wit to apprehend to love, and excellent body to
content it, and a grateful mind to reward it: For had She all these rare
endowments and aptitudes of marriage, and yet had no inclination to wedlock,
her rare gifts would be like precious jewels, which lose their luster for want
of wearing, like fragrant flowers in a most delightful garden, which are never
gathered, but sinde their tomb where they had their birth, like a root buried
up in the ground, which never brancheth: if She were resolved not to make an
exchange change of virginal for conjugal chastity, She should do the world
too much injury, in cloystering up Christendomes joys, whose hopes are
chiefly in Her, with Herself.

Moreover, her virtues would return to the King of Heaven, of whom they all
hold in capite, for want of heirs, and could only find life after her death
in the mouth of Fame; her nobility of blood would die in Herself, for want of
posterity to whom it might still be derived; She would lose the worth of her
education, in not teaching that to others, which She has been taught
Herself, all that She could well dispose of would be her Dowry, to the which
the poor would be rightful heirs, and as for her beauty, it would perish
without blessing any but a multitude of wounded admiring spectators: And
howsoever indeed it may be Death could not take it away with her soul, yet
the grave would consume it with her body: She therefore, as She was the
child of a mother, so desires to be the mother of a child.

Moreover, let no man be guilty of such a foolish suspicion, once to doubt or
imagine, that our Princes wisdom should be overcome by a woman's weakness;
that the eye of his reason and religion should be put out with the eye of
affection; Or far be it to commit such blasphemy against his Highness,
either so much to diminish his constancy in the truth, or derogate from the
soundness of his knowledge and judgment, that ever He should be brought to
forsake that, in the defense of which He would deem the loss of his life and
blood precious: Will He relinquish that which is built upon the ground of Gods
word, which is disagreeing in nothing, agreeing in every thing with the holy
Scriptures, to be the Follower of men's traditions, and an Obseruer and Seruer
of the foolish inventions of humane fancy, to reverence that termed Holiness,
which is but true Insanctitie; to rely upon any thing but the merits of
Christ; to trust to his own works, or deem them meritorious, and so to make
Himself his own Savior, and by consequence, the coming of Christ of no
necessity; to forsake that faith which was founded by Christ and his Apostles,
vpheld and followed by the Fathers, whose antiquity is such, that it was
preached by our Heavenly Father to our earthly parent in Paradise, by the which
all former and future ages must be saved, to follow that which is but an
vpstart Irreligion; which was set up by Covetousness and Ambition, which is to
bring gold to the Popes coffers, not God to the peoples consciences, which is
only to hide the light of the Gospel under the bushel of an unknown tongue,
to starve the souls of poor people, which makes Ignorance the mother of
Devotion, which is Author of destruction; which makes people think it nothing
to sin, because they think themselves sure of a pardon; which makes
adultery, Sodomie, fornication more honorable, than marriage allowable; which
makes Moses inferior to Aaron, which brings the necks of Princes and Kings
under the foot and follies of Antichrist, which is the Nurse of rebellion in
Subjects against their Sovereign, and makes him a God which is but a devil
incarnate, who Lucifer-like prefumeth to sit in the seat of God.

Or what heart can be such a detractor from Her virtue, to think that this
Phoenix of her age, this noble Princess, whose breast is the Cottage of
humility, and the quiet harbor of lowly thoughts, will offer to seek to guide
Him by whom She is to be directed, to be the stern when She is but the vessel
of which He is the Pilot; to be the Sun, when she is but the Moon, which must
borrow light from his knowledge? can She which esteems him to be all worth,
think that the greatest ornament in him is unworthy? No surely, She knows
that She may be the crown of the head, but She will not presume to be the head
of the body; She desires not to metamorphise water into oil. It is not hidden
from Her, that Nature and Grace has given man the superiority, that the
strength of his body, the stoutnesse and courage of his mind, the stayednesse
of his affections, the wisdom of his soul, the pregnancy of his wit, the
dominion of his will, the soundness of his judgment, the ripeness of his
understanding, in a word, all the powers of his soul, and the perfections of
his body, do plead for and claim a Diadem of dominion and government over
women, which are the weaker sex; She desires but to rest in his bosom, to be
his heart, and not his head; She knows that is his peculiar, and therefore She
will not challenge it; She is the heart, and He is the head, the head in which
is the eye of knowledge, the ear of understanding, the gift of discretion; and
will not the heart think as the eye informs it, as the ear certifies it, as
discretion tells it? Yes surely, and She will do as her Prince instructs her;
for will not She which loved himself for himself, love God for him, and for
herself also? may not He which has drawn her heart to love him, persuade her
soul to embrace God? Yes surely, there is small doubt, great hope, nay almost
assurance, that not only She, but many millions will be brought and wrought to
embrace the Christian faith, to favor and follow the true Religion, by the
means of this happy union and blessed contract.

Neither are these all the evidences for this ground of our happiness, but we
have more mighty motives to induce and persuade us that She will open her breast
to entertain the truth, and unfold Her arms to embrace affectionately this
our ancient Catholic, Apostolic, and reformed Religion. For can She call to
remembrance her Grandmother Ioanna Albrettana Q. of Navarre, the loving,
chaste, modest, sober, discreet wife of Anthony Duke of Burbon her Grandfather;
can She (I say) retain in her mind that delight of Heaven, and light of earth
her Grandmother, and yet forget her Religion, in the profession of which She
was constant and immovable? And what was it, but that which we now profess,
to wit, the faith which is according to knowledge, and not ignorance; for, how
can they be good which know not what goodness is? as the Layty of the Romish
Church which is nursed and nusled up in blindness, the faith which teaches us
to put on the roabe of Christ's righteousness, to rely wholly and solely upon
his merits, to abandon our selves, and our own actions, as death and
darkness, unless Christ give life and light to us and them. Thus was she in
practice pious, in profession a Protestant, in which she lived, in which she
dyed, by which now she rests in peace, shall rise in power, and reap a
crown of immortal glory.

Was not likewise that Royal King Henry the fourth, the great late French
King, in education and profession a Protestant, and though he might afterward
(to prevent civil broiles, and intestine and unnatural wars in his
Dominions, for the peace of the Kingdom, for the safety of his Subjects) let
policy a little get the upper hand of Piety, and did somewhat conniue and
favor the Romish Religion; yet no doubt he did never truly affect it. And
howsoever some blacke-mouthed monsters are not ashamed to say, that he was like
the Church of Laodicea, neither hot nor cold, yet charity and equity may
depose, that he did not like to the Church of Ephesus, which forsook her first
love.

No surely, but though in external show he might countenance the Popes
Prelates, in regard most of the Princes of his Country were of that faction;
yet we may say of him, as it is said of David, his heart was with God; and no
doubt his soul soared upon the wings of the Protestants profession unto the
hill of God, Mount Sion; In so much, as that cursed murderer Rauilack, though
he might wound him mortally, yet could not kill him eternally, but God did
turn the hate of that monster of men, or rather Fury of hell, to the
welfare of this mighty Monarch, who did but leave a crown of thorns to
gain a Crown of glory, who did but lose a kingdom subject to so many
alterations (by time and troubles) to find a Monarchy subject to no mutability.

Oh happy Henry, if thou had never been the nourisher of such a viperous
brood, which have eaten out the bowels of thee which was thy foster-Father. Oh,
had the valor of thy soul been equal to the courage of thy mind, thy
Country had never been wounded so much by thy loss, nor thou by that
monster; but thou had blessed it with a longer life, and a more timely death.
Oh happy, if thou had labored to have purged Gods floor, and rooted out
these tares out of Gods field; for had not these tares stood, the tears of
sorrow had not so overflowed thy Kingdoms, whiles thou did valiantly
profess and maintain the Gospel of Christ. How secure and free thou were
from danger: How secure in thy estate, and how did all things fall out
prosperous to thee? How vainly did these King-killing Caitiffes attempt to
hurt thee? No surely, the love of God did shield thee from all thy enemies, but
when thou shewedst too little love to God, in throwing too many favors upon
them, then the Lord did show thee, that the effects of thy love to them was
their hate to thee.

For the father does not always beget a child like himself; no more has
love always birth from affection: God did take away the guard of his
protection and the bulwark of his defense, exposing thy breast to an open
enemy, both to himself and thee. Whereas Queen Elizabeth, who beyond the
valor and constancy of her sex, maintained and continued the Christian
Religion: How many dangerous treasons did the hand of the Lord conduct Her
through, and still She was preserved? For the Devil and his instruments are
like the Crocodile, which flies if a man pursues it, but pursues if a man
persist not in his pursuit; Or as a shadow, the which if a man flies will
follow him, but if he run after it, will run from him. In a word, God no doubt
brought that famous pious King, Henry the fourth, to eternal durable life,
through the purgatory of a sharp and sudden death: So does the Physician give
bitter potions, to procure the better health: So does the Chyrurgian lance the
wound, to heal the sore; so are sharp copperas waters given to salve sore
blinded eyes; so is the ground harrowed to make it fruitful; and so no doubt
God suffered this affliction of sudden death, to be effected by that cursed
hand, that He might be more sound in his souls resolution, that his eyes might
be opened, to see the sorditie of the Popish Jesuitical Sect, and that He
might be better instructed by their cruelty in his death, than He could by
their flattery his life, who showed themselves true Absolons, who the more
David did respect him, the more he rebelled against him: Is it possible then
that her mind can ever lose the impression of her fathers remembrance? And can
She remember Him, and yet forget his death? Or can reminiscence retain his
death, and not think of the instrument of it? Or can the instrument of that
murder be in her memory, and the setters on work of that wicked Instrument,
the Instigatours of that bloody Butcher, to that beastly, cursed, cruel fact,
be out of her mind? And can She remember them, and not abhor them? And can
She abhor them, and not relinquish their religion, which hold that lawful,
which Gods Law has forbidden? For God prohibiteth the murder of any private
person; but these Doctors maintain it to be lawful to kill Kings, which are
public persons. Neither do they permit it as a work not impious, but
persuade men to it, as a deed meritorious: For Rauilack had no sooner played his
part in that bloody Scene, but he was so confident in the blessedness of the
act, as he thought immediately to have flowne to Heaven, and been crowned a
Saint by God, as well as canonized a Saint by the Pope: Such is the leaven of
the Popish Doctrine, that sowres all the subjects of the Prince which does
profess it. For what treacherous attempt against any King, either Protestant
or Papist, has been made by a Protestant in our memories? Oh no, we are
taught to fear God, to honor the King; we must follow David's example to
Saul, not lift up our hands against the Lords Anointed; we know He is Gods
Vicegerent, placed there by God, and therefore to be displaced by none but Him:
But on the contrary, what plots have been laid? What treasons have been
committed, either for the destruction of a King, or subversion of a Kingdom,
in which the Papists have not only been Parties, but principal Agents? Who
were they which plotted so many treasons against the Person of Queen
Elizabeth, but Papists? But what treasons were plotted against Queen Marie by
any Protestant, notwithstanding she was a cruel persecutor of that
Profession? What was Gowrie that conspired the overthrow of the Sacred Majesty
of King James, but a Papist? What were the plotters of that horrid Gunpowder
Treason, who sought with one puff to blow away both the Prince and Peers of
our Kingdom, but all professors of the Romish Religion? What was he which
murdered King Henry the third of France, but a Papist Iacobin? In a word,
what treasons have been committed, which are contained in the Register-booke
of man's memory, which have not been plotted and performed by them? And no
marvel the Priests and people practice it, since they preach it; and it is an
orthodoxall opinion and position amongst them, that the Pope has power both to
dispose of Kingdoms, and depose Kings, and that King-killing is not only a
lawful, but a holy and honorable calling. Who then can suspect, that a
Princess of her peerless part, of her pious disposition, of her matchless
understanding and discretion, does affect truly that religion, which does
infect the hearts of Princes subjects, which does teach men to be monsters in
government, and not to subject themselves to higher powers, but to rebel
against the rule and authority of the Regal Scepter? How can those Princes
have any peace with God, that do so little respect, and much hazard their
lives, as to harbor and foster such murtherous rebellious minded men in their
Kingdoms? How can Princes have any peace with men, when they suffer men which
are so wicked, to preach such doctrine, and practice such villainy? How can
they have any peace within the^, when they may justly fear that each one which
smiles in their face, may smite their heart? when they nourish up such vipers
in their bosom, as are ready each moment to eat out their bowels? How can
then this Royal Princess affect that religion, or the professors of it, which
was the death of her Father and his Predecessor? which may be a disturbance to
the peace of her Prince, and the safety of his person, if it be tolerated?
which may impair the security of her posterity, who are never like to
possess their Princedomes in peace, unless such vermin be hunted out of
their Territories; for peace and such people cannot inhabit in one Kingdom, or
dwell together, no more than wine and poison in a crystal glass, but the
glass will be broke, and the wine spilt and spoiled: If then a Prince will
possess his soul and sovereignty in peace, he must banish these breakers and
disturbers of it. Neither is it a strange or unheard of matter, for France and
England to shake hands of amity and unity in those blessed Contracts; for
since almost the beginning of either Monarchy, there have been continually
these friendly and fortunate interchanges of marriage: For it was not concealed
from our Ancestors, how beneficial peace was between France and England;
therefore Steven Earl of Bloys was linked in the bond of marriage with Adela,
daughter to William the Conqueror. And on the other side, William Waren Earl
of Surrey, son of Gunred, daughter to William the Conqueror, married the
daughter of Hugh Vermandoys, brother to the King of France. For in like manner,
William Duke of Normandy did marry Marie, daughter to Foulke Earl of Anjou;
Maud the Empress was linked in marriage with Iefferie Plantaginet Earl of
Anjou. And for the happiness of his Kingdom, the tranquillity of his
Country, and felicity of his Contrymen, Steven King of England married
Constance, daughter to the King of France. Henry the second married Elenor,
sole heir to William Duke of Aquitaine. Henry, son to King Henry the
second, married Margaret, daughter to Lewis the French King. Richard Cordelion
married Berenger, daughter to Sanches King of Navarre. John King of England
married Isabel, daughter and heir of Amorie Earl of Angoulesme. Arthur, nephew
to King John, married the daughter of Philip King of France. Edward the second
married the daughter of Philip King of France. Isabel, daughter to Edward the
third, married Ingelram de Guisnes, Earl of Soysson and Bedford. Richard the
second married Isabel, daughter to Charles the French King. Henry the fourth
married Jane, the daughter of Philip the third King of Navarre. Henry the fifth
married Catherine, daughter to Charles the French King. Henry the sixth married
Margaret, the daughter of Reiner Valois Duke of Anjou. Marie daughter to Henry
the seventh, married Lewis the twelfth, French King. Charles Prince of Great
Britain, betrothed to Maria Henrette, daughter to Henry the fourth, and
sister to Lewis the thirteenth, Kings of France.

Thus has there been a long and sweet continuance of blessed Contracts between
France and England, fortunate in each marriage, producing peace and plenty to
each Dominion: so have these matches been prosperous to former, so is this
like to be to future ages, that all happiness to either Kingdom shall be the
issue of this most longed for and liked Union: For who can be made more happy
in themselves, more blessed in their people, than this Prince and Princess,
who are so like in themselves, and their Countries, their people, their loves,
and their virtues, as this rare Lady and her Prince? who by his supreme
virtues, might seem only to challenge Her; and She, for her exquisite
qualities, to enjoy Him: So that from this Match may be derived all happiness,
and all felicity; as also all virtues join in them; for has his greatest
indignation and choler been ever made a crime against them, whom He has
hated? No, no, but his royal Soul, which had nothing in it but courage,
seemed to fail in his revenge, and though that with the eyes of his mind He
may apprehend offenses, yet his mercy is as ready to forget them, as his
wisdom to apprehend them. And for his valor, I doubt not, but hereafter as
well as in times past, the eyes of all men shall see it, and ears conceive it,
and succeeding ages shall publish his present valor; and it is not to be
feared that this assertion shall need confirmation, since there is hope it is
not only without contestatio^, but comparison, who has also clemency joined
with his courage, and has as much pleasure in pardoning, as glory in
vanquishing: so that it is to be expected, that as the acts of the one shall be
signed with blood, so the other shall be sealed with tears.

And for his pious life, the world knows that he has no superiors, few
equals, but multitudes of inferiors; who as if he made it his only happiness
to serve God, does only please himself in pleasing him, esteeming his services
his greatest freedom, and deeming it a thing most unworthy, to be a
Sovereign of men, and not a servant of God. And a thing most requisite in a
Prince to be as eminent in grace, as in place; and in virtue, as in dignity;
than the which there cannot be a greater honor, nor any thing which does more
prove or improve the stock He came of, who is like pure pearly water flowing
from a Crystal fountain; or like an Apple of gold hanging upon a goodly
Cedar, which brancheth it self into all the parts of Christendom.

For how royally descended, and nearly allied is He; for how frequent have the
interchanges of Marriages with England, and other the chiefest and noblest
Families of Christendom, being the only son of James the sixth of that name,
King of Great-Britaine, France, and Ireland, lineally descended from multitudes
of most mighty Monarchs, the undoubted Heir of the said Dominions, being
issued from Marie Queen of Scotland, and Dowager of Francis of Valoys the
second French King, who departed this life 1586, marrying Henry Steward Lord
Darnely her second Husband, eldest Son to Matthew created Duke of Albany, in an.
1565, and slain in the year 1566: the which Q. Mary was the daughter of James
Steward the 5. king of Scotland, whose first wife was Magdalen daughter of
Francis the 1. French king, who dyed in the year 1541: The which James the 5.
was descended from James the 4. king of Scotland, who married Margaret eldest
daughter of king Henry the 7, and sister to king Henry the eighth, in the 11.
year of her Fathers reign, 1489. and was slain in battle at Flowden, anno
1514, in the sixth year of king Henry the 8. his reign. The which James 4.
was issued from James the 3. king of Scotland, who married Margaret daughter of
Christian the 1. king of Denmark, mark, who was descended from James Steward
the 2. King of Scotland, who married Marie daughter of Arnold Duke of Gelders,
and was slain anno 1460, who was sprung from the loins of James Steward the
first king of Scotland, who married Ioane daughter of John Earl of Summerset:
In the which England and Scotland in those times also gave the kisses of peace
in marriage; for the said Ioane was descended from John Plantagenet, surnamed of
Gaunt, Earl of Richmond, Duke of Lancaster, called king of Castile, who married
three wives, and died in anno 1398. being issued from the royal stock of
Edward Plantagenet the 3. king of England and France, who quartered the Arms,
erected the Order of the Garter, married Philip of Henault, and deceased anno
1377.

But to return unto our former discourse, this James the first was issued from
the loins of Robert Steward the third king of Scotland, sometimes called John,
married Annibell daughter to John Drummond, and dyed in anno 1406, who was
descended from Robert Steward the 2, who after David Bruise 1370. was king of
Scotland, whose second wife was Elizabeth daughter of Adam Mar knight, who
dyed 1309. was descended from Gualter Steward Lord Steward of Scotland, who
married Margerie daughter of Robert Bruise, sister and heir to Dauid-Bruise,
both kings of Scotland, by which means the royal name of the Stewards was
matched into the blood royal, and made apparent heirs of the Crown; in which
worthy and noble Name it does still unto this present day continue. Which
honorable and ever to be reverenced Name, was first advanced to the dignity of
Lord Stewardship by king Malchol the 3. who conferred that honor upon Walter
borne in Wales, at his return into Scotland, for some memorable and worthy
services which he performed. But they were entitled in the Crown by the
marriage of the abouesaid Margerie, daughter to Robert Bruise Earl of Carrick,
the first king of Scotland, who married Elizabeth sister to the Earl of Mar,
and died in anno 1329. Whose Ancestour Robert Bruise Lord of the Valley of
Anandie in Scotland, and Cunnington in England, married Martha daughter to the
Earl of Carrick. He also married Isabel the sister and co-heire of John the
Scot, Earl of Chester, who brought unto him Cunnington in England for her
Dowry, being of the stock of David Earl of Angus and Huntingdon, the 3. son
of Henry Prince of Scotland, who married Margaret daughter and coheire of the
Earl of Chester, and dyed in anno 12 19. William king of Scotland (surnamed
the Lion) second Son of Prince Henry, succeeded his brother king Malchol in
anno 1160, and dyed without issue. Henry Earl of Huntingdon married Ada the
daughter of William Earl of Werren, having a period prefixed to his days by
the Almighty, before the expiration of his Fathers life anno 1152. David the
first king of Scotland, son of Malchol, married Maud daughter and heir of
Waltheof Earl of Huntingdon, and dyed in anno 1153. in the 19. year of the
Reign of king Steven; so Maud Queen of England, daughter of Malchol, and
brother to David the first king of Scotland, was espoused to Henry the first
king of England, son to William the Conqueror, who dyed anno 1119, from
whose loins sprung the famous race of the British Kings, who have for their
valor, and their fortunes been famous, and admired throughout the world.

Neither was here a beginning of the love and amity between them, who now by
one are for ever made one: For likewise before the Conquest there was a mutual
exchange of these contracts, and between the ancient famous Saxons, and our
pious Kings and Princes ancestors, have bin famous matches for the good and
benefit of both Kingdoms, for both the Lines of Egbert the Saxon K. of
England, and Alphin K. of Scotland, met in the marriage of Malchol the 3, and
Margaret sister of Edgar Ehelin right heir to the Crown of England, who died
an. 1093. Which Malchol was the son of Duncan, who vanquished Mackboth in fight,
yet afterward himself was slain in anno 1092, whose Father Dunken the 1.
king of Scotland, (and heir of Beatrix who succeeded Malchol) was slain by
Makbeth in anno 1046. Beatrix eldest daughter, and co-heire of king Malchol the
2, was married to Abineth Crinathany of the West Islands of Scotland. Malchol the
second king of Scotland, son of Kenneth the 3, subdued king Trim, was slain
in anno 1034. Kenneth the third king of Scotland, succeeded king Culen, became
a tyrant, and was murdered 994. Malchol the first son of king Donald, was
the successor of Constantine the 3, and was murdered in the year 958. Donald
the sixth king of Scotland, next after king Gregory was his predecessor, who
died anno 904. Constantine the second, king of Scotland, after the death of
Donald his Uncle, was slain in anno 874. Keneth the second, king of Scotland,
called the great, succeeded his Father king Alphen, and died in anno 894.
Alphin son of K. Achai, who made the first league with France, after the death
of king Dongallies, he likewise recovered the kingdom of Scotland anno 830,
and was afterward slain in anno 834.

This is the royal descent of our renowned Prince by the Fathers side, being
sprung by the Fathers and Grandfathers side, from so many glorious stemmes of
the kings of Scotland. By the Grandmother from the renowned race of the Kings
of England, to whom Scotland has been often lincked by the performance of
Hymen's rites, and the celebration of happy nuptials; but now it has found (by
the means of our gracious Sovereign) a more blessed and assured union. Whose
ancestors (the true objects of admiration) have ever been famous for virtuous
actions, for what have they been defective in which sauoured of perfection?
what worth have they wanted, that might make them esteemed to be the most
noble worthies that ever lived? For he has beeneallyed to so many mighty Kings
of England and Scotland; and in fine, does heir rightfully the virtues and
renownes of both Kings and kingdoms; for who can be silent but dumb men in
his praises? or can any be tongue-tide whose heart is lincked to him by the
bond of obedience? and can any one which is a true subject but make such a
Sovereign the subject of his praises, and object of his duty? But to the
intent that all may know the highness of this Princes birth, as well as the
goodness of his mind, examine but the greatness of his ancestors and allies
of the mothers side, whose remembrance to us is like Myrrh unto the body which
it embalmeth, incorruptible, but wondrous bitter; for how can it be better
then bitter unto us, seeing it reduces into our reminiscence her Name which
was so delightful, seeing that putting us in mind of her perfections, the
which making us see how necessary she was for us, manifests unto us how
miserable we are for her. Oh no, it is impossible for us to remember her, and
to forget her virtues; or to retain the loss of them in our minds, and to
forget sorrow, but to have weeping eyes and bleeding hearts; considering that
the perpetual welfare of England required that she had bin immortal, from
whose death our grief has birth, and from whose tomb flows our sorrow. But
why should I thus produce this mournful dish at this marriage feast, unless it
should be like sour sawces tobeget us better stomachs to our sweeter
dainties, and to make the beauty of our solace more amorous and excellent by
the proposing of the palenesse of our sorrow: So does a fair stately Steed
seem most to be esteemed being amongst a number of ill-fauoured Iades. So
does it serve as well as a painting for a fair Lady to have a foul
Chambermaid; so does a passionate speech delight in a pleasant Comedy, and a
sorrowful passage thrust in amongst a company of merry scenes. And no doubt
this serves like the face of a blacke-Moore to his teeth, makes them seem more
white and comely.

This sorrow, for the loss of our Queen Anne, makes our joy, for the enjoying
of this Princess, the greater; who is like her for perfections, as She seems
most fortunate, in being the wife of such a Prince, descended from such a
mother, who although dead, yet live in Her, as being the true Mirror of her
most gracious qualities; He also most happy in Her, in finding a kind of a
mother in a wife, so like Her, who may serve Him for his mothers picture, all
times to look on, with a respective, loving, joyful remembrance, to see his
mother living in Her: For surely, her beauty and virtue cannot die, so long as
this famous Princess shall live. And thus, like Isaak with Rebecca, He shall
be comforted after the death of his mother, who for the goodness and the
greatness of her blood, was almost unparalleled; For how many royal Kings,
which weilded their regal Scepters with policy, power, and piety, is She
descended from? How nearly allied was She to multitudes of potent Princes? in
so much, as walls of friendship were erected by her means, round about these
Kingdoms, as the King of Denmark, who for his place and person, is both
wealthy and worthy, and able, both for men and money, to raise a friend, or
ruin an enemy; but howsoever, to defend an Allie, who was the natural and
most affectionate brother of our most royal Queen, who by this most happy
Contract, is united to France, as we to Him, who will be always in readiness
to do any office of friendship and fraternity unto it.

What should I speak of the Ancestors of our Queen, as Frederick the second,
King of Denmark, Norway, Goths, and Vandalls, son to Christian the third,
who died in that menacing memorable year 1588. and the 32. of the reign of
Queen Elizabeth, of neuer-dying fame and memory, who married Sophia (not
unworthily so called, in respect her disposition did answer her denomination;
for indeed She was all wisdom, as her name imports) Queen of Denmark,
sole heir to Vlrick Duke of Meckleburg, in anno 1572. from whose blessed
loins and fruitful, as from a fertile Soil, has flowed such a noble
Progeny, as seemed to promise to people the world with Princes, as that
Princely, royal, religious, pious, prudent Queen Anne, the mostrespected,
chaste, meek, merciful, Maiestique Wife of the Sacred Majesty of our most
mighty Monarch, James the first; and the most happy Mother of our most
promising Prince Charles, the Felicity of his Father, and the Pledge of our
succeeding Peace, and the Propagation of Religion; and also the fortunate
Mother of many hopeful Children, the most Gracious Queen Elizabeth, has
borne unto Frederick King of Bohemia. Also the aforenamed Christian the fourth,
the now King of Denmark, who married Anne Catherine Queen of Denmark,
daughter to Ioachim Frederick Marquisse of Brandenburg, borne in anno 1575. who
has now reaped the fruits and pledges of his mariage-bed, the most warlike and
worthy Prince, Frederick Christian Heir of Norway, Duke of Holst and
Sleswick, and is still suruiuing, a most prosperous, hopeful, and honorable
Prince: As also Vlrick, Heir of Norway, Duke of Holst, Knight of the noble
order, Brother to Queen Anne, and Uncle to Prince Charles, second son of
King Frederick the second: And in like manner John Duke of Holst and Sleswick,
Brother to Queen Anne, and Uncle to Prince Charles, who was borne 1583. and
died unmarried in Muscouia. Also Elizabeth, eldest Daughter of King Frederick
the second, Sister to Queen Anne, and Aunt to Prince Charles, who was espoused
to Henry Iulio Duke of Brunswicke and Luneburg, father of two brothers, the
elder Duke of Brunswicke and Luneburg, and Christian Duke of Brunswicke and
Bishop of Halberstadt, who has manifested his infinite love and courage, for
the defense of the true religion and his Allies, exposing his breast to open
dangers and infinite perils, hazarding his substance and himself, beyond
ordinary valor or virtue, for the restoring of his so much beloved, and so
much worthy to be beloved kinswoman, Q. Elizabeth. O worthy Prince! never
enough to be commended by the weakness of a humane pen; for I think no
Tullian, no surely, nor Tertullian eloquence, could sufficiently compile thy
commendations: and I doubt not, but thy virtues have engraven more noble
thoughts on Thee, in the hearts of all, than can be expressed by the hands of
any. But to return to the famous Offspring of this happy King Frederick the
second: and not to forget Augusta, third daughter to King Frederick the second,
and Sister to Queen Anne, and Aunt to our worthy Prince Charles, borne in the

Here then the blindest man may see the famous Genealogy of our mighty
Prince, the which I have related in a compendious manner, fearing to be tedious
or troublesome; yet not so briefly, but it is void of obscurity; so that the
most ignorant may conceive the most illustrious marriages, between the
Ancestors of this Royal Prince, and all parts of Christendom. For the
Progenitors of his dear Father, and our dread Sovereign, have matched into
the most famous Families of the house of Burbon, French King, and of Navarre,
Arragon, Castile, Loraine, and Hapsburg, now called Austria, of the Emperor,
and King of Spain.

Also by the way, the houses of Luxenburgh, Gelders, and Dowglasse, all the
which manifest unto thee how often they have been graced with the
participation and joining in the Imperial stem of his sacred Majesty, the
King of Great-Britaine.

Also the noble Line out of which sprung the Kings of Denmark, as Saxony,
Pommerland, Brunswicke, Plantagenet, Oldenburg, Shamburg, Holst, and Sleswicke,
Zelerne, and being descended from the Electors of Brandenburg, Bauare, and
Mackleburg, in former times the Kings of the Orbotrites. Also you may see
Austria, Baden, Oldenburg, Thurin, Bohemia. Also the house of Austria springs
forth from Poland, that her branch might be inoculated into Pomerland, and so
be grafted into Denmarkes stock. This is the neuer-enough to be illustrated
descent of our most royal Prince, whose famous Predecessors and Allies do,
like so many burning Lamps, shine to keep his virtues from obscurity; but that
being so high of birth all men might look upon and love his worthy disposition
and pious inclination, the which, if I should offer to produce upon the Theater
and Stage of these my labors, it would be too little to be contained in it,
and I could not tell where to make a Prologue or an Epilogue to my story. Oh
no, let such ambition be as remote once to think, or undertake to pen his
praises to the full, which desires no praise, but deserves all: Let it only be
my comfort that I have paid some duty to him, unto whose perfections my
affections are devoted, and whose I am. Millions of times more then my own, of
whose worth I am an admirer, unto whose Highness it is my only desire to
express my service, and manifest my duty; and likewise to that high borne
Royal Princess, his intended and contracted Spouse, whose Royal Person
includes all high beatitudes: for her birth is most excellent, and yet her
fortune exceeds her birth, and also her virtues her fortunes, whose beauty
darkens the beams of mundane luster, and draws all humane lights to it, to
behold it with admiration.

Alas, what shall I say? If I should undertake such an endless enterprise, as
to express her virtues to the full, which are above measure, except I should
take in hand a task infinite; for her praises must be infinite, because her
worth is such, and sure I am my work is infinite in nothing but weakness; let
me therefore have leave to make that the Omega which was the Alpha of my work,
and end with that with the which I did begin, humbly besseeching the Giver of
all good gifts, and Father of lights, in whom is no variablenes or shadow of
turning, to bless this Union with a happy process, which he has happily
begun, to make their virtues permanent which now are peerless, and
(howsoever man can scarcely conceive how they should be more virtuous) yet that
they may still increase and grow in goodness, in which there is evermore a
plus vltra. Long may they live and love together, and bring forth such golden
Apples of Posterity, and have such a happy offspring, that they may be justly
joyous, and all the world fortunate in it, that they may have length and
prosperity of days here, Peace at the time of their passage out of this world,
and a happy resurrection to eternal life; the which, that it may be, let all
good Subjects say as I pray, Amen.

FINIS.
