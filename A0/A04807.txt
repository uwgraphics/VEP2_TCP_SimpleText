Declaringe the fall of the whore of babylone intytuled Tie thy mare tom boy with
other and there unto anexid a prologe to the reders

Apocalypse.xviii Alas alas that great syty babylon which was clothed in Rays
purpel and skarlet and decked with gold precious stones and perells for at one
hour is her judgment come and her great riches brought to naught W. K. To the
Reader.
WHen that I had (dear reader) of the great over throes which the hour of
babylon had taken, and pattlt perseuid how ma^fullye she was be set or campton
every side with most valiant and christen waryors me thought I cold not for
the love which I bare unto the truth stand still and Idly to behold the,
considering also with how miche Joy and gladness of heart ye captains of this
army has reseued the commandment of ye lord sent unto the^ by John his
embasator which commands the^ that they should no longer tryffell nor dallye

As they have deserved, etc.

Yt made me so much the bolder to set my self forward in this battle,
trusting that all though I be but an unworthy sowdyer of Jesus christ, they
will yet beat with my rude wekenes or at the least accept my good will and
mind for although (for lack of knoleg) I can not handell my weapons so
hansomly as those which have be^ daily practiced in the^ yet to declare my
self a true hearted soudiet to my power will (in this battle) take no skorne,
nether it be ashamed to gether together so^ of ye pelets and wepo^s yt this

great mercy to help and strenghten our noble king with all his godly
counselers in taking away of all such popisshe constitucions which has been
the destruction of many souls and to the great hinderaunce of his most blessed

The ballet of ty the mare tom boy.
TY the mare, tom boy
Ty the mare tom?
Less she straye
from the away
Ty the mare tom.
Now good tom bestirre the
This mare look thou wake her
And do nothing fere the
But boldly go take her.
For some will outwere the
Do not now forsake her
A rope for her bear the
That comme thou may take her.
And ty her good tom boy
Thou must therefore fetch her
That she may provide her
Some else where to mache her
Perchance she will hyde her
But se thou well watch her
We can not abide her
a haulter vpstratche her
Therefore ty her tom boy
This tom boy to name him
I will now proclayme him
Although some disdain him
And also disfame him
But what though they blame him
and seek for to pain him
Tom troth must we frame him
a fool some men feign him
ty the mare tomboye
This mare now open
I must needs declare her
Her name to vnloken
To set her and stare her
She does sure betoken
a whore now beware her
for Johan has this spoken
Which does nothing spare her
Therefore ty her tom boy
In his reuelacions
there may all men spy her
that have speculacions
and list for to try her
Her ill frequentacions
will make men defye her
for with exclamacions
John does so discrye her
Therefore ty her good tom boy
Full sore does he treat her
Let she now defend her
Or else somwher get her
That she may amend her
For we will so frette her
she shall all to rende her
To harken now let her
And to us attend her
Ty the mare tom boy
O vnshamfaste harlot
so proudly arrayed
In purple and scarlet
thou art now dismayed
Of every varlot
thou madeste us afraid
Gods word our true marlot
Has the now bewrayed
Ty the mare tom boy
In castles and towers
thou were ever walled
great kings to thy wors
thou have ever called
thy feldes with their flours
And parkes that were paled
With all thy strong dowers
From the are now fauled
ty the mare tomboy
Thy cofers were filled
With riches and treasure
thy chambers were delled
With sylkes of great valyor
thy red dear were killed
and slain out of measure
thus poor men were pylled
to mainteyne thy pleasure
ty the mare tom boy
The fall of the market
Thy merchants bewayleth
Their wares no man lack it
Their fine flower fails
In sackes may they seek it
From ingland it sayleth
Here longer to dark yt.
Yt no thing a vialeth.
Ty the mare tom boy.
The ship men that spied,
the shall of the city.
A far of they cried.
Lamenting with pitye.
And say now is fyred.

When priest es saw the crased.
There crowns then they skratched
And were so adased,
their sete down they dashed
And as they still gased,
for fere there tethe gnashed.
the lord is no we raised.
that has them thus lashed
ty the mare tom boy,
for he sent them preachers
and they were disdayneh
to death the true techers
Were always constrained.
and this like horse leche^rs
the lord was blasphemed
but mark now ye mechers
how well ye have gained
ty the mare tom boy.
His laws when he sent you.
Both Joys Ioly,
Like mad men ye rent you
Blasphemynge his body
ye should now repent you
And therefore be sorry.
neds must ye content you
Yt is but a folly
Ty the mare tom boy.
Both pistells and gospells,
ye always obskured
to maintain fatt mossels
ye have us alured
as satons apostels
this ar we assured
your meulls trymd with tossels*
May not now be used
Ty the mare tom boy
Like humayne vices
ye were still grene dowers
of popyshe pastymes
ye were great alowers
for your deuylyshe crimes.
ye must be now plowers
or in these rymes
with ores to be rouers
ty the mare tom boy.
ye have us detected
With your false commycyon
So subtell infected
were ye with ambycyon
As men not elected
In christ's tuycyon,
But Iustlye regected:
As sons of perdycyon
ty the mare tom boy
ye served with knyues
At other men's tables
and had by their vices
young chylderen in credels
your great sinful lives
For all your fine sables
I fear with rych dives
In hell be your stables
ty thy mare tom boy
With dysshes full denty
So costly ye fared
the pottes went so plentye
No hot wynes ye spared
till go could ye scanty
your eyes so then stared
yet poor men full empty
to speak not ones dared
Ty the mare tom boy
By other men's fyers
your childeren were warmed
With cruel desires
the christenye armed
Like roarars and criers
In churches ye charmed
like sellers and buyers
the whole earth ye fermed
Ty the mare tom boy
Your deuelysh dissentinos
and loud exclamations
with your false inuencions
would ask long narrations
your subtle suspentions
And wrong accusations
with spitfull pretencions
they need no probacyons
ty thy mare tom boy
there was never treason
But ye did inuente it
in ears this to reason
ye do yet frequente it
With some ly or leson
abroad ye forth sent it
But come is the season
that ye must repent it
ty the mare tom boy
Like Ioly mass singers
ye have us deluded
your little bell ringers
at them we much mused
for all your clean fyngers,
ye must be a cused,
In that ye were bringers
Of such wares abused,
Ty the mare tom boy
with laws so profane,
that were full unruly
your ashes and palm.
maintained so duly,
your dark laten salme,
this will I assurer ye*
Comme wind or comm calm
It must a way truly
ty thy mare tom boy
with bocke bell and candell
ye gave us your curses
and would us so handell
that walk should our purses
some time for to strangell,
with ropes ye would trusse us
no longer now dandell,
for we are past nursses
ty the mare tom boy
Yt were great dispensers
and there with releuers
as shepes with sencers,
Good basens and euers
In vessmentes at venters
ye sange many prayers
for them that were lenters
and to your such leuers,
Ty the mare tom boy,
your veluettes and satin
By such tricks ye winned
Between masser and mattens
salt water ye sprenged
a sparges in latten
forth with them ye singed,
to call Jack and wat in
the belles out ye ringed
ty the mare tom boy
your fine waxen tapers
Besides your long torches,
with there fumminge vapers,
Carried before corses
away with clappers*
And puddels in porches,
With all such like matters
Ty ar of no forces
Ty the mare tom boy
Your bedes and your bedroles
It was but abusion
Your trendels and trentals
Went al to confusion
your oyells and your yemnolls,
It was plain delusion
So was your mementoes
To tell the conclusyon*
Ty the mare tom boy
Your deryge so netye,
For sowles hens disaesed
your portas so pretty
Wherein ye still preched
With feats that were fety
ye have us defeted
From gods word so mety,
For us to be teached
Ty the mare tom boy
Gone is your nasty
And laten procession
And so must your casty
That false dear confession
Which was always apty
To raise insurrertion
Persuading with suertie
To give us remissyon
Ty the mare tom boy
At mydnyght to mattens
ye came from dormyra
With lyghtes in your lantarnes
To se your latins,
Away must your antems
Of Gaude maria
In latin your seven psalms
With salve regina
Ty the mare tom boy
ye prestes with your presents
ye must be now learned
your lies and your legendes
Ar like to be burned
your picktures with presents
May not be adourned
For all remes and regentes
will shortly be turned,
Ty thy mare tom boy
your god ye long keep it
yt wexeth now rustye,
And exepte ye strike yt
ye will be all dustye
In no wise now slype yt
But show your self lusty
for if the mowse myte yt
He will eat yt: trust me
Ty thy mare tom boy
your cursinge and blessinge,
your brethinge and blowynge
your lycking and kissige
your mockinge and mowynge
your tossinge and tissinge,
Stroud myscheue in soinge,
therefore your false missing,
Is now a down throstyng,
Ty thy mare tom boy
A nende of my balet,
Anon I will make you
With pollax nor sallet
In no wise now crake you
for thens by the pallet
all good men will take you
Lock up bag and wallet
and ingland forsake you
Now harken good tom boy
this mare with her baggage
away look thou have her
and make here no tariage
Less ypocrites scraue her
Strong carts for her carriage
She shall have to save her
Let sees make her marriage
for lands will deprave her
away with her tom boy
And clean to despache her
that none may gene say her
With some good poorte match her
as no doubt ye may her
which will so straight watch her
that if men would stay her
At see they should fetch her,
Ye may so convaye her.
and there leave her tom boy
For as she does sealle he
between france and dover:
and there does bewaylle her.
that she is a rouer,
the carte wheles may fayll her
before she come over.
then can she not bayell her,
But be a sea drouer.
therefore leave her tom boy
and in england stay the
where none shall ones crake the
nor never more fray the
Ne yt ones for sake the,
But newly to ray the,
And ever obaye the,
this promise we make the,
there fore tari tom boy.
my song some will mock it
I am not ashamed
the kye to unlock yt
I have not yet framed
the truth yet nocke it
I was mythe inflamed
now forth have I shot yt
let me not be blamed
for now mythe I care not
although I do end yt
to tell all I dare not
and then to come send yt,
But stamp not nor stare not
for it can not mende yt
Finis quod william kythe
An exortacion to the papists
O A papysts repent you
and for mercy cry you
the last day prevent you
for yt is full nigh you
with gods word content you
the pops laws defye you
No longer absente you
But unto Christ hye you
For he is a savior
that will never fail you
if ye will not waver
But mekely bewail you
of your misbeauiour
and forth with apele you
to his grace and favor
He will surely heal you
for so has he told you
By Mathewe his his writer
And also to bold you
by luke his inditer
the stories behold you
Of Paul Johan and Peter
Men does it unfold you
Both in prose and myter
for all this his kyndnes
Which he does yet bear you
As men that were mindles
ye rent you and tear you
Therefore of pain endless
ye had need to fear you
for it is not blyndnes
At last day shall were you
The prophets this tells
Who so list to read them
Which says all that swells
Oor blyndely proceade them
He that above dwells
Shall surely outwyde them
Let they that rebelleth
beware and take hide them
For though god forgeued
Many that offended
and also relyued
Shuch as were sore spended
Yet some he sore grieved
and also condemned
as Judas which fided
with Christ that asscended
Therefore now amend you
And shortly confess you,
To god who may send you,
His spret to possess you
And also defend you,
That none shall oppress you
We will reprehende you
Until ye addrssesse you
Now mekely down sit you,
and this I exorte you
The gospel to get you
and therein to sport you,
if that do ones fyt you,
we would report you,
And this I commyt you
to christ who conforte you
