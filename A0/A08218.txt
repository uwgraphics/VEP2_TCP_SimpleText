All Scripture geeuen by the Inspiration of God* is profitable to Teach, to
Rebuke, to Amendment, and to Information in Righteousness, for that the Man of
God may be perfect, prepared to all good works.

2. Timo. 3. No Prophecy in the Scripture / cometh-to-pas by private

Ghost.

World cast-out.

Now is the Salvation, the Power, and the Kingdom / become our Gods: and the
Might his Christ's.

4. Who has marked whear my Dwelling is, and followed-after Me / in my
Out-going and In-going?

8. Who has borne such a Death Romans 6. a phil. 2. a

Defamation / and showed Patience therein / even unto the Death?

The II. Chap.
DYe lustful Souls to the Mystery 4. Esd. 8. ^.
Mind: and search no farther. For doutles ye Love suffers not herself to be
approched-vnto, understood, nor known / neither for this nor thatt / nor
through any-maner of Cause (let it be by what Means soever it will) nor
thorough any-maner of Mind or Will: but only / by her own virtuous Nature and
louley Being / as through herself or through her Service. For she the
everlasting Good excels it all farr-away.

2. Also / she receaueth nothing of anyman: but She herself reversed;out of
her almighty and virtuous Nature and Spirit; is a plentiful Distributrix of
her own abundant Riches / as an infinite flowing River of all godly Goods,
always Genesis 2. b.
refreshing the Paradise of the Lord.

3. The Love is herself / a Nourice unto her 1. Cor. 13. a.
althings.

4. The Love is also an Exo. 3. ^. 19. b. 20. b.
holy Mountain, the which noman being unhallowed or unprepared / may touch or
com-neere. For whosoever touches the same Mountain / and is not of her Part,
to him is she a consumeing Fire* Whose burning Heat ^sa. 33. b.
noman can endure / but he which is of her like Nature or Seed. Whosoever
resists her, and submits not himself under Her and her Service / He
shall be broken and battered to-peeces / like Psalm. 2. ^. Esa. 30. b. Ier. 1^. a.
^9. b.
a Potters Vessel.

5. THe Love in her Service / is an Original or Beginning of all good and
upright Life. For through her Service / She draws the Minds and Thoughts of
the Heart away from all that is vain, corruptible, and evil.

6. She unbinds or loses the everlasting Perfection, for to com into the
Life of the eternal Vncreatednes / in the Kingdom of the God of Heavens / full
of all pure Beawty / wherein all earthly and corrupt selfmynded Thoughts / do
cease / and whear the corruptible Mortalitee / is not beholden.

Jesus Christ / in full vndisturbable Power / wherein the Minds of the pure
Hearts do dwell free without care or fear / with all Esa. 35.51. a. Apo. 21. a.
Glory and Joy, and with christian Triumph.

8. Which Freedom of the Children of God / which Fulness of the godly Delytes
and of the godly Life / noman can obtain / that hangs his Delight, Will, and
Lyfe^ and tyeth or byndeth himself / on the earthly, visible or corruptible
Being. But they remain vaynly-mynded / in ye Darkness of the vnbeleeueing
Minds* whose Romans ^. ^^ Ep^e. 4. ^^
Hearts are blinded / with the vain Comfort of this World, and of the
good-thinking Wyseones. For which Ignorances cause / they cannot understand ye
right Ground of the secret Love.

9. But Salvation and Luke ^.

Time of 1. Cor 6. ^^ Heb. 12. ^^

and that do euenso with Humble and obedient Hearts / believe or trust the Love
in her Service.

Beginning of the Worlde^ and that is wel-mynded to the Conuertion unto his God /

Estate / for ever.

The III. Chap.
Behold and consider: To that Exo. 25.^. c. Act. 7. c. Heb ^ a.
by Moses; in the foremer Example) for to draw it all under the Love / even as
the same is now likewise reversed;by the holy Spirit of the Love of Jesus Christ;
openly and nakedly declared unto Us / in the true Being. But not by Figures,
Images, nor out of the Letter: but by the Cleernes and Appeering of the Mal. 3

2. This verily is the true Esa. 3. b. Sap. 3. a. Math. 19. c. 1. Cor. 6. a.
Iudae. 1.6.
Coming of Jesus Christ, who appears and comes now unto us / from the
Right-hande of God the Father reversed;who is almighty; to keep a righteous
Judgment upon Earth / even as is written thereof.

3. In which Righteousness / the true Love of God the Father stands
comprehended or grounded: and out of the same Righteousness / has the Love her
Service upon the Earth / to a perpetual Bannishment of all wicked and
euel-willing Nature, and to an everlasting Implanting of the Holyones of God /
into his Love / To thend that the Earth may euenso reversed;through the Love
and her Service; be renewed^ and cleansed from all her Unrighteousness.

Romans 2. a.
Trueth^ and ungodly or evil of Will / shall also be judged in thissame Day /
through the Love and her Service.

5. There shall noman likewise remain standing in the same Judgment / that
resists the Love, and dispeth her Service. For the Esa. 40. a. 60.62. a.
Glory of God is revealed / through ye Revealing of ye Coming of Jesus Christ /
in the Obedience of the Love / for that the Earth may be full of the Number. 14.
c. Psalm 72. b.
Glory of God, according to the Promyses / and that all People may walk in the
Love: and that the Love in her Service / may euenso reversed;as a Light of
Life; flourish for evermore / among the Children of Men, and get the Col. 3. b.
Superioritee in their Hearts / to an everlasting Thanksgiueing unto God / for
their Salvation of Life in the Peace: which reversed;by Gods Grace; is com unto
them upon the Earth / through the Love.

6. Thissame (even as we have here witnessed and declared it) is assuredly the
right Mystery of the Love. It is also the true Laud of the Lord* and the
Triumph of Christ with all his Saints / to an everlasting Establishing of the
Promyses of God the Father: and that altogether / through the 1. Cor. 13.
Love and her Service. Which Love and her Service / shall reversed;according to
the Promyses of God the Father and his Christ; continewe from everlasting to
everlasting. It is verytrue.

The End of the second Epistle.
The Third Epistle. A groundly Instruction, wherein the Difference betwixt God /
the Father, and his Son / the Lord Jesus Christ, is declared / according to
the spiritual and heavenly Understanding.
Holy Father, this is the everlasting Life: That they know Thee / that thou
only art very true God, and Him whom thou have sent / Jesus Christ.

John. 17.
There was demanded by a Lover of the Truth, and an Instruction desyered /
touching the Difference betwixt God / the Father, and his Son / the Lord
Jesus Christ. And ther-vppon is answered by HN / in writing reversed;according
to the Declaring of the spiritual and heavenly Truth; this Instruction
heeraftter following.

The First Chapter.
Beloved Brother desyredst of me / when I was last with thee; because of
certain Matters that were needful for me first-of-al to further. Wher-through I
reversed;by that occasion; have not reversed;hitherto; had convenient time to
accomplish the same.

2. But I have not for-al-that / forgotten thy Demand, nor through
Slothfulnes / neglected to write unto thee: neither do I desire in any-wyse /
to deny thee thy Request: but am always wel-willing to witness the same unto
thee reversed;according to that Understanding which the Lord gives unto me;
so much as it is profitable for thee to Edification. Notwithstanding, I am
burdened in my Heart / because I have promised reversed;upon thy Demand; to
write thee an Answer.

3. But not that the Ground of the Matter reversed;about the which thou have
questyoned with mee^ and desired of me / to answer the same in writing; is so
hard or profound-of-vnderstanding / to answer. O No: but because that the
Understanding of the same Mind / is so utterly unknow Math. 11. c 13. b John.
14. b. Ephe. 3. a.
before all Sense of the Flesh.

4. Yea, how naked and bare soever the Scripture shows it / according to the
Mind of the Spirit / yet can it not for-al-that / be understood 1. Cor. 2. b.
nor conceived by Flesh and Blood / Unless the Man must first reversed;according
to the Counsel of the Scripture; be turned into another Mind.

5. Seeing now that the Scripture of the Christ / is spiritual, John. 5. ^. 6.
g.
and witnesses of Spirit and Life: and that the Man reversed;which reads ye
Testymonyes thereof / in the Letter; stands captiued with a Fleshly Mind /
under Romans 7. ^.
the Sin and his own Good-thinking: and so takes upon Him reversed;out of
the same Mind of the Flesh and his own Good-thinking; to understand the Mind
of God out of the Letter / 1. Cor. 2. b.
So can He not doutles bring it to-pas. For his Fleshly Senses and
good-thinking Thoughts / do surely stretch no farther / but likewise to such an
Intelligence or Knowledge of the Fleshly Understanding.

6. For-that-cause also / the Mind of Man does not reversed;out of the Letter
of the Scripture; understand nor comprehend the Mind of God / rightly:
By-meanes-wherof / there is likewise now at this present day (like as
cam-to-pas also in tymes-past / among Ier. 26. b. 28. a. b. 29. c. d. Math. 12.
c. 23. b. c. d. 26.27.
the worldly Wise and Scriptur-learnedones) much Contention, Variance, and
Controversy / found among the Children of Men / who do contend about Thatt
which they themselves understand not: and will seem to know Thatt / which
according to the Mind of their Understanding reversed;wherein they are
comprehended; is not to be known nor Understood.

1. Cor. 2. b.
our inward Mind; another Spirit for to discern and to understand with-al / 1
Cor. 1.2. b
which is nor of Flesh and Blood. nor-yet minded according to the earthly and
fleshly Wisdom of this World, nor according to ye Prudence of ye Ingeniousnes
of ye worldly Wise and of the co^tentions Scriptur-learned or those of famous
Schools / Therefore do we perceive / that it is perilous to wryt-ouer unto any
man / of the Secretnes of God Ephe. 3. a.
and Christ: And that therefore / we do daily bear a Care or a Suspicion /
whether Those that ask after the Understanding of the godly Truth / do not
desire to know the same Act. 17. c.
out of Curyousnes or Sensualitee, or John. 8. b.
to judge it according to their Good-thinking.

8. Therefore it is dangerous in this perilous Time / to discover or to
wryt-ouer the groundly Depthes Romans 11. d.
of the godly Wisdom / unto anyman / because that we do now find many Men that
do ask / to thend to know much / Yea they seek many Knowledges / whereby to
understand, and to judge the godly Things / out of their Sharpwitednes or
Industry. And thatt lyketh all those well / which have no Lust to do the
Lords Will. For therein lies the old Root Genesis 3. b. Rom 5. b.
of Adam, wherout the disobedient Knowledge springs or cometh-foorth.

9. But to John. 8 c.
submitt themselves obediently to the Requyring of the gracious Word of the
godly Wisdom^ and to the right Service of the Love of Jesus Christ / also to
cleave unto ye liueing God / in his godly Nature or Being / Exo. 20. ^. Deuteronomy.
5. a.
and to serve, to praise, and to honor Him / as He is a God / in his Christ /
thatt lyketh few or none. Yet is the same the new Fruit of the Planting of
Jesus Christ, wher-vnto the Scripture poynteth us / which neither the Math. 11.
c. John. 14 c. 1. Cor 1.2. b
World nor her Wise or Scriptur-learnedones do understand, nor-yet conceive
the Mind. For they know not the same.

10. ALthough I do thus rehearse these 1. Pet. 5. a.
submitt thyself obediently thereunto / to thy Salvation, and to the Ephe. 1. b.
Laud and Praise of the godly Glory: and so to believe the liueing God and his
Christ^ to inclyne unto Him^ and to become 2. Pet. 1. a.
partaker of his Being / then for to know much thereof / according to the
Pleasure of thine Owne-mynde.

11. Therefore also I will not think it tedious unto me to answer thy Demand /
with Diligence / out of fervent Love / If happily God would vouchsafe
reversed;through my small Service; to open EPhe. 1. c.
thine Understanding, and reversed;through his Increase or Blessing; to endow
thee in thy Spirit / with his Grace, and to stirr-vp thy Heart to a pure Mind
toward God, and toward his Love in Jesus Christ.

The II. Chap.
Christ do write / was dark or incomprehensible for thee to understand.
namely, Romans 1. a. 1 Cor. 1. a. 2. Cor. 1. a. Gal. 1. Ephe. 1.
God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. And that in certain Places / Christ
reversed;in steed of the Son; is also vttered-forth for a Father and God.

2. Forasmuch as thy Understanding supposed that ther-was no more but Deuteronomy. 32.
d. Esa. 44. a. 4^ b. 46. b. 1. Cor. 8. a.
One God (as it is also true) therefore was thy Demand thus unto me / whereof
thou requyredst an Answer in Writing: Seeing now that ther-is no more but One God
/ wherefore is He then pronouced-forth in two-maner of States? The which seems
reversed;according to the sound of the Scripture; as though the Apostles
published Two Gods.

3. Verily, the Difference of this Matter reversed;whereof thou desyerest the
Instruction; could not likewise John. 6. d. c. 7. c. 8. b. c.
certain Jews in tymes-past conceive according to their Understanding out of
the Flesh / Yea, the same is yet also rightly understood of Feawe. Yet do many
persuade them selves notwithstanding reversed;because that they in
historical-maner / are minded after the New Testament; that they have
thorowly-well conceived the Understanding of this Mattier: and do
for-that-cause persuade themselves / that they do far exceed and excel the
Jews: supposeing that they have the Faith and the Salvation. and that the
Jews remain by the Works of the Law. Now this passed-ouer, we will proceed
to further the Intent of our Matter.

4. Verily, as we have spoken before / of God / the Father / and the Lord /
Jesus these are hard things before the Man / for to search-out the Understanding
of them / in his Knowledge, if he do not know God and Christ and the true
Righteousness of the godly Being / in Himself / but imagines of God and Christ
/ without Him / and so goeth-on according to his own Good-thinking / without
the Administration of the true Light and his Love. Yea, it is Math. 11. c. 13
b. 19. c. John. 14. ^.
impossible reversed;after that manner; to understand the right Mind clearly.
And although likewise / He would search-out all the Knowledge of the World,
yet is it all in vain / for to understand the same.

5. Although the Man should imagine of the same Mind / in the deepest-grounde
of his Reason, yet can he not doutles reversed;with any-maner of Prudence of
the Flesh; conceive that Understanding. For it is an Understanding / Esa.
57.66. b Sap 1 a. Math. 11. d.
that ryseth not up in the Knowledge but to the Lowely and Poor of Spirit*
namely, in the Belief of the holy and gracious Word / under the Obedience of
the Love.

6. For God / the Father, the Lord / Jesus Christ, nor-yet the true Light of
the godly Wysdom / shall Sap. 1. a. ^. Cor. 2. b.
not be known / out of the Blood or Will of Man, nor out of any deep
Searching with the Knowledge. For God is a John. 4 c.
Spirit, a verytrue Light, John. 1. a. 8. b. 9. a. 11. c. 12. c. 14. a.
and an everlasting Life: which God also / is not known* seen, nor understood
/ but in his own Spirit, and in his true Light and godly Being.

7. Seeing then that the only God / is 1. John. 1. a.
a verytrue Light / that no Darknesses do know nor behold: and is not to be
known nor behealde / but in his Psalm. 36.
Light / therefore is not He known likewise / but by Those that do Hear and
believe his gracious Word, and that submitt them obediently John ^. d.
under the Requyring of the same Word and Will: and so do carry the Image 1.
Cor. 15. c Ephe. 4. c.
of his godly Being, or do behold the same 2. Pet. 1. c.
in their Spirit / as a Pattern of God, and hope thereon / through Faith. And
the Spirit of thosesame obedient Humbleones / is the Spirit that gives respect
to the serviceable Testimonies of the holy Spirit of Love / to thend to be Ioh.
15.17 ^ Ephe. 3. c.
incorporated to the like Being of God [namely, the Brightness of the Cleernes
of the godly Being / the upright Righteousness Ephe. 4. c.
and Holiness that God esteemeth]. and then to know God the Father and his
Son Jesus Christ / rightly and according to the Truth / and to understand the
John. 17. a. Math. 13. b.
Secretnes of the Kingdom of God and Christ.

8. But seeing now that the Man is gon-back Genesis 3. a. Deuteronomy. 32. c.
from his God, and from this pure Beawty and Cleernes of the godly Beeing^ and
Romans 1. c. Ephe 4. b.
estrainged from the Understanding of the Wysdom of Jesus Christ / therefore is
he also become disinherited of this Cleernes or Brightness of the godly Light /
and has neither known the Father nor his Son the Lord Jesus Christ. By
means of which Estraingin^ / He has not borne or carried in his Spirit / 1.
Cor. 15. g. Ephe. 4. c.
the Image or Like-being of his God* namely / Jesus Christ / to which effect /
the Gospel Math. 28. d. Mar. 16. b
or joyful Message / is published, whereby to bring the Man again to Christ,
and to establish him in Him. But Genesis 3. ^.
the Man is reversed;up the Self-wisdom of the Flesh, and by his own Opinion;
quyt lead-away from the upright Mind or Understanding of the Gospel, and from
the Incorporating or Establishing in Jesus Christ / and brought to the
Corruption: and has reversed;with Smart and Calamitee; borne the ungodly
Being or the Contrary-nature unto his God / Sap. 1. b.
to the which / he is neither created nor called.

9. This Contrary-nature unto God or Darkness / has captiued Mar 6. f. 8. b Rom
1. c. ^. Cor 4. a.
his Senses and Thoughts, and stolne-away his Heart and Understanding / so that
he can conceive or understand very-little / of the true Light or Christ of God:
and that only / because he is so utterly estrainged Ephe. 4. b. Col. 1.3.
from the Being of God, and has grounded him on the Knowledge.

The III. Chap.
God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ; is witnessed by the Apostles of
Christ / So must I rehearse a-little of Adam / to what end he was created /
whereby men may understand the Intent / wher-to Christ is preached.

2. WHen the almighty God reversed;who is full of Wisdom and Righteousness; had
finished Genesis 1. a
Heaven and Earth, and all their Garnishing / then did He also create Him a Man
/ Genesis 1. c. 2. a. Sap 3. a. Eccli. 17. a.
according to the Likeness of his Godhead / who should carry or bear the
very-like Being of God and the Image of his Glory / as a fellow-partaker-of or
being-lyke-vnto the godly Nature and Kind. Through which like Being of God /
God would be known everlastingly in the Man / as a true God.

3. Heer-through was God in the Beginning reversed;as a Light of Life; of
one-substance with the manly Creatures. And out of his like Being in the manly
Creatures / God Genesis 2. c.
brought-forth the Memory, for a good and holy Understanding / Because that his
like Being should not be alone in the manly Creatures. but that the Memory
should reversed;in all good and holy Understanding; be an Help Glass. 1^*
or Aid to the like Being of the Godhead in the manly Creatures / to all
Peace and Concord, and to all Love and Welfare upon Earth.

4. Behold, according to all Lyke-resemblance John 1. a. 1. John. 1. ^.
Light and everlasting Life / so is also his like Being / a true Light and
everlasting Life / in the manly Creatures reversed;that are comprehended in the
upright Estate of their manly Being, and in Christ;: in such like-maner also
in them / the Memory / that God has brought-forth out of his like Being.
Which Memory / in thosame manly Creatures [namely, being in their right Estate]
is likewise a Light / of the true Light, and a Life / of the true Life: and
that altogether / to Peace and Righteousness upon Earth.

5. This / in the foremer Kingdom / was Gods Glory in his manly Creatures /
whom He had chosen to himself / to thend that they should 1. Pet. 3. b.
inhabit the Earth with Righteousness: and that euenso ther-through / the
Highest God reversed;as a liueing and true God; and his holy Being and
virtuous Nature / should reversed;as-well upon Earth / as in Heaven; be
known for evermore / in the Spirit of the manly Creatures, and have his Shape
in them, and so live in them.

1. Cor. 15. c. Gol. 1. b.
of all Creatures: and is the true and liueing Christ of God, which cannot be
Psalm 16. b. Act 2. d. 13. d
corrupted: but He continues always Psalm 9. a.
and everlastingly. For He is ye John. 3. b. Romans 1. a.
only-borne Son of God, and a very-true John. 1.14. ^
Light and eternal Life for evermore / like unto his Father.

7. Heer-from has the Man turned him, and seen and tasted the Corruption. But
so has not the Christ of God. For Gods very-like Being the true Christ of God
Ephe. 4. Col. 3.
is the upright Righteousness and Holiness / which is everlasting and Sap. ^. b.
immortal / also vndestroyable, vnchaingable, and incorruptible. But the
Unrighteousness / is the Obteyning of Death, and of the Corruption. Which
Corruption or deadly Mortalitee / Gen 3. a. Romans 5. b. 1 Cor. 15. c.
the Man has taken-on. and ther-through / has horn the Contrary-beeing to
God Sap. 2. c. John. 8. c.
that Antichrist / the like Being of the Devil: and so is dreeuen from the
Beholding of God / Genesis 3. c.
without the Riches of the godly Goods: and has lost the Mercy-seate of his
Salvation.

8. Which Salvation of the Mercy-seate / is Genesis 12.22. ^ Act. 3. c. Gal 3. a.
Abraham and his Seed. And through thatsame / the Blessing of all Generations
of the Earth. After which Salvation / many Math. 13. b Luke 10. c. 1. Pet. 1. b.
Kings and Prophets have sought and inquyred / which they saw-into a farr-of /
as coming: but they could not attain unto it* but have witnessed and
prophesied thereof / that the same should be inherited in all Love* Peace, and
upright Righteousness / in the last time.

The IIII. Chap.
THis Grace of Salvation, and this Adam, did in tymes-past appear in Israel /
out Math. 1. c. Luke 1. g. 2. a.

merci-full unto his chosen People. and has not for gotten his Covenant /
euen-as He had promised to Abraham and his Seed.

2. Euenthus verily was this like Being of God / the true Christ and
only-borne Son of God from eternitee / borne of the Luke 2. a. Romans 1. a.
Seed of David according to the Flesh / to be a Savior to the Generation of
Israel / for to set-vpp Israel in his Righteousness. But certain of the Wise and
Scriptur-lernedones after ye Law / Math. 12. c 15. a. 21. c. d. 27. etc. Act.

3. Yea / so far is the unregenerated man differing from the Mind of God
reversed;although he be wise, prudent, or understanding in the Knowledge and
Scriptur-learnednes; that he reversed;for his own Wisdoms cause; does
understand Math. 11 c. 1. Cor. 2. c.
nothing-at-al of the Mind of God, nor of the Seting-vpp of Israel*
neither-yet can he attain thereunto / with his own Wisdom: like as it has
also com-to-pas with the Wise and Scriptur-learnedones of the Law. And this
Christ of God Luke 24. c. Act. 3. b. 17. a
has bin forced to suffer (Yea / from the Apo. 13. a.
Beginning of the World forth) for the Wisdom of the Flesh and the Sins
cause. And it went with Him / Math. 26. c Luke 22.
as was written thereof: and He was killed on the Earth / with the contemnable

Doctrine / He Luke 24 c

Victory 1 Cor. 15 g.

Father, and the Lord his Son Jesus Christ. The which also Many nodout / do
speak or witness in-that-maner / out of the Letter, and out of the Imagination
of the good-thinking Knowledge: but they are wide of it / according to the
Truth. But These reversed;who Act 2.3. 1 Cor 2 a b 1 John. 1. a.

Wonderful-acts of God / showed on them through Jesus Christ. And Joel 2. d.

God, and that Gods Shape / was in Christ: wher-thorough they likewise were in
Christ* and God in them) have published that Word Grace and Peace from ^od our
Father, and ye Lord Jesus Christ; in the Truth.

John. 1. c
Glory of the only-borne Son of ye Father / full of Grace and Truth: namely,
that God the Father had begotten and declared in them / his like John 1. a 1.
John. 1. a
Life of God / out of his Life, and his like Light / out of his Light.

4. Seeing then that they did bear this like Being of the Godhead / in them /
therefore have they reversed;through the same; known the liueing God / who was
their Salvation: namely, through the Life of God / Jesus Christ, being appeered
unto them Ephe. 3. ^
in the Spirit. Wherthrough they also published the Life that is everlasting:
and so witnessed likewise, that Those which had ^. John. 5. b.
not the Son of God / could not also have the Father / and that they were
without Ephe. 2 b.
God / in this World. For the like Life of God / John 1. a 1 John 1. a 5 b.
is the only-borne Son of God himself. And whosoever refused Him / might not
obtain the Grace before God. For it is so concluded by God for ever / that in
the Son / is the Life of Salvation, John. 10.14. a.
and that it shall also be obtained in Him.

5. THis is verily the Grace of God the John 8. c 14. b. 17. b.
know Him / in his Glory, and his Vniformnes with the Manhod / through the
Lord Jesus Christ. Read. John. 17.

6. Behold, This is the Difference reversed;with a brief Instruction; betwixt
God the Father / and the Lord Jesus Christ.

Take it to heart.

7. MY Service / to content thee reversed;my Beloved; vouchsafe to take in good
part / with a Regard to ye God of the Liueing. And this my Writing reversed;to
the Answering of thy Request; have I reharsed in this manner: seeing other wise
no Mean / for to open the Understanding of the Godhead of Christ, and to
content thee, or to satisfy thy Demand.

8. Behold, I have here witnessed ye Mind unto thee / in Full manner: so that
in this Instruction reversed;so far-forth as the Lord Ephe. 1. c.
do illuminate thine Understanding; there shall be sufficient / to answer thy
Request. And thy Intent of Heart in the Spirit / shall likewise through the
Belief of the Truth reversed;if thou have a right regard heerunto, Pro 4. a
and take thissame to heart; be wel-mynded to our mostholy Service of Love.
The almighty God lead the into his Righteousness. Amen.

The End of the Third Epistle.
The Fowrth Epistle. A clear Instruction of the Mediation of Jesus Christ, that
cometh-to-pas in the Spirit / for a Reconciliation betwixt God and the Man.
Jesus speaks to his Disciples:

I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Noman comes to the Father / but
through Me.

John. 14. a. If any man enter in through Me* he shall be saved.

John. 10 b. I am the Light of the World. Whosoever follows after Me / walks
not in Darkness: but he shall have the Light of Life.

John. 8. b. If any man will follow-after Me, let him forsake himself: and
take-vp his Cross on him / and follow after Me.

Math. 16. c. Luke 9 c. He that takes not up his Cross on him, and follows
after Me, he is not worthy of Me, or he may not be my Disciple.

Math. 10. d. Luke 14. c
There was demanded by a Lover of the Truth, and an Instruction in writing /
desired theruppon / how the Mediation of Jesus Christ reversed;according to the
Spirit, or spiritually; cometh-to-pas in us / Romans ^ a. b.
to our Reconciliation with God the Father: and how Christ is an Heb. 1. a
Heir of all Things: and how 1. Cor. 15. c.
God is all in all.

Wher-vpon this present Letter is written by HN / out of an Inclynation of the
Love: very profitable and needful to the Understanding thereof / for all those
that hope upon God^ upon Christ^ and upon their Salvation / To thend that they
may understand which is the right Ground of the Belief in Jesus Christ /
wherthrough one is justified from the Sin / for to be in-that-sort /
reconciled with God in a new Life, according to the Scripture.

The First Chap.
Christ.

2. But seeing I am always careful, and do stand in fear to write much of the
deep Grounds of the Romans 11. ^*
secret Knowledges of God and Christ / so am I always careful / lest that
the same (if we should write boldly thereof) might thrust-back anyone from Us
and our godly Doctrine, or offend him thereby: or that anyone should desire to
glory or to boste therein / as in a Knowledge of the Flesh. and not before
althings or with his whole Heart / to be partaker in the Spirit / 2 Pet. 1. a.
of the Being whereof we do write or witness.

3. For albeit that we do know well reversed;according to the Comprehention of
our Natural-reason; that there is a God, a Christ, and a holy Ghost / and so do
talk of Them: and yet do not reversed;through that Knowledge; believe, serve,
nor love the same God / as He is a God, and his Christ / as He is a Christ, and
the holy Ghost / as He is an holy Ghost / nor-yet desire to become partakers of
his Being: but to live in a Romans 1. ^ Ephe. 4. b.
strainge Being / which is none of Gods Being, and to cleaue-vnto the same /
So is then the Knowledge of the holy Secretnes of God / more hurtful then
furdersom unto us. For if we know in what Foorme or Being / that there is a
God: and yet do not honor nor serve Him / as He is a God: but have a Lust to
the Contrary-beeing unto God / Then is thatsame to a Mat. 25. c. Luke 12. c
more-greeuous Condemnation unto us.

Esa. 58. b.
Power / in the inward Man / then whear as men do with Speakable-woords
reversed;out of the Knowledge; talk much of the Secretnes of God / according to
the outward Manner.

5. Thou also know partly my Conversation / in what sort it was with thee,
and how fearfully touching many Words / I have behaved myself with thee:
showing thee / that the Math. 13.
Secretnes of the Kingdom of God or Christ / consists not 1 Cor. 2 a.
in the Multitude of Words, nor in the Riches of the Knowledge / Because that
thou should not suffer thyself to be bewitched by Anyman with outward or
strainge Words or Sayings of plentiful-store of Languages / as to let thine
Heart committ Whordom therewith. But that thou moughtest have a much-more regard
unto the Power of God, and unto the upright Righteousness that God works
through the Ministration of his gracious Word and Service of Love / in ye
Spirit of the inward Man / to thend for to live uprightly therein / with a
meeke-mynded Spirit. For a meekemynded Psalm. ^. b Esa. 57. b 61. a. 66. a
Spirit reversed;which has his Proceeding obediently / according to the
Requyring of the Lords Word; is very precious and acceptable before God.

6. And although that we do reversed;in the same Spirit; Christ / do we esteem
very Job. 28. b. Psalm. 19 b. Pro. 3 b 8 b Sap. 7. b.
precious / Yea much worthyer then all the Riches or costly Treasures of this
World: for thatsame reversed;of worthynes-part; excels it all. For which
Occasion / we let our Words be feawe / because that the same which we speak /
may not proceed out of the Knowledge. but out of the 1. Cor 2. a. b
Power of God, and out of the Truth of Jesus Christ.

7. And in the same Speech of ye godly Things / we do also take-heede with
Foresightfulnes reversed;so much as we may therein; of the Looseones of Heart /
to thend that there be not one godly Saying of the precious secret Wisdom /
spoken-out in Vain. O / how Eccli. 14.25 Ieam. 5 a
happy is he / that falls not in his Tongue, and whose Words Col. 4. a.
are tempered with Salt.

8. NOw this being omitted. I rejoice me doutles / of the, and of the
Communialte means of the Answer unto me / that I have heard from thee / As
that ye altogether / are wel-mynded to Thatt which is the Being itself /
whereof the Scripture witnesses reversed;as personally; of God, of Christ, and
of the holy Ghost. Which Being reversed;for those that be partakers thereof; are
the secret Treasures and Math. 13 c
heavenly Riches of God / whereof the Worlde^ the rich Scriptur-learnedones^
nor the Good-thinking-wyse reversed;with all their deep-groundly Knowledge; do
neither know nor understand Math. 11 c 1. Cor. 2. a.
anything-at-al.

9. It is true, they have the Scripture of the godly Witnesses: wher-through
they suppose to be wise and understanding. But seeing they give not their
Understanding captive under the Obedience of the Love of Jesus Christ, and com
John. 5.
not euenso to the Being / whereof the Scripture speaks, nor-yet believe
thereon / John, 7. d
as the Scripture says / So is-ther likewise no Light, nor Truth, nor-yet
Spirit nor Being of God / among them / and they also do neither know nor
Math. 22 c. 1. Tim 1. a
understand Thatt which they themselves speak thereof.

10. But the God of Life reversed; Ephe. 2 a
who is rich of Mercy; has reversed;out of his hearty Love; Ephe. 1. a 2. a
3. a. Col. 1. d.
revealed the Being of his Glory unto vs^ renewed our ignorant Understanding
reversed;under the Obedience of his Love; to a spiritual Mind of the upright
Righteousnes^ and reversed;when we were full of Infirmitees, Romans 5. a. b.
Ephe. 2. a. Col. 1. c. 2. b
and deadd / for the Sins cause; begotten us again / out of his Love / Tit.
1. a. 5. a*
to a sure Hope of his Life.

11. Seeing then that Heb. 12. ^.
such a Cloud of holy 2. Cor. 4. ^
aryseth unto us / as a Light and Cleernes: Therefore have we reversed;although
the Scripture witnesses thereon, and that we do hear many speak thereof; more
regard unto Thatt which is the upright Being itself reversed;wherein our Joy
stands; then unto Thatt which witnesses thereon.

12. For the same Light that shyneth now unto Us / out of the heavenly Truth /
1. John 1. a.
is the everlasting Life, which was with the Father / in the Beginning: and it
is Psalm. 45. a Heb. 1. a.
the Mercie-seate of the godly Maiestee, which continues from everlasting to
everlasting: Euen-as I likewise have talked with thee of the same / when I was
last with thee.

The II. Chap
FOrasmuch then as thy Request was unto me at that time / to write Jesus Christ
after the Spirit: and how the same cometh-to-pas in us / Romans 3. ^ 2. Cor. 5. b.
Ephe. 2. b. 1. John. 2.4. ^
for a Reconciliation betwixt God and us: and how Christ is Heb. 1. a
an Heir of all Things: and how 1. Cor. 15. c
God is all in all / Therefore will I open a little of the same unto thee: and I
hope also to satisfy the well with this Instruction.

2. Inasmuch then as I have partly marked thine Inclynation to the holy and
spiritual Understanding of the upright Righteousness / therefore can I not of
Natures-part omit / but must witness unto the of thatt which thou desyrest at
my hands / also reveal the Ephe 3. a
Mystery of Christ / and make-knowen unto thee / thatt which is hidden Romans 15.
c Ephe. 1 a 3 a Col. 1. c.
before the World and all her Wyseones / and discribe it unto thee in writing
/ accordingly as the Lord illuminateth mine Understanding thereto, and as it
may be profitable for thee to Edifycation.

John 4. c. 2 Cor. 3. b.
a Spirit* and a 1 John. 1. a
verytrue Light / with whom no Darknesses or Sins are mingled. But seeing
that the Man is fallen Genesis 3. a Esa. 59. b.
into a strainge Contrary-beeing unto God, and goeth-on and lives therein / So
is he likewise Ephe. 4 b. Col. 1. c
estrainged from God and from his Light: and walks according to the Flesh or
Outward, and according to the Requyring and Desires of the Foreskinne of his
uncircumcised Heart / and not according to the Spirit, or according to the
Requyring of the godly Being: and so He Psalm. 82. a Ephe. 5. a
walks in the ungodly Being of the Darknesses: and thatsame ungodly Being
of the Darknesses Romans 1. c. Ephe 4. b.
has blinded his Heart. And thatt verily is the Sin, Esa. 59. a.
which seperateth the Man from his God: and it is the Ephe 2 b
Middle-wal / as an Enimitee betwixt God and the Man. By means of which
Middle-wall / both God and the Man / are grown into two Parts, and are
partially-mynded against ea^hother. Yet ought they both reversed;God and the
Man; to be John. 17. ^ ^ Ephe. 5. d
One, like as it was Genesis ^. ^.
in the Beginning.

4. Seeing now therefore that they are divided reversed;either of them in his
own Mind; Gal. 5. b.
against each-other / so is God reversed; John. 4. c. 2 Cor. 3. b.
who is a Spirit; spiritual and minded to all upright Righteousness / against
the Mind of the Man: and the Man reversed;who is Genesis 6. ^.
Flesh and Blood^ and not yet circumcised Genesis 10. b. Ier, 4. a. 9. c.
on the Foreskinne of his Heart / to a Laying-away of the Sin; Romans 8. a.
is fleshly and ungodly minded / against the Mind of God.

5. Now does Gods Love and Mercy extend John. ^. c.
and drawing him daily reversed;by his gracious Word and Service of Love, and
by his Ministers; unto Him and to his spiritual Mind of upright Righteousness.
But seeing that the Darkness / the sinful Flesh or ungodly Being / is grown
betwixt God and the Man / as a Foreskinne Esa. 59. ^ Ephe. 2.
or Middle-wall, and as an Enimitee: and that God / is spiritually minded, and
the uncircumcised Man / fleshly minded / according to the Mind of his
Foreskinne of the sinful Flesh / Therefore does not the Rom ^ 1 Cor* ^^
Man understand the spiritual Mind of God the Father, neither-yet know the
good Will of God / that loves him to Salvation: and he believes not God in
his Word nor Service: but he believes the Darknesses which have enclosed him:
and following thosesame Lusts Ephe. 4. b
of Error / he goeth-back: and so sins daily against the Father. And thatt
is the Sin that is Math 12. d.
forgeeuen the Man / in his Repentance for the Sin, because of his Ignorance
/ through Unbelief.

Intro. 22.23
Introduction to the holy Understanding of the Glass of Righteousness. But now
for to com to the Knowledge of ourselves, and to a good Knowledge of our God and
his Righteousness / So will we (to a larger Declaring of our Understanding /
touching thatt whereof we speak, and to a Distincting of the true Light / ye
liueing God / who Heb. 13. a.
was, and is, and continues for ever) rehearse and testifye here in this
place also / of the Being of the only God.

2. This God the Liueing and Verytruone is the true (...) 3.1
God of Abraham, through whom the (...). 12. a Romans 4. a b

true God of Act. 7. g.

is a verytrue vnchaingable Light. a clear Ephe. 1.4. b. Apo. 21.22.

3. This Light / is the John. 14 a.
euerlasting^ Life of the upright Righteousness / an ouerflowing Psalm 42. a.
Ier. 2. c. John. 4. b.
Fountain of liueing Waters / full of Joy, full of all Sweetness, full of
Love, and full of Peace / abounding with Plenty of Grace and Mercy.

4. This Life / is the Iohd. 1. a.
everlasting firmestanding 1. Cor 2. a. Heb. 4. b.
full of Power and Possibillitee.

5. This Word / is the John. 6. g. Ephe. 1.6 4 d. Intro. 23.
true Spirit, with full Power of Sealing, or to an everlasting Establishing of
the liueing Godhead / with the Manhod. And thatt is unto the Man / the
Certentee of the Truth / that He the same God is only Psalm. 116. b. John. 3.
d. Romans 3. a.
a very true God.

6. This Spirit / is Sap. 7. c.
the holy Wisdom, and the upright Understanding / full of all spiritual
heavenly Goods.

7. This holy Wisdom and upright Understanding / is Eccli. 1. ^.
the Providence, which foreseeth euery-thing / that is good: and discerns
Life and Death / and gives Knowledge of the Good / Pro. 2. ^.
to a Warning from the Evil.

8. This Providence / is the Will, Sap. 1. b.
which wills that all thatt which is good / should be, and com-to-light.

9. In thissame good Will / is Heb. 11. a.
the Belief grounded, as a sure and firm Confydence / that all thatt which is
good, and foreseen to the Good / shall be performed or com-to-light: the which
the good Will desires / that all thatt which is good / may be, become
manifest, and live.

10. The Belief / 1. Cor. 2. a. Ephe. 1. c. 3. c Phil. 3. c.
is the Power, as mighty to bring-to-light all Good / ther-through.

11. This Power / is the Deed or the Work of all Good, and Phil 2. b.
the Accomplishment of all the Works of God.

12. Behold: Such a Spirit or Being / ^en. 1. a. Psalm. 3^. a. John. 1. a.
Ephe. 3. a.
all that is anything. And all his Psalm. 19. a. ^9. a. 97. a. Romans 1 c.
Works do testifye of Him / that He the same God is an everlasting, liueing,
and true God / To thend that He only / should be Deu. 6.10. b
served, honored, and worshipped in all his Works / as a great glorious God,
Psalm. 10.29. b
who only is the Lord and King.

13. This everlasting God, seeing that He has made Pro. 8. b. John. 1. ^.
all that is anything / through his like Being (for that the same like Being /
should he Heb. 1. ^.
an Heir in all Things) has also in the Beginning / foormed Genesis ^. c. Sap. 2.
c.
Thatsame his very-like Beeing^ in the Man: And so has God made and ordained
euery-thing Eccli. 39. ^*
well / through his godly Being. And John. 1. a.
without thatsame Being / God has made nothing that is any what, nor ordained
anything / without the same: and thatsame like Being of his Godhead / John.
1.6. g
is his only borne Son / Jesus Christ, and is the 1. Cor. 15. c. Col. 1. c.
Firstling or the Firstborn of all Creatures / whom God has foreseen thereto
/ Pro. 8. c.
ereuer the Foundation of the World was laid, Heb. 1. a.
and to be an Heir of all his Works.

14. He is promised John 3. b. Rom 8. d.
and given unto us by God the Father reversed;as a Christ of God; for a Life
and for a Salvation: and is likewise so Psalm. 19. a. Act. 2.3. etc.
preached and published to the World. But the World has not believed in Him:
and therefore also Ihon. 8.9. ^.
remains her Sin and Death.

15. For in noman else but in thatsame only Christ, John. 1.
is the Life. Which Life / is a Light of Men: and that Light shyneth in the
Darknesses: and the Darknesses have not comprehended it.

16. Thatsame is a verytrue Light, John 8. b.
which lights all Men / through his Coming into this World: and He was in
the World, and the World was made through Him, but the World knew Him not.

17. He came into his Own, and his Own received Him not. But so many as
received Him / to them gave He the Power to be Children of God. namely, Those
that believed on his Name / which are not borne of Blood, nor of the Will of
the Flesh, nor-yet of the Will of Man / but of God.

The IIII. Chap.
Esaias does also witness: Esa. 9. a
A Child (says he) is borne unto us, a Son is geeuen unto us: whose
Dominion / is upon his Shoulders: and He is called / Wonderful, Counsel,
Power, Giant, everlasting Father, a peaceable Prince / Because that his
Dominion may be great, and no End of the Peace / upon the Seat of David and
his Kingdom.

2. Him has likewise the Prophet David seen in the Spirit, and witnessed of
Him / that God has Psalm. 110. a. Heb. 5. b. 7 b
sworn reversed;and it shall not repent Him; that He is a Priest for ever /
after the Order of Melchisedech: and He continues also an High-preest Heb.
3.10. c
over the House of God / for ever / as Heb. 8.9. b.
a Minister of the spiritual and heavenly Goods. Which Ministration
cometh-to-pas in the Spirit / and not in the Letter, even as is written of Him.

Genesis 3. a. Ephe. 4. c. Col 1. ^.
or estrainged from this upright Being of his God / Therefore has this Christ
the true Lamb of God suffered Phil. 2 a.
the Death of the Cross in the Man. Which Lamb of God / was killed Apo. 5.13.
b
from the Beginning of the World / for the Sins cause. But seeing He is not of
the Death: but of the liueing Father / the God for ever / therefore is He also
risen Mar. 16. b. Luke 24. c. Act. 2. c. 10 c 1. Cor. 15. ^ Col. 1. b.

himself at the 1. Cor. 15. c.
Right-hande of God his Father / in the heavenly Being, bearing the Dominion /
till that all his Enemies be laid under his Feet, to a Conquering of Sin
and Death / through Faith.

4. THis is that Jesus Christ / which reversed;like as He was preached before,
and Act. 1. 1. Tess. 5. c. 2. Tess. 1. a.

5. Thissame was in tymes-past published in Mar. 16. b. Luke 24. f. Act. 1.2.
etc.
for a Gospel or joyful Message / to thend yt all those which were burdened
with Sin and captiued with Darknesses / should be baptized or washed Romans 6
a. Col. 2. b.

Him 2 Cor. 4. b* Phi. 3. b.

that they might euenso then reversed;in the Spirit; have their fellowshipp
with Christ / Ephe. 2. a.

Christ, to an everlasting Reconciling of the Man with God, or to an John. 17.

2. Therefore behold, and consider in thine Understanding / my Beloved, how
that now in the last time / the same liueing God reversed;out of Grace /
undeserved; is 2. Cor. 4. a. 2 Timo 1. b.
appeered unto us / out of his holy Heaven / and dwells, 2. Cor. 6. b. Apo.

the Belief and the Obedience to the Requyring of the same God / is required of
all Men, Ephe. 4. ^

3. So consider then, whearsoeuer the same liueing God of Heaven and his Goodness
reversed;as an upright Being and verytrue Light, and as the right Father of
his like Being and Ieam. 1. ^
Light for ever; and his Will and Requyring reversed;as a fatherly Love / to
the Man's Preservation in the Godlynes; is administered / in the Ministration of
his gracious Word under the Obedience of the Love (of whose Being and upright
Form / we have witnessed before) and that then likewise in the same
Administration / Belief and Obedience is showed by the Man / in the same Will
and Requyring of God / euen-thear reversed;in the Belief; is the same liueing
God seen and know / like as He reversed;according to the Spirit; is an
upright Being Ioh. 1. ^. ^. b. 1. John. 1. ^.
and verytrue Light / for a Life of Men^ and the right Father of his like
Being and Light: thear is also seen and known that the same Gods Procreation
or Seed / is likewise his upright Being and verytrue Light / and is euenso
reversed;in the Beleeueing and Obeying of the same Administration; proceeding
from the same Father / and that the same is wholly and altogether of one-mynde
and John. 17. c. Col. 8. ^.
of one-substance with the Father / and is the true Christ himself / and geteth
in-that-sort / his Foorme in the Man.

to those is He also seen and known rightly in the Spirit: and He is likewise
of John. 17. c.
one-substance with them / in all Love and upright Righteousness.

Obedience of the Loue^ and reversed;at the appointed time; borne again by us

of the Seed of David according to the Flesh / is in all points minded Math.
26. d. John. 4. d. 6 d. 8. c.
according to the Will of God his Father: and his Will is / that all what is
good / should be: and He bears in us / the Phil. 2. a. Heb. 2. b. 5. a
Image of the earthly Man, and suffers with us for our Sins.

8. But now when the Believer of his gracious Word / has. 2. Pet. 1. b.
regard obediently unto his gracious Word / according to the Requyring of his
Service of Love: and that euenso reversed;in his Belief and Obedience; the same
Word begins to appear or breake-thorow / as a verytrue John. ^. a. 2. Cor.

Light of the upright Life and like Being of the perfect Cleernes of God^ and

only in the same Light and Life of his like Cleernes and upright Righteousness.
For thatt is his beloved Son his spiritual heavenly Being whom He has
geeuen unto us for an everlasting Heb. 1. a.
Heir, to thend that we should live through Him.

9. Seeing now that the Lord the God Genesis 6. a. Romans 7. b^ ^
and minded to the Sinne^ and vnbeleeueing and disobedient to the Requyring of
God in the Ministration of his gracious Word and Service of Love / Therefore
has God reversed;according to such a Mind of the Man; no Romans ^. a.
pleasure in the earthly Man / nor-yet the earthly Man / in God, nor in his
Requyring.

10. But seeing now that the only-borne Math. 16. b. Luke 9. c. John. 6. g.
Son of God the Father according to the Spirit [namely, Christ / the like Sap

Image of the earthly Manhod / as-wel as the Image of ye heavenly Godhead /
Therefore it is not his Will that the Man reversed;whom He has created Sa^. 1.

earthly Man^ Eze. 18.3^. ^ 2. Pet. 3. a.

with Him and with his Spirit / in the upright Righteousness of his heavenly
Being / and that all Men likewise reversed;which love God and his
Righteousness; should be assembled into the same Being, and be saved both in
Soul and Body.

11. Behold, the same forementioned Christ and Son of God reversed;who for
our Sins cause / has suffered in us the Death Romans 6. a. Phil. 2. a.
of the Cross, and armeth us 1. Pet. 4. a.
with the same Mind of his Suffering and Death; makes known unto us (as is
before said) through his Service of Love / his upright Being of Righteousness.
And in our good Will to the same / He brings his Belief unto us: and so in the
Belief / He himself Esa. 53. b. 2. Pet. 2.
bears our Sins, and iustifyeth Romans 3.8. ^. Gal. 2. b.

Patience, He 1 John. 1.4.
reconcileth us before his Father, and makes his John. 14 c* Apo. ^1. a.

12. Euenthus verily with Patience does Christ com before the Man reversed;for
his Romans ^. a. 2. Cor. 12. ^. Heb 5. ^.

and brings the beleeueing and obedient Man / to his spiritual and heavenly
Mind of the upright Righteousness, according to the Mind of God his Father:
and euenso reversed;as the 1. Tim. 2. a. Heb. 9. b.
true Mediator / to our Reconcilment with God the Father; He putteth-away the
Esa. 59. a. Ephe. 2. b.
Middle-wall betwixt God and Us: and procures the Man / that he unites him
with a good Will / with the Godhead, John. 17. c.

14. Behold, and have a good regard heerunto / my Beloved. for euenthus (as is
rehearsed) is Romans 5. a.

Alter of the Offering of Christ / Heb. 9. b. c. 10. a. b.

sprinkled with his Blood of the true Testament, to the Forgiveness of Sins,
and to an everlasting Reconcilment with God the Father / through Faith. and
thatsame is the Fulfilling of the true God-seruice in the Holy.

17. Through which Fulfilling of the foregoing Service in the Holy / the godly

have witnessed before of God the Father; does then live substancially in us:

The Fifth Epistle. A Stirring-vp of the Heart to the Immitation or Following of
Christ / in the Suffering of his Cross: Written and sent by HN in the time of
his Suffering and Affliction / unto his Freende. Wherewith he informs him /
with Understanding and Words of Humilitee / because that he should not
growe-offended in any things but always hope on the Goodness of the Lord.
My Friends have thou reversed;O Lord; put far from me, thou have made me
loathsome unto them: I lie captiued, and cannot com-foorth.

Mine Eye is sadd with Misery: Lord / I call daily unto thee, and I
stretch-out my Hand to thee.

Psalm. 88.
Health and Salvation / be unto thee my Freende, whom I love to the
Righteousness.

The First Chapter.
Psalm. 18. a. 2. Tess. 2. a.
Breaking-thorow the sinful Being / for to com to the Kingdom of God: and
that thou (as far as I could perceive) had little Sight or Discerning
thereof: and that me thought also / that thou reversed;up reason of mine
Affliction; did more estrainge thyself from me / then get an
Hearty-affection toward me / So is therefore my Spirit become inclyned to write
a little unto thee. Wherewith I do show / that I rest still in hope that God
would lighten thine Heart a little / with the holy Light of his godly Being,
Ephe. 1. c.
and grant thee to see or to discern / the right Meaning of my Words that I
have spoken with thee.

2. For I am very certain and sure of this / if the Lord open the Door of
Understanding unto thee reversed;whereby to see-into the upright godly Being /
Gal. 4. a. Ephe. 4. a. Apo. 21. a.
that ought to have a liueing Foorme in us; that thou likewise / shall know
the same wheru^to I am inclyned with Desire and with all my Heart. and after the
which / I reversed;in the Hope; do carry a Zeal or apply my Diligence / for
to obtain the same of the God of the Liueing, if He the Almighty vouchsafe the
Grace unto Me Vnworthyone.

3. But now am I in many Men's Eyes reversed;as also happily in thine; very ougly
and loathsome. and therefore 1. C^^. 4. b.
contemnable and reiectable with Many. But all this comes upon me / because
that I am so exceeding weak Psalm. 6. a. 2. Cor. 12. b Apo. 3. c.
and feeble: and of myne-owne-part / have no Righteousness with me. nor any
Esteemation / according to the outward Man of the Flesh.

4. ALthough reversed;my Beloved; that I seem 2. Cor. 6. ^
by them / with many false Bruits / Yet wonder not thou neither be offended at
the same, as yt thou should therefore turn thy Heart from the Service of Love
and from Me.

5. For truly / in that all this cometh-vppon me, or in that I am a little
while Psalm. 8. ^.
forsaken by the Power of my God: and do find myself reversed;of
myne-owne-part; 2. Cor. 3.^2.
so vnmighty to the Righteousness of God: and am contemned, blaspheamed, and
falsely defamed or accused by Many / it happens because that I should not
in-any-wyse be stout in my Heart^ nor boast myself upon mine own Knowledge and
Works, nor-yet upon any Tess. 2. a. Gal. 1. b.
Praise or Comendation of Men^ but highly esteem of the Grace of God / to
thend that the Lord reversed;and not I; might even so have Psalm. 114 b.
all Laud, Honor, and Praise. For He only is the Lord, to whom only / all
Honor does likewise appertain.

Psalm 4 a.
leads his Holyones wonderfully: and how that God Psalm. 129. b. Apo. 15. a.
is wonderful in his Works.

7. For 1 Reg. 2. a. Psalm. 113. a. Luke 2. f.
He makes rich, and poor again: and then He makes rich again / because
that men should euenso know his Riches rightly, and love them according to
their Value.

8. He brings the Man into a wide Psalm. 18. c. 31. a. 119. c.
Room, and again into great Straightnes and Contempt. and out of the
Straightnes and Contempt / into a wide Room again / because yt he should
rightly know his wide Roome^ and live therein uprightly.

2. Therefore let not thy Heart be moved for any-maner of thing that thou see
or hear outwardly: but submitt thyself reversed; 1. Pet. 5. b.
with all Humilitee; under the mighty Hand of God, and giue-ouer thyself
altogether unto his Will.

3. Choose not also any particular thing in Gods Works: But look that thou

Cor. 3.4. a
that the Power for to accomplish the Righteousness of God / is not the Mans^
but reversed;so much as it remains with us; only the Lords.

5. For / for his own sake, and for the Praise of his holy Name / He will not
2. Pet. 3. a.
forslowe himself to perform his Work / to our Salvation / to thend that He
may establish his Promyses in us / if we stand pliable unto Him with submitted
Hearts.

6. But not for our Works cause* for that no Flesh 1. Cor. 1. c. Ephe. ^. a.
should bost itself; but for his own cause, and for his holy Names sake /
because that He the great and almighty God and his Math. 6. b.

7. Wherefore, Because now that no Flesh of Adam, or of the earthly Man / Psalm
14.53. a. Romans 3. b.
has any Understanding of the Works of God / I can therefore talk very little
of thosesame / with the Children of Men: but must stretch-out my Heart unto my
God, and speak before Him:

which was from eternitee, and remains a liueing and true God for evermore:
Who also works every Thing without Respect of Persons, or Counsel of
anyman? For thy Will goeth-forth / according to thy Pleasure: and thy Work
Sap. 11. d. Romans 9. c.
can noman withstand.

10. Therefore must I laud thee / O my God. For thou have brought my Soul
Psalm. 30. a. 50. b 86. b 116. a.
out of the Deapth of Hell. and kept me / when I was in the Extremitee Psalm.

11. O my God, seeing thou have hitherto / kept me from the Destruction / so let
not thy Grace now likewise depart from me (although I be a Loathsomnes and
Psalm. 31. b. 44. b. 79. a. 88. a. 1. Cor. 4 b.
Reproach before many Men:) but hold me always by Psalm. 10^. a.
thy Right-hande: hand: and Psalm. 119. d.
teach me through thy Law / for that mine Enemies reversed;which make-vp
themselves against me / for to destroy me; may depart from me: and make known
unto them / that thou have chosen Me to be an Instrument for thy Work.

12. When As now reversed;O my God; mine Enemies do perceive that thou do
teach and govern me. And that it is thy Work / which thou reversed;to thend
to perform it; have begone with me / Then shall they well understand / that
thou reversed;O Lord; art my God* and I / the Ephe. 2. b
Work and Instrument of thy Hand, which thou have accepted unto thee / for to
accomplish thy Will.

13. Now reversed;O Lord; lead me on-forward Psalm. 5. a.
thy Righteousness / that I reversed;through thy Grace showed on me; may praise
thy holy Name^ and highly laud and thank thee / in thy Righteousness.

14. For truly / the Ungodly Psalm. 14. a. 53. a. Romans 3. b.
know thee not: the Dispisers and Blaspheamers / find not thy Dwelling: the
Sencles and Self-wyseones / ask not after Thee O God: in the Psalm. 6. a. ^8.

Death / men do not remember thee: thy Song-of-prayse / is not soung in the
Hell: the Hipocrites or feigned Holyones, nor-yet the false Hearts and

c.
Spirit and Service of Love, or murmur ther-against; seek not thy Grace:
neither do any of all those likewise / which iustifye or account themselves
faithful / ^om to be a Foote-bench under thy Feet.

15. Seeing then that all these are Straingers unto thy Righteousness and Holiness
/ therefore art thou also reversed;O my God; only holy, only righteous, and only
true.

16. Therefore reversed;O my God; give thy Spirit into my Inwardnes: Psalm. 51. b.
create in me / an upright Heart / that is lovely before thee, and that
walks vnfalsly: and give likewise thy Word always into my Mouth / so may I
then praise thee / before all those that love thy Truth, also declare thy
Righteousness, and magnifye thy Name. For otherwise reversed;O God; it is all
nothing before thee.

reversed;with a clear Sight; looke-into the Preservation of Men / in thissame
horrible and daingerous Time.

and daingerous Time / all Errors, Misunderstandings, and all Spirits of the
false Light / do now exceedingly beare-swaye. Wherthrough ther-is now also
verytruly known unto me / the manyfolde Ignorance, and the ignorant
Confidence of the Children of Men / upon the vain or unprofitable Wisdom: and
how utterly the Understanding of Man / has corrupted Genesis 6. a.
his Way / in the Knowledge. The End of which corrupt ignorant Knowledge
reversed;which is an Horror to think upon; is com before the Lord.

2. Thou Beloved, look rightly into the Truth of this Matter. For whear no
Distinction is witnessed / as that one distincteth not the Things whereof he
speaks / with Sensiblenes of Words, but speaks them forth only with
Boasting and Pride and out of Partia^^tee or Dispyte / So is theare likewise /
the right Difference hardly to be conceived / by those that hear the same.

3. It is true nodout / that it has gone wonderfully with Me. For thatt which
is happened unto me / is also wonderful to myself Psalm. 118. c.
in mine own Eyes. But to be quitt of all thatt which was Mine reversed;which
was mine own / and not the Lords, and had captiued me; / after thatt have I

Righteousness; bent my self goodwillingly / to giue-ouer Math. 16. b. 19. c.
and to forsake it all / so farr-foorth as I could know it^ and obtain the
Grace before God thereto. but not the holy Understanding / which is com unto me
out of the liueing Godhead / under the Obedience of the Love. Of the which (as
I suppose) he happly that has told thee of this Matter / has not distinctly
understood the Ground thereof / in his Secretnes, and therefore has not told
the same rightly unto thee. but as his good-thinking Mind did judge it /
according to his own Conceaueing.

labored ther-after in tymes-past / with Ignorance, and without any Difference.

5. But the God of Heaven / who is rich of upright Understanding and godly
Wisdom / has looked upon me with merciful Eyes / in mine Ignorance: and
caused me reversed;through his Grace: to see-into mine Ignorance, and into my
untimely or unfruitful Zeal. And so by the Discerning of mine own Ignorance
/ I also saw into the vain Race, Romans 10. a. Gal. 4. b.
and the ignorant Zeal of many Men, wherein they sought the Salvation.

6. Now when I saw into all this, and hoped daily upon Gods Mercy, and upon
the Coming of his Math. 6. b. Luke 11.17. c
Kingdom / then did the God of Heaven illuminate my Heart / with his Cleernes:
and the Luke 17. Romans 14. b. Apo. 12.21. ^.
Kingdom of God in his perfect Beawty and Garnishing / came from on High into
my Sight, and I beheld in the Spirit / Gods most-pure Being, the Mostholy of
the true Tabernacle of God and Christ, and the most-vpright lovely Life of
Peace / in the which / I reversed;with the Beholding thereof; rejoiced me
to-exceedingly: and thought not once / that there might yet some Vnpeaceablenes
lie hidden.

7. When I now rejoiced my self so wholly Fig. 1.2.4. ^
upon the Kingdom of the perfect Beawty and of the upright lovely Life and
Peace.

8. But now when I loved Caut. 5.4.5
thissame as my Best-beloued, I made none accounte of al mine Enemies: neither
had I also any Fear that-ther should be anything that could hurt me.

9. But in this my Boldness / mine Enemies were subtle and crafty: and played
or dallyed with me as my Friends, and were very freendly unto me. Wher-with
they deceived me, and traitorously took me captive, whereof I was not aware.

The III. Chap.
Psalm. 32. b. c. 33. a.
which were daily conversant with me according to the Flesh, and which were
also my Friends according to the Flesh / then did the Sleep in the mean time
/ take-holde of me: and I rested boldly with them / as with my Friends.

2. Thewhiles now I yet slept, and that the Night was com-on er-euer I awaked /
so bound they me very-fast / Psalm. 40. b.
with strong Bands, and brought me whether they would.

3. But now when I was awakened-vp from my Sleep, and opened mine Eyes / then
was it altogether dark in the Place whear they had brought me: and I knew not
whear I was, neither-yet knew the Place whear I found myself.

4. I likewise saw no Beawty nor Life of Peace / in the same Place: For thatt
was then hidden from me, or I was brought out of it / in my Sleep: but I saw
that those which seemed to be my Friends / had turned Psalm. ^8. b.
themselves about against me / as Enemies.

5. Then was I sore grieved, and woeful of Heart: and I missed the sweet
Waters which I before-tyme had tasted out of the liueing Fountain. And in my
Suffering and Wofulnes / my Refreshing was with bitter Waters.

6. And the heavenly Being of the liueing Godhead reversed;wherout the lovely
Deaw and the Ioyful-oyle came unto me in tymes-past; did I well remember: but
thatt was to my greater Grief. For I could not find the same. But an hellish
horrible Being / shone-about me / wherein I behealde nothing-els but Woe,
Sorrow, and Misery. And round-about me / it was full of horrible Enemies: and
eueryone sought after my Life / for to devour me. And those that before /
seemed to be my Job. 19. b. Psalm. 38 b
Friends / did also rage all at me / like hellish Dogs: and crying-out their
own Wickedness / they did eueryone Apo. 12.
accuse me. and that I was full of Unrighteousness or Wickedness, and must be
damned in the everlasting Pain of the hellish Fire.



8. But when I was aware that I was bound by them, then I lamented sore over
my Bands / because that I reversed;by reason thereof* might not smyte-doune
mine Enemies. For I was kindled with Wrath toward them / because I had showed
them nothing but Freendshipp, and that they recompensed it me with Evil.

9. But when as I reversed;in my Sorrow; thought upon the Light and Life of
Peace / which I myssed, then was I out-of-measure sorrowful. And then cried I
to the Lord, and my Lamentacion and Complaynt was heard farr-abroade among the
People.

10. I wrote also my Moorning-songs, and there went-out from me / a doleful
Dittee: but there came none that did release me from my Bands / wherein I was
traitorously bound.

11. Somm now lamented my Case: and I was also by Somm / mocked and laughed-at^
and many grew offended at me, and spoke all Evil of me, and brought-vpp many
evil Bruits of me, wherewith they falsely belyed me. And whearsoeuer I went or
stood / thear did mine Enemies incompas Psalm. 22.^8. b. 109. a.
me, and were still rounde-about me.

and asked in every Way / after the same lovely Being of Gods heavenly Beawty
/ which I reversed;in Cleernes and Righteousness; had both seen and loved. The
One told me this, the Other poynted me on Thatt: but noman satisfied mine
Understanding. For I had seen greater and more-gloryous things / then those
whereof was told me and whereunto I was poynted. Therefore likewise I found
nowhere any Refreshing nor Comfort: For I found not Thatt which I had seen
before, and loved with my Heart.

13. Behold, after thissame lovely and true Being of God / have I sought in
mine Extremitee / to thend to be released by the same / from my Bands and
wicked Enemies, and to be subject to the same Being / if I might obtain that
Grace. I have also asked after it / of Me^, to see if happly I could find it
among Any-people: and have dilligently sought the Ways that lead thereunto /
To thend that I (for to inherit euenso the Life of Peace) might have com
again into the right Path, and that mine Enemies might be rooted-out^ and
thatt recompensed them / which they had Psalm. 2^. a. 62. b. Ier. 17. b. Lamen.

deserved on me.

14. THou Beloved: Understand now heerout / which it is that I have accounted
for Dirt, and what has bin my Seeking and Supplication and Prayer unto the
Lord: and do say out of all my Soul:

15. O Lord, breake-asunder the Bands of the Ungodly I beseech thee: and
vouchsafe to give Strength unto thine inclyned Servants / to reign with thee
over all their Enemies.

16. O God, let thy Servants go over them, and tread upon them with Esa. 41.

the Judgment / for to be condemned and rooted-out.

2. Thissame seems that it has bin a Wonder unto thee / because (as thou
wrytest) such a Light and Knowledge was risen-vp unto Me before. And fardermore:
When thou then rememberest the Songs that I have made, thou say unto Me /
demanding: Had the Spirit quyt forsaken thee / in thy Forsaken-estate? Oh,
what shall I say! I must keepe-s^ilence heerof, inasmuch as I have never
found myself in such great Forsakennes.

3. O Thou Beloved / If thou had considered well on the Psalm. 22. a. Math.
27. c.
Forsakennes of Christ, and on the Forsakennes of all his Saints / who do
follow-after Him in the Forsakennes of his Cross / Then would thou not have
wondered. For euenso says the holy Scripture unto us likewise / Act. 14.
that we must enter into the Kingdom of God / through much Tribulation and
Affliction.

4. For such-a-matter (if we suffer-out the same with Patience) is the Death
Romans 6 c. Phil. 2. a.
of the Cross of Christ, whereby we be planted into Christ (as the Scripture
says) with the like Death. Wher-through we do also inherit with Christ
[namely, in the second Birth from the Death] the godly Riches of God the
Father / in the everlasting Life, and be worthy to reign upon the Earth /
Apo. 5. b.
with Christ and all his Saints.



6. But like as thy Longing has bin toward Me / so have I in-like-maner /
longed after thee / for to talk with thee of this Matter: but it is not so
com-to-pas. Notwithstanding / I hope the Lord shall once bring us together /
so will I then vtter-foorth my Heart alittle with thee / of all that is chanced
unto me. For I find very-feawe of those / with whom I dare be bold or
openhearted.

7. But thou know from the beginning / the Course of my Zeal to the
Righteousness: euen-as I do thine also: and I have never kept my Mind secret
from thee. nor-yet thou thine / from Me. Seeing then y^ thou have always bin
openhearted with me / therefore am I likewise / the-bolder to talk with thee
of althings.

8. Howbeit / if the Mind of certain Understandings or of sum Sentences had
remained hidden from many Ignorantones / it had bin good for them / because
that the Ignorantones do seek nothing-els but their Selfnes. But doutles,
whatsoever does not in al-poynts / giue-ouer itself obediently under the
gracious Word and his Service of Love / thatsame does always turn itself out
either to the one side or to the other / for to follow-after the Romans ^. c.
Lusts of his Error.

9. For-that-cause, seeing it is now known 1. Cor. 14. c.

10. Whosoever then do submitt them under the Obedience of the Loue^ cleave
unto the Love in her Service / with all their Hearts^ and reversed;with naked
Hearts; wholly giue-ouer themselves reversed;in the Comunialtee of Saints; to
the House of Love / to all Concord, and to the 1. Pet. 1. b. c.

disclose the Math. 13. b.
Secretnes of the holy Understandings and of the Kingdom of the God of Heavens
/ To thend that Gods secret Riches, and the Understandings of his holy Wisdom
/ may be known to the Obeyers of his Word / in the Nature or Being of his
Love. For verily, the Disobeyers of the Word, as also the self-seeking
Ignorantones, and those that think themselves to be wise or skillful / They
John. ^. ^.
judge the secret Mind of the Love and of the Kingdom of God / cleane-contrary
in euery-behalf.

11. And if-so-be then that they stand not to the Pro. 1.2.3.4. Eccli. 4.8. b
Counsel of the Wisdom / so do they then reversed;with Misunderstanding; take
every thing quyt contrary / according to their own good-thinking Mind of the
earthly Wisdom: and do therein corrupt themselves, and likewise all their
Understanding / through their Self-seeking and fleshly Lusts and Desires.

12. Therefore let the Wisdom be esteemed more-precious / then anything that may
be imagined in the World: For there is nothing in the World / to be compared

therefore be thou in-any-wyse far from the Mockers / which walk according to
their Romans 1. c

all those which do seek only the earthly Things. Heer-vppon let us always
think / in thissame evil and perrilous Time.

2. I have not doutles written unto thee / that God has dealt rygorously with
me. but that his Enemies (as is also before rehearsed) have dealt rygorously
with me / with Crueltee and Accusation, even as they have likewise showed in
Psalm. 42.44. b. 69 b ^ 102 b. 109. e. Math 26.27. Act 22 23.

3. These would gladly have satisfied their Lust on me / to my Destruction: Of
whom I had written unto thee / that I hoped to see my Desire on mine Enemies
and Accusers. namely, that they / all those that accused me, and would gladly
have seen my Destruction; should be judged into the Condemnation themselves.

4. Look into the matter rightly: For euenso Jerusalem, 4. Reg. 2^. 2. Par.

and the Temple of the Lord were layd-waste / and they lead-away captive, and
very-sore punished / under the Power of Babel.

and that their Hearts were cleansed / both from the Sin and the sinful
Desires / they were brought again out of the strainge Nations / to their own
Land and Heritage, and to the holy City Jerusalem / the which reversed;and
also the Temple of the Lord; was builded 1 Esd. 3. Ezech. 40. Agg. 1.2. Zach.

euen-thear unto their God / that are delytfull unto Him: the which they could
not do among the strainge People, nor in forrayne Lands: neither could they

Christ; taken on him the Phil. 2. a. Heb. 2. b.
manly Nature, and geeuen us a Promise therein: but thatsame is don with
Difference.

4. Therefore look into the Scripture / according to the Mind of the Wisdom.
and not according to the Understanding of the earthly and fleshly Minds.

5. For God takes not on him / the Seed of Heb. 2. b.
the Seed of Abraham, which bears in him / the Covenant of Gods
Circumcision: and in thatt Seed Genesis 12.21 b 22. b. 26. a Act. 3. c. Gal. 3.

is the Promise of Salvation, or the Blessing of all Generations of the Earth /
geeuen.

6. And euenthus has the Seed of Abraham the Promise / to possess the Genesis
12.17. Psalm. 105. b.
Land of Canaan [namely, the Kurnell or the Heart of the Heathen] as an
Heritage / for ever. For inasmuch as Abraham believed / therefore is he likewise
chosen of God / Genesis 17. a. Romans 4. b.
to be a Father of Faith: and called out of the Heathen or Uncircumcision /
into the Covenant of Gods Circumcision: and euenthus in his Faith and in his
Seed / is the Promise made, to the Blessing of all Generations of the Earth.

7. Which Promise standeth-firme for ever / in the Word of Life, and in the
Fathers of the Covenant: Wherout also all Gods Prophets have had their clear
Sight and Testymony of the Truth, and Esa. 40.60.62. Ier. 13. a. 30. a. 31.33.
so have prophesied Luke 1.8. 1. Pet 1. b.
on the Establishing of the Promyses.

8. Behold, this Promise (even as God had Act. 30.
and by the Mouth of all his holy Prophets) is sealed, confirmed, or
established on the Stock of Judah Math. 1. Luk..1.2. b.
the Son of Jacob / wherout David is borne. From whom / Genesis 49. b.
the Rodd is not taken, nor a Master from his Feet / till that the Just com:
For to Him shall the People inclyne, and obtain their Salvation in Him,

9. This Iustone (consider well of the Understanding) is the Sap. 7. c. ^. Cor.

of God and Man, and the true Savior Luke 2. b. Phil. 3. c. 1. Tim. 4. c.

and the Affirmation of his Prophets; that the Man should carry 1. Cor. 15. c
or bear / to his own Blessing, and to the Honor of God, and to the Praise
of his holy Name. And not the Sin / Sap. 2. c. John. 3. ^.
that very-like Being of the Devil.

12. With which ungodly or like Being of the Devil, and also with
Offenciuenes and wicked Imaginations / many Men do runne-on: and so do suppose
reversed;through their corrupt Understanding and ungodly Being; to be saved
for-al-that* they do likewise comfort Ier 8 ^
themselves with Lies, and say / Christ has performed it all: and so they
continue going-on in Ier. 4. ^ ^. a.
their Sins and Abominations or wicked Imaginations.

13. AH beloved, Consider I pray thee / of such a great Misunderstanding / that
is flatt against all the Preaching of the holy Gospel of Christ. For the
Scripture of the holy Gospel mentions and witnesses clearly unto us / that
Christ is obediently gon-before Phil. 2. a. 1. Pet. 2.4. ^.
us / in the Death of the Cross / to thend that we likewise should
follow-after Christ therein / to ye Mortifying, Col. 2.
or to a Consumeing of our Sins and of all ungodly Being [the which is the
true Burnt-offering]: as also should be incorporated unto Him / with his like
Rom 6. a. Phil. 3. b.
Death, and euenso to the Establishing of the glorious Name of God
reversed;according to his Promyses; should become saved. Thereon likewise do all
Gods Prophets witness.

Romans 3.4. Gal. 3.4. Heb 7.8.9.10.
and Services of the Law / to the Faith of Jesus Christ and the Service thereof,
and to the Requyring of the Preaching of the holy Gospel. And so forth from
the Service of the Faith of Christ and of the holy Gospel / till unto the
Johan. 13. d. 14. c. 15. b
Love and her Service: And the same is the Perfection, Romans 13. b. 1. Cor. 13.
a. Gal. 5. b. Col. 3. b. 1. Timo. 1. a
and the Establishing or Fulfilling of the Promyses of God and Christ.

15. Therefore is the Service of Love / the Very-last and Most-holy / wherein
Math. 22. d.
it is all fulfilled / whatsoever is written of the Righteousness of the Law,
and of Christ and his Believers. For in the Love and in her Children / God Apo.
21.
is all in all, and the Kingdom of the God of Heavens with his Glory.

16. Behold, This true Being of God the Father (like as is said thereof) is
the Stone that is laid in Sion / Esa. 28. b Act. 4. b. 1. Pet. 2. a.
for to trust upon it: whereof there is also written: Esa. 59 c. Romans 11. ^.
He shall com out of Sion / which shall put-awaye the ungodly Being from Jacob.

17. And thatt is the second Testament reversed;the which is the gracious
Word; Ier. 31. d. Romans 11. e. Heb. 8.10. b
that is promised to the House of Israel and to the House of Judah / in the last
time: For then shall the Punishment for their Sins / be ended: and their
Sins shall God no more remember. For in thatt Day reversed; John. 12. d.
wherein the Son of Man is exalted; shall ye Son of Man draw it all unto
Him, seeing that the Inheritance doutles appertains unto Him.

18. In this-self-same reversed;which is the very-likie and true Being of God
the Father; stands the Blotting-out Act. 4. b 10 c Heb. 1. a
and Cleansing of our Sins / through Faith, even as is written of Him.

19. To be incorporated unto Him with the Heb. 5. ^.
Heir of all godly Goods.

20. Of Him has likewise Esaias witnessed / whear he says: Esa 9. c.
A Child or an Heir is borne unto us: a Son is geeuen unto us: whose
Dominion is upon his Shoulders / and He is called / Wonderful, Counsel,
Power, Giant, everlasting Father, a peaceable Prince, for that his Dominion may
be great, and no ^nde of the Peace / upon the Seat of David and his Kingdom.

21. Him has God set to be an ^
Heir over all Things: Through Whom / He has also made ^
the World: and He makes the ^
Cleansing of our Sins / through Himself: and euenthus stands his
Satisfaction according to the Promyses, like-as is written of Him. and not
according to Man's Good-thinking or Imagination.

created or to the vain Things, nor cleave unto them to a Bondage / to thend
that the great Name of the almighty God / should always and everlastingly
bide sealed and stand-fast in the inward Man.

7. God has likewise foormed the Gen 1. c. Sap. 2 c
very-like Being of his invisible and liueing Godhead / in the inward Man /
because that the Man should live according to the Requyring of his upright
Being, to the Laud and Praise of his godly Maiestee.

8. Behold and understand: Thissame Being Christ / is the Man's Nature and
Kind / according to the inward Man / whereunto he is created by God^ and chosen
through Jesus Christ, as also ordained thereunto / to thend that he should
euenso have all his Joy, Delight, and Life / in the same Godhead^ and remain
incorporated to the Sap. 1. b.
Immortalitee of the everlasting Life.

9. To live in thissame godly Nature and Kind / is the upright Nature and
Kind of the Man, as is said: And thatt is the Commandment of God and the
Law of the Lord / which is geeuen or appointed Him: and it is likewise Gods
Math. 3. ^. 17. a. 2. Pet. 1. b.
Pleasure that the Man should live therein for ever.

10. This Commandment, Law, Will, Nature, and Kind / can noman reversed;of
his Natures-part; break. but he may I grant reversed;according to the Lusts
of his own Thoughts, and according to the Lusts of his Transgression of the
Ordinance of the Lord; stepp out of Genesis 3. a
it, and fall from the same, or estrainge himself ther-from: euen-as we now do
evidently or apparently find that it is so com-to-pas with the Man / and that
he perishes therein / if he repent not.

Ier. 2. b.
Fountain of his Life, and is become subject to the deadly Things: and so has
mingled himself with the corruptible Mortalitee: By which means / all
Destruction reigns over the unrepentant Man: and the unmeasurable lying
Being has corrupted his Understanding / with the Knowledge. and so has stolen
from him the upright Mind of his God: in such-sort, that he for-that-cause
knows or understands too-to-little of his godly Nature and Kind. Thissame
is the Man's Fall, and his Deepe-sinking under the Sin: and thatt is the
ungodly Nature / against Gods Love and Nature, and against the Love and Nature
of the Man.

12. In which ungodly Nature and corrupt Being / the Man cannot 1. Cor. 2. b
taste the Joy of the everlasting Life / which is godly, heavenly, and
spiritual. For in the ungodly Nature / he is generally John. 8. e
nothing but deuilish and fleshly Romans 8. a.
minded: and euenso tastes only the Earthly, and not the Heavenly / and so
reversed;out of his Good-thinking; takes on Him thatt which is one with his
Romans 1. c. Ephe. 4. b
own Sensualitee, and not thatt which is one with the Outflowing of the Truth
of God / under the Obedience of the Love.

The VIII. Chap.
But according as thou wrytest /

2. It is true: He is likewise a serviceable Instrument to his God* namely, in
thatt Nature reversed;whether it be then the godly or the ungodly; to the which
he is subject: like-as the same is sufficiently rehearsed and distincted unto
thee before.

3. Therefore have regard unto the Word:

4. But without his upright Foorme or Estate / the Man reversed;for his Sins
cause; is like unto a marred Instrument, Sap. 2. c. John. ^. c
which is subject and serviceable to the Devil or to the Enimite toward God.

David rightly looked-into / when he saw-into the Man's Fall, Psalm. 51. a
and acknowledged his Sins or Transgression: wher-through he lamented his
Sins and Corruption / in many Afflictions and Sorrows. and that he was like
unto a marred Instrument.

6. Euenso have likewise the Prophets and Men of God / lamented thissame
eueryone / Esa. 33.59. a Ier 10 a 14 c Dan. 9. a. b
when they saw-into the Fall of Men. namely, the Fall from their God.

The IX. Chap.
Christ is the Headd of us all, and so must have many Members: and that every
Member is serviceable to his Headd / in his Kind.

2. Err not heerin in-any-wyse / thou Beloved. Many do say indeed / out of a
lying and ungodly Being / Christ is our Headd: whereas doutles the deuilish
Nature that Antichrist or Child of the Devil is their Headd, and they / his
Members. but not / out of the Creation of God, but out of the false Being
John. 8. Ephe ^. a.
of the Devil: the which they have take-on willingly reversed;according to
their own Pleasure; as a Contrary-beeing unto God, and do carry or bear
the same / as a Contrary-nature to their upright Nature or Kind.

3. Verily, such are swallowed-vpp by the earthly Corruptiblenes, in whom all
Blyndnes and Unbelief Ephe. 2. ^
has is Work.

4. Therefore also / they are all minded according to the common Course of the
wicked World. and not according to the Nature of the Love / the heavenly
Truth of God.

5. NOw seems it likewise reversed;according to

6. Ah, looke-into the matter of fellowship / according to the Truth: How
should I pray thee / the innocent Blood be sheadd, and live so wholly in all
Wrong and Contrarynes / thorough the Flesh and his Wisdom? Unless that it were
estrainged from his right Headd^ subject to the Contrary-nature unto God /
whereof the Devil is the Headd^ and incorporated and serviceable to the same /
as a Fellow-member of Antichrist / the Devils Child: and that euenso the
Devil governed over him, who uses the Flesh reversed;as his serviceable
Instrument; to the Iniquitee / according to his Will.

7. So long then as any Flesh / is reversed;with his Will; inclyned to the
Iniquitee, and does not believe to be iustif^ed or released Romans 3 8. a Gal. 2.
b.
from the Sin / through Christ / So has it not Christ to be his Headd: nor
he is not in all his Nature, Being, and Kind / natured nor minded Romans ^. a
according to Gods Being and Nature: unless it were so that the Man had
reversed;with Good willingness; turned him to God and his Righteousness, and did
upright Math. 3. a. Luke 3.13. a
Fruits of Repentance / in the Obedience of the Requyring of the Service of
Love, and that Christ did in that manner / get Call. 4. c.
his Foorme in Him / whereby to use the Creature reversed;as his Instrument; to
all good and profitable Works / according to his upright Nature.

1. Cor. 25. f.
the Kingdom of God (as thou wrytest) thatt is right nodout: Flesh and Blood
has no Inheritance nor Dominion or Lordshipp in the Kingdom of God. For Flesh
and Blood that earthly Being is in his right Ordinance / the Esa. 66. a Act 7.
c.
Bench for the Lords Feet: over the which / the Kingdom of God bears his
Dominion, and Christ / his Glory.

9. Of which Glory / the Members of Christ have spoken in tymes-past (when as
the Life of God or Christ was com unto them / for to possess them, and to be
incorporated with them) saying and testifying: John. 1. b
The Word is incarnated or become Flesh, and dwelt among us. Wherthrough they
saw his Glory, even a Glory of the only borne Son of the Father / full of
Grace and Truth.

10. Behold: This Glory of Christ / was the Kingdom Luke 17. c.
of God inwardly in them: the which had inherited them for a Possession / as
his Heritage: and their Spirit also / thatsame. and not / Flesh and Blood.

11. Consider well of the Mind that I write unto thee: and understand the
Resolution of my Understanding: and John. 7. ^.
judge with a right Judgment.

The X. Chap.
THou say likewise / out of the Ecclesiastes, Eccle. 12. a
how that every Thing must return again / from whence it is com. Thatt which
is out of God / shall return thither again: and thatt which is of the Earth /
shall be Earth again.

2. Oh reversed;alas; heer-out is much Misunderstanding taken-on: and many do
runne-on in that sort / with this one Sentence, and have no Discerning nor
Consideration / to what end the Sentence sounds, nor whereto the whole
Scripture stretches. And will nodout reversed;out of there own Good-thinking;
include the Mind of God reversed;which they understand not; in this one
Sentence of the Scripture. And out of the same they judge euenthus: Let them live
how they will live, when they dye / their Spirit shall com again to God, and
th^^r Body to the Earth.

3. Heerwithall do the lightmynded Hearts deceive themselves, who have no Lust
to Gods Righteousness: and yet for-al-that do rest persuaded / that their Spirit
reversed;which is vngodded or not of God; shall com to God.

4. No reversed;Beloved; No. God will none of the wicked Spirits: but He puts
them away, and poynteth them from Him / Math. 25. ^
into the Condemnation of the hellish Fire, which is prepared for the Devil
and all wicked Spirits.



6. For if it were so / that the Spirit of God reversed;which God has formed
in the Man; should always upon the Earth / remain estrainged or separated
from God, and from the Man's Being: and that the Man should not reversed;upon
the Earth; be incorporated to the same / for an everlasting Assurance Romans 8. b
of the Inheritance of Christ and of the Kingdom of the God of Heavens / in the
eternal Life: and so reversed;without Uniting Eqhe. 4. c.
with the Man's Being / in Righteousness; should go to the Incorporating unto
his God first / when as the Creature were passed-thorow the natural Death /
Who could then I pray thee / witness and publish upon the Earth / the Glory of
God and the Powers of his Goodness / to the Blessing and S^luation of the Man^
and be serviceable to the Man / to an Incorporating to the same Goodness of God?

7. Therefore have now in consideration / how, and wherein the Fulness of the
Mind of the Scriptures concisteth: and whether that the Understanding of God
be wholly declared in the Man / when as he so takes unto him one Sentence out
of the Scripture / according to his Good-thinking, and so goeth-on therewith /
without Discerning of the godly Wisdom: and does not once consider / whereto
that one Sentence serves, from whence it proceeds, nor to what end it
stretches.

8. Euenthus reversed;thou Beloved; let us consider Sap. 1. ^.
that the Wisdom dwells not in a Body that is subject unto Sin? Therefore
cannot likewise an vngodded Man^ nor-yet one that remains without the
Comunialtee of the Family of Love / judge one Sentence of the holy Scripture /
rightly according to the Truth, nor-yet out of the Wisdom.

9. But whereas Ecclesiastes speaks Eccle. 12. a.
of the Earth and of God: as that each-one that is Earthly and of God / goes
to his own Incorporating / Thereof I will ask thee somewhat:

10. When now this Alteration cometh-to-pas with the Man, shall then the Nature
of the Iniquite have his Possession with the Man, or be mingled with him as an
Heir? Or shall he be thrust-out with the Vnfreeone? Genesis 21. b Gal. 4. ^.
I do verily suppose / Yea, according to the Promyses. For behold:

11. Will not God inhabit his Tabernacle 2. Cor. 6. b
or Temple alone: and dryue-out of it / all Esa. 35.52. a. Apoc. 21. c.
that is unclean, or that defyleth the House of the Lord? Is not the Heaven
also / his Seat. and Esa 66 ^ Act. 7. c.
the Earth / the Bench for his Feet?

Christ / Because that he should serve and liue-vnto his God only / in all
Luke 1.8.
Righteousness and not cleaue-vnto the wicked Spirit* nor-yet judge the same for
the Spirit of God: through the which / he keeps God, as also his good Spirit
/ out of his Dwelling.

13. And whosoever then / through his Good-thinking, and through his wicked
Spirit or ungodly Being / keeps the God of Life out of his Dwelling, and
with a false Opinion^ or with an Enuyousnes toward any Man / does comfort or
quiet himself therein / He does willingly giue-ouer himself to the Curssing and
perpetual Condemnation.

14. For what other Dwelling for God / will anyman imagine I pray thee: or what
other Tabernacle or Temple of God / will anyman make 2. Pa^. 6. d Esa. 66. a
Act. 7. e.
reversed;wherein God will dwell; but the Man / Job. 14. b. Psalm. 138. a.
that Work of his Hand? For thatt is the Lords Lust, Pro. 8. d. John. 14. d.
for to dwell therein / with his upright Being or Christ. But most-tymes (when
the Lord moves the Man ther-to / by his Ministers) the Man remains
captiued unto his own Knowledge, and so denies to yield himself Ier. 7. c 16
b 27.29. b and^ Act 7. c. 17 c
to the same Grace of the Lord: so that most-tymes / ther-are Feawe that suffer
themselves to be prepared for an Habitation of God, the which is greatly to be
lamented.

15. Therefore I say unto thee verily (like Act. 7.17. ^.
that are made with Men's Hands. but in the Work of his own Hand. For look
into the matter:

16. Wherein has God reversed;I pray thee; ever had a Pleasure to dwell
reversed;for to be as well upon Earth as in Heaven; Leuit 26 Pro. 8. d. 2. Cor.
6 b Apo. 21. a
but in the Man, whom He himself has made? And to what Temple or Tabernacle
has He had a Lust to have it cleansed from the Idoles^ and from all ungodly
Being, but to the Man / whereby to be God and the Lord alone / in him.

17. Consider: Are not these the Esa. 4^. a 6^ 61. b 62. a 2. Pet 3. b. Apo.
21..^.
Promyses / that God will inhabit the Earth reversed;or the Man of the Earth;
in Righteousness?

18. Yea, even in the Man / will He reversed;through his gracious Word and
Service of Love; distinct and deuid-a sunder / the Earthly / from the Heavenly
/ To thend that euenso in the Man's Inwardnes / Thatt which is of God / may com
to Eccle. 12. ^
God / in the heavenly Being. and the Earthly / to his earthly Being: And He
himself the God of Heaven Esa. 60. ^. c Apo. 2^. ^.
will in this sort have his Dwelling (...) in the Man's Inwardnes / with his
godly Being, and shine in him everlastingly with his Cleernes / as a Daylight
from Heaven, and euenso lighten the Earth with Righteousness. And thatt is the
New Heaven Esa. 65.66 b 2 Pet. 3. b. Apo. 21. a
and the New Earth / in which the Righteousness dwells: and they are now
coming to all Believers of Christ / which do submitt them obediently under the
Love and her Service / to the Cleansing from their Sins, according to the
Promyses.

The XI. Chap.


2. I know not well what I shall say heervpon: but my Conceaueing is / that
thou understand not rightly the Fear of God, nor-yet his Rygorousnes, nor
his Kyndnes.

3. For / to fear God / Psalm. 111. b. Pro. 1. a. 9. b Eccli. 1. b
is a costly Treasure / because that therout springs the holy Wisdom. For the
Fear of God Pro. 16. a Eccli. 7. c
dryueth-out the Sin.

4. She is a Work full of all Virtue / a Foresightfulnes / to a good
Protection from the Destruction: and begets in the Man / a good
Understanding / to a Guyding-in of him to the upright Life.

5. But to know and to love God in his godly Sap. 15. a
thatt is perfect Righteousness: and this Perfection in the Love / 1 John. 4. b
dryueth-out Fear: wherthrough the Man does euenso then / fulfill the
Requyring of the Law of Moses and of the Faith of Jesus Christ, and loves God
with all his Heart, and all Men as himself.

6. Therefore ther-is likewise no Fear of God anymore needful to such a Man /
which has inherited the Perfection in the Love. For God dwells in him: and
the same Gods Spirit John. 16. b.
leads him into all Truth: and declares all things unto him.

7. The Man now being a Dwelling for God / in all his Inwardnes 1. Cor. 3.6 b 2
Cor. 6. b.
reversed;in whom / God with his Christ and Spirit / lives and works; he
has no cause to be afraid of God nor of his Rygorousnes: For Col. 3 b
the Love is the Band of their Unity. namely, the Godhead with the Manhod.
Therefore also the Man needs not to fear: For all his Nature, Being, and
Disposition / is like unto God himself / who suffers his Math. 5. d.
Sun of Righteousness to shine over Good and Badd.

8. And if now it be so with thee likewise, then have thou won the Crown 4.
Esd 2. c. Iam 1. a. Apo. 2. b.
of Life: and all Ignorance is swallowed-vp in thee.

9. But now it appears by thy Words reversed;according to the sound of thy
writing; that thou art not yet com heerunto. For thou desyrest yet Releasment
from thy former Ignorance: and wishest that it had his Going-vnder in thee: or
that it were quyt out of thee, that thou moughtest then rejoice thee aright.

Psa 27 47. a 96. a b 97. a 99. a.

Enemies might euenso reversed;thorough the Power of his God; go-vnder, or
com-to-nothing: and that Math. 25. d.

The XII. Chap.
Esau, seeing he is still to-mighty for thee.

2. I know not whether I do well understand thy Mind in this Matter / or no
/ because that thou have heer-to-fore written so franckly unto me / of thy
Deliverance and Freedom. And yet now thou wrytest of the Power of Esau / over
thee: and that thou must yet suffer him / seeing he is to-mighty for thee.

3. Ah reversed;Beloved; look rightly into the matter I pray thee / whether
the Procreation of Esau and Jacob / be also com-to-pas with thee / according to
the Truth. For I say unto thee verily: With whomsoever Esau and Jacob are
brought-foorth out of Isaac / the S^ede of Promise / thear cannot Esau do
anything against Jacob: For Jacob is much-to-prudent for him.

4. Howbeit, whear Esau and Jacob are not brought-foorth / thear are they not
present likewise: and the Man also is utterly unacquainted with the
Understanding thereof. For-that-cause there is likewise no Power used with him /
neither by Esau nor-yet by Jacob: but they are all vain Things / whatsoever he
persuades himself to know or to feel thereof.

5. For both these [namely, Esau and Iacob] Genesis 25. ^.
and of one Moother: and are also conceived both at-once in their Moothers
Womb. But the Birth reversed;wherein they make-manifest themselves, and
separate themselves asunder; cometh-to-pas / the One before the Other: of the
which now Esau has the Foregoing, and after-that / Jacob / who is made Genesis
27. ^.
a Lord over Esau, and an Heir in the Promyses of his Fathers. Therefore
consider now of the Understanding touching Esau and Jacob:

6. Must not Esau ^eare the Yoke of Jacob* and not Jacob / the Yoke of Esau?

7. Has not Esau also the Promise reversed;to com-to-pas at his time; Genesis 27.
c.
that he shall lay-off the Yoke of his Brother, and shake it from his Nerk?
Esau has not deceived or begyled Jacob. but Jacob / Esau. Genesis 25^ d. 27. d.
And so are the Promyses of God established on Jacob / who is likewise named
Genesis 32. ^.
Israel: and he became a Lord over Esau, who was also named Edom.

8. Therefore is Esau likewise / figured-foorth or figuratively resembled unto
us / 4. Esd. 6. b.
for the first or foregoing World / in like-maner Romans 5. b.
Adam also. and Jacob / for thatt which is to-com / and so likewise / Christ.

9. Because now this Secreat is great / therefore hear a clear Similitude,
wherewith the Birth of Esau and Jacob is vttered-foorth.

Genesis 1.
Heaven and Earth at-once: but when the Heaven and the Earth were separated
a-sunder / then went the Heaven / above the Earth. And then did God set a
great Light and Cleernes / in the Heaven: and it was also hanged with Clouds,
Deawe, and Rain / wherthrough He reversed;to the Welfare of the Earth;
garnished the Earth, and made it fruitful / to bring-foorth all good Fruits.

11. Thatsame now which has the Foregoing with the Man / out of the Begetting
of the Seed of Promise, and is first seen / thatt is a natural Body: but
thatt which is to Com, or thatt which is last seen / is a spiritual Body:
Yet out of one Conception or Begetting.

12. For if we have out of God / 1. Cor. 15. ^.
a natural Body / then have we likewise out of Him / a spiritual Body: But
the Natural / which has the Foregoing to thatt which the Seed of Promise
requires / is the Image of ye Spiritual, or of the second Generation
according to the Spirit, which accomplisheth the Requyring of the Seed of
Promise.

13. If we now / have euenso likewise / borne the Image of the earthly or
natural Man / 1. Cor. 15. ^.
then shall we also verily / bear the right Image of the heavenly or
spiritual Man.

14. Gather-out the Mind, and comprehend Understanding: The foregoing
Kingdom / is the Image of the Beawty and Louelynes of Thatt which is to com.

15. Thatt which goes before / has procured to itself / the Death or the
Mortalitee: it

16. In which true Being / the Death with her Destruction / passeth-away:
wherein then likewise / her Death or Mortalitee / is losened or rent, and her
Destruction / swallowed-vpp / euen-as the Prophet Ozeas has forespoken
the same: Oze. 13. b.
O Death, I was thy Death: O Hell, I was thy Sting. Whereof also Paul has
said: When 1. Romans 15 f
the Corruptible / shall put-on the Incorruptible, and the Mortal / the
Immortalitee / Then is the fore-mencioned Word fulfilled: as that the Death is
swallowed-vpp in Victory. O Death / whear is now thy Sting, or thy deadly
Work? O Hell / whear is now thy Victory? For the Esa. 25 a.
Death is swallowed-vpp by the Life: wher-through / the Hell loses her Victory.

Esau: but swallowed-vpp by Jacob. by Adam is the Death com into the World:
Romans 5. b 1. Cor. 15. b
but by Christ / the Life, to the Conquering of the Death.

18. In the first Creation or Generation / the Earth was waste and empty, and
it was dark upon the Deep. Genesis 1.
and after ye God said: Let it be Light, and it was Light. And God behealde the
Light for Good: And by the same Light / the Garnishing and the Beawty of the
Kingdom was seen, to a glorious Name of the almighty God, who has prepared
him all the same.

The XIII. Chap.
Israel sought-for! Notwithstanding, of the Meaning thereof (as thou wrytest)
thou know not whether thou have a right Discerning / or no. And therefore
thou desyrest of me that I would write somewhat unto thee of that Matter /
according to my Discerning.

2. O Thou Beloved, the Secret of this Matter is very great / according to my
Discerning. Nevertheless / I will reversed;according to thy Request; disclose a
little unto thee of my Sight touching the Meaning thereof: For I cannot hyde it
from thee. Have thou a regard on the Meaning:

3. The House of Israel / is the Stock of Jacob: which Jacob / is the Second
Kingdom of the former Beawty, which surmounteth all Power and Glory. Behold
and consider of thatt which is rehearsed before of Supra. 1^.
Adam and Christ, of the Earthly and Heavenly, and of Esau and Jacob. So mark
then:

4. When now Esau and Jacob were borne, Jacob* ouercom Esau reversed;his
Brother; with Prudence and with Deceit: Genesis 27. c. d
and so with Prudence / he got the Kingdom of Promise, and became an Elder and
a Father in the Covenant of the God of his Fathers / Isaac and Abraham.

5. Heerin he also deceived Isaac his Father / through the Counsel of Rebecca
his Moother: Genesis 27 a. b
and so is become an Heir in the Promyses of his Fathers. Therefore he is
rightly called Jacob: Genesis 27. d.
which Name signifies unto us / A Deceauer, or a Suppresser.

6. Now when Jacob was become a Lord over his Brother Esau: and had received
the Blessing of the Promyses of his Fathers / Then did he not only love the
Inheritance of the Promyses: but much-more the God of his Fathers. And God Mal.
1. a. Romans 9. b
had likewise a Pleasure in Jacob. Which God of his Fathers / appeered also
unto him, and has sealed or established the Promyses upon Jacob: so Genesis 28.
b. c
that Jacob saw nothing-els upon the Place / but the House of God.

7. After-that / Jacob wrestled Genesis 32. c.
with God: and leaft Him not (although the Day came-on) before He had blessed
him: and so he overcame God likewise / to his Will.

Jacob was com to such Power and Lordshipp with God / God asked him his Name.
He answered God, and said / that he was called Jacob. But God gave him the
Name / that he should be called Israel / Gen 32. c.
Because that he had strouen with God and Man, and kept the Victory. And Israel
signifies unto us / A Gods Lorder, or One that lordeth with God, or preuayleth.

9. According to this-very Name, has God also named his own Name. For like as
God named himself after the Name of Abraham and Isaac / his Fathers, euenso did
He likewise name himself a God of Israel: that is / a God of those that lord
or prevail with God / under whom Esau stands seruiceably submitted, and yet
is no Heir in the Testaments of God.

10. Behold, Thissame / which is the second Birth or Procreation after Esau,
and which reversed;in his Ouercoming; is by God / named Israel, is verily the
true and right House of Israel. And all that be borne ther-out / are the Lambs
and Sheep of the House of Israel.

11. Verily, the same Sheep that is lost or strayed from this House
(understand the Meaning rightly) is the Sheep Math. 10. ^. 18. b. Luke 15. a.
that is sought with earnest Love / to thend that the Promyses that are made to
the Fathers / should be established on the same. For God will also be a God and
Sheapheard of ye lost strayed Sheep of the House of Israel: and bringing
the same again to his Esa. 56. a Eze. 37. c. John. 10. b
Fold / He will likewise be a God and a Sheapheard unto his Seed / even for
evermore.

12. And if thou now have rightly understood Judah, and the Remnant of the
People of Jacob. and how that thosesame, together with the Generations of Men
(inasmuch as they are estrainged from their right Stock: namely, from the
Fellow-lording with God) are the right lost or erring Sheep of the House o^
Israel. Then again, looke-vpon the Testament Esa. 4^.41. etc. Ier 30.31.32 33.
Eze. 34.35.36.37.
of Promise / that is promised to the House of Israel and to the House of Judah:
and how God has sworn unto them / that He is their Heritage: also Deuteronomy. 4. c
32. a Psalm. 28.47 a
how that they all / are Gods Heritage.

13. Behold reversed;thou Beloved; Thesesame / Israel and Judah that are here
rehearsed unto thee / are the right Heirs and Act. 3. c.
Children of the Testament in the Promyses of their Fathers, wherein God will
establish them / in the last Time.

14. To which Heritage reversed;according to the Promyses; the Heathen are
reversed;by Gods Grace; ^sa. 42. a 49. ^. (...). 1 d. John. 8 b. Act 13. c
called and bidden / To thend that they reversed;as Fellow-heyres of the House
of Israel; should live and reign with Israel, and Isreal's God / in the true
Circumcision / which God has fe^t or ordained betwixt Him and Abraham and his
Seed / Genesis 17. a
for an everlasting Covenant, and that-ther should be no more but one God.
namely, among the Jews and Heathen.

Israel: but that are called thereto by Gods Grace / because that the Heathen
should euenso reversed;by Gods Grace / out of the Belief in Jesus Christ; be
likewise the Seed of Abraham / in Righteousness and Holiness Luke 1. ^^phe. 4. c.
that pleases God, and should possess the Citizenshipp in Jerusalem /
according to the Promyses.

16. Lo, heer-vnto is the Man reversed;which is so wholly lost or estrainged
from this Dominion with God or House of Israel; sought and called with earnest
Love / for that he should com to the Heritage of God and Christ, which is the
Health and Salvation of his Soul, as also live with God, and that the God of
Israel / should likewise be his God.

17. Consider now / thou Beloved: Heer-vppon (as I have rehearsed unto thee)
stands my Sight / touching the lost Sheep of the House of Isarel / that is
sought with great Diligence / by the Lord and his Ministers / for to bring
him Math. 10. a. 1^ b. Lu^. 15 a. John. 10 b.

The XV. Chap.
ACcording to thy Request reversed;thou Beloved;

2. I know not also any Light John. 1. ^.
of Life / but the 2. Cor. 4. ^. Col. 1. b. Heb. 1. ^.
invisible true Being / the glorious and lovely Life of the liueing Godhead:
wher-vppon likewise my Hope stands, euen-as we have also talked thereof in
tymes-past.

3. I seek not likewise neither have sought (since that time forth / that we
spoke last together) any Salvation of the Soul / in any Outward-thing: but
reversed;through the Belief in Jesus Christ, and through the Love and her
Service; I withdraw my Mind from all what is outward, and which is drawing me
to Corruption.

4. Heer-vnto does my Soul bend itself / so much as I may in the Lord: and I
do love the invisible Being of God / to thend that my inward Mind should in
nowyse stand bound to the vain Creatednes: but that my Spirit might euenso /
live in the Spirit of the true and liueing Being. namely / according to the
Nature of Christ, John. 13. d. 15. b 1. John. 3. c.
who directs or poynteth us unto the Love the vnchaingable Godhead.

5. But thatt Service which has his Mini^tration to the same Love / for the
Saluations sake of Men, and requires all Orderlynes and Reasonablenes / will I
not despise, nor-yet in any-case forsake: but will reversed;so much as the Lord
enableth me thereto; further, maintain, and minister the same to the Salvation
of Men / inasmuch as the Lord has chosen Me thereunto.

Gen 1.2. Sap. 1. b. 2. c
is the Man created, like as is witnessed and administered out of the Service of
Love: and therefore is also my Soul inclyned to the same Service / to thend that
Ephe. 4. ^.
the Unite of Heart might be in ye Love / among all Lovers of the Truth.

7. Behold, yet at this present / thus stands my Mind: and I likewise know
not yet any better, neither have I also met with any better.

8. But it seems now reversed;by thy Writing; as though thou have heard by
Sum / that I should be outwardly minded (as are Sum whom thou namest unto
me) O No / thou Beloved: My Heart, Mind, and Being stands not grounded
upon any outward Thing / neither do I also desire to cleaue-vnto and to use
anything that is Outward / which leadeth-away Romans 1. ^. Heb. 3. b.
from the liueing God and his Righteousness.

9. But though I now reversed;for the Vnitees sake in the Love; should
conuersate myself with Sum that were yet outwardly minded, or did yet set
their Confidence upon any Flesh / yet does not their weak Ground concern
me. But I have for-that-cause / a lyke-loue toward them / when they cannot
attain unto the invisible Truth any farther, and desire to have Conversation
peaceably with Me / and yet for-al-that I do not contemn the Outward.

10. I would also willingly leave them free Opinion soever they be: if the
Love Col 3. b.
were our Band and Concord^ and that we conuersated ourselves with each-other
therein: as also would willingly hear one-another / through Love: and
that-ther were in-that-sort a good Inclynation to the Truth / among us all /
Then should the right Understanding com-to-light nodout, and the vain
Understanding, together with all evil Imaginations and Blaspheamings,
vanish-away of themselves or consume to nothing.

11. For, to deal in the Love / with such as are adjoined to the Love / were
more acceptable unto me, also much-more delytfull and joyful / then with
those that have no Lust* Will, nor Desire to the good Being of the Love, and
will in-that-maner conuersate themselves with me.

12. For though anyone of the goodwilling Hearts / should reversed;by reason
of his small Understanding; trust yet upon some Outward-thing yet if he have a
Lust to God and his Righteousness, and is no Blaspheamer nor Contemner toward
another / then comes thatt Vanitee to an End doutles / in the Understanding.
Therefore men ought not to contemn anyone for the outward Services or
Ordinances cause.

Things / through the Affection to the Worldly outward Things: the Eccli. 15.
b. Romans 1. c Ephe. 4. c.
which nodout is altogether strainge from God and his Truth. and therefore
likewise ther-are Many now / which dispyse the outward Services or Ordinances^
speaking much Reproach of euery-one^ also blaspheaming and with Falshod
defameing the Ministers thereof: but in that they bind their Hearts unto their
own Creatures, or unto some other outward Things / thatt will they not once
consider.

14. And the same Estrainging from God and his Truth reversed;through the
Affection to the worldly and outward Things; do we now reversed;alas; find
among many Men / who do also very franckly bost themselves / that they are not
snared by any Man, nor with outward Services or Ceremonies: and so do persuade
themselves / that therefore they are not outwardly minded Gal. 4. a. Col 2. c.
like those that seek Righteousness in outward Things.

15. Yeas assuredly: and yet much-more and worse: For they suffer themselves to
be captiued Rom 1. c. Ephe. 2. a 4. c.
with the earthly Things of this World: and reversed;their Hearts growing
vain therthrough, and turning-away themselves from the Lust to the Guyding
into the Righteousness; they hang their Understanding and Mind on thosesame,
and on their own Good-thinking: so that they for-that-cause / do utterly lose
all Lust or Zeal to the upright Being of God, and become cleaueing to the
earthly corruptible Things; and euenso do quyt corrupt their Understanding.



17. For my Heart has much-more Affection to those that with Ignorance / do
seek God and his Righteousness, and that show Obedience therein / then to those
that with Understanding / do estrainge them from God and his Service, and are
strainge and disobedient unto all Righteousness / according to the Requyring of
the holy Word of the holy Spirit and Service of Love, and so do live after
there own Mind Ier 7. c. 23. b. 18. b

neither seek nor desire any such matter / I have endeavored myself to be
conversant with certain zealous Hearts: To thend that I in my Zeal / might not
have my Course with the Vnwillingones reversed;which take-on a false Freedom /
to separate themselves from the Requyring of the Service of Love, and cleave to
the earthly corruptible Things; but with the Good-willingones to the
Righteousness: and that the Understanding of the godly Truth and of the
peaceable Love / might reversed;by that Means; beare-swaye among the Lovers
of the upright Understanding / which do love the Treasures of Wisdom, and the
Obedience to the Requyring of the Service of Love / above Gold and Silver,

2. For whosoever loves the Wisdom or Pro. 8 ^. Sap. 6 b. 7. ^ Math. 7. ^.

anything above the Wisdom / or whosoever contemns and blaspheameth anyman / in

neither shall he also find, understand, nor inherit the Wisdom. For the
Wisdom is much-to-noble, to-honorable of Lynage, Pro. 8. a. b. Sap 7 a. b.

3. Oh reversed;alas; I find too-feawe of those which love the Wisdom above
all things. But let it go how it will / with the Wysdom and the upright
Righteousness, the Man does in-any-case take good heed to the earthly Things /
which doutles are no more to be esteemed then as Phil. 3. b.
Dirt / in comparyson to the Preciousnes or Worthynes of the Wisdom and
Righteousness of God.

4. Understand now reversed;thou Beloved; wherefore I have endeavored myself to
have my Conversation in Freedom / with those whom thou well know, and also
with others more. namely, for the Wisdom and the Righteousness sake, as is
before rehearsed, and as I will yet partly rehearse unto thee / because that thy
Heart should in-nowyse doubt that I have sought or liked anything-els / but
the Virtues of the upright and true invisible Being.

5. For in all Things and Dealings that I 1 ^or. 1. a Phil. 2. a.

/ and that we should not take or construe anything of each-other / to the
worst: but I have not yet used the same Course among them, nor-yet the Speech
that tends thereunto.

6. I have not yet likewise bin in any Communialtee among them / whereby to
deal boldly with them: But the Lord do with us according to his Will, and
thatt which serves most unto Peace, and to the Unity of Heart in the Love.

7. O Thou Beloved / Although I have reversed;out of Love; submitted myself
heerunto among Sum, whereby to inform the Lovers of the Truth / to all
Unity in the Love, and so have not contemned nor blaspheamed the Outward / Yet
am I not therefore outwardly minded: but this do I verily acknowledge, that it is
much-more Pleasure unto me / to deal with the Love of the Wisdom, and to
talk thereof / among those that love the Love and the Wisdom / because that the
Righteousness appears unto Such; then to inherit all the Riches and Pleasures
of this World: or to deal among those which love the earthly Things or their
own Good-thinking / above the Wisdom, and above the Unity of Heart in the
Love / and so to dissemble with Men / as though all were inward and heavenly
Things that they love / wher-with they deceive both themselves and other more /
which hear them, and do seduce them from the true Services that lead to the
Life.

1. Cor. 4 a.
my Heart / out of his holy Heaven; is an Against-shyning unto me / against
the same. But the Ministration of the Good / by the godded Men or Olde-fathers
in the Famyly of Love / is awayes very profitable, and a good Preparation to
the Delivering of the Man from his Romans 7. c
Bands of the Sin. and that men have familyer brotherly Conversation
together to that end / is also very lovely, and likewise greatly edyfying to
the Unity of Heart in the Love.

9. Behold reversed;thou Beloved; like-as I have here written unto thee in
naked and bare manner / Euenso stands my Mind: and I hope not to forsake
the same / till I have found or gotten all what I seek-for, and desire among
the Lovers of the Truth. The Lord grant me Mercy: and doowith me /

The First Chapter.
HN do wish a good Peace and Salvation / unto the Communialtee of Saints of
the House of the Love of Jesus Christ, and unto all good-willing Hearts / that
for the Glory of Gods sake / do submit them obediently under the Love, and
maintain her Service / to Esa. 65. b 2. Pet. 3. b Apoc. 21. a.
a Renewing of the Earth with Righteousness / to thend that God may obtain the
Superioritee / with his Love and upright Being: and that all what God has
spoken in tymes-past Act 3. c.
by ye Mouth of all his holy Prophets, and published Math. 28. d. Mar. 16. b.
in ye World / by ye Christ of God / for a Gospel of the Kingdom, and as is
written thereof / may now in the last time / be fulfilled Luke 18. d.
or accomplished / through ye Love, according to the Promyses.

2. Happy are all those Esa. 25.30. b
that long after the same, and reversed;for the Glory of God and his Loves sake;
do Math. 10. d. 16.^ Mar. 8. d. Luke 9 17. d John. 12. c.
forsake, hate, and leave themselves / that God the true Lorder may only have
the Superioritee, 1. Cor. 15. c.
and so be all in all: and no Flesh to account anything 1. Cor. 1. d.
of itself anymore.

3. FOrasmuch then as 1. Cor. 25. ^. 1. Tim 1 b.
Mercy is chanced 2. Cor. 4. b.
Heart / by the Rising of the Light from on High / whereby to reveal his Glory,
and to defend his Honor and Beawty / to all utter Puting-downe of all Glory
and Honor of the lying Flesh: Therefore cannot I endure to hyde Gods Honor /
which only belongs unto Him. For to that end is the Service of the Word
under the Obedience of the Love / com-foorth Ephe. 1. b.
reversed;to the Laud and Praise of the godly Glory; for to defend the
supreme God in his Honor reversed;because that all thatt which belongs unto
Him / may be geeuen again unto Him, and be drawn under Him; and not to excuse
any Flesh of Sin therein, nor-yet reversed;for any Love of the Fleshes cause;
to cover any Flesh / in his Shame: but to discover the same naked and bare.
namely / all his Whordom, Ier 5. b 7. b 8 14. b 23 c. 1. Tim. 1. b.
Adultery, Theeuery, and Killing or Murdering, together with all his false
Witnessings, and Esa. 1. a 5. c. 52. a. Mar. 3.
Blaspheamy against God and all Gods Holyones.

4. For thus says the holy Spirit of Love, whose Day Esa. 66. b. Mal. 4 a.
burns like a Cresset-of-flameing-fyer against all his Enemies: Look upon
yourselues, and consider of your Vnchastitee, and of the Uncleanness and Eze.
24. b. Math. 15.23. ^.
Wickedness of your Hearts, and what ye all are by Nature / O all thou Flesh
that art borne of Adam. Wherwithal reversed;I pray you; or by what Kind of
Righteousness, or Understanding of Wisdom / will ye judge the upright Wisdom or
the holy Spirit of Love, and accuse his Ministers? And wherewith reversed;I pray
you; will ye excuse or defend yourselues / that ye should not all reversed;how
prudent-wyse soever ye be; com to Shame before the Iudgment-seate of the
Christ of my God? which Day of his Judgment / does now breake-thorow, and his
Coming approaches Math. 24. c.
like a Morning-starr out of the East or Rysing-of-the-sunne: and is seen like
ye Lightening / into ye West or Going-downe thereof: Whose Lighting /
maketh-manifest all Flesh of the Darkness reversed;in his Uncleanness; through
the Coming of his Beawtyful-cleernes.

The II. Chap.
Adam, wherein will thou now excuse Romans 2.
thyself before the righteous Judge, as to be unguilty in anything / wherein thou
condemnest another? Therefore behold and consider: The Judgment of God in his
Justice / is set before thee, and thy Sin or Offense / made naked and bare
before thine Eyes / how that thou art faulty and wrong in euerything: not only
in thatt which is manifestly evil or wrong: Esa. 64. c. Math. 23. a. b Romans
10. a 1. Cor. 1. b. c Col. 2. b. ^
but also in all thy Wisdom, Holiness, and Righteousness.

2. Therefore com ye all forth hither / before the clear Judgment or Day
Math. 25 d. Romans 14 b. 2. Cor. 5. b.
of the Sentence of God: make-manifest yourselues eueryone / before his
Maiestee, and let your inward Nakedness appear: But what avails it, there
shall none be Psalm. 14.53 a Rom 3. a
found clea^e / No not One righteous. but all / full of Spotts and Wrinckles.

3. Seeing then that all of you reversed;which are borne of the sinful Flesh of
Adam; are Psalm 51. a.
unclean and unrighteous, and have nothing-at-all in your Members / that is
like unto the Beawty of the Bryde of Christ / So doth-ther not then likewise
any Judgment belong unto you, neither-yet to give Sentence of the godly Things.
Or-els do ye think to sit upon the Seat of the Justice of God / with your
Injustice, and so to pronounce-foorth the Judgment? Or do ye still think / that
ye can judge right in any Matters? Verily / I utterly deny it: for all sinful
Flesh in his Vanitee / is false Psalm 116. b. Romans 3. a.
and lying. Therefore it belongs not to him / to judge anything: but to be
judged himself / by the Judgment of God / to thend that the Unrighteous / may
receive the Judgment of their Unrighteousness. Math. 13.25. d Romans 2. a 2 Tess.
1 a.
and the Righteous / the Judgment of their Righteousness / Because that it may
euenso be witnessed / that God only Psalm 116. b John. 3 d. Romans 3. a. Apo 19. a
b.
is righteous in his Judgment.

4. Thus says the holy Spirit of Love: I Adam* and likewise with you all that
will excuse or defend thatsame. For this is the righteous Judgment of my God /
over you: that ye all are Romans 2. a.
resistant against the Kyndnes of the highest God. Who will now I pray you /
justify or excuse himself against the same. For according to your own inclyned
Mind / ye have all doutles fleshed yourselues with the Devil: and so are
incorporated to all Evil and Wickedness: wherthrough ye have eueryone
reversed;how prudent-wyse soever ye be; Apo. 17. b.
fought against God and the Lamb / with your own Wisdom or Good-thinking. and
^o have troden-downe the Loueing-kyndnes of God in yourselues / with Feete^
shedd the Blood of the Righteous^ and accounted the holy Blood of the true
Testament of the Lord Jesus Christ / for Heb. 10. f.
unclean: shutt ye Glory of God quyt out of your Hearts: and so are become
replenished Math. 23. c
with all Unrighteousness, Wickedness, Maliciousnes, Mocking, and Blaspheamy.

Ioh. 5.12. d^
Praise and Honor / on-of-another* s^^t yourselues in Judgment / which
belongs Esa. 3. c. Sap. 3. a. Math. 19. c. 1. Cor. 6. a. Jude. ^. b
only to God with his Saincts^ and dealt coueredly, traitorously, and
deceitfully / in your Counsel of privy Conspiracies / for to accuse and
defame the Esa. 53 b. Sap. 2 b.
Upright of Heart thereby / with wicked Deeds, and so will have right / in your
own Wickedness and Lies.

6. But in all this your Unrighteousness / ye have loved and defended the
Creatures / above God: attributed the Honor unto the John. 5. c.
Creatures / which only belongs unto God: and so have among-each-other /
ascrybed the Virtues of God / unto the Flesh* and drawn the glorious John. 8.
Romans 6. c, 8. b. c
Freedom of the Children of God / unto yourselues: so that all your Judgment is
false / and proceeds out of the Lie, and not out of the Truth.

7. Behold, This false Judgment proceeding Genesis 6. a.
and the same has grieved Him. For-that-cause has He now in the last time
reversed;or in this Oldnes of the time; taken the righteous Judgment unto
himself / against all lying Flesh, Psalm. 96.98. a.
for to judge with Righteousness upon the Earth: namely, unto the Good / to a
Reward of all Good: Romans 2. a.
but unto the Evil / to a Reward of all Evil and Wickedness. And thatsame is
the Light of Truth, and the true John. ^. c.
Judgment that God has now in the last time / sent into the World / through
his Love / to the Declaring of ye Righteousness / for to judge Psalm 96. b Act.
1^. d. Jude. ^ b
the Circuit of the Earth with Righteousness / through thatsame Light / under
the Obedience of y^ Love: and so to make-manifest the Self-wyseones / with
their own Wisdom^ the wicked crafty Sights / with their Wickedness and
Craftynes^ and ye Prudent and Subtilones / with their Prudence and Subtiltee.

The III. Chap.
Adam. Com and let yourselues be seen in the Light: But what avails it / ye
shall all now be made-manifest before the same Judgment / what ye are. For all
your Nakedness reversed;although ye think to cover yourselues; becomes theare
layd-bare: and ye cannot also with all your own Power / Psalm. 76.130. Mala. 3.

2. Behold, such a Glistering of Cleernes has the Love in her Beawty and
Righteousness / that no Vncleaneone can reversed;with Joy; endure with her nor
with her Comunialtee. For his Wickedness or Craftynes is manifest ther-against,
euen-like as it does also appear with Many now in this present Day. Therefore
has likewise no Flesh of the fallen Adam / any pleasure therein: Whereby it is
known and manifest / Esa. 40. a 1. Pet. 1. c.
how vain all Flesh of Adam is / in all his Knowledge, Sight, and Wisdom.

3. Who will now I pray you / defend the sinful Flesh any longer / to a
Covering of his crafty Nature? Who will* I say; excuse it / in his
Subtil-wylynes? For there dwells Genesis 6 a 8. c Ier. 17. b. Math 15.23 b Romans
7. c
no Good-thing in it: but nodout / all Hypocrisy and Deceit.

4. Truly / it shall not be excused / before the Romans 3. d.
false and lying / in euery-poynt, and can witness no Truth / of any godly
Things.

5. Seeing now that the Deceit of the sinful Flesh, with all his Inclynacion
according to his own Sensualitee / is reversed;even in Experience by the Deed
and Truth; become know unto Me / through the Light / So cannot I likewise
for-that-cause / trust any Flesh of Sin, neither-yet believe nor allow any
Judgment Deuteronomy. 1. b. John. 7. c 8. b
that it judges according to the Sight of his own Eyes, or according to the
Hearing of his own Ears: but am altogether against the same, as that it is
wrong in all his Judgments that are according to the Sight of the Eyes, or
Hearing of the Ears / and judges Gods Truth falsely and out of the Lie: and I
do also testifye against all Judgment of the sinful Flesh / that it uses all
his Industry and Prudence / Phil. 2. c.
to the preferment of his Selfnes, and euenso judges to his Self-seeking^

6. Behold / so false, lying, and deceitfull^ and so full of Dissimulation and
Hypocrisy / it is in all his Doing and Leaueing. Not only in that
reversed;which has an evil show: but chiefly in thatt wherewith it will show
itself reversed;with a Shine of holy Speeches; to be holy and upright, and
wherein it will be allowed.

speaks / is all to the Covering of his Craftynes, and false Selfnes: let it
iustifye or clear itself then / so much as it will: let it transform his
Countenance to be so woful-hearted / as it will: let it sobb, let it sigh or
lament then / so much as it will: let it speak then so sweet or flatteringly /
as it will: let it testify then his Sight and Hearing / so perfectly as it
will: let it also be then so understanding or skillful / touching ye new Birth^

But I went alittle nearer to that Howling and Lamenting. And lo / when I
considered thereon, It was the Flesh of Sin / that wayled and lamented
excedingly / Apo. 18. b

no more esteemed, nor could get any Praise or Honor anymore, and that God
with his Saints / did only get the Glory.

And I could not bemoue the Generation of the euel-willing Men / in their
Howling and Weeping, because they did not repent. For all their Howling and
Weeping was / because they might no more use their Unrighteousness and their
Pleasure of Whordom and Theeuery / according to their own Will. And to leave

2. But seeing the Times are now perilous reversed;my Beloved; and that there
are also many Harms to be feared to ensue / if one should minister the Word
of Life unto anyman vnforesightfully / Therefore does it oftentimes seem
perilous unto us / to handle, to speak, or to write of the Word of Life, and
of his se^ret Clernes / before eueryone that would desire it. For it is not
euerymans Matter / to comprehend the same in his Cleernes or Secretnes: but
Math. 12.13. c. 1 Cor. 1.2. a
Theirs / whose Hearts be John 6. ^
stirred-vp reversed;by God; to a Deuont-meditation of the Word and his
Righteousness, and have intended Love and Peace.

/ out of the Service of the gracious Word / to thend that he might by that
means reversed;without doing him any Harm; be furthered to the good and
upright Knowledge of the true godly Things / through some Service showed toward
him by us, according to that Estrainging wherein he stands comprehended: but
chiefly toward those that with feruencie of Heart / desire or seek any
Information at our Hands.

4. And seeing that we reversed;through the Light; do behold the many-maner of
Perils in this Matter, as that it is hurtful unto Many / to reveal the
Secretnes of God unto them / therefore do not we open the Jewels of the
Secretnes of God, or the Secretnes of all godly Things / unadvisedly or
vnforesightfully / before eueryone.

5. And although likewise / that many are our Friends / who also nodout would
gladly know the Fulness of the Instruction of all Things / yet do not we
oftentimes follow their Will for-al-that / in our Service which we show on
them out of Love: but do deal with them / in Longsufferance, and with great
Carefulnes / 1. Tess. 2. ^.
like-vnto a Moother / with her Children, for to be serviceable unto them in
thatt which is most profitable or needful for them. For thatt which the one
can abide / the other cannot: and thatt whereby one farethwell, and wherthrouh
he is amended / thereby might another fare evil, and be made worse therthrough.



7. It is true, It should be so indeed / if the Stomachs were eueryone so
sound that they could endure the Bread in them, or were accustomed to the
Taste of Bread.

8. But seeing now that we do perceive by Experience / that many Stomachs are
not accustomed unto Bread, and for-that-cause grow soon John. 6.
offended / through the 1. Cor 3. a. Heb. 5. b
strong Food of Bread: and that Many of them likewise / have received or taken
no Bread into them for a certen-tyme / to a Food of Life, but have
swallowed-in somewhat heere-and-thear / out of the Wilderness / in the Darkness /
Therefore are also the Stomachs generally defiled / by the Multitude of strainge
Meats, and Men's Complexion grown very weak and tender: and cannot therefore
John. 16. b. 1. Cor. 3. a Heb. 5. b.
endure the Bread of the liueing Word: chiefly / because they are nourished-vp
with so many-maner of strainge Meats reversed;in the Dark; in the Wilderness.
By means whereof / their Stomachs have corrupted their right State serueing to
the Taste of Bread: so that they have no Hunger nor Lust at-all / to Number. 21. b
the Bread of the liueing Woord^ neither-yet any sweet Taste in the same. For
their Lust stands always bent toward thatt whereunto their Tastes are
accustomed.

9. And thatsame is likewise the Cause / why the secret Bread of the holy Word
/ does not oftentimes serve for eueryones Stomach.

10. For one may find many Men / for

11. Whosoever then is com alittle unto Health, and is yet but weak and tender
/ to him there serves nothing-els at the first / but to receive Honey 1. Cor. 3.
a Heb. ^. b. 1. Pet. 1. a
and Milk / out of the holy Word, to a Sustayning of him in his Weakness. For
he cannot as-yet endure strong Meat.

12. But when Strength comes unto him, and that he can bear the Weakness of
his Neighbor / so does. it then serve him very-well / to receive of the ^ec^et
Bread of the holy Word / for a Food of the strong Life / that he may yet
grow stronger^ and have the John. 10. a.
Life in Fulness: and that nothing may hurt M^r. 16. b Luke 10. ^
nor let him for to live.

playne^ and not according to the Course of the Wisdom of this Worlde^ nor of

2. Notwithstanding, although our Service of Love be plain / yet is it unto us
/ a godly Service in the Word of Life. Which Service / we reversed;out of
Courtesy 2. Cor. 4. a. Tit. 3. a

3. For truly, in all this our mostholy Service of Love / we do not
follow-after the Wy^e of the World / in their Wisdom, nor-yet the high-bosting
Scripture-learned / in their Knowledge, nor any Chosen-spiritualtee / in their
Holiness, nor any taken-on God-seruices / in their Controversy: but we witness
the Wisdom that avails before God, which seems to be a 1. Cor. ^. b
Foolishnes before their Eyes / and do make-manifest the upright Righteousness
and Holiness which God esteems: which seems before the Eyes of the World,
and before all her Hipocrits, feigned Holyons, and Scripture-learned / to be
Esa. 15. ^ S^p. 2. b. 5. ^
nothing but Sin, Unrighteousness, or Seduceing.

4. For in all thissame / all Hipocrites, feigned Esa 5 c. 5^. ^ 59. b
for Light, and the Light / for Darkness / and grounded all their Understanding
/ upon their Knowledge / in the Darkness: and so have entangled themselves in
many-maner of Prudencies / through their own Knowledge: and brought the whole
World euerywheare / into so many erring Blyndnesses: in-such-sort, that
for-that-^au^e / all Understanding of Men / has corrupted Genesis 6. ^
his Way, euen-like as all Flesh did / in the time of Noe. Therefore is also
their Destruction com hard-by.

5. And seeing now that we have founde-out in the Deed and Truth / that all
manly Understanding has corrupted his Way in the Knowledge / So do we likewise
reversed;through the Light of the eternal Truth; behold a great Woe and
Grief among Many: Ez^ 7. b Luk 19.^^. ^
the which is coming euerywhear over the Children of Men. And thatt is the
great Destruction over the manly Generation / in the Last time.

6. For the Destruction has taken-holde of them, and shall make-vp itself to a
Destruction among them, and fall upon them all speedely. namely, because that
their noble Understanding / has forsaken De^t. 32. ^
the liueing Being of God^ and entangled itself with so many-kyndes of
ignorant Knowledge or Good-thinking: so that the Children of Men have
therthrough / plucked I^^ 23. f. g

Love / is the Salvation and Peace.

8. Seeing now that the World stands comprehended 1. John. 5. c.
in the Destruction of the ignorant Knowledge: the which she does neither see
nor mark / so is therefore the Affection of our Heart / over all those and unto
all those / which do see or know the Destruction over themselves, and which
desire our Service / to theobtayning of a godly Knowledge / whereby to be

The III. Chap.
Behold reversed;my Beloved; this have them according to the Prefiguration of
the Letter: wherthrough Many of them have made unto themselves / a wicked and
naughty Conscience, by the which / they suffer themselves to be judged / out of
the Darkness: and so do Isa. 2. a I^r. ^. b
fear and serve those Gods which they themselves have made.

2. And although they be somtymes rebuked by their evil and dark Conscience /
yet be not the Darknesses made-manifest in them for-al-that, neither become they
also any Light: For they cannot / because that their evil and dark Conscience
(although it be esteemed for Light and Truth) is Darkness and Lies itself.
Therefore it is a certain Testi^ony / that such a Conscience is untrue / and
does neither judge right, nor rebuke to Amendment.

John. 1. a. 5. c. 14. a
which is the Light and Life itself / is much greater 1. John. 3. c
in Power / then the dark Conscience. For He himself / does reversed;thorough

sainctifyeth his Name / in us: and shows that He himself / is the Lord and
the right 2. Tim. 4. b A^^* 10. f
and true Judge / in our Consciences.

4. Therefore should not the Man take any Judgment upon him / out of his dark
Understanding or evil Conscience, although the evil Conscience will seem to
execute the Judgment / out of the Darknesses: But always to long after some
better thing, and to set the Comfort of his Hope Romans 15. a.

Nourtering with Righteousness: and so might reversed;to his Salvation;
take-heede to the Rebuke and to the nourterable Information / ministered by the
Light. namely, through the Service of the holy Word / under the Obedience of

8. Behold, thatt is the Judgment of the Righteousness of God, and the Coming

10. Heerin have we to praise our God, for that He reversed;through his Light
and Service of Love; prepares us the Victory against the Death and Hell. For
those are 1. Cor. 15 a
the last Enemies of the Life / from the which / God will cleanse us / according

The IIII. Chap.
Therefore ought not the Man to God, and that he knows his Estrainging / yet
does not the Knowledge bring with-it any Submission unto him / in the Being of
the Estrainging from his God.

2. Yea, how submitted soever he will seem to behave himself / yet is it
doutles no Submission: but an Vnsubmission. For the Longing rests not / Psa
42^ a.
for to com to the Beholding of God: and the same Vnsubmission is upright and
good. And now when the Man is com to the Being of his God / by the Obedience
to the Service of Love, and knows that same in his Beholding / as a Light of
Life / Then does that Being / bring-forth the Submission itself. For God is
with him, and Psalm. 16. b
is always in his Beholding.

3. If he be in the Kingdom of Heaven / then is God thear also with him: If he
be in the Hell / then is he thear well and safe: For God is Psa. 139. a
thear likewise with him. If he go-about to-and-fro with the Creatures / then
is God thear in like-maner with him. And in such an Estate / the Man is
euerywhear and in all points / submitted unto his God.

4. For God is always with him Psalm. 16. b
at his Right Hand: and his euer-liueing Being / is also a Light still / in
his Beholding: Therefore he fears not. And euenso in the true Being / the
Submission is upright and good. And whosoever taketh-on another Submission, or
if that anyman should think to content himself with another Submission /
without the true Being: and so hunteth-after the Submission / he shall not
find the right Submission.

5. Wherefore, because that we should not Esa. 55^ a.
Seek the Lord / whylst He is to be found: Call to Him / whiles He is
neer-by. I will be found (says the Lord / by the Prophet Jeremy) when ye Ier.
29. b
seek me with all your Hearts.

6. To the same does Peter also exhort the Brethren of Faith: 2. Pet. 1. b.
We have (says he) a sure prophetical Word, and ye do well that ye have
regard thereunto / as unto a Light / which shyneth in a dark Corner / till
the Day break, and the Morning-light ryse-vp in your Hearts.

7. Behold, These Doctrines, and more such like / do all teach the
Vnsubmission / thewhyles one is yet in the Absent-beeing from God / because
that the Longing toward our God reversed;in Longsufferance; should not
cease. Therefore noman has the right Submission, neither is also the
Submission promised to anyman / in the Estrainging from his God: but only in
Gods Being / the Light of Life.

8. But thewhyles we do yet walk upon 1. Par 29 d Psalm. 39 c. 1. Pet. 2. b.
Heb. 11. c.
and Pilgrims / so have we our Comfort reversed; Romans 15. a
in a firm Hope; upon the Promyses of God / through his gracious Word, and do
credit God / that He is true in his Word and Promyses: and do Romans 8. c Tit.
2.
weight euenso with Patience / upon the Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. Whose
Coming / comes with Light and Cleernes, and with the Fulness of Life. And so in
an assured Hope on the Appeering of Christ reversed;who is coming unto us in
the Spirit; we have our Consolation 1. Tess. 4. b. Heb. 10. ^
with each-other / thewhyles the deadly Things have yet captiued us: and so we
1. Cor. 11. c.
confess the Suffering and Death of Christ / for our Sins cause. And
euenthus through Faith / we become armed likewise with the same 1. Pet. 4. a
Mind of the Suffering and Death of Christ, for to be planted into Romans 6. a
Him with the like Death / under the Obedience of the Love.

Christ / with the like Death / do wait for Him to com Romans 8. b Tit. 2. a
with a Gloryousnes of Life / over the Death / whereby to make us reversed;which
suffer with Him; alive Romans 6.8. 2. Tim. 2. b.

our Life / For to inherit euenso in the Resurrection John. 3. a. Romans 6. a 1.
Cor. 15. e. f Phil 3. b Col. 2. b.
out of the second Birth from the Death / a sure Confession of the
Resurrection of Christ / to our Iustifycation, and to reign with Him for ever
in the heavenly Being. namely / over Sin, Death, and Hell / and over all the
Enemies of the Life. And thatt is the Gospel of the Kingdom, Math. 28. c Mar.

FArdermore reversed;my Beloved; thou

Writing; to inform thee thereof: and demaundest of me therewith, and de^yerest
an Answer ther-vpon / how I have behaved myself in the Passingouer or
Wading-thorow the same, for that thou moughtest likewise follow-after me.

3. Verily, I cannot answer thee according to thy Request / how I have always
behaved myself / in the Making-vp of the evil Conscience and erring Ignorance
in the Darknesses. But to shew-forth Heb. 10. c Iam. 5.
Patience / in our Affliction, thatt is profitable and good for us all: and to
have a firm Hope upon God / in our Trial or Temptation.

Sap. 1 b.
and Condemnation reversed;which ryseth out of the unmeasurable lying Being,
or maketh-vp itself ther-out; are all Lies and corruptible. For none of all
these evil Things / wherewith the Man is Sap. 11. b
punished in Darkness reversed;for his Sins cause; has God Sap. 1 b.
made. Therefore it is all / Death and Lies / whatsoever is not He himself,
neither-yet that He has made. For all what God has made / Genesis 1 a. Sap. 1 b
Eccli. 40. a
is good: and is euerywhitt / Life and Truth, to the Blessing and Joy of the
Man.

5. But if-^o-be now that thou do not know or see all these evil Things
reversed;which do tempt or besett the Man; to be Lies and Darknesses / then art
thou yet much-to-weake / for one to talk anything with thee of the Truth. and
as-yet to-ignorant of the Truth / for to understand anything thereof, or to
comprehend anything of the Light of Life.

6. But seeing that these evil Things reversed;which are all Lies and Darkness;
do captive us, and bewitch our Hearts: and that we have accounted of them to be
somewhat / therefore have they brought us to Suffering and Grief: and do
likewise seem unto us to be somewhat / so long as we do believe the Lies and
Darknesses. But in this Tribulation and Heauynes reversed;in the time of our
Temptation; let us shewforth Eccli. 2. ^. Iam. 5. a
Patience / in the Hope of Deliverance. And thatt is it whereof I have comoned
with thee: But not so plainly as I do now write the same unto thee.

7. Now for to be altogether delivered John. ^. Romans 7.8. b

obedient to the true vndeceaueable Light, and Pro. 4. a. 5* a^

thy Spirit / 2. Pet. 1. c.
take-heede to the Light of Grace, euenas the same is now in the last time /
revealed unto us / in the Word of Life reversed;under the Obedience of the
Love; out of the heavenly Truth / To thend that thou may be renewed in
thine Understanding / to a good Knowledge: and so may with a good Conscience

wher-with thou wart before-tyme bewitched in the Knowledge.

but to figure it forth unto thee in Writing / according to the Gift of the

2. First-of-al / submitt thyself to the outflowed gracious Word of the Lord,
whereby to enter obediently into the Requyring of his Service of Love: and so in
thy Obeying of the Requyring of the same Word and Service / take-heede to the
Wisdom of the Word / Iam. 1. c

then all Gold and Silver / and much-more of value / then all precious Stones.
Whosoever fyndeth her / he has a costly Treasure: For the Wisdom in the

3. This Wisdom reversed;seeing it is of God; Sap. 7^ c Iam. 3. b.
is also (...)* courteous, and freendly: For it is the true Christ of God, the
liueing Word of the Father, and the everlasting Life.

Gen 1 a. Psalm 33. a Pro 8. c Sap. 1. b John. 1. a.
thorough the which / God has made all Things: and without the same / God has
made nothing / that is any-what.

5. This Life John. 1. d.
is for a Light of Men / to thend that the Man should live the Life / that
proceeds Romans 6. a 1 Pet 4. a
out of God. And this Life is in Us: John 1. a
and we are made through the same, and grounded or set ther-vppon / as upon a
liueing Word Esa. 40. b 1. Pet. 1. c
that continues for ever: And to the same Word in his Service / we be all
called and bidden / because that we should euenso through his Service /
believe thereon.

6. Thissame was in the World also, John. 1. b Heb. 1. a
and the World was made by the same: but the World knew it not.

7. Thissame Word or Life / does likewise bear euery-thing / Heb 1. a
with the Being of his Power: and makes the Ephe. 1. a.
Cleansing of our Sins / through Himself.

8. Behold, by thatsame has Genesis 1. ^
God made all Things well / in the Beginning: and there was nothing made in the
Beginning / of all that God had made / but it was all good. And God did also
behold it all for good.

9. And so from the Beginning / there was no Gen 1. c Sap. 2. c Eccli. 17. a
with the Godhead. And in Beholding it / there was no Difference: For it was in
euery-poynt / godded with God: and so in the Beginning / there was nothing-els
but one God, one Light, and one Life.

10. Out of this Life / did God bring-foorth the Memory or Understanding, Genesis
1. b ^
to be an Help to the Life / to thend that euery-thing should be handled and
governed well and orderly / by the Memory or Vnderstanding^ and by the Life /
wher-out God had brought the Memory. Therefore did likewise the Life / inclyne
to the Understanding, and cleave unto her: for she was a Light / of his Light,
and a Life / of his Life. Therefore was she also the Most-beawtyfull and the
Most-delytfulone to the lovely Life.

11. Thewhiles that this Understanding / turned-not-out or fel-not-away from
the Life: but did always stand-firme in the Life / for Genesis ^. b ^
an Help to the Life / so was-ther Joy and Peace with God and the Man: and
there was no Division or Middle-wall / betwixt God and the Man: neither had the
Understanding any other Knowledge / but that she lived to the Life, and stood
obedient / to the Service and Welfare of the Life, and to the Rest and Peace of
all Generations of the Earth.

John. 1. b
Lord in his Glory: and the Math. 24. a Act. 1. a
Setting-vp of the same Kingdom again / those are the Promyses of God the
Father. namely, to establish the same / through his Love and her Service / in
the last time.

13. But when the Memory or Understanding turned-away from the Life,
taking-vpon-her to know something / that was not the Life itself, nor that
stood grounded in the Life, neither-yet was for an Help unto the Life / Then
did the Understanding mingle herself with thatt which was nothing, or which God
had not made: and thatt was the Evil / against the Good, the Lie / against the
Truth, and the Death / against the Life. And thus did the Understanding
committ Adultry, and she was inflamed with the knowing of something without the
Life. And she became subject to the Vanitee or Thatt which was nothing: and
then was the Transgression brought-to-pas, and the Sin was in-that-sort
brought-forth / John 6. ^ 17 2. Tess. 2. a
as a lost Child of the Devil and of the Condemnation.

14. Behold, euenthus was the Man captiued in his Memory or Understanding /
Romans 1. c. 2. Cor. 4 a. Ephe. 4. c.
with a blind Knowledge, or with an Understanding of the Darknesses: which
Darknesses are John. 3. ^
beloved of the Man^ and taken-on for Couerings Esa 25. a. 2. Cor. ^. b.
or Aperus, to a Covering of the Genesis 3. a.
naked Cleernes of the manly Foorme / which God had created to be Genesis 1.2.
his Image: and so reversed;in the Taking-on of the Couerings; God was no more
for a Light of Life unto the Man, nor for a Delight in his Paradise: but for a
Dryueing-out Gen 3.
from his Face.

15. And now when the Man was estrainged Exo. 10. c Psalm 105. c Sap 17. a
captiued her: and ye Life and Truth was unknown / by reason of the
Darknesses: and so the Death Sap. 2. c Romans 5. c.
got the Vpper-hande.

16. The Devil or the Contrary-nature to God / took the Understanding captive
in his Bands: and thus did the Kigdom of Death, of the Devil, and of Hell /
get his Foorme in the Man / and increased in Preuayling. Wherout all false
Spirits 3. Reg. 22. c
or Spirits of Lies / have had their Coming-foorth / to work Deceit and
Seduceing: and have reversed;in sundry manners; had their Work Ephe. 2. ^
and Error / in the Children of Men.

17. And euenthus did the Lie reversed;who is a Father of the Darknesses; get
the Dominion / to the Destroying of the Children of Men: and the Esa. 60. a.
Earth was filled with Darkness. And the People that were borne upon the Earth
/ were all Romans 1. c 2 Cor 4. ^ Ephe. 4. ^
covered likewise under the same Darkness. For when as now the Darkness / was
grown to be a Middle-wall betwixt the Life and the Understanding* and that the
Life of God / gave no Cleernes to the Understanding / then was it all Error /
whatsoever the Understanding tooke-on out of the Knowledge. For when the Life
stood not for a Light unto her / then was also the Truth of God / altogether
hidden from her: and she could bring nothing-els to the Life / but all deadly
Things of the ungodly Being.

Or out of whose Breasts do ye suck such Venom of corrupt Milk? And wherout do
many of you frame such a false Freedom / that ye have showed us a fayer Face /
before our Eyes, also have flattered us with your Toungs / whilst ye were
present / and do now with such a false Heart / mock us privily or behind our
backs / among those that do gladly give ear unto you, and so boldly smite and

laid in an earthen Vessel / Romans 9. c. 2 Tess. 2. c.
that seems before you to be too-dishonourable, and for that He also /
declares the same ther-out?

2. Do ye despise the costly Treasures / Romans 9. c. 2. Cor. 4. a.
for that they likewise / be carried in earthen Vessels, and declared unto you
ther-out, and brought unto you out of entyre Love?

3. Do ye despise Gods Righteousness / because it ryseth-vp so gloryously / over
the sinful Flesh, and deals so Romans 8. a. 1 Timo. 1. b 2. pet. 3. a.
longsufferingly and graciously with the Sinners?

4. Do ye despise the Wisdom of God / because that the same reversed;even with
the Fulness of the holy Understanding; is com so bright in glorious Cleernes /
over the Foolis^^es of Men?

5. Do ye despise the Age of Christ / because He reigns so 1. Tess. 2. a b 1.

6. Do ye despise the Knowledge and holy Understanding / because they have their
fellowship among the Ignorantones, for to bring them into the upright and godly
Understanding.

7. Do ye despise the Mal 4. a. Sap. 5. a.
Sun the heavenly Daylight of the highest God because she shines in the
Waters / John. 7. d.

your Math. 6 c. 20 b. Luk ^^. ^.

Service of Love / would give ear unto your Foolishnes / which ye through the
Romans 1. c.
Blyndnes of your Hearts / do esteem for great Wisdom, and would follow you
therein / Then would ye not likewise see their Foolishnes nor their Ignorance /
Even like as Many of you do not see nor understand the Worlds Foolishnes and
Ignorance.

11. But seeing now that many good-willing Hearts do see into the Ignorance of
the wicked World, and the Error of many People: and so do Eccli. 6. d.
submitt them with us / to the holy Understanding / for to become Ephe. 4. c.

Childishnes, nor at the Seeming of our Foolishnes: but remember that the
Childishnes of the Holyones of God / is manlyer, and procures more Fruits of
Righteousness / among the Believers / then the manly Glory of the wicked World.

14. Remember also / that the Foolishnes of the Elect of God / is 1. Cor. 1. b.
much wyser / then all the Wysdom of the wicked World.

15. For whosoever does not separate himself from the World and from her
Wisdom, and so becomes 1. Cor. 3 b.
foolish before the World / for the Wisdom of Gods sake / He likewise shall
not com to the Wisdom of God, nor-yet understand the secret Counsel of God.

He likewise shall not com to ye Age of the Man Christ.

Thatsame is He that rightly loves you, and which is rightly serviceable unto

Way of the same / leads to the Math 7.25. d.

Good-thinking, nor chosen Holiness: but turn your Hearts to the Seat of Grace,

Unity of Heart in the Love, to the Peace, and to the Righteousness) So have I
endeavored me with Diligence of my Heart / for to perceive to what end thy
Mind and Intent might stretch in thissame: or which is the Cheefest-thing
that thou seek or intendest therewith.

2. If-so-be now that I do find in the Deed and Truth / that thy whole
Heart, Intent, and Mind / does (as thou wrytest) stande-mynded with Me / to
the Love / that everlasting and invisible heavenly Good: Then will I not also be
mistrustfull toward thee, nor-yet conceive otherwise of thee / then thou
wrytest. but will hope all good of thee.

Inclynation to his own Sensualitee / according to his own Pleasure / Therefore
have I doutles to consider well thereon, and to use a great Circumspection to
the things that the Man giueth-foorth of himself: and likewise for to perceive
out of what Ground of the Heart / the Man's Conversion, or his Mind to the
Good / cometh-to-pas, or out of what Intent he calls Thatt the Good /
whereunto he turns him. namely, whether ye the same which he turns him unto /
do Romans 6. b. ^ a. 13. b. Gal. 5. b.
delight him according to the Flesh of Sin, and according to his fleshly Will:
or whether that he turne-away himself from all what is a Delight unto the Flesh,
and so has a psalm. 40.
Desire with all his Heart / to do the Lords Will.

4. For-that-cause reversed;thou Beloved; inasmuch now as all s^nfull Flesh is
generally reversed;in his Conversion; so Gen 6 ^*

cannot I so simply believe nor trust thee / at the first / because yt I may yet
perhapps have some Suspicion / whether that thy Conversion may proceed out of a

Delight of the Flesh / or no, and therefore cannot continue steadfast with thee.
Notwithstanding / by thy Writing / I hope the Best of thee.

5. But seeing that it is all Pro. 11. b.
unsteadfast / whatsoever is taken-on out of the Pleasure of the sinful Flesh /
therefore must I needs write unto thee of the same, and of my Mistrust that I
have toward it. For doutles I can trust no Flesh of Sin, nor anything that
the Man inclyneth-vnto / according to the Mocions or Pleasures of the Flesh /
as to thinck that his Humilitee and Lowelynes or Littlenes / is so wholly
inclyned to the Love of God the Father / with an upright Heart / as his Words
and Wrytings do import. Also / none of those things can persuade me to trust
firmly thereon / that it shall be found even so in the Deed.

6. Notwithstanding, although I do mistrust the Man / according to the
Inclynacion of his Flesh, and do not so simply believe him at the first / yet
do I well vouchsafe unto him with all my Heart / all the Good whereof he bosteth
him. Yea, I would also that he had obtained such Mercy at the hands of the
highest God / as his Words do speake-of, or as his

7. But verily, all whatsoever is testified, enterprysed, or begone / out of

erecting, or obeying of what Holiness or Righteousness soever it be) therein shall
noman reversed;whosoever he be; be able to continue steadfast: but they must all
needs be varyable and com to shame therein.

8. For seeing it proceeds out of the Flesh of Lies / Romans 7. b. c* 8. a. ^.
Cor. 3. a.
therefore also is not the Power to the upright Righteousness and Holiness / with
the same: but it is only with the highest God: Which God / brings or sends
his Power / Ephe. 3. b. Phil. 2. b. 3. c Col 1. c.

themselves with all their Hearts / unto Obedience under the Spirit of the Love

any Flesch, as to honor the same with any fleshly Righteousness or Holiness / 1

Seeing then that there belongs no Christ bring all sinful 1. Cor. 1. c.
Flesh to shame reversed;in the Purpose of his own Holiness or Righteousness

Righteousness of the true Life, and the Love itself. Which God / permits not

then by what means it will) Psalm ^5.24 a Esa 33. b. Heb. 12. c.
but only by his own virtuous Being, and godly Nature, or Spirit of Love.

2. But this does the Flesh dislyke-of: for-that-cause also / it has no
pleasure in the God of Heaven, nor in his Glory, nor-yet in the Judgment of his
Righteousness. For ther-through it fyndeth itself altogether vain and weak /
before God and his Truth. also utterly Job. 9. ^ b. c Psalm. 126. b. Romans 3. a.

3. And the Flesh, or the Wisdom proceeding out of the Flesh / does likewise

neither-yet is it esteemed as to make any account thereof.

Romans 10. a. Gal. 3 a. 4. b Col. 2. b c.

5. But Gods Saints reversed;which dwell in Heaven; shall laugh the Flesh of
Sin to-scorne / with his foolish Bewitching, and with all the Hipocrisy of
his forged Holiness. For the Man has therthrough forsaken the lovely
Righteousness of the upright Life in the Peace. and reversed;with his own
Righteousness; plucked much Strife and Controversy upon his own Neck.

6. He has also lest to give Ier. 2. ^. Romans 1. ^
to the God of Life his Honor / John. 5. ^
that belongs only unto Him. and has sought and defended his own Honor.
Therefore has he likewise dealt with so many Wickednesses, and Killings or
Murderings. By which occasion / he cannot also understand or conceive
any-thing-at-all Math. 23. Romans 10. ^
of the upright Righteousness which avails before God, which notwithstanding /
bringeth-the Love and the Peace unto him.

7. Seeing then that the Man reversed;in his Ignorance; Genesis 6. a. ^ Romans 1. ^.
Ephesians. 4. b.
corrupted / through the Bewitching of the sinful Flesh, and has geeuen a
great Respect unto his own good-thinking Knowledge / so has he likewise turned
all his Diligence toward the same / to Romans 10. a.
set-vp his own Righteousness / according to the Goodthinking of his Knowledge.
and has generally had a pleasure in his own Works.

reversed;through the Appeering of Christ in his Glory; bring all Flesh of

Cleernes of God / God will judge Psalm. 96. b. Act. 17. d.

9. Therefore shall now likewise in thissame Day / all Generacions of the Earth
reversed;which set their Confidence upon their own Wisdom, Righteousness, and
Holiness of the sinful Flesh; Esa. 13. a. Joel. 1.2. Sap. 5. a. Lu^ 21. c Apo.

10. Although I write thus unto thee / thou Beloved: and do not regard any
Flesh of Sin / in his own Righteousness / yet do I account this of great
value / that all Flesh with all his earthly Being / do lay-downe itself on his
right Place [namely, Psalm. 110. a. Heb. 1.10. b.
to be a Bench for the Lords Feete] and so submitt itself to the Requyring of

according as thou wrytest. Whereby also it shall not be grievous unto me / to
conceive the Best of thee: and that thy Writing proceeds not out of thyself,
nor out of any prudent Counsel of the Flesh. but out of a Sap 1. a. Ephe. 6.

the Land of his Glory, and to our Joy in the Unity of Heart / for that we

12. But if now it be Flesh, or if it proceed out of the fleshly Being / then
shall it surely Job 14. a.
chainge and be unconstant, and vanish-away under the Hand: and my Spirit
reversed;which is the Lords; shall not bind itself unto the Fleshes Being.

13. And if it be Spirit, or if it proceed out of the Being of the true

thatt be far from me / that my Heart, Mind, and Soul / should mind or
affect anything-els / but only the spiritual and true heavenly Good, and those

captiued with evil Imaginacions toward our godly Service of Love, and the
Ministers of the same: and so have likewise reversed;by reason of thy Resistance
and Blaspheamy; despised ye Service of the holy Word under the Obedience of
the Love. and euenso have much-more commended the false Testimonies of the
good-thinking Wyseones, and the Institucions of the wicked World (because they
might hyde themselves and walk covered ther-vnder / with their evil
Consciences) then the true Light and the upright Doctrine of the Service of
Love, before the which / the Hearts of Men must appear John. ^. c. Ephe. 5. b.

think to cover their Wickedness) we must oftentimes be blaspheamed^ and judged
for Euel-dooers and 2. Cor. 6. ^.
Seducers of Men. But verily / they cannot cover their Wickedness and Craftynes
therewith / before us: but they become so-much-the-more manifest / what they are,

which are not wise in themselves, but do submitt them humbly under the Love

but only Esa. 61. b. Luke 2. c.

9. For in the Judgment of God, when the Thunder-clapps do fall upon the
Arrogant and Self-wyseones / to their Destruction / then shall the holy Spirit
of Life / fall upon the Littleones, and the Electedones of God / that have
humbly submitted them under the Obedience of the Love / to their Preseruacion:

10. Have you all a regard heerunto / ye good-willing Hearts and Lovers of the
Truth. For Gods Judgment / Esa. 11. a. John. 7.8. b
is not according to the Sight of Men's Eyes, nor according to their Knowledge
(although notwithstanding they do persuade themselves somtymes / that they
know it well, and are assured of the Mattier of it) but only according to the
Truth.

Work of the Lord / which He himself writes according to his own Mind,

2. And whatsoeuerthen the Lord himself bringeth-foorth / thatt do we
acknowledge to be good and upright: And although it be looked-on and judged for
Ignorance or to be foolish / before the Children of Men, or before all those
that account themselves wise / Yet do we confess and show ther-against /
that Gods Ignorance and his Foolishnes / is 1. Cor. 1.3. b
wyser, and procures more Fruits of Righteousness upon the Earth / then all
the Ingenious-witt of Men's Prudencie.

3. Therefore we regard not how Men reversed;out 1. Cor. 4 a.
judge Us and the Service of Love / which we minister. For it is well known
unto us doutles / that all the Judgments that the Man reversed;out of his
Ingenious-witt; judges of the Wisdom and Works of God / are false and Lies:
Psalm. 116. b. Romans 3. a.
and that God with his Saints / is only true / in his Judgment.

4. And forasmuch as we now in thissame Day of Love / are appeered before the
Iudgment-seate of Christ, and do carry the righteous Judgment of God in our
Hearts / therefore can no outlandish Men, nor any Estraingedones or Fallers from
the Service of Love / judge us / although they would neuer-so-fayne. For how
should they reversed;I pray you; be able to judge us rightly / inasmuch as they
cannot see us?

5. Forasmuch then as they do Exo. 33. c. John 5.14. b. 1. John. 3.4. b
not see the liueing God / in the Maiestee of his Glory / therefore can they not
likewise see Us. For We, together with all the Holyones of God / do live and
triumph uniformly with God / in his Glory, Esa. 3. b. Sap. 3. b. Math. 19 c.
25. d. 1. Cor. 6. a. Jude. ^. b.
and do with Him / judge the World / with Righteousness and Truth / under the
Obedience of his Love.

6. Therefore also the Children of Men reversed;that are without our Comunialtee
or without the Famyly of Love; do understand nothing-at-al reversed;according
to their Judgment; of our holy Understanding / which we suck out of the

a.
the true God of the Liueing reversed;who is a God with us; judges every thing
by Us, and his heavenly and spiritual Wisdom: and we understand that his
Judgment is true.

8. If anyman then have a Lust to do the Will of the Lord: also to be a
Disciple of the Love / in ye School of Christ: and to understand the secret
Judgment of God / let him go-out, or separate his Heart / 1. Cor. 3. b.
from all the Wisdom of the World: and so com to our Comunialtee, and to the
Wisdom that we shall show him / under the Obedience of the Love.

geeuen-ouer himself to the Wisdom and to the holy Understanding of the Love /
for to be obedient to the same: and so taketh-heede to the Doctrine of the Love
/ in our School of the christian Doctrine (not as a Judge of the same Doctrine,
but as a Disciple / which is content to be informed and taught by the Doctrine
of the holy Spirit of Love) Then shall he Math. 13. b.
well understand the right Mind of the Secretnes of the Love, and the secret
Judgment of God. as also well perceive / that God has distincted and declared
euery-thing wisely and vnderstandably / with us. and shall in-nowyse be able to

Submission, the Truth, and the Patience / each-one in his right Place, and
according to his right Order. in like-maner / the Belief, the Love, and
euery-thing reversed;each-one in his; whatsoever serves the Man to his
Salvation.

11. For how should we possible show anything contrary or unrightly / out of
the Testimonies of God, inasmuch as they stand so clear and upright before us
/ in our Sight, and that God is Deu. 8 b. Phil 2. b. Ephe. 3. c. Heb 13 c.

for-al-that: neither-yet is God, nor We reversed;his Ministers; to be blamed /
for such a perverse Sight: but he which reversed;out of his perverse Math.
5.6. c 18. a.
Sight; Judges falsely.

2. For if the Earth reversed;which doutles is altogether blind and ignorant
in the Art or Work of the Potter; do judge a Esa. 2^.45. b. Romans 9. c.
Potters Work wrong / then is it no-dout greatly to be blamed, because that it
knows not the Honorablest / from the Dishonorablest, nor the Foremost / from
the Hindmost, nor-yet any of the Workmasters Tools. For-that-cause also / it
knows not how to distinct them rightly.

Esa. 59. a. 2. Pet. 1. b.
gropeth or coniectereth after it / like a Blynd-body: or-els reversed;out of
the Purblyndnes of his Sight; he judges the Hindmost / for the Foremost, and
the Foremost / for the Hindmost, the Wagon / for the Horses, and the Horses /
for ye Wagon, and Men / for Trees. And so through his Ignorance / he also
names the Carpenters Tools contraryly. For like as the Sight and Discerning
of the Man is perverse, euenso is also his Judgment.

4. Seeing then that his Eyes are not clear, and Ier. 4. a. ^. b Math. 6. ^. 7.
a. Luke 6. c. 11. d. Act. 7. f. 1. John. 2. b
that his Ears are thick, and that his Body is yet dark: and that therefore he
beholds not the Sun of Righteousness: neither-yet stands in thatt Place
whear she giueeth her Cleernes: but is altogether a Stranger therfrom /
Therefore does he neither know nor understand anything-at-all of the Cleernes
of the Sun. For-that-cause he cannot also judge in the Light, nor according to
the Truth.

5. Now when an illuminated Man reversed;with the Cleernes of his Eyes; sees
into the Truth of God: and that he likewise witnesses of the Beawtyfulnes of
the Daye-light of ye Sun: also gives such high Honor and Praise unto
the same Light: and therefore testifyeth / that no vncleere Eyes, Math. 6. c.
nor dark Bodies / have John 5. d.
ever seen or known such a glorious Light / in his Cleernes: and that then
thosame Testimonies do com before the Eyes and Ears of the earthly Man, Pro.
3. a. Esa. 5 c. Romans 1.12. b. 1. Cor. 3. b.
who thinks himself to be wise, or to be illuminated / through his Knowledge /
So does then thatt earthly or self-wyse Man suppose reversed;according to the
Imaginacion of the Knowledge or false Light; that the illuminated Man / does not
testify rightly of the Cleernes of the true Light of God.

6. Therefore, because that the vnilluminated endure Gods Light / in his Eyes,
he judges reversed;out of the false Light / that has captiued his Heart; the
illuminated Understanding / to be wrong.

7. Then when an illuminated Man / testifyeth of the Love of God, and of the
Spirit of the same* and that eueryone ought to submitt them obediently
ther-vnder: and then when thosame Testimonies do com before the Ears of those
* that look upon the Flesh, and not upon the Spirit / Then do they judge the
Love* and the Loves Spirit and Requyring / upon an outward Man, even as though
the outward Man himself / required the Obedience and Love, and
reversed;according to the Flesh* named himself / the Spirit of Love, or took
Gods Dignitee upon him.

8. Therefore verily, a fleshly or earthly Man reversed;that lives without the
Service of Love / according to his own Goodthinking; is altogether false,
Psalm. 116. b. Romans 3. a.
lying, and ignorant [namely / in godly Things] in all his Sightes, Knowledges,
and Judgments.

The IIII. Chap.
For-that-cause let eueryone let the Judgment alone, and get first a Apo 3. c.
clear Sight, and a pure Soul / in the Love / That he be not judged before
the Iudgment-seate of Christ (before the which we stand) for a false Judge.

2. Oh! How well is he minded / that judges not, and that construeth and
accepts all in good part / that is witnessed or spoken to him / unto good:
and so walks in stillnes, and keeps his Mouth / Psalm. 3^. (...).
as if there hung a Lock before it, that he lie not: and which falls not ^
through his Tongue.

3. Therefore can thou not excuse thyself / ^ Man, Ro^ (...)
whosoever thou bist that iudgest. For wherein thou iudgest another / therein
condemnest thou thy self, inasmuch as thou thyself act gilty in thatt / wherein
thou iudgest another.

4. By diverse of these false Iudgers / am I greatly impugned: so that I have
had great cause geeuen me by Many / to write against them: but thatt have I not
used hitherto reversed;as against any Person or Company perticulerly; nor named
them by Name. but have witnessed generally / the Ignorance of the Blaspheamers
and Resisters of the Love* and made it known to the Vnderstandingones.

5. Forasmuch then as our Service has his generally reversed;according as the
impartial Service of Love requires it; what is Good or Evil for eueryone:
and wherein the Man has Right or Wrong: and that altogether out of God, 2. Cor.
3. a.
and not out of ourselves.

6. For the Lord himself reversed;as a righteous and impartial God; has
reversed;according to his Promyses; made his Judgment / Esa 28. b.
a Measure-lyne, and his Righteousness / a Balance / among us. Therefore we do
neither receive nor-yet giue-foorth anything / unless we do measure it all
impartially / with the Measure-lyne of the Judgment of God: and weigh it all
likewise according to his Value / Eccl. 21. c. 28. d.
in the Balance of the Righteousness of God.

7. Oh! That ye all did so likewise, and according to the same manner / stood
concordably and impartially minded with us / under the Obedience of the Love:
and that even so eueryone did first learn reversed;under the Obedience of the
Love; to keepe-scilence, and then to speak rightly: also learned first to
suffer Wrong, and so to know thereby / thatt which is Right / er-euer he gave
any Sentence of the Right / to thend that he might speak according to the
Truth, and judge John 7. c.
rightly: As likewise learned first / to endure 2. Cor. 6. a.
Shame, Dishonor, and Dispising / with Christ, and thereby to know Gods Honor
/ er-euer he tooke-vpon-him to defend Gods honor, and to allow himse^f to be
right in his Judgment. Consider effectually heeron.

8. Seeing then that the many-maner of 1. Co^. 4. ^*
before the time, nor-yet speak to-soone: but that eueryone do first
reversed;under the Obedience of the Love; become Luke 14. c.
a Distiple of Christ: and so Ephe. 4. b. Col. 1. b. 1. Pet. 2. a.
growe-vp in the holy Word of the Spirit of ye Love of Christ / to the Age of
the holy Understanding of Christ.

9. Then when he is become a Christian or an Elder of Christ / in ye holy
Understanding / so can he then likewise reversed;through his new Birth; judge
rightly / Sap. 3. a. Math. 19. ^ 1. Cor. 6. a.
with Christ, and with all the Saints of God / but otherwise / all his
Judgments are false.

10. If anyman be now (as is before said) become a Disciple in the holy
Understanding of Christ / under the Obedience of the Love, and so reversed;even
unto the Regeneracion; be grown an Elder therein / He shall then well
understand the Elders in the holy Understanding, or the Ministers of the holy
Word in the Famyly of Love / in their secret Wisdom: and in no-wyse strive nor
contend reversed;with his Understanding; against the Elders in the Love of
Jesus Christ / which do minister the Word of Life under the Obedience of the
Love: but shall likewise himself reversed;as an understanding Elder with the
ancient Elders; inform the Disciples of the holy and gracious Word or Christ
reversed;in the christian School of Love; 1. Tim. 4. b. 2. Tim. 1.2.3.
with holy Understanding, and with Lessons of Wisdom / to all Concord in the
Famyly of Love / To thend that thosame Disciples / might also attain to the
Days of their Agednes^ and so be nourished-vp *in the godly Wisdom of the
Love; to the full Age of the Man Christ.

that ye likewise / have (in manner as is before said) bin Luke 14. c. Iam. 1.
c.
Disciples of Christ: and are in that sort / com to ye humble and meek Hearts
in Jesus Christ, and to his holy Understanding.

2. But if it have not gone so with you / then take not upon you also / to judge
any godly Matters, nor to defend Gods Honor, nor-yet to teach anyman: but be
content to be taught and informed first yourselues, and submitt you euenso
Eccli. 6. c. Math 11. c. 1. Pet 5. a.
to all Humilitee / under the Obedience of ye Love / for to be rightly taught:
and so learn of the Love / the holy Understanding of Jesus Christ.

3. And let not him likewise that is yet young in this Doctrine of the godly
Wisdom / judge nor reprove: but let him ask, and suffer himself to be taught:
and so Ephe. 4. b. Col. 1. b. 1. pet. 2. a.
growe-vpp in the godly Age of Christ, to all Strengthening and Increasing of
the Peaceable-kingdom in the Love / So shall he then become understanding in all
godly Things, and the Kingdom of Peace shall increase, and spread-foorth itself
into far Countries.

4. If we now do in that manner / growe-vp peaceably in all Love and
Righteousness / then shall the contencious and divided Esa. 21. a. Ier 51. a*
Apo. 14.18. a.
Kingdom of Babel / be shutt without our Hearts, and without our Comunialtee of
Love: and we shall behold the House or the Temple of the Lord / in Heaven /

and furnished with all his Garnishing. and that the Glory or Dignitee, and the
Teaching-office in the Service of Love / is only the Lords, according to the
Promyses, and not the Man's.

5. HEer-with I do heartely salute you to the Love. For ther-is nothing wyser
nor more prudent / then the Love.

6. Therefore is the Love in her Follishnes / much godlyer to hear and to
believe / then all the Wisdom of this World.

7. For-that-cause it has likewise so pleased God / to bring-foorth his Wisdom
/ 1. Cor. 1. b.
like Foolishnes, his holy Understanding like Ignorance, and the Foremost / as
if it were the Hindmost / before the World and before all her Wise and
Scriptur-learnedones / whereby to confound the prudent Wyseones: and so the

holy Understanding / to be a Esa. ^. a. 1. Pet. 2. a.

2. Depart out from the Uncircumcised, and let your Hearts Deuteronomy. 10 c. Ier 4. a.

God and his Righteousness / under the Obedience of the Love: and that their
Labor in the Lord / shall 1. Cor. 15. f.

renewed in the Service of Love, and pray unto the Lord for Strength and

9. What is now this Love / which in her Service / requires such Obedience?
might some man demand. The Answer:

10. The Love is a verytrue Being, out of the which / the Belief does grow

Righteousness.

11. The Love 1. Cor. 13. a.

gracious Word: and likewise to bring-foorth all what is serviceable to the
Peace and Unity of Heart in the Love: For by her almighty and virtuous Nature

Truth says:

6. Know in your Spirit reversed;O ye goodwilling Hearts to the Righteousness;
how that God the true Father is Iam 1. c.
an everlasting vnchaingable Spirit, a steadfast Power, a Genesis 1. a.
Creator of Heaven and Earth, and of euerything that shall continue for ever:
Heb. 1. a.
also an Vpholder of his Works / with the Sap. 7 c.
Word of his Being: a clear Light and liueing Fountain, wherout all Virtues
and Righteousnesses do flow.

Jesus Christ, Genesis 1. a. Psalm 33. a. Pro 8 c.
through whom / God has made all his Works: and He is out of God the Father
published unto us reversed;by the Rom 10. a. 1 Pet. 1. c.
Word of Preaching of the holy Gospel; John. 1. a.
to be a true Light / that lights all Men through the Coming of his
Appeering, and is set-before us / for an everlasting Savior, Math. 1. c. Rom

and a Reconciler for our Sins. namely, for all those Sins Math. 12. d.

that are committed against the Father and the Son.

8. Know also the holy Ghost, John. 14. c. 15. c. ^6. b.
which comes unto us / out of the Father and the Son reversed;as a Spirit of
Truth and Love; in the Obeying of the Word of God and Christ: which
establishes us therein, and declares the Kingdom of the God of Heavens unto
us: and in what Foorme and Being / that the Father, and the Son, and the
holy Ghost / is one true God.

9. Behold, thatt is verily the true Kingdom of God / Luk* 17. c.
inwardly with in us: and his Righteousness is / that the Man should
reversed;with his Spirit; be incorporated to the same Godhead, and live therein
for ever.

The VI. Chap.
Understand now according to the Math. 6. d,
that we ought first or before-al / to seek.

2. But seeing that the Man does now generally / seek the Kingdom of God and
his Righteousness / contraryly, and not rightly: Ier. 19 d. John. 7 d.
and for-that-cause cannot find the same / through his own Understanding /
Therefore has the Goodness of God / looked upon our Ignorance, and declared his
Kingdom, and the Righteousness thereof / unto Us / through his Love.

3. To which Kingdom of God, and his Righteousness / and godly Maiestee of the
everlasting, spiritual, and heavenly Being / and to all his Holiness, Beawty,
Riches, and to his euer-liueing Ioyfulnes / We be all now called and bidden /
by the holy Spirit of the Love of God the Father / to the Preseruacion of us
all / in thissame last and perilous Time. For He / the same God ye Father, the
Son, the holy Ghost presents us now with his Love, and will Leui. 26. b. Eze.

dwell, live, and work in us. Let eueryone take-heede to thissame gracious
Time.

4. The Father draws John. 6. ^* g
or allureth us to him / by his gracious Word and Service of Love: and
whosoever yields himself to be drawn by the Father / comes to the Son /
the out-flowen gracious Word of the Father.

John. 3.6. c.
beleeueing Him / remains John. 8.1^. a
in Him / He saves.

6. And Whom the Son saves / John. 3.6. f.
he has the everlasting Life: and is Act. 1. a. 2. b.
anointed with the holy Ghost.

7. And whosoever is anointed with the holy Ghost / he is established Romans 8.

or altogether godded in the everlasting liueing Godhead, and is uniform with
all what concerns the Godhead or is of God: and inheriteth the Kingdom of the
God of Heavens, and all the Riches of Christ of the heavenly Goods.

8. Behold, euenthus does the holy Ghost reversed;which is the Spirit of Love;
confirm the Kingdom of the God of Heavens, and the Promyses of God the Father
and of Christ: and John. 16. b
leads the godly Man into all Truth, and declares euery-thing unto him that
is in Heaven and upon the Earth.

9. But whosoever has bin negligent in the John. 6. c. ^.

Forgiveness of Sins / if he submitt 1. Pet. 5. b. Iam. 4. ^.

10. But whosoever neglects him in the holy Spirit of Love, and resists and
blaspheameth the same or his mostholy Service of the spiritual and heavenly
Goods / Math. 12. d. Heb. 6.10. c
He continues in Indignation, and shall never John ^. a.

Ghost reversed;who is the Perfection of all the Works of God; has and vseeth
his Service reversed;the which is the last Service of Grace; now in thissame

12. But take you good heed of the Kingdom of the Devil, which also shows
itself inwardly reversed;before the Eyes and Thoughts / that are earthly Romans
^. a.
and fleshly minded; as a Kingdom of God: and deceaueth the Fleshly-myndedones

Freedom / which it brings to the Flesh / according to his Fleshly Lusts and
Disyres, and seduceth the Hearts of Men.

The VII. Chap.
any Being or Life that is spiritual and heavenly: but out of thatt which is
nothing and earthly or corruptible: and therefore is likewise the Generation of
the same / earthly, and not heavenly / fleshly / and not spiritually minded /
according to Gods Spirit / therefore does it also grow offended always / at
those things that are against their Minds or Thoughts, and maketh-vp itself
2. Tess. 2.
against thatt which is of God and of his Service of Love.

2. The Same Generation of the Devil / will not also stand submitted under the
Obedience of the Love, nor of the holy Word: but refuses the Requyring thereof
/ and so will live according Ier. 7.^^ a. 13. b. 18 b
to their own Will and Good-thinking, and wrest 2. Pet. 3. b.
and construe the Scripture / according to their false and Fleshly Mind / and
so will live unto themselves, and love themselves / according as the Knowledge
imagines in them.

3. Therefore is the Devil / in his Kingdom (although he appear before all
fleshly Minds / as if he were a 2 Tess. 2 a.
God of Light) not els-what but a Nothingnes of the Lie: and is likewise
for-that-cause / a John. 8. a.
Father of all secreet or inward Wickedness, and a Render or Parter-asunder of
all Concord / whearas he is harkened-vnto and believed and accepted as good
and true.

4. Behold, the same Father of Wickedness 2. Cor. 4.2.
wicked World and of all Ungodly or impenitent Men is / in all his Being / a
2. Tess. 2. b.
Contrary-beeing unto God* and his Son / a Contrary-beeing unto Christ, a
Destroyer, John. 17. b. 2. Tess. 2. a.
a Child of Wickedness, which makes the Hearts of Men / stout upon their
Knowledge: and brings also a false Freedom unto Many / for to sin boldly,
and to continue in the worldly Abhomynacions and Foolishnes / with vnaccused
Consciences, and to make-vp themselves Dan. 22. a.
resistant against the Truth, and the godly Love of God the holy Father.

5. And their Spirit [namely, of the Father of Wickedness, and of his Son or
Child of Wickednes] is a wicked Spirit 2. Tess. 2. a.
of Lies, which confirms the Man reversed;being in his Unrepentance, and in
his Disobedience to the Requyring of the gracious Word of the Lord and his
Service of Love; in the Being of Lies: and leads him into all Lie and Error*

6. The Same false God and Father of Wickedness / does also reversed;with his
wicked Self-willednes; allure 2. Tess. 2. a. b
or draw us unto him / through the private Love of ourselves: and whosoever
does yield himself to be so drawn by him / comes to his Son his Child or
Being of Wickedness the false Christ or 1 John. 2. c 4. a.
Antichrist, the Destroyer, which is the Christ of the wicked World and of all
Vngodlyones, and works in his People an inward or ^. Tess. 2. b.
secret Wickedness / which they themselves cannot well perceive.

7. And who^soeuer then comes so to the Son of the Devil, as also becomes
incorporated to the same Being of Wickedness, and bydeth therein / he is quyte
and clean corrupted / in all his Mind / by the Wickedness and by the private
Love of himself, and by the Disobedience and Resistance to the Love and her
right Service. Yea, so quyte corrupted / that he is inclyned to nothing-els /
in all his Mind / but to his Self-wilednes, and to all Destructionablenes: and
to destroy the Family of Love / wherein the liueing God of Heaven dwells,
lives, and governs / and the Good-willingones to the Obedience of the
Requyring of the same God: or to stand against them in euery-behalfe, and to
draw them away from the single Obedience which they show in the Requyring of
the Service of Love, and to corrupt their Understanding / with the
good-thinking Knowledge.

8. And whosoever then is thus corrupted by John. 17. b. 2 Tess 2 a.
of the Devil and of Wickedness or by his Ministers / under the Power and Will
of the Devil, and is grown of one-mynde with the wicked and ungodly Nature /
for to be pliable to the same, and so is become enuyous toward the Famyly of
Love / he is borne a Child of the Sin and of the Devil, and an Heir of
the hellish Being and of the perpetual Math (...)
Condemnacion. and anointed with the wicked Spirit of 3. Reg. 22. Esa 18 b. 2
Tess 2.
Lies. Which Annoynting / is a false Freedom, or a false free Mind and Being
of the Devil. And thatsame is the false Freedom which the Disobeyers and
Resisters of the Love / do willingly accept-of in their Vnregeneracion, and do
much sooner and rather inclyne-vnto / then to show Repentance for their
Sins, and to submitt them to the Doctrine of the Love of Jesus Christ.

9. And whosoever then takes upon him to live free / being unregenerate, and
so in his Vnregeneracion / is anointed or quyeted with the false Spirit of
Lies or of Good-thinking^ taught to the Kingdom of Hell^ and made free in
vseing all Wickedness and Resistance against the Love / He is likewise a
Fellow-member of the Devil and of the Wicked Nature or Antichrist: wherthrough
he is then in that fort / wholly and altogether deuiled with the Sap. 2. d.
John. 8. c.
Deuill^ natured with the wicked Nature of Antichrist^ and leadd by the false
Spirit of 2. Tess. 2. b.
Lies / into all Falshod and Lies, into all Disobedience to the gracious Word,
and into all worldly and ungodly Abhomynations: and so inheriteth the
Desolation of al horrible Abhomynation. And thatsame is the Kingdom of Hell,
Sap. 1. c. Math. 2^. d. 2. Pet. ^. ^.
and of the he^^ish Fire / wherein all wicked and seduceing Spirits have their
Dwelling, and do com-foorth their-out for to seduce.

10. Behold, such a wicked End and horrible Sap. 2 a. Apo. 13.
looked-into / as a Light and Kingdom of Pleasure, and as a good Freedom for
all Disobedient and Vnregeneratedones.

11. Take you heed of this wicked Nature / ye Deerly-beloued, and keep your
Hearts pure from the same / through the Word of Truth / that is ministered unto
you in the Obedience of the Love. And although it do make-vp itself in you
somtymes / against the same Word of Truth / yet become not of one-mynde with
the same in-any-wyse: but hang your Hearts on the upright godly Being of the
Love, and to be obedient to his Requyring: and so reversed;in the Obedience of
the Love; ouercom the Evil / Romans 12. c.
with the good Being of God.

12. If now ye do Eccli 6. c. 1. Pet. 5. a. Iam. 4. a.
submitt your Hearts under the Obedience of the Love / with all Humilitee /
then shall ye also in thissame perilous Time / not be seduced nor deceived by
the wicked Being: but bide preserved with the Good.

13. To your Preseruacion / ye Deerly-beloued reversed;to thend that ye might
love the good Being, and be warned of the Evil; so could I not omit to
write a little unto you of this Matter also, and to set it forth before your
Eyes and Ears / Because that ye should reversed;with a good Understanding;
understand a right Difference betwixt the godly and ungodly Being. The Lord
vouchsafe to preserve you all from the Evil, and to lead you into all Truth.
Amen.



15 Heerwith reversed;ye good-willing Hearts to the Love; ye be altogether
heartily saluted.

The End of the Sixtenth Epistle.
The Seuententh Epistle. A groundly Instruction of the Man's Glory / in the
Beginning: of his Fall, Death, and Condemnation: and of his Restoring into his
former Glory again.
Written and sent unto the Lovers of the Truth / which submitt them with us /
under the Obedience of the Love.

Under which Obedience of the Love / all Men are reversed;now in the last time;
called and bidden to assemble them to one Man of God / in the only and true
Body of Jesus Christ: to a perfect Glory / both of God and the Man.

Let us be upright in the Love, and grow in all parts / in him which is the
Headd / even CHRIST: by whom the whole Body is joined together.

Ephe. 4. b. To those / whose Spirit is one Spirit with Us in the Love / be
Health and Salvation.

The First Chapter.
Act. 2. a. 2. Cor. 4. a. Col. 1. b. 2 Timo 1. a
and com unto us from the Right-hande of God the Father / out of the heavenly
Truth* grow and increase more-and-more among you all / my beloved Hearts in
the Love, even till unto the most-perfect Cleernes / Ephe. 3. d. 2. Pet. 1. b.
in the Inwardnes of your Hearts / To thend that ye may reversed;through
the same Cleernes; see, know, and understand / to what a Noblenes and Kingdom
of God of concordable Louelynes / God has Gen 1. c. Sap. 2. c. Eccli 17. a
created the Man^ and chosen and loved the same Generation: like-as our Wrytings
reversed;set-foorth by us / under the Obedience of the Love; do sufficiently
reversed;with full Instruction; show the Cleernes of thatt Matter / were it
rightly understood.

2. Although reversed;ye Beloved; that ye have often heard of this Matter by
us, or readd thereof in our Wrytings: and do also partly see-into and know
the same / yet am I forced notwithstanding / out of the Heart of Love
reversed;that stands affected toward all your Hearts / to an Unity in the
Love; to write a little-more unto you / of the upright Being / wherein the Man
was created, wher-from he is Genesis 3. ^. Sap. 2. c.
fallen, and wher-vnto he is called again / by Christ / to thend to stirr-vp
the desire of your Spirit the-more, and to procure all your Will the-more,
toward the upright Being of the true Light, and to the Incorporating John 15.
^ 17. b.
to one concordable Man of God / in whom / God with his Christ, and with all
his Saints, Spirits, Prophets, and Angels / dwells, liueeth, and tryumpheth
with Glory and all Delytfulnes / as a Rom 14. b.
peaceable and Heb. 12 b.
vndisturbable Kingdom. To him the same God / Ephe 1. b.
to the Laud and Praise of his Glory, and to him the same godded Man / to his
perfect Joy. Amen.

3. Behold and consider / ye Beloved: Gen 1. c
when God had made al-things well / then was the Lord / a Lord of his
Kingdom, and a God of his Works. There was not also in his Kingdom, nor-yet in
all his Works / any-more then one God, and one Man: and they were One, and had
in all respects / one Kind, Being, and Nature: And so reversed;at thatt time;
God was all what the Man was, and the Man all what God was.

4. And when God looked upon the Man / Gen 1. c. Sap 2 c. Eccli. 17. a.
whom He had created according to the like Being of his Godhead, and with whom
He was manned / then looked He upon himself, as the same Cleernes of his liueing
Godhead / uniform with the Manhod.

5. Behold, thus uniform with the true Being of God / was the Man in the
Beginning: and this was all one Being / the Man and God. And so God behealde
Genesis 1 d.
his Work which He had made / that it was Good.

6. And when the Man likewise behealde his God / with whom he was godded / then
saw he reversed;in the same Cleernes of his God; the noble and pure Cleernes of
his Manhod / uniform with the Godhead, and perfect in all Virtues and Beawty*
namely, according to all the From and Being of the same Godhead. Lo, this was
likewise all One / John 17 c. Ephe 2 b
God and the Man.

which had his perfect Beawty and Cleernes both upon the Earth and in Heaven /
with the Man, and in the Man. And ther-was nowheare any Sap. 1. c.
Kingdom of Hell, nor Death, nor-yet any Unrighteousness / neither in Heaven nor
upon Earth. For God had made all Things good and well / which He had made: and
also created him no more but one Man, who was as God himself. And God blessed
this Man: and has said unto him / that he should grow or increase him,
replenish Genesis 1. c.
the Earth, and bring it under him.

8. Also God gave no other Customs, Rytes, Laws, nor Commandments unto the
Man / in the Beginning / but to live with Joy and an Genesis 2. b
uncovered Heart / in the naked or uncovered Cleernes of his God, and likewise
to walk always naked or uncovered / before Him: and that he should euenso
behold all the Works of God / for good / and not for euell^ know nothing but
Good / and not any Euell^ and taste or feel nothing-els but Life / and not any
Death^ Salvation / and not any Condemnacion.

The II. Chap.
Behold: Thatt would God, and [namely, the Man / with the Godhead] should
reversed;as one only peaceable Kingdom / in all Louelynes; bear ^en. ^. c. d
the Dominion over the universal Earth / to the Welfare of all Creatures.

2. But as-soone as the Man turned-away the Sight of his Eyes / from his God,
and looked upon himself: and so turned-vnto and loved himself / the^ perceived
he that he was not altogether the highest Godhead himself but with the Godhead
/ a Man also, Gen 3 a.
and became tempted to the Knowledge of Good and Evil, for to be ther-through
in euery-respect / as God himself.

3. When the Man had geeuen-ouer himself ther-vnto^ and taken-on such a Fruit /
of the Knowledge of Good and Evil / then came Blyndnes over him, Genesis 3. a.
and he estrainged or separated himself from the lovely Cleernes of his God. By
means whereof / he could not endure the Word or the Voice of his God^ nor
appear before Him / with his naked Manhod: but was Genesis 3. b.
ashamed before God / of his naked Manhod.

4. He could not also behold, nor conceive any other Light or Cleernes / but
thatt which he framed to himself / out of the Knowledge of Good and Evil: or,
euen-as the same Knowledge imagined it in him. The which was all Ignorance and
Darkness: and was always to a more Leading-awaye or Estrainging of the Man from
his God, who is the John 1. a 8. b. 9. ^. 12. ^
everlasting Light and the true Wisdom.

5. He fealt likewise no other Life of Righteousness,

6. He knew not also any other God, Kingdom of Heavens, nor Salvation / but
such as he prefigured unto himself / through the same forenamed Knowledge / which
the Man himself had taken-on. The which was nothing-els / but the Devil
himself the Kingdom of Hell^ and the everlasting Condemnacion. Sap. 1. ^.
whom / God would not that they should be upon the Earth.

7. And euenthus did the Darkness and the Devil John. ^. c.
the Father of Lies as also the Kingdom of Hell reversed;as a deadly and
damnable Being; get a Foorme in the Man: and so became the Man, and all what
was borne of him / Genesis ^. b. Romans 5. b. 1 Gor 15 c.
subject to the Death and all Destruction: and he got in that manner / the Ier.
17. a.
craftiest Heart / above all the Beasts upon Earth / by which means / the
whole World is grown so Eccli. 37. ^.
full of Falshod.

8. COnsider well now reversed;ye goodwilling Hearts; what a destructionable
Heritage the Generacions of Men have inherited / through the Knowledge of Adam:
wherthrough the Man (who is created by God / for to be One with God, and ought
to be One with each-other) is fallen or grown into so many kinds of Division
and Destruction. Which Destruction of the harmfull Knowledge / we may now easily
perceive / through the Cleernes of thissame Day, and through the Declaring of
the Service of Love / if we have regard thereon: and that chiefly eueryone in
himself.

^en. 3. d. Sap 1. c.
from the Life of God^ and estrainged from the Kingdom of the God of Heavens;
again to his God / in his upright Estate / So has God out of John. 3. b.
his Love (euen-as He had promised / to the Salvation of the manly Generation)
brought-forth a new Man / according to the same Likeness or Foorme of his
Godhead, Mat. 1. ^. Luke 2.
who is called / Jesus Christ: which signifies unto us / the safe-makeing Oil
or Annoynting of the godly Being. This Man is gon-out John. 13. a. 16. ^.
from God, and has showed himself upon Earth.

10. He is entered into the Knowledge of Men, and has found the much knowing
Wisdom, together with her Scripture-learnednes / false and lying / in all what
she knew.

11. This false Knowledge (inasmuch as she 1 Cor 1 b
understood not the Truth of God rightly / by all her Wisdom nor
Scripture-learnednes) has Christ Math 23.
rebuked. also brought-in a true Knowledge / besides the same, and taken 2 Cor
1^. a
captive the Knowledge of Men therewith: wherthrough God has euenso reversed;by
his Christ; made all the Knowledge or Wisdom of Men / 1. Cor 1.3. c
Foolishnes / to thend He would in that sort reversed;in thissame tocoming
Day of his Glory; release or make the Man free from all his foolish Knowledge /
under the Obedience of his Love.

12 In this like-maner has Christ don also Math. 12. c. 15. b. 21. d.
Sin, and with the false Righteousness of Men.

13. He is likewise entered into the Death Math. 27.
of Men: and has also brought-in a Death besides the same [namely, his Romans 6.
a. Phil. 2. a.
Death of the Crosse] to the Makeing-alyue of Men: and so has reversed;through
his Death; taken-captiue 1 Cor. 15. f.
the Death of Men / for that He would now in the last Day reversed;in his
Coming-agayne; Romans 6.^ b 1 Cor 15. c. 2 Cor 4. b. Ephe. 2. a. Col 2. b.
rayse-vp the Man from the Death / through his Death of the Crosse^ make him
alive through his Spirit of Loue^ and bring him to his God / in his upright
Estate.

14. Euenso has He don likewise with the Devil, Darkness, Hell, and
Condemnacion: in whose Bands the Man has walked, and bin so bound therein /
that he could not escape the Condemnacion. Whose Oze. 1^. b. 1. Cor 15 f Apo.
20. b.
Power is now reversed;in thissame Day of Love; altogether broken^ and the Man
reversed;which believes and giueth-eare to the Love in her Service; made safe.

The III. Chap.
Jesus Christ had Psalm 68. b. Ephe. 4. a.
taken-captiue the Power and Dominion of all pernicious Things reversed;which
burdened the Man, and were destroying; and Psalm 8 a. 11. c. 28. b. ^. Cor. 15.
c Ephe 1. c Heb. 2. a
had brought them all under him / through his Death of the Cross / Then did He
rise again from the Death / with his Power and Dominion over the Destruction,
and was seen alive / Math. 28. b John. 20. d. Act 2. c. 10. c 1. Cor. 15 ^.
by his Friends: and so has reversed;through the Declareing of his
Resurrection; caused his Friends and Desciples that believed in Him / to see,
and made-knowen unto them / the obtaining of the Power and Victory / against
all the destroying Things wherewith the Man was captiued.

2. Now when He had commanded his Disciples / that they should publish thatt
which they had seen, heard, and learned of Him / for a Gospel in all the
World / to the Salvation of Men / in his Coming-agayne / Mar. 16. b Luk 24. f.
Act. 1. a.
Then did He ascend from them / to the Seat of his godly Glory: and has
possessed the Heaven, and set himself at the Right-hande of the Maiestee of
his God / in the-Heigth. From thence has God reversed;by the same Christ;
poored-out his Act 2. a.
holy Spirit / upon the Disciples of Christ / which believed in Him, and
observed his Word / for to make them unto Him / a true Comunialtee of his
Saints.

3. Behold, euenthus has God / beholding Act. 17. d.
Math 3 a. Luke 3.24. ^ Act. 2. d. 3. b
upright Repentance for Sin / to be published unto all Men / by these Saints
of God and Christ, and to give them to understand / that He has set or
appointed a Day reversed;which is the Day of Love; Psalm. 96.9^* Act. 17. b.
on the which He would judge the Circuit of the universal Earth / with
Righteousness / by one Man / in whom He has concluded it: who holdeth-foorth
the Belief before eueryone, inasmuch as God has raised Him up from the Death.

4. Forasmuch then as God is true in his Promyses, Luk 1. e g.
and does continually show his Mercy on the Generations of Men / to the
Establishing of his Promyces / so does He likewise declare unto us in thissame
last Day of his Love reversed;which God has set and appointed for a Day of
his righteous Judgment; how or in what manner his Promyses do stand firm and he
accomplished: and that God is Psalm. 139. b. Apo. 15. a.
wonderful in all his Works.

5. Seeing now then that the last Time is 2. Timo. 1. ^
A^peering of the Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ / So will God likewise now in
thissame Day / accomplish all Act. 3. c.
what He has spoken and promised in the former Times. namely, reward Math. 25.
c. John 5. c. Romans 2. a.
ye Good / their Goodness / with the Reward of all Good / in the everlasting
Life: and recompense the Evil / their Euelnes / with the Reward of all Evil /
in the everlasting Death and Condemnacion. For the Day reversed;wherein
eueryone shall receive Ier. 17 b. Math. 16. c Romans 2. a. 14. b. 2. Cor 5. b.
Apo. 2. ^.
his Reward / that he has deserved; does now spread-foorth itself over the
whole World: and his Cleernes ceasseth not / before all this be accomplished.

2. Therefore look sharply to it: O Yea reversed;ye Deerly-beloued; look
sharply to it in anywyse: and have always a watchful Eye / with a clear
Sight. For this say I unto you / out of a liueing Sight of the Truth, that it
behooves us now to have a sharp Circumspection / in our mostholy Service of
Love, and for the crafty Subtiltees cause of the Flesh (which we reversed;alas;
do find to abound) not to believe anyone to-simply at the first, nor-yet to
trust the On-commers or Disciples reversed;which give themselves to our Service
of the Word; to-much at the first, as to think that they are so altogether
plain and vpright^ simple and devout / as they make show for.

3. Although likewise that they do loueingly 1. Timo. 5. ^
ouer-hastyly / for upright Brothers or Sisters in our holy Comunialtee, as to
give any such respect unto them at the same instant / for to talk or to deal
with them reversed;like-as with the Elders; touching all the Secretnes of the
heavenly Kingdom: but let them reversed;for a time; Col. 1. b. 1. Pet 2. a.
growe-vp among you / in the Word, and show faithful 1. Pet. 1. b c
Obedience in all what the Word reversed;under the Obedience of the Love;
requires: and then if the same do appear in the^ / ye shall well perceive
thereby / whether they also desire with us / to live the upright Being of Jesus
Christ / in all Love and Concord. For in the Trial reversed;when as they be
chastenably informed with the holy Woord^ and taught to the Obedience of the
Requyring of the Word / and must bear Reproach, 1. Cor. 6. b.
Blaspheaming, and Affliction / at the hands of the Wise and
Scriptur-learnedones of ye World; they shall thoroughly become manifest / what
they are, and what they love, or have intended.

4. But in all this / love you them / to their Salvation and Preseruacion: and
carry always a favorable Heart of Love toward them, and mark whether that
they do also intend the upright Being of the Love / with all their Hearts /
or no: and so do neither seek, love, nor desire anything-els at our hands /
but to live the virtuous Nature of the Love, to walk therein, and to growe-vp
Ephe. 4. b.

Math. 2^. c.
faithful in the Word: and so mark what is the Cheefest-thing that they
seek and desire at our hands / in the Service of the holy Word: 1. Cor. 10.

whether it be their Owne-selfnes, or whether that they desire to serve the God
of Life / in his Love. If you have in-this-maner a regard heerunto, ye shall
soon perceive / whether it be Flesh / or Spirit^ Earthly / or Heauenly^ and
Corruptible / or Everlasting, that they Gal. 3 ^.
seek or desire at our hands.

6^ Seeing then that the Times are now daingerous, wherein we perceive and find
so many and sundry-sorts of Wylynes and Subtiltees of the Flesh / therefore be
you also careful or suspiceous at the first (yet hopeing of some better)
whether there might be likewise any Subtiltee or Deceit / in the on-coming
Desciples, or whether they might not seek or desire anything-els besides the
gracious Word and Service of Love, as namely / the Honor and Gal. ^. b. 1.
