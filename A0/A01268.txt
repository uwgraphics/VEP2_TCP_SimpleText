The preface of this boke^
GRace and encrea^e of knowelege from God the fader through our lord Jesus
criste / be with the christen reader / and with all that love the lord
unfeignedly Amen.

I chanced b^ing in these parties / to be in company with A christen brother
wiche for his commendable conversation / And sobre behavour might better be a
bishop the^ many that wear myters if the reule of. s. Paul were regarded in
there election. 1. Tim. ^
Tit. 1.
This brother after much communication / desyrid to know my mind as touching
the sacrrament of the body and blood of our savioure Christ. Which thing I
opened unto him according to the gist that god had gevyn me. First I proved
unto him that yt was non article of our faith necessary to be beleved under
pain of da^nacio^ The^ I declared that christ had a natural body / evyn as
mine is (savyng sin) and that yt cowde no more be in two places at once then
mine can. Thyrdly I showed him that it was not necessary / that the words
should so be understand as they sound. But that yt might be a phrase of
scripture / as there ar innumerable. After that I showed him certain such
phrases and ma^er of speaking. And that yt was well used in our english tongue
and finally I recyted after what mauer they might receyve yt according to
christ's institutyon / not fearyng the froward alteracyon that the prestes use
contrary to the first form and institution.

When I had sufficiently published my mind / he desired me to entitie the some
of my words / and write them for him / be cause they seemed ouer^onge to be
well r^teigned in memory. And a^beit I was loath to take the matter in hand /
yet to fullfyll his instant intercession / I took upon me to touch this
terrible tragedy / and wrote a treatise / which be side my paynfull
impresonme^t / is like to purchase me most cruel death / which I am ready and
glade to receyve with the sprite and inward man (allthough the flesh be frail)
when so ever yt shall please god to lay yt upon me. Notwiths^ondinge to say
the truth I wrote yt not to the intent that yt should have been published For
the^ I would have touche^ the matter more ernestly / and have writyn / as well
of the spiritual eating and drinking which is of necessite / as I d^de of
the carnal which is not so necessary / for the treatise that I made was ^ot
expedient for all men / albeit yt wear sufficient for them whom I took in
hand to ens^ructe. For they knew the spiritual and necessary eating and
dryn^ynge of his body and blood which is not receyvyd with the teth and belie
/ but with the ^ares and faith / and only ne^ed instruc^yon in the ou^ward
eating / which thing I therefore only declared But now yt is commen a broad
and in many men's mowthes / in so much that master more wc of late has busted
him sellfe to meddle in all soche materes (of what zele I will not defyne) has
sore labored to confute yt but some men think that he is ashamed of his perte
and for that cause does so diligently suppress the work wc he prynted. For I
my sellfe saw the work in prent in my lord of wynchesters house / upon S.
Stephyns day last paste. But nether I nether all the fryndes I cow^ make /
might attain any copy / but only one wrytyn copy which as yt seemed was
drawyn out in great haste natwithstondinge I can not well Judge what the cause
should be / that his book is kept so secrette. But this I am right sure of /
that he never touched the fou^dacio^ that my treatise was builded upon. And
therefore sith my foundation stondith so sure and invincible (for else I think
verily he would sore have labored to have undermined yt) I will there upon
build a little more / and also declare that his ordinance is to slender to
break yt down all though yt were set upon a wors foundacyon.

The fondacion of that little treatise was that yt is non article of our faith
necessary to be belevyd under pain of dampnacion / that the sacrament should
be the natural body of christ: which thing is proved / on this manner.
First we must all aknowelege that yt is non article af our faith which can
save us nor which we are bound to beleve under the pain of eternal
damnacion. For if I should beleve that his verey natural body both flesh
and blood were naturaly in the bread and wine / that should not save me /
saying many beleve that / and receyve yt to there dampnacyon / for yt is not his
prsense in the bread that ^an save me / but his presence in my heart thorough
faith in his blood / wc has washed out my sins and pacyfied the faders
wrath toward me. And again if I do not beleve his bodily presence in the
bread and wine / that shall / not dampne me / but the absence out of my heart
thorough vnbeleffe. Objection
Now if they would here obiecte that though yt be truth that the absence out
of the bread could not dampne us: yet are we bound to bel^ve yt / be cause of
gods word which who belevyth not / as much as in him lies / makythe god
al liar. And therefore of an^ obstinat mind not to beleve his word / may be an
occasion of da^pnacio^

Solucio^
To this we may answer / that we beleve gods word and knowelege that yt is
true: but in this we dissent whether yt be true in the sense that we take yt
in or in the sense that ye take yt in And we say again / that thought ye have
(as yt apereth unto you) the evide^t words of christ / and therefore co^siste
in the bark of the letter: yet are we compelled by conferringe of the
scryptures to gether within the letter to search out the mind of our savior
wc spoke the words And we say therdly / that we do it not of an obstinate
mi^de. For he that defends a cause obstinatly (whether yt be true or false)
is ever to be rep^hended. But we do yt to sati^fie our consciences which are
compelled by other placys of scripture / reasons and doctors so to Judge of yt
And evyn so ought you to Judge of your party / and to defend your sentense
not of obstinatie / but by the reason of scriptures which cause you so to take
yt. and so ought nether party to dispyse other / for each sekyth the glory of
god / and the true understanding of the scripture. This was the fondacyon of
my first treatise that he has left vnshakyn / which is agreat argument that
yt is very true For else his pregnant wit could not have passed yt so clean over
But would have assailed yt with some sophistical cavellacyon which by his
painted poetre he might so have collered / that at the l^st he might make the
ignorant some appare^ce of truth / as he has done a gaynste the residewe of
my first treatice / which nevertheless is true and shall so be proved.

And first that yt is none article of our faith necessary to be beleved
under pain of da^pnacyon may thus be further confermed? The same faith shall
save us which saved the old faderes before Christ is incarnacyon But they were
not bound under pain of dampnacyon to beleve this poy^t / therefore yt shall
follow that we are not bound thereto under the pain of da^pnacyon, The furste
part of mine argument is proved by. S. Austen ad Dardamu^. And I dare boldly
^ay almost in an.C places. For I think there be no proposicyo^ wc he does
more oftyn inculcate then this / that the same faith saved us with saved our
faders. The second part is many^est / that yt needs no proba^yon. For how
could they beleve that thing wc was never said nor done / and with out the
word they could have no faith / upon the truth of these too pertyes mus^e
the co^clusio^ needs follow. Not wtstondinge they all did eat Christys body
and drunk his blood spu^ally / allthough they had him not p^sent to there
teth. And by that spu^all eating (wc is the faith in his body and blood) were
saved as well as we are For as soon as our fore father Ada^ hade tra^sgressed
gods precept, Adam.
and was fallen under co^dempnacyo^ / our most merciful father of his
gracyous favor gave him the promise of health and comfort / whereby as many as
beleved yt / were saved from the thrauldo^ of their tra^gressyon / the word
and promise was this / I shall put enmyte between the and the woman / between
thy sede and her sede / that sede shall trede the on^ the head / and thou shall
trede yt on^ the hele. Gene. 3.
In this promise they had knowelege that Christ should become the sede or sone
of a woman / and that he should distroye the d^vyll with all his power / and
d^lyver his faytheful from there sins. And where he said that the devyll
should tread yt on the hele / they understood right well that the devyll should
find the means by his wyles and wicked ministres to put Christ to death. And
they knew that god was true / and would fulfill his promise unto them and
heartily longed after this sede / and so deed both eat his body and drink
his blood / knoweleginge with infinite thanks / that christ should for there
synnys take the perfi^e nature of manhood upon him / and also suffer the
death. This promise was gevyn to Adam / and saved as many as did beleve and
were thankful to God for his kydenes and after yt was establyshed unto our
father Abraham by the word ^f God / which said / in thy sed shall all nacyons
of the earth be blyssed. Abraham ^
Gene. 12.
And with him God made a covenant that he would be his God and do him good. And
Abraham again promised to k^pe his precepts and walk in his ways. Then God
gave him the sacrament of cyrc^^sion and cauled that his covenant which thing
not with stondynge was not the very covenant in deed / although yt were so
cauled. But was only asigne / tokyn / sacrament or memoryall of the covenant
that was between God and him (which might expound our matter / if m^n hadyen
to see. After that God promised him a sone when his wyffe was past child
bearing and he also very old. Nevertheless he doubted not of good^s word.
But suerly beleved that he wc promised yt was able to perform yt. And that was
recounted unto him for ryghtwysnes This Abraham did both eat his body and
dry^ke his blood (thorough faith) belevinge verily that Christ should take
our nature and spring out of his sede (as touching his flesh) and also
that he s^ulde suffer death to redeem us. And as Christ testifyeth he heartily
desired to se the day of Christ. Joan. 8.
And he saw yt and reioysed he saw yt in faith and had the day of christ /
that is to say all those things that should chance him plainly revelated unto
him / albeit he were deed many hundred years before yt were actualy fulfyllyd
and re^elat^d unto the world. And by that faith was he saved / and yet never
did eat his flesh with his teth / nor never beleved that bread should be his
body and wine his blood. And therefore since he was also savyd with out that
faith and the same faith sha^^ save us which saved him I think that we shall
also be saved if we eat him spu^ally (as he ded) although we never beleved
that the bread is his body furthermore that merciful Moses Moses.
which brought the childern of Israel out of Egypt in to the wyldernes
optayned of God by prayers / both mana from hevyn to feed his people and also
water out of the stone to refresh and comfort them. T^^s mana and water were
evyn the same thing unto them that the bread and wine is to us for as S. Austyn
says Quicunque in manna Christum intellexeru^t eundem quem nos cibu^ spiritu
alem manducaueru^t Quicunque aute^ de manna sola^ saturitatem que siuerunt
manducabant and mortui sunt. Aug. de viteagen derum.
Sic etia^ eundem potum: petra enim erat christus. That is to say / as many as
in that ma^na understood Christ / did eat that same spiritual meat that we
do / but as many as sought only to fill there bellyes of that ma^na (the fathers
of the unfaithful) did eat and are ded. And like wise the same drink for the
stone was christ. Here may you gather of S. Austyn that the manna was unto
them. As the bread is to us and likewise that the water was to them as the wine
is to us / which ano^ shall apere more plainly S. Aus^yn says further
manducauit and Moses manna / ma^ducauit and Aaron / manducauit and Phin^es /
manducauerunt ibi multi qui d^o placuerunt and mortui non sunt. Aug. soper
Ioa^^ t^acta. 2^
Qu^re? quia visib^iem cibum spi^itualiter intellexeru^t / spiritual^ter
esur^eru^t / spiritualiter gustaueru^t / vt spiritualiter satiar^nt^r. Omnes
eandem escam spiritualem manducauerunt / and omnes eundem potum spiritualem
biberunt / spiritualem vtique eandem: nam corporalem alteram (quia illi manna /
nos aliud) spiritualem vero ^andem quam nos. Ut omnes eundem potu^ spiritualem
biberunt aliud illi / aliud nos: sed spe^ visibili quod tame^ hoc ide^
significaret virtute spirituali. Quomodo eundem potu^ bibebant (inquit
apostolus) de spirituali seque^ti petra: petra autem erat Christus. This is to
say Moses also deed ^ate ma^na and Aaron and Phinees did eat of yt and many
other did there eat of yt / wc pleassed God and are not deed Wherefore?
Because they understood the visible meat spiritualy. They were spiritualy an
hongred / they tasted yt spiritualy / that they might spiritualy be
replenished. They did all eat the same spiritual meat / and all drank the
same spiritual ^ drink. E^e^ the same spiritual meat albeit an other bodily
meat / for they deed eat manna / and we eat an^ other thing / but they did
eat the sam^ spiritual which we do. And they all did d^ynke the same spu^all
drink. They drank one thing and w^ an other: but that was in the owtward
appearance / which nevertheless did signify the same thing spu^ally. How
drank they the same drink? They (says thapostl^) dra^ke of the spu^all
stone followyng the^ / and that stone was christ And there unto Beda added these
words. Videte autem fide manente signa uariata. That is to say. Behold that
the sygn^s are altered / and yet the faith abides one. Beda ^uper. 1. cor 10.
Of these ^laces you may plainly per^eyve not only that yt is non article
necessary to be beleved under pain of dampnacyon / saying the old faders
never beleved yt. And yet did eat crist in faith both before they had the
ma^na / and more exp^ssely thorough the ma^na and with no less fruit wha^ the
ma^na was ceased. And albeit the ma^na was to the^ as the sacrament is to us /
and they eat evyn the same spu^all meat that we do / yet were they never so
mad as to beleve that the ma^na was changed in to christ's own natural
body. But understood yt spu^aly that as the owtward man^ did eat the
material ma^na wc comforted the body / so did the inward man^ thorough faith
/ eat the body of christ belevinge that as that ma^na came down from hevi^
and comforted there bodies / so should their savyour christ wc was promised
the^ of god the fad come down from hevyn and strength their souls in
everlas^yng lyffe redemynge the^ from there sin by his death and resurrex^cio^.
And like wise do we eat christ in faith both before we come ^o the sacrament
and more expressly thorough the sacrament / and with no less fruit after we have
rec^yved the sacrament and need no more to make yt his natural body / then
the ma^na was / but might much better understood yt spu^alye / that as the
owtward man does eat the materyall bread wc ^o^forteth the body so does the
inward man thorough faith ^ate the body of christ / belevynge that as the
bread is brokyn / so was christ's body broken on the cross for our sins wc
comforts our souls unto lyffe everlasting. And as that faith did save the^
with out belevynge that the ma^na was altered into his body / evyn so does
this faith save us although we beleve not that the substance of bred is turned
into his natural body. For the same faith shall save us wc savid the^. and we
are bound to beleve no more vnd pain of da^pnacyo^ then they were ^ou^de to
beleve. They beleved in god the fader almighty maker of hevyn and yerth / and
all that is in the^. They did beleve that christ was the sone of god. Gene. 1.
They did beleve that he should take our nature of a vyrgyn. Psalm. 1.
Esaias. 7.
Acts. 3.
They beleved that he should suffer the death for our delyuera^ce wc thing was
signified in all the sacrifices / and besides that testified in every prophet /
for there was not one prophet but he spoke of that point. Acts. 2.
Psalm. 1^.
They beleved that his soul should not be left in hell / but that h^ should
arise from death and reign everlasting with his fader And to be short / there is
no point in ou^e creed / but that they beleved yt / as well as we do and
those articles are only necessary unto salvacion For them am I bound to
beleve / and am dampened with ou^e excuse if I beleve the^ not. But the other
points contained in scripture allthough they be undoubted verites / yet may I
be saved with out them. As beyt in case that I never hard of them / or when I
here of them / I can not understand them nor comprehend them / or that I here
them and v^derstond them / and yet by the reason of an other text misconstrn^e
them / as the bohemes do the words of christ in the.6. chapter of Ioan^.
All these I say may be don with out any ieoperdie of dampnacyon. In every text
is but only one verite ^or wc yt was spokyn^ and yet some textes there be wc of
catholic doctors are expounded in.vi. or.vij. sundry fashions. Therefore we
beleve these articles of our creed: in the other is no pare^^ / so that we have
aprobable reason to dissent from them. But now to return to our porpos^e / if
we will examen the auctorytyes of s. Austyn and Beda before alleged / we shall
epsy that beside the probacyon of this foresaid proposicyon / they open the
mystery of all our matter to them that have eyes to see. For. s. Austyn says
that we and y^ old faders do differ as touching the bodily meat for they
eat ma^na / and we bred / but albeit yt varyed in the outeward apperance / yet
nevertheless spn^ally yt did signyfye one thing. For both the manna and bred
do signify christ. And so both they and we do eat one spu^all meat / that
is to say we both eat the thing wc ^ignyfieth and rep^senteth unto us the
very one spu^all meat o^ our fowls wc is christ. And beda does plainly call
both the manna and the bread signs / saying be hold that the signs are
a^tered and yet the faith abides one Now if they be sign^s / tha^ they do
signify and are not the very thing yt sellffe wc they do sygnifye for the
^igne o^ a thing defferenth from the thing yt se^^f wc yt does signify and
rep^sent As the ale poleys not the a^e yt sellfe wc yt does signify or
represen^. Here thou wylt obiecte against me that if this faith be sufficient
what needs the institucyon of a sacrament? I answer that sacraments are
ins^ituted for.iij. causes? The first is assygned of. s. Austyn which faith on
this manner. Aug. contra Fa^^stum Li^ 19. cap. ^^
In nullum aute^ nomen religionis, seu veru^, seu falsum, coagu lari homines
possunt, nisi signaculoru^ seu sacrame^torum visibiliu^ consortio colligantur,
quoru^ sacramentorum uis inenarrabiliter ualet plurimum^ and ideo contempta
sacrilegos facit. Impie quippe conte^nitur sine qua perfici no^ potest pietas.
That is to say men can not be joined in to any kind / of religion whether yt
be true or fa^se except they be knyt in fellowship by some vi^ible tokenes or
sacraments the power of which sacraments is of such efficacite / that can
not be expr^ssed. And therefore yt makyth them that dispice yt to be abhorred /
for yt is wickydnes to despice that thing with out which godliness can not be
brought to passe^ Thus yt aperith that necessite is the first cause. For there
can no co^gregacyo^ be severed out of the multitude of men but they mu^te
needs have a sign token sacrament or comen badge by the wc they may know each
other. And there is no defference between a sign or a badge and a sacrament /
but that the sacrament sygnifyeth an^ holy thing and a sign or a badge does
signy^ie a wordly thing as. Augusti. ad Marcell^n^^^ 2
s. Auste^ ^ayeth / signs when they are referred to holy things are called
sacraments. The second cause of their institucyon is / that they may be a
mean to bring us unto his faith and to enprent yt the deper in us / for yt
does costomably the more move a man to beleve / when he perceyvyth the thing
expressed to diverse senses at once / as by example / if I promise a man to
mete him at a day appointed / he will somewhat trust my word. Notwtstondynge he
trustyth not so much unto yt / as if I did both promise him with my word and
also clape hands with him or hold up my finger / for he counts that this
promiseys strong and more faythefull then is the bare word / because yt moves
mo senses. For the word does but only certify the thing unto a man by the
sense of herynge / but when with my promise immediately after I hold up my finger
/ then do I not only certifye him by the sense of hearing: But also b^ his
sight / he perceyvyth that that fact confyrmeth my word. And in the clapynge
of hands he perceyvyth both by his sight and fealyng (be side the word) that I
will fullfyll my promise. And likewise yt is in this sacrament Christ promised
them / that he would geve his body to be slain for their sins. And for to
establishe the faith of this promise in them / he did institute the sacrament
wc he called his body / to thentent that the very name yt self might put them
in rem^mbra^ce what was meant by yt / he brake the broad before them signifying
unto the^ outwardly / evyn the same thing / that he by his words hade before
protested and evyn as his words hade informed the^ by their hearing / that he
intended so to do so the brekynge of that bread informed their ye sight that he
would fullfyll his promise. Then he did distribute yt among the^ to enprynt
the matter more depely in them / signifinig therbye that evyn as that bread was
devidid among them / so should his body and fruit of his passion be
distributed unto as many as beleved his words. Finaly he caused them ^o eat
yt / that nothing should be lacking to co^fyrme that necessary point of
faith in the^ / signifyinge therbye that as verily as they fellte that bread
wtin them / so sure should they be of his body thorough faith. And that evyn
as that bread does norishe the body so does the faith in his body breaking
norishe the soul unto ever lasting lyffe. This did our merciful savior (wc
knowyth our fraylte and weakness) to establishe and strenghth their faith in
his body breaking and blood shedynge wc is our shoteanker and last refuge with
out wc we should all perish. The th^rd cause the inst^tucyon and profit that
comythe of yt is this. They that have receyved these blessed tidings and word
of health / do love to publishe this felicite unto other men. And to geve
tha^kys before the face of the congregacyo^ unto their bountteons benefactour /
and as much as in them is / to draw all people to the praisinge of God with
them / which thing though yt be partly do^ by the prechynge of gods word
and fructefull exhortacyons / yet does that visible token and sacrament (if a
man understand what is meant therbye) more effectuously work in them both faith
and thankisgeuynge / then does the bare word / but if a man wot not what yt
means / and seeks health in the sacrament and outeward sign / then may he
well be lykened unto a fond fellow / which when he is very dry / and an
honest man show him an alepole and tell him that there is good ale enough /
would goo and suck the ale pole / trusting to get drink out of yt / and so
to quench his thirst. Now a wise man will tell him that he plays the fool
for the ale pole does but signify that there is good ale in the house / where
the alepole stondyth and will tell him that he must goo nere the house / and
there he shall find the drink / and not stond suckynge the alepole in vain.
For yt shall not ease him but rather make him more dry for the ale pole does
signify good ale: yet the ale pole yt sellfe is no good ale / another is there
any good ale in the alepole. And likewise yt is in all sacraments. For if we
vnders^ond not what they mean / and seek health in the outeward sign: then we
suck the alepole and labor in vain. But if we do understand the meaning of
them / than shall we seek what they signifye / and go to the signyficacions and
there shall we find undoubted health. As to our purpose in this sacrament
whereof we speak / we must note what yt signyfyeth / and there shall we find
our redempcyon. It signifies that Christys body was broken upon the cross
to redeem us from the thrauldom of the deuell / and that his blood was shed for
us to wash our sins. Therefore we m^ste ru^ne thider if we will be eased.
For if we think to have our sins forgeuyn / for eating of the sacrament /
or for saying the sacrament onece a day / or for prayinge unto yt: then suerly
we suck the alepole. And of this you may perceive what profyt comyth of these
sacraments the which either have no signyficacyons put unto them or else when
there sygnifycacions ar lost and forgotten. For then no doubt they are not
commended of God / but are rather abhomynable / for when we know not what they
mean / then seek we health in the outward deed / and so are iniuryous unto
Christ and his blood. As by example / the sacrifices of the Iewys were well
allowed and accepted of God as long as they used them aryght and understood by
them the death of Christ / the shedynge of his blood and that holy oblacyon
offered on the cross once for ever. But when they begone to forgett this
significacion and sought there health and rightwisnes in the bodily work and
in the sacrifice ytsellfe / the^ present unto us. And there shall we synde such^
fruitful food as shall never fail us / but comfort our souls in to lyff
everlasting.

Now will I in order answer to master mo^es book and as I find occasion gevyn
me / I shall indevoure my sellfe to supply that thing wc lacked in the first
treatise and I trust I shall sh^we such light that all men whose eyes the
prence of this world has not blinded / shall perceyve the truth of the
scripture and glory of christ. And where as in my first trea^ise the truth
was set forth with all symplicite / and nothing arm^d against the assau^e of
sophesters that have I somewhat redressed in this book and have brought bones
feyt for their teth which if they be to busye / may chance to choke them.

Thus begynnyth the preface of master Mores book.

called bretherner^ our bushoppes were called lords / and had the name geuyn
them by Christ say^ge / Math. xxiij all ye are brethern. And luke the.xxij:
Confyrme they brethe^n. And the name was continued by the aposteles / and is a
name that norysheth love and amite. And very glad I am to here of there gredye
affection in writing out and spredynge a broad the word of god / for by that
I do perceive the prophecy of Amos ^mos 8.
to have place / which says in the person of god I will send ho^ger and
thirst in to the yerth ^ not honger for m^ate nor thirst for drink. But for
^o here the word of god. Now begynyth the kingdom of heuyn to suffer

Now run the pore publicanes which knowelege them sellfys sinners / to the

salvation of all that believe. Roma. ^
And as for the name does nothing offend us / though they call yt heryse a

For saint Paulle / testifyeth that the pharisees and prystes which were

Which youge man I here say has lately more
made diverse other things that yet run in hoker moker so close among the

I answer that surely I can not spynne / and I think noman more hates to be

Wherefore in such thyngys as I am able to do / I shall be deligent as long as
god lendyth me my lyffe. And if ye think I be to busye / you may rid me the
sonner for even as the shepys in the bochers hands ready bound and looks but
even the grace of the bocher when he shall shede his blood: Even so am I bound
at the bushopes pleasures / ever lokynge for the day of my death. In so much
that plain word was sent me / that the chaun^elour of London said yt should
cost me the best blood in my body / which I would gladly were shede to morrow /
if so be / yt might opyn the kings graces eyes.

And verily I marvyll that any thing can rune in hoker moker or be hyde from
you. For sithe you might have such store of copyes / concerning the thing
which I most desired to have been kept secreat / how shu^d you tha^ lake a
copye a those things wc I most would have published? And here of ye may be
sure / I care not though you and al^ the bushoppes with in england look on all
that ever I wrote / but rather would be glade that ye so did. For if there be
any spark of grace in your breasts / I trust yt should be an oc^a^io^
somewhat ^o kyndle yt / that you may consider and know your sell^es / with is the
first point of wysdom

And would God for nys mercy (says M more that sith there can nothing refrain

such as are so far corrupted / as never would be cured of there canker.

It is not possible for him that has his eyes and seth his brother wc lackyth
sight in Ieoperdye of peryshynge at a pery^ous pyt / but that he must com to

the better way / except his heart be ^ankered with the contagion of such

not possible for us which have receyuyd the knowelege of gods word / but
that we most cry and call to other / that they leave the perilous pathys of

And do that only to the lord / that he commands the^ / nether addinge any

But this has been offered you / is offered / and shall be offered? Grant that
the word of God / I mean the text of scripture / may goo a broad in our
ynglyshe tongue / as other nacyons have yt in there tongues / and my brother
Wyllya^ tendale / and I have don / and will promise you to write no more. If
you will not grant this co^dicyon then will we be doing w^yle we have brethe
and show in f^we words that the scripture does in many: and so at the lest
save some.

But a lack this will not be / for as S. Paul says / the contagion of heresye
crepyth on / like a canker. More.
For as the ca^ker corrupts the body forther and forther and torneth the
hole parties in to the same dedly syknes / so does these heresies crepe forth
among good simple souls / till at the last yt be almost past remedy.

This is a uery true saying and makyth well against his owyn purposse / for in
deed this co^tagyon began to spring evyn in. Fryth^
S. Paulles time. In so much that the Galathians were in a manner hole seduced
from his doctrine. An^ he said to the Thessalonians the mystery of iniquite
even now beginnith to work. ^ These. ^
And. S. John testifie^h that there were all ready many antichrists rysyn in
his days. 1. Joan. 4^
And also Paul prophesied what should follow after his time / Acts. xx.
saying: Actuu^ 20
take ye head to your sellffys and to all the flock / over which the holy
ghost has put you overseers / to feed the congrigacion of GOD which he
purchased with his owyn blood. For I know this well / that after my departing
shall enter in grievous wolves among you / which shall not spare the flock.
And even of your s^llffes shall arise men / speaking perverse things / to
draw disciples after them and therefore wache. etce. This canker then began to
sprede in the congrigacyon / and did full sore noy^ the body / in so much
that with in.iiii.C. year there were very many sects scatered in every cost.
Natwithstondinge there were faithful fathers that diligently subdued them with
the sword of Gods word. But suerly syns Siluester Siluest.
received such possess^ons / has the canker so crept in the church / that yt
has almost left never a found member. And as Cistercensis wrytith in
the.viij. bocke / that day that he receiuid reuenuens was a voice herd in the
ayere / cryinge over the court which said / this day is ve^ime shed in to the
church of god. Before that time there was no bishope greadye to take a cure.
For yt was non honor and profit as yt is now / but only a ^^refull charge
which was like to cost him his liffe at one time or other. And therefore no man
would take yt / but he that bare such a love and zele to god and his flock /
that he could be content to shede his blood for them. But after that yt was
made so honorable and profitable / they that were worste both in ler^ynge and
^euynge / most labored for yt. For they that were virtuous would not entangle
them sellffys with the vain pride of this world / and wear.iij. Mat. ^7.
Marc. 15
Crounes of gold / where Christ wear one of thorn. Io^^. 19
And in conclusion yt came so fare / that who so ever would give most money for
yt or best could flater the prince (which he knew well all good men to
abhore) had the prehemine^ce and goote the best bushoprike / and then in sted
of gods word / they publisched there owyn co^mandeme^tes / and made lawys to
have all vnd the^ / and made men believe they could not err what so ever they
did or said and even as in the roumes and stead of Moses / Aaron / Eliazer /
Iosue / Calib / and other faithful folk / came Herod / Annas / Caiphas /
Pilat and Judas / wc put christ to death So now i^ the stead of christ / peter
/ paulle / james and Ihon and the faithful folowers of christ / we have the
pope / cardinallis / archebushoppes / bushoppes / and proud p^lates with their
proctour / the malytious minister of there masters the devil / wc
no^wtsto^dinge tra^sforme the^ selves in to a likeness / as 1 C^r. 11.
though they were the ministers of rightousenes whose end shall be acordi^ge to

certain small membris / wc God of his puyssant power has reserved uncorrupted
and be cause they see that they can not be cankered as there owyn flesheys / for
pure anger they bourne the^ / lest if they continued there might se^me some
deformyte in their own cankered carkase / by the co^paring of these hole
members to there s^^bed body.

Teaches in a few leeues shortly all the poison that wycliff / huskyn /
Tenda^e and Zwyng^ius have taught in all their books before. C^^cerninge the
blessed sacrament of the altar: not only affyrmyng yt to be very bredde still
(as Luther does) but also (as these other beasts do) sa^eth yt is nothing
else. And after the same ser Thomas more says. These dregs has he dronkyn
of Wiclyff / E^olampadius / Tendale / and Zwinglius / and so has he all that
he argues here beside / which.iiij what manner folk they be is metely well
perceived and knowyn / and God has in part / with his open venga^ce declared.

Fryth.
Luther is not the prycke that I ru^ne at / but the scripture of God I do nether
affirm nor deny any thing because Luther so says: but because the scripture
of God does so conclude and determe^ I take not Luther for soche an auctour
that I think he can not err / but I think verily that he both may err and
does err in certain points allthough not in such as concern salua^yon and
dampnacyon / for in these (blessed be God) all these whom ye call heretykys do
agree right well. And likewise I do not allow this thing because Wycly^fe /
Oecolampadius Tendale and Zwinglius so say / but because I see them in that
place more purely expou^de the scripture / and that the process of the text do
thomre favor their sentence.

And where you say that I affirm yt to be bred still as Luther does / the same
I say again / not because Luther so says / but because I can prove my words
true by scripture / reason of nature / and doctors. Paulle calls yt bread
saying: 1 Cor. 10.
the bread wc we break / is yt not the fellowship of the body of christ? For
we though we be many / are yet one body and one bread: as many as are
pertakers of one bread. And again he says / asoftyn as ye eat of this bread
/ or drink of this cup / you shall show the lords death until he come. 1.
Cor. 11.
Also luke caulleth yt bread in the acts saying: Actuu^. 2
they continued in the fellowship of the apostylles and in breakinge of bread /
and in prayer. Luc. 22.
Also Christ caulyd the cup / the fruit of vine saying / I shall not from
hence forth drink of the fruit of the vine / until I drink that new in
the kingdom of my father Furthermore nature does teach you that both the bread
and wine co^tynewe in their nature, For the bread mouleth if yt be kept long
/ ye and wurmes bread in yt. And the poor mouse will run away with yt / and
de^yre no another meat to herdynner / which are evident enough that there
remains bread. Also the wine if yt were reseruyd would wex souer as they
confess them selves / and therefore they housell the lay people but with one
kind only / because the wine can not continue nor be reserved / to have ready
at hand when need were. And surely as if there remained no bread yt could not
mould nor wex full of worms. Even so if there remained no wine / yt could not
wex sower / and therefore yt is but faulse doctrine / that our prelates so long
have puplyshed. Finally that there remaynethe bred might be proved by the
auctorite of many doctors / which caul yt bred and wine / as Christ and his
apostels did. And though some sophysters would wreast their sayings and expound
them after their fantasy / yet shall I allege them one doctor (which was
also pope of Rome) that makyth so plain with us that they shall be compelled
with shame to hold their tongues. For pope Gelasius writes on this manner.
Certe sacramenta que. sumimus corporiset sanguinis ^hristi diuinae ressun^ and
propterea per illa, participes facti sumus diuinae naturae, and tamen non
de^init esse substantia uel panis and uini, sed permanent in suae proprietati
naturae. Et certe imago and similitudo corporis and sanguinis christi in
action misteriorum celebrantur. That is to say / suer^y the sacraments of
the body and blood of Christ / are a godly thing / and therefore thorough
them are we made partakers of the Godly nature / And yet does yt not cease to
be the substance / or nature of bred and wine / but they co^tynewe in the
propertye of there owyn nature. And suerly the Image and similitude of the body
of blood and christ are celebrated in the act of the mysteries? This I am
sure was the old doctrine which they can not avoid. And therefore with the
scripture / nature / and fathers / I will conclude that there remains the
substance and nature of bread and wine.

And where ye say that we affirm yt to be nothing else I dare say that ye
untruly report on us all. More.
And here after I will show you what yt is more th^n bread. And where ye say
that yt is metely well knowyn what manner of folk they be / and that GOD has
in part with his open vengeance declared.

I answer that master Wycleff Wicliffe.
was noted while he was living / to be a man not only of most famous doctrine
/ but also of a very sencere lyff and conuersacyon. Nevertheless to declare
your malicyous minds and vengeable hearts (as men say).xv. year after he was
buried / you took him up and brunt him / which fact declared your furye /
allthough he fe^te no fire Math. 1^
but blessed be GOD which has g^uyn such tyrants no further power / but
over this corruptible body. For the soul ye can not bind nor burn / but God
may bless where you curse / and curse where you bliss. Mala. ^^


And as for Oecolampadius Ecolampadius.
/ whom you also call huskyn / his mos^e adversaries have ever commended his
conversation / and Godly lyff / which when God had appoy^ted his time / gave
place unto mature (as every man must) and died of a canker.

And Tyndale Tindale
I trust leuyth / well content with such a poor apostylis lyffe / as god
gave his sone christ / and his faithful ministers in this world wc is not
sure of so many mi^es / as ye be yerly of pou^des / allthough I am sure that
for his learning and Judgment in scripture / he were more worthy to be
promo^ed / then all the bus^oppes in england. I receyuyd a le^ter from him ^ wc
was wrytyn sy^s ^rystmas wherein among other matters he wrytyth thus. I call
God to record against the day we shall apere before our lord Jesus to give a
reconynge of our doings / that I never altered one syllable of gods word /
against my conscience nor would do this day ^ if all that is in yerth ^
whether yt be honor / pleasure or rychis / might be geuyn me Moreover I take
God to record to my conscience that I desire of God to my sellf in this world
no more ^hen that with out wc I can not keep his law^s etc, Judge Christen
reader whether these words be not spoken of a faithful / ^lere innocent heart.
And as for his behauyour is such that I am sure no man can reprove him of /
any sin ^ howbe yt no man is innocent before god which beholds the heart.

Zw^nglius.
Finallye Zwinglius was a man of such lernyng and grauite (beside eloquence)
that I think / noman in christindom might have compared with him not
withstondynge he was slain in battle in defending his city / and come^
wealth against the assaute of wicked enemies / wc cause was most ryghtwyse.
And if his mastership mean that / that was the vengeaunc^ of God / and
declared him to be an evil parson because he was slain. I may say nay / and
show evident examples of the contrary / for sometime god gevyth the victory
against them that have most rygtuouse cause / as yt is evyde^t in the book of
Iudicu^ Iudicum 20.
/ wh^r all the chyldern of ysraell were gathered to gether to punyshe the
shamfull zodomitrye of the trybe of b^niamyn / which were in nombre but.2^^
thousand And the Israel^^tes were.cccc. thousand fygtinig men / wc came in to
Silo / and asked of god who should be there captaigne against beniamyn. And they
being but xxv: thousand slew of the other Israelites.12, thousand in one day:
Then fled the chyldern of Isarell unto the lord in Silo and made great
lamentacyon before him evyn until night And asked him counsel saying: shall
we goo any more to fight against the trybe of beniami^ our^ brethern or not?
God said unto the^ yes / goo up and fight against the^. Then went they the
next day and faught against them / and there were slain again of the
Israelites.18. thousand men: Then came they back again unto the house of god
/ and sat^ down and wept before the lord and fasted that day until evyn and
asked him again / whether they should any more fight against their brethern or
not. God said unto the^ yes ^ to morrow I will deliver the^ in to your hands.
And the n^xt day was the trybe of benjamin utterly distroyed / saving.600. men
which hyd them selves in the wilderness. Here yt is evydent that the chylderne
of Israel lost the victory twice and yet not with sonding had a iu^^e cause
/ and faught at gods commandment. Besides that / Judas machabeus / was
slain / in a ryghtwyse cause / as yt is manifest in the first book of the
Machab^es 1. Machabeorum. ^
And therefore yt can be no euydent argument of the veng^aunce of GOD / that he
was slain in ba^ayle in a ryghtwise cause / and therefore me thinks that this
man is to malaparte so bluntly to enter in to Gods Iudg^ment / and give
sentence in that matter before he be caulled to counsel. Thus ^aue I
sufficiently touched his preface / for those points that ^e afterward touched
more larg^ly / have I wyllyngly passed be cause I shall touch them ^rnestly
here after. Now let us se what he proves.

Master More
It is a great wonder to see upon how light and slight occasions / he is
fallen unto these abhomynable heresyes^ ^or he de^yeth not nor can not say nay ^
but that our savior said him self my flesh is verily mea^e and my blood is
verily ^rynke / he denies not also that Christ him sellfe at his last souper
/ ta^ynge the br^de in to his blessed hands / after that he had blessed yt
said unto h^s disciples^ Take you this and eat yt / this is my body ^ that
shall be geuyn for you. And likewise gave them the chalece after his blessyng and
consecracyon / and said unto them / this is the chalice of my blood of the new
testament / which shall be shed out for many / do ye this in remembrance of me.

Frith
It is a great wounder to see how ygnoraunt their proctour is / in the plain
textes of scripture. For if he had any Judgment at all he might well perceive
that when Christ spoke these words / my flesh is verily meat and my blood
is verily drink / he spoke nothing of the sacrament. For yt was not institute
until his last souper. And these words were spokyn to the Iewys long before
/ and me^t the^ not of the carnal eating or drinking of his body or blood
/ but of the spiritual ^atynge / which is done by faith and not with tothe /
or / bellye. Where of Saint Austyn says upon this gospel of John^ whi
preparest thou other tothe or bellye^ believe and thou haste eatyn him. So that
chrystys words mu^t here be understand spiritualy. And that he cauleth his
flesh very meat because that as meat by the eating of yt and disgestyng yt in
our body does strengthen these corruptyble members / so likewise does christ's
f^eshe by the bel^uynge that yt takes our sin upon yt self and suffered
the does to deliver us and strengthen our immortal soul. And likewise as
drink when yt is dronkyn / does comfort and quickyn our fray^e nature / So
likewise does Christ's blood by the drynkinge of yt in to the bouwells of our
so^le that is by the beleuyng and rem^mbryng that yt is shed ^or our sins /
comfort and quicken our soul unto everlasting lyffe. And this is the eating
and drynkyng that he speakyth of in that place. And that yt is so you may
perceive by the text followyng which says / he that eatyth my body and
drynketh my blood dwellyth in me and I in him / which is not possible to be
vnders^onden of the sacrament For it is fals^ to say that he that eats the
sacrament of his body and drynketh the sacrament of his blood / dwells in
christ and christ^ in him. For some man rec^yueth yt unto his condempnacion /
And thus does S. Austen expound yt saying^, Hoc est enim Christum manducare, in
illo manner, and illum manentem inse^a^ere. This is the very eatinge of Christ
to dwell in him and to have him dwelling in us / So that who so ever dwellith
in Christ (that is to say believes that he is sent of God to save us from our
sins) does verily eat and drink his body and blood although he never
received the sacrament. This is the spu^all ^a^ing necessary for all that
shall be saved for there is no man that ^^mith to God wto^te this eating of
Christ / that is the b^leuing in him. And so I deney ^ot but that Christ
speaks these word^s but surely he meant spiritually ^ as. s. Austen declares
/ and as the place plainly proves.

Math. 26
And as touching the other word^s that Christ spoke unto his disciples at the
last souper / I deney not but that he said so but that he so flesly meant as ye
falsely feign / I vtterley deney. For I say that his words were then also
sprite and liff / and were spiritually^ to be vndersto^den / and that he called
yt his body. Joan. 6. Joan. 15.
For a certain propartie / even as he c^lled him self a v^ry vine / and his
disciples very vine branches / and Joan. 10.
as he called him sellffe a doremot that he was so in deed ^ but for certain
propert^es ^n the s^militudes / as a man for some property says of his
ne^g^bours horse / this horse is mine up and down / meaning that yt is in
every thing so like. Gene. 35. Gene. 32.
And like as Ia^ob builded an^ altar and caulled yt the God of Israel / and
as Jacob called the place where he wrasteled with the angel / the face of god /
and as the pascal la^be was caulled the passing bye of the lord. Ezeche. 5.
And as a brokyn potsherd was caulled Jerusalem not for that they were so in
deed / but for certain similitudes in the properties / and that the very name
yt sel^fe might put men in remembrance what is m^nt by the thing / as I
suffeciently declared in my fi^ste treatise.

He must needs confess / that they ^ha^ believe More
that yt is the very body and his very blood in deed / have the plain words
of our savior him sellfe upon there side for the ground and foundac^on of
there faith.

That is very true and so have they the very F^yth.
words of god / which say a broken pottsherd is Jerusalem / and that Christ
is a stone / and that Christ is a vine and a door. And yett yff they should
believe or think^ that he were in deed any of thesse thing^s / they were
nevertheless deceived. For though he so said / yet I say his words were
spiritual and spiritually to be understood

And were you say that I fly from the faith More
of plain and open scriptures / and for the allygorie destroy the true sense
of the letter.

I answer that some textes of scripture are only to be vnderstonden after the
letter: Fryth
As when Paulle says / Christ died for our sins and arose again for our
justification. Roma. 4.
And some textes are only to be understand spu^ally or in the way of an
allegorye: Corin. x.
As when Paul says / Christ was the stone / and when Christ says Ioh. x^.
John ^.
him sellfe / I am a very vine I am the door / and some must be understand
both literalye / and spiritualie: As when God said / out of egipte called I my
son / which allthough it were literalye Ozee. 11^
fulfillyd in the childern of Israel when he brought them out of Egipte with
great power and wonders ^ yet was yt also meant and verified in Christ
hymsellfe / his very spiritual son / which was caulled out of Egypt after
the death of Herod. Math. ^^
And again yt is very spu^ally fulfi^l^d in us which thorou Christ's blood
are delivered from the Egypt of sin / and from the power of P^arro the
devil, An^ I say that this text of scripture? This is my body / is only
spu^ally to be vnderstonde^ ^ and not lit^eralie And that does S. Austen also
confirm / wc writes unto adamantus and sayth^ These sentenses of scripture /
christ was the ^^one / The blood is the soul / and this is my bodie^ are
figuratiuelie to be vndersto^den (that is to say spu^ally or by the way of an
allegory) and thus have I S. Austen wholly on my side / which thing shall
yet here after more plainly apere.

More
Now his example of his bridgromes ring I very well a low / for I take the
blessed sacrament to be left with us for a very toke^ and a memorial of christ
in deed. But I say that the hole substance of the same toke^ and memorial / is
his owyn blessed body. And so I say that christ has left us a better
tokyn then this man would have us take yt for. And therein he fares like a man
/ to who^ a bridgrome had delivered a goodlye gold ringe with a rich rubie
therein / to deliver to his bryde for a token. And then he would like a faulse
shrewe / keep away that gold ring / and give the bride instead thereof / a
proper ringe of a rishe / and tell her that the bridgro^ would send her no
better. Or else like one that when the bridgrom hade geuyn soche a ring of gold
to his bride for a token / will tell her plain / and make her believe that the
ringe were but coper or brass / to minishe the bridgromes thank.

I am right glad that ye admit teth mine example Fryth
/ and grant that the sacrament is left to be a very token and a memorial of
Christ in deed. But where you say / that the hole substance of the sam^ token
and memoryall is his owyn blessed body / that is sooner said than proved. For
Saint Austen shewyth the contrary / as yt is partelye before touched / and here
after shall be d^clared more plainly. And where you say that we fare like a
faulse shrew that would keep the gold ringe from the bride / and give her a
ringe of a rishe / or tell her that her gold ringe were coper or brass / to
minishe the bridgromes thank. I answer that we deny not but that the ringe is
most fine gold / and is set wi^h as rich Rubyes as can be gotton. For that
ringe (I mean the sacrament) is not onl^ a most parfayte tokyn and a
memoryall of they brydgromes benefytes and unfeigned favor on his party but yt
is also on the other party eucharistye: Eucharistia.
that is to say / a thanks geuynge / for the gracyous gifts which she
undoubtedly knowelegeth her sellf to have received. For as verily as that bred
is broken among them / so verily was Christ's body brokyn for there sins.
And as ver^ly as they receive that bread in to there bellye thorough eatinge yt
so vere^ye do they receive the fruit of his death in to there soulys by beleuinge
in him And therefore they assem^le to that so^per / not for the valor of the
bred ^ wine or meat that is there eatin but for thentent to give / him thanks
commenlye among them all / for his i^est^mab^e goodness. But to proceed unto
our purposse yt a man would come unto the bryde / and tell her that t^is
goodly gold ringe were her owyn brydgrome / both flesh blood and bones (as
you do) then I thy^ke if she have any wit / she might answer him / that he
mocked and the more he said yt the less she might be^eue him ^ and say that
if that were her owyn brydgro^e / what should she then need any remembrance of
him or why should he give yt her for a remembra^^e? For a remembrance
p^suposeth the thing to be abse^t / and therefore if this be a remembrance of
him / t^an can he no^ here be present. ^ore


I meruell me therefore much / that he is not aferde to affirm that these
words of Christ / of his body and of his blood must needs be understand by
way of a similitude or an allegorye as the words be of the vine and the
door. Now this he wottes well / that though some word^s spokyn by the mouth
of Christ ^e to be vnderstonden only by way of a similitude or an allegorye /
yet followyth yt not there upon / that every l^ke word of christ in other
places was non other but an allegory / for such was the shyfte and
cauillacion that the wicked arrians used wc took from Christ's parson his
omnipotent godhed.

I grant that the Arrians erred / for as master Frith
More says / though in some place a word be taken figuratife^y / yt followyth
not therefore in every other place / yt should likewise be taken But one
questyon must ^ ask his mastership how does he know that there is any word
or text in scripture that must be taken figuratuely / that is by the way of a
similitude or as he cauleth yt a necessary allegory? I think (though some
men may assygne other good causes and evidences) that the first knowelege is by
other textes of scr^pture. For if other textes be conferred unto yt ^ and will
not stand with the literal sense / then I think yt must needs be taken
spiritua^l^ or figuratiuelie as there are infinite textes in scripture. Now when
I see that S. Thomas with felt Christ his wondes and put his finger in his side
/ called him his lord and god / and that no t^xt in scripture repungneth unto
the same / but that they may well ^tond to gether me thinks yt were folly to
affirm that this word / god / in that text should be taken figuratively or by
way of an allegorye: But now in our matter the process of scripture will not
s^onde with the li^terall sense / as shall here after apere / And therefore
necessite co^pell^the us to expound yt figuratiuelye / as does also. S.
Austen and other holy doctors / as here after shall plainly apere.

If every man that can find out^ a new fond More.
phantas^e upon a text of holy scripture / may have his owyn mind taken / and
his owyn exposicio^ believed agaynst^ the expos^cio^s of the old coninge doctors
and saints / then may you surely see that non article of the christen faith /
can sto^de and endure long. And then he allegith. s. Hierom wc says / that
if the e^posi^^o^ of other interpretours / and the consent of the common
catholic church / were of no more strength / but that every man might be
beleu^d that could b^inge some textes of scripture / for him expounded as yt
pleassed him self / then could I (sayt^e this holy man) bring up a new sect
also / and say by scripture ^ that no man were a true Christen man nor a
m^mbr^ of the church ^ that keeps two cotes. And in good fayt^ (says master
More) ^f that wa^e were ^ow^d / I were able my s^llfe to find out fyftene
new sects in one fore none.

(...)
Sayncte Peter says that the scripture is not expounded after the appetyte of
any private person / but ^uyn as yt was geuyn / by the sprite of god and no^ by
man's will / So m^ste yt be declared by the same spryte. And therefore I will
not that any man s^albe believed / by bringinge his owyn mind and fantasy.
But if he will be believed / let him bring either an other plain text /
which shall expound the first / or else at the least he must bring such a
sentense / as will stand with the process of the scripture. Why was Saynct
Hierom alow^d against the determ^nacyon of the counsel of meldelcy / sith he
was alone / and they a great multitude^ but only be cause he brought euydent
scripture / which at the time of their sentense / non of them remembered: and
yet when yt was brought / they could not avoid yt. And likewise except I
bring euydent scripture which they all shall expound as I do / I desire not
to be believed. And where master More says / that in good faith he were able
to ^ynde out fyftene new sects in one sore none / he may thank GOD that he
has such a preng^ant wit: But yet I trust he should not find one (if
there were any par^ll of dampnacyon therein) but that we would with a plain
text confute yt / which he should not be able to avoid.

And over this the very circumstances of More
the places in the gospel in which our savior speaks of that sacrament /
may well make open the defference of his speech in this matter and of all those
other / and that as he spoke all those but in an allegorye / so spoke he ^^ys
plainly meaning that he spoke of his very body and his very blood / beside
all all^goryes. For when our lord said / he was a very vine / nor when he said
he was the door / there was non that hard him / that any thing meruelyd
thereof. And why? For be cause they perceived well / that he meant not that he
was a materyall vine in deed / nor a door nether: But when he said that his
flesh was very meat / and his blood very drink / and that they should not be
saved / but if they did eat his flesh and drink his blood / then were they
all in such a wonder thereof / that they could not they could not abide. And
wh^rfore / but because they perceived well by his words and his manner of
cir^unstaunces / that C^riste spoke of his very fles^e and his very blood in
deed?

Frit^
It is openly known and confessed among all learned men that in the.6. chapitre
of Ioa^ Joan. 6.
/ christ spoke not one word concerning the sacracrame^t of his body and
blood (wc at that time was not yet institute) but all that he there spoke was
of the sp^^all eatinge and drinking of his bote / and blood / in to our
soule^ wc is the fayt^e in h^s body / and blood / as I have touched before.
And the cy^cunstances of this place do ^n deed prove that they were fleshly
minded / and vndersto^e not the spiritual words of our savior Christ / and
thefore wondered and murmered In somoch that Christ said unto the^ / does this
o^fende ^o^? What w^l^ ye say then when ye shall see the sone of man ascendynge
thither where he was before? Then (adds S. Austen) you s^all know that he
meant not to give his flesh to eat with your teth: for he shall ascend hoole.
And Christ adds ^ yt is the spirete that quickneth the flesh profits
not^^nge / the word / that I speak^ / are spiret and list: that is to say /
says S. Austyn / are spu^aly to be understand. And where Christ says ^ that
the flesh profits nothing (meaning of his own flesh / as S Austen says)
he m^aneth that yt profit^th not as they understood him that is to say / yt
profits not / if ^t were eaten, But yt does much profit to be slain / that
thorough yt and the shedi^ge of his blood / the w^athe of god our father is
pacified / and our synn^s for given. And where his mastership says / that the
people percey^ed well what he meant / and therefore wo^d^red so sore and cou^de
not abide / be cause they perceived well by his words and manner of
circunsta^ces what his meaning wa^. I will say as I did before / that they
vnd^rs^ode him not. Fowe here he will say unto me / if yt be but your nay and
my ye / then I would think to be believed as so^e as you / and surely that
were but reason. ^ot wtstondyng (tha^k^s be to god) I am able to bring in
auctorite to Judge b^twene us both whose Judgment I trust his mastership
will admyt. Augusti. in sermo. ad infan.
This auctor is. S. Aus^yn wc says. Dis^ipuli en^^ eius qui eum sequebantur
expauerunt and exhorruerunt sermone^ no^ intellegentes. That is to say his
disciples wc ^ol^owed him / were a stoyned / and abhorred his words and
understood them not. And be cause your mas^ershipe shall ^ot think that he
over schott him sel^fe / and spoke he wist not what we shall aliege him saytnge
the same words in an other place^ Augu. ^^
Cum diceret. Nisi quis manducauerit carnem. etc. Illi non intellegentes
dixerunt ad inuicem. Durus est hic sermo, quis potest eum audire? That is when
christ said / except a man eat my flesh and drink my blood ^ he shall have
no lyff in him / they be^aus^ they v^derstode him not / said to each other
this is an hard saying / who can hear him? Thus I trust^ you will give place
(allthough not to me) yet at the lest unto. S. Austen / and recey^e the truth
wc is so plainly proved.

And where his mastership alleget^ this text for the sacrament / that except
they did eat his flesh and drink his blood they could not be saved yt
seems that he is fallen in to the error of pope innocent ^ which like wise
understanding this text upon the sacrament (as master More does) caused yo^ge
chyldern and infantes to receive the sacrament ^ as though they had all by a
dampened wc died and had not received yt. And of this carnal mind were many mo
Bushoppes a great while (as are now the bohemes ^ whom he after disprayseth^
and yet expounds the text as they doo^ but afterward they looked more spu^ally
upon the matter and confessed there ignorance (as I trust master more will)
but now will I show you. s. Auste^s mind upon this text wc shall h^lpe for
the exposicio^ of all this matter s. Auste^ in the third book de doctrina
christiana the.16. chapitre teachi^ge how we shall know the tropes figures /
allegories and phrases of the scripture says. Augustinus libro 3. de doctrina
Chris^i^^a.
Si au^t flagitiu^ aut facinus iubere uidet, figurata locutio est. Nisi
ma^ducaueritis ( inqt) carne^ fili^ hoi^s et biberitis eius sanguine^, no^
habebitis uita^ i^ uobis, ^acinusuel flagitiu^ uidetur iubere^ Figura est ergo
precipie^s passio^is dn^icae esse co^icandu^ et suauiter atque utiliter in
memoria recondendu^, quoth pro nobis caro eius c^ucifixa and uulnerata sit. That
is to say when so ever the scripture or Christ / seems to command any foul
or wicked thing / than must that text be taken figuratiuelye (that is yt is a
phrase / allegory / and manner of speaking / and must be understood spu^ally
and not after the letter). Except (says christ) ye eat the flesh of the
son of man and drink his blood ye shall have no lyffe in you. He ^eamethe
(says S. Austen) to command a foul and a wicked thing. It is therefore a
figure / commau^ding us to be partakers of his passion / and swe^ly and
profitablye to prent in our mind that his flesh was crucified and wonded for
us. This truth thanks be to god / does S. Austen declare unto us / wc thing
beside the openi^ge of this text against master mores mind / does plainly
show what he thought in the wo^des of christ's souper. For sith he cau^ed yt a
sow^e and a wicked thing / to eat his flesh / than may you sone perceive /
that he thought yt as sowie and as wicked a thing / to eat his body / saying
his body is flesh and then co^s^quently yt shall follow / that either this
word ^a^e (where Christ said take this and eat yt) must be takyn spu^ally /
or else that this sayng of christ / this is my body / must be figuratively
spoken / but this word eat is taken after the lett^r (^or they did in deed
eat the bred) therefore yt must needs follow / that this sentence (this is my
^odie) must be figuratively spoken, Or else is. s. Austen not to be approved in
this place / with thing our bushoppes I think / will not say nay.

Besides that^ s. Austen says. Augustinus i^ sermon ad infantes.
Qua^do loquebatur dn^s noster Jesus Christus de corpore suo, nisi ( inqt) qs
ma^ducauerit carne^ m^a^ et biberit sangui ne^ meu^, non habe^it in seuita^.
Caro em^ mea uere est cibus, and sanguis meus uere est potus, intellectus
spiritualis credentem ^aluu^ faci^, quia littera occidit spu^s est q uiuificat.
That is to say, when our lord Jesus Christ spoke of his body / except (quod
he) a man eat my flesh and drink my blood / he shall have no lyff in him
sellf / for my flesh is very meat / and my blood is very drink The
spiritual understanding saves him that beleue^h / for the letter ky^^^h / but
the spir^te quy^keneth. Here may you playnlie perceive / that this text must
only be taken spirituallie. For he says / that to take yt after the letter /
yt kills and profits nothing at all and therefore I wonder that we have been
led so long in this gross error.

Origi. ^n l. ^1 ho. 7
This saying does that famous clark Origin / confirm sayng. Agnosce quod
figurae sunt quae in uolumi^ibus Domini scriptae sunt: and ideo tanq
spirituales and non tanq carnales, examinate and intel^^gite quae dicuntur. Si
enim secundum literam seq^atis hoc ipsum quod dictum est, Nisi manduc m^ritis
carnem etc. occidi^ h^^c li^era. That is to say Mark that they are figures wc
are written in t^^ scripture of god. And th^rfore examine the^ as sp^rituall m^n
and not as carnal / and vnd^rstond those things that are spoken. For if thou
follow after the letter this thing that is spoken: except ye eat the fl^she
o^ the sone of man and drink his blood / you can have no liffe in in you /
this le^t^r kills. Alas dear brethern why should a^y m^n be offended with
this doctrine sith yt is ^proued so playnlie / by such aun^ient and ho^ie
fa^hers?

Augusti. sermo. ^ir (...) sacrafe riapasche
Again. S Austen says. Qui manducat carnem meam and bibit meum sanguinem in
me manet and ego in illo, Hoc est ergo ma^ducare illa^ es^ am and illum bibere
potum, in Christo manner and illum manentem in se habere, ac per hoc qui no^
manet in Christo and in quo non manet Christus procu^dubio non manducat eius
carnem nec bibit sanguine^, etia^ si tantae rei sacramentu^ ad iudicium sibi
manduce^ and bibit^ That is to say / he that eats my flesh and drinks my
blood / abides in me / and I in him. This is therefore the eatinge of that
meat and drinkinge of that blood / to abide in christ and have him abiding in
us. And therefore he that abides not in Christ / and in whom Christ abides not
/ with out doubt he eats not his flesh nor drinks not h^s blood / although
he eat and drink the sacrament of so great a thing unto his da^pnacion. And
even the same words has bid upon the Corinthians. 1. Corin 10. Idem B^da
super^ Cor. 10.
This one place is sufficient for to prove mi purposse though he said not one
word more For here he does plainly determine / that he wc abides not in
Christ: that is to say: he that is wicked or unfaithful / does not eat his
flesh nor drink his blood / although he eat and drink the sacrament of so
great a thing. And so must yt needs follow / that the sacrament yt not the
very natural body of christ. For then the unfaithful should eat his flesh
/ seeing he eats the sacrament of his body. But that does s. Auste^ deney /
wherefore yt must needs follow / that yt is but only a token of a remembrance
/ and a sign of his body breakinge / and a representacio^ of his passion /
that we might keep his ^acte in memor^e / Ro^a. ^.
and give him thanks for his tender love and kindenes / with when we were his
ennemies took upon him to suffer most vile death / to reconcile us unto his
father / and make us his friends. This sainge has s. Austen in a another place
also where he wry^eth on this manner. Augusti de ciuita: ^ei. lib. 21 ^api. 25.
Qui non in me manet, and in quo ego no^ maneo, no^ se dicat aut existimet
ma^ducare corpus meu^, aut bibere sanguinem meu^. Non itaque mane^t in Christo
qui non sunt eiu^ membra: no^ sunt a^^t membra Christi qui se faciu^t membra
meritricis. That is to say / he that bydeth not in me. And in whom I abide not
/ let hi^ not say or think that he eats mi body or dri^keth mi blood?
They abide not in Christ wc are not his members. And they are not his me^bres
wc make the^ selves the members of an harlete. And these are also the very
words of Bid. Beda su^. 1. cor. 6.
Here is yt plain proved again by the auctorite of s. Austen and Bid / that
the wicked and unfaithful (wc are not the members of Christ) do not eat his
body nor drink his blo^de / and yet they do eat the sacrament as well as the
other. Wherefore you must needs / grant that the sacrament is not the natural
body of christ but a figure / toke^ or memorial thereof. Now good christian
people count not this new lerninge wc is firmed by such old doctors and
faithful fathers

Now were this enough for a Christen man that loved no co^tencyon. But because
there are so many sophisters i^ the world wc care not what they say / so they
hold not there peace. I must needs set some bulwark by this holy doctoure to
help to defend him / for else they will shortly over ru^ne him (as they do me)
and make him an here^yck to. Therefore I will allege his master s. Ambrose.
Ambrosi. ^^ sacra.
Saint Ambrose says. No^ iste panis q uadit in corpus, a nobis ^am anxie
queritu^ sed panis uitae aeternaeq ai^ae nr^ae substa^cia^ fulscit, q au^t
discordat a christo no^ manducat carne^ eius, nec bibit sanguine^ eius, and si
ta^tae rei sacrame^tu^ iudiciu^ sue perditionis accipit. That is / this bred
that goth in to the body is not so gredelye sought of us / but the bread of
everlasting liffe wc vpholdeth the substance of our soul. For he that
discordeth from Christ / does not eat his flesh / nor drink his blood /
allthough he receive / the sacrament of so great a thing unto his dampnacyon
and distructyon. Forthermore the great clarke prosper co^fyrmeth the same
saying. prosper. in libro se^tentiaru^.
Qui discordat a Christo nec carne^ Christi manducat, nec sanguine^ bibit,
etia^ si tantae rei sacramentu^ ad iudiciu^ suae praesumptio^is quotidie
indiffere^ter accipiat That is / he that discordeth from Christ does nether
eat his flesh nor drink his blood / allthough he receive indifferently
every day the sacrament of so great a thing unto the co^dempnation of his
p^sumption. Idem B^da super^ Cor. 11.
And these are also the very words of bid upon the.xi. Chapter of the
first pystyll to the Corinthians

Now you may see / that yt is not Saynct Austens mind only / But also the
saying of many mo. And therefore I trust you will be good unto him. And if ye
condemn not these holy fathers / then am I wrongfullye punished. But if you
condemn them / then must porefryth be content to bear the burden with them.

The mind and exposicyon of the old Doctors upon the words of Christ's
maundey.
More.
ANd where Master More says / that if Christ had not meant after the plain
literal sense / that both the hearers at that time / and the expositors syns /
and all Christen people beside this xv.c. year would not have taken only the
leterall sens being so strange and meru^lous that yt might seame impossible /
and decline from the letter for allegories in all such other things being
(as he says) and as in deed they be / so many far in noumbre moo.

Fryth.
As touching the hearers they were deceived and understood him not (I mean as
many as took his words fleslye as you do) And they had there answer of Christ
(when they murmured) that his words were sprite and lyffe: that is (as. S.
Austen says) spiritually to be understand and not fleslye / as is before
declared. And as for the expos^tours. I think he has not one of the old
fathers for him / but certain new fellowys: as Dominic. s. Thomas / O^^am / and
such other wc have made the pope a God. And as I have showed. s. Austen makes
full for us / and so do all the old fathers / as Oecolampadius has well
declared in his ^oke, q^id ue^eres senserint de sacramento eucharristiae. And
some of their sayings I shall allege anon. And where you say that all christen
people have so believed this.1500. years / that is very faulse. For there is no
doubt / but that the people thought as holy Saint austen and other faith full
fathers taught them. Which as I said / make with us. Not with stondynge in deed
/ since our prelates have been made lords and have set up their laws and
decres contrary to the prerogatyue of all princes / and like most sot^e
traitors / have made all men believe that they may make laws and bind men's
conscyences / to obey them: and that their laws are godds laws blyndinge the
peoples yen with too or.3. textes wrongfullye wrested / to ava^ce their pride /
where they ought to obey kings and princes / and be subject to there laws /
as christ and his aposteles were even unto the death. Since that time I say they
have made me^ believe what they list and made articles of the faith at their
pleasure One article must be that they be the church / and can not err: And
this is the ground of all their doctrine But the truth of this article is
now suffecie^tly known. For if queen katerine be king he^ries wyffe / the^
they do err / and if she be not / the^ they have erred / to speak no more
cruel lie: It is now be come an article of our faith that the pope of Rome
must be the head of the church and the vicar of christ: and that by gods
law. yt is an article of our faith that what so ever he byndeth in yerth / is
bound in heui^ / in so much that if he cu^^e wrongfullye / yet ye must be
feared and infinite such other wc are not i^ our creed but blessed be god that
has given some light in to our princes heart, For he has late^^e putforth a
book called the glass of troth wc proves many of these articles very folishe
pha^ta^ies and that even by their owin doctors / and so I trust you sha^be
proved i^ this poi^t of the sacrament for though it be an article of our faith
/ yt is no^ article of our creed in the.xij. articles whereof are sufficient for
our salvation. And therefore we may think that you lie with out all Ieoperdye of
dampnacyon.

Nevertheless saying his mastership says that all make for him / and I say
clean contrary / that all the old fathers make against him / or at the lest
wise not with him / It were necessary that one of us should prove his purpo^se.
But in ded^ in this point he would look to have the v^^tayge of me. For he
thinks that men will sooner believe him wc is a great man / then me wc am but a
poor man / and that therefore I had more need to prove my part true / then he
to prove his. Well I am content and therefore give ear dear reader and Judge
between us.

First I will begin with Tertulian / because he is of most antiqu^te^
tertulianus libro 2. contra marcione^
Tertullian says. Ipse (Christus) nec pane^ repro^auit quoth ipsum corpus suu^
representat. That is to say. Christ him sellfe did not reprove or disco^mende
bred with does rep^sent his very body. For the understanding of this place / you
must know that there was an heretic caulled marcion / wc did reprove
creatures and said that all manner of creatures were euel^ This thing does
Tertullyan improve by the sacrament and says. Christ did not reprove or
discomende bred the which does represent his body: as though he should say
/ if christ had counted the breed evil / then would he not have left yt for a
sacrament to represent his body meaning that yt is a sacrament / sign /
token and memorial of his body / and not the body yt sellf. And that this is
his mind / does plainly apere in his fourth book / where he says / Christus
acceptu^ pane^ et distributu^ discipulis, Tertulianus libr^ 4. contra marcione^
corpus suu^ illud fecit: hoc e^t corpus meu^ dice^do, id est figura corpis mei
Figura au^t no^fuisset, nisi veritatis esset corpus. Ceteru vacua res qdest
pha^tasma, figura^ capere no^ posset That is to say / christ taking bread and
distrybutynge unto his disciples made it his body / sayng this is my body:
that is to say / a figure of mi body but this breed could not have ^yn a
figure of yt / except christ had had a true body For a uayne thing or a
pha^tasye ca^ take no figure. For the understanding of this place / you must
mark that this heretycke marcion against who^ this auctour writes / did hold
opinyon that christ had no natural body / but only a pha^tasticall body and
this opinion does this doctor improve by the sacrament of the altar saying:
the sacrament is a figure of his body: ergo Christ had a true body / and not
a fantastical body: For a uaine thing or pha^^asie ca^ take no figure. Loo
/ here does this old father wc was long be fore s. au^te^: or s. hierome /
expou^de these words of christ This is mi body: that is to say / a figure of
mi body therefore ye are to bla^e to call it new leri^ge / Now be cause they
shall not of tem^rarious p^sumpcyon reiect^ this old father / I shall
establyshe his words by s. Austen wc comendeth Christ's marvelous paci^nce for
suffering so long that trai^our Judas / as though he had been a good man / and
yet was not ignorant of his wicked thoughts. Augusti^ in prefa. Psalm. ^
Adhibuit ( inqt) ad co^ui^iu^ in quo corporis and langu^s sui figura^
discipulis co^mendauit ac tradidit. That is to say he adm^tted him (saye^he s.
Austen) unto the mandye wherein he deed betake and dely^er unto the discipl^s
the figure of his body and blood, Here does ^his holy father. s. Austen call
yt the figur^ of h^s body. And I am sure there is noma^ so chyldishe / but
that he knows that the figure of a thing is not the thing yt sellff. As by
example the figure of Christ is not Christ him sel^fe / the figure of s.
P^ter is not sa^nt Peter him sellf^. And yet we do nevertheless commonly call
thosse figures by the name of the thing that they do rep^sent. As I may say
when I see the figure of. s. Peter. this is. s. Pe^er to whom Christ delivered
the keys of the kyndom of heuyn. And yet he were a fo^le that wold^ think
that figure to be s. Peter him sel^f: for yt is only a representacion of him.
Besides that. s. Austen says, Augusti^. super psalm. 98.
Non hoc corpus quod uidetis estis manducaturi, nec ^ibituri illu^ sanguine^
que^ effusuri sunt qui me crucifige^^. Sacramentu^ aliqd uobis co^mendaui,
spiritu-liter intellec^um uiuifica^ uos, caro au^t non prodest quicquam That is
to say you shall not ^a^e this body that you see / nor drink that blood wc
they that crucyfie me shall shed out. I have given a sertayne sacrament unto
you if yt be spu^ally understand / yt quickens you: but the flesh profits
nothing. What things can be more plainly spoken?

Furdermore S. Austen says. Sepe ita loquimur ut pascha appropinqua^ te
crastina^ uel perendi na^ Dn^i passionem dicamus: cu^ ille ante tam multo^
annos passus sit, nec omnino nisi semel illa passio facta sit. Nempe ipso die
dn^ico dicimus hodie Dominus resurrexit, cu^ ex quo surrexit totanni
tra^sieru^t Quare nemo tam ineptus est, ut nos ita loquentes arguat esse
mentitos, quia istos dies secundum illoru^ quibus haec gesta sunt similitudine^
nuncupamus: ut dicatur ipse dies qui no^ sit ipse, sed reuolutione temporum
similes eius: and dicatur illo die fieri propter sacramenti celebratione^, quod
non illo die, sediam olim sactu^ est. No^ne semel immolatus est christus in
seipso? and tame^ in sacramento no^ solum per annuas paschae solennitates, sed
omnidie pro populis immolatur: nec utique mentitur qui interrogatus,
responderit eu^ immolari. Si enim sacramenta qua^ dam similitudine^ earum reru^
quaru^ sunt sacramenta no^ haberent, omnino sacramenta non essent Ex hac aute^
similitudine plerumque etia^ ipsaru^ reru^ nomina accipiu^t. Sicut ergo
se^undu^ quenda^ modum sacramentum corporis CHRISTI corpus CHRISTI est, and
sacramentu^ sanguinis CHRISTI sanguis CHRISTI est. Ita sacramenta fidei fides
est, Nihil est aute^ aliud credere, q fidem habere, ac per hoc respondetur
fide^ habere propter fidei sacramenta. Et co^uertere se ad Deu^ propter
co^uersionis sacramentu^. Quia and ipsa responsio per^inet ad celebrationem
sacramenti. Sicut de ipso baptismo apostolus dicit. consepulti (inquit) sumus
Christo per baptismum in mortem, Non ait sepultura^ significauimus, sed prorsus
ait, consepulti sumus. Sacramentu^ ergo tantae rei non nisi eiusdem rei
uocabulo nuncupauit. That is sa^e: We often use to say / when ester drawyth
ney / that to morrow or the next day is the Lords passion / and yett yt is many
years since he suffered / and that passion was never done but once. And upon
that sunday we say / th^s day the lord did rise again / and yet yt is many
years syns he rose / Now is there no man so folishe to reprove us as liars for
saying / be cause we name these days after the similitude of those in which
these things were done so that yt is cauied the same day / which is not the
very same / but by the reuolucyon of time / like yt. And yt is named to be don
the same day thorough the celebracyon of the sacrament (thorough keeping the
memoryall of the thing once done) which is not don that day / but was don
long agoon. Was not CHRIST onece crucyfyed in his own person? and yet in a
mysterye (which is the remembrance of his very passion) he is crucyfyed for
the people not only every feast of ester / but every day: nether does he lie
which (when he is asked) answers that he is crucyfyed for if the sacraments
/ had not certain symilitudes of those things whereof they are sacraments
then should they be no sacraments at all. And for this symilitude for the
most part they take the names of the very things and therefore as after a
certain manner the sacrament of Christys body is Christis body / and the
sacrament of christys blood is Christys blood so the sacrament of faith is
faith. For yt is no another thing to believe then to have faith / and therefore
when a man answers that the infant believes which has not the affecte of
faith / he answerethe that yt has faith for the sacrament of faith: And that
yt turns yt sellfe to GOD / for the sacrament of conuersyon. For the answer
yt sellfe perteyneth unto the mynistryng of ^he sacrament. As the apostle
writes of baptyme: we are buried (says he) with Christ thorough baptyme
unto death. He say^th not we signyfye buryinge / but utterly says we are
buried. He called therefore the sacrament of so great a thing even with the
name of the very thing yt sellfe. etc. If a man would avoid contencyon and
look soberly on thosse words of Sayncte Austen / he shall sone perceive the
mysterye of this matter. For even as the next good frydaye shall be caulled the
day of Christ's passion: and yet he shall not suffer death again upon that
day / for he dyed but onece and is now immortal? even so is the sacrament
called Christ's body. And as that day is not the very day that he dyed on /
but only a remembrance thereof / So the sacrament is not his very natural
body / but only a remembrance of his body breaking and blood she dynge.
And likewise / as the next ester day shall be called the day of his
ressurection / not that yt is the very same day that Christ did rise in / but
a remembrance of the same. Even so the sacrament is called his body: not that
yt is his body in deed / but only a remembrance of the same. And furdermore
even as the pressed does offer him / that is to say crucyfye him at mass / even
so is the sacrament his^ body But the mass does but only rep^sent his passyo^
And so does the sacrament represent his body. And ^et though the mass does
but rep^sent his crucifying / we may truly say he is cru^ified / eu^n so
though the sacrament do but signify or rep^sent his body / yet may we truly
say that yt is his body. Why so? verily (says he) for the sacraments have
a certain similitude of thos^ things whereof the^ are sacraments. And for
this simi^itude for the most perte / they take the namys of the ver^e things.
Blessed be god with has so clearly discussed this matt by this faith full
father. Notwtstonding he does yet express yt more plainly saying: after a
certain ma^er the sacrament of Christ's body is Christ's body. Be hold
dear brethern he says after a certain manner the sacrament is Christ's body.
And by that you may sone know that he never meant that yt should be his very
natural body in deed / but only a token and memorial to keep in m^morie the
death of his body / and so to norishe our faith. Besides that his similitude wc
he after al^egeth of baptime / does holy expound this matter / for (says
he) the apostle says not we signify buryinge: but he says / we are buried
(and yet in deed the baptyme does but signify yt). And there upon s. Austen
adds / that he called the sacrament of so great a thing even wc the name of
the very thing yt sellfe. And like wise yt is in our sacrament. Finallye to be
short I will pass over many places wc I have gatherred out of this holy
father / and will touch but this one moare. Saint Austen says. August^^
co^tra adamantum.
Non ^nim D^^s dubitauit dicere, Hoc est corpus meu^, cu^ daret signu^ corporis
sui. Et in eode^ capite exponit^ Sic est em^ sanguis anima, quomodo petra erat
christus, nec tame^ petra (ait) significabat Christum, sed ait petra erat
Christus. That is to say^ The lord doubted not to say / this is my bo^ye /
when he gave a sign of his body. And after in the same chapter he expounds
yt. For truly so the blood is soul / as Christ was the stone. And yet the
apostle says not / the stone did signifye Christ / but he says the stone was
Christ.

Here. s. Austen says plainly that Christ called the sign of his body /
his body / and in this chapter does compare these three textes of scripture /
this is my body / the bloud^ is the soul / and Christ was the stone: and
declares the^ to be one phrase and to be expounded after one fasshyon. Now is
there no man so mad / as to say / that Christ was a natural stone (except he
be a natural fool) whose Iudg^m^nt we need not greatly to regard therefore we
may well conclude that the sacrament is not his natural body / but is caulled
his body / for a similitude that yt has wherein yt signifies and represents
his body. And that the sacrament of so great a thing is caulled even with the
name of the very thing yt sellf / as s. Austen said imm^diatly before.

This were proffe enough to conclude that all the old fathers did hold the
same opinion / for who would once surmise (saying we have. s. auste^ so p^ayne
for us wc is the chesest emo^ge the^ all) who would once surmise I say / that
the dissented in this great matter from the other faithful fathers / or they
from him? nevertheless I dare not le^t hi^ sto^de post alone / ieste ye
dispice him. And therefore I will show you the mind of certain other also:
and fur^^e of his master s. Ambrose.

Ambrosi: super ^l^ mort^^^^ annu^cia.
S. Ambrose writing upon the Epistle of Paul to the Corinthia^s in the.xi^
chap. says Quia em^ morte Dn^i libe^ati sumus, huius rei in eden do and
pota^do, carne^ and sanguine^ q pro nobis oblata sunt, significamus. That is to
say / because we be delivered by the death of the lord / in eating and
drynkinge of this thing meaning of the sacrament / we signifye the flesh and
blood wc were offered for us. Here does s. ambrose say enough if men were not
sophisters / but would be content with reason. For he says that in eating and
drinkyng the sacrament of Christ's body we signify or represent the flesh
and blood of our savior Jesus. Natwtstondynge be cause you are so slybberye /
we shall bind you a little ^ better by this man's words.

Ambrosi^ de sacra.
S. Ambrose sayth^ Sed forte dices specie^ sanguinis no^ uideo, s^d habet
similitudine^. Sicut em^ mortis similitudine^ sumpsisti, ita etia^
similitudine^ preciosi sanguinis bibis. That is to say. But peradventure thou
will say / I se no apperau^ce of blood / but yt has ^ similitude. For even
as thou haste taken the similitude of death / even so thou drinkest the
similitude of the p^cyous blood. Here may ye see by the co^ferrynge of thesse
two sacraments / what. s. Ambrose i^^ged of it For he says even as thou
haste taken a similitu^e of his death in the sacrament of baptyme so doste thou
drink a similitude of his preciouse blood in the sacrament of the au^ter. And
yet as s. Auste^ said before / the apostle says not we signify buryinge / but
says / we are buried. And likewise here Christ said not this signifies my
body / but this is my body / call^ng the sacrament / sign / toke^ and
memorial of so great a thing / even with the name of the very thing yt sellfe
thus does. s. Ambrose choke our sophisters.

Nevertheless I will allege one place more out of s. ambrose / where he
says. Ambrosi. libro. 3. de sacramen
Dicit sacerdos fac nobis ha^c oblatione^ scripta^ rationabile^, quoth est figura
corporis Dn^i nostri resu xpi. That is / the pressed says make us this oblacio^
acceptable. etc. For yt is a figure of the body of our lord Jesus christ Here
he caulleth yt plainly a figure of christ's body / wc thing you can not
avoid. Therefore give praise unto God and ^ett his troth sprede wc is so
plainly testified / by these holy fathers How let us se what s. Hierom says.

Saint Hierom writynge upon Ecclesiaste says on this manner. Hieroni: super
eccle:
Caro DOMINI uerus cibus est, and sanguis eius uerus potus est, hoc solum
habemus in praesenti saeculo bonum, si uescamur carne eius cruoreque potemur,
non solum in misterio, sed etia^ in scripturaru^ lectione, verus em^ cibus est
and potus, q ex uerbo dei sumitur scientia scripturaru^. That is to say: the
flesh of the lord is very meat / and his blood is very drink. This is
only the pleassure or profit that we have i^ this wordle that we may eat
his flesh and drink his blood not only in a misterry / but also in the
readinge of scriptures. ^or yt is very meat and drink ^ wc is taken out of
Gods word by the knowelege of scriptures. Here may ye se s. Hieroms m^nde
in few words For furste he says that we eat his flesh and drink his
bloud^ in a misterye / wc is the sacrament of his r^m^mbraunce and memoryall of
his passion. And after he adds that we eat his flesh and drink his blood
in the redinge and knowel^ge of scriptures and calls that very meat and very
dri^ke. And yet I am sure ye are not so gross / as to think that the letters
wc you read are turned in to natural flesh and blood. And likewise yt is
not necessary that the bred should be turned in to his body / no more than
the letters in scripture are tourn^d in to his flesh. And nevertheless
thorough faith we may as well ^ate his body in rec^yuinge of the sacrament as
eat his flesh in readinge of the letters o^ the scripture. Besides that s.
Hierom cau^eth the understanding o^ the scripture very m^ate and very drink:
wc you must needs understand in a mystery and spu^all sense / for yt is
another material meat nor dri^ke that is receiuyd with the mouth and teth / but
yt is spn^all meat and drink / and is so called for a similitude and
property: be cause that as meat and drink comfort the body and outward man
/ so does the readinge and knowelege of s^ripture comfort the soul and inward
man. And likewise yt is of christ's body / wc is caulled very meat and very
drink / wc you must needs understand in a mystery or spu^all sense (as. s.
Hierom called yt) for his body is no material meat nor drink that is
received with the mouth or teth: but yt is spiritual meat and drink / and so
called for a similitude and properti^ / because that as meat and drink /
comfort the body / so does the faith in his body breakinge and bloudsheding
refreshe the soul unto liff^ euer^asting. We use yt cu^stomablye in our daily
speech to say / when a child sets all his mind and delyght on sport and
play: It is meat and drink to this child to play. And also we say by a
man that loves well hawkinge and huntyng: It is meat and drink to this man
to hawke and hunte. Where no man doubts / but yt is a figurative speech. And
therefore I wo^d^r that they are so blind in this one point / of Christ's
body. And can not also take the words figuratiuelye / as thesse old
doctors did. Again s. Hierom says. Hieronimus supe^ Matheu^^
Postquam mysti^um pascha fuerat impletu^ and agni carnes cu^ apostolis
comedera^, assumit pane^ qui co^fortat cor hominis, and ad ueru^ paschae
transgreditur sacramentu^, quomodo in praefiguratione eius Melchisedech uinu^
and pane^ pro ferens fecerat, ipse quoque ueritatem corporis repraesentaret.
That is to say after the mystical ester lamb fullfylled and that Christ had
eaten the lambs flesh with the apostles / he took bread wc comforts the heart
of man / and passes to the true sacrament of the easter lamb: that as
Melchisedech brought for the bred and wine figuring hi^ / so might he likewise
rep^sent y^ truth of his body. Here does s. Hi^rom speak after the manner
that tertullia^ did before: that christ with bread and wine did represent the
truth o^ his body, For ^xcept he had had a ^rue body / he could not l^aue a
figure of yt nor rep^sent yt unto us. ^or a vain thing or pha^tas^e can have
no figure / nor ca^ not be rep^sented as by example how should a man make a
figure of his dr^ame or rep^sent yt unto our memory? Bu^ christ has le^t us a
figure and rep^sentacio^ of his body in bred and wine: therefore yt folowyth
tha^ he had a true body. And that this was s. Hieroms m^^de does ma^^feastlye
apere by the word^^ (...) ^^da / wc does more copious^i^ set out this saying
of Hier^m. Beda super Luc.
For he writes on this manner. Fi^itis paschae ueterisso lennijs q in
co^memoratione^ antiquae de aegypto liberatio^is agebant, tra^sit ad nouu^ quoth
in suae redemptionis memoria^ ecclesia frequentare desid^rat, ut uidelicet pro
carne agni uel sanguine suo, carnis sanguinisque sacramentu^ in panis ac uini
figu^a substituens, i^sum se esse mo^s^^a^et cui iurauit Dn^s. Tu es sacerdos
in aeter^u^ se^undu^ ordine^ Melchisedech ^rangit aute^ ipse panem que^
porrigit, ut os^endat corporis sui fractione^ non sine sua sponte futuram
Similiter and calicem posiq (...) nauit dedit eis. Quia ergo panis carnem
confirmat, ui^um uero sanguinem operatur in carne, hic ad corpus Christi
mystice, illud refertur ad sanguinem. That is to say. After the solemnite of
^he old ^aster ^ambe was fynished which was ^l s^rued in the r^membraunce of
^he old delyueraunce out of Egypt / he goth unto the new which the church
gladlye obseruith in the remembrance of his r^d^mptyon / that he in the s^ede
of the fl^iche and blood of the lamb / might institute and ordeyne the
sacrament of his flesh and b^oude in the figure of bread and wine / and so
dec^are him sellf to be the ^ame unto whom the lord swear thou art a
perpetual pressed after the order of Melchisedech. And he him sellf brake the
bread which he gave ^ to show that the breaking of his body should not be don
with out his owyn will. And l^kewise he gave them the cup after ^e hade
soop^d. And because bread does confyrme or strength the flesh / and wine
works blood in the ^l^she / therefore is the br^de misticallye referred unto
the body of Christ / and the wine referred unto his blood.

Here may you note / furste that ^s the lamb was a remembrance of the^r
delyueraunce out of Egypt (and yet the lamb delivered the^ not) so is the
sacrament a remembrance of our rede^ptyon (and yet the sacrament redeemed us
not) ^esydes that he says / that Christ in the stead of the flesh and blood
of the lamb / did institute the sacrament of his flesh and blood in figure
of bread and wine. ^arke well he says not that in the stead of lambs flesh
and blood he did institute his owyn flesh and blood but ^ayeth that he did
institute the sacrament of his flesh and blood. What thing is a sacrament?
verelye yt is the sign of an holy thing / and there is no defferrence b^twene
a sign and a sacrament / but that the sign is referred unto a wordly thing
and a Sacrament unto a spiritual or holy thing.

As s. Austen says. Ad Marcellum.
Signa cu^ ad res diuinas pertinent, sacramenta appellantur. That is to say /
signs when they partayne unto godly things are called sacraments. The^fore
when Beda says that they did institute the sacrament of his flesh and blood
in the figure of bred and wine yt is as much to say (by s. Austens
diffinitio^) as that he did institute the figure of his holy flesh and blood
in the figure of bred and wine that is to say / that br^ade and wine should be
the figure and sign rep^sentyng his holy flesh and blood unto us / for a
perpetual remembrance And afterward he declares the propertye ^or with the
bread is called the body and the wine the blood: saving he speaks ^ot so
darkelye as I now do / but plainly says that the bread is mis^icallye
refferred unto the body of Christ: be cause that as bread does strength the
fl^she so Christ's body which is figured by the bread does s^rengthe the soul
thorough says in his death. And so does he clerlye prove my purpose.

Crisos^o. super. Mat
Now let us se what Chrysostom says wc shall describe us the faith of the
old greacya^s and (I doubt not) he had not lost the treue faith / how so
ever the wordle goo now adays. Chrysostom says in this manner. Si enim
mortuus jesus no^ est cuius signu^ and simbolum hoc sacr^ficiu^ est? uides
^uantu^ ei studium fuerit ut semper memor^a teneamus pro nobis ipsum mortuu^
fuisse That is to say / for if Jesus have not died / whosse memorial and
sign is the sacrifyce. Thou seyst what diligence he gave that we should
contynuallye keep in memory that he dyed for us. Here you may see that
Chrysostom calls the sacrament symbolu^ et signu^: that is to say / a
m^mory^ll and sign of christ / and that yt was in^titute to keep his death in
perpetual remembrance. But of one thing thou must beware or else thou art
deceived / h^ calls it also a sacrafice / and there thou must wyselye
understand him. sacrafice.
For if yt were the sacrafice of Christ's body / then m^ste christ's body be
slain there again / wc thing God forbid. And therefore thou must understand
him when he calls yt a sacrafice / that he means yt to a remembrance of
that holy sacrafice where christ's body was offered on the cross once for
all. For he ca^ be sacrafied no more / saying he is immortal. Not withstondyng
our prelattes will here note me of presumption / that I dare be so boolde to
e^pounde his mind on this fasyon For in deed they take him otherwise / and
think that yt is a v^rye sacrafice. And therefore I will bring one other text
/ where Chrysostom shall expound hi^ sellf. Chrysostom says: Crisosto. ad
Hebre. home. 17.
N^ne per singulos dies offerrimus? offerrimus qde, sed ad recordatione^ mortis
eius facie^tes. Hoc au^t sacrificiu^ (sicut po^tifex) ^ed id ipsum semper
facimus: Imo recordati one^ sacrificij. That is to say / do we not daily offer
or do sacrafice? yes suerlye / But we do yt for the remembrance of his death /
for this sacrafic^ is as an example of that we offer / not an other sacrafi^e
as the bushop (in the old law) did / but ever the ^ame: ye rather a
remembrance of the sacrafice. Furst he says that they daily do sacrafice /
but yt is in remembrance of Christ's does T^en he says that the sacrifice is
an example of that. Thyr^^ye he says that they offer ^ot an other sacryfyce
(that is to say an ox or a goote) as the bushoppes of the old law but ever
the same^ Merke this poynte^ for though yt seame at the first sight to make
with them yet does yt make so derectlye against them ^ that they shall never be
able to avoid yt C^rysost^m^ says they do not offer an other sacrify^e a^ the
bushoppes did but ever the some. They o^fer other bread and wine this da^e then
they ^yd yesterdaye: they shall say an other ma^^e to morrow then they did
this day. Now if this bread and wine / or the mass be a sacrifyce ^ then do
they offer an other sacrifyce / as well as the bushoppys of the old law. For
this sacrifyes did signify that Christ should come and sh^d h^s b^oude / ^s
well as the bred / wine and mass do represent that he has done yt in deed.
And therefore yff yt be a sacrifyce / then do they offer an other sacrifyce /
representyng his passion / as well as the Bishop of the old law But that does
chrysost^me deny / and says that ^hey offer every day the same. What same?
ver^^^e eu^n the same that was done and sacri^^^ed when Christ she^ his
blood. In this sacrifyce is Christ every day bound and buffe^^d and led
from ^nna to Cayphas: he is brough^ to Pyla^e and condemned: he is scorged and
crowned with thorn and nailed on the cross^ and his heart opeynned with aspere /
and so sh^deth his blood. For our redemption. Why chrysostom, and do you the
seelfe same sacrifice every day? ye verelie. Roma. ^
The^ why does S. Paulle say that christ is risyn from death / and dies no
more? if he dye no more / how do you daily cruc^fye him? For sothe Paulle
says truth. For we do yt not actuallye in deed / but ^nly^ in a mystery.
And yet we say / that we do sa^rifice hy^ and that this is his sacryfice / for
the cel^b^a^io^ of the sacrament and memory of the passyo^ which we keep: As
s. Austen declares a fore ad Bonifaci^m
and for this cause yt has the name of the thing that yt does represent and
signify. And therefore I expo^nde my mind be a rethoricall corre^ti^n and say
/ Imo reco^datione^ sacrifi^^, that is to say / ye rather the reme^brau^^e of
the sacrifice. Grauntmercy^s good Chrysostom: now do I perceive the pyth of
this matter: even as the mass is the very death and passyo^ of christ / so is
yt a sacryfice. Now yt does but only represent the verey death and passyo^ of
christ / therefore yt does follow that the mass in very deed does but only
represent a sacrifice. And yet not with standing many times yt is called a
sacrifice of holly^ docto^s / and has the name of the very same thing that
yt does represent and signify. And even s^ we may say often ^ is sacrament /
that as the mass is the very sacry^ice and passyo^ of christ / so is the
sacrament his very body and sacrifice that ^s offered. Now the m^sse does
b^t only rep^sent and signify the passion: so the sacrament does but o^lye
rep^sent and signify the body and very sacrifice onece offered for ever.
Natwtsto^dinge many times the mass is called a sacrifice of ho^^ ^octos: and
so the the sacrament is called the body and a sacrifice. And has the name of
the very same thing that yt does represent and signifye.

Chrisost. super matt.
Furthermore Chrysostom says. Ipse quoque bibit ex eo, ne auditis uerbis illis
dicere^t. Quid igitur sanguine^ bibimus and carnem co^medimus ^ ac ideo
perturbarentur, nam and quando prius de his uerba fecit, etiam uerbis ipsius
offendabantur. Ne igitur tu^c id quoque accideret, primus ipse hoc fecit, utad
co^munionem misteriorum induceret intrepidam. That is to say: he also drank
of yt / lest when they herd his words / they should say: why do we than
drink blood and eat flesh? and so should be trobled. For when he spoke
before of thosse things / they were offended with his words. And because that
should not now also chance / he him sellfe dra^ke furst of yt / that he might
cause them to come with out fear to the pertakinge of those mysteries / here
Chrysostom notes that Christ drank of yt / to draw the^ from the gross
understanding of his words / and by his drinking to testifye unto them that
yt was not his natural blood nor his natural flesh in deed / but only
memoriallys and rep^sentacyones of his body and blood. And therefore he calls
the^ mister^^s: that is to say sacraments. For in this place a sacrament and
a misterye is all one thing. Notwtstondinge some time this word misterye is
more comen and large in signifying then this word sacrament. And I have showed
you before / that a sacrament is the sign of an holy thing / and not the
thing yt sellfe / that yt rep^senteth: albeit sometime yt bear the name of the
very thing yt sellfe / as the Image of^. Peter is not saynct Peter him sellfe
and yet yt bears his name.

Chrisos^ome says. Caro no^ prodest quicq: hoc est, secundu^ spiritu^ uerba
mea audienda sunt. Qui secundu^ carne^ audit, nihil lucratur, nihil utilitatis
accipit. Quid est aute^ carnaliter intelligere? simpliciter ut res dicuntur,
neque aliud quippiam excogitare Misteria oi^a interioribus oculis consideranda
sunt, hoc est spiritualiter. That is to say. The flesh profits nothing:
that is / my words must be understand after the spryte / he that
understands them after the flesh winnith nothing / nor takes no prof^ete
what means this / to v^derstonde after the flesh or carnallye? verelye to
take the thingys simpl^e as they are spoken / and to think none other thing.
All misteryes or sacraments must be considered with the inward eyes / that is
say spirituallye.

And after he expounds him sellfe on this manner, Interiores aute^ oculi ut
pane^ uiderint, creaturas transuolant, and no^ de illo pane a pistore cocto
cogita^t: sed de eo qui dixit se pane^ uitae, qui per misticu^ pane^
significatur, That is to say. The inward eyes as soon as they see the bred /
they pass over the creatures / and think not of that bred wc is bakyn of the
bakear / but of him that called him sellfe the bread of lyffe wc is sig^ifyed
by the mystical or sacrame^tall bread. Would you have him sa^e any more? he
tells you plain / that Christ wc is the very bred of lyffe / is signified
by this sacramental bread. And that is the thing wc our bushoppes so fleshly
deneie now adays / wc thing yet you may set / the old fathers conclude wc
one a^s^nt. Notwtstonding yet I will allege mo old do^tours / so that from
hence forward they m^ye be as^am^d to call yt new ^errn^ng^. Fulgentius
says. Fulgentius.^. li broad fide
In illis em^ carnalibus (^pere legis) uictimis, significatio f^it carnis
Christi qua^ prop^tis nostris and ipse si^e p^t^^ fuerat oblaturus, and
sanguinis que^ erat eff^surus in re^issione^ peccatoru^ nostroru^. In isto au^^
sacrificio grati^ru^ actio atque co^memoratio est car^nis Christi qua^ pro
nobis obtuli^, and sanguinis que^ pro nobis ide^ D^us eff^dit. That is to sa^e.
In these carnal sacrificis in the time of the law^ / was a si^nifica^io^ of the
flesh of christ wc h^ with out sy^ne / should offer for our sins / and of
the blo^d wc he s^uld shede out in r^m^^s^on of our synne^. But in this
sacrifice is a tha^^es g^ui^g and remembrance of the flesh of christ wc h^
o^fered for us / and of the blood wc the sa^^ god shed out for us F^rste note
that he calls y^ a sacrifice wc notwtstonding^ is but a remembrance of that
sacrifice o^fere^ o^ the cro^se once for all / a^ yt is proved before out of
Chrysostom. Then he ^lay^ly calls ^t a thanks g^uinge / and rem^mbrance of
Chri^tes fles^e and blood: and so concludes with us. Ne^erthelesse because
sophysters would son^ think to avoid this pla^e / I w^ll allege one other
sa^inge of the same / aucto wc they shall never be able to avoid.

Fulgentius says / as H^y^o ^estifieth- Hic calix nouum testamentum est:
^^gen.
id est, hic calix quem ^obis trado, nouum testamentum signifi^at. That is to
say. This cup or chalice is the new testament: That is / this cup or
chalice which I deliver you does sygnifye the new testament. In this place he
does plainly show his mind / wc can ^ot be avoided. For even as the cup is
the new testament ^ so is the bread the body. ^owe the cup does but
sygnifye the new testament. And therefore I may conclude that the bread does but
syg^ifye the body.

Eus^b^us says. Eusebi^
Quia corpus assumptum ablaturus erat ex oculis nostris and syderibus
allaturus, n^c^ssarium erat ut nobis in hac die ^acramentum corporis and
sanguinis consecraret, ut coleretur iugiter per mysterium quod semel
offerebatur in precium. That is to say: Because he would take away out^ of
our eyes the body that he took and carye yt in to heuyn / It was necessary
that in this time he s^ulde consecrate to us the sacrament of his body and
blood: that that wc was once offered for the price of our rede^ptyo^ / might
co^t^nuallye be honored thorough the mysterye.

To consecrate a thing / is to apply^ yt unto an holy^ vs^. Co^secr^^
Here you may see that he call^th yt the sa^rame^t of his body and b^oude /
wc body is cary^d up in the heaven: And also he calls yt a mist^rye wc is
ynowe for them that will see.

Also druthmarius expounds these words this is my body on this manner:
Druthmarius.
Hoc est corpus meum in misterio. That is to say: this remy body i^ a
myst^rie. I think you know what a misterye means ^hriste is crucifi^d every
day in a mystery: that is to say / every day his death is represented by the
sacraments of remembrance. The mass is Christ's passion is a misterye: that
is to say: the mass does rep^sented his passion and keeps yt in our
memory. The bread is Christ's body in a mystery: that is to say / ^t
rep^senteth h^s body that was brokyn for us ^ and kep^th yt in our
remembrance.

You have herd all redye the mind of the doctors / how the sacrament is
Christ's body. And now I shall show you how the sacrament is our body / wc
does not a little help^ to the vndsto^ding of these words wc are in
controversy

The sacrament of the altar is our body as well as yt is christ's body. And
even as yt is our body / so is yt Christ's. But there is no man that can say
that yt is our natural body in deed / but only a figure / sign / memorial
or rep^sentacyon of our body Wherefore yt must also follow ^ that yt is but
only a figure / sign / memorial or rep^sentacyon of Christ's body. The
furste perte of this argument ma^e thus be proved S. Austen writing in a
sermon sa^eth on this maner^ Augusti^us i^ ser^one ad ^^^antes.
Corpus ergo Christi si uu it is intelligere, apostolu^ audite dicente^, Vos
estis corpus Christi and me^bra. 1. Cor. 12. Si ergo estis corpus Christi and
membra, mysteriu^ uestrumque in mensa Dn^i positu^ est, mysteriu^ Dn^i positu^
est, misteriu^ Dn^i accipitis, ad id quod estis, Amen respondetis and
respo^dendo subscribitis. That is to say: Yff you will vndersto^^ the body of
Christ / here the apostle wc says / ye are the body of Christ and members.
^. cor. 12. th^rfore if ye be the body of christ and members / ^our mystery
is put upon the lords table / ye receive the mystery of the lord / unto
that you are you answer Amen. And in answ^ringe subscribe unto yt. Here you
may see that the sacrament is also our body / and yet is not our nat^ral
body / but only our body in a misterye / that is to say / a figure sign /
memorial or rep^sentation of our body / for as the bread ye made of many
graynes or corns / so we (though we be many) are one bread and one body. And
for this property and s^militude yt is called our body and bears the name
of the very thing wc yt does represent and signifye.

Again s. Austen sayth^ Augusti^ in sermon de sacrate riapasch^
Quia Christus passusest pro nobis, co^mendauit nobis in isto sacramento corpus
and sanguine^ suu^, quod etiam fecit and nos ipsos, Nam ^ nos ipsius corpus
facti sumus, and per misericordia^ ipsius quod accipimus nos sumus. Et postea
dicit. Iam in noi^e Christi tanquam ad calice^ Dn^i uenistis, ibi uos estis in
mensa and ibi uos estis in calice^ That is / because christ has suffered ^or
us / he has betaken vn^e us in this sacrament his body and blood wc he has
also made even our sellfes. For we also are made hie body / and by his
mer^ye we are even the same thing that we receive. And after he says / now in
the name of christ / ye are come / as a man would say / to the chalice of the
lord: there are ye upon the table and there are ye in the chalice. Here you
may see / that the sacrament is our body. And yet yt is not our natural
body / but only in a misterye as yt is before said.

Furthermore s. Austen sayeth^ Angusti^ de sacra^^ riapasch^
Hunc itaque cibu^ and potu^ societate^ uult intelligi corporis and membrorum
suoru^ quoth est sancta ecclesia in predestinatis and uocatis and iustificatis and
glorificatis sanctis and fidelibus ^ius. Huius rei sacramentu^ alicubi
quotidie, alicubi certis interuallis dierum in dominico preparatur^ and de
men^a Domini sumitur, quibusdam ad uitam, quibusdam ad exitium. Res uero ipsa
cuius est sacramen^um, est omni homini ad uitam, ^ulli ad extium, qui^unque
eius particeps su^rit. That is to say / he will that ^his meat and drike
s^ulde be understand to be the fellowship of his body and membris which is the
holy churches in the predestinate and called and justified and glorified his
saynctes and faithful, The sacrament of this t^inge is prepared in some place
daily / and in some place at certain appointed days as on the sondaie And yt
is received ^r^m t^^ table of the lord / to some unto ^^ffe and to some unto
distruc^ion. Bu^ ^he thing yt s^^^fe whose sacram^nt this is ^ is re^^y^ed of
all me^ unto ^iff / and of no man unto (...) who so ever is partaker of yt.
Here does ^^ ^u^^en furs^e say / that this sacrament is the ^^owshyp of his
body and mem^res which are we. And yet yt is not our natural body / as is
before said. And then he says that the sacrament of this thing is r^ceyued of
some unto lyff and salvation and of some unto d^t^ and dampnation. For both
^ayth^ull and ^^faythfull may receive the sacra^ent. And after he says /
that the ^hyng yt sellff whose sacrament yt is / is received of al men unto
lyffe ^ and of no man unto destructyon / who so ^u^r is partaker of yt. And of
this say^nge yt must needs follow / that only the ^aythfull eat CHRIST'S
body / and the vn^aythfull eat him not^ For he is received of no man unto
destructyon And of this yt must also follow that the sacrament is not
Christ's body in deed / but only in a mysterye. For yff the sacrament were
his na^urall body / then should yt fo^^owe / that the unfaithful sh^lde
receive his body. Which is contrary to the mind of saint Aus^en / and
against all truth? Thus have we suffecyentlye proved the ^yrst part of our
argument / that the sacrament is our body / as well as yt is CHRIST'S. And
now will I prove the second part more plainly (although yt be enough declared
all redye / to them that have ears) that is / that even as yt is our body so
is yt Christ's.

Furste you shall vnders^ond that in the wine which is called Christ's blood /
is admixed water / which does signifye ^he people that are redeemed with his
blood: so that the heed wc is Chris^e / is not with out his body wc is the
faithful people nor the body with out his heed. Now if the wine when yt is
consecrated / be turned bodily in to Christ's blood / then is yt also
necessary that the water wc is admixed be bodelie turned in to the blood of
the fay^hfull people. For where as is one co^secratio^ must follow one
opera^ion And where as is like reason there mus^e follow like mystery. But
what so ever is signified by the water as co^cerninge the fay^hfull people / is
taken spu^all^ Therefore what so ^uer is spoken of the bloud^ i^ the wine /
must also ned^s betakin spu^allie. Bartra^.
This reason is not mine / but yt is made by one bartra^ upon a.700. years
sins / when this matt was furs^e i^ disputaco^. Where upon at the instance of
great Char^es the Emperour^ he made a book professynge even the same thing
that I do / and proves by the old doctors and faithful fathers / that the
sacrament is Christ's body in a mystery / that is ^o say / a sign / figure
or memorial of his body which was broken for us / and not his natural
body. And therefore that doctrine is new wc otherwise teaches / and not mine
wc is not mine / but the doctrine of Christ and of the old fathers of
Christ's church / till Antichriste began to sytt and reign in the temple of
God,

^^prianus ad^ec^i^u^,
Besides that Cypriane says that the people is annexed in the sacrament
thorough the mi^ture of water. Therefore I meruell me much that they are so
co^tentious and will not see / that as the water is the people / so the wine is
christ's blood / that is to say in a misterye / because yt represents
christ's blood / as the water does the people.

eusebius
Furthermore Eusebius sayth^ Du^ in sacrame^tis uino aqua miscetur, christo
fidelis populus incorporatur and iungitur and quada^ ei copula perfecta
charitatis unitur. That is to say / why^es in the sacrament water is admixte
with the wine / the faithful people is incorporate and Joined with Christ and is
made one with him / with a cert^yne knott of perfayte charity. Now where he says
/ that we are Joined and in corporate with Christ / what fondness were yt to
co^tende / sith we are there only in a misterye / and not naturallye: to
contend I say with such pertinacite that his natural body must be there: and
not rather that he is Joined with us / as we are Joined with him and both in a
mystery / by the knott of parfay^e charity.

The young man perceyuith well enough that More.
an allegory used in some place is not a cause sufficient to leave the proper
significations of gods word in every other place and seek an allegorye / and
forsake the plain comen sense, For he confesses that he would not so do save
for necessite: because (as he says) that the common lyterall sense is
impossible. For the thing he says that is me^te therbye can not be true? That
is to wite / that the very body of christ can be in the sacrament / because
the sacrament is in many diverse places at onece / and was at the maundye: that
is to wite / in the hands of Christ and every of his appostellis mouths.
And at that time yt was not glorified. And then he says that Christ's body
not being glorified / could no more be in to places at once than his own
can. And yet he goth after further / and says no more yt can when yt is
glorified to. And that he proves by the saying of S. Austen whose words be /
that the body with which Christ arose must be in one place. etc.

Hertherto has master More resoned reasonably: Frith.
but now he beginnith to decline from the dignite of divinity in to the dirtye
dregs of vain sophistry. For where I say that I must of necessite seek an
allegory because the literal sense is impossible and can not be true /
meaning that yt can not sto^de with the process of scripture / but that other
textes do of necessi^e constrain me to construe yt spirituallye. There ca^chet
he this word / can / and this word impossible / and would make men believe
that I meant / yt could not be true because reason can not reach yt / but
thinks yt impossib^e. And there he triumphs (before the victory) and wold^
know what article of our faith I could ass^gne / in wc reason shall not dreue
away the stre^gthe of mi pruffe ^ and make me leave the literal sense wherein
my proffe should s^o^d / and send me to seek an allegory that might stond with
reason / and drive away^ the faith. But now dear brethern / siht I speak not
of the impossibilite of reason / but of the impossibilite to sto^de with other
textes of scripture / ye may see that this ryall reason is not worth a rishe.
Then would he feign know the place were s. Aus^e^ so says, wc thing
allthought / ^t were hard for m^ to tell / since I have not his books to look
for yt ^ yet I tha^k^ god my memory is not so bad / but I can show him wh^re
he shall fi^de yt. And because I think that he is more accustomed to the popes
laws then ^o S. Aus^ens works ^ since he is become the p^lates proctoure and
patron: I say he shall not fail but find yt in his laws de co^secratione.
And where as he would wreste the words of s. Austen / which says that the
body in wc Christ arose must needs be in one place: saying that he might
mean / not that his body might not le i^ ^iuerse places at onces / but that
yt must be in one place / that is to say / in some one place or other / he
speaks (says master more) nothing of the sacrament nor says not his body
with wc he rosse must needs be in one place / that yt can by no possibilite be
in any mo. This seameth to some a good lie gloss / and yet yt shall prove but a
vain euasio^ For if a man would say that the kings graces body must be in
one place / and then a another would expou^de that natwtsto^dynge his words his
graces body might be in two places at once / I think m^n might sone Judge
that he delicted to delay / and might say / what need he to determye / that
he must be i^ one pla^e / except he thought in deed / that he might be in no
mo but only on^? And though men might so argue on other men's words / yet of
saint Auste^s words this must needs follow / for he bryngyth them in (as god
would) by a contrary antithesis saying, Ad Hieronimu^.
Corpus in quo r^surrexit in uno loco esse oportet, ueritas autem eius ubique
diffusa est. That is to say / his body wherein he rose / must be in one place
/ but his truth is disper^ed in all places. Where he plainly concludes by the
contrary antithesis that as his truth is disp^rsed in all places / so must
his body needs be in one place only. As by example / if a man should say.
The king his graces body must n^des be in one place / but his power is
thorough out his Realm. Where no man doubts / but that in saying one place /
he means one place only. And therefore though in some place / that word
must / does not signify such a necessite as excludes all possibilite / yet
i^ this place yt does so signify / as the contrary antithesis does evidently
express.

And where ye say / that h^ speaks nothing of the sacrament / I would ye
should stick still to that saying. For this is plain / that he speakyth of
his natural body. And therefore if he speak not of the sacrament / then have
you concluded that the sacrament is not his natural body: the contrary
whereof you would have me^ believe. Thus have I showed evidence / both where he
shall find the words of s. Austen and all so that I have right allegeth them.

Not wtstondyng sith he makes so much of ^ys paynt^d sheth / I shall a l^^e
him more auetorite that christ's natural body is in one place o^lye. wc
thing proved does utterly conclude that the sacrament is not his natural
body / but only a memoryall representynge the same. And ^urste let us ^ee s.
Austens mind.

August. ad Dardanium.
Saint Auste^ writing unto dardanus death plainly prove that the natural body
of Christ must needs be in one place only / and also that his soul can^ be
but in one place at once. The occasion of his pistle is this: darda^s did write
unto s. Austen for the exposition of thosse words that christ spoke unto the
theiffe saying: this day shall thou be with me in paradise: and wi^t not how
he should understand yt / whether christ me^t that the theffe should be in
paradise with christ^s soul / or with his body ^ or with his godhed There upon s.
Auste^ writes that as touching christ's body / that day yt was in the
sepulcher. And says that yt was not paradise / although it were in a garden
that he was buried For christ he says meant of a place of Joy. And that was
not (says s. Auste^) in his sepulcher. And as For christ's soul / yt was that
dye in hell. And no man will say ^ that paradise was there. Wherefore (says s.
Austen) the text must needs be understand / that christ spoke yt of his
godhed. Now mark this argument of. s. Austen / and ye shall se my purpose
playnlie proved. For saying he expounds this text upon christ's godhed /
because his ma^hod astouchinge the body / was in the grave / and as touching
his soul / was in hell: you may sone perceive / that Aust^ thought / that
whiles his body was in the grave / yt was not in peradise to: and because his
soul was in hell / yt could not be in paradise also. And therefore he
verefyeth the text upon his divinity. For if he had thought that christ's
body or soul might have been i^ diverse places at once / he would no^ have
said / that the text must needs be understood of his diuite / but yt might
full well / ye and much better have bin understand of his manhood. Mark well
this place wc does determine the doubt of this matter. Notwtstondinge the
faithful father leueth not the matter on this fa^^yon / but also takes a
way soche fond ymaginationis as would cause men to surmise / that Christ's
body should be in mo places at once then one. For he says. Cauendum est ne
ita diuinitatem astruamus hominis ut ueritate^ auferamus corporis. Non est au^t
consequens ut quod in deo est, ita sit ubique. Nam and de nobis ueracissime
scriptura dicit, quod in illo uiuimus, mouemur and sumus. Nec tame^ sicut ille,
ubique ^umus, sed aliter homo ille in Deo, qm^ and aliter deus in illo ho^e,
proprio quoda^ and singulari modo. Vna enim persona deus and homo est, et
Vtru^que est unus Christus resus, vbique per id quod deus est, in celo au^t per
id quod homo. That is to say we must beware that we do not so a^fyrme the
diuinyte of the man / that we take away the truth of his body. For yt
followyth not that the thing wc is in god / should be i^ every place as god is.
For the scripture does truly ^estefie on us / that we live / move and be in
him. And yet are we not in every place as he is. How bey / that man is other
wise in god / and god otherwise in that man by a certain peculier and syngler
way. For god and man is one person / and both of the^ one christ Jesus wc is
in every place in that he is god, and in heuyn / in that he is man. Here Auste^
does say / that if we should gra^^t christ to be in all places as touching his
ma^hode / we should take away the truth of his body. For though his ma^hode be
in god and god in his manhood yet yt follows not / that yt s^ulde be in
every place / as god is. And a^^er he concludes that as touching his godhed
he is in every place / and as thouchyng his manhood he is in hevin. What need
he to make these words and ant^thesies / but because he thought verelye that
though his godhed were in every place / yet his ma^hode was in heuyn only.

But yet this holy doctoure goth further (so that they may ^e ashamed of there
pertye) and sa^eth. Augustinus ^bide^
Secundu^ homine^ namque in terra erat, non in coelo (vbi nu^c est) qua^do
dicebat. nemo ascendet in coelu^ nisi qui desce^dit de coelo, fiilius hoi^es q
est in coelo. That is to say / as touching his manhod he was in the yerth and
not in heuyn (where he now is) when he said / no man ascends into heuyn but
he that descended from heuyn / the sone of man wc is in heuin. Now I trust ye
will be content and let the truth spread. For I am sure yt is not possible for
you to avoid yt for he says / that as touching his ma^hod he was in the earth
and not in heuin / when he spoke those words: and so proves that he was not
in (...) places at once then only one place. For else if s. Austen had thought
that he could have been in mo places at onece the^ one with his body / then
might he not have said / that he was in yerth and not in heuyn. For then a man
might sone have deluded him and have said^ Austen you can not tell / for he
may be in every place. But they that so think after Auste^s mind / do take
away the truth of his natural body / and make yt a very fantastical
body: from the wc heresy god deliver his faithful. Besides this S. Austen
does say. Christum Dominu^ nostrum unigenitu^ DEI filium equale^ patri,
eundemque hoi^s filium quo mayor est pater, and ubique totum presentem esse non
dubite^ tanquam Deum, and in eodem templo DEI esse uerum DEVM, and in aliena
part coeli propter corporis modu^. That is to say / doubt not but that
christ our lord the only begotto^ soune of god equal to the father / and
the same being the son of man wherein the father is greater / is hole p^sent
in all places as touching his godhed and dwellythe in the same temple of GOD as
GOD and in some place of heaven for the condition of his very body. Here is yt
evident by s. auste^s word^s that as touching his godhed he is i^ all places.
And as touching his manhod he is only in heuin^ye and not that only / but
that he being in heuin as touching the measure ^ nature / condicyon and qualite
of his natural body / is only in one certain place in heuin / and not in
many places at once. Thus much is proved out of Saint Austen.

This truth is not only proved by s. Auste^s auctorite / but also by the
noble clarke Fulgentius wc writes on this manner Vnus idemque homo localis ex
homine, qui esi Deus immensus expa^^e, unus idemque secundu^ humanam
substantia^ absens coelo cu^ esset in terra, and derelinquens terra^ cu^
ascendisset in coelu^. Secu^d^m diuina^ uero immen samque substant^a^, nec
co^lu^ dimittens cu^ de coelo descendit, nec t^rra^ des^^ens, ^um ad co^lum
ascendit. Quod ipsius Dn^i certissimo s^^mone potest cogno sci^ qui ut lo^alem
os^enderet sua^ humanitate^, dicit discipulis suis: Ascendo ad patrem meu^ and
patrem uestru^, Deum meu^ and Deu^ ues^ru^, ^e Lazaro qu^que cu^ dixisset,
Lazarus mortuus est, adiun^it dicens, e^ gaudeo propter uos (ut credatis)
quonia^ non era^ ibi ^mmensita^em uero su^ diuinitat^^ oftendens discipulis
dicit: Ec^^ ^go uo^is^u^ s^m usque ad co^summationem saecu^^. Quomodo aute^
as^endit in coelu^ nisi quia localis and uerus est homo, aut quomodo adest
fidelibus suis, nisi quia idem inmensus and uerus D^us est. That is to say.
The same one man is locale (that is to say / contained in one place) as
thouching his manhod / wc is also God unmeasurable from the father: the same one
man as touching the substance of his manhod / was absen^ from heuin / when he
was in earth / and forsakinge the yerth / when he ascendid in to heuin / but as
touching his godly and unmeasurable substance he nether for soke heuin when he
descended from heaven / nor forsook the earth / when he ascended unto heaven.
Which may be known by the most sure word of the lord wc to schew his
humanite to be localle (that is to say / contained in one place only) did
say unto his disciplis. I ascend unto my father and your father / my God and
your God / of Lazarus also when he said / Lazarus is ded / he said futher, I am
glade for your sake (that you may believe) for that I was not there. And again
/ schewing the vnmeasurablenes of his godhed / he said unto his disciples /
behold I am with you unto the worlds end / how did he ascend in to heaven / but
because he is local and a very man? Or how is he present unto his faithful
/ but because he is unmeasurable and very God? Here may you conclude by the
auctorite of this doctoure also / that Christ's body is only in one place to
onece. For he says that christ as touching his ma^hed is local: that is to
say / contained in one place only. And that he proves by the scripture even
of Christ's awyn words. Now if this be true (as mi conscience does testify /
how so ever other men shall Judge) Then must yt needs follow that his
natural body can not be in the sacrament. And the auctorite. I am sure no man
can avoid / yt is so plain.

Now as for his natural reasons be not worthy the reasoning. More.
For furste that the body of christ unglorified could no more be in two
places at once then his owyn can / because he is a natural body / as he is. I
will not examine no comparison betweyn there to bodies: but if christ would
tell me that he would each of both there bodies to be in ^yft^ne places at once
/ I would believe him / and would never ask him whether he would first gloryfye
them or not. But I am sure gloryfyed or unglorified / if he said yt / he is
able to do yt^ For the matter is not ympossible to God.

Fr^^h.
Truth yt is that if christ so said and in so saying so meant / th^re is no
doubt / but he were able so to do. but that he in deed so gross^lie me^t ye
shall never prove. And in deed if he had so meant that his owyn body natural
should have continued in the sacrament with is the meat of the so^^e thorough
^ayth / and not of the body by ^atinge yt / and may as will be eatyn thorough
^ayth although yt Remain in heuyn / as if yt were here present to our
mouths: if I say he had so meant / then would he never have given us such
scriptures as he did. For I say that this gross imaginacyon may not stand with
the process of the scripture wc is received as yt shall appear by certain
t^xtes.

Furste where our savior says: the flesh profits nothing. The weight of
those words does compel us to understood our matter spu^alye / for by this
short sentense we are no less plucked bake from the carnal eatinge ^ then was
Nichodemus that he should not once dream of the carnal regeneracyon / when
christ said unto him: that what so ever was of the flesh was flesh. For this
is a plain conclusion / that when Christ said / the flesh profytyth nothing
/ he meant yt even of his owyn flesh that yt could not profit (as they
understood him) to be eaten with the ^eth. Albeyt yt does much profit to be
slain for our redemption and eaten thorough faith. Which thing we may do
although his natural flesh be not i^ the sacrament. ^or I may^ as well believe
in him though he be in heaven / as if he were in yerth and in the sacrament /
and b^for^ mine eyes. And that Christ spoke these words of his owyne body /
yt is plain by S. Aus^ens words wrytinge upon the same place. Augusti. tract
super 6. Joan.
And therefore he says / that they must be understood spu^allye / and adds:
if thou understand them spirituallye / they are sprite and lyffe. And though
thou understand them carnallye / yet nevertheless they are spryt and lyff: But
unto the they are not sprite and lyff / which vnderstondest not spirituallye
those things that I have spoken.

Also Athanasius says. Athanasius ^. li. qu^ dix. verb^
Spu^s est q uiuificat, carono^ ^dest quicq: uerba q ego locutus sum, spu^s
sunt and uita. Nam and hoc loco utru^que de seipso dicit carne^ and spiritu^,
and spiritu^ ab eo quod est secundu^ carne^ distinxit, ut no^ solu^ uisibile,
sed etia^ inuisibile quod in ipso erat crede^tes dis^a^r, quoth et ea q dicit no^
sunt carnalia sed spu^alia. Quod em^ comedentibus suffecisset corpus, ut totius
mu^di alimonia fiat? Sed ea propter meminit asce^sus filij hoi^s in coelu^ ut
illos a corporali cogitatione auelleret, and post hac disca^t carne^ dicta^
cibum coelestem superne uenientem and spiritualem alimonia^ qua^ ipse det, na^
quae locutus ^um (inquit) uobis spiritus sunt and uita. That is to say / yt is
the sprite that qui^ken^th / the flesh profieteth nothing the words wc I
speak unto you / are spirit and liffe. For in this place also he means both
of his own flesh and his owyn spirit / and he divided the spirit from the
flesh: that they might know thorough faith not only the visible part / but
also the invisible part y^ was in him / and also that the words wc he spoke
were not carnal but spu^all. For what body should have suff^sed to have been
the meat of all the wordle? And even therefore did he make m^ntion of the
as^e^sion of the son of man in to heaven / that he might wtdrawe them from the
bodily imagina^ion / that they might here after learn / that the flesh was
called heuynlye meat which com^th from a boue and spiritual meat wc he would
g^ue. For (says Christ) the words that I have spoken unto you / are spirit
and liffe. Here you may see that christ spoke yt of his ow^n flesh / and
meant playnlie that yt did nothing profi^e / as infideles did understand him.
For else yt geuithe lyffe / as yt is received of the faithful in a mystery.
For as bartram Bartra^.
says / in this mystery of the body and blood / is a spiritual operation
wc gives lyffe. With out the with operation those mysteries do nothing profit
/ for surely (says he) they may feed the body / but the soul they can not
feed.

Besides that the scripture says / that that enters in by the mouth does not
def^le a man / for as christ says / yt is cast forth in to the drawght.
And by the same reason yt follows that yt does not sanctify or make a man
holy. But the sacrament enters i^ by the mouth: therefore yt does follow that
(of yt sellfe) y^ does not sa^ctifie or make holy / and of this text should
follow two inco^uenie^ces / if the sacrament were the natural^ body of
christ Furste yt should follow that the body of christ should not sanctify the
faithful because yt enters in by the mouth. And again yt should follow /
that the body of christ should be cast out in to the drawght / wc thing is
abominable, Wherefore yt must needs follow / that the sacrament can not be his
natural body.

Furthermore Christ would not suffer that devout woman wc of love sought him at
his sepulture / to touch his natural body / because she lacked a point of
faith / and did not count him to be equal with his father. And much more yt
shall follow that the wicked wc have no faith nor love toward him / shall
not be suffered to eat his flesh with there teth / and swallow yt in ^o their
unclean bodies: for that were much more then to touch him. And yet not
withsta^dinge they receive and eat the sacrament. Where upon yt should follow
if the sacrament were his natural body / that they should in deed eat his
bodie^ wc thing may be recounted a blasphemye against God. More over Christ
says he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me and I in
him: Now we know right well that the wicked do eat the sacrament / and yet
nether dwell in christ / nor christ in then. Wherefore yt must follow that
the sacrament is not the very flesh of Christ. And surely I can not excuse
them of blasphemy which so direct^lye contrary Chri^^es words.

How can you avoid these textes wc christ speaks unto his disciples
saying: yet a litell wh^le am I with you. Joan. 6.
And then I d^parte to him that sent me. And again yt is expedyent for you
that I de^arte. Ioan^ 6.
For except that I depart / that com^orter shall ^ot come unto you. Joan. 6.
And again he says / I forsake the world and goo to mi father. Math. 26
(...). 14.
And to be sh^rt he say^th pore men ye shall ever have with you ^ut me shall you
not ever haue^ Ioan^ 12
^ow we know right well that his godhed is in all plac^s / and t^a^ as
^ouchynge his godhed he forsook not the word^e / when he ascended unto his
fa^^er. Wherefore yt must needs follow that he for^oke yt as ^ouchyng his
flesh and manhood And ther^o agrees the expositions of Saint Austen ^ and
Fulgentius before alleged / ye and all other old faithful fathers. Now if he
have forsaken the world as touching the pres^nce of his natural flesh and
ma^hode (as all doctors defyne) then meant he not that his natural flesh
should be present in the sacrament ^ to be ^aten with our teth And therefore
though Christ so tell you / yet mus^e you take him as he meane^h / or ^ls you
be begyled, For if ye think that GOD both may and will fullf^ll and veryf^e
all things according to the letter as he sp^aketh the^ / I may call you an
^bedyent man / as Saynct BARNARD does his monk Adam And may say (as he does)
that if that be the right way / so symplye to receive all thing / we may put
out the text of scripture which warnyth us to be wise as sarpeni^s. For the
text followynge is sufficient / which bids us to be simple an doves.

Why does your mastership grant a necessary allegorye / when Paull says /
CHRIST is a stone / or when CHRIST says that he is a door? The scripture
says he is both twain. And sith GOD so says / he is able so to make yt. And
ther^ore by your reason we shall need none allegory in all scripture / and
then he that is most simple and folishe / may be counted most faithful. And
so shall we need no faithful fathers to expound the text / but yt shall be most
merit / to believe the letter. This I deny not / but that God could have don
yt / if he had so intended / when he spoke the words: But now the scripture
stondynge as yt does / I think he can not do yt. As by example I think that
god by the blood of his sone Christ might have saved all men / both faithful
and unfaithful / if he had so intended / and that yt had so pleassed him. But
now the scripture s^ondyng as they do / I say he can not do yt / and that
yt is impossible for him. For then he might Make his sone a liar wc says / he
tha^ be^eueth not is dampened. Joan, ^.
And again / he that believes not shall not se lyffe / but the wrath of god
abides upon him. And even as yt is impossible to sto^de with the process of
scriptures (wherein god has declared his will) that the unfaithful should be
saved although god might have do^ yt at the furst if he hade so would. Likewise
yt is impossible the scriptures sto^dinge as they do / that the natural body
of Christ should be p^sent to our teth in the sacrament. And as for our faith /
yt needs not to have him p^sent in the bread. For I may as well eat hi^ and
drink him thorough faith: that is to say / believe in him / as though he were
as present in the sacrament / as he was haugyng on y^ cross.



Besides that I would know of what necessite or profit his flesh must be
present in the sacrament. For the p^sence of his flesh can no more profit us /
then does the remembrance of his body / but this remembrance may as well be
don by the sacrament / as though his body were present. And therefore since God
and nature make naught in vain / yt followethe consequentlye / that his
natural flesh is not there / but only a memorial thereof.

Furthermore the end and final cause of a thing for the end (as the house
is better than the lyme / stone and timber / which are provided for the house)
but the end and final cause of the sacrament is the remembrance of Christ's
body: and there upon yt must follow that if the sacrament be his natural
body / that the remembrance of Christ's body should be better then his body
yt sellfe Which thing is to be abhorred of all faithful men.



the mind thorough faith / does sp^alye behold the very body, And surely
thereof if a man be faithful / the sprite of God works in his heart very
swetlye at his communion.

Finallye / yt was not lawful to eat or drink the blood not only of man /
but also of a brute beast / and the apostelles them selves moved by the rule
of charity / did institute that men should abstain from blood somewhat
fauorynge the infyrmyte of the Jews. Now if the apostellys had taught (as ye
do) that in the sacrament his very flesh and bloud^ is ^aten and drunk with
the teth and mouth of faithful and unfaithful / what could have be ne a
g^eater occasyon to have excluded the Jews from crystes faith even at once?
Think you that the appostellys would not have been to scrupulous to have
dronken his very blood / seeing yt was so plain against Moses law / if they
had understand him so grosselye as ye do? ^ct. 10.
Pet^r had a clothe sent down from heuyn / in which were all manner of beasts
^orbidden by the law / and was commanded to s^e and ^at^ them. And he
answered / God forbid for I never eat any unclean thing / meaning therbye
that he never ^ate any thing forbidden by the law. Whereof yt most needs
follow that either he never rec^yued the sacrament (wc is plain false) or else
that he more spiritually understood the words of Chris^es maundie then ye
falselye feign. For yt was plainly forbidden by the law / to eat or drink
any manner of blood, ^^ection
And I know but one reason that they have wc they count an insoluble: how beyt
by gods grace we shall sone avoid yt. There reason is this Paul says / he
that eats and drinks this sacrament vnworthylye / shall be gyltye of the
body and blood of the lord. Now say they ^ how s^uld they be gyltie of the
lords body and blood wc receive yt unworthily / except yt were the very
body and blood of the lord

This argument I say / is very weak and slender. solution.
For I can show many example^ by the wc yt may be dissolved for he that
dispisseth the kings sealle or letters offends against his owe^ parson / and
yet the letter or seal is not his owen parson. He that vyolently plucketh
down his graces arms or breakyth his broad s^ale with a furyo^se mind or
vyolence / commits treason against his owyn parson. And yet his arms and
broad seal are not his owyne person / he that clepyth the kyngys coin
commits treason against the kings parson and the commen wealth: and yet the
money is nether his graces parson nor the common wealth And therefore your
argument is but weak and slender. For even as a man does offend against the
princes parson by dispising his arms / seal or letters / so does a man
offend against Christ's body and blood / by abusing the sacrament of his
body and blood / although he be not there present / as the kings parson is
not present in his arms / seal or letters.

Besides that s. paul says that every man wc prays or p^cheth with covered
h^ed shameth his heed and his heed is christ: shall we therefore Image^ that
christ is naturallye in every man's he^^ / as your argument concludes For
soth that were a pretye pha^tas^e. Finally S. Aus^en sai^th that he does no
less sin wc negligentlye hears the word of god / the^ does the other wc
unworthily receyuith the sacrament of Christ's body and blood. Now if this
be true / the^ is your reason not worth a rishe / for christ's natural body
is not in the word wc is p^ched / as all men know. And yet he s^un^^h no
less that neglige^tly hears yt / the^ does he that unworthily receyuyth
the sacrament. And thus you see their insoluble easily dissolved.

But now must this young man consider again that him self confesses that the
cause for with himsellf says that christ in so saying did so mean / is because
that if he should have me^t so / yt was impossible to god to bring his
meanenynge a bought: that is to say / that christ's body might be in two
places at once. And therefore but if he prove that thing impossible for god to
do / else he confessyth that god not only said yt but also meant yt in deed.
And yet over this / if christ had never said yt / yet doubted I nothing / but
he is able to do yt / or else were there sum what that he could not do: And
the^ were god not allmyg^tye

Frith.
Here master more would mire me with his sophistry / and with wiles would win his
spores. For as he before did disca^t on these words / ca^ / and ^^possyble /
and would have made me^ believe that I me^t yt could not be / because yt could
not be by reason / and that I me^t yt was impossyble because reason could not
reach yt. So now he disputes wc like manner of sophisticatio^ co^cludinge that
I confess that yt is imposyble and ca^ not be / because that if god should so
have me^t / yt was impossyble for god to bring his meaning a bought. Dear
bretherne^ / this babelyng is suffecye^lye discussed all ready. For I me^t not
that yt was impossible. For god to bring yt about / if he hade so me^t / but
I me^t that yt is impossyble to sto^de with the process of the scripture wc we
have received. And I say more over that though yt was possible for god to have
do^ yt (if yt had pleased him) yet now / the scripture thus stondynge / yt is
imposs^ble for him to do yt for the^ he must make his sone a liar. And I say
/ that if he had so m^^t as the letter sto^dith / that he would the^ have geui^
us other scripture / and would not have said that he must deperte to hi^ that
sent him with other textes as are before reherssed.

And where master more says that if there were sumwhat that he could not do
/ tha^ were god not almighty. I say yt is ashame for our p^lates that they
have gotton such an ignorant proctoure to defend the^. And I am sure that
they them sellues could have said much better. For else how should they
enstructe other and lead the^ in the right way / if they the^ sellues were so
r^de and unlearned? should they not know what this means that god is almighty
wc is apece of the first article of our Creed / then how should there ship have
any sure sight? More thi^keth that god is called almighty / because he can
do all things. And then in deed yt should follow that he were not almightye
For all things he ca^ not do he can not save the unfaithful / he can not
restore virgynyte once vyolate / says s. Thomas and also (as I remember) s.
Hierom wrytinge of verginite unto paula and Eustoch^^^^he ca^ not sin says
dunce: he can not deney hymsellf says s. paul. ^. Tim. ^
Now if this ma^s lerninge were allowed the^ might not god be allmightye /
because there is su^what that he ca^ not do. But they that are a costomed with
scripture / do know that he is called almightye / not because he can do
allthing: but because there is no superior powere above him / but that he may
do all that he will: and all that his pleassure is to do that may he bring
to pass / And no power is able to resyst him But he has no pleassure nor will
to make his sone alyer ner to make his scripture ^alse / and in deed he may not
do yt. And yet notwtsto^ding he abides allmigtye ^ or he may do all that he
will.

Then master more touching the reason of repu^gnaunce says / that many things
may seame repugnaunt both to him and me wc things god sees how to make the^
stand to gether well enough / and adds such blind reasons of repungnau^ce
as induce many me^ in to a great error: some ascribyng all thing unto
destenye with out any power of ma^s frewyll at all / And some geuyng all to ma^s
owyn will And no fore sight at all to the providence of god / and all because
the poor blind reason of man can not see so far / as to perceive how gods
prescience and man's frewyll can stond to gether / but seem clearly to be
repungnant.

As For his degressio^ of man's frewyll I will not greatly wrestle with him.

But this one thing I may say / that if the sone of god deliver Joan. 8^

And as touchi^ge such textes of repu^gnau^ce / if they be so diffuse that
ma^s reason (wc is the lyht of his understanding) ca^ not attain to set the^
to gether / the^ were you best to make the^ none articles of our faith. For I

creed with I think every man believes: I beseech you lay no bigger burden

I am sure / we should have fewer heretics. For I never hard of heretycke that
ever held against any article of our Creed / but all that ye desfame / by

I wot well that many good folk have vsid in More.
this matt many fruitful examples / as of one face beholden in diverse glasses
/ and i^ every pe^e of one glase broken in to twenti: and of one word cominge
hole to an hundrethe ears at once: and the sight of one little eye present and
beholdinge an hole great contrye at once ^ with a thousand such meruelles mo /
such as those that see them daily done (and therefore meruell not at them)

reason by what mean they may be don / but that he may have such repugnau^ce
laid against yt ^ that he shall be fa^ne in conclusion (^or the ch^ffe and
most ^uident reason) to say / that the cause of all those things is because
god that has so caused them to be don / is allmightye of him sellfe / and may
do what hi^ li^t^

Frith.
As t^ouchinge the examples that master more does here allege ^ I may sone make
answer. For they that are like our matter ^ make cl^ne against him / and the
other can not make for hi^ The glase I grant is a good example. For even as
the glass does rep^sent the very face of man so does this sacrament
represent the v^rie body and blood of Christ. And like as every piece of the
glase does represent that one face / so does every piece of that sacrament
represent that one body of Christ. But eu^ry man knows right well that
though the glass rep^sent mi face / yet the substance of the glass is not my
very face / nether is my very face in the glass^. And even so though the
sacrament do represent the body of Christ / yet the substance of the
sacrament is not his ver^e body (no more then the glass is my face) n^ther is
his very body in the sacram^nt / no more th^n my very face is i^ the glass
and thus this example makes well for us. And for that o^e word coming hole
to an hundre^h ears / I say that word is but a sound and a qualite and not a
substance / and therefore yt is nothing to our purposse / and can not be
likened ^o Christ's body wc is a substance and as concerning the sight of the
little eye / I say^ that though the eye discrye and see an hole co^trye / yet is
not that hole contrye in the eye: but as the co^trie is known by the sight of
eye (though the contrye be not in yt). So is the death of Christ and his body
breaking and blood shedinge knowyn by the sacrament^ though his natural body
be not in yt. And thus his examples make nothing with him / but rather much
agayns^e him. And where he says that the young man him sellfe can give hi^ no
reason / by what mean they may be don: I may say unto his mastership / that
when I was seven year younger then I am ^his day / I would have been ashamed if
I could not have geuyn an evident reason at the austens in oxford before the
hole university. And albeyt I now wochesaffe / not to spend labor and paper
abought Aristoles doctrine / yet have I so much touched his examples / that he
may be werye of them.

Also I can not see why yt should be more repugnant More.
that one body may be by the power of God in two places at once / then that
two bodies may be to gether i^ one place at once. And that p^int I think this
young ^an denyethe not.

The being of our body in two places at once is agenst nature / and scripture
can not a low Frith:
yt. But that two bodies should be in one place seameth more reasonable. For I
have good experience that though my body can not be i^ two places at once
(both in the tower and where I would have yt beside) yet blessed be god in this
one place / I am not with ou^e company. But if master more mean that in one
proper and several place / may be two bodies at once / that I will deny /
till he have laiesure to prove yt. And yet at the length I am sure / his proffe
shall not be worth a podyng prycke. For I am sure yt must be, Ratione
porositatis ut in igne and ferro: na^ penetrationem dimen^ionum nunq probabit.
And then he is as nere as he was before.

More.
Now his last reason with wc he prou^th yt impossib^e for the body of chri^te to
be in two places at once / is this: you can (says he) show no reason why he
should be in many places at once and not i^ all. But in all places he can not
be. Wherefore we must conclude that he can not be i^ many places at on^e. This
is a mer^elous concluded argum^nt. I am sure that every chyld^ may sone see
that this consequent can never follow upon these two premises of t^is
antecedent.

Frith.
When I made this reason and co^piled mi treatise I had no regard to the
cauillacio^s of sot^e sophisters: for I thought no sophisters should have meddled
with that meat but nevertheless since now I per^^yne that they principallye are
porynge on ^t / seking some pray to set their teth a warke. In this book I
have sumwhat provided for them ^ and have brought such hard bones / that if
they be to bus^e / may chance to choke them And yet is not the argument so
feeble as he fayneth. For the first part (if he list to co^s^der the sense and
mind / and be not to curious) where I say that they can show no reason why
he should be in many places and not in all ^ is thus to be understood of wise
men / that the very reason and cause / that he should be in many places ^
must be because the body is so annexed with the godhed / that yt is in every
place as the godhed is. This I say must be the cause and reason of his being
i^ many places. And nether you nor no man else ca^ ^u^^l^e assign any other.
Now of this ma^or or f^^st proposition thus understand does the coc^usion
follow directlye. For if this should be the ca^se (as they must needs grant).
And this cause proved false by scripture: then must they ned^^ grant that the
thing which so follows of this cause / must needs be false. And so is my
purpose proved / and they concluded As by example / the astronomers say: that
the natural course of the son is from the west to the e^st. Now if a man
should ask them what is then the cause that we see him daily take the
contrary course / from the e^st to the west against his nature: they answer.
Because the ^eyghest spear (whose course is from the ^est to the west) with his
swifte mouynge does vyol^ntly draw the inferior speres with hi^. This is the
cause that they allege / and no man can assign any other. And now sith I can
prove this sense fallse by scripture. And S. Austen (for scripture says that
the spear is fastened Hebrews.vii^ Chapter. And s. Austen expoundinge that
text improueth the astronomers wc affirm that y^ moves (sith I say this
cause y^ proved false by scripture / they must needs grant that the thing wc
follows of this cause must needs be false. And so we may conclude against
the^ all / that the natural course of the son is not from the weste to the
^^st (as the astronomers say). But contr^rie from the eest to the west. And
likewise sith the cause that Christ's body sh^ld be in many places / is
assigned of learned men to be / because his body is so annexed with the Godhed
(w^ is in every place) that yt is also i^ all places with yt ^ and no man can
assygne any other. And that this cause is proved false by scripture / for when
the wom^n sought Christ at his grave / an angel gave the answ^r that he was
not there. Man. 14.
But if his bod^^ h^d been in euer^e place / then had the angel l^ed. Luc. ^6.
Also Christ said unto his disciples of Lazarus wc died at bathania. La^arus is
deed. ^an. 11.
And I am glade for your sakes (that you may believe) because I was not there.
Now if his body were in every place as is the Godhed / then Christ said not
truly / when he said he was not there. Therefore since (as I said) this is the
cause assigned / and yet proved ^alse by scripture / they m^ste needs grant /
that the thing wc follows of this cause / must also needs be false. And so
we may conclude against them all that Christ's bod^e is in one place only.
And now you may see how my consequent follow the premises.

More.
For he can no farther conclude / but that we can show no reason why he should
be in many places at once What had he wone by that? might he than conclude there
upon / that he could not be in many places at once? As though yt were not
possible for God to make his body in tw^ places at once / but if we were ab^e
to tell how / and why / and wherbye / and sh^we the reason.

How far I can conclude is showed imm^diatly before. Frith.
For though of the bare words as ye took them / yt was hard to conclude any
thing yet have I now declared them / and so far co^clud^d / that you can
not avoid them. And where he says that though they can show no reason / yet
I had wo^ne naught by yt: I think he would be angrye if I should so ans^er. But
surely they are in good case / for yt is enough for them to say / thus yt is /
and need never so show any cause or reason why they so say. For they are the
church and can not ^rre: so that if they teach contrary things / yet all is
good enough. And when they see that no man can make the scriptures to agree with
their doc^rine / then they say / that there doctrine is true enough / but no
man can understand the scripture. And though the scripture seem never so
repungnant both to the^ and to us / yet god sees well enough (say they) how
to set them to gether / and yt is possible for god to make yt agree / though
they can not tell how. But this doctrine has long enough desayued us. For men
have seen to long with your spectacles yet now (thanks be to god) they begin to
se with their ow^n ^yen. And as ^o^chinge how this matter was possible to god and
how yt is not possible / is suff^ciently declared before to all that list to
look.

More.
How be yt as for me (though I be not bound^ to yt) I am content yet to prove /
that god may make the body of Christ to be in all places at once. And because
this young man coupleth that proposityon with the the other: so will I do to. And I
prove therefore that god can make his body be both in many p^aces at once /
and in all places at once / by that that he is almightye / and therefore can do
all t^ynge.

Frith:
^ow is the good man in his old dream again ^ and thinks that god is called
al^mightye / because he can do all things. And then in deed yt s^uld ^olowe
that he were not alm^ghtie. For all things he can not do ^ he can not save
the unfaithful / he ca^ not restore / vginitye once violated / he can not
sin: he can not deny him sellfe. Now if this man's lerninge were allowed /
than might not god be called almighty / because there is sumwhat that he can
not do. But they that are accustomed with scripture / do know that h^ is called
almighty / not because he ca^ not do all things / but because there is no
superior power above him / but that he may do all that he will / and all that
his pleassure is / may he bring to pase. But he has no will / pleasure nor
power to make his sone a liar and to make his scripture false / and yet
natwtstonding he abides almightye and may do what he will. And even as yt is
impossible to sto^de with the process of the scriptures (where in god has
declared his will) that the unfaithful should be saved (although at the first
god might have do^ yt / if he had so would) likewise it is impossible the
scriptures sto^di^ge as they do / that the natural body of christ ^ should be
present to our teth i^ the sacrament. And as for our faith yt needs not to
have hi^ p^sent in the bred. For I may as well eat hi^ and drink him /
thorough faith (that is to say / believe in hi^) though he continue s^ill in
heuyn / as though he were as p^sent in the sacrament / as he was ha^ging on the
cross But yet his mastership has left ^ne thing unproven / and that is
euin the pith of his purposse. For though he had proved (as he has not) that
God by his almightines might make Christ^s body in many places / and in all
places / and in the sacrament / yet he forgotte to prove that god has so done.
And therefore albeyt I did grant him (as I will not) that he might so do / yet
thereof yt does not follow / that he has so do^ in d^de. For god may do many
things wc he does not. And therefore his argument does not prove his purpose
Now if he do but think that god has so don / I am well pleased and will not
put him to the pain to prove yt. For anon ye shall se hi^ so inta^gled in
briars / that he shall not wette where to be come

But ^et this young man gooeth about to prove the point by scripture. More^
For except we grant him that point to be true / he sa^eth that ^is we make
the angel a ly^ar that said / he is not here / and also that else we make as
though Christ's body in his assension did not goo up in the cloud in to heuyn
from ye^th^ but only hid him self in the cloud / and plays boo pipe and
tayried beneth still^ here in the e^de he forgets hi^ sellfe so foul / that
when he was a io^ge sophis^er he would I dare say / have ^yn full sore ashame^
so to have over seen him sellfe at oxford at a peruise. For ye wott well that
thing wc he says / and wc he must therefore prove / is that the body of
Christ can not be in every place at once by no mean that god could make. And
the textes that he bring^th in for the proffe / say no further but that he was
not in all places at once.

Frith.
There are two things disputed between master more and me: the one is whether
god can make the body of Christ in many p^aces / and in the sacrament. And
thereto his mastership says ye. For god is allmightye and may do all things.
And I say nay / and affirm that GOD is not called almightye because he may
do all things but because he may do all that he will / and I sa^e that he
will not make h^s son a lyear nor his scripture false / and that he can not
do yt and yet abides almightye. The the other thing is this / whether he have
done yt or not. For albeit I did grant him that yt were possible / yet is he
n^uer the nere / ^xc^pt he other can prove that he has done yt in deed / or
else think that god has so done. For as I said god can do many things with he
does not. And the controuers^e of this doubt is dissolved by the angel and
scripture with (as m^ster more grants him sellfe) proves that he was not in
all places at once And thereof yt follows / that god has not don yt /
although yt be possible. And so is his mastershype at a point. For if I should
grant yt never so possible / yet if scripture prove that yt be not so in deed
/ then is he never the nere his purpose / but much the further from yt. And
this y^ even yt that I said before: that yt was not possible to stand with the
process of the scripture wc we have received. And now his mastership has
granted yt himsellf / which you may be sure he would not do if he could
otherwise avoid yt^ And here you may se how sore I have over seen my sellfe.

God forbid that any man should be the more Mor^^
prone and ready to believe this young man in this great matter / because he
says in the begynyng that he will bring all men to a concord and aquietnes
of conscience. For he brings men to the worst kind of quietness that may be
devised when he tells us as he does / that every man in this matter / may with
out parell believe which way he list, Every man may in every matter with out
any counsel / sone set him sellfe at reaste / if he list to take that way
and to believe as he list him sellfe / and care not how But and if that way had
been sure / S. Paul would never have showed that many were in parell of
sekenes and death to. For lack of discernynge reverently the body of our lord
in that sacrament when they came to receive him.

When Christ should depart this world and Frith.
goo to his father he gave his disciples a commandment Joan. 1^
that they should love each other / saying by this shall all men know / that
ye are my disciples / if ye love each other / as I have loved you. This rule of
charity would I not have broken / wc notwtstondyng is often in Ieopardie among
faithful folk / for this sacrament of unite This thing con^^^ered / I
thought necessary / to advertise both parties to save this rule of charity /
and proved in the first chapter of my treatis^e / that yt was none article of
the faith necessary to be believed under pain of da^pnacion / and th^rfore
that they were to blame that would be contencious for the matter. For since yt is
non article of the faith / they may lawfullye dissent with out all Ieoperdye:
and need not to break the rule of charity / but rather to receive each other
like weak brethern. As by example / some think that the marriage between our
most redoubt^d prince and quen kateryn is lawful and may stand with the laws
of god: and some think that yt is unlawful and ought to be disanulled. Now if
we should for this ma^er break the rule of charit^ / and every ma^^ have his
neighbor that would not think as he does / then were we greatly to blame and
in Ieoperdie of co^^empnacion. This I say I proved in the first chapter
against wc more makes no business / and improue^h yt not Wherbye you may sone
gather that yt is very true. For else since his mastership so labors in
thesse other poynt^s / he would not have left that untouched / you may be
sure. This is the concord that I would bring the^ unto. And as touching
quietness of conscience / I have known many that have sore been co^bured with it
And among all / a certain master of art which dyed in oxforth / confessed
upon his death bed / that he had wept lying in his bed an hundredth nyghtes with
in one year space / because he could not believe yt. Now if he had known / yt
had been no necessary article / what comfort and quyetnes should yt have been
unto him. Furthermore every man can not so quiet hymsellf / as master more
Imageneth. For there are many that think the^ sellfes no small foles / wc

deed ma^s grave / he will not trede upon yt / although he should goo a forelonge
about. What is this but vain supersticyon wherewt the conscience is combred
and corrupted? May not this be weded out with the word of god / showing him
that it is none article of the faith so to think / and then to tell him that
yt is not forboden by the scripture / and that yt is no sin? Now albeit his
conscience be so ca^kerd that the ruste will not be rubbed out: yet with gods
grace / some other whom he has enfecte with the same / may come again to
gods word and be ^ured full well / wc should never have been able to quiet
themsellffes. And like wise there are some which believe as your suppersticious
hearts have informed them / and these can not quiet them selves / because they
believe that you have ^et your doctrine out of scripture / But when yt is proved
to the^ / and they themselves per^eyue that scripture says not so / the^ ca^
they be content to think the contrary / and Judge yt no sin at all And as
touching S. Paul / suerelye ye take him wrong. For I will show you what
process he takes / and how he his to be understood. But because yt is not
possible to fynyshe it in few words / I shall defer it unto the books end
/ and the^ I shall declare him at large.

More^
And what a facio^ is this / to say that we may believe if we list / that there
is the very body of our lord in deed / and the^ to tell us for a troth /
that such a faith is imposs^ble to betrue: For god him sellfe can never bring
yt abought / to make his body be there.

Frith.
If a man take the bare words of christ / and of simplicite be deceived / and
think that his veri^ body be in the sacrament present to their teth that ^ate
yt / I dare not say that he sins therein / but will refer the matter unto
gods Judgment / and yet with out doubt / I dare say he is deceived. As by
example / if a man deceived by the leterall sense / would thing that men should
preach to fyshes (as S. Frau^ces did) because christ bade his disciples goo
preach to all creatures / yet would not I think that he sinned therein / But
will refer him unto gods Indgeme^t. But yet I wene every woman that has
any wit / will say that he was deceived.

I am very sure that the old holy doctors More.
wc believed christ's body and blood to be there / and so taught other to
believe / as by there books plainly does apere. If they had thought either that
it could not be there or that yt was not there in deed / they would not for all
the good in this world have written as they have done. For would thosse holy
men (wene you) have taught that me^ be bound to believe / that the very body
and blood of christ is there / if them sellfe thought they were not bound
there to? would they make me^ honor and worship that thing as the very body
and blood of christ which them sellues thought were not yt? this ge^e is to
chyldishe to speak of.

That the old douctoures and faithful fathers so taught or thought as ye
feign of the^ / is very false. Frith^
For s. Austen as I have showed / makes whollye for us. Besides that / there
is none o^ the old fathers but they call yt a sacrament a mystery and
mystical meat / wc is not eaten with toth or belie: but with cares and faith. And
touching the honor and worship done unto yt. I say yt is plain Idolatrye.
And I say / that he falselye reports on the old holy doctoures. For they
never taught men to worship yt / nether can he allege one place in any of them
all which would have men to worship the sacrament. Peradventure he may allege
me certain new fellows for his purposse / as dunce / Dorbell / durand and
such draffe wc by there doctrine have drenched the world with dampnable
Idolatry But I speak of the old holy fathers and doctors Saint Austen /
Ambrose / Hi^rom / Cy^rian / Cirille / Chrysostom / Fulgentius / and such
other: these I say / do not teach men to worship yt / and by that I dare
abide. Of this ^oint I am so sure / that I will use yt for a contrary argument
/ that his natural body is not there present. For if the holy fathers before
named had taken this text after the letter and not only spu^allye / then in
there works they would have taught me^ to worshipe yt but they never taught
men to worship this sacrament / therefore yt follows they took not the text
after the l^tt^r / but only spu^allye. Now do I provoke you to seek a pro^fe
of your purposse. Nevertheless I will not deney / but that these holy
doctoures in diverse places / do call yt his body / as christ^ and paul do
/ and so do we likewise: and say also that his very body is there eaten. But
yet we mean / that it is eaten with faith (that is to say by believing that his
body was broken for Note
us) and have his body more in memory at this maundye the^ the meat that we
there eat.
And therefore yt has the name of his body: because the name yt sellfe should
put us in remembrance of his body / And that his body is there ch^flye ^aten
/ ^uyn more (thorongh faith) then the m^ate with the mouth. And so are they
also to be understand.

More.
Yet one great pleasure he does us / in that he ^utteth us all at lybertye /
that we may with out parell of dampnacyo^ believe as we did before: that is to
wit / that in the blessed sacrament the whole substance of the bred and the
wine is tra^sm^ted and changed in to the very body and blood of christ.
For if we may with out parell of dampnacyon believe thus / as him sell^e
grants that we may / the^ grau^teth he that we may also with out parell of
dampnacyo^ believe that him sellf lies / where he says / the troth of that
believe is impossible.

The beleuynge of this point / is of yt self not Frith.
da^pnable as it is not da^pnable to think that christ is a very stone or
auyne / because the leterall sense so says: or if you believe that you ought
to preach to fyshes and goo christen the^ a another while / as ye do belles.
And I insure you / if there were no worse mischef that ensued of this believe /
the^ yt is in yt self / I would never have spoken against yt. But now there
follows upon yt dampnable Idolatrye. For thorough the believe that this body
is there / me^ fall down and worshipe yt / And thynking to pleasse god / do
da^pnable sin against hi^ This I say / is the cause that I so ernestly write
against yt / to avoid the Idolatrye that is committed thorough yt. Part of
the germans do think that his natural body is present in the sacrament and
take the words fleshelye / as marte^ taught the^. But none of the^ worship yt
for that marte^ forbedeth both in his words and works / and so blessed be god
they avoid that Ieoperdie wc thing if you will also grant and publishe
but this one proposityon / that yt ought not to be worshipped / I promise you
I will never write against yt. For the^ is the Ieoperdie taken away / and
then I am content that your mastership think I lie. But in the mean season I
must think that ye fulfill the wordle with dampnable Idolatrye. And thus have
you also answer unto the conclusyon which you allege out of the kings graces
book. For I say in your way is no hurt / as long as you do but only
believe the bare words of ^h^ text (as S. Fraunces did / when he preached to
fishes. But if thorough the occasion of thosse words / ye fall in to the
worshypynge of yt / then I say that in your way is undoubted dampnacyon. And
so is there great Ieopardie in your way / and non at all in ours. For though
he were there in deed / yet do not we sin if we worship yt not / for we are
not commanded to worship the sacrament. But if he be not there / then do you
dampnable Idolatrye.

The consecracyon of the Sacrament.
More.
NOw as for a another quietness of every man's co^sciens this yongman byddeth every
man be bold / whether the blessed sacrament be consecrate or vnconsecrate (for
though he most specyallye speaks of the wine / yet he speaks yt of both)
and byddeth not ^are / but take yt for all that unblessed as yt is because the
pressed (he says) ca^ not deceive us nor take from us the profiet of christ's
ins^itucion / whether he alter the words or leave them all on said. Is not
this a wonderful doctrine of this young man. We wotte well all / that the
pressed can not hurt us by his oversight or malice / if there be no fault upon
our owin party / for that perfectyon that lacks on the prestes part / the
great mercy of god as we trust of his owyn goodness supplyeth. And therefore as
holy Chrysostom says / no man can take harm but of himself. But now if we
se the thing disordered our owyn sellfe by the pressed and Christ's institucion
broken / if we tha^ wittingly receive yt unblessed and unconsecrated / and care
not whether christ's institucio^ be kept and observed or no / but reakon yt is
as good with out yt as with yt / then make we our sellffes partakers of the fault
and lose the profit of the sacrament / and receive yt with dampnacyon: not for
the prestes fault / but for our owyn.

I had thought that no turk would have wrested Frith.
a man's words to vnfaythefullye for he leauith out all the pith of mi matter
for my words are these. I will show you a means how ye shall ever receive yt
according to Christ's institucion / although the pressed would with draw yt from
you. First ye need to have no respect unto the prestes words wc ministers
yt. For if ye remember for what intent Christ did institute this sacrament /
and know that yt was to put us in remembrance of his body breaking and
blood sheding / that we might give him thanks for yt and be as sure of yt
thorough faith according to his promises / as we are sure of the bread
b^eatinge of yt: if as I say / ye remember this thing (for wc intent only the
priest speaks those words) then if the pressed leave out those words or part
thereof / he can not hurt you. For you have all ready the effect and final
purpose for the wc he should speak the^. And again if he should wholly altre
the^ yet he ca^ not deceive you For then ye be sure that he is a lyear / and
though you se the pressed bring you the wine vnco^secrated yet never stick at
that. For as surely shall yt certify your conscience and outward senses
though he consecrate yt not (so thou consecrate yt the sellf^ that is to say /
so thou know what is meant therbye and give him thanks) as though he made a
thoussand blessings over yt. And so I say that yt is ever consecrated in his
heart that believes / though the pressed consecrate yt not. And contrary wise if
they consecrate yt never so much ^ and thy co^secracion be not bye / yt
helps the not a rishe. For except thou know what is meant thereby / and believe
/ geuinge thanks for his body breakinge and bloudshedynge / yt can not
profit the.

More^
Now where you say / that if we se the thing disordered by the pressed / and
Christ's institucyon broken / and wyttinglye receive yt / we make our selffes
partakers of the crime.

Frith.
I answer that if the reformacyon thereof lay in our hands / then said you
troth / but since this is writin to private parsones wc may not reform this
matter / and that the reformacyo^ thereof reasteth only in the hand of your
prince and parliament (for the error consists not in the misorderyng of the
matter by one pressed only but rather of the doctrine of the^ all / saving such
as god has lightened) to these p^uate persons I say that your doctrine should
sooner be the occasion of an insurrexion wc we labor to eshew) then any
quietinge of them by Christ's doctrine. And therefore sith there is an other
way to wode / saving all upright / we will avoid that parylous pathe. But
when ye se Christ's institucyon broken and y^ one kind left out unto ye lay
people / why ar ye partaker thereof?

How be yt as for his believe that takes yt no More.
better but fore bare bred and wine yt makes him little matter consecrated or
not / saving that the better yt is consecrated the more yt is ever noyous to
him that receyuyth yt having his co^sciens combred with such an execrable
heresy / by wc well aperreth that he puts no defference between the body
of our lord in the blessed sacrament / and the common bread that he eatyth at
his dynner / But rather he estemeth yt less. For the tone yet I think or he
begin / if he lack a pressed / he will bless yt him sellfe / the the other he
cares not as he says / whether yt be blessed or no.

What I reaken yt more then bred and wine Frith.
I will show you here after in declarynge the mind of S. paul upon this
sacrament / and that in the conclusion of this book. And in the mean season I
will say no more but that he be lies me. And as for there blessings and
co^secracion profit not me / except I consecrate yt my self with faith in
Christ's blood / and with geuynge him praise and thanks for his inestimable
goodness / which when I was his enemy reconciled me unto his father by his owin
death This consecracy^ ^ must I set by yt / if I will have any profyete of his
death wc the sacrament represents unto me. And if I my self do thus consecrate
yt / then shall I be sure of the fruit of his death. And I say again / that as
the prestes do now use to co^secrrate yt / yt helps not the poor come^s of a
rishe. For there co^secracio^ should stand in preachinge unto the^ the death of
christ wc has delivered them out of the Egypt of sin and from the fyry
furnace of Pharo the deuell. And as for their wagginge of there fingers over yt
/ and sayng, vi. or.vij. words in laten / helps them nothing at all for how
can they believe by the means of his words when they know not what he says?
And as touching the comen bread that I eat at my dynner / whether I have a
priest or not / I bliss yt with my heart (and not with my fyngers) and heartily
give God thanks for yt. For if I have an hundredth prestes to bless yt / yet
am not I excused therbye. For except I bless yt my sellfe / yt profits me no
more then if yt were unblessed. And if I bless yt my sellfe / than I care not
what the priest prate. For as long as I understand him not yt profits me
nothing. But in good faieth I wene the bushoppes and there proctoure w^te not
what a blessinge means. Therefore dear brethern hearkyn to me. To bliss god
/ is to give him praise and thanks for his benefits: to bliss a king or a
prence / is to thank him for his
kindenes / and to pray to god for him / that he may long reign to the lawde
of god and wealth of his co^mens. To bless
To bliss a man's neighbor is to pray for him and to do him good. To bliss
my bread or meat / is to give god thanks for yt To bliss my sellfe / is to
give god thank for the great benefits that I have received o^ him / and to
pray god that of his infinite goodness he will increase those gifts that he
has geuin me and fynishe his work wc he has begone in me / unto his lawde and
praise / and as touching this flesh / to fullfyll his will in yt / and not to
spare yt but scorge / cut and burn yt: only that yt may be to his honor and
glory. This is the form of blessing / and not to wage two fyngers over them.
But a lack / of this blessing our bushoppes be ignorant.

But as for those that are good and faithful More.
folk and have any grace or any sparcle of reason i^ there hedes / will (I
verily think) never be so far over seen / as in this article (the troth
whereof god has him sellfe testified by as many open miracles as ever he
testified any one) to believe this young man upon his baren reasons against
the faith and reason both of al^ old holy wryteres and all good christen
people this xv.C. years.

As for the miracles / I meruell not at them / Frith.
neither may they make me the sooner to believe yt for Christ told us before
that such delusions Mat. 14
should come / that if yt were possible / the very elect should be deceived by
them. 2 These. 2
And s. Paul exorteth us to be ware of such signs and wonders And therefore I
do as moses teaches me when Detrorm.
I here of such a wonder / then straight I look on the doctrine that is
annexed with yt. If yt teach me to refer all the honor to god and not to
creatures / and teach me nothing but that will stond with gods word / then
will I say / that yt is of god. But if yt teach me such things as will not
stond with his word / then will I determyne that yt is done by the deuell / to
deiude the people with damnable Idolatrye. Act. 24.
When Paul and Barnabas preached at Lystra and had don a miracle emonge them /
the people ran and would have don sacrifice unto them. But the apostles ran
among them and ^are their clothes cryinge unto them / syrs what you do? we
are even corruptible men as ye are and preach unto you / that you should la^ue
this vain superstition / and worship the leuynge god / wc made heaven earth /
the sea / and all that in the^^ etc. here the apostelles refused such honor
and worship. And therefore I am sure they would not suffer there Images to have
yt^ Now when I see a miracle done at any Image / and perceive that yt bri^geth
men to the worshipping of yt sellfe / contrary to the fact and doctrine of
the apostelles / which would not receive yt the^ selves / I must needs conclude
/ that yt is but a delusio^ done by the deuell to deceive us and to bri^ge the
wrath of god upon us. Euin so I say of the sacrament / since the miracles
that are done by yt / do make me^ think otherwise then scripture will / and
cause me^ to worship yt: I doubt not but they are done by the deuell / to
delude the people Thou will perauenture say that god will not suffer him to
abuse the sacrament of his body and blood. Yes verelye / god will suffer yt /
and does suffer yt / to see whether^ we will be faithful and abide by his
word or not. And meruell not there of / for god suffered him to take up the
very Math. 4
natural body of his son Christ and set him on a pynnacle of the temple.
And after he took him up again / and lead him to an exceeding mountain. And
therefore think not but that he has mo^e power over the sacrament then he hade
over Christ's owyn body. And therefore when they tell me / loo here is christ:
^oo there is christ (as Christ prophesied) loo he is at this auitre loo he is
at that / I will not believe them.

Nevertheless if I should grant that all the miracles which were done / and
ascrybed unto the sacrament / were very true miracles and done of god himsellf
(as I doubt not but some of them be true) yet there upon yt does not ^olowe
that the Sacrament should be the very, natural body of Christ. For we have
euydent stories that certain persons have been delivered from bodily diseases
thorough the sacrament of baptime. And yet the watter is not the holy ghost nor
the very thing yt sellfe whereof yt is a sacrament. Acts. ^
The shadow of Peter has healed many. And yet was not that shadow Peter's owyn
person We read also that napkyns and hand ^herchers were carried from Paul
unto them Acts. 1^
that were syke and possessed with unclean spiretes / and they received there
health. And yet yt were nevertheless madness / to think that Paul's body had
been actuallie or naturally in thosse things. And therefore this is but a very
weak reason / to Judge by the miracles the presence of Christ's body. And
surely you might be ashamed to make so slender reasons. For god may work
miracles thorough many things wc are not his natural body. And as touching
the old doctoures whom you feign to make with you / and the troth of your
opinyon wc you say has been believed of all good christian people this.xv.C.
years / is suffecyentlye declared before / and proved to be but a point of your
old poetrye.

Doctoure barnes did graciouslye escarpe master mores hands
More,
ANd also friar barnes albeyt that as ye wett well he is in many other things a
brother of this youngma^s sect: yet in this heresy he sore ab^orreth his
heresye or else he lies him sellfe. For at his last being here he wrote a
letter to me. Wherein he writes that I lay that heresy wrongfullye to his
charge. And shewyth him sellfe so sore grieved therewt that he says / he will
i^ my reproach make a book against me. Wherein he will profess and proteste his
faith concerning this blessed sacrament, But in the mean season yt well
contenteth me / that friar barnes being a man of more age. And more ripe
discrecyon and a doctor of divinity / and in those things better learned then
this yongma^ is / abhors this yongma^nes heresy in this point / as well as
he lyketh him in many other.

The more your mastershipe prayseth doctor Frith:
barnes / the worse men may like your matter. For in many poi^tes he does
co^de^pne your damnable doctrine / as in his book apereth. And therefore if
such crede^ce must be given to him / then much the less will be geuin to
you. But peradventure you will say / that he is to be believed in this point /
although he err in other. Where unto I answer that if you will consent unto him
I would be well
apayd and will promise you to wryt no more in that matter. For in this we both
agree / that yt ought not to be worshipped (ye and blessed be god all the other
whom you call heretyckes). And so both of us do avoid the Idolatrye wc you wc
so great danger do daily commit. And therefore if you allow his lerning then
am I content that you dissent from me. For let yt not be worshipped / and
think as you will: for then is the parell paste. And since we agree in this
point / doubt not but we shall sone agree in the residou and admit each other
for faithful brothers. And where your mastership says / that he wrote you a
letter prote^tinge that you lay that heresy wrongfullye to his charge. I
think yt was more wisdom for him twice to have written to you / then once to
have comen and tell you of yt. For yt was plainly told him / that you had
conspiryd his death / and that notwtstondinge his saffe conduyte / you were
minded to have murdered him. And for that cause he was compelled both being
here / to keep him sellfe secreatlye / and also preuelye to depart the realm.

And blessed be god you have suffecie^t^ye publyssed your purposse in your
answer against W tindale / where you say / that you might lawfullye have
brun^e him. Here me^ may see how perciable you are addicte to our prelates.
And how prone ye were to ful^yll there plea^ures contrary to our princes
p^rogatiue royal. And thanks be to god wc gave you such grace in the sight
of our soueraig^e / that ^e s^^rt^ye wtdrewe your power. For else yt is to be
^eared that you would further have proceeded against his graces p^rogatiue / wc
thing whether yt be treason or not let other men d^fyne. But this I dare say
/ that yt is printed and publyshed to our princes great dishonore. For what
l^rn^d man may in time to come trust to his graces saffe co^^uyte or come at
his graces insta^ce or request / since not only the spu^allye (wc of there
profession resy^^e his prerogative) but also a lay man promoted to such
prominence by his graces goodness / dare presume so to depresse his prerogatyue
/ and not only to say / but also to publishe yt in pre^t: that notwtstondyng
his graces saffe conduyte / they might lawfullye have burnte him.

But here he would say unto me as he death in his book / that he had forfayted
his saffe co^duyte and therbye was fallyn in to his enemies hands. Where unto
I answer / that this your saying is but a vain gloss. For I my sellfe did
read the saffe co^duyte that came unto him / wc had but only this one
condition annexed unto yt / that if he came before the feast of christmas the^
next insuynig / he should have fre lyberte to deperte at his pleasure. And this
co^dicyo^ I kn^we was fullfylled, How should he than forfayte his saufe
conduyte? But master more has learned of his masters our p^lates (whose
procture he is / to depresse our princes p^rogatiue) that men ought not to
keep any promise with heretyckes. And so his sa^fe co^duyte cold not save him As
though the kings grace might not admit any man to goo and come frelye in to
his graces realm / but that he must have leave of our p^lates. For else they
might lay heresye against the parson / and so ^ley him contrary to the kings
salfe co^duyte wc thing all wise me^ do know / to be prejudicial to his
graces prerogative ro^all. And yet I am sure that of all the time of his being
here / you can not accuse him of one crime / albeit (unto your shame) you say
that he had forfayted his salfe conduyte. These words hade be very extreme and
worthy to have been ^oked upon / allthough they had been wretyn by some
presumptuo^s prelate. But that a lay man so heighlye promoted by his pryn^e /
should speak them and also cause them openly to be publyshed among his graces
comes / to de^ecte the estymacyon of his royal power / does in my mind /
deserve ^orrection. Natwithstondynge I leave the iudgem^nt and determinacyon
unto the discrecyon of his graces honorable counsel.

And as for that holy prayer that this devout More.
yo^gma^ as a new christ teaches to make at the receiui^ge of this blessed
sacrament / all his co^gregacio^: I would not give the pari^ge of a pare for his
prayer / though yt were better the^ yt is / pulling away the true faith
therfro / as he does. How be yt his prayer there is so dyuised and pe^ned and
painted with laysure and study / that I trust eueri good christian woman makes
a much better prayer at the time of her howsell / by faithful affectyo^ and
by gods good inspiracio^ sode^lye. Fryth is an unmeet master to teach us
what we should pray at the receyui^ge of the blessed sacrament / when he will
not knowelege it as it is / but take christ's blessed body for nothing but
bare bred / and so little esteem the receyuyng of the blessed sacrament / that
he forsyth little whether yt be blessed or not.

Frith.
Where he disco^mendyth my prayer and says that I am an unmeet master to
teach me^ to pray / seeing I take away the true faith from yt / and says
that every woman ca^ make a better / when she receyuyth the sacrament. I would
to god that every woman were so will learned that they could teach us both.
And sureli I intended not to prescrybe to all men that prayer only but hoped
to help the ignorant / that they might either speak those words / or else
(taking occasion at the^) to say some other to the lawde and praise of god,
And as for your faith (wc you call the true faith) mus^e I needs improve. For
yt will not stand with the true text of scripture as yt playn^^ apereth. But to
the faith in christes^ blood I exhort all me^ / and teach the^ to eat his
body with fayeth (and not with teth) wc is by having his death in contynuall
remembrance / And degestynge yt in to the bowels of the soul. And because you
so sore improve mi prayer / to conclude my answer against you / I will write
again. And let al me^ Judge betewne us. Blessed be thou most dear and
merciful father wc of thy tender favor and benignite / not wtsto^ding our
grievous enormytis committed against the / wouchsauedst to send thyn owine and
only dear sone / to suffer most vile death for our rede^ptio^. Blessed be
thou Christ Jesus our lord and savior wc of thine abunda^t petye considering
our miserable estate / willyngly tokest upon the to have thy most innocent
body brokin and blood shed / to purge us and wash us wc are ladyn with
iniquite. And to certify us thereof / have left us not only thy word wc may
enstruce our hearts: But also a visible token to certify eue^ our outward
senses of this great benefyte that we should not doubt / but that the body and
fruit of thy passion are ours (thorough faith) as surely as the bread / which
by our senses we know that we have with in us. Blessed be also that spirit of
verite which is sent from god our father thorough our savior Christ Jesus / to
lyghten our dark ignorance / And lead us thorough faith in to the knowelege
of him which is all verite. Strength we beseech the our frail nature and
increase our faith: that we may praise god our most merciful father and
Christ his son our savior and redemer.

AMEN.
The paschal lamb and our sacrament are here compared to gether.
NOw we shall shortly express the pith of our matter and borow the figure of
the paschall lamb. Which is in all poi^tes so like. That the offeringe of the
pascall lamb did signyfye the offering of Christ's body / is plain by Paul
which says Christ our paschall lamb is offered up for us 1. Cor. 5.
When the childern of Israel were very sad and heuye for their sore appressyon
under the power of Pharrao (for the mo miracles were showed / the worse were
they handeled). God sent unto them by ^oyses / that eu^ry hows^old should kyl a
lamb to be a sacrifyce unto GOD and that they should eat him / with their
staves in their hands / there loins gyrded and shows on their fee^e: euin as
men that were going an hastye Journey. This lamb must they eat hastelye and
make a merye maundye. Now because they should not say / that they could not be
merye^ For there oppressyon / and what could the lamb help them: he added glad
tidings unto yt and said / this is the passing bye of the lord. Which this
night shall pass by you and ^^e all the first begotton / with in the Lond^ of
Egypt / and shall deliver you out of your bondage / and bring you in to the
land that he has promissed unto your fathers. Mark the process and
conueyaunce of this m^ter / for even like wisse yt is in our sacrament. The
aposteles were sad and heuye / partlye considering the bondage of sin w^erwt
they were oppressed and partlye because he told the^ that he must depute from
the^ in who^ they did put all their hope of Joan. 1^.
there deliverance. W^yle the^ were in this heaviness / Christ thought to comfort
them and to give them the seal of their delyueraunce / and took in his hand
bred / blessed and brake yt / and gave yt to his disciples saying: this is my
body wc shall be geuyn for you. For this night shall the power of pharo the
dewell be distroyed / and to morrow shall you b^ delivered from the egypt of
sin ^ and shall take your iourneye toward that heuenlye mansion which is
prepared of of god for all that love him. Now compare the^ to gether.

The paschal lamb was institute and eaten the night before the chyldern of
Israel were in deed delivered from egypt, Like wise was the sacrament
institute and eaten the night before we were delivered from our sins.

The paschal lamb was a very lamb in deed And so is the sacrament very bread
in deed.

The pasch^l la^be was called the passing bye of the lord which distroyed the
power of pharo and delivered the^. The sacrament is called the body of the
lord which distroyed the power of the deuell and delivered us.

As manny as did eat the pascal lamb in faith / were very merye and gave god
great thanks. For they were sure the next day to ^e delivered out of egypt /
as many as did eat his sacrament in faith / were merye and gave God great
thanks / for they were sure the next day to be delivered from there sin.





They that believed not the next day to be delivered

sacreficed but once for all though ye sacrament thereof be daily broken among
us to keep ye benefit in continual memory.



As many as did eat of that paschal lamb did magnify their god / testifienge
that he only was the god almighty / and they his people styckinge to him /
to be delivered by his power from all danger. As many as do eat of this
sacrament do magnify their god testifying that he o^lie is the god allmightiy
and they his people styckinge by hi^ to be delivered by his power from all
danger.

that have such a merciful GOD.

The paschal lamb after their deliverance yt was yerlye eaten / brought as
much mirth and Joy unto the^ that did eat yt in faith / as yt ded to their
^athers wc felt pharo his fury / and were not yet delivered. For they knew
right well that except god of his mercy and wonderful power had so del^uered
them they should also them sellfes have been bond in the land of Eg^pt and
under that wicked prince Pharo / of wc bondage they greatly reioysed to be rid
all ready / and thanked God h^elye because they found them sellfes in that
plentuose Land wc god provided for the^. The sacrament wc after our
delyueraunce is yerlye and daily eaten / bringyth as much mirth and Joy unto
us that eat yt in faith / as it did to the apo^teles wc were not yet
delivered. For we know right well that except god of his merc^e and thorough
the blood of his son / had so del^uered us / we should also our sellffes have
been bound in the egi^t of sin under that wicked prince the devil / of with
bondage we greatly rejoice to be ryd all redye / and thank God hyelye because
we find our sellues in the state of grace and have received thorough faith the
first ^ructes and a taste of the spiret wc testifyeth unto us that we are y^
childern of God.

This maundie of remembrance was yt that paul received of the lord and
del^uered to the corinthians in the.xi. chaptre. For though he borowe one
property and similitu^e of the sacrament in the, x. chapter / that in my mind
makes nether with us nor against us / albeit some think that yt makes hole for
the exposicio^ of christ's words / this is my body. 1. Cor ^1
But in my mind they are deceived. ^or the occasion that paul spoke of yt in
the.x. chapter was this. The Corinthians had knowelege that all meats were
indifferent and whither yt were offered to an Idol or not / that the meat was
not the worse / and that they might lawfullye eat ^f yt / whether yt were
sold them in the shambles or set before them when they dyned or souped in an
unfaithful man's house / asking no questyons: except some man did tell them
that yt was offerred to an Idolle / and then they should not ^ate of yt for
offendynge his conscience that so told them (albe yt they were else fre and the
thing indifferent) this knowelege because yt was not annexed with charity was
the occasyon of great offendyng. For by reason thereof they sat down among
the gentyles at there feasts / Where they eat in the honor of their Idolles /
and so did not only wound the conscyens of their weak brethren / but also
committed Idolatrye / in deed: And therefore s. paul said unto the^. Paul
My dear beloved fle from worshyppinge of idolles.
I speak unto the wc have discrecio^ Judge ye what I say. Is not the cup of
blessing wc we bliss the fellowship of the blood of christ? is not the bread
wc we break the f^llowship of the body of Christ? For we though we be many
are yet one bred and one body / in as much as we are partakers of one bred.
Christ did call him sellfe bred and the bread his body: And here Paul
calls us bred and the bread our body Now may you not take Paul that he in
this place should derectly expound Christis mind. And that the very exposicion
of Christ's words / when he said this is my body / should be that yt was the
fellowship of his body (as some say wc seeking the kaye in this place of
paul lock them sellffes so fast in / that they can find no way out) For
Christ spoke those words of his owyn body wc should be geuyn for us / but
the fellowship of Christ's dodye (or congregacyo^) was not geuyn for us. And so
he meant not as P^ule here says / but meant his owyn body. For as Paul
calls the bred our body for a certain property / even so does Christ
call yt his body for certain other properties In that the bread was broken /
yt was christ's owyn body signifying that as that bred was broken / so should
his body be brokyn for us. In that yt was distributed unto his disciples yt
was his owyn body / signifyinge that as verelye as that bred was destrib^ted
unto them / so verelye should the death of his body and frutte of his passion
be distributed to all faithful folk. In that the bred strengthens our
bodies yt is his owin body / signiyfing that as owre bodies are strengthened
and comforted by bred / so are owre sowles by the faith in his body breki^g
And likewise of the wine in that yt was so distrib^ted and so comforts us and
makes us merye. Furthermore the bred and wine have a another property / for
the wc yt is called our body. For in that the bred is made one bread of many
graynes or corns / yt is our body signifieng that we though we be many / are
made one bread that is to say one body. And in that the wine is made one wine
of many grapes / yt is our body signifieng that though we are many yet in
christ and thorough Christ we are made one body and members to each other.
But in this thing Paulle and Christ agree. For as Paul calls the bread our
body and us the br^d because of this property that yt is made one of many
euin so does Christ call yt his body because of the propertyes before
rehearsed. Furthermore in this they agree / that as Paulles words / must be
taken spu^allye (for I think there is no man so mad / as to Judge that the
bred is our body in deed although in that property yt rep^senteth our body).
Even so must Christ's words be understand spirituallye that in thosse
properties yt represents his very body. Now when we come to gether to
receive this bread then by the receiving of yt in the congregation / we do
openly testify that we all (wc receive yt) are one body / professing one god
/ one faith and one baptyme / and that the body of Christ was broken and his
blood shed for remission of our sins Now since we so do / we may not a
company nor sit in the congregation or fellowship of the^ that offer unto
ydolles and eat before them. For as Paul says / ye can not drink the cupe
of the lord and the cupe of the deuells: Paul.
ye can not be partakers of the table of the lord and of the table of the
deuylles. I would not that you should have fellowship with deuelles. The hethen
which offerred unto Idolles were the fellowship of deuellis / not because they
eat the deuelles body or dra^ke the deueles blood / but because they believed
and put their confydens in the ydole or devil as i^ their god and all that
were of that faith hade their ceremonies / and gave heart ye thanks to their
god with that feast wc they kept. They came to one place and broug^t their meat
before the Idol and offered yt. And with their offering gave unto the devil
godly honor. And then they sat down and eat the offering to gether geuyng
praise and thanks unto their God / and were one body and one fellowship of
the deuell which they testiffye by eating of that offeringe before that
idolle. Now does s, Paul reprehend the Corinthia^s for berynge the gyntiles
company in eatinge before the idolle. For they know that the meat was like
other meat. And therefore though them sellues fre to eat yt or leave yt. But
they perceived not that that congregacyon was the fellowship of deuelles wc
were there gathered (not for the meat sake) but for to thank and praise the
ydolle their God in whom they had their confidence. And all that there
assembled and did there eat / and did openly testifye / that they all were one
body / professynge one faith in their god that ydolle, So pauie rebuked them /
for because that b^ their eating (in that place and fellowship) they testified
openly / that they were of the deuelys body and reioysed in the ydolle their
god in whom they had faith and confidence And therefore says paul / that they
can not both drink the cupe of the lord testifynge him to be their God in
whom only they have trust and ^iau^ce / and the cupe of the deuell
testifyinge the Idolle to be their god and refuge.

Here you may note that the meat and the eatinge of yt in this place and
fellowship is more then the common meat and eating in other places. For el^
they might lawfullye have dronken the deuelles cup with them the one day / and
the cup of the lord the next day with his disciples. What was yt more verelye
yt was meat wc by the eatinge of yt in that place and fellowship / did
testify openly unto all me^ / that he was there god whos^e cup they drank /
and before whom they eat in that fellowshyp: and so in their eating they
praised and honored the idol, And therefore they that had their trus^e in the
leuinge god and in the blood of his son Christ / might not eat with them.
And likewise yt is in the sa^rament / the bread and the eatinge of yt in the
place and fellowship where yt is ^eceyued / is more then comen bred. What is yt
more? Uerelye yt is bread which by the eatinge of yt in that place and
fellowship / does testy^ye openly unto all men / that he is our very God
whose cup we drink and before whom we eat in that fellowship / and that we
put all our fyaunce in him and in the blood of his son Christ Jesus /
geuinge god all honor and infinite thanks for his great love where with he
loved us / as is yt testified / in the blood of his son / wc was shed for
our sins. So that in this place and fellowship may no man eat nor drink
with us / but he that is of our faith and knowelegeth the same god that we do.
As by example / if man were well beloved emonge his neighbors (albe yt he
have some enemies) and were long abs^nt from his friends in a strange
contrye: when he were come home / his neighbors that loved hi^ would greatly
rejoice and peradventure would bi^ a copo^ or a another piece of meat to give
him his welco^ home / and get the^ to some honest ma^s house or to a tavern /
and make good chere to gether / to testify openly that he is welcome home /
and that they all which are at that ba^ket rejoice of his cominge home. Now I
say / that this banquet is more then another meal / for at this banquet his
enemies may be loath to come / because they can not rejoice at his cominge home
/ and therefore can not make good chere among them / testifying that he is
welcome home: but reather abhors the meat and drink that is there eaten
because their heart does not favor the parson for whose sake yt is prepared.
Natwtstondinge if a capons leg were reserved for one of his enemies and
afterward geuyn him when the banquet were don / he might lawfullye eat yt. For
then yt were but bare meat such as he eatyeh home. And likewise the enemies
of christ which believe not that they have remissyon of sins thorough his
blood sheding / can not reioise of his body breaking. And therefore can not
make good chere among them / but if any be reserved after the maundye / he
may lawfullye eat yt for yt is but bred. And his loueres that are there
present do rather come thider to give hi^ his welcome home then for the meat /
and they more eat his welcome home then the meat. But if any of his enemies
fortune to be there / they eat only the meat / and not his welcome home. For
they rejoice not at his coming home. Likewise the faithful that are there
present / do rather come thither to rejoice in the faith of his body breakyng
/ then in breakinge or eatinge of the bred or meat. But if any of the
unfaithful fortune to be there they eat only the bread / and not his body
breakyng. For they rejoice not at his body breakinge. Here peradventure some
would suppose that I were contrary to my sellfe. For before I said / that yt
was more then meat that was ^aten at the gentiles feast / and more then meat
that was eaten at my neighbors welcome home / and more then bred that is
eaten at the receiving of the sacrament of the body and blood of christ. And
now I say / that if a ma^s enemy be there / he eats only the meat and
not the welcome home. And likewise the unfaithful eats only bread and not
the body and blood of Christ. How may these words stand to gether? I
answer / that they eat but only bred or meat that profyteth them / but in
deed they eat more to their hynderaunce / and even there owyn dampnacyon. For
they that did eat in the fellowship of gentiles / dit but only eat the meat
to there profit / but in eating their meat their fact did openly testyfye
that they honored that Idolle for there GOD (althought their heart were other
wise) wherein they committed Idolatrye. 1. Cor. ^
And besides that they wounded the co^scyences of their weak brethern and so
sinned against God. Besides that / he that enuieth his neighbor and comyth to
that banquet / ^ateth but only the meat that profits him: natwtstonding in
his owe^ heart / he eats the rancor and malice of his mind / to his great
greuaunce / when he sees them so rejoice. And of his owe^ co^panyo^s wc are
also these man's enemies / he does purchase himsellfe hatred / because with his
fact he testyfi^th that he loves him / although his heart be wotherwise / and
of god shall be conde^pned. For he that hat^th his brother / is a murderer.
Furthe^more he that is unfaithful and comyth to the manudie 1. Joan. 3
/ eats but only the bred that profits him / notwtstondyng he eats beside
that his owyn dampnacyon / because he believes not that the body of our
savior wc the sacrament represents / is broken for his sins / and his
bloudeshed / to wash the^ away. This I am compelled to do / to stope the
chat^ringe mouths of sophisters / albe yt to the^ that he sober / yt had been
enough to have said / they eat only bred / and not the body breaking etc.
For they right well vndsto^d yt by the co^^rarye antithesie / and know that I
me^t not by that (only) that he should eat the bread and nothing else but
only bred: but that I me^t by this word (only) that he should eat the bread
with out the body / And so likewise in other examples. Thus have we
suffecientlie declared paul's mind in the.10. Chapter.

In the.xi. chapter paul makes much me^cio^ of the mau^di^ and discribeth yt
to the vttermoste. 1. Cor. 11.
First (he says) when ye come to gether i^ one place / a man ca^ not eat the
lords souper. For every man begynnyth before to eat his owyn souper / and one
is hou^grye and an other is dronke^. Have ye not howses to eat and dri^ke in?
or else dispice ye the co^grigacio^ of god and shame the^ that have not what
shall I say unto you? shall I praise you? In this I praise you not. Paul did
instruct according to christ's mind / that the Corynthians should come to
gether to eat the lords souper Which lies not so much in the carnal
eating as in the spiritual: and is greatly dyssyred to be ^ate^ / not by the
hou^ger of the body / but by the hounger of the faithful heart. wc is gredye
to publyshe the praise of the lord and give him hearty thanks / and move
other to the same that of many / praise might be geuin unto our most merciful
father for the love wc he showed us in the blood of his owi^ most dear son
christ jesus. Wherwt we are washed from our sins and suerlie sealed unto
euerlasti^ge liffe. with such hou^ger did christ eat the paschal land /
saying to his diciples: I have inwardlye dessired to eat this ester lamb with
you before that I suffer. Luc. 2^.
Christ's inward desire was not to fill his bellye with his disciples / but he
had a spu^all honger: both to praise his father with the^ / for their bodelie
deliverance out of the land of egypt: and specially to alter the paschal
la^be and memory of the carnal deliverance / in to a mau^die of mirth and
tha^^ giving for our spu^all deliverance out of the bondage of synn^ In so
much that when christ knew that yt was his fathers will and pleasure / that
he should suffer for our ^innes (wherein his honor / glory and praise should be
published) then was yt a pleasure unto hi^ / to declare unto his disciples that
great benefit / unto hi^ fathers praise and glory: and so did institute that
we should come to gether and break the bread in the remembrance of his body
breaking and bloudeshedi^ge: and that we should eat it to gether reioysinge with
each other and declari^ge his bn^fites^

Now were the corinthians fallin from this hou^ger / and ca^ not to gether to
thente^t that gods praise should be published by the^ in the mids of the
congrygacion / but ca^ to feed their flesh and to make carnal chere. In so
much that the rich would have meat and drink enough / and take such
aboundau^ce that they would be dronke (and so made yt there owyn souper and not
the lords / as paul says / and did eat only the bread and meat / and not
the body breaking as I said before) and the poor which hade not (that is to
say that had no meat to eat) where shamed and hongrye / and so could not
reiose and praise the lord: by the reason that the delicate fare of the rich
was an occasion for the pore eo lament their pourtye and thus the rich did
nether praise god themselves / nor suffered the poor to do yt / but were an
occasion to hinder them.

They should have brought their meat and drink and have divided yt with their
poor brothern / that they might have been merry to gether / and so to have geuyn
the^ occasion to be merye and rejoice in the lord with thanks geuinge. But they
had nether lust to praise god nor to comfort their neighbor. There faith was
feeble and their charity cold / and had no regard but to fill their body and
feed there flesh: And so despised the poor congrygacion of god whom they
should have honored for the spyrite that was in the^ and favor that god had
showed indifferentlye unto them in the blood of his son christ. When Paul^
perceived that they were thus fleshly minded and had no mind unto that
spu^all maundye which chefelye should there be advertised / he reproves the^
sore / rehersinge the words of christ That wc I gave unto you I received of
the lord. For the lord Jesus the same night in the wc he was betrayed / took
bred and thanked and brake yt and said: take ye and eat ye / this is my body
wc is broken for you / this do ye in the remembrance of me. After the same
manner he took the cup when souper was don saying / this cup is the new
testament in my blood / this do ye as often as ye drink yt in the remembrance
of me. For as often as ye shall eat this bred and drink this cup / ye shall
show the lords death / till he come. As though he should say / ye corinthians
are much to blame wc at this souper seek the foede of your flesh. For yt was
institute of christ / not for the intent to noryshe the belie / but to
stre^ghthe^ the heart and soul in god. And by this you may know that christ
so me^t. For he callyth yt his body wc is geuin for you / so that the name yt
sellf might testify unto you / that in this souper you should more eat his
body wc is geuyn for you (by digestyng that in to the bowelles of your soul)
the^ the breed wc by the breaki^ge / and the distributyng of yt / does rep^sent
his body breaki^ge and the distributyng theroff unto all that are faithful.
And that he so means is euydent by the words following / wc say / this do
in the remembrance of me: and likewise of the cup. And finally ^oncluding of
both / Paul says / as often as ye shall eat this bread and drink this cup
(in this place and fellowship) ye shall show the lords death until he come /
praisinge the lord for the death of his son and exortinge other to do the
same / reioysinge in him with infinite thanks And thefore ye are to blame wc
seek only to feed the bellye with that thing wc was only institute to feed the
soul. And there upon yt followyth.

Wherefore who so ever does eat of this bred or dri^ke of this cup unworthily
/ is giltye of the body and blood of the lord. He eats this bread
unworthily / wc regards not the purpose for the wc Christ did ins^itute yt.
wc comith not to it with spu^all honger / to eat thorough faith his very body
/ wc the bred represents by the breaking and distributinge o^ yt: which
comith not with a merye heart geuinge God hartye thanks for their deliverance
from sin: Which do not much more eat in their heart the death of his body
/ then they do the bred with their mouth. Now since the Corinthians did only seek
their belly and flesh / and forgot gods honor and praise (for which ^t was
institute / that thanks should be geuyn by the remembrance o^ his body
breakinge for us) they eat yt to gods dishonor and to their neighbors
hinderrance / and to there owin condempnacion / and so for lack of faith were
g^ltye of Christ's body wc (by faith) they should there cheffelye have eat^n
to there souls health. And therefore yt followith.

Let a man therefore examyne him sellfe / and so let him eat of the bread /
and drink of the cup.
THis proving or examinynge of a man's self is first to think with him sellfe
with what lust and disyre he comyth unto the maundye and will eat that b^ed:
whether he besure that he is the child of god and in the faith of Christ: And
whether h^s consc^ence do bear him wytnes that Christ's body was brokyn for
him: And whether the lust that he has to praise god and thank him with a
faithful heart in the mids of the brethern / do drive him thither ward. Or
else whether he do yt for the meats sake or to keep the custom: for then were
yt better that he were awye. For he that eats or drinks unworthily /
eats and drinkethe his owyn da^nacyon / because he makes no difference of
the lords body. That is / as yt is said before / he that regards not the
purpose for which it was institute / and puteth no defference between this
eat^ng and other eating (for other eating does only serve the bellye) but
this eating was institute and ordained / to sarue the soul and inward man.
And therefore he that abuses yt to the flesh / eats and drinks his owyn
dampnacyon, And he comyth unworthily to the maundye where the sacrament of
Christ's body is eaten: ye / where the body of the lord is eaten / not
^arnallye with the teth and b^llye but spiritually with the heart and faith. Upon
this follows the text that master More allegeth and wresteth for his purpose.

For this cause many are weak and sike among you / and many sleep. If we
had truly Judged our selves / we should not have been Judged When we are Judged
of the lord / we are chastened because we should not be dampened with the world
Wherefore my brethern / when ye come to gether to eat / tarry one for another.
If any man hunger / let him eat at home / that ye come not to gether unto
condempnacyon.

For this cause (that is) for lack of good examininge of our selves (as is
before touched) many are weak and syke in the faith / and many sleep / and
have lost their faith in Christ's blood / for lack of remembrance of his
body breaking and blood shedinge: ye and not that only but many were weak
and sike even stricken with bodily diseases for abusinge the sacrament of his
body / eatinge the bred with their teth and not his body with their heart and
mind and peradventure some slain for yt / by the s^rocke of god. wc if they
had truly Judged and examined the^ selves for what intent they came thither and
why yt was institute / should not have been so Judged and chastened of the lord.
For the lord does chasten / to bring us unto repentance and to mortify the
rebellious members / that we may remember him Here ye may shortly perceive ye
mind of Pau^e.

Finis.
An Epitome and short rehersall of all this book showing in what points Frith
dissenteth from our prelates.
NOw to be short / in these.iij. points frith dissenteth from our prelates and
from master More wc takes upon him to be their proctoure. 1. Cor. 1^
First by the scripture of Paul / wc calls yt bred saying the bread wc we
break / is yt not the fellowship of the body of christ? For we though we be
many / are yet one body and one bred / as mannye as are partakers of one
bred. 1. Cor. ^
And again he sa^eth / as often as ye eat of this bred or dri^ke of this
cup / you shall show the lords death vn^yll he come. Also luke callethe yt
bred saying in the Acts Acts. ^
they continued in the fellowship of the aposteles / and in the breakinge of
the bread and prayer. Mat. 2^
Mar. 1^
Luc. 22.
Also Christ called the cup the fruit of a vine / saying I shall not from
hence forward drink of the fruit of the vine until I drink that new in the
ki^dom of my father.

Furthermore nature does teach you that both the bred and wine contin^e in
their nature. For the bred muldeth if yt be kept long / ye and wormis bred in
yt. And ye poor mouse will run away with yt and eat yt / wc are evidence
enough that there remaynith bred. Also the wine if yt were reserved / would wax
sower / as they confess them selues^ And therefore they howsell the lay people
/ but with one kind only: because the wine can not continue nor be re^^rued to
have ready at hand / when need were. And surely as y^ there remained no bred
/ yt could not mould nor wax full of worms / even so if there remained no wine
/ yt could not wax sower. And therefore yt is but faulse doctrine tha^ our
p^lates so long have taught and published.

Finally that there remains bred / might be prouyd by the auctorite of many
doctoures with call yt bred and wine / even as Christ and his appostelis ded
And though some sophisters would wreste their saying / and expound the^ after
their owyn ^hantas^e / yet shall I allege the^ one doctoure wc was pope / that
makes so plain with us that they shall never be able to avoid him.

Gelasiuus in conci^io To.
For pope Gelasius writes on this manner. Certe sacrame^ta q sumimus corporis
and sanguinis Christi^ diuinae res sunt, propter quoth and per eade^ diuinae
efficimur co^sortes naturae. Et tame^ no^ de^init esse substa^tia uel natura
panis et uini, sed permanet in suae proprietate naturae. Et certe imago et
similitudo corporis and sanguinis Christi in actio^e misterioru^ celebrantur.
That is to say / surely the sacrament of the bdye and blood of Christ with we
receive / are a godly thing / and therefore thorough them are we made
pertakers of the godly nature. And yet does yt not cease to be the substance or
nature of bred and wine / but they continue in the property of their owyn
nature. And surely the image and similitude of the body and blood are
celebrated in the act of the misterys This I am sure / that no man can avoid
yt / nor so wrest yt / but that all men shall sone espy his folly / and
therefore I may conclude that there remains the substance and nature of bread
and wine.

The second point wherein Frith dissenteth from our prelates and their
proctoure.
THe prelates believe that his very flesh is p^sent to the teth of the^ that
eat the sacrament / and that the wicked eat his very body Frith says that
yt is none article of our Creed and therefore he rekenith that he is in no
Ieoperdye though he believe yt not. And he thinks that his flesh is not
p^sent unto the teth of the^ that receive the sacrament. For his flesh is
only in one place at once. And that he proue^h both by the auctorite of Saint
Austen ad Dardanum / and also by the auctorite of Fulgentius ad Thrasuua^dum
libro 20. as before apereth in the book. And Fryth says that the wicked eat
not his very flesh allthough they receue the sacrament. And that he proves
by the scripture / doctoures and good reason grounded upon the scryptures.

The scripture is this / he that eats christ's Joan. 6
body has euerlasti^ge liffe / but the wicked has not everlasting liffe /
ergo then the wicked eat not his body. Again the scripture says he that
eats christ's flesh and drinks his blood abides in christ and christ
in hi^ but the wicked abide not in christ nor christ i^ hi^ / ergo the wicked
eat not his flesh nor drink his blood.

August^ in ser. d^ sacra fe pasche.
For saint Austen says he that ab^deth not in christ and in who^ christ
abides not / with ou^e doubt he eats not his flesh nor dri^keth his blood /
allthough he eat and drink the sacrament of so great a thing unto his
^ampnacion.

Beda^
And even the same words has beda upon the tenth chapter of the first
pistle to the Corinthians.

Augusti. de ciuitate Dei in libro. 21. cap. 25.
Again. s. Austene says / he that abides not in me and in whom I abide not /
let him not say nor think / that he eats my body or drinks my blood.
And even the same words has Beda upon the sixth chapter of the first epistle
to the Corinthia^s. And even the same sentence has Ambrose / and Prosper / and
Beda upon the.xi chapter of the first pistle to the Corinthians.

Finallye this may be proved by good reason grounded upon the scripture.
Christ would not suffer marye (though she loved him well) to touch him /
because she lacked one point of faith / and did not believe that he was equale
with his father. And therefore be reason yt must follow / that he will not suffer
the wicked (wc nether have good faith nor love toward hi^) both to touch him
and eat him in to their unclean bodies

Now since this is proved true that the wicked eat not his body / yt must also
thereof needs follow / that the sacrament is not his natural body For they do
eat the sacrament as all men know

Besides that the faithful do not eat christ's body with their teth. And
therefore yt must follow that the wicked do not eat yt with there teth. The
antecede^t or first perte of the reason is proved by the words of christ wc
says that the flesh profits nothing at all / meaning that yt does not
profit as they understood him: Joan. 6
that is to say / yt profits nothing to be eaten carnally with their teth
and bellye / as they understood him. For else yt profyteth much to be eaten
spu^allye / that is to say / to believe that thorough his body breakinge and
blood shedinge our sins are purged. And thus does Origene / s. Aus^en / Beda
/ Chrysostom / and Athanasius expound yt / as apereth in the book before. And
therefore Frith says that only faithful me^ eat his body: not with there teth
and mouth / but with their faieth and heart / y^ digest yt in to the bowelles of
their soulles thorough believing that yt was broken on the cross / to wash
away their sins. And the wicked eat not his body but on^ye the bred and
there da^pnacyon / because they eat him not spu^allie: that is / because they
believe not in his body breakinge and blood shedinge.

The third point wherein Frith dissenteth from your prelates and their proctoure.
THe p^lates believe that men ought to worship the sacrament but Frith says
nay / and affyrmith that yt is Idolatrye to worship yt^ And he says that
Christ and his appostyllis taught us not so to do: nether did the holy fathers
so teach us. And Frith says that the auctoures of this worshipinge are the
childerne of perdicion wc have overwhelmed this world with sin. Nevertheless
we must receive yt reuerentlye because of the doctrine that yt bryngith us.
For it preaches christ's death unto us / and discribeth yt before our eyes /
even as a faithful p^char by the word does in still yt in to us by our ears
and hearing. And that yt supplieth the Room of a pr^char is evident by the
words of s. Aus^en wc says. Paulus quis portaret sarcina^ corporis quod
aggrauat anima^, potuit tamen significando predicare Dominu^ ^esum Christum,
aliter perlingua^ suam, aliter per epistolam, aliter per sacramentu^ corporis
Christi, That is to say / though Paul did ^ere the burden of the body wc
does honorate the soul / yet was he able in syg^ifying to preach the lord
Jesus christ / one way by his tongue / and a another way by a pistle / and a
another way by the sacrament of Christ's body. etc. For as the people by
understanding the sygnifycacion of the words wc he spoke did hear the
glorious gospel of god / and as by the reading of his pistle they vnders^od
his m^nde and received the word of the souls health / so by the ministra^yon
of the sacrament they might see with there eyes the thing wc they hard and read
and so have their senses occupied about the misserye / that they might the more
earnestly pr^ynt it in their mind. As by example: The prophet Hieremie being
in Jerusalem in the time of ^ed^chias king of the Jews / prophesyed ^se^e. 27
and p^ached unto the^ / that they should be taken p^soners of Nabugo done^ar the
king of Babylon, And the Jews were angrye with him and would not believe his
words. And therefore he made a chain or ^etters of wode and put the^ a bout
his n^cke and proph^sid again and preached that they should be taken p^soners
and l^de captive in to Babylon. And as his words did certifye their ^ares that
they should be subdued / so the chain did p^sent their captivity even before
their eyes. wc thing did more veheme^tlye work in the^ th^^ the ^are words
could do / and even so yt is in the sacrament For likewise as the words di^
in still yt in to our ears / that his body was geuin for us / and his blood
shed for the remission of our sins / eue^ s^ did the ministratio^ of the
sacrament express the same thing unto our sight / and do the more
effectuouslye move us / then the bare words might do and make us more attent
unto the thing / that we may wholye give thanks unto god and praise him for
his bountuous benefits. And therefore seeing yt is as a p^char / expressinge
unto our sight the same thing that the words do to our ^ares / you must
receive yt with reuere^s and sober behavyoure / aduertisinge the thing / that yt
rep^senteth unto you. And eue^ the same honor is dew unto yt wc is geuin
unto the scripture that is the word of god. For unto that must a man
devoutly give ear / and r^uerentlie take the book in his hand: ye and if he
kiss the book for the doc^r^nes sake that he lerneth there out / he is to be
c^^me^ded, Nevertheless if he should goo sense his book / men might well think
that he were very childyshe. But if he should knele down and pray to his book
then he did commit plain idolatry

Consider dear brethern what I say and avoid this Ieoperdie. wc thing
avoided / I care not as touching the presence of his body / though you believe
that his natural flesh be there in deed (and not only in a misterye as I
have taught) For when the Ieoperdye is paste / he were a fool that would be
contentyous for a thing as long as there comyth no ^urte therbye.

The germans wc believe the presence of his body / do not worship yt / but
plainly teach the contrary and in that point (thanks be to god) all they
whom you call herytickes / do agree full-well. Only avoid this Idolatrye and I
desire no more.

The conclusion of this treatise.
Now dear brethern I beseech you for the mercy that ye look fore in Christ
Jesus / that you accept this work with a syngle eye and no contentyons heart For
necessite has compelled me to write yt / because I was informed both of my
lord of winchester and other creadyble persons / that I had by the means of
my first treatise offended many men. Which thing may well be true: For yt was
to slender to enstructe all the^ wc have sins seen yt / alb^ yt yt were
suffecyent for their use to whom yt was first delivered, And therefore I thought
yt not only expedient but also necessary / to enstructe them further in the
truth / that they might se plain evidence of that thing where in they were
offended.

By this wearke you shall espy their blasphemies and the venomous tongues where
with they s^launder not only them that publyshe the truth / but even the truth
yt seelfe. They shame not to say / that we affirm yt to be only bred and
nothing else. And we say not so: but we say that beside the substance of bred
/ yt is the sacrament of Christ's body and blood. As the yuye hangyng before
the tavern door is more then bare yuye. For beside the substance of yuye / yt
is a sign / and signifies that there is wine to be sold. And this sacrament
signifies unto us and poynteth out before our eyes that as verily as that
bred is broken / so verily was christ's body broken for our sins: And as
that bred is distributed unto us / so is his body and fructe of his passion
distributed unto all his faithful. And as the bred comfort the body so
does the faith in Christ's death comfort our souls. And as surely as we have
that bred and eat yt with our mouth and teth / and know by our senses that
we have yt with in us / and are partakers thereof: no more need we to doubt of
his body and blood / but that thorough faith / we are as sure of the^ / as we
are sure of that bred As yt is sufficientlye declared in my book.

Again you may perceive how wyckydlye they report on us wc affirm that we
dishonor yt wc give yt the right honor that yt ought to have. And you do
plainly dishonor yt / wc give unto yt the honor that is only dew unto
god. We give yt the same honor that we give unto the holy scripture and
word of god / because yt expresses unto our senses the death of our sauyoure /
and does more dypelye prent yt with in us. And therefore we call yt an holy
sacrament / as we call gods word / holy scripture. And we receive this
sacrament with great reverence / even as we reuerrentlye read or hear preached
the holy word of God wc conteyneth the health of our souls. And we grant
that his body is present with the bred as yt is with the word / and with both yt
is verelye received and eaten thorough faith. But if we should knele down and
pray unto the holy scripture / men might count us soles / and might lawfullye
say / that we do not honor the s^ripture by that means / but rather
dishonor yt. For the right honor of a thing is / to use yt ^or that intent
that yt was institute of god. And he that abuses yt to any other purpose /
does in deed dishonor yt. And likewise yt is in the sac^ame^t wc was
institute to keep in memory ^he does of christ / wc ^f we do any other wise
honor / then we do the holy scripture (unto the wc we may in no wise make
our prayers) I say that then we should v^ter^ie dishonor yt. Avoid therefore
this point of Idolatrye / and all is saffe.

Finallye we say that they speak^ well and faythfullye wc say that they goo
^o the body and receue the body of Christ / and that they speak vilynously
and wickedlye wc say that they only receive bred or the sign of his body
for in so saying they declare their inside ly^e. For the faithful will reakyn
that he is evil reported of and reputed ^or a traytoure and a another Judas /
if me^ should say of him that he did only receive the sacrament / and not also
the thing which the sacrament does signifye. For albe it he only eate^h the
bred and sacrament with his mouth and teth: yet with his heart and faith i^wardlye
/ he eatethe the very thing yt sellfe with the sacrament owtwardlye does
represent

And of this spring the manner of speakinges that the old fathers do sometime
use / wc at the first sight might seame contrary to our sentense But if they
be will po^dered / yt ma^e sone be sen^ / ^ow they should be taken. For many
times when they speak of the sacrament and outward eating / they apply unto
the sacrament and owtward eatinge / the fruit and conditions of the inward
eatinge and thing yt s^llfe ^ because that in a ^aythfull man they are so
Ioyn^t^ye Joined that the one is never with out the other. As by ^xa^ple / Marye
is named the mother of god and yet she is not the mother of his godhed by the
wc part only he is called god / but because she is his mother / as touching
his manhood / and the godhed is so annexed with the ma^^ed that they both / make
but one person / therefore is she called the mother of god / wc in deed if y^ b^
wyselye weyed / sha^be found to be ^bused speech And yet nevertheless yt may
very will be vsyd if men understand what is meant therbye / but if thorough the
use of this speech / men should fal^ in to such an error that would affirm
our lady to be in deed the mother of his godhed / then necessyte should
compel us to make a dystynctyon betw^ne the nature of his godhed and the
nature of his manhod / and so to expound the matter unto them / and bring them
home again in to the right understanding. As we are now cons^rayned to do in
this sacrament / because you mis^construe the sayings of the scripture and
Doctoures. Which notwyths^ondyng (if a man vnder^^ond them) say very well.

And many such manner of speeches are conta^ned in the scripture: As where
christ sa^eth Joan. 3. there shall no man ascend in to heuin / but he that
disce^deth from heaven / the sone of man wc is in heuin. This text does say
tha^ the son of man was the^ in heaven / when he ^pake these word^s unto
n^codemus here o^ yer^h wc thing all wise me^ consent to be understand /
propter unitatem personae: That is to say / for the unite of the person. For
albe it his godhed was in every place at that time / yet was not his ma^hod
(by the wc he was called the son of man) in heuin at that time. And yet
christ said that yt was in heaven for the unite of his person, For his godhed
was in heaven and because the godhed and manhood made one person / therefore yt
was ascrybed unto the August.
manhod with was on^ye vere^ied upon the godhed / as saint Au^ten ad Dardanum
does delygentlye declare.

And like wise in the sacrament o^ baptime / because the inward workinge of the
holy gos^ is ever a^nexed in the faithful / unto the outward ceremonye:
therefore sometime the fruit of the inward baptyme is ascrybed onto the outward
warke. And so the scripture uses to speak of the outward bapt^me as though yt
were the inward: that is to say / the spryt of god. And therefore s. Paul
says that we are buried with christ thorough baptime. And yet as s. Austene
expounds yt / the outeward baptime does but signify this burial.
Augustinus ad bonifacium
And again paul says / as many as are baptized have put christ upon the^.
And yet in deed our outeward baptyme does but signify / that we have put
christ upon us. But by the inward baptime (which is the water of liffe and
spirit of god) we have in deed put him upon us and live in him and he in us.
Which notwithstondynge is very false for all the outeward baptyme / in them
that receive yt not in faith. And unto them yt is but abare sign / Whereof they
get no profit / but dampnacyon.

And here you may euydentlye perceive how yt is some time in scripture
ascrybed unto the outeward work and ceremonye / wc is only true in the inward
veryte. And this place shall expound all the old doctoures which seame
contrary to our sentense, And therefore Mark yt well.

Thus have you my mind further upon the sacrament of the body and blood of
Christ. Wherein if you reaken that I have been to long in repeting one thing
so often / I shall pray you of pardon. But surely me thought I cold not be
shorter. For the world is such now a days that some would hear and can not:
and some do hear and will not. And therefore I am compelled so often to repete
that thing which a wise man would understand with halue the words.

Pray Christen reader that the word of GOD may increase and that God may be
glorified thorough my bonds AMEN.

The articles wherefore Johan Frith died which he wrote in newgate the.23. ^aye
of June / the year of our Lord 1533.
I Doubt not dear brethern / but that yt does / some deal vex you / to see
the one part have all the words / and fr^aly to speak that they list / and
the other to be put to sy^ence / and not to be hard^ indifferently. But refer
your matters to god / which shortly shall Judge after a another fasyon. But in
the m^ane ceason / I shall rehearse unto you the articles for which I am
condemned.

They examined me but of two articles which are these.
First whyther I thought / there were no purgatory to purg^ the soul after
this present ly^fe. Articl^
And I said / that I thought there was none. For man is made but of two parts
/ the body and the soul. And the body is purged by the cross of Christ /
which he lays upon ^uery child that he receauyth: as affliction / worldly
opressyon / persecucion / emprisonment and cet. and death finishith sin. And
the soul is purged by the word of god / which we receive through faith /
unto the health and salluacyon both of body and soul.

Now and if I did know any third perte whereof we are made / I would also
gladly grant them 3. purgatory but seeing / I know none such / I must deny
the popes purgatory. Nevertheless I count nether part a necessary article of
our faith / necessarely to be beleauyd under pain of dampnacyon / whyther
there be such a purgatory or not.

article.
The second article was this / whyther that I thought / that the sacrament of
the altar was the body of Christ. And I said ye / that I thought that yt was
both christ's body / and also our body / as s. Paulle says. 1. Cor. 10. cha.

In that yt is made one bread of many graynes yt is our body sygnifying that we
though we be many / are yet one body: and like wise of the wine in that yt is
made one wine / of many grapes.

And again in that yt is broken / yt is Chr^stes body / signyfyeng that his
body should be broken / that is to say suffer death / to redeem us from our
inquites,

In that yt was distributed / yt was christ's body / sygn^fyeng that as verily
/ as that sacrament is distributyd unto us / so verily is Christ's body / and
the fruit of his passion distributed unto all faithful men.

In that yt is receauyd / yt is Christ's body sygnifying that as verily / as
the outward man receauyth the sacrament with his tethe / and mouth / so
verily does the inward man / through faith / receive Christ's body and fruit
of his passion / and is as sure of yt / as of the bread that he ea^yth.

Another question.
Well said they / do you not think / that his very natural body / both
flesh and blood is really contained under the sacrament / and there actually
present / beside all similitudes. No said I / I do not so think. An answer.
Notwtstonding I would not that any should count that I make my saying (which
is the negative) any article of the faith. For even as I say that you ought
not to make any necessary article of y^ faith of your part (which is the
affyrmatiue). So I say again / that we make none necessary article of the
faith of owre part / but leave yt indifferent for all men to Judge therein / as
God shall open his heart / and no side to condemn or despise the the other / but
to nourishe in all things brotherlye love / and to bear others infyrmytes.

The text of saint Austyn which they there alegyd agenst me / was this: S.
Austins tex.
that in the sacrament Christ was borne in his own hands. Whereunto I said /
that s. Austyn does full well expound him sellfe. For in a another place he
says Ferebatur tanquam in manibus suis. That is / he was borne after a certain
manner / in his own hands And by that he says after a certain manner / ye may
sone perceive what he meanythe.

How be yt if s. Austyn had not thus expoundid him sellfe / yet the says ad
Bonifacin^ / that the sacrament of a thing / has a similitude or property
of the thing which yt sygnifyethe. And for that cause yt has many times /
the name of the very thing which yt sygnifieth. And so he says that he bare
him sellf / because he bare the scrament of his body and blood which did so
ernestly express him sellfe / that nothing might more do yt, If you read the
place of S^ Austen ad Bonifacium / wh^che I allege in my last book / ye shall
sone see them answered.

Chrisostomus.
A another place they allegyd out of Chrisostum / which at the first blusshe
semyth to make well for them. But if yt be well wayed / yt makes much less
for them then they wene. The words are these.

Chrisostom^s words.
Doist thou see bread and wine? do they depart from the into the draug^te as
other meats do? God forbid for as in ware when yt co^m^th to the fire /
nothing of the substance remayn^th nor abundyt^: so like w^se thyncke that the
mysteryes are consumyd by the substance of the bod^.

These words I expound^d / by the words of the same doctor saint Chrisostum
/ which in a another hom^lye says on this manner. The inward eyes as soon as
they se the bread / they fly over all creatures and thyncke not of the bread
that is baken of the baker / but of the bread of everlasting lyffe / which is
sygnifyed by the mystical bread.

Now confer these places to g^ther ad you shall ^erceaue / that the last
expoundyth the first clearly. First he says / doyst thou see bread and w^ne
/ I answer by the second / nay. For the inward ^es as soon as they see the
bread / thynck^ not of yt / but of the thing yt sellfe that ^s sygnyfyed
thereby. And so he seyth yt and se^th yt not. He seyth yt with his outward and
carnal eyes / but his inward eyes seyth yt not, That is to say / regard not
the bread or thyncke not on yt Eue^ as we co^me^ly say / when we play a gayme
necglyge^ly (by my truth I see not what I do) meaning that our minds / is
not apo^ that thing which we ^ee with our outwerde eyn. And like wise we may
answer the next part / where he says.

Do they depart from the in to the draughte / as other meats do? The
exposicyo^ of ^aync^ Chrysosto. text.
Nay forsouthe said I for other meathes do only come to nouryshe the body /
and to depart in to the draughte. But this meat that I here receive / is
spyrytuall meat / receyuid with faith / and nourysheth us euerlastyngly /
both body and soul / and never enterith into the draughte. And eue^ as before
the outward eyn do see the bread / and yet the inward eyn do not regard
that or thyncke upon yt. So like wise the outward man dyges^yth the bread /
and castythe yt in to the draughte. And yet the inward man does not regard
that nor thyncke upon yt^ But thynkythe on the thing yt sellfe that is
sygnyfyed / by that bread.

And therefore said Crysostum even a little before the true meaning of
Chrisostomus words.
the words which they here allegyd / lift up your mind and hearts (said
he) where by he monishith us / to look upon and consider those heavenly things
/ wyche are represented and sygnyfied by the bread and wine / and not to mark
the bread and wine in yt sellfe.

Here they will say unto me / that yt is not crysostu^s mind (for by his
example he plainly she with that there remanyth no bread nor wine) that I
deny. For the example in this place / prouith no more but that ye shall not
think on the bread and wine / no more then if they werre not there / but only
on that thing which i^ sign^fied by them. And that ye may ^uidently p^rceue by
the words following where he says / think that the misterys are consumed by
the substa^c^ of the body.

Solutio^
Now wither Chrisostum thought that there remained bread or non ^ both ways
shall our purpos^ be prouyd. First if he thought there remained still bread
and wine / then we have our purpose. Now if he thought that the bread and wine
remained not / but were changed / then are the br^de and wine nether mysteries
nor sacrament^s of the body and blood of christ. For that that is not / can
nether be mister^ nor sacrament.

Finally if he speak of the outward apperau^ce of bread: Conclu^ion.
then we know that that remaynith still and is not consumed by the substance
of the body. And therefore he must needs be vnd^r^tond as I take him.

I think many m^n wonder how I ca^ dye in this article / seeing that yt is no
necessary article of our faith / for I grant that neither perte is an
article necessary to b^ beleauyd under pain of dampnacion / but leave yt as a
thing in different / to think therein as god shall instyll in every man's
mind / and that neither part co^dempne other for this matter / but receive
each other in brotherly love / reseruinge each others inffirmite to god.

Behold he cause of my death.
The cause of my death is this / because I can not in conscience abjure and swear
/ that our prelates opinion of the sacrament (that is / that the substance of
bread and wine is verily changed in to the flesh and blood of our savior
Jesus Christ) is an undoubted / article of the faith / necessary to be beleauid
under pain of da^pnacyon.

Now though this opynion were in dead true (wiche thing they can nether prove
true by scripture nor doctors) yet coul^e I not in Note.
conscience grant that yt should be an article of the faith necessari^ to be
beleuid etc. For there are many verites / which yet may be no ^uche articles
of our faith. Its true that I lay in ^ I wrote this / how be yt I would not
receive ro^s when this truth for an article of our faith For you may think
the contrary with out all Ieoperdy of damnacion.

The cause why I can not believe there opinion of transmutacion is this.
3. ca^^es.
faulse and can nether be proved by scripture nor faithful doctoures / if they
be well pondered. necessary article of our faith. For then I should dampnably
condemn all the germans and Allmaynes / with infinite moo / which in dead
do not bealeue nor thyncke that the substance of bread and wine is changed in
to the substance of Christ's natural body. And surely I can not be so folishe
hard^ as to condemn such an infinite nombre for our prelates pleasures.
Thus all the Germaynes and Allmaynes / both of Lutherrs side and also of
Oecolampadius / do holy approve my matter. And surely I think there is noman
that has a pure conscience / but he will thyncke that I dye ryghtuously. For
that this transubsta^ciation should be a necessary article of the faith / I
thyncke no man can say yt with a good conscience / all though yt were true in
deed.
