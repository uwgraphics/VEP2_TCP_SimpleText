To the READER
CHristian Reader seeing the Holy Ghost has left us an honorable memory of
David's worthies who helped him to attain his Kingdom, 2. Chron. 11.
who was but a type of our King Jesus Christ, I think it necessary to manifest
some of those famous doctrines this servant of Christ Mr. John Forbes taught in
his life time, touching the right of Christ Jesus, which God the father gave
him to ordain all things in his Church. This truth of God he witnessed more
than 30. years, not only unto the loss of his living, and unto bonds; but
also unto banishment, for defending that it is not lawful for any Prince or
Potentate to command any human devises, for to compel them to be used in the
worship of God, and for mainteyning this endured these great trials. And about
4. years after he was chosen preacher to the Compaine of the English Merchant
Adventurers, and after he had served them 22. years he was displaced by our
King, and shortly after the Lord took him out of this world, he having served
in the Ministry 42. years, he now (as or hope is) is with the assembly of
those which have been killed for the Word of God, and testimony which they
maintained, who do cry, How long Lord, which art holy and true, do thou not
judge and avenge our blood on the persecutours of thy truth? But this doctrine
is thought strange unto the world, for the Papists do say, that the Pope has
authority to institute ceremonies in the Church, which he himself does judge
fit, and our prelates, with their doctors, do affirm that Princes and
Potentates of the world have authority with the assembly of their Bishops, to
institute ceremonies, rites, and orders, such as they do judge fitting to
worship God by, and they are endued with deep Philosophy, and learned arts,
which I do confess are good, so as they be allwaies ruled by divine truth,
but otherwise we are commanded to avoid them Col. 2.18. And the Holy Ghost
calls them, when they are not according to divine truth the deep learning of
Satan, as he has in this epistle manifested. Against them both this servant
of Jesus Christ does clearly manifest, that no human devises or ceremonies that
Christ has not appointed for his worship, may be used in his worship, for God
the Father has placed him far above all principallities, and powers, and
might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world but
also in that that is to come, as the Holy Ghost does show us in many places,
and that Christ is King and ruler in his Church.

Pilate and Caesar were content that Christ should be accounted High priest of
his church, and that he should be their Prophet, but for him to affirm he is a
King, that cost him his life, Caesar could not endure it: So in this age,
princes cannot endure that his church should receive no ordinances and decrees
but those that the Apostles established, for they will have their own
superstitions used in the worship of God, yet here the Holy Ghost does
sereously condemn it, and that Christ must have the whole pre-eminence in his
worship, and that his ministers must maintein this, as they will answer it at
his glorious appearing, to judge all the world, these sermons do manifest this
strait charge he received from the Holy Ghost to withstand all Human
superstitions which are brought into Gods worship, they were taken by pen, by
one of his ordinary hearers, the chief of these I had in writing two years
before he departed this life, and I showed them to him, and I told him I would
publish them without naming any author, he answered if I did publish them,
the adversaryes would know it to be his work, to which I answered, that then I
would not publish them, except I did survive him.

If all the sermons this reverend divine taught out of this epistle were
published, it would be proffitable unto this generation, and to that to come,
for he does manifest that as God by Moses ordained him to be his penman to
order his church under the law: So Christ has made this Apostle his penman to
appoint what ordinances his church must practice until his second appearing,
and that with the straitest charge we do read of, that his servants may not
admit of any other devices to be brought into his worship, as they will
answer it at the great and dreadful appearing of all the world before Jesus
Christ, with his holy Angels, to recompense all opposers of his truth
according to their works.

This Author does mention that in all Ages God has had his faithful witnesses
as in the 48 page appears, and Mr. Fox has instanced many, and here I think
fit to ad some others, in the dark time of Popery, which he has not.

Two Preachers in France, one named Peter Breves, the other is called Hendrick
van de Tollhouse, An. 1135:
they were well known in France, and of good estimation for their great
learning, and they did much bewail the Apostasy of the church, and they spared
no man of any degree, whatsoever they were, affirming that they were fallen
from the estate of grace and from Christ, and they affirmed the Pope to be the
Prince of Sodom, and the City of Rome to be the Mother of all abomination,
that all the Bishops were cruel Wolves, they detested the doctrine of
Transubstantiation, and affirmed the mass, prayer for the dead, was Idolatry
before God, and that Images and the Cross might not be prayed unto, nor
suffered in the Churches: That the Priests manner of singing was mockery before
God^, that praying to Saints and vowing of Chastity, and their manner of
building Temples, and observing of Holidays were superstitious and wicked, and
all humane inventions in Gods worship wicked Idolatry. These me^ continued in
their preaching twenty years, and having great resort coming to their preaching
of all sorts and estates, at last they were apprehended by the Popes command,
by a Legate of his, and Peter Brise was burned at St. Ioils, the other was
apprehended and committed to prison, but what came of him we find not: but
there followed great persecution, and many of their Disciples went to their
death joyfully* Look the 65. and 66. Letters of Barnod to the Earl of St.
Ioylls. There wrote against them Peter Abbott af Clugnam, which Barnod did
record, and in likelihood with envy. See the Cronicle of Paulus Meriam.

Doctor Fulck in his answer to the Rhemish Testament, does say, that the
Church of Leodium, before this, was under great persecution under Pope Pascus,
for affirming him Antichrist.

The Jesuit says that one Cesarius writes, that ihe doctrine of these
Waldenses was spread in more then a thousand cities, and that they had an army
of 70000. that were destroyed by Simon of Momford, with a small army: but
there is no mention of an army, which they had in the Chronicles.

1. Tim. 6.13. I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickneth all
things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good
confession. etc.


HItherto the Apostle has set down unto us a perfect pattern, to teach all
the servants of Christ, how to walk in the house of God, which is the Church
of the living God, in all the parts and portions of their spiritual function,
for the advancement of Gods glory, and for the edification of his saints, and
for the avoiding of all those things, which might offend God in his worship,
either in Doctrine, or Discipline: he has set us down, and has let us see,
what sorts of men must have charge in Gods house: and he has warned us of the
error, that they must avoid in Doctrine, and of the vanity they must avoid in
their form of speech, and he has likewise let us see, what form, of
Discipline is to be used in Gods Church. In this Chapter he comes to the
conclusion of it all: and first before he concludes it, he first deals against
servants, who did abuse their Christian liberty, as a pretext, to the flesh,
refusing to obey their Masters: some, because their Masters were heathens, and
therefore they thought, that a Christian made free by Jesus Christ, should not
be bound to serve them, others, because their Masters were Christians,
therefore they thought it equal, that one Christian should not be bound to be
a servant to another, the Apostle answers both these in the beginning of this
Chapter, and after returns back again, and gives warning to Timothy, and in
his person, to all Pastors what should be done, that they should teach, and
exhort the Church, this should be the substance of their Doctrine, which in
this epistle is contained, and to moove him to this, he sets down an argument
from the miserable estate of those which keep not this commandment of the
Apostle: for if any man teach otherwise, and consents not to this wholesome
Doctrine, which is according unto godliness, he is proud not knowing aright:
and he lets us see the vain ground of this their vanity; as first, they are
men of corrupt minds, the second is, they are destitute of the truth; the 3.
is this, they suppose gain is godliness: and the Apostle does manifest, that
this shows it to be the plain contrary, and that godliness is great gain,
and this he shows by a strong argument, in the verses following, and he
labors to draw all Pastors from this vice of coveteousnesse, and he teaches
them how they should exercise themselves continually, he setting down a
perfect pattern, for all Pastors, and Teachers to practice, they must follow
after godliness, faith, love, meekness, and this is the first; Secondly they
must fight the good fight of faith, and the last is, the end and intent, that
they may lay hold on eternal life: and he subjoynes 2. reasons why Timothy
should do so, as first, because he was called thereunto of God, secondly
because he had professed a good profession before many witnesses, therefore it
should be a shame for him to faint, and not to go forward and continue.

Now the Apostle concludes with a most weighty Charge to Timothy, and in his
person unto all Pastors, and Teachers, unto the end of the world: and this
Charge is continued in 4 verses, from the 13 verse, unto the 17. and the
substance of the charge stands in two things, the first is, in keeping of this
commandment without spot, unrebukeably, and the second is, the constant
keeping of it. The first part concerns the matter he is to look unto; The 2
is, concerning the time how long they must keep this, and both parts have
their grounds, and reasons in them. First we will speak of them as they are
generally set down unto us, in the first and 2 verses, wherein we have first
to mark the matter of the charge: the word charg is the sa^e word which the
Apostle uses before, in this epistle the first chapter, wherein he says, that
the end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart, where the word here
called a commandment is the same here used for charge, so that this is not an
exhortation, or request, but it is a straight and severe commandment: secondly
this commandment, is strengthened by a double authority, the authority of
God, and of Christ, first I charge thee before God, and secondly before the
Lord Jesus Christ; thirdly this authority is yet more strengthened; and greater
weight is added to it, not simply by laying God, or Christ before them; but by
laying God before him, and Christ before him, each of them in the particular
consideration of them, which is this, that he does quicken all things, the
particular consideration of Christ in this, that he witnessed, and confessed,
a good confession before Pontius Pilate, of these I will briefly speak, before
I come to the commandment it self: which is set down in the next words, to
keep this commandment without spot, or blameless, till Christ's appearing
again. First concerning the charge, but before we come to enter into the
particulars of it; It may be demanded, what should move the Apostle to ad this
heavy charge, to his former precept, especially to Timothy, whom he so much
commended, that be found no man like minded unto him: what is the reason he
knowing him to be such a man, yet he gives a severe charge unto Timothy, and
in his person to all Pastores and Teachers; the reason I take to be twofold.
First that men might not dally with this doctrine, as though it might be
alterable by his Church, or changed at the appointment of Princes, therefore
he will have them to know, this is not so, but it is of divine authority,
which none dare to change, as he will answer unto God, and to Christ, in
whose name he charge him, that so neither Timothy, nor any other potentate,
should think these precepts, to be the precepts of men: or such as his Church
might alter at their discretion, but this charge is given us to this end, to
force us all, and most chiefly Pastors to observe it, as we will answer it
before God, at his most dreadful judgment, therefore no command of Princes,
nor the fear of the loss of our lives, might cause us to violate this truth.
The second reason why the Apostle gives this weighty charge unto Timothy, who
was so rare a man, of whose stedfastnes, the Apostle so well approved: is this,
to show that it is not an easy matter to perform this charge, but that all the
grace that was in Timothy, was little enough to enable him, with constancy and
courage to keep it inviolably: the reason of it is this, because there is
nothing in this world which Satan more opposes, nor that men set themselves
against, neither any thing so contrary to flesh and blood, as the truth of
Gods worship, and the sincerity of Preaching it, the Devil labors to
corrupt the purity of doctrine, and the service of God in his Church, above all
things in the world: Now seeing it is so much opposed by Satan and the world,
who labor to deprive us of salvation, that we might perish with them;
therefore the Apostle knowing how the world and Satan would oppose it, he
seeing by the spirit of revelation the great temptations his servants must
undergo, that would keep Gods worship pure, therefore, he gives this strait
charge unto his Church, that they should lay before their eyes, God, and
Christ, continually, for otherwise, the terrors of men, and the world will
shake them, and cause them to corrupt the ways of God; otherwise men stand
always in danger of being overcome, either by entisements of riches, or by
the terror of persecution, and of imprisonment, therefore the spirit gives us
this strayt charge, to bind us more strongly to this doctrine, and thus we see
the reasons which moved the Apostle, to set down this weighty charge unto his
Church.

Now let us come and consider this more particularly, first he charge him
before God, and secondly before Jesus Christ the Lord; the general
consideration of the manner of this charge, serves for to let us see, there is
nothing ca^ stay the miserable heart of man in the ways of God, except the
consideration of God and Christ: Take these two out of his sight, and he is in
darkness, for if his heart be not set to see God, and Christ, he will soon
turn from the truth, to vanity: the very sight of men will make us to stoup,
and change our minds, if God be out of our sight, this made Moses so
courageous before Pharaoh.

The Apostle says of him self to the Corinths, that he was not as other
teachers who adulterated the word of God, he gives this to be the reason, why
he was not such an one, because he spoke as in the sight of God: and this kept
him that he could not adulterate the word of God, it is his sight only that
stays us, and keeps the heart of man, and that keeps our hearts upright in
the work of God: See the truth of this, Hebr. 11.
spoken of Moses, it is said that Moses by faith, forsook Egypt, and despised
the wrath of the King, by seeing him which is Invisible: he had such a sight
of God, which stayed his heart, that no threatenings of Pharaoh could make him
to alter his mind: and that we may see this lesson belongs generally unto
us, yea every Christian, as well as unto every Pastor, it does appear in the
Hebrews, where it is said, Hebr. 12.
we are compassed about with a cloud of witnesses; Let us cast off every thing
that presses down, and the sin, which hangs so fast on: fixing our eyes
upon Jesus, the author and fimisher of our faith, who for the glory that was
set before him, despised the shame or cross: If our eyes be fixed upon Jesus,
the author and finisher of our faith, we shall go thtough honor, and
dishonor, so as nothing can hinder us, till we have attained unto the price
of our calling: God having in Jesus Christ, chosen us unto himself: thus we
see how necessary it is, to have God continually in our sight.

And this is that which made David rejoice, that God was with him, at his right
hand to uphold him: which made him not to be afraid of death: and to the same
end the Apostle says, Romans 8.
if God be on our side, who can be against us: This general sight of God, and
of Christ, is the only thing which will stay a miserable conscience, and
unconstant heart, against the fear of man: we see Joseph was stayed by this,
not to yield to his wicked Mistress, where he said, how shall I do this great
wickedness and sin against God.

We have need to set God, and Christ before us, and that will keep us from
falling into evils against God or against our Neighbor, and it will establish
our hearts in goodness: again it may be demanded why the Apostle joins God,
and Christ; is not the sight of God sufficient to stay our hearts? Now here may
be 2 reasons given for it, in giving this charge, to join God, and Christ
togeaher, first because there is no fruit to us, in the sight of God alone,
except the sight we have of God we have it in and through Christ, that except
we know God, in Christ, our Savior, the sight of God will never allure thee
unto obedience, for there is no sight of God, that will establish thy heart in
obedience, except thou see God as the Father of Christ, that gave his son
unto the death for our transgressions, and this sight makes us to love God,
with all our hearts, and to prefer this God, before all the world, which
causes us, we dare do nothing that shall offend him, for to please men.

Secondly the distinct consideration of these two, is of great force to further
and provoke man's heart unto obedience: First in consideration of God, who is
the judge of all the world, before whose face, all the world shall appear, to
receive according as they have done in their bodies, whether it be good or
evil: Romans 3.
the consideration 2of God, as my judge, as the Apostle calls him, and
Abraham calls him so likewise, this is a great stay to restrain men from
sin, when I do know that he who is my judge is before me, and he sees me,
and he does observe all my ways; and this if I do mind, is of mighty force,
to keep me from sinning against him.

Moreover if there be any safety from Gods judgments, it is by the mediation of
Christ alone: Now seeing that God, and Christ, are perpetually joined together
in judgment, so that what the one approves, the other approves, therefore I
must see God as my judge, and Christ as my mediator, as a means to keep me
from sin, and for both these reasons it is, that the Apostle joins them
together, God and Christ in this his charge, to let us see, we have God, and
Christ, for our enemies to convince us, and to condemn us in that great day,
seeing in both their names we were charged, to keep this commandment without
spot, and thus we are taught the reasons, wherefore he joyneth God, and Christ
together in this great Charge.

Now we are to come to the particular consideration, of this Charge, first he
laieh God before us to be considered in this particular, that he quick neth
all things, and secondly, he lays Chist before us, who before Pontius Pilate
witnessed a good Confession, why this?

The reason of this, is, of great moment to be considered of us; for the
ignorance of this one point, is the cause of many foolish pastors, and of many
foolish Christians? for it is not the naked setting of God and of Christ before
us, that will serve the turn, to stay thy wicked heart from pollution; Unless
I set God before me as he is in Christ and as he is a pattern of doing good,
showing me how I should walk, I say unless I think of them, and thus see
them, the sight of them shall never do me good, or be of force to stay my
wicked heart from sin, for wicked men believe there is a God, and so do the
Devils also, and this works as much in the devils, as in many Chistians:
(does the sight of God and of Christ, hinder men from profaneness, in this
world, does it either stay the heart of Preacher, or hearer, from sinning? it
does not;) the reason is, because they have only a general mooving, and
notion of God, but they never, or seldom take notice of him, in his nature, and
properties, as he is laid before us, as a pattern, in whose footesteps we
must walk, and therefore the Apostle laid God before Timothy in the
particular consideration of him, as he quickens all things, and Christ as he
witnessed a good confession before Pontius Pilate.

Touching the first, the spirit of God throughout the scriptures, when they
speak of any matter concerning God, or his glory, Commonly he sets down a
certain description of God, that out of it, men may see him so, as to fear to
do any thing that he forbids: Yet among all the gloriouse discriptions of
God, there is none more glorious then this, which the Apostle has here set
down in these 4 verses; first that it is he, that quickneth all things,
secondly that he is the only Potentate, and king, of kings, and Lord, of
Lords; dwelling in that light which no man can attain unto; to whom be honor,
and glory everlasting, so he sets down a strait description of the living
God, because much is to be considered of God, to make all pastors and
teachers, to be faithful, and to stay sinful man from corrupting Gods truth:
it is not the knowledge of one particular concerning God; nor yet of many, that
will serve the turn; but it must be a great and wonderful knowledge of God,
that will sanctify a profane heart, to true obedience therefore Christ
himself ascribes eternal life, unto the knowledge of the true God, Joh. 17.
and him whom God has sent.

This is not the general knowledge of God, which many have, and yet shall be
damned, but it is such a knowledge, as will daunt the most vain, and proud
heart of man, and make it to stoop under his hand: I say such a knowledge of
God we must have, and such an apprehension of God, as will not make us to jest
at it, but such a knowledge as may make us perpetually to tremble, and it
should be our care to increase in this knowledge of God, and to learn to know
him aright; for it is not the knowledge of God simply, but the knowledge of God
aright: that will make both Pastor, and Christians, to walk conscionably, and
sincerely, whereas on the contrary wicked men through their Ignorance of God;
because God holds his peace, and does not presently execute Judgment,
therefore they thought that God did approve of their wickedness, as if God
took pleasure in sin, as much as they; we read in the psalms: the wicked
says in his heart that God has forgotten, Ps. 10.11
he hides his face, he will not see it, and this makes them to scorn at them
which reprove them, and all because the sight of God is hid from their eyes.

The cause of all loosenes of life, and wickedness of heart, is chiefly this,
that though we think we know God, yet we know him not as we should, therefore
let us every one labor to understand this, that God will have us to know him,
as he has revealed in his word.

To come to speak of this knowledge more particularly, how God is set before
us, to be considered in his working, in his power, and in his Omnipotency, but
in this place he is set before us, in his mighty power and the efficacy
thereof, and Jesus Christ is here set before us for an example to us, who
witnessed a good Confession, and this we must consider of God more
particularly, for we may not consider God only in his goodness, and mercy,
and not in his power and justice: for that will make men make shipwreck of
faith, and not to walk with an upright heart before God; when men look only
to Gods mercy, and forget his power; indeed Gods mercy is the most kindly
motive, to make us to obey God, but it is not the only motive, for the power
of God must likewise be laid before our eyes: David was astonished when he did
see, what judgments God did execute upon men, and in the 1. Corinthians. the
Apostle tells us what it is, that made him a faithful minister, knowing the
terror of the Lord to persuade men, he sets before himself, the horrible
judgments that shall be inflicted upon unfaithful ministers at the last day:
and this made him to set himself, to draw men to God, by all tbe strength he
could, he considered not only Gods goodness, but he likewise setts before
himself the terror of the Lord, so as he durst not dalley with Gods truth,
but he did labor to the utmost of his power, faithfully to dispense Gods truth.

Jesus Christ he is set before us as a pattern, for Christ is not only to be
considered by us, as our Redeemer, or mediator, for this does but beguile
foolish men, and causes them to sin more, but they should consider an other
thing in Christ: to wit, that he is not only given for this, but also for a
pattern, and unless we serve God, after his example, his blood shall never
ransom us.

These are the two things we are to mark, to set God before us, not only in
mercy, but also in his power, and we are to set Christ before us, not only as
a redeemer, but also as a pattern for us to follow his footsteps: concerning
God, he makes choice of this, that he quickneth all things: why this? (to be
short,) Gods power is to be seen in many things, but especially Gods power
shines in this, and has the greatest force in it, to daunt the hearts of men
more then any thing whatsoever when he sees God to be the author of life to
all things: so that no man lives but by him, if any man consider this, to wit,
that they have no breath, nor life, nor mooving, but from God; and that it is
not in the power of any king, or Potentate in the world, to give life but God
alone, and thy life is in Gods hand to give it to thee, and to continue it, and
to restore it, when it is taken from thee; this consideration, is of great
moment to preserve us, not to offend this God, for the pleasure of any
Potentate in the world, since all the world cannot give me life, nor continue
life, and when I am dead, and life is gone, none in heaven, or earth, can
restore me to life, except God do it; why then should I not be careful, that I
offend not this God, nay far be it from me, for to do it, for any flesh in
the world: O let us be careful that we provoke not this good God to wrath,
who has given us life, that in his wrath, we provoke him not to take it from
us again: seeing that God only gave it me, to honor him: am I not bound to
consecrate my life to him alone, and not to obey any creature to disobey him,
it was not my father, or mother, that gave me life, but the Lord only, who is
the Lord only, who is the Lord of life, he has put life into me, therefore
neither for father, nor mother, should I give my life otherwise then for the
honor of God: O but some may say, Objection.
if I do so, and so, these men will take away my life from me, have they power
to do it without God? says not Christ, Luc. 22.
fear not them which can kill the body, but rather fear him, which can cast
both soul and body into hell fire, and he said again, are not there two
sparrowes sold for a farthing and yet not one of them falls on the ground,
without the providence of our heavenly father, how much better are ye then
many sparrowes: if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground, nor any man can take
away the life of it, without Gods providence, than surely all the tirants of
the world, cannot take away thy life, except the Lord suffer them: the Lord
Jesus himself, gives a sweet warning to his disciples, when he says to
them, Rise, and let us go to Judea again, and his disciples said unto him,
Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee, and go thou then thither?
they thought it an hard saying of Christ, that they should go thither again:
but Jesus answered them and said, are there not 12. hours in the day? if any
man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he has the light, and sees
the light of this world, question
but if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth because there is no light in
him. What means Christ by this, he means by this to tell them, that as long
as the day of man's life does last, which has a period set, so long he goes
without fear, as he that walks in the day, fears not, for the Lord is with
him, but if they walk in the night, that is, if the time appointed of their
life, be at an end, he must fall then, letting us thereby understand; that men
may walk in their lawful callings without fear: for all the world cannot
make him stumble, if God give them not leave, as Christ said concerning Herod,
tell that fox, I must walk to day, and to morrow, until the third day, which
is appointed of God for me: so that we may see, that none can give us life
but God, so in the last place, when we are dead, none can restore our souls
and bodies to life again but God only, and therefore we must not consecrate
our life to any but to God alone, these considerations are worthy to be laid up
in our hearts.

Besides these considerations, of Gods quickening all things, it is an especial
ground of our faith, Romans 4.17*
as it is written concerning Abraham, I have made thee a father of many nations
before God, and he believed the word of God, even that God that quickneth the
dead, and calls those things which be not, as though they were, and this was
that which made Abraham to walk steadfastly with God, because he knew as the
Apostle boasts saying, I am persuaded that neither life, nor death, nor any
other creature can separate me, from the love of God: Romans 8.
death is not able to keep me under the power of it, for Christ by death has
overcome death, as the Apostle affirms, if the spirit of him which raised
Christ from the dead, dwell in your mortal bodies, even he that raised the
Lord Jesus, shall likewise raise your mortal bodies by the same spirit: so
that this is the ground of our faith, and hope, to wit, that God quickneth all
things: and this made Abraham to be obedient, and ready to offer up his son
Isaac, for he knew, that (notwithstanding) God would not fail to make good
what he had promissed in the person of Isaac.

To conclude this point at this time, there be manifold considerations of this
argument, to strengthen all, Pastors, especialy in their calling, that they
pervert not Gods word, for any man's pleasure in the world: for if I look to
their lives, that will oppress me, or if I shall look to my own life, I
shall find it to be a great terror, to keep me from displeasing God in my
calling, for any man's pleasure; first, if I consider their lives, they have it
from God, and as their life is from God, so is all their working, power; that
they cannot stir a foot further then it pleases God: for God can cut off
their days in an instant: is it not then a vain thing to fear man, whose
breath is in his nostrils, it being so easy a matter for God to take away the
life of all flesh, how dare I then sin against God, to obey any man?
Secondly, if I consider mine own life, I have no cause to obey man, and to
sin against God, seeing none can take my life away, but God: and none can
give it me, but he which gave it: therefore I should only fear him, who
gave me life, and can take it from me: and thus we see, how the spirit of
God, in this particular consideration of God, who quickneth all things; lays a
strong ground to all Pastors, and Teachers, for to harken unto this Charge,
that they violate not this commandment.

The second Sermon.
OF this great grave and weighty Conclusion (beloved in the Lord) wherewithal
the Apostle ends his Doctrine, which concerns the ordering of the affairs of
Gods house aright, according to the will of God: we began to speak to you the
last time, and we did show you the reason why the Apostle did ad this so
weighty and grave Charge, and Commandment to Timothy; a man otherwise of
excellent gifts, it was to let us see, that these things are not of humane
invention, but of divine authority: they are things which are not to be
dispensed with all, as men may dispense with the precepts of men; for they are
the Commandments of the living God: otherwise the Apostle would never have
charged Timothy, and in him all Pastors in such a manner, as in the sight of
God, and of Christ Jesus, to keep this Commandment without spot. Secondly he
will let us understand, by this charge, what difficulty Pastors shall have to
continue faithful in Gods house, for they have allwais need perpetually, to
have this Charge laid before them, and sounding in their ears, that the
terrors of it, may keep them in their Compass, that they may practice this
duty which the Apostle has charged them withal; because whatsoever Satan,
or this wicked world can do, to make Pastors to pervert the ways of God, and
to walk in Gods house otherwise then God has Commanded: he knows that if
the shepherd be smittem, the flock will be stattered, and that the corrupting
of the Pastor will corrupt the flock, therefore mainly does he set himself,
against them that are Pastors, if he cannot quench the gospel, yet that he
may pervert the gospel: that it may not yeald wholesome food of salvation to
Gods people.

First in the charge, we are to mark the manner of propounding of it, it is
commanded, and that a denunciation given with authority, it is not a request or
an exhortation, but it is a strait injunction, binding the soul and
conscience, to necessary obedience. Secondly, we declared unto you, by what
authority he commands this law, he does it not by his own, but he charge
him before God, that quickneth all things, and in the sight of Christ the Lord,
he lays the authority of God and of Christ before him: wherefore he did this,
we have already showed you, and why that Christ is joined with God in this
Charge: because we are to set before our eyes, our Judge and our advocate, in
this Charge. God is the judge of the world, and he will judge the world, by
Christ Jesus, the man; so that although we be guilty of sin, in the sight
of God, and that God for the same may justly damn us, yet there is hope of
mercy in the mediation of Christ, who has given himself to death for us, but
in the transgression of this precept, the Spirit, will have Pastors to know,
that they are not to look unto Christ, as a mediator, but to God as a judge,
and both God and Christ, shall be against him that neglects this precept:
Yea, all faithless Pastors shall find, so far as they neglect Gods service,
so far Gods wrath shall be kindled against them.

We began to speak of the properties which are by the Apostle added to God,
and Christ, to make this attestation of greater force, and you heard that he
sets down God by this, that he quickneth all things, and the reason why
(above all the properties of God,) he chooses this one fact of God in the
second place, as being of greatest weight, to enforce this exhortation, for the
greatest weight, or force, or fear that we can be in, is of our lives; this
is the greatest fear, that man can put in our hearts, namely, to take away our
lives from us: now that which arms us against this, is the knowledge of God,
that he has all men's lives at his disposing, and that he both gives life,
and takes it away at his pleasure, and can restore us to life, when our lives
are taken away from us, so that we need not to be afraid of any creature,
since we know this authority of taking away our lives, is only in his hands,
so as none can take them away, without his permission, and when they take it
away, God can restore it again: there is no fear of the loss of life, that
should make a faithful Pastor to pervert the ways of God.

Now we are to speak of the particulers, that are here ascribed to Christ,
which in order follows next to be handled, and concerning him, the Apostle
ads this, who witnessed a good confession, before Pontius Pilate. There are
many things that may be said of God, to make the conscience to tremble before
him; besides this that is here set down, that he quickneth all things: so
there may be many things said of Christ besides this: that he witnessed a good
confession, under Pontius Pilate; only the Apostle chooses this, above all
the rest, to set forth our obedience to this charge: the reason he gives,
because the chief thing, that causes and teaches us or Pastors to walk
uprighly, is the example of the Prince of Pastors, Christ Jesus, who is the
Lord, and head of all Pastors, and he that makes us Pastors, as the Apostle
shows us, that he is ascended up on high, and gave some to be Apostles, some
Prophets some Pastors, and Teachers, he is the Prince of our calling, and,
the Pastor of all Pastors, to teach them how to discharge the duty of their
calling: Ephesians. 4.
therefore the Apostle sets Christ for the pattern: which he did in the time
of the greatest danger, that ever he was in, the very day that he was condemned
to die, even before a heathen judge* to teach us by his patience, what we
should do, that are Pastors, though we be in danger of our lives; Nay though
we know, that our adversaries have power given them of God, to take away our
lives from us, yet we should do like him, that is our Prince, which has laid
down this foundation before us, he having witnessed a good confession in the
presence of Pontius Pilate: and no terror of the judge, nor cruelty of the
adversary, nor fear of death, made him afraid to confess Gods truth, this
example should we set before our eyes all ways. And this being the general,
it should teach us this lesson, that Pastors that would know how to walk
faithfully in Gods house, must not be ignorant of the conversation of Christ
the Lord: but they must look upon his boldness, and perseverance, and
faithfulness to the end, and make him to be the only pattern of their own
carriage in Gods house: it is not enough for a Pastor to look how this or
that man behaves himself: but he shall answer in the day of account,
according as he has followed Christ, who is the only rule of our behavior;
and according unto which his damnation shall rest, and be just: the Apostles
them selves never durst presume to teach men to follow them absolutely, but
they bad the saints to follow them, as they followed Christ, for Christ is the
pattern of all righteousness, and true Christianity, according to whose
footsteps, we must walk, if ever we think to reign with Christ in glory:
this is the pattern which the Apostle Peter tells us, that Christ also
suffered, the just for the unjust, leaving us an example, that we should follow
his footsteps, what he did in the work of his ministry, and in his life, and
conversatio^, was do^ to teach us, how we should walk either as Christians, in
general, or as dispencers, of the mysteries of God: and this is the reason why
Christ is set in the scriptures, before the Church of God, that they might
perpetually, have their eye upon him, who is the author, and finisher of their
faith: so as that he did endure the cross, and despite the shame, for the
glory that was set before him; so must we endure all the afflictions, that the
world can lay upon us, and we must stand steadfast to Gods truth, or else we
may justly doubt, whether ever God will save us or no: so that Pastors must
look upon Christ, and learn of him, meekenes and lowliness of heart, and
piety and the true service of God. This being the general, we will come more
particularly to this, that the Apostle here sets down, especially in
confession, he sets down Christ's confession: there are two things upon which
depends our salvation, the first, is the inward action of the heart, the second
is, the outward action of the mouth, Romans 10.
with the heart, man believes to righteousness, and with the mouth he
confesses to salvation.

Now the Apostle having to do with Pastors, not so much in regard of the
inward disposition of their hearts, as of their outward pattern, therefore he
speaks not a word of the inward disposition of the heart, but of outward
faithfulness: and this is that which principally we are to look into,
namely, how Christ professed, and confessed, and witnessed this his confession,
for these two are to be distinguished: there is confession, which is the
matter, and there is witnessing, that is the fact, so that we are to consider
his confession, and the witnessing of it: and the place where, that it was,
even under Pont. Pilate, or before him, and so much the rather are we to take
this to heart, because we have a sad saying, which Christ sets down, not
only to Pastors, but to all Christians, where he says, that he^ which is
ashamed of me, before men, and denies me before men, of him will I be
ashamed, before my father, and deny him* but he that confesses me before
men, him will I confess before my father in heaven; it is therefore a
dangerous thing, to err in this, seeing so heavy a sentence is given of them
which confess him not: this is the point which we are to look unto, it is
not enough for Christians to glory, as many foolishly do, to wit of their
faith, that they do believe, and yet in the mean time although they profess
God in word, yet they deny him in deeds, as Paul says to Titus.

Now God will not have this: but he will have, as man believes with the heart,
so he should confess the truth with his mouth, if ever he think to be saved:
the Apostles were not ashamed, no not in the very sight of the scribes, and
Pharisees, when they were accused, and forbidden to preach in Christ's name: they
said plainly to them, judge ye whether it be better to obey God, or man; the
whole world could not silence them, when God Commanded the^ to speak, he will
never hold his peace, from that which Christ had made him a witness unto: Now
all Pastors are Christ's witnesses, as Christ says, he has chosen them to
be witnesses to the gentiles, of that which they had heard and seen: Pastors
are the witnesses of Christ, and are appointed to bear record of his truth:
and if they be silent in this, and the fear of death, or life, make the^ to
shutt their lips from speaking of Gods truth, this sentence shall meet them in
the day of judgment: and the prince of Pastors, shall be their conviction,
that they have not walked as became them: because they did not do as he did:
so this confession, is the thing that the Apostle lays before us, because
fear many times makes men dissemble with the truth of God, and the fear of
death many times makes men to pervert the truth of God, and to keep it close
when God requires it should be spoken: the son of God is an example to us,
who never did pervert the truth, nor concealed it: for if every Christian be
bound to the Apostles commandment to give a reason of his faith, to every one
that shall ask it: how much more is he bound to this, that he that teaches
others, should own, and maintain this truth, as occasion is offerred: this
is therefore the truth, and the duty that especially we must look unto, we
must confess the truth, and acknowledge the truth, com what can come, we
must not be ashamed of it. Secondly the Apostle says, that Christ witnessed a
good confession, he did not only confess the truth, but he did likewise
bear witness unto the truth, ratifying it by his testimony, and which is
more, he ratifyed it at his death, and that is that, the Apostle chiefly aims
at: for that which Christ confessed before Pontius Pilate, he ratifyed it, and
confirmed it by his death: he confessed himself to be the son of God, and
he ratifyed it by his death, and this is the maine cause, why in Matthew and
Luke, that they said unto him, we have found him perverting the Nation, and
saying, he is a King, and this is the Question that Pontius Pilate moved unto
him, when he said, art thou the King of the Jews? and Christ said unto him
thou have said it, this is that confession which the Apost. aims at, and it is
set down fully in the 18. of John, where fore to the intent that we may the
better know the meaning of the place, let us consider the words there set
down, at the 33 verse, then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and
called Jesus, and said unto him, art thou the King of the jews, Jesus answered
him, say thou this thing of thy self, or did others tell it thee of me?
Pilate answered am I a jewe? thine own Nation, the chief priests have
delivered thee unto me, what have thou done? Jesus answered him my Kingdom is
not of this world, if my Kingdom were of this world, then would my servants
sight that I should not be delivered to the jews, but now, is not my Kingdom
from hence: Pilate therefore said unto him, art thou a King, then Jesus
answered; thou say that I am a King, to this end was I borne, and for this
cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth:
every one that is of the truth, hears my words, and this is the confession,
which Jesus witnessed before Pontius Pilate.

First we will consider the substance and matter of it, secondly we will
consider the circumstances of it, to wit the time, and condition, which Christ
was in, when he made this confession, the confession which he witnessed has
these parts, first that he was a King, secondly, that his Kingdom was not of
this world, thirdly, that he was borne, and came into the world to this end,
to bear witness unto the truth, and fourthly, every one of the truth, did
hear his voice; these are the four parts of his confession; it is not
therefore without great cause, that the spirit of God, charge Pastors in the
name of Christ before him, that witnessed this good confession before Pontius
Pilate, for it serves not only for example, but likewise for great instruction
for us that are Pastors, to teach us what God requires at our hands, who
witnessed a good confession, says the Apostle, a better confession can none
make, nay this daunts the hearts of feeble minded Pastors, they not dareing to
show forth their faithfulness to Christ, and this is the maine point, both in
the confession of Christ, the Prince of Pastors, and of all that shall succeed
him, to avouch the Lord Jesus Christ to be King: for the world is content of
any thing else, that we can say of Christ, they will allow of his
prophetical, or priestly office, How the world esteems of Christ.
but for him to rule and reign, that they will not endure, they will not have
him to be king.

The potentates of the earth cannot endure that Christ should be the king of
his church but they will have some of their traditions to be used in his
worship. Note this.
It was no offense to Caesar that Christ was called a Prophet, or a Priest by
office, but to call him self a King, that brought him to his death: Caesar cold
not endure it, so now a days Kings and Princes will be content, to have Christ
called by any name, that can be given him besides this, but you must not say
he is a King, the King, of his Church: every Magestrate now will be King
himself of the Church, therefore the Papists call the Pope, the King of the
Church, and those likewise that have shaken off the Popes authority, yet
themselves will be Lords in Gods house, and if Pastors will stand to
maintain, that there is no other king in the Church but Christ alone, there is
nothing under heaven, which will more endanger his life, then this; and yet
this is the confession we must stand unto, under the pain of loosing eternal
life, and this is that which Christ lost his life for: and for this we must be
willing, to lay down our lives, rather then to suffer any to be the King of
Saints, but Christ alone, and therefore it is, that the Apostle calls this a
good confession.

Objection.
But a man may ask me, why this is called a good confession, more then to have
confessed Christ to be the only high Priest, Ans.
and Prophet of his Church: I answer that both these acknowledgments are good,
for we must not acknowledge any more high Priests, to reconcile us to God, but
Christ alone, and he is the only Prophet of his Church, whose voice must
only be heard: but why is this acknowledgment of him to be king, called to be
a good confession above the rest.

Certainly there is great reason for this, and it is not without cause, that in
the scriptures of God, this title is given to him, more then any other titles:
all the kings of Israel, were but tipes of him, Solomon was but a shadow of
him, therefore the scriptures tell us, that when the Jews shall be gathered
together, they shall submit to David their king, meaning Christ. The reason of
it is, because in the Kingly office stands the crown of his glory, I say it
again, that the crown of his glory stands in his Kingly office: how ^o*
because God has not given to any, in heaven, or earth, by which a man can
besaved; but by the name of Jesus only: Now which is more, the Apostle writing
to the Ephesians in his first Chapter, speaking of the mighty power of God
that raised him up from the dead, and set him at his own right hand; in the
heavenly places, far above all principallities and powers, and might, and
dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but in the
world to come, and has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head,
over all things in the Church.

So the Apostle concludes the greatness of the son of God, by this, that God
has made him to be the head of the Church: who is the fulness of him that
fills all things: so that this exaltation of Christ to glory, and the
dignity which Christ is exalted unto, above all men, or angels, this is the
chief glory, and honor, of the son of God: we shall speak somewhat more
of this hereafter, how that all the other offices of Christ, they are but
servile: Christ does abase himself, to be the Prophet of his Church, and he
was not ashamed to take upon him, to teach the law of God, to the people with
his own mouth: neither was he ashamed, to take upon him to be our Priest, to
offer to God for sins of the world, in all these he was abased; and suffered
himself in a manner to be spoiled of his honor and glory: but when he comes
to his Kingdom, which he shows by his resurrection, and when he has
prevailed against his enemies, and had subdued sin, and Satan, then he
stands triumphing in heaven, and there sits at the righthand of God, and herein
stands his dignity: and it is a wonderful thing that the world considers it
not: those which were the former offices, to be Prophet or Priest in his
Church, stands in the abasing and humiliation of the son of God: but in his
kingly office stands his exaltation, this is his dignity and Royal
prerogative: he that medleth with it, medleth with the chiefest dignity of
Christ.

Furthermore as the former 2. offices of Christ are but servile functions, so
the third by virtue of his exaltation, makes the other 2. both effectual; both
his word, as Prophet, or of his sufferings as a Priest, depends upon his Royal
power, for except he have power over all things, he were not able to keep us
in his fear, nor present us into the favor of God, nor make it effectual to
salvation: for Satan, and sin and the world, would, prevail against us: but
Christ by his power is stronger then all, so as neither man, nor angel can
make frustrate that which he has done for his Church: therefore he is said
to be declared, to be the son of God, by the resurrection from the dead: who
was ever able to loose the sorrows of death, but he which is stronger then
death? Christ therefore by death, destroyed death, and him that had the power
of death, the devil: and for this cause, Christ says (speaking of the virtue
of his exaltation) to wit, John. 7.
his Blessing, when to his own he says, every one that thirsts, should
come unto him, and he would give them the waters of life, this he spoke of
the spirit, because Christ was not yet glorified: for until he was set in his
Kingdom he could not dispense his spirit to his disciples, as afterward he
did: therefore when he was to depart from his Disciples, he gave them
commandment, that they should not depart from Jerusalem, till he had endued
them with virtue from above, the world must be subdued to Christ, and therefore
he could not dispense that measure of the spirit, till after his ascension:
then did he send the Holy ghost down upon them, and endued them with all
virtues, necessary to speak all languages, and constantly to preach the
gospel, notwithstanding the opposition of men: so this was verified likewise
in the prophecy of Micha, concerning the pouring forth of the spirit upon all
flesh: it shows the great abundance of grace, that Christ should give his
elect, he being glorified, being made the head of the Church and was possessed
with all power to give grace: so this work of his Kingdom, is that which we
must take to heart, as being the ground of our comfort, to wit, that the King
of Saints, as he is called in the Revelation, he is with us, he it is that
fights our battles against the dragon, and the whore: his might, and power
only prevails; and the scripture tells us, that if we will fight,
valiantly, Christ shall tread Satan under our feet: all our strength, stands
in his strength; as the Apostle says, he was able to abound, and to want,
and to do all things through Christ that strengthened him: elsewhere he
says, with what power he labors to convert men unto God, by power from
him, which works mightily in him, where he did acknowledge, that all the
power he had, to do any good in Gods house, was even in Christ the son of
God alone: therefore says he, it is not I, but the grace of God that is in
me: seeing then that all the virtue of a Preacher, 1. Cor. 15.
and strenght of a Christian, and all the virtue of Christ's mediation, and
suffering, depends upon Christ's Kingdom, and power; how much the more should
we consider this with joy, as the Chief ground of our consolation, in all
dangers, to wit, that Christ the Lord, has all power given him in heaven,
and in earth, to give eternal life to those, that the Father has given unto
him, as he says of himself, the end of Gods giving such great power unto
Christ, is that he may bring his Children unto glory, therefore is he called
the Prince of our salvation, and he says, Heb. 2.
Christ being to bring many to glory, to consecrate the Prince of their
salvation: well then, this point being of such high moment, it is not without
cause, that the Apostle in this case, calls this confession of Christ, a good
confession, which is nothing but his professing himself to be King.

And the reason of it, may likewise be this, because Christ's prophetical, and
Priestly office, are in two respects, more easily embraced, then his kingly
office: first in what respect they are more manifested, and more sensible, and
more easy to be seen of the world, then his Kingly power, for he was seen
to teach on earth, and he taught with authority, and not as the scribes, and
Pharisees did, and he performed his Priestly office in the sight of all the
world, the world heard him preach, and the world saw him die: these are not
things of much secrecy, as this is: to wit, this man so base on earth: that
now they should see him Crowned with honor and glory: there is great
difference between the glory of his messengers here, and the glory of the
servants, or messengers of earthly kings: for the one is wholly earthly, and
the other is wholly spiritual, and heavenly, so that so far as heaven
differs from earth, so far differs Christ's Kingdom, from the Kingdoms of the
earth: his Kingdom stands not in fleshly pomp, but it stands wholly in the
spirit, and power of it.

So this brings us to the second point of his confession to wit, that his
Kingdom was not of this world: the Jews would have made Christ a King, but
he refused, and as he was a King, so he was constant to avouch the matter of
his kingdom to be spiritual, and not carnal; why should we that are his
ministers, make his glory, and his kingdom, a worldly kingdom: Do we not
thereby falsify Gods truth? seeing our master refused all carnal and wordly
authority: but only the power of the spirit, and why should we seek after a
carnal glory and pomp, when the glory of the son of God, and his kingdom
is not of this world: Certainly the less we are in the world, and the less we
are like to men in worldly honor: the more like we are to the son of God: if
we be clothed with grace, with Sanctification, and the truth of God dwell in
us plentifully, this should be our honor: and thus we see, how we are bound to
place the kingdom of Christ in this, wherein it stands, certainly, all
earthly power is so far from appertaining, to the kingdom of Christ: as that
those that seek it, walk not with an even foot, in the ministry, 1. Cor. 4.
neither does he the part of a faithful Minister: the Apostle has a strange
saying, and yet a true one, if our gospel be hid, it is hid in them that
perish, whom the God of this world has blinded: for we preach not our selves,
but Christ Jesus the Lord: and our selves your servants, for Christ's sake; and
that the excellency of the power, may be of God, and of Christ, that all the
world may see, that the power of our Ministry, is not from our selves, that we
should force your consciences to submit unto the son of God: for our
Ministry is wholly spiritual, as the Apostle tells us, that all the weapons of
our warfare, are from God in heaven: 1. Cor. 10.
they are not carnal, but mighty through God: it is God that makes the
gospel powerful, and that makes the labors of mortal men powerful to
subdue men to obedience. Thus to be brief, the second point of Christ's
confession is to disclame his kingdom, from being a worldly kingdom:
therefore we should Disclame all worldly pomp, and not compare Christ, to any
worldly petty king, for it is wholly spiritual, as the Lord says to his
peoples, to comfort them against the Egyptians: he says, the Egyptians are
flesh, and not spirit, as if he would say, they are but flesh, and therefore
they can do nothing, against the spirit.

The 3. point of his confession was this, that he came into the world, and was
borne to this end, to bear witness of the truth: wherefore this is to teach
Pastoures, to follow his footesteps, and to know what is our calling: wherefore
the Lord has sent us into this world: which was to bear witness of the
truth: God has not sent us into this world, to bear witness unto a lie, nor
to justify any falsehood, but to maintain the truth until death: as Christ
avouched this to be his office, and he did accordingly, so should we that are
Pastors acknowledge this to be our office: not to justify men's lies, but to
bear witness and record to Gods truth: so we see this affords great
instruction for us, to show us wherein our felicity stands, especially in
witnessing him to be our King, and his Kingdom not to be of this world, thus
the penitent thief did believe, that he was a King: and that his Kingdom was
not of this world: therefore he besought him, to remember him, when he came in
his Kingdom: and that we are sent of God, to bear witness unto his truth,
and for this we are to lay down our lives: it is a woeful thing to find
falsehood in him that witnesses the truth: the Apostle John, has a
comfortable saying of himself, in the end of his gospel, these things are
written, that ye may believe: these things we witness, and these things we
know are true: O would to God, Pastors would speak of nothing to Gods people,
but that they know to be Gods will, and not to teach men's foolish fancies, but
Gods truth only: for that will make us free, as Christ says in the 17. of
John, if you abide in my word, John. 17.
the truth shall make you free: so that our freedom in Gods sight, proceeds
from his truth, and he which teaches falsehood, cannot keep himself from
bondage, do what he can.

The last point of this confession, is this, who so ever is of the truth,
hears my voice, this might have bin thought, a very proud word of Christ at
that time: for he tells Pilate to his face, that he had no part in the truth:
what means he by the truth? certainly the word of God which is the immortal
seed, to beget men to be the sons of God, this is that Christ calls the
children of wisdom, saying, wisdom is justified of her children: this then is
the 4. part of Christ's confession, which he does boldly witness, even before
the judge, who had power to take his life from him: even to tell him to his
face, that he had no part in the truth, because he harkened not to his voice:
thus you see the substance of Christ's confession.

Let us now see if it concerns not us, in every point, and that as being
ministers, to follow his example: there are many things that we are to
confess: but the substance of it is this which Christ confessed: which, we
must keep, and observe, to the loss of our lives and where in stands the
faithfulness of a Pastor, according to the example of Christ? when no fear
to loose our lives, will make us to conceal, or to deny any part of Gods
truth, but we will witness it freely, and faithfully.

And if this were among us at this day, there would not be found such
eorrupting of his truth, in the house of God, as there now is: there would not
be such vain Inventions of men in the house of God, as there is: Pastors,
durst not deny his truth as they do, if they made conscience of this charge.

To be short, I will ad one word more, and so end, that is from the
circumstance of the place, where he did make this confession: and that was
under Pontius Pilate, even when he was arraigned and accused, and the sentence
of death, was ready to be pronounced against him: so as there was no escaping
for him; yet the fear of the Judge never terrified him* nor kept him from
witnessing, that he was the son of God: this is that the Apostle will have
us to consider: it is an easy matter for a Pastor, that has liberty as I
have now, to speak freely unto a people which have no power over my life; but
when a Pastor must answer for it, before Kings, and is in danger of his life,
then to stand to it, there is the trial of a faithful Pastor: a faithful
Pastor must do this, although it were before Pont. Pil., a faithful Pastor
must do this: he must not shrink for the terrors of the flesh: but we must
openly bear witness to the truth of God: so the circumstance of the danger
of the place where Christ did this, is that, we are to lay before us, how many
are there of us, that all though we have preached the truth of Christ: Yet if
it come to this, that either we must change our minds, or loose our livings:
how many are there, that basely falsify the truth of God, because they will
not loose the favor of the King, or of some great men, yea they will rather
falsify the truth of God for ever: how many such are there to be found in
this age, that contrary to their knowledge, and conscience, do bear witness
to falshoode and lies, only to uphould them in their livings, and in the favor
of men.

Let these men think of that sentence, the Apostle does speak of, where he
says; you have not resisted unto blood: where the Apostle accounts it a base
thing in a Christian, that will deny the truth when or before it come unto
blood.

I say it were a happy thing, if professors, nay if Pastors, would stand
unto the truth till it come unto blood, that other allurements, did not draw
them from the truth: the contrary hereof, does declare, how few faithful
Pastors God has in his church! and thus much for the circumstance of the
place, and of the danger that Christ was in; when he made this good confession,
under Pontius Pilate.

Let us make use of all: here we see, that of all whatsoever is written, or
spoken in the gospel, concerinng Christ the Pastor; that above all we should
lay this confession of Christ before our eyes, for the carriage of Christ,
before Pontius Pilate, is a lively pattern, for all ministers to follow: and
it is set down, not only to let us see, the manner of our redemption, but it
is likewise, to teach Pastors to know their duty* and to teach them, how to
walk in Gods house, to maintain his truth, when God shall call them to
suffer: the not consideration of this, makes many Pastors, and Christians,
careless of their duty, because they look not upon Christ for their
pattern. the Lord of his mercy, give Pastors grace, that they may follow
him: as in all things, so in this constancy, of maintaining his truth. Amen.

verse. 14. The third Sermon.
That thou keep this commandemt without spot unrebukable until the appearing
of our Lord Jesus Christ.


IN this commandment and charge give^ by the Apostle to Timothy, we have heard
already in what a weighty manner he imposes this duty upon all that are
Pastors and teachers unto the worlds end, It is a charge from the mouth of the
Apostle, and a charge in the sight of God and of God considered in his
omnipotency: in that he quickneth all things and it is before Jesus Christ to
be considered of us as, a pattern for us to follow in his witnessing a good
confession before Pontius Pilate.

Now it follows that we should speak of those things wherewithal Pastors
stand charged, what the matter is which is of this high moment which the
Apostle does lay with such authority upon all Pastors and teachers, and this
is laid down in this verse in these words, that thou keep this commandment
without spott unrebukeable u^till the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, this
is the matter, the keeping of this commandment, and the keeping of it without
spott unrekukeable, and continuing this till Christ appear again.

Now to encourage all pastors and teachers in the performance of this duetye
which must last til Christ's appearing again, he setts us down the assurance
of his coming again in the next verse, to keep us that we do not faint
under the difficulties that we shall find in keeping this commandment: until
Christ's second coming, which in his due time he will accomplish, God has
reserved this time in his own hands, and in his own time he will show it:
Now that we may be assured that God will perform this, he setts down a
glorious description of this God, that we may see in God wonderful and
undoubted reasons that God will in his time show the Lord Jesus again. This
description of God is one of the most magnificent descriptions that is set
down of God in all the scriptures, to let us see what need we have to take to
heart this precept.

First he setts down God that he is the most blessed one, which in his time
will show that he is the blessed.

Secondly that he is the only potentate, and this he illustrateth by more
particular demonstrations, in this that he is the King of Kings, and Lord of
Lords, his blessedness is further expounded in these particulars, 1. that he
has only immortality, 2. that he is inaccessible dwelling in that light
which no man has seen nor can see. This description he concludes with
ascribing to God two things, honor, and power everlasting, thus we see how
the Apostle in most divine manner and high style, does still propound this
charge to all those that are ministers of his word, that all the world may see
the necessity that lies upon Pastors and teachers to do their duetye, seeing
they are so straytlye charged before this God of might, majesty, and
blessedness, to whom belonges all power and glory, so that we must not dallye
in this point of keeping this commandment here charged upon us, therefore it
stands us upon under no less pain then the wrath of God, to keep this charge
against all the world that shall oppose it.

Now let us come to the words in particular, the first thing that all Pastors
are Charged with all, is the keeping of these commandents; and that is not
only charged upon them, but the keeping it without spot, and unrebukeable, the
time how long they must keep it, is set down, till the appearing of the Lord
Jesus; So we have 3. things in this precept, which the Apostle lays upon all
Ministers, to be considered by us. First we must consider what is the matter
we must keep without spot, unrebukeable, and that until the appearing again
of Christ.

The matter is, this commandment: What means the Apostle by this commandment?
by this, he means all the duties that he has in this Epistle charged upon all
Pastors and Teachers, this he calls a commandment, to let us see and
understand, that the office of Pastors so described as we have heard, is this
strait commandment of the liveing God, and it is the Law of God himself that
is laid upon us to keep.

Now he calls it a commandment, that we might understand what is the thing
that we must obey and practice and it is a great encouragement for us to do
this, since it is the charge of the liveing God, and the precepts which
Pastors must lay to heart, that these are the things which God has commanded.
Therefore those which make no conscience to transgress this charge, but they
will make all the order of Gods house to be indifferent, and will make all the
precepts of this Epistle to be alterable and changeable, as some cursed divines
have written to prove that this commandment of God may be changed, whereas we
see, the Apostle does charge us in the sight of God and of Christ, to keep
this commandment of God without spot, and that till Christ come. Again is
then this a changeable commandment? can any power of flesh or blood alter or
change this, when we are charged under pain of damnation to keep this as
inviolable, and unchangeable an ordinance? I say the curse of God must light
upon him that takes upon him, to alter any of these ordinances, seeing in so
streit a manner we are charged and commanded to hold them.

Well then, these things are commandments. I mark this for another end, and
not only to show that these things are not indifferent things for men to do,
or to leave undone; but this does likewise let us see, that these are of the
nature of such things which are absolutely necessary, and therefore are not
only counsels as the Papists speak, when they make distinctions betwixt
precepts and councels, and they make these things not necessary, but voluntary.

And in nothing under the Tun has the Church of Rome gone more against Gods
ordinances, and commandments then in this, yea they have wholly trodden this
precept under their feet, which here the Apostle commands them to keep so
straightly, that neither the function it self may be abolished, nor any
particulars of them may be neglected of any Bishop, nor the duty he should
perform in preaching or in Governing, but long since all is changed among
them, and a new fashion is set up in the ordring of Gods house, which God never
commanded.

We have the more need to look unto our selfs in this, seeing there is no
precept of God which has been more adulterated and violated then this precept
of the Apostle, yea not only in popery is this so, but this violation of it
remains in the reformed Churches themselves, our duty is therefore in this
respect to look to our selves, and see how short we come of performing this
commandment, and how we shall answer in the day of Judgment for our abuse
thereof.

Next, observe upon whom this charge is laid, it is laid, upon Timothy, and in
his person upon all Pastors, by which we may see who are cheifely to keep
this order in Gods house, which are the Pastors in Gods house, most and
Cheifely here charged on us, it is not on the Magistrate so much laid to keep,
at it is charged on us, and judgme^ts shall light upon us if we keep not this
charge, we are they that are commanded of God to look to this, the ordering of
Gods house is not so much committed to any as to us, therefore we must look to
it; Let the world rage as they will against pastors, yet they may not neglect
to keep this.

If the Apostle had not known that this was a difficult thing to practice,,
and that there would be mighty opposition against it, he would not have laid
the necessity of doing it, with such weighty charge as he has done, but he
knew that the world would not endure to worship God as they are here commanded,
therefore he had great care to back this commandment with the waightyer
authority of the liveing God, now we see who it is that is cheifely charged for
the ordering of Gods house, namely his ministers. It is a woeful thing, and the
Lord in mercy forgive this iniquity, for now every mann will have a law for
Pastors and Teachers, he must not preach but as they will, neither must he
administer the sacraments, but as they please, whereas the Lord of Lords has
commanded to keep his ordinances pure, and therefore it is a great arrogance
against God and his ordinances, for men to lay any law upon Gods ministers,
how they should order Gods house, nay happy were the church of God, if Pastors
were not thus led away, that those which are appointed over the church of God
to direct it, that they themselves are led away by others, by which means
religion is come to ruin, let them which usurp this authority, take example
by Ahaz and Vzziah the King, who for usurping the Priests office and presuming
to offer incense, was stricken with Leprosy, and so remained all his days, the
other for presuming to make a more costly altar.

By this we may see how dangerous it is to meddle with the holy things of God
without a calling, which is set apart for those God has ordained for that end,
we are said in the scriptures to be those that are set over you to rule you,
and admonish and instruct you, and you are commanded to obey us; why is this?
but to show you that we are the men which God has given the authority and
power unto, to order the affairs of his house in his worship.

To come more particularly to speak of this keeping of it. Keeping is our
duty; wherefore then does the Apostle use these words, that thou keep this
commandment? he knew Satan would steal it away if he could pervert the
Pastors by the glittering shows of honors, and earthly preferment, and so
Satan by men of corrupt minds has usurped this holy order; against this, all
Gods Servants must stand courageously, and Pastors must keep it, and hold it
fast. A Pastor cannot be more unfaithful in any thing then in this, to suffer
the power that God has put into his hands to be taken from him, in this he is
as unfaithful to God as he can be in any thing, the Priests of old were not
ashamed to oppose themselves to Kings, telling them plainly to their faces,
that it belonged not to them but unto the Priests to do this and that; so it
becomes Ministers well, to say to any Magistrate under heaven, that the
ordering of Gods house, the affairs belonging to his true worship is not in
them to prescribe any other manner then the Lord Jesus Christ has by his
Apostles prescribed; It is the Magistrates duty to order the common wealth, and
the affairs of policy, but for Magistrates to take this authority from
Ministers which Christ has given them, and so to betray the Church of God, and
deprive them of their lawful power which Christ has committed into their
hands, is an high dishonor to God, and a vyolating of this grand charge which
the Apostle has so straightly commanded.

That this superstitious Church of Rome and the Idolatrous tricks in these
points of their Religion, there is more duty observed, then among Christians,
for among them none of their Magistrates meddle with the Ministers Authority,
but in humility they submit to the order of their laws to them which are their
teathers, whereas none are so undutifull unto God, as Christians are in the
reformed Church, for there the Magistrate usurpes the place of Pastors, and
this is the cause why that amongst the Magistrates that are at this day, that
God treads them, and their authority under foot, and gives them over unto so
many Judgments, all because neither God nor his servants can have that respect
or honor among Christians, as the servants of Satan have amongst Infidels.

Let us mark it then, we are commanded to keep this precept, and not to
suffer it to be taken from his Church. This keeping has many parts.

Many meant hinke it well kept if they keep it where it is written, and this
they both should and ought to do, that is, they must see that the Word of God
perish not, but that it may remain as a perpetual law to bind the
conscience of the saints unto the worlds end: but this is not enough honely to
keep it in print in a book, but we must have it in possession, as John is
commanded in the Revelation, having a little book given him, he is commanded
to eat it, they must lay it up within them in their hearts, so that the
teachers of Gods Word should be well instructed in those doctrines which God
has charged him withal, to keep till the end of the world; This is that
which Christ requires himself of every Christian, that they keep his word, it
is not enough to lay the Bible besides thee in the house that will serve the
turn, but he will have thee to read in it, and to meditate in it day and night,
and to keep it in thy mind, as the Apostles of Chist are said, to lay up
Christ's words in their hearts, and God opened the heart of Lydia that she gave
heed to the things, that Paul spoke. This is the keeping of his commandments,
whenas they do not only keep them in writings, but in their hearts, and have
knowledge to do them, and he commands us by keeping them to practice them, so
all Pastors are bound to practice them contynually, and to perform whatsoever
precepts concern their duty which the Apostle has set down in this epistle,
if they look that God shall approve of them in the day of their great account.

And not this only is to be meant by the Apostle, but more also, that we must
not suffer this commandment to be changed or altered, or to perish or decay,
but we must bold it in perpetual use in the house of God, and if it be fallen,
Pastors must raise it up, if it be corrupted, 1. Cor. 11.
Pastors must reform it, if it be changed, Pastors must bring it to the
ancient institution, as Paul did in Corinth, where he found the celebration
of the Lords supper corrupted amongst them, he reduced it to the first
institution by Christ, to reform them to the right practice of that duty which
they had corrupted: so likewise in many other churches where the truth of
doctrine concerning justification was corrupted, the Apostle in his epistle to
the Romans, to the Ephesians, Colossians, Philippians, Gallatians, reforming
the miserable abuses wherewith Gods worship was profaned, in which he reformed
the errors, as does appear in these epistles, to enforce their wicked hearts to
bow to Gods ordinances, for, the priests lips shall preserve knowledge, and
they shall ask the law at his mouth: But alas now adays ministers must take the
law from other men's mouths, and they must do nothing but as other men direct
them, whereas it is his part to instruct all by the law of God, as we have
showed what a strait charge God has laid on his messengers which they must not
be ignorant of, he must keep this commandment that it be not altered nor
corrupted, I tell you that these alterations will bring the fierce wrath of
God on us, we protest before God we desire to walk in the truth of God, and
we have showed the truth, and if ye will not suffer yourselvs to obey this
truth we have taught you, your blood be upon your own heads, for unto
alterations we will never consent, and if God assist us, while we breath, I
will yeald to do no otherwise then is here commanded, the ministers they must
keep this, and preserve this, and not suffer it to be altered or changed for
any man's pleasure in the world, the keeping of this is the maine part of the
Pastors office, as he will avoid the wrath of God and of Christ at his
appearing.

Now let us consider the manner how they must be kept; and here we may take
notice of another misery in our time, which is, preaching is kept, the
Sacraments are kept, and the ministry is kept, but whether these be kept
without spot or rebuke judge ye, first consider the meaning of the words, there
be many which do putt no difference between these two words; but only this,
that the first word spot signifies a lesser slip in the duty of the ministry,
and the second word unrebukable signifies greater offenses in the duty of the
ministry, some reason there is for this distinction, for there are some things
as spotts, which are not worthy to be reproved, but that which is worthy
reproof is a palpable sin: but the true distinction of these words is this,
according to the new Testament, there is a two fold thing to be observed by
Pastors in the work of the ministry, the first is without spott which argues
his inward sincerity in his judgment, mind and understanding; and unrebukeable
is in respect of his outward practice before the world, and these two words we
may either referr to the person that is commanded these duties, or to the
commandment itself, which they stand bound to keep, either to the
commandment, that he keep it without spot, or that he keep himself without
reproof, both these stand with the truth of the Scriptures, elsewhere we must
keep the practice of this commandment without spott or rebuke, and we must keep
our selves without rebuke, that the word of God be not evil spoken of by our
iniquityes, and that we suffer nothing to be added or taken away from the
blessed ordinances of God, for every addition of man to Gods ordinance is a
blott, every device of man is a fleshly spott, it pollutes and defiles the
things that are holy, and the teaching of them by profane pastors does pollute
the holy commandment of God, yea to suffer them to be dispensed profanely in a
profane manner, or in an unlawful form, contrary to the patrern which the
Apostles have set before us is miserable profanesse.

Besides as men should keep the word and ordinances of God pure and unpolluted
in the sight of God: so he must keep this charge himself in his own person in
an unspotted manner, and certainly this is principally to be referred to the
persons, for a man cannot spot himself, but he must defile the work he has
in hand, if he deserve rebuke himself, then he brings rebuke thereby upon his
office; It is a ministers going out of the way, and yealding to men's
traditions, which brings pollutions upon Gods ordinances; If ministers would
stand fast, and not dispense otherwise then they are commanded, it is most
certain Gods worship should never be so polluted, there never came pollution
into Gods house, but it came in by those that had the charge of Gods house, all
the blotting of Gods ordinances came in by those that had the power to
dispense them.

But mark, in them two things are to be looked unto, first they must be
without spot, secondly they must be without rebuke, to be without spot, I take
it (as before) to be meant, of an undefiled conscience, judgment and
affections, by yealding unto any devices of men, so that if he suffer his
judgment to be defiled, or his affections to be polluted, or suffer any evil
thing to take place besides or contrary to this commandment, he is a polluted
person before God, therefore he must keep himself unpolluted, and then his
practice will be unpolluted, for it is true as Christ tells us in the Gospel,
that out of the abundaunce of the heart the mouth speaks, and so the hand
practices; out of an evil heart coms evil practices, so that if a Pastor
his heart be kept pure and spotless, he will embrace nothing but the truth of
God, he will suffer nothing to defile Gods ordinances, but he will be sure to
keep them pure and unpolluted: whereas on the contraty if the hearts of
scismaticks and heretics were seen, and the hearts of all that corrupt Gods
truth, if we had spiritual eyes we might discern the corrupters of the
truth of God, there is no sound cleanesse in them who maintain idle toys,
and set them down in place of solid substanciall truths of Gods worship, in
such men's hearts is nothing but a stinking idol of corruption.

Secondly as a Pastor must not only keep himself pure within, so must he not
suffer his affections to he taynted without, but that he keep them pure in
his own integrity, so that he keep himself unrebukable, and this will follow
on the former, for so long as he remains without spott, so long the world
cannot find fault with his practice, they may bark at his practice, they may
backbite him, and say of him as they did of Christ, that he had a devil, but
in truth to lay ought to his charge they cannot, for it is most certain that a
pure practice flows from a pure heart, that there can be no just cause of
reproach against him which keeps himself within the compass of Gods truth, we
know how against Christ they hired witnesses to get matter to charge him with,
when in truth they could find nothing against him, yea the same Scribes and
Pharisees when they sent for the Apostles, and caused them to be scourged, yet
they could find nothing to lay to their charg, to punish them, because they
did keep themselves pure, and kept this commandment without spott, so they
were punished not for any vice, nay they themselves were constrained to
confess, that they had nothing to tax them with, and that they had nothing to
accuse Christ, yet they said, if we suffer this man to live the whole world
will follow after him; So at this day there be many that punish Gods servants,
not for any fault they can find in their ministrye, but because their own
authority and policy would be taken from them, if they suffer Gods truth to be
spoken plainly. To go forward, we see ministers must do nothing which may
give just occasion to the world, to blame them, because he is charged before
God that he keep this commandment without spott. But why does the Apostle
this? since (as I have said) he must walk, more holy then Christ if it were
possible, that they should not be evil spoken of, and Christ tells his
Apostles that all shall speak evil of them for his sake, and this Pastors
must expect to find of men, not for that he handles the Word of God
deceitfully, but because he teaches the truth in sincerity in the evidence of
the spirit to the consciences of all men in the sight of God* as the Apostle
avoucheth concerning himself, that he had preached the truth in the evidence,
of the truth, and in the spirit of God, to their consciences, so that if their
consciences were examined before God, they durst not but say he is faithful;
therefore the Apostle says, if the Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are
lost, and shall perish, so that the wicked themselves, as Peter tells us, shall be
compelled to justify, them in the day of their visitation, they that rail
upon them now, shall be forced to justify them, these then be the two things
which the Spirit of God will have Pastors to look unto, that they keep this
commandment, without spott or rebuke. Out of this we may see and discern,
what the estate of Gods church is this day, there is no church under the sun
but is guilty of one of these two miseries, the one is this, that Pastors
cannot be suffered to perform this, or else that Pastors have suffered
themselves to be corrupted to do the contrary, either their hands are
shortened that they have no liberty, that though they would never so feign
practice Gods commandments, yet they cannot get liberty to do it, or if they
have liberty to do something, yet not all things: he may do a part, yet not
the vhole truth of God, this is one of the miseries which lies upon the Church
of God this day; I will not enter into judgment whether the fault be in the
Pastors, or in the people, but this I am sure, if there were more courage in
Pastors for Gods truth then there is, it were well, we will leave them to
answer for themselves, which are guiltye of it.

The second impiety is this, that Pastors for the pleasure of men have
corrupted the ordinances of God many ways, even in the reformed churches,
which they have taken from the church of Rome, see what corruption now there is
in Gods house in many places, see if such be chosen for Bishops as the Apostle
has here described in this epistle, come to the administration of the
Sacraments, and then unto the preachers of the word, is any thing more
corrupted than they are? is any thing left of public prayers and preaching
or of administration of the Sacraments according to Gods appointment? is that
order of government practiced among them as the Apostle has here laid down for
the churches practice? Let them look to this epistle, and judge themselves
according to the rules here set down, and do not say because it is like the
best church, therefore it is the best church; No, if it be not according to this
commandment it is accursed, I need not speak of this, for it is too palpable
and abominable. In many churches there is all corrupted, they will have men's
inventions, they are not content with Gods ordinances, but they will have them
to be mingled with human inventions, or with the devises of that cursed church
of Rome; this is no small cause of Gods anger, and of his fierce wrath, to see
this charge thus to be trodden under foot by Pastors, who have so little
studied this portion of scripture: they learn all things which others should
practice, and learn nothing which themselves should practice and learn,

We all know this, that a physician that studies natural physic for the good
of men's bodies, that it is a dangerous thing if he shall proffer any physic
to the patient, except those things that are of use, and with such mixtures
which are profitable for the sick, because a little thing amiss may kill the
patient: and do we think that there is such danger in natural helps for the
preserving of our natural life, and is there not much more danger in
corrupting of the spiritual medicine, which should keep us in the life of God
that it be-not extinguished? what a woeful change is it to corrupt the word and
Sacraments, so that there is nothing but the very poisoning of the word and
Sacraments, it is nothing else but poysening the ordinances of God. The
Apostle letts us see this plainly, that the force of saving grace is taken from
Gods ordinances when they are done otherwise the^ he commanded. In the 1 Cor:
1. The Apostle shows the reason why he will not preach the Gospel in the
intiseinge words of man's wisdom, lest (says he) I should make the cross of
Christ of none effect; and is it not a strange thing that the preaching of the
word in the intiseing words of man's wisdom or eloquence should take away the
force of Christ cruifyed from saving of our souls? and yet the Apostle says
it does so.

In the 1. Corinths 11.20. When ye come together therefore into one place this
is not to eat the Lords body, or Lords supper, the abuse in eating the Lords
supper made that it could not serve as Gods ordinance to comfort the
conscience, thus we may see the saving force of Gods ordinances are taken
away, when they are polluted by human authority and vain inventions.

To go further you see how purely and without spot God will have his
ordinances to be kept, he will not have men to deal with them, but that they
must be kept entire and pure, but how long must they be so kept? until the
appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, what an important charge may this seem to
be unto Timothy! This letts us see two things in the duty that God has
charged on all Pastors, first that in this charge all Ministers are charged
with it, and that this is not a commandment to Timothy only in his time, but
for all that shall follow in the ministry unto the end of the world, till
Christ appear again.

Secondly let us see another thing, namely, how this must be done, every
Minister must keep it pure, and pure he must deliver it into the hands of them
which shall succeed him, that is, he must keep it sincere, as the Apostle tells
Timothy in his second Epistle, deliver that thou have received unto faithful
men, that they may deliver it to others, there must be a delivering of it from
hand to hand as the Apostle taught Timothy, so should he teach other Ministers,
that they should so preach and administer the sacraments, as they might be
examples unto them that should come after them to do the like, and this
Timothy is said to do this, till Christ's appearing when he does it all his
own time.

Oh what a fearful thing is it when Pastors are not careful to leave the
ordinances of God and of Christ, and the purity of them to those that follow
after them, they know not what they must answer, for who are examples of the
contrary, oh with trembling remember the history of Jeroboam the King of
Israel, who was the first that caused the Jews to separate from the Temple of
Solomon, and he is branded with this note, Jeroboam, that made Israel to
sin, he was the first occasion of it, and he is charged above all, for
corrupting the Worship of God: The like we read before of Gideon Judges 8. who
thinking to adorn an ornament God had commanded his Priests to wear, but it
was abomination unto the Lord, and it was the utter destruction of him and his
house, for which the Lord records all Israel went a whoring after it.

If those men were so noted that have caused the Church to err from Gods law,
and not embrace his order he has set down, but in the place of it to receive
idle ceremonies, certainly they shall know, that God takes this to remembrance
and more to his heart then they do dream of, yea they shall see that of all
men they are liable to the greatest judgment in the sight of God, their own
devices shall aggravate their judgment for corrupting the Church of God,
therefore faithful Pastors must have a double care in their own persons and
of others committed to their charge, that they keep it without spott, and that
they deliver it to others without spott.

Again we do here see that these ordinances are not to be changed so long as
the world endures, the Apostle to the Hebrews comparing the law with the
Gospel, and the dispensation of the Gospel to the dispensation under the law,
he calls them both Kingdoms, because they were in his church where his Kingdom
is; now says the Apostle this word once more signifies the remooving of those
things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things that
cannot be shaken may remain, where the Apostle shows that the dispensation
under the law was not to continue; but (says he) we receiving a Kingdom which
cannott be moved, let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptablie with
reverence and godly fear, so that these ordinances of his Kingdom under the
Gospel they cannot be shaken, except thou will shake thyself out of Gods
Kingdom; This Kingdom must remain constant till the end of the world, so that
it is a fearful matter when men keep not this in their time, since it must not
be changed till the worlds end, yet there is scarce any degree of men in the
ministry that does not pervert this.

What a fearful and dangerous matter is it to us, that we cannot keep it for
so short a time? and if the Kingdom of God had stood and his ordinances
according to his truth, here prescribed, there had never been another
ministry nor an other government, or other doctrine then this here commanded,
if Gods will were observed, and Pastors had been faithful, they would never
have corrupted Gods ordinances and worship as they have done, This Epistle is
the only form that God allows, and by which ministers shall be examined, for men
need not to doubt how the Church may be reformed and set in right order, if
the fear of God did possess their hearts to look unto this Epistle, but when
this is not looked unto, nor regarded, but what will please men, and what is
the custom of these times, this makes that Gods house is pestered with
vanities, and still remains defiled, and if Pastors would bend their studies
to learn this Epistle, it would show them their folly, and therefore all which
labor to avoid Gods fierce wrath in this age, and love the salvation of their
souls in obeying God according to his ordinances, let them read and understand
this Epistle, for this will teach them the truth of God, how his Church should
be ordered and governed.

One lesson more I will ad, and withal will make an end, This commandment
you see is to be kept till the worlds end, let us gather this lesson from it.
Has God charged his Church to do this, and will he not have his Church to
practice it? let the devil and Antichrist rage as they will, and rage against
his servants, yet the Lord will keep them, and this commandment shall be kept
till Christ's coming again in despite of them, though not in the most part of
the world, yet in some obscure places he will have his own witnesses to stand
for him, to convince the world of error, the reason of it is this, God gives no
commandment to his church that he will have kept to the worlds end, but it
must stand as long as the time that he has appointed it, so that all the power
of darkness shall not root it out of the world, although they may banish it in
many countries, but out of the world they shall never banish it, but there
shall be one or other that shall stand for the truth.

This we may see has been accomplished, as we find in historyes, although
many of their testimonies are suppressed, yet in all ages God has had sundry
who have mainteyned the truth, so that there shall be a Church of God in which
the purity of his worship shall be mainteyned, so long as the world shall
remain. It is testified that Noe condemned the world, so the testimony of
Christ's witnesses shall be condemnation to the world, to this end the Apostle
says, if our Gospel be hid it is hid in them that are lost, in whom the God
of this world has blinded their minds; So God and Christ will and shall be
worshipped, although obscurely, although not at Jerusalem nor among the scribes
and pharisees, yet in the wilderness there shall be a John Baptist; or in some
corner of the earth or other God will have his faitfull witnesses, for this
commandment shall take place as long as God does reign, although the tyrants
of the earth obscure it, this is most sure, that his Gospel is an everlasting
Gospel, and God will keep it in some corner of the earth till the end of the
world, therefore raise up your hearts with joy, although it be put down in
this or that place, yet it shall be raised again in an other quarter of the
world, it came from the East to us, and we had it a long time, and now it is
going from us, and God has appointed another place to receive it, never shall
God want a place to keep his ordinances, let the world do what they can to
hinder it, it is vain for men to seek to suppress that which God will have
kept.

1. Tim. 6.15. Which in his times he shall show, who is the blessed, and only
Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.


HAving spoken of this description of God in general, The 4* Sermon.
now (considering the order of the words) we will come and speak of them in
particular. First let us speak of them in particular, and first of Gods power,
then of his blessedness, for the proof of this, is set down the contrary
order, he named blessed first, but he setts down power last, his power is
this, because he is the only Potentate, that is, he is the Lord of al powers
and principalityes, the argument is this, he that is the King of Kings and Lord
of Lords, he must needs be the only potentate in heaven and earth, and so it
is that God is the head of all principallityes and powers, therefore he must
needs be the only Potentate. It is strange that this argument should hold,
since it is granted that there are many Kings and Lords besides God, how then
can this prove God to be the only Potentate, there being other Kings and Lords
besides him?

It would seem by this property here ascribed unto God, that it would confirm
the false fancyes of the Anabaptists, who hold, that now under the Gospel
there should be no Magistrate but God only, because in the New Testament he is
called the only Potentate, and this is one of their grownds whereupon they
build their opinion: but the argument of the Apostle does manifest the
contrary, so the argument is set down by the Apostle in great wisdom, for this
argument does not take away all Magistrates in the world, but only makes God
to be over them all, to be the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, now if there
were no more Kings nor Lords but God alone, how could he then be the King of
Kings and Lord of Lords? So that the very words of the Apostles argument do
confute this vanity, and lets us see that the authority which he claymes to
God, does not take away man's authority over their subjects, but lets that
remain still, notwithstanding that God is King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

But to understand aright what is the Apostles meaning in his argument, it is
of great force, for God is said to be King of Kings in diverse respects, first
because there is not a King or Lord but by him it is, and by him Kings reign,
it is he only that rayseth to authority, and none but he, so for this reason
God is said to be the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, because they have not
their authority but from God, and this is that for which Nabuchadnezar that
great king of Babell did suffer such a great judgmente from God, as to be cast
out from amongst men, and to live among beasts for the space of seven years,
that he might know that the most high had rule over the Kingdoms of men, as
Daniel tells him in plain terms, because he in the pride of his heart did
think he had raised himself to his honor, when these words came out of his
mouth, Js not this great Babell which I have built for mine honor, and Honor
of my Kingdom? Immediately his kingdom was taken from him, until he was
forced to acknowledge that the most high had rule over men, this is a fearful
spectacle to teach kings to know from whom they have their kingdoms and their
authority. Pilate when he did boast of his authority to Christ, saying unto
him, know thou not I can save thee or take thy life from thee? Christ
answered him, thou could not have any power over me except it were given
thee from above. This is the first reason why God is called the king of kings
and Lord of Lords, because it is not by succession, nor by birth that kings
come to rule over others, but by the special providence of God, and this is
the reason why we must reverence them that are in authority, because (says the
Apostle) all authority is of God.

The second reason why God is called the king of kings is this, because he
never made king yet of absolute power, he never yet made an absolute king on
earth, but allwaies made them substitutes to himself in authority, reserving to
himself the supreme authority over them to thrust them out of their thrones
whenever it pleased him. All the kings of the world are but subjects to the
king of heaven, so that even in their ruling, and exercising of their power,
they are to know there is another power above them, unto which they must give
an account of all their doings, for the Lord will not let the power he has
over them to go out of his own hands, so that no kings nor Lords have any
power to do as they list. This shows that kings must render an account of all
their actions to God.
It is blasphemy to say that any king has absolute power, for that is as much
as to set him in the throne of God, for there is no absolute king but God
alone, and this is the second reason why the spirit of God describes the power
of God after this manner, to prove him the only Potentate, if he that is a
king have another power above him which is the Lord, the^ must this Lord be
the only Pote^tate; but every king has the Lord above him, so as he ca^ hold
it no longer then it pleases him, neither can his race enjoy it longer then
God will suffer it; therefore the Lord took away the kingdoms from some, and
gave it to others, he took away authority from the house of David, and gave it
to Jeroboam, and for the iniquityes of Jeroboam he took it from Ahab and gave
it unto Iehu, many changes of kingdoms the Lord has made, taking kings out of
their thrones, and placing their enemies in their places, to let us see that
kings are not absolute Lords on earth, but they are at the Lords disposing, at
his pleasure.

Thus we see the third reason proved, wherefore the Apostle describes the power
of God after this manner, that by necessary evidences he concludes the main
point. Since there is not a power or Potentate, but God is the only Potentate
to do with men as himself please, it is he that casts down, and it is he
that rayseth up, and thus he will have all men to know, but specially his
ministers to know this.

There is a fourth reason of this manner of describing God, and that is for the
comfort of his children, which I have touched before, to arm them against all
the terrors of kings, that the terror of no power make them to dispense with
the ordinances of this great Potentate, therefore he would imprint this in
their minds, that God is the king of kings, therefore no king can do more harm
to them then it pleases God, this is comfort, and the same which Christ gives
his desciples in the tenth of Matthew, where he bids them not to fear them that
can only kill the body, for he tells them that their lives are more precious
then birds, and are there not so many sparrows sold for a farthing? and yet
not one of them shall fall to the grownd without the providence of God,
therefore Christ knowing that power was given over him, though he could have
prayed to his Father and obtained legions of Angels, yet he would not, because
he knew there was no resistance of Gods will, therefore he comforts himself
against the loosing of Pilate, that he had no power but was given him from
above. First of all this, letts us see that it is a vain thing to be astonished
at the fury of Princes, it is but miserable weakness of men that know what God
is, certain it is if we serve God aright we would not be moved with the fear of
any man in the world.

Ye see when as Jeroboam would have apprehended the Prophet that God sent to
threaten his judgments upon him for his idolatry, when he stretched out his
hand, to apprehend him, God so decred that his hand withered, that when he had
stretched it out, he could not pull it in again; This God that could make the
hand of a King to wither when he did oppose the counsel of God, what need any
man to fear, whenas our Savior and God is on our side. We know what Saul did
unto David, he did use all his skill to destroy him, but it was unpossible for
him to do it because God who is the King of Kings was with David, and God did
show his power against Saul in this, when he put Saul's life into David's hands,
but he never put David's life into Saules hands. We know what enmity Ahab had
against Elias the Prophet, yet the Lord co^mau^ds him to go to him, and the
Prophet answered the Lord, that he sought his life, but the Lord answered him
saying, go, be not afraid, and the Prophet goes to him and tells him that it
was he that troubled Israel, and the Lord restrained him that he could do the
Prophet no harm. Infinite examples in the Scriptures we have of this, to let
us see, that he can hold Kings that they shall do no more harm then God will
suffer them, to prove this truth of God, that he is King of Kings and Lord of
Lords.

To come yet to make more use of this, why does the Apostle lay this before us,
the use is partly for Kings, and partly for us, the first lesson for Kings is
this that I touched before concerning Nabuchadnezar, how God forced him to
learn how to know God to be the King of Kings, therefore let all Potentates
learn to know that God has rule over them, and their Kingdoms, and it is he
that makes them Kings, and serts them in their thrones, and if they do not
this, it is just with God to make them will they nill they, to acknowledge this
to their destruction, for the saying of Isaie shall be accomplished which the
Lord there speaks, all knees shall bow to him, and every mouth shall confess
him to be the Lord, for the Lord will not suffer himself long to be despised,
but in his own time he will challenge his right, in despite of the world: it
were a blessed thing if Kings would consider this, that it is by God that they
do reign, observe what it is Christ shall do in the last day, the proper
effect of this Kingdom shall be to put down all principallityes and powers, and
to give up his Kingdom to God, that God may be all in all, 1. Corin: 15, then
shall they see the truth of this, that he is the King of Kings and Lord of
Lords, if Kings would consider this, that the time shall come, that the world
shall not have a Kingdom nor King but God alone, me thinks they would then
reverence this God in greater measure then they do, but this sort of doctrine
is harsh to Princes ears, to think that there is a God above them, or that
there should be any of whom they hold their scepter, and yet they must know
this, or feel the truth of it by experience in Gods judgment.

The second use for Kings and Lords is this, that the Apostle does teach them
to do that which is right to all men, that they oppress no man, because they
have a King over them in heaven, unto whom they must give an account of their
doings; This Argument the Apostle uses to Masters in sundry places, that they
should do that that is right to their servants, knowing they have a master in
Heaven. If superiors would but acknowledge this that they have a Lord over
them, that shall take a reckoning of them as well as they take a reckoning with
their inferiors, surely it would make them to do nothing but that which is
right, these are the uses that do concern Kings and rulers.

Now there is great use of this likewise for ourselvs, besides the
encouragement it gives us, not to be afraid of any power in the world, but it
teaches us this lesson, not to resist power nor authority, because there is no
power nor authority but it is from God as the Apostle shows.

Now since all authority is of God, he that resists authority he resists
God, but some object, what if they be tyrants and merciles men: and such as
make no conscience to do wrong? I answer even as the Apostle does to
servants, whom he commands to be subject, not only to their good masters, and
such as are gentle; but also to them which are froward: so I say, if thou will
do thy duty, thou ought rather to suffer wrong, and to suffer thyself to be
oppressed, rather then to lift up thyself against authority which thou art
under, for if this bond of subjection to Princes were loosed, Kingdoms could
not stand, if every servant should stand against their master, and every
subject against his Prince, when he is wronged, no common wealth could stand,
it is true we may use all lawful means to eschew wrong, and Magistrates may
plead in Parliament with their Princes, for they have also their authority from
God, we ought to use all lawful means to escape wrong, but if there be no
possibility of escaping, we must rather suffer them to wrong us, for power and
authority is to be reverenced as being of God, and indeed God does sometimes in
justice give bad rulers to avenge himself for the sins of his people; he gave
to Israel a King in his wrath, and he stirred up a wicked King in Israel to
avenge himself upon the people for their idolatry, do you not think but that
the devil is Gods instrument against the wicked, so is every wiked king the
Lords scourge, the rod of his justice to inflict upon his enemies, when as good
rulers are the blessings of God upon a people that are careful to please him,
the Lord will make them nursing Fathers and Mothers unto his church, and so God
in his infinite wisdom makes Kings and Rulers to subjects as he sees cause,
either to plague them or to preserve them, this is the secret of Gods
providence, thus to order the World according as he sees they carry themselves
toward him; we see that so long as Israel did not know God, so long God gave
them into their enemies hands, and they had tyrants to rule over them, but when
they sought the Lord as they should and ought, the Lord gave them gracious
judges to deliver them out of the hands of their enemies, and as soon as they
fell from God again, God took those rulers from them again, and made their
enemies their Lords: to let us see the truth of this, that it is our sin
against God which causes him to send wicked tyrants over a people, to repay
them home according as they have dealt with him, and it is his mercy to his
own, that he gives them good and gracious rulers. Alwais it teaches us this,
that reverence must be given to him which God has set in authority over us,
since they are set over us by God. To come yet nearer to the point, does not
God give power to the devil to be the prince of the air? How could he
prevail as he does over the souls and bodies of men, if God did not give him
liberty? look to the history of Job, what could he do against Job? nothing
but by the permission of God, so in the Gospel when there were two men
possessed of the devil, which met Christ in the way, and he dispossessed the
devils, when they were cast out, they had not so much power as to possess the
swine, till Christ gave them leave, and so does God give power to the devil as
we read in the Revelation, where it is said that he setts up his viccar in the
Church, who shall exercise the power of the devil in the Church, and yet all
this is of God, to punish the wickedness of the world, and to avenge himself
upon his enemies which have not the knowledge of God as they should, and if God
give such power to wicked men, it is to make them his firebrands, to plague the
contemners of God and despisers of his word.

But to go farther, this is not only a lesson to teach us not to be afraid of
men's terror, and to reverence the whom God has set in authority over us: but
likewise it servs us for another lesson, and that is this, that Kings, and
Superiors we are to obey in the Lord, and no farther, for they have a Lord
over them who has made them our Lords, therefore I must obey them but in the
Lord, observe this
we must not obey the king against that king that made him a king, for God is
the king of kings and Lord of all Lords, and therefore above all he is to be
obeyed, though it should cost us our lives, yet we must not obey princes to the
prejudice of God, it would be thought treason; if a subject should harken to an
inferior Magistrate against his own king, he that does aniething at the
command of his king, which is contrary to the word of God he is atraitour to
Christ.
although the king had made him a Magistrate, yet if I should hearken unto him
in any thing against my prince, I were a traitor to any prince, and is it so
amongst men, and shall not God have the like authority? kings are but Gods
subjects, and inferior Magistrates under him, and is it not high treason to
obey them against God? So all obedience that is given unto princes under
pretense of subjection to the^, being contrary to Gods will, is rebellion
against God and thus much concerning the power of God, that he is the King of
Kings and Lord of Lords.

Now only blessed* we have heard already how that he is the only potentate,
Now we shall see that none is so blessed as he, and blessedness can be expected
from none but from him alone, for who can make a man blessed that is not
blessed in himself, but God alone? therefore it is vain to think to have an
happy and blessed estate from any Princes under heaven, except from God alone,
for only he which has blessedness without measure can bestow it, but let us
consider how the Apostle proves it by two things, first because he only has
immortality, and secondly because he only dwells in that light that no man can
approach unto, and from these two he concludes that he is blessed, and he only
can give it.

He that has life and an eternal life that is so glorious, and a life which
is light, and is such as makes the glory of him that has it incomprehensible,
certainly that must be unspeakable felicity, and this is the first point of
true felicity, and this is the reason why all creatures are said to be subject
to vanity, because they are subject to death, so that all things although they
should have their hearts desire in the world, yet they cannot be happy, for
when they dye their happiness ceasseth, therefore to be truly happy, is first
to be immortal, which is not only to be exempted from death, but to be in
such an estate where death cannot come, and to have corruption swallowed up of
life, when God shall be made glorious in them that believe, this makes men
truly happy, therefore the saints of God have both in the old and New
Testament lamented the misery of man in this, that his life is but threeskore
and ten, and it is quickly gone as a race that is run, so vain a thing is
man; and if we had nothing else to humble us but this, namely, our corruption
and mortality, it were argument enough to know our base estate, and far from
being happy in this world, in that we are not exempted from death, therefore it
is, that God makes the vanity of man who heaps up riches, and cannot tell who
shall enjoy them, as the rich glutton in the Gospel, who said, soul take
thine ease, thou have goods laid up for many years, when Christ told him, he
had not a day to live, then thou fool whose shall those goods be? the
scriptures mock at these vain desires. so that be a man what he ca^ be in this
world, yet his mortallity makes him wretched and unhappy, therefore in regard
God is immortal therefore he is only blessed.

But it may be objected are not the Angels immortal, Objection.
why then do ye say God is only said to have immortality?

I answer, that none have immortality properly but God alone, for true
immortality requires true eternity, Ans.
that is to say, it is without beginning as well as without ending, and none is
so but God alone, therefore none truly is immortal but God alone, though
notwithstanding God has made the Angels immortal, and the souls of men
immortal, that is, for durance only, and yet indurance simply does not make
immortallity, for though the devils endure for ever, yet it is not to live for
ever. A thing may be said to be immortal, that is, to live for ever, and yet
not free from Gods wrath, as experience shall prove in wicked men and evil
Angels and reprobate men, but to speak of the blessed Angels and the souls
of the elect, to speak truly as the matter is, the immortality of Angels and
of men, it is not in the souls themselves, nor in the Angels themselves, what
then? even from God alone, as it is said Acts 17. That in him we live, move,
and have our being, and if God should but withdraw his up-holding hand and
power, neither should the souls of men, nor Angels be immortal; so that it
is not from themselves but from God that they have their immortality, and
therefore the objection takes not away this truth, that God is only immortal.

Again observe this, that although the Lord give immortality to my soul and
unto Angels, yet neither man nor Angel can give immortality to any creature
in the World, God only is able to do this, therefore he only has
immortality, because he only has it of himself, and because he only is
able to give it to others, therefore must he needs continue to be immortal,
that has the only keeping of it himself, and dispences the same to others at
his pleasure, so that in this point God is only happy, for man may begett
children, but we cannot make them immortal, only the Lord must do this, nay
we cannot make ourselvs immortal, do we what we can, read Psalm. 43. and you
may see the spirit of God taxes the miserable vanity of men, that think their
names great on earth, and yet he says, no man can redeem his brother from
death, all must go to the grave, the rich dye as well as the poor, and yet
vain man he will call his Lands by his own name, and all is but in vain, so
that this is proved, that God is only blessed. We know that the devil did
speak true to God concerning Job, when the Lord said unto him, Have thou not
considered my servent Job, who is a righteous man, that does no evil but good,
what says the devil to God, skin for skin and all that a man has will a man
give for his life, Whereas the hand of God being stretched forth against Job in
his children, and in his estate, yet it could not make Job to blaspheme God,
but the devil thought that if God would stretch out his hand upon his own
person, that it would make him to blaspheme God, a man will part with any
thing so as he may have his life, for what is riches unto a man if he cannot
enjoy them, without life there is no conceit of happiness, let men therefore
learn this, that their life, and the continuance of their life, and the
eternity of their life is in the hands of God alone, and since it is so that he
only can give eternal life, why then should I for the pleasure of any man in
the world offend this God, and make him to be mine enemy? can any Prince in
the world give me eternal life, but he only? why then should I for the
pleasure of any man offend him in whom my life stands? unless I care not what
become of me, whether I be cast away into hell, or whether I have eternal
life; If I desire life let me then make conscience not to greive this good God,
since he only can give life, and he only can take it away, this is still but
one part of his felicity, and of our felicity in him, if we obey him, he has
promised to give eternal life unto us; and they that remember not this promise
that God has promised to them that fear him, certainlye that man cannott walk
as a Christian.

To come then to speak of the 2. point, of the felicity of God, which is thus
set down, be dwells in that light, which no man can attain unto, I will
consider two things in these words, first that he dwells in the light,
secondly, he declares what manner of light this is, it is such a light as no
man can approach unto. The first shows the infinite glory of God, in that the
very place of his habitation is light it self, and such a light as the sun
cannot give, it is a light surpassing all created light, yea this light coms
from God himself, 1 John. God is light, if any man say he has fellowship with
God, and walk in darkness, he is a liar, for God is light, and they which have
fellowshich with God walk in the light, and therefore those that are called of
God, they are called the children of light, and God is said to call us out of
darkness into his mavelous light, that is, God calls us from death to life, so
he does call us from darkness to light, and this is the second part of our
felicity, for in this we must be like God, in whom is no darkness, for when God
shall translate our vile bodies unto his glorious light then shall the light of
the sun be inferior to this bright shining light of this mortal flesh, what
glorious creatures shall we be in that day when this our mortal flesh shall
not only be made immortal, but our bodies shall be raised in glory, as the
Apostle says, they are sown in weakness, but they shall be raised in glory,
glorious bodies, even like unto the son of God, who is now at the right hand
of his father, so that whatsoever is in man's body that makes it defective it
shall then be taken away, and the glory of God himself shall be put upon our
bodies in that day, so this is the first thing to be considered of us, that God
dwells in the light.

What use should we make of this, it should teach us where to lay the blame if
we see not God, for in the dark we can see nothing, but in the light we can see
any thing* now if thou can not see God, it is not because God is in darkness,
for God dwells in the light, something therefore must be the reason why thou
can not see him, and the reasons are one of these two.

First if thou see not God at all, the reason is this, because thou art a
child of darkness, and the light of life was never putt into thy soul, therefore
the wicked are said to be of them which know not God, and what wonder is it
they do not know him, since they were never called out of darkness to the light
of God, the want of this calling out of darkness, is the reason why they cannot
see nor know this God, as for example, if a man be in a dark dungeon or prison,
that has no windows in it to show light, he cannot see, such a man in such a
place cannot see the sun, for until he be taken out of that dark place he
cannot see any thing, so until men be taken out of that beastly blindness
wherein he is conceived and born he cannot see God.

But the second thing will bring us to a non plus in this point, for suppose I
be called out of darkness what will that help me? what the better am I for this
calling, if I cannot approach to this light? this is the second thing that we
are to mark in the felicity of God, that besides his dwelling in the light, he
dwells in such a glorious light as is unspeakable, which no man can approach
unto, which shows the unspeakable glory of the Majesty of God.

But then it may be objected, what availes this light of God, since we cannott
approach unto it? To understand this more clearly the words following make
this doubt greater, where he says, no man ever saw this light nor can see it,
Abraham never saw him, nor Moses never saw him, neither can any man see that
unapproachable light that he dwells in, all which does let us see the
incomprehensiblenes of the glory of God, if all the Angels in heaven, and all
the men in earth should putt their wits in one, yet they could never see Gods
face as he is, it is but the back parts of God that ever any man saw, or
attained to, for God faith himself that it is impossible for man to see God and
live, well then how shall we resolve these phrases of scripture where it is
said, Matt. 5.
blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God, and the Apostle says,
1. Cor. 13.
we now see but in part darkly as in a glass, but then we shall see him face
to face. How can this be true, if none can see God?

To resolve this doubtful point the Scriptures lead us to the knowledge of the
diverse kinds of the sight of God; first there is a sight of God which is
perfect, secondly there is a sight of God which is imperfect, the perfect sight
of God no man ca^ see but Christ, neither Angel nor man ever had, or shall
have the full and perfitt sight of the Majesty of God, it cannot be seen, for
it is infinite and incomprehensible, which cannott be comprehended by any
creature, no not by gloryfied men, nor glorified creature, for the brightness of
God is such, that it would strike to death man or Angel if he should behold it,
therefore no man or Angel can see it and live, as God said to Moses my face
can no man see and live, yet if any man could have seen God, Moses could, but
the Lord tells him, my back parts thou majest see, but my face shall no man see,
that is, we may have an obscure sight of God as Moses had, but a perfitt sight
of God can no man have, in heaven the Angels dare not behold Gods glory, and
therefore in the 6. Esaias, the Angels are said to have 6. wings, with two they
cover their faces, and with two they cover their feet, and with two they fly.
They had two to cover their faces, to let us see that they dare not set their
eyes upon the immediate Majesty of God, they could not endure the brightness of
Gods nature if it were exposed to their sight immediately, so this perfect
sight of God is proper to God himself and Christ, and no man else besides
himself.

An imperfect sight of God the saints may have, and that we may know the
bounds and the limitts of it, we must first know the end of it and the fruit of
it, and that will let as see what it is to see God.

The ends of the sight of God are twolfold, or we may observe it in one, and
that is, that we may be like him, all similitudes of God flow from our sight
of God here in this world, and in that which is to come, there is no conformity
to God nor likeness to him, but by the shining of Gods light upon us, therefore
it is that in this world he sends such a light amongst us, as is able to make
us like unto him in grace, though not in glory, the small light we get in the
Gospel, is to show with open face the glory of God, it puts the image of God
in righteousness and holiness upon us, and it is given us to this end to beget us
again, and to translate us from the similitude of sinful flesh to the glorious
image of God: see therefore what conformity in holiness and righteousness God has
appointed us in this life, according to this he gives us a sight of himself in
the Gospel, it is a glass wherein we may see God, and according as he givs us
a sight of himself, so does he conform us to his image, and the measure of our
conformity to God does arise from the measure of our sight of God, if we had a
greater measure of the sight of righteousness possess us, we should have a
greater measure of the sight of God, so that is the reason of this light that
God reveals to us in this world, that we may see the glory of God manifested
in Christ Jesus, that we may attain to this blessedness in this life to be like
unto him.

There is yet more, a second degree of blessedness in the sight of God, which is
not only to have a similitude like unto God in holiness, but in glory and
immortality, we shall not only be made righteous and holy, but immortal and
glorious, this does proceed from the sight of God, when Christ shall come
again in the clouds, then shall mortalitye be swallowed up of immortality, but
this effect of the sight of God cannot come to pass until we attain such a
sight of God as the Scriptures speak, when he says, we are now the sons of
God, but when Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall we also appear
with him in glory.

The sight that we have of God in this life, though it be but a poor sight,
yet is effectual to regeneration, and it is as far as sinful man can see
him here, and yet this sight of God is nothing to that he is in himself, and to
that which we shall see in him at the last day: So likewise that sight we
shall receive at Christ's coming again, it shall not be the sight of Gods
Majesty immediately, but we shall see this God clothed with his manhood, for
the fullnes of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodyly, the Godhead is overshadowed
with the flesh of Christ, and we ca^ never see it but in and through his flesh,
his flesh is the veil, and except through this veil, woe cannot see the
Majesty of God in heaven, now this glorious light of his godhead which we shall
see in heaven through the flesh of Christ is not the essenciall glory of the
deity, but the created glory that is putt upon the manhood of Christ, which
glory of the manhood shall transform our flesh to the similitude of the same
glory, so that the sight we shall have of God in heaven shall be an earthly
object in the glorified body of the sone of God, take away this flesh of the
son God in heaven, and neither man nor Angel can see the Lord, therefore in
the 3. Chapter of this Epistle the Apostle tells us that Christ was manifested
in the flesh, and seen of Angels, the Angels durst not look upon God before,
but had two wings to cover their faces, they durst not see the Majesty of God
until God had put this veil upon it, and then the Angels did see it, which
is one of the greatest points of the mystery of godliness.

Since then there is no happiness, but in conforming ourselvs to God in Holiness,
in immortality and glory, and that by the sight of him, what will that teach
us? it should teach us to labor to see this God, which tho he be invisible in
himself, yet we should labor, to get a sight of him, without which there is no
conformablenes to him, nor blessedness in the world, therefore Christ himself
counts his disciples blessed that they saw the glory of God in him, saying,
blessed are the eyes, that see what you see, many have desired to see it, and
have not seen it, this sight which the saints have of God on earth is of two
sorts, the first is according to that God shows himself in the law, the second
is according as God did manifest under the Gospel, under the law he did show
himself but darkly in shadows, types and figures, but now under the Gospel he
does manifest himself in his sone, which is the engraven form of the Fathers
person. God in the old law did show himself in sacrifices; and oblations and
purifications, in these things God did show himself darkly, and not plainly as
he was, therefore the law is now abrogated that the Gospel is come, and we
are not now to look on God as they did in shadows, but to see him in open
face, it is not now as the glory of God was upon Moses, which the people could
not behold the glory of God which did shine in Moses face, much less could
they then see God himself, but now says the Apostle we show forth the glory
of God with open face in the Gospel, which transformes me by the same image
from glory to glory.

Yet this bright sight of God which we have in the Gospel, is but a dark sight
in comparison of the sight of God, which we shall have in glory like unto
Christ, that is reserved till Christ come again; If Christ at his first coming
into the world had come in glory and not in weakness, then he should have
transformed the world to it, but he came not for that end then, but he came
then only to make us holy, and not to make us glorious, he came in our
nature, and was subject to hunger and thrist and wearynes, rhat he might
conform us to his nature, as far as flesh and blood could be capable, but when
he shall come again in Majestye then shall he appear in glory, and when he
appears, we shall be like to him in Glory, so as I said before in the beginning,
all our felicity coms from our sight of God, and look what felicity God
bestows upon us, he will let us see it by transforming us to his image in
holiness here, and in glory herafter; and all does arise from the sight of God,
and yet this remains a truth as I said, that all the sight we have of God is
not a perfect sight, we shall never see God as he is, but it shall be such a
sight as is sufficient for the ends he gives it for; God is as far above us,
as it is possible an infinite creature can be above a finite creature, and
giving this glory to God only, that he knows himself perfectly, and that he
will bless us with that measure of the sight of him which is sufficient to
make us happy for evermore.

FINIS.
