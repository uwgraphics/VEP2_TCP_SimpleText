The Prologue of Laurence andrew the Translatour^.
AFter diverse and sundry small volumes and tryfeles of mytth and p^^tau^ce /
Some newly composed / some translated and of late finisshed / Now minded to
exercise my pen^e in matter to the redesom what more profitable / I have chosen
among all other the book of distyllacyon of waters / written by the thyrty
year labor of master Iherom Beunswyke / to Translate into English. Not
thinking (though paraduenture some in that part will take it) that my
knowledge in these two tongues is such that I of all other to this Translacion
should be most mete / but only being moved with natural love unto my contre
/ which surely should want if I were able to perform^ it / no profytablebooke
for lack of a Translatoure / that is in an other language written. For me
think where the masters in all Science expert will take no such pains / it
is not dyscome^dable for a man of more base lernyng to put to his helpyng
hand. It is na old saying / though power often does fail / A willing heart
is to be accepted. The which onys well remembered. Spare not favorable reder
to pursue and reuolue to thy synguler health / conforte / and learning / this
book of distyllacyon. Learn the high and marvelous virtue of herbs / know
how inestimable a preseruatyue to the health of man god has provided growyng
every day at our hand / use the effects with reverence / and give thanks to
the maker celestyall. Behold how much it excedeth to use medecyne of efycacye
natural by god ordained then wicked words or charms of efycacye unnatural
by the dyuell enuented. which if thou doste well mark / thou shall have
occasyon to give the more louynges and praise to our fauyour / by redynge this
book and knowlegyng his benyfites innumerable / To whose praise / and health of
all my christian brethren / I have taken upon me this simple translacyon / with
all humble reverence / ever ready to submit me to the correccion of the learned

Here fynyssheth the table of this present book. and here after follows the
first part of the same volume
Here begins the first part of this o^e / where in is comprehendyd the noble
science and the true dystyllacyons of waters / and other diverse things
arty^^cyallys
The first chaptre shewyth what dystyllacyon is. Ca. i.
IN the first it is needful to be expressyd and showed what dystyllyng is for
it belongs to all manner of people to understand and know the cause of that
thing that they begin or enterprise to work upon / to the entente that he
may have a perfyt knowledge of such works as he begins / how he may
brenge it to a good end.

Wherefore it is to be understand that dystyllyng is none other thing / but
only a puryfyeng of the gross from the subtle / and the subtle from the
gross / each seperatly from other / and to the intent that the corruptyble
shall be made incorruptyble / and to make the materyall inmateryall / and the
quycke spyryte to be made morequycker / because it should the sooner perce and
pass through by the virtue of his great goodness and strength that there in is
sonke and hid for the co^ceyuyng of his helthfull operacyon in the body of
man / for Dystyllacyon is an elementall thing / for through the mouynge of the
natural heuyns / eueryone must be naturally governed by the bodies above
likewise the body of man through an expert master in medecyne / and through the
waters that there ben divided from the grossenes of the herbs each in his
substance / and that to be conveyed to the place most needful for health and
comfort / like as here after more dylygently shall be declared.

Wherefore dystyllynge is found and ordeynened Ca. ii.
DYstyllynge is necessaryly found and ordained for many manner of necessytees /
and specially for the love of man him for to keep in health and strength and to
bring the seek and weke body again to health / and to the intent that the
gross and corruptyble body may be again cleansed and puryfyed / for who so
ever takes herbs / rotes / or other substaunces and stamp them / the iuce
there of strayned and mynystred is not sightly which many one therefore does
them abhor / because of the inconuenyent sight

Secondaryly with waters dystyllyd / all manner of confeccyons / syropys /
powders / and electuaryes be myxced to the intent that they should be the more
syghtly and doulcet to be ministered received and used Also this dystyllynge is
only found for the common people that dwell far from medycynes and
physycyons / and for them that been not able to pay for costely medyeynes / the
which has moved me greatly this my little work to opene and disclose for
health of man and prosperity of mine eue^ christ.

Thyrdely The dystyllynge is ordained / bycawse that when any medecyne is
mynystred with her corpus or substance in the manner of electuaryes /
co^feccyons / powders / or syropys / or any medycynes with etynge / or
swalowynge down / or drynkyng / or in what manner so ever it be / is Ieoperdus
in the body / bycawse of her substance / Of the which Auyce^. wryreth in the
begi^nyng of the fourth Canon / where as he through the learning of ypocras says
/ that every medycyne that is used with her substa^cef^ebleth and makes aged
and weke. For the which ypocras / Mesue / Arnoldus de villa noua / and many
other more have found the noble science to separate the gross and erthy
substa^nce from the subtle through this operacyon / that is named the handworke
of dystyllacyon / or bornynge thrughe the Alembyck or helm / and other
instruments as here after follows and to you shall be showed

In how many manners may be dystylled Ca. iii.
IT is needful with short co^clusyo^ to show the most expecte and common or
lyghtyst way of dystyllyng / to the intent that the reder or lerner should under
stand me without any murmuracyon or long rehersyng. Wherefore I have two
manners of ways wherein is co^prehe^dyd in brefe the shortyst way of
dystyllacion The first is how it may be done in five manner of ways without any
cost.

The second way with cost only of fire and that also in five manners

The first without cost / is done through a threcorned fylte / named per filrri
distillacione^ The second manner of the first way is this. A glass filled upon
another glass turned with the bottom upward / and well stopped / set or so
ha^gyd in the son / is named per solis distillacionem

The third of the first way is / A glass fyllyd and well stoppyd wrought in
dowgh and so set in the oven when the bread is baking / and is named per panis
distillacione^

The fourth manner of the first way is / A glass the third part fyllyd /
well stoppyd / and buried in horse downge / and is named / per fim^ equi
distillacionem.

The fyfte manner of the first way is A glass fyllyd well stoppyd buried in an
antehyll / named per formice distillacione^.

The first manner of the second way is of the dystyllynge with fire / as
thus. A glass reasonably fyllyd and set in water / under it a fire made / and
there upon an helm or Ale^bick set / named distillacio per balneu^ marie or
distillacio in duplovase

The second manner of the second way is / ye shall put to the same water that
the glass stands in / horse downge / tha^ shall it be named / distillacio per
ventrem equinum.

The third manner of the second way is / Set your glass in a capell where as
syfted ashes be in / named distillacio per Sineres. The fourth manner of the
second way is / ye shall put sand for ashes in the capell where as the glass
shall stand in / and is called distillacio per arenam

The fyfte manner of the second way is / ye shall set boldly the glass upon the
fire / and nothing betweyn the fire and it but only an iron grate or an iron
treuet / and is named distillacio per ignem.

Thus yr have the manners of the.ii. ways of dystyllacyons with cost and with
out cost. How be it many more manners there be to dystylle / ways out of nombre
whereof the Alkemystes aparte can testy fie / and is to them well beknowen.
pendynge in these fornamed ten manners of the which as now I will cesse for
shortenynge of the time / and bycawse as now it is no necessite here toreherse

What instrumentys be necessary or needful unto this work.
AFter the rehersals of the.ix. manners of the dystyllacyons aforesyad now it is
behouefull to know the instrumentis thereto belongyng / the which as nyghe as
god will give me grace / in short conclusyon I will to you declare them / as
far as it is possible / to the intent that the operacyon of dystyllacion may
be accomplysse / and openly showed in fygures as here after follows. How be it
that the learned and expert masters of the science of Alkemye here of have a
knowledge / yet it is not open to all manner of people wherefore I shall make here
of as thus the first rehersall.

Ye must have three cornerde white fyltes like fyltes of hattes / claye / or
lome / bryke / baken and onbaken. After that iron gratys a square finger thycke
/ made round or square as this figure shows.

After that ye must have cappellys of white claye / such as the gold smythes
crowsybles is made of / some leded and some not leded / commonly half a yerde
wide and deep / or more or less as behoweth acordynge to the proprocyon of the
fornayse. And the cappellys be made af^ this manner in fygures following.

A^er that ye must have coper kettyllis or coper capellys being in quantyte
half a yerde of wydenesse and depthe with a pype of coper being a quarter and
half a yerde of length / and it shall stand within two finger bread of the
border or ege of the kettell as this figure shows / for to dystylle in balneo
marye. or in ventre equyno / as here after I shall to you more expressly
declare.

Than must ye have leden platys thrughe perssyd in the myddys / with four
round rings about it / great and small light and heavy. The myddelbare of.x.
pound weight. The small of. viii pound. The gretest of all.xi. or.xii. pound
/ as this figure following shows. Also ye must have bordys as broad and long
as the cappell or fornays is / in such manner that the glass may stand in the
myddelmost hole / to the en^e^t that the glass do not fall one way or other
through the heaviness of the anhangynge of the ledys in the byndynge thereto when
you shall / dystylle in valnco marye.

After that ye must have helmys made of white claie / such as before is
specyfyed / and they must be leded within and without / or else they must be
copper / tynne / or led of the fascyon here after following.

Under that ye must have pannys acoedyng to the quantyte / made of
crowsibrlerth glased or leded without and within or else made of copper / tyn
/ or led / acordynge to your power. After that ye must have glassys / or
fyoles named Eyrcubyt of such fascyon as this figure shows And they must be
made of venys glass because they should the better withstand the hete of the
fire.

Also ye must have glasses or fyoles that ye may whelme each upon other / of
such fascyon as here is showed / for to dystylle therewith in the son as more
expressly in the.ix. chapter shall apere.

Ye must have also cloked glasses named retorte / and also glasses with two
arms named pellycane / fascyoned as this figure shows

After that ye must have blind helmettes of glass like a gorde turned in to
an other glass without any pype / named alembicu^ cerum. And glasses that be
wide above and beneth and narowe in the myddest named circulatoryu^ as here is
figured / for to putryfye and dygeste theryn as here after more plainly is
expressed.

After that ye must have helmys of glass with long pypes / called alembyck or
alembicum as this pycture shewyth.

Ye must have glass named Fyoles with long neckis and narowe mouthys to
receive the water that comes from the pype of the alembyck of the fassyon of
the same following.

Ye must have also stone cannes / or crukys to keep the waters in after they be
dystyllyd.

The molde or form shall be as large and wide (...) thin as this picture is in
every condycyons like great and small / within the black circle (...) is the
instrument to fassyon the stone in / which stones must dry by their own
acorde / (...) the oven should not ryue / nor cleue / with the hete of the fire
/ and when they be dreythey sha^ ^ynysshe the third part in length / bread /
^ thycknesse. The.vi. stones makes a round lay (...) oven. The.v. stones and
an half makes a round lay to the wind hole of the fornase (...) as ye draw
out the ashes And other.v. stones and an half closes another round lay
(...) the hole where ye put the coals in / and thus make thefo^uase.



How that ye should make the stones / claye / or lutum that belongs to these
works. Ca. v.
BY the grace of almighty god unto you shall be declared the handy* work of
this here after following / the which ye be desirous for to accomplyssh for to
form or make your stone / that ye shall make your forneys of / it is of
necessyte that ye should have an instrumente of iron or Nut tree / or Peer tree
wode of vii. inches thycke. Also ye must have good mean earth another to fat nor
to lean / well purifyed from all oncle^nes / and tempered with water. Also it
must be beten and trodden togeder / till it be remperate and of manner like wax
or doughe. The form must be threst in water or made wet and laid in sand upon
a board / and therein ye shall put of your foresaid claye. If there be to much /
ye shall stryke it of with a wet hand / and than ye shall lift up your
instrument by the ears / and knock upon it on an other board / than the stone
shall fall out. And the instrument is as the precedent pycture shows. And in
this manner ye may make as many and as few stones as ye well / and set them in
the air in a shadowy place / or hye in your house till they be dry. And ye
may take pro^ sinders small bete^ to powder the.viii. part thereof as much as
claye / tha^ the stones beco^me as hard as iron in the fire. Or else bear
your instrument to the tyle maker and cawse him to make as many as ye need.
wha^ ye have your stones it is nedeful to you to tempre your lome or claye for
your fornayse in such manner that he do not ryue nor cleue / not only your
fornayse / but also the instrumentys of copper / iron / glass or erthen / to be
stryken or lute them there with at all times requysyte.

First ye must have a toughe puryfyed clay at the Potters well beknowen / tow
here / flocks / or horse tordes / beten with a little wa^de till every here be
loss from another / than shall they be choppyd small / and tempered / with
the clay / so much that it bear the third part of the ^laye / and it is best
that ye tempere it with salt water / to the intent that the claye does not
ryue with the fyce. Nor no manner capellys / pannys / or glassys / that be lutyd
therewith three or four times over / and so let it dry by him self. If you will
make a lome or clay to enoynte your glasses or fyoles ye must take pure claye
or lome / and put it in a tubbe or payle or other close vessel / and cast wine
upon it and myxce it with horse tordys / and with small shyuys or herdys of
flaxce / like thycke pappe / and there with enoynte and over stryke your
glasses or fyoles / and let them so dry by themself in the shadow. If ye will
that no manner of stones shall ryue / rent not breast asonder through the hete
of the fire / than tempere your lome with sty^^ed water of nettels and enoynte
or wasshe therewith your stones. Also that no manner of lynen clothe burn with
the fire / that your glasses shall be luted with / when the one is whelmed on
the other / take your lynen clouthe and deep it well in salt water and than
let it dry by him self After that wet it in the white of an egg well beten /
and let it dry again by him self. When you will lute any thyn what so ever
it be / enoynt it well with ^e clay tempered as is before specyfyed ^ta a
lutynge for a glass that ryueth ^n the fire / take read led and half ^noche
vnsleked lyme beten to pow^^ and a little duste mele of the myllys ^pere all
this togeder with the whyof an egg / and make a lynen cloute ^tte therein / and
hold it a little by the (...) till it be warm / and so ordered lay it the ryue
of the glass standing upon fire / ye must be ware that no manner old thing
towche yowr glass the / ^yle that yt is hate / for that whill make ^o rent
and break asonder.

Thus shall you make lutum sapientie: arnoldus de villa noua says where ^th ye
shall lute all manner of glasses / the ente^te that the fire shall not peryche
there hurt yt. Take two parts of ^ll puryfyed lome or claye / and one par of
horse torde / clean gadered as before ^ayde. And to the intent that the claye
^ll be the stronger / and not rent nor ^ue. Than put there to the powder of ty^
stones / or else powder of vnsleked ^e / all this same with salt water / well
^^yd togeder with your handys in a ^uer gf thynne dowghe / and so occu^ed.

Thus have I showed you diverse ma^r and ways of lutynge and how to ordered. If
ye desire any more to kno^e thereof / ye may inquyre that of the al mystes.

How ye shall make the common fornays that belongs to this work. Ca. v.
IN diverse manners and forms these fornayses be made / therefore by the help of
almighty god I shall show you the most common and ready ways her to needful
and most necessary / and leave the other vnrehersed / because I will e^c^ewe
the tedyousnes of the reders and the lerners of the science / to the
acco^plyssynge of our fornamed works my purpose is to show you two manner of
ways / and every way in diverse manner of forms as / here after plainly to you
shall be expressyd. The ferst way of these fornayses or styllatoryes that be
commonly used / ben named rose garlandes or helmettys. An other manner there is
to be made fornayses or styllatoryes having many manner of fascyons. The first
is to be showed of the fornayses that been well beknowen among the potters made
of earth leded or glased / of fascyon like the figure here before / and it may
be remeued from the one place to another.

How ye shall dystylle in sand / named dystyllacyo per arenam.
THis chapyter is ordered in every condycyons like as the chapter speaking of
the dystyllynge in the ashes save only the glasses need to be better as venys
glasses is there to best / and also the glasses must be stro^glyer suited / and
for the ashes / ye must take pure syfted sa^de / and as ye tell one two three
be the clock / so softely must your droppys fall and thus ye must order your
self if ye will have the true way of dystyllacyon for it is the highest degree in
heet of all dystyllacyons / wherefore take heed that ye make not to sharp a
fire / for if ye do your warkers will brenne and stynke and your glasses will
be. Also ye shall never dystyll your herbs so dry out of all moisture in
the ashes or the sand as ye may do in valneo marye / or in ventre equyno. For
in balneo marye or in ventre equino they can never be out stylle^ so dry that
they can bren / stynke or (...) harm. But in ashes / and specially (...)
sand / for therein at the end como^ly the brenue / therefore take heed to the
enter^^ that ye may the bettere obtain your purpose.

ANother fornayse ye may make after the fascyon of the great fyg^^^re with two
three or four hellmys / that (...) all hete with one fire / and in every helm a
sundry water dystyllyng / but that fornayse may not be remeuyd / wherefore ye
must take heed in what place ye (...) it in that there come no scathe thereof /
and that shall ye make in this manner / first make the herthe as long and
broad as (...) will which shall be the sote or fondame^^ of the fornayse where
as the ashes shall fall on / and than lay two lays of sto^^ in hight above
it that it may be holowe in the myddest above the holowe place ye shall lay
round or square iron barrys every bar a great enche of thyckenesse and they
must be laid an ynche from each other as before is fygured / and about the
gyrde iron or iron barrys ye shall make up your forneys alwaye^ the longer the
wyder within of a fore^hey / and within it shall be eonynted with the lome or
clay te^pered with salt water thereto prepared as is before said. On the
vppermoost part ye shall lay two strong iron bars.v^i. inches from each
other well enoynted upon the forsayde bars shall be laid a great iron plate
metely thycke with a hole in the myddest / for to cast the coals thorough
under the plate shall be made four wyn (...) holes / for to let the smoke out
/ dan the ^^late shall be enoynted as the bars be (...) specyfyed well thycke
/ and above (...) place the fornays shall be raised all (...) half a stone
thycknesse / and in the myddest of the fornays an hole shall be (...) even just
above the hole of the plate where the coals be cast thrughe. Upon the
^aydeplate shall be left four broad pyt^ys acordynge to the quantyte of your
(...). In the which pyttys ye shall put or strewe fine syfted ashes or sand
of two inches hye / in the which ye shall set your pannys of earth / coper /
or led but the leden pannys may not well abide by the fire without meltynge /
except ye make very small fire under it / upon such pa^nis be set the
styllatories named helmettys / or rosegarlandys here before rehearsed and
fygured. And to every smoke hole ye shall make a plogge or tappe to govern
your fire with / great / or small as it is needful.

Here after follows of another manner or ro^nayse for dystyllacyons as here is
figured

When you will make a styllatory tha^ lay upon the herthe.v. stones in manner of
a ryng / which fassyon of stone stands fygured in the.v. chapter the syxt
stone shall be divided in twain / than the mouth of the forneyse abides open /
than lay upon the next lay.vi. stones / cowched mason wise / than anoynte it
without and within with such claye as before is spoken of / than lay the grate
or iron barrys over it / and lay again.vi. stones upon it / and upon that /
lay again.vi. stones / upon these.vi. lay agyane five and a half / and tha^
abides (...) hole open to put coals in / and se that it be always well luted
or enoynted as is before said, than lay again.vi. stones to close the mouth
above than have ye two holes / one for to draw out the ashes / the other to
put in the coals / than lay again.vi. stones well lutyd always / than lay
upon it a round ring like a tryuer / and that must be very well lutyd with
the claye before said. Upon the tryuet or iron ye shall set an erthen cappell
as before is said / and that well lutyd / than ye shall hyghen your for nayse
so long till he be as hye as the chapel in such manner that ye have four
wynd holys or smoke holys above / made Just to the Capell with.iiii. erthyn
tappes / to govern the fire / ye shall streme syfted ashes / or sand in the
Capell / and therein set your glasses / and the ashes or sand shall be four
inches thycke strewed.

If you desire to make a fornayse or styllatorye named Balneu^ Marie* than take
for the erthyn Cappell a coper Cappell / or kettyll with a copere pype as
before is fygured / and that well lutyd, and set the pype before over the
fornayse lest the water fortune to sethe as if it should run over / than
shall it run thrughe the pype without hurtyng of the fornays*

In such coper kettyll / or cappell shall be none ashes not sand. for it
borneth lyghtely / but ye may put therein horse tordes / for to be stylled in
ventre equino.

Also there be other fornayses made with a long hye pype in the midst with
three or four cappels about / and there is a grate of yro^ vndreneth the long
pype above the hole where as the ashes be drawn / and has holes severally
under every cappel having a sundry fornayse pendynge to the said long pype.
And every cappel has a smoke or wind hole / for to give through it a several
hete to every cappell / and that to draw to his regystre And thus ye may hete
your cappellys / severally or all in general. the long pype standing in the
myddest shall be filled with coals / and it shall be well cloysed above / that
none air come out / than the fire brenneth only upon the iron grate / ye may
make this pype as hye and as low as it shall please you / and keep the fire
with stoppynge of the wind holys above and beneth, as need requires
with.xiii. or xiiii. tappys / and this fornayse is made as here is fygured.

How ye shall ordir or prepare your instrumentys where as your waters shall be
dystylled and also kept. Ca.vi.
AFter the preparacyon of your fornaises / it is needful to you and expedyent
to make and prepare your instrumentys and your vessellys to keep your water in
after that they be dystylled and so may ye well accomplysse this noble practyse
and former enterprise.

First when ye well dystylle in glasses set in ashes or sa^de / it is
necessary for you to ouerlute them more than half the part of the glass with
the fornamed some or claye / but they that be occupied in balneo marye need not
to be luted / and such glasses be named cucurbyte byte and the best glass thereto
belo^gyng be made of hohemy glass or of the great rouude shynes of Venys glass.
And such curbytus ben not only made of glass but also of crusyble earth well
glasyd within / some be made of coper / led / or tynne. The tynnen be occupied
in balneo marye / and copperen ben often times luted and so set in the fire.
The copere^ be sometime occupied in balneo marye olso / Sometime they be set in
ashes or sand / and they must be luted more than the two other parts. When
ye will put any thing in glass or in any other instrume^tis of what nature so
ever the substance be / wet your clouthe in your lutun or claye / and wind
your glasses therein twyes or thryes round about. And when ye will dystylle
oil or any such like / than ye must enoynte it with your forsayde lu^um two
inches thycke / yet it will s^antly hold. For the oil will often times perse
through out / therefore ye must take heed to your lutum or claye / if you will
keep your waters well after the dystillacyons ye must take a stone Truke / But
if ye can not get such as ye desire / Than take an erthen can and set it
in an oven when the bread is drawn / when it is through warm / than put in it
mol: ten wax^e / and stere that round about that the wax may cleue to every
place than torn it with the bottom upward and puore out of the ware / than
enoynte the can without with awollen clothe full of molten talowe / than set
it agaynea little within the oven than the wax and the talowe soketh in to the
can And when it is cold than put thy water therein and stop the mouth
thereof with a woden tappe and with wax / and hang on the cruke in a small
byll the name of your water / and what time it is dystylled.

Now ye shall dystylle through a fylte named per fultrum distillacio. Ca.viii.
FOr to dystyll al manner of sapoure or other watery moisturs thrughe a fylte /
as water / wine / or other lyquor or sape / which ye will puryfy from all
trowblous and vnclere substau^ces / for ye can dystylle no manner of herd
things through a fyllte / as herbs / ^otes / or ^^uytes bycawse of he^
herdens, wherefore ye must have.x. or.xii. fyltes pure and whyt / being
thresquare / a foot of length and viii. inches of bread / and the sapoure or
^yquor shall be done in an erthen pan well leded within / and the pan shall
be set upon a hye steyr or greses / which pan shall be somewhat lenyng wherein
shall lay the brodest end of the fylte / and the smallest end shall hang in
a glass / or in another pan that shall stand upon the next step of the
steyer down wardys / and in the said vndermoste pa^ne shall be a fylte laid as
it was in the first always the pa^ne heluynge downwardys and the fylte with the
smallest end hangyng downwardys in an other pa^ne / and so forth doing with as
many fyltes and as often as ye will. When your fyltes be ouerladen and stopped
with the vnclenesse that therein is sowked by the dystyllacyon / ye shall wash
them in fair waters till they be puryfyed of their uncleanness / than ye shall
dry them again / and lay them in the pa^ne as they were before In this manes
ye may dystylle.x. or.xii. times in a day with on labor / till the substance
be purely claryfyed from all uncleanness / And this is pryncypally good for the
waters that be dystylled with fire for to (...) them hate with of in the sa^ne
/ and this is the first manner to dystylle without fire.

How ye shall dystylle in the son named per solis distilacionem. Ca.ix.
THe second manner to dystyll with out fyes which may be done with out cost
as thus / ye shall take a glass that shall be almooste as wide above as beneth
named an vrynalle / or like this figure about The two parties of this glass
shall be filled with blossom of flowers / as roses / violettes / or other
blossoms / or such like / than shall ye make a small cross of woden styckes
and lay that upon the mouth of the glass tha^ make an other cross of small
styckes somewhat longer than the other that may be bent cross wise ever the
other straight within the glass to make them both sure than turn the mouth
of the glass down wardys upon the mouth of such and the glass / that the mouth
of it may be somewhat within the first glass / than lure them well together that
there come none air out / than hang the^ in the hotest of the son / the
glass with the floutes upward. Thus dystylleth your substance through the hete
of the son out of the uppermost glass in to the vndermoste.

How ye shall dystyl in hot bread with man oven / named per panis
distillationem.
THus shall ye dystylle in an oven. Take a flat flacron or botell of glass /
and put it full of roses or other flowers or pyssemer eggys / or any other
blossom / than stop the glass fast with a woden stoppell / and cover the glass
over all / as if it were a lofe and put it in the oven / when ye put other
bread therein and draw it out again with that same bread when it is baken /
and let it cole by him self / and when the bread is cold tha^ break it
softely of / saving the glass from brekynge than pull out the stoppell / and
put it in another such glass / and order it as the other glass was / so often
till it be enough. Ysit be not pute than and clean enough ye may dystylle it
perfiltrum if ye will. And these two manners be very good to dystylle of flowers
the waters serving for the ^yen.

How ye shall dystylle in horse downge named perfimum equorum dystyllatio.
Capitulum xi.
TAke a glass like a gorde named in latin cucume^ / on it a blind helm. Or
else take a glass that is small in the myddel / and great beenethe and also
above / named in latin circulatorium like as these glasses here be fygured

Fyl the third part of this glass with what manner of flowers that ye will and
stop that glass well with a wode^ stoppell and over lute it well / than put the
glass in warm horse downge / which horse dou^ge must lay in a woden vessel
chyst wise well stopped and covered / and therein it must lay a monethe or
longer and also this horse downge must be renewed every forthenyght / after
that draw out the cappe softely / than puryfye the cleryst of in another glass
named a pellyca^ which before is fygured or in another / whereof there be tweyne
as here is figured the one in the other.

This glass or the pellycanste shall be well lutyd and also set in the horse
downge as before is said / Than this lycou^e or water will run up and down
from the one glass in the other. Tha^ becomes it say / and of great
operacyon. Thus be^ also other costely waters rectyfyed / as autum potabile /
aqua vite / and othere waters / for with the great ronnynge up and down in the
pellicane it is rectyfyed and amendyd / Thus ye have the fourth manner of
dystyllacyon with out fire.

How ye shall dystylle in a pyssme^ hyl named performyce distillacionem. Ca.xii.
THe fyft manner is thus. Fill a glass full of flowers / of what manner of flowers
ye will / and stoppyd in the manner before said / than burye it in a pyssemer
hill / that some call an antehyl where as many of them be fourtee^ days and
more as ye think that need requires Than take out the glass again. and pour
out the clerest above there of into another glass and hang it in the son /
or put it in a pellicane in horse downge to rectyfyed it as before is said /
tha^ it shall be pure and sayre In this manner is wine put in to a glass / and set
in a pysemer hill as before is said a month co^tynuynge than it shall be pure
and fair / as if it were dystilled by Alembyke / and has a godly taste and is
well smelling. In this manner is dystyled the dew of may Thus have ye the
fyfte manner of distillacyon without fire.

How ye shall dystyll in bolneo^ marie ^amed per balneum marie / o^ in (...)
Ca.xiii.
THe syxte manner of dystyllacyon is ordered in this manner. The glass shall be
set in warm water / which water shall be in a Copper kettell or copper
cappell with a pype of copper / as I have shewe^ you before that the fornaise
be not wet if it fortuned to sethe and run over. And the dystyllacyon is
ordered thus. Take a glass named curcubyte / till the two parts of the same
glass with iuce herbs / flours / leaves / fruytes or what so ever it be chopped
small / and set the glass upon a ring of led like as before is fygured in
the fourth chapter / made a bond of clothe three fyngers broad about the
upper part of the glass / About the same band make four small rings of
clothe having four bandys coming down to the four rings that be fast on
the leden ring and bynd the^ fast each to the other as here is fygured.

Than set the glass with the led in the water and standed vpryght / and is sure
from falling on the one side or the other through the weght of the led / than
set the Alembyek or glass and lute it well as before is specyfyed / in the
tyffe chapter / Than make fire in your fornays to hete your water with / and
let it be no hoter than ye may suffer your finger in it / and have all time
warm water to fill your kettyl again / when the water by length of time is
wasted through the h^^e of the fyde / for if a drop of cold water touch the
glass it will ryue and break a sonderye shall understand that when it droppeth
no more it is clean dystyllyd / Than ye must let the glass stand still in it
for to cole / for yt ye drew the glass hot out of it / it would break
asonder. It is needful for you also to have a round board with a round hole
in the myddeste and clefte asonder / for to lay always about the glass to the
intent that it may be the longer warm. Ye shall also understand that all
manner of watres that be dystylled in this manner keep the sovereign sent and
odor of the herbs that those waters be dystylled of wherefore they be gretely
praised and that much bett tha^ the waters of the herbs and flowers that be
put i^ a glass / as it is showed i^ the.xi. chapter of that / that is buried in
horse dounge. v or.vi. wekes to be putryfyed / and than the one with the other
dystyllyd i^ balneo marie as I showed you before

How you shall dystylle in the horse belly named dystyllatio per venteem equi i^
latin. Ca.xiiii.
THe.vii. manner is thus to dystyl in the horse belly / ye shall set the glass
filled in the for named manner in Balneo Marie / as before is said but in the
wate^ ye shall put horse tordes / taking good bid that there be no straw nor
hay therein / and that the water be so thycke of the horse tordes as if it were
wortys. Ye must also take heed that ye put often times warm water in it / for
it is sone consumed and wastyd away / and this is half a degree hoter than in
balneo marie / therefore ye may dystylle hardes substaunces in it than in balneo
marie

How ye shall dystylle in ashes / named Dystyllacyo per Sineris Ca.xv
Vhe.viii. manner is ye shall strewe fine syfted ashes in a cappel. iiii ynchs
of thyckenes / than fill a glass the third part full with such substance as
ye will / and set it in the ashes / than fill the cappelle full of ashes till
the third part of the glass be covered / and the cappelle where as the ashes
be in shall be ofer the / for if it were of copper / thrughe the force and hete
of the fire it would melte. After that set the alembycke upon the glass and lute
it well upon it with lutum sapiencie as I have showed you before in the v.
chapitre Than make fire under it that it may drop treatably as if you would
tell the clock.i. ii. that tha^ there fall a drop / and so continue after the
same soft manner / for if it fall faster or quycker the fire is to great
therefore stop the wind holys above and benethe / tha^ it shall fall the
softer and brenne the less / and so it shall smell the less of the fire /
When it droppeth no more than let the glass stand a hole night a colynge or
ever ye move or styre it / or else it would break a sonder The glasses be also
lutyd to the third per as it is showed to you before in the.v. chap. by cause
they should break the less.

How ye shall dystyll in the sand / named distillacio per arenam ca.xvi.
THis part is ordered in every condycyon as the chapter is ordered of the
ashes. and as before is showed in the v. chapter. etc.

How ye shall freely by^^ylle on the fyet with a wind ouyn / named distilacio
per ignem Cap.xvii.
THe tenthe manner is this to dystyl so that there be nothing between the glas^
and the fyers^lyke as aqua fortis and other strong waters be dystylled. To
this dystyllacyon is necessary for you to have a treuet i^ the myddest of the
formys with the.iii. fete masoned in the wall of it / And the glass must be
made of venys shyue glass. That glass shall be on the out side well lutyd a great
ynche of thycknesse. and after that ye shall fill the third part of your
glass / which shall be also well enoynted with such claye as before has been
spoken of / Than shall ye enoynte your fornays in the same manner / And after
that ye shall set the alembyk on your glass and se that it be well luted / than
ye shall set a receptacle or viole so that the pype of the alembycke hang
within it / and than it must be well lutyd therein

At the first to begin with / the space of.iii. hours ye must make hot
fy^^^ and after that the longer the greter / and at the beginning ye shall
stop your wind holy / which shall be four in no^bre above the grate or
treuet against the coals / where with ye may mynysshe or encresse your fire as
ye list to give it air / for it is no chyldes play nor game to dystyll
strong waters / or aqua foctis / wherefore ye ought the best to take heed / but
the most part of all the glasses break aso^der where as aqua fortis is
dystylled in / for in the end the helm becomes as red of the great hete as
any rubey or ever the spyrite from him departs. And let your glass stand
colynge by him self, or it be taken out

How ye shall dystylle in common styllatoryes / named Rosgarla^dys or helmets as
here is fygured. Ca.xviii.
When ye will dystylle much waters in a common styllatorye / ye shall lay sand
under the pan of yt.iiii. inches of thycknes. There upon ye shall set your
pan of earth over ledyd or glasyd as the Potter makes / Or else of copper /
Round about the pan ye shall lay sand and bestrike that above with claye /
to the intent that it be not lyghtely with handys remeued or leftyd up.

Than lay therein such things as ye will dystylle / and set the helm upon it.
Than make a long small lynen cloth wette in thynne claye tempeted as before is
said / with the same clothe ye shall stop your styllatorye between the
helmete and the pan / than set a glass before it that the pype thereof may
hang in the glass / and lute it well that none air come out of the glass /
thus dystyll and mark through the glass how the dropes fall therein / acordinge
to the same temper your fire / great or small as it behooves and when ye se
that it droped no more / than it is time to break it up again / and put other
herbs therein. When ye will have much water out of little herbys. Than lay
the herbys three inches thycke upon each other in the pan / flowers shall be
laid.vi. inches thycke / and fruytes.ii. inches thycke / for if it lay
thycker upon each other / than is the moystoure of the vndermoste herbs
dyssolued or ever it can be sublymed thrughe the vppermoste / wherefore / wha^ I
will dystylle costely herbs which ben not easy to get / as maioran / rosemare
flowers / or other such like. Than I think not my labor lost nor tedyous
to lay but a little in at ones / for the labor and cost is dowble
recompensyd ye shall understand that all manner of waters which be dystylled
in glasses be the best Next unto them those which be dystylled in erthen
vessels and be well ledyd with erthen pannis under and helmets above as the
potters full well can make. After tyne^ helmets above and leden pannes under /
After that leden helmets and pannys / as I have seen occupye in howsys of
relygyon at Straesborowe in hye Almayn / whereas they made their fire with wode
/ but it was very small for scare of meltynge of their leden pan which stood
upon syfted ashes an hand full hye and not in sand / After that copper
helmets ouertinne within / After that braso^ne helmets but always the copperen
helmets be to fear / and specially the brason helmets / for two manner of
causes / the first is the water that in them is dystylled comunly borneth and
smells of the fire / and has a reed color like wine that is deed in him
self. The second cawse is. for the copper and brass has always a manner of a
gout and palsy pendynge unto him more than any other metal which gives
occasyon that every one should thereof beware / as Christophorus de honestis
testyfyeth super Antydotacio mesue,

How you shall dystylle in general each according to his nature. Ca.xix.
TO all manner of people that will occupye and use the act or science of
dystyllacyon it is right needful for them to know when they will dystylle
ought what manner of way is most convenient therefore / to the intent that it
lose not his strength and goodness of co^ple^yo^ and proptye but that it be the
bet^ drawn and brought i^ to the water as far as it is possible and
co^uenye^t for it is not possible that ^ ^nybody l^^ynge sholbe bring all
thi^^es to purpose after his mind and will: ^ent only God that has created
heuyn and earth / and all things that is there in There fore it is to be
regardyd that all ^aner of flowrys and blossoms whereof is but little to get
/ and is very scarce / is most conuenyent to be dystylled in Alembyk or
Alembicum of glass in bal^e^ Marie / and in none other vessel.

Also your flowers or blossoms that ye will dystylle / must be plucked when
they be fully ripe / but yet or they fall / or fade her color / or than they
marde and de^resse / and they shall be laid soft and light in the glass / as I
rehearse to you be fore in the.xiii. chapter in Balneo Marie / or in the.xiiii.
chapter in Ve^tre equino / And when that water is clean dystylled / it is
rectyfyed after ward in the son / as to you more plainly shall be showed here
after in the.xxi. chapter. But when ye will have the water more stronger and
better / tha^ ye must take the flowers that the water is dystylled of / and put
them in a glass named Circulatoriu^^ as before is showed in the.xi. chapter*
And cast upon them the same water dystylled of the same and self flowers /
than stop the glass again surely / and set it in pure horse donge a.xiiii.
days and nyghtes or more. or in Balneo Marie.ii. or.iii. days and nyghtes.
and let it so dylgest in him self / Than put it again in the first glass /
and dystylle it ones again in Balneo Marie / and the oftener that ye so do the
purer and more nobler and excelenter it will be in strength and virtue.

If you will dystylle herbs they shall be gadered in season convenient or ever
the seues fade or change their natural color. Also they shall not be gadered
when they be wet with rain / but wha^ they be dry in sayre weder and clear /
as ^po^tas and Auycenna testyfyeth*

In the third part of this book I will show to you the time and season when all
the herbs should be dystylled that in this book shall be specyfyed. Ye shall
sttope the herbs an leaves from their stelys and stalkys / and choppe them
small / and than ye shall chop the stelts and sta^kes by them self also / and
than ye shall put them again together with their herbys or leuys / and ye shall
put it tha^ in a glass or helmet / and so dystyll it in ve^tre equ^no / or i^
sinere / wha^ it is so distilled thrughe helmet or glass / than it shall be
rectyfyed as I shall show you here after in the.xxi. chapter. Ye shall
understand that to dystyll herbs or flowers willing thereof to have the sent
and odoure of the herbs or flowers that it is dystylled of / the distillacio^
thereof shall be ordered in two or three manners of ways. The fy^s^ is ordered and
dystylled in ventre equino / or in balneo marie / so that the water be no hot
but that you may suffer your finger therein. Another manner / pour the water
already dystylled upon the said herbs again / or else putryfye it or it be
dystylled as before is showed you of the flowers in this present chapter / The
herbs and the (...) may commonly suffer stronger fire than the flowers
wherefore they may be dystylled in ve^tre equino / which is half a degree hoter
tha^ in balneo marie / and ashes more hotes and the sand ^^est. When ye will
distill any rotes they must be gadred in the hou^des days / or in diebus
canicularibus / that is in the canykeler days when the leaves begin to fall.
The rotes must be washed clean / and the water dried of again / and so
chopped small and broken than put in a pan / or in a glass / and so dystylle
it through an helm or glass / as before is rehearsed. The fourth manner when ye
will dystylle any superfluytees of fowls or bestes / as eggs / blood / liver
/ longues / cowtorde / or any such that is thycke of substance / ye shall
choppe them small and dystylle them in ventre equino and not well stopped for
else the water becomes stinkyng / but if it do become stynkyng / ye shall it
dystylle again in balneo marie / for cowtorde water of the first dystyllacyon
is seldom without stynche / but melke or honey / may be stopped and at the
first time well dystylled. The.v. who so desires to distill water of flesh / he
shall kill it be it best or foul / or else worowe it that no blood issue
from him / after that and if it have any fat or grese take it away than
take the flesh and chopped it small and dystylle it in ventre equino with
soft fire / to the intent that the water do not stynke or smelle of the fire
/ for suddenly thereof comes a great stenche / wherefore all such waters may
be.ii. dystylled for therewith it is greatly ame^dyd. Also wha^ ye will dystylle
any fruytes as plommes / peers / apples / slone / medlers / nuttys and such
like. They shall be gadered when they be fully ripe / or ever they fall and
wax soft / and they shall be chopped small and stamped than shall it be
stylled in an helmer in the sand with so soft fire that it do not borne / and
than it shall be ^^^^tyfyed as I shall show to you in the next chapter
following. Item ye shall understand that all manner of herbs / flou^res /
fruytes / or rotes / that ye will dystyl^ most conuenyently ought to be
gadered in the cressynge of the moon / when it is fair weder / acordynge as
the time requires / than they shall be sayre washed and well pycked form all
vnclenesse / and than shall they laid a dryenge a ^^le day / and than it shall
be chopped and dystylled as before is specyfyed.

How ye shall dystylle and make waters of dry herbs / flowers / and rotes /
when the grene can not be gotten. Ca.xx.
IT fortuneth sometime that ye have no dystylled water / nor none can get in
no place when ye behoue it thrughe forgetfulness of the time that is past when
they should be dystylled / or else thrughe great hete and drowghte by the
which the herbs and flowers be been and wytherd or through great rain or
superfluyte of wettnes / through the which the herbs and flowers be marde and
rotten / and also thr water there of dystylled shall have little strength or
none.

Therefore it is necessary to you for to know how ye shall dystylle waters of
dry herbys / flowers / or rotes / such as ye shall behoue / how be it / it were
more profitable and better of the grene herbys if it were possible to get
them. But if it fortuned that ye should dystylle the dry herbs etc. Ye shall
every year in the moneth^ of may before the son rysynge when it is fair
weder / and has not ray^ed by night / ye shall take a fair white lynen clothe
sprede a broad / and trayled or drawn over the gras in a fair lose or gardyn
where as many fair herbs and flowers stand growing / The same lose or gardyn
where as ye do this in / ought not to stand on a morysshe or watery ground /
nor in deep valleys / but upon hye grou^des as nigh as it is possible / and
than shall this clothe be wrounge out in a glass / and than do so again as often
till ye have ynought This dew must be thryse dystyllyd in balneo Marye / and
rectyfyed as it here after shall be declared in the next chaptre following.
and so keep that water from year to year / than if ye list to dystylle within
the year any dry herbs / than take such herbs as is dried in the shadow as
much as ye will having his natural sent and odo^^/and cast upon it three
times of the fornamede water of dew so much that at every time the herbs be
covered Tha^ put it in a glass and s^oppe it well / and so put it in horse
douge.ii. or.iii. days and nights After that dystylle it i^ balneo marye three
times steped / and at every time again dystylled / but Albucasis wrytyth i^
libro Seruitor that upon every pound of dry flowers or herbs shall be
powered.x. pound of common water and so dystyllyd in an helmet / the which is
not so good as the water before said / For I have read of an old erperte
philosopher a doctor i^ medecyn / that would that the may dew should be.ix.
times distilled i^ balneo marie and that the herbs be gaderd i^ the somer i^ a
dew season / and they shall be clean pycked and the leaves stryped from the
stalkys or stelys / and laid in a shadowy place on dryeng so that they may
keep their sauoure. Take as much of these herbs as ye w^l and cast thereon
three times as much as the for named may dew / ix. times dystyllyd dystyll
that three times over / as before is specified / and that water is better than
the water dystylled of grene herbs / because that only the flegma of the
grene herbs is dystylled. And said that the may dew that has been.ix. times
dystylled draws the might and strength to him wards likewise as aqua vite /
or other dystylled wine does. Therefore it were good that every water should be
cast upon his own feces / that is upon his own herbs where as it had been
stylled of / and is putryfyed and again dystylled / but yet it ware much
better / that ye should power that water of such like herbs before dried and
that so distyled and than as I have written before it to be putryfyed in a
circulatorium / or in a blind helmet / named in latin ale^bicus cecus / which
is before fygured in the.ix. chapter / and so dystylled / it gets great
goodness and stregnth.

How ye shall rectyfye your waters after they have been dystyllyd. Ca.xxi.
NOw after the dystyllynge of the waters it is needful that they be rectyfyed
/ to the intent that the fire be drawn out of them / and the flegmatyke
nature and complexion be temperated / And also that they may the longer
continue without marrynge / which is often done thrughe the he^e of the son
/ when the waters be put in to a glass the two parts thereof fyllyd and well
stoppyd with ledder and that well surely bound / The third part of the
glass shall be set in fine sand and so in the son thr space of six wekes
in the canicula^e days / or after as the weder is temperate / for the same
becomes very hot for to rectyfye the waters from the superfluytees of their
moystures / likewise the waters of fyry nature that be dystylled of spyces and
first steped in aquavite a certain while / their superfluytes of colera is
nedfull to be tempered of the fire comple^cyo^. For through the great hete and
drowght / the complexyon of man is often marred and destroyed / be pendynge
thereto of some manner of gowres. such like waters be rectyfyed thus. The glass
shall be fast stopped as before is said and the two parts thereof shall be set
in wet or moist sand in a cellarx the space of a month or more / or less as
the water requires. Or else dygge a hole in the ground of a moist cellar /
and set it more than the two parts therein / and so let it stand as before
said / for there with the fyry complexio^ is expressly mynysshed. Also it
fortuneth often times when two manner of waters be myxed to gyder / that they
become troblous incontinent and white like milk / as when ye put old waters
in to new / therefore ye shall myxe in two or three pound of waters. vi.
or.viii. drops of good white wine vynegre / Than the trouble some of the
waters draws to the botton and becomes fair and clear.

How and where the dystylled waters owght to be kept. Ca. xxii
IT is necessary and profitable to know how and inwhat manner the dystylled
waters shall be kept to the intent that they may the longer abide in their
goodness / and be preserved from their hynderaunces. First when the dystylled
waters be better dystylled as before is spececifyed / tha^ it is nedfull for
you to have stonen pottes with small neckys or pure fyoles with small mouths
well washed / specially with the powder of the herb named parytaria well
my^^ed with the wat of it or ashes of the same herb and so cle^sed as if they
were new / those vessels always well stopped with a woden stopell or else
stoppels made of the two parts of waxce / one part of rosell / torpentyn /
and fine powder of tyle stones of each one part and a half / all those myxed
to gyder and molten on the fire but they may not sethe / and when it is cold
make thereof their stoppelys / and above that ye shall bind ledder very just
and close / to the intent that the water keep his nature and strength / tha^ ye
shall write about the vessel the name of your water / and the time of his
destyllacyon* Than shall your vessel be it pot or glass be set in a celler
/ to the inteut that it do not frese / for when any dystylled waters been
frosen they lose their might / strength / and changes nature / so that ye
must pour them out or cast them away Also when any water is set in a hot
stewe in the witer it becomes read / and his power and strength is mynysshed
/ therwr it shall be set in a conuenye^t place that is another to hot / to
cold / nor to moist / to the intent that it abide the longer in virtue and
strength withouten hynderaunce or perysshynge.

Here after follows how long ye may keep your dystylled waters and when they
must be poured or cast away. Capitulum..xxiii.
When the waters be dystylled / rectyfyed / stopped and kept in a co^uenyent
place / yet it is good and conuenyent to know and understand how long those
waters may continue in goodness / and when ye shall cast them away / how be it
that the book of Nicolao de Atomatibus shows that commonly every water ought
to be renewed ones i^ a year where with he meneth that they ca^ abide but one
year in their goodness / which can not be true / for it may not be nor is not
of necessyte for these causes following. First that the herbs / flowers /
rotes / or fruits ben not yearly to be dystylled / as I have showed to you in
the.ix. chapter before / and in the begynnyuge of the.xxi. chapter. The
secunde when they be well rectyfyed in the son. The third when they be well
stop^bed and kept in a conuenye^t place. The fourth when they ben every year
ones set in the son the space of forty days or more. The fyfte if need
require every year ones ye shall streyne your water thrught a woollen sack that
so the feces be divided from the pure water.

The syxte that the water be renewed toward the end of the year / as I shall
show you more expressly. The seventh the waters that be distylled continue
longer than the waters that be bre^ned / for the clear and subtle parts be
divided from the gross superfluytes. for the dysserence between dystylled
waters and bte^ned waters is this the one is ordered with fire / and the other
mother manners The.viii. all manner of waters that be dystylled of dry and hot
herbs continue longer than the waters that be dystylled of cold / moist / or
flymy herbs or rotes. The.ix. some waters Being a year old or above / do
alter or change their co^plexyon with mynysshyng of their venymous cold or
hete. Therefore in breue se^ence. I shall show toyow how long the dystylled
waters may be kept as nere as god thereto will give me grace / for it is right
dyffycyll for any erthli creature to have thereof understanding / wherefore I
call to god for help / for the parfyt knowelege thereof is only in him / and
in none other without him / wherefore it is very necessary to you for to write
the time of their breuynges or dystyllacyons.

How long the waters may be kept in substance.
First every manner of water is to be kept a year / when it is b^ennyd /
dystylled / and kept as before is showed. But when the waters ben not close
and truly stopped / than shall they be cast out be fore the year / likewise
all manner of water dystylled of be^^es / of fowls or other worms that bears
life may scantely continue a year. Seco^darely all manner of water dystilled of
flowers / as malow flowers / borage flowers / blew flower deluce / been flowers
/ blewe viollettes may flowers named ^^lium conuallium i^ latin / white lille
flowers water wha^ they be dylygently kept as be fore is specyfyed they
continue from the one year to the other / If that they in the second year be
rectyfyed in the son or dystylled per fylttum or poured thrughe the woollen
sack as I have showed you before / they abide good unto the end of the second
year / but than they shall be cast out Read rose water dureth unto the end of
the third year if it be well kepke / and every year rectyfyed / but in the
third year it is more comfortatyfe than colynge or styptyke / white rose water
may endure two year if it be well kept and rectyfyed / wild rose water
enoureth two year in great operacyon and virtue for to cole if it be well kept
but in the third year this colynge / is sore mynysshed / and is good for
comfortatyues wherefore it is not to be kept over the third year and it must ke
every year rectyfyed / as before is specyfyed. Also the water of Nenufar a
flower which is growyng in the ryuers having a great round grene lefe / which
flowers be sometime yelowe / sometime white / and when the flowers fall the sede
of them is closed in a round botton like a small gorde / or an vrynall / may
endere in his cold operacyon to the fourth year / the first year to be laid
without upon the dysseases / for it is half poison or venym thrughe his graet
coldness or stupefactyfe / the second year it may be used withn the body for to
cole In the third year his colynge is temperate / and in the end of the
third year it shall be cast out / but it must be well kept and rectyfyed as
before is specyfyed. Of the same nature be read roses growyng in the corn /
and so is popy flower water.

Seco^daryly al flowers water of hot herbs / as camomell flowers / centory
flowers / Archangell flowers / dyll flowers / yelow violettis / wild ta^sey
flowers / laue^der flowers rosemary flowers mayocayn flowers / sage floweres
sayn^ Iohn^s worte flowers / all these waters may be kept unto the end of the
thyrd^ year / if they be duly te^dyd and rectyfyed as before is specified / but
the waters that (...) not so hot in their operacyon / they may be kept unto
the end of the second yer^ as: wild peruynke flowers / quices flowers /
flores tilii / peche flowers / slone flowers / whyt lylle flowers / all these
water^ shall be cast out in the eude of the second^ year.

Of the water of leaves
The third / all such waters that be dystylled of leaves of trees / as of
byrche ^^uas / wyld peruynke leaves / beche^ leaves / O^^ leaves / yuy leaves
asshen leaves / leaves of a^nus / vine leaves / leaves of fusamus / leaves of
thamariscus / sauen leaves / and every water of leaves may be kept unto the
beginning of the third year / if they be truly dystylled rectyfyed / and well
stopped and set in a place conuenyent.

Water of fruytes or beryes.
The fourth al manner of waters distylled / as of holme beryes in latin viscus
wild bra^ble beryes / grene benes / benis shales / great pla^tayn sede /
strawberyes plo^mes or damsens / gordes / black and read cheryes / duckes
meat named ^enticula aque vel le^tigo in latin / grene wall nut^e shelles /
ca^pernoyles that somemen callth tode stoles / wild or tame apples wild
peers. And commonly all manner of waters dystylled of fruytes may be kept a
year or more if they be well ordered as before is said.

Water of common hete
The.v. of the herbs that be not to hot not to moysty / nor very hot nor
very deye / as Sorell water. Endyue water / (...) stele water / Borage water /
Cresse water / water of Prunella / water of barba hircyna / water of Arthemesia
/ water of cu^^ or rubea / water of Centum morbia / water of Sratu^ celle or
penny wort / water of treyfels / water of apium dome sti^um / water of
cokowpyntell or aaron water of yacea or herba rauellata / water of our lady
thystel / water of synkfoyl fenel water / water of herb robert or herba
toberti in latin / yarowe water / water of grownde yuy / water of fumytorye
water of Consolida media / liver worte water / Cheruell / water of cards /
louage water leuisticum in latin / water of rauda equina / water of lattis /
liver worte water / water of may de we / night shade water / persely water /
parseneps water / water of Dandelyo^ / Dandelyo^ stalk water / tansey water /
water of herba Pa^alisis / water of Saxifrage / water of Scabyous / Celandyn
water water of Ce^tum nodia / water of Mary goldes. These waters endure in
virtue and strength from the be^ynnynge of the first year to the end of the
second year / when they be kept as before is specyfyed.

Of colynge waters.
THe.vi. of waters of herbs / being very cold / as Mandrake hen quale /
procelayne / housleke / duckes meat copy herb / Crassula minor / hemloke
vellicuta in latin. These waters and such like may be kept from the first
year to the end of the third year / if they be ordered in all things as
before is specifyed but for the outward parts they ben in their cold
operacyon of great virtue and strength / for in the first year they be so cold
and stupefactyfe / that they take away the feeling of man / In the second year
they be metely temperate (...) their colynge therefore they shall not in the
first and second year be used with in the body and some shall never be used in
the body alone / but only to be laid without.

Of the hot and dry herbs of nature
THe seventh / the waters of herbs that be hot and dry of nature / as (...)
hounde or marubium in latin / Scabworte or enula campana in latin Horse mynte
or mentastrum in latin Agrunonie pulegium / bastlicon / cardo benedicta /
Centorye / camomel / archa^gell / Dylle b^ennyng nettles / herba veronica /
gamandre / Tanacetum agreste hoppes / hertes tongue / mirica / ve^bena / Isope
/ lauendre / mayolayne / menta / apium / melyssa / saluia or sage / Aristologia
longa or smerwort / wild time or our lady bedstraw / wyldtreyfle / ruta or
the saint Iohn^s wort / rosmary / saponarya daysy or consolida minor in latin /
pypola / water of those herbs and such like may be kept to the end of the
third year. When they be ordered and kept as before plainly is showed

Of waters of moysty nature.
The.viii. waters of rotes which be gross / moysty and slimy of nature / as
borage rotes / perseneps rotes / rotes of cardo benedictus / fenell rotes /
persely rotes / rotes of hermodactilus / Radyce / rapes / walworte rotes /
rotes of white lylles / totes of sigsllum salamonis, the waters these rotes and
such like may be kept from the one year unto the other / when it is ordered as
before is specyfyed.

Of rotes waters that be hot of nature
The waters dystylled of rotes of hot and dry nature / be / as rotes of enula
ca^pana / totes of angelica / rotes of pynpinell / rotes of blewe flower deluse
/ rotes of valeriaen / rotes of nettles / rotes of yelow lylles / rotes of
spargus / rotes of asaca alba / or assa dulets / or such like / they may be
kept from the beginning of the first year unto the end of the second year
/ if they be duly tendyd as before is rehersyd.

Of all such waters that be dystylled / of bestes / fowls / vermyn or wormys.
The.x. such waters as water of pyes Ducks / greps blood / got bockis blood.
blood of an ass / yolks of eggs / white of eggs / antes or pysiner eggs /
frogs / hens / hennys mawes / capons / row creme cow dounge / calfes
blood / flies / mannis dounge / ox blood / swynes blood / storkys snayls /
These waters and such like may be kept / from the one year to the other year
/ if it be ordered and kept as before is said / but that may not be failed.
honey water may be kept.v. or syx years if it be every year ones rectyfyed in
the son.

NOw will I write to you with brefe sentence of all manner of waters in general /
as of herbs / rotes / flowers / sruytes / and leaves / and other things before
rehearsed. How long these waters may be well kept to the intent that all
those that reded this book may have the better understanding of such thing
as before is not rehearsed. Therefore ye shall understand that all manner of
herbs that be cold or moist / or slymy / or fat thycke substance may dure
from the one year to the other / except these that be cold in the.iiii degree
they may be kept longer as I shall show more plainly to you in the end of this
chapter / like wise all flowers that be fat / moist / and thycke of
substauncs be kept in the same manner. Also all blossoms that be thynne /
substyll / dry / or hot of substance may be kept from the beginning of the
one year to the end of the other year. But all waters of herbs that be hot
of complexyon. the^ inclynnyg to bytternes with dry thynne subtyl steles and
leaves and dry flowers / these may be kept from the first year / in to a
part of the third year. Al fat / slymy / moist cotes that be of a gross
cold substance may be kept from the beginning of the year almost to the end
of that same year. All manner of waters of cotes that be hot / and dry /
subtyl / and thynne of substance / may be kept from the first year in to the
beginning of the third year. All waters of bestes and such like / as before is
spoken of / cold and moist of nature / or gross and fat of substance / may
be kept well nyghe from the begynnyge of the year unto the end / but waters of
blood may continue a year full. All waters of scuytes cold / moist / and
slymy / of substance myxed with sorenes or sweetness / may be kept from
the one year in to the other. But all waters of hot fruytes of small thynne
substance / inclynyng them unto a dry and bitter complexyon / may be kept
from the beginning of the one year unto the end of the other. But all manner
of herbs / flowers / rotes / sedys / (...) that be deyed of wette in wine and
therewith dystylled / rectyfyed / close stoppyd / and kept in a conuenyent place
may continue.ir. or three times as long or longer. when ye kept your waters so
long that ye think that their strength will perysshe than ye may renew them
in this manner. In the next year or they perysshe take of every ^e water of
what nature so ever it be / the third perte of as much herbs / rotes /
flowers or fruytes / that be fresshe and grene / stamped steped and welked in
balneo marie.iii. or.iiii. times well stopped in a blind helmet that has no
pype or ell^s in a glass named circulatorin as here is fygured / or in horse
dou^ge.iii. or four days.

After that dystylled and well rectified in the son as I have showed to you
before than may it continue his hole time as it might do at his first
dystyllacyon / and this may be twice done and no more In the which I have
found great virtue / But evil it is to know the fading of the waters and to
know the dew time wha^ it shall be po^ed out and cast away / except ye
know the time when it was dystylled. Never the less I shall show you a perte
thereof / how it may be done in v. (...) manners. First by the smell as these
waters following / rose water / water of myntes / melisse water / may flower
water named lilium conualium in latin camomell flower water / ysope water /
lauender water / rosemarye water / may^ layn water / fenel water / and such
like waters. If they be distylled in balneo marie or with a soft cole fire and
than well stoppyd / so they kept their sent / and when ye mark expressly
mynysshed fades op is holly gone / than ye ought to cast the^ out Secondarely
/ If the herbs have not sent nor favor that the water is dystyllyd of / than
ye shall take the water and hold your fyole or glass of a great hight and pour
out a perte of that water / if it spin ^e tha^ like a threde / it ought not to
be occupied / but cast away / for tha^ it has no virtue. The third manner / ye

well pleasyng to the pacyent / as I have showed before in the.ii. chapter of
the first book / but much better it were and more profitable to follow the
learned medycynes or physycyo^s wha^ they may be gotten O good lord how often
have I seen an onlerned physycion mynystre his medicines that knew nor
dysseases nor yet the complexyo^ but ministered hete to hete / through the which
the natural moistour was spente / and the body dried away and consumed or
moystour to moystour / through the which the body cotted away / or cold / by
the which the natural hete that should preserve the life of man is hole my
nyssed and brought to naught / for the holy prohphet Job says that the life of
man is planted for to dye a natural death with out any pain / if he may
attain his natural life unto the death / the which may so well come to
purpose / by an expert and learned master or physycyon. Wherefore I marvel for
that any wise person of understanding / can find in his heart to give
himself to fowlyshly over into the handys of any such onlerned master / that
knows another begynynge / myddest / nor end of medicynes not complexyo^s.
Thus I counsel you and instantly require you / that ye cast not away
ignora^tely the p^cyous yuwell of your naturallyfe / that almighty god had
created and planted in you naturally to be kept with such graces as he thereto
had given you / therewith to be preserved.
