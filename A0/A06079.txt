A Prayer to be said in the end of the morning prayer daily (through the
dioeces of Norwich) during the time of this hard and sharp wether / of frost
and snow / to crave mercy for our sins / and release of this sore ponishment
at the merciful hands of our good and graciouse God.
O Thou most great / most mighty and terrible God / the God of Hosts and Lord
of all power / at whose mighty presence the Angels do trimble / all powers
and dominations do dread and fear / at whose beck all creature in Heaven and
Earth do bow ^cy / at whose terrible contenaunce the elements do ^e and
shrink away / thou touchest the Earth and make (...) shake / thou touchest
ye mounteyns and make them ^oke / thy voice is a mighty and valeaunt voice /
thy (...) deuideth the waters in sonder and brakethe ye Cedar (...) in pieces /
at thy pleasure you gyuest snow like woll / and ^rest ye hoare frost like ashes
/ thou castest forth thy ^e morselles / who can abide ye cold thereof / thou
sen^ forth thy word and meltest them again / thou do ^inges as it pleases
the / in Heaven and in Earth / in the (...) and in all deep places. ^ent with
true repentance we ^hethe our hard and stonye hearts / make us soft and fleshy
(...) / write in them thy holy laws / grave them deep (...) a chesell of stele
/ that they may so sink and settle in our ^s that we neuar depart from them
again / in deed ^aue sinned / we have committed iniquity / we have (...)
wickedly before thy Majesty / we have gone a way (...) y^ / O Lord / and have
not harkned to thy voice / which (...) have uttered unto us by thy Servants ye
Prophets ^stles and Ministers / we have conte^ned to do thy word ^r rebelled
against thy most holy will. And therefore ^dinge to the truth of thy promise /
you have justly pow^ upon us the tokenes of thy displeasure / as thou have (...)
by thy servant Moses: If ye will not obey me / but (...) on stuvvornely against
me / I will ponish you yet ^times more according to your sins / I will break
^ride of your pour and I will make your Heaven as (...) / and your Earth as
brass / I will smite you with fa^ / with sickness / with heat and with cold /
I will destroy ^bours of your hands / the fruytes of ye Earth / your ^s and
cattle. According to thy threats thou have sent (...) impenitent sumers from
time to time thy great and ^rable plages / as water / fire / sword /
pestilence / fa^ / wild beasts / cruel enemies / froggs fliese / locustes
^oppers / caterpillars / meldewes / blastinges / hayle / ^es / frost / snow /
thunder / lightninges / draught / ^es / heat / and cold / which all be just
rewards for sin. ^h things O Lord / we feel now (in part) to our (...) grefe
to be full true. We have hardened our hearts ^ust thy word / and therefore have
thou hardened ye earth ^st us. We have been cold in love to the / and to our
^rne / therefore ye aer is now frosen unto us / we have ^en our eyes from
beholdinge thy truth / therefore the ^h hydeth her face from us / we have turned
our ^s toward thee / therefore thou turnest thy face from We have not brought
forth ye good fruytes of true re^nce / therefore the fruytes of the earth are
taken from ^e have not obeyed thee / our Lord and creator / ther^he creatures /
which thou made for our use refuse to (...) us. For we have abused them
vainly / proudly / rio^y / wantonly / excessiuely / vnmercyfully / and
vnchari^y. Wherefore they be both weried and ashamed to maintain our lewd life
any more. Our sins have separated thee / and thuse of thy creatures from us.
We have deceived our selves in the ways of our onne vanities / thinkinge our
selves to be wise we are proved stark fools / in our wealth and iolitie we
would not acknowleg thee. Where fore through necessity we are driven to seek
thee. We have been both vmnindfull and unthankful for thy manifold and
wonderful benefits continuallye powered upon us / and therefore be unworthy to
receive any more. We hyde not our sins from the / O Lord / our merciful
Father / but confess with sorrowful hearts and sighing souls / that the
offense and heavy displeasure of thy mighty Majesty a thousand times more
greueth us / then all the plages and ponishmentes in the world / yea though we
suffered the torments of hell / we do not defend our sins but utterly defye
them / we do not excuse our selves before thee / which know the secret of
all hearts / but accuse our sins to be ye cause of all our euelles / woe to
our wickedness that has offended thee / it is we that have offended / we do
acknowledge it / we do sele it / we do earnestlye repent it. As we have sown so
do we reap / as we have laid up so do we find / as we have deserved so do we
receive / even ye bitter cup of thy descrued wrath. Look done O Lord from
heaven / with thy pitefull eyes / behold our lamentable estate / the deep snow
has overwhelmed the Earth / the nipping frost has consinned the fruytes
thereof / thou that bring forth herbs and grass for the use of man and
beast / behold all is consumed and spent almost / you yt preseruest man and
beast / make some provision for both / the cattle do grove and make pitiouse
complaynt / ye herds do low / the flocks do bleet / the birds do cry to the
for succor and relese. Lord if they sterue / our bodyly food does perish /
for thou have given them unto us for meat: they have not sinned but we have
transgressed / they need not to repent / but we which have offended / we do
confess we are unworthy of thy favor and mercy / and yet thou dealest not so
hardly with us / as you have done / with many forlike offenses / whereas you
might worthyly plage us as thou have done them in thy sodeyne wrath / but
thou warnest us with lesser stourges / then we deserve / that we should turn
to thee with our hole heart / which of our selves we are not hable to do without
thee / wherefore convert us O Lord / and we shall be converted unto thee. Renew
you a right sprite within us / then shall we walk in thy ways who can make
clean yt which is conceived in vncleuenes but thou alone / no man can come unto
thee / except thou drowest him unto the / thou art good and we be evil / you
art holy / and we prophayne / thou art pure / and we polluted / thou art just
and we unjust / thou art life and we in death / thou art the physician / and we
thy patientes / thou art joy and gladness / and we be sorrowful and sadd / thou
art verity and we be vanity / thou art mercy and we in myserye / to whom
should we fly in our distres / but unto thee / if thou refuse us / who will
receive us / O Lord impert these rich and plentiful graces of thine unto us /
that be poor / nedie and beggarly / full of all noughtyues / and void of all
goodness / thou art our creator and we thy creatures / despise not O Lord the
work of thine own hands / thou art our God cast us not from thee / which be
thy people / thou art our King / defend us thy subjects / thou art our Pastore
seek up and save us thy lost sheep / thou art our Father give us thy Children
our daily bread / remember thy dear Soue Jesus Christ in whon you art pleased
and pacified, who is with the our advocate and patron / whose intercession for
us can not be vain / he is our head preserve us his members / he is our
bridgrome by thy graciouse consent / cast us not of his dearly bought sponse.
Thou have promised O dear Father to hear us in his name / if we had not
sinned we are thine / and if we sin yet through him we are thine / though we be
unworthy / through our offenses / yet is our Christ worthy for whose cause
thou should grant our petious / and greater is thy glory and more large thy
liberality / to give to those that be unworthy / it is a worthy thing for
thee / to make ye unworthy to be worthy / wherein thy grace does most abound /
you have promised by thy say thfull Servants the Prophets and Apostles / that
if we repent thou will no more remember our offenses / Lord thou know our
seble nature / and how we be but dust and ashes / frail stoble corruption and
worms of the earth more vain then nanitie it self / what praise can be to the
O mighty Lord to strive with dust and ashes / what strength is that to fight
against vain shadows / what power can that appear to beat down rotten
stoble / what great renown is yt to thee to tread down sely crawling worms
and drive them into dust / yt is Enough for thee O Lion most victoriouse of ye
tribe of Inda that we fall down before thy face / and yield our selves to thee
/ and then thine anger has an end. We are hear O Lord before thy Majesty
falling to the ground / confessinge our sins with sorrowful hearts and sobing
sighs in fasting / weping / and turning wholely unto thee / cranyng Perdon for
all our misdedes / proinising amendment and reforming of our sinful life /
according to thy holy word / beseching thee most heartily to indue us with thy
principal sprite ever to guide and direct us in the ways of thy laws and
works of thy commandments / and upon this our most humble submission / to
take away (if it be thy fatherly will and most for thy glory and our
commodity) this hard and sharp wether / melt this snow / miligate this frost
/ make bare the face of the Earth / bring forth fruytes and grass for the use
of man and beast / give seasonable wether / preserve the kinds / of beast and
foul / which thou have made for the service of man / that both in these
benefits and all other / thy creatures we may acknowledge thee / our mighty
Lord and graciouse God in knowledge we may truly worship the / in worshipyng
may love thee / in love may ever cleave fast to thee / without all separation
to glorifye thee / in thy everlasting kingdom / through the merits of thy
dearly beloved Sone our only Lord and Savior Jesus Christ / in whose name /
we are commanded to ask / and what so ever is needful according to thy will
we shall obtain / wherefore through him we are bold to come unto the throne of
thy grace saying as he has taught us.

Our Father which art in Heaven. etc. God Save the Queen.
Seane and allowyd.
