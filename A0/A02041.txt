The, xxv, orders of Fools,
STay a while with patience, my friends I you pray,
Of the orders of Fools, somewhat I will say:
Five and twenty, just a quarterne is ye know,
Every Fool in his foolishnes will I show.
And as the proverb does show very plain,
A hood for this fool, to keep him from the rain.
Many Fools, the carte of sin now a days does draw,
Nowrishyng their sin against all right and law:
Though that the way to hell be very plain,
Yet like a fool I advise thee to return again.
If thou in foolishnes still do dwell,
Thou shall have a babble and a bell.
* He is a fool that his sins can not hate,
Naught young, worse old, such is his estate:
This old fool is glad of that name,
Desiryng all men to take part of the same.
This fool must have in hand without fail,
A babble, a bell, or else a Fox tail.
Of Fools, yet I find an other sort,
Which are causers of lying, and ill report:
And he is a fool both even and morrow,
That nothing will lend, but all things borrow.
And as the proverb does show very plain
A hood for this fool to keep him from the rain.
* Of Fools, yet an other sort does come,
Which never seeks for to have wisdom:
Many such fools, wisdom disdain,
Yet for their foolishnes they shall suffer pain.
And as the proverb does show very plain,
A hood for this fool, to keep him from the rain.
He is a Fool which to others does preach and tell,
And yet this fool is ready himself to go unto hell:
Live thou uprightly, be cause of no blame,
If thou do not, the more is thy shame.
And as the proverb does say very plain,
A hood for this fool, to keep him from the rain.
* He is a Fool, and ever be shall,
That others judges, and himself worst of all:
This fool is blind, frantike, and wood,
Without all reason, judges bad things good.
And as the proverb does show very plain,
A hood for this fool, to keep him from the rain.
He is a Fool that wisdom does eschew,
For no good counsel can bring him to virtue:
This fool which scorneth his neighbor fast,
Shall be scorned justly himself at the last.
And as the proverb does show very plain,
A hood for this fool, to keep him from the rain.
* An other Fool yet, I do here find,
Which can not keep close the secrets of his mind:
This is a natural fool, and indiscreet,
Which can not hyde his own counsel and secret.
And as the proverb does show very plain,
A hood for this fool, to keep him from the rain.
He is a Fool, that in youth will not provide,
In age must he sterue, or in poverty abide:
This is a fool, and of the numbe one,
Which in the Summer can make no provision.
And as the proverb does show very plain,
A hood for this fool, to keep him from the rain.
* He is a Fool, that gets his goods wrongfullye,
For his heirs after him, will spend it vnthriftelye:
This fools gold is his God, wrongfullye got,
Why you fool, thy gold is muk and clay, know thou not?
And as the proverb does show very plain,
A hood for this fool, to keep him from the rain.
He is a Fool, whether he be man or wife,
Whice still deliteth in discord and strife:
Such fools their own flesh to the bones may gnaw,
That contendeth in matters, scant worth a straw.
And as the proverb does show very plain,
A hood for this fool, to keep him from the rain.
* He is a Fool that on message is sent,
And when he is on his way, forgot whether he went:
This feel is worthy of the babble and the bell,
For of all other fools, he does excel.
And as the proverb does show very plain,
A hood for this fool, to keep him from the rain.
Yet of Fools, a whole dozen I have espied,
And lead in a stryng, together they are tied:
These fools you may know by their favor,
For like the Aspen leaf, with every wynd they waver.
And as the proverb does show very plain,
A hood for these fools, to keep them from the rain.
* He is a Fool, that thinks it great wonder,
When God stryketh by lightnyng and thunder:
Alas, we daily without all dread commit
Much cursed vice, for lack of godly wit.
And as the proverb does show very plain,
A hood for this fool, to keep him from the rain.
All youth, I do lyken unto Fools blind,
That unto their Parents are rebels unkind:
Thou unkind child, and fool disobedient,
Remember what goods thy friends on thee spent.
And as the proverb does show very plain,
A hood for these fools, to keep them from the rain.
* He is a Fool, that greatly does flatter and boast,
When he thinks least, he shall taste of the roast:
This fool at last, is cast out of favor,
For flatteryng pleases no wise man of honor.
And as the proverb does show very plain,
A hood for this fool, to keep him from the rain.
He is a Fool, and void of all prudence,
Which to vain tales does give all his credence:
Therefore remember this both low and hye,
That flatterers speak fair when they do lie.
And as the proverb does show very plain,
A hood for this fool, to keep him from the rain.
* He is a natural Fool, and a very daw,
That from doing good, his neighbor does withdraw:
Such froward fools, all goodness they defile,
If their neighbors do good, then they revile.
And as the proverb does show very plain,
A hood for this fool, to keep him from the rain.
He is a Fool, and greatly vnprouable,
That in all his doings he is vnfortunable:
But in his misfortune he is so blind,
He never considers no remedy in mind.
And as the proverb does show very plain,
A hood for this fool to keep him from the rain.
* He is a Fool, that himself does apply
Behynd his neighbors back to sclander with envy:
Such beastly fools commonly are well a paid,
Which think all is well, that falsely is wayd.
And as the proverb does show very plain,
A hood for this fool, to keep him from the rain.
Yet more Fools there be, which be vncommendable,
That uses ill manners always at the table:
Of pleasant nurtour they have no heed,
But beastly entend as swyne always to feed.
And as the proverb does show very plain,
A hood for these fools, to keep them from the rain.
* Many Fools there be, in these our days,
Which seem to be wise, yet follow foolish ways:
Therefore I have told unto you very plain,
What foolishnes in these days in many does remain.
And as the proverb does show very plain,
A hood for these fools, to keep them from the rain.
He is a Fool, that will still desire
His own death, to run in to the fire:
And he is a fool, that has no mind devout,
But in the temple still walks about.
And as the proverb does show very plain,
A hood for these fools to keep them from the rain.
* GOD grant that all Fools wisdom may learn,
And that they may good from ill always discern:
Then no more fools we may them call,
But wise men, and wisdom show they shall.
God grant that on all parts we may now begin
To repent of our follye, and fly from our sin.
FINIS.
