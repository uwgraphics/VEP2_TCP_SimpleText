redouted king of England / Henry the.viii. were saluted with / passing through
London.

depiction of a king with sword and orb

royal blazon supported by a griffin and greyhound
THe great triumph / how should one man discryue
(The lusty fresh deuyses / the su^ptuous rich array
The crafty imagery / so like to folk a live
With bright colors shyning / fressher than the May)
That was in London / of June the sixte day
What time the Egle persyng the son beams
Entered with the lion / drad in all reames.
The pagiant goodly wrought and of great valor
Set with deuyses / and made curiously
Plenysshed with personages all of pleasure
In some virgyns / attyred gorgiously
In other some children / making sweet armony
And some with rich arms / dasshed full they were
Which did shine / and luster wonders clear.
The reasons / and eke proverbs many fold
Very subtly conveyed / at each place
Ornately written in / letters all of gold
Justly to write / should be to long a space
ye / and one may fortune greatly in that case
To err. that would upon him undertake
Of each thing / true relacyon for to make.
why should one write / that each man with his eye
Did welbeholde and se / wandering to and fro
I suppose for truth / no man should set thereby
Therefore I shall it no we pass and over go
And brefely shall dyrect my self unto
The matter that I purpose to declare
In rude english / insentence gross and bare.
In diverse places / as ye shall understand
There was a child that stood all alone
Which child / held a role in his hand
But what he said / there knew few or none
Wherefore to me / there have come many one
Demaundyng / what these same children meant
And many I enfourmed of their intent.
For fervent love (I said) and great honor
They had lusty verses / composed ornately
Caesar to salute. and the high conqueror
Henry the eight our king* the only glory
Of all erthely kings / and of chiualry
The flour. Beloved and dradde of great and small
Throughout the great world over all.
what meant the verses / they asken by and by?
And till they know / with them I have no rest
And for that I saw them / so desirously:
Enquere thereof. I thought it for the best /
The self same verses / to do be emprest
ye / and farthermore / under correction
Of them to make a rude translation.
So bold I am / of that master most humayne
Cleped Lily: his fresshe verses to translate
In to our tongue / out of their ornate vain
Of pure latin. To the end that to each state
Learned and vnlernd / they should be celebrate
And first in latin / here ye shall them find
And after englysshed / I trust to your mind.
CArolus Henricus uiuant. Defensor uterque
Henricus Fidei. Carolus Ecclesiae.
These verses were written in letters of gold / and set up at the cross in
chepe / and at every pagiant: and they be englysshed thus.

GOd save noble Charles / and pusant king Henry
And give to the^ both: good health / life / and long
The one of holy church / defender right mighty
The other of the faith / as cha^pions most strong.
