TO THE RELIGIOUS BROTHERS OF THE SOCIETY OF JESUS, In the English Nouitiate ^
WATTEN.
RELIGIOUS BROTHERS,
I send you heer^ a Manual of spiri^uall Exercises, set forth some ^eares
ago, in the Spanish ^ongue, by Fa Thomas de Villa^astin of your Society, now
translated into English: which doubtless will produce special virtues in you,
who have the same spirit, wherewith it was written. And this has moved me to
present the same to you, in whom I hoped my small labors herein should be
most abundantly recompensed, by the increase of your spiritual Comfort and
Profit.

I was furthermore induced heereunto, because I deemed no Book more fit to be
presented unto you then this, being derived, as it seems, from the very
fountain of your holy Patriarch S. Ignatius his Spiritual Exercises. And I
could not doubt, but you the Sons of so worthy a Father would receive with
great af^ection and tenderness, an Or^hane of so worthy a Parent.

Another reason was, for that I having received so many, and continual
benefits from your Society (to whom I am ever, more then most ob^iged) and
never yet finding opportunity to show my self grateful, answerable to my
desires: I thought this small occasion not to be neglected, ^n offering so
mean a present unto you, in sign at least, of grateful memory toward your
Holy Order.

In this Manual, you may behold and contemplate ^ost perfectly, the lively
virtues of our Savior, and of his Blessed Mother, propounded unto you for your
daily Exercise of Meditation. Here may you learn to follow, and trace out the
footsteps of true Poverty, Humility, Charity, Obedience, and the like. Here
may you taste spiritually of the most pleasant fruit, which from these devout
and piou^ Meditations is gathered. In a word, here may you exercise your
selves in all the heroical acts of Virtue, which our Lord and Master Christ
Jesus, the most exact and perfect pattern of all Perfection, has left unto us
for example.

I will not be tedious, thereby to detayne you from the trial of what I have
promised, by meditating the Mysteries that ensue. It shall suffice me, that you
will be pleased to tak^ in good part this my least labor, and now and then, in
these and other you^ devotions, to remember

Your humble, and de^oted servant, I. VV.

THE PREFACE OF THE AUTHOR TO THE Christian Reader.
ONE of the principal Reasons which moved me to write this Manual of pious
Considerations, for the help of such as use to pray mentally, is the great
desire, I know many Religious, and other secular Persons, seruan^s of God, have
of some brief Treatise, whereby they might with profit spend their time in
prayer. Wherefore I have thought good briefly to set down the sum of that,
which many grave Authors, and M^ysters of spiritual life, have more large^y
and profitably handled. Whose doctrine (especially those of our own Order) I
have endeauored to ^ollow, using for my chief guide heerin the spiritual
Exercises of ^ur glorious Fou^der S. Ignatius, to adorn this my little
Manu^ll, desiring to have that portable ^n our bosom, which ought ever ^o be
fixed in our soul and heart, ^aying with the Spouse: Fasci^ulus myrrhae
dilectus meus ^ihi, inter vbera mea com^orabitur: A bundle of myrr^ ^y beloved
unto me, betwixt ^y breasts he shall abide.

The Aduertis^ents placed in the beginning, do particulerly show how to treat
and converse with the divine Majesty, together with the use of the Meditations
and Considerations set down in the three Book^ following. The first whereof
shall be of the Last things of man. The second, and third of the Life, Passion,
Death, and Resurrection of Christ, placing in every Meditation four points,
each one of them sufficient for the Exercise of one, or more hours about three
several things which every Point shall contain, towit, Consideration,
Examination, and Application to the frui^ which out of that full measure of
perfection, which Christ exercised in the whole course of his life, may be
gathered.

In the end of the third Book, I adioyne also several Meditations directing
us both how to prepare our selves before and how to give thanks after the holy
Communion; that time being far more fit for Meditation, then for vocal
prayer. Thus much I propose briefly and plainly to the pious Reader: for
whatsoever sauoureth of curiosity* cools de^otion, and hinders Prayer, in
which Truth, not Eloque^^e i^ to be sought.

But because nothing of this is to be obtay^ed without the grace of God, I mos^
humbly be^eech him to gra^n^ (...) such plenty theref, that h^s most holy lif^
and death may (...) unto us a ^erfect pattern, rule, and guide of all our
thoughts, words, and deeds, that (like true soldiers of his spiritual
warfare) following our Captain CHRIST^ JESUS, we may be partakers here in
this world of his grace* and in heaven of his Glory. Amen.

A MANVALL OF SPIRITVALL EXERCISES. ^or the help of such as desire to practice
mental Prayer.
The Introduction.
HE that de^ireth to increase and go forward in spiritual life, let him know,
that the certain and undoubted way to the same, the interior and mutual
commu^^cation with Almighty God, per^^rmed in the holy use and exercise^^
prayer: because in prayer virtues (...) obtained, conserved, and aug^ented.
Prayer (as the Apostle Sai^^ James says) ascending unto heaven before the
tribunal seat of Almigh^^ ^od brings unto men every go^^ and perfect gift,
causing such a leag^^ and union between God and the^ that it makes them apt
to receive (...) graces and benefits from his (...) Majesty.

Daniell by prayer converted (...) ^^erce and hungry Lions into mee^^ Lambe^.
Prayer made the fire to loo^^ ^is force, being notable to burn (...) three
Children in the midst of (...) ^^aming furnace of Babylon. Pray^^ stayed the
course, and altered the (...) form motion of the heavens, giui^^ power unto
the voice of man to sto^^ and detain the Sun and Moon^ and that so many
hours as was n^^cessary for obtaining the victory ^^gainst his Enemies. Jacob
throu^^ the virtue and efficacy of praye^ prevailed against the Angel. Y^^
Prayer tied the hands and infin^^ power (if so we may say) of the Lo^^ of
Angel^s: for by the prayers (...) Moses Almighty God seemed to (...) it ^ere
disabled to c^astice and stri^ ^^^ending people, when he said unto (...)
servant: Suffer me that my fury ^ay be angry against them; as if he ^ould say:
detain me not with thy ^^^ayers Prayer finally obtains par^^n for whatsoever
offenses: the Pu^^ican gets remission of his sins, (...) the Prodigal
child returns a^^ine into favor and friendship with (...) Father.

Prayer therefore being so pro^able and necessary unto spiritual (...), and
containing w^thall so many (...) so great helps and excellencies, (...) we have
seen, obtaining by the ^^^uine virtue and power thereof what^^euer it will in
heaven and earth, it (...) necessary that no day pass (espe^^ally with a
Religious person who ^^sireth perfection) without prayer, (...) that he spend
therein one or more ^^ures.

Some peradventure will here (...), that although he grant this (...) to be
both expedient and ne^^ssary, yet not for him who knows (...) how to pray,
nor discourse ther^^: because considerations do not o^curr^ where with to
dilate and exten^ his discourses, and so his skeine (...) thread being cut off
and presently e^^ded, therewith the gust and desi^^ he had to persevere in this
holy exe^^cise, is also ended, and he wearied for that as it seems unto him,
(...) profits not at all, and thus he leaue^^ it quite off.

To whom I answer (and (...) is very much to be noted) that (...) such a one
should understand, th^^ Prayer does rather consist in affect and desires of the
Will, then in di^^courses and speculations of the V^^derstanding; he would not
find su^^ difficulty, nor yet be discouraged, (...) discomforted so much, ^or
would intermit and leave off his prayer (...) soon: and much less, if he kne^
that (as the directors and Masters (...) spiritual life do observe) great
he^^ is to be taken, that the speculation (...) the understanding, be not used
i^ e^cesse, because it does greatly hind^^ the devotion, prayer, and effect of
(...) Will: especially when we entertai^^ our selves with subtle and curio^^
^^nsiderations.

Whence it comes to pass (...) experience teac^eth) that many ^^^es ignorant
and unlearned per^^ns, pray better, and are more de^ut, then those who have
much ^ore learning, and their prayer al^^ often succedeth better, because ^^ey
do not busy nor distract them^^lues with curiosities, but forth with ^^deauour
by prayer and the first oc^^rring considerations, to move and (...) the Will to
affections, And (...) them such humble and ordinary ^^nsiderations, cause more
devotion ^^d move them more, working in ^^em greater effects, then high and
^^rious do in the learned.

Let us bring an example, see^^g we have such plenty of them in ^oly Scripture,
where the holy Ghost ^ith very plain and common com^arisons, does declare unto
us most ^igh and subt^^ things. As in those ^ords of the 54. Psalm* where the
^oyall Prophet says: Who will ^iue me wings, as a dove, and I will (...) and
rest? And S. Ambrose asks the question: Wherefore the hol^ Prophet desiring
to fl^, and to ascen^ aloft, required the wings of a dou^^ and not of other
birds, not withstanding there be others more swift the^ the dove. And he thus
answers* because he knew well that to fly up t^ the height of perfection, and
to pray well, are fitter the wings of a dove* that is to say, the simple and
right o^ heart, then those of sharp and subtle understanding.

Hence it ^olloweth, that if ou^ Lord do show unto thee this favor, that with
a plain and ordinary consideration (whereof there be many i^ this Manual, as
if by the only consideration how God became man, was borne, laid in a manger,
and dyed upon the Cross for thee) thou art inflamed with his love, and with
desire of humbling and mortifying thy self, and in this thou imploiest the
whole hour; thou have the^ made a far better prayer, and much more profitable,
then if thou haddst performed it with many discourses, and with high and very
learned considerations and conceits, for that thou ^ast employed and detayned
thy self (...) the very best, and most substanti^ll part of Prayer, and in
that which (...) the end and fruit of the same.

Neither does the perfection of prayer consist in having certain sensible
gustes and consolations, nor in ^auing great and unwonted contem^lation, for
this is not in our own ^ower, nor yet in performing the said acts with such
sensible feeling: But in this the fruit consists, that ^hou arise from
Prayer very humble ^atient, obedient, indifferent, and mortifyed. And seeing
that this is always in our own power (the grace of God presupposed) know,
that if ^hou wilt thy self, thou may ever make a good and fruitful prayer,
which is a thing of very great comfort, for those who give themselves to this
holy Exercise.

Wherefore it seems unto me, that having laid so good a foundation in this
Introduction, and sowed in so good an earth (as are the heart of such as desire
Perfection) so important seed, we may well hope t^^gather (with the Divine
assistance) not only, Fruit of thirty, but also (...) threescore, and an
hundred fold. Especially observing the ensuing Ad^ertisments (it being a matter
of n^^ small moment, to perform our praye^ in the best manner) which therefore
must be read with leisure, not once, but many times, and that with attention
and consideration, least w^ walk as blind men in the way of this holy Exercise.

These Aduertisments instruct how we ought to prepare our selves, how to enter,
continue, speak, and treat with Almighty God in Prayer; they show the fruit
and profit which thence is to be gathered, of which though some (to the eyes
of worldly judgment) seem not to be of such importance, yet are they such in
regard of the end which is pretended, for as much as they dispose to the
attayning of great matters, without the which we can very hardly be
recollected and devout. And nothing is to be esteemed as little, but of great
^oment, when it is done with intent ^^d desire thereby the more to please ^^d
serve our Lord. Whereupon (...) Holy Ghost says: that he who ^^^reth God,
neglects nothing, nei^^er in little, nor in much: because ^^at every little
helps and furthe^^^h that which is great, and the great ^^nnot be conserved
without the ^^le.

THE I. ADVERTISMENT.
How we ought to prepare the matter for Prayer.

^N the Evening before we go to bed, let us ever read one or more points of
the meditations contai^^d in this book, whereof the day ^^xt following we are
make our ^^ayer. And the better to put away ^ule and unclean imaginations,
which (...) the night, more then at other ^^^es the Devil uses to (...) in
the ^^ansy, let us fall asleep, think^^g ^^on the aforesaid Exercise. (...) ^e
morning as soon as we (...) us offer unto God all our though^^ words and
deeds of the day to come This done, we may presently call to mind, the points
of the Exercise which we read over night, endeavoring to imprint in our memory
the verities of our holy Faith: for i^ the understanding be occupied in other
extrauagant imaginations they will be an ocasion of distraction, ^loth, and
ircksomnes in prayer, ye^ and a cause sometimes the sooner to leave it off.

S. Bonauenture, and S. ^ho^ Climacus, esteem this advise v^ry important: and
it may well be that from them our Holy Father Ignatiu^ had the same, whom we
know both to have used it himself, and to have ^ommended it unto us his
children very seriously. For we read of him, that not only in his begi^ning,
but also even after he was become an old man, he did read and prepare his
prayer over night, and went to rest with this care of well performing the same
in the morning. No man therefore is to think, that this thing only is to ^^^ue
for Nouices and young beginners*

And generally this Holy Man, ^ur B. Father, was wont to say, that upon the
observation of these and like ^uises (which he calls Additions, (...) we
Auertisments) depends in ^eat part the good success of prayer, ^^d that we
reap the desired fruit and ^^ofit thereby. And we who be his ^^ildren, do prove
very ordinaryly, ^^at when we go well prepared, and ^o exactly observe these
aduises, our ^^ayer succeeds well; and that it ^lleth out contrary when we
are r^^isse and negligent therien.

THE II. ADVERTISMENT.
How we ought to prepare our selves to speak unto God, in mental Prayer.

A Little while before we enter into Prayer, let us consider what we go about
to do, and ^ith whom we are to speak and (...). For it is the counsel of the
^oly Ghost, which says, That (...) prayer we prepare our (...) go^ without
preparation, (...)

THE III. ADVE^TISMENT.
Of the place convenient for Prayer.

VVH^N we will talk and communicate with any friend of ours concerning matters
of importance, and wherein we receive much contentment, we commonly take him
aside, or walk with him into the fields, or we shut our selves up in some
chamber, where no body may interrupt or hinder us. After the same manner it is
most expedient for him that desires to pray well, and to converse and
nego^iate with Almighty God concerning hi^ salvation (which is of more weight
and consequence, then any thing upon earth) to seek a place most re^yred and
quiet, where no body may disturb or hinder him.

A Religious man, if he may make his Prayer in the Quite, or Church, it is
better (being in the presence of the most B. Sacra^ent) but if this may not be,
his Cell or Chamber willbe best, A secular per^^n in his Oratory, and if he
have one, let him procure to shut him^^lfe into some ^etyred place, shutting
(...) windows and doors of his cham^er, for so Christ our Lord counsai^th,
saying: When thou shall pray, ^^ter into thy chamber, and having ^^ut the
door, pray to thy Father in ^^cret: for with this secresy and qui^^nes the
senses are more recollected, and the soul more lively and attent. ^f this we
have example in S. Anto^y, Ars^nius, Macarius, Pacomius and other Saints, in
whose historie^ ^e read, that they betook themselves unto desert and solitary
places, that (...) they might be the more retired.

And we see that our Lord himself (the Saint of all Saints) did pra^tise the
same; for when he was to ^egin the preaching of his Gospel, ^e retired
himself into the Desert, ^emayning forty days and forty ^ights in prayer:
and other times he went very often to spend the night unto the mountains and
gardens, where retyring himself for the time, and leaving his Disciples, he
set himself all alone to pray; not for tha^ his most sacred Humanity stood in
any need of a retired place to pray in (wherein nothing could be an impediment
unto him in that holy Exer^ise) but only to show and instruct (...) what
necessity we have of a retired and quiet place to pray, with attention and
recollection of mind. And certain it is that if darkness did not help much
unto recollection, Saint Antony the Abbot would not have complained of the
Sun, that when it did rise, it deprived him with his beams and brightness
of the quiet of contemplation. And although it be true, that to make choice
altogether of a solitary life, is not fit for all, but rather for very few;
yet to seek a solitary, retired, and quiet place to converse alone for some
days with God, and every day for the ordinary time of Prayer (whereof we now
treat) apper^aineth unto every one.

But let us put the case, that we cannot have any retired place, nor any such
opportuni^y as we speak of, yet were not this a sufficient cause (...) say,
that we could not, or had not (...) such quiet place wherein to pray, (...) has
been said: for he that is de^^rous to pray, and to adore God pre^nt in every
place, may do it in a^y place. For not only Adam in Pa^dise, but Joseph in the
prison, Job upon the dunghill, Daniell among (...) Lions, and Jonas prayed and
^^lessed God in the Whales belly. And (...) read of the holy Virgin S. Ag^es,
^^at the foul and unclean place ^hereinto she was thrust, became unto her a
house of Prayer. And if ^is be true, as indeed it is, it follow^^h that we may
p^ay, honor, and ^rayse God in any place whatsoever.

THE IIII. ADVERTISMENT.
What time is best for mental Prayer.

NEXT after a retired and secret place, a convenient and fit time is to be
procured for Prayer: and the best time is (as S. Bonauen^^re notes) after
midnight till the ^reake of day: and out of all this time, we may choose the
hour of medi^^tion, wherein the most easy is the first hour in the morning.
To which effect it will be needful that we lead (...) ordered life, going to
bed at such (...) hour, that having slept so much as (...) necessary, we may
rise in due time: for so we find that when God would visit his Saints and
discover unto the^ his sacred mysteries, he used ordinarily to make choice of
the night; so h^ did unto Samuel disclosing unto him marvelous secrets in the
temple. And to the most glorious Virgin sending unto her his embassage from
heaven by his Angel. So to S. Joseph, admonishing him to fly into Egypt. And
to the three Kings, aduising the^ that they should not return unto Herod.

These, and the like re^elation^ Almighty God does use to reveal by night, as
his Prophet says, which is an evident sign that this time is most apt for the
conversation with God and to contemplate celestial things, for then with the
darkness and silence of the night, with the repose and quie^ of all
creatures, the mind is more re^ollect and attent. And so confe^^eth David, that
at midnight and in the morning he rose to pray, and to praise Almighty God: but
notwithstanding that this time be most conueniient for ^entall p^ayer, yet if
then we cannot ^oe it, we may take any hour of the morning or evening; and if
in that ^lso we be hindered, then the nearer unto the morning or evening the
better, and so much more profitable ^ilbe our recollection: for the nearer ^he
morning, the more our spirit^ ^aue vigor and force, the head i^ ^etter
disposed, and the body refre^hed; and in the evening, the refecti^n taken at
noone does less^ ^inder* and so we shall find our selves, more ^ble and ready
to prav, and more apt (...) endure and persevere therein.

THE V. ADVERTISMENT.
Of the presence of God, helping to attention and reverence in Prayer.

HAVING chosen the time and place where we are to pray (...) first of all we
are to make the sign of the Cross, and joining our hands together stand and
pause for the space of a Pater Noster, then li^ting up our heart, and the powers
of our soul to heaven, ^e are to behold and as it were to place our selue^ in
the presence of the living God, being undoubtedly there by Essence, Presence,
and Power: considering that we are not all alone, but before that gr^a^ and
infinite Majesty of Almig^ty God, then, and there, looking upon v^ according as
^he great Prophet Elias did when he savd: our Lord lives, the God of Israel,
in whose sight I stand* And heerewith quickening our faith, let us make to this
our Lord and God (three in person and one in essence, whom innumerable Angels
do adore) a great and profound reverence, bending before him the knees of our
heart, and body unto the ground, one, twice, and thrice, adoring and worshipping
the three divine persons, first the Father, then the Son, lastly the Holy
^host.

And this humiliation wherewith ^e begin our Prayer, is not only to ^e exterior
and with the body, but ^lso interior and with the mind, en^ring into our
selves, and considering that we have not any thing of our sel^es, either in
Being, Substance, or ^alue, nor any thing but innumerable ^innes, for which we
deserve euer^asting pain and torment. And this may be an effectual means to
pray well, for by this humiliation the just become more just, and the holy more
^oly. Whereof give ^estimony Abra^am, Tobias, Daniel, and other Saints, of whom
the holy Scripture ^elateth, that they began their prayers ^y humbling
themselves* And by this ^inners ob^a^ne mercy, and become ^uit* Manasses Kind
of Israel (a great ^inner) and the Publican in the Gos^ell, by humbling himself
in his Pray^r, went thence justified. And so shall we, without doubt, if we
humble our selves in like manner, as we ought to do.

THE VI. ADVERTISMENT
How, and with what composition of body we ought to pray.

THE composition of body, (...) Prayer, is to be wa^ghed, an^ used according to
the health* disposition, and forces thereof: no^ kneeling if we be in good
health an^ ^ble, now prostrate upon the ground* sometimes standing, especially
(...) drowsines do molest and trouble us, sometimes sitting with humility,
(...) our indispositio^ require it, yet so, that the humble manner of our
sitting, declare the desire we have not to rest, but to pray. For if the body
should be in pain or torment, we cannon have the repose and quiet of mind
which is required for this holy exer^ise: although sometimes it wilb^ good to
mortify and punish the body therein also, not granting all that it asks:
especially if thereby we ^^nde our selves remiss, negligent, and distracted.

We have many examples in (...) holy Scripture of the exterior re^^rence which
the holy Saints used in ^^ayer. Of that great servant of God ^oyses it is said,
that to pray unto ^od in the mount Synai, he did pro^^ate himself upon the
ground. And (...) Daniell, that he prayed bowing ^oth knees unto the ground.
This ^anner of reverence did our Lord ^^sus Christ himself use, in the long
^^ayer made unto his eternal Father (...) the garden, where kneeling down
(...) prostrated himself upon the gro^nd, and it is credible that he did the
^me other times, as when he ^ent (...) pray in the mountains.

This example, the Apostles and ^ther holy Saints have followed. And amongst
the rest it is recorded of S. ^^mes the younger, that through con^nuall kneeling
both by day and ^ight, his knee^ became as hard (...) ^^ose of a camel:
teaching us there^y the great esteem we ought to ha^^ (...) exterior reverence
in Prayer, a^ thing singularly helping (...) ^euotion, greatly glorifying God*
(...) marvelous edific^tion (...) Neighbors. Let us therefore (...) procure
to glorify him, and edify (...) Neighbor, when we pray.

THE VII. ADVERTISMEN^
How we ought to couuerse and spe^^ with God in Prayer*

THE manner to converse (...) Almighty God in mental Pra^er must be not with
exteriou^ but interior words: not long, (...) for all the time our P^ayer
enduret^ but brief and in few words, acc^^ding as our Bl^ss^d Savior teache^
(...) in the Gospel, saying: When you pray speak not much. And S* Augustine
^xpou^ding this place (...) the Gospel notes, that it is (...) thing to
speak much, and discou^^ with the understanding, and anoth^^ thing to stay
long in the act of lou^ and affections of the Will Whe^fore the former is that
which is to be a^^yded in Prayer, for that is (...) to speak and prattle much:
where^ the business or nature of Prayer, ^^^sisteth not in many words, (...)
(...) way to negotiate with Almigh^^ God, to use much Rhetorike, a ^^dance of
discourse, and curious ^ceits, but rather by sighs, tears, (...) compunction
of heart: For although we say nothing with our lips, (...) may cry nevertheless
with our heart ^Moyses did* unto whom our Lord (...): Why cryest thou unto me?
^hereas the Holy man said not a (...), but only prayed with so great ^^our and
efficacy in his heart, as (...) had cried out aloud unto God.

We therefore in this manner ^ght also to make our prayer and unto Almighty
God, and if per^^enture heerewith we find our (...) distracted, being not able
with (...) discourse to prosecute our Prayer (...) that quiet and repose we
desire, (...) rather find our selves assaul^ed (...) diverse thoughts and
distractions, ^illbe good to make use of a re^dy which the R. Father M. John
^^la gives in one of his spiritual ^^stles, saying: That we m^st cast (...)
selves at the feet of Christ, being (...) for the fault, and cause given of
that distraction: And so compl^ning and lamenting in humble (...) loving
manner, we may say voc^ these, or the like words.

How is it possible, O my Go^ that thou will permit, that I so (...) creature,
and so vile a worm, (...) in presence of thee my Creaour (...) Maker with so
little reverence, atte^tion and devotion, and so much ^^stracted! Do not permit
so vnwor^^ a thing, I beseech thee. Then (...) to thy soul, and say unto her:
my soul reflect upon thy self, (...) what thou do and with whom (...)
speak. Consider, that perh^^ this may be the last hour that the have to
pray in, and that this may the last day of thy life.

This done, let us return our prayer again and interior communication with
God, as has bee^ said, and if nevertheless we can^ cast off and be rid of these
distract^^^ as being p^rhaps the just and deser^^ chastizement of Almighty God,
(...) the great and manifold sins of (...) life past, and present negligence
may say unto him.

O my God, I accept with a (...) good will, and do rejoice to (...) from thy
hands this Cross of (...) and dryness, this distraction, ^^mfort, and
spiritual solitude of (...) thus forsaken of thee, and left (...) self. And
we may be assured (...) patience and humility, and this ^ormity with the will
of Almigh^^ ^od, to be a very good Prayer, more acceptable unto his divine
^esty, then the Prayer would be (...) we desired to make: for sancti^^d holiness
of life does not con^^ having the gift of Prayer, but ^ing the will of Almighty
God. (...) if his divine Majesty do please ^^nduct us by this way, yet eue^
^ein we shall not fail to become (...) and perfect, as well as in the o^

THE VIII. ADVERTISMEN^
With what force, and attention (...) ought to pray.

TO the end that our Prayer (...) performed with recollection (...) ^ttention,
it imports (...) much, not to take it in hand as a b^ sinesse of little, or
small moment, ^^rashly but advisedly, not sleepily (...) drowsily, no^ with a
slow and (...) ^art, but with a lively, attent, (...) undaunted courage: for
otherwise (...) should not be void of fault, and mig^ justly fear the
malediction and (...) of the prophet Jeremy, who says Cursed be he that does
the worke^ our Lord fr^udulen^ly. And it is m^ nifest that this work of God
mentioned by the Prophet, is Prayer.

Neither yet is such and so (...) attention and force to be used (...) prayer,
as if by force of arms (as (...) may say) we would seem to get (...) conserve
attention and devotion: (...) so in lieu of pleasing and sweet milk^ we should
wring our blood, as (...) ^^^edome of God signifies in the ^uerbes* And so
this labor and (...) would serve to no other end* (...) to break and weary
the head, (...) overthrow our health: causing (...) a certain fear and
horror of (...) holy Exercise, the which also we (...) then be forced to
intermit and (...) off in the midway, for want of ^ces to continue, as they
use to b^ ^nting unto the wa^-faring man, ^en ^e makes overmuch have (...)
beginning of his journey.

Wherefore to eschew these two ^^remes, such a moderation is to be ^ed, that
neither by overmuch stri^g for attention the head be weari^, nor yet by
overmuch carelessness (...) negligen^^ our thoughts be per^itted to wander
without restraint: (...) one of the things which are wont trouble and hinder us
very much Prayer, are these importunate and ^seasonable thought^ which occur
well through our own frailty, as ^o by the suggestion, subtility, and ^alice
of the Devil, laboring to under our prayers and attention. Wherefore the
remedies which (...) are to use for the ouerco^ming of (...) with the grace of
God, may be the (...) that follow.

First, not to behold, regar^^^ search into, or fight against every (...) of
them in particular, but rather tu^ning our mind from them, to (...) them away,
yea and making no a^count of them, to prosecute and (...) on without stay in
our meditation (...) ready begun.

The second and most principa^ remedy, must be the true love of Almighty God,
for thereby is obtaine^ a sweet repose, and devout attentio^ in prayer: Hereby
with ease (...) vain and fruitless thoughts are expelled and banished out of
the mind both in, and out of Prayer: For (...) Truth it self says, Where thy
treasure is, there is thy heart also; that (...) to say, whersoeuer our love and
affection is, and the thing we much esteem, there is our thought: so
experience it self teaches, that whatsoever we love or desire much, tha^ we
continually think on without labor or difficulty: yea and without (...)
endeavor of ours, even of them^^lues our thoughts will ever be run^^ng upon
that which our heart loves (...) desires.

Let us procure therefore, with (...) our endeavor, to increase and go ^^rward
in the love of God; for by (...) much the more we shall love ^im, so much the
more easily shall (...) think of him, and without la^^^ar or difficulty be
united with him. (...) thus with a quiet and sweet repose (...) may find our
desired attention and ^^euotion in Prayer.

THE IX. ADVERTISMENT.
^ow in Prayer we are to pass from one point to another.

WHEN Almighty God shall move our Will with any affection, through the
^^^sideration of any one point in that ^^nistery whereon we meditate, we are
^^ot to pass unto another, but therein (...) we can, to spend the whole hour
(...) time of our Pra^er, and so interrupting the discourse of our
Vnder^standing, it is good to make a paus^^ and stay in some affection and
desire^ of the Will, until we have satisfied our self therein, and imprinted
it very well in our mind, because for the spending of an hour or more in
Prayer, many points are not necessary, nor variety of discourses and
considerations: neither is it needful by and by to pass from one
consideration to another, or from one point to another; but finding one which
of it self affoardeth sufficient matter to work upon, abide sometime therein,
weighing and pondering it with leisure and attention, until our will be moved
to some affection of moment, or admiration of such or such a benefit, or with
some special desire of serving our Lord, who has labored so much to bestow
that benefit upon us. And upon this we are to insist, as long as it shall
endure, though it be the whole time of our Prayer.

This is a very important advise, and for such is left by our B. F. Ignatius in
his book of Exercises, where (...) says: That having found the ^^^ling and
devotion we desire, we (...) to rest and stay there, without an^^^ety or care
to pass any further, (...) we be satisfied. For this is the end which we
pretend and aim at; this (...) fruit we are to reap therein; and ^hall^ this
is the mark and scope, ^herunto we are to direct all the me^tations,
considerations, and discourses (...) our Understanding.

Neither is it necessary that be^^use we have provided two or three ^oints,
therefore all must needs be run ^her in our Meditation: for the nu^^^er and
variety of points are set down ^ast matter of discourse be wanting, and that
if we should be dry and little ^^oued with the consideration of a^y one point or
mystery wherein we ^editate, we may pass to another.

And if, notwithstanding this, it ^^ance that we find our Will not to (...)
moved, all the time being spent ^ith passing from one consideration (...)
another, let us not therefore afflict and disquiet our selves: seeing the will
of Almighty God heerin is fulfilled, which is the principal end we are to
pretend in Prayer, and not ou^ own gust and consolation.

THE X. ADVERTISMENT.
How profitable a thing it is to repeat one and the self same thing once, or
oftener.

IT is a matter of special moment, in the consideration of the divine
mysteries which in this book we have briefly set down, not to pass over any
of them in have or slightly, as has been said, but by leisure, staying in
one and the same point, thereby to ponder it thoroughly. For one Mystery thus
well considered, will profit us more then many superficially passed over.

Of this our Lord and Savior Jesus has given us example, who in his Prayer in
the garden, taught this manner of Prayer and perseverance in one, and the same
thing. For not content to have prayed once unto his Eternal Father, he
repeateth the ^^me the second, and third time: ^^ea and the holy Evangelist
adds ^^at toward the end, longer then be^^re.

And for this, our B. F. S. Ignatius (...) his Book of Spiritual Exercises,
^oth make so great account of the re^etitions, which after every Exer^^se once,
or twice he ordains to be ^ade; for that which at the first is ^ot found, may
be afterward found ^y repetition of the same. And so our lord himself
affirms: He that see^eth finds, and to him that knoc^eth, it shall be opened.
So it happened unto that woman of Chanaan, who ^or her perseverance in renewing
often ^er petition unto our Savior, ob^ained of his Divine Majesty the de^^red
health for her daughter. So also (...) will happen with us in Prayer, that
^eturning thereunto once, or more ^ften if need require, and for several ^ayes
renewing and perseuering in ^he same consideration, we come to ^iscouer
morevnknown grounds or (...) to say better) more heavenly miste^ies not known
to us before. Much like as entering into a dark chamber at the beginning we see
little or nothing, but staying there a while w^^ come to see that, which we
could not see before.

THE XI. ADVERTISMENT.
How we are to begin our Prayer.

This is (generally speaking of all those who give themselves to the practice
of this holy Exercise) that in the beginning and entrance thereof they always
make for the space of an Aue MARIA, the Prayer commonly called Preparatory,
which is as it were a preparation to begin Prayer, saying thus:

I beseech thee O Lord, to direct this hour, or time of Prayer, to thy greater
glory; bestowing upon me such plenty of thy grace, as shall be necessary to
perform it: and I humbly offer up unto thy Divine Majesty whatsoeue^ I shall
think, say, or do, according to thy holy will, and as it shall be most pleasing
unto thee.

THE XII. ADVERTISMENT.
How the Powers of our Soul are to be exercised in Prayer.

MENTAL Prayer, whereof here we treat, is the work of the three Powers of
the ^oule: to wit, of the Memory, Vn^erstanding, and Will. Noting by ^he way,
that in every Mystery* and point we take in hand, of all the Me^itations of the
books following, we ^re to exercise these three powers in Prayer, in manner
following.

First with the Memory, we ^re to call to mind Almighty God our Lord, with
whom we speak, set^ing before our eyes the point or Mystery on which we are
to medi^ate, believing with a lively faith the truth thereof.

Secondly with the Vnderstan^ing, we are to discourse and consi^er those things
which best may help (...) move the Will, pondering and as (...) were chewing
them again and a^aine by leisure, to the end we may find our selves moved with
the virtue and fruit included therein. For that which is not well chewed, is
neither bitter nor sweet: and so ney there Sin, nor Death, nor Judgment, nor
Hell it self, is bitter or loathsome unto the sinner, because he does not
ruminate and chew these things, but swalloweth them whole, running them over
rashly, without any mature consideration at all, and little to his profit.

Hence it is also, that we take no gust, nor have any feeling in the Mysteries
of the Incarnation, Passion, and Resurrection of Christ: because we do not
thoroughly ruminate and chew them. Let us therefore bruize and chew with our
Understanding this grain of mustard seed, searching out the precious and
divine virtue which therein is hidden, that is to say, within this holy and
divine Mystery: and we shall see by experience that it does not only heat and
bite us, but also provoke and cause in us tears of devotion.

Thirdly, with the Will, we are ^o draw out of that consideration ^undry
affections, some belonging to ^ur selves, and others to Almighty God: for
example, Detestation of our ^elus in regard of our offenses against God, Sorrow
for our sins, the Love ^f God and his divine Precepts, the ^iuing of thanks
for benefits and fa^ours received, Desires of true and ^olide virtues, and of
imitating Christ jesus our Lord in those which he ex^rcised in his most holy
life: to wit, ^n Charity, Mercy, Humility, Pati^nce, Meeknes, and Poverty, and
so ^n all the rest: Neglect and Contempt ^f all that the world esteems and
^oueth, seeing the small account this ^ur highest Lord made of them in his ^ife
and death: great longing and fer^ent desires to suffer, and shed our ^loud for
his divine honor, ponde^ing with attention and leisure in every Mystery, some
one of these ver^ues, until we imprint and settle in ^ur Will an earnest
desire to obtain (...).

And these be the acts which we ^re to exercise with the power of our Will, in
the consideration of the life and Passion of Jesus Christ our Savior, thereby
to come to the true imitation of his most perfect virtues. And this third of
our Will is the principal, and that wherein we ought to make most stay, as a
thing whereof most reckoning is to be made in Prayer; this being always in our
power to perform, how dry soever we be, or full of desolation. All these, and
the like affections and desires of true and solid virtues, we must put in
practice, so that we may profit our selves in some of them by one Meditation,
and in some by another, according as the matter of Meditation shall require.

THE XIII. ADVERTISMENT.
The fruit which is to be gathered out of Prayer.

IT is a thing of special moment, and which makes much to the purpose, that
before we begin our Prayer, we forsee and know the fruit which we ought to
gather thereof. For it is to be presupposed, that we ^o to seek remedy for our
spiritual ^ecessities, to obtain victory of our ^assions, and perverse
inclinations, (...) procure sorrow for our sins, to ^^ote out vices, to plant
virtues, to ^^bdue all difficulties which may oc^urre in the way of virtue,
weighing ^^rst with our selves: and very seriou^^y, what is the greatest
spiritual ne^essity we have, what is that which ^indereth most our progress
in ver^^e, and that which assaulteth most ^ur soul. And this is that we ought
^articulerly to forethinke, and have in ^readinesse, therein to insist, and to
^btaine that our desire in Prayer. ^s if we find our selves to want the ^ertue
of patience, thither to direct ^ur considerations, for the attayning ^f a true
desire to suffer and endure ^r the love of God things painful, and contray to
our liking. If our ^hiefest want be Charity, then to ^ake firm purposes, to
show our ^^lues affable, courteous, and sweet unto our neighbors, not to
contri^ate, or do them any harm, but rather all the good we can etc.

For it were a great folly and deceit for one when he goes to prav, to lay
hand upon that which first offers it self, and not that whereof he has most
need. For we see the sick person going to the Apothecaries shop, does not so,
but makes choice of that which is most to the purpose for the curing of his
infirmity. So we see that blind man in the Gospel to have done, who went to
our Savior, crying and beseeching him to have mercy on him, whom when our
Lord asked, what he would have him to do unto him, he forhwith represented unto
him his greatest necessity, and that wherein he received most affliction, which
was the want of sight, and of this therefore he craves remedy. So that we see,
he did not demannd any other^thing, whereof he had also need. for he did not
say, Lord, Bestow a garment on me, for I am poor: give me necessaries to
maintain me for I am in need: these things he did nor beg, but all the rest
omitted, he imploreth remedy for his greatest necessity.

After this manner we see the holy Prophet David to have done, for he directed
his Prayers to obtain that which he desired, and had most ^eed off, and so he
says in one of his ^psalmes: One thing I have asked of our Lord, this will I
seek for, and procure until I obtain it. Even so we ought to do in our
Prayers to Almighty God, insisting and perseuering therein until we obtain.
And having once prevailed against that vice, pas^ion, or bad inclination which
did most ^fflict and molest us, then are we to ^all in hand with another, and
thus in ^ime we shall subdue and cut off the ^eads of them all with the sharp
and ^iercing sword of Prayer.

But here it seems unto me that some will doubt and say: How is ^t possible
for me to apply this point of Prayer, and mystery which I medi^ate, and wherein
the charity of Christ and his love toward me does most ^ppeare, and wherein
his greatness and goodness is most apparent, to ^he necessity I have of
humility, pati^nce, purity, and other virtues: And how (when thinking on the
glorious mysteries of Christ) can I have sorrow for my sins, and in his
dolorous and painful passage, joy, and spiritual contentment? Whereto I
answer two things: the first, that it cannot be denied, but that some
Mysteries are more to the purpose then others, to gather the fruit of some
virtues more then they be for others. Let us put an example: In the birth of
the child Jesus, who doubts but that the humility and poverty which Christ
there did practice and experience in his own person, do shine most bright, and
are most eminent in that mystery. In the crowning with thorns, the contempt of
worldly honor. In the whipping at the pillar, the mortification of the flesh:
and in the mystery of the Cross, the humility, patience, and obedience which
Christ exercised, suffering himself to be nailed thereunto.

The second thing is, and that of much importance to be known, that upon
whatsoever point or mystery we meditate, we may apply it to ^he virtues we have
most need of, and (...) most for our purpose; for that the ^onsideration of
every one of them is (...) certain divine Manna, which tast^th to every one
according to his desire. If we will that it taste of humility, ^hen of humility
the consideration of ^innes, of hell, and of death will savor and taste. If of
patience, and the love ^f God, hereof the Passion and Re^ection of Christ will
taste, being every where full of motives for the one, (...) incitements to the
other. If of po^^erty and mortification of the flesh, and so of all the rest,
the most holy ^fe of our Lord Jesus will affoard us ^atter for our spiritual
gust in each ^ne abundantly. But let us see the ^ractise of this, declaring it
by some ^ew examples.

Put the case we meditate upon ^ome part of the Passion, and Pains ^f our
Savior, and would draw ther^ut desire and affection of joy and ^pirituall
gladness: Consider to this and, and reflect upon the exceeding ^reat glory and
praise which through ^^ese pains and ignominies did arise unto God both in
heaven and earth, and the infinite good of grace and glory which by means of
the sufferings and labors of Christ, were purchased for mankind; and heerat we
may rejoice, therein fulfilling the counsel of the Apostle: Rejoice in our
Lord always.

If we meditate upon the glorious Resurrection of Christ our Lord, and desire
to have sorrovv for our sins; Consider that this our Lord does therefore rise
again, to bestow on us the life of grace, delivering us from the death of
sin; and by the beauty of the glorious life which he promises in this
spiritual Resurrection, we may gather the lothsomnesse and deformity of the
death of sin, from which, by his death, he delivered us. And thus we may
move our selves to abhor and detest a thing so ugly as sin is, and to love
and embrace the beauty and seemlinesse of grace.

If meditating on the Ascension of our Sau^our, we desire to reap the fruit of
patience, let us see how well (...) eternal Father rewarded his most (...)
Son, for the pains he suffered (...) his love, that we may like wise ^^ue
patience in ours.

Finally, if thinking upon the ^^ost holy life of Christ, we would be ^^ued to
the contempt of the world: ^hold the little reckoning he made the honors and
vain estimation ^^^erof, and that the glory which ought be esteemed, is the
Eternal, which ^^^rist our Lord has and does com^unicate unto his.

But now, all this supposed ^^ich has bin said, that which here^^maketh most
for our purpose, is, (...) light and direction of the holy ^^ost, who in what
mystery soever (...) shall meditate, will best suggest (...) grant unto us the
feeling of the ^^rtue we most pretend, and which it ^^houeth us most to seek
for, and (...) obtain at his holy hands.

THE XIIII. ADVERTISMENT*
Of Iaculatory Prayers to be made (...) in, and out of Meditation.

IT is a very good remedy to exe^^cise and stir up the soul that pray^eth, as
well in time of distractio^^ and dri^esse in meditation, as to co^serue
devotion in the rest of the day, to walk always as in the presence of
Almighty God, and no less^ for such as have not health to pray (...) medi^ate,
to use some short paye^^ or iaculatory aspiratio^s, which are (...) if one
should cast a dart or shoot (...) arrow of seruent affection unto he^^uen,
craving of Almighty God (...) few words his divine love, his gra^^ or some
virtue whereof he standet^ most in need: and as it were represe^ting and laying
before his majesty his own weakness, asking humbl^ remedy thereof, or victory
over som^^ vice, from which he most desires (...) be freed. The practice of
these sho^^ prayers, is as solloweth.

^ my God, that I could always ^e thee!

^ that I could perfectly obey thee!

^ that I could alvvaies serve thee!

^ that I never had offended thee!

^^at I could see my self free from (...), or that imperfection!

^ that I could obtain this or that ^^^ellent virtue!

Give me o Lord, purity of soul,

^^^nility of heart, poverty of spirit.

Pardon my sins, O my Rede^^^, for they are many, and have (...) on me.

^ King of heaven, and beauty of ^^gels, how late is it that I come to
^^vvthee.

O Lord that I knew thee and knevv (...) self!

^ermit not, o Lord, that ever I be ^rated from thee.

Grant me, O my Strengh, my (...), my spouse, that I may entierly (...) thee.

Give me, O Lord, grace alvvaies ^erseuere in virtue and to do vvor^^^ penance
for my sins.

This manner of Prayer is brief and easy for all, and from whence gathered
much spiritual profit bei^^ done with affection, and devotion as holy King
David did, who ha^^ left the same written, and iterated ^^ny times in his
Psalms.

Of this example, those holy Mo^^kes of Egypt made their benefit, whom S.
Basil and Cassian affir^ that wilest they labored with the hands, they did
also pray most (...) of the day. Wherefore if we also (...) accustom our
selves to this holy ^^^^rcise, we shall perform that con^^nuall Prayer, which
our Sauiour^ quireth in the Gospel, where says by Saint Luke: It be houeth
always to pray, and not to be wea^^ For what better Prayer may there then to
be always desiring the great honor of Almighty God, and (...) ways conforming
our Will with will, having no other will nor nill^ the will or nill of Almighty
God. (...) is (as Saint Paul says) to begin to Citizens of the Saints, and
the ^^mesticall people of God. This is (...) be as were those happy men who^ ^.
John did see, and says of them: ^hey had the name of God written (...) their
forehead, which is the conti^ual memory and presence of God. For ^^eir
conversation now is not in earth ^ut in heaven. And to the end that (...) also,
may be so, and in such mea^^re as in this life we can perform, (...) us make
use of these Iaculatory ^rayers, and aspirations, in our me^^tations, and in
other times of the (...), yea and in the midst of our ^^cupations and business.

Neither is it to be understood, ^^at all those before set down are (...) to
be used, but whatsoever o^ers like unto them, yea and such are ^ont to be
better and of more efficacy, which moved by God we conceive (...) frame by our
selves, although ^^th words less proper, and not so ^ell ordered. And be
assured that by ^is compendious and short way. ^^th easy and profitable, in
time we ^ay attain unto great sanctity of (...).

THE XV. ADVERTISMENT*
Of the speech, or Colloquy which is (...) be made at the end of Prayer.

THE Holy Ghost says in the Book of Ecclesiastes, that the end of Prayer is
better th^^ the beginning. And the reason is, for that then the heart is
supposed to (...) inflamed with meditation, and (...) soul moved, taught, and
eleuate with the light, and heavenly wisdom communicated unto her by God (...)
Prayer; so as then is the proper tim^ of Colloquy to speak and conue^^
familiarly with God, and the time al^^ of petition, and request of that what
(...) desire. And the said Colloquies (...) to be made according to the matt^^
which then we have meditated, spe^^^ king some times mentally, sometim^
vocally, with the eternal Father, (...) with his most holy Son Jesus.

For example, If the matter of meditation has been ioyfu^ let us rejoice with
the eternal Fath^^ giving him thanks for that by (...) ^eanes and merits of
such a Son ^e has communicated unto us such ^aces, favors, and benefits. If
it be (...) the pains and troubles of the Son (...) Almighty God, we ought to
grieve (...) have Compassion, because he (...) sustained such and so great
affli^ions for so vile and base creatures (...) we are. And after this manner
con^rmably unto the matter, the said ^^each or Colloquy is to be made, and ^ere
with conclude our Prayer for ^at time.

This is likewise the time to ask not ^nly for our selves but for others also
(...) whom we have obligation, whose (...), health, and salvation we desire,
^eseeching our Lord, to grant them is grace and love, that they may live ^^nd
dye therein. This is the time to ^ke for the peace, increase, and con^ruation
of the Church, and for ^^ose which be in mortal sin, that God will please to
have mercy on ^^em, and bring them to a better state. ^inally this is the time
to commend into Almighty God all those which ^^emember us, and have commended
themselves unto our Prayers.

THE XVII. ADVERTISMENT.
Of the care in observing these Aduertisments, and of the purity of conscience
requisite for Prayer.

HE that begins to use mental Prayer, ought not to afflict^ and discomfort
himself in respect that the Aduertisments and Rul^ we have here prescribed
for the better practicing of mental Prayer be so many and diverse: for it is
clear that as the soul entering into the body, of it self is sufficient to
inform, animate, and quicken all the members, exercising therein all the
offices and functions of life, notwithstanding they be many and sundry: even so
the grace of the Holy Ghost entering into a soul, is alone sufficient to make
it perform all the offices of (...) spiritual life. For by Prayer, out
Understanding is illuminated; Prayer instructs and teaches us whatsoever we
have to do. Prayer moves the will, with all the interior facultyes which
depend thereon: Prayer ^^ally does facilitate and make easy ^hatsoeuer
difficulties do, or may ^^cure in this holy Exercise, making (...) way so
plain and easy, that we ^eed not fear them.

But if perchance it should hap^en, that setting our selves to Prayer (...)
forget to observe this order, or ^^isse in some of these Aduises, and ^^^les.
As for example, if we forget to ^ake in the beginning those three ^umiliations
aforesaid, or to make (...) Preparatory Prayer, and to put ^ur selves in
presence of God etc. ^^t us not therefore trouble and dis^uiet our selves, for
our intentions etc ^ndeauour only was, and is, to teach ^uery one that which is
best and most ^rofitable: which supposed, albeit ^e sometimes miss in one
thing or other, we do not therefore loose the ^^uit of our Prayer: for the
infinite ^oodnes and liberality of God is not ^yed to these rules, neither will
he therefore omit to visit us with his di^ine grace.

And whereas one of the things which is chiefly required in Prayer, is the
purity of Conscience, whereof Almighty God speaking by S. Matthew said: Blessed
are the clean of heart, for they shall see God. Therefore is it certain, that
how much the more any shall purify, and cleanse themselves, so much the more
they shall see and enjoy him. And because this purity of Conscience is by no
other way better gotten, and preserved, then by the daily examination of the
same, together with the act of of contrition: I have thought good to set down
in this place the manner of performing it every night for the space of a
quarter of an hour before we go to rest: and this done we are to prepare our
selves for the meditation of the day following, by reading the point, or points
of the Exercise.

THE EXAMEN OF our Conscience.
THE examen of our Conscience that it may be done well, must consist in the
five points following here briefly declared. The first (...), to give thanks
unto Almighty ^od for the benefits received at his ^ost liberal hand; to wit,
for that he ^ath created, redeemed, and conser^ed us, and has made us
Christians: and chiefly for those which he has ^one unto us in particular, for
which (...) owe unto such a most liberal lord special gratitiude.

The second is, to ask of his di^^ne Majesty light and grace, to know (...)
amend the faults committed a^inst him that day.

The third is, to bethink our ^^^ues, and diligently to examine from ^^ure to
hour, since the morning (...) did rise, until that present time, (...) our
thoughts, words, and deeds, that we have done, spoken, or has ^^^ssed in our
mind.

The fourth is, to render hearty ^ankes unto God our Lord for all (...) good
which we shall perceive to ^ue done, not attributing unto our ^^^ues (being so
bad as we are) any ^^od thing of those which we have one, but unto God who
moved us to do them.

The fifth and last is, to be sorry with all our heart for the offenses we shall
discover in our selves, committed against so good a Lord, craving pardon for
them. And so finally (firmly proposing through the assistance of his divine
grace to amend) let us repeat this Act of Contrition to obtain pardon for our
sins.

O my Lord Jesus Christ, true Go^ and Man, my Creator and Redeemer, thou being
whom thou art, and for that I love thee above all things; I am sorry with all
my heart that I have offended thee. And here I firmly purpose never to sin
any more, and to avoid all occasions of offending thee: as also purpose to
confess and fulfill the penance enjoined m^ for the same. And in satisfaction
ther^ of, I offer up unto thee thine own^ sacred Passion, the merits of thy
(...) Mother the Virgin Mary, and of all the Saints, and all my works, labors
and pains, yea and my whole life* And I trust in thy infinite goodness (...)
mercy, that by the merits of thy mo^^ ^recious Blood and Passion, thou ^ilt
forgive me all my sins, and ^estow upon me such plenty of thy ^race, as there
with I may be able to ^^ead a holy life, and perfectly to serve ^hee unto the
end.

Thus we are to make our Exa^en with all care and diligence every ^ight; the
good and manifold fruits ^hereof are such and so admirable, ^^at they cannot be
worthily decla^ed. For by this Examen we cut off ^ll culpable ignorance, and
free our ^elues from hidden sins which thence ^o arise, and do that which is in
us ^o know the truth, the which Al^^igty God does also the rather dis^lose unto
us. By this Examen we ^ulfill those Commandments and Counsels of Christ, so
earnestly and ^ften repeated by him in the Ghospel ^aying: Watch and pray,
because you ^now not the day and hour of your ^^eath, nor of your judgment. Be
you ^eady, for that, what hour you ^hinke not, the Son of man will ^ome to
call you unto his divine judgment.

By this Examen we keep watch over our selves, escaping the danger and
obligation of sins past, freeing our selves from those to come. By this we
prepare our soul and conscience for death, though even that night it should
overtake us, and catch us at unawares (a thing very possible and perhaps to
befall us) as it has happened unto many others. And it may happen that one
dying on a sudden, if he had not examined himself well, he had been lost and
condemned for ever, whereas having examined himself with contrition and sorrow
for his sins, he is saved eternally. That heerby we may see how much a
diligent care imports in this business, and withal the great damage which may
befall us, if we neglect to do it every day.

^HE FIRST BOOK OF MEDITATIONS which appertain unto the Purgative Way.
THE PREAMBLE, concerning the three ways, Purgative, Illuminatiue, and Unitive.
BEing now time to begin to set down in this first Book the Meditations, and
Points, which belong to the ^urgatiue Way, it will not be from ^ur purpose,
before we declare in ^articuler what the way Purgative is, (...) say somewhat
in general (for more ^^rspicuity and clearnes sake) of the three Ways: which
done I will tre^^ in the three books following of every one severally.

I say therefore, that as by sinn^ (according as the Prophet I say faith man is
divided and straieth from God, who is his true way and last end; s^ as the
means which he is to use to reunite himself unto him, is called a Path, or
Way: and the returning again, to Move, and to Walk. And even as in every
motion which is made from one place to another, there be three things: first,
The Town and place from whence the traveler departs. Secondly, the place
whither he goes. And thirdly the Motion it self from one place to another:
Even so, in the Motion whereby a Soul, separated from Almighty God, reuniteth
it self with him again, we may consider thre^ other things alike. First the
extreme from whence it parts, which i^ sin, and the evil state which
therein it had. Secondly the place whither it tends, to wit God, to reunite it
self unto him. And thirdly (...) passage from the one (...) the other, ^o wit,
the space which is between ^^ese two extremes, which is neces^ry for the
attaining of the designed and: and this is, that the Vndersta^^ing be
illuminated in the knowledge ^f that good, which is to love, and ^herwith it is
to be united.

And as the wayfaring man ^^^rst is to leave the place where he ^as, and then
to continue going till ^e come to the end of his journey which he pretended: so
in this spiri^^all voyage, the first pace or step, and ^^^rst part of the way,
is to get out of (...) sins in which he was entangled, ^hereby to come to
Almighty God. ^or it he would go forward in the ^ayes, Illuminatiue and
Unitive, that (...), to the height of Contemplation, and divine Perfection, not
passing ^^rst by the Purgative way, exerci^^ng himself in rooting out vices
and ^ad inclinations, it were to go and ^^roceed without any foundation or
^round at all; and so should he al^ayes remain imperfect, as a schol^er that
would pass to higher studies, not having grounded himself sufficiently in the
lower schools, and mount up unto the last, not having passed the first degree.
The way therefore to obtain this good, must be by going first the Purgative
Way; which may be declared as follows.

THE PVRGATIVE WAY.
We call that the Purgative Way, which does purge and purify our soul and
conscience from vices and sins, and does replenish and fill the same with
that purity and cleanes, which is necessary to enter into the celestial
Jerusalem, whither (as S. John says) no polluted thing shall enter. But who
through his manifold sins and abominations, shall find himself polluted and
defiled, must know, that the only means to wash and cleanse himself from the
same here in this life, is duly to consider them, and with abundance of
tears to be sorry for them, together with the remembrance of the good he has
lost, which is God himself, and the present evil which he suffers. Also the
consi^^ration of Death, Judgment, and ^ell: for these and such like
conside^^tions, are included in this first pas^^ge, or Purgative Way, which
ap^^rtaine to beginners, and in which so ^uch time is to be spent by every one
(...) particular as shall seem necessary (...) him, to walk this way with
^^rity and fruit: seeing that some have ^ore sins, and a more soft, and ^^der
heart and conscience, then o^^ers.

Wherefore I remit the young ^^ginner (to the end he go not astray) ^his prudent
and discreet spiritual ^^her, to direct, guide, and instruct (...) in every
thing, according as the ^urse of his life has been more or (...) disordered.
For it were no discre^^^n, to detain one in the exercise of (...) Purgative
Way, longer time the^ ^^necessary, which of it own na^^^e does cause in the
soul servile ^^re, that hinders the perfection. Charity, and unto which
Charity (...) ought to endeavor to attain, in (...) course of a spiritual
life: because (as S. John says) perfect charity expels fear. Wherefore it
seems convenient and reasonable, that having spent in these laudable and holy
exercises sifteene or twenty days, we proceed to the Illuminatiue and Unitive
ways; out of which likewise, motions of Sorrow, Fear and Humility may be
gathered as out of the Purgative. For certain it is, that one will be grieved
more that he has offended Christ our Lord, considering his excellent virtues
of Humility, Patience, Charity and the like then if he should consider his own^
sins, Death, Judgment, and Hell.

And albeit these consideration^ be more proper to those who desir^ of new to
convert themselves to Almighty God, or be but beginners i^ virtue: yet reason
it is, that the iu^^ also to purify themselves the (...) from the sins
present, and withal to make surer the pardon of those which be past, do now
and then (as for exa^pl^ once every year) refresh and rene^ the memory of
these Meditations following the counsel which Ec^^^siasticus does give us,
saying: Be (...) hindered to pray always, and are not to be justified even unto
^ath. And our Savior says: He ^^at is just, let him be justified yet, (...)
let the holy be sanctified yet, in^^easing daily in purity of conscience, (...)
in sanctity of life.

The Meditations following of ^^e Purgative Way will give a good ^^ginning to
this enterprise, in which (...) have thought good and expedient (...) follow
the counsel and opinion of Gregory, and other Saints, who (...), that the
firm and true founda^^^n of a spiritual building, is the ^^owledge of our
selves; and they ^oue it very well: for if one do not ^^st practice himself
in the conside^^tion and knowledge of his own ^^^isery and weakness, he
shall re^aine ignorant and blind, and not ^ow how to ask in Prayer that which
is convenient for him. Wher^^^re I will begin the Meditations (...) this
first Book with this conside^^^ion, which shall be the fundamen^^ll stone of all
this spiritual building whereon the rest must stand. The points and
considerations whereof, have gathered out of diverse placese (...) the holy
Scripture and Saints, an^ for such they are to be estemeed an^ practiced. And
because we all aspi^^ unto virtue and holiness of life, it (...) expedient, that
we also imitate an^ follow the^ this way which they ha^^ showed us.

THE I. MEDITATION.
Of the Knowledge of our selves.

THE Preparatory Prayer pr^supposed (whereof we treat^^ in the eleventh
Aduertisment two things are to be done in eu^^ Meditation contained in this
Man^^ all, to wit, First the Composition place: Secondly the Petition, whi^^
must be always conformable to (...) matter of the Meditation, as in (...) and
the rest of this first Book is said*

Composition of the place.
THE Composition of the place h^ shall be, to behold and consider (...) (...)
eyes of the soul, that the whole ^^mpasse of the earth, in comparison (...)
the heavens and the gratnes thereof, as it were a point or grain of sand: which
being so, what shall thou then (...) before thy God, Creator of the (...)
heaven and earth, in whose pre^^^ce thou art less then nothing?

The Petition.
THE Petition shall be to ask of our Lord God that he communiate unto thee his
divine light, there^^ to know thy own baseness and mi^^y, and knowing it, to
humble thy ^^^fe, and in humility to serve and adore (...) as thy Lord and God:
this done ^^^gin thy Meditation as follows.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider the matter whereof (...) thy body was composed and made, (...)
thou shall find that it was not fra^^ed either of the heavens, or of cri^^all,
neither of the supreme element (...) fire, nor of water, nor of other ^eare,
bright and transparent matter, ^ut of the most vile and base element (...) all,
which is the earth: and hence ^^th thy body his origin and beginning, which God
himself remembered our first Father Adam of, when laying this consideration
before hi^ eyes, he said unto him: Dust tho^ art, and into dust thou shall
return^ Consider thou as much, and tho^ shall receive sight, and knowledge
(...) thy self, as he that was blind from his nativity received sight, whom
Christ our Lord cured both corpoally and spiritually, laying upon hi^ eyes the
clay of earth whereof he wa^ first framed and made.

Ponder, that it is the will of Almighty God, that man be alwaie^ very
careful, and diligent in knowin^ and understanding his own basene^ and
misery: and that he have continually the eyes of his soul fixed upon the earth
whereof he was framed to the end he always keep himself in humility and
subjection: knowin^ that he deserves not to be esteemed and honored, but
rather to be tro^den under foot and trampled upon as is the earth: this being
the only r^^^ medy and mean, to obtain the ve^tue of Humility.

Hence shall thou gather two ^hinges. First, Confusion and shame, ^eeing how
contrary thou have done ^eereto, having ever desired and ta^en pleasure, nor in
submitting and ^umbling, but in extolling, and boa^ing of thy self, as if thou
were ^^mthing: remembering those words ^f the Apostle, If any man esteem
^imselfe to be something, whereas he (...) nothing, he seduceth himself.
Se^ondly, A firm purpose, continually (...) exercise thy self in the base
esteem ^^d acknowledgment of thy self, as ^id S. Augustine, and Saint Francis
^^c. of whom the first was wont to ^y unto God: Lord, Let me know ^^y self
and know thee. The se^ond: Lord, Who art thou, and who ^m I?

THE 2. POINT:
O consider what thy body is whilst (...) it lives, and thou shall find, that
(...) is a sack of earth, a continual flow^^g water of all filth and stench,
and ^^at there is not any part thereof from ^^e sole of the foot, to the crown
(...) the head, without impurity and uncleanness. For which cause Hol^ Job
said, as one who had thoroughly entered into this consideration: I hau^ said to
rottenes, thou art my Father* and to worms, thou art my Mother and sister.

Weigh how much the trees (...) plants of the field do surpass thee (...)
this, for they produce flovvers, leau^^ and very good fruit: thou breede^ and
ingendrest infinite vermin. The trees and plants bring forth wine, oil* and
balm, but thou voydest out (...) thousand imfirmites, and all manne^ of
uncleanness. And what marvel ^ for according as the tree is, so is the fruit:
and an evil tree (like as man (...) cannot yield good fruit.

Of that which has been said ^ thou may gather a great desire (...)
humbling thy self, seeing that the miseries of thy body be so great a^^ so
manifold, beseeching our Lo^^ to open the eyes of thy soul, th^^ from this day
forward, thou cease (...) seek delights and contentments f^^ thy body, which
is so unworthy (...) them; chastising it with rigorous p^^^^nce for what it
has already in^yed.

THE 3. POINT.
^O consider, in what state this ^ thy body shall be, after the se^^ation of thy
soul: hovvsoeue^ ^^autifull and fair it was before, how ^^le and filthy, how
loathsome and ^^ominable it shall then remain.

Ponder, that the cause of al^ ^se domages and evils, will be the ^ence of thy
soul, and into what (...) wretched body shall presently be ^^uerted, to wit,
into worms meat ^o earth, and dust, to be trodden ^^der every man's fee^e.
Whereby ^^u may see wherein all flesh and (...) glory thereof does end, and
what ^ole thou art to pamper thy body ^^milting it to run after all desires,
^^chasing with short and transitory ^^ights, everlasting torments.

Hence thou may stir up in (...) self a great desire of knovving (...) own
misery, and to set before (...) eyes of thy soul, the earth, of ^^ich thy body
was made and in^hich it is again to be resolved. And if this be the port and
haue^ whereat shortly thou and all me^ are to land, after the tempestuous
na^igation of this sea of miseries, it is a matter of no small importance for
the knowledge of thy self; to b^ mindful of what thou art, and wha^ is to
become of thee at last, that s^tting the eyes of due consideration, upon the
feet of this thy proud and haughty Statua made of clay (to wi^^ thy body) thou
humble and submi^ thy self to the very ground: for by ^ow much the higher the
building i^ to be (as Saint Augustine says) for much the lower is the
fouudation to be laid.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider that to know thy self perfectly and thoroughly, tho^ art not to
rest in the knowledge o^ thy body alone, but must pass fu^ther to the
knowledge of thy soule^ pondering first, that albeit in reg^^^ of thy soul
thou might greatly esteem thy self, it being a creatu^^ wholly spiritual,
and like in natu^^ unto the Angels, a lively resem^blance of Almighty God, an
image ^f the most Blessed Trinity, endued ^ith three most perfect powers and
^ne essence, able to understand, love and enjoy infinite goods:
notwith^^anding thou want not wherein to ^umble thy self, if thou call to
mind ^^e foul and loathsome dungeon, ^herein thy soul is imprisoned, the
^^use of clay wherein it is detained ^^d lives: remembering the saying (...)
the Apostle: What have thou, that ^ou have not received? And if thou ^ast
received, what do thou glory, (...) though thou had not recea^ed?

Secondly ponder that before Al^ighty God created thy soul, to ^ut and infuse
it into thy body, it (...) as nothing, nor was of any value, ^^d would
instantly return to the ^^me nothing again if Almighty ^od should not
continually keep and ^nserue it, and* so thou have not ^^ereof to glory, but in
thy miseries ^^d infirmities (as Saint Paul said o^ ^^mselfe) seeing thou art
compassed ^out with innumerable remptations both within and without.

Reap and gather from hence desires, to know and humble thy self, and
acknowledge thy self for less then nothing, perceauing now what thy soul
is, how little it i^ vvorth, and how much reason it has to fear.

The Speech, or Colloquy.
THE Speech, or Colloquy to end the Prayer, is alvvayes to be drawn out o^
the matter of the Meditation: and so we are to do in this and all the rest, as
above we have noted in the fifteenth Aduertisment.

THE II. MEDITATION.
Of Sins.

THE preparatory Prayer shalb^ like unto the first.

The Composition of place shall be, to see with the eyes of thy Understanding,
thy soul shut up and imprisoned in the obscure prison and dungeon of thy body,
and thy self banished into this vale of teare^ and misery, entangled with many
snar^s of sins and temptations.

The petition shall be, to ask of our Lord light, wherewith to know the
grieuousnes of sin to abhor and be wail it, and the terriblenes of Gods
justice in chastising it with everlasting pain and tormen^s.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider the chastisment* which Almighty God showed upon the Angels for one
only sin, and that only in thought, committed against his divine Majesty, in
matter of Presumption and Pride: depriving them in an instant of that supreme
and high dignity wherein he had created them, and throwing them like
thunderbolts from the highest heaven in the lowest hell, without respect either
to the beauty of their Nature, or to the greatness of their estate, or that they
were his creatur^ made according to his image and likeness,

Ponder, bow great and evil Mortal sin is, seeing that only one was enough
to obscure and defile so (...) beauty of the Angels, Almighty God permitting
the same, to the end that men should fear and tremble to live but one hour in
mortal sin: knowing, that if God spared not the Angels, being notwithstanding
so noble and excellent creatures, how much less will he pardon men, being so
vile and base as they are.

Hence raise in thy self ferue^^ desires of contrition, together with a great
detestation of thy sins committed against Almighty God, firmly purposing
from this day forward rather to dye a thousand deathes^ then ever to commit one
mo^tall ^inne: for whatsoever can be suffered in this life, is less without
comparison, then the pain due to one only sin, which was sufficient to make
of a beautiful Angel, a most foul and ugly Devil.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider who was the author of this most grievous evil of sin, and thou
shall find it to be Man, (...) vile and abject creature, who being so much
obliged to serve and love his Creator and Lord, for so many and so iunumerable
benefits received from his divine and most liberal hand, to wi^, his Creation,
Conservation, Vocation, and Redemption, forgetting all this, has only been
mindful to despise and offend, with his manifold sins, his Lord and God.

Ponder whence it proceeds, that so vile a worm and so wretched a creature
as thou art, has been so bold as to offend the infinite Majesty of thy
Creator, before whom the most highest Saints do tremble; and thou shall find
that it is thy presumption and pride, and want of Humility, which makes thee
to stumble and fall, not permitting thee to understand that to sin, is worse
then not to be at all, and that, it had been better not to have been borne,
then to have sinned, as our Savior said speaking of Judas For it is certain^
that there is no place so base and conte^ptible in the sight of God, among
either things created, or not created, as is man who is in mortal sin.

Gather hence a great desire (...) be despised and contemned of men, for that
with thy sins thou have dishonored and contemned Almighty God: and do sharp
penance for them, thereby to incline thy Savior to pardon thee, beseeching
him, th^^ seeing he has not been wearyed in suffering for thee, he will
vouchsafe to pardon thee, restoring thee again^ to gis grace and friendship.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider, how much the Son of Almighty God does abhor^e and detest sin,
for that loving and esteeming so much his life (as it w^^ reason, that so just
and holy a life a^ his should be loved and esteemed,) did choose nevertheless to
loose and spend it, to destroy this bloody and cruel best Sin, feeling more
ou^ faults, then his own pains.

Ponder, that if sin cost Almighty God so much (in that for to destroy the
same, he embraced the Cross, offering on it his most precious blood and life,
in satisfaction of ^^nne) how art thou so blind and foo^^sh, that thou will
needs love and ^steeme a thing so abominable unto God? How art thou so
besotted, ^s to choose death it self? How so ^old and foole-hardy, as to
ad^enture the committing of a mortal ^^nne, it having cost God himself so
^igh a price? And if this be true (as (...) is) is it not a madness incredible,
to ^elieue with faith what thou belie^est, and to live in manner as thou ^uest?
That is to say, to believe that ^nne is so bad and detestable, and euertheles
to commit the same so ^^peratly? to believe that God is so ^od, and
notwithstanding to offend ^^m?

Hence thou shall gather a great ^islike and detestation of sin, see^^g that
for the curing thereof, hum^ ^eanes did not suffice, but divine a^ne. And know,
that he who com^itteth it, as much as lies in him ^s S. Paul says) does
crucify again ^^e Son of God.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider, the innumerable souls (...) that be now burning in hell for one
only sin which they commi^ted. Where ponder first, how all those damned
so^les were men a^ thou art, and many of them Christians, and were perhaps
sometimes highly in the favor of Almighty God, but by little and little they
gre^ careless, and came to fall into tha^ miserable estate, and by the just
judgments of God, death ouertooke th^^ therein, and so were they most justly
condemned for all eternity.

Secondly, with how much more reason thou deseruest to be i^ Hell, as those
souls are, for hauin^ offended God, in that very kind o^ sin, not once, but
many times: and how just reason there was that death should have caugh^ thee in
commi^ting the first sin, and that God should have given the^ no time o^
repentance.

Hence thou shall gather desir^^ and affections of love and gratitud^ toward
Almighty God for the f^uours and benefits done unto thee in delivering thee
from the dang^^ before thou did fall into it. Al^^ fervent desires of doing
satisfaction for thy offenses in this life, lame^ting and bewayling them.

THE III. MEDITATION.
Of Death.

THe Preparatory Prayer as before. The Composition of place shallbe, to imagine
the King of heaven seated on his Royal throne, dispatching thence his Judges,
Sergeants, Apparitors, and other his Officers to deprive of their lives all
those that are to dye. Suppose that the last day of thy life is now come, and
that this is the last hour thereof, and that thou preparest thy self for the
final account.

The Petition shall be to beseech our Lo^d to open the eyes of thy soul, giving
thee grace To li^e so now, as thou would then wi^h thou had lived: and so
composing and ordering now thy disordered life, that thou may dye a happy
death.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider, how doubtful and uncertain this day and hour of thy death is,
so that thou neither know when, nor in what manne^ it will attach thee. For
that ordinarily when a man is most careless, and thinks least thereof, it
then comes: the divine providence so o^dayning to oblige thee to be always
watchful, expecting this day, and fearing this hour. For as there is nothing
more uncertain then tha^ hour, so thou must believe that nothing is more
certain, then that after health follows sickness; and after life ensues
death.

Ponder, how this Verity is most sure and undoubted, yet tho^ live
nevertheless with so great carelesnes and negligence, not preparing for death,
which daily does threa^en thee. And move here in thy self a great desire to
live well to day as one that is to dye to morrow: for the day wiil ^ome, and
that very quickly, wherein thou shall line to ^ee the morning* but not the
euening^ or the evening but not the morning, and order thy life from this day
forward, in manner as thou would wish to have lived at the hour of thy
death. And if thou would not that death should seize upon thee in the state
in which now thou sta^dest, procure forth with to come out of it: for it is not
good to live in that state, wherein thou would not dye.

THE 2. POINT:
TO consider, of what importance it is (as the holy Ghost says) to have
always in mind the presence of Death, thereby not to sin for ever. For thou
were very unwise, if in a business of so great consequence and importance (as
is always to walk prepared, and armed wit^ his ^oly and wholesome remembrance)
^hou would so much forget thy sel^ ^s to defer it to the very point and
^nstant of thy death: not knowing how, or in what manner thou a^t to dye,
whether suddenly, or by some ^tone thrown at rando^, or by a tile of a house
falling down upon thee, by sword, fire, or water: for doutles thou art not
certain whether (...) sudden and violent death will befall thee, as it has
befallen many others^

Ponder that every sinner whosoever, does deserve to be chastised with this
sudden death, and to perish, and dye therein, as very many have done. Seeing
therefore thou a^^ so great a sinner, how do thou no^ tremble to be but one
hour in mo^tall sin? Why art thou not careful how death may find thee well
or ill prepared? That is, in mortal sin* or in the grace and favor of
Almighty God?

Hence raise in thy self, an earnest desire with a firm purpose and
resolution to do so, and not to be s^ careless, as hitherto thou have bee^ in
this holy exercise of preparing the self for death: it being a bridle for many
evils, and a spur to all kin^ of virtue,

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider that it is a law appointed by Almighty God (as Sai^^ Paul does
testify) to all men once (...) dye, and not twice, or oftener* Whereupon
ensues, that the hurt and damage of an evil death, is irremediable for all
eternity, as likewise the profit of a good death is everlasting.

Ponder, that if it be but only once that thou art to dye, and thereon depends
thy eternal salvation or damnation, how live thou then so carelessly, not
exercising thy self during life, in such manner that thou may dye a happy
death?

Gather hence a great desire to mortify thy self, in whatsoever thou
disordinatly love; be they thy Parents, Brethren, Friends, Honors, riches or
pleasures: seeing thou art to leave and depart from all at thy death. And to
the end thou may feel it the less, procure often to dye in thy life time,
mortifying thy senses and shutting up thy eyes, least they may see that which
is not lawful to be desired for thy salvation, refrayning thy tongue, least it
speak things hurtful to thy Neighbor etc. for so dying, and mortifying thy
self in thy life time, thou shall find Almighty God favorable unto thee at
the hour of thy death.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider, how perplexed and troubled thou vvilt be in that trance and
agony of death, when thou shall see a holy candle lighted a^ thy beds side,
and thy winding shee^ spread upon thy bed, and the standers by calling upon
thee to prepa^^ thy self for death, and to commend thy self with thy heart, if
thou cans^ not with thy mouth, unto the mercy of Almighty God.

Ponder, the terror, anguish, and perplexit^ of mind thou art to feel in that
passage, not so much for that thou art to leave the beloved company and society
of thy body, and other things which thou did willingly enjoy, as for to see
and understand that the dreadful hour of account, and final sentence does
approach, the which shall be according to thy works* either of eternal salvation
or damnation, to enjoy for ever God Almighty, or to burn for all eternit^ in
^ell fire.

Gather hence a great fear and ^errour, calling to mind the insuppor^able
pains and travails that thy ^ody and soul are to endure in the ^oure of
death, and withal a lively ^esire never more to forget the same ^hylest thou
live. Reprehend and ^ondem^e thy carelessenes: demand ^ften times of thy
self, How, if I ^eane to dye well, do I not live well? for it is a Law common
and ordina^y, that he that lives well, dies ^ell, and he that lives ill,
dies also (...). Crave of thy Blessed Savior, ^^at by his most holy death, he
will ^ouchsafe to give thee also a good and ^appy passage.

^HE IIII. MEDITATION.
Of the particular Judgment.

THE Preparatory Prayer as before. The composition of place shall be, to imagine
Christ our ^uiour as the sovereign Judge, sea^d one a Throne of Majesty ready
to ^dge thy soul, which is accompa^ed with thy good and bad deede^* and that
on either side of thee stand thy good and bad Angel, expecting whose prey thou
shall be.

The Petition shall be to beseec^ our Lord God, that he will vouch^as^ to show
thee his goodness and cleme^cy, using toward thee not Justice, b^^ Merc^, seeing
he is (as S. Paul ^ai^^) the Father of Mercies.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider the time and place^ wherein the particular Iudgmen^ of every one
is to be, to wit, the ver^ instant of death, at the point when the soul shall
leave the body de^^ poiled of all the good it had, and (...) that very time and
moment the who^^ judgment shall be concluded, the se^^ tence given and executed.

Ponder, how much it beho^ ^eth thee to have always before (...) eyes this
hour and moment, (...) which is to be a beginning of thy (...) ternall good,
or evil. For in eue^^ moment of these thou may merit^^ deme^i^ either life
or death, which to endure for ever. The place of (...) judgment shall be
wheresoever de^^ shall first arrest thee, on the land, or ^n the sea, in thy
chamber, or in the ^treet, in thy bed, or on the way: for ^s this sovereign
Judge has power and jurisdiction in every place, so in ^ll places he has this
Tribunal, and ^^aketh his judgment: that in every ^lace thou may fear,
because thou ^nowest not whether that shall be the ^lace of the Judgment. Out of
which ^ou art to draw a great fear of of^nding God in any place where he ^ay
judge thee.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider, the most rigorous examen whereunto the Judge shall ^ll thee,
seeing it to be universal ^f all things whatsoever, charging ^^ee withal thy
sins, of deeds, ^ords, and thoughts, even of those which thou have idly done
or spoken, ^^ough thou should have quite for^^tten them: and this accusation
shall (...) so clear and evident, as no manner (...) doubt may be made
thereof. See^^g therefore thy self compassed about ^ith so many anguishes and
straits, that can thou do but say with the Prophet: The panges of death hau^
environed me, and the sorrows o^ hell have compassed me round about

Ponder, the affliction, pain, ^ sorrow wherein thy poor soul sha^^ find it
selfc at so strait and rigoro^^ an examination, in which it is to gi^^ an
account of whatsoever it h^^^ fraudulenty taken, even of a pin, (...) ^agge of
a point. There thou shalt^^ asked account of thy life, thy good^ and family, of
the inspirations (...) God, and above all, of the most pr^^cious blood of
Christ, and use of the holy Sacraments.

Gather hence a great des^^^ from this day forward to exami^^ thy conscience
with the greatest (...) uerity thou can, chastising thy se^^^ rigorously for
the faults thou ^h^ find, though the^ seem but little^ since he that is
afterward to exami^^ and judge thee, is God, who ^ee^ more then thou art able
to see. B^^ seech him, that he will not enter in^^ judgment with thee, because
no^ living (as his holy Prophet testify (...) ^halbe justified in his sight.

THE 3. POINT.
^O consider, how sad and sorow^full thy soul will be at the de^^ting from thy
body, into which ^^d has infused it, and wherewith it (...) lived in so strait
a band of love (...) amity: for it shall be scarce out ^^he body, when as
troops of di^^ls will straight encounter it, (...) it forth with to appear in
iud^^nt, before the tribunal seat o^ ^^d.

Ponder, the terrors and fears ^^ich then will be set it on every side, ^^w
then it shall feel true sorrovv (...) pains, which in comparison of ^^^se it
has sustained in this life, ^^ough otherwise great, shall seem (...) were
painted. What grief shall ^aue, when it shall perceive that ^^^re is no^more
appealing from the ^^all sentence which the supreme ^ge shall pronounce? How
will it ^^e to know whether it be in God^ ^^our or no? For of the sins i^ ^^h
committed, it is certain, but (...) of true repentance for them. And ^^en the
mercy of God should leave thee, what would thou do (poor silly soul)
environed with so many ravenous wolves, desirous to swa^low thee up at one
morsel?

Hence raise in thy self a great desire, to gain by some special se^uice and
endeavor the friendship o^ thy judge, and to fulfill in all things his most
holy will, obeying him, re^pecting him, fearing him, and most heartily loving
him, and finally representing unto him his manifold merits, that thereby, and by
thine own good works, the sentence may b^ given, not against thee, but in t^^
favor: for thereon depends the eternal weal or woe.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider, how strait the Process of this judgment shalbe^ how upright the
judge, how bus^ and sollicitous thy accusers, how fe^ thy patrons and
defenders. For the^ those things which most thou love and for which thou
did most, an^ which as it seems should most assist and aid thee, will no^
only not help thee, but rather will entangl^ ^^d put thee in greater straits.

Ponder how that thing which ^^e Absalom did most love and e^^eme, to wit, his
hair (as the Holy ^^ipture recounteth) Almighty God (...) just judgment
ordained to be the ^se and instrument of his death: ^^en so it will befall thee
if thou be ^^d, that the things which in thy (...) time thou most regardedst,
and ^inducement whereof thou offen^dst God, the very same will then ^^ad most
stiffly against thee, and ^^ke thy case more doubtful, and ^^se thee greater
torment: so thy gods, honors, delights and plea^^^es which were thy Idols in
thy (...) time, shall there be executioner^ (...) shall torment thee most
cruelly, ^^^ing a means of thy perdition.

Gather hence a great desire ^^t God will please to illuminate ^^ne eyes, that
thou sleep not in ^^th at any time, and least thine ^^my say: I have prevailed
against (...). Beseech Christ our Savior, a^ ^is a most merciful Judge, tha^
^^en he shall come to judge, he condemn thee not, nor deliver thee into the
bloody claws of those most fierce lions, which rage for hunger, and are at all
times ready to denou^e thee.

THE V. MEDITATION.
Of the body after death.

THE Prepatory Prayer as the first. The composition of place shall be to behold
thy self with the eyes of thy soul, dead and shrouded in a sheet, lying in
some Hall or chamber upon a cloth o^ couerlet, alone without company, thy body
covered with a black^ hearse, and thereon a Crucifixe lying* with two candles
on either side.

The Petition shall be to ask^ light of our Lord to make no reckoning at all of
whatsoever is in this life* but only of his grace.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider, how thy body as soon^ as thou have given up thy Ghost, will
remain without life, sense, or ^otion, like unto a block, all pale,
disfigured, foul, cold, horrible, and ^^king, and finally in such a shape ^
every one will fly from it.

Ponder, what is the end of all ^^auty, estimation, honor, and de^^ht of the
flesh, and how little what^^uer thou have enjoyed hitherto, (...) then pleasure
thee: for he who ^^ttle before pleased the eye of the ^^older with his beauty
and come^^es, now causes horror and dread ^^to all that look upon him.

Procure hence a great desire of ^^stising thy said body, and morti^^ng thy
self: for pamper it never ^^uch, yet will it still remain flesh, (...) what
is flesh, but (as says the (...) Prophet Isay) a little gras^e? ^ ^^at is the
glory thereof, but as the ^^wer of the field, that fade^th and ^^ereth away
with a blast? And ^^^ng that this thou art* and in this ^^^u art to end, it
behooves thee to ^^y thy self as one dead to the ^^ld, and to all that is
flesh and blood.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider, how thy body shall ^^e part this world bound hand and foot, not
richely adorned with go^^geous and precious garments, b^^clad in a poor
shroud, made of (...) old sheet, or some rent and pach^^^ bit: the house,
chamber, and (...) that they will allot it, shall be the (...) earth, and a
narrow pit of seven (...) long, and three foot broad, and (...) this it shall,
and must rest content^^ who through mere vanity and p^^^ (as another Alexander
the great) (...) whole world could scarce conta^^ before.

Ponder, how the hard gro^^ shall succeed in place of a soft (...) a poor
shroud in lieu of precious^rich apparel, stench and rott^^ for the fragrant
smells and swee^ dours, worms for delicacies (...) pleasures, who shall gnaw
and (...) sum that belly which before (...) heldest for thy God.

Re^pe hence great confusion shame for thy vanity and sensu^^ in desiring
costly apparel soft ^^ding, and large habitation, enco^^ging thy self to
mortify thy (...) great lauishenes h^erin, and be^^^ ^^^ntly whatsoever want
of these ^^ings, or whatsoever is not such, or (...) good as thou could
wish, since ^^hat thou have? at this present, how ^^lesoeuer it be: is very much
and ^^ry large, compared with that which ^^pecteth thee, and art to have
heer^^er.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider, the journey of thy (...) body toward the grave, and the ^^mpany
that shall carry thee to be ^^ied, how thou shall be borne ^o^ a bear, on
other men's shoulders ^to the Church, some weeping, o^^ers singing.

Ponder first, that he who but ^hile before strutted up and down (...)
streets, looking on every side, and ^^red into the Church, registring e^^ry
thing that passed therein, goe^h ^^w upon other men's feet, blind, ^afe, and
dumb* For then although ^^^u have eyes, ears, and tongue, (...) shall thou
neither, see, hear nor ^ake, because thou art dead.

Ponder secondly, how after (...) Office of the dead being ended, they will
cast thee into thy grave, and cover thee with earth, least the people should
see thy fil^h and putrefaction, where the greatest benefit any friend thou then
have ^ can do thee, shall be to honor thee with casting upon thee a handful
thereof. Why therefore art thou so desirous of abundance in this life, si^h at
that hour so little will content thee?

Hence thou may gather, that thou art not to make any account o^ the vain
honors of this life, but deeply to humble thy self, and in thine own
estimation to put thy self under the feet of all, since thou ^rt to be laid
under the feet of the poor man that shall bury thee, who will not stricke to
trample and tread upon thee, and deal roughly with thee, yea and to bruise thy
head with his spade or mattock. Learn by this not to contemn the poor, and
little ones, seeing in thy death thou shall soon be equal with them.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider thy body in the grave, covered with earth, and upon (...) a heavy
stone, corrupted, consu^^ed, and brought to naught, ye^ ^^ade food for worms,
who before ^idst hunt after all kind of dainty and ^uory morsels, svve^
music, plea^^nt odours, and beautiful aspects: ^^e all this shall be unto
thee, as if it ^^vere not, having lost the instruments and organs whereby thou
might ^^nioy them.

Ponder, what profit rotten ^^ands do now reap of thy riches so ^reedily
sought and hoarded up to^eather? What fruit do thine eyes ^ovv enjoy of all
the vanities which ^hey have beheld? what vvi^ all thy ^elicacies provided for
thy taste then ^^uayle thee? of what continuance ^aue those castles of air
been framed ^n that thy head? what end have all those gusts and pleasures had,
pro^ured by so heinous sins unto thy ^^retched body? And turning the speech
unto thy soul, say: Look and consider well, what will be the and of this
flesh thou now have. Consider whom thou cherishest* ^home thou now adorest:
O miserable wretch that I am, wherefore (...) all these riches, if I am to
become so ^aked here? For what purpose are these deckings and braueries I
being to remain at last so ugly and foule^ To what end are these delicacies
and banquettings, if so soon after I am t^ be food for worms?

Gather hence desires that God our Lord would illuminate and clear the eyes of
thy poor soul with hi^ sovereign light, that it may behold the wretched end
of thy miserable body, and contemn that which is present, at the inward sight
of tha^ which is to come.

THE VI. MEDITATION
Of the General Judgment.

The Preparatory Prayer as the first, The Composition of place shall be, to
imagine a great and spacious field, and therein all the People that have been
from the beginning of the world: in the midst whereof is erected a Tribunal,
or Throne made of a most excellent and ^right shining cloud, and thereon a ^ate
or chair of Estate and Maiest^, ^here Christ our Savior is to sit, and (...)
judge all mankind.

The petition shall be to crau^ ^f Almighty God, grace to apprehend and feel
now, that which thou ar^ ^hen to see, endeavoring, that since ^^ou art one of
those which are to be ^here called, thou may also be of ^he elect.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider, the great and fearful signs, which shall be in all crea^ures at
the day of Judgment. For (...) Christ our Lord says, the Sun ^halbe
darkened, the Moon shalb^ ^urned into blood, the st^rrs shall fall from
heaven, and the sea shall be trou^led. Finally the dread and horror which then
shall possess the hearts of ^en shall be so great, that they shall ^ot find any
place or corner secure ^herein to hide themselves, whereupon they will all wax
pale, dry, and ^ither away for fear, and become (...) it were a lively picture
of death it self.

Ponder, that if when any great tempest does arise on the sea, or any
boisterous whirlwind or earthquake on the land, men fall into a maze, and are
astonished, void and destitute of all strength and counsel, what will they
do when the sea and the air, when heaven and earth shallbe turned vpside
down? Who will have list to eat? who will sleep? who will be able to take one
sole moment of rest amiddest so great perturbation of all things?

Gather hence a great fear of Almighty God, and detestation of thy sins,
that obtaining pardon of them thou may be freed from all these evils, which
are to come as tokens and forerunners of Gods wrath and indignation: and that
he grant thee through his mercy a good and secure conscience, since the day of
thy Redemption does approach, the end of thy labors, and beginning of thy
everlasting repose.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider, how the last day being now come, an Archa^gel with fearful
voice, in manner of a trum^^et, shall summon all the dead to judgment. And in
a moment all, both good and bad, shall rise again ^ith their proper bodies
which they ^ued in here on earth, and come to^eather into the valley of
Iosaphat, ^here to attend the Judge that is to ^^dge them.

Ponder, the sorrows and pains which the damned will feel when ^^eir souls
brought out of hell, shal^^e again coniovned with their bo^ies: what will
they say unto one another, having been Authors and ^auses of each others
torments and ^^iseries? O with what curses will ^^ey vpbraid one another,
being the^ (...) be linked together, to be each others executioners?
Contrar^vvise, ^ow great content shall the soul of ^he just receive at the
good compa^y of the body, which whilst they ^ued together on earth, was a
mean and help whereby she might suffer somewhat for the love of God. O what
vvelcome and blessings will they wish one to another, seeing that the Judge
who is to judge their cause is their Friend, and will now bestow upon them the
crown and reward of their service.

Out of which thou may gather fervent desires and purposes not to live any
more negligently and careless of thy salvation, but comparing that which shall
happen to the good, with what shall b^fall the evil, to choose in this life,
that which most will help thee, to rise again with Christ, to thy everlasting
bliss and happiness.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider, how all being now fulfilled, Christ our Savior shall truly and
really descend from heaven with most sovereign Majesty, environed with an
whole army of Saints and heavenly spirits, and approaching to the before
mentioned Throne, shall command the Angels to separate and divide the good
from the bad.

Ponder, how great the grie^fe and rage of the bad will be, who were so much
honored in this life, when they will see themselu^s on the left hand of God,
in such extremity of baseness, cast off, and set at naught by his divine
Majesty. What inward feeling and sorrow will they have, seeing the just, whole
life they esteemed madness, and their end without honor, accounted now among
the children of God, for to be eternally honored and rewarded. And on the
other side what joy and content will there be among the good, when they shall
see themselves by means of their humility placed on the right hand of Almighty
God, singularly honored and exalted.

Gather heerhence, not to make any account of the right or left hand in this
world, that choosing in this life the lowest place amongst men, thou may
merit in the day of Judgment to sit on high with God and his Angels.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider, how all the sins of the wicked, even of their most hidden and
secret thoughts, and the virtues and good works of the just, being laid open
to the view of the whole world, the Judge will pronounce the sentence. And
beginning with the good, will say* with a gentle and amiable countenance: Come
ye blessed of my Father, possess ye the Kingdom which I have prepared for
you. And to the wicked with an angry and severe look: Depart from me, you
cursed, into fire everlasting.

Ponder, these two contrary ends: he calls the just unto him as if he should
say: Seeing ve^ have imb^aced the Cross, and Mortificatio^ to follow me* come
and receive the reward which is ^ue unto you, and take possession thereof with
eternal rest. And to the wicked he will say* Seeing for your sake I received
these wounds, and have invited you with pardon, and you have not accepted
thereof, refusing to receive me, therefore depart from out of my sight. But
whither, O Savior, do thou ^ast them? To the everlasting torments of Hell.

Hence thou may perceive how much it be^ooueth thee, to re^ard how thou
live, and with what ^are and vigilance thou art to watch ^oer thy self at
all times, seeing all ^hy works, both thy good and bad, ^re to be strictly
examined and iud^ed.

THE VII. MEDITATION.
Of Hell.

THE Preparatory Prayer shallbe as before. The Compositio^ of place shall be, to
imagine in ^he har^ or center of the earth, a huge ^it, and most dark cave,
full of ter^ible fire, where near at hand thou ^ayst behold what passes
amongs^ those innumerable s^ules, which are ^here tormented by the Devil.

The Petition shall be to beseech our Savior, that he will enkindle in thy soul
a great fear, and horror of everlasting pains, that thou may escape so
hideous, and so terrible a place.

THE 1. POINT.
To consider, the dreadfullnes of this pit, and dungeon of Hell, which is all
obscure and full of darkness, whither never entr^^eth any light of the Suune,
and the fire which is there, gives no light at all, but only such as serves
for the greater pain and torment of those who there do^ suffer, being
swallowed up and plunged in most grievous pains and torments.

Ponder how, if thou can not for the space of one only hour, endure the
darkness of a dungeon: if thou dare not touch for a little while the light
fire of a burning candle, how shall thou be able to lie in a bed of perpetual
flames, shut up and compassed round about with those Firebrarnds of hell, both
in soul and body, and that for all eternity?

Gather hence, how great the malice and hey nousnes of one only mortal sin
is: for which Almighty God (being so merciful as he is) does punish so many
souls with so grievous torments, because they refused to suffer something in
this life for their sins, hazarding thereby themselves to sustain so long
and grievous pains in so unfortunate and accursed place.

THE 2. POINT.
To consider the company which these damned souls shall have in that hideous
dungeon. For though they have been Emperors, Kings, and Lords of the World,
yet shall not any one friend of theirs now bewail or lament this their
miserable estate, not any one be found to comfort them, not any vassal or
faithful servant to attend upon them, but their mortal enemies, abhorring,
detesting and raging against them, full of wrath, impatience, and envy. All
these things shall cause new torments and pains unto them, the which shall be
also much augmented and increased with the horrible sight of the Di^ells
themselves.

Ponder, what a torment it will be unto them to live, or rather more truly to
die, amongst such cruel enemies, which long to drink their very blood. How
much more excessive will their pains and griefs be, when they shall perceive
with how small, and short labor they might have escaped so long, and so
intolerable torments, which now they must abide without all hope of the least
refreshing, or ceasing, and in comparison whereof the torments and pains of
this life, seem rather painted, then true torments indeed?

Gather hence a great fear of provoking and enkindling Gods wrath against
thee, and desire to establish^friendship in his love and charity^ loving him
above all things, and maintayning true peace with all me^, that thou may be
delivered from the wicked company of so many reprobate and damne^ persons.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider the grieuousnesse of payns of the senses, wherewith the damned
shallbe tormented: for as the sinner has offended God by all his senses, so
shall he be punished in them all.

Ponder, how the carnal and dishonest eyes shall be tormented with horrible and
dreadful shapes and visions: The ears with woeful lamen^ings, howlings, and
blaphemies against God', and his Saints: The ^melling, with the intolerable
stench that shall proceed from the place it self, and from the bodies of the
dam^ed, a torment not possible to be en^ured: The taste with gall and such ^^ke
better drinks which shall be gi^en them. Finally, they shall have ^eaped upon
them all manner of ^aynes and torments, as of the head, ^he stomach, the
sides, the heart, and (...) other griefs whatsoever are wont (...) torment us
here in this life.

And besides this, upon every ^he of the damned, ^halbe inflicted there
particuier punishments, con^^ary to the vices whereunto they ^aue themsel^es
in their life time. ^he glutton shall be tormented with hungar more then dogs.
The drunkard with insatiable thirst. Thos^ that were over curious in trimming
and setting themselves forth in ^ilkes fine linen and gallantry, shall there
be clothed from top to toe in frying pitch and brimstome, which shall
intollerably torment, but not consume them.

Hence it i^ good, thou raise i^ thy self ^ great courage and vigor of mind
to contemn all the pleasures and delights of this life: seeing they are the
cause of these torments, standing in fear of that sentence which says: As
much as he has gloryed himself, and has been in delicacies, so much give
him torment and mourning.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider that the pain whereof we have hitherto spoken, i^ not the most
terrible of those which the damned are to sustain: for there is another
without comparison greater, which Deuines call, Of loss* and consists i^
being banished for ever from the sight of Almighty God.

Ponder, how that this pain alone shall torment the soul, more then all the
rest together do torment the bodies of the damned: for since God is an
infinite good, and the greatest of all goods, it is manifest that to be deprived
for ever thereof, is an infinite evil, and greatest of all evils. And so every
one shall curs^ his unhappy state and misfortunate birth, gnawing and pulling
in peece^ this own flesh, and renting his very ^bowells, and raging with fury
and ^ancour shall turn himself against Almighty God, not ceasing to curs^ and
blaspheme his holy Nam^, because he tormenteth him, and by hi^ supreme power
and authority, de^ayneth him plunged and ouerwhel^ed in that bottomless pit of
fire, en^losed and shut up on every side, and ^his not for one day, month, or
year ^r age only, but for all eternity.

Here mavst thou move in thy self a great affection and desire to fear^ God,
and abhor thy sins: for by them thou have deserved already t^ (...) cast
into these most grievous pain^ of hell: where many others be for fewer and
lighter sins then those which thou have committed agai^^^ God. Show thy self
therefore grateful, and serve him har^^ly, seeing without any merit of thine,
he has set thee in the way of salvation, if tho^ wilt thy self.

THE VIII. MEDITATION*
Of the glory of Heaven.

THE Preparatory prayer as the former. The Composition o^ place shall be, to
behold with the eye of thy soul, that Celestial Court, replenished with
whole Armies and Q^ier^ of Sovereign Spiri^^ and Saints ^dorning and
be^utifying it, and the Holy of Holyes ^eated in the midst of them with
infinite glory and Majesty.

The P^tition shall be, to beseech our Lord God, that seeing he has vouchsafed
to create thee to enjoy him, and so holy ^ society in that heavenly Court, he
will give thee grace to live in such sort, that depart^ing out of this vale of
tears and misery, thou may sttruely see and enjoy the same everlastingly.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider, the excellency, and the beauty of that glory, and of that
spacious, rich, and most fruitful and pleasant land of Promise. The ^ength of
the Eternity thereof, the greatness of Riches, the service of their tables, the
disposition and order of those which serve, the diversity of their liueries,
and finally the policy, ^ouernement, and glory of that nobl^ City.

Ponder, how our Lord God* though he be so bountiful and libe^all as he is,
notwithstanding to make thee a way into this his glory and paradise of
delights, he was not content with any lesser price, after sin committed, then
of the most precious ^loud and death of his only Sonn^ jesus. So that, it was
necessary, that God should dye to make thee par^a^er of that heavenly life, and
that ^e should endure griefs, pains* and sorrows, that thou might live in
perpetual joy, and contentment* And finally, that God should be nailed on a
Cross betwxit two thieves, that man might be placed among the blessed Quiers
of Angels*

Ponder furthermore, what, and how great, that good is, which that it might
be bestowed upon thee, it was necessary that God should sweat so many streams
of blood, be taken prisoner by his enemies, whipped, spit upon, buffeted, and
hanged upon a Cr^sse.

Gather hence a great estimation of this glory, and an earnest desire to enjoy
the habitation of so sovereign a City, and to walk the paths and streets
thereof, that animated with this consideration, thou may endure with pleasure
and delight whatsoever pains and difficulties may o^cur, for the attaining of
so great ^ good, remembering what Christ ou^ Savior performed and suffered in
the whole course of his life, least thou should loose the same.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider, that Almighty God did not prepare this house and ^^llace for his
honor alone, but for ^he honor and glory also of all his elect, fulfilling
that which himself said: I honor and gloryfy those, who honor and glorify
me. And ^ot content with thi^, he does, and will glorify, not only the souls,
but ^lso to bodies of his elect, allotting them a place in that his Royal
Palace.

Ponder, that it is the will of the Father of Mercyes, that the flesh which
deserved rather to lie like a brute beast in a stable, be placed and glorified
amongst the Angels in Heaven: that as it has helped to carry the burden, it
be also partaker of the glory, enjoying the same in all the senses of the body,
which then shall be more pure and perfect then ever before: for every one of them
shall have their special delight and glory, as the sense^ of the reprobat^ ^n
hell, shall have particular pain and grief.

Gather hence fervent desires to mortify thy senses, taking henceforward
particular care in the guard thereof, seeing that for the pains which last but
a small while in this life, thou shall be rewarded and crowned with that
immensity of eternal glory, without measure, or end of so great joys.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider the content which thou shall receive of that h^auenly Society and
company of Saints, and especially of the Saint of Sain^s Christ Jesus our Lord,
and at the glory and beauty of his sacred body which was before so much
disfigured upon the Cross^ for thee.

Pond^r, that notwithstanding the multitude of the bl^ss^d be innumerable, yet
there is not any disorder or confusion among them, but most perfect peace and
union, because the virtue of love and charity is there observed in the highe^t
degree, they being more perfectly united among themselves, then the part^ of
one and the self same body, are (...) with another, according to that which
our Savior demanded of hi^ ^^ther, saying: I pray thee (Father) at they may
be one (by love) as (...) also are one (by Nature.)

Ponder furthermore, that al^^ough so infinite number of heads (...) adorned
with most preciou^ ^^wnes, and every one with a scep^^ in his hand, all
notwithstandin^ (...) content with that they have, and (...) one enuieth ^t
another, because ^t Kingdom is so great and so ca^^ble, and their jurisdiction
so am^^ and large, as there is most abun^^ntly and completly enough for all*

Hence raise in thy self great (...) with a burning desire to appear the
presence of thy Savior, to be^ld his most singular beauty, and to ^ioy that
glorious co^tenance, upon ^ome the Angels desire to look: (...) if thou on
thy part be not ba^ke^^rd in his service, he doubtle^ will large and bountiful
in granting (...) these savors and benefits, ^nyfesting unto thee his
infinit^ ^ry and beauty, together with the glory of all those blessed Saints
and heavenly Courtiers. Let therefore thy works be such as thou may deserve
to be one of the number of so holy a company, and to live ever lastingly with
thos^ beloved children of almighty God.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider the wonderful and excessive joy which the souls o^ the blessed
will receive at the clear sight of Almighty God, wherein consists the
essential glory of the Saints.

Ponder, how the only sight of that divine countenance shall suffice to give
perfect contentment to all those blessed souls: for if the things of this
world delight us so much, how much will that infinite goodness delig^t us, which
contains in it self the perfection and sum of all that is good? And if the
sight of the creatures alone be there so glorious, what shall it be to see that
face, and that beauty, in whom all graces and beauties do shine? beholding
once the ^ystery of the most blessed ^rinity, the glory of the Father, the
wisdom (...) the Son, and the goodness and ^^ue of the Holy Ghost.

Desire from hence forward, ^ot to see, have, or enjoy in this ^orld any quiet,
ease, riches, or con^nt, in which thy affection may rest, (...) only in
Almighty God, and being ^ost willing to depart from all earth^^ comfort, that
thou may not be ^epriued of so divine a sight, and so ^ueraigne a good, as is
our God, ^^ying with the holy Prophet: One ^^ing I have asked our Lord, this
will ^^se^ke: That I may dvvell in the ^^use of our Lord all the days of ^y
life, that is, for all eternity.

THE SECOND BOOK OF MEDITATIONS appertaining to the Illuminatiue way.
What is the Illuminatiue Way.

THOS^ who be already justified, and be desirous to go forward in that which
they have begaun, and so gain tur^ and solid virtues, increasing daily
therein, must walk this second way, commonly called the Illumi^^tiu^ Way. The
end of which way is to Illuminate the soul with the light of sundry truths
and virtues, and with ^i^ely and effectu^ll desir^^ of knowing God, and to
unite himself wit^ ^im, exercising himself in the con^iderations of the
divine Mysterie^ of the life and death of our B. Saui^ur: for by meditating of
these, and ^y carrying them alw^yes in his h^rt ^e shall st^r up and enkindle
in himself, motions of devotion, proper (...) peculiar to this way, to wit,
lou^ and desire of the virtues of Humi^^ity, Patience, Chastity, Obedience,
^ouerty of spirit, C^arity and the like. For to what virtue can any one b^
^nclined, whereof he may not find in ^he life and death of our Savior
meruaillous examples, it being as i^ were a royal table, or banquet fur^ished
with all sorts of meats, a p^^radise full of all delights, a garden ^et forth
with all manner of flowers* ^ market abounding with all things* ^and as it were
a spiritual Fair reple^^^shed with all good things that w^ ^an wish for, as
in this second book^ ^halbe seen.

An Advertisement.
^T seems unto me conueni^^^ (...) for the better observing of our intended
breuity, not to treat from hence forward in the ensuing Meditations, of the
Preparatory Prayer, of the composition of Place, or o^ the Petition, since it
will suffice to hau^ done it in all the Medi^ations of the first Boobe, of which
every one may make his benefit, and have a general knowledge and light enough
to make always the said three things, according as the subjects of the
Meditation shall require: for more perspicuity whereof let us put an example or
two.

Will you meditate upon the Birth of our Savior Christ, or on the penance
which he did in the desert etc In the Former the composition of place may be as
follows.

Imagine that you see with the eyes of consideration, as it were ^ house or
cottage uninhabitable, forsaken of all, open on every side, full of cobwbes and
filth, exposed unto the wind and snowy weather, and in a corner thereof on the
ground, upon ^ little straw the only begotten Son ^f Almighty God, Jesus
Christ ou^ Lord, crying like a little infant, tr^bling and quaking for cold,
the most Bl^ss^d Virgin our Lady, and her Spouse S. Joseph full of devotion,
admiration, and astonishment, adoring him on their knees.

Let thy Petition be, to obtain^ grace of his Majesty, to perform the like
with them, and to know, serve, and be grateful for the favors and benefits he
comes to bestow upon thee, thou being so unworthy of them.

In the Meditation of the desert, the composition of the place may be made
thus: Behold with the interior sight of thy soul, Jesus Christ our Lord, all
alone in a desert, compassed with high mountains, and cragg^ rocks, doing for
the space of forty days hard and rigorous penance, not eating any thing at
all, environed with the fierce and wild be^stes of the woods, cast upon the
ground under a hedge, or at the foo^ of some tree (for such was his shelter and
place of repose) treating day and ^ight with his Eternal Father about thy
salvation.

The Petition shall be, that his Majesty* will vouchsafe to do thee so great a
favor as thou may serve and accompany him in that desert and willdernes. for
such holy company wilb^ to thee a paradise and glory.

And after this manner ^hou may alvvaies make in the beginning and entrance
of thy Prayer, the Composition of place, and Petition, according as the passage
or Mystery which thou do meditate, shall req^ire, humbly craving aid, and
favor of the holy Ghost, who (as ^ most excellent master of spirit) will
teach thee far better, then I can.

But one thing is specially to be noted, that when thou art to make the
Composition of place in some passage or Mystery of Christ, either newly borne,
or bound to the pillar, or nailed ^o the cross, thou must not imagine as
though it happened a far off, in Bethelem, or in Jerusalem, a thousand* and so
many years since, for this does wear^ the im^gination, and is not of so much
force to move: But rather imagine those things, as if they were present, and
even now did pass before thine eyes: seeing and beholding with the eyes of thy
soul the infant Jesus weeping and crying in the cradle or manger. And as it
were hear the strokes of whips, and knocking of the nails, whereby ^hou shall
both pray with more facility, swetnes, attention, and de^otion, and be moved
more and rea^ more abundant fruit and profit ^hereof.

THE I. MEDITATION.
Of the Conception of our B. Lady.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider, and with the ey^^ of thy understanding to behold the three divine
Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, in the ^hrone of their glory and
Majesty, in whose presence do assist an innu^erable number of Angels)
orday^ing and decreeing in tha^ suprem^ Council, that seeing the ^uine and
perdition of mankind, and the forgetfullnes of their eternal weal and
salvation, was so great, to redress the damage and universal hurt, the second
person of the most B. Trinity the only begotten Son of the Eternal Father,
should become Man to redeem us.

Ponder, the excessive lou^ which did burn and in^^ame his di^ine breast, for
having many other means to redeemee thee, which would have cost him far
less, he would notwithstanding make choice of no ^ther, but of that which
should ^ost him most of all, the more to declare, his unspeakable love toward
thee), making himself Man, that he might be more humbled thereby, and inue^ting
himself with the baseness of thy flesh, to communicate unto thee ^is
greatness: he that was before impassible, became mortal, be that was
Eternal, temporal, and o^ a Lord, a ^laue, of the king of heaven, a worm and
reproach of the earth.

Hence thou may gather the great longing desire our good Lord had of thy
salvation, seeing he would undertake so much for thee, for thy souls health.
Stir thou up likewise in thy self fervent desires of humiliation, the better
to serve him, for that he so humbled himself to redee^ thee.

THE 2. POINT.
To consider, how Almighty God having determined to make himself Man, and to
be borne of a Mother, as other men are, ordained that his holy spirit should
begin to build the house, wherein he was to dwell, creating the sacred Virgin
our B. Lady, pure, and without spo^ or blemis^, free from all stayne of sin,
original or Actual. And certainly it ^as meet that such a privilege should
be granted her, in whom^ God was to lodge and dwell as in hi^ holy Temple.

Ponder, that as all our hurt and perdition entered into the world by a man and
woman, God in like manner would that our redemption should have beginning by
another ^an, and another women. And (...) death entered into the world by Adam
and E^e when they sinned: so the life of grace should enter by Jesus and Mary
which never sinned, unto whom^ men should repa^re for remedy of their wants,
with like con^^dence as thy would have recourse to their own Father and Mother.

Gather hence, an earnest de^^re of the love of God, who by such means and
remedies, vouchsated to restore thee unto his grace, and friendship, making
thee (as S. Paul says) his child and member of Christ, and heir of heaven.
Acknowledge the good thou have received of him, and be thankful for so great
a benefit* behave thy self with all humility and subjection toward thy
Parents and Superiors, since he, who was supreme and absolute Lord of al
things, did subject himself and obey his creatures with so great an example
of humility.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider, how in the very instant that God created the soul^ of the
Blessed Virgin Mary, forming there with that little and tender bod^ of hers, in
the womb of her Mo^her Saint Anne, in that very moment he did also enrich and
beautify it with his sovereign grace, sanctify^ng her from the very instant of
her Conception, and preserving her from original sin, which as being the
daughter of the terristriall and sinful Adam, she was naturally to have
incurred.

Ponder, how great a glory and how singular an ornament it is to all mankind,
that a pure crea^^re, being naturrally conce^ued of a man and women, should b^
so highly advanced and adorned with tuch plenty of grace, and chosen o^ God as
a most precious v^ssell, (...) to place and bestow all those his divine and
so^eraigne treasures, which was fi^ she ^ould have, who was predestined to be
the Mother of God, and to crush ^he Head of the infe^n^ll Serpent.

Inuit the blessed Angels, the Heavens, the Ear^^, and all Creatur^ ^o the
praise of our Lord God, for ^o singular a ^au^ur bestowed on the Blessed
Virgin, and in her upon al the world. For that he chose her to b^ his Mother,
whereby she is also made thy Mother, and Advocate for all sinners, by whom
thou, and we all find access to the Throne of his infinite mercy: for none
has been truly and sincerely devout unto her who has not at last arrived at
the port of everlasting bliss.

THE 4. POINT
TO consider, how Almighty God having crea^ed this glorious Virgin, besides
that first grace (above mentioned) of preserving her from sin, and
sanctifying her soul, he did both then, and afterward from time to time endue
her with ne^ prerogatiu^^ of singular privileges, giving her from thence
forward the title and claim to the dignity of Mother of God, to which dignity
in due time he intended to ^duance her.

Secondly, g^aunting her th^^ she should feel no kind of bad inclyna^io^, or
disordered appetite. Thirdly confirming her in grace in such ^ singular manner,
as in seauenty and so many years which she lived, she never committed any
mortal sin, not so much as in thought. Fourthly preserving her also from all
venial sin, a thing wonderful above all wonders. Fifthly causing her to
concieue the Son of God by virtue of the holy Ghost, and bring him forth
without any pain at all, or detriment of her Virginal purity etc.

Ponder, how convenient it was that Almighty God should exalt and honor with
all these graces and privileges, and many more, this most pure Virgin. For it
is his general custom and manner of proceeding to make things proportionable
to the end for which he creates them; Wherefore our Blessed Lady being chosen
to the highest dignity that can be imagined, next to the humanity of the Son
of God, to wit, to be his Mother, there were also granted her the greatest
graces and privileges, the greatest sanctity and persection, next after him.

Rejoice and heartily be glad o^ the infinite and sovereign favors which God
has bestowed upon thi^ Blessed Vitgin. Inu^te the Angell^, that afterward
adored the Son of God, when he entered into the world to come now with all joy
and gladness to reverence her that is to be the Mother of God, and their
heavenly Queen. And ioynig thy self with them, salute her in the womb of her
Mother with the words which after were spoken unto her by the Angel Gabriell:
Hayle, full of grace, our Lord is with thee. Beseech him also O Blessed Lady,
that he will likewise be with me* to purify my soul, bridle ^y ^^esh, and
replenish me with hi^ grace and virtues.

THE II. MEDITATION.
Of the (...) of our Blessed Lady, and her Presentation in the Temple.

THE 1. POINT.
To consider, how the whole world being before overwhelmed with darkness and
ignorance, covered with an obscure and fearful night, at the birth of this
most blessed Virgin, it began to shin^ with a new and unwonted brightness, the
day as it were breaking up, and this sovereign morning* star spreading her
beams over the whole face of the earth, the Angels of heaven and the just that
lived here on earth reloycing and exulting, when they understood that the day
did now approach, and the Son of justice to be at hand, who with his heavenly
light would illuminate the world, and deliver it from all the evils and
miseryes which it did then sustain.

Ponder, that with great reason our Holy Mother the Church, guided by the Holy
Ghost, does say in the office of this day: That the Nativity of the B. Virgin
has brought singular joy and gladness to the world, For if the Angel Gabriell
truly said ^o Zachary, That many should re^oyce and take pleasure at the
Nati^ity of his Son Saint John Baptist, because he was to be the fore runner
of the Messiah, and to point him ou^ with his finger, and say, Behold the (...)
of God* how much more man the whole world now reio^ce, celebrate, and keep Hol^
the day on which this most glo^^^us Virgin ^as borne, she being to show unto us
our Lord and Savior in a far n^bl^r sort then S. John, not only p^i^ti^g him
out with her finger, but bearing him in her arms, and feeding hi^ at her
br^ast, saving: Behold this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased*

Stir thy self up to affection o^ joy, and to the praise of God,
congratulating him for the glorious birth of this blessed Virgin which he has
chosen to his Mother, and heartily thanking him for that he ha^h exal^ed her to
so great a dignity and honor, as never before or after was granted to any
pure creature. Thou shall likewise congratulate all mank^nd, for that now the
happy hou^^ of their Redemption is at hand: Jesus Christ our Lord being shor^y
to b^ borne of this immaculate Virgin, and made M^n, to exalt man to the
dignity of the Son of Almighty God*

THE 2. POINT
TO consider how the parents of this Blessed Virgin gave her the Name of Mary,
that is to say, A se^ of Graces, and such and so great were those the found in
the sight of God* that the celestial spirits astonished thereat* demanded one
of another: What is she that comes forth lik^ the Morning, fair as the
Moon, elect as the Sun, to whom, none in the earth can be compared, none
^ound ^er equal?

Ponder, ^ovv pleasing it was to the most Blessed Trinity to behold a Creature
so ^eautifull, so fair, and gracio^s in the sight of the Diuiue Mai^sty, and a
Creature who with the splendor, and shining light of ^er virtues, was to give
a happy beginning to the Blessed day of the Eternal Weal, and Redemption o^
mankind, the true Son of Iustic^ Christ Jesus being soon after to be borne
of her, and to rise out of her s^cred womb.

Desire most ardently and aff^^tuou^ly, to honor and serve thi^ heavenly Lady,
and to have continually in thy mouth and heart her most Holy Name. For as the
Name of Jesus is as a^ oil powered out, for the curing and healing of all
thos^ that are stricken and bitten by the in^ernall serpent, the Devil: so the
Name Mary has such a virtue and force, that being called upon with devotion,
like a most soueraig^e oil it illuminateth, comfort, ^ealeth and rejoices
the harr of man, and overcomes and vanquisheth the Devils themselves, who as
her sworn enemies do utterly abhor, and detest the sweet sound of this her
most sacred Name, and all those that are devoted unto her.

THE 3 POINT.
TO consider, how this most Blessed Child being borne, and now three years of
age, her parents S Ioachim and Saint Anne, for the fulfilling of the vow which
they had made to Almighty God, to offer up unto him ^he fruit of the
benediction which h^ should bestow upon them* brought her to the Temple,
joyful and much ^omf^^ted that she was to go to such ^ place, and to remain,
and serve her Creator, and Lord all her life time in that holy place. Yea not
content with this, out of her exceeding ^ue to Almighty God, she would also be
the first that ever made vow of ^erpetuall Virginity, and having made it, she
kept it so exactly and so perfectly, that she might justly seem ^ather an
Angel without a body, the ^ender Lady in mortal flesh.

Ponder the great devotion, where with this Blessed Child presen^ed and gave up
her self to Almighty God, offering herself wholly to his ^eruice. For being
come to the Tem^le she was first received by the high ^riest, and by him placed
on the lowest step of the fifteen which mounted ^o the Altar, from which, with
won^erfully joy, alacrity, and grace (no^ (...) or led in hand by any) she
^ounted up the rest of the fifteen ^ith great fervor of spirit, with an
^ndaunted courage, and resolute ^ind to ascend by all degrees of (...) to the
highest top of perfection.

Stir up in thy self a fervent desire to present thy self to Almighty God,
and to offer thy self in like manner wholly to his service, with a constant
resolution to mount up and increase every day more and more in purity of soul
and body, and never to separte thy self from him* And if his divine Majesty
shall do thee so much favor as to hear thy prayers* and to withdraw thee
from the occasion, and perils of this world to serve him in his holy Temple and
house; acknowledge it with much gratitude and thanks, as a most evident sign
of his special love toward thee, and a most certain token that he has a
particular care and providence over thee, as a most loving Father of his
dearest child.

^HE 4. POINT.
TO consider how this most Holy Virgin spent the years of her childhood in the
Temple. Doubtless she was a most absolute pattern of holiness, and of all kind
of virtues to the rest of the Virgins living in place with her, so careful, so
solicitous, and ^eru^nt she was in the service of God and in observing all
points of his ^oly Law: the first no doubt in the ^igill of the ^ight, in
Humility and ^ll humble offices the most humble, (...) purit^ ^he most pure, in
every ver^ue the m^st p^r^^ct.

Ponder, the great admiration and asto^ishment which the daily ^^nuersation an^
ver^uous exercises ^f this most Blessed Child did cause (...) her compani^ns*
and in those who ^id treat and converse with her, be^olding such eminent
ver^u^ and ^an^ity in so ^ender years. Ponder (...) with what (...) and
diligenc^ (...) spent a great part of the day in ^scendi^g the m^^sticall
ladder of the ^oly (...) Jacob, which reached ^^om the ea^^h unto the heavens,
the ^^grees whe^^of are R^ading Medi^^tion, Prayer, an^ Contemplation, which
holy ^xercises she there holy employed ^er self, being (...) visited b^ the
Blessed Angels, ^scending and asenoing by this ^auenly la^der, yea and by the
(...) of Angels standing and viewing her from the top thereof: i^ which, as in
many other notable things she seemed rather an Angel sent from heaven, then a
Virgin here borne on earth.

Stir vpin thy self a great desire to imitate this tender and B. Virgin in
those excellent virtues which she did exercise in the Temple: which among
others were Silence, Solitarines, Quiet of body and mind, Prayer and
Contemplation. Be ashamed to see thy self far from imitating her in any sort
whatsoeur, so remiss and ^^outhfull in the service of God, and in all vertuou^
exercises.

THE III. MEDITATION
Of the betrothing of the Blessed Virgi^ to Saint Joseph.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider the desires which the Blessed Virgin had, being in the Temple, to
live all the days of her life in subjection and obedience, understanding by
instinc^ ^f the Holy Ghost, how dangerous (...) thing liberty is for all, and
especially ^or women, wherefore she besought ^im very earnestly, that if
through any occasion she were to depart out ^is House and Holy Temple, she
^ight notwithstanding have whom (...) obey and serve.

Ponder, how few there be, ^ho desire that which this Blessed ^irgin desired,
or that demand of ^linighty God that which she de^aunded, to wit, the virtue
of Obe^ience and Humility, choosing ra^^er to serve and obey, then to be a
^istresse and commander over others* therefore when the divine proui^^nce
ordained, that she should ^^me from under the Obedience of (...) Superior in
the Temple, he (...) her vender S. Joseph, whom (...) was always after to
obey, reue^^ce, and respect* And this she vn^^rstood to be the will of God,
when was made her husband, to wit, (...) it was to the end she should per^^me
those offices of Obedience to^rds him.

Desire therefore and purpose to be duly respect and obedient to thy
Superior, whomsoever he b^ that God shall give thee, learning of this most
Holy Virgin true humility and obedience, who being Quee^^ of heaven and Mother
of God, obeyed and served, not only her Superio^^ in the Temple from three
years o^ age, till she was thirteen, but man^ years after S. Joseph her
Spo^se that walking the path which she di^ and following her footsteps, tho^
may ariue whither she did, that (...) ^o see and enjoy God for ever in (...)
and endless bliss.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider, how little more the^ ten years being past that the (...) Virgin
lived enclo^ed and recollect^^ In the Temple (her parents bei^^ no^ dead) the
high Priest thoug^^ good for the fulfilling of the receued Law, and Custom, to
(...) her in some determinate state of (...) and so they betrothed her to a
(...) man called Joseph, who thou^ (...) were poor, yet was ^e nobly ^^ended,
and of the blood Royal, and withal a virtuous and holy man.

Ponder the great obedience, which this Holy Virgin showed in accepting that
state of life, which o^herwise was much against her best desires: but
understanding that it was ^he will of Almighty God, she es^oused her self to
this Holy man, being certified by divine revelation, that it should be without
prejudice ^f her integrity and Angelical purity. ^he day therefore being come
in which this most chaste marriage should ^e contracted, behold with what
^xcellent composition of body and ^ind, with what virginal bashfull^es and
modesty, the gave her ^and ^o her earthly Spouse, having been (...) before
espoused, and wholly de^icated to an Heavenly King.

Desire most earnestly to imitat^ (...) most blessed Virgin according ^ thy
estate, persuading thy self (...) obaying Almighty God, and ^usting in him,
thou shall not want ^rtue, nor comfort, nor any thing ^hatsoeuer with reason
tho^ (...) desire for thy salvation, because God as his knowledge and power is
infinite, so he can join Virginity with Wedlock, Contemplation with
Occupation, and the beauty of Rafhell with the ^ecundity of Lia, so that the
one shall nothing prejudice or endomage the other.

THE 2. POINT.
To consider how convenient i^ was that this sacred Virgin should be espoused
to Saint Joseph, both in regard of her self and of her mos^ B Son: for
having from all eterni^y determined to be borne of her, (...) would not that
her honor and fam^ should be subject to calumniation, (...) doub^les it would
have been, if she had had a Son without a husband.

Ponder the great Humility o^ the Son of Almighty God, wh^ those rather to be
accounted the (...) of a poor Artificer (being the (...) of his eternal
Father) then that (...) ^ame of his most chaste Mother should receive the least
blemish or stain, (...) being the example and pattern of (...) vert^e and
purity.

Seek hence for ward to maintain the good name and fame of others, ever
speaking well and honorably of thy Neighbour^, though they deserve it not, and
especially of those who in any sort be thy superiors: for as thou have need of
^ good conscience in the sight of God, so thy Neighbor has need of a good
name in the sight of man to conserve ^and maintain his hono^r and reputation.
For as the Holy Ghost says: A good Name shall be more permanent to thee, then ^
thousand tre^surs precious and great. And if thou fail in this, thou deseruest
most justly to be punished of God as a trangressour of his holy Law, which
cons^steth (as our Savior Christ says) in two Commandments, to wit, (...)
loving of God, and of our neighbor.

THE 3. POINT
TO consider, that Almighty God would, that S. Joseph should not only be the
defender and guardia^ of the person, Chastity, and fame of the most Blessed
Virgin, but also which is more to be admired* that he should be withal her
Spou^e, and Husband.

Ponder the depth of the divine Counsel and Ordination in recommending so great
a treasure and so pr^cious^ a relic, as the sacred Virgin was, to the change
and custody of so poor a man, she being so ^ighly favored, and esteemed of
God, as that he particularly chose her to be his Mother. For if our Lord
ke^^eth the souls of his Saints, as David says, and he himself said to
Abraham, I am thy Protector wheresoever thou art; the defense and custody of
man might seem wholly needles in her, of whom God and ^is Angels had so
special protection. Neither is it less wonderful, that his divine Majesty
should appoint and ordain, that the lesser and inferior should help and keep
the greater and more eminent, and that he who was less^ perfect and able, should
have care of her that was more able and perfect: giving us to understand, that
there be subjects in this life higher in grace, then be their Superiors, and
sheep mo^e exalted then their Pastors and sheepheards.

Gather hence desires to humble thy self in imitation of the excellent
hu^ility of our Blessed Lady, who having so many pledges and tokens of the
infallible protection of God and his Angels, did notwithstanding, with all
Humility live in subjection, and under the gouernem^nt not of ^ome rich man, or
some Earl, Duke, or King, but of a poor Carpenter, who was feign to get his
^iuing by his daily labor, and maintain himself as he could be his trade,
and sweat of his brows. And in this man's company she was ^o live at home and
abroad, and whi^her soever he went, that so her ^ame (...) chastity might be
secure. Whenc^ ^hou may understand, that seeing Almighty God would not le^ue
his own Mother without a guard, he will not also keep or protect any one that
shall presume of himself, as suf^icient of himself: and much l^ss^ will
ass^st him, who shall be ungrateful ^or the guard and superior appointed him
already by God himself, whether he be less or more eminent in virtue,
learning, or whatsoever natural or supernatural part^.

THE IIII. MEDITATION
Of the Annunciation of the B. Virgi^, and of the Incarnation of the Son of
God.

THE 1. POINT.
TO behold the most Holy Virgin in her secret Closet wholly attending to
Contemplation, and (as some Holy men do observe) meditating the sacred Mystery
of the Incarnation of the Son of God, which had been revealed unto her,
though it had not been told her in what manner, or time it should be executed,
nor who should be the Virgin that was to conceive, and to bring forth so noble
a Son.

Ponder, how grateful this her p^ayer was in the sight of Almighty God, when
rising in the night time (her Blessed Spouse Saint Joseph per^eauing no such
matter, though he took his rest in the self same chamber) she kneeled down
in the da^ke in some corner of the same chamber, and beginning to speak with
God from the very bottom of her heart, she brake forth into these like words,
with far greater fervor the^ ever Moy^es did, saying: if I have found grace
in thy sight, O Lord, I beseech thee have mercy on mankind, redeem the many
souls that do daily perish, send down from a boue the Blessed Lamb of God
to take a way the sins of the world, ^^et the desired of all Nations come ^ow
at l^st. Vouchsafe to create her that is to carry in her arms and bosom thy
most Blessed Son our Redeemer. O how happy should I be (O my Lord) if thou
would est vouchsafe to make me the handmaid and poorest servant of thy B.
Mother. More would I esteem such a favor then to become Queen^ of the whole
world. Thus did the Ble^^ed Virgin speak unto God, and obtay^ed doubtless more
of him by such prayers, then ever ^a^^b or Moses did by theirs. And answer
was returned her as to that other woman of the Gospel: O woman, great is thy
^ayth, be it unto thee as thou wi^t, And Almighty God dealt so bo^n^ifully with
her, that instead of making her his hand^ maid as she desired, he chose her for
his mother.

Meditate therefore often those things which this most pure Virgin did
meditate upon, and wish for that which she most humbly craved, to wit, to serve
her, yea to be as her hand^ maid that was to be the Mother of the living God.
Stir up in thy self special deuo^ion to this Blessed Virgin, that though thou
have been a m^st wretched sinner, yet she may notwithstanding for thy diligent
service hereafter account thee as one of her adopted Children.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consi^er how that God having determind to make himself Man, and to be
borne of a woman, (...) from above all the women that were to live from time to
time in this world: among all which, thi^ most c^ast and pure Virgin Mary was
most pleasing and gracious in his divine sight. And to her alone he decreed to
send that so glorious Embassy which after wards he did by the Angel Gabriell.

Ponder first, how many Queens and principal Ladies were then in the world,
on whom men bad cast their eyes, and were by them highly esteemed, of whom
there was much speech and talk, who were much regarded and greatly respected
of all, yea and accounted also happy amongst women: yet upon none of these did
Almighty God vouchsaf^ to look, but on her alone that was forgotten of all,
poor, retired, and wholly unknown to the world: she I say, alone was chosen,
and called by God himself: Blessed a^ong all women: Full of grace, and the
like.

Ponder ^econdly, how the Ang^ll, en^ring into the chamber of the Blessed
Virgin, kneeling on the ground, saluted with great reuerenc^ this Princess of
Heaven, the elected Mother of Almighty God, the queen of Angels, and the first
word he said unto her, was: Hayle full of grace, our Lord is with thee.

Gather hence an earnest desire that our Lord would vouchsafe to cast his
divine and gracious eyes upon thee, to the end that as thou art of those who
are called, thou may be also of the elect, although thou deseruest it not,
desiring and requesting him to do thee the favor and grace, that (seeing thou
art not an Angel but a poor and silly worm) thou may speak with his
divine Majesty, (...) his most holy Mother in thy Prayer, with great reverence,
fear, and love.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider, how the Blessed Virgin was troubled, with the sight of the
Angel, though he appeared in a most resplendent and glorious sh^pe (for it is
credible that the Blessed Angel visited her many times, and treated familiarly
with her) but she was troubled at so wonderful and so unwonted a salutation,
and to hear the praises which were spoken of her.

Ponder, what a mean concei^ this most holy Virgin ^ad of her self, for being
in her own sight so mean as out of her great Humility she held her self to
be, she could not be persuaded that such greatness could be contained in her
littleness, and so she desired to be the hand maid unto her that should be the
Mother o^ Almighty God. And thereupon wa^ confounded and troubled, because
whoso^uer is truly humble, is troubled at nothing so much, as hearing his
own praises; (...) the Ang^ll said unto her: Fear not Mary, for thou have
found grace with God, which ought to take all dread and fear^ from thee.

Gather hence, how mean (...) how base a conceit it is reason tho^ should
have of thy self, being as thou art, so vile and so miserable a creature: shut
out from thy heart whatsoever vain praise men shall give unto thee, attribu^ing
the glory thereof wholly to God, and the confusion to thy self: desire and be
glad that they entreat and handle thee as thou deseruest, that exercising thy
self by this means in Humility, thou may prosper and increase both in the
sight of God and man, as did this most Holy and pure Virgin Mary.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider the most prudent answer which the Blessed Virgin made to the
Angel, full of so great Humility and Obedience, yielding that joyful consent
unto his sp^aches which rejoiced both heaven and earth, saying unto him: Behold
the hand^ maid of our Lord, be it done to me, according to thy word. And in
that very instan^ the Son of the Eternal Father Jesus Christ our Lord was
incarnate in her sacred womb by virtue of the Holy Ghost, to who^ this work
is especially attributed.

Ponder first: that although the dignity and office of being the Mother of God
was so high and so excellent, yet because it had annexed unto (...) ^^^inent
labors, trauells, and ^^flictions, it was the will of Almighty God, that it
should not be imposed upon her without her consent and good will, but rather
that ^he should of her own free will accept the same dignity, together with
the charge, that so she might merit a great deal the more.

Ponder secondly, how thi^ Blessed Virgin being chosen to be the Mother of the
Son of God, she termed her self a handmaid, and not a Mother, as who did
accept this office to serve as a handmaid, not to be served and attended upon
as a Lady and Mistress. Agreeing in this with that which afterward her B.
Son said of himself: That he came not to be served, but to serve his
creatur^ and to put himself even under their feet.

Enkindle in thy self inflame^ desires of the love of this virtue of Humility,
and of subiecting thy self wh^ly to the will of Almig^ty God, and never to
resist any thing which he shall command or enioine thee, how hard and
painful soever it shall be, but always and in every thing, saying: Gods will
be done. Poverty, aduersi^y, troubles, pains, necessity, and whatsoever want
of things in this life, receive them as sent by the hand and providence of
Almighty God himself, and embrace them with alacrity and love, saying with the
Blessed Virgin: Gods will be done.

THE V. MEDITATION.
Of our Blessed Ladies Visitation of Saint Elizabeth.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how the Angel having taken leave of our Blessed Lady, she
remembering what had been told her of her Cousin Saint Elizabeth being great
with child, did greatly rejoice, and coming out of her Closet, arose and went
unto the City of Judah, and entering into the house of Zachary, saluted there
Saint Elizabeth her Cousin German.

Ponder, how the love and ear^est desire which this Holy Virgin had to please
Almighty God, brake through whatsoever difficulties, and though she saw that
the way was long and painful, the time cold and her self tender of
complexion, all this notwithstanding seemed easy unto her. And presently
without any stay, she departed toward that high and hilly Country, to
accomplish the divine will, and not regarding the dignity to which she was
ne^ly exalted, being chosen the Mother of God, she desired and reioiced to
visit, and serve her that was far inferior unto her.

Gather out of this example of so rare Humility, first a great desire to submit
thy self, and to put thy self under the feet of all, choosing rather to
serve, then to be served, in imitation of this Blessed Virgin, who being Lady
and Mistress of all the world* went to visit her seruent.

Secondly, desire to imitate the great Charity of the Blessed Virgin* reioicing
at that great good, and contentment which Saint Elisabeth had received, and for
the favor which Almighty God had bestowed upon her: for this is an admirable
and most noble virtue, to rejoice and be glad at our neighbors good: and the
contrary is the sin of enuv, a vice proper to ^he Devil, who is ^lwaes sorry
and rep^^ing at the good of others. Be thou glad therefore and rejoice, because
t^is Blessed Virgin our Lady is made the Mother of Almighty God* and
congratulating her, beseec^ that she will vouchsafe also to be thy mother:
seeing she is so humble, that she will visit and con^ort thee with her most
sweet and graciou^ presence.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider the entrance of the B. Virgin our Lady, and of her most Holy Son
into the house of S. Eli^abeth: whom the Blessed Virgin as being most humble,
saluted first, replenishing both her, and the little infant in her womb Saint
John Baptist, and all the whole house, withmany beauenly gifts* for thereby the
infant was cleansed from original sin, and filled with the Holy Ghost, Saint
Elisabeth his mother received the gift of prophesy, and Saint Zach^ry his
Father the use of his tongu^ to praise Almighty God withal: f^r ^here his
divine Majesty, and hi^ blessed Mother do enter, there cannot be wanting true
^oy, and perfect comfort.

Ponder what a hol^ salutation this was, and how different from those which now
adays are used in the world, full of vanity and flattery, where so much time
is lost, and so many sins and offenses are committed against Almighty God.

Gather hence a great desire to be visited of this thy sovereign King and
Lord, that with his divine pre^ence, the greatness^ of his mercies may be made
manifest in thee, who (...) so unworthy of them, beseeching ^im to give thee,
as he did to his Pre^ursor Saint John, light and know^^dge of the high M^stery
of his In^a^nation, and rejoice at his sacred ^^^sence. Entreat also the
Bl^ss^d ^irgin to obtain for thee of be^ most Holy Son, some of those
heavenly favors, which by her only sight he bestowed in such plenty and
abundance on this thrice happy babe, and on his parents, that now and for ever
thou maistimploy thy self in h^^ praises, as they did.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider, how Saint Elizabeth understanding by divine reuel^tion, the
mysteries of the incarnation of the Son of God in the sacred womb of the
most Blessed Virgin Mary, she began to praise and magnify her saying: Whence is
this to me, that the Mother of my Lord does come unto me? But the Blessed
Virgin the more she was praised, the mo^e she did humble her self attr^b^^ing
the glory of all to Alm^ghty God, breaking forth into this Canticle: My soul
does magnify ou^ Lord etc.

Ponder, that as all holy and just men do never attribute any good thing
whatsoever to their own de^erts, so out of the like affection of Humility,
Saint Elizabeth wondering at the graces and favors which Christ and his Mother
had done unto her, cried out: Whence is it, that so great a favor has been
showed me, I being so unworthy thero^?

Desire thou l^ke wise to do the same, when thou shall be honored and praised
by men, humbling thy self the more, and acknowledging that all the good thou
have, wholly comes from Almighty God, and is not of thy self. And sav with
Saint Elizabeth: Whence is it, that God vouchs^feth to remember me, I having
been so unmindful of him? How happen these things, O Lord, to me, I having
so often offended thee, and been so ungrateful to thy divine Majesty? Which
thou must practice, not only in words, but also in works and deeds, as the
Blessed Virgin did, when she served her Cousin S. Elizabeth almost th^e^ months
with great care and ^il^gence, even in humble and base offices, ^xercising the
self willingly, y^^ and deligh^ing therein, a^ Christ our Savior and his B.
Mother did all their life ^^me.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider the great good which the Blessed Virgin did in the house of her
Cousin, how much she did profit all those that lived therein with her heavenly
discourses, and rare examples of Modesty, Humility, and Charity. For if her
only sight and presence was cause of so many and so extraordinary graces both
in the Mother and the child, what would (as Saint Ambrose well notes) the
^ompany and communication of so many days and months as she sta^ed with Saint
Elizabeth, work and effect in them? How pious may we imagine their
conversation to have been? ho^ singular the examples of virtue? how would they
exhort one another to prayer, and to inward communication with Almighty God?

Ponder, that if by reason that the Arc of the Testament was three months in
the house of Obededom God heaped upon him and upon all his family so great
b^nefits* wi^h how much more reason may we justly ^elieue that this divine
Arc of the new T^stament (within which lesus Christ himself reposed)
remaining as many months in the house of Zachary and Elizabeth, would fill it
with a thousand benedictions and heavenly favors.

Gather hence a constant and an undoubted hope, that whenever thou shall come
to receive Almighty God in the most Blessed Sacrament, with a lively faith,
though thou be so poor and miserable as thou art, he will replenish thy soul,
in which his divine Majesty desires to make his habitation and abode, vvit^
many celestial benedictions and spir^tuall ^auours.

THE VI. MEDITATION.
of the revelation made by the A^gell unto S. Joseph, concerning this Mystery

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how noble and worthy a man this Patriarc^ S* Joseph was, being of
a pri^cely race, and lineally descended of King David's house. But that which
did m^st commend and honor him, was not his pedigree and descent, but that he
was true heir of the virtues of that Holy King, as of his Meeknes, Justice,
and Holiness of life etc. and finally because he was a man truly according to
the heart of God. And such a one doubtless it was convenient he should be, who
was to be exalted to so great a dignity, as to be the Spouse of the Mother of
Almighty God, and to whose custody was to be commended so great a treasure as
was his most Holy Son.

Ponder, how the Blessed Saint knew to negotiate and to help himself with the
gifts which he had received, daily augmenting and increasing them more and
more: only one thing did cause in him great sadness and sorrow of mind, to wit,
to see his sacred Spouse after her return^ from Zacharies house, to be great
with child, he having no part therein. But as h^ was a just man, and lived in
fear of Almighty God, he would ^ot speak of it to any body, but ^hought
secreetly to abandone and ^eaue her. But far greater was the ^ffiction of the
Blessed Virgin his Es^ouse, who could not but preceiue ^is intention of
forsaking her, and ^asting her off, and be much grieved ^o see him so sad and
troubled in mind ^home she so deerly loved and much ^e^pected for his holiness
of life: and ^nowing on the other side her self ^o be free from any fault,
whereof she ^as suspected by him, she lived in co^^^nuall pain and grief.

Out of which thou may ga^^er, that albeit one be very holy, and ^nuerse
always with holy persons, ^et in this life he shall not want cause (...)
humiliation and affliction, by which ^lmighty God will try his virtue, (...)
love toward him, as they were (...) wanting to our Blessed Lady and Joseph.

THE 2. POINT*
^O consider the secret judgments of Almighty God, in not reuea^g this Mystery
of the Incarnation ^his only begotten Son to S. Joseph as he had revealed it
to Zachary and to Saint Elizabeth. And the cause was, thereby to take occasion
to exercise the virtues of the Blessed Vi^gin, and her Holy Spouse.

Ponder, the great good which is contained in Humility and affliction: for they
are as it were the precu^sours of great consolation and comfort, as we may see
in thi^ present passage: Almighty God ordaining* that the Blessed Virgin should
suff^^ this humiliation and infamy, to di^pose her thereby, and to make (...)
more fit for those favors which soon after she was to receive in Bet^^ leem.

Hence thou may gather, (...) though thou could clear (...) self when
thou art accused, an^ show thy innocence, yet oftentim^^ thou must have
patience, and (...) upon God his divine prouide^^ suffer for his love some
infamy (...) shame. And if this be to be (...) when thou art innocent, with
(...) much more patience ought (...) to endure the (...) when thou (...) and
blame worthy: following the example of the Blessed Virgin, who though she were
innocent, did not seek to excuse herself, but embracing humility and silence,
chose rather to be esteemed naught, then to discover those hidden Mysteries,
and that most excellent treasure which Almighty God had committed unto her;
putting her honor into his hands, and ^eaching thee thereby how thou ought
to exercise thy self in all humility and silence.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider, that though Almighty God concealed that Mystery unto S* Joseph
for a time, and knowing that he could not find out the cause of her being with
child, vn^^sse he should reveal it unto him, ^he determined so to do, thereby
to ^defend the honor of the most Bles^ed Virgin sending an Angel unto S.
^oseph to free him from all scruple, ^^nd suspicion, and to reveal unto ^im
the most ^idden and ineffable Mi^tery of our Redemption.

Ponder, how with this revelation Almighty God converted the grief and sorrow
of this Holy Patriarch, into exceeding great joy and comfort. And it is
credible, that he did go and prostrate himself at the ^eete of the Blessed
Virgin, craving humbly pardon for the suspicion and for the error which he had
committed, acquainting her with the Mystery which the A^gell had revealed unto
him.

Hence thou ^aist gather two things. First, that although truth sometimes lie
hidden for a while, yet i^ shall be at length discovered and known. Secondly
that when at any time tho^ shall be suspected or accused of some fault
vnderseruedly, tho^ ought to humble, and not always to defend or excuse thy
self, vnless^ thou should sometimes be bound in conscience, for the honor
of God or good of thy Neighbor. And persuade thy self certainly that never
any thing was lost by putting thy ^rust and confidence in Almighty God, as we
see the Blessed Virgi^ received greater honor by* concealing the Mystery, then
she should hau^ done, if otherwise she had disclosed it.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider the faithfullnes of the divine providence, in coming then to
remedy the affliction of his friends, when they are brought into greatest
extremity, applying divine, when human means do fail, as here he did,
revealing this secret Mystery to Saint Joseph, and giving him to understand,
that the Blessed Virgin had conceived by virtue of the Holy Ghost, and that she
should bring forth a Son, of whom he was to have a tender care, whose name
he was to call JESUS, which is a^ much to say, as Savior.

Ponder the singular joy and content which this Holy Patriarch received at the
hearing of these so happy tidinges, how thankful he was to Almighty Go^, for
having given him an Espouse so Holy, and of so great worth and dignity: and
committed to his charge the care of his only begotten Son. But abo^e all
this, what, and how great was the spiritual comfort of the most Blessed
Virgin, seeing her Spouse whom she loved so tenderly, and whose affliction and
trouble she had felt so much and taken so heavily, now to be so full of joy and
comfort. What thanks and praises did she give unto Almighty God for so great a
benefit, as was the declaring of her innocence, and assisting her in so great a
tribulation.

Gather hence how much it import^ thee to rely upon the providence of Almighty
God, and to have great security and confidence in the midst of thy
afflictions seeing it is most certain, that his divine Majesty at fit and due
time will come and remedy all things, and set thee free from all trouble and
molestation, to thy great comfort, and consolation.

THE VII. MEDITATION.
Of the expectation of our Blessed Lady her delivery.

THE 1. POINT.
TO Consider that as our Blessed Lady was a Virgin, in conceiving the Son of
Almighty God, so likewise did she know she should so remain in bringing forth
the same Son: for the experience of what had passed, assured her of what was
to come.

Ponder the spiritual joy which she conceived in her soul, breakin^ forth
into these, or such like words of admiration and thanks giving: Is it
possible that I have conceived in my womb that very Son, Almighty God, whom
the Eternal Father contains in himself! I give thee most humble thanks,
most mighty Lord, for that thou have chosen me, thy hand maid for thy Mother. O
that the hour of thy birth were now come, that I might see thee before me,
that I might have thee in my arms, that I might nourish thee at my breasts,
and with my milk.

Gather hence, and stir up in thy self the like desires, and in imitation of
this Blessed Virgin, say: Is it possible, O Lord, that I being who I am, so
vile and so wretched a creature, thou have nevertheless chose me to be thy
Son! to receive and enclose thee in my breast, to hold thee in my hands, to
kiss and embrace thee a thousand times! and leaving many others, who would
have bin more thankful unto thee, and served thee much better then my self,
have abandoned them and received me! I render thee, o my Lord God, infinite
thanks for so great a benefit and mercy. Grant I be^eech thee, that I may
duly prepare my self these days to receive thee, and welcome thee into the
world, as this most Blessed Virgin thy Mother and our Lady, did divinely
dispose and prepare her self for thy coming.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider the lively and inflamed desire which our Blessed Savior had in
the womb of his most Holy Mother, to manifest himself to the world, for the
redeeming of mankind, and to give us repast and food of life everlasting.

Ponder, that his small and tender body was not so p^essed and straightened in
that narrow prison of the womb of his Mother, as was his loving heart kept in,
and straightened with the force of his vehement desire: and though every day
seemed unto him a year, yet he would nevertheless remain therein the full
time of nine mone^hes, and admi^ no privilege which mig^t exempt him from
suffering, or shorten the time of his durance therein.

Gather hence, how much it imports thee, to dispose thy self these days to
celebrate with devotion the feast of his Holy Na^^iuit^, (...) the inflamed
desires ^herewith those ancient Fathers disposed ^hemselues for it. For so thou
shall reap in thy heart the Blessed fruit of thy hopes.

THE 3. POINT*
TO consider how greatly the most sacred Virgin desired at length to behold
with her eyes the only Son of Almighty God, the fruit of her womb, to adore
and serve him in way of gratitude and thankefullnes for the great favor he had
done her^in electing and chosing her to be his Mother.

Ponder, with how loud and often cries of her heart she repeated with ardent
affection of desire and love, that which the holy Church does often sing: O
would to God thou would break open the heavens, and descend, and the
clouds rain down the Savior! And with the Espouse: O my Son, that I ^ight
see thee out of this thy enclosure, sucking the breasts of thy mother, that I
may kiss, cherish, and embrace thee!

Hence thou may gather like affections, and desiring that thy Sa^iour would
^ome unto thee, endeavor to imitate the Blessed Virgin our Lady, to the end
thou may see, and enjoy the divine treasure which she did. And with these or
the like words move and quicken thy desires to ador^ and serve the Son of God
borne newly in thy soul, as the most Blessed Virgin his mother did serve and
adore him.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider, what S. Joseph did, what his thoughts and meditations were these
days: doubtless through the great desire which he also had to see his Lord
God, he often spoke these or the like words. Come at last O hope of all
Nations, let my eyes behold thee before they be closed up! when shall this be?
O that it were now, that I might once come to kiss and embrace thee most
tenderly!

Ponder, how this Holy man, perceiving the Blessed Virgin to be near her
delivery, ser^ed and cherished her, in whatsoever his small forces, power, and
ability was able, ^especting and honoring her as the Mother of Almighty God,
and hi^ most chaste Espouse, of whose virtue, ^olines, and purity he had now so
high a conceit and esteem.

Gather hence desires to do the like, esteeming and reuerencing this most pure
Virgin, serving her with purity of body and soul, and performing these days
some particular service toward her, that she may obtain for thee of her
Son, a good preparation to receive him, as this Holy Patriarch by her means
obtained.

THE VIII. MEDITATION.
Of our Blessed Ladies journey from Nazareth to Bethleem.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how the Son of the everliving God, being to be borne into this
world, h^ ordained to leave and dep^iue himself of those commodities which he
might have had in Nazareth, being to have been borne in his Mothers house, and
amongst his kindred and friends, where he could not have wanted the shelter of
a warm lodging or chamber, yea and further commodity and attendance, such as
was not wanting unto Saint John, borne at home in his Fathers house.

Ponder, how Christ Jesus our Lord abandoned, and contemned whatsoever the
world loves, to wit, contentments, pleasures, and pamperings of the flesh, and
sought for all that which the world abhors and flies, as he demonstrated in
the poverty and want of all things, in which he always did exercise himself,
and choosing to be borne in Bethleem, at the time when all things should be
wanting unto him, in a hour and season so inco^modious, sharp, and rigorous.

Here confound thy self, beholding so rare an example, and b^ ashamed to see
thy self so great a lover of thy own commodities and delicacies. Humbly
beseech him to give thee grace, that thou may renounce whatsoever pleasures
and delights of the flesh, and love and embrace poverty and want of all things,
as he always did.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider the occasions which Christ our Savior took to make this his
journey, that thereby all might know he came to obey, and serve, and not to do
his own will, but the will of his Father who had sent him.

Ponder, that as Christ our Savior was borne in obedience, so he also dyed in
obedience, that thou might learn to obey. In regard of which obedience his
holy will was, that his Mother and himself in her should profes^^ service and
alieagiance, and submit themselves to the commandment of Augustus Cae^ar, who
as Emperor and Lord of the world had commanded that all his subjects should
be enrolled for the paying him tribute.

Gather hence that if the King of heaven entered into the world humbling
himsel^e and professi^g allegian^e to a temporal King, it cannot be much for
thee to humble and subject thy self to a heavenly King, and to thy Superiors,
his substitutes on earth, to whose will thou must endeavor to form all thy
actions: for this is the will of Almighty God.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider the discommodityes which our Blessed Lady suffered, who being
poor, the way long, the season sharp and cold, and in the heart of winter,
coming to Bethleem ^ll weary, and destitute of humane comfort, yet she carried
all with admirable patience, and conformity to the will of Almighty God.

Ponder, how the Blessed Virgi^ and S. Joseph went that journey all alone,
unknown and forgotten of the world, notwithstanding they were the most
precious Jewels the world had ^uer yielded, and in highest esteem in the sight
of God! O how little did the B. Virgin and S. Joseph regard the world, with all
the pomp, and honor thereof!

Gather hence desires to be forsaken of men, and be ashamed of the little love
which thou have to suffer, and that thou so easily do complain o^ the lea^t
discommodity, which is offered. Learn from this day forwards to set all things
at naught, but only virtue and holiness of life.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider, how that after two or thee days journey these holy pilgrims
arrived at B^thleem late in the evening, and going fra^ house to house, and from
Inn to Inn, did enquire after lodging, either for money or for Gods sake, but
found none that would receive or lodge them, all being taken up by persons of
better esteem and fa^hion, then they were thought to be.

Ponder, how often this sovereign Lord has called at the gates of thy heart,
and said unto thee that which he said to his chaste and Holy Espouse in ^n the
Cantieles: Open to me, my b^loued, m^ sister, my dove. But such was thy
obst^acy and rebellion, that thou would never entertain nor ledge him, yea
rather have shut the door most ungratefully against him.

Gather hence a great desire now at last to harbor and receive this thy Lord,
and Master, and give him some place in thy heart that he may be spiritually
borne in thy soul: for doubtless he will most abundantly requite thy good
hospitality and entertainment, as he requited Martha and Zachaeus. Beseech him
to come once more and knock at thy door, for that thou will now open it unto
him, and give him the best part of thy house* to wit, thy heart, that he may
repose and remain therein as long as it shall be pleasing unto him.

THE IX. MEDITATION.
Of the Nativity of our Savior Christ in Bethleem.

THE 1. POINT.
TO Consider how the most B. Virgin not finding any other, was feign to take up
her lodging in a poor and forlorn cottage, yea which is more, in a vile and
loathsom^ stable, the which Saint Iosep^ having accommodated after the best
manner he could, they there rested very well contended, rendering to Almighty
God many thanks for that sorry ^helter and abode.

Ponder first, that a poor and ^ase habitation is nothing displeasing unto
Almighty God, so it be quiet and free from all worldly v^^ities. For God had
rather come and remain with a poor and humble man (if he give him his heart)
quiet, and free, then with any Prince or King, that has his mind busied and
disquie^ed with worldly affairs.

Ponder secondly, how the B. Virgin miraculously perceiving the time of ^er
delivery to be at hand, in place of sorrow and pains which other women do
feel, she was filled with joy and gladness of soul and body, contemplating
the present benefit, which Almighty God bestowed upon the world, for the
redemption thereof: and so she brought forth her only Son, and the only
begotten of God the Father, without any pain^ or grief, or lo^^^ of her
Virginity: whereat being wrapped with profound ^dmiration, she cried our: It is
possible, that with these eyes of mine I do see God who created me, now become
a child for my sake, in this most vile and abject place of the earth, (...)
stable! Is it possible that I behold ^he Son of the Eternal God, be^ome a
tender babe! And the sple^^^our and brightness of the glory of ^is Father,
laid upon a little straw, and hay! That I hear, and see him ^^eep, who is the
only comfort of ^he miserable, and the joy of the A^^ells!

Gather hence a great desire to feel, and experience that which the Son of
Almighty God suffered and felt at this his entrance into the world endeavoring
to get at the least some one of the virtues which then he discovered, of
Humility, Poverty, Patience, and Contempt of all things which this most
miserable world does yield.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider, how the sacred Virgin, beholding that Blessed babe, whom the
Seraphims and all the Blessed Spirits do serve and adore, lying upon a little
straw, shiu^ring for cold, and in all things behauing himself as an infant,
the tears trickled down her che^kes, and bowing with great devotion her knees
to the very ground, with most profound reverence she adored him as her God, and
kissed his sacred feet as of her King, his hande^ as of her Lord, and his face
as her dearest Son, and embracing him, and laying him at her virginal
breasts, did rejoice with him, and say: O child of gold, O riches of heaven, O
joy of Angels, O mirror of beauty, thou art most welcome into the world
utterly lost without thee: in good time art thou come into this land of
perdition, to be a means for us all to ascend into heaven.

Ponder, with how sweet and cheerful a countenance this Blessed Infant would
behold his beloved Mother, and smiling upon her, would discover unto her how
the immensity of God did there lie hidden in so small a corpse, his infinite
wisdom inatender babe that could not speak, his whole omnipote^cy in those
weak and feeble members.

Gather hence fervent desires ^o adore and serve, as the Blessed Virgin did,
this thy Lord and Creator, seeing he debased and ^umbled himself so much for
thee so vile a servant of his, because by thus offering thy self to serve him,
body and soul, and with all thy ability and power, he will most willingly
accept of this thy good will, and give thee grace to effect it.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider the joy, de^otion and ^eares of the Blessed Virgin, and the care,
and diligence wherewith she did perform w^atsoe^er apper^^i^ed to the service
of her Son, and Lord* She swathed him in a poor, yet clean and handsome
swathingbandes and clothes, such as she had. She with most tender love, and
incomparable joy embraced him, she gave him a thousand kisses of joy, saying:
My King, my Prince, my love, my Lord, and my God, and forthwith laid him down
in the manger.

Ponder how this Blessed In^ant, though he speaks no^ a word, does
notwithstanding from the manger, as from out of a chair or pulpit, teach and
read unto thee a lesson of Poverty, and neglect of what^oeuer is in this world:
for he being ^ most mighty and potent King, bat^ ^euertheles no other throne or
plac^ but only a stable, and in lieu of rich and costly hangings, and cloth o^
gold, the spiders webbe^, and hi^ bedding straw and hay, instead of the softest
and warmest feathers.

Gather hence confusion and shame, for that thou do always desire, procure,
and seek for thy self whatsoever is best, whereas Christ our Savior did
always for himself choose whatsoever was worst: as to be borne, be choose a
stable a most loathsome place, an abode of brute beasts: to dye he made choice
of an infamous place, appointed for the excution of (...) and malefactors: for
to be borne he selected a small and silly Village, and the dep^h of midnight,
when no body might see him: to dye be appointed the midday, and the gre^test
and fairest City of the world. When he was to be borne in Bethle^m, ^e
ordained that there should be great concourse of people from all places of
Judea, who at that time were there assembled to have their (...) and families
enrolled, once a year^, (...) to the custom, and the Emper^^^ command of eu^ry
ones (...), which might be an (...) that his Mother and S. Joseph should not
f^^d any lodging or commodity for his birth, and when he was to die that the
City of Jerusalem should be full of people, that it might be unto him an
occasion of more infamy. To conclude, if this our Lord his election, choice,
and judgment of things be always best, as doubtless it is, it behooves thee
in imitation of him ever to make choice of the worst for thy self, flying
whatsoever tends to thy honor and estimation, and embracing whatsoever may
be for thy dishonor and contempt.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider, what this B* Child has in heaven, as he is Almighty God, and
what in the stable, as he is man, and who he is in both places.

Ponder, how this poor little Infant who is here lodged in so vile a cottage,
and reposeth in a manger, is a God of infinite Majesty, whose seat is heaven,
whose throne are the Cherubims, whose servants are all the Angels, and whom
all do adore and serve. This babe is the universal Lord and eternal word in
all things ^quall with the other two divine persons, who afterward was so
glori^usly transfigured on the mount Ta^or between Moses and (...), and ^ho
in the day of Judgment ^^all sit (...) a throne of Majesty, amiddest the ^ood
and bad. He, the very same, ^ow in this his entrance into the ^orld, lies in
the cribbe, in a hard and abject manger, between two ^^ute beasts, preaching
and saying ^^to thee, not by word of mouth* ^ut of spirit, not with many
speeches, ^^t with deeds: Learn of me, be^use I am meek and humble of ^art.
^^hold, how even from my cradle ^till my dying day, I have chosen (...) my
inseparable companions^ po^^ty, contempt, sorrowe^ and affli^^ons.

Hence may thou gather, th^^ ^ing God himself, so great ^ Lord ^ame for thy
^ake so little, tho^ ^st also endeavor to humble (...) and to become little,
for vnle^^^ (...) become as this little one, tho^ (...) not enter into the
Kingdom of heaven.

THE X. MEDITATION.
Of the joy which the Angels and me^ (...) the Nativity of the Son of
Almighty God.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider what passed in he^uen at such time as Christ lesus our Lord was
borne o^ earth. Then the eternal Father gau^ commandment that all the Ange^^
should adore him (as the Apostle S^ Paul says) and all of them singing i^ in
the air, Hymns and Praises (...) this newborn King, adored hi^ with most
humble and profound (...) ^erence, acknovvledging that litt^^ ^^be to be the
only begotten Son^^ of the eternal Father, the King (...) Lord of heaven and
earth.

Ponder how much this (...) of the Incarnation of the diu^^^ world, was for the
glory of Almig^ty God: for in regard thereof, he (...) glorified by all the
celestial Spirit (...) in heaven and earth, who like ^^to so many flakes of
most white how did descend from above as it ^ere a ladder from heaven to the
^ittle porch of Bethleem, and in to^en that they did acknowledge him or their
King and Lord, they kissed ^is sacred feet.

Gather hence a great joy to see his sovereign King adored by his ^oly Angels:
and he heartily grieved ^o see him so much forgotten and ne^lected amongst men,
yea, so hei^ously offended by them. Beseech ^im that thou may not be of the
n^u^er of those ungrateful persons, but ^aist glorify and adore his most holy
^on on earth as the Angels did, and do ^lwaies in heaven.

THE 2. POINT.
To consider how the Eternal Father did manifest the Birth of (...) ^ost holy
Son to the shephearde^* ^ho were watching over their (...) ^n the night time,
sending his (...) bring them the happy (...) and to declare so high a (...)
unto them, of which company (...) approaching near unto them, said^ Rejoice,
for behold I show vn^^ you great joy that shall be to all the people: because
this day is born^ to you a Savior which is Christ out Lord in the City of
David. And this shall be a sign to you, You shall find the infant swathed in
clou^s, and laid in a manger And presently thos^ heavenly spirits brake forth
into ^ ^olt divine melody, manifesting thereby the singular content which they
received, and said: Glory in the highest to God, and in earth peace (...) ^^en
of good will. The shep^eardes ^earing this so happy news, wit^ great desire
and love invited one another to seek out him ^home they he^rd so much praised,
say^ng: Let us go to Bethleem, and let us see this word that is done, which our
Lord had showed to us.

Ponder the admiration of these ^oly sheepheards, when following the direction
of the Angels, they found ^ll to be so as they had told them, (...) were they
greatly ^stonished to se^ (...) so (...) and base, (...) (...) poor stable, an
ox, an asl^, and a ^anger should be the signs to find out the Lord of
Majesty. But far greater was the admiration which this very same caused in
the holy Prophet I say, foreseeing in spirit ^ong before these shepheardes, and
^his great God and Lord so little, and ^o much humbled; wheresore he said: Who
ever beard such a thing? and who has seen the like to this? God ^n infant,
God in swathing bande^. God to weep? a thing so un beseemin^ ^is Majesty and
greatness, a thing so ^trange, a work that does ama^^ (...) ^stonish the
indgements of men and Angels.

Gather hence desires to be h^mble and lowly, as God Almighty vouch safed to
humble himself: for he manifested himself freely an^ of his own accord to the
humble shepherds, but not to prou^d Scribe^ and P^arisies. He is willing (...)
found of those who carefully (...) over their own souls, but (...) those who
are over whelmed (...) ^yed in the dead sl^ep of (...) a care therefore to
watch and pray, ^ thou shall find our Lord as these shepherds did.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider the great desire which these holy sheepheardes had to bring home
with them to their cottage and cabins (if they could have obtained so much)
those lights of the world, the Son and the Mother, seeing them so solitary,
poor and unprovided of all human means to serve and cherish them as far a^
their small forces and ability would reach, in token of gratitude for the high
favor which they had received of them when they disclosed and manifested
themselves unto them.

Ponder that for the finding out of Almighty God, is not required, ^ither a
sharp wit, or a good understanding* much learning, or great parts; neither will
he be found by such, if together therewith they seek honor and vain glory,
and not God alone: but he is sooner found out by an humble Cook or servant in
Religion, or by a poor and simple swineheard, and does most bountifully
communicate unto them his celestial gifts and favors, as the Holy Ghost
himself testifies in the Proverbs.

Hence thou may gather desires to seek Almighty God with true love and
diligence, that thou may also find him as these silly sheepheards did.
Beseech him that seeing he is the sovereign shepherd and thou his sheep,
marked with his own most precious blood, he will vouchsafe to take from thee
all presumption and pride, which is the disease and infection that does vvast
thee away, and make thee so lean: and that he will show thee, as he did his
holy and chaste Espouse, where he ^eedeth, where he lies in the midday, to wit,
in the manger: that seeing thou have made thy self a beast through sin, thou
may find him in the stable, a place proper for beasts.

THE 4. POINT
To consider that the Eternal Father sent this multitude of Angels to honor
his only Son, who had ^ ^uch humbled himself for his love: and to teach and
instruct us by their (...) ample, what infinite thanks we owe unto God for so
sovereign a benefit as he now had bestowed upon us, in giving us his best
beloved Son, not only as a Savior, King, or Lord, but (which is more
wonderful) as our Brother, our flesh, and blood.

Ponder what care the Eternal Father ever had to exalt his most holy Son,
when he did most humble and debase himself, as is to be well seen both here,
and in all other passages and mysteries of his most holy life. He was
Circumcised, and a Name most honorable and most glorious was given to him, to
wit the name of IE ^ US. He was Baptized, and the Heavens were opened for him,
the Holy Ghost descended upon him, and the Eternal Father honored him,
saying: This is my beloved Son. He was Crucified between^ two thieves, and
presently the heavens grew dark, the earth quaked, the rocks rent, the dead
rose, all the elements altered: Finally he was acknowledged of his enemies for
the Son of God.

Gather hence a great and earnest desire to employ thy self wholly all thy life
time, in honoring and praising so good a God, and he will have care to exalt
and honor thee, as he had of his most holy Son, who humbled himself so much
for his honor and glory. And so doing thou may also sing the Hymn of the
Angels with the like spirit and devotion as they did.

THE XI. MEDITATION.
Of the Circumcision, and of the Name Of JESUS.

THE 1. POINT.
To consider, how God Almighty having sent his only (...) into the world in
habit and likeness of a sinner, he was not conte^^ to take only upon him
humane Nature, and to seem less then the Angels in our mortal flesh, but
^ould also on the eight da^ after his mo^^ holy nativity, subject himself ^o
the Law of circumcision, which was the badge of a sinful child, and shed not
only tears from his eyes, but also sacred blood from out his veins.

Ponder, how great love toward us he does daily discover, for he cannot endure
that his suffering for our weal and remedy should be any with delayed, though
those who were to see him Circumcised, might judge and account him a sinner, as
taking upon him the mark and badge of a sinner.

Whence thou may gather very great confusion, that being so great a sinner as
thou art, thou will not seem to be accounted so, but rather just, and a very
Saint, and to that end often excusest thy sins. Wherefore thou must humble
thy self, and give thanks unto this thy Lord, who has so wonderfully humbled
and sought to hide himself. Beseech his divine Majesty, that as he subjected
himself to carry upon his tender shoulders ^he old Law of Circumcision, so
hea^y and painful, thou may likewise carry, and have before thine eyes, and
in thy heart, the sweet Law of his divine Commandment: and that he will
vouchsafe to season it with one drop of his most precious blood, which he so
liberally shed upon the ground, to the end it may loose all the hardness, and
distaste which it has.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider, (...) is Gods will and pleasure, tha^ (...) Circumcise thy self
spiritually (that is) that thou cut off all superfluities in pampering thy
flesh, in honor and commodities of this world, Circumcising and mortifying
thine eyes, not suffering them to behold that which is not lawful to desire;
circumcising thy tongue, making it to keep silence, from vain and idle words:
Circumcising thy taste, that it feed not it self with glutt^nies and delicacies.

Ponder in how much need tho^ stand of this Circumcision, how much thou art
given unto thine ow^^ ^ill, and (...) much it ^^hoouet^ ^hee, allwaies to carry
in thy handes^ that is, in all thy actions, the knife of Circumcision.

Gather hence also a great and earnest desire, to suffer willingly, and that
others both Superiors and Inferiors may circumcise thee (if thy self should
be remiss and slack therein) and help thee to cut away whatsoever may hinder
thee from coming unto this thy Lord, whether they do it with a good (...)
intention, bearing it patiently, (...) they shall deprive thee of thy delight,
honor, pleasure and content, even to she sheading of thy blood for him, who
first has shed it for thee.

THE 3. POINT.
TO Consider how they imposed upon this child the Name of Jesus which is to
say, Savior of sinners: as one who was to deliver them not only from all
evil, but also to bestow upon them most excellent favors and riches, that
their remedy and salvation might be most abundant.

Ponder that this glorious Name ^as imposed upon him (...) greater honor. For
his Eternal Father seeing him so humbled and marked with the badge of a
sinner, would that he should even then be exal^ed, and have given him (as S.
Paul says) a Name which is above all Names, that is JESUS. And whereas our
salvation was to cost him the sheding of his most precious blood, he gave leave
to whatsoever instruments were fit for the drawing of blood to work their
effect upon him: to the knife at his entrance into this world, and at the end
thereof to the whip, scourges, thorns, nails, and sp^are.

Hence thou may gather affections and desires to adore and reue^ence this
^ost holy, and most sweet Name of JESUS, having it always in thy mouth and
heart, thereby to obtain victory over thine enemies. For the Devils do fly
from this holy Name, and the infernal powers do tremble at it, and by it and
in it, sinners have their hope and confidence, because JESUS is as much to say,
as Savior. And if to save thee and truly to bear that Name, cost him so
dear, as the sheding of his most precious blood, and the spending of his life
for thy sake; what is it meet thou should do for thine own salvation? And
seeing all is but little, though it should cost thee thy very heart blood and
life, say unto him with the Prophet: My heart is ready, o God, my heart is ready
so to do, so that thou vouchsafe to make me partaker of that sacred pledge.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider, how the Circumcision bsing performed, and the knife of grief
having pierced the tender flesh of thy Savior, they restored him unto our
Blessed Lady all bloody, and the tears trickling down his cheeks.

Ponder with what grief of heart, with how many tears gushing out of her eyes,
this most B. Virgin received her beloved Son, endeavoring to comfort him,
taking him in her arms, laying him at her virginal breasts, giving him to
suck of her most pure milk, and saying: O spouse and King of glory, how dear
does the sin of ^dam cost thee, how soon do thou perform the office of a
redeemer, suffering pains and ^heding thy blood for mankin^.

Stir up in thy self a desire to accompany this Blessed Virgin in her tears
and good offices toward her Son. And shedding abundant tears of
compassion, bewail thy sins and offenses, that thou may obtain pardon of
them. And render unto Christ our Savior most humble thanks for the blood and
tears which he shed for thee; avoiding hereafter to increase his pain with
other new offenses. Beseech the B. Virgin to obtain for thee grace of her most
holy Son, that at the entrance and beginning of this new year, thou may
renew thy life, forsaking and casting off thy old garments, wherein thou have
been hitherto wrapped, to wit, thy lukewarmnesse, sloth, and negligence in thy
spiritual exercises: putting on from hence forwards fervor, love, and
charity toward God and thy neighbor.

THE XII. MEDITATION.
Of the coming of the three Kings, and of their gifts.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider, how the same day on which Jesus Christ our Savior was borne in
Bethleem, he sent to these Kings or Sages a new and most bright shining star,
giving them thereby to understand, that the true King and redeemer of the world
was borne in Jury: and they illuminated with that heavenly light, and inflamed
with divine love, much rejoiced at the sight thereof, congratulating and
iouiting one another to go and adore that true King of Kings: and forthwith
leaving their Coun^^ey they went with much content and joy to seek Christ
Jesus in a foreign Land, and to behold with their corporal eyes, whom they
had already seen with the eyes of ^ayth: knowing very well how blessed those
eyes should be, that should behold him.

Ponder how great the devotion was of these Kings, which moved them to leave
their own Country, to vnderta^e so long and so dang^rous a journey, and to
break through so many difficult^es, which they might well imagine would befall
them herein: whereas many though they be no Kings, because they will not
deprive themselves of their co^modityes and undergo some small difficulties
for the love of God, will not so much at set one foot before another for his
service, and so do not find him. And it falls out oftentimes, that those who
are very fa^ from Christ do b^ little and little draw near unto him and find
him, as may be seen by these holy Kings: and that those who be near at hand,
are cast back and left of Almighty God for their ingratitude, as it happened
unto Herod, and to those of his Court.

Gather hence a lively (...) to seek, find, and adore this great King and
sovereign Lord of all (...) as often as thou shall see the star of his
divine inspiration, to wit, the voice of the Superior, and the rule of thy
profession, following it with great alacrity, though it bring thee to the
stable, because there thou shall certainly ^ind Almighty God.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how the Kings being come to B^thleem, the star stood over the
place where our Savior was borne, and sparckling cast forth bright beams of
light, as it w^r^ saying unto them: Lo here he is, whom you do seek. And
entering the place they found the true Lamb of God, who takes away the sinne^
of the world, reposed in the arms, and sucking at the breasts of his B.
Mother. Who illuminating their understanding with a celestial beam of divine
light, discovered unto the^, how that little babe though in exterior show the
most poor and contemptible in the world, was true God and Lord of all.

Ponder the goodness and mercy of this our Lord, who vouchsafed (...) impart the
faith of this sacred Mystery of the incarnation, in such plenty, unto the
Gentills; and communicated himself unto them so gratiou^^y, as to call them
unto him, though they had no knoledgh at all of him before; to seek them out
in so far Countries, though they lived without thought of him, and to call as
it were at their doors, and e^ter into their hearts, as if he had need of them,
and not they of him.

Hence thou may gather that he has often done the same to thee* for thou
being neither able to desire him, nor to taste of any such matter* he has
sought, called and chosen the^ even when thou were most carrelesse of him and
did fly away from him. Be therefore thankful and serviceable toward him
for it, as these holy Kings were. And if thou have nothing else to offer, take
all thy sins together, and with hearty sorrow and repentance for thine
offenses committed against this thy Lord God, offer them up unto him, that they
may be consumed with the fire of his divine charity, and thy soul remain
perfectly clean and pure from them all.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider, that albeit these holy Kings saw this poor infant lodged in a
vile stable, ^rapped in poor^ rags, laid in a ^ard manger, so dest^^^te and
fors^ken of all humane help and comfort; yet they steadfastly believed that he
was the true King and Lord of heaven and earth, and forth with c^st their
Scept^r^, and Crowns at his feet, and prostate on the ground with great
humility and reverence, ^dored him, and offered him gold as to their King,
Incense as to their God, and myrrh as to a mortal man.

Ponder that as these holy Kings offered unto this heavenly King and Blessed
Infant, these three mystical gif^es, so were it meet thou did offer him
whatsoever thou have received from his most bountiful hands. And prostr^^ing
thy self before him, and adoring him as thy King and Lord ^ith fervent love,
in lieu of gold, would offer unto him all the riches and goods of the world:
so that if they were thine, thou ^ouldst most willingly lay them at his feet.
In lieu of Incense, all the smoke and vanity of the honors and glory which the
world can affoard thee. And instead of myrrh the delights and pleasures of the
flesh, wholly and most vv^llingly renouncing them, and desiring not to have or
enjoy them, although they were offered thee.

Hence thou may gather great ^onfidence in the liberality of this Sovereign
Lord, that he will r^ceaue this thy Present, and return thee abundance of
spiritual riches for the poverty which thou have promised him: Victory over
the Pa^^^ons and thy flesh, for the vow of Chastity which thou have made unto
him. And for the vow of Obedience, his divine love and grace, that thou ma^st
always keep his hol^ Law, and C^mmandements. And ^hou ma^st offer thy self up
w^oly and entierly (...) every thing to thy Lord God, as ^^ese holy Kings his
disciples did offer themselves, and all that they had.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider, that after the offering was made, before the holy Kings took
their journey homward they received answer in fleep, that they should not
return to Herod, nor the same way they came.

Ponder that after thou have once found God, and dedicated thy self to his
service, thou ought not to do as thou were wont to do before, nor walk in
those rough and crooked paths which before thou d^dest tread: but must change
thy course, embracing humility, and detesting pride, casting away anger, and
reioy^ing in patience etc.

Gather also hence how necessary it is for thee to withdravv thy self from all
vice and sin, which lead thee headlong into hell, and to follovv and embrace
all manner of virtue which will bring thee to heaven, as the holy Kings did.
For so doing Almighty God, who is the true light and way which leads to life,
will illuminate and guide thee, as he did illuminate and guide these his
servants, and fill thee with the like gifts of his grace, with which he did
replenish them, if thou dispose and prepare thy self to receive it, as they
did.

THE XII. MEDITATION.
Of the presentatio^ of the Child JESUS, And of the Purification of our Blessed
Lady.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how the most B. Virgin, though after the birth of her dearest Son,
she remained more pure and immaculate then the stars of heaven, did not
withstanding subject her self to the Law of the Purification, not being
oblige^ thereunto; yea though in some sor^ (...) were prejudicial to her
honor. Wherefore as if she had been li^^ to other women unclean, commi^g out
of the stall of Bethleem, where she was delivered, in company of her Spouse,
(...) ^arryed her only begotten Son to the Temple of Ieru^alem, there to
present him to the Eternal Father, and to offer sacrifice for him.

Ponder how different this entrance and obligation is, which the Son of God
this day makes in the b^ginning of his life, from that which he made in the
end of the same: for no^ he enters into Jerusalem borne in the arms of the
most Blessed Virgin, but afterward he shall enter a foot carr^ng the Cross
upon his sholders whereon he i^ to be crucified. To day he enters to be
offered in the arms of Holy Simeon: then to be offered in the a^mes of the
Cross. To day he shall be offered and redeemed with five ^icl^s (a cert^in^
co^ne of that time) then as Rede^mer, ^ill (...) for the lou^ of men, to be
whipped, crowned with ^hrones, na^led an^ cru^if^ed upon the Cross, and to a
most painful and (...) death.

Ga^^er hence great and earnest desires to off^r thy self, togea^^er (...) thy
Lord unto the Eterna^l Fathers; always to execute his most holy will, and to
carry thy Cross and the adversities which befall thee, after his most Holy
Son: seeing that he and his Blessed Mother being most innocent and most pure,
submitted themselves to the law of sinners, as if they had been themselves
also sinners, with such, and so heroical acts of humility. And be ashamed,
seeing thy self so foul and so abominable a sinner as thou art, to be so
proud and haughty, desiring to be reputed and regarded of all as pure, holy,
and just.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider the spirit and devotion where with the Blessed Virgin per^ormed
this obligation or offering ^or all manking to the Eternal Father. And in
imi^ation of her, offer ^hou also unto our Lord the sacrifice ^f his Son in
remission of thy sin^. ^or it is better, and more grate^ull ^n his sight, then
were all the sacrifices ^xhibited in old time by the Patri^rches, and Prophets.
And if Almigh^^ God had respect to Abell, and to his gifts, how much more will
he respect the Blessed Virgin, and that B. Lamb her Son which this day she
offered unto him.

Ponder the little spirit and de^otion where with thou make thine offerings in
Mass and Commu^ion* not offering to the heavenly Father, his Eternal Son
with such devotion and thanksgiving (...) it behooves thee to do, in regard
that he h^th given thee him for thy Redeemer and Master, yea which is more to
be admired, has delivered him into the hands of death it self for thee and
for thy sins.

Stir up in thy self affections of devotion with a great desire of a^e^dement
of thy life: beseeching ou^ Lord to accept this thy offering. For though on the
one side in regard o^ thy self who do make this offer, thou may justly
fear to be reiecte^ as thou deseruest; yet because he dot^ also make offer of
himself for thee trust, and have great confidence th^^ thou shall be admitted,
and have the (...) forgiven thee.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider that although at the same time at which the Blessed Virgin our
Lady entered into the Temple with her most Holy Son in her arms, there were
many more of all sorts and conditions, Priests and learned men, noble and of
the vulgar sort, yet to Simeon, and Anna the Prophetess only, God imparted his
heavenly light to know the Savior of the world, in reward of their good life,
and holy desires.

Ponder first with what fervor and alacrity that Holy old man Simeon came with
stretched out arms to receive his Savior, and said as we may piously believe
unto the B. V^rgin: Give me, O Virgin, your only Son, for he is my God, and
Lord: he i^ the desired of all Nations: who is to pay for my trespasses and
sins: who must open me the gates of heaven, and who must save me.

Ponder secondly, when this holy old man said these, or the like words, what
^loods of tears trickled down his venerable cheeks? What thanks and praises
did he yield unto him who had reserved him for so great a favor? How tenderly
did he embrace the infant in his arms, saying with the Espouse in the
Canticles: I have found him whom my soul^ loves: I hold him, neither will I
let him go.

Gather hence the like longing dsires to receive thy God, and to place him
within thy very bowels, and to put him with the Holy Espouse as a seal upon
thy heart: for so doing thou may justly hope that because he is faithful in
his promises, though he stay a while, he will come as last and comfort thee, as
he comforted Saint Simeon in reward of the fervor and devotion wherewith he
served him in his holy Temple.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider, that this Holy old man Simeon receiving the child in his arms,
made oblation of him to the Eternal Father, for that he had a very great
desire to see Christ our Lord in mor^all flesh, and Almighty God had made him
promise thereof. And not only this his desire of seeing him ^as fullfilled, but
also it was g^aunted him to tak him in his arms, to kiss and embrace him, and
to understand by revelation of the Holy Ghost that within that little body was
included all the grea^nes, Majesty, and immensity of Almighty God himself.

Ponder, that God Almighty is not wanting in performing his promise: but rather
does perform more then he promises: whereas the world, the flesh, and Devil
contrary wise, do promise that which they cannot give us, they promis^ that
which is good but perform that which is evil, they promise pleasurs and
contentments, and give disgust^ and sorrows, finally in lien of lif^, they
bring eternal death.

Gather hence an ^^flamed desire, with this Holy old man S. Sim^^ to have in
thy arms this most sweet babe, the heir and King of the world, the only
begotten Son of God, the eternal weal and salvation of m^^kind, the sum
of all happiness, the Author of thy everlasting bliss, seek, crave, and sigh
after this: for if it be granted thee, this alone will abundantly supply all
other wants, and fulfill thy desires.

THE XIIII. MEDITATION.
Of the flying into Egypt.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how King Herod, having understood by the Sages of the birth of
Christ our Savior, King and Lord of the whole ^orld, fearing least he would
take from him the Kingdom which he had usurped, determined to seek him out,
and to make him away, though he knew by the Holy Scriptures, that he was to be
at least a great Prophet sent by God for the salvation of the world.

Ponder, how soon our Savior Christ begins to be persecuted: for he was
scarcely borne, when presently Herod sought his life, the Eternal Father so
ordaining, that his most Holy Son and his Blessed Mother should from their
infancy walk the way of persecution and affliction: which ought to be a great
comfort unto thee, if peradventure thou see thy self persecuted in regard of
thy virtue: remembering that which our Savior Christ said to his Disciples: The
servant is not greater then his Master, if they have persecuted me, you also
will they persecute. For they hate not those who are of their own crew and
faction, but those who are contrary unto the^ and resist them.

Here, out of compassion lament, and be sorry, that there should be found any
so wicked, and ungracious, as to seek Jesus Christ with intention to kill him:
whereas he comes to give life unto the dead* and an eternal Kingdom of
heaven for a temporal. Take heed lest thou do not the same (which that wicked
King did) through thy sins, for they do seek to persecute and kill him.

THE 2. POINT.
TO Consider how Saint Joseph, being a sleep, an Angel appeared unto him and
said: Arise, and take the child, and his Mother, and fly into Egypt.

Ponder, the punctual obedience of this Holy man, in putting in execution the
divine will: for being a sleep, and reposing (at which time travail is most
yrkesome unto us) he forth with arose, and obeyed in that which he was
commanded, not being scandalized nor troubled with such a nou^lty and sudden
flight. To ^ea^h thee, that in the midst of thy case and prosperity, thou art
to be prepared for afflictions, and at al times to leave thy bed and rest,
whensoe^er Almighty God shall command thee: esteeming it a thing of highest
price, to know and fulfill the divine will, whether it be manifest unto thee by
revelation of God or his Angels, or by ordination of men. For albeit the first
be more glorious, yet in the second is exercised more humility.

Conceive a great desire to obey Almighty God, as Saint Joseph did, because
heerin consists true justice and sanctity, that thou do not reply, not
contradict the Commandment of God in any thing, but speedily fulfill the
divine will: rejoicing ^o subject thy judgment not only unto God, but also
unto men for the love of God.

THE 3. POINT.
TO Consider the small security wherewith Jesus Christ our Savior lives
amongst those of his own Country. For coming to remain with them, they
received him not, wherefore it was necessary an Angel should advise Saint
Joseph to tak the child, and his Mother, and to fly into Egypt, amongst a
strange and barbarous Nation.

Ponder how Christ our Lord being to fly into the desert, he might have gone to
the Country of ^^e three Sages, where he should have been known, r^sp^cted,
and served, be would not do so, but went into Egypt amongst his enemies and
strangers, where he had n^^^her house, nor harbor, nor any maintenance at all,
that by wanting all commodities, he might have occasion of more to suffer.

Gather hence how pleasing it is ^o God, that his elect (especially such as be
Religious persons) remain where his will is they should, and not where they,
guided by their own fansy, desire to dwell: because the true security of the
soul, does not consist or proceed from the place, but from the assistance and
protection of Almighty God.

Consider also, that the Angel said unto Saint Joseph: Be there, t^ wit in
Aegipt, until I shall tell thee: that is, that he should remain in Aegipt
until he should hear further from him: giving therb^ to understand that in
matter of affl^ctions and desolations, and also in whatsoever offices and
employments he imposes upon thee, thou ought not to assign, nor seek to
known the ^ime, how long they are to continue, but must leave this care unto
Al^ighty God, be it little or much, who knows much better what is befitting
us then we our selves.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider how the most Blessed Virgin, as soon as she understood by Saint
Joseph the divine will, being most humble and obedient, sheforth with obeyed,
and fearing to fall into the hands of Herod, and so endanger that precious
Jewel, which was all her riches, not standing upon labors of pains, nor upon
the incommodities of the way, she presently arose, and with all speed took the
Bl^ssed babe in her arms and fled: not regarding that she leaves her
country, parents, and friends, her house, and whatsoever she had there, so
that she might keep and assure that which of her was for more esteemed then all
the rest.

Ponder how the most Blessed Virgin and Saint Joseph travailed all alone that
wearisome way, unprovided of all commodities, in great poverty, upon some
little beast, or ass, carrying a few clothes of the B. child, and some tools
of S. Joseph, the rest he carried on his back. Also what extr^me cold the B.
Virgin endured, being tender, and of a delicate complexion, it being then the
depth of winter. Behold the foul ways and dur^y passages which they met
withal, and finally how after long travail and pains taken, they came into
Egypt, and betook themselves to some poor cottage, unknown and neglected of
the world: but very much co^^orted, for that the Blessed Infant had escaped the
hands of his enemies.

Gather hence a great love to poverty, and to be contemned and forgotten of the
world; and seeing in this world thou art as a wayfaring man, desire to join
thy self with this holy company in their journey, and see if thou can serve
them in any thing. Peradventure the B. Vi^gin will give thee her Son
sometimes to carry in thy arms. O happy art thou, if it be granted unto thee!

THE XV. MEDITATION.
Of the murder of the holy Innocents. Of the abode of the child Jesus in
Aegipt: and of his return into Israel.

THE 1. POINT.
TO Consider how King Herod perceiving that he was deluded by the Sages, to
secure his Kingdom, determined to kill him whom he feared might deprive him
thereof. And because he knew not where he was, and least the child he sought
for, with rage and devilish fury should esccpe him, he commanded all the young
children borne at that time, to be murdered, and execu^ed it with barbarous
cruelty and impiety, to the end Christ Jesus our Savior should not escape, but
dye among them. But it succeeded not a^ he desired, neither was the Tyran^ able
to compas^e his intent, albeit he omitted no diligence for the accompl^shing
thereof: for although all the world persecute us, if God protect and defend us,
we cannot suffer loss of the least hair of our head.

Ponder the griese that our Savior had in Egypt, seeing from thence the
murder of so many Infants for his sake: but on the other side, how he was glad
and rejoiced that by the means of tempora^^ death which passes in a moment,
they obtained life everlasting, which now they enjoy: many of them by this
means being delivered from the danger of eternal damnation, because if they
had not dyed by this accasion, peradventure they might have been of those that
consented to the death of our Savior, and so should have been damned.

Hence thou may gather a great desire to put thy life and death in the hands
of God, endeavoring to confess and manifest him with thy works, though it
should cost thee thy temporal life to gain eternal, as these holy and thrice
happy Infants did.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how Saint Joseph, and the most Holy Virgin with her Son being
now in AEgipt, began to treat with that barbarous people, and to gain their
good wills. And it is credible, that the Blessed Virgin went to assist and help
other women when they needed, and as rich women do call for the poor to have
their assistance, and do give them something for their pains, so it is likly
they used her help.

Ponder how through her good behavior, speeches, and celestial conversation,
the richer sort took affection to this poor Virgin, and also to the child
Jesus, who in like manner was much beloved for his beauty and sweet countenance.

Gather hence how thou ought to behave thy self with strangers, superiors,
and inferiors.

Ponder like wise how S. Joseph did work, and earne daily ^ages, there with to
maintain the Blessed Virgin, and her Son. Make account that the office,
pains, or function wherein thou imployest thy self, thou performest it to
maintain these poor exiled and banished persons: for that which thou do
for thy brethren and nieghbours, our Savior esteems it as done to his own
person; as himself says in the Gospel.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider how after five or seven years were past of this exile in Egypt
(as some Authors say) an Angel of our Lord appeared again in sleep to Saint
Joseph, saying: Arise, and take the child and his Mother, and go into the Land
of Israel, for they are dead that sought the life of the child.

Ponder that at length the persecutor dyed, and the banishment of the Innocent
Child Jesus ceased, whereby thou may perceive that the pains, perils, and
persecutions of this life shall have an end, and the banishment thereof; and
they which persecuted us shall be judged, and their inventions examined.

Whence thou may gath^r al^o, that if thou remain faithful toward God,
and bear with patience the afflictions which he sends thee, for proof and
crown of thy virtue, after the exile of this world, thou shall enjoy and
possess the eternal rest of heaven, which God has prepared for thee.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider the providence of Almighty God in sending presently his Angel, to
bring these so happy tidings to Saint Joseph, and to free him from the
banishement of so many years.

Ponder what confidence he had in Almighty God, and how contented he was,
seeing the care God had of them, and how ready God was to bear his prayer, and
to release him from his doubts, difficul^ies, and cares.

Purpose to have recourse ever to Almighty God in thy difficulties, with prayer
and confidence in him: for thou may securely put all anxious solicitude of
the success of thy ^ff^yres, casting thy self into the hands of God: for in
them (as David says) are thy strong and prosperous successes.

Likewise thou may consider the grief of these of Egypt among whom those
holy Saints had lived, when they were to take their leave o^ them, by reason of
the singular content they received in their vertuo^^ con^ersation, and for that
it is credible that they left many (who were blind and ignorant ever before)
enlightened with the light and knowledge of the true ^ayth.

Gather hence desires, that Christ our Lord never depart from thy soul, but
everlastingly remain with ^hee. Beseech him, as those two disciples did,
saying unto him: Tarry with us because it is toward night, and the day is now
far spent.

THE XVI. MEDITATION.
How the child Jesus remained alone in the Temple of Jerusalem.

THE 1, POINT.
TO consider how that after the most Blessed Virgin with her Son and S.
Joseph had been in the Temple of Jerusalem, and therein adored Almighty God
their Creator, the Blessed Virgin departed toward Nazareth, and S. Joseph
followed some hours after (because the men went not together with the women,
wherein children might go indiff^rently with the one or the other:) and so the
Blessed child remained behind them in the Temple, they not perceiving it.

Ponder how the Blessed Virgin being now come a good way on her journey, stood
expecting her most beloved Son, and Spouse with great desire of their
coming: but when she saw that her Spouse Saint Joseph brought not with him the
B. Child, being much perplexed and troubled, asked him where he was? And he
likewise much afflicted, answered that he though he had returned with her: but
finding it otherwise, they began to lament and weep incessantly: and not
without great reason, for the loss was not small of so great a treasure.

Gather hence two things: The first what grief thou oughtst to have when thou
shall chance to loose Almighty God through thy own default, seeing the most B.
Virgin and Saint Joseph grieved so much, when he absented himself from the
without any fault of theirs.

Secondly, with what diligence thou ought to seek Almighty God notceasi^g,
nor omitting any occasion, but seeking him in all places whersoeuer thou may
have any tidings of him, as the Espouse did in the Canticles when she said: I
will rise, and will go about the City, by the streets and high ways. I will
^eeke him, whom my ^oule loves: For that which costeth us nothing is not
esteemed, and that which is worth much (as God is) must cost us much.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider wherein this most blessed child did spend those days which he was
in the temple from his parents, how he watched and prayed there all the night,
offering himself up to his Eternal Father for the salvation of the world.

Ponder that his bed whereon he reposed all that while was the hard ground, or
some stool or bench in the Temple, and yet thou must have thy bed so soft. His
diet was a little bread gotten of alms, and thou seek delicacies and
superfluities: yea it is more probable he passed all the time without eating:
for of all these temporal matters he made but small reckoning, where contrary
wise thou will that nothing be wanting unto thee, but wilt abound in all.

Hence thou may gather affections and purposes of imitating our Savior, by
embracing the poverty and want of all things: seeing the Lord of them all
endured and suffered in himself so great penury of them. Have also compassion
of his poverty and solitarines, because for thy sake he put himself in these
straits of extre^^ necessity.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider, how the day followin the most Blessed Virgin returned with Saint
Joseph to seek her beloved Son our Lord in Jerusalem.

Ponder with how great solicitude, with what fighes, groanings and tears, and
with how much care she sought him, demanding of all she met, whether they had
seen whom her soul loved: and giving them signs whereby they might know
him, she said with the Espouse in the Canticles: My beloved is white and ruddy,
chosen from amongst thousands. But when no body could answer her demand, she
turned her self to the Eternal Father, with most seruent and devout prayer,
beseeching him not to chastise her so rigorously, if she had committed any
negligence in the service of his Son and her God: acknowledging her self not
worthy to be his hand^ayd.

From hence thou may gather two things: First, that a most certain and
assured means to find Almighty God, is to acknowledge that thou deseruest not
to find him, and perad^enture he has left thee through thine own default,
albeit thou know it not.

The second is, that Christ our Lord is not to be found among the delights and
pamperings of the flesh b^t in afflictions, pains and desolations: not among
kinsfolks and acquaintance, but in his holy Temple, and there thou art to
seek him, if thou desire to find him.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider, how that after our B. Lady, together with her Spouse Saint
Joseph had sought her beloved Son both within and without the City of
Jerusalem, at last after three days, they found him in the Temple it self,
sitting in the midst of the Doctors, hearing them, and asking them, with so
great modesty, with such gsauity and prudence, with so singular wisdom and
eloquence, that all were astonished that heard him, demading of one another:
Who is this? What child is this? What ^isdome is this in so ^eder years? Whose
Son is this child?

Ponder how great joy and content our Blessed Lady received when she found her
most holy Son, and saw him so much honored and esteemed, and her heart being
not able to endure any delay, she entered among the midst of the Masters and
Doctors, and approaching unto him, she speak these moanefull and tender
words: Son, why have thou so done to us? Behold thy Father and I sorrowing did
seek thee. He answered her, That he had done so, that he might attend and
employ himself in the affairs of his Father.

Gather hence a desire, that all thy whole life and endeauours may be employed,
not in the a^rayres of this world, or of self-love, but in those which are of
God, and for God. ^ee ashamed to see how far thou have ^itherto been from
observing this ^duise, and procure from this day ^orward, ever to employ thy
power^ and senses in the service of Almighty God: seeing his divine Majesty
always employed himself in that, which was for thy good and benefit. For by
so seeking our Lord God, thou shall find him, and never loose him.

THE XVII. MEDITATION.
Of the life of Christ our Lord til he (...) thirty years of age.

THE 1. POINT.
To consider, that as Christ our Lord grew every day in years, so likewise he
increased in wisdom and grace with God and men. Not that he properly received
any more wisdom, grace. or sanctity, as he did increase in age, for nothing
could be added to that which he had in these things, because (...) the very
instant of his conception, he was endued with all plenitude of grace^ bu^ he
increased in the exercise thereof giving daily greater demonstration of
knowledge and virtue, or wisdom and sanctity to all the world.

Ponder, how gracious our Sa^iour was in the sight of his Eternal^ Father, and
how pleasing a thing ^ was unto him to see his holy Son, not only in that
height of all wisdom and grace, wherewith he was replenished: but also to see
him to proceed therein in the sight of men to so hig^ a perfection.

Learn to desire to proceed and daily increase in virtue: endeavoring to be
perfect in that state whereunto thou art called, whether it b^ religious or
secular, and be ashame^ considering how often tho^ (...) gone back in the way
of virtue: remembering that (as S. Bernard says in the way of God, not to go
forward is to go backward.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how our Savior for the space of thirty years was ^^biect to his
Holy Mother, and to S. Joseph until he dyed, obeying them in all they
commanded him.

Ponder, who he is that obeys and subeicteth himself, and to whom and in
what things. He that obeys is God, Lord and Creator of all things, whom all
are obliged to obey, and be subject unto. Whom does he obey? Not only the
Blessed Virgin who was his true Mother, but also for her sake obeys Saint
Joseph, who though he were not indeed his Father, yet was he so accounted,
being a poor Carpenter. In what things does he obey? To wit, in mean and
base things, such as are wont to be done in the house of a poor Artificer, as
to saw and hew timber, and other things of the like ^^tture. Be confounded and
greatly ^shamed, considering thy Savior Christ Jesus hewing timber, driving
^ayles etc. and beholding thy self ^ow thou refusest to do such things.

And gather hence that the ex^ellency of a spiritual life consist^th ^osrso
much in doing works which of themselves be glorious (as to preach to govern,
to teach etc.) as in doing those works which God commands us to do, by
means of our Superiors, though of themselves they be but base and very mean.
And b^ ashamed of thy pride, and little obedience, in not subiecting thy self,
not obeying thy parents and Superiour^ for the love of God, even in little
matters, seeing the King of Heaven (as Saint Bernard says) subiecting himself
to the very dust of the earth the Creator of all things to his creatures: and
be ashamed to desire and seek after honourabl^ offices and employments, seeing
Almighty God to exercise himself in things so base and humble.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider how Christ our Lord, until he was thirty years of age, exercised
himself in the trade of a Carpenter: for he was not only called the Son of a
Carpenter, but also a Carpenter, as S. Mark says, And where as he might have
chosen to himself some more honorable employments, he undertook this mean
office, therein to exercise humility, and to be dealt with, as noble and
p^incipall men do deal with mecanicall artificers: that so, the treasurs of
wisdom and knowledge of God, which are all in this our Lord (as his holy
Apostle says) might be hidden from the eyes of the world.

Ponder the rare silence of Christ our Lord, who during all this ^y^e, would
not make himself known, but did so long hold his peace: and being the Wisdom
and Eternal Word of his Father, would not speak, nor make known who he was
by public preaching, until he was thirty years of age, leading in the mean^
while, a life full of poverty, humility and silence, covering his graces and
other prerogatives with rare humility.

Learn by this pattern and example how to keep silence in thy exter^all
business and corporal exercises, if thou art employed in any, imitating Jesus
Christ our Lord, who l^bouring in body, prayed in mind. E^deauour likewise to
conceal the gifts and talents which God has given thee, when there is no
need to publish them: laying first deep root in humility, seeing thy Redeemer
vouchsafed to walk this way for so long time together.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider, how the B. Virgin did profit and benefit her self increasing in
all sorts of Virtues, but especially in Humility, seeing her most Blessed Son
and her God, being wisdom it self, and yet concealed under such signs and
exercises of Humility.

Ponder how our Blessed Lady was ever contemplating and observing him and his
examples, keeping and ruminating all these things in her heart: and calling
them often to mind, she endeavored to imitate her Son, and after his example
to increase in humility, wisdom, and grace. O how contented did she live
having in her company such an incomparable mirror and pattern of virtues! How
joyful was she (...) have him always at her side, to see him daily at her
table: to hear^ his words, to enjoy his presence!

Gather hence a great desire to have Christ our Lord, present and before thine
eyes in all thy works. Beseech him that he vouchsafe never to depart from
thee, nor thou from him, that thou may perform thy actions whith spirit and
life, as his divine Majesty desires thou should.

THE XVIII. MEDITATION.
Of the Baptism of our Savior

THE 1. POINT
TO consider, how Christ our Lord having lived in company of his most Holy
Mother (who was now a widow) thirty years, such a life, as we may ^ell
imagine doubtless to have been more divine then humane, the time being now come
wherein he was to man^^est himself to the world, performing the office of a
redeemer and Master, he came one day to our B. Lady, and with most tender
affection disclosed unto her the whole matter, etc as an obedient son craved
lea^e of her, and her benediction, that he might go and attend to the work of
our Redemption. The Blessed Virgin through the great desire she had of the
salvation of mankind, not requesting him to defer it any longer time with
perfect resignation to the divine will, denying her own will to conform it to
the will of Almighty God, said unto him that which her most Holy Son said to
his eternal Father in the Garden: Let not o Lord, my will, but thine be done:
and embracing her Son and her God most tenderly, she gave him her Blessing
and license, where with he departed, and remained with tears trickling fast
down her cheeks alone, a poor widow, and without her Son.

Ponder the punctual obedience of the son, in thus abando^ing that chaste
dove his Mother, and the pleasant and contented life he led with her, to lead
his life among wild beasts: and the sacrifice of the mother, depriving her
self of such a Son.

Take example from hence and learn of Christ our Redeemer so to love thy
parents and kinsfolks, that wh^^soeuer the glory or service of God shall
require, they may not stay nor hinder thy good purposes and desires, neither
Father nor Mother, kinsfolks nor friends, no nor all the world: procuring, if
they attempt any such thing, to fly from them as (...) domestical enemies: for
so Christ our Savior calls them.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider, how our Savior, as soon as he was departed out of the presence
of his beloved Mother, took his way toward Jordan, where S. John was
baptizing the Publicans and sinners.

Ponder first how poor, how solitary, and how destitute of all company our
Savior goes on his way, and above all, how he places himself in the number
of sinners, thereby to give us another example of humility, and not desiring to
be known besought S. John to baptize him.

Secondly, how great the joy and content of this Saint was, when he knew by the
spirit of prophesy Christ our Lord, how he leaped again for joy as he did when
he acknowleged him in his mothers womb; beholding him there so humble.

Gather hence desires to humble and submit thy self to the very dust of the
earth, not desiring from hence forward, to justify thy self, nor prefer thy
self before others, seeing thy Savior so humble, going to be baptized, as if
he had been a great sinner: and seeing thou art indeed a sinner, desire to use
convenient remedies, though thereby thou be noted and known to be a sinner.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider, how S. John refused to baptize our Savior saying unto him: I, O
Lord, ought to be baptized of thee, and come thou to me?

Ponder the admiration and a^^onishment of Saint John, seeing our Savior so
humble, and those short, but mystical words: Thou come to me to be
baptized? Thou God infinite, Thou Savior of the world, Thou forgiuer of
sins, Thou who sanctifiedst me in my mothers womb, come to me, thy
creature, a vile and silly worm, and thy servant?

Hence thou may gather, that virtue and sanctity consists in humility and
obedience (that is) i^ obeying God and his Vicegerents, (I mean) those which
be in higher degree of dignity, office, age, and ^cience. Also our equals,
giving them greater honor and the better place. And our inferiors, delighting
to subject thy self unto them as if they were thy superiors: taking example
by Christ our Lord, who humbled hims^^fe to much this day, obeying and kneeling
down before his Precursor S. John Baptist to be baptized of him.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider, how while S. John baptized our Savior, the Eternal Father
authorized and honou^ed him most wonderfully, fulfilling the truth of that
saying: Whosoeuet humbles himself, shall be exalted. And to this end the
heavens were opened, and there descended a dove, and rested upon our Saviors
head, to declare his innocence and sanctity that he was the Lamb of God, that
takes away the sins of the world: and a maiesticall and grave voice was
heard from the heavenly Father, saying, this is my beloved Son, in whom I am
well pleased, by whom I am appeased, and reconciled unto mankind.

Ponder, that although Christ our Lord desired to conceal himself, permitting
himself to be accounted but an ordinary man, and a sinner, yet the Eternal
Father manifested his innocence, declaring who he was by a voice from heaven:
for it was not reason that so great humility should pass without te^timo^y of
great glory. And it is the condition of Almighty God to glorify the humble.

Gather hence desires to please this our Lord, humbling thy self, as Christ
humbled himself, hiding and concealing thy self for his love, as he did for
thy example, which if thon do he will have care when occosion shall serve, to
manifest, honor, and exalt thee before God and men.

THE XIX. MEDITATION.
Of the temptation of Christ in the desert, and of his victory.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how that after our Savior was Baptized by Saint John, moved of
his own holy spirit, he betook himself to the desert, as a place ministering
occasion of temptation, there to be tempted; where he performed most holy and
retired exercise, and remained there forty days, and forty nights, neither
eating nor drinking. And this to satisfy for thy riotousnes and delicacyes:
exercising himself in continual prayer and fasting, and other corporal
austerities: living not in company of his Blessed Mother, or of Saint John by
the river Jordan, but all alone among savage and wild beasts, being Lord of
Angels, to humble himself for man, who through sin was become a brute beast.

Ponder, how the Holy Ghost led our Savior into the desert, to challenge the
Prince of darkness to enter into the field, and to fight and vanquish him;
that knowing by experience, what it is to be tempted of the Devil he might
have compassion of those who are tempted, and that with the victory of his
temptations he might instruct thee to withstand and overcome thine with
mag^animity and courage.

Gather hence a very fervent and earnest desire to give thy self to prayer,
fasting and mortification (especially when thou art tempted) according to the
example of this thy Lord, who armed himself for the combat and temptation with
these spiritual weapons, and taught thee how greatly he always esteemed these
virtues, that exercising thy self in them, thou might so obtain victory over
thine enemies.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how those forty days of fasting being ended, our Savior was
hungry, to wit, as he was man, and forth with the Devil was at hand, who
watched and observed whatsoever he did, and under color of pitying him, said
unto him: If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread,
and eat: which he said to try if by this means he might deceive him.

Ponder that the Devil persuades that the stones should be converted into
bread, and not into some other more dainty meat: for that which he pretends
in temptations, is not thy gust and pleasure, for if he could deceive thee by
giving thee a ^edious life full of a thousand bitternesses and disgustes, he
should not give the any contentment at all.

From hence gather, that thou must never be careless how thou (...). uest,
because the solicitude and care wherewith the Devil goes about to entrap thee
is great and continual. For our Blessed Savior was no sooner hungry, but he
was ready to tempt him, thinking to overthrow him. Take heed, for so will he
deal with thee: mark well how much it imports thee, to watch, and pray, (as
our Savior said unto his Diseiples in the night of his so great afflictions)
that thou enter not into teptation.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider how the second temptation was of vain glory, when the Devil in
his own likeness carried our Saniour from the desert, to the pinnacle of the
Temple, persuading him to cast himself down headlong from above, because
much people being below, and seeing so strange a thing, that falling so high be
received no harm, many of them would belieuin him.

Ponder the meekenes of our Lord God, in permitting himself to be carried by
the Devil, without resistance, and concealing for the present his omnipotency,
that the Devil might not know him for the Son of God.

Resolve and purpose firmly, that whenever the Devil shall tempt thee by
himself or others, to vaunt thy self of thy virtues, thou will rather hide
them by common and ordinary behavior and conversation, and cover the interior
and hidden Jewels of thy soul with the precious veyle of Humility. For where
this virtue is, there is also (as the Wiseman says) wisdom, and so by his
divine aid thou may obtain thy desired victory.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider how the third temptation was of covetousness and ambition,
procuring to overthrow our Savior at last by this way, and so he took him up
into a very high mountain, and from thence he showed him all the Kingdoms of
the world presenting th^^al upon condition that falling down he would adore
him.

Ponder the insatiable thirst the Devil has of thy perdition: for he would
give thee the whole world if it were his, so that thou would commit one only
mortal sin against Almighty God.

Gather hence a great esteem^ of thy salvation, with a firm purpose not to do
any thing in prejudice thereof for all the world: for against this temptation
our Lord said: What does it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and
sustain the damage of his soul? Wherefore putting him a way with veheme^^^,
he said unto him: A^^ant Satan, for it is written, the Lord thy God shall thou
adore, and him only shall thou serve. Whereby our Lord gives thee to
understand, that if thou shall persevere in the combat, with his grace thou
shall overcome whatsoever temptation: and the Devil being vanqu^^ shed, shall
depart confounded, and lea^e thee with the crown of victory in thy hands, as
he did (in spite of his craft) in this conflict with our Savior, unto whom the
Eternal Father seat after his conquest, not one Angel alone to minister unto
him in that necessity, but many, to congratulate him the victory, and spreading
the table, they attended on him at dinner, as servants on their Lord and
Master.

Learn hence to confide and trust in God, and he will nourish thee, and remedy
thy necessity, when, and in what manner, it shall be most fitting for thee.

THE XX. MEDITATION.
Of the vocation and election of the Apostles.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how Christ our Savior being to choose twelve men, that might be
the twelu^ foundations, or vphol^ers of his Church, himself in person, not
trusting therein to any other, made choice of them, and called them.

Ponder how absolute and perfect in all points this election of our Savior
Christ was, who being the infinite wisdom that can ^ote (...) made choice,
not of the noble, ric^, and mihty o^ the world, neytgher of the learned and
Doctors of the Law* not because he co^ntemned or despised ^^yther of them, in
respect that himself was more mighty and more (...) ^ut bec^^se he being God
had made himself (...) and of so mighty* Lord was (...) and being himself so
gr^^t, had vouchsa^ sed to become so little in our Nature he chose rather
humble, ^raile, poor and contemptible persons, and such as got their living by
fishing (...) ding of n^t^, that they might no attribute unto themselves, thos^
great gifts and graces which he intended (...) unto them, nor thos^ (...) which
he mea^t to bring to (...) their means. Finally (...) made (...) so miraculous
an election that the (...) of the world might not be (...) to humane force, bu^
to (...) And this was the (...) those whom he (...) those who^ (...) (...) in
three things. First in repres^^^ the violent passions of anger, (...) makes
both for the interior (...) exterior quiet, and repose of (...) and body:
Secondly it consi^^^ in being affable and courteous ^^ardes all, not iniurying
nor using ^^^astful words toward any. Third^^ not rendering evil for evil,
but ^^^rariwise good for evil: And (...) Almighty God calls blessed.

Ponder how Christ our Lord ^^poseth unto us his own meeknes (...) we may
imitate him therein, (...): Learn of me, because I am (...), and humble of
heart. And (...) said it, so he showed it in the ^^dest of so many raging
wolnes, ially at his Blessed Passion, not (...) opening his mouth, not defen.
(...) himself, not repining or dis^^^ thereat.

Learn how greatly it behoo^^^ thee to show thy self meek and (...) toward
all, toward thy Su^^^^, and equals, and inferiors, if (...) desire to be
Blessed and to (...) land of thy heart, and thy passions, and the hearts of all
men, and most of all the land of the living, thy celestial country.

THE 5. BEATITVDE.
TO consider how Christ our Lord calls Blessed those that mourn or weep, not
with corporal tears (as many worldlings do) for temporal losses, of
honors, life, and goods: but such as lament for their sins, and for the
loss of so many souls, which are separated from the knowledge of Almighty
God: where as contrary wise, the foolish world calls blessed those that laugh
and liu^ in mirth and pleasure: but Jesus who is truth it self, says that
they be accursed, because after their laughing, endless sorrow shall succeed:
but happy be those who weep, because their ^orrow shall be turned into (...)
sting joy.

Ponder how much it impor^^^^ thee to bewail thy sins and d^ fects and that
thou have so often (...) God and our Savior, whom thou art to imitate and
accompany in this holy exercise of tears, of whom it is not read (as S. Basil
notes) that he ever laughed, but we read that he wept many times, in the
manger, at the death of Lazarus, upon Jerusalem, and on the Cros^e,

Gather hence a desire to weep with our Savior, and with this consideration
restrain and moderate thy overmuch mirth, rejoicing only in the service of
God, and of our Savior, whom if thou imitate in weeping, thou shall obtain
comfort in those very things for which thou weepest: if thou weepest for thy
sins thou shall ob^^^ne pardon of them: if for the sins of others, thou shall
also obtain pardon foe them; if by reason of the exile and banishment of this
life, thou shall obtanyne joy and comfort, with certain hope of thy salvation.

THE 4. BEATITVDE.
CONSIDER, how our Savior called Blessed those, who humgar and thirst after
Justice (that is) after virtue and holiness of life, endeavoring ever to
increase therein, not after an ordinary manner, but in the highest degree; and
as one that has a great hungar, and most ardent thirst after any thing, who
cease not until he be satisfied, and his necessity fully supplied: for so
our Savior did hungar and thirst, and was never satiated with doing and
enduring evils for our sake: wherefore he said on the Cross, I thirst. And so
to satisfy our thirst, he has given us his most precious blood to drink, and
to satiate our hungar he has given us his most sacred body to eat.

Ponder how much it imports thee to have this hungar and thirst of i^stice
and sanctity, and not of the temporal goods of the world; least that
malediction of Christ light upon thee, when he said: Woe be to you that are
filled, because you shall be hungry: as it happened to that rich glutton, who
does and shall for ever endure an eternal and unquenchable shirst, and not be
relieved with so much as the least drop of water.

Gather hence great confusion and shame for thy negligence and ^oth in the
service of God, and observe how they that hunger after verture and sanctity (I
mean the just) God will replenish the with eternal goods, as the most B. Virgin
said in her Can, ticle: and the floathfull and negligent shall be deuoyd thereof.

THE 5. BEATITVDE.
TO consider that our Savior calls Merciful, not only those that have a
certain feeling and compassion of the corporal and spiritual afflictions and
miseries of their neighbors, not excluding any though their enemies, as Christ
our Lord had of all: but also those who according to their ability endeavor to
help others in their miseries.

Ponder how merciful our B, Savior was, and how he exercised himself all the
time of his preaching, in doing good to all, curing the sick, releeuing the
hungry, reviving the dead, pardoning sinners, instructing the ignorant, praying
for all, and giving them whatsoever he had for remedy of their necessities:
that is* his honor, his life, his body, and his sacred blood.

Gather hence how expedient it is for thee to be merciful toward thy
neighbors, imitating as much as thou can thy Lord and Savior, who is the
Father of mercies: for it thou be hard toward them, God will be hard toward
thee: for he has said, In what measure you meat, it shall be measured to you
again; as it may be seen in the example of the naughty servant that had not
compassion of his fellow-seruant. Wherefore fear, least thou fall into the
hands of Gods justice, if thou forgo mercy toward others: For judgment
without mercy shall be done to him that has not done mercy.

THE 6. BEATITVDE*
TO consider how our Blessed Savior calls Blessed the clean of heart, to
wit, those whose affection is not entangled or addicted to any earthly thing,
and who do not defile themselves with sins: and to such as these Almighty God
does promise his sight, and the knowledge of hi^ divine Mysteries and secrets.

Ponder how Christ Jesus our Lord was most eminent in this purity and cleanesse
of heart: for neither did he ever sin, nor could he sin, in so much that his
greatest enemies could not argue him of the least sin: neither was guile
found in his mouth. And as this our Lord is the highest purity it self, so
also his holy will is, that those who serve him, be pure, not contenting
themselves with exterior purity alone as the foolish virgins and Pharisees
did, but much more procuring the interior: Because all the glory of the
daughter of the King (which is every pure soul, as the Holy Ghost says) is
within.

Gather hence a desire (if thou desire to ascend up to the mount of God, and
enjoy his blessed sight) to obtain not only corporal but also much more
spiritual purity: for it is not fit that the Temple of God should be polluted
or not pure: seeing therefore thou art his Temple (as S. Paul says) and the
Holy Ghost has his abode in thee, endeavor and stri^^ al^ayes to be pure and
clean, both in body and soul, that in thee the beams of the divine light may
appear and shine, as in a very clean and pure crystal glass: for if thou
love this cleanesse and purity of heart, thou shall have the King and Lord of
heaven for thy friend, and enjoy his sight.

THE 7. BEATITVDE.
TO consider how God calls the peacemakers the children of God: for not only
those who have peace in their souls with Almighty God, but those chie^^y who
also procure to have the same with their neighbors shall be the children of God,
and of our Savior, who with special prerogative is called the peaceable King,
and ordained that when he came into the world, his Angels should salute men
with this peace: and made so much reckoning thereof, that he usually saluted
his Disciples with this peace, saying unto them: Peace be with you.

Ponder the innumerable per^ecu^ions and afflictions which Christ Jesus our
Lord sustained to make peace between his Eternal Father and us, purchasing
for us true peace, and she^ing himself peaceable even with those who did hate
him.

Gather hence how behoofull it is for thee, to have peace with thy self and
with thy neighbors. Thou shall have it with thy self, if thou be careful to
break and subdue thine inordinate appetites, attending to the contituall
exercises of mortification^ and vvaging continu^ll vva^re with vice: for peace
is gotten by war. With thy neighbors thou may have peace, if thou
endeavor never to give them occasion of offense or trouble, but rather to
agree and make peace with every one, and so doing though shall be the beloved
child of Almighty God.

THE 8. BIATITVDE.
TO consider how Christ our Lord calls those Blessed which suffer persecution
for justice, that is for ver^ue and sanctity sake; which perse^ution is not
understood to be suffe^ed in one or two things only, but in all kind of
injuries, to wit, in lands, livings, honor, content, life and death etc.

Ponder how our Sa^io^r Christ from his very cradle till his dying day,
suffered for justice and sanctity the greatest persecutions and (...) which
were ever endured, and with the greatest patience that eues any had, and for
the most just and innocent cause that could be, to wit, for reprehending vice
and sin, and for the salvation of souls.

Ga^her hence a great desire to suffer persecution, in imitation o^ Christ:
neither esteem it any wonder since his enemies persecute him, that thine also
persecute thee, but rem^ebring, that if it was necessary that Christ our Lord
should pass through innumerable tribulations and aff^actions, and so enter into
his ovvn^ glory: it is evident that neither tho^^ not any other shall enter into
the glory which is not thine, but only b^ this way of persecuion. Wherefore
animate thy self to suffer persecution and affliction. because our prefe^
tribulation which is momentary and light (as also our life is) worke^h above
measure (as the Apostle ^ait^) an eternal weight of glory in us.

THE XXIII. MEDITATION.
Of thetempest at sea.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider that our Blessed Savior being entered with his Disciples into a
little boat, he fell a sleep, and forth with a great tempest arose on the sea.

Ponder two things: first that if the ship wherein Christ sailed be tossed and
covered with waves, what will become of that wherein the Devil is Pilot (that
is) if the soul of a just and holy person be persecuted and afflicted with
temptations, the soul of a wicked man and of a sinner what shall it endure?
What will become of such a one?

Secondly, ponder how that all those that betake themselves to the service of
God, ordinarily sustain tempests and tentations, for so the Holy Ghost says:
Son coming to the service of God, stand in justice and fear, and prepare
thy soul to temptation. Wherefore many times. Almighty God permits great
te^^pe^tuous storms of temptation and p^rsecutious to be raised against us and
he semeeth to us as if he were a sleep, and neglected us.

Gather hence purposes to (...) the fury of thy temptations, for God will
assist thee, and relieve thee in time of thy greatest need, and deliver she
out of danger, as he delivered his Apostles when they came unto him, and craved
his help and assistance.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how the Apostles seeing all their labor to be in vain, went
presently to our Savior fo^r help, and awaking him said: Lord save us, we
peri^h.

Ponder how our Savior made as though he sleept and did not presently deliver
his Apostles, albelt he saw the danger in which they were, partly that they
might know and understand, how little they could do without his help, and
partly because he would they should call upon him in time of their greatest
necessity.

Ponder furthermore, how negligent thou have been in storms of temptations,
wherein thou have been often tossed, and how sloathfull thou have been in having
speedy recourse to Christ our Lord, and in beseeching him to favor and aid
thee. And hence it has come to pass, that the little boat of thy soul has
been often plunged, and overwhelmed with the waves.

Gather hence purposes to run to God at all times for his help, but especially
in time of temptation and affliction, saying unto him: O Lord deliver me from
this temptation that ^auseth this tempest in my soul, deliver me from this
vice, from this peril and affliction. For if thou call upon him with faith and
confidence he will aid and succor thee as he did his Apostles. And will
command by the virtue of his divine word the blustering winds of thy
temptations and tribulations (which are those that raise these storms in thy
soul) to cease and be quiet, and presently great tranquillity and peace of mind
will follow.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider how Christ our Savior awaking, reprehended his disciples, and
said unto them: Why ase you fearful, O ye of little faith; as if he should
say: I being in your company, you need not fear.

Ponder the love that Christ shows to his Disciples, and how he requires the
like love of them again, and that they trust in him, and fasten the anchor of
their hope in him, for they shall be secure in the midst of the raging and
tempestuous sea of this life, though the waves should riss to the very clouds.

Gather hence a great desire to be a faithful disciple of Jesus Christ our
Lord, and to follow him whithersueuer he shall go, by sea and by land,
mountanes or valleys, and that no peril or payne^ may be able to make thee
forsake his holy company, nor trouble or dismay thee, though thou should
behold thy self (as Susanna did) compassed round about with the waters of
tribulation even up to thy neck, least thou be reprehended by Christ our Lord
as his Disciples were. For if they had reflected and considered, that they were
in the company of Jesus Christ. they would not have feared, nor doubted of his
power, will and wisdom. Even so thou, if thou be Religious, and in his house
and company, in the boat of Religion, cast thy self at all times into his
hands, but especially when thou shall be tempted or afflicted, trusting in him
that he will deliver thee when it shall please him and shall be most for thy good.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider, how Christ our Lord commanded the winds and the sea, and there
ensued a great calm, the vvindes and the sea obeying with great punctuality.
And those that were present meruayling at such power, demanded of one another:
What a one is this, for the vvind^ and the sea obey him?

Ponder the domination and rule which our Lord has over his creatures, and
their punctual obedience toward him in whatsoever be commands them. He
rules over the power of the sea, and does mitigate the moving of the waves
thereof, he brings forth the winds out of his treasures, and when he pleases
in a moment, he calls them in again. He governs the whole world, and
without his disposition there is not moved the least lease of a tree.

Gather hence great confusion and shame* that being a creature of his, yea a
reasonable creature, and^ Christian, and perhaps Religious^ created to obey him
and to serve him, thou do the same so poorly, and do to little obey his
co^mandeme^ts, yea do so often and daily disobey him, and offend him, not
performing those thinger which he commands thee, as if he were not thy
Crea^our, and he who has given thee all thy being which thou have.

THE XXIIII. MEDITATION.
How Christ our Lord walked^^ the sea.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider, how our Savior commanded his Disciples to go into a boat, and
to go before ^m over the water, and he ascended (...) to a mountain alone to
pray.

Ponder first the great esteem, ^ououghtest to have of prayer, since ^ur Lord
that had no necessity ther^, only to give thee example, rety^^ himself for
many hours from company to pray, giving thee to ^nderstand the necessity thou
have of ^ayer, thereby to arm thy self a^ynst such temptations, as daily ^ng
over thy head.

Ponder secondly the griese his ^isciples felt at the absence of their ayster,
for they knew, and did for^ how d^ngerous a matter it was and ^l of peril to
enter into the boat commit themselves to the waters without him, and had
rather have borne him company in his prayer but the virtue of obedience preuail
led: for God is to be obeyed in all things, although it were to undergo some
great danger, and to intermit thy recollection and prayer; for this is to leave
God for God.

Gather hence a great desire to exercise thy self in these two vertue^ in
which our Lord did prove his disciples, to wit, obedience and prayer highly
esteeming them, and making great account of them, specially ^^^ing our Savior
is thy example and thy guide in them both, for he live and dyed in prayer and
obedience And his will and pleasure is, that those that be his, do the like,
thou especialy, if thou desire to be his disciple.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how that Christ o^^ Lord being absent from his Disciples that were
at sea, there arose great tempest, and held them till was almost day, and then
their Lo^^ and Master showed himself unto th^^

Ponder first, how that if Christ our Lord absent himself from thy soul, it
is forthwith tof^ed, plunged and over whelmed with the furious waves of
temptations.

Secondly our Lord does sometimes prolonge and defer his coming until the
morning, as here he did, that thou may fight valiantly against thy
temptations: for as they do increase, so much more does virtue and sanctity
increase by them.

Hence thou may gather a desire always to walk in the presence of God:
beseeching him not to forsake thee, though it be his pleasure sometimes to
prove thee by tempta^ions nor long to defer his favor and aid, but to
return, as he did to ^. Antony, and S. Catherine.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider how our Blessed Savior from the mou^^aine beheld he affliction
wherein his Disciples were, and the need they had of his help and assistance in
^^at danger, and ^^ausing compassion of them, came ^owne to aid and succor
them, and ^alking upon the sea, he made himself known unto them, saying* Have
confidence, it is I, fear ye not.

Ponder first, how Christ ou^ Lord walking on the sea, did not sincke, because
he was Lord of both sea and land, whom all creature^ do obey and serve, man
only excepted.

Secondly, ponder how he said to his Disciples: It is I, fear ye not. that is
to say, I your Father, your aid, your repose, I your joy and comfort in all
your travails, I your way, truth and life. For so he is to those th^^ be good:
but to the wicked who will he say he is* I am the judge that am to judge you, I
the God of r^uenge that will chastise you, finally I am the Almighty that shall
condemn you.

Gather hence a desir^ that our Lord will vouchsafe to visit thee with his
heavenly presence, and speak in such manner to thy heart, whenever thou shall
be troubled and ^fflicted, that when he shall say: It is I, fear not, t^ou
may forth with know him, reverence him, and serve him, love him, and have
full confidence in him.

THE 4. POINT.
To consider how S. Peter seeing Christ our Lord walking upon the sea, befought
him that he would bid him come to him upon the water: and our Lord, seeing that
his petition, proceeded from true love, gave him leave, and the Holy Apostle
walked upon the water, as if it had been firm land, and beginning to doubt
and to sail in his says, he pres^ntly began to sincke.

Ponder, that if thou have faith and confidence, thou shall walk ^ upon the
waters of tribulations and temptations without fear, as if thou should ^alke
upon firm land, but if thou begin to doubt, presently thou shall sincke.

Ponder secondly, how it be^ooueth thee ^ot to enter into the occasions of
temptations upon thy own head, since S. Peter ^ntred not unto the sea, nor cast
himself into the ^ater without the commandment of God.

Learn to call upon God, when thou feast thy self plunged in perils and
affl^ctions, because herein consists all thy good and remedy, and he will
give thee his potent hand, (...) he did to S. Peter, and will bring thee safe
to the happy port of everlasting bliss.

THE XXV. MEDITATION.
Of the conversion of Saint Mary Magdalen.

THE 1. POINT
TO consider the course of the life of S. Mary Magdalen. Before her conversion
she was of light beha^iour, given to company-keeping, and to wordly meerings;
esteeming only that which was agreeable to her own gust and pleasure. She had
neither shame, nor fear of God, nor of men: she regarded not her fame and
rep^tation, nor what people did say of her, but was held for a public sinner.

Ponder that although this woman was so bad as has been said, yet her heart
being once touch^d with the inspiration of Almighty God, she presently withdrew
herself from all occasions, and retired herself from company, betook
herself to r^pentance, and shedding tears of sorrow from her eyes, began to
tear^s and cast away her gay att^re and her Ie wells, which were the snares
where with the Devil held her entangled.

Purpose not to (...) thy conversion when God shall call thee; learn of this
holy peniten^ to reject and abhor those things which were instruments of
offending him, and labor for two things: first (...) to have a ^oly fear, and
distust of thy own fr^ilty, learning to beware by the example of this
Magdalen, who from little evils came to fall into many and grievous sins.

Secondly, to hau^ great con^idence in the mercy of God, at whose hands this
sinner found remedy, and thou also may find the like, if as thou have
followed her in sinning* thou imitate her in repenting.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how S. Mary Magdalen understanding that her Lord and Master dined
in the house of Simon the Pharisy, took an Alabaster bo^e of ointment, and
putting on mean apparel, repaired thither to seeks the health of her soul.

Ponder, how she that was a sinner came to the just and holy: she that was
sick and infirm came to the Physician: the defiled to the Sanctifier: the
last sleep to the good shepherd And approaching unto him cast her self at his
feet, and began to water them with tears, and wiped them with the hair of her
head, and kissed them, and anointed them with a precious ointment, with sighs
and fervent desires of her heart, craving that she might be reconciled unto him,
and (...) the kiss of peace.

Gather out of all this, how necesiary it is for remedy of thy sins, to have
speedy recourse to Christ our Lord, and prostrating thy self at his feet, and
cleaving fast unto them by humble and fervent affection, to power out tears of
compunction, proceeding from the very bortome of a contrite heart. And as S.
Mary Magdalen converted those things which had been the occasion of her
perdi^ion to be instruments of her satisfaction, employing her eyes, hair,
lips and precious ointments and odours, and her self wholly in the service of
God; so thou ought to turn to his service, whatsoever he^retofore thou have
employed in offending him, casting all thy honor and reputation at the feet of
Christ: for there it nothing greater, nor better the^ to cleave fast to the
feet of thy Lord God and Master.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider, what opinion the Pharisy had concerning B. Mary ^agdalen,
esteeming her a sinner, and Christ himself less pure, because he permitted
himself to be touched ^y her.

Ponder, how that those who ^onuert themselves to God, have ^resently some that
murmur against them and censure their actions, but God himself has care to
defend the as he did Saint Mary Magdalen, wh^e he demanded of the Pharisy, if
he did see the woman, and her tears, sighs, and humiliation and confusion:
that considering them well, he mighty blush, and be ashamed of the little he
did toward our Saniour, and the^eby obtain pardon of God.

Thou may gather hence a desire to serve and lou^ God very much, because
these things move his divine Maie^ty to pity, and cleme^cy, and to pardon thy
sins, be they never so great and enormous, as he did pardon this holy
penitent, and of captive of the Devil, set her free and delivered her out of
his chains, and exalted her to the happy and blessed (...) of the children of
God.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider, how that albeit Sai^^ Mary Magdalen had heard from the mouth of
Christ Jesus that all her ^nnes were forgi^en her, and that she was absolved
from all, bot^ guik (...) pain, through the abundant grace which was
communicated unto her, she notwithstanding remained still fixed at her
Redeemers feet, and would not depart from thence until her master said to her:
Go in peace. And she began presently to punish her body, and did great and
rigorous pennanee all her life time, which endured the space of two and thirty
years after.

Ponder, what an one she was when she came to the feet of Christ, and what an
one she departed thence: she came dead, but departed aline: she came a sinner,
but departed holy: she came the slave of the Devil and enemy of God, but
departed the daughter and Espouse of Christ.

Gather hence a desire to do penance for thy sins, for these be the fruits
which this virtue brings: do not presently forget them again, making account
that they are already ^orgiuen thee: because this happy woman and Blessed Saint
did not so. ^mitate her, and although thy sins should have been many more,
and much (...) then here were, though thou have lost the grace of God ^at
oftener, thou may recover it, and attain unto a great degree of sanctity,
above many just which never lost it.

THE XXVI. MEDITATION.
Of the miracle of the sieve Loaves.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how different the piety and mercy of the Apostles is from that of
our B. Savior, for they besought him seeing there was not where with to feed
so great a multitude, to dismiss them, that going into the town, they might
buy themselves victuals. But our Savior perceauing the stendernes of their
mercy and charity, showed the greatness of his own most bountiful mercy, and
sought by himself affectually to remedy that necessity, (...) he did.

Ponder the care which Christ ^ath to supply the wantes of those which serve
him, and how that his will, desire, and pleasure is such, and it pleases him
greatly that thy mercy be not scant or sparing, but great and free: Teaching
thee to lift up thine eyes to heaven and acknowledging that from thence all
good is to be expected.

Gather hence desires to place thy confidence, not in money (albeit all things
obey it) neither in the world, or humane forces, but in the boun^y and infinite
goodness of thy Creator, whose hand (as the Apostle says) is always open to
relieve and give his blessing to the hungry and needy, not only of corporal,
but also much more of spiritual food.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how the Apostles being demanding by our Blessed Savior of the
five loaves which they had, forth with and without repugnance, and with a very
good will they presented them unto him, together with the two fishes they had
in store.

Ponder the great poverty of our B. Lord and of his Disciples, (...) the small
care they had of their own comfort and corporal sustenance, seeing for
thirteen persons, and others which might join themselves unto them, they had
only five loaves, and those also made of barley, which was the most unsavory
bread that then was in use, and peculiar unto poor people; having fed in the
desert that ungrateful Nation with bread from heaven, whereas him self and
his Blessed Apostles were fed with barley bread.

Purpose firmly to choose for thy self such things as Christ our Lord did
choose for himself, entreating thy body with like severity and rigor where
with he treated his, being ashamed from this day forward of thy over much
solicitude in se^king after supersluitie^ and dainties in meat and drink,
otherwise then is pleasing to our Lord, who reproves these things.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider how that our Savior and Lord of all things taking the bread into
his holy and powerful hands, blessed it and gave it virtue to be multiplied
and become better, so that though every one did eat thereof, it was not
consumed, but rather did multiply and increase.

Ponder first, the omnipotency of God, which so easily could convert a few
vnsaucry loaves into thousands, and those most sauory and toothsome bread.

Ponder secondly, the providence of God resplendent and manifest in this
miracle: For whereas those which did eat of this bread were many thousands,
and of different ages and complexions, yet all of them eating thereof, and of
the self same kind of bread, were notwithstanding satisfied, and as well
content with a small portion, as with a great quantity thereof.

Gather hence a great desire wholly to rely and trust on the omnipotent hand of
God: for they can never want, but will increase and prosper always, whose Lord
and God is Christ our Sa^iour.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider how, this heavenly b^aquet being ended, our Sa^iour commanded his
Apostls to gather up the leauings: they therefore gathered them, and filled
twelve baskets with the fragments of those five barley loaves, which remained
after all had eaten.

Ponder the goodness and bountifulnes of our Lord, in rewarding the liberality
and free heart where with his Discipls offered him their five loaves: for he
restored them twelve baskets full of most delicate hr^^d: that they might
understand, that as they were twelve, so he would that the baskets of the
remnant should be twelve, as it were to bestow upon every one of them a whole
basket full for the small part which each of them had renou^ced in the five
loaves they had before presented him.

Gather hence a desire to be merciful and bountiful toward the poor of
Christ, because all those who offer him any thing for his service, he renders
them much more then they gave him: as it is manifest in the mercy he ^vsed with
that widow which ^ed Elias the Prophet, who for a little meal which she had
freely and lib^rally bestowed upon him in the name of God, multiplied the same,
making it to Iuffice for many days. And for one glass of bad wine which was
given unto Christ our Lord at the marriage, wherennto he was invited, he
bountifully rendered six vessels full of most excellent wine. And if this our
Lord dealt so liberally in this life with sinners, giving ^ hundred sold for
one, what will be give in the eternal to the just? Good measure (says S.
Luke) and pressed down, and shaken together, and running over shall be given in
their bosom, infinitely surpassing that which is, or can be done for him in
this life.

THE XXVII. MEDITATION.
Of the Transfiguration of our Lord.

THE 1. POINT
TO consider, that when Christ our Lord transfigured himself and vouchsafed as
it were to make a heaven here upon earth, manifesting his glory and heavenly
beauty unto men, he retired himself unto an high mountain, taking with him
only three of his best beloved and most familiar disciples, to^: place where no
body but only they, might enjoy those divine comfo^^s and favors, which in the
night of his transfiguration he was to impart unto them. Whereas to show
himself disfigured in Mount Caluary, there to suffer a most painful and
opp^obrious death, he would it should be at midday, and in the fight of the
whole world.

Ponder how that God does not bestow these graces and favors (such as was to
be present at the glory of hi^ transfiguration) upon all those that are just
and holy, but only upon the most feruorous, and his best beloved: and
peradventure he took not the rest with him (not because they were less
seruent in his love, neither were they so, but) because Judas was amongst them,
who deserved not to enjoy so great a favor: neither would he exclude him alone,
not to defame him.

Whence thou may gather, how much it imports thee to be feruorous in the
lone of God, and how much harm one bad member does unto a whole community of
good men, being the cause why they are deprived of such savors and benefit^
which Almighty God would do the^, if such a one were not in their house and
company.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider, how that Christ our Lord transfigured himself in praver,
permitting the glory of his soul (which was hidden ^hen and restrained) to
communicate it self to the body, though for all small time.

Ponder how that thy sins were the cause why that most holy body of thy
redeemer, was deprtued all the time he lived in this world of that glory which
he made known in this his transfiguratio^, as also why it as passible and
mortal: and albeit now he admitted that glory, it was but for a very short
space, choosing rather to prosecute the work of our Redemption, and to suffer
and dye with great ^gnominy and shame for men, then here to have rest and enjoy
his glory.

Gather hence two things: firsts desire and love rather of pains and tranells,
and to suffer with Christ in mount Caluary, then to enjoy the quiet of mount
Tbabor. Secondly how it imports thee to be a great lover of prayer, and to
profit therein if thou desire to be transfigured into the image of the Son of
God, for by prayer our life is tran^formed and changed from terrene and
worldly, into a celestial and divine consolati^ion.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider how our B. Savior being in so great glory and Majesty, there
appeared Moses and Elias, and spoke of his death that he was to suffer in
Jerusalem.

Ponder how that the reason, why Christ our Lord made choice of those two
Prophets before many others, and to honor himself and them by this
communication, was, because they were eminent in sanctity, and zealous of the
observance of the Law, and withal very much given to fasting and prayer.

Gather from hence two things: first a great desire of those virtues, which
these Saints had, thereby to be So inward and familiar with our Lord as they
were. Secondly how our Savior in the midst of his joy and ^omfort, did
interpose and mingle ^peeches of sorrow, of his death and Passion, because
whilst he lived on ^arth he would not have one jot of ^est, but all his
delights and pa^times were to treat of suffering and ^ying. And all this to
the end thou should have ever in thy mind his passion, and delight to think
thereon; speaking very frequently and willingly of the same, be ashamed if thou
do not so.

THE 4. POINT
TO consider, how the three Apostles enjoying the glory of the Transfiguration,
Saint Peter desired to remain there for ever: whereupon he said to our
Savior: Lord it is good for us to be here: as if he should say, Let us
excha^ge, O Lord, all whatsoever for this mo^ntaine, let us change all the
goods and pleasurs of the world, for the delights of this desert.

Ponder how that when S. Peter saw his master transfigured and glorious, he
was willing to accompany and abide with him, but at the time of his passion and
of ^fflction, when he saw him apprehended and reproachfully dealt withal, he
fled with the rest. The like happens to thee: for thou continuest no longer
in the service of God, then he does cherish and comfort thee: then thou say
as S. Peter: Though I should dye with thee, I will not deny thee, but perceaning
p^rill and pains to be taken, forth with thou forsakest him, and turnest thy
back saying: I know not this man. And as S. Peter knew not what he said, so
neither do thou, seeing that before thou have taken up thy Cross and taken
pains, thon desire glory and ease.

Gather hence a great love of the Cross and mortification, that thereby thou
may come to enjoy eternally that passing and infinite comfort which is in
heaven: seeing that S. Peter tasting here one only drop of that sea of
delights, which makes the City of God joyful, absorpt, and as it were out of
himself, and un mindful of whatsoever else, to wit, beholding the sacred body
of our Redeemer with that so great splendour and beauty; was so fully satisfied,
that he could have been content to have taken up his rest for ever. But our
Lord deprived him of that transitory glory, to give him the eternal in heaven.

THE XXVIII. MEDITATION*
Of the raising of Lazarus, who had been four days dead.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider, how that Martha and Mary seeing their brother Lazarus sick, sent
unto our B. Savior a brief and discreet letter, ^ontayning these words:
Lord, behold whom thou love, is sick.

Ponder, how that to treat and ^egotiate with Almighty God, many pre^mbles and
flourishing phrases are not necessary: for to him who knows and penetrateth
our heart, few words suffice: and the common saying is, that short prayer
penetrateth heaven, and comes to the hearing of God, as the prayer of these
two holy Sisters did, whom thou must imitate, to negotiate and obtain that
which thou desire, saying unto God: Behold O Lord, he whom thou love is
sick, and seeing thou art the heavenly (...)* cure me. Behold ^old, Lord, that
I am to comfortles, ^uke warm, dry, undevout, tempted with anger, pride and
impatience, and since thou art omnipotent and most ^ercifull, have mercy on me.

Gather hence a great desire, that this sovereign Physician cure and ^^ase thy
soul, and visit and comfort with his divine presence, because it ^^staineth
many sorts of evils and ^firmities.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how that Christ our Lord coming out of Iewry, en^ed into the
house of these two sisters ^here Martha meeting him, said unto him: Lord if
thou had been ^eere, my brother had not dyed.

Ponder first, that if thy soul be ^ead in sin, it is because thou did
^bsent thy self from Christ: for if ^ou haddst not withdrawn and se^arated
thy self from him, no man^er of temptations could have bee^e ^^le to overthrow
thee.

Ponder secondly, that as Laza^s fell sick and dyed in Christ's ab^^ce, even so
when ^ur Lord absenteth himself, and cease to do thee his wonted favors,
and passions and infirmities of tepedity and spiritual weakness begin to bud
and sprout^ forth, and are sometimes wont to end in deadly sin.

Gather hence desires not to depart, nor separate thy self from God because
with his sight and presence al^ evil vanishes, and the health of thy soul is
continually augmented an^ increased.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider, how before our Sau^ our raised Lazarus (as the Gho^^ pell says)
he wept: for it is the property of Charity (as the Apost^^ says) to weep with
them that weep

Ponder how that Christ weepeth and lamenteth, that thereby tho^ might
understand how much (...) ^inne^ g^ieue him, and how great (...) ^^lice of them
is, seeing he wept ^ suffered so often for them, and ho^ great the hardness of
thy heart is, ^ ^ow little thou feel the malice an^ greatness of thy sins,
seeing tho^ do shed so few tears for them.

Ponder secondly, how stony^harted thou art, yea and more then ^stony: for the
stones made as it were ^shew for their feeling, and of their griese at the
death of their Lord, but thou feel not, nor be waylest, because he suffers
for thee, and for thy sins, but when he weepeth for them thou ^aughest, when
he sorroweth for them, thou art joy full and without ^are.

Thou may gather hence a great desire to bewail thy sins with a very
inward grief and feeling, ^eeing they cost thy Savior so many ^eares. If thou
be dry and hardly moved to any tears, anoint thine eyes and heart with his
tears, and by their virtue thine eyes will become ^ou^anes of tears, and be
able to was^ a way and clean fetch out the ^taines off thy offenses and sins
^estoring thee again to the life of grace which thou had lost by sin.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider how Christ our Lord caused the stone which covered he grave, to be
taken away, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, cried with a loud voice, saying:
Lazarus come forth: and presently obeying his voice, he came forth alive, and
whole out of the grave, who a little before lay therein dead, putrified, and
stinking.

Ponder the marvelous vertus of the voice of Christ, by the power whereof he
who was dead came ali^e out of the se pulcher: and it would have been
sufficient to have revived all others that were deceased, if he had not
restrained the force thereof to Lazarus by name.

Gather hence a great desire to rise at the v^yce and calling of Christ, and
that all those who are spiritually dead may also rise, that so sinne^^ing
banished out of the world, h^^nes and justice may raig^e therein, and our Lord
be glorified in all his creaturs.

THE XXIX. MEDITATION.
of the entrance of Christ into Jerusalem upon Palme-sunday.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider the great charity of the Redeemer, the singular joy and content
wherewith he enbreth the City of Jerusalem to offer ^imselfe to death for
thee: for this day ^e would be received with so great ^riumph, to declare unto
thee the content and iubily which was in his ^art, for that the day of thy
redemption did now approach.

Ponder, how Almighty God dif^o^eth and prepares himself with ^reat longing
and joy of mind, to ^ndergoe afflictions and pains for ^hee, whereas when any
thing is to be ^one for his service, or to be suffered ^or his love, thou art
presently affil^ted and discomforted, and flyest away.

Ponder furthermore, how that ^ the injuries, persecutions, ignominies, and
reproaches which our Lord received in Jerusalem were not able to diminish his
great love and charity toward us.

Gather hence an inflamed love and desire to suffer something for thy Lord, thy
eternal lover, seeing that all the times thou have offended him with thy so
grievous sins (which have not been few) have not been able to extinguish in
his divine breast the love be bears thee, and his desire to do thee good,
and to save thee.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider the humility and poverty of the Son of God, who as alvvaies
before, was wont to make his journey on foot, so this day being to enter in
triumph into Hier^s^lem, he chose not to go in coach orin a chariot, but upon a
^illy a^re, which also was another man's: and albeit he entered with so great
humility, yet all the people received him with exceeding joy, solemnity, and
triumph.

Ponder that the cause why our Lord would this day be so magnified and received
with so great honor and applause of all, having ever fled such honors before,
was, that his reproaches and ignominies might be the greater, and his dishonor
the more notorio^s.

Gather hence a great desire to condemn, and abhor all worldly pomp^s and
honors, and to love and ^mbrace the poverty, humility and meekenes of thy
Savior, because if these be the arms and ensigns of thy King and God, they
ought also to be theirs, who esteem themselves his vassals and seruauts.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider, how our B. Sa^iour and Lord of the Angels being mounted upon the
ass, innumerable people by dinine inspiration came to ceceaue him with boughs
and palms in their hands and with voices of laud and praise said: Hosanna to
the Son of God: Blessed is he that comes in the name of God, Hosanna in the
highest.

Ponder how the Eternal Father did honor his most B. Son, not only when he
entered first into the world and was borne poor in Betaleem, sending ^osts of
Angels to solemnize his entrance, and to bring those happy tidinges of glory
to God and peace to men. But this day also when he entered humble and meek, a
multitude of people came to solemnize and celebrate his entrance into
Jerusalem, and his departure out of the world, giving God many thanks and
praises for so great a benefit,

Gather hence a desire to imitate the great devotion where with this people
receaueth their God, and be ashamed that thou come so often to receive thy
Lord and God, in the most Blessed Sacrament with so great vndeuotion and
coldness.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider the devotion and love where with all did spread their clothes and
garments on the ground to adorn the way by which our Savior passed,
accounting it a great happiness to cast themselves, and ^hatsoeuer they had at
the feet of his our Lord, that he might dispose of it all according to his most
holy will; acknowledging that unto hims as to the owner and Lord of all, all
subjection and service was most due.

Ponder the little regard and esteem which is to be had of the glory of this
world, seeing it received our Savior to day with so great honor, and within
few days after it held him for worse then Barabbas, and sought his death,
crying out against him, Crucify, Crucify him. And whom to day it extolled and
termed the Son of Da^uid (that is the Holy of Holyes and the most holy amongst
Saints) to^morrow it reckons the most vile of all men, and treats him as a
ma^lefactour, loading his sacred shoulders with a heavy Cross; on which he was
to be crucified and dye.

Gather hence great compassion and griese to see the Lord of Angels so much
neglected and despised by men, and to seek their honor at so great charge and
cost of his, Desire thou to serve and honor hi^ much more hereafter, and say
(...) him: Behold O my King and my Lo^^ I cast at thy most holy feet, not onl^
all my goods and wealth, but my honor also, my content, my life, my self, and
all: tread upon me, and do with me what thou will: for thou art my God, my
King, and Lord, the head of Angel^ and men, better, and exalted above them all.

THE XXX. MEDITATION.
Of the supper which Christ our Lord made which his Disciples.

THE 1. POINT
TO consider how Christ our Savior sent Saint Peter and S John his Apostles,
to prepare for the legal supper of the Lamb, and how that forth with the
Goodman of the house to whom they were sent, inspired by the Holy Ghost gave
them the best, and best acco^modated room of the whole house.

Ponder the favor which Al^mighty God vouchsafes to do the^ in pdrticuler,
when he entered into thy house, that is, into thy soul, to celebrate therein
his feast and Pasch, and make thee thereby partaker of the merits of his most
precious blood and passion.

Gather hence great sorrow and repentance, for that thou ^ast bebaued thy self
so ill toward so loving a Lord, seeing not once but many times thou have shut
the door of thy soul upon him, and shutting it against his di^ine
inspirations, thou have opened it to the pers^asions of thy enemy the Devil,
whom thou have received and entertained, as if he and not God had been the
owner, and Lord of thy soul. And therefore that which thou ougntest to do, is
to offer him, not only the best room in thy house, that is, thy soul, but
also to give it him wholly: for it is all wholly his. And would to God it were
better then it is, that it might please his divine Majesty to ^ome and dwell in
it for ever.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how that Christ our Lord, the day being come when the Paschal
lamb was to be eaten, would fulfill that ceremnny of the Law, and for the
accomplishing of the shadows and figures of the old law, be sacrificed as the
true Lamb which takes away the sins of the world, at the same time and in
the same place that the mystical Lamb was wont to be sacrificed. Wherefore
our Lord being at the table with his disciples, and all things being prepared
and ready, he said unto them: With desire I have desired to eat this pasch
with you to give you to understand how much I love you: as if he should say*
Very long have I greatly desired this day, and this hour, wherein you shall
see nothing in me but ignominies, reproaches, blows, stripes, wounds etc.

Ponder the great and earnest desire which God had to suffer and to give his
life for thee, longing to be plunged in the bitter sea of his passi^n, and to
encounter with death, expecting it as a thing after which he much hungered, and
took much pleasure and delight in. And this was that which he desired (as he
said) with a great desire, because it was very pleasing to him, and a thing
wherein he received special gust.

Gather hence great confusion and shame, considering thy desires are not like
unto those of thy Lord and God, to suffer and endure something for his honor
and glory, thou being so worthy of all reproach and contempt, but rather thy
desires are to follow thine own pleasure etc contentment, not to serve his
divine majesty, but to fulfill thy own will and disordeded appetite.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider, how christ our Lord did behold and contemplate that Lamb which
he had before him on the table, laid there dead, flayed and ^osted. It is no
question he saw himself represented more innocent then ^ lamb, and how
without any his deserts, he was to be flayed with stripes, and embr^ed with his
own most precious blood, through most cruel torments, and finally to be put
as it were upon the spit, and stretched on the table of the Cross, where, with
the hot burning coals of love, he was to be roasted to death.

Ponder how bitter this supper was unto thy Redeemer, being mingled with sauce
of so distasteful a representation, as was that of his death and passion.

Purpose, when thou sit at table, to mingle thy meat with this ^auce, to
wit, with the consideration of the passion and pains of thy Savior, that thou
be not carried away with the gust and savor of the meat: and that if thy meat
be not good, or not so well dressed or seasoned, or not in such due time
prepared (...) thou would, thou may have patience, and have somewhat to
off^^ unto God, and make thy spiritual profit thereof.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider how the l^gall supper being ended, Christ our Lord gave thanks to
his eternal Father, and did offer himself perfectly and entierly to
accomplish his holy will, as having taken upon him our mortal flesh to be
sacrificed, and dye upon the Cross.

Ponder how pleasing this offering and sacrifice of the Son of God was to the
heavenly Father, in which he offered himself to fulfill in all things the
divine will: for where this perfect resignation is wanting, whatsoever other
sacrifices and holocausts; are not of any value, because we offer not our
selves.

Gather hence an inflamed and effectual desire to offer thy self unto God
with an humble and prompt will, to perform whatsoever he shall command thee,
how painful and difficult soever it be.

THE XXXI. MEDITATION.
Of washing the Apostles feet.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider that Supper being ended, Christ Jesus our Lord arose from table,
and putting off, and as it were despoyling his royal Majesty of his authority
and greatness, humbled himself to be the servant of his servants: and laying
aside his upper garment, himself alone, not admitting the help of any, girded
himself with a towell, took the taukerd in his hand, and put water into the
basin, and washed, not the hands, but the foul and dirty feet of those poor
and silly fishermen his Disciples, and lovingly and tenderly did b^th them,
wipe them, and make them cleave.

Ponder the excellency of the person that performs this so mean and so base
an office, and humbles himself to these things. The Creator of the world, the
beauty of the heavens, the splendor and brighnes of the glory of the Father,
the fountain of wisdom, in whose hand God has put heaven, earth, ^ell, life,
death, Angels and men, power and authority to pardon sins, the salvation and
justification of souls, the glory of the just, and all the treasure of God:
this same our Lord so great in Majesty, abased himself to this act of so great
humility and charity.

Gather out of all this, great confusion to see thy self so proud
notwithstanding that thou art so base a creature. Admire thy haughtiness of
mind, yea thy foolishnes that being most ignorant and most poor and vile,
can be so proud, seeing Christ who is Lord of infinite power and wisdom has
so humbled himself. Our Lord Jesus himself teaches us ^o exercise works of
humility and charity, choosing rather to practice these acts, then to command;
why then wilt not thou do the like, and seriously ^et upon that work, from
which so great profit and abundant fruit is to ^e reaped?

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider, how Christ our Lord being now ready to perform this so humble
and base an office, came first to S. Peter to wash his feet: but the Apostle
was so amazed and confounded, considering with lively faith, the greatness of
his Lord and Master, and together his own bas^nes, that he said with
admiration: Lord, do thou wash my feet! Tho^ being the infinite God and Lord
of all things! And I the most vile and basest of them all! Thou the Creator
of heaven and earth, Lord of the Angels and Seraphims, and I thy creature, thy
slave, a most vile sin^er, and yet will thou wash with thos^ hands, which give
sight to the blind, health to the sick, and life to the dead, not my head or
my hands, but my filthy and abominable feet! This O Lord I may not endure, but
I shall fall dismayed at thy blessed feet. But our Lord saying unto him: Peter
know for certain, that if I wash thee not, thou shall not have part with me:
^his threat was so terrible unto him, that forth with he yielded, not only to
have his feet ^^^hed, but also his hands and head.

Ponder what so high and soue^ raig^e a God does for so low and base a
creature, and what his divine Majesty undertakes himself to do, to make us
humble* esteeming highly of this which Christ does, and meanly of thy self.

Gather affections of admiration, of thank sgiuing, and imitation: propose unto
him the necessity which thou have, that his divine Majesty wash and purify thee
from thy sins, seeing he is so humble and so desirous to do thee this
favor, to the end thou may have part with him: for no creature has this
power and authority of himself, but the only Son of God alone.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider how Christ Jesus our Lord prosecuting this act of humility and
charity, vouchsafed also to do the same to Judas: And prostrating himself at
his feet, as if he had ^eene the Lord and Master, and Christ Jesus the
servant, he washed ^ wiped his feet, with signs of more special love, to
mollify that his hard rebellious, and obstinate heart, and to win him (if it had
been po^^ible) to some good, with this inspeakable humility and charity.

Ponder, and behold Christ our Lord prostrate at the feet of so wicked a fellow
as Judas. And we may piously think that our Blessed Savior, being thus
humbled and prostrate at the feet of this traitor and wretched Disciple, would
with tears falling from his eyes for his impiety and hardness of heart, say unto
him: Come Judas, mv dear Apostle, give me thy feet, for I will wash them and
bath them, and wipe them, even now it being the eve of that day in which my
feet are to be nailed upon the Cross, and washed in my blood for thy sins,
and by occasion of thy treachery. And if thou have any complaint against me,
behold I am here at thy feet, do with me what thou will, upon condition that
thou be^^ray me not, nor offend me no more.

Gather out of this so remarkable an example of humility, two things^ First,
motives of love toward him, who humbled himself so much for thee, and learn
to humble thy self that thou may do good to thy neighbors, although in
regard of their vnvvorthinesse, they deserve i^ not.

Secondly, learn out of the obstinacy of Judas, to be wiser by others harms.
Beseeching Almighty God to take away thy stony heart, and to change it into a
heart of flesh, tha^ thou may feel his divine inspirations, and embrace his
loving examples.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider, how that Christ our Lord, having finished this work of so rare
humility and charity, took his garments, and sitting down again at the
table, said to his Apostles: ^now you what I have done to you?

Ponder this demand, as if our Lord would say: Know you the my^tery which is
comprehend^d in this my deed? and the end wherefore I do it? make account that
God says unto thee, Do thou know what I have done for thee? the benefits
which I have bestowed upon thee? the evils and dangers from which I have
preserved thee? know thou how much I have humbled my self to exalt thee?
Do thou know that I made my self man, to make thee the Son of God? if then
I have washed your fee^, being your Lord and Master (that is) if I have
humbled my self so much, with how much more reason ought you to humble your
selves and exercise all works of humility and charity: specially I having spent
my whole life in giving you so rare and admirable examples of these and other
virtues.

Gather a desire and firm purpose from this day forward to do that which our
Lord Jesus does counsel and command thee. Because humbling thy self thou
shall ever find grace in the sight of God, and thereby be exalted to the dignity
of the son of God.

THE XXXII. MEDITATION.
Of the institution of the most Blessed Sacrament.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider the unspeakable greatness of the love which our Lord bare to
mankind, seeing ^n the very self same night of his pass^on when men went about
to kill him, and to devour his sacred flesh as it were by bits, and suck his
pre^ious blood with terrible torments, disgraces and ignominies, he was
preparing for them this sovereign morsel, and celestial banquet, to make
them partake^s of ever lasting life.

Ponder how neither the con^radictions of the wicked, nor the presence of
death, and of any torments were able to turn his mind, ^or to diminish his
inflamed charity, and make him relent in his love, and purpose of comforting
his elect with this sovereign banqu^^*

From thence thou may gather purposes, that no afflictions, conte^pts or
persecutions, or torments or pains shall be able to separate thee from him, nor
to make the omit to serve him, or to receive him often in this most B
Sacrament: for to this end he has vouchsafed to stay here with us under the
form of bread, which is a meat that all eat off, great and little, poor and
rich.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider the place, which Christ our Redeemer did choose, to institute this
most Blessed Sacrament, which was a great Hall, and comely adorned, offered
freely for his use, by a man whose name is not known.

Ponder how this hall is thy soul into which Christ enters and re^ayneth
there, in this most diuin^ Sacrament, and it imports thee very much to have
it adorned with all kind of virtues, which be the han^gings of the house wherein
God dwel^leth.

Ponder secondly, how Christ our Lord esteems greatly of a ready and prompt
will to re^eaue him, ^ makes no account of the state and ^^les of the world.
And therefore he ^old, that this man's name that gave ^im this house or Hall,
should nor be ^nowne, to signify that he regards ^ot whether he be poor or
rich, no^le or ignoble, learned or unlearned, that is to rece^ue him into his
soul, ^ut only that he offer what he has unto him with a prompt and devout
^ill.

Gather hence a great affection and longing desire to give the self ^holy unto
this thy Lord, offering ^y self willingly unto his service, ^ting though thou
be so miserable, and so vile and base, yet he uses so ^reat mercy toward
thee that he ^ouchsafeth to make thee his house and abode, and to celebrate his
sa^^ed and divine Mystery in thee.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider how Christ Jesus our Lord, whiles he was at supper ^^oke bread in
his Blessed hands, say^^g: This is my body etc. by virtue (...) which words he
converted the ^bstance of the bread into his own most sacred body and blood.

Ponder the om^ipotency ^ this our Lord: for in an iustant he ^^uerted the
bread into his sacred flesh in such a sort, that both God and man ent^erly and
wholly, is under that sm^ quantity of the host, and in every pa^ or parcel
thereof, without any diu^sion of the body, although the ho^ be broken and
divided.

Ponder secondly, that Chr^ our Lord said not, this is part of m^ body, or of
my flesh, but this is m^ body wholly and perfectly: for albei^ every least
particle of his Blessed (...) would have sufficed to sanctify va,^ would
nevertheless be there wholly every part of him, that is, his hea^ eyes, ears,
breast and heart, to gi^^ thee to understand, by the parti^^pation of his most
holy members, ^ would sanctify all those that wo^ duly receive him, and
per^^ctly (...) and heal them.

Gather hence a desire to gi^^ thy self v^holy unto our Lord, ^ ploying all
thy members and sen^^ in his (...) that tho^ ma^^ wholly be a perfect
representation of him.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider, how Christ Jesus our Lord communicated all his Apostles, and
Judas amongst the rest (albeit he knew what an one he was) because as yet his
sin was not no^torious; wherefore to him, as to all ^he rest, he gave in this
divine Sacra^ment, all he had, to wit, his most ^oly body and blood, his soul,
diui^ity and humanity, that they might ever have in mind his great love to^ards
them, and what he had suffered for their sake.

Ponder the reverence and de^otion wherewith those B. Apostles ^ Judas only
excep^ed, who was in mortal sin ^ did take and receive unto their breasts
that most Blessed ^read. There S. Peter did stir up his ^avth, and turning his
speech to him that he believed to be contained and to ^ye hidden in that sacred
bread, said: ^hou art Christ the Son of the li^ing God; To whom we may
ima^ine that our Lord would ans^ere: Blessed art thou Simeon Bariona, be^cause
flesh and blood h^th not revealed it to thee, but my Father which is in heaven
S. John like wise would enkindle in himself affections of love: seeing his
^oueraigne Master not only to unite himself so unto him, as to permit him to
lean on his breast, bu^ also to do him so great a favor (...) to enter into
his soul and body, for more perfect conjunction.

Learn when thou come t^ receane our Lord, to bring with the^ these
virtues, to wit, faith, purity and love, as these holy Apostles did that thou
may reap such profit ^ they did, and follow our Lord as they did follow him.

^ It is to be noted, that in the en^ of the ^^ird book, a (...) meditation
are added, for prepatation before (...) thanksgiving after we have r^cea^ued
this most ^ Sacrameat; vvher^ he that is (...) to know how (...) prepare
himself, and to give (...) thanks after unto our Lord for (...) benefit
received, may find them.

THE XXXIII. MEDITATION.
Of our Blessed Saviors prayer in the Garden, and agony there.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider the great desire that Christ had to suffer for our sake, and
because the time seemed ^ong till he should be delivered into ^he tormet^ors
hands, that they might ^ee, that he did nor shrink, nor yet ^^y, supper being
ended, he went into ^he garden to pray, that being a place well known to the
traitor Judas, to show that of his own free will he offer^ed himself to
prison, and to death it self.

Ponder how our Lord for no ^anner of afflictions or perils would ^^aue his
good and laudable exercise of praye^ and meditation: for sup^er being ended, he
betook (...) ^orth with to a solitary place to pray, before he was to enter
upon his pas^ion.

Be confounded, because through thy tepidity and negligence for every light
occasion thou leauest thy prayer and forgettest thy laudable customs, whereas
thou should do quite contrary, because in time of greater perils,
afflictions and temptations we ought to have more particular recourse unto
Almighty God, prayer being the only means to strengthen our selves in them.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider, how our Redeemer being come to the garden, wen^ aside from his
disciples, and began (...) wax sorrow full, and to be sad.

Ponder what is that which ma^keth our Lord to grieve and to be sad and
afflicted, he (...) the joy of An^gells, whom when they behold, they are
exceedingly rejoiced: thou shall find that the cause of this affl^ctio^ was the
fear of the (...) and (...) the death which he (...) to ^o stayn^^ the
remembranc^ and lively app^^ hension of the sins of all men, pre^sent* pasts
and future, the multitud^ and grieuousnes of them both, wa^s the cause of this
his trouble and grief^ ^ also the unspeakable damage which (...) sin comes
to men, in that (...) it they deserve to be condemned (...) the everlasting
torments of hell: ^^at of all this arose his so incre^^ble ^^rrow.

Gather hense affections of gri^fe ^^d sorrovv for the torments and death
^^hich is even now to come upon thv lord: for thou have been the cause ^his
pavnes and affl^ctions. Endea^our from this day forvvard to ab^orre and detest,
and fly from sin, ^^h thou see in what case thy Lord (...), to deliver thee
from it, and from ^^e eternal damnation which for thy (...) thou d^seruest.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider the (...) of our Sa^uiou^ in his prayer, many ^^mes craving of his
Eternal Father (...) and the self same thing, to wit, ^^at the bitter chalice
of his pa^^ion ^ight pass.

Ponder the devotion and ^wrod^ ^eling, the tears and sorrovv of thy lord, how
solitary, destitute and com^rtles he is in this his so great affliction: his
disciples were aloof of fast a sleep, his Eternal Father gave him no answer,
neither granted him his petition: his most holy Mother was also absent, his
enemies now ready to come upon him, and notwithstanding all these afflictions
and disco^forts he remained constant and perseuered in his prayer.

Gather hence the great esteem shou oughtst to have of prayer, seeing Christ
teaches thee that the only remedy of thy afflictions and sorrows, it not
talk, or converse with men, but to treat with God and continue in prayer:
confiding that though in the beginning he de^y that which thou ask, yet at
last he will grant it, if it be a thing convenient for thee.

THE 4. POINT
TO consider how the Son of God seeing his Eternal Father gave him no answer
the first nor second time, had recourse unto him the third time, and repeating
the same prayer with great love and confidence, said: Father if thou will,
transfer this Chalice from me: But yet not my will, but thine be done.

Ponder that the cause why the Eter^all Father did def^r so long to make
answer unto the prayer of his most holy Son, was to let thee know the great
necessity thou and all have of the passion and death of our Savior.

Learn, not to complain, not to be weary when thou pray^st, if God do not
hear thee: for certainly he hears thee. But if unto Christ our Lord (who
deserved to be heard at the first opening of his mouth) an^swere was not made
till he had prayed the third time, what vvonder is it if thy petitions be
deferred, who in regard of thy sins, deseruest not to be heard at all.

Ponder secondly how Christ many times will not comfort nor remedy thy
necessity in prayer, that thou may perceive and know the need thou have to
have recourse unto him with pati^nce and perseverance.

THE XXXIV. MEDITATION.
Of the apparition of the Angel, and the sweating of blood.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how the Eternal Father seeing his most Blessed Son in so great
affliction and anguish of mind, and that, according to the inferior part, he
feared to suffer and dye, he sent him an Angel from heaven to comfort and
strengthen him, and to propose unto him the glory of God which thence would
arise, and the benefit which would follow to all mankind by means of his
passion, and that for humiliation and ignominy of the Cross^, his Name should
be exalted, and adored of all creatures.

Ponder how the Lord of Angels (as if he had forgotten his own soue^aigne
Majesty) vouchsafe^ to receive comfort by one of his creatures, and being the
Fortitude of the Father, and he who with power and might governs and
su^taineth the world, receaueth comfort and relief from an Angel, having made
himself by reason of humane nature which he assumpted, inferior to the Angels.

Gather hence that the office of the Angels is to assist us in our prayers, to
comfort and animate us, and to present our prayers in the sight of God, which
if they be performed as they ought, they have their eff^^t: for God does either
deliver us out of tribulation, or gives us force to endure it with patience
and joy. Tr^st in God that thou shall reap the like comfort and benefi^ by thy
pains and affl^ctions, if in them thou have recourse to prayer, as our B.
Savior had in his.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how the Son of God praying with more force and earnestness, the
anguish, sorrow, and fear of death, and the manifold torments which he was to
suffer, did so wonderfully increase, that his sweat became as drops of blood
^tickling down upon the earth.

Ponder first the greatness of the torments which our Savior suffered: for if
the only representation of them wrought so strange an effect in him who is the
virtue and fortit^de of God, what may we think it was to endure them.

Ponder secondly, the example which our Lord gives thee to strive strongly
with thy passions and bad inclinations, withstanding them all valiantly even to
the shedding of thy blood, if it be needful, for the ouercomming of them.

Gather hence desires to fight against them, prop^sing to thy self all those
things which may terrify thee or cause thee any way to shrink in the way of
virtue, or in the accomplishment of the divine will, whether ^t be fear of
poverty, dishonor, sickness, grief, torment or whatsoever other difficulty,
that thus preparing thy self, thou may prevail and get victory over them.

THE 3. POINT.
To consider the immensity of the love of Christ our Lord, and the great
liberality which he shows thee in shedding voluntarily his precious blood
for thy sake, not staying till the tormentors should do it with their
stripes, thorns and nails.

Ponder how great the agony and sorrovv of our Lord was though the
apprehension of all the torments which he was to suffer in every part of his
body, since it was of force to make a bloody sweat to fall down from his
face, neck, breast, and shoulders, leaving him wholy bathed and embrued in
his own blood.

Gather from hence desires that all the parts of thy body might become as so
many tongues to praise and magnify the love and mercies of thy Lord, or so many
eyes to weep tears of blood for thy sins, or so many hands to chastise and
revenge thee on thy flesh by rigourous and sharp penance, it having been the
cause why thy Savior suffered so much, especially at that time, all at once,
and upon a heap all that he was to sustain after at several times.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider the vigor and force which the most holy flesh of Christ received
by praver to encounter with the many griefs and torments of his passion, it
being strengthened to undergo that which before it did naturally fly from, and
abhor.

Ponder that the causes of courage and strength of mind and body which our Lord
showed h^^re, were two. First, because he saw that by his death and passion he
was to heal all the mortal soars and wounds of the mystical body of the
Church, which are the faithful. Secondly, to give vigor, force and courage to
his elect, to vanquish and subdue their spiritual and corporal enemies,
v^dergoing for him and for his honor and glory, affl^ctions, persecu^ions,
reproaches, torments, Crosses and death, as Saint Peter, and S Paul, S. Andrew,
S. Steven, S. Laurence and many others did, imitating like faithful soldiers
their valiant Captain, who went before, and gave them a lively* example of
suffering patiently and constantly.

Gather hence a desire to arm thy self like a true soldier of Christ with
the armor of prayer, which is the a^mour of light, that in all thy labors and
affl^ctions, thou may fight, and get the victory over thine enimes, the
world, the flesh, and the ^iuell.

THE XXXV. MEDITATION.
Of the coming of Judas, and of the inturies done unto our Savior.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider, how that our Saulour having ended his prayer, that salfe traitor
and ^ained friend Judas, approached with a great multitude of armed men, making
himself the leader and Captain of them to apprehend Christ our Lord.

Ponder the extremity of evils wherinto this wretch is fallen, because he did
not resist his covetousness at the beginning: and what may be expected from
thee, if thou resist not that which thou feel in thy self, especially
having got so good means of virtue as he had: for thou do not learn in such
a school, thou see not such miracles, neither conuersest with such a
Master, nor with such school-fellowes. Yet all this was not though to
restrain this accursed conp^nion, and keep him from falling, like another
Lucifer from the highest degree in the Church, to the deepest bottom of all
wickedness, to wit, to become the head conspirer of the death of Christ.

Gather out of all this a great fear of the judgments of God, beseeching him,
not to leave thee, least thy impiety proceed so far as to work thine own
ruin, by the benefits which he bestows upon thee.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider that the sign which this traitor had given to the Ministers of
Satan, to betray his Master was this: Whomesoeuer I shall kiss, that is he,
hold him fast.

Ponder that the enemies of the author of life, could entrap him by no other
wile then by show of love. And ^e accepted this cruel kiss, that with the
swet^es thereof, and of his meeknes he might soften the rebellious and
obstinate heart of Judas.

From thence thou may gather a great confidence in the mercy of this our
Lord, that he will not refuse nor disdai^e thy kiss, nor of those sinners
which desire to reconcile th^selues to him, and renew their friendship with him
which they have lost, seeing he did not reject the ki^^e of him who so cruelly
betrayed him, and sold him, as Judas did.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider, how Christ our Lord encountered those impiou^ officers of
injustice, and demanding of them, Whom seek ye? they answered him, Jesus of
(...), and ^ur Lord said unto them? I am (...).

Ponder first that word of Christ, whom seek ye, as if he should say: ^ake
heed, you seek a just and innoc^et^ ^an, who does good to al, and (...) no man.
You seek him who descended from heaven to earth for your eternal weal and
salvation, and you seek him to deprive him of his life.

Gather from hence desires to seek this thy Lord, but after a far different
manner, to wit, for thy salvation and remedy, and for his honor and glory, and
thou may be assured, that seeking him after this manner, tho^ shall find him.

Ponder secondly, that word, I am he. A word which unto his good Disciples
was alvvayes a great comfort in their travails and afflictions, but unto the
bad, it is of so great fervor, and dread, that it alone did fell them flat to
the ground, neither could they have risen again if the same our Lord, who
overthrew them with one only word, had not given them leave to rise.

Gather hence desires to seek God: and note by the way, that unto the good who
seek him in prayer, he is a Father and protector, he is their repose and joy:
But unto the evil who seek him to offend him, and kill him, he is judge that
shall judge and condemn them. Finally he is he, which is to their loss and
eternal grief.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider how Christ our Lord the most innocent Lamb (himself giving place
to the fury of his enemies) was delivered up to the ravenous wolves and prinoes
of darkness (which are the infernal spirits) by means of his servants and
ministers, to be put to all manner of torments and cruelties, his life not
e^cepted (as in holy Job it was, when he was delluered to the power of Satan)
but without any limitation at all, that they might wre^ke their fu^y upon his
most sacred hamanity.

Ponder the (...) and rudene^ of those sauadge suryes, ma^ing their sport and
pastime to iniure and torment the Son of God, of whom they had received so
great ^enefits, and whom a little before they had judged worthy of highest
honor: but forgetting all this they Stroke him on the face, they spurned and
buffeted him with their fists, they plucked him by the hair, and by the heard.

Hence thou may stir up in thy self shame and confusion, for that thou have
been so bold, as to handle thy Savior as ill as these traitors did laying thy
sacrilegious and violent hands upon him, if not in out^ard show, at least
through thy manifold sins and wicked deeds, persecuting him with them, as hit
enemies did, not once only, as they did, but many times.

THE XXXVI. MEDITATION.
How Christ our Lord was apprehended.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how our Lord being Inno^^ncy it self was reckoned and treated as a
These, and for such his enemies came to apprehend him with chains and cords,
with swords and clubb^: and our Sauiout gave them power over his body, to
spurn and torment it at their pleasure.

Ponder the surpassing great ^umility of our Lord, and how he is ^ast at the
feet of most vile sin^ers, whose s^at and throne is above the Seraphims: how
he is kicked at, and trodden under foot as a malefactor, who is the mirror of
innocen^y and the vnsported Lamb. Admire the rare submission and humiliation
of so great a God, who did not only prostrate himself at the feet of his
Apostles and of Judas, and washed them and kissed them, but also suffered this
traitor and his accursed company, to set their abominable fert upon him, to
tread upon him, and spurn him.

Gather hence an earnest desire to yield and humble thy self to thy
inferiors, be holding Christ thy Redeemer so humbl^ and meek, and considering
of whom, and for whom he rec^^ueth such injuries and r^proaches.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how that wicked band of soldiers, after they had stricken and
abused Christ our Lord, tying him by the wrests, with strong cords like a
Thief, they brought him bound unto Annas the High Priests house.

Ponder, how farour Lord was from being a Thief and robber of other men's
goods: for he gave all he had, and that which was particular to himself alone
for thy good, and took upon him the form of a servant, concealing the dignity
of a Lord and Master. But if to rescue and deliver souls out of the thraldom
of Satan, and to dravv our hearts to his love (which he has ever done) be to
be^ These, beseech him to take thy heart and all that which thou have besides.

And with earnest affection say unto him: Bind o Lord I beseech thee my hands
with the fetters of thy love that my works may be grateful unto thee. Bind my
memory, that it for get not so many favors and benefit which thou daily
bestowest upon me. Bind my eyes, that they may not behold unlawful things.
Bin^ my tongue, that it detract not, no^ murmr against my neigbour Bing my
feet, that they may only walk the paths of thy divine Commandments. Bind
finally, O Lord, this nature of mine, and all my se^es and powers from all that
which is sin and offense, and set me free to all that which is virtue.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider that the Apostls, seeing their Lord and Master apprehended by the
jews and ^ast bound, much affrighted, fled away and forsook him.

Ponder how thy Savior in this ^xigent is all alone and forsaken of his
friends, and environed with cruel and mercil^sse enemies: how he was well
accompayned at his supper and in time of prosperity, but now abandoned of all
in time of (...).

From hence thou may gather confusion and shame, for (...) often forsaken and
left thy Father, Lord and Master, and omitted to accomplish his holy will to
fulfill thine own. And our Savior here being forsaken of his heavenly
Father and of his disciples, giu^th thee a rate example of patience, that if
tho^ be destitute and left by thy friends and kinsfolks, thou e^dure it
patiently, for i^ is not much that the disciple suffe^ that which his Master
has suffered before him. Beseech him humbly that seeing he is a true and
faithful friend* he will never forsake thee, although all others should
forsake thee, but es^pecially that he will not leave thee i^ the hour of thy
death.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider who this Lord is vp^^ whom so many injuries are discharged, who
he is that sustaineth (...) many reproaches and indig^ities, and (...) whose
hands he takes them.

Ponder first that he is the Et^^nall Word of the Father of infinite virtue,
innumerable goodn^s, tru^^ glory, and the clear fountiane of a beauty: He it
is that is bound, mana^^ cled, buff^ted, haled, spurned, an tr^dden under foot:
He it is that handled in so v^humane and ru^^ manner.

Ponder secondly, the grie^ which our Savior self seeing himself ^ much abused
by so base a people, and so ungrateful, that for so many ^enefits, returned
him so many and so ^^ieuous injuries* And if God took so heavily to be so dealt
with all by ^ enemies, how heavily did he take suffering the like from his
friends, ^eing himself all alone and desolate, in so great a^fliction, having
been trayed and sold by one of them, ^nyed by another, and forsaken of (...)

Gather from hence a desire to come a true disciple of our Lord, devouring
never to leave him, but accompany him, and follow him ^en to the Cross, that
so thou may ^oy him in his glory.

^HE XXXVII. MEDITATION.
(...) Christ our Lord was presented before Annas the high Priest.

THE 1. POINT.
^O consider what thy God and Lord suffered in that long way between the
garden and Annas his house, unto whom his enemie^ carried him, buffeting him,
and spu^^ning him, and forcing him to go a^ pace, half running, and trayling
hi^ on the ground, as it is wont to happ^ to them that are led like thieves an^
male^actours, and are fettered and cha^^ned.

Ponder the meeknes and silen^^ wherewith our Lord suffered so m^^ny affronts,
not having deserved (...) of them, for he never had, (...) could have
co^^nitted any fault, thou^^ his adversaries pretended that he (...) guilty of
many.

Gather hence a great desire ^^^mitate the example of thy Lord in b^^ing
silent, and suffering patiently wh^^ occasion shall be offered thee, seei^^ thou
have so man^ imperfections (...) sins, as thou have. Is it much (...) thou
bear and be silent for the love (...) God, who being free from all fa^^ gave
thee so great an example of ^^^uincible patience and sufferance?

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider the shouts and outcryes of those wicked ministers, when they
entered the city with our Blessed Savior, proclayming and vanting themselves
of the prey they had gotten.

Ponder how different this entrance into Jerusalem was, from that which the
same our Lord made on Palm su^day, when many went with him with boughs of
palms in their hands, in token of the victory which ^he had achieved over his
enemies. But now they bring him in with swords and lances, as if they had
got the victory over him. In that entra^c^ all cried out in his praise: Blessed
is he that comes in the name of our Lord: in this, they cry out in derision
of him, making him their laughingstocke and calling him by a thousand unworthy
names. In that they spead their garments on the ground, that he might pass
upon them* In this they ^haled, rent, and tore his garments from him, ^ea and
pulled the hair from his ^^eard and sacred head.

From hence thou may gather a certain equality of mind, and conformity with
the divine will in all things, being mindful of adversity in time of
prosperity, of disgraces and reproaches in time of honor, and of a bad day in
the good: for it is clear that of little pleasure much sorrow follows.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider in what plight those sacred feet of thy Savior were, being
embrued with blood, the skin flayed of them with often stumbling and with being
trodden on and spurned at, by those hellish ministers.

Ponder first, how those divine feet begin to pay for the sin which thy feet
have committed in the rash and crooked ways by which they have walked, to
fulfill thy desirs and inordinate appetites.

Secondly, the spirit and affection wherewith our Lord goes a long that way
(and the virtues he exercises of humility and patience) offering those
painful steps unto his Eternall^ Father in satisfaction of those which thou
make to offend him.

And gathering hence desires of thankfulness unto so good a Lord. who has
walked such ways for thy salvation and remedy, beseech him to give thee grace
to ordain thine to his holy service, and to the performance of his holy Law,
and Commandments.

THE 4. POINT
TO consider in what manner thy Savior was received, when he arrived at Annas
his Palace, and was brought in before him, and before the Scribes or
Interpreters of the Law: with what arrogance they began to examine our Lord,
causing that divine Majesty to stand before the^ as one that was esteemed
guilty, and they in the mean time remay^ing sitting as Judges: they in state,
and in their Doctorall robes* and the Lord and Master of the Wisdom of
heaven, manacled and bound before them, as if he had been a thief and
malefactor.

Ponder how differently God our Lord is now among the doctors and Lawiers, from
that he was when being twelve years of age, he sat among them, hearing them
and asking the^: al being astonished upon his wisdom and answers. Then he was
seated in the midst of them, hearing and answering, to the esteem and
admiration of all; but now he stands, and if he make answer to the questions
they ask him, he is scorned and mocked, being the Doctor of all Nations.

Gather hence a desire to humble thy self, and to bear patiently (i^^^
imitation of our Lord) when thou shall be accounted by others as unwise, and
ignorant, and persuade thy self, that thou art so indeed, and be glad to
imitate in something, and to be like thy Savior.

THE XXXVIII. MEDITATION.
Of the blow given to our Savior upon the face: and how he was sent bound unto
Caiphas.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider, how that Lord (of whom it is said in Saint John's Never did
there man speak so as this man) giving now a mild and gentle answer to the
high Priest, is stricken and buffised by a base fellow.

Ponder how the face of our Savior remained sorely bruised and disfigured with
this cruel blow, and was exceeding red, partly with it and partly through his
natural bashfulnes and modesty having received so great an affront. And albeit
the buffets* blows, and spurns which were heaped upon thy Lord by his
enemies, when he was apprehended, were many, yet of none but only of this
mention is made in particular in holy Scripture, because it was more
reproachful and injurious then the rest, and because it was given in presence
of the high Priest, and of many nobles, and of the chief of the people.

Gather from hence compassion and sorrow, beholding that sovereign countenance
of thy Redeemer so buffered and wounded: On whom the Angels desire to look.
And be ashamed to grieve and complain, not for that thou art buffeted (for
thou art not arrived so high as to endure so much) but because others donot
honor and countenance thee, when thou art in presence with them desiring
heerin to be better then thy Lord God who was so much reviled, scoffed at, and
despised for thy sake.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider the great patience, meeknes, cheerfulnes, and ^erenity of mind
which our Lord kept in his most holy soul, receauiug ^uch a wrong and never
reue^ging it, either by word or deed.

Ponder, that whereas Christ our Lord could have caused fire to come from
heaven, or the earth to have opened, and to swallow and consume that wicked
fellow, he did it not, but in all patience showed that he was ready to turn
the other cheek, if he would have stricken it.

Gather and take example heerby, not to be angry or offended for any thing
whatsoever may befall thee, be it never so weighty, nor to render evil for
evil. Beseeching him in this misery to give thee in all occasions which
shall be offered thee that constancy of mind and meeknes which he had and showed
here, that thou may be meek and humble of heart, as he was.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider the mild answer which Christ Jesus our Lord gave unto him, who
had thus abused and wronged him, to wit: If I have spoken evil, give testimony
of evil, but if well, why strikest thou me? and accusest me of
undutifulness, seeing thou art no Judge, but only a witness?

Ponder, that albeit this reason was good and conuincing, yet it was not
admitted, neither did it avail him, nor any reckoning was made of it, but
rather all that were present were glad and rejoiced that, that blow on the
cheek was given him: and none was found that would take his part, and
reprehend the audacity of that bold and barbarous companion.

From hence thou may gather conformity with the divine Will, when thy
answers and reasons shall not be heard, nor admitted, nor account made of them,
seeing no account was made of the answer which the Son of God gave, whose
nature it is ever to speak that which is reason: and therefore he is now
stricken and abused, to satisfy for thy faults, which thou have done and do
daily commit in evil speaking. Beseech our good Lord that he will give thee
grace always to speak well of him, and to do honor unto all.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider that the hatred and rancour of Annas, and of all the rest of that
wicked counsel against our Redeemer, was so great, that blinded with the
splendour of such patience and meeknes, they determined to send the most meek
lamb fast bound unto Caiphas the high Priest, that beholding him brought in
that manner he might understand that they thought him guilty and worthy of
death.

Ponder, how different these bands and fetters were, wherewith the cruel
tormentors bound the Lord of Angels, from those with which he bound them, to
wit, the bands of charity: but his charity is so great, that he delighted to be
tied with new fetters and cords, to loose thee and them from the grievous
sins which thou have committed against his divine Majesty.

From whence thou may gather desires to suffer and to bear the like Crosses
if in publik or in private thou be held guilty or faulty (for in truth thou art
no less) seeing thy Lord though he be so much worthy to be glorified, is
notwithstanding so des^ised and scoffed at.

THE XXXIX. MEDITATION.
Of the denial of S. Peter.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how Peter having fled the night of the Passion of our Savior with
the rest of the Disciples, entering into himself again, and desiring to know
the event of the business, and the success of the imprisonment of his
Master, he followed him. And by Saint John Evangelist his means (who was
known in the house of the high Priest) he entered in, and being known by those
which were there, to be our Saviors Disciple, he denied him thrice, swearing
and forswearing that he knew him not.

Ponder, how deeply this sin and grievous offense of his Disciple did pierce
the very soul of our Lord, that his dear and tenderly beloved Apostle, and so
much honored above the rest with the primacy of the Church, should be ashamed
to be accounted his Disciple.

Gather hence, confusion and shame for that thou have oftentimes denied thy
Savior, if not in words at least in deeds, being ashamed to keep his holy
Commandments, or to perform some actions of virtue, as to confess and
communicate, or to suffer some injury. All which what else is it then to be
ashamed to seem the Disciple of Christ, and to deny him: wherefore thou may
justly fear* least that sentence of our Savior, and punishment fall upon
thee, where he says: He that denies me before men, the Son of man shall
deny him before the Angels of God: or he that shall be ashamed to seem my
disciple before men, the Son of the Virgin will be ashamed to acknowledge him
for his, before the holy Angels.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how dangerous a thing it is to continue in the occasion of sin,
and not to learn to beware by the first fall: for the present occasion, and
the presuming too much of himself and his own virtue, and also evil company
were the cause of his fall: Almighty God permitting that a silly woman,
Portesse in Pilates house, should prevail against him who had the keys of the
house of God: so does he chastise pride and presumption.

Ponder, that he who was the fundame^tall stone of the Church, and so much
favored by our Lord, he that confessed Jesus Christ for the Son of the
living God, he that offered himself to dye for him, rather then to be
scandalized and to fly, now finds himself so weak and fearful, that
being demanded by a poor girl, whether he be the disciple of Christ, is
ashamed to confess it, seareth and trembles, and at last flatly denies it,
not once, or twice, but three times.

Gather out of this weakness and frailty of Peter ^ow near he is to a fall who
confideth much and presumes of himself. And seeing thou art not a Rock, but
dust and ashes, and all the gould and silver of thy vveake virtue is founded
upon feet of ^^ay, and the least stone of contradiction is sufficient to
overthrow it, and bring the whole tower to ground: therefore boa^t nor brag of
any thing, for thou have not any stronger hold, nor greater strength then with
humble acknowledgment of thine own nothing and weakness wholly to rely on the
goodness and mercy of our Lord. Wherefore not to fall, it behooves thee to fly
bad company, and all occasions of danger, arrogance, pride and presumption.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider that as soon as Saint Peter had denied his Master, Christ our
Lord moved with compassion, and grieuing to see the Pastor of his flock, and
that sheep which was head of all the rest, now fallen into so great calamity
and mysery, looking on him, reclaymed and converted him.

Ponder, the infinite mercy and charity of Christ our Lord, who albeit he be
environed with his enemies, and laden with afflictions, is mindful of his
Disciple, and instead of chastising him, has pity on him, and turning his
eyes of mercy toward him, illuminateth his blindness with heavenly light, that
he may know and see his errors. for the eyes of God have this property, that
they open, and awake the drovvsy, and revive the dead.

Gather hence affections of love toward this our Lord, because when thou
go about to offend him, he inuenteth means and finds out ways to pardon
thee, he has compassion on thee, he beholds thee with the eyes of his
mercy, he touches thy heart, and all to the end that thou might know, feel
and lament thy sins and offenses.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider, how our Lord enlightening and penetrating the wounded soul of
Peter with that his silent and loving look, that remembering himself and being
sorry for his sin, he might bitterly bewail the same, he presently returned
to himself and wept bitterly: and for more effectual redress of his
offense, he departed the house and Palace of the high Priest, where he had
found so bad intertainement, and shut himself up into one of those caves,
which were toward the fountain of Siloe, and lamented his sin with deep
sorrow, and said: O treacherous old age, o years ill spent, o life naughtily
employed, o blasphemous tongue, o wretched sinner, coward, liar, what have thou
done? Oughtst thou so to have denied thy Master, having received so many
favors and benefits of him?

Ponder how Peter because he had denied his Master thrice in one night, wept
and repented himself of his sin all his life time, and did very sharp and
rigorous penance, albeit he knew that God had already pardoned him.

From hence thou may gather desires to do the like for thy sins, seeing
that not one night alone, but all thy life time, and not thrice, but
innumerable times, thou have denied and abandoned thy God. Wherefore (...)
behooves thee, if thou desire to have pardon, very seriou^ly ^o bewail and
heartily to repent for thy sins, and do penance for them.

THE XL. MEDITATION.
What happened unto our Savior in Caiphas his house, and of the things he
suffered that night.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider the answer which our Lord gave unto the demand of Caiphas the
high Priest: I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us, if thou be
Christ the Son of God. And our Lord although he knew right well the great
injuries, reproaches, and torments, which his confession would cost him, yea
death it self, he plainly ansvvered and told the truth, and savd what was be
fitting his person. The high Priest blinded with splendor of so great light,
and being in passion, judged that he had blasphemed, and so he and all the rest
of his Counsel condemned our Lord to death And having no respect to the
innocence of his life, nor to their own state and quality, treated him most
vilely.

Ponder the me^knes wherewith our Lord suffered these affronts and injuries: and
heard that unjust sentence: He is guilty of death. O how that immaculate lamb,
hearing this sentence would offer himself willingly to death, to give life unto
them, who gave sentence against him, and condemned him to death.

Gather hence desires always to say of our Savior the contrary to that which
these his enemies pronounced of him, to wit, such innocence, such a Lord, such
a benefactor^ such a Savior and Master deserves life: Such a God and
Redeemer is most worthy to live: and all those which condemn him, or offend
him, or accu^fe him, are worthy of everlasting death.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider that it being now late and time for the high Priest and his
fellowers to rest, they delivered up our Lord to the soldiers to watch him,
and they to keep themselves from sleeping did deride, scoff, and mock at our
Lord, and covering his eyes with a shameful ragge, smote his divine face,
saying voto him: Prophesy unto us, O Christ, who is he that struck thee?

Here thou may ponder Christ our Lord full of pain and affliction,
rejected, despised and contemned of all, great and little: neither was it the
least cause of grief to have his divine eyes covered, that his enemies might
the more freely strike him on the face, persuading themselves that so he could
not see them: for it is the property of great sinners to desire not to be
seen, that they may sin more freely, and without restraint, But he savv them
notvvithstanding with the eyes of his soul, and of his Godhead, because he
was God: whose eyes, says the Wiseman, behold in every place, the good and
the evil, which every one continually does.

Hence thou may gather, that when thou sinnest, forgetting that God does see
thee, thou art as it were hood-winked and deceauest thy self, covering thine
own eyes with this false and black veil: for Gods eyes are most clear and
open upon thee, beholding thy thoughts, words, and deeds. Wherefore from this
day forword be affrayd to offend our Lord, carrying ever in thy memory this
admirable saying: Behold, God beholds thee.

THE 3. POINT
TO consider now that after this in^ury, those cruel fellows deuoid of all
humanity, did unto our Savior another no less affront, spitting in his face,
and covering it with their ^oathsome and stinking spittle: for all of them (and
they were many) striving who should do worst, did cast their spittle upon him,
wonderfully defiling and obscuring that beauty, which rejoices the heavenly
court and company.

Ponder whose face it is that is ^hus defiled and spit upon, as if it were he
most vile and contemptible corner of the world; and thou shall find that it is
the face of the God of Majesty, of whom the Prophet said: Show thy face and we
shall be saved. It is the face before whom the Seraphims out of due respect and
reverence do cover theirs. It is his face vvherevvith his divine spittle gave
sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, and speech to the dumb. It is his
face, whom the Angels of heaven continually beholding and adoring, are never
satiated.

From hence thou may gather abundant motives and affections of compassion and
sorrow, grieuing to behold the face of such a Lord, defaced and spit upon by
such and so base miscreants, to see the Creator so abused by so vile creatures,
his divine majesty permitting himself to be obscured and defiled, that thou
might become pure and clean.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider, the injurious and disgraceful words, that even the very Kichen
scullians of that pallac^ gave unto Christ our Lord, and also how they laid
load upon him with blows, buffets, and spurns, and asked him: Gh^sse who
stroke thee? seeing thou say that thou art Christ and a Prophet, who gave
thee this blow on thy care? who this spurn with his foot? who this kick, and
who this cuffe in the neck? And laughing aloud, (...) jesting at him they
manifestly declared that they held him for a feigned Christ, and a false
Prophet.

Ponder the invincible patience, the inestimable meeknes, and the most loving
heart, wherewith God our Lord suffered all this, as also that patience with which
he supporteth thee, seeing that as much as ly eth in thee thou have far oftener
scoffed at thy Redeemer, ^ffending him with thy manifold sins, and yet his
mercy is so great, that he grieueth more at thy offenses, and at the harm
which comes to them that torment him, then at the pains which he himself
sustayneth.

Gather hence affections and desires to suffer something for this thy Lord,
who endures so much for thee, loving him with all thy heart, who gave thee
such and to many signs of love, joining with continual thanksgiving,
continual service for them.

THE XLI. MEDITATION.
Of the presentation of our Lord before Pilate, and what questions he asked him.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how much Christ Jesus our Lord, and also his enemies desired the
co^mming of the morning, but for very different ends: Our Lord to suffer and
dye, and they to put in execution their damnable intent, which was to murder
him: and forthwith in the morning the high Priest Caiphas and the whole
Counsel ass^mbled together, and calling our Lord Jesus the second time, he
asked him: Art thou Christ the Son of the Blessed God? but our Lord answered
him not to his demand.

Ponder how much it imports thee, to ask our Lord this question* but with a
different meaning, and desire from that which his enemies had, ^aying: O my
Lord, if thou art Christ, (...) thou art the promised Messiah, if (...) art the
Son of the living God, and the splendor of the glory of (...) Eternal
Father, as it is most true (...) thou art, how comes it to ^asse that thy
divine face is so disfi^ured? how is it defiled with spittle? (...) is it
bruised with buffets? And ^aming hence affections of tender ^ue and compassion,
acknowledge at thy sins have been the cause, ^hy thy Savior Christ and Lord
is that plight, in which thou see ^m, and his unspeakable charity gi^th
testimony of him, that he is the ^nne of the living God: For no o^^r then he
could have undergone so any torments for the sins which never committed. And
adoring (...) with all thy heart, thou shall say: ^ou o Lord, art my Christ, and
my ^^d, my Savior and my Redeemer, he, who thirty and three years ^st so
great and earnest desire and ^ging to see this day of pain and ^ction once
come, to deliver me from the eternal affliction, and pain.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how the high Priest hearing the answer which our Lord gave
afterward to his demand he and all the rest that were present being unworthy
to hear that which they deserved not to understand they treated him as a
slave. And thinking any punishment that they could inflict upon him by their
law, to little, they yielded him up to the se^cular power of the president
Pilate that he might sentence and torment hi^ more cruelly.

Ponder the providence a^ wisdom of our Lord God, vv^^ would that the Jews,
and Genti^ should concur to the death of hi^ who dyed for the salvation of
all: (...) his death is our life, and his condem^tion our salvation.

Gather hence compassion grief to behold thy Lord, and (...) God hated of all,
as well of these his own nation as of strangers. (...) lament, for that many
Christians the like through their sins: and if those who have obligation to
serve and honor him do this, what wonder is it i^ the Turks and Gentills, who
know him not, do offend him.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider, the presentation and accusation of Christ before Pilate, as if he
had been a malefactor and a seditious person, being accused as one who
prohibited Tribute to be given to Caesar, making himself the Messiah promised
of God.

Ponder how Christ our Lord in all these accusations and calumniations
ansvvered not a word in his ^vvne defense, shevving heerin his great meeknes
and patience, and declaring in fact how earnest a desire he had to die for our
salvation, seeing he would not by speaking for himself, cause his death to be
one jot de^ayed.

From hence thou may gather that the strongest armor to resist ^y enemies,
in the midst of the tem^ests of adversity and persecution, (...) confidence in
God, such as our Lord had, whose name is Admirable: for he is not only
admirable in perfections and miracles, but also in humiliations and
afflictions. Admirable in meeknes, admirable in patience, and in suffering,
admirable in silence, giving thee example how thou oughtst to keep silence, and
not excuse thy self when thou art reprehended for thy misdeeds and sins,
albeit thou find not thy self in conscience guilty of any thing.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider how Pilate having heard all these accusations, entered with
Christ our Lord into the Palace to examine and inquire of him concerning all
that which was laid to his charge, and having heard all his divine answers
from the mouth of God, in whom never was found deceit, perceiving his
vprightnes and integrity, judged him to be an innocent man.

Ponder the desire our Lord had, that, that miserable judge would open the eyes
of his soul, to receau^ the beam of his divine light. But the un happy
wretch, although he began to have a desire to know the truth, yet he did not
expect answer, because he deserved not to hear it from the mouth of the true
God.

Gather from hence desires to know the truth, and that God, as the Father and
author thereof, will reach it thee, believing that his life is truth, his
miracls truth, his Sacraments truth, truth all that he taught and preached.
Wherefore seeing this is the most certain truth, although the defense thereof
cost thee thy life, as it cost thy God his life, be glad to loose it for him:
neither loosing it, shall thou loose it, but gain it everlastingly.

THE XLII. MEDITATION.
Of the presentation of Christ our Lord, before Herod.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how Pilate understanding that our Savior was borne in Galilee,
and under He^rods jurisdiction (who was come to Jerusalem in those days to
celebrate the feast of the Paschall Lamb) sent him unto him, that he might
judge and discuss the process of that prisoner, whom he held as his subject

Ponder the pains and ignominy our God endured between Pilats house and King
Herod's palace, those his cruel enemies carrying him with great violence,
tumult and noise, through the midst of the market place and streets of
Jerusalem, that he might be seen and noted of all, and esteemed guilty.

Have compassion to see the Son of God haled to so many Tribunalls and Judges,
every one worse then the other, his divine majesty ordayning it so, that he
might have abundant matter wherein to show his invincible patience, humility
and longanimity, giving thee an example, that thou may know wherein to
imitate him, and follovv his virtues.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how glad King Herod was when he saw our Savior, because he had
heard many things of him, the wonders he wrought, and the miracles he did: and
so desired that he would do some before him.

Ponder how Christ our Lord to eschew death or any other torment, would not do
any miracle before Herod, and also because he knew that he was moved to desire
it through pride and vain curiosity, and not of a desire of his own spiritual
benefit, neither would our Lord speak one word in defense of himself, or to
that he asked him: all which redounded to hi^ greater reproach.

Gather from hence a desire that God would vouchsafe to grant thee the virtue
of silence, and make answer for thee in all thy doubts and difficulties, for
the benefit of thy soul, thou being full of darkness and ignorance, and of thy
self art not able to give any answer to the purpose, nor to rid thy self of
the questions and impugnations of others.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider how that Herod, seeing our Lord not to yield to his desire, nor to
satisfy his curious leuity, did contemn him, and with all those of his court
held him for a simple and foolish fellow, and therefore not so much worthy of
death as to be mocked and scorned at, and so in derision and mockage put on him
a white and homely garment.

Ponder how Christ our Lord (...) here mocked and disgraced by the King and
all his Courtiers, who made a fool of him, and stood plucking him and pinching
him, and jesting at him in most rude and uncivil manner. And when they had
done, the King sent him back to the President Pilate, as if he should have
said unto him: Lo I send you back this fool, and idiot.

From whence thou may gather desirs to accompany in spirit thy true King and
Lord, who suffered all these opprobrious things with admirable patience,
teaching thee to make small reckoning of the judgments and opinions of this
world which are mere folly, and what people say or do: desire to suffer for
justice and piety, that thou may be assured of the Kingdom of heaven: for
there is no greater wisdom then to rejoice in contempt for the love of God,
nor greater folly, then to seek to be honored without him.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider how that amongst so many garments which our Lord changed that
night of his Passion, his Eternal Father never permitted his enemies to inuest
him with a black one (it being the use and custom among the Jews, that he
who went to the tribunal to be arraygned, should be clad in black, which was a
sign of a condemned person) but would that it should be white in token of
^nnocency, or ruddy in token of ^oue.

Ponder how that garment which was given unto Christ our Lord in ^erision, was
a figure of the witness and purity of his most blessed soul, and of the
innocence of his life, as his enemies themselves were feign to confess,
saying: I have found no cause in this man of those things, wherein you accuse
him.

Gather hence desires, that our Lord would inuest and adorn thy soul with the
white garment of innocence and thy body with his reproaches, that in all thou
may imitate him, and so thou shall become more white and purer then snow.

THE XLIII. MEDITATION.
How Barabbas was compared, and preferred before Christ

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider that Pilate defirous to deliver Christ from death and being to
release some one condemned person in honor of the Pasch, said unto the Jews:
Whom will you that I release, Barabbas, (...) Jesus that is called Christ? for
(Barabbas being so seditious and wicked a fellow) he made no doubt, but th^^
rather then he should go unpunished, they would release our Savior Jesus
Christ.

Ponder the vvonderfull humiliation of Christ our Lord, who being so great, so
wise, so holy, and so great a benefactour of all, is now balanced and
compared with Barabbas an infamous companion, a thief, a murderer, a seditious
and publik malefactor.

Gather hence desires not to disdain, grudge, or repine when an inferior and
worse then thy self, is preferred before thee, and more honored and
respected, if account be made of him, and not of thee, if another be employed
in offices and business, and of thee no mention be made. nor thou regarded,
seeing thy Lord and thy God endured all this, and much more.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider, how the ungrateful people and those blind and passionate Scribes
and Pharisees, out of malice brake into open injustice, and how in their sight,
Barabbas his life, notwithstanding all his murders, robberies, and
abominations weighed more and was thought more profitable, then the innocence
of Christ our Redeemer for all his virtues and miracles, Wherefore they
besought the judge to release the man-killer, and wicked villain, and to
murder and crucify the author of life.

Ponder how mutable men are, and easy to be deceived: for they who a few days
before with common consent and festival acclamations, called Christ their
King, now with a different note and tumultuous clamor, say: Make Jesus away,
and release us Barabbas.

Gather hence confusion for thy pride, and endeavor from this day forward to
humble and submit thy self, seeing that our Lord is held for less then the
lewdest fellow in the world. And here thou may see literally fullfilled
that which our Lord said by his Prophet: I am a worm and no man, ^ reproach
of men, and outcast of the people. And for such he is now reputed of those
who ought to honor and respect him above all men and Angels.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider that the more the President Pilate desired to deliver Christ our
Lord, the more the Jews were earnest to have Barabbas released.

Ponder how often the like judgment, strife and controversy passes between
thy flesh and thy spirit, the one making choice of Christ, and the other of
^arabbas; the one of God the other of a creature; the one seeks after the
vain perishing glory of men, the other seeks the glory of God, which is
perpetual and everlasting. Finally the one enquireth after corruptible and
transitory things, the other after things permane^t and which endure for ever.

Whence thou may gather great sorrow for having left Christ thy only and
chiefest good, for so vile and contemptible a thing as Barrabbas: I mean, for
having so often c^osen and regarded more a creature, ^ little sensible delight
and vain honor, then Christ Jesus our Lord: In whom be all the goods and
treasures of the wisdom and infinite knowledge of God hidden. Be confounded
in consideration of this, thou miserable wreth, as thou art.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider how Pila^e did testify unto the people the innocence of Christ,
saying: I find no cause in him, why he should deserve death: but the outrageous
people raising their voices cried aloud, saying: Crucify him, crucify him.

Ponder how much those redoubled and often repeated clamours grieved our Lord,
seeing that they did not only seek his death, but that he should dye so cruel
a death, as the death of the Cross.

Gather hence sorrow for that thy sins have put our Lord to so great
straites: for they alone were those that importuned and cried out that he
should be crucified. Wherefore it behooves thee to abhor them, and detest so
cruel and bloody beasts, which with so great cruelty murdered our Savior.

THE XLIIII. MEDITATION.
Of the stripes which our Lord received at the pillar.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider, how the Present Pilate, seeing that his former project and devise
did not succeed, and that all the people began to be in an vproare, he took
another means and counsel to appease the fury of those cruel enemies, which
was to give sentence against the Lord of Angels, that he should be whipped.

Ponder how unjust, cruel, and reproachful this sentence was which the
President gave against our Lord, notwithstanding he knew very well and was sure
of his innocence. But our Lord Jesus lifting his eyes to his Eternal Father,
said these words of the prophet: I am ready O my Lord for scourges, and
desirous to pay the things that I took not. And without appellation or making
any other means to quit himself, he accepted that bloody sentence, offering
most willingly his sacred body to be scourged in satisfaction of our sins.

Gather hence desires not to complain when by thy Superiors, equals, or
inferiors thou shall be reprehended and chastized, although thou be without
fault, seeing God most free from all fault, is not only reprehended, but also
cruelly whipped, and handled like a thief with so horrible a punishment, and
yet not complaining, but as if he were ^umbe, not once opening his mouth.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider, how the sentence of his whipping being pronounced, those cruel
Butchers laid hand on the Lord of heaven, the creator of the world, and glory
of Angels, and ^ed him into the court to the place of punishment, where with
barbarous inhumanity and fury they stripped him naked, and covered him with
stripes from top to toe, as if he had been a slave,

Ponder how much our Lord, who inuesteth the heavens with clouds,
beautifyeth the fields with flowers, covers the trees with leaus, the birds
with feathers, the beasts with woll and hair, would be abashed, beholding
himself so naked and poor without any thing to cover himself vvithall, and
that before such a multitude of people that were there present, having none to
take compassion on him, nor so much at to cast a cloak over him to cover his
nakedness.

Gather hence affection of pity and compassion, seeing thy God and Lord in
such extreme need, abandoned, naked, and exposed to all ignominy, and shame,
and compassed about with his enemies, who desired to drink his blood.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider how those cruel and barbarous torme^tors having that thast and
most delicate body now naked amongst them, bound him hand and foot fast to a
pillar, that they might beat him more freely at their pleasure.

Ponder the great barbarousnes, and cruelty wherewith the^ began to lay on load
with thonges and rods, on that most tender back of thy Sa^iour, heaping
stripes upon stripes, and wounds upon wounds, vn^ill that most sacred body,
all bruized, torn and flayed, the blood bursting out and trickling down drop
after drop on every side, became so di^^igured and imbrued with blood, that his
own mother could hardly have known him.

From hence thou may gathe^ a great detestation of thy sins, for they were
the cause of so outrageous a punishment, and a great desire to chastise them
with rigorous penance and discipline.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider how the torturers being weary of scourging that innocent body of
Christ our Lord, already spent with stripes, which a mounted (as some Saints
affirm) to about five thousand, they unloosed him but he not being able to
stand on hi^ feet, fell down upon the cake of hi^ own blood that lay at the
foot of the pillar.

Ponder the solicitude and desolation of Christ our only good, who had not
there any friend or a^quaintance to help him up, but his only enemies who did
tread, kick and spurn^ him, that gathering forces out of feeblenes he might get
up again. Neither was there any who would go and advertise the most Blessed
Virgin of the extr^me need and nakedness of her beloved Son, that she might
with speed come to cover him with her veil, who so often had vvrapped him in
clothes when he was a child.

Gather hence a great confidence of the remission of thy sins, seeing this
Lord endures so much to deliver thee from them: and an earnest desire to rest
and cleave fast to the feet of Christ, kissing sometimes in spirit and devotion
the ground embrued with his most sacred blood: other times that holy pillar
bathed and enameled with the precious blood of this holy Lamb, which was shed
to make thee strong, as a pillar in the Church of God, that is to make thee
have a courageous and invincible heart to withstand thine enemies, thy p^ssions
and temptations.

THE XLV. MEDITATION.
Of the purple Garment, and Crown^ of Thorns.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how those cruel soldiers having mode an end of whipping him, they
i^uented anothet punishment to aff^ict him withal: wherefore approaching unto
our Lord Christ, they clothed him with an old scarlet cloak which was a
wearing for Kings, but they put it on him in derision and scorn, to giu^ the
people to understand that being ^ wile and base fellow, he would hau^ made
himself a King.

Ponder how Christ our Lord would be thus made a King in mockery, to declare
unto the world tha^ all the honors and Kingdoms of thi^ life are but
mockeries, and that therefore little reckoning is to be made of the^, as our
Lord himself did so little esteem them: and so that which the world
accounts an honor in others, he would undergo, thereby to be disgraced and
abased by the same world which scoffed and mocked at him.

Gather hence great compassion at the extreme dishonor which thy Lord God
suffered, and for this his humiliation, being made the scorn and mocking
stock of the people. And humbly beseech him that thou may not make so light
of him, as to contemn him through thy sins, as those soldiers did, but rather
serve and love him, desiring that he would vouchsafe to inuest and honor thee
with this his precious and costly livery, that following him (albeit the world
despise thee therefore) thou may deserve to see and enjoy him clad with the
rich and precious robes of grace and glory.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how those cruel enemies forthwith brought a cruel crown of
sea-rushes (which were certain sharp and long thorns) and fastened it on his
sacred and tender head by which on the one side he sustained intolerable pain,
and on the other extreme disgrace.

Ponder how that this crown was not of gold, nor silver, not of pearls, nor
precious stones, of rose^ nor odoriferous flowers, albeit this Lord right well
deserved it, being ^he true King of heaven and earth, but that which instead of
these they gave him, was of strong and boisterou^ b^ambles and thorns which
pierce^ his delicate head: our Lord permitting this, because thou have often
bound and crowned thy head vvit^ roses and flovvres of pleasures and delights.

Gather hence how great the bounty and charity of God is toward men, seeing
that when they are busi^ed in preparing for him so cruel an^ terrible a
crown, therewith to affli^^ and torment him, be prepares for them a crown of
glory in heaven to reward them. And seeing God teaches thee by his example,
that by the crown of thorns, the crown of glory in heaven is gained: and
that the crown of affliction which pricketh in this world, is better then that
of pleasures and delights which torment in the life to come. Procure to crown
thy self, and make choice of the first (as S. Catherine of Siena did) to avoid
the second.

THE 3. POINT.
To consider how that to increase his confusion and reproach, they after this
put into the right hand of thy sovereign King and Lord, a Reed, ^nsteed of a
Kingly scepter, and smote his head there withal, to the end that ^he world
might know that his Kingdom was hollow, vain, and without substance, and he
void of judgment and wit, making himself a King.

Ponder how our Lord Jesus did not refuse to take the reed into ^is hand, but
rather willingly accepted it, and held it fast as an instrument of his contempt.

From hence thou may gather how much it imports thee to resist and reject
honor and self estimation and to embrace humility and submission of mind, in
regard that by this way and means our soueraygne King entered into his
Kingdom: and by the same, and no other, thou must enter into the Kingdom of
heaven, which is not thine, but another to give thee, if thou desire it.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider how those fierce people more cruel then Tigers, not contenting
themselves with the former injuries, which they had done to that meek Lamb,
they add yet another injury: for bowing their knes before him in mockery and
scorn, they said unto him: Hayle King of the Jews, and presently they stroke
his divine face with a reed, deriding and making faces at him.

Ponder i^ how different a manner the celestial spirits adore thi^ great King
and Lord, from that men ador^ him on earth. The Ang^ll^ (...) him as God and
King of all things, and men adore him as a fals^ God and counterfaite King:
they cal^ him holy, holy^ and men, wicked, sinner, possessed with a Devil.

Gather hence desires thro^ghly to feel and lament thy sinne^, and that which
thy Lord and God suff^^eth: and as his loving child and true friend prostrating
thy self on the ground, adore him as thy King and Lord after another manner
the^ these ^do, and say from the bottom of thy ^art: Hayle king of heaven and
earth, King of Angels and men, save me O Lord, and admit me into thy heauen^y
Kingdom, when I shall depart this ^^iserable life.

^HE XLVI. MEDITATION.
^f the words, ECCE HOMO.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how these cruel soldiers led thy Savior in this so lamentable
a plight unto the President Pilate, who wondering to see him so ill handled,
carried him up to an eminent place, whence he might be seen of all, to the end
that moved with compassion they might cease to seek his death.

Ponder first, how much our Lord was ashamed at his appearing in so
reproachful an habit, with the crown of thorns upon his head, (...) ^eed in
his hand, a rope about hi^ neck, his body all bruized, rent wea^ ried and
exhaust with so many stripes all goare blood through the multy^ude of those
blows: and with the drops of blood which trickled dow^ his venerable face,
those lights o^ heaven were eclipsed and almost blinded.

Ponder secondly, the differenc^ between the figure wherein our S^uiour
appears now, and that whi^^ he showed in the glory of the mou^ Thabor: that
which was so glorio^^ and pleasant, he discovered only (...) three of his
dis^iples, this so paine^^ and ignominious he shows to (...) the people of
Jerusalem: that i^ mountain all alone and retired, this in the midst of a
great and populous City.

Be confounded at thy pride, seeing thy Lord so much humbled and despised for
thy sake, and thou endeauourest not to be so handled of men, but rather with
all honor and esteem, and desire that they should know the good which is in
thee, that they may praise thee.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how Pilate shevving Christ our Lord in presence of all the
people, said aloud: Behold the Man.

Ponder these words in the sense and meaning with which Pilate did pronounce
them, and thou shall find that, moved with pity to behold so woeful a
spectacle, he desired to de^i^uer Christ our Lord, and therefore the savd: Ecce
Homo, Behold this man, and you shall perceive him to be so punished that he
hardly retav^eth the shape of man, being so di^^igured and misused: wherefore in
regard that he his a man as you are, and no b^ast, have compassion on him. But
they would not affoard him a good look, nor have any pity on him.

Hence thou may gather de^^rs that God would grant thee eye^ of compassion,
and a heart of flesh, that beholding him thou may be ^oued to compassion,
seeing he suffered so much for thy sake, and giu^ thee grace to love the^ that
hate thee, seeing that in thi^ kind our sou^raign^ Lord, God and man, h^th given
the^ (...) rare an example.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider upon the said words of Ecc^ Homo, how much it behoou^th thee to
stir up thy self, and to behold with the eyes of lively ^^yth this our Lord,
and say unto thy ^oule: Ecc^ Homo, behold ^ my soul^ this man: for albeit he is
so wounded with stripes, so defiled with spittle, s^ bruized with buffets,
crowned wit^ thorns, has a reed instead of a sc^p^ter in his hand, and i^
clad with an ig^nominious garment, yet he is more then a man, he is also God.

Ponder the great desire which the Eternal Father has, that thou would
behold this sovereign Lord God and man, with meek and compassionate eyes, and
make benefit of thy time he allotteth thee to do it, and not mispend so great a
lewell, nor omit to reap profit by beholding this man: for if thou mark it
well, thou shall find that this is the man, which that sick man that lay at
the Pond stood in need of, and requi^^^ his help that he might rise and go
in^^ the pond, and be cured of his dis^a^^^ and infi^mities. This is the man
wh^ is the head o^ ^ngell^ and men, and i^ so much disgraced to honor them, so
defiled to beautify them, condemned to death to ex^mpt men from a greater
death, and to save them: finally he is the man who is mad^ the outcast of men,
to make the^ the children of God.

Gather from hence ho^ abominable a thing sin is in the sight (...) God, seeing
it brought his only So^ to such a pass, and in what case thy sins may have
left thy soul, when the sins of others ha^^ ^rought s^ stra^g an effect in
the fountain of all beauty it self, and what confusion and shame will a
sinner susta^ne for his own, seeing the Son of God has sustained so much
for the sins of other men.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider the hatred and rancour of those cruel enemies against Christ our
Lord, seeing that so lamentable and pitiful a spectacle was not able to
mollify their hearts, but rather raising their voices, they began to cry aloud:
Away, away with him out of our sight, as who wo^^d say: seeing thou have made
so good a beginning, commanding him to be whipped, make an end of that which
thou have begun, and crucify him.

Ponder, that although such and so woeful a spectacle could not ass^age and
pacify those raging minds, yet was it doubtless of force to appease the wrath of
the Eternal Father who had been moved to just indignation: for beholding his
most Blessed Son so ill handled for to obey him, and for our love, he
graciously pardoned all those sinners, who with sorrow for their sins, and with
devotion and confidence beholding this figure of their Savior, should represent
it unto him, saying: Ecce homo: Tho^ see, O Lord, the man which thou have
given us, the work of thy right hand, th^e man that is so humble, so obedient,
so meek, and so loving.

From hence thou may gather hearty sorrow and compassion to see him so much
abhorred by his own people, who deserved to be loved most of all. Endeavor
from this day forward ^o be so much the more seruent in the service of this
Lord, by how much his enemies did the deeper abhor him: so doing he will give
thee grace with pure and clear eyes to behold and imitate him.

THE XLVII. MEDITATION.
How our Blessed Savior carried his Cross.

THE 1. POINT.
To consider how the President, seated in his tribunal seat, gave final
sentence in his cause, and our Lord Jesus being condemned to the death of the
Cross, the soldiers forthwith pulled off the purple garment which they had
put on him i^ scorn, and stripping him naked, they put him to that sham again
the second time, not only before the officers, but in presence of all the
people also, and gave him back his own garment^ embrued in blood to put on.

Ponder how Christ our Lord, to carry his Cross, laid aside the garments which
others had put on him in Herod's, and Pilats house, and clothed himself with
his own, not without extreme great pain, for they cleaued fast to his sacred
wounds and were dried into them, they being now cold.

Gather hence desires to put (...) all affections un worthy the child of God,
that is, all vicious custome^ of the world, and of the flesh, wherewi^^ thou
have gone clad, and assume thos^ which are beseeming and proper to Christ, to
wit, humility, charity and the like, by which thou must be known and held for
his disciple: for this was evermore the livery of the Son of God.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how our Lord taking the Cross upon his tender and wearied
shoulders, because there was not any one found among so many* who would carry
it for him to the place of punishment (for the (...) held it an accursed thing,
and the Gen^ills esteemed it reproachful) he (...) ^orced himself to go with
it on (...) ^acke to wards mount Caluary.

Ponder how this meek La^b^ ^ull willingly spread forth his arm^^ (...)
embrace the Cross, and not with^^anding it was so heavy a burden, (...) his so
great dishonor and shameful death, he carried it with more love then he did
ever before any other crtsse, because the v^ili^y and fruit, the honor and
glory, which through the weight of this Cr^sse was to be gathered, was thine:
and it is credible that he did vvelcome it with kisses of peace, interiourly
saluting it with a thousand svveet and loving acts, fat better then S. Andrew
did the cross of his Martyrdom.

Hence thou may gather confusion and shame to be an enemy of the Cross of
Christ, flying so much ^aking of pains, and procuring to cast thy burden upon
another man's shoulders, imitating in this rather these wicked people: for if
thou were the servant of Christ, thou would be glad and rejoice to follow
him with thy Cross, although it should cost thee thy life, and should dye in
the fact.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider, how the obedient Isaac comes out of Pilats house with the
burden of the wood of the Cross upon his back. The trumpe^^ foundeth, the
common Crier cries aloud, clamours and outcryes are heard on every side, an
infinite multitude of people approach, they behold coming out of the palace
gate a lamentable, and such as was never seen before, a most afflicted
creature, doubled and ouercharged with the weight of a Cross of fitten foot
long, crowned with a crown of thorn, scarce able to stand on his feet, nor to
sustain the weight of the Cross without crouching and falling under it.

Ponder the barbarousnes of those merciless hearts against our Savior, for
instead of helping him up to rise again, and taking compassion on him, as to
make him go on that bitter and paynefull journey, they gave him a thousand
blows, kickes and spurns, saying unto him: Arise traitor, sorcerer, did
not thou say that thou went the Son of God, and he who in three days could
build up his holy Temple, why do not thou raise now thy self?

Gather hence comfort in thy ^fflictions carrying with patience and love in
imitation of our Lord Jesus, the cross which shall fall to thy lot, though it
be very heavy, and should make thee stoop, for it is impossible in this life to
want Crosses and afflictions. Trust in God and in his divine mercy, who will
provide one to assist thee to carry it, that thou may^t not be ouerloaden, and
fall under it.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider that the Blessed Virgin understanding how they carried her most
holy Son to crucify him, accompanied him in this last journey, and making
^ast, and finding means to pass through the throng of the people (according
as some deuou^ ^ontemplatiue persons observe) (...) came, (...) met her dearest
So^^e.

Ponder what may have passed betvveene these two divine ^arts, where that
^unne and M^one so sad and ^cli^sed, behold one the other* this was no doubt
one of the greatest sorrows which Christ our Lord endured, to see that me^ke
Dove his (...) come out of the ^rk^ of (...) retirement, so much grieved and
afflicted at the sight of him so disfigured, and environed with his enemies
that desired to make a final end of him, and laden with so heavy a burden
that it permitted him not to go one step more forward: the Blessed Virgin
would have helped him, but the cruel mynisters would not permit her. And this
sorrowful encounter was so moving and full of compassion, that this
peradventure was the time and place, where the women beholding it, burst out
into ^eares, bewailed and lamented hi^ so much, that the^ enforced our Lord to
say unto them, that they should not weep upon him, but upon themsel^es, and for
the sins of the people, and the punishments which for them we^e to befall
that ungrateful City. For if in the gree^e wood they do these things, in the
dry what shall be done? By which he would say: If the divine justice chastise
me so terribly for other men's sinne^, who am a green and fruitful tree* how
will he, I pray you, punish sinners, who are dry and withered stocks and
unfruitful trees, for their own sins? If I who am innocent, have been
scourged, buffited, spit upon, ^euiled, and (though I deserve nothing of all
this) do not withstanding now go with this Cross on my shoulders to be nailed
upon it, what will becom^ of the guilty, what stripes, what buffets, finally
what torments will befall them?

From hence thou may gather desires to bewail thy sins and off^ces: for they
were that which ouercharged and weighed down the wearyed ^houlders of the Lord
God, and made him stoop and (...).

THE XLVIII. MEDITATION.
How our Savior was crucified.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider that Christ ou^ Lord being arrived at mount Caluary, sore
afflicted and tired with going that long and payne^ull journey, was by those
furious soldiers with barbarous cruelty dispoyled of his sacred garments, and
because the blood was now dry and cold, his garments stuck fast to his body,
and so they again rent and flayed that mee^ lamb^, who did not open his mouth,
nor speak a word against them that thus tormented him.

Ponder, that of all the times that they stripped our Lord (which were in all
sour) this was the most painful, and most ignominious, being now stripped
and naked from top to toe, not only of his garments, but of his skin also.

Gather hence patience and longanimity in injuries and adversity, and not to be
angry, nor offended, when thou shall (...) thy self poorly apparelled, and to
want necessi^ies, seeing so rare an example, as Christ our Lord has given
thee, of s^fferances, nakedn^sse and poverty in all his life, and specially in
his death: for his nakedness must be thy garment, his dishonor thy livery, his
pouer^y thy riches, his con^usion thy glory, and his death thy life of grace
and glory.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how Christ our Lord being now naked, and the soldiers ^aying the
Cross on the ground, they commanded him to lie down upon it on his back,
that he might be nailed to it, and so he did.

Ponder first the most excellent obedience of thy Savior, which shined most in
hearing and obaying, in whatsoever hard and difficult matters those cruel
tormentors proposed unto him, giving thee an example to subject thy self to
every humane creature for his love, where there is no sin.

Ponder secondly, ^ow our Savior, lying upon that bed of the Cross, which thy
sins had prepared for him, lifted up his eyes to heaven, and rendered thanks
to his Eternal Father, for having brought him to that point, wherein he beheld
himself so poor, so dishonored, and misused for his love.

Gather hence, when thou shall see thy self in ad^ersity and distres^e, to be
resigned to the divine will in the giving Almighty God due thanks for them:
for once giving thanks to God in adversity is more worth, and of m^re merit,
then many times i^ prosperity.

THE 3. POINT.
To consider how Christ our Lord was mayled on the Cross, and the ^x^essiue
pains which he felt when those rough and boisterous nail^ e^tred, breaking the
veins, piercing (...) sinews, and renting the most tender parts of the most
delicat^ body of all bodies, enduring with great patience and love to see
himself so laden with pain^^, and full of v^^peakable sorrows.

Ponder how our Lord permitted the nails to pierce his sac^ed hands, and
divine feet, to show the^ that he should have thee always imprinted in his
hands and feet, so great was the love and holy zeal which ^e had of the
salvation of souls, and of thine in particular.

Gather hence de^ires of thy he own salvation, and of thy neighbors, setting
light by whatso^uer difficultyes, pains and trauells, which to deliver them
out of si^ne, may befall thee, that by this means, as a soldier of this
spiritual warfare, thou may imitate in some ^ort thy Captain Jesus, who
with so great love gave his life for them, hanging on the Cross.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider, that after Christ our Lord was nailed to the Cross, his enemies
lifted it up on high, with that true lamb of God upon it, who takes away the
sins of the world, letting it fall down voilently into the pit which they
had made for the purpose.

Ponder the pain, and confusion, and shame which Christ our Lord had when he
savv himself on high, naked in the midst of an open field full of
innumerable people, and as another Noe, exposed shamefu^ to the sight of all,
without any thing to cover his nakedness withal, no^ having any to affoard him
any thing but many who were ready to take from him all that might be given him.

Gather hence a great shame and confusion at the small grief, sense and
feeling thou have of the pains of our Lord, not shedding so much as on^ tear
of compassion, whereas he powers out all his blood. And seeing the insensible
creatures which want both reason and feeling made so wonderful demonstration
of sorrow at the death of this our Lord, that they were ^orne and rent in
pieces for every grief* it is good reason that thou, who art his creature, and
the cause ^hy he endured that which he did, should acknowledge, and be
thanke^ull for it, and have a special and in^ard feeling thereof, seeing he
suffe^ed it in benefit of thee.

THE XLIX. MEDITATION.
Of the seven words which our Lord spoke hanging on the Cross.

THE I. WORD.
TO consider the great charity of our Lord, which wa^ such, that before he
would comfort his Mother, before he would prouid^ for his friends, before he
would commend his spirit to his Father, he promideth his enemies of remedy.
Wherefore the first word he spoke on the Cross, was to excuse his en^mi^^, who
crucified, blasphemed, and murdered him.

Ponder, how Christ Jesus our Lord being full of grie^ous d^lors and pains in
every part of his body, no^ finding any place of rest in that har^ bed of the
Cross, even then did lif^ up his divine eyes to heaven, and shed^ding tears
of most tender love an^ compassion, opening his diui^ mouth, not to command,
that fir^^ should come from heaven, as Eli^^ prayed, but to beseech his
Eternal Father to pardon those which were there, and the sin they committed
in crucifying him.

Gather hence how exactly our Lord God fulfilleth the precept he bath given
thee: To love thine enemies, and to pray for them that persecure thee, that by
this example thou may learn and know to do the like.

THE 2. WORD.
TO consider how that the second Word, which thy Redeemer spoke, from the
chair of the Cross, was to pardon the Thief, and grant him heaven: Because
he confessed his fault and declared the innocence of Christ our Lord, and
freely, and plainly ^alling him King, craved favor a^ his hands, saying:
Lord, remember ^e, when thou shall come into thy Kingdom. And so our Lord
Jesus ^id, honoring this th^e^e before his ^ternall Father, a^ he con^essed
him ^efor^ men, ^nduing him with so exceeding great graces and priuiledes, that
being the last, (...) made him of all mortal men the first, who departing this
life should presently re^eaue the reward of glory.

Ponder, that if God rewarded him with so great liberality, who did only
follovv him, not fully three hours, how will he reward those who shall serve
and follow him with perfection, all the hours and days of their life? And if
our Lord showed himself so grateful to this sinner, who had iniuried him
innumerable times, for one only time that he confessed and honored him, what
manner of gratitude will he show to him who shall spend his whole life in
serving and honoring him?

Gather hence desires to serve him always, that securely and vvit^ confidence
thou may have acc^ss^ unto him, and ask him th^^ which this good these did
ask him saying Remember me o Lord (that is) remember not my sins, nor the
robberies which I have done, but that am a frail man, and infirm, that am thy
creature made to thy imag^ and likeness: wherefore I bese^h the to remember me.

THE ^. WORD.
TO consider, that the third word which Christ our Lord spoke from the Altar of
the Cross, was to recommend his B. Mother to Saint John and S. John unto his
Mother: And from that hour the disciple took her to his own, and loved her
with special love.

Ponder the exceeding great grief with which this word of recommandation
pierced the heart of the Blessed Virgin: for she thoroughly weighed the
inequality of the change which was made, receiving for the son of the living
God, the son of a poor fisherman: for the Master of heaven, an earthly
disciple, for the Lord, a servant, and for him that can do all things, him that
can do nothing without his grace.

Gather hence a great and earnest desire to take this Blessed Lady ^or thy
mother, and to love and serve ^er with special care: And a firm ^urpose to
obey the divine will, lear^ing to reverence, as in place of God, his creature
(that is to say) thy Superior, Father, or Master, which he shall a^^igne thee,
whosoever he be, and to serve, and obey him as God himself, as our B. Lady
did, who took S. John for her Son, and he took her for his mother.

THE 4. WORD.
TO consider the fourth Word, which Christ sesu^ our Lord spak to his Eternal
Father, repr^s^nting him the affliction which he felt, by reason of his
internal desolation of mind; for he cried with a loud voicc and said: My God,
my God, why have thou forsaken me?

Ponder how the Eternal Father permitted the most sacred humanity of his
Eternal Son, to suffer, and to continue in torment, and released him not out
of those terrible pains and sorrows which he had undertaken for our good and
remedy: neither in them did he give him any comfort or ease at all: To the
cross^ it self, he could not lean his head on any side without increase of
pain^ and grief, the thorns thrusting in deeper thereby: of this hands he had
no help, because he could not wipe away the drops of blood which ran down
from his head upon his face; nor the tears which he did shed from his eyes,
they being nailed fast to the Cross. Neither of his feet, for they were not
able to sustain the poyse of ^is body, but rent themselves with ^reater
pain. Wherefore our Lord ^eeing himself so afflicted, cried vn^to his Eternal
Father and said: My God why have thou forsaken me?

Gather hence sorrow and compassion to see that there is scarce any that make
benefit of his passion, or that accompany our Lord in his hard (...) painful
t^auels: foz his disciples (...) forsaken him, his people abandoed him, and
many men lost their faith which before they had in him. Harti^^ beseech him,
that he will not for^^ke thee now, nor at the hour of (...) death.

THE 5. WORD.
TO consider how that our Savior being now quite and clean exhaust, and his
body though the abundance of blood which he had shed* being dried up, and all
the conduit^ of his veins emptied, he had natura^ly a most grievous thirst,
and therefore he said: I thirst.

Ponder how great grief pierced the soul of the B. Virgin, seein^ her beloved
Son, and her God (...) abandoned and destitute of all manner of ease and
comfort: for asking little water to cool his thrist with^^ there was no body
that would give him: and albeit she could have go^^ for water, she durst not
leave hi^ fearing least in the mean time (...) should depart this life, seeing
him no^ at the point of death.

Ponder secondly that beside^ corporal thirst which our Lord (...) had, he had
a much greater thirst other three things. First he had insatiable thirst to
obey his eter^ Father in all things, without (...)ting any thing how painful
soeu^ should be* And because he knew it to be the will of God, that they should
give him vinegar and gall, he would not omit to fulfill his will in accepting
that also. His second thirst was an inflamed desire to suffer for our sakes,
far more then he had yet suffered. The third thirst was of the salvation of
souls, and in particular of thine, and that thou would serve him with
perfection.

Gather hence confusion and shame, seeing that thy thirst is not to suffer for
Christ our Lord, nor to be obedient, patient, humble and poor as he was, but
to have plenty of all things, and that nothing be vvan^ing even for
superfluous expenses. Beseech him to grant thee some pra^ticall knowledge of
the thirst which ^e had, that thou may become his ^isciple in something.

THE 6. WORD.
To consider that the sixth word, that Christ our Lord spoke from the ^aire of
the Cross was: Cons^ma^m est, It is consumate, all what so^uer my Father
commanded me to suffer from the cribbe unto the Cros^^ is accomplished and
ended.

Ponder how thy Lord who now in this chair of ignominy rea^^dy to give up the
Ghost, will come^the day of judgment in another ve^^ different throne of glory
and maies^ to judge, and will say in like mann^this word: Consummatum est: no^
the world is at an end, and the vay^ pomp and glory thereof* now (...)
delights of the wicked are past, (...) also the travels of the just.

From hence thou may gath^^ desires t^ live in such sort, that at (...) hour
of thy death, thou may (...) with S Paul: I have consumated (...) course, I
have ended my life, wher^^as a good Christian, or as a good R^ligious man, I
have fulfilled the ob^^ gations of my state. But if thou (...) been slack and
remiss in this, (...) may not say, It is consumated, (...) now my pain and
eternal woe beg^^neth. Beseech our Lord to give (...) grace, that thou may
begin from (...) day forward, and continue to the (...) in his holy service.

THE 7. WORD.
TO consider that the last word which our Lord spoke on the Cross, be^^g now
ready to give up the Ghost, ^as to commend his spirit into the ^ands of his
Eternal Father.

Ponder first that he says not, I ^^mend unto thee my livings or pos^^ssions,
for he has none: not my honor, for he is not much follicitous ^erof: not my
body, for ^^at is not that which he regards most; but his spirit, which is
the principal, and ought ^ost to be reckoned of by man.

Ponder secondly, that our Lord ^oth not only commend unto his Fa^^er his own
^^irit alone, but also the spirit of his elect, which he esteemet^ (...) his.

Gather hence desires in thy lif^ (...) and in the hour of thy death (...)
^^mmend thy spirit into the hands of ^od, for thereon depends the eter^^^ll
w^ale of thy soul.

THE L. MEDITATION.
Of the taking down from the Cross* and of the burial of our Lord.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider, that the evening o^ that sad and dolef^ll da^ being now come,
the Blessed Virgi^ being poor, and besides destitute o^ all help, knew not
which way to tur^^e her self: for there was no bod^ that would bring her a
ladder to tak^ down the body of her beloved Son^^ neither had she any body to
assist h^ disciple Saint John, and the night dre^^on, and every one be took
himself (...) his home. At last she saw two princi^pall men coming, Joseph,
and Nico^demus, who brought necessaryes for the burial.

Ponder how our Lord God o^ dayned, that because his most Hol^ Son had a
poor and reproach fu^^ death, he should have a rich and glor^^ous sepulcher,
and that whereas (...) disgraces had been such and so great ^his honor also
and exal^ation should begin even from the Cross, many of his enemies even then
confessing him to have been the Son of God. And therefore he ordained that
Io^^ph should join with Nicodemus, and that both together shoud stoutly, and
without respect or sear of the jews undertake that enterprise.

Gather hence desires that God would vouchsafe to touch thy heart ^ith the
virtue and force of his di^^ine inspiration, that making no ac^^ount of humane
fear, nor of the say^^ngs of men, thou may with great ^^rtitude and zeal
set upon whatso^^uer shall be for the service, honor, (...) glory of his divine
Majesty, as these ^aints did.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider that these holy men, having first obtained leave of the ^resident
Pilate, to bury the body of ^^eir Master, came to the place where ^ur Lord
Jesus remained hanging ^n the Cross, and having comforted ^e afflicted and
sorrowful Mother, and craved her license t^ mount ^^to the Cross, she
willingly (...) them.

Ponder first how they kneeled down upon their knees, an^ with exceeding
great de^otion mad^ their payers to Christ crucified, saying: O good Lord, thou
did per^it that those sacrilegious hands, which have entreated thee in thi^
manner and put thee upon the cross, should hale and pull thee so irreue^renly,
gra^nt that the hands of these thy devout servants may with re^erence touch thy
sacred body and tak^ (...) down from the Cross. Whe^^ they had said these or
the like word^ with many tears rearing the ladder^ they mounted up with great
silenc^ to the Cross, and took down the holy body, and placed it in the
arme^ of his most Blessed Mother, who t^ receive it, and to wash it with her
tear^ ^^te her self down, having ever be^fore stood constant at this rufull
an^ ^orrowfull tragedy.

Ponder secondly the ang^is^ and grie^e of mind, that the Blesse^ Virgin felt
when she beheld and im^braced that sacred body of her Son and our Lord so
mangled, how she held him fast in her arms, and laid her face between the
thorns of his ^acred head, and joined her face to the face of her Beloved
Son. O ^ovv would this sovereign Lady ^hen rem^ber how far different kisses
and imbracings were these from those which she had given him in his nati^^ity
and childhood, and what diffe^^ence there was between these days and those
which she had spent with ^im in Bethleem and in Hierusa^em! ^ow clear was
that night of his na^^^ty, and how dark and obscure (...) this day of his
passion? How rich (...) she in the stable, and how poor (...) the Cross? And
if when she lost (...) whiles he was yet alive, she was (...) much grieved and
a^^licted for his ^^sence; how great was her sorrow ^ere, seeing him dead in
her arms, (...) in so vvocfull a shap^? without (...) it was a sword of so
exc^ssiue (...) unto her, that it pri^rced he^ (...) soul and heart.

Gath^r hen^e desires that our Bl^ssed Lady would vouchsafe to give thee
license, to adore him in spi^rit, and to kiss, and have in thy arme^ her most
holy Son, as she held him in hers: and obtain for thee some in^vvard grief
and feling of the Passion and death of her God and thy Lord to the end that
thou may be par a^ ker of his trauells, seeing thou hope ^ hoaue part of his
joys and Resu^ rection.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider how that after the mo^ Blessed Virgin had held the dea^ body of
her Blessed Son for some time in her lap, Joseph and Nicode^mus, fearing
least she should dy^ with grief, besought her with all hu^mility and respect,
she would moderate her sorrow, and give them leau to bury him; she yielded to
their r^ quest: and forthwith those holy me anointed him with Mirrhe, an^
wrapped him in a clean syndon, and c^ (...) his face with a napkin.

Ponder the love which Chr^ our Lord had to poue^ty: for (...) would not that
the Myrrh wher^^ with they anointed him, the napkin, and sheet in which they
foulded him, should be his own, but another, his sepulcher borrowed, and as
i^ were lent him of alms.

Hence thou may gather to love poverty, which this our Lord loved so much,
exercising thy self in this virtue, in life and death, as he did: because if
thou renounce not all that thou possessest in imitation of him, thou can not
be his disciple.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider how the body of our Lord being anointed and bound in a white
syndon, they found means to carry him, and bury him in a new monument which was
in a new garden, hard by the place where he was ^rucifyed, and there they laid
the holy ^ody of our Savior. And when the ^. Virgin saw, that there she was to
^aue him, whom her soul loved so much, and the treasure of her heart, then ^er
grief began a fresh, and she fell to ^ment her solitude.

Ponder how he, who is the plendour and brightness of the Father, the glory of
Angels, the salvation and life of men, refuseith not to be straightened and pressed
together as it were, and enclosed every day in the loathsome and stinking
sepulcher of our breasts covering his sac^ed body, with the white veil of the
accidents or form of bread.

Gather from hence desires to be^seech this Lord, that seeing he vouch safeth
to straiten, as it were, himself and to enclose himself so often in thy
sepulcher, to the end thou may re^eaue and eat him, being as thou ar^ a
silly and vile worm, he would als^ renew thee with virtues, that so thy
sepulcher may become and remayn^ clean and pure, as if no dead thing ha^ (...)
some in it.

THE THIRD BOOK OF MEDITATIONS, Appertayning to the Unitive Way.
What is the Unitive Way.

THE end of the Vniti^^ Way, is to unite and join our soul with God by
perfect union sloue, being glad when we con^^der his innumerable and infinite
^ches and perfections, reioy^ng at (...) infinite glory, power, and wis^me,
desiring that he be ^^^wne of all the world, and that his holy and divine will
be done and performed in all creatures. For this is the way by which those who
arrive to the perfect state of virtue, do walk, exercising themselves in the
contemplation of the impassible and glorious life of Christ our Lord.

THE 1. MEDITATION.
How our Lord descended into Limbo, and of his glorious Resurrection.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how our Lord Jesus Christ, having finished the con^bate of his
Passion, to accomplish fully the business of our salvation, as soon as he had
given up h^^ sacred Ghost, leaving his body dea^ on the Cross, in soul he
descende^ to the lowest parts of the earth, into Limbus, to deliver the souls
of tho^ holy Fathers that were there, and (...) carry them with him to heaven.

Ponder how our Lord, thou^^ he were so mighty and powerfu^^ that he could
with one only word have delivered out of Limbo those holy souls, without
descending thither personally (as he did with Lazarus when he called him out
of his sepulcher) he would not withstanding descend thither, to discover by
this heroical act of humility the love he bare unto them.

From hence thou may gather to perform by thy self, the business which God
commands unto thee of helping of souls, how mean soever they seem,
humbling thy self as Christ our Lord humbled himself on earth, that thou
may be exalted in heaven.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider the great joy which the soul of Christ our Lord had, ^eeing it
self to vanquish death, to ^riumph over hell, and to glorify such multitude of
souls as were there in Limbo. How well would he then ^hinke the labors of the
Cross employed, seeing the fruit which that sa^ed tree began now to yield.

Ponder the wonderful joy and exultation which those holy Fathers received
(who for so many thousand of years, with such patience, considence and
expectation, had looked for that happy hour of their ransom and liberty) when
they saw that Blessed soul of Christ their Redeemer triumphant in those
bottomless pits, and obscure d^ngeons of hell, destroying with his divine virtue
and power the gates of brass, and iro^ bars of that dungeon, and turning
that obscure and monefull place into a joyful and pleasant Paradise.

Gather hence a firm considence in God, when thou shall find thy self
assaulted with sundry sorrows and afflictions, and be not wearied, afflicting
thy self for continu^ ance of them, seeing there is no tim^ that comes not
at last, nor any evil that has not an end, as the im^ prisonement of those
Saints had (...) happy end.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider how that most Bles^^ soul of thy Savior, accomp^ ^yed with that
resplendent and brigh^ shining army of holy Fathers, came with them to the
sepulcher, where his body lay disioynted, disfigured and wrapped up in a winding
sheet.

Ponder that the first thing which our Lord did, was to dis^ouer unto them the
lamentable shape of his sacred body, that they might understand how dear their
ransom had ^ost him: and when they beheld that holy body all black and blew,
out of joint, and so bruized and mangled (...) every side, they yielded again
^^to the deliverer infinite thanks for ^uing redeemed them with so great
^^bours and pains.

Ponder, secondly, how that as ^one as that Blessed soul entered a^ine into
that body which was more ^^^figured then any body ever was, transformed it into
a far more ex^^lle^t shape then it had on the mount ^abor, and made it a
thousand times ^^re beautiful and resplendent then (...) Sun. And with a
joyful coun^^^^nce he arose out of the sepulcher, mortal and glorious,
without re^^uing the stone from the place which was laid upon the sepulcher as
he issued out of the sacred bowell of the mo^^ Blessed Virgin, vvithou^ damage
of her integrity and purity.

Out of all this thou may ga^ there affections of thanksgiving, (...) laud
and praise to the Eternal Father for that he has converted the sorro^ of his
most Blessed Son into so v^ speakable joy, and so incomparab^^ beauty,
communicating unto his b^ die the prerogatives of immortalit^ and glory.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider that Christ our Lord when he was risen again, did n^^ forth with
mount up to heaven, which is the seat due to glorified bodies but remained in
the world for t^^ space of forty days, to comfort an^ animate his disciples,
informing the of many things concerning the Kin^ dome of God, that being eye
witn^ ses of his Resurrection, they mig^ preach it more considently to (...)
world: and it may piously be thou^^ that at that time all the quiers of Angels
came down to gratulate his victory, and to celebrate the feast of ^is glorious
triumph: for if they destended to celebrate his Nativity, when he came to live
here a mortal and passibe life, with great reason may we think they came at
his Resnrrection, when he began to live an immortal and glorious life.

Ponder how the heavenly spirits with Angelical harmony renewed that canticle
of the Nativity: Glory in ^he highest to God, and in earth peace (...) men of
good will: and with great ^son, seeing that by means of this ^uce, of enemies
we were made fri^ds, of s^ues of sin and the devil, we ^^re made children and
heirs of hie ^bry.

Gather hence desire^ to rejoice to ^ay with the holy Prothet: This the day
which our Lord has made, us rejoice, and be glad therein. Deing that all may
do the like, and a^^ him, for that he has gotten so ^rious a triumph, and
victory over his enemies.

THE II. MEDITATION.
Of our Saviors apparition unto h^^ most Blessed Mother.

THE ^. POINT.
To consider that the first visit, and apparition which Christ Jesus our Lord
made, is thought t^ have been to the most Blessed Virg^ his Mother, to clear
that Heau^ darkened and ouercast with sorrow and to dry the ^louds of tears
from those virginal eyes, which had we^ so much, and above al others had (...)
the sorrovves and afflictions of (...) Passion, and of his absence.

Ponder how the Blessed V^^gin being in her retirement, not sleep, but in
prayer, expected (...) new light, with lively says, and sured hope of the
Resurrection of ^ Son, medi^ating those words the Royal Prophet: Arise my
glo^ arise my psalter and harp, and reio^ with thy music those that are (...)
and lament thy absence, And if vid contemplating his God and Lord so far off,
had such a thirst and longing desire to be partaker of his Resurrection, how
great desires had the most Blessed Virgin (loving him and desiring him much
more then David) being so near to the time, and every ^oment expecting to see
and enjoy ^gayne her beloved Son, now glo^ious in his Resurrection.

Gather hence like affections and ^esires. And beseech this our Lord that he
will vouchsafe to rise in thy ^ule, to visit and comfort it, as he ^d his most
holy Mother, that thou ^^yst deserve to see and enjoy him ^ his glory at the
general Resurre^ion.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how the Blessed Virgin our Lady being in this con^mplation and
these Ionging desires, ^ most holy Son entered in, and ^unifested himself
unto her, with all ^ glory and brightness which his sa^ed body had,
stre^gthening her cor^iall sight to be able to behold him, (...) enjoy him.

Ponder how great the joy of the Blessed Virgin was, when she saw the body of
her most sweet Son no^ now hanging amiddst thieves, bu^ environed with
Angels and Saint not reco^mending her from the cross^ to the beloved disciple,
but himself giving her a loving kiss of peace not dissigured as he was at his
death but resplendent and beautiful. O ho^ fully content and satisfied did she
re^ main with this comfortable sigh^ how sweetly did they embrace on another,
what tender speech and in wa^^ feelings would there pass betwee^ those two
blessed hearts!

From hence thou may gath^^ desires to give thanks unto this Lord who is so
certain a friend and so read to comfort those who suffer for h^ love: for
according to the measure his Mother sorrows he gave her (...) s^lation and
joy: so if thou accomp^ nie Christ crucified in his pains ^ Passion, thou
shall also be partak of his rest, and shall rise as he did, to new life of
glory.

THE 3. POINT.
To contemplate the most Blessed Virgin enjoying those graces and ^^uours which
her most Blessed Son had done her, and what tender, pleasant and loving
discourses he held with her, perchance these or such like: Mother, behold thy
Son, I do not now recommend thee from the Cross to my disciple John; I do
not call thee woman, thou do not hold me dead in thine arms, but ^ehold I am
alive and risen again, and ^ come to bestow on thee a thou^nd embraces, and to
show thee the ^peciall love and affection which I bear ^hee.

Ponder the joy that wholly pos^essed the soul of this most Blessed ^ady, when
she saw her self so fauo^ed, honored and cherished, and ^vith such love,
vviping away the ^eares from her virginal eyes, full of ^euotion doubtless,
and prostrating ^er self upon the ground, she would ^dore him, and say: O my
Son and ^y God, I give thee infinite thanks, ^r that according to the
multiuude of my sorrovves, my consolation have abounded. And making no en^ of
kissing those Blessed signs of the sacred wounds which yet remayn^ In his
glorious body, and had cause unto him so great pain in his pass^ on, and
seeing them now, so beaut^ full and shining, they were a cause ^ great confort
unto her.

Gather hence desires to gi^^ thanks unto this Lord for so special and singular
savors done unto h^ Blessed Mother, as to one most wo^ thy thereof: for
disposing thy sel^ to a good life, holy desires and work^ he will do thee the
like favor a^ graces, albeit thou be unworthy the of.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider how well accompaned Christ our Lord was, when came to visit his
beloved Moth^ with that most bright shining squ^ dron and troop of so many
Sai^ which he had delivered from Limb^ where diverse of them had, for so m^ ny
thousands of years, expected enjoy him in heaven.

Ponder how that when all those ^^ints saw themselves in presence of (...) B.
Virgin our Lady, acknowleding her for the mother of their Re^eemer, and bruizer
of the infernal ser^ents head, they would kneel down ^prostrate themselves
upon the gro^nd, yielding her a thousand thanks ^ congratulations, for such a
Son ^ she had there, and for the pains she ^ad taken in the work of their
Re^mption.

Ponder secondly, how glad and ^yfull the Blessed Virgin was to see ^e fruit of
the Passion which now the ^red tree of the holy Cross began yield, in so many
souls ransomed (...) with. O how well employed did ^ B. Lady then account all
those af^tions, sorrows, labors, trauaills pains which pierced her soul all
life time, seeing that which then saw, and enjoying that which then enjoyed.

Hence thou may gather de^ to associate and join thy self ^h this holy
company, to adore and ^rence this most Holy Virgin: for the Mother of such a
Redeemer, a^ knowledging that by her meames, thou take her for thy Patroness,
an^ become truly devout unto her, tho^ may (by the grace of God) be pa^ taker
of the glory and eternal bliss^ which thou hopest to enjoy in he^^en.

THE III. MEDITATION^
Of the apparition of Christ to S. M^ ry Magdalen.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how S. Mary M^ dalen upon Sunday very ea^ came to the monument,
bri^ ging with her odoriserous oyntm^ and aromaticall spices to anoint masters
body: and not finding hi^ she thought that he had been stoll^ which occasioned
in her soul n^ grief and sorrow: for before the w^ because her Lord was dead,
and because they had taken him a way put him she knew not where. An^ she stood
at the monument, and co^ not depart then^e, but said: O may^ (...), where art
thou? where shall I seek thee my joy? my life? where (...) they put thee? O
Lord whither shall I go? where may I seek thee? ^^ome shall I ask for thee?

Ponder how muoh the earnest and longing desire, the ^boundant and ^eruent
tears of this holy sinner, ^rought in the loving breast of God: ^r by her
tears she obtained pardon ^her sins, by tears she obtained ^he resurrection
of her deceased bro^her, by her tears she deserved to ^ue Angels for her
comforters, yeal ^d the Lord of Angels himself, and ^be the first unto whom
our Saui^r did appear.

Gather hence a great shame and ^susion for that thou so little feel ^d
lamentest thy sins, having by ^em so often lost God and his grace. ^t if thou
desire to find and not to ^se him, imitate this holy and sfer^^t woman, not
taking comfort in thing until thou find and possessd Creator: for if thou
seek in ^sort, thou shall find him, and he will comfort thee with (...) sight
an^ presence.

THE 2. POINT.
To consider how that our Sauiou^ seeing the holy desires of his di^ciple,
would now without further d^ l^y fulfill them, appearing unto he yet,
disguised, so that she might (...) know him! and speaking unto he^ (...) a
different voice from that he vv^ wont to use unto her, he said: W^ man, why
weepest thou? vvhom^ seek thou? And she answered him Because they have taken
a way m^ Lord, and I know not where the have put him.

Ponder, that when this sinner b^ fore wept at the feet of Christ, and w^ shed
them with the tears of her ey^ our Lord said not to her: Why w^ pest thou? nor,
whom seek tho^ because those tears proceeded fr^ the self knowledge of
her sins, from a lively faith and love of Lord, whom she had present, w^
knew and approved them: but in^ guard these tears proceeded out of norance, and
want of faith, bew^ ^ing him as dead who lived, and see^ung the living among
the dead, he says: Why weepest thou? whom ^eekest thou? For doubtless thou
snowest not, because knowing thou would not lament for me in this manner,
neither would thou seek him as absent, whom thou have pre^^m with thee.

Gather hence desires to examine and discuss well the cause of thy ^eares,
because many times thou wile ^^rswade thy self that thou weepest ^r thy
sins, and thou do not, ^t for the temporal loss which they ^aue caused
thee. And other whiles ^hou wilt think that thou lamentest ^ith desire to see
and enjoy God, yet ^^ou do not, but only tofly the tra^ell which thou
endurest. And in like ^anner thou will think that thou ^okest God and his
glory, and in very ^ed thou seek thy self, and thine ^ne honor and
commodity. And ^^king God in this ^ort, with good ^son he will ask thee: Whom
see^ thou! Seek therefore G^d in ^th sore, that he may approve thy tears and
say unto thee and unto all Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be
comforted.

THE 3. POINT.
To consider the mercy of our Lord who would not long conceal^ himself, but
forth with meekly an^ lovingly discovered himself unto h^ disciple calling her
as he accustome^ Mary. And the presently acknow^ledging his voice, ansvvered,
Ma^^ster: and seeing her Lord and her Go^ glorious and risen to life, she ador^
him.

Ponder how far the joy, a^ miration, devotion and astonishme^ she conceived of
so great a wonde^ might extend it self, finding so mu^ more then she desired:
for seeking dead body she found her Lord ali^ and victorious over death. And
(...) sting her self at his feet she vvou^ have adored and kissed the most
cred signs of his wounds that vv^ beautiful and resplendent: but o^ Lord
would not permit her as the saying: Do not touch me: for I ha^ not yet
ascended to my Father, thou think, I am not to leave thee so soon, neither
shall this be the last time that thou shall see me: for he fulfilled her
desires when he appeared to the women, with whom she also was.

From hence thou may gather seruent desires to seek God: for if thou
exercise thy self in the virtues of love, and devotion, patience and
perseverance in which this holy sinner exercised her self seeking our Lord, be
assured that (albeit thou have been as great a sinner as this his dis^ble as)
he will show thee his mercy, ^raunting thee that which he gave unto her, to
wit, to see her Lord and ^ayster risen and glorious.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider the infinite charity of thy Redeemer in honoring sin^ers truly
penitent, since that he chose ^ran eye witness of his Resurrection woman, a
notorious sinner, and that he should deserve this ^sapn^ the Apostles, yea
b^^fore the (...) of the Apostles, and before the ^sciple singularly belou^d
thoue the rest of the Apostles, because with so many tears and such
perseverance she had sought the Blessed body of her Lord.

Ponder how that the multitud^ of sins past, do not prejudice, when they are
recompensed with greate^ seruour present. Wherefore in regard that Magdalen was
emine^t in perfor^ming many things that others di^ not for the love of Christ
(as we ha^^ said in her 25. Meditation of the secon^ book) and was present,
and accompa^ nied him at mount Caluaty, and ass^ sted at his burial: even so
she (...) most favored and cherished of all.

Gather hence, courage and con^ dence that thou be not dismayed at the multitude
of thy sins: for if tho^ some in time, and art diligent in the se^ nice of
God, excelling therein through particular services, he will bestow (...) thee
special graces and favors, the thou may deserve to see and e^^ him for ever
in his glory.

THE IIII. MEDITATION.
Of Christ his apparition to the Apostle Saint Peter.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how Saint Peter and S. John went to the monument, and entering in,
saw only the linen clothes wherein his holy body had been vvrapt, and the
napkin lying at one side, which they took for a certain sign of his
Resurrection, as the women had told them.

Ponder, how that amongst the disciples of Christ, Peter and John were the
most seruent, and who ^^celled most in the love of Christ ^ Lord: for although
these Apo^les knevv right well of the persecu^on that the jews raised against
the ^ciples of Christ, keeping watch^n at the monument; they resolved
^uertheles to go and see how matters ^ssed.

Gather hence, how the love of ^d makes all things easy, ouermaistereth and
preuayleth against difficulties, be they never so great. Beseech him to grant
thee that love and charity which he gave to his Apostls, that laying aside
humane fear, thou may seek him, and enter whereso ever he shall be.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how these Apostles returning to their lodging, Saint Peter
retired himself to pray al alon^ and to ruminate upon this mystery and
meruayling with himself at tha^ which he had seen and done, ou^ Lord
appeared unto him risen an^ glorious.

Ponder first the singular content and joy that bathed the heart (...) the holy
Apostle, when he perceiue^ him present, whom his soul loue^ and desired. With
how lively a fa^^ of the Resurrection would he say I verily believe o Lord
that thou a^^ Christ, the Son of the living Go^ with what devotion and tears
vvoul^ he cast himself at the feet of his Lo^^ and Master, who had done the
sam^ unto him the night of his Passion, deeming himself un worthy of such a
sight and presence, would repeat those words which he had spoken upon
another occasion, to wit: Go forth from me o Lord, because I am asinnefull
man. But by how much the more he humbled and debased himself, the greater were
the prerogatives and favors he bestowed upon him.

Ponder secondly, what it was whereby Saint Peter made himself worthy of this
apparition, and thou ^halt find, that it was the prayer and meditation of the
thing he had seen in the monument.

Gather hence desires to be a lo^er of prayer, because that, and a good, ^ife,
repentance of our sins, and purpose of amendme^t are the means ^redemy to
find, see, and enjoy Christ ^sen and glorious.

THE 3. POINT.
^o consider how that the holy Apostle enjoying that sovereign ^ght and
presence of Christ risen, (...) Lord would say unto him; Peace to thee, it is
I, fear not, thy sins are forgiven thee.

Ponder how much S. Peter would be abashed, and blush to see himself in the
presence of his master calling to mind how he had denied and offended him: and
it is credible, that he would abundantly renew his tears, weeping bitterly,
and lamenting his sin, and craving again pardon thereof.

From hence thou may gather how meruaylous great the divine mercy is toward
all those who heartily bewail their sins and do penance for them. Wherefore
if thou lamentest thy sins, although thou be a greater sinner the^ this Apostle
was and so un worthy to receive favor and benefits; yet coming in time thou
shall make thy self worthy o^ his soueraygne apparitio^ in the King^ dome of
his glory.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider how Christ our Lord having visited S Peter, said vnt^ him: Go,
and confirm thy brethe in the faith of this mystery: and so h^ our Lord
vanishing out of his sigh^ betook himself presently with great joy and content
to the place where his companions were, to confirm them in faith, as his
master had given him in charge. And the testimony he gave of the Resurrection
of our Lord was so effectual and strong, that many believed in him.

Ponder the great desire God has of thy salvation, and that thou should know
the mystery of his Resurrection, giving thee masters to instruct and declare
it unto thee, and that thou should believe in him thereby to obtain eternal
life.

And gathering hence desires to be grateful unto our Lord endea^our to make
benefit of the favor thou shall receive at his divine hand, ^o confirm thy
brethren in virtue with thy examples and words, that they may glorify and
praise him.

THE V. MEDITATION.
Of Christ his apparition unto the two disciples that went to Emmaus.

THE 1. POINT.
To consider, the desolation and sorrow wherewith the two disciples going to a
town called Emmaus, talked and reasoned with themselus of the pains and
Passion of Christ our Lord; who approaching went with them, and vouchsafed to
accompany them in this voyage, but their eyes were held they might not know
him: meaning to discover unto them, in the end of the journey, his glorious
Resurrection.

Ponder the love of Christ towordes these two disciples, since the small and
sl^nder faith they had of his Resurrection, was not a cause to with dravv him
from their company, be^cause he is infinitely delighted to (...) with them who
speak and discours^ of holy things, who says: Where there be two or three
gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them.

Gather hence how fit and beseeming a thing it is ever to talk of God, and to
entertayne thy self in like discourses with thy companions, especially in time
of affliction: since our Lord is at hand to comfort them converting their sorrow
and de^olation into joy and content. And contrary wise how ill it is to speak
of profane and bad matters, because such do banish and exclude Christ Ie^us
from their company, and he flies from them.

THE 2. POINT.
To consider how Christ our Lord encountered these his two seruant^ (...) a
pilgrims weed, and (as if he had ^ot known) said unto them: What (...) these
communications that yo^ ^onferre one with another walking, (...) are sad?

Ponder that our Lord is not ^nly glad and recreated for that ha^ (...) endured
so much as he has, yea (...) death it self, being so reproachful and
ignominious, but desire^^ that all should hear it recounted an^ spoken off.
And therefore he asked hi^ disciples (which he, as an eye vvit^ nesse, knew
right well) of what they only by hear sa^ treated off, for their fear and
cowardlines had caused the^ to fly.

Gather hence confusion and shame, considering how forgetful thou at of what
our Lord suffered for thee, whereas thou having done and sustained so little
for him, no^ withstanding most mindful thereof expecting that he reward and
crown^ thy flender service, and desirous to b^ esteemed as one who has
traveled and endured much for the love o^ God, yea and art discontented to be
o^ therwise reputed.

THE 3. POINT.
To consider how our Lord ha^ uing heard them, forthwith be^ began to rid and
deliver them from the^^ ignorance, and reprehending the^ for their incredulity
and hardness o^ heart, proved unto them by authorit^ out of the Prophets, how
Christ ough^ to have suffered, and so to enter into his glory.

Ponder that if it were necessa^y that Jesus Christ should suffer such and so
grievous injuries and reproaches thereby to enter into glory, which was his by
inheritance, as being the ^aturall Son of God; how will it be possible that
thou, who art a servant (...) spendst all thy life in co^tentme^ts, pleasures
and vanities, should enter into glory, which is not thine, but that it must
cost thee a Cross, mortificati^^s and afflictions: for costing God (...) this,
^houldst thou enjoy it at free ^ost? that is, for nothing?

From hence thou may gather ^esires to imitate in some thing thy Captain
Ies^^, with a great fear least ^hy want of faith be a just cause why ^hou
deseruest to be reprehended of ^s divine majesty, and held as foolish and slow
of heart to believe and vnder^ and his divine Misteryes.

THE 4. POINT.
To consider that as these holy pilgrims drew near to the town vvhither
they went, our Lord made femblance to go further: but they with much instance
and entreaty forced him, saving: Tarry, because it i^ toward night, and the
day is nov^ far spent.

Ponder that howsoever Christ our Lord made semblance to go further, his
intention and desire was t^ remain with them, to impart vnt^ th^egrave;e that
toothsome repast, and to open their eyes and manifest himself vn^^ to them, as
he did in this occasion, r^freshing and feeding them with his ^^cred body: for
his delights are to b^ and converse with the children (...) men.

Hence thou may gather confusion and shame, that thy deligh^ are not to be
with God, nor to dra^neere and converse with him, but withdravv thy self from
him, and (...) to discourse and treat of him, but the vain, transitory, and
peri^^^^ things of this world; not reflec^^^ how that the day of thy life
passes on, and hasteneth to an end, and the night of thy death approaches,
wherein thou art to give an account to God of all.

THE VI. MEDITATION.
Of his apparition to the Apostles upon Easter Day.

THE 1. POINT.
To consider how Christ our Lord appeared to his Apostles, being gathered
together, v^on the day of his Resurrection.

Ponder the great care our Sa^iour has to visit his beloved dis^iples:
forgetting the small ^idelity ^hey showed him in his Passion, when ^ leaving
him in the hands of his ^^emies, they all fled, and forsook ^im.

Gather hence desires of grati^de to this Lord, who many times ^oardeth thee
spiritually, that which did to his Apostles visibly and cor^ally: for albeit
thou have been so ungrateful and dislovall unto him, shonned, forsaken and
fled from him many times, he nevertheless omiteth not oftentime^ to visit ^hee
with his divine inspirations, giving himself also unto thee with great lone
corporally, as often as thou comme^ ^o receive him in the most B. Sacr^ment.

THE 2. POINT.
To consider how our Lord entered in to his disciples, having the doors of the
house shut, where they were retired for fea^e of the Jews, our Lord entering
in far bette^ then the Sun enters through the chinks of the windows, to
awak^ the sleepy, and to rid the fearful of their dread.

Ponder, that the causes why ou^ Lord entered to visit his disciples the door
being shut, amongst other^ were these: The first was to manife^ unto them, that
his body being glorified, he could enter and penetra^ by the grace of
subtility, whithe^ foe^e^ he would, without any obst^cle or let at all. The
second, to man kno^ne unto them the efficacy of his (...). The third, and that
which ma^eth most for thy purpose, is to teach thee, that Gods' holv will and
pleasure is thou should keep shut ^he gates and windows of thy har^, which
are thy senses, that thieves may not enter thereat, which are the ^iuells, to
rob and spoil the fruit of a good conscience.

Gather hence lively and eff^ctu^ll desires, from this day forwards to be very
vigilant and circumspect ^^er the guard and custody of thy ^oule, powers and
senses, not permit^ing them to wander without bridle (...) pursuit of
creatures. And so doing ^^e Lord and owner thereof will ent^^ to replenish her
with true joy and ^omfort.

THE 3. POINT.
^o consider how our Lord, the disciples being thus gathered to^ather, came
with a cherfull coun^ance, and placing himself in the ^iddest of them (which
is the place him who makes peace, to infi^^te thereby, that for this effect he
had come into the world, and that this was which he had negotiated and brought
to pass by his death) said unto them: Peace be with you.

Ponder how great a friend Christ our Lord is of peace, since the first word he
uttered, by the ministry of his Angels, when he came into the world was
giving peace to men. And being in the world he said to his Apostles: My peace I
give unto you. And being to depart out of the world: My peace I leave to vou^
purchased by my death and Passion. Whence it follows by good con^sequence,
that our Lord recommended unto us in life and death, nothing so much as peace:
and because sinn^ had been cause of so great emnit^ between God and man,
Christ ou^ Lord vouchfased (thereby to reconcile and set us at peace with his
Eternal Father) to receive the blows o^ his rigorous justice upon that sacre^
humanity, rent and torn in a tho^sand places, and setting himself (...) the
midst, to say: Peace be vvi^ you.

Hence thou ma^st gather two things; the first, how often thou being at emnity
with God, he has in^^ted thee to peace, and thou have not ^dmitted it, n^uer
ceasing to war against him with thy sins. The se^ond, how little peace thou
have kept with thy neighbor, falling out with ^im for matters of small
importance and trifles. Beseech this Lord who is God of peace, to come into thy
soul ^ grant thee that which the world cannot give, establishing peace
be^vvene thy soul and thy spirit, be^eene thy powers and senses, be^eene his
Eternal Father and thy bre^ren.

THE 4. POINT.
To consider how Christ our Lord entering, the disciples were tro^^ed and
affrighted, imagining that ^ey saw a spirit, and our Lord said them. Why are
you troubled, and ^gitations arise into you hearts; See (...) hands and feet,
that it is I: ^dle and see, for a spirit has not (...) and bones, as you see
me to (...).

Ponder the sweetness of his voice which was sufficient to appease them and rid
them of all fear, and to mak^ them to know him, as who should say: My dearest
disciples, I am the same I was wont to be, in my nature in person, and in
quality: I am you Savior, your Master, your brother and your God, fear not
the fury of the Jews, nor the indignation of the Gentills, nor the cruelty of
Kings and Princes who have risen against me nor those who oppose themselves an^
persecute you, for I being in your c^^^pany you are secure and in safeguard.

Gather hence security and conf^^dence for thy soul, timorous and fea^ full
through the manifold sins the have committed, saying to her: O m^ soul fear
not, for although thy (...) be many, this Lord promises and sureth thee of the
pardon of them This Lamb is he that takes avv^ the sins of the world, and
he (...) will take away thine: and if he be protector of thy life, of who
should thou be afraid*

^HE VII. MEDITATION.
^f Christ his apparition to the Apostles, Saint Thomas being present.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how our Lord, the disciples being, gathered together, entered and
said to his ^isciple who had not believed the Mi^^^ery of his Resurrection: Put
in thy ^nger hither, and see my hands, and being hither thy hand, and put it
into ^y side, and be not incredulous, but ^ithfull.

Ponder the infinite charity o^ ^od in being solicitous for the vvell^re of his
sheep, for having expected (...) days to see if Thomas would call himself
and acknowledge the ^rdnes of his ^art, he would not ^ferre the remedy any
longer, but me in person to cure this his (...) and lost sheep, and taking him
by ^hand, desired to put and place him his heart.

G^ther hence how great the mercy of God is, granting thee (...) infallible
promise and assurance, (...) he will not conceal himself from thee if thou
seek him, yea albeit the have been as incredulous as S. Th^^ mas: and
confessing him for thy (...) and thy God as he did, he will grau^^ thee that
which he afforded him, th^^ is, his body, not only to touch hi^ but also to
receive and enjoy him thy breast.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how that our Lord who permitted not himself to (...) touched by
Mary Magdalen, loui^^^ him so deerly, and seeking him earnestly, takes Thomas
(as we (...) being incredulous, by the cold (...) fro^en hand, makes it warm
(...) cherishes it, and puts it into bosom, heaping upon him so ma^^
benefits.

Ponder how, that whatsoe^^^ S. Thomas desired and asked, (...) Lord granted
him, as if by his li^uing, some profit were to ensu^^^ Christ, whom love made
to (...) for gaynes, as his own, yea (...) procure them even with his loss.

Gather hence an exceeding de^^re to bear with the defects of thy brother, and
not to be slack nor wea^yed with seeking his redress, but even leaving thy
own right, to go unto him if he will not come to thee, and with breach of
thine own will ^o co^descend unto his, perfectly imi^ating Jesus Christ our
Lord, who al^eyt he was triumphant and glorious ^et did he not omit to come,
and do ^aint Thomas so great and special ^auours and privileges. And as he
^id with him, so does he also daily ^ith thee when thou come to re^eaue him
corporally and spiritually* ^arne to be grateful and serviceable ^erfore.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider S. Thomas his worthy (...) confession, for as soon as he tou^^ed
(as piously we may believe) ^e precious wounds of his Savior had his eyes
enlightened with that ^^uine Sun, he became so illumi^^^ed with the rays and
beams of his ^^uine light and splendor, that he confessed plainly and clearly
the articl^ of his resurrection, which he had no^ believed before.

Ponder the love which Chris^^ our Lord has to sinners, and which himself
shevved to have to this hi^ incredulous and sinful Apostle^^ s^th the sin
of his small says, wa^ not enough to make him leave to b^^stow such favors
and benefits upon him, as being imp^ssible and gloriou^ to vouchsafe him his
divine hands (...) feet, bowels and heart, to touch an^ handle.

Ponder secondly how the Ap^^stle seeing himself so honored an^ favored of
our Lord, brake out i^ to these tender and deuo^t word saying: My Lord, and my
God. (...) with good reason he called him hi^ and not our Lord, because he lou^
him so tenderly, that for his good love ^e appeared to all the Apostle^ and
forgetting as it were all the (...) upon him alone bestovved the (...) and
benefit, to inflame him in his ^^uine love.

From hence thou may (...) desires to confess with S. Thomas that Jesus is
thy Lord and thy God: for his love is so exceeding great, that ^he is ready to
do for thee alone, that which he did for Saint Thomas, since that, as well for
thee, as for him, he delivered himself up to death, to purchase for thee
eternal life.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider the worder which our Lord said to his Disciples: Because ^hou have
seen me Thomas* thou ha^^ believed. Blessed are they that have not seen and
have believed.

Ponder, that albeit our Lord ^pproued the confession of S. ^ho^as, yet would he
not call him Bless^^ ^he did S Peter when he confessed ^im for the Son of
God, and the ^eason was, because he had been flow (...) believing: wherefore
inste^d of ^raysing him, he repre^ended him, ^^ying: Because thou have seen
me, Thomas, thou have believed; as who ^ould say: Thanks be to thy hands (...)
eyes which I have given thee to ^elieue, that I am thy Lord, and thy ^od.

Endeavor to gather hence an^ earnest desire to see Christ thy Lord if not
corporal, as the disciples saw and enoyed him with their corpora^ eyes, at
least spiritually, since those who believe his Resurrection not having seen
him, Almighty God calls Blessed.

THE VIII. MEDITATION^
Of his apparition to the Apostles upon Ascension day.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how our Sauiou^ appearing to his disciples, tol^ them that the
same day he wa^ to go to his Father, and that if they l^^ued him, they should
verily be glad, (...) regard that it was expedient for the^ that he went to
heaven.

Ponder how desirous the disc^^ples were, not to loose the corp or^^ presence
of their Master, seeing it (...) necessary with these and other lik^ speeches
to advertise them, that was not only expedient for his (...) to ascend to
heaven, but also that it imported them much, thereby to make mere perfect their
faith, to raise their hope, and to purify their charity. For if I go not to my
Father (our Lord said unto the^) the Holy Ghost shall not come to you.

Gather hence, that if to love the corporal presence of their Lord and
Master, with a love somewhat less pure, and in part interessed, would have
hindered the coming of the Holy Ghost to the discipls, how much more will it
hinder thee to love thy self or any other creature with an inordinate love.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider that our Lord said unto his discipls to comfort them: Rejoice my
beloved disciples at my departure, because I go to prepare you a place.

Ponder how that thy Redee^^er directs lik wise the same speech ^o thee, as
to his Apostles: Rejoice, because I go to heaven, that now from this day
forward thou may ^aue entrance therein; rejoice for that I ascend and go
before, to open for thee those celestial (...), by which thou (albeit a
wretched and sinful creature) may have frank and free entrance, which
before I ascended was not granted to the just and holy. Rejoice because I
ascend to day (...) that thou may ascend to morrow (...) and be seated by me
in the place assigned thee by my Father.

Hence thou may rece^ue^ marvelous great joy and content for that thy Lord
and thy God ascendeth^ into heaven: because for him principally it was
created, Crave of him his divine grace, that by meane^^ of a good and virtuous
life, thou mais^ deserve to see, and enjoy him in his glory.

THE ^. POINT.
TO consider how our Lord having comforted his disciples, said unto them:
Tarry in the City, til^ you be endued with power from above.

Ponder that word, Tarry, that is they should abide, rest, and stay whereby he
meant to signify, tha^ they were to expect him with patience and perseverance,
with repose of body and mind. Secondly God commanded them to keep in the
City, to give them to understand that this favor was not done to them alone,
but was also ordained for the good of the universal world.

Gather hence desires to expect the coming of this divine spirit with repose
and quietness, because God desires that his, though they live in the midst of
the streets, and noise of the world, may have their mind quiet and peaceable,
that they may pray and attend to him with such spirit and recollection as his
divine majesty requires, and to thee shall be necessary.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider how Christ our Lord, commanded his disciples forth^ith to betake
themselves to mount (...), because from thence he was ^ascend to heaven.

Ponder how these holy disci^les would call to mind, that the (...) which
their Lord and Master had chosen to suffer injuries and reproathes on the
Cross, he now chose to mount thence up to Heaven, there to enjoy the
immeasurable greatness of his glory: and that the way to ascend to heaven is the
mount Oliuet, or of olives, which signifies charity and mercy.

Gather hence desires to be charitable and merciful toward thy neighbors,
and to extol and magnify the wisdom and providence of God, who is able to
make that, which is the beginning of thy humiliation and contempt, to be the
origin and cause o^ thy exaltation and praise, as may b^ seen in Joseph, whose
calamity, i^^ ^amy and imprisonment, God used as means to make him sovereign
Lord and King of Aegipt.

THE IX. MEDITATION.
Of the ascension of Christ our Lord.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider, that forty days being past after the resurrection of Christ our
Lord, in which he had treated and conuersed with his, the hour of his glorious
as^ension being come, having all his disciples present: he took his leave of
them with manifold signs and demonstrations of love, and as a most loving
Father who departs, lifting up his hands, he blessed them, and so departed
from them.

Ponder how great the grief and feeling of these most loving children would be
for the departure of their Father, when they should see that Lord to leave
them, for whom they had left all things. It is to be believed that then some
would cast themselves at his feet, others would kiss his most sacred hands,
others would ^ang upon his neck, and all would say: How O Lord, do ^hou go
and leave us thus alone, and orphans in the midst of so many enemies? What
shall children do without their Father, disciples without their Master, sheep
without a Shepherd, and feeble and vveake soldiers without their Captain?
But our Lord comforted them, promising them the favor and aid of the Holy
Ghost, and his perpetual assistance and providence, which never should fail
them.

Gather hence desires, that this Lord, before he depart to heaven, vouchsafe to
give thee his benediction, and taking hold spiritually of his hands, casting
thy self at his feet, and hanging on his neck, thou shall, (...) an other
Jacob, say unto him: I will not let thee go, o Lord, unless thou^ bless me:
for thereon my whole remedy and everlasting bliss depends.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how that glorious bo^dy of Christ our Lord, having im^parted his
benediction to his, in their presence ascended to heaven, the disciples
remaining in suspense and astonished to behold their Elias mount up to heaven:
and whereas they could not follow their Lord with their bodies, they followed
him with their eyes and hearts.

Ponder the great admiration of the Angels, and men which were there
assembled, seeing that sacred humanity of Christ our Lord to mount above all
celestial spirits, toward that City, and to be seated at the right hand of
the Father, who had been so much debased and humbled: wherefore replenished
with excessive joy and comfor they would say to each other: Ascend o Lord,
ascend, not to mount Caluary to be crucified between two thieves on a tree,
but unto the holy hill of Sion i^ the heavenly Jerusalem, to be glorified
between two divine persons, by the quyers of Angels and blessed souls that
inuisibly accompany thee: Ascend O Lord, ascend to this soue^aigne Court, not
to suffer and dye, ^ut to triumph over death it self and sin etc.

From hence thou may gather how well afflictions endured for the love of God,
are employed, seeing he can and will reward and recompense them so largely,
magnifying and exalting above all creatures him, who humbled himself and
suffered more then all. Beseech him that since he says by Saint John: If I be
exalted from the earth, I will draw all things to my self, it may be fulfilled
in thee, that thy mind and affection being separated from earthly vanities,
thou may ascend with him and his holy company to heaven.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider how the holy Apostl^ after they had lost the sight o^ their God
and Lord, they vven^ back to Jerusalem with great joy because the same love
that caused them so much to lament their loss enforced them on the other side
to rejoice at his glorious triumph and entrance into that celestial country
where he should be received of thos^ courtiers of heaven with singular io^
exultation and triumph, some singing others playing on their admirable and
melodious instruments.

Ponder how different this Thursday in mount Oliuet was from that Friday in
mount Caluary; there solitary, here so well attended; there nailed on a
Cross, here exalted above the clouds; there cucified between two thieves,
here environed with quiers of Angels, there blasphemed and scorned, here
honored and renowned; finally there suffeing and dying, here reioyeing and
tryumphing.

Gather hence great comfort to see this so wonderful a mutation and change,
and rejoice in this day of Christ's Ascension into heaven to be thy advocate,
and fear his Coming to be thy Judge.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider the joy of Christ our Lord in this triumph, of whom it is said:
God is ascended in iubilation, seeing the happy end of his travels.

Ponder how much the Eternal Father exalted him above all, who humbled
himself more then all, giving him for the throne of the Cross a throne of
Majesty, for the crown of thorns, a crown of glory, for the company of
thieves, companies of Angels, for the ignominies and blasphemies of men,
honors and praises of celestial spirits. And because he descended first into
the inferior parts of the earth, he made him ascend above all the heavens. In
conclusion, that nature whereto it was said: Dust thou art, and into dust thou
shall return, now is raised from the dust of the earth above all the heavens.

Gather hence how requisite it is to humble thy self for Christ, so to be
exal^ed with Christ, because if thou will not be like unto him in debafing and
humbling thy self, in vain hopest thou to follovv him in ascending and
reigning.

After the Meditation of the Ascension of Christ our Lord to heaven it were
much to the purpose to set down the meditation of his glory, but in regard we
have treated thereof in the first Book, together with the last things of man,
we remit him who desires to read and medicate thereon to that place.

THE X. MEDITATION.
Of the coming of the Holy Ghost.

THE ^. POINT.
TO consider how after our S^uiour was ascended into heaven his disciples
retired themselves into an upper chamber in Jerusalem, where they all
perseuered in continual prayer expecting the Holy Ghost.

Ponder that the strongest and most effectual means that may be to procure
the coming of the Holy Ghost into thy soul, is a continual, inflamed and
fervent perseverance in ^rayer: for otherwise, if when others pray thou
sleep, if when others a^^end and are careful of their saluati^n and
spiritual profit, thou remay^^ careless and negligent of thy own, if when
others have their minds and conversation with God, thou have thine with men,
although thou be in company of the good and holy, in one house and residence,
in one same Religion, this divine spirit will not come upon thee.

Gather hence desires to per^euere in prayer, and to be frequent therein, that
this divine fire of the holy Ghost may come also upon thee as it came upon the
Apostles, who with so many sighs and longing desires expected its coming.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how there came suddenly a wind that filled the whole house where
the Apostles were in prayer.

Ponder first, how this vvind and cool air of heaven, did no^ leave any
chamber, room, closet o^ corner of that house which it did no^ penetrate, to
signif^ that this quiknin^ spirit is offered and given to all me^ generally in
whatsoever part or co^^ner of the world they are.

Ponder secondly, that when the Holy Ghost enters into a soul, it fills all
her faculties by his power, with verities and celestial v^rtues, not leaving
any part void or unfurnished*

From hence thou shall gather, that if thou desire this sovereign spirit
should replenish the house of thy soul with his divine graces and gifts, thou
must not wander out of it, distracting and busiyng thy thoghts about creatures,
but remain settled and quietly reposed therein, employing her in good desires,
thoughts and works: for doing so, this divine spirit will fill thee with his
aboundan^ love and grace.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how the Holy Ghost descended in form of fiery tongues upon all
the Apostles and disciples, that were retired in that house, verifying that
which Christ our Lord said unto them: I came to cast fire on earth, and what
will I, but that it be kindled, and inflame the hearts of men.

Ponder that the cause, why this Lord comes in form of (...), was that the
Apostles might be like unto burning torches, which should set on fire the
whole world, and that they might illuminate and inflame the hearts of men with
this fire of divine (...)* making them of wolves, to become sheep* of crows,
doves; of lions, lambs; and of brutish people and infernal monsters,
spiritual Angella.

Gather hence great desires that this fire would vouchsafe unto thee one spark
of his ^eat, that thy lips being purified, as were those of the Prophet, thou
may hence forward neither speak, nor discourse of vain^ and base things of
the world, but o^ God and his praises, endeavoring with thy speuches and
con^ersation to inflame thy self and those with whom thou conuersest, with
the fire of thy divine love.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider that albeit the disciple^ which were in that chamber, were more
then an hundred, and all of (...) different merits, yet that pure spirit
replenished all with his divine gifts and graces imparted himself entierly to
every one.

Ponder that although all were full of the Holy Ghost, yet some re^^aued
greater grace and benefit then others, that is, the more holy received greater
plenty of grace. And so the most B. Virgin as fullest of grace and virtue,
received more abundance thereof then all the rest together.

Gather hence a great desire to dispose and prepare thy self to receive this
divine spirit, with the grea^^st fervor thou can, because he communicates
himself more abundantly to him that is best prepared: and to make thy self
such, the principal virtue which thou must procure to have, is Humility, which
conserueth the rest, as the Prophet Isay says: Upon whom reposeth my spirit,
says our Lord, but upon him that is humble and meek? Be thou then such a^
one, that with like dispos^tion thou may receive and preserve in thy soul
this divine spirit, who resists the pro^d, and to the humble gives his grace.

THE XI. MEDITATION.
Of the death of the most Blessed Virgin our Lady.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how the B. Virgin our Lady being now in years, and God having
determined her some time in this life (which some believe were fifteen, others
(more probably) say, that she lived twenty three years after the death of
Christ and that she departed this life to heaven the 7^. year of her age)
Almighty God having preserved her here all this time to give light to the
world, and for the comfort and benefit of the whole Church, and also that she
might see the faith and name of her Blessed Son diuulged and spread over all
parts of the world, she had now most earnest and inflamed desires to go to
heaven, where she was to find out Lord Jesus Christ her Son victorious and
triumphant, whom she instantly besought to take her out o^ this exile,
banishment, and tempestuous sea, and conduct her to that secure port of
happiness, where for ever she might enjoy his glorio^s sight and conpany.

Ponder, how this most Blessed Son approving the pious desires of his dearest
Mother, and acknowledging the aspirations of her heart to be greater then those
of David where he said: Even as the Heart desires after the fountains of
waters, so does my soul desire after thee o God; he sent unto her an Angel
(which many ho^ly Fathers imagine, was the Angel S. Gabriel) who came with a
palm in his hand in token of the victory that this triumphant Lady had gotten
of sin, of the Devil, and of death it self, And the B. Virgin received him
with great comfort and joy of spirit, confi^ering what she so much desired was
^ow to effected.

Gather hence enkindled desires to see and enjoy God, that when thy days shall
end and death arrive, ^hou may receive it with gust and ^oy, hoping by means
thereof to participate in heaven, of the svveet presence and company of Christ
our Lord, and of his most Blessed Mother.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how* the Son of God determining to fulfill the desires of his
most B. Mother, the Apostles being divided over the whole world preaching the
victories of their Lord, were miraculously assembled in the house of the B.
Virgin, who reioyci^g much at their coming, disclosed unto them the news of
her death, with a cheerful and grave countenance declaring unto them her
desire to depart this life, and to go to heaven, which Almighty God had
gra^nted unto her.

Ponder the feeling, tears, and tenderness of heart wherewith this dole^uli
relation afflicted them all, seeing their Mother ready to depart thi^ life, and
that divine Sun illuminating the Chruch, to withdraw it self and go down.

Ponder s^condly how the Ble^^sed Virgin without any infirmity o^ pain at all
(but of mere love and desire to see and enjoy her Son in heaven) betook her
self to her poor bed, and beholding them all with a countenance rather
divine, then humane, willed them to come near, and gave them her blessing,
saying: God be with you my deerly beloved children, lament not because I leave
you, but rejoice because I go to my best beloved Son.

Gather hence an exceeding desire to approach in spirit near unto this B.
Lady, and joining thy self to his good company, beseech her to give thee her
holy blessing also, that ^herwith thou may increase and go ^orward in grace
and love of her God, and thy Lord.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider how Christ our Lord, this happy hour being at hand, (...) down
from heaven accompa^^ed with innumerable Angels, by ^^eir sight and presence
to rejoice his ^ost B. Mother, and to conduct her i^ heaven.

Ponder first the gracious and sweet words which the Son of God used unto
his sacred Mother the Blessed Virgin Mary, which might be the same that the
holy Ghost speaks to his Espouse in the Canticles (...) Arise, make have my
love, my dove, my beautiful, and come: for winte^ is now past, the rain is
gone and departed: The flowers have appeared i^ our Land: Come from libanus m^
Espouse, come from Libanus: com^ thou shall de crowned, with the crown of
Justice, which thou have s^ well deserved.

Ponder secondly what, and ho^ great the iubilies and comforts vve^^ that did
trauerse the heart of this (...) Lady; what thanks she gave her So^ and her God,
for such benefits b^ stowed upon her, and for vouch s^^fing to cloth himself
with her fle^^ and blood in her virginal womb^ and calling to mind the manner
of (...) death on the Cross would say: O (...) Father as thou art God, and my
(...) as man, into thy hands o Lord I co^ mend my spirit. And with the words
she yielded her spirit to hi^ whom she had invested within her self.

From hence thou shall gather ^ffections to praise God our Lord, in whose sight
the death of this Lady was precious, giving her so copious and large a
recompense for her labors. Trust in like sort to receive reward for that thou
have endured for his service and glory, that so thy death may be precious in
his sight, as is that of his Saints.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider how the holy Apostles and disciples of our Lord, when they beheld
that body without life, of which our life had taken flesh, they ^ll prostrated
themselves upon the ground, kissing it with great tender^es, devotion and
affection: then lay^ng it forth with upon a Beer, they ^ooke it on their
shoulders, and car^yed it through the City of Hierusa^em, singing Hymns and
devout ^rayers, till they arrived at the sepul^her where it was to be placed.

Ponder how their grief at such ^me as the holy body was put into the
Monument, was renewed, and that they devoutly kissed, and with great reverence
adored it again and again, not being able to withdraw their eyes from thence
where they had their hearts.

Hence stir up in thy self a tender feeling and sorrow for the absence of this
B. Lady, and an earnest desire spiritually with thy best endeavor to accompany
her holy body, conforging thy self with the quiers of Angels and the
disciples, to sing with them her praises: beseeching her to obtain^ thee such a
death, as thou may in^ her company enjoy for ever the presence and glory of
her most holy Sonn^ in heaven.

THE XII. MEDITATION.
Of the assumption and coronation of our Blessed Lady.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how the third day after the death of our Blessed Lady, Christ
Jesus her Son, cam^ down from heaven, attended on by innumerable Angels,
with the soul of his most B. Mother, and infused it into her body, and made it
a thousand times more beautiful then the Sun it self, and restoring it to
life, invested it with immortality, and with a beauty and grace so divine, as
neither can be explicated by words, nor comprehended by humane understanding.

Ponder how glorious the body of this pure Virgin was, raised out of the
Sepulcher, with those four dowries of glory, which the glorified bodies have,
of impassibility, agility, subtility, and clarity. And beholding her self in
this manner, what thanks would she render unto her most B. Son, for having
dealt so liberally with her, not permitting her body (albeit she dyed a
natural death, as other children of Adam) to be dissolved and turned to dust,
conseruing it with the same integrity and purity, it had in life.

Gather hence great joy at the Resurrection of the Blessed Virgin, and the
incorruptibility of her body, the rare and special privilege granted unto
her by her most holy Son, who fullfilled the desires of her soul. Beseech him
to fulfill thine, which are to serve him with purity of body and soul in this
life, that thou may se^ and enjoy him in the eternal.

THE 2. POINT
TO consider, how our Lord God having raised the body of the most B Virgin, the
divine Sun and beautiful Moon, would behold ech^ other, not now mourning
and eclipsed as upon good Friday, but mos^ joyful, resplendent and beautifull^
And those two blessed hearts of such (...) Mother and such a Son, exul^ing^
with joy, would give to each other sweet imbracings, and a thousand welcomes
and congratulations.

Ponder the most solemn procession, which forthwith was made (...) the
sepulcher, even to the highest heaven, and how that glorious body of the
Blessed Virgin did mount and ascend on high, carried with the wings of the
gifts of agility, not standing in need of the Angels to assist or support
her. Although they did all accompany her, some singing* others playing most
sweely on their harps and violls, and rejoicing and wondering at so great a
nouelty, and glorious triumph, said: Who is this that comes up from the
desert of this life with so great glory, flowing with delights, leaning upon
her beloved?

Gather hence three things: Let the first be a most earnest desire, in spirit
to follow the Blessed Virgin in this journey, abandoning the world with thy
heart, together with all the sensual delights thereof. The second to endeavor
to ascend every day and to profit in virtue, not trusting to thy weak forces,
not in thy arm of flesh but in the potent arm of God. Let the third be to
rejoice ever in our Lord, and in whatsoever appertains to his service.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider the place and seat which the Son of God assigned to his beloved
Mother in heaven. This was no doubt the best and most eminent (the sacred
Humanity of Christ excepted) which was, or ever shall be given to a pure
creature: for she was placed and seated above all the nine quiers of Angels,
at the right hand of God, within his own curtain and throne, according to
that of the Prophet, who says: The Queen stood on thy right hand in golden
^ayment, compassed with variety and beauty: for it was most meet that she who
stood and was present on his right ^e had suffering on earth at the foot of the
Cross, should posses the like place, rejoicing in heaven: and that she who
humbled her self below all creaturs, should be exalted above them all, to be
their Mistress, and the Queen of Angels.

Ponder how bright the Emperial heaven was with the glittering and resplendent
light of such a Sun and such a Moon, Christ and his Mother; how joyful and
contented were the Angels with the sight and presence of such a Queen, by
whose intercession they hoped the seats which their companions had lost,
would be repaired; what great joy did the Blessed conceive at the majesty and
glory of such a Mother, unto whom all did reverence, homage and obedience,
seeing her so far exalted above them all. O how well satisfied and content was
that humble Lady, seeing her self raised from the very lowest place of the
earth, to the supreme and highest heaven.

Wherefore gathering hence affections of joy for that this Princess of heaven
is so extolled above al pure creatures, thou shall congratulate and contemplate
with her, for that God has so much honored and exalted ^her. Hope thou for
the same in heaven if thou shall follow the steps of such a Son, and such a
Mother.

THE 4. POINT.
TO consider how the most holy Trinity presently crowned the B. Virgin with
three crowns. The Eternal Father crowned her with a crown of Power, giving
her, after Christ, power and dominion over all creatures in heaven and earth.
The Son crowned her with a crown of Wisdom, enduing her with the clear
knowledge of the divine (...) and of all creatures in it. The Holy Ghost crowned
her with a crown of Charity, infusing into her, not only the love of God, but
also of her neighbors.

Ponder the admiration and astonishment of those Angelical Hierarchies, when
they beheld the B. Virgin so much esteemed and honored with such crowns,
graces and prerogatives, and above all, consider what unspeakable joy this
sovereign Queen conceived, with what affection and devotion she would renew
her Canticle of Magnificat, seeing how great things, he who is Almighty, had
wrought in her.

Gather from hence lively and inflamed desires to see and enjoy this B* Lady,
who is the daughter of the Eternal Father, Mother of the Eternal So^, and
espouse of the Holy Ghost. For she is crowned with the diadem^ of glory,
wherewith the true King Solomon crowned her in the day of her entrance into
heaven, and in the day of the joy of her heart. Beseech her, that seeing she is
also thy Mother, she would also vouchsafe plenty of her mercies and virtues,
that thou may obtain and enjoy the eternal crown of glory, which God
grant us. Amen.

The end of the Meditations of the life and death of our Savior, and his
Blessed Mother.
HERE FOLLOW TWO MEDITATIONS Serving for preparation before the sacred
Communion.
AN ADVERTISMENT.
I Have thought it good to end this Book of Meditations with a few of the most
Blessed Sacrament, to meditate upon, not only the whole Octaue of Corpus
Christi, and other feasts of the year (in regard this most Holy Lord
graciously discovers himself, and is so often carried in public procession)
but also that seeing it is (through the bounty of God) received so frequently,
not of Religious persons alone, but of secular also, they may have sufficient
matte^^ ^o prepare themselves before the sacred Communion, and to give due
thanks unto our Lord after they have received it. For the excellency and
soueraingty of this divine Sacrament (in which is contained God himself)
requires, that the disposition and preparation thereto, be made with all care
possible. And therefore one of the best preparations wherewith all may come to
receive abundant grace, willbe retiring themselves, first to consider well
some one point of the six, which are set down in the two ensuing meditations,
which are of the Fear and Love of God, because these two virtues unite the
soul with God, and are the two arms wherewith she is to embrace her spouse,
and which do instruct and teach her what God is, and what she is. For Fear
causes in the soul humility and reverence: Love, confidence and devotion.
Fear discovers the greatness of God, and thy baseness: Love, his goodness and
clemency: Fear his justice and our sins: Love, the mercy and confidence we
ought to have of the pardon of them: If therefore love and fear work so great
good in the soul, thou must endeavor by all means that these said
considerations may engender and produce in thine these two pearls. But because
our corrupt Nature so much affects variety, that though the consideration be
most exc^llent, yet is it presently most weary of it: I will put in these two
Meditations six points (as I have said) which may serve for preparations to six
Co^munions: for new meat sharpneth and stirs up the appetite of man, and
exciteth in him a new hunger and desire to unite himself with God: for all
these sauces and seasonings of considerations are necessary to make him eat the
bread of Angels, who has set his affection on the delights and food of beasts.
After these shall follow six Meditations, which contain eighteen points or
considerations, wherein the servant of God may find sufficient matter for so
many co^munions, to render due thanks after he has received: out of which he
may reap the fruit and profit he desires.

THE I. MEDITATION.
Of Fear.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider the immensity and majesty of that Lord which really and truly is
contained in the most B. Sacrament, for he is the very same who with his only
will has created, conserueth and governs heaven and earth, and with it alone
can anihilate and destroy it all.

Ponder the admiration and astonishment, which it caused to King Solomon to see
that the greatness of God came to live in that holy Temple which he had built
for him, being notwithstanding the most solemn, the most sumptuous, and most
magnificent that was in the world. With how much more reason ought thou to
marvel, fear, and tremble, being but a poor Emment, and silly worm, to go
to receive into thy house of base clay, that immense and divine majesty,
Creator, conseruer and gouerner of the world (whom the Apostle S. Saul
calls the brightness of the glory of God) being so ill prepared as thou art,
thy breast also having been, not the Temple of the Holy Ghost (as in reason it
ought to be) but rather a den of dragons, and receptacle of serpents and
basiliskes.

Gather hence a great fear of the justice of God, with a detestation of thy
manifold sins: for thou being so vile a creature, and unworthy to have in thee
so great a good, thou fear not to enclose, retain and harbor in thy strait
and narrovv breast this omnipotent Lord and God whom the heavens cannot
comprehend.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider who thou art, and who he is whom thou go to receive, and thou
shall find that an abominable sinner goes to receive his Sanctifier; a vile
creature, his Ceatour; a wretched slave, his Lord; finally a miserable ca^iffe
the supreme and omnipotent God, at whose beauty the Sun and Moon do
marvel, whose majesty heaven and earth do reverence, by whose bounty the
society of all the Blessed is maintained.

Ponder how, being so vile and base as thou art, thou art notvvithstanding
admitted to receive a God so high: how being so little, can thou entertayne
so sovereign a majesty? The Creator of the heavens, the King of Angels and
men? before whose greatness the strongest pillars of heaven do tremble, and the
most high Seraphims shrink in their wings for very fear and reverence: and if
all things created, be in the sight of this great God as if they were not,
what I pray thee, vvilt thou be in his divine presence to receive him? The
Church sings and much admireth, that this great Lord (unto whom heaven and
earth is a strait place) disdained not to enter into the womb of a Virgin.
Measure her purity, with thy impurity; her grace, with thy deformity; her
innocence, with thy malice, and thou shall find far greater reason to wonder at
thy boldness in harboring the Son of God, and of the most B. Virgin, whom
she conceived, and conserved in her breast with so great humility.

Gather hence great fear least this sovereign King and Lord command his
servants to bind thee hand and foot (for that thou come not with the garment
of due innocence, and purity to this holy table and celestial banquet) and
cast thee into the utter darkness of hell, there to receive thy deserved
punishment.

THE ^. POINT.
TO consider the great justice of our Lord, and how much he abhors sin,
and those which full often thou have committed against his divine Majesty, for
which thou deseruedst many years ago to have been burning in hell fire: and as
if thou were very just and holy, with so little fear thou presumest to
entertayne into thy house the terrible Judge and searcher of thy life and
manners, not remembering the menaces and threats of the Apostle against sinners
who unworthily, as thou, dare eat and drink the sacred body, and blood of our
Lord.

Ponder, that if S. John Baptist so pure a creature and sanctified in his
Mothers womb said, that he was not worthy to loose the lachet of the shoe of
our Lord, how shall thou be worthy to rece^^e him? In like manner i^ S Peter,
Prince of the Apostles and he^d of the Church, being astonished at the power
and Majesty of Christ, ^el down at his knees saying: Go forth from me, because
I am a sinful man: how dare thou come to put thy mouth to his divine side,
and sustain thy self with that precious wine that springs Virgins.

From hence thou may gather a great fear and reverence before thou come
and presumest to receive the majesty of this sovereign God, and an humble
acknowledgement of thy baseness, and a deep sorrow for thy sins, perfectly
imitating that sinner the Publican, to obtain pardon thereof, who knocking his
breast, said: God be merciful to me a sinner.

THE II. MEDITATION.
Of Love.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider that as great as God is in Majesty, in justice, and in detestation
of sin (as has been said in the precedent Meditation) so great he is in
goodness, in mercy, and in love toward sinners, which causes him to present
himself in human flesh in the most B. Sacrament, and is the cause why he
permits himself to be once, and many times sold, scorned, crucified, and
nailed between thieves: for such are they who receive him unworthily.

Ponder how far the goodness of God reached, and how much the beams of his
divine and inflamed love extended it self: since it made that generous and
magnificent Lion, who with his roaring terrified the world, to put on such
meeknes, that he has couched himself upon the Altar, and is become a meek
Lamb, that thou migh^st eat him. And this same Lord being he who commanded
that no sinner should dare to approach unto him under pain of malediction, his
love has now so disposed, and so changed him, and he is become so desirous
that al men approach unto him, and to give himself entierly to all, that he
does not only call and inuit them, but also eats with them: yea and his
love does proceed so far, as that he does not only eat with them, but
commands them also to eat him, giving them his sacred body and blood to eat.

From hence thou may gather fervent desires to love him, who has loved thee
so much; to have confidence in him, who has been so liberal with thee, to
have access unto him, who is so good and so communicatiue of himself, saying
with the holy Prophet: What shall I render to our Lord for so many favors and
benefits which he has rendered to me, and especially for this I am to receive
now: but now I know that it is my heart which he desires, and this will I
intierly offer up unto him, as his divine Majesty wills and commands me.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how that Father of mercy who vouchsafed to be chastized in his
own flesh for thy love, and ^o shed his most precious blood and dye upon a
Cross for thee, this very same is there glorious, and him thou go to
receive. The same that dyed for thee, is there alive to give thee life, making
himself (as he himself said) thy meat, that by virtue of this ^acred food,
thou may come to transform thy self spiritually into God, to put in his
livery.

Ponder the great desire this our Lord has of thy weal and remedy, ^ith he
stood not upon his own cost and charges, nor regarded the loss of his honor,
life and living, so that he might feed and cherish thee with this divine food
- Giving it unto thee not only to see, adore, and kiss, as to the theepheardes
and Kings, but that thou may receive him also, and have him in thy breast,
as his holy and chaste Espouse had.

Gather from hence desires to consecrate thy self wholly unto this Lord,
endeavoring to be like unto him in life and manners, seeing he said, Be holy
because I am holy: and to thee in particular he says: Learn of me, (that is)
to be humble as Christ, chaste and pure as Christ, patient and obedient as
Christ, and by this means thou shall go clad with his garmen^ and livery.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider that God loved sinners so much, as that he was not only content to
take flesh in likeness of a sinner, but vouchsafed also, thereby to communicate
unto thee his riches and treasures, to remain in this most Blessed Sacrament
under that sacred veil, and in that humble cur^ayne of that sacred host, and
this not for a small time, but even to the consummation of the world.

Ponder how the love that brought him into the world, and m^ him put himself
into the hands o^ sinners, this very same is that which makes him to come the
second and infinite times into the world, and to show himself so inamoured as
it were and so much in love with them, that he said, that all this delights,
^oyes and affections are to be, and converse with sinners. And yet he far more
affectionatly declares and specifieth his love, saying that, He who touches
them, touches the apple of his eye, and veins of his ^art.

From hence thou may gather desires to have access unto him, and to set thy
love and affection entierly upon this Lord. And although thy grievous sins on
the one side detayne and terrify thee, not withstanding let his great love and
clemency on the other side prevail and move thee ^imitating the prodigal
Son, who albeit he saw his own baseness and misery, yet the goodness and love
of his Father encouraged him to go unto him, and to cast himself at his feet,
do thou also as he did: and seeing thou have imitated him that sinned, imitate
him that repented, and thy heavenly Father will run out to receive thee, and
as to a beloved child will fall upon thy neck, in token of his singular love
unto thee.

HERE FOLLOW SIX MEDITATIONS Of the most Blessed Sacrament, to give thanks
unto our Lord ofter Communion, and to meditate upon the Feasts and Octaues
thereof.
AN ADVERTISMENT.
THERE is wont to be much negligence and distraction in some after they have
received the ^ost Blessed Sacrament, and they reap shall fruit and profit
thereby, be^se they are not prepared with ^e pious consideration, to render
due thanks unto our Lord, or because they always meditate one and the self
same thing. Wherefore to remedy this negligence, and to repair this damage, it
will be good that he who is Priest be prepared before Mass, and others before
Communion, with one or more points of the six ensuing Meditations, that variety
may take a way wearisomnes which deprineth both of gust and profit. And hereby
they may dr^sse this divine meat in sundry manners, since it has no less
properties in it, then had that celestial Manna, which gau^ such taste as
euere appetite desired. S^ this divine Manna is of such virtue and substance,
that every one man apply it as he likes best, and it wi^ savor unto him of
whatsoever h^ ^art shall desire: for whatsoever is i^ (...), is profitable to
be eaten, and ple^ sing to the taste, as the divine Espou^ does note, and Saint
Ambrose and oth^ holy Fathers say: Christ is all thin^ unto us: If thou be
sick of an agu^ he is a Phi^^^ian: if thou fear dear^ he is (...); if thou
fly darkness, h^ light; if thou seek sustenance, he is food; if thou be cold,
he is fire; if thou have want, he is rich. Let the conclusion be (^aith this
holy Doctor) that we prove and taste of this sovereign food, because our Lord,
who is in it, is most sweet and pleasing to the palate of the soul. If
therefore whatsoever may be, and thou can desire, thou find and have in
Christ, co^side^ him every time thou communicatest, according to these or the
like attributes, that thou may reap the fruit thou desire, and know how to
render due thanks unto our Lord, because that time is more fit for mental
prayer then to read vocal prayers, or to say beads. Wherefore before thou enter
into the Meditation or consideration of any of the e^suyng points, to
illuminate thine understanding and stir up devotion, thou may first, euerv
time thou communicatest, make briefly this composition of place, with the
petitions adjoining.

The composition of place.
MAKE account that thou art in the presence of Christ Jesus our Lord true God
and Man, seeing with the eyes of consideration how he is really and truly
enclosed In thy breast, as in a pix or reliquary, with innumerable Angels
there on their knees adoring him.

The Petition.
BESEECH our Lord God to give thee eyes to see the great good that is entered
into thy house, as he gave to S. Simeon having him in his arms, that thou
may regard and esteem him as the Son of whom he is. And to give thee grace
to bestow that small time profitably and fruitfully, as his divine Majesty
requires.

THE I. MEDITATION.
How Christ our Lord is a Physician.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how that Christ our Lord came from heaven into this world, to be
the Physician of souls, and to cure the sick therein, seeking them out and
offering them health, as he did with that sick bedrid man in the Gospel,
whom our Lord himself sought out at the Piscina, or Pond of Probatica, to
cure him.

Ponder the love and charity of this great Physician, and thy coldness and
negligence, in being thankful for the good he desires to bestow upon thee:
for whereas he would cure all thy infirmities and spiritual diseases, thou like
a foolish and frantike person, vvilt not permit thy self to be cured, but wilt
rather persevere in thy bad estate.

Gather hence to desire to subject thy self to the will and pleasure of such
a Physician, seeing thou art and f^ndst thy self sick in all thy powers and
senses: and in regard he is so excellent an one, that he heals all of
whatsoever infirmities, take him by the hand and guide him to all thy diseased
parts, saying (as if he knew it not) good Lord, come and see this my memory
unmindful of thee, and of the ^auours and benefits thou bestowest upon it,
cure it I beseech thee. Behold Lord these infirm eyes of mine, and lovers to
see that which is not lawful for them to desire, heal and our them. Behold o
Lord, this murmuring, talkatiue and unbridled tongue of mine. Behold O Lord,
this wretched man poor and miserable on every side, and have compassion on
him: for if I could touch thee with ^ayth, thou would heal me, since as many
as touched thee were made whole.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how that the sacred flesh and blood of this most wise Physician
joined to thine is an vniuer^all medicine to all thy euells, which is of such
virtue, that with his humility it cures the swellings of thy pride, with his
sorrows and paths, thy unreasonable pleasures and delights, with his merits,
thy diffidence and mistrusts, and thy soars rancled and putrifyed by the
inueterate and continual custom of sinning, with the sweet and fragrant balm
of his precious blood.

Ponder the mercy and bounty of this benign Physician, which was such and so
great, that not content to be only the Physician (as is manifest by that which
he said to the disciples of Saint John, to wit: The blind see, the lame walk,
the leapers are made clean, the dease hear, the dead rise again etc.) he
made himself also the medicine, and gives himself unto thee to be eaten,
there by perfectly to cure thee of all thy infirmities.

Gather hence an earnest desire to have frequent access unto this heavenly
Physician; and beseach him, that although it be with the cost of thy
affections, honor, life and contentments, to heal and cure theet since thou
preceiuest thy self to be full of infirmities, of sins and inordinate
passions, in regard that there is not any medicine able to cure thee, but only
this sovereign antidots.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider the worth and price of this medicine, since it cost this celestial
Physician so many labors and pains, yea even his life, to leave it thee so
prepared, tempred and seasoned, that thou might take it with gust, savor,
and profit in this divine Sacrament.

Ponder, that the Physicians of this world most commonly command some
chickin, or ^oule to be killed, dressed and given to the sick to ^ate: but
this Physician of heaven was not content to ordain and command alone, but
would also, as his Prophet says, become sick to cure thee, be wounded to
heal thy soars, and dye upon the Cross, that thou might live eternally in
heaven.

From hence thou may gather a lively and seruent desire to come near unto
this heavenly Physician: for he alone can give thee health and life, and
prostrating thy self at his feet say unto him: Have mercy on me o Lord,
because I am vveake. Heal me o Lord, and I shall be healed. For thou know
that from the sole of my foot, unto the top of my head, there is not health in
me. And be assured, that if thou come with desire of health and with the faith
and cofidence wherewith the woman which was troubled with an issue of blood,
came and touched him, thou shall be freed of thine infirmity ^ as she was: for
if the garment of Christ had this virtue, Christ himself can do much more,
whom thou have within thee.

THE II. MEDITATION.
How Christ our Lord is Fire.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider that Christ Jesus our Lord, whom thou have enclosed in thy
breast, is the fire of divine love, whose property and excellency is to consume
the humidities of vices, and to raise the soul to heavenly desires, making her
despise those that are terrestrial.

Ponder that the virtue and quality of this celestial fire is, not only to
inflame the hearts, but to give light also, and open the eyes of him, who
receaueth him worthily, as he did to those two discipls that wet to Emaus, for
sitting at the table, in breaking the bread which he gave them (which as some
Holy Fathers say, was his holy body) their eyes were opened, and they knew
their God and Lord, and inflamed and burning with this divine fire which they
had in their breasts, they returned from Emaus far different and changed from
that they were when they came thither, that is, of doubtful they became
faithful: of timorous, courageous: of ignorant, learned and well instructed.

Gather hence desires to come from the sacred Communion con^erted and
transformed into another man, (I mean) from proud to humble; from incontinent,
to chasts from engry to patient; and from wicked and sinful, to just and
holy: beseeching this Lord, seeing he is a consuming fire, to purify all thy
imperfections, and to open and illuminate thine eyes, that coming often unto
him, thou may know him, and know thy self, for heerin consists thy
eternal felicity.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider that the cause which moved Christ our Lord, to come form heaven to
earth, was the desire he had to cast fire into the hearts of men, and his will
is, that it ever burn.

Ponder the property of this sovereign fire, which is to purify whatsoever
metal is cast into it, converting it into self, whether is be iron or
stone, I mean whatsoever sinner, how wicked soever he has been, though cold
as iron, and hard as a stone: for this sovereign fire (which is God) has such
power and force, that he makes his ministers a burning fire.

Gather from hence desires tha^ this Lord vouchsafe to do the same to thee,
and that, because thou have come unto him and received him into thy breast,
although thou be iron and stone, he will with his divine heat kindle, melt and
inflame thee in his love, that tried and tempred in this oven and divine
furnace, thou may become pure, and without any rust at all, of sins and
imperfections.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider the great desire which the Apostles had of that fire of the Holy
Ghost, and with what cries and sighs, prayers and groanings they craved it of
God. And after he descended upon them, what manner of men became they? how
different, how much changed, and how inflamed in the love of God.

Ponder what may be the cause why, notwithstanding this divine fire has
descended from heaven and enclosed it self so often in thy breast, thou art
not inflamed and set on fire, Solomon saying with admiration: Can a man hide
fire in his bosom, that his garments burn not? Wherefore the cause of this
evil must needs proceed from thy bad disposition and negligent preparation: for
if thou should dispose and prepare thy self, as the Apostles did themselves,
and desire it as they did, it would enlighten and shine unto thee much more
then it does, and thou would be another manner of man then now thou art.

Gather hence desires to beg this benefit and divine fire of God, saying with
his Prophet: Burn my reins o Lord, and my heart, and leave in it some spark
of thy fire, some token and sign that it has been in my soul, fith thou have
vouchsafed to come so often unto her: for where is fire, there ever remains
some heat, and sign there of in the ashes.

THE III. MEDITATION.
That Christ our Lord is Food.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider that Christ our Lord is food of the soul, as he said himself: My
flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.

Ponder first the wonderful providence of this Lord, since he had such
particular care, in regard of thy necessity and weakness, to provide thee this
corporal and spiritual food of bread and wine, that thy spirit might not
^aint in the way, nor perish with famine, as the prodigal Son did.

Ponder secondly, that if the bread which the Prophet Elias did eat had such
virtue, that he walked in the strength of that meat forty days and forty
nights through the desert unto the mount of God: how much better and greater is
the power and strength of this My sticall bread (whereof that was only a
representation) to nourish thee in the desert of this life, till thou arrive at
the holy mount of everlasting bliss, this being the bread that comfort and
confirms the heart of man.

Gather hence a firm purpose and resolution (in regard of the necessity thou
have to nourish thy self and to line) to come often unto this sovereign table
to eat this sacred bread, for in it is contained thy health and life, and
without it (as Christ himself said) thou shall not have life in thee.

THE 2. POINT.
TO co^egrave;sider the great love that God our Lord has unto men, since he as
one inamoured and possessed with their love, would that they should eat him
sacramentally, that he might eat them spiritually.

Ponder the great liberality of this Lord, in inuiting all, though feeble blind
or lame, not rejecting any, be he rich or poor, great or little, compelling
all to come and fit at his table, so that they be not guilty of mortal^ ^inne.

Gather hence a firm purpose from this day forward to come unto this royal
table, seeing God inuiteth thee to eat him: neither let him be enforced to
compel thee, and bring thee in by violence and force: for although thou have
offended him so often and been lame of both feet, that is, of understanding
and will, he will thus much honor thee, that tasting and seeing how sweet our
Lord is, who gives himself unto thee in this meat, thou may loose thy
self and find him, and renounce all things thou do pleasingly possess for
this sovereign food, wherein is contained all the good of heaven and earth.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider the great virtue and power this divine food contains in it,
which is such, that eaten it changes and conuerteth man into God by
participation: how different an effect from that which the eating of that
forbidden tree, wrought in the first man, since he persuades himself that
eating the fruit thereof, he should be like unto God, which he did not only not
obtain, but became also less then man, and made himself like unto a breast.

Ponder the worth and excellency of this divine food, which in such fort
changes and transformeth him that receaueth it in state of grace, that it
makes him like unto Christ, as himself said: He that eats my flesh, abides
in me, and I in him.

From hence thou may gather a great fear of reprobation, that eating so
often this sovereign food, and fed like an insant with the milk of the
delights and daintines thereof, thou have not withstanding such a langui^hing
appetite, and reapest thereby so little fruit and profit, as if thou receauedst
him not, persisting in thy wicked life, and bad customs.

THE IIII. MEDITATION.
That Christ our Lord is most rich.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider how our Lord God whom thou have in thy breast, is most rich and
most mighty: In whom (as S. Paul says) be all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge hidden, and there thou shall find them, if with humility and without
curiosity thou shall seek them, under those sacramental forms of bread and
wine.

Ponder, that if the goods, which are contained in this sacred host, that thou
have received, be so great and sovereign (as in very deed they are) why do
thou not rid thy self of all the other goods thou have (which are not such) to
possess and enjoy these, as the Apostles did, and Christ himself did the same
for thy love, spending liberally all he had for the benefit of harlots and
sinners, instructing some, curing others, and shedding his precious blood for
all, and giuin to thee his Blessed flesh to eat that thy spirit might live.

Gather hence desires to give thy self intierly to him, who gave himself so
entierly for thee, and beseech him that seeing he is so rich and thou so poor,
and bestows his riches so bountifully on such as are so unworthy thereof as
thou art, he will vouchsafe to relieve thee, and that, since he commands the
rich to favor the poor, his divine majesty being so rich, he will not leave
thy soul deuoid of his goods, but that he vouchsafe to furnish and enrich her
therewith, enduing thee with the graces virtues and gifts of the Holy Ghost,
which thou want, and have need of.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider that whereas our Lord God was rich, he made himself poor (as S,
Paul says) that by his poverty we might be rich.

Ponder how much God loves poverty, being himself the chiefest riches, since
he calls Blessed the poor in spirit, promising unto such the kingdom of
heaven.

Gather hence desires to be poor in spirit in this world, that thou may be
rich in heaven, saying with the Prophet, Look upon me o Lord and have mercy on
me, because I am needy and poor, For what King or Prince is there in the
world, that lodging in the house of a poor man, brings not with him his
royal furniture for his own chamber, and at his departure bestows not on
him great graces and fanors. Wherefore O Lord, seeing thou being the chiefest
riches, have vouchsafed to lodge in my poor cottage, adorn it with the
hangings of grace and virtue, which are the furniture of thy royal house and
palace, doing some favor to the mai^^er of the place where thou art
entertained.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider the graces and benefits which our Lord God did bestow on Obededom
and all his, for having recaaued into his house the Arc of the Testament,
which was only a shadow and figure of this most holy Sacrame^et, but more and
greater benefits are received wheresoever this divine Arc and coffer of the
treasurs of God enters, which is his most sacred body, pierced and opened in
so many places, discovering his riches.

Ponder how this our Lord, entering corporally into the house of S. Peter's wives
mother, delivered her from her Fever: entering into the house of the
Arch-sinagogue, he revived his daughter: In the Pharisees house he pardoned
Saint Mary Magdalen her sins: finally entering into S. Elizabeth's house he
sanctified the infant Saint John, and replenished his Mother with the holy
Ghost: for where God enters, he works great wonders and miracles. Beseech,
him that seeing his divine majesty vouchsafes to enter into thy poor house,
and to be lodged therein, and is so rich in mercy, he would make thee partaker
thereof, pardoning thy sins and restoring thee to a new life of grace, to make
thee a Worthy habitation of his.

THE V. MEDITATION.
That Christ our Lord is a good Pastor.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider that Christ Jesus our Lord to make himself known to be a good
Pastor, would not only put on the gross skin of our humanity, that his sheep
(which are his select) might know, follow and love him, and not fly from him;
but would also feed and maintain them with his own most precious blood: Being
parched with heat, and cold with frost, leeping on the ground, fasting day and
night, finally like a good shepherd being slain, leaning unto a tree to
deliver his sheep from the infernal wolf.

Ponder the good offices which this excellent shepherd has done for thee an
unprofitable sheep, feeding thee, curing thee and seeking thee with the grie^e
of his heart, tears of his eyes, and the sweat of his brows, undergoing so
many afflictions and toils to reduce and bring thee back to the fold upon his
shoulders: and shou like a lost and ungrateful sheep, have strayed and cast
thy self so often from him to betake thy self to lewd pastures, which did
poison and kill thy soul.

Gather hence instamed and effectual desires to follow the steps of thy
shepherd, vvalking where he walks, and be assured that if thou permit thy
self to be ruled and governed by him, nothing shall be wanting to thee.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how often, in presence of this sovereign shepherd without fear
or shame, thou have grazed and fed in the green meddowes and forbidden
pastures of thy intemperances, not fearing the peril and danger of falling
into the gripes and teeth of the infernal wolves which be the Devils, from
whence this good shepherd bath so often delivered thee that were their prey.

Ponder how ungrateful thou have been to this great and Maystershepheard
Christ Jesus, for the favors and benefits he has bestowed on thee, in giving
his life for thee, since not content to be an unprofitable and erring sheep of
his fold, thou art also become a ravenous wolf, persecuring him with thy sins.

From hence thou may gather desires to bewail and lament them, and to call
upon thy Pastor with mournful bleating, that he may seek and find thee,
saying as a wandering and lost sheep, unto him: My Pastor, I knew well to stray
and loose myself (...) to reclayme and recover my (...) I know not. Seek me O
Lord, and fetch me out of the briary bushes of my sins, into the fertile
pastures of thy favor and grace.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider that this good Pastor said, I know my sheep, and they know me,
and I love them so well that I have not doubted to give my life for them. And
if this seem much, how great an argument of love may it be to have offered and
given himself for those wolves which have ma^gled and slain him.

Ponder first, how much it imports thee to treat often with thy Pastor,
that thou may know him, and understand his pleasure, desire, and will, for
this is it which he most expects of thee.

Secondly how much it avails thee to know thy self, that if thou have any
thing not beseeming the sheep of such a Pastor, thou correct and amend it,
least he expel thee out of his flock, which were the greatest disaster that
could befall (...)

Gather hence (...) to be the sheep of this shepherd, giving him all thou
have, without reservation of any thing to thy self, that is, thy soul and
body with thy senses, thy heart, thoughts, means, honors, life and
contentment, since he gave all these first for thee: and now to seal up the
whole, he gives himself to thee as food to eat. And if he have loved thee so
much, and bestowed such favors on thee being his Enemy, what will he give
thee, or what will he deny thee being his Friend, and a good and profitable
sheep, in regard thou art marked and sealed with his precious Blood.

THE VI. MEDITATION.
That Christ our Lord is a Spouse.

THE 1. POINT.
TO consider, that our LORD is the Spouse of thy soul, in whom in most perfect
manner ^ found all that which can be desired in a good Spouse. Beauty, as God
and as man, for he was goodly of beauty above all the sons of men. Nobility of
birth, as well of his Fathers, as of his Mothers side. Discretion most perfect,
for he is wisdom it self. Infinite riches, for he is heir of all that God
has in heau^ and in earth; finally he is very loving and of a sweet and
peaceable condition.

Ponder, that this spouse knows right well how to honor, adorn and
beautify, with his graces and virtues, the soul that is to be his Espouse,
observing toward her the ceremonies of true love, and taking pleasure to see
and discourse with her daily, and to cherish her with the precious and
sovereign food of his sacred Body and Blood, which she receaueth in the most
holy Sacrament that by these pledges and tokens of love, she may know that he
desires to be her Master and Spouse alone.

Gather hence desires wholly to yield thy self from this day forward as an
Espouse to such, and so worthy Spouse, and for no affliction or tribulation
whatsoever to abandone his friendship and sweet conversation: and keeping the
word thou have given him, beseech him to communicate unto thee some of the
manifold graces and virtues which he has in himself, that thou may be able
to correspond with love, to that great love he bears unto thee.

THE 2. POINT.
TO consider how that Christ our Lord only out of his mere goodness has set
his affection on thy soul deformed and poor, thou having been disloyal and
broken thy faith to him, not once, but an hundred times; yet the love
nevertheless which he bears thee is such, that he does solicit and entreat
thee to open him the door of thy soul and heart, for his desire is to be united
with thee.

Ponder thy indignity, folly, and want of love, how unwise and how much
ouerseene thou have been, in ^ot acknowleging this divine spouse and as an
adulteress have been disloyal unto him, having so often cast thy ^ies and
affection on base and deformed slaves. Yet the bou^ty of this our Lord is such,
that albeit thou deseruest a thousand hells, he pardons thee, inuiteth and
entreats thee to return as a fugitive to his house; and falling on thy
neck, as on the prodigal son, receaueth lovingly, entertaineth, and
cherishes thee, honoring thee with the garment of his graces and virtues.

Gather from hence desires to enter into his house, purposing rather to dye a
thousand deaths then to forsake such a Lord, such a Father, and such a Spouse.
Beseech him to give thee his grace hence forward to keep thy promised fidelity
unto him, commending thy soul and all the powers thereof unto him, that thou
may be no more thine, but his, who has taken thee for Espouse, saying with
her: I have found him whom my soul loves: I hold him, neither will I let him
go.

THE 3. POINT.
TO consider how great the dignity and honor has been, in which thy Spouse
has placed thee, since not regarding what thou deseruest, nor thy slender
fidelity, he graciously gives thee his hand and ring of his heart, that
henceforward thou may account, receive and enjoy him as thine with pledges of
so great love.

Ponder how great reckoning thou art to make of thy soul, since God esteems
so much thereof, that he gives himself. and all things else, to espouse
himself with her, notwithstanding her deformity and misery. And such is his
love and mercy that he hathfull often set his affection and been enamoured with
soul slaves, to make the^ his beautiful daughters which he has bought, not
with delight and pleasure, but with sorrows and torments, which is the coin
of the Cross.

From hence thou may gather desires to offer up thy heart and will to such a
Lord, so to be no longer thine own, but his who has bought thee with his
precious blood, and taken thee for his espouse. Beseech him to grant thee his
grace, that thou may observe fidelity and loyalty toward him, and that
seeing hitherto thou have been barren, thou may from hence forward begin with
his grace to yield fruit of benediction, with holy desires, words, and deeds.
