A Godly and short Treatise upon the Lords Prayer, the xii. Articles of the
Christian faith, and the ten Commandments.

Printed in London at the three Cranes in the Vintree, by Thomas Dawson, for
George Bishop, 1580.

Prayer is a lifting up of the heart unto GOD.
The Lords Prayer.
The Lords prayer has six petitions. The three first concern GOD: The three
last, us.
Our Father which art in heaven. Two things must be considered of us, when we
bend our selves to prayer: First, Gods love contained in these words, Our
Father: Secondly, Gods power contained in these words, Which art in heaven. God
is our father, because we are his children. If this be true, how is Christ
the only son of GOD? both are true: Christ is Gods son by nature: Ioh.
cap. 1. ver. 14. we by adoption. Romans chap. 8. ver. 15. Galat. cap. 4. ver. 6.
That which was his by nature, is ours by grace. We pray unto God in the name of
Christ alone, for God is our father by the means of Christ. If it be so, then
Christ is the alone Mediator of intecession. 1. Tim. chap. 2. ver. 5. Romans cap
8. ver. 34. Heb. chap. 7. ver. 25. So are Angels and dead Saints barred
from this office. The sacrifice of Christ's death and continual intercession
are necessarily linked together, they are two parts of Christ's Priesthood.
Heb. 5. and 7. Chapters. If we grant Angels or dead Saints to be
Intercessours, we give unto them the glory of Christ's Priesthood.

We have all one father, therefore unity is required among us. Math. cap. 5.
ver. 23.24. Ephesi. chap 4. ver. 3.4.5.6. Unity I mean, in Christ. Romans
chap. 15. ver. 5. Philip. chap. 4 ver. 2. For without Christ it is accursed.
Better is godly discord then wicked concord. GOD is our Father, we ought not
therefore too despair of his mercy. Our sins I confess, do throw us down
to Hell. Esaias. chap. 59. ver. 2. Romans chap. 6. ver. 23. Though they be grievous
and many, yet Gods mercy is above all. Esaias chap. 1. ver. 18. Ezech. cap 18.
ver. 23. The earthly father cannot but be good to his ungracious child, if he
return from his lewdness. Luke. chap. 15. ver. 20.21.22.23.24. Gods mercy is
more exceeding. Esaias. cap. 49. ve. 14.16. 1. Timoth. chap. 1. ver. 13.14.15.16.
If it be compared with the other, it is as a great Sea unto a little River. Gods
power is set forth in these words, Which art in heaven, whereby is meant that
all things whatsoever are under the government of the eternal God, and that
al things are ordered by his Providence. Psalm 115. ver. 3. Though God be in
heaven he is not there shut up. Such thoughts must be far from us: for the
Heaven of Heavens cannot conteyne him. 2. Chronicles, chapt. 2. ver. 6. GOD by
this speech is exempted from being a Creature, and we are taught not too
think basely of so mighty a GOD, for he is higher then all the world.

1 Hallowed be thy name. We desire that Gods name may be famous and reverenced
in all the earth, if it is to be reverenced, then must we never speak or
think of God without great reverence: it is too be wished that all were thus
affected: but if none were, God abides faithful, he cannot deny him self. 2.
Timoth, cap. 2. ver. 13.

2 Thy kingdom come. We desire that the lusts of our flesh, wicked
thoughts, and such like may be subdued, and that Gods spirit may rule in our
hearts. This is brought to pass, partly by the word preached, partly by the
holy spirit: who if he touch not our hearts, as the word does pearce our
ears, the word is a shut book. Esaias. chap. 29. ver. 11. and as a sealed
letter unto us. We do well in praying daily, Thy kingdom come, for it is
increased by continual goinges forward even in the best men. Philip. chap. 3.
ver. 12. Colossi. chap. 1. ver. 9.10. We are all in a race and short of the
macke, whilst we are in the flesh, we must go from faith too faith, and
from virtue to virtue, Proverb. cap. 4. ver. 18. Ephesians chap. 4. ver. 15.
There must be no standing ^^il: not to go forward in a godly life is to go
backewarde.

3 Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. The will of God is of two
sorts. The first secret: the second revealed in his word. None can
withstand Gods secret will. Esaias. chap. 46. ver. 10. Romans cap. 9. ver. 19.
his revealed will is meant in this place: so that this is the meaning: we desire
that all creatures may be obedient to Gods will revealed in his word without
muttering or resistaunce. The Angels do execute his will. Psalm. 103. ver. 20.
We must do the like so near as we can.

4 Give us this day our daily bread. By Bread are understood al things
necessary for this life, as meat, drink, and such like. 2. Kings chap. 6.
ver. 22.23. It is called our bread, not because of right it is due unto us,
but because by Gods good will it is appointed for our use. Psalm 145. ver.
15.16. If we will be fed of the Lord, we must abstain from other men's
goods, and be content with our own, Proverb. chap. 5. ver. 15. Genesis chap. 3.
ver. 19.2. These. cap. 3. ver. 12. The word daily signifies such provision
as may godly be come by, though it be never so homely, it takes away all
desire of delicates. I neither do nor dare condemn great fare, dayntie
provision, and such like. Gods gifts do serve not only for necessity, but
also for pleasure, Psalm 104. ver. 15. we may use them I say for pleasure, we
may not abuse them: They which think otherwise, do think amiss. These words
this day, do take away distrustful care for the time to come, which is
condemned by Jesus Christ. Math. chap. 6. ver. 25.28.31.34. Rich men have
Sellers full of Oil. Garners full of Wheat, what need they to ask? they have
enough already. I grant they have great store: but all is nothing without
Gods blessing. If the staff of bread be broken: Leuit. chap. 26. ver. 26.
Ezech. chap. 9 ver. 16. If God blow upon our corn: Aggeus chap. 1. ver. 9.
It will do us no good. Man lives not by bread only, but by every word that
proceeds out of the mouth of God. Deuteronomy chap. 8. ver. 3.

We pray for bread: notwithstanding our prayers, it is Gods gift. Psa. 145.
ver. 15.16. If the least things be Gods gifts, then eternal life much more.
Romans chap 6. ver. 23.

And forgive us our trespasses. By Trespasses are meant sins. Sin is
threache of Gods Law. 1. John chap. 3 ver. 4. Either in word, deed, or
thought. None are free from sin. Proverb. cap. 24. ver. 16. Luke chap. 1.
ver. 47. 1. John. cap. ver. 8.10. Al have need of pardon: for all desire
forgeuenes of their sins. If Gods children have need to be pardoned, they are
none of gods which say they need not forgiveness of sins. As we forgive them
that trespass against us. Injuries done unto us must be forgiven and
forgoutte^. Genesis chap. 50. ver. 21. Col. cap. 3. ver. 13 If we be reviled in
word, or evil entreated indeed we must neither be hard to forgive, nor hasty
to revenge, we must forgive an hundred pence, if we will be forgiven ten
thosand talents. Mat. cap. 18. ver. 35. Our forgiving of other is not the cause
why we are pardoned. Gods mercy is the cause. Ephesi. cap. 2. ver. 45. but it
is a certain argument that God has, and will forgive us, if we can find in
our hearts unfeignedly to forgive other. Mat. cap. 6. ver. 14.

5 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. That is to say,
Deliver us from evil, that we be not carried into temptation. By temptation
are meant all evil motions, which do allure us to sin. By evil, I
understand the Deuilliso that this is the meaning of this petition: though
evil motions (O Lord) do continually assault us and fight against our souls,
yet assist us mightily with thy grace, that we never be overwhelmed of the^.
We desire Gods defense against our enemy, and we have great need so to do.
The Devil is mighty: Ephesi. cap. 6. ver. 12. We weak, and not able of our
selves too withstand him. Ephesi. 6. ver. 11. Colos. chap. 1. ver. 11. But in
Christ we overcome: for stronger is he that is in us, then he that is in the
world. 1. John. cap. 4. ver. 4. If we needed not Gods aid, this prayer were
in vain. We are taught in this petition, that God leads some into
temptation. Esaias. cap. 6 ver. 10 Romans cap. 1. ver 24. The words are plain.
And lead us not into temptation. It seems strange that God should lead into
temptation. It is strange, I confess, to man's reason, but Gods doing is above
our reason. His judgments are always just, though they be often secret: and
God then leads intoo temptation, when he punishes one sin by another: and
when by taking away his spirit, and ditection he leaves man to himself. For
thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory for ever. Amen. We may be
bold too ask, and sure to obtain at Gods hands our godly desires, for his
kingdom, power, and glory cannot be taken from him. Gods kingdom is mighty
glorious and everlasting. Earthly Princes if they be compared with God are
nothing, and their kingdoms last but a while. Wicked men had not need to
wage battle against the Lord, they fight in vain and hurt themselves most.
Dan. cap. 4. ver. 32. Gods kingdom will be aloft, do what they can. Dan. cap.
4. ver 31. Ephe. cap. 1. ver. 21.

God give us grace to be and to continue his children, that we may have a
crown of glory in his everlasting kingdom for his Christ's sake. Amen.

Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. James, chap. 5. ver. 13.

Faith is the gift of God. Philip. Cap. 1. ver. 29.
Faith is an assured knowledge of Gods fatherly goodwill unto us by Jesus
Christ, and a trust in the same good will, which has joined with it an
earnest care to live a godly life.

The Articles of our Faith.
I Believe in God, etc. To believe in God, is to put our whole trust and
affiance in god. We must apply this belief every man to himself, otherwise it
will not profit us. The plaster, if it be not laid to the wound, will never
heal the sore. The just man shall live by his own faith. Romans cap. 1. ver. 17.
The father almighty etc. God is almighty, because althings are under his
government, and are ruled not by chance, but by his heavenly providence. Dan.
cap 4, ver. 32. Mat. cap. 10. ver. 29.30. Ephe. cap. 1. ver. 11. If it were not
thus, Satan and the wicked, who can do nothing without Gods sufferance, Job.
cap. 1. ver. 2. would easily overthrow us. Maker of heaven and earth. By
heaven and earth are meant al creatures whatsoever and wheresoever they be.
Apoc. cap. 10. ver. 6. When we confess God to be maker of al creatures, we
do not deny that he has care of preserving them in their estate. Heb. cap. 1.
ver. 3. That were in deed the high way to overthrow his providence: and such
thoughts do not become the children of God.

AND in Jesus Christ. etc. The Son of GOD is called Jesus, because he
saves his people from their sins. Math. cap. 1. ver. 21. His name is
according to his office. He is called Christ, because he was anointed with
the gifts of the holy Ghost, not by measure as we are, Ephe. cap. 4. ver. 7.
But without measure. John. cap. 3. ver. 34. That he might power on us great
store of heavenly graces. Our poverty is great, but by Jesus Christ we are
contimally enriched: his Storehouse cannot be emptied and his Fountain can
never be dried up. The Son of GOD was anointed a Prophet, to open unto us
the will of God and the glad tidinges of the Gospel. Luke cap. 4. ver. 18. He
was moynted a Priest too redeem us from eternal death by the Sacrifice of
his own body, offered once, not often, by himself, not by others. Heb. cap.
9. ver. 26.28. And to make continual intercession for us miserable sinners.
Heb. cap 7. ver. 25. He was anointed a king to govern us by his word, which
is his Scepter, and by his Spirit, which is the earnest of our inheritance.
His only Son our Lord. Christ is our lord, because we are not our own
but his. We are his, because we are bought with a price. 1. Cor. cap. 6. ver.
20. Not with silver and gold, but with his precious blood, 1. Pet. chap. 1.
ver. 18.19. We have good cause too love Christ: For he bought us dearly.
Act. cap. 20. ver. 28. Apocal. cap. 5. ver. 9. We must honor and fear him:
For he is our Lord. Malach. cap. 1. ver. 6. Which was conceived by the Holy
Ghost. If Christ had been conceived by man, he had not been void of sin:
John chap. 3. ver. 6. Job, cap. 25. ver. 5.6 and therefore unfit to deliver us
from sin. Heb cap. 7. ver. 26. Borne of the Virgin Mary. Christ was like unto
us in all things, only sin except. Heb. cap. 4. ver. 15. He took our nature
upon him. Heb. cap. 2. ver. 14. It is happy for us that he did so: for by this
means the Devil that had power of death, is destroyed, and we are reconciled
unto the favor of GOD. Heb. cap. 2. ver. 14.17 Suffered under Pontius Pilate.
Christ's life upon the earth did not much differ from death: but a little
before and at his death, barbarbarous cruelty was practiced. Math. chap. 27.
ver. 26.28.29.30.38.39.40.42.43. he was innocent by the judgment of Pilate,
but most unjustly condemned by that wicked hypocrite. Math. cap. 27. ver. 24.
Christ was free from sin: 1. John cap. 3. ver. 5. and therefore suffered not for
his, but for our sins. Romans chap. 4. ver. 25. 2. Cor. chap. 5. ver. 21. If
any say, that notwithstanding Christ's death, sin does still remain even in
the faithful: 1. John. 1. ver. 8. he may be answered, that sin does bite,
but not devour them. The sheelde of faith may be wounded, but it cannot be
stricken through. Was crucified. The death of the cross was most grievous of
al other deaths: it was accursed by Gods own mouth. Deuteronomy. chap. 21 ver. 23.
Christ did abide the death of the cross. Philip. cap. 2. ver. 8. He was made a
curse to redeem us from the curse of the law. Galat. chap. 2. ver. 13. so
that we may be now assured that Satan's head is broken. Genesis chap. 3. ver. 15.
and that the hand writing which was against us, is put out by Jesus Christ,
and fastened to his cross. Col. cap. 2. ver. 14.

Dead. Gods justice could not be satisfied for our sins, but by the death of
the Son of GOD. Heb. cap. 2. ver. 9.17. It was therefore necessary for us that
he should dye the death. If any marvel why we dye, when Christ has dyed
for us, they may be answered that death is grievous, but not deadly too Gods
Children: that it dwells in them, but has not dominion over them: and that
they dye, but do pass by the death of the body, as by a gate of eternal
life. 2. Cor. cap. 5. ver. 1.2. Philip. cap. 1. ver. 23. Seeing therefore that
the loss of this short and transitory life, is the high way and entrance into
Gods kingdom, we must not be afraid to dye, when our loving God does call
us, unless we make greater account of earth then of heaven, and of the
company of men then of God and his Angels.

And buried. Christ was buried by an honorable Counselor Joseph of
Aramathia, who begged his body of Pilat. Mark. chap. 15. verse. 43. His burial
is mentioned too assure us that he dyed indeed.

He descended into Hell (that is to say) He suffered the torments of Hell, and
did abide the most bitter sorrows of death, Acts. chap. 2. ver. 24. As if he
had been forsaken of GOD his father. Matthew. chap. 27. ver. 46. All this was
for our cause. Esaias. chap. 63. ver. 4.5. When we are in great torment, and
grief for our sins, when we are even at the brink of despair, then it will
be a notable sheelde to bear of all grievous assaults, too remember that our
Savior Christ went down into Hell, to deliver us from the torments thereof.
This lesson if it ^e surely learned and settled in our hearts, will heal a
wounded conscience, will tayse us up from the gates of Hell, and will in our
greatest distress be very sweet unto us. Christ did not descend into hell, to
fetch from thence the godly Patriarchs, and other which died well before his
coming in the flesh: that is a wicked dreme, and has neither ground to stand
on, nor ^ight to show it by in Gods Book, for they were never there.
Ecclesiast. chap. 12. ver. 7. 1. Cor. chap. 10. ver. 3.4. The third day he
rose again from the dead. Christ's enemies did what they could to keep him
down: they laid a stone upon his grave, they sealed the stone, they made the
grave sure with a watch: Mat. 27. ver 65.66. but al was in vain, for Christ
rose the third day from death. Math. chap. 28. ver. 6.7. Christ's resurrection
was great loss unto Satan, it swalowed up death, and broke in pieces the bonds
of the devil: Coll. cap, 2. ver. 15. It is gainful too us, for thereby we have
a sure pledge of our resurrection: 1. Cor. cap. 15. ver. 20.21.22. and are made
partakers of the righteousness of Christ. Romans cap. 4. ver. 25. He ascended
into heaven. Christ's ascending into heaven is manifestly proved in the
Scriptures: Mark. cap. 16. ver. 19 Act. cap. 1. ver. 9. Heb. cap. ver. 14. He
ascended into heaven to prepare us a place. John. cap. 14. ver. 2. and to pray
continually for us unto God his father. Romans ca. 8. ver. 34. Seeing that Christ
is our Attorney and pleads for us, we may go boldly unto the throne of grace,
that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in time of need. Heb.
cap. ver. 16. If Christ be in heaven bodily, as we are plainly taught in Gods
book by S. Peter and by S. Paul: Act. cap. 3. ver. 21. Phil. chap. 3. ver. 20.
Heb. cap. 9. ver. 24. Then he neither is nor can be bodily in many places at
once. It is true that Christ promised his Apostles, and in the^ other, that he
would be with them unto the end of the world. Mat. cap. 28. ver. 20. But he
meant by the virtue of his spirit: Ioh. cap. 14. ver. 18. in which sense S.
Paul says that Christ ascended above all heavens too fulfill all things.
Ephe. cap. 4. ver. 10. And sits at the right hand of God the father
almighty. God is a spirit: Ioh. cap. 4. ver. 24. He has neither hands, eyes,
arms, ears, nor such like as some have imagined. I grant the Scripture
gives eyes, arms, ears, etc, unto God, not that he has such, but to help
our weakness by such manner of speeches. Christ is said to sit at the right hand
of God, because he is above all rule and power, and might, and dominion and
every name that is named, not in this world only, but also in the world to
come. Ephe. chap. 1. ver. 21.22. Seeing that Jesus Christ is of so great
power, Gods children may assure them selves of a singular defense, and the
wicked may reckon of a grievous overthrow.

From thence shall he come to judge the quick and the dead. Christ when he was
on the earth was most unjustly judged: but in the great day he shall sit in
Judgment, and all the world shall appear before his Majesty. 2. Cor. cap.
5. ver. 10. none shall escape his judgment. Apoc. chap. 20. ver. 12.13. Dead
and living shall come before his presence. Acts. chap. 10. ver. 42. 2. Timoth.
cap. 4. ver. 1. If any say that death is the house of all flesh: Hebr. chap.
9. ver. 27. And therefore that none shall be alive at Christ's second and
glorious appearance, he may be answered, that as they which either have
already dyed, or shall dye hereafter before the day of Judgment, have and
shall put of the Substance of their bodies, so they which shall be alive at
that time shall put of, not the Substance of their bodies as the other have,
but the Qualities of their bodies: which is no doubt a kind of death: and thus
is the place of Saint Paul to be understood We shall not all sleep, but we
shall all be changed. 1. Corinthians. Chapter. 15. verse. 51.

This day of Judgment will be a comfortable and joyful day to God his
children: Luke chap. 21. verse. 28. Philip chap. 3. ver. 20.21. 1. Thessa.
chap. 4. ver. 16.17. for then they shall have full possession, as well in body as
soul, of Gods everlasting kingdom. Matthew cap. 25. ver. 34.49. It will be a
fearful day to the wicked. 2. Thessalonians chap. 1. verse 7.8.9. For then
Gods vengeance shall be plentifully powered upon them. Apocalips. chap. 20.
ver. 15. Matthewe chap. 25. ver. 41.46.

I believe in the holy Ghost. By holy ghost I understand the third person of
the holy Trinity, proceeding from the father and the son. John cap. 15. ver.
26. who as he is true God: Act cap. 5. ver. 3.4. 1. Cor. cap. 3. ver. 16. so by
his inward and heavenly working in our hearts, he assures us that we are of
the number of Gods children, Romans chap. 8. ver. 16. and that we are and shall be
cloched with Christ, as with a precious garment, and have Christ's benefices
plentifully and with a full horn powered upon us. The holy Catholic Church,
that is to say, I believe that almighty God had from the beginning of the
world, has presently in the world, and shall have until the end of the world
his church on the earth. Ezdr. cap. 9. ver. 8. Esaias. cap. 29. ver. 18.22.
though not alike visible at al times in the eyes of men. Esaias. chap. 49. ver.
21, Dan. cap. 7. ver. 21.22. Apoc. chap. 12. ver. 6. The visible Church is the
company of those which make profession too serve the true god in Christ The
Church is called holy, not because it is without sin, or cannot be dusked
with some spot, (for the whole Church prays for pardon of their sins) Math.
cap. 6. ver. 12. But for that Jesus Christ, who is the head of the Church, is
holy and that the holiness of the Church is begun in this life. The Church is
called Catholic or universal, because it is not tied to any time, persons, or
place. Ezech cap. 11. ver. 22.23. Mat. cap. 23. ver 37.38.39. Act. cap. 13.
ver. 27.28. but because it is scattered over the face of the world, according
to the pleasure of almighty God. This Catholic Church of God stands not in
multitude of persons, Act cap. 19. ver. 27. Apo. cap. 28. ver. 28. but in
weight of truth. Ephe. chap. 2. ver. 20 otherwise Christ himself and his
Apostles had not been Catholic, for his flock was very little. Luke ca. 12. ver,
33. and the catholic or universal consent of the world stood against it. Acts.
cap. 4. ver. 26.27. The communion of Saints. By Saints are mental the faithful
whersoeuer, sanctified by the holy Ghost: so that this is the meaning of this
Article: I believe that there is a communion or fellowship of and amongst the
children of God. This communion or fellowship of Saints is first, and especially
with Jesus Christ, who as he is the only head of the Church: Col. cap. 1. ver.
18. Ephesians. cap. 4. ver. 15.16. So he gives life and spiritual gifts to the
faithful, who are his members. This communion or fellowship is also amongst the
godly themselves, and appears evidently by unity of faith, by partaking of
the holy Sacraments, and lastly by relieuing one another, either with spiritual
graces, Heb cap. 3. ver. 13.1. These. chap. 5. ver. 11.14. Which must be used
to the comfort and good of others according to our calling, or else with part of
those external blessings which the Lord in mercy has made us stewards of. 2.
Cor. cap. 8. ver. 3.11.12. Heb. cap. 13. ver. 16. The forgeuenes of sins:
(that is to say) I believe that Almighty God has, does, and will forgive me
and al his children, al our sins committed both before and after baptism, 1.
John. cap. 1. ver. 7.1. Pet. cap. 2. verse. 24. how great and many so ever
they be. Esaias. cap. 1. ver. 18. Mat. cap. 12. ver. 31 not for any work or
merit of ours, Luke cap. 17. ver. 10. Esaias cap. 43. ver. 25. and chap. 64.
ver. 6. but for the death and bloodshed of the immaculat lamb Jesus christ 1.
Pet. chap. 1. ver. 18.19. Apoc. chap. 1. ver. 5. With whose righteousness
because we are clothed, we may assure our selves that we are delivered from
eternal death, which is the stipende and wages of sin, Romans cap. 6. ver. 23.
Almighty god has and does bestow many good things daily upon us, for which
we are greatly and deeply bound unto his majesty: but this benefit of
washing us from our sins in Christ's blood, if it be compared with the other,
does as far pass the^, as the Diamond does the Peeble stone.

The resurrection of the body: (that is too say) I believe that all men's
bodies, even the self same we carrye about us in our life time, and no other
then they, as touching the substance, (whether they rotte in the Grave, or be
any otherwise consumed) shall be raised up again at the last day, and be
joined to their souls. Job. chap. 19. ver. 26.27.1. Cor. cap 1.5. ver. 52.53.
Philip cap. 3. ver. 22. At which time the godly shall have full possession of
eternal life, and the wicked of eternal death. John. cap. 5. ver. 28.29. The
life everlasting, That is, to say: I believe, that as I have the seed of
eternal life already sown in my heart, which is very sweet, and a sure staff
to rest on in all miseries of this life whatsoever: so I shall be perfectly
happy in the life to come, and shall then and there praise the Lord God without
ceassing, and yet without weatinesse. Apoc. cap. 21. ver. 4. If Gods children
do believe eternal life, then they neither can, nor ought to doubt of the
certayntie of their salvation: for faith and doubting cannot stand together.
2. Cor. chap. 13. ver. 5. Romans chap. 8. verse. 14.16.7. The Lord for his mercy
sake increase our faith, and give us grace to live always in his fear, that
when we shall leave this transitory life, we may have the end of our faith,
which is the salvation of our souls purchased unto us by the precious death
and bloodshed of our Lord and only Savior Jesus Christ.

Amen.

Without faith it is impossible to please GOD.

thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under
the earth: (that is) Thou shall not make any Image, either to represent god who
cannot be seen: Deu. cap. 4. ver. 12.15. Acts. cap. 17. ver. 29. Or to worship
God by: Romans cap. 1. ver. 23.25. for it is against this commandment, Thou
shall not bow down to them, nor worship the^, (that is) thou shall not show
so much as outward reverence unto them, no not the bowing of the body, or any
part thereof: Exo. cap. 34, ver. 14. 2. Co. cap. 7. ver. 1. Romans cap. 11. ver.

4 Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day: (that is) thou shall spend
that day in hearing gods most holy word, in common prayers and such like, to
Gods glory and thine own comfort. Is it not lawful to have some other set
days for common and Christian assemblies? yes, no doubt, if superstition (that
is to say) the esteeming of one day more holy the^ another be absent, and the
Lord god sincerely honored. But the Lords day which we call the Sunday, is
especially appointed, because of our weakness by Gods church in steed of the
Jews Sabbath. Acts. chap. 20. ver. 7. 1. Cor. cap. 16. ver. 2. They which
absent themselves from Christian meetings, where God is truly served, either
wilfully as Gods enemies do, or for dispatch of business (which may be well
deferred) as worldlings do, are guilty, the one sort of conte^ning God and
his Church, both which are highly to be esteemed. Mat. cap. 18. ver. 20. 1.

Magistrates, whom God has armed with the sword. Prou. cap. 20. ver. 26. Psalm.
101 ver. 8 Romans chap. 13. ver. 4. If the Magistrate condeme us unjustly, must
we obey? we must even to the abiding of death. 1. Pet. cap. 2. ver. 23. But yet
commit our cause to God, who judges justly. 2. Chronic. chap. 24. ver. 22. 1.

usury, Ezech. cap. 18. ver. 8.13. Psalm. 15. ver. 5. color of law, 1. Cor.
cap. 6. ver. 9.10. by enclosures of commons, whereby the poor either are, or

ver. 17. and. chap. 4. ver 2.

9 Thou shall not bear false witness. against thy neighbor: (that is) thou
shall not put thy hand with the wicked, to be a false witness, Exodus chap. 22.
ver. 1 either by word or oath: thou shall not by receiving or reporting a lie,
Exodus cap. 23. ver. 1. either impair thy neighbors good name. Psalm. 15. ver.

ver. 17. Mat. cap. 18. ver. 15. As it is great wickedness to bear false
witness any way, or to any end: so is it very lawful to witness a truth,
either for the increase of Gods glory, the ending of controversies amongst our
neighbors, or for the safety of our Prince and Country. To refuse too witness
or utter the truth in these cases, either by word or oath, is too be wicked

neighbors wife, nor his servant, nor his maid, nor his Ox, nor his Ass, nor

was, is, or shall be able to keep Gods commandments in this life.

SEeing that none can keep gods commaundeme^ts in this life: why will the Lord
have them so exactly and severely preached? I answer, that we seeing in the
law as in a glass, what grievous sinners we are, and how by our corrupt nature
we do incline, yea rather are carried headlong to sin, Romans cap. 3. ver. 20.
and. cap. 7. ver. 8. might have feeling of, and be sorry for our sins, and so
be led by the law, as by a scholemaister to Jesus christ: that we might be made
righteous by faith in him. Galat. chap. 3. ver. 24. by whose stripes we are
healed. 1. Pet. ca. 2. ver. 24.

The Lord possess our hearts with his holy spirit, that we may be careful
too please, and afraid to displease him. The Lord forgive us all our sins,
