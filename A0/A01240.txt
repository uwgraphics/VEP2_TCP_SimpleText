A BRIEF DESRIPTION OF THE REASONS THAT MAKE the declaration of the Ban, made
against the King of Bohemia, as being Elector Palatine. Dated the 22. of
January last past, of no value nor worth, and therefore not to be respected.
FIrst, in that pretended process, there is found a most great imperfection in
the principal foundation and ground thereof. That is touching the matter and
subject of the Imperial jurisdiction: for that neither Divine, natural, nor
civil Law, does permit the Emperor to be Judge in his own cause, or that he
can, in the present difference now made, wherein there is a question touching a
pretended usurpation of the Crown of Bohemia, and of the interest of the house
of Austria, ground the aforesaid Declaration, upon a breach of public peace,
and consequently in the pursuit of his particular interest, to serve his turn
against his adverse party, with most rigorous penalties of the constitutions of
the said Peace, which consist in the loss of all his Goods, Countries,
honors, and namely his life.

For although men will not dispute nor strive with the Emperor touching the
power that he has, by virtue of the constitutions aforesaid of the Empire,
against the breakers of the public peace, which according to the opinion of
civil Lawyers, a Judge may judge of, and make Decrees concerning his Office,
and judicial authority, as also touching the conservation thereof: yet it is
most certain and evident, as well by the Judgments of all Civil Lawyers, as
by natural equity, that the maxim aforesaid, is granted only in cases,
wherein there is no question made of an interest, profit, and great advantage
of the Judge, and when the Act in it self is most manifest, and without any
doubt or difficulty whatsoever. Otherwise, and for want of such circumstances,
it is most dangerous, that one self same person should be Judge and party, or
that the Judge and the party should sit both in one seat: for it shall be
showed, and most evidently declared hereafter, that in this pretended
Declaration, there is no respect had unto the said common doctrine of the Law,
nor to natural equity. Besides, that the golden Bull, as a fundamental law of
the Empire, in express terms most plainly absolueth this question. That is,
whether the Emperor may or can be Judge, in that which concerns his
particular affairs, or those of his house, saying: That an Emperor, as King
of Romans, in causes and matters that are alleged against him, is bound by an
ancient custom, to appear and answer before the Elector Palatine, as not
being permitted to be Judge in his own cause. Which words, so clear, and so
express, should be unprofitable, and of no effect, if an Emperor of Rome could
be both Judge and party. And such an absolute power of the Emperor, was never
at any time heard of, nor known among; nor unto the true and good Almaines or
Germans, as being directly contrary to their liberties: and it will be found,
namely in the time of Frederick the third, in the controversies between Duke
Albert and his brother, as also in the differences of Habsburg: yea, and by
some examples in the house of Austria it self, that ordinance of the golden
Bull, and fundamental constitution of the Empire, was confirmed by a
consequent observation. Considering that the precedent Emperors of most worthy
memory, did always submit themselves to the ordinary course of Law, at all
times when any question was to be decided touching their particular
patrimoniall goods and possessions: So far off were they from suffering
themselves to be carried away to such a passion and rigor in their own
interests and advantages, as in this case, which at this time is in question,
Such kind of violence being not exercised in an other man's cause, of much
greater consequence, which concerned the loss of diverse Provinces and notable
Towns, withdrawn from the obedience of the Empire, the forces and revenues
whereof are weakened and diminished more then the half.

Further, and secondly, it cannot be denied, That the case in question, does
not particularly touch nor concern, (neither in the first and highest degree)
the Emperor and his house: and yet notwithstanding, the pretended Declaration,
has been decreed, and concluded by his Counselors, and servants, who by a
most strict Oath; (whereof there is no release in this point) are bound to
procure the good of their Master. And for that the said Counselors and
servants, from the beginning of the troubles of Bohemia, have sufficiently
showed, that their intents, and preiudicate Judgments, proceed from a hatred
and a most extraordinary animosetie, not only against the reformed Religion,
and those that generally make profession thereof, but also against the person
of the King of Bohemia, and the Elector Palatine, particularly. In this, that
in all, and in every place they have sought to condemn him, before they heard
him speak for himself, or once received his Iustifications. It is easily to
be judged that this pretended Ban, the Declaration whereof was consulted of,
drawn and published by the wills and consents of the Imperial servants
aforesaid, had no reason, nor any ground of impartial Justice, and that
consequently all the Process is of no force nor value, passion and animosetie
(as it is said) having therein had all the government and direction, treading
Justice under foot.

And thirdly, in this point it is to be noted and well waighed, what men may
judge and esteem of all the points of this process, which without all reason
and nature it self, was begun and intimated by the execution. In this that
Marquis Spinola, under the pretense of an Imperial Commission, with his Army
raised and paid by the King of Spain, did by manner of hostility invade the
Electorall Palatinate, before the said pretended Declaration of the Ban was
published. Wherein, there was no manner of respect had of any of the States and
Countries that were neutrall, and therefore wholly innocent: as it appears
manifestly by the ruin and entire desolation of that so flourishing a Country,
which justly might be compared with the best parts of Germany, which is
directly contrary to the Imperial capitulation: by virtue whereof, no Emperor
is permitted, to use any such violence: but by a most singular wisdom and
foresight it was referred to the laws and fashions of the Wars used amongst
the ancient Germans, and reduced to certain terms in such affairs of the
members of the Empire, in these words. That the Empire shall not forcibly
assail the Electors, Princes, and other States of the Empire, but having any
question or controversy against any of them, to shun and avoid all violence,
troubles, and commotions, he shall cause the same to be descided by way of
Justice, and shall not permit them, to be vexed, nor pursued by arms,
violences, or invasions. For if in case of less consequence, a Judge, before
Judgment given, proceeding by actual force against a party, loses all his
credit, and is deputed of the authority and power of a Judge, as it is most
true: what may be said of him, that sets upon his adverse party by open
force and arms, dispossessing him of all his goods and estates, and at the end
of all his violences and indirect and wicked proceedings, pronounces him
guilty, and proclaims the Imperial Ban against him.

And seeing, that for the fourth reason, in all formalitie of Justice,
specially in that which concerns a public violence and outrage, it is
necessary, that the least and meanest pesant or Citizen that is accused, ought
to be orderly summoned, to yield a reason of his actions: by greater reason, it
is most necessary and convenient, that this requisite formality should be
observed toward an Elector of the Empire, of so high a house, and so great a
dignity, as the Elector Palatine, specially when it concerns his goods, his
estate, his Country, his life, and his honor; and to be short, all that which
he possesses in this world: For specially to speak of the crime of the
infraction and perturbation of the public peace, it appears by the laws of
the Empire, that before all things; the party, that is to be accused of such a
crime, should be summoned, and heard in his iustifications, and defenses, that
after an exact understanding of the fact, judgment may the better be given,
and knowledge had whether the public peace and tranquillity has bin violated
and broken. And to that end, that the party may not be condemned, and submitted
to the most rigorous pains of the Ban, at the only request, or under a false
suggestion of the contrary party: which can not be justified, neither by the
ordinances of the Imperial chamber, made and concluded in form of a public
and perpetual contract between the head and the members of the Empire, nor
also by the capitulation; whereunto, as the precedent Emperors, so also the
Emperor at this day bound himself by a solemn Oath: within express and
manifest terms says. That his Majesty shall not permit, that from
henceforth, any of the states of the Empire, Elector, Prince, or others, shall
be put into the Imperial Ban, without cause, and without lawful knowledge of
the same: but that in such case, he shall observe the formalities, and lawful
proceedings, all in conformity of the constitutions and customs of the Empire,
according to the tenor of the reformed ordinances of the Chamber, and
Sovereign Court, published touching the same. Now although all this is most
true and manifest, yet it has all bin put out of consideration, and of the
tenor of the pretended declaration: seeing that without citation, without
knowledge of the cause, without any formalitie, they have gone so far as in
their own proper cause, to proceed to a most manifest iniust sentence, and to
declare an Elector of the Empire to be a criminal: who by the golden Bull, is
qualified to be one of the principal members of the body, and a pillar of the
Empire: whose electorall dignity in the Empire, is esteemed to be of no less
account then the Royal. To whom for an accomplishment of all iniquity; they
deny that which is due to the most wicked and greatest malefactors, yea and to
the wicked spirits themselves, (as some men say) who are not condemned, without
their cause be first heard: seeing that it is altogether manifest, that this
pretended sentence against the King of Bohemia, was not only published without
any formalitie, as it has many times bin said, but extorted and procured by
the importunate solicitations of the Spanish Ambassador, at whose lodging the
first counsel was holden, as also by treaties made under hand and cauteously
with the Archbishop of Mayence and others, all without the knowledge of the
Ellectorall college: which ought lawfully to assemble, demurely to weigh the
pernicious consequence of so violent and rigorous a proceeding, whereof may
ensue the ruin and entire desolation of all the Country.

And although they seek to color and excuse this headstrong proceeding (which
is so much the better known, that ten months before the pretended sentence,
they began to practice the execution by force of arms) in this sort, that by
virtue of the Imperial constitutions and edicts, in case of a manifest and
permanent rebellion, there is no need of any formal Process against those that
are attainted, but rather by the tenor of the same it is permitted to proceed
actually (against those that are culpable) by force of arms: and yet they
cannot show any such manifestation of the Act which is now in question. Seeing
that the King of Bohemia, did neither by practices, force, or other means,
intrude himself into the Kingdom, but entered therein, and took possession by
a most just Title, as believing most assuredly that the Crown was vacant, as
appears by the manifest protestations and declarations by him published and
sent into all the parts of Europe. In such manner, that the notice required, to
form a Process upon the constitutions, against the perturbators of the
public peace, can have no place in this subject; and if this pretended
infraction be so notorious as they said, why did they not at the first serve
their turns, with the reasons and edicts of the Empire, which they now
allege? Why did they defer eight months, and until the assembly at
Mulhausen, (whereof there could not a copy be had, notwithstanding all the
instance that could be used therein) to frame a Process in so notorious a crime
as they pretend it to be? why did they not in an Act holden to be so evident,
stand to the constitutions published for the execution of the Imperial Ban?
why did they not call the jurisdictions to put their helping hands thereunto?
But why in a crime made so notorious, did a great part of the Catholic
Roman states declare themselves Neutrall? Why were they prayed and requested
as well by the Emperor, as by the Arch Duke Albertus of Austria, and Marquis
Spinola, to continue and abide in those terms of Neutralitie? seeing it is
so, that in such and the like actions concerning the public necessity of the
Country, every one is bound, to contribute something thereunto; and without
any exemption, to aid and succor those, that therein are oppressed? And how
comes it, that the Duke of B^uiere, with his Army intimating the Imperial
commission, makes a distinction between the Elector Palatine, and the states
of Bohemia, whom he says he would pursue as notorious rebels. A crime
whereof he discharges the Elector Palatine, when he says, that touching him,
the said Elector, he stood not in such terms: And besides all these things,
this pretended notoriousnes is made void and disanulled, by the diverse
deductions and apologies of the said edicts of the Realm of Bohemia, which are
extant through out the world.

We must no less consider for the first point, that in this exorbitance, they
seek to ground the pretended declaration of the Imperial Ban, only upon the
Imperial constitutions of the Empire, touching the public peace, which
nevertheless; according to the tenor thereof, do not concern nor bind the
King of Bohemia, seeing that such constitutions, were not made nor determined
within, but with the six Electors, and other states of the Empire, concerning
the superiors, and the subjects, comprehended in the ten jurisdictions of
Germainy: and that so a state of the Empire cannot be punished nor persecuted
as a breaker of the public peace, by reason of an offense imputed to the King
of Bohemia, for it is most evident and manifest, that a King of Bohemia, does
not acknowledge the superiority of a Roman Emperor, but in regard of the
Electorall dignity, and of the Office of chief Cupbearer; and that touching
other things, the Crown of Bohemia is exempted from his Imperial
jurisdiction, in the same manner that diverse other vassals and members of the
Empire are, as Milan, Sanoye, and many others in Italy and else where: which
neither will be, nor are bound to the aforesaid constitutions, touching the
breaches of public peace: from whence also it follow^h that in the Imperial
assemblies, and when question is m^de of contributions for moneys, and other
affairs: the said Realm is always accounted as a stranger, and is not bound
to contribute to the charges of the executions of the Empire, against the
public perterbators thereof: as it is yet manifest by the declaration made by
the Emperor Ferdinand the first, to the states of the Empire, Anno 165^ wherein
he protests and says, that the say^ Realm of Bohemia is exempted, and
depends not on the Empire. And the memory is yet fresh touching that which
happened to the Emperor Rodulph, for whose sake no man stirred, although his two
Crowns were taken from him, and that he had held the Scepter, and governed
the Empire 36. years. And it was never understood that the Crown of Bohemia,
had any respect or regard to the public tranquillity of the Empire, or to the
public laws for the conservation thereof, but always followed the example of
other Realms, and strange Potentates, according to their laws and particular
customs.

But looking nearer into the constitutions concerning the public peace, as the
only ground and foundation alleged by this declaration; we shall clearly by
the qualities that therein are required, perceive and see the nullitie thereof:
for as in all faults and offenses a man must be attainted of a manifest
practice to make him culpable: so in this crime of breaking of the public
peace, the like must be done. Now touching the King of Bohemia, whom they will
make criminal in this subject, it will never be proved, that he did ever use
any practice or fraud, neither before the acceptance of the Crown of Bohemia,
at the receiving thereof, nor after the same: for those that have published the
declaration, therein attest, that presently after the troubles raised in the
same realm; his Majesty used all the means he could to quench that fire, and
to end that difference: from whence he solemnly protests, calling and taking
God to witness, that he never practiced to have that election put upon him,
which so unexpectedly fell unto him: which assertions and assurances he may
well stand upon, until such time that the contrary is showed and brought to
light, which until this day never any man dust undertake. In such manner, that
it cannot be supposed, that his Majesty ever had any desseigne or thought to
break and trouble the public peace: because he always alleged the said
Title to be lawful, wherewith the Emperor would serve his turn in his
pretenses. And put the case, that in the refusal of the said Emperor, the
state, of Bohemia did commit a fault (which yet is not proved) that never the
less cannot be imputed to a practice or deceit in the King of Bohemia: He
having not in any sort done, nor procured any thing to that effect; much less
then ought they to use any extreamities against him either in his body, honors,
or goods, before he were convicted of deceit and fraudulent dealing.

For touching that which they allege; that he, as he is Elector Palatine is
bound to bear respect unto the Emperor, that cannot in any manner justify
these proceedings; for that he has always borne that respect unto the Emperor,
that is due unto him as Emperor, and never pretended any thing against him in
that quality; but only in quality of Archduke of Austria: He has not also
enterprised any thing against his greatness and Imperial authority. And it
cannot be verified by the Oath of fidelity of the Princes of the Empire, that
any mention is therein made touching the goods and Patrimoniall estates of the
house of Austria. In such manner that in these occurrents of Bohemia, touching
the particular pretenses of the said house of Austria; that Oath of fidelity
will serve their turns as little as it did when the states of the Empire did by
virtue of the said Oath, refuse to deal with the wars which the Emperor
Maximilian the first had with France, the Venetians, the Low Countries, and
Zwitzerland; or to take part with the quarrel of Charles the fifth, against
William Duke of Iulliers in respect of Gelderland, or to esteem that the
recovery of the Duchy of Wertemburg was a thing that concerned the Empire,
or that it was a matter of high treason. Likewise it is an allegation of no
force, to allege the revolt made in Austria, by means of the Bohemian army,
to prove the practice and deceit alleged; seeing it is manifest, that the
same Army was under the pay and command of the said states of Bohemia, and
sent by them into Austria, thereby to divert their enemies, and to recover that
good and treasure which the Earl of Dampiere had forcibly taken from them in
their Country, and that a good while before the Election, and acceptance of
the Crown of Bohemia, in such manner that the same revolt, cannot be imputed
to the King of Bohemia.

Now, for that by virtue of the said most manifest disposition, set down in
the constitution of the Empire, anno 1594. it is necessary, that in all
actions, whereon men will ground the rigorous pains and punishments,
pronounced against the infringers of public peace, the qualities thereof ought
to be evidently showed, together with a manifest proof of a true (and not a
feigned) indirect course, and that for want thereof, the defendant and he that
is accused ought necessarily to be absolved. Seeing also, that the Elector
Palatine has etterprized nothing but that; whereunto, the general election of
five several Provinces had invited him: and that after the example of diverse
other Potentates, and namely of those of the house of Austria, to discharge his
conscience, and to preserve the said Provinces from greater desolation and
danger, to be wholly withdrawn from the Empire, wherein he has been more
commended then blamed by diverse great personages and others, namely Strangers,
having a regard to the State of the affairs, the Bohemians griefs, and the
despair whereinto they were reduced. Therefore it is referred to the Judgment
of all the world; whether his actions ought to be held and judged to be a
rupture of the public peace, And whether in regard of the same, a most
notable and special member of the Empire, without notice of the cause, and
against the constitutions and capitulations aforesaid, ought to be banished and
dealt withal in such manner: with com^^^dement to all others, not to adhere
unto him, nor yet in ^hy manner to aid him (although it should be only against
the sense of the said Declaration of Ban) upon pain of loss of life, and
likewise to be comprehended in the said Declaration: which is no other but to
introduce a Spanish servitude, and to attribute unto the Emperor, an absolute
authority of life and death over all the States of the Empire, that would
oppose themselves against the particular pretenses of succession, and others of
his house. Whereby it would follow, that the Emperor should be permitted to
serve his turn, (by the means of his passionate Counselors) with an absolute
power, which the^ call plenitudinem potestatis, as in effect in the said
Declaration, more then once they presuppose such a power, for the ground
thereof: although the capitulation made with an Oath by the Emperor to the
Electors, should derogate from an absolute power, and that the Doctors of the
Civil Law will not hear, speaking of an Act of so great importance; and so
the Emperor (by virtue of that power, without any contradiction) might decree,
ordain, and do what he thought good for his particular profit, or for that of
his friends, or to the prejudice of the liberties of Germany, notwithstanding
all Imperial constitutions and ordinances.

To conclude, all true Germans and lovers of their Country and the Liberties
of the same, are desired and coniured to have a regard to this lo sudden,
extraordinary, and most dangerous proceeding to all the States of both
Religions, and to believe, Quod cuiuis contingere potest quod cuiquam
contingit. The most puissant God, direct and guide the thoughts of every man in
the way of truth and equity, and of his paternall grace, cause our native and
dear Country, to enjoy a good and secure peace.
