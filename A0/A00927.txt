HIEROTHALAMIVM. OR, THE HEAVENLY Nuptials of our Blessed Savior, with a
pious Soul.

WRITTEN By Richard Flecknoe.

Omne tulit punctum, qui miscuit vtile dulci. -- Horat. Anno M.DC.XXVI.

TO THE GREAT EXAMPLE of Virtue and Nobility, the Lady Katherine Abergauenny.
MADAME, THIS small POEM, (a late Birth of mine, and so meanly clad, as poor
Art it self is even ashamed of it) I should scarce have ventured to present
unto your Ladishippe, had I not more then hoped, that the Excellency of the
Subject, would (in your just Esteem) have kept at least in equal Balance, my
wants in writing it.

I am to profess (Madame) so many extraordinary favors, by which your
vnwearyed Goodness has ever pleased (above my deserts) to honor me, as I am
forced to seek out some more then ordinary way, to show my self in Will,
their grateful debtour, in Ability I cannot hope. Therefore Madame, remaining
still your debtour in the Principal, all I am able, and intend to do, is to
call as many others as I can, into the Interest of the Debt with me; by letting
all know (who from the reading of this little Work, may receive either Profit
or Delight, that they owe it wholly to your Ladyship.

By this means perceauing, that I was like to draw your Name, as Party, into
the Reputation of this Work, I thought it would best become my Care, as it
did my Duty, (who otherwise as you will see, have affected nothing in the
writing it) so to provide, as none might receive offense, or harm by reading
it. Of which happiness (though somewhat rare in these Times, and more in such
Works) being secure in its Innocence, and my Well-Meaning it, it dares with
the more Confidence, and cheerfulnes approach unto your Ladyshippe, to leave in
your fair Hands, a perpetual testimony of his Respect, and Duty, whom your
Great Virtues, and many Deserts have won to be

Their ever Servant, and Faithful Honourer. Rich. Flecknoe.

The First Canto.
ARGUMENT.
The Bridegroomes State,
And grace, in setting forth,
His Courtiers order,
And his Mothers worth.
1.
Midnight silence, all be dumb,
Rise, and see the Bridgroome come.
But beware that none come near,
Only those, whose breasts are clear
From all crime, or sin, so foul,
That may wound, or kill the soul.
These are Mysteries, and Rites
To be seen by chaster Sights,
To be marked, and understood
Only by the pure, and good,
Virtue, (as it is most agreeing)
Only's fit for Vertu's seeing.
2.
Look, the Heavens transparent gate
Open's wide, and out there at
First a flight of Angels come,
Some do play, and other some
With the flickr'ing of their wings
Keep the time, whilst others sings.
Others strew the way with flowr's
Gathered fresh from Eden's bowr's
Such for sight, and curious smell,
As they knew would most excel,
All in general, Joy do share,
To themselves, peculiar care.
3.
Those the Ancient Prophet's were,
who that wondrous Banner bear,
Whose true Color none can know:
They appear the less in show,
'Cause about their heads there flies,
Such a cloud of Mysteries,
As unto our Sense they leave
Scarcely ought we may perceive.
But those soul's to whom it is given
For to know them all in Heaven,
There are few, or none, do say,
Make a fayrer show then they.
4.
Those more open to our sight,
Next in rank, with Garments bright,
Whose dear Poverty does wave,
In that Ensign which they have,
(Gloss of which will never fade
Though in watercolors laid,)
Were Apostles. Those are they
Who from fishing in the Sea,
Came to take more soul's on Land
Then the shoars have graynes of sand,
With no other Netts, or Hooks
Then their Tongues, and holy Books.
5.
Those who fair Vermilion bear
With green Laurel, Martyrs were,
Mark how through their shining red,
Be It in body, heart, or head,
All the Wounds were given them here,
Brighter then the Sun appear.
Soars, are changed to precious Gemmes,
Grievous stripes, to glorious beams,
Drops of blood, to Rubyes red,
Scarres, to Crowns upon their head,
Tears, to Pearls, and every pain
Has it is proper Joy, and gain.
6.
Those whose Colors fayrely spread
Show pure white, bestreak't with red,
Were Confessors, such as here
Armed by Virtue against Fear,
Durst confess their Faith, in time
When it was thought the greatest crime,
These are they, who did reduce
Thousand souls, from sins abuse:
Who Hells gates (in manner) brake
With the force of Truth they spoke:
For the which their tongues now shine.
(As you see) with light divine.
7.
Those that next do take your eye,
Are the Glory's of the sky,
Whose white Streamers do declare,
That they ever Virgins were.
In whose sight, is understood
All that is perfect, rare, and good.
Look's as simple, as the Doves,
Fair, as twenty thousand Loves,
Sweeter, then the breath of May,
Fresher, then the newborn Day,
With their Virtue yet, compare
All these parts, they nothing are.
8.
But in midst of these does come
Graces, and Perfections sum.
Queen of Heaven, and Mother dear
To the Glorious Bridegroom there,
As the Rose, the Three-leau'd grass
Both for sweet, and fair, does pass,
As the Day out-shines the Nights,
As the Moon the lesser lights:
Blessed She, so far, and more,
Passes all that went before.
At whose praise no Angels tongue
Offer's, but it must do wrong.
9.
But now mark, how all thing cheers,
When the Bridgroome first appeers;
How his Face does glory's flame.
Know you whence their brightness came?
In cold mornings we perceive
Words, behind a mist to leave:
So each word, which He does say,
Turn's into a sunshine ray:
Which besid's we may presume,
Vapors all this rare perfume,
That does make the gentle air
Amber-sweet, as Ro-sy fair.
10.
Purple is his marriage weed,
Which the star's, do thicker seed
Then a frosty winters night,
When the Moon shines fair and bright.
Phosphorus like a precious stone,
^ast before, does keep it on,
And behind it loosly flow's,
Proud at every step he go's
For to kiss his Blessed feet;
Whence it does return more sweet,
^hen the flowers which May conceyu's
^om the air that Zeph'rus breaths.
11.
That tongue were of God-like worth
Which could every grace set forth,
And whoeuer pen them will,
Does deserve an Angels quill,
And for Ink, were only good,
Virgins tears, and Martyrs blood,
Mixed with sinners contrite galls,
For their much repented falls,
Written on the Milky Way;
All we write, and all we say,
All we comprehend by sense,
Reaches not his Excellence.
12.
Virgins hence, and close your eyes,
Least his Love your minds surprise:
The are to tender, He to fair,
Every Look will be a snare,
For to take the waryest heart:
Therefore go, in time depart.
You Have enough already spyed,
To be envious of the Bride.
Yet stay, wretch what have I done?
It Is his will that all should come.
Stay, hark, He himself does call,
He has Love enough for all.
13.
Neither fear her Iealousy,
She does love, as well as he,
That you freely look upon him.
Till you are all enamored on him,
Feed your eyes, and take in flame,
Keep your blushes, hide your shame,
It becomes those Virgins most,
Who the ardent'st love, can boast
Unto him, who all love merits,
And all Virgins love inherits,
Fear not, join you by his side,
And with us, go see the Bride.
The Allegory.
IN the great Procession of the Celestial Court is understood, the General
Joy, of all the Saints in Heaven, when any one on Earth is found worthy to
receive their maker in the most B. Sacrament. The Bridegroomes attire is
purple, for to signify, that jointly with the Joy of the receiving him, we are
to call to mind the bitterness of his passion. That it is adorned with stars,
is to show, that the reward of sufferance on Earth, is Glory in Heaven.
Phosphorus, or the morning star, on his Garment before, declares, that his
presence in coming, brings light unto our souls, and that we should take his
Grace betimes when it first appears, since when it is once past, we may expect
it is return, but cannot call it back.

The Second Canto.
ARGUMENT.
The Brides Attire,
Her meeting with her Lover,
The gifts he gives,
The joy she does discover.
1.
THAT is she, who kneeling there,
Seems to have no hope, nor fear
Out of heaven, wherein her eyes
Fixed (as if the cleerer skies
Were her mirror) seek to find
Graces fitting to her mind.
Her hands foulded each in one,
As if only they alone,
(Earth not owing any such)
Did deserve each others touch.
Beg of Heaven by ardent prayer,
Her dear lovers quick repair.
2.
She, no other Jewel wears
Then her own congealed tears,
Which, on simple Goodness set,
Make a precious Carcanet.
Her attire is strange to gold,
And as far from rich, as old,
Which receaues no other staynes
Then it is native, but remaynes
White as is the Sheep that bears it,
Pure as is the Soul that wears it.
Sandalls do conceal her feet,
On her head, are Flowers sweet.
3.
Beauty there (whoeuer seeks)
Sits enthroned upon her cheeks,
In a color, red as Roses,
Or when first the morn discloses,
White, as mountayns when it snows,
Or the yielding down, that grows
On the breasts of Swans, and Doves,
Spread with hair, that when it moves
Casts amazment on our sight,
It Is so excellently bright.
One may seek the world, to find
Such a form, with such a mind.
4.
Now the Bridal pomp draw's near,
And the noise has reached her Ear,
Ears, her Heart inform of all,
Heart leapes up, and Love does call,
Love, sends Curiosity
Up in have, unto the Eye,
Eyes, look out, and Joy appears:
Poor Joy, almost drowned in tears,
Running to the heart in have,
Sowing rumors as he past,
Puts her in Alarm so,
Where she is, she does not know.
5.
Her swift eyes, that highly move,
Mounted on the wings of Love,
Or'looke all, but no where bide,
Till their prey they have espied,
When she envying of her eyes,
Straight to his embraces flies,
Where she now remayns intwin'd,
Hands in hands, as hearts are joined
Sugared words, with sighings mixed,
Eyes upon his beauty fixed,
All, her love and joy declare,
For to see her Bridegroom there.
6.
Unto some it strange may be,
That so great a King as he,
Would so far from State descend,
To make choice of such a friend,
Who, her birth can neither boast,
Nor (what takes our liking most)
Does in richer clothing go,
To affect the outward show.
Beauty without wealth, some few,
Yet can be content to view:
But if Virtue want them either,
She Is preferred by none to neither.
7.
Let such know, her Innocence
He esteems, full competence
For to match the highest State,
As was ever enuyed at.
Others (though they are poor respects
Which her noble mind neglects,
And disdaynes to Court,) yet He
Of mere love, and care (that She
May not suffer disesteeme,
In those wants, the world does deem
So essential,) for her Honor,
Will bestow them all upon her.
8.
And with Riches, which is first
After our account (though worst)
He in such a sort indews her,
As it takes, who ever views her
With a just esteem, and wonder
How much earthly wealth comes under.
She herself is all a Mine,
And in every act does shine,
So much true, and perfect wealth,
As even Avarice it is self,
Such a Treasure to behold
Would despise it is baser gould.
9.
This, the Privilege has given
To en-title her to Heaven,
Co-heyre with those Blessed sprit's,
Who are drowned with all delights
In that Sea of joy, and bliss,
Where no end, no measure is.
This is True Nobility,
This is that, with cannot die,
This is it, which does not claim,
Others Worth, to guild it is shame;
But it self, it is self commends
Unto Honor, Fame, and Friends.
10.
Now the heavenly Quires do press
To bestow their Kiss of Peace
On this happy Soul, they see
In such heyght of Dignity.
Now the Bridegroom does conduct her,
Whilst his Mother does instruct her,
To the Temple, as behou's,
To confirm their Blessed loves,
By the wishes waited on
Of all present joined in one;
That no cause be given ever
This their Heavenly match to sever.
The Allegory.
IN the Prayer of the Bride, is to be noted that we should be as careful, in
regard of Gods greatness, to receive him worthily, as desirous in respect of our
own wants, to receive him often. By the playnnes and simplicity of the Brides
attire, is signified that innocence and purity, which is required in those
souls, whom he does please to visit with his gracious presence. The Jewel of
her Tears, does show that Sorrow for our offenses, by which we should duly
prepare our selves, unto the receiving of him. Her Sandalls the Humility, and
Flowers, the grateful odor of our works, and merits.

What is said of Beauty, both here, or in any other place, is meant and to be
understood only of the Soul, whose invisible Fayrenes can no ways be rendered
perceptible to sense, but by Examples of visible Excellency. That she has not
any riches of her own, but what are bestowed upon her by the Bridgroome, does
show, that God gives not Virtue to any, in respect of wealth, but wealth
oftentimes, in regard of their Virtue; and that we are not further to care for
them, then it is his pleasure we should enjoy them.

The third Canto.
ARGUMENT.
The Marriage in the Church,
The Rites expres't,
Her Reverence, and
Inuiting him her guest.
1.
NOW with due becoming state
They have entered all, the Gate
Of the Temple, arch't with gould,
Rich and shining to behold,
Rew'd with Iaspar pillars, set
On fair bases all of Iet,
Marble which the sight does vary
On the pauement (as in Quarry)
All one piece does seem to be,
It was joined so curiously.
With clear lights, the Isles are taper'd
With perfumes the Vaults are vapour'd.
2.
They, not far had led the Bride,
When before her she espied
A fair Picture, did of right
Challenge every Virgin-sight.
Twa's the Kingdom of the Blessed,
By so lively skill expressed,
As it made her nigher draw,
Thinking all was true, she saw;
And deceau'd, with listening ear,
To assay, if she could hear
Music, which the Angels made,
Whilst they sung, and whilst they played.
3.
Twa's an Omen liked her well,
Wherefore she did longer dwell
On the sight thereof, and took
More delight from every look.
There she saw the Virgin Quires,
Shining bright with Holy-fyers,
Following of the Lamb along,
Seeming for to sing a song,
Which (a Scedule there did say)
None in Heaven could sing but they.
Much she had conceyu'd before,
But, this sight did add much more,
4.
Longer she would feign have stayed,
But her stay, she was affrayd
Might to some seem to discover
A neglecting of her Lover.
And (who knows) perhaps, withal
Some her indiscreet might call,
Who in fay'nd things could delight,
Whilst the true on's were in sight.
Therefore wisely she went on,
Though resolved, when she was gone,
Deep in heart away to bear
All impressed, she had seen there.
5.
Now they nigh the Altar come,
And in order fill the room,
All prepare to be implied;
Virgins to attend the Bride,
Priests to Celebrate the Rites,
Angels to assist with Lights,
Music, and Perfume: there is none
Whose employment is not known;
Every one does take some care,
And if any Idle were,
They with wishes do assist
The Bride, the Bridgroome, and the Priest.
6.
Tw'as to all the Saints a sight,
Did beget them much delight,
To observe the trembling Bride,
Kneeling by her Lovers side,
How her well composed eye
Never cast a look awry,
For to catch at Thoughts, which might
Bring distraction with the sight:
But did reu'rently regard
All she saw, and all she heard,
Whilst the Priest set all things forth,
With state, equal to their worth.
7.
Though she wished the time were come.
That might join them both in one,
And (to think too long) had cause
Every little stay, or pause:
Yet as every Rite did pass,
So attent, and glad she was,
As if each, the reason were
Only of her coming there.
When to Heaven for Kyrie eleison.
help they call,
She her voice does join with all.
To the like her mind they move
When they glorify Gloria in excelsis
her Love.
8.
When they Sanctus*
Holy do proclayme him
She with much delight Dominus Deus.
does name him.
When they Eleuatio^.
show him unto all,
There is none does lower fall,
With more humblenes before him,
For to reverence, and adore him.
When they call to mind Agnus dei.
his Cross
Who can more resent his loss?
When they do profess, Domine on sum dinus.
there is none
Worthy of him, She alone
Thinks there is none, her eyes can see
But is worthier far then she.
9.
But at last when she is invited
By due prayers, and Tapers lighted,
To draw near, and take Communion.
her Lover,
O what Joy does she discover?
Tears her eyes had ouerflow'd
Sighs burst forth, and plainly showed,
Though Joy, would not let her speak*
They must vent, or she must break.
He as much Love did express,
As she Joy, and tenderness,
When thus solemnly they both,
Each to other plight their troth.
10.
The Brides declaration of her Love.
1.
The World shall sooner want the sunns fair light.
The Moon extinguished be, and put out quite,
The stars in darkness leave the heavens above.
2.
The spring shall sooner cause the days grow short,
And fading Autumn, make them longer for it,
Ships, on the land shall sail about, and move.
3.
Carts shall be drawn the liquid waters over,
Fishes in the woods shall live, in the sea the boar
Shall sooner find his food, and where to tread.
4.
Then I shall cease to love thee, ever dear,
Whether I breath the life which I have here,
Or el's am numbered with the ghastly dead.
11.
The Bridgroomes to her.
1.
Nature may prove a Stepdame to the Earth,
Spring may refuse to give her Flowers birth,
And tender Mothers hate their first borne child.
2.
Fair Virtue from her Goodness may depart,
And Vice may reign without the conscience smart,
All love from gentle Breasts may be exild.
3.
The Sun may leave the day, the Moon the night,
Prosperity her Joy, and Envy spite,
The auaricious may despise his Gould.
4.
But I, dear soul, can never change from thee,
Whilst Love and Virtue which have taken me,
Keep in thy heart that place which now they hold.
12.
Then whilst Angels sweetly sing,
On her hand he puts a Ring;
Ring, which had such virtuous might,
To expel with only sight,
All Temptations Sin does breed
In the thought, the word, or deed;
In the mind a luster setting
By pure thoughts of it is begetting.
Thus the Ceremonies done,
All preparing to be gone,
She her Spouse, that day her guest,
Lead's unto the Marriage feast
The Allegory.
BY the picture, upon which the Bride so liberally bestowed her eyes, at her
Entrance into the Temple, is signified, those good Thoughts and Cogitations,
which the holiness of such places does often suggest unto us. By her withdrawing
her sight from it, as soon as she remembered she had other more necessary things
to do; is showed that we should never so dwell on the delectation of any one
good work, as thereby to neglect a greater.

In her Devotion and Attention during the Celebration of the holy mysteries, we
are taught, how we are to concur with the Action and Intention of him who
Celebrates.

By her Ring, may be understood the memory of our B. Savior, on which if we
but often and seriously reflect, it is impossible we should be so ungrateful
to him, and traiterous to our selves, as to betray the Fort of our Innocence
(by the Intelligence either of thought, word, or act) unto any Vice, or
Imperfection.

The fourth Canto.
ARGUMENT.
The Nuptial Feast, wherein
Is much commended,
Her Drink, and Fare; but
In excess she ended.
1.
HENCE exulting Joy, begone,
Else thou wilt kill the Bride anon.
She does feed with souls delight,
And, as if her Bridgroomes sight
Her, like him, did heavenly make,
Has forgot all food to take.
How her eyes are fixed on his,
Scarce believing her own bliss,
That so poor a Soul, as she
Should be Love, to such as he,
And when most assured it is true,
Then, she most does wonder new.
2.
Melting snow, that hills does crown,
Touched with sunshine, runs not down
Swifter, nor more currents seeks
Then the tears upon her cheeks.
Much I fear they will never have done!
Now to see his face, they run
Trickling down, and now as fast
When she finds, that they have cast
Such a mist her eyes before,
She can scarcely see him more:
So betwixt her Joys and Fears,
Tears, are only cause of Tears.
3.
In the midst of all our noise
Singing loud their Nuptial Joys,
She her silence breaks no more,
Then the fish when seas do roar,
Least perhaps to gain discourse,
She, herself does wisely force
For to lend a word to lone
Of a thousand words for one:
But the whilst, as they are paid,
Blessed Heaven, how she is affrayd
Least each one should be the last,
So too soon her gain be past.
4.
Why is all this Music here?
See, it never takes her ear.
Angels, though you play, and sing
Till the Air with Echo ring,
Though it is sweet, and rare, yet she
Is so far from thanking ye,
As sh' admirs how you can do
Any thing, but hearken to
Those his hony-flowing Words
Which into her Ear affoards
Sounds more sweet, more pleasing far,
Then your Quiers, or Consorts are.
5.
Why do you lavish, and consume
So much rich, and choice perfume?
She alone might well suffice,
For to sweeten all the skies,
With those sighs, which she does spend
Without measure, without end.
Grief, before I ever knew
Joy, could weep as well as you,
Swoune, and suffer, all speech barred,
But such sigh's I never heard
Soft, I see therein does lie
Yet some deeper mystery.
6.
Mark her, she does use to frame
Of her breath, her Lovers Name,
Tasting which, her mouth receaues
All the gust, that honey leaves.
Oh Repast divine, and rare!
By that Food we nourisht' are
Which we take, and in receive;
She, by that, which she does leave:
Yet the effect is far more strange,
Food in us to Earth does change,
Hers, in Him, to Heaven; so breath
Wisely has beguiled death.
7.
But some Epicure will say,
She consumes herself this way,
Not supplying Natures needs,
But does languish as she feeds.
Peace, thou Earthly mind, thy food
Changes first to flesh and blood,
Sickness does thereon awayt,
That brings death, her diet straight
Turns to life, and better spirit,
Fills her full with glorious Merit,
Does her soul at last commend
Unto Life, can never end.
8.
Now, when she does list to drink,
Oh what humane thought can think
On the sweetness, which she tastes,
Whilst her draught delicious lasts!
Yet, dear soul, how ere you feign,
I do see, it brings you pain,
Whilst you drink out of a wound,
Not alone, for Love you sound,
Be It in feet, in hands, or side,
In conceit it opens wide,
Even as deep a wound in you,
As those precious ones you view.
9.
Drink not, thirsty soul, so deep,
Temperance bids a measure keep.
Scandal does arise from such,
Who unwary, drink too much.
She all counsel does despise,
Stops her Ears, and firmes her Eyes,
Every daught begets a thirst,
Hot and fiercer then the first.
O how great the danger is,
Least some harm. do follow this!
And now see, She leanes her head
In her Lovers arms, as dead.
10.
Angels bear her forth, I fear
Much the cause; she is stifled here:
There Is no doubt her health's impair
May be helped with better air.
But himself alone sustaynes
All the burden, all the pains,
Thinking nothing thoroughly done,
'Lesse his Blessed self be one,
Rub her Temples, bow her head
Bear her to the Marriage Bed:
Fear not, she will revive anon,
When her Ecstasy is gone.
The Allegory.
IN all this Feast is nothing else to be understood, then only the tender and
pious affections which are incited, and stired up, in high Contemplative
Souls, by the receiving of the B. Sacrament, as namely their Devout
Colloquies, seasoned in tears, and mixed with sighs, to give the more delicate
taste and relish to their high-fed Souls, and also the strict watch they keep
on their Attentions, to bar the entrance of any thoughts may bring
distraction with them. By her swoning, is signified the sweet force of the
Divine Love, which (as if it had changed darts with Death) does oftentimes
leave the Bodies unto the Grave, by enticing from them the Souls, unto the
loyes of Heaven. Lastly, by the Angels Care, and Bridgroomes diligence, in
bearing of her forth out of that close Chamber where she was (the world) into
Heaven, her Bridal Chamber, is shown, that God is never wanting to assist
them at their Deaths, whose Virtues whilst they live on Earth, do labor a sure
and perfect Friendship, betwixt them and Heaven.

The fifth Canto.
ARGUMENT.
The Chamber of the Bride,
Her' maze, it is stayres.
Their Joy, the rest, the
Angels song declares.
1.
NOW, they up a wondrous stayre,
Far above all noisome air,
Toward her chamber bear the Bride,
When not able to abide
Such a brightness, such a height,
Leaden Death, with his own weight,
Fell to ground, from of her eyes,
In* a grave, where now he lies.
Then they straight vnclos'd, and gazed
At her being so amazed,
As tw'as long ere she could give
Her self credit, she did live.
2.
And who could refuse to wonder,
For to see Earth lie under
Such vnmeasur'd way below
As it was almost lost to show.
For to see the waters stand
Like a wall about the Land,
And without so surely fenc't
With the moyster air condens't,
For to see the humble fire
Neither burn, nor mount up higher!
None of these but might amaze
One who far more bouldnes has.
3.
Yet this wonder did not last,
For her eye aside she cast
And in it, lost all her fear,
When she saw her Bridgroome there.
That which made her wonder cease,
May perhaps make ours increase.
She of all strange things that were
By one glaunce on him, more clear
Did the hidden Causes see,
Then within a Mirror, we
Our own faces, when we look,
Studying most that flat'ring book.
4.
So all Wonder turned to Love,
Love in her, a Heaven did prove,
Heaven, as they did go, was there,
Heaven they came to every where.
Heaven within her, and without,
Heaven above, and round about:
Heaven is in her Eyes, and Ears,
Nothing now but Heaven appears,
In each sense, in every part,
In her mouth, her loving heart,
And these Heavens are all, alone
In her Bridgroome, joined in one.
5.
She without all pain does go,
(That vn'wares she left below
On the under floor of clay,
Whilst in deadly trance she lay,
For some faint, and worldly mind
Dares not higher go, to find.)
And they now arrived are
On the highest Crystal stayre,
Joining to a porche of gould,
(Eyes did never the like behold)
That directly in does guide
To the Chamber of the Bride.
6.
See* the doors do open stand,
And the Bridgroome by the hand*
(Whilst the Saints his praises sing)
His fair crowned Spouse leads in,
All the Souls that heaven had ever,
There stand ready to receive her,
For her glory, every one
Far more glad then for their own:
Yet there is none has more expressed,
Of a glad, and joyful breast,
Nor of Love more pledges given,
Then the sacred Queen of Heaven.
7.
Those whose Joys, are at the height,
Think they are happyer in her sight,
And who know they are loved most,
Such a Rival soonest boast,
They so have her in to bear,
As our Night begins, I fear,
And those Glory's which we see
Too to soon, will vanished be.
Darkness winnes upon the skies,
Now they lessen in our eyes,
To a Star, which was a Sun,
Now a spark, and now they are gone,

What a dark, and ugly sight,
After so much Glorious Light,
This black Clod of Earth Appears.
But, what Music strikes our Ears?
Sure, it is that the Angels make,
For the Bride, and Bridgroomes sake:
Which whilst Echo brings to ground,
Travail does enrich the sound.
Let us hearken what they say,
Somewhat may be learned this way*
Hearing that, we cannot see
Is of Joy the next degree.
HIEROTHALAMIVM.
I.
SING Io Hymen, chastest Hymen all,
And with loud voice the Brides great Joys repeat,
So Echo tossed, as not a word let fall.
May make them seem less sou^ding then they are great.
But in this heyght they are at,
May they for ever be*
That even the Saints, when as they see,
And have her Blessings known,
May think there is somewhat wanting of their own.
Yet Joy with her, and wish her more beside,
And join with us, in hon'ring of the Bride.
II.
Now world farewell, she thinks on thee no more,
Or if she does, it is but to compare
With much disdain, thy wants, with her great store.
Thy course^ feeding, with her daynty fare,
Thy mynds perpetual care,
With her Souls lasting peace,
Thy Barrennes, with her Increase;
Thy want of sense to choose
Such things, for wealth, which her does them refuse
Make only rich; Thy thousand woes beside,
With the perpetual blessings of the Bride.
III.
You need not boast your Issue, nor be glad,
It Is but a wreched shift, that Nature finds
For to repair the Spoils, that Death has made,
The Sower of all Cares in Parents mynds,
Which she who well declines,
Does soon find, what a blessed
And happy change she has made, by rest
She feels with in her soul,
When no unquiet thought, does there control,
Or urge those Cares, which Ease does not abide,
Happy are such, thrice happy is the Bride.
IIII.
It is their Joy, who grieve that they are old,
To have some Issue they may leave behind,
And in their sight, their passed youths behold,
Joy, is but Ease of Grief in humane kind.
Who want's does seek to find,
Who hunger's, food does love:
But happy souls, who are above
The need, and lack of these!
Here, are delights which never know decrease,
Here, youth is lasting, life does ever bide,
Joy wayt's on it, They all, upon the Bride.
V.
No Ielou'sy her quiet heart molest's,
No fear, of too untimely loss of life,
No heavy care, that presses married breasts,
No cause of grudging, or contentious strife
The woe of man, and wife.
No Lothing, but the same
Fire, which now burns with holy flame,
To light their Loves to day,
Will ever last, and never can decay;
For he has chose, who cannot change abide
To have her ever for his Spouse and Bride.
The Allegory. or Conclusion.
TOUCHING the Allegory in this last Canto, little is to be said. The Stayres by
which the Bride was borne up unto her Bridal Chamber, do allude unto the
Elements and Planets, which (according to the Astrologers) do fill up by their
orderly distances, the space betwixt Heaven and Earth, wherein I make the Caeum
Cristallinum (following the General opinion) the highest step of this
stayre, and next adjoining to the Caelum Empyreum, or habitation of the Blessed.

It may to some perhaps, seem some want of good manners in Art* to bring the
Bride only to the Entrance of her Bridal Chamber, and there abruptly to leave
her and follow her no further: But if the Paynter Timant, was thought worthy of
praise, for paynting Agamemnon (present when his daughter Iphigenia was to be
sacrificed,) with his face covered, signifying that his Grief was greater,
then could be seen in his countenance; I see no reason, why I should be
blamed, for passing those Joys in silence, which are greater then can be
comprehended by humayne sense, or Imagination. Besides, that breuity which I
have studied from the beginning, loath now to loose it is Palm at the later
end, did hasten me away from more prolixity, by affoarding me this reason: That
it was every way auaylable unto this work, and me; that those who were
delighted with it, should be sorry it is so short, and those who were not,
should be glad it is no longer.
