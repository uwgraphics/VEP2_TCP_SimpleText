Imprynted at London by Nicolas Hill, for John Case, dwelling at the sign of
the Baule, in Paul's church yard.

YE that in you the desire to know
I good ware for to take,
Whereby to riches ye might grow,
And ydlenes to forsake,
This little book with dylygence
Se that ye read and mark,
Thoroughly notynge the good sense
Contained in this warke,
Py thy precepts you shall here find,
Right pleasant for to read,
Whereof perchance some youth are blind,
And thereof shall have need,
Do not therefore despise this book
Because it goes in ryme,
For they that on this book does look,
Shall find the matter fine.
The preface.
Seeing gifts are not so much to be valued for the price of them as they are
to be esteemed for the good entente of the geuer (most gentle reader) my
small labors and travail herein bestowed (which I frelye give thee) I shall
humblye desire thee to take in good part, wherein although the mattier be not
in every point so exquisytely handeled as my good will and seal could have
wyshed it, yet I do nothing at all mystruste but that ye will with favor
bear with me, and rather frendlye wyncke at the faults if there be any, then
spytefullye as carpers at other men's doings seek occasyon to dysprayse the
same, forasmuch as the hole effect thereof treats of nothing but of good
and wholesome counsayles enterlaced with pleasant mirthe and honesty, to youth
no less right profitable then necessary. Licurgus, who for his grauytie and
excellent wisdom gave laws unto the Lacedimonians, amongst his other
laudable and seruyouse statutes, did institute and ordain a certain kind of
exercise, at the which the elders which had borne rule in the common wealth,
did commonly mete there, to pass the time with pleasant talk and wyttye
tales, but such as were always either profitable to the commendation and
praise of honestye, or else to the detestynge and rebukynge of vices, because he
perfectlye well considered that it was a thing most needful and requyset
sometime with such goodlye recreation to refreshe the weakenyd powers of the
mind, that it might be thereby the more fresh and apt to compass and
accomplish other more wayghtye affairs. I omytte other probable auctorities
which I might now worthelye bring herein, to declare that this little work
is not to be rejected although after a number of pythye precepts there
follows a merye invented mattier placed therein only to quycken the spyrytes
and to aucyde tedyousnesse. And who is so ignoraunte, but that he well
understands that youth commonly takes more delectation in redynge those
things which in his age requires then in grave sentences cereouslye
pronounced. Yet here shall he learn if he read it with dylygence both how to
lead a quiet and godly life in the fear of God, and also to exchue the
assaults of sin and dangers of the world, unto this bryttell age, (I say)
therefore I have written this, and not the prudente well stryken in years,
whose experience perchance has sufficiently taught, and who have alredye
passed the daungerouse rocks, and swallowynge quick sands of this
troublesome world. My honest meaning therefore gentle reader, herin, if thou
thanckfullye receive, I shall hereafter be the more willing to take some
pains in other mattiers. And so I wish thee well to fare.

A pleasant Pathewaye
IT chanced that on the eleventh day.
Of the floryshynge Month, of lustye May,
When Titan, into Taurus, his enterye began,
And the young blood, of every creature than,
Renewed his strength, and powers did revive.
So that each thing now, appeared on live,
Which in the stormye winter, before,
Had sustained, Eolus Isy blastes sore,
And that the waterye Snowes, had them so torn,
Because, of the vehement rage, of Capricorn.
Which cold cloudye mystes, once paste their way,
Each thing, received again courage, in his array,
And because the sharp cold, his malice had done,
The Mauis endeavored her self, first, her notes to tune.
Next after, the pleasant Nightingale, tempered her voice,
Which we her merry melody, every heart, does greatly rejoice,
The Thrushe, the Blackebyrde, and the Grenefinche also.
In this merye spring time, did she we what they could do,
And then also, the Sun shynynge very hot,
Caused the crabbed Cockowe, to declare her old note,
In this fresh time, (I say) for my recreation,
Into the woods I walked, to take delectation,
As Well for to hear, the joyful birds sing,
As also to behold, how every thing did spring,
And show them selves, again, alive in their kind,
That in the winter, were bare, and naked, to the rind
Each tree budded, and his leaves began to sprede,
Each herb had his flowers, in every grene mede,
The Primerose, the Violet, were then in their prime,
And the sweet smelling coursloppe, flourished at this time,
The Hauthorne, the Cheritre, and the Damascigne,
And each Aple tree blomed, declarynge good sign,
That if God their sweet blossomines, would vouchesafe to save,
Great store of fruit, of them we should have,
And thus going alone, under the wood side.
A fair aged man, I shortelye espyde,
And even straight after me, he came a soft pace,
I stayed a little therewith, thynckinge in this care,
This old man seems, a man of gravity,
And therefore I would be very glad, of his company.
In this stayinge a while, at last he ouertoke me,
And with very grave countenance, saluted me gentlye,
And with salutation, again I did him great,
As to my duetye, I thought it most mete.
Good father (and if it please you) said I,
Tell me, how far your journey, this way does lie,
And of the same lie, any thing near,
I wylbe very glad, you company to be are,
For I have, at this time, little to do,
And would therefore, learn, some good counsel of you.
And because it is so, I am young, and frail,
And not as yet instructed, with wholesome counsel,
My life to direct, in time for to come,
Good lessons, of you, I would learn some.
Which might cause me, for you, hereafter to pray,
When I shall follow the same, an other day,
Gentle son, (quod he) the truth to declare,
About sour miles hence, my journey is to fare,
And because I am aged, and may not well go,
I take the morning with me, for it behooves me so,
And back again to night, homewarde, will I, if I can,
Nine mile a day, is a great journey, for an aged man,
Wherewith, I remembered my self, by and by,
And beheld the Sun shine, so gladsomely,
Clear was the sky, and lightsome was the air,
And also the way, sented very fair,
My busynes, in deed (quod I) father, lies three mile and more,
Along that way, which ye must go, and therefore,
I will go with you softly, and make no great haste,
For it requires none, and this forth on we paste,
God thancke you young man, said he: that ye are so kind,
Since ye will go with me, and not leave me behind,
And because your good will is, some wisdom to lere,
The best counsel I can give, ye shall here,
And I will gladly, give you the heringe (quod I)
Therefore when it shall please you, say on by and by.
First good son, ye must to me make plain,
Where is your dwelling, and where ye remain,
What state ye are of, and of what disposition,
And whereunto your mind is given, in every condition,
Also what is your name, ye must to me show,
And whether ye are syngle, or married I would know,
Before, I can show you, my good abuise,
Or in any thing prudently, enstructe you otherwise.
Truly (quod I) my dwelling, is not far hence,
And to a worthy gentle man, of great reverence,
Late servant I was, but he is now deceassed,
Wherefore of service, I am clearelye released,
And touching mine age, I am young it appears,
As yet not passing, one and twentye years,
Nitne save truly, most men call mine name,
Also single, and unmarried, as yet I remain,
Well then, I perceive (quod he) ye are yet young enough,
In virtue to begin, and so lead your life through,
And also at liberty, and without a wife,
Nor as yet addicte, to any one kind of life,
Further as far, as I may or guess can,
Ye were lately as it were, a serving man,
Now whether it be, your mind, and your will,
In the trade of service, to continue still,
Or leave of the same, and by some other mean,
To seek otherwise, your living to sustain,
This also to know, I earnestlye require,
Or else, I can no way, satisfy your desire,
In good faith (said I) so more I thrine,
A servant I have been, about years five,
And truly have served to my power,
Since into service, I entered the first hour,
Wherein, there is so great, travail, and pain,
At most times, and so very little gain,
And at other times also, ydlenes so great,
Doing nothing, but settinge, in the feldes, and streate,
Wherein, also there is much great exercise,
Almost, of every manner, and kind of vice,
Both pride, dronckennesse, and also swearynge,
By abominable others, God him self tearing,
Such quarrelynge, fighting, and other abomination,
Whereof, I could make, unto you true relation,
If it were not odible, for you to hear,
As therperience thereof, plainly does appear,
That I intend, utterly, the same to refuse,
And some other, more godly state, of living to choose,
Wherein I may, spend my time, more honestly,
And in the fear of God, live more quietly,
Without doubt (quod he) thou have said truly,
For besides, the foresaid noughtenesse, plentye
When a man has, served, a great time,
If he have done, never so little a crime,
Away he must, there is none other remedy,
Thus, is he put, to his shifts, by and by,
And put case, that he in service continue,
Until age come, that he can no more do,
Then is he cast of, either to beg his bread,
Or in miserye, to live, till time he be dead,
And evermore commonly, it is seen and hard.
This to be, of miserable service, the reward.
And to serve any man, in the court of renown,
You see, how soon, they be up, and down,
But if it should chance you, as it does, to very few,
Ye should, so in your masters favor, hap to grow,
That he might by some office, or other way,
Get you any good living, some one day,
Which is but a chance, and fortune ye may it call,
For they gape them selves, for every windefall,
Then shall he think you, still to him bound,
So long as ye are living, on the ground,
And if it chance him hereafter, the law to have offended,
You also being his man, are like to be apprehended,
Then have ye well, and fair fished in deed,
Your rysynge, was then, in more haste, then good speed,
And some, wise men flee commonly, such living to seek,
Which is first so hard to come by, and after so il to keep.
Wherefore, to apply thy youth, no more in it,
I can not choose, but greatly allow, thy wit,
Now then (quod he) further, what other vocation,
Serves thy mind thee, or to what occupation,
To get thy living, either by trade of marchaundise,
Or by some handye craft, or art otherwise.
No (said I) in marchaundise, I have no skyll,
Nor to spend my time, therein I will,
Forasmuch, as the same, is ruled by chance,
Also, sense I am ignoraunte thereof, how can it me auaunce,
And he that by merchandise, will get his living,
Needs both good credit, and a stock at the beginning,
But in me lacks both, for stock have I none,
And because I was once a serving man, my credit is gone,
Few merchauntes will trust, any of that race,
Although it were never in so honest a case,
Besides that, I must swear, perioure, and lie,
If I will, byinge and selling occupy,
My wares, must be now and then, also counterfeit,
If I intend, by them, any gain to get,
Through which I shall, displease God, and sin,
Thus doing, I shall, a fair threde spynne,
I will rather despise, such unhappy winning,
As will bring me to hell, at the first beginning,
You say well, (quod he) and besides all this,
To be a merchant, son, another thing there is,
For many merchants, of late in this land,
Have been undone, and brought behind hand,
Which never could, after again arise,
Such is the bryttell state, of marchaundise,
Also, said I, in any other handye craft, or science,
Truly to confess, I have none entelligence,
And though I had, yet is the world, now in such penury,
That almost no kind of crafts man, can live thereby
All kind of things, are now waxen so dear,
That the like has not been seen, this many a year,
I will tell you, (quod he) sense time, I was borne,
And I shall be just. lxxx. year old, come to morn,
Was never, such misery, necessity, and need.
Amongst each estate, in every stead,
As is even now, at this present day,
For though, diverse times past, as I say
Corn has been, as dear, here before,
Yet of all other things, we had plentye and store,
But now, the price of all things, has lepte, such a leap,
That another, fode, clothing, nor any other thing, is good cheap,
In whom the fault is, truly I can not tell,
But I would to God, that all thing were well,
And I tell you young man, in good earnest,
I heartely thancke, my redemer Christ,
That my hoore head, is so near unto the grave,
My unserye, shall be the shorter, that I feel, and have,
But concerning, our first communication,
It seems, your mind is, to none occupation,
What then, have ye good learning, any whitte,
Perchance, to be a priest, ye thyncke your self fit,
And surely (quod he) if your calling be so well,
Then ye do amiss, never a del,
For to preach, truly Gods word, and be a minister,
If your calling be thereunto, ye can not do better,
Certaynlye (quod I) my learning is but small,
And to great a matter, it is, for me to meddle withal,
Well learned he should be, and of Gods calling,
That should occupy, the place of preaching,
But I am both very unlearned truly,
And also far unmeet, that place to occupye,
You say well (quod he) for ye might, work your self woe,
If ye would attempt, in at the window to go,
Or leap over the shepecote, not called by God,
So might you make, for your own tail a rod,
With almighty God (son) is not good, to play,
For he may not, be dallied with, by no way,
Ye might thereby, he ape Gods vengeance, to you, for your have,
And eternal dampnation, perchance, at the last,
To be a lawier, then (quod he) perchance, is thy desire,
Thereby, thou thynckest, to great riches, to aspire,
Not so (quod I) for some learning, I do lack,
Nor never, of Sophistry, or Lodgike, had the smacke,
By which stands the chiefest, and principal point,
As of that, pleadinge science, the best ioynte,
All things considered, I mind not that art.
Nor ever, hither, could it stand with my heart,
Certaynelye, said he, the law is good, if it be well used,
But now, the justice, of the right law, is somewhat abused,
And many of their risynge, is by extortion.
Whereby, they clinte, to have, of riches, such portion,
And through the same, they almost are grown, to like obliquie,
As the Clergy, at the first fall, were wont to be,
And not without a very urgent cause,
They do, some without right, so writhe, and wrest the laws,
And (son) in my judgment, to be plain,
Much of their law, tends to their own gain.
Well, then I think, ye will beyond the sea go,
Your youth in learning, to occupye so,
For south (quod I) of all the rest I find
That this most pleasinge, to my mind,
If so it were, my living would extend,
There to keep me, two or three years to an end,
Whereby I might, though it were to my pain,
Se countries, and some knowledge obtain,
But he that goes thither, without a good purse,
Goes out of Gods blessinge, into his curse,
It is good for such men, to go over truly,
As entende, the kings embassatours to be,
His graces weighty affairs, there for to do,
But I am not like, to come thereto
The truth for to say, and to be plain.
Since there is so much hasarde, and so small gain,
I am not as yet, minded in this care,
To seek my living, in so far a place,
Therefore (quod the aged man) I agree,
For if ye lack there, ye shall fall in great misery,
And little boteth, you there, to serve any man then,
For they are all, other flawes, or gentle men,
Further (said he) what will thou then apply,
To live in the countreye, by thy land or annuitie,
As perchance thou have, which I do not know,
Tell me, that I may, thee, my best counsel show,
I have not (quod I) much living truly,
But that which I have, lies in the countreye,
Whereupon, I will, if God his help send,
Quietly live, and there my lift end,
Now I perceive (quod he) thine hole entente,
In aringe thee, questions, this time have I spente,
Therefore now I will show thee, in all that I can,
My counsel, how thou may best prove, an honest man,
Say on (quod I) let us no longer time waste,
For since we began, a good way have we paste,
My son (said he) thou semest very wise,
That in this last case, thy self do advise,
First God, and godly things, I will to thee preach,
And after in worldly things, to my power I will thee teach.
THE principallest thing, wherein thou must entende,
Is to have good respect, always to the end,
Wherefore, and why, God thee did create,
And how, he has appointed thee, and in what estate,
For to the end, of thy first creacion,
Direct thy life, in every condition,
Son, God brought thee, into the world here,
For two good causes, as it shall appear,
First, to give him thanckes, laud, honor, and glory,
And evermore, to praise his eternal majesty,
As Well, for that it pleased him, thee to form and make,
And al things earthly, to create for thy sake,
As also, for that, when thou were lost, by Adams gilte,
He would not, of his meare mercy, see thee spilte,
But sent his dear son, from his high troue,
Into this wretched world, to redeem us every one,
Where, he took upon him, our nature frail,
In the blessed virgens womb, for our avail,
And then, here in earth, us thirty years taught,
By his word, and miracles, which he wonderfully wroughte,
And at last, on the cross, suffered his bitter passion,
Only to redeem us, and to obtain clean remission,
Which, his mercy, if it had not been the greater,
We had remained, dampened souls, and no better,
For this cause, we are bound him always to praise,
For from death, sin, and hell, he again, did us raise,
Therefore, him to praise, pray unto, and wurshyp with fear,
This, steadfastly, in thy mind, see that thou bear,
For it is the chiefest point, of virtue, to laud, and know,
The creation, of men, and al things, that grow,
Without this, other virtues, are nothing regarded,
In lacking, this pity, thou shalt be little rewarded,
For this, to all virtues, is thentrye full plain,
Sense, by prayer only, each good thing, of God we obtain.
THE other cause, why God thee hither brought,
Was that thou should, in word, work, and thought,
Always endeavor, thy self to thy power,
His holy commandments, to obaye, every hour,
Which because, I think, thou do sufficientlye know,
It needs not me, to repete them, on a row,
For these two causes, specially, my dear son,
God, into the world, caused thee, to come,
These firm foundacions, fixed, once in thine heart,
Then justice rightlye to embrace, see thou do thy part,
Suffering no man, to sustain, any injury by thee,
Or to hurt any creature, by deed, or word, see thou flee,
And so do, to other men, of each estate, and degree,
As thou would, have all men, should do unto thee,
For this law, of dame Nature, every other law, does excel,
Which, if thou observe not, in every point, well,
Trust me truly (good son) both the Lord, thou shall offend,
And in heaven, have no habitarion, at thy lives end,
Further, any man, for his honor, his goods, or good name,
Beware, thou hate, not by malice, or disdain,
Also be circumspecte, that neither bribes, hate or love,
Thy heart, from equity, and justice, do remove,
For these three things, we see, so blinds many men's sight,
That their judgments, and doings, are contrary, to right,
But thou (my son) remember, that once thou shall die,
And for these deeds, if thou do them, be punished, eternally,
Also, the wicked thirstinge, riches to obtain,
And the ungodly coveting, of silver, gold, and other gain,
Se thou also ertue, for where covetousness, does raygne,
There al kind of wickedness, of force must remain,
Impiety, perjury, rapine, and theuynge,
Fraud, craft, and disceate, with lecherous living,
Quarellynge, and treasons, with murders, and killing,
For lands, treasures, and goods, many men, spillynge,
Finallye, no filthier thing is there, or more detestable I say,
Then a man to be couetouse, by any manner of way,
For whosoever to that vile vice, is once given,
To the blind Mole, I may him well lyken,
Which neither loves, desires, or any way knows,
Any other thing, then in this vain world, grows,
The wretch does not see, how short and how frail,
The life of man is, and how death does us assail,
Daily ready, to strike us, his bow being bente,
With his deadly, doubtful darte, then is to late, to repent,
He another spares, the young, the old, or any degree,
The rich, the learned, or the man in auctorytie,
The Lawer, the Landlorde, or the lacking poor man, yt wepith,
But without any difference, he every man stryketh,
And he is ofterymes nerest us, we daily do see,
When we most, think him, furthest of too be,
But then (my son) these wordlie riches here,
And these vain goods, subject, to blind fortunes power,
Do lytill esteem, nor much for them care,
For these things, are none of thine, whatsoever they are,
Which either, unstable fortune, her pleasure too fulfill,
Does give, grant, and pluck away, at her variable will,
Or which, when thou dyest, will no longer abide,
But to seek them new masters, away soudainly they do slide
There be other goods, which thou ought too acquyze,
And morche better riches, thou should desire,
Which with thee always will remain, and endure,
Of whom neither fortune, nor death, has power be thou sure
These, ought thou too heap up, for the, night and day,
Then, in deed art thou happy, and rich, every way,
As for the rest, which the common people, follow, and magnify,
If thou have them, as lands, goods, catailles, or money,
Lawfully use the same, no man can forbide thee,
But thou ought to use them, with Justice, and modesty,
And also when thou may, pytie the poverty,
And never shut thine ears, at the cry of the nedie,
For who so with compassion, will not hear, the crieng of the poor
Shall cry him self, and not be heard, I am sure,
By releuinge the poor, thou laiest up in stoore,
A treasure, in heaven, to continue evermore,
Which neither canere can corrupt, neither thieves, them co^uaie,
Thus heauely treasure, for worldly trifles, you shall have another day
No man he is, but a Wulfe, that clemencye lacks,
And which, at other men's myserie, no pity takes,
Or that refuses too help, his fellow servant here,
Saying we are all servants, to one Lord, and master,
But of it shall happen the (I say) a poor man too be,
With pacient heart, bear, and sustame, the poverty
For the man, that has much, we always well see,
Is troubled, and tossed, with cares, abundantly,
Also he, to whom fortune, has of goods given stoore,
The hot hastye heat, begins to aswage,
Then after fally, follows, frowning, froward, repentance.
With sorrow, and shame fastnes, bringing great greuaunce,
Therefore busily beware of it, and thy mind so moderate,
That this foul vice, in thy courage, thou dilygently abate,
Patience, is a virtue, of a wonderful strength,
And obtayneth, the victory, of each thing at length,
The which godly gift, who so ever does want,
In him all goodness, and grace, of force, must be scante,
And cruel he must needs he, and also to strife, full prone,
Which is not the nature, of man, but of beasts alone,
The prudent, and good, seeks chiefly for peasse,
And fearing greater mischie^^s, will bear with the less,
Lest, that a little spark, might increase such a flame,
That great peril it were, again, to quench the same,
He that nothing will suffer, nor his way ward wrath refrain,
Must flee, the company, of al men we see plain,
And dwell alone, in the wodes, or mountains on hye,
Where no man, may trouble him, nor he no body,
But he, that will frequent, and dwell amongst men,
Must learn, to suffer, dyspleasures, now and then,
And bridle his furye, dissembling his ire,
And in his secret breast, quench the hot fire,
Nor in any wise may, for every light offense,
Violate the bonds, of peace, and patience,
But as much as he can, forgive other men,
That he offendynge in like case, may be also forgeuen,
Further, Gloton ye to ertue, be ever circumspecte,
Which with diverse diseases, ye mind, and body does infecie,
Besides shortenynge man's life, it consumes his wealth,
Unawarely, as it were, him robbynge by stealth,
For dainties, are dear, and dilicates, be costely,
Swallowing up clean, great riches, quickly,
Some men, very rich, by prodigal superfluity,
Have in short time, devoured their patrimony,
Daily pourynge in their bellyes, both house, goods, and land,
Till pouertye them pincheth, and they a^ brought behande,
I have known, very many, I tell the good son,
That by laciniouse ryotte, have been utterly undone,
Thou must eat (I say) thy life only to sustain,
And not live, to eat, this is most plain,
Ebreite and drunckennes, is also excesses brother,
For in whom, rayneth the one, there is also the other,
This likewise must thou fle, if thou love thy welfare,
Of al other the same, is the most detestable snare,
He that this wicked vice, has once embraced,
All goodness in him, is clearly defaced,
Reason then refuses him, and he is left too his will,
Al sins have free entrance, him then for too spyll,
Good son, I have said many years past,
That great Alerander in his drunckennes commanded in have,
His most dear and familiare friends to be slain,
By whose help and good counsel as it is most plain,
He had the hole world conquered, who being thus dedde,
And sleep had expulsed ebriety out of Alexanders hedde,
He then so lamented their deaths in weeping bytterlye,
That he was ready for very anguyshe to dye presentlye,
Oh fylthy ebrietie, the destroyer of the soul,
Oh norysher of vices, and iniquities all,
What thing is it, but thou forcest man's heart, to fulfill,
Whereby he wareth bold, too attempt all that is ill,
Quarellynge, strife, cruel fraies, thou do move,
Neither, regarding discrecion, honest friendship, or love,
Through the counsel is opened, and secrettis reveled,
The tongue is not then hable, too keep the same closed,
Flee this vice, my son, in all that thou may,
Least it grow, from custom, too nature another day,
The tongue also, thou must learn too moderate,
And be well ware, what thou speak early and late,
Be evermore willing, attentify too hear,
But speak seldom, as need shall require,
Abundance of talk, is a great sign of follye,
And the busye babbler, offends continuallye,
He that seldom talks, and then speaks wyselye,
Is worthy much praise, and approves too be witty,
One principal point, observe in thy communication,
Whether they be present, or absent, we thy words hurt no man,
Nor except it tend too some purpose, speak thou any thing,
Least men laughe the too scorn, for thy babbling,
Rather hold thy peace, and be ever silent,
It hurts not, neither shall it thee repent,
In danger, and perell, he remains evermore,
Experience does teach us, and we see every day,
Some man's lands, and riches, too be their casting away,
It is no new thing, to see this abusion,
That diverse men's wealths, have been their confusion,
Also rich men, are we the burde of their goods so borne down,
That they have no mind, to seek, after the celestial mansion,
For the more, a man desires, riches, and earthly gain,
So much the harder, it is, for him, too heaven to attain,
For look, where a man's treasure is laid,
There is also his heart, it can not be denayed,
Therefore, pouertye, to some persons, is profitable,
Disburdenynge them, of mischeffes innumerable.
FVRTHER, pride, of thee, is to be abhorred no less,
Being of strife, and debate, the mother, and mistress,
By this, the laws, ar neglected, and the commonwealth spylled,
And innumerable people, this vain pride, has killed,
With this pestilence, the famous Rome being once poisoned,
By cyuill war, and oppression, was utterly destroyed,
This monstrous helhound, by always see thou flee,
If thou wylt with almighty God, live eternallye,
For God, in the lowly, and meke, takes delectacion,
And in the humble spirits, glady has his habitacion,
Them also, he favors, that are void of ambicion,
And the proud, swellynge people, he brings to confution,
Therefore ye people, puffed up with pride, what profyteth you,
Your pride, high names, and vain styles, forged new,
Which death, does confound, and brings in subieccion,
Your ambisious tytels, of so great a renown,
Some will perchance say, the common people, we will please,
In coveting of them, therefore to have our praise,
Tell me (I pray you) what is the judgment, of the multitude,
Ye shall perceive many times, they do mock and delude,
Or else speak of affeccion, as some time, namynge them wise,
Which are perchance, very fools, rightly to surmyse,
And though, the ignorant we mock, God can we not deceive,
Nay, he rather derydeth us by our leave,
For he knows our manners, and our deeds, most secret,
And for them worthelye to punyshe us he will not forget,
But many, are so blind, that in their own thought,
They believe, there is no God, and that there remains naught
Of any man, the breathe, being once erpired,
Therefore, the present joys, of this life, they have ever desired,
And do daily wyshe for, deridynge the bliss to come,
Have not they, bestial hearts, under man's shape and form,
We s^ke after riches our pride too maintain,
Our life vanely spending to seek a sinful gain,
We ponder not the frayltye of our wretched state,
Wese not death daily ready, our pride to abate,
We are so contentlesse from most unto least,
That in our vocacion we never can rest,
Well if in worldly things blind fortunes governance,
Ruled not without reason at her own will and pleasaunce,
As we se she does, then all things should be well,
The laws, and justice, should floryshe, and tyranny expel,
But since almighty God, suffers such things to be done.
Who if it pleased him, could amend al right soon,
Why should we grutche, to suffer the same,
To repyne, at Gods will, we are greatly to blame,
Wherefore, wysedom wills wise men, ever to be patient,
And taking al things, as it comes, to be content,
But thou (my son) endeavor thy self, in all that thou can,
Blind fortune to dispyce, and the vain praise of man,
Only study thou daily, by all manner of ways,
With virtuous living, the Lord for to please,
For true honor, and praise, thou can not obtain,
Until after this life, in heaven thou remain,
Which the good, and just, shall enjoy there,
That with humblenes, and meekness, have led their life here,
ALSO, I charge thee, thine anger to suppress,
And the hot rage, of ire, which causes great business,
Wrath, works woe, and much mischief we see,
Furye, makes frayes, and then of necessity,
Follows wide wounds, hurtes and other mayme,
In which bluddy bickeringes, often tyines some men are slain,
For the mind of man, being once, incensed with ire,
Is so blyndely oppressed, with that rash, ragynge fire,
That it neither can behold, or judge any thing a right,
Reason then rules not, and wit has lost his might,
When after once being past, such furiouse rage,
Too have been quiet, and still, but erperience teaches,
That the talkatiue person, often to his pain repents,
FINALLY my son, a another thing there is,
Which I have not to the yet, rehearsed ywys,
That above all the rest, thy life will deface,
If in youth too repress it, thou have not the grace,
That is the wanton desires, of the body frail,
With this thy best age, will violently assail,
The lewd lusts whereof, see that thou flee,
And bridle thou them, before they blind thee,
There is no thing too virtue, so clean contrary,
As is the wicked concupiscence, of the body,
Where virtue too the heavens, strives too assende,
Vile lust, vain pleasures, only does attend,
Lokinge always, as a beast too the earth grouelinge.
The live lie sprites, both of the mind, and body distroyenge,
The devil takes many, with his book and snare,
Like a crafty sore, no travel does he spare,
So he may withhold them, the bliss of heaven too attain,
And after this life, within in hell, too live ever with pain,
These deceates therefore, of Satan thin enemy,
And this detestable poison, covered over with honye,
Warely beware of, as much as thou may,
Least the same repent the, in vain a another day,
When thy ripe years, of discretion, and man's perfect state,
Shall clearlie perceive, all though then to late,
Thy wit, thy substance, members, and good name,
By a lytill wanton pleasure, consumed to remane,
Then shall thou, as many other ar wont too say,
Oh youth, and lustye years, how ar ye vanyshed away,
How evil have I spente you wretch that I am,
Whether are ye gone, oh unfortunate man,
If god of his goodness, would estsones restore,
The joyful ^uentute, I once had before,
If I might once I say the same again ebtaine,
I would then tread, the right pathe, of virtue so plain,
Although the same were, never so narowe a way,
I would therein walk, and continue night and day,
That there is no thing like virtue, I find now full true,
Nor to it, too be compared, this alas often do I rue,
Which ever continues, and always does endure,
Giving to man, such worthy praise, and honor as is sure,
She increases thy riches, and thy life does preserve,
Yea after death, she abiding, away will not swerve,
But I of all other, think my self most unhappy,
Who by flatteringe voluptuousnes, was dereaued wylfullye,
Which slidying away, long since has left me,
Wrapped in all my mischiefs, and woeful miserye,
For I being a young man, the stews did frequente,
And in bancketinge, sleep, and play, my time ydlye spente,
Nothing then would I learn, all study I despised,
Abhorring in good science, to be exercised,
But now therefore (we worth the tyine) I well see,
My self both unlearned, and no less di^^amed to be,
In poverty also, and my whole body bruised,
My wits altogether dulled, and my senses confused,
I have hither to lived, as one who has dreamed,
Him self to be awake, and yet was deceived,
Such things (son) of some men, we are wont for to here,
That are far stricken in age, and to their grave draw nere.
Which calling to remembrance, their lustye years past,
Do now (but to late) bewail their miserye at the last,
Then shuttinge the stable door, when horses there be none,
And now waring wise, when blind Fortune is gone,
Then sekyng a Surgion to heal their rancled sore,
When there is no hope of cure, in the same any more,
My son, therefore take time, while thou may,
For it never retourneth, if it once vanishe away,
Neither waylinge, will help, nor weeping then remedy,
If the body be once stricken, with deaths darte deadlye.
The medicine is profitable, Phicisione do say,
That in time is ministered, not slackyng any day,
Wherefore when thine youth, first to floryshe does begin,
Then thee behooves virtue to embrace, and fle from sin,
Then ought thou to take, the right pathe of living,
To good and honest studyes, thy self holly applyinge,
Then use thou reason, and gouerue by counsel thy mind,
While the same is pliaunte, every way to wind,
Whosoever wylbe wise, let him be wise while he may,
For to be wise a day after the fair, is folyshnes I say,
And therefore he is worthy, his miserye to sustain,
Bewaylinge the loss, yt is never to be recovered again,
NOW touching this world, understand plainelye,
That the same is veary short, and transitory,
And the hole life of man, wherein we do rurine,
In comparison to theternite, of the woride to come,
The truth whereof, to be truly declared,
To one momente of time, is not to be compared,
And touching the myserye, of the world I say,
He is happyer that is gone, then here far away,
For mark I pray the, how infancye comes out,
Of his mothers womb naked, without any cloute,
And the first thing he then does, is wepinge with tears,
Because the misery of this world, as I think he fears,
As I might it lyken, to some merchant man,
Which on some percellous vyage, his way must take than,
And fearing both drowninge, Pirates, and shipwrake,
Trembling, so dangerous a journey to take,
Eurn so, nature teaches, the infaunte plainlye,
That he then enters, into the vale of myserie,
All other beaftes, that nature brings forth,
To their da^mes tytt, run straight with open mouth,
But man, as soon as ever he is borne,
If the mother, clothe, and feed him not, he is forlorn,
After Infauncie, how long it is,
Or perceueraunce crepyth, in that lityll breast of his,
Childhode comes after, wherofneyther of them both,
Can by reason rule them selves, be they lefe or loath,
Then what grefe, travail, fear, and pain,
Suffers the child, or he to iuuentute does attain,
Then ignoraunte fraill youth, begins to arise,
Which leaves reason, and commonly is ruled by vice,
His strength encreasinge, he puts away fear,
Good warninges, and precepts, he will then no more hear,
Then wareth he wild, his young blood being warm,
Given to Ire, and Lusse, which does him much harm,
Good counsel he refuses, and is then rash in all thing,
To the evil enclyned, the good ever ertuinge,
Noperel he doubts, no danger he does refrain,
So that his fraill lust, he may by any mean obtain,
No law he then fears, if there be a toye in his brain,
Few young men in that age, from vice can abstain,
Whom either shame fastness, fear, or wisdom, does constraint,
By no spotte of vice, their youth for to stain,
Then comes man's state, grave and sage,
By erperience, and wisdom, he is taught in this age.
Then unsound are his slepes, he lanboureth with pain,
The living of him self, and his house to sustain,
He gathered together, in that state of life,
In age to keep hun, his famelie and wife,
Only caringe for them all, both to cloth and feed,
Spendinge this his best age, with miserye in deed,
And then wearye rude age, on man fast crepeth,
Stealinge upon him, whether he waketh or sleapeth,
Bringinge many discommodites, both of mind, and body,
His strength takes his leave, his fresh color will not tarry
His senses shrincke away, his sight wareth dime,
His hearing dulleth, and his smellinge leaves hime,
Further he is always vered, with one or other disease,
No meat him then sauourith, al thing him displease,
Without aid of a stafe, his legs him then fale,
His wit is then gone, his body shrincheth, waring pale,
This every age, has his infirmity, we see,
Which of force, we are forced, to suffer parientlie,
Which last age, will not leave him, til he has brought,
Man to his grave, where he consumes to naught,
ILET pass, of all other common perrilles to tell,
With which man is beseged, while he here does dwell,
Wherewith a man's life, is so greatly environed,
That it is seldom, or never, but by some of them devoured,
Now vehemente cold, with I lie snow grieve us,
Then hot burninge heat, to us are molestiouse,
Thertremitie, whereof, as is often seen,
Causes the ground, wide open, some licoure to obtain,
Sometyms we are noyed, by so great wete, and rain,
That it over flows, hole contries we se plain,
Hunger, thirst, and also much penury,
With the wantyng, of necessary things to occupy,
Who can declare, in miter, or in prose,
The great and manysolde, number of those,
Discases, and sickenesses, of every hind,
Which kills daily our bodies, and verith our mind,
By battle, and warfaire, some men are confounded,
In the seas, and other, waters, many men, are drowned,
Other some, by fallinge, catch their bane,
Orels by crushing, their members, are made lame,
Some men, cruel fire, to ashes does consume,
Many ar chocked, and cruel beasts kills some,
What shall I recite, how in earth, the living manne,
Has no greater enemy, then the sede whereof he came,
Of that sede, springs, al thieves, and robers,
All murderers, perjured, and false witness bearers,
Fornicatours also, and vile, adulterers,
And of mankind discende, al wicked doers,
This man with his weapon, another with his tongue me^ do kile,
The most part, by fraud, and deceate, works i will,
O lord, all men, almoost now take delight,
At other men's harms, such is their spite,
The brother, the natural brother, does mistrust,
The amity, of friends, now lies in the dust,
The father, his son, and the husband his wife,
Each suspecte other, here is a goodly life,
Now son, I have told the, as well as I can,
The perels, that do compass, the life of man,
Wherefore thou may not, this worldelie pleasure use
Ercept thou intend, eternell life to refuse,
And the time veary short, that thou here shall remain,
The truth whereof, I can well declare plain,
For all though that I am, now four score year old,
Yet the bedroll of my life, when I do unfold,
I do now well ponder, and perceive in this case,
The same to have been, but a veary litil space,
And yet to live mine age, of a hunderith I know,
One shall thou not find, though thou sought them on a row
Good father said I, I think you say true,
For I have scene veary few, of thage of you,
Now (quod he) I have taught you, sufficiently to know,
First God, your self, and the world, I trow,
And because quietly, your life you would lead,
In the fear, and love, of God, as ye said,
I could wish, you should prudentlie provide,
Of some good stock, a wife with you to abide,
By whom, ye shall, many comodites possess,
More then I can, at this lyme, express,
For your wife, shall leave, both father and mother,
To stick to you only, and to none other,
Her own kindred, and friends does she leave,
Dayelie, duringe her life, to you for to cleave,
By her, shall ye have, fruit of your own sede
Which shall keep you in remeinbraunce, when time ye are deed,
Obedient, she will be, and a surrour always,
And a joyful joy also, to prolonge your days,
Each good thing, shall be common, ever you between,
Your games, shall be one, your lyuinges to sustain
Further, if age, or sickness, shall grieve you hereafter,
She will be a contynuall, and faithful helper,
By assistinge, ministrynge, and watchinge, you also,
Comfortinge, and releuinge you, with the best she can do,
And then your children, which hereafter may florishe,
Will do their endeavor, you gladely to cherishe,
In whom ye shall yet live, when life is gone clean,
And your name still on live, by them shall remane,
Further, to them shall ye leave, your goods being got,
And not unto strange heirs, which ye know not,
Besides this, your wise, with her some what will bring
Toward the maintenance, of your and her living,
Both friends, and kinsefolke, by her will arise,
Which may be to thee profitable, in sondrye wise,
Wherefore, a wife you must have, there is none other nay,
If ye mean quietly, and godly to live another day,
Good father (quod I) me think ye say well,
But of one thing, I would gladly hear tell,
Which way were best, by your consyderacyon,
How I might, have one, of an honest conversation,
Marye young man (quod he) there lies all the matter,
In the wittle wisdom, of him that choseth her,
For I would not have the, therein to be begylde,
As I was once nere, when I was young and wild,
Which if it were not, for lack of time, and space,
Thou should plainelis hear, my solly in this case,
I pray you (quod I) take the pains to declare it,
And for lack of time, and space, do not spare it,
Nay not so (quod he) for we are now, nere the to ye fermers plare
Whith whom I entende, to common a litell space,
Touching, my business, wherefore I hither came,
Which being once finished, if thou will thane,
Bear me company, homward, in the way,
I will declare, all the rest, I have yet to say,
To the which, I answered, that I would veary galdlye
So that he would, dispacth his matters quyckelie.
Here ends the first part.
Anon, we spyed, the fermour, at his gate standinge,
Who as soon, as he, perceived us coming,
Gentillie, saluted us, calling him by his name,
And we did likewise gretchi, with chanckes for the same,
With whom this aged man, having a while walked,
And concerning his errande, hao with him fully talked,
The fermour had us in, where we had good cheer
And tarried the mountenance, of half an boure,
Then took we our leave, of the fermere,
And so straight ways departed, from him there,
And when we were homewarde, a pretty way,
To the said old man, I began thus to say,
Now Sire, and it please you, in your tale to proceed,
I am much desirous, to here the end in deed,
Well said, son (quod he) then give diligente care,
When I was of thage, of two and twenty year,
Veary lusty I was, and pleasant withal,
To singe, dance, and play at the ball,
To run, to wrestle, to cast the axeltre or bar,
Either with hand, or foot, I could cast it as far,
And all other feats, as nunblie do,
As any in the town, Idwelled in thoo
Fine, feate, neat, proper and small,
I was then, though I say it, and fair withal,
Yt appears no less (quod I) for you bear your age sear,
Well, let pass (quod he) such then was my cheer,
And besides all this, I could then fynelie play,
On the harp, mothe better, then now far a way,
By which my minstrelsie, and my fair speech, and sport,
All the maids in the paryshe, to me did reasorte,
Each loved, lusty Jews, for so they me named,
Not one of them all, my company refrayned,
Paryshe clercke I was then, of the town there,
To help the priest to mass, and sing in the quere,
With such living as I had, I lived without care,
Wife nor child had I none, for whom I should spare,
A neighbor there was, a veary honest man,
Dwellinge within the same, our parish than,
Which a daughter had that in beauty did excel,
And as then me thought, above all other bare the bell,
Of mean stature she was, and thereto well made,
Cheerful in contenaunce, and a good favor hade,
A smilinge smoth look, with a wanton Eye.
She was the amiablest damesell, that ever I did set,
A fine congue she also had, and her words could well plate,
And in her communicacion, a veary singular grace,
Modeste, demure, and sad she appeared,
And never thelesse famylier, enough, as the time required,
In her apparel trymme, which was ever more white,
To have seen her on the holy day, was a goodly sight,
So womanly was her pace, in her gesture to and froo,
Upright as a bolte, and like one fleinge did she goo,
This maid was come home, but late from the city,
Where she had served, years two or three,
The first time I saw her, was on a holy day at noone,
Goinge home ward from the church, when service was done,
Whose wanton, well favored fairnes, so caught me,
That earnestlye to love her, lightlye she brought me,
By whom, I was then strycken, with such a veament pange,
That the holy water bucket, from me straight I flange,
And great haste I made, ronning swiftlye after,
Because I would, so gladly overtake her,
At last I ouertooke her, but with moth a do,
Then she me saluted, and I her also,
Her sister went with her, who bad me welcome,
Saying, whether in such haste, good Jews, do you rone.
In faith (quod I) since you desire, to know,
To a neighbors house, who dwells here by low,
The haste that I made, was for your company,
And to know what fair maid, this is truly,
Mary (quod she) she is none other,
But mine own sister borne of father and mother,
And sister Grace (quod she) I pray you, of him acquaintance take,
For with his melody, he does us often, merry make,
I tell you Grace (quod she) he is an honest man,
And on his minion harp, full well play he can,
To the which, this Grace, answered, veary sadlye,
And I would be acquainted, with him veary gladlye,
And this passed forth, they were nere at home,
So then taking my leave, I parted them from,
And this, was the first time, of our gretinge,
Which was to me, anvnhappie metinge,
As ye shall plainly, here after well perceive.
Before the cruelty, of cruel Cupido, did me leave,
Backwarde I went, where my dinner was dighte,
And still by the way, my heart full fore sighere,
When home I was come, to dinner I was set,
My heart was full heavy, no meat could I eat,
After dynner down, on my bed I did lie,
Much musing with my self, what thing it might be,
That so soudanlie had stricken, my heart with soch woo,
And so soon had driven, my mirth, and pleasure, me froo,
No wayr, could my wit, by wisdom deuyse,
How this sadness, and thought, on me should arise,
Except it wear, by beholding the maid,
Whose beauty, and favor, was ever in my head,
To have slept feign I would, but it would not be,
Yet at the last, a short slomber took me,
In which slomber, also my thought I did see,
The damesell, whose fayrenesse, before so perced me
Euensong time came, up then did I rise,
And went to the church, to hear the seruste,
My love, to euensong came not, as I thought that she would,
Therefore was I sorry, my heart was full cold,
At supper, no thing could I eat, then thought I best,
In time convenient, to hye me to my neste,
No rest could I take, my sleep was clean gone,
My heart was full heavy, and cold as a stone,
The morning then came, when gone was the night,
The air was clear, the sun shyned bryghte,
Abroad I then walcked, the birds for to hear,
Where a friend of mine, met me and ared, what cheer,
Truly (quod I) I am now exceeding faints
Yet know I not the cause, which my heart does so taynte,
God a mend you (quod he) and so went his way,
This in miserable case, I passed that day,
And many a day more, till sheringe time came,
Her father shearinge sheep, to his feast had me thane,
Glade was Jews, tho, thinckinge then shall I speak,
At leisure, with my love, and my mind, to her break,
Than shall she know, the woe, and the smarte,
The heauenesse, and sorrow, of my woeful heart,
The resties mghtes, and unquiet days,
The heavy thoughts, which troublith me always,
I will also then, if that Idare,
The botome, of my mind, to her declare,
Then said I sofcely to my self, God lend me,
A conuemente time, and that he will send me,
To obtain at her hands, such favor and grace,
That my humble request, may be heard, and take place,
What need longer process, the sheep shearinge day,
That I so long looked for, at last came I say,
To her fathers house I came, as they were at dinner,
He had me hartelie welcome, and in the best manner,
To the table was I set, down on the benche,
Where I might sede, full in me eyes, on ye welfauored we^che,
Who there served the table, as then was the gyse,
And surely she waited in most wom anlie wise,
Which she well could do, for as I said before,
In the cytic had she been, of good manner to learn store.
Littell meat could I eat, which was noted well than,
By the maids mother, and also by her good man,
What cheer good Jews, tell me she said,
Ye look veary sadly, as one half dismaide,
What man quod she, where is your mirth become,
Me thinckes ye muse, on the man in the moon,
Be merry I pray you, and therewith she me kerued.
But my heart was hollie, on the maid that served,
And afterward, when dinner was done
And the geastes departing, away euerich one,
I also having rendered them, thanckes for my cheer,
Went homeward, with the company, that were going there,
Being both of my purpose, that I came for vnspe^de,
And also wourfe at ease, both in my heart and heavy head,
Then, instamed was my lout, and grew more and more,
Which was but a litel, kendeled before,
The maladye, which before, might in time, have been healed,
Wared now incurable, and that well I fealed,
My harp, which was wont, so swetelie to sound,
Lay now untouched, for me on the ground,
My breast, which before, many solkes, did reiosce,
Began clean to tourue, and horse waxed my voice,
My color, which in times past, so lyuelie did apeare,
Was vaded away, and changed his cheer,
My legs, which were sometime, nymble to dance,
Was shronken clean, by this unhappy chance,
I was near a consumpcion, all strength was gone,
So hollye was I altered, that I was scace known,
At last I considered, the best way to proceed,
If I thought, by her help, to be cured in deed,
Was, that she syrste, understand should,
My woe, and dystresse, and then if she would,
Of pytye, and clemencye, relieve my great pain,
This way, to be the best, I thought sure, and plain,
For Phisirions, do not use, to minister remedy,
Before, they are instructed, in their pacientes maladye,
So it fell, in a morning not long after,
That I chaunfed, to walk, through the common paffure,
Where the milche kyne, of the town, the day time did feed,
And all the maidens, in the paryshe, did milk in that stead,
Amongst whom, Graces sister, was one there,
And therefore, I minded, to banyshe all fear,
And so to make open, and break hollie to her,
The full care, and effect, of all this hole mattier,
But first, certain words, a far of to prove her,
I would cast out, to see, how this care, would move her,
And how she would take it, ere I meant to declare,
And upon the liking, of her answer, not for to spare,
Thus drawing nere, I had her good morrow,
What gentyl Jews (quod she) God keep you from sorrow,
How do you, what wind drive you hither,
This morning so earlye, and I pray you whether,
Are ye thus walking, your self all alone,
I think suerlye, ye have some pretye one,
That causes you, daily, to this place to come,
Well wanton, well, though not all, yet I know some,
Losen Johan (quod I) for so was her name,
In judging amysse, ye are greatly to blame,
For if I for love, reasorte, to any in this place,
It is truly, to you, or to your sister Grace,
For surely, you two, of beauty bear the flower,
This judgment, must I give, though I dye, wein an hour,
No Jews (quod she) then ye judge not well,
For there be maids, a great many that us do excel,
Yet for the gentylnes, I have always sent,
And the honest behauioure, that continually has been,
In you heretofore, I think you worthy to obtain,
As good, and as fair, as any in this paryshe does remain,
Yea, and though she were, mine own dear sister,
I would think her, well bestowed, if ye had her,
I thancke you fair John (quod I) that it does you please,
Unworthily, me so louynglye to praise,
And if God my life, any while will preserve,
Your gentle kyndenes, I trust to deserve,
And therewith, as it were musing, a pretty while I stayed,
What Jews (quod she) me thinks ye are as one dysmaied,
Whereon so study you, a penny for your thought,
In faith quod I, if ye knew it, yet were it worth naught,
My thinckes quod she, ye are changed in every race,
What, has any maid, rauyshed your heart, from his place,
Tell me (she said) and my best counsel ye shall have,
With all that I can do as God my soul save,
Oh (quod I) my heart is wrapte full of woe,
Yet have I no faithful friend, it to show,
I shall tell you Jews (quod she) what so ever ye say,
To me, think it sure, under lock, and kaye,
For ever herynge it, by me spoken again,
Ercepte the same be, for your profit plain,
Well, since ye will needs know quod I my careful myserye,
Ye shall hear the same, in few words plainly,
So it is, that, that sayre swear blossom, your sister Grace,
Has holly, my love, and heart, in such case,
That neither wandrynge, nor walkinge, whether so ever I go,
Neither playinge, nor workynge, what so ever I do,
Neither waking, nor watchynge, any time, or space,
Neither resting, nor slepynge, in any manner place,
But at all times, and evermore continuallye,
Her amiable countenance, restreth in my mind daily,
No pleasure, me pleases, my mirth is amated,
No joys, my delight, my lyfelynesse is abated,
No musycke, me reioyseth, their soundes, are vnswete,
No pastymes, I pass on, as at this time unmeet,
No work, is well wrought, now under my hands,
Nor I am nothing, as I was, before I entered loves bades,
So that I well know, I am like to sustain,
Deaths darte, very shortly, if I do not obtain,
The rather, her love who now has the measure,
Me to slaye or reuyue even at her own pleasure,
Which I would she did shortly for the ease of my pain,
By the darte of cruel death deuorynge me clean,
Now have ye heard all quod I, and more as I say,
Then ever to any other I told before this day,
Wherein I shall desire you to play an honest part,
For the spedy quietynge of my poor wretched heart,
Marie (quod Johan) now I perceive very well,
Of your sadness, and sorrow, there is no meruel,
That has such an Impostome bredynge in your breast,
Which works you wourthely full waywarde rest,
No wonder it is though ye look wan and pale,
For love has made you drink a draught of sower ale,
I took you never so tender, so soon to be caughte,
With the lovely linckes of love which are so quickly wrought,
Ye were wont before this time always to say,
That they were very fools that to love did obaye,
And that it was impossible any wise man to be,
So earnestly set in love in any degree,
But that when he would always, well he might,
Full easelye put the same out of his head quite,
But now ye are caught in the same net,
Which in times past ye greatly did neglecte,
When ye saw any lover, ye laughed him to scorn,
But love has now brought you to scole to learn,
And suerly quod she, to deem in mine intent,
Ye have worthily of love deserved this punishment,
Welquod I, to a man that is falen in mysery and woo,
Good comfort behooves, and not chiding so,
My fault I confcsse, what needs more,
I desire your good counsel for curing of my sore,
Which way I may best by your good advise,
Atcheue this so doubtefull and daungerouse an enterprpse,
Well Jews (quod Johan) now that I knoo,
What woman she is that works you this woo,
Let me alone, I will first move this mattier,
Sone at night in bed, I will earnestly at her,
As ye shall perceive here by this time to morrow,
Other ease or increase of all your hole sorrow,
Therefore in the mean time, be of good cheer,
And I will dilygently work in your cause I swear,
Whereof I thanked her, saying gladlye I would,
Her gentylnes consider, if ever I could,
And having once kissed her, I took my leave thane,
This departinge from her, whom ward I came,
The morrow nerte after, I came estesones to the same place,
To hear if I were like to obtain any grace,
Johan was not then come, I stayed a little while,
At last not far thence I saw her coming over a style,
With her pail in her hand, then I went her to mete,
And gentyllie saluted her, she did like wise me great,
Either death and double sorrow (quod I Johan) do you bring,
Or life to reuyue me which am now dyinge,
Neither of them both (quod she) but hope have I brought,
Thereby partly to feed and relieve your heaupe thought,
Then say on (quod I) and no more time waste,
That happy hope to hear I gladly make haste,
Pester night being both (quod she) in our bed laid,
I turned me toward my sister, and even thus I said,
Oh Johan (quod I) I then wyshed me in your place,
To have declared my self to her my hole case,
Your wyshe was but void (quod she) but hark what I tell,
I ared Grace how she did, and she said very well,
How so ever you do (quod I) lie now at your case,
I know other some are as ill at ease,
Which for you and for your sake to be plain,
Much mysery, myschiefe and care do sustain,
Which greueth me muthe, for since the world began,
God never created a more honester man,
And he is like for your love as far as I can guess,
Shortly to dye, such is his deadlye distress,
For my love (sister Johan) quod Grace to me then,
In this paryshe I am as yet known of very few men,
And fewer do I know, then how may it be,
That any man is vered so for love of me,
Who is it I pray you, once name him to me,
And then if I know him, I will tell you quod she,
Nay sister Grace (quod I) that shall not be,
Before syrste some promise ye make unto me,
That ye shall not at the first kill his heart clean,
By geuyuge him a nay, or by any other mean,
Of unkindness on your behalf, but ye shall if ye can,
Braunte him your love, before an other man,
For I will assure you if ye perfertly knew,
His good gentle behauioure both honest and true,
Which is so pleasant a parson to sing and to dance,
And is skylled in instruments for your pastaunce,
So well can shote, wrestel, and leap so light,
So handesome a man in every man's syghte,
And besides this more sorrow has sustained,
For your sake, and is also so cruelly payned,
That death to him were a great deal sweater,
Then to live as he does he thinks it much better,
And if in your defaulte ye should suffer him to dye,
For lack of your love what prosyte thereby,
Should ye receive, nay rather yt might name you,
A murderer I say which would greatly shame you,
And whom should ye kill no enemy pardye,
But a most true lover who loves you hartelye,
Well (quod my sister) to love him ye shall pardon me,
For I will do nothing in that matter truly,
But this promise to grant to you I am content,
At the first time no nay he shall have I concente,
Therefore tell me his name without any delay,
And then ye shall hear what I will further say,
It is (quod I) Jews the clear he of the townr,
Who for your sake in mysery is tossed up and down,
Why sister Johan than said she unto me,
I thought ye would not of all other sucrlye,
Have moved me to this lyghtnes I say,
But rather have persuaded me if I had been bent that way,
Why Brace (quod I) I mean no dishone stye,
For he would have you to be his wife very gladlye,
So much the more quod she, it is to be borne,
But I tell you now as I told you beforne,
I will as yet, neither love him, nor any other,
By other perswation of sister or brother,
Also ye might well think, me very hasty sister Johan,
If I should be a lover so soon as I came home,
And if he loved me so earnestly as ye have told,
To have moved me him self before this time he would,
But he thought of his desire him self to be sure,
When you to be his broker he first did procure,
And very late it is quod she, therefore fall to your rest,
And herewith meddle no more in earnest or jest,
Not one word more quod Johan, of her get could I,
For to sleep she gave her where she slept by and by,
And thus have I (Jews) for you broken the mattier,
It behooves your self next to attempt her,
And spare not to speak, if ye mind for to speed,
Who trusts to obtain, must put away orede,
But suerly (Tewes) since she now knows that she loved is,
She is not thereof a little proud I wysse,
Alas said I then, I would I were ded,
Then should be at ease, both my heart, and mine head,
Unlucky fortune I may it call,
Which forces me to love one amongst all,
Who neither regards my woofull dystresse,
Neither will coumforte me by any word of kyndnesse,
Well quod Johan, it may be that she will hear,
Your self much better then me a messengere,
And hither to morrow shall she come to milk in my stead,
For I must taly at home to brue and bake bread,
And to speak to her then ye need not my counsel,
For ye are wise enough to tell your own tale,
And in the mean while ye shall be sure,
I will do my best your way to procure,
Thus parted we then withcut words any moo,
I to the church, and she homewarde did goo,
The next morning came which I thought very lenge,
And no marvel, for my pain was so strong,
Then to the common yasture I tymely me hyed.
Where my only hearts lust on mylkynge I spyed,
I mended my pace, and at the last to her came,
I had her good morrow, she said welcome young man,
How do you said I, mine own sweet heart,
Your love has caused me with much sorrow to smarte,
So depely is engraued in me the bewty of your face,
Your pleasant tongue, and behavior mine own love Grace,
The seature, the propernesse of your body fine,
And your lovely countenance has so perced mine yen,
That I am hollye yours, hellye in every condition,
To love you, and serve you, with humble submission,
Abiding your pleasure, and will to sustain,
So long as life within me shall remain,
In consyderacion whereof I desire to obtain,
Nothing but good love, for true love again,
Young man quod she, I am sorry of your woo,
And much more sorye that ye set your mind so,
As to me to bear such love, and good will,
Wherein I fear your time ye shall spyll,
In hoping for a thing ye cannot obtain,
Which at length will bring to you double pain,
And as for me I mean not yet to marye,
I am young enough, I thancke God I can tarry,
And also I will, for ought I yet know,
Years two or three truly to show,
Neither would I, ye should think I do not esteem you,
For truly to judge I can none otherwise deem you,
But for your behauioure, qualities, and honestye,
Ye are worthy to have one much better then I,
Oh bewtyfull Grace (quod I) if Grace will show any grace,
I pray you that it may appear in this my heavy case,
And not to confound me with such a cruel nay,
Neither so mercyles with your words me utterly to slaye,
And suffer not thus pity, and mercy to be banyshed,
From a creature so fair by God, formed, and fashioned,
Neither deny not your name, in any tyine or place,
But according to your name, show me some grace,
Sir (said she) what need longer process to make,
There seems in you follye, such heaviness to take,
For me that am not now to mary dysposed,
Neither to whom before this time your love ye dysclosed,
In deed to you I told it not (said I) but your sister I meued,
Wysedo^e wylleth men to go where they may best be relieved,
I durst not before (quod I) not knowing how ye would take it,
Truly (quod the) eue^ as I do now I would have clean forsake it,
And Jews this follye to leave I could wyshe you still,
By wisdom to be ruled and flee from your will,
Fynallye I desire you to take it for the best,
That I here not your suit, nor grant your request,
Oh Grace (quod I) since it is your pleasure to spysme,
I shall abide your mercy to save me or kill me,
Your hard hearted heart I pray God once to mollefye,
Some compassion to grant me before that I die,
And thus God be with you my love most unkind,
Fare well gentle Jews (quod she) God alter your mind,
And send you to put away this sanry quietlye,
Which has brought you in this woeful myserye,
Thus away went I then half in despair,
My heart greatly vexed between hope and fear,
Within two days after I met with her sister Johan,
To whom I showed and made my heavy moan,
Declarynge to her all the words that were,
Between me and my love Grace her sister,
Well quod Johan I wyshe that this next night,
With your harp ye hold your way to our house right,
And there underneath our chamber wyndowe,
In singing and playinge let her hear what ye can do,
Your melody may cause her stobbourne hard heart,
To love you parchaunce, it may her so convert,
And this may ye easelye do without any ylle,
For of both our parents ye have the good will,
And thus geuynge Johan thanks for her counsel so good,
Home ward I hyed me, in haste by the roode,
My harp for to tune, and some ditie to make,
The which I might sing and play for her sake,
The night at last came, and when the clock had run nine,
Thither I went with my harp as I thought it was time,
For as thesomer season required twilight it was thane,
When to her fathers house that I came,
A bed were they all, no sturrvnge herd I,
My harp out of his case I plucked by and by,
And struck up suddenly a very pretye round,
Which my harp then new stringed meryllye did so unde,
Another dance or two, I then also played,
Which being once fynyshed, I suddenly stayed,
And this ballet hereaster I began for to sing,
My harp hare the note, which merely did ring,
Oh my love Grace,
Your bewtyfull face,
Has perced so my breff,
Your countenance mylde,
With your tongue so well fylde,
Is causer of all mine unrest,
Not Troylus of Troy,
By Cresside hysioye,
In love was ever so set on sire,
Neither Piramus the young,
By the love of Thisby so strong
Or burnte in such hot desire,
Neither Hercules the mighty,
By Dianiras bewtye,
Was at any time so overcome,
Neither Sampson the strong,
With love was so wrong,
Of Dallida the wicked woman
Neither that woeful Dido,
Eneas loved so,
As I do now love you heartily.
For in good faith,
Yt will be my death,
Except yt extend your mercy,
And when this ballet was fully ended,
My comfort was never the more amended
For no answer at all would she to me say,
Yet without any whit playinge a while did I stay,
At last her father bad me good night,
So did her mother and her sister full right,
And gave my hearty thanks for that my pain,
But no farewell of Grace could I obtain,
Then home strayghte I went full sadlye again,
Where I languished all that night, in terrphle pain,
And thus continued by the space of a month,
And then one of our neighbors to me straighte comes,
And of his own good will unmoved there,
Offered to me his only daughter and heir,
Which in good land after him should spend,
Five marks by the year until her lives end,
And the damesell was also indifferente fair,
And sure a good huswyfe as after did appear,
After thanks for his good will, I then to him said,
My mind he should know upon the syghte of the maid,
What will ye more, she lyked me well,
And was contented to take me whereby it fell,
That shortly after married we were,
And have louyngely lived hitherto together,
And have nere run out our course as ye shall likewise do,
If God grant you space to live thereunto,
Suerly it appears quod I, ye have a good memory,
Which can the time of your youth declare so perfectlye,
And for this your long tale now I thancke you good father,
But for your love Grace whose chance was to have her,
Mart quod he afterward within less then a year,
She took a serving man against her friends will there,
Between whom was nothing but chiding and strife,
Brawling and fighting all her long lyse,
And beggars both they became at the last,
She was an ill huswyfe, and he spente as fast,
So that they were compelled within years one or two,
Wandering a beggynge both for to goo,
Which grieved me much when their myserie I knew,
And then somewhat I relieved them for mine old love true,
THIS have I told thee (my son) for this entente,
Because thy follye hereafter thou myghtest preuente,
And not to love one before her manners thou do know,
But first know her, then love her, and so it will grow,
To berve good purpose, end, and effect,
And all other vain hastye lour se thou neglecte,
And when thou meanest a wife for to choose,
My counsel in this case se that thou use,
First her mothers manners learn if thou can,
And her fathers also whether he be an honest man,
For commonly the children them selves do enclyne,
To their parents conditions as straight as a line,
Further inquire of the neighbors dwelling there about,
Of what honesty she is by the voice of the route,
Or if there be any honest woman dwelling nere,
Send her closely thither, her both to se and hear,
Whether she be fair, and of body clean,
Or diseasyde or sickly by any manner of mean,
For (son) no man will bye horse, ox, cow, or calfe,
But he will first be full sure they shall be sound and safe,
Much more circumspecte a man ought to be in choice of his wyfs,
With whom he must live all the days of his life,
Who if she be unclean or infected with any kind of disease,
All thy children of nature shall have the same sickness,
Also cause the same woman dilygentlye to know,
If she be folyshe neither can spynne nor sow,
For in these things I say each woman that is chaste,
Will exercise her self, and no time ydellye waste,
For ydelnesse is the norysher of vices all,
And the same causes the mind in much myschiefe to fall,
This idleness many welthy fair cities decays,
Fysthye lust, also ydelnes ever follows,
If either chaste Pennellope or fair Lucresse,
Had spente their time syttinge at home in ydelnesse,
And not given them selves to weuynge, and spynnynge,
In their husbands absence from the beginning,
Of a thousand woars which daily to them came,
They should suerly have concented to some one man,
But touching the search of her life and modesty,
These things thy self may much better espy,
For all people now are waren so unjust,
That few shall thou find whom thou may trust,
Yt is now the manner of many to deteaue and lie,
Few are there to be found of credit worthy,
Therefore if thou wylt have thy purpose take effect,
It be houeth the therein to be careful and circumspecte,
And son, herein lies all your marrynge and making,
If ye be not warelye wise in your wife taking,
Considering no small time ye together shall remain,
But even till death shall separate the lives of you twain,
In all other cases rashenes, and have is but follye,
But in this matter may it bring intolerable myserye,
Therefore this choice of thy wife first ponder wittelye,
That thou repent not hereafter when it is past al remedy,
But if it happen the as it does to many other moo,
That thy wife thou shall mary perchance be a Shrewe,
First gentlye warn her, and with loving speech,
Do thy best her to chasten, and mildely her teach,
And often her favor by fair means to obtain,
Enbrace her with kysses to reconcyle her again,
Thus by gentylnesse if thou can do thy best her to tame,
Which if it will not her in nowyse reclayme,
Then sharper medecines thou must put in ure,
By threats, fear, and chiding to bring her to thy lure,
Which if she regard not nor stand yet in awe,
The last help of all is that strokes must then follow,
Now concerning the conseruacion of thy wyfes chastitye,
I will not much speak in that matter truly,
But this may I say, and I dare undertake,
That often a wise man an honest woman does make,
I could herein tell thee more, but I will not now,
For I leave the same hollye to the discrecion of you,
Yet to learn this one lesson, I would have the (good son,)
Never let thy fancy or desire after any other to run,
But in wedlock be to her as faithful and true,
As the Turtel which never will chafige her make for a new,
For there is no one thing thy wife will take more greuouslye,
Nor any other thing vereth her spirits so vehemently,
Nor of nothing desires she so soon to be revenged,
As in that one point if her husband have offended,
Then wareth she hot incensyd with ire,
With dispyte and malice then her heart is on fire,
In which their furiouse rage some seek the way than,
In like sort (if they may) to deceive their good man,
Believe me (son) sewe of them will keep their honesty,
If their husbands in such wise do live abroad visiouslye,
Further thy children hereafter see thou up bring,
In virtuous excercyse and also good learning,
Teach them to fear God and the to obaye,
And ever keep them in obedience as much as thou may,
For they will ever wax bold as need shall require,
But not always so humble as thou would desire,
Therefore while they are young and tender of years,
Is both their help, and undoing, as it often apperes,
Much pains must thou take in godly instructynge them,
If thou purpose they shall ever prove honest men,
Lause them al euel company to exchue continually,
For just he cannot be that is conuersaunte with the ungodly,
One sheep hauyngs a peryllouse pocke,
Of force must enfecte all the hole flock,
Thy daughters always with shamefastnes vprere,
For it is the fairest flower all women can were,
Let them never be idle but always doing,
With the whele, the distafe, or with the nedle sowynge,
For the welfare of this sex stands in their honestye,
Which when they are idle, is then in most ieoperdye,
And at their ripe years do it not over slide,
Some honest husbands for them to provide,
Be not bitter (good son) to thy servants at any time,
Neither punyshe them with rigor for every crime,
There is a mean to be observed in correccion I say,
By which thou may cause them thee both to love and obaye,
And although fortune has poynted the their master to be,
He might likewise have made a servant of the,
And what hereafter may fall no man knows his chance,
For the hole state of man's life depends in ballaunce,
I have known diverse men, both rich and welthye,
That afterward have fallen in such myserye,
That full feign they have been to avoid vile beggerye,
By service to live in great callamitie,
What we are and have been we know, but what after we shall be,
We are ignoraunte thereof such is our vncertayntye,
In thy first keeping of hduse be not to sumptuouse,
Neither in food nor apparel to laciuiouse,
For at thy pleasure thou may the same always amend,
When God abundance of substance hereafter shall send,
But it would be to thy shame, if thou should aslake,
The first honnest port thou did upon the take,
Often call home thy neighbors, but most such as are poor,
To dyne and suppe with the, let some of them be sure,
The Lord thy table shall bless the more,
And for such liberallitie he will increase thy store,
Go not to law with them, nor be no extoretoner,
Finyshe their causes if thou may, and be no bearer,
In no man's mattier but in all that thou caune,
Set quietness and concord between man and man,
But in wranglinge matters be in no wise no medler,
Which might get the an ill name, and no man the better,
Further if thou find a man of an approved honestye,
That fears God, and is given to good virtues hollye,
Of whom most men sayewell, for his good living,
That is no drunckarde, quarrelloure, nor delyteth in striuig,
But quiet sober, and learned in sapience,
Being of good judgment, and also of good experience,
This man's frendshyp seek buselye to obtain,
For then a faith full friend there is no greater gain,
But er thou his amity earnistlie embrace,
Learn how he has used his other friends in like cate,
For such as his behauioure has been to other more,
Trust me (son) he wylorder the even so,
And when thou once haste him thy friend unfeignedly,
Then seek to continue in frendshyp dillygentlye,
Let no light, dyspleasure, the same break or decay,
But bear with him rather in all that thou may,
Of all treasure the chefest that God does in earth send,
Is a man to have always a sure and steadfast friend,
Furthermore if sycknesse shall vere the or thine,
Se thou minister remedy to the same betyme,
Or ever the same do augment and increase,
The sooner shall it mende, and the grefe be the less,
For like as fire when it is first begone,
With a lyttel water wylbe quenched full soon,
But if it be suffered to continue stylle,
And a while to burn even at his own will,
Then the flame wylbe raised in such a great rage,
That hole wells and conduictes can scace it aswage,
Even so every malladye at the first entrance,
May be easily cured without great greuaunce,
This first point of phisycke learn thou of me,
If the sycknes be hot, cold, or moist, ye remedy must be contrary,
If over much labor, and travail be the cause,
Then by ease, and rest from the same, thou must pause,
And if the same come by over much ease and rest,
Then exercise and moderate labor is best,
If it be by superfluitye of drink or meat,
Then abstmence is the best remedy thou can get,
And if need require a physician then call,
Or a surgion, but good diet is the best lieche of all,
The surgion is nerte, for phisicions do kill,
The most part that put their trust them until,
For where by hap some one they do save,
A hundred for him they send to their grave,
ALSO my son this last precepte thou must learn,
Which dilygently to observe I the earnistlye warn,
Be prepared always, and evermore full redye,
Death to enbrace where he strikes soudenlye,
Yea even in his most Lust and welthiest time,
Let the remembrance of him be still before thine yene,
He assaulteth men commonly when they think of him lest,
Fearcelye inuadynge them in their most quietness and rest,
He draws ever nexer with his inevitable darte,
Daily percynge every age of man to the heart,
How often does death strike the young lustye man,
And beryeueth him of his best years we se now and than,
Oh how great are the trauayles and pain,
That a man in this life with pain does sustain,
How short is our time and the same also so varyable,
That nothing in this life can be found stable,
With what innumerable pylles are we beseged,
Which by this our frail nature can never be resyted,
What we our vain pleasures wherein we so trust,
Even poisoned with galle and cankered with ruste,
What are we owretches but duste of the air,
As bryttell as glass seem it never so fair,
Most like to a shadow in a sonnye day,
Which when the clouds are alost suddenly vanyshe a way,
Like as a flower which florisheth in the morning dew,
And at night is withered and has vaded his hew,
For though we are now alive, and lustye in every man's sight,
Fair, amiable, pleasant, full of courage and might,
Yet perchance er Ppheabus has once his course run,
Dead carcasses we may be and vile meat for the worm,
What prosyteth us then our great sommes of monye,
Heaped together by extorcion and bryberye,
Gold, stones, Jewels, or implement most preciouse,
Lands, houses, or vyllages, be they never so sumptuous,
Either worship honor, or lordely authority,
Rule or dominion or worldely dignity,
Which makes many men so proudely to look over all,
As though they were to the gods coequall,
Saying death ends althynge, and we wretches with mysery,
Like duste and shadow consume so suddenly,
Semge all our pride and glory is so sone extinguyshed,
And our time so quickly gone never to be recovered.
O life so vain so fugitive and frail,
Whom such a number of dangers and persilles do assaslle.
O life that art so short, and uncertain,
Most like unto smoke, a man can the licken,
Now this man dies an other after him,
I to day perchance, and thou to morrow betyme,
So a lyttel, and a little, each man does dye,
Even like a butcher having sheep and bestes many,
Of which some to day he kylleth down right,
And other some to morrow in the morning, or at night,
The nerte day other moo go to the block,
And so forth till consumed be all the hole flock,
Thus death daily remember but fear not the same,
For of it self it is good and worthy no blame,
Death fynysheth all pains, death ends all care,
Death dangers dissolueth, and puts away fear,
To the poor, to the prisonner, and to the comfortless,
To the condemned, and to the miserable captyue in dissresse,
To the bondeman, slave, spoiled, and Lazar impotente,
To them that are on the rack, and in greuouse tormente,
Death is embraced and heartily welcome,
To such and many other of like state and condition,
To good men, death never can come unware,
Which ever against his coming them selves do prepare.
Whose life has continued in righteousness,
And which have remained in faith, mercy, and godliness,
To them no dysproffit is death but advantage,
Although it take them in their most flouryshynge age,
Thus if thou be good receive death gladlye,
For it is a passing out of this vale of myserye,
Then shalt thou render to the earth and again to her send,
Thy body which but for a time she did unto the lend,
And if thou ponder with thy self in thy mind discretlye,
What damage or hurt can death do unto the,
She spoilleth the of thy riches perchance thou wylt say,
But then riches want thou none by no kind of way,
Nor any other thing else thy soul shall desire,
But from poverty to riches thou then semest to aspire,
For he of all other is the richeste in deed,
Nor that has most but that fewest things does need,
To leave thy wise, childerne and friends, is a miserable thing,
Yea, but it were much more miserable to se the^ die the^ living,
And it will not be long but they shall follow the,
When the lord shall also call for them accordinglye,
And these worldly riches and pleasures are none of thine,
But lent to the as it wear for a little time,
Naked came thou hither and naked must thou hence go,
Therefore for terrestrial trifles sorrow not so,
This world is as it were a certain great feast,
Where unto every man is bidden as a geaste,
Where for a while duringe the Lords pleasure,
We have the fruition of this vain worldly treasure,
Upon this condition that we be always ready,
At his commandment to give place and depart gladlye,
And to suffer other men that after us shall come,
Of the same feast to receive like fruition,
What wight will not willinglye leave this lothesome life,
Which is so wicked disceatfull and so full of strife,
Where no faith, no piety, nor any justice,
Remains neither any quietness or peace,
Where all kind of Sins evermore do reign,
Where the brother is commonly the brothers bayne,
Where the son often wishes for his fathers short life,
The woman her husband, and the husband his wife,
Whereche body catheth and snatcheth what he can,
Being dissemblers and wourkers of fraud every man,
That this world may wourthelye well be named,
A den of thieves being with pillinge and polling enflamed,
Of lust and boredome what should I make mention,
Wherewith the hole earth is filled with like abhominacion,
That chastifie is banyshed and virgynitie defaced,
And ye honorable sacreme^t of Matrimony nothing regarded
In which wicked world also are of parels so many,
Of labors and sickness such a nombre and sondery,
Where fortune only rules without all reason,
Where no man of him self can be assured any season,
What good man will not now leave this world gladly,
Which is hollye compassed with such intolerable mysery,
Wherefore great follye it is death for to fear,
Saying it ends the myseries we sustain here,
And consider also that departing from mortallitie,
By death thou enterest into thy region of eternity,
Therefore my son let thy life be godly,
So shalt thou not stand in any fear to dye,
First in thy health, hollye set in good stay,
By will, al thy worldly affairs as nere as thou may,
That in thy sickness thou be not with them troubled,
Nor thy mind then from godliness by them encombred,
And every night before thou go to thy rest,
To confess to God thy sins with hearty repentance is best,
And humblye ask mercy with hope vnsaynedly,
Preparynge thy self then holly to dye,
And so thy soul to the Lord most humblye betake,
Which on the cross suffered his passion for thy sake,
Thus shall not soden death unprovided the find,
If thou bear well this last lesson in thy mind,
This my rude counsel if thou follow in every condition,
As I trust thou wylt according to mine expectacion,
Thou shall well walk in the right pathe way than,
Which as I erste said leads to the life of an honest man,
And now son my former promise being performed and done,
To the place where we met we are nere eftesones come,
I thancke you gentle father said I for your wholesome counsel,
I never herd told a more verteouse tale,
I beseech almighty God to grant me the grace,
The same to observe in every point and case,
And the same Lord of his goodness reward you gratiouslye,
That has taken such pains to enstructe me verteouslye,
Fare well my good son quod he Christ be thy guide,
And so departing from him home ward I hyed,
FINIS.
