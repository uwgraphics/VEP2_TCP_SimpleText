In every realm to be as king Roma. xiii.

And to be had in Reverence
And with fer more prehemine^ce
During his natural curse and life Sapi. vi Tim, iii. i. Pet. ii..i. petr. ii.

Above ye man ye child and wife
To be dred, seruit, and obeyit
And as their master to be weyit
it is this King, bot constitute
Under God, as ane Substitute
To minister, and cause ministrat be
Justice, to all, with equity
Another to spair, for lufe, nor feed
To do dew Justice, to the deed Deu. xvii

Elyke boith to the rich, and pure
And so, till every Creature
Without respect, till any wycht
Should kings give every man their rycht
Prouidyng that his Justice be
Graciously myxit with mercy Pro xxvii

Exempyll taking of all kyngis king
Quhais mercy passith, every thing
No geir sulde do, the faltour bye
And kings should heir, the pure man's cry Deu. xvii

And help them rather in distres
Nor them that hes, the great riches
To ponysche Uice, and treit virtew
This is ane Prencis office dew.
Hov kyngis hes no erthlie Permanence.
THEIR kings yai ar, bot kings of bane.
And schort will heir yare time be gane
And schorte is heir, their Joy I say
Job. xiiii
And ever schorter day, be day
Rycht as the sand hour in the glass
Elykewyse dois, their time heir pass
They have no surenes heir to bide
Bot ever sure, that they mon siyde.

For doutles throuch diuisioun

And without Charity, and Peace

Their is no Realm, that can have grace
And kings sall give ane count tharefore
In presens of the king of glore.
At this ilke count, quhat salbe said
To them, and to their chargis laid
It salbe said, vndouttitlie
Give they haif rewlit rychteuslie Mathei. xxv.

Nothing at all, to ^^kin rycht

And he them boith, did make of claye
Quhare to, they mon return sum day
Quhat give they boith to heuin ascend
Quhare their is Joy withouttin end
Sall this great king, be set more hie

Bot I trow, as they boith deseruit
They sall elykewyse, their be seruit

Till hell, quhare their is pain but end
As God forbid, that any do
That ever he pat life in to
Give that their any places be
More creuell than vthers, in degree
Sapi. vi.
Their sall it be, the kyngis dwelling
With gretyng, raryng, and with zellyng
Because, the king had in his handis
The rewle, of hunders, and thousandis
Quhome that he sufferit, in his dayis
To tyne, and perysche. money wayis
And the vile Catyue, naikit, and pure
Had of him self, bot only cure.

And our successioun they sall be

And geuin to uncouth Natioun

In grace, peace, and cherytie
And also give e do pretend

Follouis the instructioun to Prencis. How they sall alsweil Inhereit the

ATTEND O Prencis, and tak tent.
Unto this Doctrine Subsequent
And thareto wyselie do aduert
And prent the famyn, in our heart

In the quhilk Law, e may vpbryng

Throw quhilk Law, also they may leir

And do ow homage, and reverence i. Tim. ii.

With all detfull Obedience
For they that are, ane faithles clan
Can another dreid God, king, nor man
Quhare faith is nocht, no grace can be
Bot Myscheif, woe, and myserie
And quhare faith is, their is all grace
Their is prosperity, lufe and peace

The Liegis, of the ungodly king
In daily trubbyll, they sall ryng
For they tak another thocht nor cure
But reuth, for to oppress the pure
They have nocht God, before their Ee
Bot seruis, their Sensualytie
And swa that realm, is never at rest
Bot still the pure, ar sore oppressed.
Thus without kings, Ygroundit be
In Goddis wourd, of verytie
Their Liegis also, godly men
Doand gods wourd, parfytlie ken
And but true precheours, I make plain
All Realms sall, underly great pain
And sall nocht mys, the scurge and rod
Off the hie puissant, and mychtie god.
Also (I say) unto ow Kyngis.

Rycht dulefullie, withouttin dreid
Nocht only e, bot als our seid
And haistelie, or ever e know

Boith with the sweird, the fire, and pest
I make it to ow manifest
Set e nocht forth, Godds wourd on hycht
And make it cum, unto the lycht
Give e Endure, unto our fine

For God sall steir vpe Nationis

Thocht to defend ow, e wald prea^^,
e sall have another hearts, nor grace
Eccept with godds wourd, e be armit
And it into, our herts confermit
Itt should nocht be hid, nor obscurit
It should nocht be throung down nor smurit
Itt should nocht wreistit be, nor wryit
Nor unto profane things applyit
Itt should be precheit, to all dois seik it
Itt another should be paird, nor ekit
Saif Scripture, with Scripture, e expone
Conform unto, the trewtwiche stone Apoc. xxii

Quhilk is the auld, and new Testament
Quhilk should be taucht, most deligent
Be faithful Pastors, that preche can
But feir of any erthlie man
They should nocht be, abasit to preche
Nor for no kind of favor fleche
Bot trewlie they should do their cure
But feir, of any creature
Woe be to them, that dois know
Godds wourd, syne dois the contrar schaw Hebru. x.

In Pulpet, or in preching place
Speking, aganis godds wourd of grace
Better to them, have been unborn
They ar the people, that are forlorn
Quhilk another sall be heir nor hyne
Remittit, for their falls Doctrine.
Preis never, O Prencis in our cure
No way, for to oppress the pure
Be nocht gredie, nor Couatus
Be Liberal, good and gracious
Eccle. xxxii. Deu. xvii Romans xii.
Be humyll meik, and pacient
And to do Justice diligent
Help them, that help of ow requyris
Conform unto their Just desyris
Be nocht ouir facill for to trow
Quhill that e try, the matter throw
Preis euir to win, our Liegis hartis
Rather than Conqueis gold in cartis
Have e their herts, I say express
Than all is ours, that they possess
Than neid e nocht, no time nor ceasone
Be ferit for falset, or for treasone
Than cau e, be no manner want
Gold, thocht our pose, were never sa skant
And gredie Prencis, dowtleslie

For oftymes, it is cleirly kend
Wrang Conquest, maks myscheuous end
At schorte e daily do aduert
To serve our God, with faithful heart.

For to Instruct, the christin flok
And with exempyll, of their life

But horse, or mule, upon their feit

Bot thocht they ride, on mulis, or horse

This Judge is blind, and may nocht se
For he wants God, before his Ee
He knawis nocht god, nor it his saw

In Court in Parliament or Cessioun
