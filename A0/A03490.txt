The Imperial Laws and Constitutions, set down in the Golden Bull, or
Letters Patents of CHARLES the fourth, Emperor of Rome, for the Election of
Emperors. (*)
In the Name of the most holy, inseparable and glorious Trinity. Amen.
CHARLES the fourth, by the Divine grace of God, Emperor of Rome, semper
Augustus, and King of Bohemia; for a perpetual memory to all Posterity,
Sends greeting. Every kingdom divided in it self, shall be mad esolate;
for the Princes thereof are become fellows with thieves: therefore the Lord
sends the spirit of Blindness amongst them, that at noone day they grope
about as if they were in darkness; and remoueth their Candlestick out of their
place, that they should be blind leaders of the blind, and they that walk in
darkness offend, and are deceived, and being blind, commit wickedness, and
fall into division. Tell me Pride, how did thou reign in Lucifer, but by
the means and aid of Dissension? Say envious Satan, how did thou cast Adam
out of Paradise terrestrial, but by making him to disobey God? Speak Lust,
how did thou destroy Troy, but by causing Helena to forsake her husband? Say
Wrath, how did thou destroy the commonwealth of Rome, but by mouiug Julius
Caesar and Pompey to civil and intestine war? Thou Envy, like a crafty
Serpent, creeping into the Christian Empire (which by the power of the holy and
inseparable Trinity is grounded on the Theological virtues of Faith, Hope, and
Charity) and whose foundation is happily established upon the most Christian
Kingdom of God, by pouring thy ancient and most impious venime amongst the
imperial branches, and nearest members of the same, (that the Pillars thereof
being shaken, the whole building might fall to the ground) oftentimes have set
ungodly division among the seven Electors of the Empire, by whom (as by seven
Candlestickes, shining in the unity of a seuen-fold Spirit) the holy Empire
should be illuminated.

Therefore, by virtue of our office, which by the Imperial Crown we hold, to
prevent the dangers of future divisions and dissentions among the Electors,
whereof (as being King of Bohemia) we acknowledge our self to be one, by a
double reason, as well of our Imperial Command, as by our right of Election,
which we execute, among other Laws prescribed for the nourishing and
maintaining of correspondencie among the Electors, and thereby to induce them
unto an unity of Election, and a detestation of the aforesaid division, and
to stop the passage unto diverse perils thereby ensuing at an Imperial
assembly, holden in our Court at Norembergh, in the presence of all the Princes
Electors, Spiritual and Temporal, and of a great number of other Princes,
Earls, Barons, Knights, Gentlemen, and Burgesses of the Cities and Towns of
our Empire, sitting in our Throne, apparelled in our Imperial Robes, and
Crown upon our head, with mature deliberation, and by imperial power,
ordain, declare, and establish, etc. In the year of our LORD GOD 1356. in the
ninth Indiction, and the fourth Ides of January, and of our reign the tenth of
Bohemia, and the first of our EMPIRE.

In what manner the Electors are to be conducted to the Election, and by whom.
WE ordain, and by this our present Imperial Edict, perpetually to be
observed, command, of our mere motion and free Imperial power, that as
often, and whenever, in time to come, upon necessity, or the cause of
Election of the King of Romans to be Emperor, it shall happen and fall out,
that the Princes Electors, according to the ancient and laudable custom for
the said Election, are to travel, and set forward on their journey, every
Prince Elector shall (upon request made by the said Electors) be bound to
conduct and accompany his co-Electors, when they are for that cause to travel,
through their territories, lands and jurisdictions; and further also, as
necessity requires, and without refusal, convey them to the City or place
where such Election is to be made and celebrated, and also at their return
from thence, upon pain of perjury, and loss (for that time only) of his or
their voice, which he or they is, or are, to have in the said Election.

Which said penalties, to him or them, that shall show themselves rebellious,
obstinate, or negligent, in the said conduction, we our selves will judge and
impose.

We further ordain and command all other Princes, Feodaries, and belonging
to the Imperial Jurisdiction, by what name soever they are called, Dukes,
Earls, Barons, Knights, and their Retainers, Gentlemen and others, Burgesses
and Officers of Castles, Cities and places whatsoever of the sacred Empire,
that at such time as the King of the Romans is to be elected Emperor, upon
request unto them made by the Princes Electours, or any of them, for
conduction, either of themselves, or their Deputies, which they shall appoint,
as aforesaid, without any denial, to conduct and guide them through their
territories, lands and possessions, and further, as need shall require. And
that if they shall presume or refuse not to do as we herein ordain and
appoint, they shall be liable to the pains and penalties hereafter following,
viz. All Princes, Earls, Barons, Knights, Nobles and Gentlemen, doing the
contrary, shall incur the pain of guiltiness of perjury, and deprivation
of all liberties and immunities whatsoever they hold and enjoy by Imperial
right, or otherwise; as also of all other their offices and functions: And all
Burgesses, and Commons of Cities and Towns, that presume to do the contrary,
are likewise guilty of perjury, and shall be deprived of all the Rights,
Liberties, Privileges, and Immunities, which by Imperial liberty and grant
they hold and have obtained; which together with their bodies and goods shall
escheate and fall into the Emperors hands; and further, ipso facto, be
deprived of all Law and Right whatsoever; so that from thence-forth, it shall
be lawful for every private man, of his own authority, without lawful
proceedings, or aid of Magistrates, freely to assail, and set upon them, not
once incurring any penalty, pain, or punishment whatsoever, by Imperial
authority, or otherwise, for the same, they being so convinced for
disobedience against the Commonwealth, and the sacred state and dignity of the
Empire, as also against their own honors and credits, and found to have
rashly neglected their duties, and done as rebels, disobedient subjects, and
perjured persons against the Decree aforesaid. Decreeing further, and
commanding, That the Citizens and Inhabitants of all Towns and places where the
said Princes Electors, and either, or any of them, as also their Deputies, or
their servants shall lodge or rest themselves, in their journey toward, or in
the place of the Election aforesaid, to sell, and cause their victuals to be
sold at the common rate and price accustomed, without inhauncing, or
extraordinarily raising the price of the same, unto them and their retinue, for
their necessary provision; as also in their departure or returning home from
thence again. And whosoever shall do the contrary, we will that they shall
incur the same penalties that are formerly set down against Citizens and
others, for disobedience in the cases aforesaid. Further, if any of the
Princes, Earls, Barons, Knights, Gentlemen, Burgesses, and Inhabitants of
Towns and Cities whatsoever, shall offer to presume maliciously to wrong or
do any injury openly or privily, by any means whatsoever, unto the Princes
Electors in the way or otherwise, as they travel to the place where the King
of the Romans is to be elected, or in their return from thence again; or
shall presume to assail or trouble them, or any of them, personally, or any of
their Deputies aforesaid, traveling to and from the said place, whether they
shall demand conduction, or not, such person or persons, together with their
adherents and accomplices, shall presently thereupon incur the pains and
punishments aforesaid, every man according to his state, quality, and
condition, as aforesaid. And if any of the Princes Electors shall fall out or
have any particular quarrel, contention, or controversy, one with or against
the other, notwithstanding the same, they shall be bound to convey and conduct
one the other, or their Deputies by them appointed for the said Election, to
the place of Election, and back again as aforesaid, upon pain of incurring
the dishonor of perjury, and the loss (for that time only) of their voice
in the Election, as aforesaid. And if any other Princes, Earls, Barons,
Knights, Gentlemen, Citizens, or Commons of Towns whatsoever, shall have any
particular quarrel with, or bear any evil will or envy unto, the Princes
Electors in general, or any of them in particular; or if that there shall
suddenly arise any quarrel, contention, or war between them;
nevertheless, all controversies and contentions set apart, they shall conduct
the said Prince, or Princes Electors, or his or their Deputies, appointed to
go to the said Election, in their journey both forward and backward, as they
will shun and avoid the pains and penalties aforesaid, by us set down to
be inflicted upon them that shall do the contrary, wherein we our selves will
be Judges, etc.

For the better and further establishing and confirming of all the premises, we
will and command, That every and all the Princes Electors, and the rest of the
Earls, Barons, Knights, Gentlemen, Cities, Towns, and Inhabitants thereof,
shall, by their oaths, set down in writing, under their hands, promise and
bind themselves, to observe, fulfill, and keep all the premises, in every
point faithfully and truly, according to the tenor thereof: And whosoever
shall deny or refuse to do the same, shall forthwith incur the pains and
punishments, that are formerly inflicted upon every man, according to his or
their estate and degree.

If any Prince Elector, or any other Prince, of what estate or condition soever
he be, feodarie to the Empire, Earls, Barons or Knights, or any of their
heirs and successors, shall not hold, perform, and observe our aforesaid and
ensuing constitutions and laws, or presume to contrary the same, if the said
Prince Elector continue therein, then the rest of the Electors shall from
thence forward exclude him out of their company, and he shall be excluded from
his voice of Election, and place of Elector among the rest of the Electors;
neither shall he enjoy his feodarie preferments which he usually had in the
Empire: And all other Princes and Noble men aforesaid, committing the like
offense against our said laws, likewise, shall not enjoy their feodary rights,
by the Empire given and granted unto them; and yet nevertheless, they shall
incur the danger of all the pains and penalties aforesaid, personally
concerning them, according to their degrees and qualities, ordained and
appointed. And although all and every one of the Princes, Earls, Barons,
Knights, Gentlemen, Cities, Towns, and Burgesses of the same, are bound to
conduct and accompany every or any one of the said Electors or their deputies
as aforesaid; nevertheless, we think it convenient to ordain and appoint
several and fit conductors and conductions through the Countries, Towns, and
Territories near or nearest adjoining unto them, as hereafter more at large
appears.

First, the King of Bohemia, chief BVTLER, or Cup Bearer of the Empire, shall
be conducted by the Archbishop of Mentz, the Bishop of Bamburge, and
Wirtzenburgh, the Burgesses of Wremburgh, Hohenloe, Werthen, Brunecke, and
Hanow, the towns of Noremburgh, Rotenburgh, and Wyndeshem.

The Archbishop of Collen, Chancellor for the Empire in Italy, shall be
conducted by the Archbishop of Mentz and Tried, the County Palatine of the
Rhine, the Lantgraue of Hessen, the Earls of Katsenellenboghen, Nassaw, Dyetz,
Isenburgh, Westerburgh, Runkell, Limburgh, and Valkenstein, the cities of
Wetflaria, Beylenhuysen, and Fredebergh.

The Archbishop of Treuers, Chancellor for the Empire in France, and the
Kingdom of Arles, shall be conducted by the Archbishop of Mentz, the Earls
Palatine of the Rhine, Spanheim and Veltentz, the Rhingraues of Wildegrauen,
Nassaw, Isenburgh, Westerburgh, Runkell, Limburgh, Dyetz, Katsenellenboghen,
Eppenstein, and Valkenstein, and the City of Mentz.

The county Palatine of the Rhine, chief SEVVER of the Empire, shall be
conducted by the Archbishop of Mentz.

The Duke of Saxon, Marshall of the Empire, shall be conducted by the King of
Bohemia, the Archbishops of Mentz, and Madeburgh, the Bishop of Banburgh, and
Wirtzenburgh, the Marquis of Misnia, the Lantgraue of Hessen, the Abbots of
Fulden and Herffelden, the Burgraues of Noremburgh, Hohenloe, Wirthen,
Brunecke, Hanow, and Valkenstein, the Cities of Erford, Wulenhuysen,
Noremburgh, Rotenburgh, and Wyndelsthem.

And all these last named shall conduct the Margraue of Brandenburgh, chief
Chamberlain of the Empire.

Also we will, and expressly ordain, that every one of the Princes Electors
that shall desire any such conduction, shall certify those that shall so by
him be required, in such convenient time, and withal signify unto them what
way he intends to ride, that they that shall be thereunto required, may have
sufficient time to prepare themselves of all things necessary for the same.

These ordinances aforesaid, concerning this conduction, our meaning is shall
in such sort be understood, that every one above named, or others not named,
that shall be required to conduct the said Electors, shall be bound to prepare
themselves willingly and readily to do it, not only through their own Lands
and Territories, but further also, if need require, upon pain of the
penalties aforesaid set down.

We further appoint and ordain, that the Archbishop of Mentz, that for the
time shall be, shall by express messengers in writing signify unto every one
of the Princes his fellow Co-electors, both spiritual and temporal, the said
Election, in which his Letters he shall specify with as much speed as those
Letters can conveniently come unto their hands, the day on which within three
months next after ensuing in the said letters contained, all the said Electors,
are to be at Franckford upon Maine, either in person or by his or their lawful
deputies thereunto appointed, with full power and authority under their hands
and seals, to elect the King of the Romans to be Emperor. In what manner and
form such Letters shall be made, and perpetually penned, and in what manner
and form also the said Princes Electors shall authorize their deputies in that
case of Election by them so appointed to be done, at the end of this book you
shall find it set down, and more plainly expressed, which form so set
down, by our imperial power and authority we do command in that manner to
be observed.

And whenever it shall happen, that the death of the Emperor, or of the King
of the Romans, is known in the Diocese of Mentz, then within a month from
the day of the notice of the same, justly accounted, our will and pleasure is,
that the said Archbishop shall by his Letters signify the same unto every one
of the Princes Electors, in manner as aforesaid; which if the said Archbishop
shall neglect or carelessly put off, then the said Princes Electors shall of
themselves, without calling or warning (in performance of their oaths and
alleagiance to the Empire) at the end of three months aforesaid, as in the
former institution is declared, repair to the said town of Franckford, there
to proceed to the Election of the King of the Romans to be Emperor.

And every Prince Elector, or his deputy, shall enter into the said town of
Franckford at the said Election, with a train of, not above two hundred
horsemen, and not more, whereof fifty of them only, and not above, shall be
armed.

And every Prince Elector, that is called and summoned to the said Election,
not coming thereunto, nor yet sending his lawful deputy, with his Letters
Patents under his hand and seal, with full power and authority to elect the
King of the Romans to be Emperor, or if after, the said Prince, or the said
deputy, shall go from the said place of election, the King of the Romans not
being elected to be Emperor, nor his said deputy fully authorized, he shall
lose his voice which he ought to have in such election.

We also charge, command and enjoin the citizens of Franckford to defend and
protect all the said Princes Electors in general, and every one of them in
particular, from all invasions or tumults that may happen among them, upon any
particular dislike, and also from all other men that may attempt any thing
against them, and likewise their servants and followers, which they or any of
them shall bring, to the number of two hundred aforesaid, into the said City;
and they shall take their corporal oaths upon the holy Evangelists, for
performance thereof, upon pain of incurring the danger of Perjury, together
with the loss of all their Rights, Liberties, Privileges and Immunities,
which by Imperial authority they hold and enjoy, and to fall into the danger
of outlarie, both in body and goods: and in that case it shall be lawful for
every man, at his or their own liberties, without orderly proceeding, to
invade and assault them and every one of them, when they will, and at all
times, (being thereby deprived of all Law, as traitors and Rebels to the
Empire,) without any punishment to be inflicted on them for the same, neither
within nor without the Empire. The said citizens of Frankford also, during all
the time of the said Election, shall not suffer any man, of what estate or
condition soever he be, in any sort to enter into the said Town, (the Princes
Electors themselves, and their deputies aforesaid excepted) who are every one
of them to enter with two hundred horsemen, as aforesaid: And if after they
are entered with their trains aforesaid, or in their presence, any man be found
to be there, contrary to our decree; the said Citizens presently and with all
speed shall take order for his speedy departure out of the City, without
stay, upon pain of incurring the penalties aforesaid to be laid upon them, or
else of the breach of their oaths, which they are to take upon the holy
Evangelists for the performance of this our decree, as it is formerly expressed
and declared.

Touching the Election of the King of the Romans.
AS soon as the said Electors or their deputies are entered into the said City
of Franckford, the next day in the morning, in the Church of Saint Bartholomew,
they shall cause the Mass of the holy Spirit to be sung before them, to the
end that the said holy Spirit might open their hearts, and illuminate their
minds, to choose and elect a good, upright and a fit person to be King of the
Roman, and Emperor, and for the advancement of the Christian faith: And
after the said Mass, all the Electors, or their deputies, shall approach unto
the Alter on which the said Mass was celebrated, where the spiritual Princes
Electors, standing together with the temporal, the Gospel of Saint John,
(beginning, In principio erat verbum,) shall be laid open before them, the
spiritual Princes reverently laying their hands upon their breasts, and the
secular Princes laying their hands upon the book, in the presence of all their
company, who then are to be there shall take their oath, which oath the
Archbishop of Mentz shall give unto them, and shall openly pronounce the same
in this manner.

J Archbishop of Mentz HIGH-CHANCELOR of the sacred EMPIRE in Germany, and
Prince Elector, swear to this holy Gospel now laid before me, that upon the
alleagiance which I owe to God and to the Empire of Rome, I will with all my
heart and best endeavor by Gods help, choose a temporal head for the people
of Christendom that is, a King of the Romans to be Emperor, such an one as
shall be fit and capable for the place, according to my alleagiance aforesaid,
and my voice, and the voices of the Electors, without any fraud, or other
sinister and particular dealing, by me therein to be used, so help me God and
all his holy Saints.

This oath in this manner being taken by the said Electors, or their deputies,
according to their said oath, they shall proceed to the Election, and shall not
in any manner depart out of the said City of Franckford, before that the
greater sort of them shall have chosen a temporal head or governor of the
world, or of Christendom, a King of Romans, to be Emperor; which if they
shall prolong or defer the space of thirty days from the day of taking their
oaths, then the said thirty days being expired, they shall eat nothing but
bread and water, nor by any means go away from the said City, until or
before they or the greater number of them shall have chosen the ruler or
temporal head of Christendom, as aforesaid. And after that in the same place,
they or the greater part of them shall have made their Election, the same shall
be as lawful and good, as if it had been made by the voice and consent of
them altogether, without gaynsaying, and so shall be celebrated. And if it
shall happen that any of the Electors, or their deputies aforesaid, shall stay
longer from coming to Franckford to the Election, then the time appointed; yet
if he or they shall come thither before the said Election i^ made, we ordain
and decree that he or they shall nevertheless be admitted to the said
Election, as well as if they had come thither at the first day and time
aforesaid, which in the same manner we will and command to be continually and
perpetually observed. We also ordain, and by our imperial power and
authority command, that he, who in manner aforesaid shall be chosen to be
King of Romans, the Election being made, before he shall do any thing, or
proceed to the ordering of any affairs whatsoever, touching the Empire, by
virtue of his place and dignity of King of Romans, he shall by his Letters
Patents confirm all the privileges, rights, liberties, graunts, ancient
customs, and dignities unto the Princes Electors both Spiritual and
Temporal, which are known and reputed to be the principallest members of the
Empire, and whatsoever else they shall have obtained and enjoyed in the Empire
until the day of the Election; and when he shall be crowned Emperor, he
shall ratefie and confirm the same unto all the Electors in general, and
every one of them in particular, without any denial or contradiction
whatsoever. And in case whereas three Princes Electors, present, or their
deputies in their absence, shall together choose one of the Princes Electors,
either present or absent, to be King of Romans; the voice of him that is
Elected, (if he be present, or his deputy in his absence,) shall be of
sufficient power and means to increase the greater number of the Election, and
to make the same as effectual, and of as good force, as if it had been made
by all the Electors together.

The manner how the Spiritual Princes Electors shall sit by the Emper^ur, when
he is set in his Imperial Throne.
In the name of the holy and inseparable Trinity. Amen.
CHarles the fourth, by the divine grace of God, Emperor of Rome, Semper
Augustus, and King of Bohemia; in perpetual memory, and for the glory and
grace of the holy Empire, the honor of the Emperor, and for an order
hereafter to be prescribed to the commonwealth, to the end that the most
reverent and illustrious Princes Electors, may be maintained in peace and unity
of mind, who as principal pillars, circumspectly, prudently, wisely, and
holily, sustain, support and uphold the sacred edifice of the Empire, and
whose assistances and aids strengthen and corroborate the right hand of the
imperial power; and how much the more by mutual favor and ample dignity
they are united together, so much the more peace and tranquillity and commodity
the people of Christendom thereby obtain and enjoy: therefore that among the
venerable Archbishops and Prelates of Mentz, Collen, and Tryer, Princes
Electors of the sacred Empire, all dissension, suspicion, and contention
touching Superiority, or sitting in counsel, in the imperial Courts, and
resorts, that may arise or grow hereafter, may be cut off and ceased, and that
they being peaceable and quiet in mind may the better and freelyer consider of
the important affairs of the Empire, and with one will, and consent, and
unity, meditate thereon, for the consolation and comfort of the christian
people: By the counsel and deliberation of all the Princes Electors, both
spiritual and temporal, we Decree, and by our imperial power and authority
ordain, this Order and Law, perpetually to be observed, that the aforesaid
reverent Archbishop of Tryer, shall sit opposite right before the Emperors
face. The Archbishop of Mentz, in his own Diocese and Provinces, and also
out of his Provinces in all his Chancelours regiment throughout Germany, the
Province of Collen only excepted: And the Archbishop of Collen in his Diocese
and Provinces, and out of his Provinces throughout all Italy, may, shall, and
ought to sit on the right hand of the Emperor of Rome, in all public acts,
Imperial Judgments, Assemblies, Feodarie Courts, Feasts, Counsels, and all
other actions, which may happen and fall out for the service and honor of the
Empire: which mutual order aforesaid, of sitting, so appointed for them, we
ordain and command to be observed and kept among the said Archbishops of
Collen, Tryer, and Mentz, and their Successors for ever, that hereafter no
contention or distaste may, for the same, grow and breed among them.

Touching all the Electors sitting in the Emperors presence.
We further ordain, That whenever the Emperor shall hold his Imperial
Court of Parliament, in every Session, as well in Counsel, as in Parliament,
and at meat, or any other place whatsoever, where the Emperor and the King of
Romans shall happen to sit with the Princes Electors, next after the
Archbishops of Mentz, or Collen, which of them, at that time, in regard of the
quality of their places, or variety of Provinces, and his other Privileges,
shall be set down on the right hand of the Emperor, the King of Bohemia,
being an anointed and a crowned Prince, shall sit next unto him; the Earl
Palatine of the Rheine, shall have the next place on the left side of the
Emperor, after, one of the Archbishops aforesaid, whose chance it shall be
then to sit on the left side of the Emperor. Then the Duke of Saxon; and after
him the Margraue of Brandenburgh, shall sit down: But, when, and as often as
the Emperors shall be dead, then the Archbishop of Mentz shall have power, as
it is formerly set down, by Letters, to summon all the Princes aforesaid, to
come together for the election; who being all, or as many of them as can or
will come, within the time of election, assembled, the said Archbishop of
Mentz, and none other, shall ask every one of his fellow Electors, their voice
in the election, as follows: First, the Archbishop of Tryer, whom we ordain
to speak first, and to whom we find that it has still belonged: Then the
Archbishop of Collen, to whom it belongs to crown the King of Romans: The
third, the King of Bohemia, who amongst the Temporal Electors, in regard of
his Royal dignity, is the chief of them: The fourth, the Earl Palatine of
the Rheine: The fifth, the Duke of Saxon: and the sixth, the Margraue of
Brandenburgh: who sitting orderly, the Archbishop of Mentz, shall ask every
one of them, whom they will choose, or give their consent unto.

Further, in the celebration of the Imperial Offices, the Margraue of
Brandenburgh shall hold the Basin, whilst the Emperor or King of Romans
wash his or their hands: Next, the King of Bohemia shall bear the Kings cup to
drink, which, by reason of his regal Crown, and according to the privilege
of his kingdom, unless he will voluntarily do it, he is not bound to do:
The Earl Palatine of the Rheine, shall serve in the first dish; and the Duke
of Saxon, shall exercise the place of Marshall, as he has anciently used to
do.

The Privileges of the Earl PALATINE of the Rheine, and the Duke of Saxon.
AS often as the Empire shall happen to be void, the illustrious Earl Palatine
of the Rheine, chief Sewer of the Empire, in place of the future King of
Romans, by right and privilege of his Earldom, ought to be Oner-seer in
the territories of the Rheine, Sweuia, and Franconia, for the Emperor; with
power of exercising Justice, presentation of Ecclesiastical Benefices,
receiving Rents and Reuenews, and in the name of the Empire, to take the oaths
of fidelity and feoffments; which nevertheless, after the King of Romans is
elected, shall all be reiterated, and they shall again renew their oaths
unto him, the oaths of the Princes, and of those that are called Vanlehen
excepted, which we specially reserve for the Emperor himself, or the King of
Romans: but all kinds of Alienations, or Obligations of Imperial things, are
excluded out of his power. The like power of Ouer-seer, we give and appoint
unto the illustrious Prince the Duke of Saxon, as Marshal of the Empire, in
those places where the Jurisdiction of Saxon extend, in like manner and form
as aforesaid: and although in the interim that the Emperor or King of
Romans are to be elected, Justice shall be done by the Earl Palatine, as
chief Sewer, and Prince Elector; yet the County Palatine shall not execute the
said Judgment in any other place, then openly in the Emperors Court, where
the Emperor himself, or the King of Romans, if they were present, should do
it.

How the Princes Electors shall take place before other Princes and Noble men
of the Empire.
We further ordain, That whenever, and as often as the Emperor shall
summon a Court of Parliament; the Princes Electors aforesaid, both Spiritual
and Temporal, according to the order prescribed, shall sit on the right and
left hands of the Emperor, and so hold their places, and no other Prince, of
what degree, state, or condition soever he be, in any place within the said
Court, in going, sitting, or standing, shall be preferred before them. And this
is specially to be observed, and noted, that the King of Bohemia, at the
celebration of the said Court of Parliament, in all and every the actions
aforesaid, (what other King, Prince, or Princes, of what estate soever he or
they be, that may upon any occasion be present therein,) shall have the
pre-eminence and preferment of sitting before him or them.

Touching the Succession of the Temporal Princes, Electors.
AMong the innumerable cares wherewith we are busied for the maintenance of
the happy state of the Empire, by the aid and help of God, our heart and
mind daily labors to this end, that a desired and wholesome union may
always be had and maintained, with sincerity of heart, among the Princes
Electors of the Empire, whose providence, in time, will so much the sooner and
easelier appear, and take effect, when no error shall arise among them, and
thereby Charity better observed, difficulty prevented, and right and equity
given to every man. It is generally, manifestly, and publicly known to all
men, far and near, that the illustrious Princes, the King of Bohemia, the
County Palatine of the Rheine, the Duke of Saxon, and the Margraue of
Brandenburgh, by virtue of his Kingdom, and their Principalities, in the
election of the King of Romans to be Emperor, with the rest of the Spiritual
Princes their Co-electors, by right have their Places and Voices, and together
with them, to choose them, as true and lawful Electors of the Empire: lest
that among the said Temporal Princes sons, in time to come, there may grow
or arise any trouble, dissension or contention, touching the right, voice and
power of election aforesaid, and thereby to prevent all future impediments,
lets, and hindrances therein, desiring (by Gods help) carefully and wisely to
stay and stop all dangers, We ordain, and by our Imperial authority command,
this present Law perpetually to be observed and kept; That whenever the said
temporal Princes, Electors, or any of them shall leave their right, voice, and
power of election aforesaid, the same shall justly, lawfully and freely escheat
and fall to the eldest son and heir of him or them, being a Temporal
person, without any contradiction whatsoever: And if the said eldest son,
shall die without lawful temporal heirs male, by virtue of this our
Imperial Edict, the right, voice, and power aforesaid, shall fall to the next
brother, being a Temporal person, rightly descending from his father; and
after him, to his eldest son, being a Temporal Prince: And such succession
from the eldest sons and heirs of the said Princes, in the right, voice, and
power aforesaid of election, shall from time to time perpetually be observed;
with this condition and clause nevertheless, That if the said Prince Elector,
or his eldest son, being a Temporal person, shall die, and leave his heirs
male, being Temporal persons, at the time of his decease, under age, then the
next brother to the said eldest son, shall be tutor, and administrator of the
said children, until the eldest of them shall attain to lawful years: whom
we do ordain and appoint to be Elector, at the age of eighteen years, and
at that time, the said right, power, and voice, and other appendances thereof,
shall escheate unto him: and then the said administrator shall resign the said
office and rights aforesaid wholly unto him. And if any of the said Princes
houses shall happen to fail, and be extinguished, for want of heirs male;
then the Emperor or King of Romans, for the time being, shall and may take
order therein, and provide an other Elector, as an escheate lawfully fallen to
him and the Emperor, always excepting the privileges, rights, and customs
of our Kingdom of Bohemia, touching the election of their King, in case of
vacation, by the Subjects thereof, that have right and authority to elect
their King: Observing their privileges, and ancient customs continually used,
and by diverse Emperors of Rome, or Kings, granted unto them, which by this
our Decree we will by no means break nor infringe, but rather confirm the
same, from hence forward, to be and remain in as full power and effect as
heretofore they have been, and so for ever to continue.

Of the immunities and privileges of the Kings of Bohemia, and the Subjects
thereof.
WHereas by two illustrious Emperors of Rome, and Kings of Bohemia, our
Progenitors and Predecessors, it was given and granted unto the said Kingdom
and Crown, and at this present, in the said Kingdom, from time out of mind,
is and has been a laudable custom and law without any contradiction, and
mis-construction, used among them, that no Prince, Baron, Knight, Gentleman,
retainers to Nobles, Burgesses, Citizens, nor any other person or persons of
the said Kingdom, or their adherents, of what estate, dignity, pre-eminence,
or condition soever they be, at any man's suite or summons whatsoever, shall be
called, cited, warned, or summoned to appear before any Judge, or Judgment
Seat, Court of Law or Justice whatsoever, out of the Realm of Bohemia, and
the Courts of law and equity therein holden, which time out of mind, has so
been holden and used among them: We therefore, to renew and confirm the same
Privilege, custom and indulgence, granted them by Imperial authority
aforesaid, of our special grace, and by our Imperial authority, do ordain,
That if any Prince, Baron, Nobleman, Knight, Gentleman, retainers to Nobles,
Burgesses, Citizens, Peasants, or any other person or persons of the said
Realm and Kingdom, shall be summoned, warned, or adjoined to appear or
answer to and before any Judge, Judgment Seat, Court of Law, or Justice,
out of the Realm and Kingdom of Bohemia aforesaid, either for any criminal,
civil, or any other cause or action whatsoever, and at any time or times what
or wheresoever, they are not in any manner or sort bound to appear or answer
to the same; and if that, for not appearing or answering, at, or before any
such incompetent Judge or Judgment Seat, or whatsoever authorities out of the
Realm of Bohemia aforesaid, their adverse parties shall in such manner proceed
against them, and that Sentence definitive, or execution thereupon, shall be
given and pronounced in any cause whatsoever in those Courts against them, by
foreign authority as aforesaid: We ordain, appoint, and judge the said
Citations, summons, precepts, processes, sentences and executions thereupon
ensewing, and all things, which by the same, or any of those means, shall, or
may follow, be done, and attempted, in that manner against them, to be utterly
void, disannulled, and of no force nor effect. Further adding, and expressly
ordering, by our said Imperial authority, for ever to be held, That
although in the said Realm of Bohemia, (time out of mind) the same has
always been observed, if from hence forth any Prince, Baron, Nobleman,
Knight, or retainer to Nobles, Citizens, Burgesses, Peasants, or any Subjects
of the Realm of Bohemia, of what estate, pre-eminence, dignity, or condition
soever he be, in any process, sentence definitive, precepts of the King of
Bohemia, or any of their Judgments and executions thereof, made, pronounced
and executed against them in Judgment, either before the King, or the
tribunal Seats of judgment in the said realm, thereunto commonly appointed,
shall appeal to any other Judge or Judgment seat out of the realm of
Bohemia, whosoever he be that shall do so, and if the party Defendant does
not resist nor gainsay the Plaintiff, both the Defendant and Plaintiff, in
that case, shall incur the danger of loosing their suite.

Of Gold, Silver, and other kinds of Metals.
THis present statute we ordain for ever to be observed, and thereby declare
that our successors, Kings of Bohemia, as also all and every one of the Princes
Electors, both spiritual and temporal, which for the time perpetually shall
be, shall lawfully have, hold, enjoy, and possess all Mines of such Gold,
Silver, Tin, Copper, Iron, Lead, and other kinds of Metals, and also of
Salt already found, or hereafter to be found, as at any time heretofore were
within the said Realm of Bohemia, or the territories thereof: And likewise,
that the said Princes Electors, in the provinces, parts, lands, in particular
dominions, and territories to them or any of them appertaining, shall lawfully
possess and hold and enjoy the same, together with all rights whatsoever,
(none excepted) whereby they might, may, and were wont to hold and possess
the same, as also to take lawful towles and customs, heretofore given and
granted unto them for the same, and which our Progenitors, Kings of Bohemia,
and the said Princes Electors, and their Predecessors and Progenitors lawfully
might claim, until this time, according to the ancient, laudable, and
approved custom at this day, and long time before, used and observed.

Touching Money.
WE also ordain, that the King of Bohemia our successor, that for the time
shall be, as it appears, that the illustrious Kings of Bohemia our
predecessors, were wont to have and peaceably used in former times, shall have
the use, liberty, and custom of Coining, Making, and uttering of Money
stamped, in Gold and Silver, in all places and parts of the said Realm, or
territories thereof, where the said King shall be pleased to Coin, and make
the same, in what sort, fashion, and stamp soever they will, as until this
time, it has been, and shall perpetually be used. And further, we give unto
the Kings of Bohemia, by this our imperial Constitution, liberty to authorize
the Princes, Nobles, Earls and other persons of the said Realm, to buy Lands,
Castles, Possessions, goods and Morgages, whatsoever or wheresoever in the
Empire, or to receive and take them of gift by any manner or means
whatsoever, according to the tenor of the said Lands, Castles, Possessions,
Morgages, or goods accustomed; so that Freehold, may be bought for Freehold,
Coppy-hold as coppy-hold, Feodarie as Feodarie, and shall in such sort be
holden, that whatsoever the Kings of Bohemia shall buy or receive, and shall be
applied to the use and benefit of the said Realm, shall continue to yield and
pay the accustomed and ordained quit-rents and tallages due from them unto the
Empire. This present constitution, grace and favor of our Imperial Majesty,
so granted to the Realm of Bohemia, we also give and grant unto all the
Princes Electors, as well spiritual and temporal, as also to their lawful
heirs and successors, in all points as it is formerly declared.

The Immunities and privileges, of the Princes Electors.
We ordain and decree also, that no Earls, Barons, Nobles, feodarie
Vassailes, Knights, Citizens, Burgesses, nor any other person subject to the
Ecclesiastical Jurisdictions of Mentz, Tryer and Collen, of what state,
condition, or dignity soever they be, shall not upon occasion, or by any
procurement whatsoever, be cited or summoned to appear, without the
Territories, Bounds and Limits of the said Churches, and the appurtenances
thereof, before any other Tribunal seat or place of Justice or Judgment,
then only in the liberties and jurisdiction of Mentz, Tryer and Collen, and
before the Judges thereof, in time to come, nor hereafter, according to the
custom of the said churches in times past observed. And that if contrary to
this our present Edict, the subjects of the Churches of Mentz, Tryer, and
Collen, or any of them, upon any occasion whatsoever, shall chance to be cited
or summoned to appear before any tribunal seat, for any criminal, civil,
or other cause or business out of the limits and territories of the said
Churches, or any of them, they shall not be bound to appear, nor in any sort
to answer thereunto, as also that the Citations, Processes, and Sentences,
diffinitiues, or otherwise, against them begun, for not appearing before such
foreign Judges, or hereafter to be made and pronounced, as also the precepts
and executions of the same, and all things which from them, or any of them, or
by that means shall or may be done and attempted, are and shall be void and of
none effect; expressly commanding, that no Earl, Baron, feodarie Vassal,
Knights, Citizens, Burgesses, Peasants, nor any other person, subjects to the
said Churches, or their inhabitants, of what estate, condition, or dignity
soever they be, shall appeal from the processes, sentences definitive or
other, and precepts of the said Archbishops, and their Churches, or the
executions thereof made and pronounced, or to be made and pronounced against
them, in the Arch-Bishopricke or their Consistories and tribunal seats, as
long as they are not denied Law and Justice in the Arch-Bishoprickes, nor their
Consistories aforesaid; and that such appeals in that sort made, shall not be
received, accepted, nor allowed, but to the contrary, shall be void, and of
none effect. But for want of Justice, they and every one of them may
immediately appeal from them to the imperial Court and tribunal seat of the
Emperor, and not to any other Court whatsoever, either ordinary or
extraordinary; and that whatsoever, shall be done, contrary to the premises,
we pronounce it to be void and of none effect. The same Law, Order, and
Statute by virtue of this our Imperial Decree, the illustrious Duke of
Palatine of the Rheine, the Duke of Saxon, and the Marquis of Brandenburgh,
temporal Princes Electors, and their heirs, successors, and subjects, shall
also hold and enjoy, in manner and form as aforesaid.

Touching the assembling or meeting of the Princes Electors.
AMong many other cares, wherewith we are daily busied, it seems much to
import our greatness and sublimitie, that the Princes Electors of the sacred
Empire, should often meet and assemble together, to sit about and consult upon
the affairs of the Empire, and the good of Christendom in general: Which
sound pillars and steadfast and immovable supporters of the Empire, as they are
a great way distant one from another, on the other side, meeting in counsel,
they may consult upon the defects of the Countries and Territories about them,
by coming and conferring together, and by their wholesome and sound counsels
apply good remedies thereunto: And to that end, we have ordained our general
meeting in Noremburgh, with the Venerable, Ecclesiastical, and Illustrious
temporal Princes Electors, and many other Princes and Nobles of the Empire,
there, with good deliberation, and their counsel and advise, for the common
good of the Empire, to consult with the said Princes Electors, ecclesiastical
and temporal. It is further by us thought good, that the said Princes
Electors, from henceforth, every year once after the feast of the Resurrection
of our Savior Jesus Christ, commonly called Easter, for the space of four
weeks together, shall meet and assemble in some one of our imperial Cities,
and at the same time to come or ensew in the next year, the same meeting or
counsel to be holden by us and the said Princes in our imperial City of
Vianna in Austria; and then at that place by our said Counsel, it shall be
determined upon the place where we shall meet again the next year, for the
same purpose; this our order to hold no longer then we and our Counsel shall be
pleased to continue it: and during the assemblies aforesaid, we will defend
and protect them by our imperial conduction, both coming to, staying, and
departing from thence. Further, lest the furtherance of the common good and
peace of the Empire, might by too much solacing, or excessive frequenting of
banquets be delayed, and put off, as many times it falls out, and happens
to be so; we have agreed, that from henceforth, while this meeting aforesaid
shall hold, it shall not be lawful to call and assemble any general Court of
all the Princes of the Empire together, in any other place; particular
assemblies and expeditions moderately assembled, only excepted.

Privileges.
We further ordain, and set down for a perpetual imperial Law, that all
Privileges, and letters pattents of any person or persons, of what estate,
pre-eminence or dignity soever he or they be, or of any Cities. Towns or
Universities, etc. whereby any rights, graces, immunities, customs, or any
other things, either by us or otherwise by the Emperors and Kings our
predecessors, in any manner or form of words has unto them been granted, or
that are to be granted, by us or our successors, Emperors and kings, in time
to come, neither shall, may, nor ought at all to derogate and contrary the
liberties, jurisdictions, rights, honors, and dominions of the Princes
Electors, temporal, ecclesiastical, or of any of them in particular,
notwithstanding, that in such privileges, and Letters pattents, made to any
person of what estate, dignity, or quallitie soever they be, as aforesaid, or
to any University, it be or shall be expressly set down therein, that they shall
be irreuocable. If the said privileges and immunities be not found any ways
to derogate or contrary the privileges, liberties, jurisdictions, rights,
honors and dominions, as aforesaid, of the said Princes Electors or any of
them; if otherwise we censure them to be reuocable, and to be disanulled; and
by these presents, understand, repute, and hold them to be revoked.

Of those to whom as unworthy thereof, Feoffments are made.
IN diverse parts and places, the feodaries, vassails of lands and benefices,
which they have peaceably obtained from their Lords often times by word of
mouth, and fraudulently pass them over again unto their said Lords; which
having done, they defy and maliciously fall out with their said Lords, and
thereby wrong them, and under pretense of war, or enmity, re-enter upon the
same, and forcibly hold and possess them: Therefore, this present law shall
for ever be observed, that such resignations or surrenders shall be held and
esteemed to be void and of no value, unless they be freely, orderly, and
lawfully past over, in such manner, that the said benefices, and feoffments may
be really and effectually assigned into the Lords hands again, that so in time
to come, there may no quarrel nor claim be made for them with the Lords,
either by themselves or any other in their names, or by the counsel, aid or
procurement of them, or of any man whatsoever; And doing to the contrary, or
troubling and molesting the Lords for the said benefices and feoffments,
resigned or not resigned, or doing them any wrong, or counselling, aiding, or
abetting others against them, in that case they shall lose their said benefices
and feoffments, and be accounted, holden and esteemed to be infamous persons,
and outlawes, and not worthy to enjoy or repossesse the same, by any means:
and if by any new contract, or bargain by them made with their said Lords,
they shall at any time be remitted into the same, by all manner of
construction, the said feoffment shall be void and of no effect. Lastly, we
will and ordain that they or any of them that shall not fraudulently make such
resignations unto their Lords, and yet afterward trouble them for the same, or
fraudulently making them, wilfully molest, invade, and assail them by force of
this our-imperiall decree, shall incur all the penalties aforesaid.

Of Conspiracies.
FVrther, detesting (as our Laws import) all conspiracies, assemblies, or
unlawful confederations, made, either in, or out of Cities, or between Cities
and Cities, persons and persons, or persons private and Cities, (under pretense
of banquets, or meetings of friends and Citizens at funeral feasts, etc.)
those kind of assemblies, confederations, or compacts, as also the customs of
the same, we censure to be corrupt, and do reprove, condemn, and upon good
advice disallow and disanull them) of what estate, dignity, or degree soever
they be, either among themselves, or without the authority of the Lords, whose
subjects or ministers, or under whose Jurisdictions they are, (their said Lords
not excepted) or shall from henceforth do, or in time to come presume to do,
as by the sacred Laws of our excellent, imperial predecessors, they are
without doubt prohibited, and disanulled: those confederacies and Laws
excepted, which Princes, Cities, and others, for the general peace of their
Provinces and Countries shall make, conclude and agree upon among themselves:
which being in our Decree specially reserved, we judge to be and remain in
force and vigor; until by us other order shall be taken for the same;) And
conclude, that if any particular person, contrary to the tenor of this our
Decree, and the ancient Laws made concerning the same, shall hereafter enter
into any other confederacies, meetings, conspiracies, and compacts: besides the
penalties for the same set down in the Laws, they shall incur the danger of
infamy, and the forfeiture of ten pounds; and those Cities or Universities,
that shall (in that case) do contrary to our said Laws, the forfeiture of an
hundred pounds, together with the loss and deprivation of their Imperial
liberties and privileges; the one half of their said forfeitures, to be paid
into the Emperors Exchequer, and the other half to the Lord of the place, in
whose Jurisdiction the same was committed.

Of Psalburgerie.
BEcause no Citizens and Subjects to Princes, Barons, or such like persons,
shall seek to cast off the original yoke of subjection (as they oftentimes
do complain thereof unto us) and to that end boldly procure their admission
to dwell and inhabit in other Cities, and often in times past practiced the
same, and nevertheless still hold their Privileges in those Cities, Lands,
Towns and Villages, wherein they formerly resided, and yet seek to enjoy the
Liberties and Freedoms of those places whereunto they so remove, and claim
protection of the same, which in Germany was wont commonly to be called
Psalburgerie; To the end that no deceit nor guile should in such cases be
favored or vpholden, by our Imperial power, together with the counsel and
advice of all the Princes Electors, both Spiritual and Temporal, we will and
ordain this Law, perpetually to be holden, That such Citizens and their
Subjects, so deluding or fraudulently dealing, in all the territories, places,
and provinces of the Empire, from this day forward, as so fraudulently procure,
and hereafter shall procure themselves to be entertained, and to dwell in other
cities, shall not in the same Cities enjoy any rights or liberties whatsoever;
unless they dwell corporally in the said City, and therein continually keep
house, and truly, and not fainedly, reside in the same, paying Lot and Scot due
and payable therein. And if any, contrary to the tenor of this our Decree, are
or shall be so received, from henceforth such their acceptance or receiving
shall be void, and of no force, and such as are so received, of what dignity,
condition or state soever they be, from henceforth in no manner shall enjoy
any rights or liberties within the said Cities whatsoever, notwithstanding any
rights, privileges or customs by them obtained, used, or observed in former
times: Which, in as much, or so far, as they are contrary to this our Decree,
we do hereby revoke, and by our Imperial power and authority, pronounce them
to be void of all vigor and force. Touching the premises, concerning the
Princes, Lords, and others, which shall happen so, or hereafter, to be forsaken
by their Subjects, their rights in the persons and goods of their Subjects that
so shall leave them, always excepted. Those nevertheless, that have presumed,
or shall hereafter presume so to receive and entertain other men's Citizens and
Subjects, contrary to the tenor of this our present Decree; If they do not
remit and send them away, within one month after the intimation of these
presents made unto them, shall for every time so offending, forfeit and pay one
hundred marks, the one half into the Emperors Exchequer, and the other half
to the Lords of those that were so received, without favor or pardon.

Of Defiances.
SVch men as pretend to have just cause of Defiance against any man, in those
places where they dwell not or commonly inhabit, and suddenly defy them, we
declare, such damages as shall happen or arise, by burning, spoiling, or
pillage of the parties defied, with their honor, be satisfied: And because
other men's fraud and deceit should not be vpholden nor maintained. We ordain
this Law for ever to be kept and observed. That such Defiances made, or that in
time to come shall be made against any Lords, or persons, with whom they are
conversant, familiar and friends, shall be of no force nor value; neither shall
it be lawful, under any pretense whatsoever, to defy any man, and to spoil,
burn, and bereave him of his goods, etc. unless such defiance be certified,
and made personally unto the party defied three days before, or else, in the
place where he was wont to dwell, and that the party defying can testify the
same Defiance to be so made, by lawful witnesses: And whosoever shall do the
contrary, shall for the same, incur infamy and disgrace, as if no defiance
had been made: whom we also censure by the Law to be punished as a traitor:
We likewise prohibit and condemn all war, and unjust quarrels, and every
unlawful burnings, spoylings, and pillages, undue and extraordinary toles, and
safe-conducts, and such extraordinary exactions, as are used to be made and
taken for such safe-conducts, upon the pains in the Laws aforesaid, and such
like, ordained and set down.

A Letter of Certificate or warning, to be given to the Electors to assemble
about the election of the King of Romans.
ILlustrious and magnanimous Prince H. Margraue of Brandenburgh,
High-Chamberlaine of the Empire, Prince Elector, and our most especial friend;
The election of the King of Romans, which for good causes is now to be made, we
do by these presents certify unto you, and according to your office and
duty, call you to the Election aforesaid, to the end that at such a day, etc.
within three months, orderly ensuing one the other, either you, or your
deputy, or deputies (sufficiently authorized) may take care to be at the place
for the same appointed, according to the Law in the same case provided, there
to deliberate, confer, and agree, with the other Princes our co-Electors,
upon the election of the said King of Romans (by Gods help) to be made
Emperor, and there to stay and remain, until the said election be fully
finished and accomplished, and to do and perform all other things thereunto
appertaining, as by the Laws in that case provided are set down; wherein we
pray you not to fail: otherwise, notwithstanding yours, or your deputies
absence, we will, (with the Princes your co-Electors and ours) (according to
the authority in that case provided by the Law) proceed to the Election.

A form of a Letter of Depulation to be made by one of the Princes Electors
unto his Deputy or Deputies, by him to be sent to the Election.
We by the grace of God, etc. of the holy Empire etc. by these presents make
known unto all men, That forasmuch as the Election of the King of Romans, for
certain special causes is to be made; we respecting the honor of the
Empire, and desiring to further and advance the same, lest it should be
neglected or omitted, being assured of the fidelity, industry and
circumspection of our loving friend, or friends, etc. and knowing by indubitate
presumption, the singular confidence of them in general, and of every one of
them in particular; so that without contrariety, whatsoever one of them shall
take in hand, the others will agree, consent unto, and performe^ according to
Law, and reason, in the best manner, means and form that we may or can
devise, we have made, elected and chosen them to be our lawful Deputies, in
any place where-soeuer, together with the other Princes our co-Electors, as well
ecclesiastical as temporal, to agree and consult upon some fit person to be
chosen King of Romans, and for us, and in our name, in the same consultation
to be made, to name a person, and the same to choose to be King of Romans,
and after to be Emperor: And further, in our name to take any necessary due,
and accustomed oathe in that behalf used, or to be used, as also to make and
appoint one or more deputies in his or their places, and them again to revoke
at his or their wills and pleasures; and to do and perform all other things,
which, in, or about the premises (until the said consultation, deliberation,
and election be finished and done) shall be necessary fit, and convenient, as
we, and in such manner and form, as we may, can, or might possibly do, if we
were personally present, at the said consultation, deliberation, nomination and
election, holding, accounting and conferring, and by these presents, for ever
hereafter confirming, whatsoever our Deputies and Substitutes aforesaid, as
also their Deputies or Substitutes, or every, or any of them in general or
particular shall do, act, and perform in the premises, in what manner soever,
etc.

Of the order in Procession to be holden by the Archbishops, electors of the
Empire.
FOr that it is before set down and declared in the beginning of these our
Constitutions, what order shall be held and observed by the Ecclesiastical
Princes Electors, in sitting and placing themselves in Counsel, at the Table,
and other Solemnities imperial, where the Princes Electors are to go with,
sit, or accompany the Emperor, or the King of Romans, wherein we think to
have sufficiently declared what shall be done at those times, and those places:
We think it convenient to declare what order shall be used by them, when the
Emperor, or the King of Romans shall go abroad or in procession; Therefore
we ordain this perpetual order to be observed, That as often, and when as
the Emperor or King of Romans, with the said Princes Electors, is to go on
procession; and that the Banner is to be borne before him, the Archbishop of
Tryer shall go directly next before the Emperor, or the King, and he only
that bears the Banner, shall go between them: And when the Emperor or King
goes abroad without the Banner, then the said Archbishop shall go in like
manner directly before the Emperor or King, and no man shall go between
them; and the other two Archbishops, Electors shall observe their places,
according to the distinction of their Provinces, touching their sitting in
places aforesaid, formerly declared, and so likewise to be observed in
Processions.

Of the order in Procession to be holden by the temporal Princes Electors, and
by whom the ensigns of Honor shall be borne.
TO declare what order is to be used when the Emperor or King of Romans goes
in Procession, by the secular Princes Electors (whereof we have formerly
spoken,) We ordain and appoint, that as often as any celebration of the
Imperial assemblies is to be done, where the Princes Electors are to accompany
the Emperor or King of Romans when he goes abroad, or on procession, and
that the imperial or regal ensigns are to be borne before them, the Duke of
Saxon, bearing the imperial or regal sword, shall go next before the
Emperor or King, between the Archbishop of Tryer and him; the County
Palatine of the Rhine, shall bear the imperial globe on the right hand; the
Margraue of Brandenburgh, the Scepter on the left hand, and the King of Bohemia
shall directly go next behind the Emperor.

Of the blessing to be given by the Archbishops, in the Emperors presence.
AS often as in the Emperors or the King of Romans presence, Mass is to be
celebrated, and that the Archbishops of Mentz, Tryer, and Collen, or two of
them shall chance to be present, at the Confession which is wont to be said
before Mass, and in reaching or offering the Gospel to be kissed, and the Pax
after the Agnus Dei is borne about, as also in the Benediction, after the
solemnity of the Mass is finished, and likewise before Mass is said, and at
grace after meat, this order shall be observed among them, which by their
counsel and advise we have set down, that the first day all these things
shall be observed and done by the first, the second day by the second, and the
third day by the third of them, and in the absence of the first, second, or
third of them, in that case the second shall do that which the first or the
last should have done, and so orderly as it falls out when any of them is not
present, that they may one after another orderly by course obtain that honor,
and give example unto others to do the like, when time shall fall out, and
thereby incite them to the same conniuence and charitable inclination, in
observing the same course. If any man shall enter into any wicked conspiracy
or faction, by oath or promise, with any Princes, Gentlemen, or private and
common people, or shall give them any counsel or advise to kill the reverent
and illustrious Princes Electors, ecclesiastical or temporal, or any of them,
for they are a part or our body, he or they, that in such case are found
guilty, shall be punished for the same fact of conspiracy, as if they had
really committed the fact, and were guilty of high treason, by loss of their
lives, and forfeiture of all their Lands and Goods to the Emperor, and his or
their sons, whose life, (by our special imperial favor) we spare, shall
be punished, for his fathers fault, he shall loose his fathers inheritance,
and others shall enjoy the same; he shall be incapable of making any will, or
of receiving any thing by another man's will, he shall always be needy and
poor, his fathers infamy shall ever be imputed unto him, he shall never be
admitted into any honor, nor his oath allowed to be good; and to conclude, he
shall be so miserable, and in perpetual poverty, that death to him shall be a
comfort, and life a punishment. And further, we command him so to be noted and
observed, that without our special license, he shall not at any time presume
or be permitted to have access unto our person: Touching the daughters, how
many soever they be, they shall not have the full fourth part of their Mothers
goods; whether she die intestate or not, we will take order, that they shall
have an indifferent part thereof for their relief, rather then the whol^ as if
they were her heirs; for their sentence in truth, ought not to be so rigorous,
that by infirmity of sex are of less power to commit evil. Emancipations or
Feoffments made by the parents, either to the sons or daughters, shall be
void and of none effect, neither shall any fraudulent alienations, made by the
said parents, from the time that they once entered into the said conspiracies
and factions, be good nor allowable in law: And touching their wives dowries,
if they were so made by their husbands unto them that the reuersion thereof
should reuert unto the sons, after the wives decease, they shall acknowledge
that reuersion to reuert unto our Exchequer, the fourth part whereof ought
rather to fall unto the daughters then to the sons; and that punishment which
we set down and appoint, for the parties and their sons, the same severity
also shall be used toward the Servants, Officers and Abetters of them, and of
their sons. But if any of them, that in the beginning and entrance into the
said faction, shall seem to keep counsel with the parties guilty, and
afterward shall disclose it, and rather seek to cross it for our good and
honor, and they also that shall have sought to put their malicious faction in
practice, if at last, unknown to the other conspirators, they shall secretly
disclose it, we judge them to be worthy of pardon and forgiveness. We further
ordain, that if any conspiracies, shall have been made against the said
Princes Electors, spiritual or temporal, by any man that is dead, and the
same after his death is known and discovered, that crime concerning the hurt
and danger of the life of the Princes Electors, touching the imperial
majesty, for if the members be hurt, the head cannot be well, nor in safety,
therefore we will and command, that after the death of the party that is
known to have been guilty in his life time, the same fault shall be punished,
that the dead party being found guilty, his memory may be extinguished, and
his goods taken away from his successors; for if any man conceiueth or
imagines mischief, if follows thereby that his mind was depraved; and
therefore seeing that he did imagine and invent such a mischief, he had no
power to alienate nor infranchise the same, nor yet by right in this case to
take order for the payment of his debts. Therefore if the members be hurt, the
head must needs be the worse, that is, if any conspiracy were made against
the Princes Electors, spiritual or temporal, by any man that is dead, the
goods and lands of the said person shall be attached, as if he had been
executed for the same offense.

Touching the integrity that is to be observed among the Princes Electors.
IF other Princes of our Empire do agree in unity of spirit and wills to
observe justice and equity, that the Subjects of the Empire may thereby live
in peace and tranquillity; much more ought the Princes Electors of the Empire
to seek to maintain and preserve the same; for where the danger is most
evident, there it ought more speedily to be prevented, left those the pillars
breaking, the whole house should fall to decay. Therefore We decree and ordain
this to be a perpetual Law, That as in former time, out of the memory of man,
so in time to come, the illustrious and magnificent Princes, the King of
Bohemia, the Earl Palatine of the Rhine, the Duke of Saxon, and the Margraue
of Brandenburgh, being strictly bound together by their Territories, ought not
touching homages, vassalage, and other rights to them belonging, to be
separated, divided, or in any wise dismembered, but to the end that they may
rather be, and remain in their perfect integrity, their eldest son, shall
succeed them in their rights, privileges and dominions; unless he shall
chance to be distract of his senses, foolish, or otherwise defective in mind,
for the which cause he ought not, nor cannot govern others; in which cases,
being prohibited of succession therein, the second son (if there be any) or
some other elder brother or cousin, that is a Temporal Prince, and next of
blood, that lineally descends from the father, shall be his successor, who
then shall deal kindly with the other brethren and sisters, touching their
maintenance, and as he shall think good, and according to his means, without
dividing or dismembring the principality and appurtenances thereof in any sort.

Touching the Emperors Court and Sessions.
THat day whereon the Emperors or the King of Romans Court is to be holden,
at an hour appointed, the Princes Electors both Spiritual and Temporal,
shall come to the Emperors, or Kings Palace, and there the Emperor or the
King shall put on all his Imperial Roabes, and mounting upon their horses, all
of them shall go with the Emperor, or the King, to the place where the Court
is to be holden, orderly, and in manner and form (as it is formerly set down
in our Decree, to that end made;) The chief Chancellor, in whose precinct or
jurisdiction it shall happen to be, shall bear or carry all the Seals and
imperial and regal Tipes upon a silver wand: The Secular Princes Electors,
shall bear the Scepter, the Ball, the Sword, every one as he is orderly to do
it, according to the Decree for the same purpose made; They shall likewise
bear, (going directly next before, the Archbishop of Tryer, keeping his
ordinary place) first the Crown of Aqusgranie, then the Crown of Millaine,
before the Emperor, as then apparelled in his Imperial Roabes, which shall
be borne by other inferior Princes, thereunto appointed by the Emperor. The
Empress or the Queen of Romans apparelled in her Imperial vestures, shall
go and follow after the Emperor or the King of Romans, and the King of
Bohemia, (whose place is to go next after the Emperor) an indifferent space
from them; her Ladies and Maids of Honor orderly following her to the Court.

The offices of the Princes Electors at the Solemnities which are to be
observed in the Emperors Court at royal feasts and assemblies.
WE ordain and appoint, that when the Emperor or King of Romans shall
celebrate any solemn feasts, whereat the Princes Electors are to serve, and
execute their Offices hereafter declared and set down; the Emperor or the
King sitting in the Imperial Throne, the Duke of Saxon shall execute his
office in this manner: Before the Gate of the Emperor, or the King, there
shall be set a heap of Oats, so high that it shall reach to the breast or
saddle of the horse, whereon the said Duke shall ride, who shall bear in his
hand a silver Wand, and a Measure of silver, which both together shall weigh
two hundred Marks of silver; and sitting upon his horse, shall first fill that
measure full of Oats, and shall give it to his servant that is next unto him;
which done, sticking his staff in the Oats, he shall go back again; and
then his vice-Marshall, Seigneur de Papenheym, coming thither, or in his
absence, the Marshall of the Court, shall distribute the rest of the Oats. The
Emperor or the King being gone in to sit at the Table, the Archbishops,
Princes Electors, standing before the Table, with the rest of the Prelates,
shall say grace, according to the order formerly set down: and when grace is
said, the three Archbishops (if they be all there) or two, or one of them,
shall receive the Imperial or Regal Seal and Tipe from the Chancellor of the
Court, he in whose Chancellours jurisdiction that feast or solemnity shall
chance to be celebrated, standing in the middle, and the other two on either
side of him, shall all lay their hands upon the Staff, whereon the said Seal
and Type hangs, and so carry it, and with great reverence lay it upon the
Table before the Emperor, or the King, who presently shall deliver the same
again unto them, and in whose Arch-chancelors precinct it shall then be, as
aforesaid, he shall carry the greater Seal about his neck, to the end of the
Table, and from thence to his house, riding from the Emperors Court upon his
horse.

The Staff whereof mention was formerly made, must be silver, waighing two
hundred Marks, the third part of the value whereof every one of the
Archbishops must pay and contribute equally, and that Staff with the Seals
and Types, must presently be given to the Chancelour of the Emperors Court, to
use them when occasion serves; and after that he who by order carrying the
great Seal about his neck from the Court, is gone home to his lodging, as
aforesaid, he shall presently send it back again by one of his friends on
horseback to the Emperors Court, to the Chancelour, which according to the
dignity of the place, and the favor which he is to bear to the Court of the
Chancerie, he is bound freely to deliver to the said Chancelour. Then the
Margraue of Brandenburgh, Lord High-Chamberlaine of the Empire, coming on
horseback with a Silver Basin (waying twelve Marks in Silver,) full of water
in his hand, and a fine clean Towell on his arm, lighting down, must give
the Emperor or King of Romans water to wash his hands; after him the Earl
Palatine of the Rhine, must come on horseback with four silver Platters in
his hands full of meat, every one of them waying three Marks in value, who
lighting off from his horse, must carry and set them down upon the Table
before the Emperor, or King; after him the King of Bohemia, chief Butler of
the Empire, riding on a horse, with a Napkin on his arm, and a covered cup in
his hand, (waighing twelve Marks) full of Wine mixed with water, lighting
down, gives the cup to the Emperor or King of Romans, to drink. Further,
we ordain, that the Secular Princes, Electors, having performed their
offices, the Earl of Falkenstein, vice-Chamberlaine, shall take the Horse and
Basin from the Margraue of Brandenburgh for his fee; the chief master cook of
Noremburgh, the horse and dishes from the Earl Palatine for his fee; the Earl
of Limburgh vice-Butler, the Horse and Cup from the King of Bohemia, for his
fee; and the Baron of Papenheym, vice-Marshall, the Horse, Staff, and Measure
aforesaid, from the Duke of Saxon for his fee, if they be there personally
present, to execute their offices; but if they or any of them shall be absent
at that time, then the ordinary officers of the Emperors or King of Romans
Court, in their absence, that is to say, in every one of their places, that are
absent, whose place is to execute the same, as to his office belongs, shall
take away and have the aforesaid things. The Emperors table must be in suth
sort prepared and placed, that it must stand six foot higher then the rest of
the tables in the hall, whereat (upon that day) the Emperor or King of
Romans must sit alone. The Table whereat the Empress or Queen of Romans
shall sit, must stand on the one side of the Hall, three foot lower then the
Emperors Table, and so many foot higher, above the Princes Electors, which
Princes shall have, their Seats or Tables, one as high as another, lower then
the Emperors or Kings Table, being seven in number, which shall stand, three
on the right hand, and three on the left, and the seventh directly before the
Emperor, or King, (as in our Ordinance formerly made for the order and manner
by them to be observed in sitting down in the Emperors presence, is at large
declared) and no man shall sit with them at the said Tables, but themselves
alone: Neither shall any of the said secular Princes Electors, having
performed his office, sit down at the Table appointed for him, as long as the
rest of his Co-electors, Princes, are performing their offices; but while any
of them, or their Officers, are about the performing thereof, he shall stand at
the Table appointed for him, expecting the performance of their offices
aforesaid, and then every one of them shall sit down at his several Table.

Also, we find in the ancient Records, time out of mind, that those that were
our Predecessors thought it fit and convenient to be observed, that the
election of the King of Romans, to be future Emperor, should be made in the
City of Franc^ford, and that his first Coronation should be done in the City
of Aquisgranie, and the first solemn feast held in the City of Noremburgh:
wherefore, for many considerations, we ordain and appoint the same to be so
observed in time to come, unless any lawful cause of hinderance or
impeachment thereof fall out to the contrary. And if that any of the Princes
Electors Spiritual or Temporal, upon just and good occasion; being summoned
to be there at the said feast, cannot come, he shall send his deputy; but of
what estate or dignity soever he be that is so sent for his deputy, yet he
shall not sit down at the Table, or in the seat of him that sent him.
Further, these offices and other things being performed at the said Imperial
or Kingly feast: The master or Steward of the feast shall have all the tables,
boords and scaffolds of wood for his fee, that was prepared against that feast
for the Emperor and the King, as also for the Electors, at the celebration
thereof, according to ancient custom.

What Fees the Officers are to have when the Princes acknowledge Fealty to the
Emperor or King of Romans.
WE ordain this Imperial Decree, that the Princes Electors, Spiritual and
Temporal, when they acknowledge their fealty to the Emperor or the King of
Romans, shall not be bound to give or pay any money to any man, at that time,
for that the money which is due to Officers in that kind, seeing the said
Princes Electors, are every one superior Imperial officers, and have their
Deputies or Substitutes in every one of their offices, given them by the
Roman Princes; it were absurd, that Under-officers or Substitutes should,
upon any color whatsoever, ask or exact any fees of their Superiors, unless
the said Princes of their own free wills and liberalities, will give them any
thing. But other Princes, both Ecclesiastical and Secular, when they (as
aforesaid) acknowledge fealty unto the Emperor of Rome, or to the King, they
shall give to the Kings or the Emperors officers of the Court, sixty and six
marks of silver, unless any of them can by special privilege or indulgence,
by the Emperors formerly granted to them, discharge themselves thereof, and
prove, that they are free from paying such, or any the like fees, used when
they acknowledged their fealties; which said sixty six marks, the Master or
Steward of the said Imperial feast, shall divide in this manner. First,
reserving ten marks for himself, he shall give, to the Emperors or Kings
Chancellor of the court, ten marks, to the Masters of the Court, Clarks, and
Doctors, three marks, and to the Clarke of the Seal, for Wax and Parchment,
one mark; in such manner nevertheless, that the Chancellor and Clerks shall
not take such fees of the Princes, but only to testify that they have done
their fealty, and to signify the same. The said Master also shall give unto
the vice-Butler of Limburgh, ten marks, to the master Cook of Noremburgh, ten
marks, to the vice-Marshall of Papenheim, ten marks, and to the
vice-Chamberlaine of Falkenstein, ten marks; upon this condition
nevertheless, if they, and every of them shall be present at the Court, to
execute their offices according to their places; and that if they, or any of
them be absent, then the Officers of the Imperial or Kings Court, that use to
serve in those Offices, shall supply their said places, every one as it falls
out, and shall have the said fees accordingly. And when any Prince sitting upon
an horse or other beast, does his fealty to the Emperor or the King, that
horse or beast, of what kind soever it be, belongs as a fee unto the chief
Marshall, the Duke of Saxon, if he be present, or else, to the vice-Marshall of
Papenheim; and in his absence to the Marshall of the Emperors or Kings Court.

Forasmuch as that for the honor of the Roman Emperor, it is expedient,
that the said Emperor having to deal and treat with diverse Nations, of
sundry and several Languages, should understand and speak the said Languages:
It is fit and convenient in every man's judgment, that the Princes Electors,
being the pillars and supporters of the Empire, should be instructed and taught
diverse Languages, that they may understand every man, and be understood of
them; and thereby assisting the Emperor in his principal and speciallest
affairs, he may the more be honored. Therefore we ordain and appoint, that
the illustrious Princes Electors, viz. the King of Bohemia, the County Palatine
of the Rhine, the Duke of Saxon, and the Margraue of Brandenburgh, their
sons, heirs, and successors, when they can perfectly understand and speak
their own mother Language, the High- German tongues, at the age of seven
years they shall be taught to speak the Latin, Italian, and Slauonian
tongues, so that at fourteen years of age, by the help of God, they may
well understand the same, being not only necessary, but for special causes
most necessary, for that those Languages are much used in the Empire, and by
them they may the eassier manage the Imperial affairs: Which, the better to
effect, we think it fit and convenient, that the Fathers should leave the
charge of their sons, if they have any, or of their next kinsmen, whom they
know must and shall be their heirs and successors in their honors and lands,
and either send them to such places where they may be instructed and taught
those languages, or else keep such Masters and Instructers for them in their
houses, together with young Boys that are skillful in those Languages, to bear
them company, that they may (by those means) the readilier, sooner and
perfectlier learn, and be instructed in the same. (*)

FINIS.
