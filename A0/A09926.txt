A Form of prayer to be used in private houses every Morning and Euenyng.
ALmyghtie GOD and most merciful father, we do not present our selves here
before thy majesty, trustyng in our own merits or worthynes: but in thy
manyfold mercies, which have promised to grant our requests in hearing our
prayers, which we shall make to thee in the name of thy beloved son Jesus
Christ our Lord, who has also commanded us to assemble our selves together in
his name, with full assurance that he will not only be amongst us: but also
be our mediator and advocate toward thy majesty, that we may obtain all
things which shall seem expedient to thy blessed will, for our necessities.
Therefore we beseech thee most merciful father, to turn thy loving countenance
toward us, and impute not unto us our manyfolde sins and offenses, whereby
we justly deserve thy wrath and sharp punishment: but rather receive us to thy
mercy for Jesus Christ's sake, acceptyng his death and passion as a just
recompense for all our offenses, in whom only thou art pleased, and through
whom thou can not be offended with us. And seeing that of thy great mercies we
have quyetly passed this night, grant (O heavenly father) that we may bestow
this day wholly in thy service, so that all our thoughts, words, and deeds,
may redounde to the glory of thy name, and good example to all men, who seeing
our good works, may gloryfye thee our heavenly father.

And forsomuche as thou have of thy mere favor and love, not only created us
to thine own similitude and lykenes, but also haste chosen us to be heirs
with thy dear son Jesus Christ, of that immortal kingdom which thou
had prepared for us before the beginning of the world: we beseech thee to
increase our faith and knowledge, and to lyghten our hearts with thy holy
spirit, that we may in the mean time live in godly conversation and
integrity of life, knowing that Idolaters, aduouterers, covetous men,
contentious persons, dronkardes, gluttons, and such like shall not inherit
the kingdom of God. And because thou have commanded us to pray one for
another, we do not only make request (O Lord) for our selves, and them that
thou have alredye called to the true understanding of thy heavenly will: but
for all people and nations of the world, who as they know by thy wonderful
works that thou art God over all: so they may be instructed by thy holy
spirit, to believe in thee their only savior and redeemer. But forasmuch as
they can not believe except they hear, nor can not hear but by preaching, and
none can preach except they be sent: therefore (O Lord) raise up faithful
distributours of thy mysteries, who setting apart all worldly respects, may
both in their life and doctrine only seek thy glory. Contrarylye, confound
Satan Antichrist, with all hyerlynges, whom thou have already cast of, into a
reprobate sense, that they may not by sects, scismes, herresyes, and errors,
disquiet thy little flock. And because (O Lord) we be fallen into the latter
days and dangerous times, wherein ignorance has gotten the upper hand, and
Satan by his ministers seek by all means to quench che light of the
Gospel: we beseech thee to maynteyne thy cause against those rauenyng Wolves,
and strenthen all thy servants whom they keep in prison and in bondage. Let
not thy long sufferyng be an occasion either to increase their tyranny, or to
discourage thy children, neither yet let our sins and wickedness be a
hynderaunce to thy mercies, but with speed, O Lord, consider these great
mis^ryes. For thy people of Israel many times provoked thine anger by their
sins, and thou punyshedst them by thy just judgment, yet though their sins
were never so grievous, if they once returned from their iniquity, thou
receiuedst them to mercy: We therefore most wretched sinners bewail our
manyfolde sins, and earnestly bewail and repent us for our former wickedness
and ungodly behauyour toward thee. And whereas we cannot of our selves
purchase thy pardon: yet we humbly beseech thee for Jesus Christ's sake, to
show thy mercies upon us, and receive us again to thy favor. Grant us dear
father these our requests, and all other things necessary for us and the
whole Church, according to thy promise in Jesus Christ our Lord, in whose
name we beseech thee, as he has taught us, saying: Our father which art in
heaven. etc.

Euenyng Prayer.
O Lord God, father everlasting, and full of pity, we acknowledge and confess
that we be not worthy to lift up our eyes to heaven, much less to present
ourselves before thy heavenly majesty, with confidence that thou will hear
our prayers and grant our requests, if we consider our own deservings. For
our consciences do accuse us, and our sins witness against us, and we know
that thou art an vpryght judge, which do not justify the sinners and wicked
men, but punyshest the faults of all such as transgress thy commandments:
yet most merciful father, since it has pleased thee to command us to call
upon thee in all our troubles and adversities, promysyng even then to help us,
when we feel our selves (as it were) swallowed up of death and desperation: we
utterly renounce all worldly confidence, and flee to thy sovereign bounty, as
our only stay and refuge, besechyng thee not to call to remembrance our
manyfolde sins and wickedness whereby we continuallye provoke thy wrath and
indignation against us, neither our negligence and unkindness, which have
neither worthelye esteemed, nor in our lives sufficiently expressed the sweet
comfort of thy Gospel reueyled unto us: but rather to accept the obedience and
death of thy son Jesus Christ, who by offryng up his body once for all in
sacrafice, has made a sufficient recompense for all our sins. Have mercy
therefore upon us, O Lord, and forgive us our offenses, teach us by thy holy
spirit that we may ryghtly way them, and earnestly repent for the same, and so
much the rather (O Lord) because that the reprobate and such as thou have
forsaken, can not praise thee nor call upon thy name, but the repentyng heart,
the sorrowful mind, the conscience oppressed hungryng and thyrstyng for thy
grace, shall ever set forth thy praise and glory. And albeit we be but worms
and dust, yet thou art our creator, and we be the work of thy hands, yea,
thou art our father, and we thy children, thou art our shephearde, and we thy
flock, thou art the redeemer, and we thy people whom thou have bought, thou
art our God, and we thine inheritance: Correct us not therefore in thine
anger, O Lord, neither according to our deserts punyshe us, but mercifully
chastyse us with a fatherly affection, that all the world may know, that at
what time soever a sinner does repent him of his sins from the bottom of his
heart, thou wylt put away from him his wickedness out of thy remembrance, as
thou have promised by thy holy prophet.

Finally, forasmuch as it has pleased thee for to make the night for man to
rest in, as thou have ordained him the day to travel: Grant (O dear father)
that we may so take our bodyly rest, that our souls may continually watch for
the time that our Lord Jesus Christ shall appear for our delyueraunce out of
this mortal life, and in the mean season, that we (being not overcome by any
fantasyes, dreams, or other temptations) may fully set our minds upon thee,
love thee, fear thee, and rest in thee. Furthermore, that our sleep be not
excessive or overmuch, after the insatiable desires of our flesh, but only
sufficient to content our weak nature, that we may be better disposed to live
in godly conversation, to the glory of thy holy name, and profit of our
brethren. Sobeit.

A Godly prayer to be said at all times.
HOnor and praise be given to thee O Lord God almighty, most dear father of
heaven, for all thy mercies and loving kyndnes showed unto us, in that it has
pleased thy gracious goodness freely and of thy own accord, to elect and chose
us to salvation before the beginning of the world, and even like continual
thanks be given to thee for creatyng us after thine own Image, for redeemyng
us with the precious blood of thy dear son when we were utterly lost, for
sanctifying us with thy holy spirit, in the relieuyng and succouryng us in all
our needs and necessities, for saving us from all dangers of body and soul,
for comfortyng us so fatherly in all our tribulations and persecutions, for
sparyng so long, and geuyng us so large a time of repentance. These benefits
(O most merciful father) like as we knowledge to have received them of thy
only goodness: even so we beseech thee for thy son Jesus Christ's sake, that
thou will grant us always thy holy spirit, whereby we may continually grow
in thankefulnes toward thee, to be led in all truth, and comforted in all
our adversities. O Lord strengthen our faith, kyndle it more in feruentnes and
love toward thee and our neighbors, for thy sake suffer us not (most dear
father) to receive thy word any more in vain: but grant us always the
assistaunce of thy grace and holy spirit, that in heart, word, and deed, we
may sanctify and do worship to thy name, help to amplyfie and increase thy
kingdom, and whatsoever thou sendeste, we may be heartily well content with
thy good pleasure and will. Let us not lack the thing (O Father) without the
which we can not serve thee: but bless thou so all the works of our hands
that we may have sufficient, and not to be chargeable, but rather helpefull
unto others. Be merciful O Lord to our offenses, and seeing our debt is
great, which thou have forgeuen us in Jesus Christ, make us to love thee and
our neighbors so much the more. Be thou our Father, our Captain and defendour
in all temptations, hold thou us by thy merciful hand, that we may be
delivered from all inconveniences, and end our lives in the sanctyfying and
honor of thy holy name, through Jesus Christ our only Savior, Amen.

Let thy myghtie hand and outstretched arm, O Lord, be still our defense,
thy mercy and loving kyndnes, in Jesus Christ thy dear son our salvation,
thy true and holy word our instruction, thy grace and holy spirit our comfort
and consolation, unto the end, and in the end. So be it.

Another prayer to be said at all times.
O Almyghtie, most merciful father in heaven, we beseech thee for thy sons
sake our only Savior and redeemer Jesus Christ, grant unto us and all
mankind thy holy spirit, to lead, govern, and keep us in thy ways and
commandments, for we be wretched sinners, full of sin, deseruyng no
goodness, and unprofitable servants, that can neither think, say, or do any
thing that is good without thy help, for all goodness comes of thee.
Notwithstanding Lord we be thy creatures, wherefore we beseech thee to help
succor, and comfort us in this veil of misery, and increase our faith, so
that in all our enterpryses we neither do nor require any thing but that may be
to thy honor and glory, and to the profit and commodity of our neighbors,
and that thy will may be always our will, and that our will may be always
thy will, and that we in all our troubles and adversities may always require
thy will to be done. And we beseech thee give us grace mekelye to bear thy
Cross with thee whenever it shall please thee to lay it upon us. Also we
beseech thee to take from us and to mortify in us all manner of covetousness,
lasciuiousnes, vayneglory, evil thoughts, Idleness, lying, swearyng, stealyng,
and all manner untruth, and grant unto us virtue, good thoughts, and in all
our demeanor truth, and a meke spirit, according to thy promise, at thy will
and pleasure. Moreover, we beseech thee to give us grace to amend this
noughtie and sinful living that we have hitherto walked in, and never to
return to the same again: but from henceforth to proceade, increase, and
continue in virtue, so that we may always hereafter serve thee in fear and
love, and also that we may depart out of this most miserable and wretched
world, in the faith of Christ, at thy will and pleasure, to whom for thy most
glorious creation, and unto thy son our only savior and redeemer Jesus
Christ, for his most precious redemption, and to the holy ghost, for his most
comfortable consolation, be honor, thanks, glory, and praise for ever and
ever. Amen.

A thanks geuyng to God in the Morning, for our sleep.
ALmyghtie and most gentle God, we thank thee for the sweet sleep and
comfortable rest that thou have given us this night past, and forasmuch as
thou have commanded by thy holy word, that no man should be idle, but all
occupied in virtuous exercyses, every man according to his calling: we most
humbly beseech thee, that thine eyes may attend upon us, daily defend us in
perils, succor us, cheryshe, comfort, and govern all our counselles,
studyes, and labors, in such wise, that we may so spend this day according to
thy most blessed will, without the hurtyng of our neighbors, and that we may
diligently and warely eschew and avoid all things that should displease
thee, set thee always before our eyes, live in thy fear, and ever work that,
that may be found acceptable before thy divine majesty, through Jesus Christ
our Lord.

Amen.
