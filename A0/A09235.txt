A letter to Rome, to declare to ye Pope,
John Felton his friend is hanged in a rope:
And farther, a right his grace to inform,
He dyed a Papist, and seemd not to turn.

To the tune of Row well ye Mariners.
WHo keeps Saint Angel gates?
Where lies our holy father say?
I muze that no man waytes,
Nor comes to meet me on the way.
Sir Pope I say? if you be nere,
Bow down to me your listening ear:
Come forth, besturre you then a pace,
Fo I have news to show your grace.
Stay not, come on,
That I from hence were shortly gone:
Hark well, hear me,
What tidings I have brought to thee
The Bull so lately sent
To England by your holy grace,
John Felton may repent
For setting up the same in place:
For he upon a goodly zeal
He bare unto your common weal
Has ventured life to pleasure you,
And now is hanged, I tell you true.
Wherefore, sir Pope,
In England have you lost your hope.
Curse on, spare not,
Your knights are like to go to pot.
But further to declare,
He dyed your obedient child:
And never seemd to spare,
For to exalt your doctrine wild:
And told the people every one
He dyed your obedient son
And as he might, he did set forth,
Your dignity that's nothing worth.
Your trash, your toys,
He took to be his only joys:
Therefore, has won,
Of you the crown of martyrdom.
Let him be shryned then
According to his merits due,
As you have others done
That prove unto their Prince untrue:
For these (sir Pope) you love of life,
That with their Princes fall at strife:
Defendyng of your supreme power,
Yet some have paid full dear therefore.
As now, lately,
Your friend John Felton seemd to try
Therefore, I pray,
That you a mass for him will say.
King all the belles in Rome
To do his sinful soul some good,
Let that be done right soon
Because that he has shed his blood,
His quarters stand not all together
But ye may hap to ring them thither
In place where you would have them be
Then might you do as pleases ye.
For why? they hang,
Vnshryned each one upon a stang:
Thus stands, the case,
On London gates they have a place.
His head upon a pole
Stands waueri^g in ye wherli^g wynd,
But where should be his soul
To you belongs for to find:
I wysh you Purgatory look
And search each corner with your hook,
Lest it might chance or you be ware
The Deuyls to catce him in a snare.
If ye, him see,
From Purgatory set him free:
Let not, trudge than,
Fetch Felton out and if ye can.
I wysh you now sir Pope
To look unto your faithful friends,
That in your Bulls have hope
To have your pardon for their sins,
For here I tell you, every Lad
Does scoff and scorn your bulls to bad,
And think they shall the better fare
For hatyng of your cursed ware.
Now do, I end,
I came to show you as a friend:
Whether bless, or curse,
You send to me, I am not the worse.
Steven Peele.

FINIS.

black Boy: at the middle North door of Paul's church.
