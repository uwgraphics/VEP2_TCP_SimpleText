Thomas Purfoote.

The Arbor of Amity, wherein is comprised pleasant Poems and pretty Poesies,
set forth by Thomas Howell Gentleman.

Anno. 1568.

Imprinted at London by Henry Denham, dwelling in Pater noster Row, at the
sign of the Star.

To the right Noble and most virtuous Lady, the Lady Anne Talbot, Thomas Howell
wysheth long life, with increase of honor.
FEW WORDS SONE amended, as reports the Proverb, inferring thereby that
silver sentence of the Philosopher Zeno (worthy for the excellency of it to be
graven in durable place, with Letters of the most purest Gold) that nature had
given us two ears and one mouth, to the intent, that we should hear more than
we utter in words, as it is also more agreeable to the way of wisdom, wisely
to be silent, then fondly to speak, greater virtue it is, and labor more
commendable to learn to suppress thy tongue, then to seek the fasset to set
abroch the same, for in silence is wisdom and prudence, when in talk fools
are known. Which thing whilst I did perpend with my self (right honorable
Lady) though I had purposed before to practice my pen to the utterance of
such an homely hoorde as was gathered in my unskillful head, and to offer the
present thereof unto your honorable Ladyship, yet these rattling sentences
thundering along as it were Gunshot by the soldiers amassed ears, so abashed
me, that I was utterly discouraged to think, much less yt do so far as to
present a pattern of my rudeness unto your honor, least in manifesting mine
own weakness in words, I should appear even such a one as were wholly
drowned in the lake of ignorance, or washed in the Fountain of folly, to the
overthrow of the good undeserved report that my friendly welwillers do
conceive. But now (right honorable Lady) I have by experience proved of my
self being in your daily presence, the fame of your worthiness and virtues
to be certain true, which eftsoon before I had heard reported by others, who
in each respect of virtue may be comparable to the noble Lady Argia the worthy
king Adrastus his daughter, who in beauty being inferior to none: in
courtesy, in nobleness, in clemency, in liberal bounty, in prudence a
superior, and in many courtlike qualities, in more virtuous knowledge, in all
godliness was equal with the^ that surmou^ted the chiefest: Whereby she was
reputed to be, to her everlasting fame, of a golden nature: so courteous in
words, so friendly in deeds, so comely of countenance, so youthful in years,
so ancient in talk that she was no less adorned with these venerable
vertuos, than with a number of the rest her princelike graces and gifts which
sweetly sprang in her, as the flagrant flowers in the delectable month of May.
Yea, her virtues were excellent and especially in her true and amiable heart,
beautified with loving affection to continue in the same toward* her spouse
the noble knight Polynices: as in the bloody battle of Thebes when the worthy
Polynices was most lamentably slain, gored to the sore wounded heart, with his
brother quelled before his doleful eyes and an innumerable sort overthrown,
and a general Edict by cruel Creon was set forth that under pain of death no
one should adventure to bury the^, but leave them a pray to dogs and ravens.
Notwithstanding the cruelty, notwithstanding this dreadful danger of
commandment, notwithstanding he had lain so long till the stink was so
horrible that he was infectiue, notwithstanding a thousand present perils, yet
this most honorable Lady, of only love, of only hearty affection, only
accompanied with her good sister the Lady Antigone (who bare like love to her
brother) in the night season she spared not to go among an innumerable sort of
carcasses stinking most lothsomly and ceased not to tumble them up and down
with her fine hands, until she had espied her dear husbands body, whom
(although his face with gorie blood and gravel was pitteously defiled) she
disdayned not to kiss and embrace, washing her face with the tears of her
eyes, took it up in her arms, stole it away, and as far as her womanly
power could extend, she interred the same, such was the virtue, such was the
affection, such was the noble heart of this loyal Lady Argia, whose figure in
each quality your honor do lively represent, no courtesy: no comely
countinance, no grace, no gift, no one virtue at all in her but that they have
already taken root and do harbor in your blessed breast. These honorable
ornaments (O noble Argia) afterward I did plainly perceive to be abundantly
in you* the inward fear which before ouerflowed my quailing adventure, is
clean put to flight. And presuming on so noble a nature, I am now boldened,
yea ouerbold humbly to give these rude fantasies collected unto your honor, as
the work of a welwiller. Although better it were for me to be silent, than in
speaking to show my nakedness in wisdom. But you are that princely Argia,
which will rather accept these toys of my poor pen, proceeding from the
good will of my serviceable heart, then the rich present of a froward friendly
foe: wherefore I humbly crave (right honorable Lady, O noble Argia) that you
will consider, the heart not the hand, the giver not the gift, the trustiness
not the toys, the meaning not the matter, my mind, not my madness, my pain
not my pen, whereby I shall be most bound daily to lift my prayers to the
protector of all, that you with that right honorable Lord, the Lord Talbot
your husband, may most prosperously tread the trace of this painful
pilgrimage, to your hearts desire, to the increase of your honors, and
perpetual maintenance of that right honorable and Noble name.

Your honors most humble Orator T. Howell.

Another to the same his honorable and very good Lady.
SOme blase in chosen words,
and filed phrase so fine:
The passing praise of Ladies great,
extolde of wit divine.
And how the Gods above,
have given their gifts of grace:
To plant in them the virtues chief,
in body head and face.
But I will this omit,
my Muse in vain to waste:
For needless it is into the seas,
a water drop to cast.
You need no trumpe to sound,
to spread your nobleness,
For why your wit, your words, your works,
do well the same express:
Your worthiness each where,
your courtesy at home:
Your friendly face, your bounty blessed:
your grace in great renown.
Your virtues excellent,
that spring in noble Well:
Shall never die, no skill I have,
one part thereof to tell.
And God has given his gifts,
to you so large and kind:
That every man may it conceive,
onelesse he will be blind.
Penelope in faith,
unto the Talbot hie:
Pandoras peer for qualities,
that shine as sun in sky.
The Flower of fame you are,
for ever fresh to spring:
As fame will blow her restless trumpe,
your lasting name to ring.
If I had Tullies tongue,
and thousand wits thereto:
If Chaucers vain, if Homers skill,
if thousand helpers mo:
Yet tongue, nor wit nor vain,
nor skill nor help at all
Can well descrie your due desarte,
in praise perpetual.
Therefore my skillesse Muse,
does end his tale to tell:
As one that wants might to will,
O Noble Fem farewell.
Your Honors T. Howell.

To the courteous and gentle Reader, John Keeper student.
THe tender graffe that grows in grove,
that took the stock but late:
From slender spraies his leaves he shootes
but small and young of rate.
Which length of time will strengthen strong,
his yearly fruits to bear:
Whose branch then buddes in stronger stem,
least froward wight it tear.
So Howelles heart and hardy hand,
has plight his pen to set
And graft this branch, the fruits whereof,
are young and tender yet.
Late root it took in seemly soil,
which now begins to spring:
And eke on twigges so trimly grown,
does now his profits bring.
Small gains at first, young trees do yield,
low things youth handles right:
Of matter small the Poets young,
at first began to write.
As Horace first his trifling toys,
in book did place and plat:
And Virgils youth occasion took,
to praise the sielie gnat.
But length of life, shall Howell hold,
on stronger stem to stay:
By cunning skill of settled branch,
to bear the bell away.
Then cease ye not, to help the ground,
where this good graffe does grow:
Who can but give deserved praise,
and thank his Muse I trow,
Which sweetly springs in sugared sap,
of every grace full meet:
Which wife Minerue in lap has nursed,
and gave him suck so sweet.
Whom I do judge, Apolloes Impe,
and eke our Chaucers pear:
What senseless head of malice mad,
will seek such branch to tear.
But learned wits will further forth,
and laud his lore that's rare:
For Zoils snarres and doggish snuffes,
no wiseman need to care.
Then hope I well my Ho to plie,
some greater work to see:
O pity it is this golden Muse,
should vade and die with thee.
A dew good friends ye Readers right,
maintain this branch now shute:
Then will he spring in time full trim,
to yield you larger fruit.
Farewell.

The Talbot true that is,
And still has so remaynde:
Lost never nobleness,
By sprinck of spot distaynde.
On such a fixed faith,
This trusty Talbot stayth.
The Arbor of Amity
The vanity of Beauty.
Form is most frail, a fading flattring show,
As brickle glass, it vadth as grass does grow.
The more it comes unto the crease of years,
The more it faylth, and less the front apperes.
The flagrant flowers, and goodly rubie Rose,
The Uiolets trim, and Lylies white that gross,
Do not always retain their sap and sent,
And florishe gay, with smell most redolent.
So though thou spring of beauty passing all,
And bearst the flower and fame as principal.
Whose peereles view has blasde thy form in sight
Which thou to see in glass takste great delight.
Yet time on face so fair shall forrowes plowe,
And writhed wrincles peer on blemished browe.
That thou shall loath to see thy ragged hew
And hate thy form in lively glass to vewe.
And that which thou have most delighted on,
Thou shall it hate and wish to die anon.
This is most true, by right experience,
The fayrste that ever were are sone gone hence.
Lo Lady fair, of form there is no trust,
It soon does slip, and thou shall reele to dust.
O greedy eyes bewitched with things so frail,
That causes retchlesse youth in love to quail.
Whose witless heads on fancies fond debate,
Such is the slender thread of mortal fate.
To his Friend.
BEware my friend,
Live warylie
At back behind
Pale death does pry
Each hour and space
Account the last,
Let Lamp of grace
With Oil be fast.
Then shall thou stand
In joys to reign,
When Uirgins fond
Shall knock in vain.
God grant us all
To live so right
That when he call
Our Lamps give light.
Describing his lost of liberty and craving return of love.
ONce free I was at liberty,
My merry mind was void of woe:
My heart had great felicity,
I passed not for Cupids bow.
Thus free most free in joyful prime,
I pass the sportes of youthful time.
Until thy vewe as Goddess grace
In heavenly shape that did appear,
Had hent my heart in captive case,
Such was thy voice, such was thy cheer.
That thy fine form of natures frame,
The Gods above might well inflame.
It Venus past in form and face,
Thy corpse thy lims each part so fine,
Thy cheerful cheeks thy gentle race,
Thy courteous heart thy wit divine.
That heart did smart in heavy part,
My freedom fled, bound was my heart.
When first I cast my careless eye,
Upon thy hue that drue the dart,
I little thought thou should lie
So deep sunck down in my poor heart.
I would full feign forgo my hold,
My free estate by wit to fold.
As bird alurde in winters sore,
On limed twigges that often be,
Thinks he is free as late before,
Until he says his flight to flee,
He cries, he flies, in vain he tries,
On twigge in bondage there he lies.
So I by lure of thy good grace,
That thought my heart at liberty:
Was wrapped unawares by featurde face
With most extreme captivity.
A Beauty has me bondsman made,
By love sincere that shall not vade.
Alas my panting heart so sore,
That does lament in sobbing tears:
Most greedy gripes do prick and gore,
To groaning grave my corpse that wears.
My cares and griefs do rack my veins,
Consider thou my restless pains.
Alas most fair and peerless gem,
Have mercy now, draw pity near,
And count me not the least of them
That love thee best in heart sinceere.
So thou that madste my wound so wide,
Shall for the same a salve provide.
My Lady fair, ah Lady dear,
Perpend in heart my dolors great:
And look upon thy prisonere,
Whose chains has through his heart yfreat.
And let not want of wealth in place,
Retract thy love to run his race.
He accuses his tongue.
WHy fearful tongue: what menst thou thus
To fail, thy masters pains to paint,
In matters vain: and frivolous,
Thou runst at rainge: and needs restraint.
But fewer words: my greater pain,
The greater pain: the sooner end,
The sooner end: the better gain,
For less offense: shortst life does lend.
When he thought himself contemned.
O Heart why do thou sigh: and wilt not break,
O doleful chance thou have: a cause thereto
For thy reward in love, and kindness eake,
Is recompenst by hate and deadly woe.
Have I so plight my heart and mind to thee:
Have I been bent so whole unto thy hand,
And others now obtain the fruit from me,
Thou art unkind forsooth: such foe to stand.
O doleful heart, thus plungde in pinching pain,
Lament no more, but break thy truth to try:
For where thy comfort was and joy did reign,
Now hate returns, no news, O heart now die.
Lo thus the breeding birds, their nests do build,
But others take the gains and fruits of them:
The crooked clown so earth the toyling field,
But often the crop, remains to other men.
Well time may come, wherein my fruitless part,
So ill bestowde: some others may bewail
And wish they had, receiude my yielding heart,
Whose loving root, took ground to small avail.
To his friend.
JN heart and mind
Your own am I:
Till death by kind
Shall force to die.
Good virtues plant,
Let truth take place:
Where that does want,
There is no grace.
Being sore sick, answers his fellow enquiring whether he were willing to
die.
We flourish now, but flower shall fall,
and withered fade as frail,
As years returns, so length of time,
causes man and beast to quail.
Now Lady Ver in lively green
does show her grace in field.
Now Estas spreads the parching heat,
That Titans beams do yield.
Now Autumn shows the harvest sheaues
that grow on fertile place:
Now Hiemps heaps the dyke with snow
and shows her frostie face.
So first we spring in lusty youth,
at state of childish years,
Now deeper wit as Estas ripes
in grauer acts appeeres.
Then manhood makth a stabled mind,
none youthly prancks we have:
Now hored age with stealing steps
creepes in, prepare thy grave.
And thus we fleet and fall away,
as well the young as old:
Then youthful impe trust not on years,
short life may make thee cold.
And thus by course and change of time,
things mortal change their way:
One age does pass, an other comes,
lo Time will all decay.
For thin is twist or fatal thread,
on mortal wheel so spoon:
Deaths hour may chance unhoped for,
to lose that life has won.
Then why should I once fear to die,
our byding is not here:
But earth shall rot in earth again,
till righteous judge appear.
When world and worldly things shall pass,
but God shall dure for aye:
Whose grace I crave with heart and soul,
on whom I stand and stay.
Now stretch my steps O Lord to run,
by length of time to be:
That I may live to die a right,
and die to live with thee.
An admonition to his friend.
IF thou will be rightful,
Always stand thou faithful,
To do well be careful,
Note friends and be thankful,
Uaine talk flee, and learn wit,
Mark wise words, and love it,
Always pray, and boast not,
Eschew pride, and vaunt not.
Hate no man, disdain not,
Take time, and sleep not.
Each virtue train justly,
Regard betters wisely.
Offend no Wight wronglie,
And declare always truly.
So God then will love thee,
And good men will praise thee.
When virtue shall clad thee,
All fame shall embrace thee.
Use Virtue.
Do well, abstain from vice,
obey thy parents will,
Remember God, and learn, be wise,
embrace sweet virtue still.
Mark God before thy face,
vprise and pray betime:
No idle hour let pass, seek grace,
detest all heavy crime.
Try ere thou trust, take heed,
have God thy chiefest gain,
Esteem the time before all meede,
and godly life retain.
Always let virtues rule to thy good rest:
If grace shall grow within thy youthful breast.
At his Friends departure.
MY Muse which once with joyful voice,
to thee should welcome tell:
Alas to late, as now she comes,
more fit to bid farewell.
But since my doleful farewell must,
approach in welcomes steed:
And eke at parture hence from me,
welcome should ill proceed.
High Jove I pray thou may farewell,
always in prosperous raze:
And eke in joys to make return,
that welcome may have place.
Of Knowledge.
WHen death is bent,
Yet stands thy praise
For life once spent,
Wit, fame does raise,
When Gold does fail,
Is learning tried:
When riches quail,
Good letters bide.
The more it is pressed,
The more it springs:
It is the best,
Of mundane things.
It bydth with thee,
Do what thou will:
Till dead thou be,
And breath be spilt.
No burden it is,
To charge thy back:
Most wretch he is,
That this does lack.
Each thing that groes,
Does likewise die:
Still learning floes,
Above the sky.
Than knowledge crave
Let riches go:
If this thou have,
wealth needs must gro.
Of Avarice.
THe childishe years in youth,
does take the parents trade:
And are full often against their wills,
compelde by Fathers hard.
To Avarice so vilde,
in Lucres gain to game:
And Father is a happy man,
when son such life does frame.
So secret vice does lurck,
with cloak of virtues face:
And greedy gain the shadow shapes,
of thrift in godly race.
And so from Sire to son,
from son to thousands mo:
By fond conceyte continually
this cloked vice does gro.
Thus each man for himself,
And poor laments in thrall:
For ravening wolfes by greedy gain,
has beggard devil and all.
Thus one does care for one,
and one does learn by one:
Till lust be puffed and chokte with gain
and each man turn to none.
But poor and worldly wights,
shall never freedom find:
As long as men take goods for Gods,
by greedy heart so blind.
Of blind Cupide.
LYbido lewd: has fainde a God of love,
Whose pestlent power: to blase which can anoy
A title fierce: is added through behoue,
A furious God: an Archer blincking boy.
Whom Venus fond: does make to range amiss,
Her pretty boy: her proper son he is.
He rashly flies: in unadvised way,
Which heavens do pierce: by his so little hand
Though least he be: he bears the greatest sway,
Of doubtie knights: he has a witless band.
Alack good child: of wanton foolish crew,
Thou makst them fools: with thy fond badge of blew.
O little boy, thou shootes thy raging darts,
Full well he paints: that makes the bussard blind,
For right, nor rule: nor reason has there parts,
Where fancies fond: does fire an yielding mind.
What ever thou art: all furies fierce that be,
I rather wish: than meddle or make with thee.
To his Friend, whose friendly love he craves.
O Doubtful hap, O pains and pangues yt move:
Thou yet wa^ts years to feel my smarts of love
Me rue, take age alas to think on me
My earnest life, and death is set on thee,
Heart true I give, though most you would me hate,
Until heart break in woes and staruing state,
I erst do crave, regard me once or never,
Die though I must, yet love I thee for ever.
Time tries all, that flies without return,
Naught swifter is then years, yt kills things borne.
Whose stealing steps I wish more fast to flo,
To make thee apt thy timely faith to sho.
Time absent still, we wish to come and stay,
And thus unawares we crave our dying day.
None is content his present state to see,
Yet thou my friend content may only me.
And eke in time I hope thou will regard,
For service true, the servant takes reward.
As time shall give the tried trust of me,
Accepted so, let me thy servant be.
To D. M.
I Crave who will not love,
Who loves I cannot crave:
The thing that does me move
I seek and cannot have.
Amids the floods I stand,
And yet shall die for drink:
Of food great store at hand
Yet hunger makes me shrink.
To his Friend being absent showing his good will.
THe heart that lives in pensive doubt,
His wished joys shut far him fro:
He draws his doleful tunes full out,
In grief, in pains, in cares and woe.
And eke in the end it may befall,
So my unlucky choice to spy,
That guiltless heart thou make full thrall,
By thy decree to live or die.
Then flinted stones and barked tree,
The savage beasts on mountain bred:
Shall wail my woeful hap by thee,
As simple lamb to slaughter led.
My heart has woonted joys resignde
Rejecting all for cause of thee.
A grounded love in yielding mind,
Flees wit and shoonns vtilitee.
To one who after death would leave his lively picture.
TO leave behind a picture fine to see,
It may small time well stand in steed for thee.
But picture fair of noble acts of mind,
That far excelles to learn to leave behind.
Which will maintain a noble name for aye,
As Tullis tongue and Caesar's acts can say.
As Chauser shows and eke our moral Gowre
With thousands more, whose fame shall still endure.
The destruction of many.
NIce hands, poor stock, heart stout, for to see,
No friends, no skill, bags pennylesse be.
And pride does press, to pass the degree,
These brings lewd heads, to great misery.
Being destitute of money, the complaint to his Friend.
OF all the hapless hap,
That chance to mortal fone:
Goldes want to stop a gap,
By proof I find is one.
No pain so sore does freat,
No pinsons so can rent:
No smoking smart so great,
That makes the heart lament.
For empty purse no game,
No food, no friend, no cote:
For money all does frame,
Whose slave we are by lote.
Where money friend does fail,
There fawning friends be gone:
Farewell poor wretch all hail,
Light purse makes heavy moan.
These pains by proof be gest,
What need examples cost:
Where purse is so deprest,
As clapped in Sampson post.
Storms past, yet soon retires,
And drowsy dumpes decay:
So God grant just desires,
To drive these plagues away.
The Lover describes his trusty love.
THough horse so wild in thousand parts,
Should tear my corpse most dolorous:
Though fryde I were with piersing smarts
And boylde in lead most piteous.
Though sword should pierse my heart so cold,
In bloody wounds my death to frame,
Though pain of hell to me were fold,
Most retchlesse wretch and ill by name.
Though thousand miles on foot I fare,
With naked leg in frozen storms:
Though blood of heart I spend in care,
Through countries far in thousand harms.
Though dread in fears does work despair,
And hope alone does cherishe me:
Yet rack that rendes each lim so fair.
Shall not by smart take heart from thee.
An admonition to his Friend.
Learn honest mirth in humble courtesy,
Let person, time and place, regarded be.
Serve God in heart and love his statutes true,
Then thee with goods and heaven he will indue.
Flee idleness always, to labors frame,
Of the one comes good, of the other, sin and shame.
He craves regard of the cares he takes.
THe crooked clown that drawth the plowe
with all his yearly toil:
Receives at last reward of work,
bestowed on fertile soil.
And shall my pains and restless woes,
thus unrewarded be:
Shall I be pressed in simpler sort
and vylder case then he?
The fethred foul that flees aloft,
obtaines the things he seeks:
And sundry where his fostring food,
with chirping bill he peekes.
Esteem me so.
Desirous to requite for many gifts, one to his dear beloue.
NO man of sturdie thorns does seek,
the swelling grapes to have.
No man of floods that vacant are,
can waters justly crave.
No man of candle clean put out,
can lively light obtain:
No man of Codrus simple soul,
a princely gift may claim.
Such let right judgment stand for me,
of thee my parent made:
For I to writhing thorns am like,
in course of present trade.
Therefore receive this simple sign,
my springs yet dried are:
But yet of thorns account this one,
which now my briars are.
My budding tree cannot as now,
some other fruits disclose:
My Garden green for thee alone,
preparde this only Rose.
But I a Briar well do seem,
restore which nothing can:
And I a Briar now perceive,
that I a Briar am.
For still the busy Briar pricks,
but does no gains pretend:
So I with charges press thee still,
but no reward I send.
But if in time from thorns I may,
of Uine tree take the shapes,
Thou shall in steed of Briars sharp,
receive my springing Grapes.
Time always causes some novelty and furthereth knowledge.
NO man so old, but use, or time, or place,
Shall teach him news though he pass Nestors race.
And learn him skill unknown to him before
To shoon the things by which he set great store.
That he shall judge he knew not that at all,
Which as he thought he knew as principal.
Being in extremity the Lover bewayleth his restless life.
MOst greedy gripes with plunging pains,
do pierce my ruthful heart:
I pass the noisome night in groans,
through rent with dreadful dart.
When all rejoice in wished sport,
my moning mind does cry:
The harms so huge in doleful dumpes,
compels me wretch to die.
My languisht limbs in loathsome life,
are rent from bone to bone:
The reins the veins are clean consumde
with heart so cold as stone.
I curse each lingering hour of day,
my bloody wounds to stratch:
Once comes I know the yrksome end,
that shall my cares dispatch.
The furies fierce and fiery flakes,
that burn in hateful hell:
Cannot surmount my passing plunge,
my careless corpse to quell.
O heavy heart when will thou break,
when will thou rent in twain:
For that alone my happy help,
is end of all my pain.
More is my grief, for privy pains,
I only wretch do know:
Nor durst my flashing flame, to friend,
unfaithful men to show.
I rage and rewe I fry and freese,
up whelmde in woes full sore:
My smarting eyes have spent their tears,
farewell for evermore.
Of Misery.
Corpse clad with carfulness,
Heart heapt with heaviness,
Purse poor and pennilesse:
Back bare in bitterness,
Lips laid with lothsomnesse,
O get my grave in readiness,
Feign would I die to end this stresse,
Remediless.
To his Friend H.
HOpe heart well, despair not,
The truth tell and spare not.
Ere God say thou shall not,
Heart hold aye and halt not:
Yet better it is thou spakst not,
When wisdom prouokes not.
Then wiseman thou seemste not,
When silence thou keepste not.
To be learned.
OF learned often, ask good advise,
advised counsel keep:
Things kept bestow on others wise,
flee vice of slothful sleep.
Flatterers.
THey fawn in words and eke with tuiring eye,
They will deceive, trust thou no flattring spy.
For under view of Honnie lies deceyt,
And eke there lurcks of tongue the poysonde beyt.
The praise of virtue.
NOt worldly wealth, nor rich array,
nor Pearls of costly rate:
Nor goods nor Gold that shynes so gay,
can make the gentle state.
But virtue linckt in learned life,
that springs by noble pain:
In them thy famous factes so ryfe,
forever still shall reign.
Besides the same all turns to dust,
throughout the world so wide:
To ashes good and Gold shall rust,
and thou to earth shall slide.
Of Counsel.
THou must do well,
Faith true obtain:
Wit none repel,
Friend dear entraine.
Seek rage to press,
First try heart true:
Thy sins excess,
Lament and rue.
Of Offense.
HOw much a man the greater is,
By his offense that wries amiss:
So much the more the common crew,
That stately crime will note and view.
To one that matched with a froward woman.
TO get good wife it is hard, says Cheremon,
It Is better bury two then marry one.
Who marry will, his heart will sone be spent,
And after that he will also repent.
A necessary ill the wife they call,
But this is worst, it is perpetual.
Wherefore my Friend thou do me wary make,
Whom I to wife and daily mate shall take.
Of Lady Fortune.
O Fortune frail, why do thou take,
of me so mighty power:
To wicked men thou pleasant art,
to good men do thou lowre?
To those that naught by deed deserve,
thou honors do restore:
And those that naught offend at all,
thou plagst in rage full sore.
The men that just and godly are,
thou bringst to great decay:
But those that most unworthy be,
thou richely do array.
Thou driust to death the youthful imps,
and men of age do bide:
O fortune fond unequally:
such times doste thou divide.
That which thou takst from worthy men
thou giuste to persons ill.
Thou no respect of virtue have,
but fondly workst thy will.
Unconstant, frail, sharp, false, untrue,
is Lady Fortunes grace:
To brickle glass most like she is,
with that her flattring face.
Nor doste thou keep in honors still
those men of rich estate,
Nor always do thou frown on men,
which first thou dame did hate.
But truth it is Jehovah hie,
in throne imperial.
He Fortune guides and gives rewards,
he is the Lord of all.
To his faithful Friend.
Clear Phoebus runs in circle round,
in course both day and night:
And eke a heat dame nature gives,
to fiery flames so bright.
And fleeting fish the surging seas,
to haunt do never cease:
And still her fruits the worthy soil,
gyuth forth as due increase.
I pray therefore as long in course,
as Phoebus bright shall dure:
As long as flame shall give a heat,
and fish the seas procure.
And earth does give increase, so long
that thou thy years may tell:
And lead a happy joyful life,
in blisfull state, farewell.
To a Friend requesting his opinion in marriage, he answers thus.
WHen ryped years in wisdoms school,
in maridge feign would match,
By daily doom these precepts vewe,
to escape the bayted snatch.
Perpend the grace, the trust and trade,
of foreobteyned wife:
Her manners mark, with wary mind,
respect her wanton life.
Her mothers mind and nature scan,
with fathers factes also:
As is the Uine, such is the sap,
that on the grape does gro.
Beware the route of rolling eyes,
which secretly does pry:
When shamefastness is put to flight,
then grace begins to fly.
The virgin chaste of stowing time,
no hour will idle spend:
Lucretia applyde her pains,
her corpse from vice to fend.
Penelope at distaffe spoon,
her undefiled thread:
Until her long desired mate,
approchde to spousall bed.
For idleness consumes the lims,
and breeds vices vain:
No Matrone chaste, no grace there is,
where sleing sloth does reign.
Thy soul it spoils, thy life it spilles,
it weakeneth stayed strength:
The mighty holds, and trimmest towns
it draws to ground at length.
Refuse therefore such mate to match,
though fair she be of face:
For inward vice, with colors spread,
does outward vewe disgrace.
No credit give to other men,
to choose a wife of fee:
For often that other men displeasth,
may pleasant seem to thee.
If love be linckt, and mate be cursed,
and bend her frowning brow:
Apply thy tongue to sugared speech,
that she may leave to crow.
Exhort, persuade, desire, entreat,
and pray her still to be:
Embrace her corpse in loving arms,
and friendly amity.
And sweetly kiss, her cherrie cheeks,
with gentle gifts her deck:
And close thy hands most lovingly,
about her Iuorie neck.
Thus seek all says her sore to salve,
by good and honest way:
If this help not, but froward fem,
will stiffely stand astray.
Then pleasant speech suppress, and feign
a sower unsavory look:
As though thou would devour the walls,
and hang the house on hook.
With bitter words beswindge this dame,
let no persuasion lack:
Let homely stripes sometimes on fall,
on young unruly back.
But modest be, thy strokes to strike,
let reason rule thy rate:
If few serve not, her heart to help,
thou may repent to late.
Take faithful spouse of humble heart,
and graft, in godly grace:
Grave wise, discreet, lernd, meek, and one
that beauty bears in face.
Who does forgo her dearest friends,
and parents leauth each one:
Her self, by troth she freely plight,
to husbands power alone.
In kylling cares, both sick and whole,
she faithful is to thee:
She is thy joy, and comfort sweet,
though rich or poor thou be.
She will obey at all commaundes,
in storms and cruel smart:
In mirth, in grief, in pouerishment,
she bydes and takes her part.
If fierce disease shall crase thy corpse,
her wylling help she dightes:
She cherishes thee, she sweetly speaks,
she watchth both days and nights.
When crooked age shall creep on thee,
with stealing steps so blife:
She still prouides, she runs and goes,
to heal thy sicklye life:
Of bodies two, one corpse is made,
so linckt in lotted love:
Which streming storms and bitter blast,
can not by pains remove.
Yea after death she life does lend,
when pale thou rotst in ground:
In sons by her thy formed face,
may always plain be found.
So that thy corpse and shape be form,
with long retained name:
Do flourish fresh as springs the flower,
to thy long byding fame.
But who so lapt in living lewd,
with harlots vile remain:
These fruits does lose, with name and fame,
and spends his goods in vain.
Defame shall eke abridge his days,
corruption corpse shall slay:
And lyuers lewd, sure God will judge
no doubt another day.
When as the vile and stinking Goats,
shall pass to endless woe:
To fiery forkes and flames of hell,
in Limbo lake byloe.
By proof these rules of marriage,
I do not surely know:
But men of more experience,
the same to me did sho.
Which I for thee my tried friend,
by pain of simple quill:
Have rudely set in this poor verse,
for want of cunning skill.
Few care for the soul: all for the body.
WHen as the crased corpse,
in groaning bed does lie;
The skillful art of phisicks cure,
is sought for by and bie.
Which right prescribes rules,
that thou must needs observe:
By passing pains which thou do keep,
though thou therefore should sterue.
Such bitter brunts thou bearst,
thy bodies health to have:
But who will take a little toil,
his sickly soul to save?
No, carnal men in cares,
are carnally ybent,
All gape for gain, there is no God,
but God make us repent.
To his Friend Tho. Howell.
WHere often the floods do floe,
upon the beaten banck:
Their sands debar the grass to groe,
to spread his April spranck:
And where the son does march,
upon the greened grass:
In time it will the pasture parch,
as though it never was.
So where the son bright friends,
my Howell hauntes to hit,
There used life in present winds,
will keeper clean forget.
Their daily floods of talk,
shall ouerflow thy grass:
That keeper has obliuious walked,
as though he never was.
And reason it is I mean,
why should thou keeper keep:
Since thou may lose in keeping him,
that nothing can but sleep.
For sleepish dumps me shut,
from taste of cunning style.
Nor can I boult my rudeness out,
which lies on rustie file.
Yet hold in mindful mood,
our ancient amity:
For faithful friends give present salve,
for all the cares that be.
An answer.
NOt floing floudes, the feeble banck that frets,
Nor swelting heat, whose flames ye pastures fry
Nor slipprie sand which faint foundation lets,
Thy Howell once may cause from thee to wry.
Ne shall the show of shining sun bright friend,
By used life or phrase of filed talk,
Have power to put my keeper out of mind,
Whose tried truth may not obliuious walk.
And where thou seemst to say that sluggish sleep,
Has shut thee forth from taste of learned lore,
From out they muse as from a Fountain deep,
Does flow the fruits of Lady learnings store.
Thy wit, thy works, thy verse and stately style,
Thy ways, thy deeds, who well does scan and view:
Shall find therein: naught forste with rustie file.
Though I want skill to give thee praise that's dew.
Our lincke of love: and friendship fixed so fast,
Thy Howell howldes whylst lim and life shall last.
The vanity of riches.
THe stately Palace princely pight,
the hoord of glistering Gold:
The patrimony largde of lands,
cannot from sickness hold.
Nor can they cure the crased corpse,
or glad the mind at all:
For who has most of such a store,
the more he fears as thrall.
Gold is the father to the flock,
of flatterers by lot:
It is the sum of grief or woe,
who bath, or has it not.
For who it has, he quakth in fear,
lest fortune rob his thrift:
Who has it not, laments because
he knows not how to shift.
Wherefore of rich or poor I judge,
as wisdom small I hent:
In best estate is he, with his,
that lives always content.
An Epitaph made upon the death of the right Honorable, the Lady Gartrid late
Countess of Shrewisburie.
THe steling sting of gasping death
that byth by fatal force:
To bring unto the wailed grave,
this Countess courteous corse,
Had thought to thrust his spiteful spear,
to wound this Fem to die:
And quite to dim this glorious Gem,
the flower of courtesy.
And cloth her corpse in shrowding sheet,
to work her endless woe:
But O thou death, thou art deceaude,
for that is nothing so.
Nor can thou mar, or stop the trumpe,
that soundes her during fame:
More health then harm, more bliss then bale,
to her, by thee there came.
For she has light in lasting life,
of endless joys ywis:
So where thou thoughst to spoute thy spite,
thou have her brought to bliss.
So envy gave thee not the power.
thy malice mad to fill:
But thou have done this Countess good,
unawares against thy will:
For now her noble name shall bide,
in sounder sovereignty:
And after death does virtue live,
O death in spite of thee.
For she of grace the garlande gay,
in goodly gifts did wear:
Whose flowers do now in children wise,
of Talbots line appear.
Of Rutlandes race she nobly sprang,
and linkt with peerlesse pearl:
Of Shrewisburie, who bare the name,
a noble worthy Earl.
Whom she has left behind among,
the blessed branches fine:
The worthy imps that sprang of them,
as of a virtuous Uine.
To poor, she was a pleasant port,
to all a help she came,
By tears that have been spent for her,
the poor have shewde the same.
O noble heart whose Well of grace,
shall spring and never dry:
Who being hie, did bend thy breast,
unto the poorst degree.
Unto the weak she was a strength,
unto the hungry food:
Unto the rude, a lamp of light,
unto the wisemen, good.
Unto the youth, she was a guide,
unto the aged joy:
Unto the noble, ornament,
unto the blind, a way:
In town she was a shyning star,
for her all better were:
In Country joy, at home a glass,
to vewe in gladding chere.
Her beauty great, her virtues greatst,
that sprang as flagrant flowers:
Alas what treasure have we lost,
for all the loss is ours.
For she has gainde O Death by thee,
but we have shipwreck made:
And now in earth our help is lapt,
our light is turnde to shade.
O what a loss: so many gifts,
of grace so lost in one:
For which each wight that knew her well
cannot but greatly moan.
But dry ye up your dreerie tears,
she lives without anoy:
O comely courteous Countess now,
farewell O Iem of joy.
Farewell O spring of virtues sweet,
farewell of help the store.
Both high and low, bewail thy want,
farewell for evermore:
Of ingratitude.
WHo rightly scans what thing is greatest grief
And seeks by proof the truth thereof to try,
Shall surely find ingratitude the chief,
Surmounting far each other woe on hie.
Whose freting force when friendly wight shall feel
All mirth and joy to care does straight conuart.
Yea wear the heart of craggie flinte or steel,
It scarce could shoonne to wail such bitter smart.
Who therefore seeks by pains to please the proud,
Unthankefull wight compared well may be,
To him that kepes a Cur which barks as loud,
At Feaders face as when he foe does see.
Or Viper eke, who long with careful thought,
In woeful womb, her tender younglings feeds,
By whom at last her balefull bale is wrought,
Through their ingrate and most unfriendly deeds.
Whose nature is to work the place most grief,
Where they in time have had full great relief:
Of all ingrate lo here the gotten gain,
And only hyre for well deserved pain.
Of Death.
SInce death does lead to life,
And life is lasting joy*
To stay why make men strife,
Where naught is but anoy.
Answer.
WHy men such strife do sow,
To stay in place of pain,
Where you the cause would know,
I guess its worldly gain.
And since the flesh is frail,
Each weak and feeble wight:
When death does once assail,
Resistes with all their might.
Then blame not wealthy wights,
Which knows of need no lack:
But live in deep delights,
To die though they draw back.
When needy soul in deed,
Of death does stand in dreede.
To one that feign would speed, yet doubtful to proceed.
AS Cat would feign eat fish,
Yet loath her foot to wet:
So lie thou still and wish,
Where travail gain should get,
That labor first brings gain,
Thou see by little Ante:
Who through whot Summers pain,
Does shoon cold winters want.
The sweet that Be does suck,
Comes not by lying still.
The grapes for wine men pluck,
Are got by travails skill.
The Merchant eke men know,
Great goods by travail gains:
The Plowman seed does sow,
To reap reward for pains.
Not wish I say therefore,
But travail wealth does win:
Who so then will have store,
By travail must begin.
Strong monstrous mounts to reele,
Rough craggie rocks to rent:
And eke the sturdie steel,
Often travail makes relent.
For travail is the way,
Each noble gift to gain:
Use therein no delay,
And spare thou not for pain.
For who so pain does spare,
To speak where he would speed:
And makes each doubt his care,
A dastarde is in deed.
The Lover being in the Country, shows his good will to his Lady in the
Court.
THough corpse in Country be,
in Court my countnance is:
My joy, my care, my life, my death,
mine endless bale or blis,
My pleasure, pine, and pain,
my help my harm also:
My griping grief, my greatest gain,
my friend and eke my fo.
And doubtful though to some,
to scan this case may seem,
Yet you I know no wisdom want,
much deeper doubts to deem.
Wherefore I will omit,
my mind at large to tell:
Lest by the way some watchman lay,
to ring the larome bell.
Such spightfull spiders snares,
I aye do seek to shonne:
As not the foolish fly betraies,
but greater harms have done.
Who pufte with poison strong,
like Momus mates do still
Some discord cause and bate in place,
where else might grow good will.
But let them work their worste,
look what I have profeste:
If you command I will perform,
I spare to speak the rest.
And so I do conclude,
and cease my ragged rhyme:
As he that skill of school does want,
Pernasus mount to clime.
To his Friend. R. H.
WIth hateful hawtie haunt not,
For dainefull dizards daunt not:
For witless vaunters faint not,
For truthlesse taunters taint not.
For spiteful spiders spare not,
For curious carpers care not:
But Hussie as thou have begun,
Hold on thy race in virtue run.
The Lover to his L.
THe fiery flames, that fast on me do flow,
The secret sighs that wast my woeful breast:
The ysie cold I feel like flakes of snow,
The hidden harms that breed my great unrest,
By fancies force do cause such troublous tide,
That ship now shakes which late in road did ride.
Answer.
WHere reason rules, affection fond does fly,
And bewties beams no bitter bale may breed
Where wisdom will, by virtues skill does tie,
Cupidoes flames are quenched forth with speed.
Let reason then thy will by wisdom guide,
So shall thou safely shonne this trembling tide.
Gold corrupts.
THough most where wealth does flow,
Men fayning friendship show:
Yet faithful friend in deed,
Is known in time of need.
Answer.
BUt now we feel and find,
A thing to true in deed:
Where man be foe or friend,
The Gold and goods shall speed.
For virtues all are shut,
Unto the lower place:
And money loft is put,
Each learned head to face.
If money none thou have,
Thou art not worth a fly:
Thy credit clean is past,
All virtues hushed do lie.
A learned man, but poor,
Is counted doting fool:
Wise Virgill stands at door,
To go again to school.
Yet once I hope to see,
All money go for dross:
And virtue high to be,
To win her wrongful loss.
A Poesy.
Esteem a friend,
Let virtue crease:
In friendly mind,
Sometime is peace.
As flowers spring,
But sone do fall:
Even so each thing
Terrestrial.
Hope feeds heart,
Ere love take place:
Breed not a smart,
Right to disgrace.
As joyful lot,
Does me assign,
By goodness got,
O joy is mine.
Uaine nay, if me,
Refuse me here:
Nay sone shall see,
Each wound me teere.
The uncertainty of this world.
AS Player plays on stage till part be done,
So man alike his race one earth does run.
To day alive in silks and fine array,
To morrow dead and cladde with clot of clay,
Of earthly things, lo here the slipper stay.
A diet prescribed to his Friend G.
MY friend to hold thy harmless health,
a diet must thou keep:
As phisicks Art shall thee instruct,
men first did learn to creep.
Abstain thou still to feed thy flesh,
which swelles in pampred pride:
Tabstaine from sin a mean there is,
as fathers old have said.
And first all noisome lothed meat,
that white is do eschew:
As lime and paper, tallow, chalk,
and from all partchment new.
From all meat sharp, as dagger swords,
with knives and sharped spears.
From black, as tar, and tar box, pitch,
and sut that chimney smeares.
From hard, that cannot well digest,
as millstone timber flint:
But chiefly fly a female fool,
O woes that do not stint.
From all meat light as feathers, flocks,
fine down and sifted hay:
From heavy things, as lead and tin,
with brass and iron aye.
From all meat soft, as wool and flax,
bombaste and winds that bloe:
From things but gross as steeples, towers,
trees walls and many more.
From things but lean as rakes and forkes,
with wodcocks bills and brain:
With pothookes potled, whetstone smoth,
all these are vices vain.
Alution.
O be not white through envious wrath,
against the captives wise:
Nor be thou sharp to sorrow them,
least black as pitch thou rise.
Nor be thou hard unto the poor.
nor light to credit lies:
Nor heavy be to press down wit,
till truth the matter tries.
Go not to soft in slothful sort,
to men of antique store:
And leave the wits that grosser be,
which are but lean in lore.
Pluck down no house, nor pen things false,
nor grease thy book with gloss:
Seek no man's death by envious sting,
for witless men be those.
Flee doctrine false which makes thee black,
to lurck in loathsome hell:
Seek not to far that God has hid,
fools brains be never well.
Let chastity, prayer, abstinence,
direct a christian sheep,
No Pastor light Christ's flock must have,
but men most grave them keep:
Depaire no Church, nor ancient act,
in building be not sloe.
Convey you not to other realms,
the fruits that here do groe.
Flee foolish guides that roue at large,
which truthlesse tongue do strain:
As potled tales they prate aloft,
so the end will prove but vain.
To fast and pray, to help the poor,
to profit all with good:
This is a healthful physic note,
to stop the lusty blood.
The Rose.
WHen as the myldest Month,
of ioly June does spring:
And Gardens green with happy hue,
their famous fruits do bring.
When eke the lustiest time,
reuiueth youthly blood:
Then springs the finest featurde flower,
in border fair that stood.
Which moves me to say,
in time of pleasant year.
Of all the pleasant flowers in June,
the red Rosse has no peer.
Of Gold.
O Gracious Gold,
Whose glittring hie:
Does cheer and hold,
Each gazing eye.
The sweet delight,
That dwelles in thee:
Does spoil each spite,
And poverty.
It liftes aloft:
Who late was lo:
And fool makes often,
For wiseman go.
What joy, what gain,
What worldly thing,
Does want to them,
That Gold do bring?
Gold builds towns,
Gold makes joy:
Gold cheereth clownes,
Gold quelth anoy.
Gold all can do,
Gold reigns alone:
Alas what woe,
Where Gold is none.
Which I poor wight,
By proof do see
Which gladly seek,
That will not be.
But well I wear,
If I might catch,
White silver clear:
Which all men snatch.
The lover forsaken, bewayleth his estate.
O Drooping heart deprest with deadly care,
whose stretched strings be cracked in pieces small*
Thy secret sighs thy panting often declare,
What heavy hap in woe to thee did fall:
Now cry thou clapped in chains as captive thrall,
What heart can joy alas in misery,
To bear the blasts, that well he would not see?
The burdened Ass does know his crib by course,
The yoked Ox does smell his strawie stall:
The ridden horse the maunger gives remorse,
But my poor heart no salve may heal at all.
Whom furious force aye threatens fearce to fall.
What shall I say, the time each truth shall try:
Till then I wail my woe with weeping eye.
Down deep does droope my dread most dolorous.
O heart dispatch to end my hidden pain:
Shall good for harm be had in credit thus,
Each honest mind with rattling rage to strain?
Then farewell joy, welcome my woes again,
O what a woe is this in grief to groan,
And wail the want, where help I see is none.
Being between two doubts, he takes aduisement.
MY pen now plie thy pase,
thy masters pains to paint:
For heart now set in doubtful case,
begins to fall and faint.
Now wit declare thy might,
now hands and learning shoe:
What best for me a woeful wight,
that weeps and wayles in woe.
Much better it is to stay,
than clime and take no hold:
And rashly grant by deadly lure,
unto her love so cold.
For where two minds are matchte,
and the one no love will bear:
There is naught else but sorrows hatched,
Thy restless life to wear.
What vailes the glittring Gold,
when love is forcde to flee:
And match with her that others hold,
and naught regards thee.
And she thy eyes so blacks,
by wile of subtle kind:
That though thou see her crafty knacks,
yet will she make thee blind.
Though thousands thou possessed,
and heart does hold in hate:
All shall decay by wretchedness,
for ill will breeds bate.
But where as love remains,
and discord put to flight:
There springs the fount of joys and gains,
and concord stands in might.
There is the Paradise,
and Palace eke of peace:
Where things but small of simple prise,
to valoures great increase.
But out alas I die,
a wretch in dangerous doubt:
I see that death before mine eye,
has siedgde me round about.
For heart that loves me best,
I cannot love again:
And she who causes mine unrest,
considers not my pain.
Lo how can I escape?
Alas what remedy:
The Gods have sure, sworn my mishap,
between these golfes to die.
To bruise my baned bones,
betwixt these raging rocks:
In doubt of life I make my mones,
and bear the cruel strokes.
But heart thy self content,
to fry and freese a while:
Though fickle fate be froward bent,
yet fortune once may smile.
He shows his restless mind tormented for want of relief.
ALone who sails the foming floodes,
in ship that wants a guide:
In stormy streams and thundering showers,
in dark and trembling tide:
Does fear the harms of gaping golfes,
and renting rocks does moan.
And wayles his most unhappy state,
in tears and hearty groan.
So I vphoyst by wyffling winds,
in worser state then he,
Do bide the brunt of bitter blastes,
and all alone for thee.
Alone for thee this servile yoke,
on labring neck I bear:
For whom I often do wish to die,
me wretched wight to wear.
I wail in tears the whole day long,
as my poor heart does know:
At night again my bed I wash,
with sobs of doleful show.
Ierie and moan, I rage and run,
no food delight my part:
No Music note or harmony,
can help, my helpless heart.
O spill me not, that yield to thee,
if ought misdone I have.
By great entreat and humble sule,
my pardon here I crave:
If mercy none thou have, then give,
thy dreadful dome forth on.
And sone thou shall of man condemnde,
see execution.
Liberty corrupts youth.
BY license lewd, we still are worse,
When youthful hearts do rau^ge their corse.
Whose life to launche at liberty,
Brings rich estate, to poor degree.
The languishing Lover to his Lady.
HEalth I thee send, if he may give,
that which himself does miss:
For thy sweet breast does harbor whole,
my bloody bale or bliss.
I need no scribe to scrie my care,
in restless rigor spread:
They that behold my changed cheer,
already judge me dead.
My baned limbs have yielded up,
their wonted joy, to die:
My helthlesse hand does naught but wring,
and dry my dropping eye.
The deathly day in dole I pass,
a thousand times I crave:
The noisome night, again I wish,
the doleful day to have.
Each hour to me most hateful is,
each place does urge my woe.
No food me feeds: close up mine eye,
to ghastly grave I go.
No phisicks art can give the salve,
to heal my painful part:
Save only thou, the salve and sore,
of this my captive heart.
Thou have the form that cut the wound,
of my vnholpen pain:
Thou can and art the only help,
to heal the same again.
In thee my wealth, in thee my woe,
in thee to save or spill.
In thee my life, in thee my death,
does rest to work thy will:
O salve thou then my secret sore,
since health in thee does stay:
And grant with speed my just request,
whose want works my decay.
Because no answer was returned in long time.
WHen shall this needless silence end,
thy peeuishe pen to try:
Why, shall the wound unstopped bleed,
in woe continually?
Correct this fault, this only one,
then all thy body blessed:
Shall have no spot or fault at all,
for noble is the rest.
H. to K. his Friend.
O Friend in truth to try,
thy cunning skill I crave:
To help and cure my careful case,
that brings my corpse to grave.
To thee I do confess,
the grief that gripes my heart:
For lack of that which some possess,
my countnance may me smart.
Though naught I fear despair,
yet give me salve for sore:
My hands, my heart, my might my mind,
are fixed for evermore.
I. K. to his Friend H.
WHat needst thou thus to cry and care,
before the stroke does fall:
And eke to seek a saving salve,
where is no wound at all.
To for see lurcking euilles in time,
yet count I wit discreet:
To bend thy bow ere broyle be made,
also I deem it meet.
But pass thou not for moltring muck,
the pestlent poole of woe:
No grief, no grudge, no broyle or bate,
but does from penny groe.
The grave and wise Philosophers,
as Serpents fled the same:
And will thou then a christen man,
therewith go spot thy name?
Even now me thinks I hear thy sound,
soft bussing at mine ear:
Which says necessity compelles,
to get this worldly gear.
For when we want who well may live?
But if we bound in store:
Commodities then offreth made,
a salve for every sore.
Our credit eke the same does crease,
our friends the better are:
Who meets rich man but him salutes,
cap of and head full bare:
If thou have goods thou may obtain,
thy worthy countnance bent:
Alas my friend is it lack of dross,
that breeds thee wrong contempt?
No no not so I answer thee,
necessity is small:
With little store is nature fed,
it craves no hoord at all.
Nor shall thou want but may live well,
though not abundance floe:
He s^ekes no mean that still is bent,
on hilke heaps to groe.
If great be wealth, yet none be thine,
a steward God thee made:
If none thou have, lament thou not,
but rather be thou glade.
Because thou clean delivered art,
of great and heavy pack:
And eke thou have another day,
a less account to make.
But hope thou well: the sparrowes small,
our God has care to see:
And think thou then O faythlesse man,
that God forgets thee?
Can riches make thee wiser man?
or good or learned more:
Or virtuous or younger man?
alas these helps be poor.
But men will kneel and crouch to thee,
lo yet how fond we play:
They honor not thy person man,
but goods and clothes so gay.
But goods get friends, but none of thine,
they faune and flatter free:
If fortune frown, these trusty gestes,
will scantly stand to thee.
The truth it self has verified,
a richmans case to try.
What Camel can creep out with ease,
even at a needles eye?
What store of wealth enriched thee,
when from the earth thou came?
What riches eke shall follow thee,
returning to the same?
Therefore my friend content with skill,
to cheer thy grieved mind:
For want of vile and clammy clay,
will countnance be unkind?
No, virtues shall maintain thy store,
that never shall thou lack:
Shall pelting trashe a worthy heart,
from earnest love drive back?
Then let not want of wealth that rottes,
so pinch in pyning plight:
No glittring Gold no heaped horde,
can virtue put to flight.
Thy wit, thy works, thy heart and grace,
thy skillful head so wise:
Thy just report by virtue got,
thy hidden qualities
Which lurcking lie in breast of thine,
but once I hope the same
Shall take the root to spring abroad,
to crease thy gentle name.
What shall I say? I will omit
with pen thy praise to paint:
Thou have the goods that ever dure,
my friend then do not faint.
Despair thou not, for thou have more,
then well thy self doste know.
No wealth thou wantst that true wealth is,
receive this salve I shoe.
If I could get to thy content,
though Venus face she had,
Though Pallas power, though Iunos wit,
in peerless jewels clad,
Though all the goods of Arabie,
with thousand thousands free:
She did possess, oh trust me well,
yet would I give her thee.
For would she have a prudent spouse,
in safety sound to be:
If I should choose, by practice proud,
believe me thou art he.
A Poesy.
SMall time has man on earth to stay,
In time therefore take heed I say.
Another.
AS Flowers fresh to day,
To morrow in decay:
Such is thuncertaine stay
That man has here always.
The Lover whose love begone in time of spring, declares how natures force
then works in every thing.
ALl things on earth do much rejoice,
In sweet return of pleasant spring,
The birds declare by their shrill voice,
When joyfully they sit and sing.
What pleasures great they take and find,
without anoy of storm or wind.
The nightingale then steps in place,
Whose cunning tunes exceed the rest:
The slaundrous bird eke shows her face,
In every nooke as bold as best.
The creking Crow and carrion Kight,
Not pass the spring without delight.
The Dooues which Venus birds men call,
And other foul of land and lake,
Full well do know the time is fall,
Wherein each thing, does wish a make,
Wherefore as nature them does bind,
Each one a Feere fayles not to find.
The Robine small, and peeping Wren,
The Tidie trim, and Titmus eeke,
Full fast themselves, do couple then,
And spares no sport that does them leeke.
The Sparrow hops from spray to spray,
Where he with Hen has pleasant play.
Each beast also: away does shake,
His weather worn, and winter hue:
And cheerfully their chosen make,
With happy hope do past pursue.
The wretched worms to join in joy,
In pleasant spring are nothing coy.
Since natures force does this appear,
In birds and beasts which be but brute,
To grant him grace, why should you fear,
Whom liking leads to tempt his suit.
Who seeks but that among the rest,
Which natures law does him behest.
A Poesy.
WHere vice abounds and virtue does abate,
No one thing stays in good or happy state.
Fly vice therefore and virtue do embrace:
Which will thee heave unto the highest place.
Being vexed with the care of the world, be comfort himself.
MY fantasy, tormenteth me,
for worldly thing to care:
How to provide, mine age to guide,
some steadfast land to bear.
Each time of day, these cares me stay,
but all I see is vain:
My brains to beat, these goods to get,
not one will ease my pain.
For every man, does what he can,
to rid himself from iagges:
And some by hook, and some by crook,
do fill their greedy bags.
All honesty is forced to fly,
and laws do hold their peace:
They care not how, so goods do grow,
their worldly carks to press.
A thousand slights each days and nights,
in head I do conceive:
Yet none I find, can serve my mind,
my worldly woes to leave.
For if I lack, and bare be back,
though wit and grace be great:
Yet credit dies, and worship flies,
no friends then shall thou get.
For now they do esteem men so,
as riches mounts on hie:
The godly mind, they set behind,
and virtues all do lie.
These things do warn, to void the harm,
some wealth in youth to peeke:
But yet alas, I Midas Ass,
this geere in vain do seek.
But why should I, thus woefully,
in cares my years dispende:
The thing to see, that will not be,
until that God it send.
Mark well in plight, the birds so light,
that finely fed, do sing:
They reap, nor sow, nor plow, nor more,
they want no earthly thing.
And vewe each hour, the little flower,
and Roses fresh that groe:
They card nor spin, on spindle thin,
their common deeds to shoe.
Yet Solomon, that Prince alone,
in all his royalty,
Was not so gay, as one of they,
of peerlesse sovereignty.
Short time God lend, our life to spend,
in this most wretched vale:
For space of hour, scant stand we sure,
from dart of death so pale.
The young truly, as sone may die,
as men of elder age:
All things are frail, and all shall quail,
as fire shall them discharge.
All dignity, is danger hie,
and poverty is hard:
All wealth is doong, no joys be long,
why should I then regard?
The man is blessed, that lives at rest,
in his estate content:
Who lacks no things, what more have kings,
of all his lands and rent?
I see full plain, that some whose pain,
have hoorded riches great:
By sudden glay, are whipped away,
for pains no fruit they get.
Then fantasy torment not me,
for human things so scant:
God will foresee, for his that be,
they othing shall not want.
Of Degrees,
THe higher estate, the greater fear,
The greater wealth, the lesser cheer.
The poor degree, that lives content,
He sings although his goods be spent.
And who can sing so merry a note,
As he that cannot change a grote.
That men ought to be promoted to dignity, only by worthy deeds.
NOt long descent and name,
does make a noble king:
But noble heart and factes of fame,
his royal state shall bring.
Nobility deflowres,
when deeds can get no grace:
To host and brag of ancestors,
it is a witless case.
For noble deeds of them,
account not for thy factes:
For thy own deeds shall thee commend,
and not an others acts.
Nor men deserve the crown,
and doubtie diadem.
By birth or wealth, less skill redowne,
by virtues great in them.
For Fortune may as then,
make kings as pleases her:
Since she the rich and noble men,
to scarlets can prefer.
But greatest gold give place,
to virtue left so frashe:
For gold wise men that know the case,
do count but trifling trashe.
In hearts be princes bold,
and not in golden chestes:
For that man rules, and is not ruled,
when this man ruled is.
Nor beauty fair can blase,
a kingly honor hie:
For that does vade as flowers do fall,
and sone that grace will die.
Let courage stout reply,
and valiant hearts inflame:
By puissance adventures try,
thy famous factes to frame.
Now sacked Troy is brent,
by proof of policies:
He is not meet of kings descent,
that like a cowarde flies.
Therefore he is a king,
that like a king does guide:
And though no kingdom be for him,
yet he is king in deed.
A Poesy.
Strange sight to see, what toil some worldings take
For slipper slime yt sone will them forsake:
Whose greedy guts, no reason may suffice.

The Lover to his L.
WHen that he saw of worthy fame,
chaste spouse by tried trade:
Who can depaint the passing game,
that then Ulysses made?
When Paris got the Iem of Greece,
his sportes surpassed then:
Who brought her home a flower of price,
unto his Country men.
With joys the Nightingale began raise,
her right recorded song:
Wherein she gettes the peerlesse praise,
The bushie birds among.
The Merchant made, with windy sails,
that richely turns again:
Does joy for gain of his auailes,
escaping deeper pain.
The ward and heir of noble lands,
when as his years are gone:
Is glad he scapes his tutors hands,
for which he gaped long.
Yet I in joys surmount them all,
and more it pleases me:
That to my hap thy lotte did fall,
as best it pleased thee.
For thee then is my joyful part,
and eke to do thee good:
Here thee inclosde I hide my heart,
and brewe my hearty blood.
Wherein such lively love behold,
that pen cannot express:
Nor can my tongue the same unfold,
my wyts descrie much less.
No truthlesse tales in thy dispraise,
that blockish brains can frame:
Shall turn my truth from thee awaies,
or spot thy giltlesse name.
Thou art my dear with virtues spread,
God thee in pleasures keep:
On thee I think on wakefull bed,
when others sweetly sleep.
I dream of thee in slumbring rest,
and think thou present art:
I think my self then surely blessed,
from thee loath to depart.
But when deluding dream does vade,
I sigh with groaning cheer:
Me seemth I do perceive thy shade,
alas thou art not here.
I grope about the wales for thee,
as to possess thee feign:
But at the last full woefully,
I see my fanside brain.
Farewell I say my only care,
God send it true to be:
That which my fancy did declare,
that lately dreampt of thee.
I. K. to his Friend H.
THe ship I saw but late bear lofty sail,
And martch amid the waves of waters wild:
Whose courage stout I deemde no storm might quail,
When I her vewde so fast and firmly field.
With tempest tossed his forste now sail to streeke,
And in her prime does houering harbor seek.
H. to his Friend K.
THough blustering blasts cause ship, to harber have
To whom the Seas with rigrus rage threats wrack,
Whose cables cut and ankers worn and wast,
Is forste streeke sail in this so great a lack.
When Neptune yet with mighty Mase in hand,
Shall stay the surge of furious foming flood:
This ship repairde may safely sail to land,
Naught dreding Eolus breath that was so wood.
So Howell hopes his howlk such port shall find,
When storms be past as will content his mind.
That learning and knowledge is surest riches.
Whom wealth does highst advance,
Often falls by some mischaunce:
But once win cunning skill,
With thee it stands still.
The Lover receiving no recompense for entire love compares himself to the
unlucky soldier.
THe Soldier still that wars,
in many a stormy shower:
Perchance returns without reward,
in most unlucky hour:
So I in soldiers trade,
to fight, to watch and ward,
And each way sought her once to please,
which gives me small regard:
For though I present were,
to do what she would crave,
Yet now an other shall possess,
the thing I thought to have.
Though I the toil did take,
this pleasant plot to plowe:
Yet others reap the finest fruits,
of my true tilladge now.
What, served not my love,
that breast so sweetly bare,
And shall I thus an woeful wretch,
be snapt in sugared snare?
Then may I groan in grief,
and eke abhor the place
Where first I learnde with earnest heart,
to love that graceless grace.
Is this your tried troth,
that sprang from rooted heart?
How frail is then the female flock,
that counterfeits their smart?
When all men do rejoice,
yea rude and brutishe beast:
Then I in cursed cares do dwell,
my carkes are more encreast.
The blessed birds do sing,
and Lady Ver retornes,
And pleasant sightes begin to grow,
among the thriftles thorns.
But yet do I lament,
with tears where I remain:
For that for troth and loyal love,
thou louste me not again.
Adue thou frosen heart,
and voice of hardened ire:
Yet tract of time shall try me true,
as justice does desire.
And since thou false have been,
that see and wilt not see,
Perhaps thou may as yet repent,
that thou forsookest me.
But linck where love does light,
thy course run out in this:
Take heed, sone whot, sone cold they say,
his love you yet may miss.
Not all that glistereth bright,
may bear the name of gold:
Nor he that says he loves thee well,
the truth perhaps has told.
Some love for riches store,
as commonly we see:
But never one I ever loud,
more then I loved thee:
But out alas farewell,
I did it to my cost:
I liude in hope but all in vain,
my labors all are lost.
Thou art my woeful wound,
and cause of all my smart:
Which doste me hate and clean refuse,
the love of faithful heart.
Now do I well perceive,
and prove it to my pain:
How great a grief it is to love,
and not be loud again.

Jack shows his qualities and great good will to Ione.
MIne own zweet Ione, let me not moan,
no more I thee require:
But as I crave, so let me have,
the thing I do desire.
And ich shall still, even at thy will,
be ready at thy hand:
To fling to spring and run at ring,
whilst ich am able stand.
With cap and knee, ich will serve thee,
what should ich more declare:
Thy mind to please, and body ease,
is only all my care.
Though icham not, zo zeemlie chwot,

How stout ich stood, with Robart Whood,
when Baldoone Uoke vetcht may.
And eke ich pas, both more and las,

Both Calfe and Cow, and our great Zowe,

Even at one time shall then be mine,
and eke our new wheelbarro.
Beside all this, ich shall not mis

That zawe no zunne, nor yet the moon,
of years cham zewer a score.
And all my Ione, shall thou alone,
at thy commaundment have:
If thou will let, me friscoles vet,
in place where ich do crave.
The Lover almost in despair, shows his great grief and craves redress.
THou art the branch that sweetly springs,
whose heart so sound and true
Can only cheer me woeful wight,
or force by want to rue.
Then give to me the sap I thirst,
which gift may give me joy:
I mean thy firm and faithful love,
whose want breeds mine anoy.
Remember yet the friendly words,
ypast between us twain:
Forget him not, for love of thee,
that sighs in secret pain.
I often do seem in company,
a gladsome face to bear:
But God thou know my inward woes,
and cares that rent me there.
And that I may gush out my grief,
in secret place alone:
I bid my friends farewell in have,
I say I must be gone.
Then have I fast with heavy heart,
in this my doleful case:
Where walks no wight but I alone,
in drowsy desert place.
And there I empt my laden heart,
that swelde in fretting moan:
My sighs and plaint and panges I tell,
unto my self alone.
What shall I say, do ask me once,
why all these sorrows be:
I answer true, O foe or friend.
they all are made for thee.
Once knit the linck that love may last,
then shall my dolors cease:
It lies in thee and will thou not,
the yielding wight release?
O would to God it lay in me,
to cure such grief of thine:
Thou should not long be void of help,
if twere in power of mine.
But I would run and raunge in storms,
a thousand miles in pain:
Not fearing foil of friends to have,
my Countnance whole again.
And will thou then all merciless,
more longer torment me
In drawing back, since my good help,
is only whole in thee?
Then send me close the hewing knife,
my wyder wound to stratch:
And thou shall see by woeful grief,
of life a clean dispatch.
When thou shall say and prone it true,
my heart entirely loud:
Which lost the life for Countnance sweet
from whom he never moude.
Write then upon my mournful toombe,
these verses graven above:
Here lies the heart, his truth to try,
that lost his life in love.
Lo, save or spill thou may me now,
thou sitst in judgment hie:
Where I poor man at bar do stand,
and loud for life do cry.
Thou will not be so merciless,
to slay a loving heart:
Small praise, it is, to conquer him,
that durst no where to start.
Then heal the heart that loves thee well,
until the day he die:
And firmly fast thy faith on him,
that's true continually.
Then shall I bless the pleasant plot,
where first I saw thy face:
And say the Gods have thee indude,
with gifts of goodly grace.
Whose virtues mixed with pity great,
her Counsel sought to save:
Who being void of her good help,
long since had line in grave.
I. K. at his Friends departure.
AGainst necessity,
there is no law they say:
But shall such need bereave perforce,
my dearest friend away.
No stroke does fall so fell,
But wisdom yet may ware:
So though my hope must needs begone,
yet this does crushe my care.
That he is only gone,
Utilitie to gain:
And still I Ho to see him well,
in joy returnde again.
His friends that freshely fare,
will not his heart refell:
God send thee safe thy souls desire,
to please thee passing well.
Then shall I yet rejoice,
that thou departst from me:
To set thy self in sounder sort,
as once I hope to see.
When as thou shall take rode,
within the Haven of blis:
Till then, to bear with patience,
the chiefest help it is.
God send thee well to do,
in due delight to dwell:
God send thee that thou most desirst,
Mine own good Ho farewell.
H. his answer to his Friend K.
PErforce though Pilate be
which hastes thy Ho. away
From pleasant port, where still behind,
his Iem of joy does stay:
Yea though the furious floodes,
his beaten bark do waste,
Which gaping gulfes often threatens sore
to swallow up in haste:
Yet distance none so great,
nor plundge of present pain
Shall cause me once my friend forget,
whilst life in lim shall reign,
Whose steadfast truth well tried,
whose golden gifts of grace:
Whose manly mind, whose friendship firm,
who lives and will not brace?
Let fortune work her worst,
and spoute her spightfull spite:
In wealth in woe in joy in care,
yet I in thee delight.
To whom ten thousand thanks
I yield for thy good will:
And where thou woulst me one good hap,
I wish thee twenty still.
Farewell O Titus true,
whose like were hard to find:
Farewell for faith a Phoenix firm,
O courteous Keeper kind.
A Poesy.
EXpend my words which soul with heart does write
Let that be loud which loves thee passing well:
In space comes grace, as worthy wits recite,
Soul heart and hand thou have no more I tell.
Attend on God and wait his will to work,
Be sober, wise, discreet in time and place:
Esteem a friend where earnest heart does lurk,
Try ere thou trust, and shonne no pooremans case,
Higher who clims, the deeper down he fell,
But set my broken bark in calm to starte:
Reject no right, lose not a heaven for hell.
Apply to purchase praise by due desarte.
Deride no wight, the best good aid may mend,
Beware betime, be wise, in courtesy:
Use time and place as may to virtue tend,
Right thus thou may thy praise amount on hie.
No wight, no wealth, no heart (but thou alone)
Enforces me at times to joy and moan.
To his C.
MY woeful heart with pinching pain oprest,
My careful corpse yclad with heaviness:
My restless lims, that takth no quiet rest,
Do wish for death the end of deep distress.
Why should I then prolong my days in pain.
Why do I seek to heal my helthlesse heart:
Or why does life in lanquisht limes remain,
And still increase my bitter bale and smart.
When heart when hands when corpse and soul to die,
Do willing yield as lothing longer life:
And death alone is end continually,
Of worldly woes of cursed care and strife,
Which fiercely flow on me to work my spite:
Since I of force must now for go thy sight,
Whose face to vewe was only my delight.
To his feigned Friends.
THough some perchance there be,
That would me gladly spot:
Yet shall they never see,
Such chance to light my lot.
Ne yet their crafty ways,
So closely clokte shall win
To them but little praise,
If once I do begin:
Hereafter comes not yet,
Ye^ ^^ce a time I trust:
Will serve wherein to meet,
With such as be unjust.
Wherefore these words I use,
I nothing need to tell:
Nor you thereon to muse,
Who knows my meaning well.
A Poesy.

To spend the day which does ensue,

FINIS.
A farewell to his Friend T. Hooper.
WHen as the soking sap,
crept up on spraies that budde:
And blosomde branch with goodly green,
began cloth the naked wood.
When Winters horie frostes,
mild March enforst to flee:
Then came my golden faithful friend,
and sweetly cheered me.
Whose face at first to vewe,
me musde full wounderous:
For I as soon had thought to see,
of Troy king Priamus.
He cheerde my drooping heart,
in heavy ^ap that stood:
With him to be, with him to talk,
was all my chiefest food.
Each drop of lively blood,
that skipt in springing veins,
Did leap for heap of passing sport
of heart, where joy remains.
Whom I have thirsted often,
in wishing heart full feign:
Now is he come, but O alas,
he sone is gone again.
And will thou now depart,
from me on sudden thus?
Then may I say all joy is vain,
and world grows worse and worse.
And though that flowers in May,
do cheer the laughing fields:
Yet winters storms with pinching cold,
the woods of leaves beguiles.
Thus change of time and place,
does change a man's degree:
And richest man in greatest joy,
may chance in woe to die.
So when the hour was come,
that hope returns me fro:
In heavy moning wayling heart,
farewell I say in woe.
Farewell my Damon dear,
now loath depart I sing:
And lingering steps against their will,
from thee my corpse did bring.
And down into my heart
there dropped the drops of care:
And inwardly my sobs I soope,
that rake and rent me their.
Now all my joy is gone,
and I in dumps am cast:
O would to God thy sweet abode,
might harmless ever last.
If will were now in force,
to thee my flight should be?
Where are the Muses nine that sing,
in heavenly harmony.
But now we must depart,
fair words false friend men say,
Nor he that files his smoothed speech,
is faithful friend always.
The God divine thee keep,
in firm felicity:
And break the bragges of curssed curres,
that jar their teeth at thee.
That so thy fatal threede,
well spoon may steadfast stan,
To run the race of Nestors years,
a golden aged man.
And farewell friend in deed,
farewell my tower of trust:
Would I might always bide with thee,
farewell since needs it must.
To his Froward Friend.
MEn say in common tales,
into a Proverb gone:
More better it is a badde excuse,
at all then to have none.
And was I in the blame,
you knew well what I meant:
And though I winkt in colourde sort,
you knew my whole intent.
If great your grace had been,
you might perceive well this:
For little signs are known full well,
where great affection is.
And eke of peering spark,
does grow a flashing flame:
Lo now I see you will not know,
though well you knew the same.
But of such woman's minds,
each man a store may find:
Which still in things that pleases not,
forsooth they will be blind.
And where they fancy not,
the thing they have in hand:
They say good Sir be packing hence,
I cannot understand.
And since it is your wont,
as plain I do perceive:
I pray you give me license now,
to take my humble leave.
For I must needs be dead,
but not before to morrow:
My death requires no ernest have,
I need not greatly sorrow.
But yet I lie in care,
I cannot sleep for love:
No more then he that sleeps all night,
and never once does move.
What shall I do poor soul,
alack how I do moan:
When that my stomach well is fed,
my lust to meat is gone.
Behold what care I take,
my tears do flow as fast:
As April showers do fall in June,
when will my plaint be past?
Alas good simple peate,
of dull and feeble brain:
You know not well the wood for trees,
God wot ye are full plain.
But easy truly it is,
your ignorance to show:
In things which by your froward will,
you never sought to know.
Farewell my friendly foe,
as plain God wot ye be:
So pray I once that you may have,
your two eyes well to see.
And well to understand,
of me your true love lost:
If blind ye be, smell yet before,
take heed beware the post.
I doubt not but in space,
you shall your sight obtain.
When as perchance you may desire,
your true love old again.
The opinion he has of his Friend absent.
THy right descent from worthy auncetrie,
Has justly got a praise by their good factes:
Of all, as well the high as low degree,
Much more yet got thou have by thy own acts.
As well thy works thy will, thy wit do teach,
Still seeking that, which passes not thy reach.
Like life thou leads, that poor for thee do pray,
Upon their knees thy gentle race to fend:
Their needy suits with helping hand to stay,
The thing which thou do prudently pretend.
Race rightly ruled, of breast in justice bold,
Each virtue seeks her harbor here to hold.
Lo what mishap has maimed me so sore,
Like one of thine that there I may not dwell:
Esteem me not the less of Dunster store.
Since heart is there, where care does corpse expel.
Quaint fortune frowns on me so egerlie,
Unnatiue soil that best I may not be.
Except my mind I do not thee forget:
Although far thence false fortune does me set.
Run rightly forth, as right thou have begoon,
Then trump shall sound you have the conquest won.
Fraunces Flower in the commendation of the Author.
THe Schools of skill maintained are,
by yonglings hot desire:
And (...) all decrepide playnth,
his Muses simple hier,
For Nature now is girte to give,
the price of mickle praise:
To such a wight so worthy wealth,
to pass his foundrisse days.
O happy hand to frame the moulde,
in each consenting part:
That dare when Muse most perfect is,
compare it self with art.
Pallas ycleped learnings Queen,
if Mars in armor were:
The fierce attempt of Natures will,
may well and well forbear.
For she alone can work her will,
as Lady of her list:
But feeble is the force of art,
where Nature does resist.
No light but of the heaven,
no fury but of hell:
No virtue if Minerua fail,
as science often does tell.
Then muse no whit to see a gift,
ygraft in this my friend:
Whose pleasant verse by natures skill,
to thee does pleasures lend.
The plunging mind in deep desires,
may here in arbor rare:
Bereave unrest with pleasures rife,
and rid his soul from care.
As Pamphlets for repast, present,
good will of writers part:
So Poems prove, and Poesies praise,
a well good wylling heart.
How due desert by just desire,
reward may truly crave:
The readers may consenting gree,
if Howell praises have.
FINIS.
F. Flowar.
