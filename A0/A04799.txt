love and mercy toward man: notwithstanding of man's perverse disposition and
continuallvnthankefulnesse toward his GOD.

The mercy of God is above all his works.

SONNET.
MY Muse Urania strain thy sacred voice
And lovingly in Faith and Zeal go sing,
Shrill hymns to Iovah: let thy Soul rejoice
In blessed Encomiums of that glorious King,
With Helleluiahs make the Heavens to ring,
By Faith, through clouds thy prayer so convoy,
That he who framde both thee and every thing,
Be pleased to shield thy Soul from sins annoy,
Shall thou not have great matter then of joy,
When thy Redeemer pardons all thy faults?
And thus in peace says to thee' come my boy,
I will defend thee from the Devils assaults,
Satan in thee no portion sure shall have,
For why, my blood from Hell thy Soul did save.
A THEOLOGICAL EPITOME OR DIVINE COMPEND.
WHen as Iehova did creat,
His last work most perfyte,
Like his own image made he that,
In it took such delight.
So Male and Female made he man,
this excl'nt work to grace,
The breath of life the LORD began
to breath into his face.
Thus Man being made a living Soul,
the LORD him power gave,
Over every fish, and beast, and foul,
and all things life did have.
Then GOD bade Man subdue the Earth,
increase and multiply,
And for Man's food the ground by birth,
the LORD did fructify.
A garden Eastward GOD did make,
in Edens fertile land,
Which neither tree nor plant did lack,
such was his blessed command.
In midst of this fair garden stood,
the tree of knowledge much,
To man the rest GOD gave as food,
but this, man might not touch.
The tree of life beside this was,
and fruitful trees for meat,
Whereof man might without trespass,
by Gods leave safely eat.
But, if the tree of knowledge fruit,
he taste, God did bequeath,
Man out of Eden he should root,
and cause him die the death.
Each soul and beast which God had wrought
as Gods command they came
Before the man: as man best thought,
to each he gave a name.
Then God to make he thought it best,
for man a help or aid,
Thus heavy sleep the man possessed,
which time the Lord convoyed,
A rib out of man's side, and made
A female of that bone,
Closd up the flesh again, and said
man should not live alone:
To man he brought his other part,
or second self, (quoth he)
Both bone and flesh of mine thou art,
thy name shall woman be.
Now man and woman naked were,
in Paradise this time,
And never ashamed till they did err,
committing sinful crime.
For now the Serpent (subtle beast)
persuaded Adams wife,
Forbidden fruit at his request,
to eat: and said her life
She should not lose: but God knows well
(quoth he) when you do taste,
This fruit; your knowledge shall excel,
and you as Gods be graced.
The woman thinking all was true,
the serpent to her spoke,
Disiring knowledge: she some few
forbidden fruit did take.
Thereof she ate and gave her mate,
and he did eat also:
Then did they see their own estate,
how they did naked go.
Therefore some fig tree leaves they took,
and sowed them altogether,
Made breeches thereof, now they look,
to run they know not whether.
For why? into the cool of day,
in garden they did hear,
GODS voice, where art thou Adam? say
most perfectly, come here?
When Adam came the LORD before,
he greatly was dismayde,
Saying, he naked was, therefore,
to come he was affraide.
That thou were naked who thee told,
(quoth GOD) that thou wast hid,
To eat the fruit have thou been bold,
which I did thee forbid?
Then Adam said to GOD again,
the woman thou gave me,
Gave it to me, and we amain,
did eat of knowledge tree.
(Quoth she) the Serpent me deceav'de,
in making me believe
Great knowledge I should have received,
when I did eat and give,
This fruit unto my husband here,
Moving him eat likewise,
Thus man who then to GOD was dear,
did first his law despise,
Then to the Serpent GOD spoke thus,
'cause thou this thing have done,
Above all beasts I thee accurse,
and cattle every one,
Thou on thy belly shall go still,
(O sentence true and just)
Since thou made man gainstand my will,
thou ever shall eat dust,
Betwixt thy seed, and woman's seed,
shall be enimitie,
Thou's bruise his heel, and he thy head
shall break assuredly.
And to the woman GOD said now,
thy sorrows I Will increase,
In sorrow forth thy children thou
shall bring with great distress.
Unto thy husband, thy desire
shall ever subject be,
And he as potent Lord or Sire,
shall still rule over thee.
But to the man thus spoke the Lord,
I Will curse earth for thy sake,
'Cause my command thou have abhorde,
the earth I Will barren make.
The earth thus cursd for man's offense,
God said: thereon thou's feed,
In sweat of face, and ever hence,
in sorrow shall eat bread,
Till to the dust thou do return,
of which thou first was framde,
This sentence should make man still mourn
and be of sin ashamde.
So, of Gods power let us cease,
to dispute of the same,
Who made man of earths superfice,
a rare and exc'lent frame.
Of basest thing in all the field,
God made flesh, blood, and boue,
To other things their form did yield,
by word and it was done.
Gods love in the creation old,
to man, his Saints still sing,
Who might have made man if he would
a beast or creeping thing.
And yet gave man a living spreit,
with wit did him indue,
Fish, Foul, and Beast, gave man for meat
and all on earth which grew.
Next, in prerogatives Gods love,
to man is eminent,
Who gave him rule all things above,
beneath the Firmament.
And causde him name each other Creature
according to man's will,
What ere they be in shape or stature,
that name they yet keep still.
Again Gods love may well be seen,
to man: who did him place,
In Edens garden ever green,
where he might him solace.
With Beasts Fouls Fruits and pleasant flowrs
each one of several dye,
Which were refresht by heavenly showers
and cherisht by Gods eye.
Yet more then this Gods love we find,
conspicuously appear,
To man-wards, who to man's own mind
made him a helper dear.
Lest he alone, might too much long,
and lest his kind should fail,
By this late help GOD made man strong,
and on the earth prevail,
Yet though from GOD these gifts man got,
as tokens of his favor,
The LORD perceaved man did not,
of true obedience savor,
Therefore in one thing he restrainde,
the man and that was this,
Forbidden fruit he him ordaind
forbear, lest that amiss,
Might out of Eden him eject,
from presence of his GOD,
Who then entirely did affect
man; sparing justice rod,
Till that in end through curious pride,
and covetice of wit
Wretcht man from Gods command did slid
and did his law omit.
Then forth the Lord ejected him,
to plow the barren ground,
In seas of woe he made man swim,
yet would not him confound.
Thereafter Adam Eva knew,
and she brought forth a son,
And called him Cain; this man slew
just ABEL being alone.
Then GOD to Cain said anon,
(who then in sin did sleep)
Where is thy brother ABEL gone?
Should I my brother keep?
(Quoth Cain) I no way can tell:
What have thou done? truly
Thy brothers blood thou did expel,
from ground cries unto me.
Therefore from earth thou art accursed,
who opened has her mouth,
And blood received, which did burst,
from ABELS wounds for truth,
So when thou plows the ground, her strength
she shall not yield to thee:
And thou a vagabound at length
still on the earth shall be.
Far greatter is my punishment,
than able I Am to bear
(Quoth Cain): for incontinent
who finds me far or near
Since I am from thy face cast out,
a runnagate made still:
Who first confronts me, without doubt,
most sure he will me kill.
Then God again this to him told,
who kills Cain: Sure
His punishment shall be seven fold,
which doubtless he is endure.
On Cain then God set a mark,
lest any kill him might,
Of Gods great mercy, thus the spark
was not quite out of sight.
Then Cain from the presence went,
of his most gracious God,
To Edens east side, where his tent,
he pitched in land of Nod.
So when that men were multiplied,
on earth, and to them borne
Were sons and daughters they espide,
(Gods sons I mean forlorn.)
That daughters of the men were fair,
therefore they took them wives,
Of all they liked every where,
with whom they spent their lives.
Therefore God said, my spirit shall
with man not always strive,
For he is but flesh subject to fall,
I Will him of life deprive.
At end of hundredth twenty years,
his days shall be no more,
Then from his eyes wypt shall be tears,
and rest his labor fro.
Giants there were on earth those days,
when Gods sons came (even then)
Unto men's daughters these always,
were strong and mighty men.
Thus when God saw the wickedness,
of man on earth was great
And that man's heart did still express.
bad thoughts: God grieved thereat.
And that he made man he repents,
and's sorry in his heart,
Because that man his whole intents,
from sin could nee're depart.
Therefore God said, I will destroy
from earth, and bring to naught,
The man, the woman, girl and boy,
and all that e're I wrought.
Yet Noah in Gods eyes found grace,
and walked with the Lord.
An upright man in every case,
was he: Scriptures record.
To him God said; Come is an end,
of all flesh me before:
And since that man will not amend,
but heaps up sins in store,
Thou therefore go, and make an Arc,
of Pine Tree I direct:
Pitch it both in, and out: remarke
that it have no defect.
For on the Earth I Will bring a flood
of waters from above.
Which shall of breath all things denude,
that on the earth do move.
Yet of each sort of living thing,
two I Will cause come to thee,
These thou into the Arc shall bring,
that they may saved be.
Gods mercy here is manifest,
to mankind who convoyde,
Him save through floods: of foul and beast
some seed keept vndestroyde,
He would not root all mankind out,
though man the same deservde,
For when the deluge raged about
the earth: he Noe preservde.
But when the flood was overpast,
and God did man restore,
In Noah: men increased fast,
yet did not God adore.
Then all the earth one language spoke,
each other understood,
And from the east they journey took,
in Shenars plain abode,
Each one to other said this time,
let us burn brick anon,
In stead of mortar they had slime,
and brick in stead of stone.
Then said they let us build a tower,
whose top to Heaven may reach,
Lest we be scattred in one hour,
now all were of one speech.
But from above the Lord did then,
the highest clouds come down,
When building were the sons of men,
to see their tower and town.
Then said the Lord, the people vow
and they all condescend,
To do this thing: nor can they now,
be stopped what they intend,
Let us their language then confound,
that never one perceive
Another speech: let shame redound,
to such as pride now have.
The Lord then scattred them from hence*
on all the earth abroad,
And they left off their building hence,
thus were they stopped by God.
The name of it they Babell call,
because the Lord did there
Of men confound the language all,
them scattering euerie-where.
But yet Gods mercy did extend,
here toward man likewise,
For though he did his God offend,
by this proud exercise.
Yet God his ruin never sought,
and yet he lets him see,
That man's best wit and strength is naught
without the Lords suppsee.
For even the Lord his own elect,
are subject unto sin,
As often it proves by effect,
of weakness them within.
Though God just Abraham did bless,
with graces manifold,
And did by signs and words express,
to him and Sarah old.
That he would make a nation great,
of them and of their seed,
Yet Sarah thought her old estate,
could no ways children breed,
Therefore within her self she laughed,
(for she did God mistrust)
Saying, since I am old, and fraught
with years: shall I have lust,
Therefore God asked Abram why
that Sarah his wife smilde,
Saying, since I am old, can I
in age, bring forth a child,
Shall any thing to God be hard,
at the appointed time,
Return to thee I Will afterward,
as one in youthful prime.
Sarah thy wise shall have a son,
but Sarah now denied,
That she had laughed, or such thing do^^*
for she was much affraide.
Thus may you see through lack of faith*
Gods own may him commove,
Yet taste they not his cup of wrath,
though he does them reprove.
Examples many more we see,
in Scripture how Gods flock,
Through their great infidelity,
him often to wrath provoke.
When Israelites by Moses hand,
from Egypt were conduct,
According to the Lords command,
as God did him instruct.
Hard by Pihahiroth, to grudge,
against Moses they began:
Asking why there he made them ludge,
to perish every man.
Was there in Egypt never a grave,
that thou broughtst us to die,
In Wilderness: for now we have
(Quoth they) no way to fly.
Hudge mountains are on (...)
the Sea is us before:
Proud Pharohs host behind us ride,
approaching evermore.
But God to Moses said (quoth he)
stretch forth thy rod, and so
The Seas shall soon divided be,
and on dry ground you's go.
But upon Pharoh and his host,
I will me honor get,
Who in their strength and chariots boast,
thinking they have no let.
For midst the raging floods profound,
without stop or delay,
His men and chariots I Will confound,
before your eyes this day.
As God had said, it came to pass,
when Israelits were gone,
The Sea returned where it was,
Egyptians died eachone,
In wilderness of Shur again,
they water found no where,
And then against Moses did complain,
when as they camped there.
TO Marah when they came at last,
they knew not what to think,
The waters had so bitter taste,
thereof they could not drink.
This place was Marah calde to name,
or bitterness: for why?
The bitter taste from water came,
no Isralite could try.
And now against Moses, murmr fast
those people vndescreet,
Till GOD show him a tree, which cast
in waters made them sweet,
An ordinance GOD made them hear,
and here the people proved
Of all the world to him most dear,
and best of him beloved,
Yet when to wilderness of Sin
they came, (betwixt Sinai
And Elim) they again begin,
to murmr and to cry
Against Moses and Aaron the Priest,
wishing that by GODS hand,
In Egypt they had died at least,
when ere they left that land;
For when (quoth they) by Egypts pots
we sat: well stuffde with flesh,
The bellies full of bread, (GOD wots)
we eat, did us refresh.
Now GOD at evening store of quail
sent them; the morning tide
Great store of Manna, without fail,
lay on the mountain side,
Six days they did the same collect,
for each an Omer full,
Here men may mark a strange effect,
though that their brains be dull.
GODS providence to them was such,
when they collect this meat,
None had too little nor too much,
to spare or yet to eat,
The sixth day they collected still,
as much as served the morn,
The seventh, or Sabbath day, GODS will
was it should be forborne.
Yet diverse went that day to prove,
to find it on the ground,
But GOD the occasion did remove
of sin, for none was found.
Some others heapt it up therefore,
though GOD did them forbid,
Vild crauling worms they got in store,
in that which they had hid.
And yet into their Sabbaths food,
though it was a long kept,
GODS providence to them was good,
no vermin therein crept:
At last they came to Rephidim,
where they did much annoy
Their GOD: for now they rail on him,
that did them there convoy.
Because they could no water find,
they murmurde at the first,
Against Moses, saying is it thy mind,
to kill us here with thirst,
Then Moses cryde unto the LORD,
saying what shall I do,
This people all with one accord
to stone me almost go,
Then GOD again to Moses spoke,
and there did him direct
Elders of Israel to take,
and rod of great respect
Into his hand, wherewith He smote
the river: for behold
Thy name I will still save from blotte,
as I have often thee told.
In Horeb on the rock I Will stand
before thee; thou shall smite
The Rock with rod, then I Will command
the water out come quite,
That all the people then may drink,
then Moses did so right.
Then through the Rock the waters sink,
in Isreal's Elders sight.
Then Massah called he the place.
and Maribah, because
Of Isreal's contentious case,
whose temptings had no pause.
Now by those proofs we may perceive*
that GODS great mercy yet
Is toward man, though he as slave
to sin, does sin commit.
Though Sarah old did misbelieue,
GODS promise to her made,
And through weak faith her God did grieve
God kept what he had said*
Though Heaven and earth shall pass away
and stars, and Sun and Moon,
GODS blessed Word shall near decay,
what He speaks shall be done.
For at appointed time he came,
which Sarah thought o'regone,
And did return to Abraham,
and Sarah had a son:
In whose seed are the Nations blessed,
of all the spacious earth,
In whom we live, we move and rest,
blessed be that Virgin birth.
The covenant which GOD did make,
with Abraham He kept,
For Abrams seed did never lack,
things needful, though they slept.
And though they did their GOD offend,
for Abrams sake, therefore
Though GOD in Egypt did them send,
He guards them evermore.
And when their number greater was,
that Pharoh waxt affraide
Of them, yet would not let them pass,
but still their journey staide,
GOD then in Egypt wonders wrought,
and by his mighty hand,
Through the red sea his people brought,
drowned all did them gainstand:
Yet at Pihahiroth and Shur,
at Marah and at Sin,
And Meribah they made great stir,
murmuring themselves within:
Though so they did, and that God swore,
that these should not enjoy,
The fertile land was them before,
GOD did their seed convoy;
For Abrams sake, to that same land,
which He to him had sworn
To give his seed, to whom as sand
in number should be borne.
Thus may we see GODS clemency,
was, is, and does remain
Still toward ingrate man, though he
can never from sin refrain,
We see GODS people whom He lovde,
did tempt Him every way,
The justest man that ever movde,
seven times does sin a day.
Then happy are they who die young,
they fewer sins commit,
Yet babes who lack the speech of tongue,
are not found free of it.
For though they are free of actual sin,
yet sin original,
Which did in Paradise begin,
to hell will bring us all,
Unless GODS mercy us prevent,
by Faith into CHRIST'S blood,
We have our lives in sin so spent,
naught else can do us good.
For since Adam and Eve did sin,
and toward GOD rebel,
In them did then our sin begin,
by which we merit Hell:
And if a man though never so strong*
do wrong but one his like,
Must he not satisfy that wrong,
or else let justice strike;
Much more then man offends his GOD,
who is party both and judge,
And in His hand holds justice rod,
where can man have refudge?
Likewise our fault is found so great,
we can it never amend,
Therefore Gods justice does us threat
with shame and fearful end.
But here Gods mercy does prevail,
and pacifies his wrath.
He satisfaction for our fail,
desires and not our death.
But what way can we satisfy,
Our God for our offense,
Our lives, yea souls, in no degree
our miss can recompense.
Yet since God sees that we no way,
can expiate his ire,
He pities us: if we assay
to do his blessed desire.
And then himself the way finds out,
himself to pacify,
Gods mercy great is without doubt,
here toward man we see.
For why the Lord the balm does find,
to salve up Satan's wound,
Which men could never call to mind,
who most in wit abound.
CHRIST'S precious blood it is the balm,
that salues each Soul its sore,
And makes sins surging seas be calm,
which Satan's rage made roar.
It is the ransom must us save,
from Satan, hell, and death,
The means to raise us from the grave,
to gain eternal breath.
So since we see the LORD does please
to save those who repent,
And salve their sin-sicke Souls disease,
through grace when they relent,
Then let us strive Him to obey,
and glorify His name,
Who loves not see His children stray,
nor yet to suffer shame.
In sinners death the LORD of bless,
does not delight, believe,
For He has sworn, that He does wish
them to repent and live.
He bids them knock, He open shall,
ask, and they shall receive,
Seek, and they will find, and this is all
that any heart can crave.
Should then not we our GOD still love,
who both our horn exalts?
And for our well, who from above,
beggs pardon for our faults,
If that a man condemnde to die,
were saved by a Knight,
Or some great man, would then not he,
serve that man day and night.
Through sin we are condemnd to hell,
the great and second death,
GOD who in mercy does excel,
us saues by sacred Faith;
And more than this, His only Child,
He gave unto the cross,
For our offenses great and vild,
the guiltless life did loss.
And whilst his life they took away,
Our Blessed LORD said so,
Forgive them FATHER I Thee pray,
they know not what they do.
Should we not then still endevore,
to serve the LORD of life,
Who has us saved evermore
from death and Satan's strife,
Who framde us likewise all of naught,
and did our Souls redeem,
From death and hell, whilst Satan sought
of bless us to exeeme,
For first our GOD graunts to receive
amends for our misdeed,
And since amends He cannot have,
Himself finds the remeed.
And last of all, He is content,
Himself the mends to make,
And for our sins He does assent,
His own Sons life to take,
What obligation then have we,
toward our gracious LORD?
Who has from hell thus set us free,
O then in one accord!
In Faith, and love with hearts contreit,
let us our spirits raise,
And yield to Father, Son, and Spreit,
Thanks, Honor, Glory, Praise.
FINIS.
