Remember man both night and day.
Thou must needs die, there is no nay.

THy mortal body formed of clay,
Will sone reuolue and pass a way:
But yet the time, hour, or day,
Uncertain is, wherefore I say.
Remember man.
In youth or pleasure,
if thou put thy trust,
In honor, treasure, or yet in lust:
Sone all thy joy shall turn to dust,
For remediless hens thou must.
Remember man.
All high estate and dignity,
Pomp, glory, wealth and soueraintie:
It can not prolong thy life pardie,
But all shall turn to vanity.
Remember man.
The mo thy years, the shorter is thy life,
Against death there is no strife:
And no kin, friend, child, nor wife.
For thy pore will be pensife.
Remember man.
Then help thy soul, while thou art here,
For though thy friend be never so nere:
When thou art dead, and laid on bear,
They all with thy goods make good chere.
Remember man.
Art thou so folish for to believe,
That they thy soul will releue:
Or yet thy goods in almese give.
Which to forgo, did thee sore gruee?
Remember man.
Nay, nay, they will say openly,
It were much sin, and great folly,
On him to rue or take pity,
That kept his goods so nigardly.
Remember man.
While thou have goods, do alms deeds,
Let virtue destroy all vicious weeds:
And sow in thy soul, the wholesome seeds
Of sorrow and repentance that to heaven ledes.
Remember man.
Send forth before to make thy way,
Charitable deeds, which shall and may:
Conduct thee surely without delay,
Paradise to win, at the endless day.
Remember man.
Call also to thy memory,
This world frail and transitory:
Full of foul sin and misery,
To heavenly bless clean contrary.
Remember man.
Of Christ Jesus the veruent love,
Remember man all thing above,
Whom pity did stire, and also move:
To suffer death for thy behoue.
Remember man.
The fearful day of strait judgment,
Fyxe well in thy intendement:
Where man and woman shall soxe repent,
Their sinful life and time misspent,
Remember man.
For getnot the infinite pains of hell.
Being so fervent and so fell:
That nothing can speak, nor yet tell,
Where dampened souls shall evermore dwell.
Remember man.
Remember thy joy inestimable,
So pleasant and so delectable,
Of paradise so comfortable,
Prepared for persons laudable,
Remember man.
Man, if thou keep this thing in mind.
And to thy maker be not unkind:
Eternal joy thou shall then find,
Ordained by god for all mankind.
Remember man.
The joys of heaven, the pains of hell,
The passion of Christ, his death so fell:
The world and death, consider thou well,
And Domes day, love every deal.
FINIS.
