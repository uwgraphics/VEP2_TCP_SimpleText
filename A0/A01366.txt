Against the possessions of the Clergy.
HArkyn what great auctorytes shall now follow / For proffe thereof.
Under reformacion of holy and devout clerkys it semyth that all ye reasons
which any of ye clergy be able to make for ye keeping of their temporal
possessions be but weyke and of small auctoryte / consyderyng that the contrary
thereof is co^maundyd and approuyd by ye old testament by the new testament /
and in many of their canon laws / and by ye seyenges of the apostels and many
holy doctors. And also that the reformacion and correccyon of all enormities in
the clergy belongs to pryncys and here in England unto the Kings grace our
most drad sovereign lord.

First by the auctoryte of the old testamente it aperyth that the clerge
ought not to have possessions. Cap..i.
It is written numeri.xviii. god said to Aaron. (Pactum pacis est sempiternum
tibi). and.c.

The pacte and covenant of peace is ever lastyng before god to the and to thy
sons in a perpetual right / In their land ye shall possede nothing / nor
ye shall have no part among them / I am thy part and heritage among the
children of Issraell / To the children of Leui I have geuyn all the tithes of
Issraell in possession for the mynstracio^ that they serve me in ye
tabernacle.and.c.

They shall possed nothing else but be content with the offrynge of tithes And
as it is said Esai.xliiij. there shall be no heritage to them, I am their
heritage / ye shall give them no possession in Issraell / I am their possession.

Also it is said. hier.xlviii. Cursed be he that does the work of god
fraudylently or neclygently.

Also exodi.xxiii. thou shalt not take rewards which blyndyth wise men and
subuertyth the words of just men.

Secondarely it apperyth by y^ new testamente that the clergy ought not to have
possessions. Ea..ij.
Also in the holy gospel Christ said Io.xii. he that mynistryth to me let him
follow me / and primo Io.xii. he yt seyth he will dwell in Christ must walk as
he walked but Christ walked all his life in pouerte without having any
te^porall possessions and alwey refused them / the it must nedys follow that
they that have possessions follow not Christ Also.i. pe.ii. Christ suffered for
us / leuyng yo^ example that ye might follow his steppys Also hebre.xii. let us
behold the auctor of ye feyth and fulfyller thereof Ihu^ which did put a wey
all Joy / and suffered (...) cross content with confusion.

Also Matthew.xvi. he that will come after me let him forsake his will and take
his cross and follow me.

And Luc.xiiij. unless that a man renounce to all men that, that he possedeth
he can not be my dyssyple.

Also Luc.xij. sell your possessyo^s and give almys Also Math.xix. Low have
forsakyn all and have followed the

Also Actu.ij. The appostels sold their possessions and substance and deuydyd
it to them that had need.

Also it appears that Christ wyllyd his appostels and dyssyples to have pain
in this world and no pleasure when he said Matthew.x. Lo I send you into the
world to be like to sheep in the myddys of the company of wolfes and Math.vij.
Enter you by the paynfull gate it is A streyt and paynfull wey which leadyth to
life and there is but few that find it.

And Matthew.x. Be ye not wyllyng ^o have possessions of gold nor silver nor
money nor two cotes / Also Colo.iii. sauer ye those thyngys that be a boue and
not those that be upon the earth / and many other placys of scripture affirm
the same that the clergy which call them selfs the successors of Christ's
appostels to whom Christ said that they were the light and salt of the yerth
should have no possessions.

Thrydly it apperyth by many o^ their own laws in ye decres that the clergy
ought not to have possessions.
Also it appyryth by ye canons of their own law that they ought not to have
possessions / for there it is said thu^ Dyst.xlvii. omnes.

The lovers of the world be strong in wordely things and weyk in heavenly
things / Also in the council of toletane it is commanded by many auctorytes
as it apperyth.xii. ^.i. that clerks ought to have no possessions.Ca. clicos
nich^^ / and there.xij. ^.i. clericus ^ ^i / and there / Ca. duo su^t genera
cristianorum / And in every of the said places it appears and is / prohybyt to
them / to have any possessions.

Also they that be constytutyd in holy orders ought not to take seculer cures /
dyst. lxxxviij. E^us / aut sacerdos.

Also a bishop may not take y^ tuycion of testame^tes nor the charge of wordly
thyngys / but ought to give hy^ self only to redyng prayer / and prechyng ye
word of god / dyst.lxxxviij. E^us nullam.

Fourthly it appears that te^porall possessyo^s ben forbedyn to the clergy by
the seyeng of the appostels and of many other holy doctors. Cap.iiij.
First saint Austen de co^temptu mu^di seyth / he y^ possedeth any thy^g in
earth is removed from ye discyplyn of Christ / From whens do they arrogau^tly
take to the^ the power of losy^g and by^dyng which i^ ye yerth presume to
possede any faculte / and why be not they asshamed to say / that the lord is
the part of mine heritage / the which will not forsake yerthly possessions /
Why do they ete y^ sins of the people / if they take tythys with the
chlidyrne of Leui / how shall they take part among other trybus / Augustinus
de contemptu mundi.

And yet he seyth there farther / where god is the auctor of all good things /
if the wordely things were verily good things / he would never have despised
them / nor would never have comau^dyd them to be despised of his folowers.

Also saint Auste^ i^ his.xxxvi. and.xxxvij. sermon ad fratres in Heremo /
seyth he that serves ye alter must live of ye alter / let him not be proud /
nor let (...) not be made rich by his clerkchip / and.i. Tio^.vi. Keep ye
justice be not wyllyng to make wynnyges but ye having fode and cloth / be ye
co^te^t therewith / for he yt does celebrat or prechyth or baptisyth for yt / yt
he should ge^uere there by. with out doubt does put a wey him self from the
heavenly goods of thou let to give the sacrament / what ^ouerte so ever thou be
in, thou art no ^heperde / nor mynyster of Christ but a Marcha^t / for he that
for the munystracio^ ^f ye sacrament takes money or reward or makes any
couenaunte is a geaysite and sellyth the sacrament and betrayeth ^is savior
with Judas.

Also saint austen wrytyth in the, ix. ^oke of his confession, ye seek a
blessed ^yfe in ye regyon of death / and there it is not Also against such
te^porall possessions of the clergy ye may read an another little ^reatyse called
spec^m episcoporum seu preatoru^, wherein it is suffycyently showed that ye
clergy ought to have no possessions Also saint austen in his.xxxvii. ser^on (ad
fratres in heremo) seyth let us ^ut forth our self in all our minds in ^ych
trybulacyon / in knolege in charity ^at feyned / in watchynges i^ presonine^es
/ in plages / in the word of truth / and so having no thing / possedyng Christ
let us possede all things / This is y^ lyte of blessed men / This is the health
of prestes / This is the rest of the servants of god / This is the will of
the fryndes of god / and this is our sanctyfycacyon / That we may put forth our
self^es in all things as ye mynysters of god in much peracience / in
trybulacion in necessite gyuynge to no man any offense / that our service / or
mynestery should not be reproved nor rebukyd.

And here to agreyth saint Peter.i. pe.ii. seyeng This is grace when any man
for the consentyng to god does suffer pacyently injury / what grace or thank
is it if ye being sinners / suffer wrong as who seyth none / but if ye doing
well do suffer pacyently / That is thankful to god / in to that thing ye
becalled.

Also.ii. Thy.iii. All they that will live makely in Christ shall suffer /
persecucyon pacyently. And saint Bernard seyth in his declamacyons / A clerk
having his part in yerth shall not have his part in heuyn / And Io.xv. I have
chosyn you from the world / and Math.xxiiii. and Luc.xxi. se that none begyle
you / Many one shall come in my name saying that I am Christ, and they shall
begyle many folks / And To.viii. if ye live after ye flesh ye shall dye. Also
read more of this Matter. Col.iii. Iac.iii. and iiii. and.i. Corynthe.vi.
and.ii. Coryn, iiii. And saint Bernard, in his declamacyo^s and in ye lxvi.
sermon super cant seyeth, The worst heresy / of all is to make lies upon the
true doctrine, not with tongue only but in living And ad Philypenses iii.
Clerks living plesantly be called enmyes of the cross of Christ, and glory
shall be to there confucyo^ / which sauore yerthly things.

And saint Bonaue^ture (in stimulo din^amoris super exposicione oracionis
dn^ice) seyth / yt it is more shame to a clerk to desire ho^our riches or
possession i^ this world tha^ it should be to ye so^e of an Emperrour, to desire
the office of A gonge farmere.

How the clergy have their goods by a wrong wey and keep from ye pore folkys
ye goods of ye church. Cap.v.
Also saint Barnarde in his declamacyons seyth / the goods of the church be
the patrymonye or inheryta^ce of pore me^ and they be kept from them by cruel
sacrelege / And how the Clergy has long time woluptuously devoured the
possessions and goods of Christ's church ye may read well fygured in the old
law Danielis..xiiii. by the prestes of an Idol / called / Bell / the story
whereof now folowith.

There was sumtyme, an ydoll called Bell the which the King with his people and
prestes worshyppyd every day for a god / to whom was given every day as the
master of the hystoryes seyth.iii. busshels of flower.xl. sheep.vi. mesurs of
wine / The King and ye people believed that Bell / had been a living god / and
that he had Eten all / but of troth The prestes with their wyffes and children
deuouryd all in their voluptousnes whereupon ye King said to Daniell. thynkest
not thou that Bell is a living god See thou not / how much he etyth and
drynketh / and danyell said / king see yt thou Err not / This Idol Bell is
Clay withinforth / and brass withoutforth / he never etyth ne drynketh / and
the king being dysplesyd and angry therewith called his prestes and said to
them / on les ye tell me who etyth this daily fode ye shall dye / But if ye can
show and prove to me that Bell etyth it / this Daniell shall dye / because he
has blasphemed Bell / and Daniell said let yt be as ye have said / and the
king and Daniell went to the temple of Bell and the prestes said / loo we shall
go forth and now thou king put here the mete and the wine and set them to
gether and shyt the door and seal it with thy Ryng and when thou shalt enter
this temple again to morrow / but if thou find all eten we shall dye / or else
Daniell yt has lied against us / These priests had made craftyly under the
board a secret door or enter / and thereby, they came in always / and deuouryd
that vytell It was so / yt after yt those priests were gone forth / the King
set that accustomed vytell before Bell and Daniell comau^dyd his Chyldryn to
bry^g him asshys / and syftyd it in the flore of the temple before the King and
so the King / and Daniell went out and shytt the door / and sealed it with the
Kings ring and so departed / The priests after their old custom / Entered
therein yt night with their wyfes and children / and did ete and drink all
that ye King had there set over night / The King ^ose erly on ye next morny^g
and Daniel with him / and they came to the door yt was sealed over night / and
the King said to Daniell Daniell is this Seal hole and he said all is hole and
safe / and as soon as the door was opened / y^ king looked on y^ table and cried
out with a loud voice, Bell / thou art great / and in the is no craft, nether /
gyle / and Danyell lawghed / And held ye King, yt he should enter no farther /
and said be hold the pauyment or flore / And wyselye / think wose steppys be
these / And the king said / I see steppys of men, women, and of childryn, and
therewith the king was angrye / and took those prestes, there wyuys, and their
chyldryll, and then they showed their secret Dorys / by ye which they were
wont to enter / and to consume all the said sacryfice / then the King kyllyde
those prestes / and gave to Daniell, the power over Bell, and he subuertyd and
over threw Bell and his temple (Morally) Now / In this manner yt standyth with
many of the Clergy at these Days / specially with symonyte Clerks /
craftylye and vniustelye e^try^g In to their curys / to ye voluptuous

Qui non intrat) and.c. he that enters not by the door in to the fold of sheep
but elsewhere / he is a theffe and a lurker / he that entryth by the door / he
is the sheperd of the sheep / but such symonyte clerke^s enter not by the door
that is / Christ / but by a back door or by the wyndowe / Soentrynge with a
very purpose to consume the offerynges and goods of ye Church, In their
vanytes / and voluptous life / And they procure to them self many things /
both temporal and spu^all, under y^ pretense that god in his poor membrys
shall ete and spend yt / And no dowte / many things be geuyn to them on this
hope, and trust / that they may the more quietly Attend to the study of
contemplacion, and to the prechyng of the word of god / and because that of
the temporal goods / geuyn them for that porpose / they should have but a
strayte and a bare / living / according to the seyeng of saint Paul.i.
^io^.vi. Habe^tes. etc. we having fode and coueryng / let us be with these
things content and of the remnaunt Christ in his pore people should be fed
according to ye seyeng of Chryil. Math.xv. (Quod v^i) That which ye have done
to one of mine ye have done to me / But yet I mean not that every priest should
have a like lyuy^g For a bishop etc. or other put i^ office and romys of
charge ought to have sufficyente to maynteyn their necessary charge without
superfluite / And that men of the church should give the goods of the church to
pore me^ that remaynyth ouyr and a boue their necessary fode and clothyng /
John^ abbot de villa) witnessyth in a sermon that begy^nyth thus / Tulerunt
lapides vt iacerent in eum.

How the goods and possessions be mispendyd and mysused by many of the clergy.
Ca.vi.
Under the auctoryte of saint ambrose and saint / Hierom, they wry^e thus They
be thieves and Rauenours and extorcinors that misuse y^ goods of the church /
They raueyn and pluck trome the pore men / the great plenty that they have /
for all should be the pore menys syuyng that is left a boue their necessary
fedy^g and clothyng / and thereto Agreyth saint Bernard as it is before said and
an other holy doctore called Flore seyth yt all that thou kepest or reteynyst
to thy self / above necessary fode and simple clothyng of the goods of ye
altar it is not thyns but it is Theft Raven Extorcyon / an^ sacrelege / and
so now seyth an holy doctor called / (Filius fabrilingnarii in distructoriu^
vico^rum part.vi. Cap..xxi.

Volde god that the King / and other noblemen. and.c. Founders of the gret^
almys geuyn to the church / would d^ like as ye king before wrytyn with Dani^^
did as to sete their seals so that the^ would set there seals of right
consideracion and of discrecion and then the should well. Find on the one side
(...) ^he great wastfull spe^dyng of ye oblacio^s of the church in much vain
apparel and wordely pomp / and so they should well se and perseyue ye steppys
and pathys of such voluptuous And symonyte cler^es / which is their manifest
affeccio^s, In the Duste of ye vanite of this world / that is to sey / In y^
vanite of superfluous apparel of them selfs / their servants / And their
Horsys, and therewithal the ^yng and his Noble men on the other ^yde might
well see And consider ma^y good pour men and women compel ^yd and forsyd for
nedynes, hunger, and ^hurst / by lamenes and bly^dnes / to beg ^om Door, to
Door, and no dowte but (...) doing the Kings grace and his noble ^en, fownders
and geuers of ye great ^emperall possessions to ye church, should ^y their
dyscrecio^s sone see and perceive that Christ in / his pore people has had
^till or none of their superfluous / and ^perabundant possessions / but that
the ^oluptuous minystres of ye temple, not enteryng by ye Door that is Christ /
bu^ by preuey poster^e gates / and wyndous and by secret weys theuyshly have
clymed thereto and have stolen and deuo^ryd the sacrifys and goods of the
church that has been offered to god / And do^tours as saint Austen / saint
Bernard and other sey that such prestes be not only theuys / And the worst
sacreleges but also symonytes Herytyks / And traitors to god / And how god
thretenyth such ill cura^es / ye may read Hiere.xxiii.

And it must now be remembered and considered yt when Constantyne y^ Emperor
gave his temporal possessions and Empire to the church / and when pope
syluester the^ Received / yet after ward at that time there was a great doubt
contrauercy / and altercacion / among the Clergy / wether yt gift and the
receyuyng thereof if any such were / were lauful^ or no as it apperyth i^
fasciculo temporu^ / And then those that were of ye covetous clergy concluded
yt it was both lawfully geuyn / And lawfully receyuyd / agayns ye mind of those
which were good / And for the co^tynuance and maynte naunce thereof / They the^
put and left in writing their opynyons / and weke aucrorites to remain
perpetuallye / The effect whereof is set in ye said book called / Fasciculus
temporum and therefore / It semyth that if these forsayde wrytynges with their
opynyos and weke Auctorytes were Dyscretelye red and newlye lokyd on / And so
were laid In one side, of the balance of any devout Clerks conscience / not
corruptyd with Auaryce (That is rote of al yllys and the service and bondage of
Idolles) Nether with arroga^cy and pride of this world / And on ye othersyde of
the said balance were laid ye manyfolde Auctorytees before wryttyn / to the
contrary thereof the^ yt would appear / that there is none even weight between
them / And that the furst wryttyn opinyons and weke Auctorytes, of that Clergy
alowyng both the geuyng and Receuy^g of theseyd temporal possessions to be
lawful / be over weke / and natable to counterpeyse the other side of the
balance / which settyth and takyth Auctoryte of.iiii. most strong and most
suffycyent grounds of gods laws / That is to say / Of the old testament
and the new testament / the gospelles of Chyrst some decrees of the law canon
/ And of wrytynges of diverse of the apostelys / And of many other holy
doctors now seyntes in heuyn / as is before wryttyn / where the other do not
so / nor have no such auctoryte / and in co^fyrmacyon hereof / The reverend
fader in god John^ now bishop of Rochester in a sermon, which he made for
the confutyng of the heresies which he said were of Martyn luter seyth among
other of his good seyenges there that saint Ambrose seyth of saint Peter that he
is called Petra / because that he furst among the gentylys did establyshe the
ground of our feyth / and as a ston immovable or no^ asye to be removed he
co^teynyth i^ him / and stays all the frame and gretnes of the work of
Christ.

Now saint Peter so conteynyng and ^ayeng all the frame of Christ's work i.
pe.ii. Bydyth y^ clergy to be subjects ^o every humany creature for god / and
not to be lords of Castelles and Towns and of other temporal possessions /
and ^aynt Paul / saint / James / saint / Ma^hewe / and many other holy
doctors / ^onferme the same / that pouertye / Mi^erye and subieccyon ought to
be in the clergy / as before is said.

Wherefore yt is to be thought that no clerk should usurp to speak / ne to
wry^e / in mayntena^ce of the foresaid weke opynyons which those of the clergy
did ^olde at that time, which seems to bear ^o strength / For they be now by
many^old and grette auctorytes utterly co^^owndyd.

And here yt is to be consyderyd that ^myghty god / in the old law and in the
new law has by his word and ordinance prouydyd for prestes and clarkys a
living in pouerte and in tribulacion forbedyng to them the having of temporal
possessions. as is before wryte^ And Christ so lived him self here in this
world.xxxiii. years / and after his ascencion his appostels and dyscyples /
and other clerks which that succedyd them did so live and did so teache by ye
space of.iii. C. years and god says y^ his ordinance and word shall stand
and be permane^t for ever. Number. xviii. pactu^ and.c. the pact and couenaunte of
peace is ever lasty^g before god (and ps^. C. C. xviiii. thy wor^ good lord
shall a bide for ever, and ps^. C. x. he has comau^dyd for ever his testamente
/ and the Euangelystes / Math. Mark and Luke say (Verba mea non preteribunt.
and.c. my word shall not pas A way / and saint Paul seyeth. To. xiii they
that resyste the ordinance of god gets damnacion to them selfs and saint
John^ eua^gelyst seyth that godde^ word is god him self (et deus erat ver^um)
And he seyth also (Sermo tuus ve^itas est) Thy sermon is veryte / And ^aynt /
Austen in his meditacyons seyth Principium. and.c. The beginning of ^hy word is
truyth / that is y^ begy^nyng of thy word which was thy word in the ^egynnyng,
Wherefore it semyth to fo^ow that who so ever denies the word of god he
denies god him selffe, that is ^ery truth and so he is made strange and
alenatyd from ye spryt of truth, that ^s god the holy ghost / and Christ has
promised / Math. x. to deny all such persons before god his fader that is in
he^yn, That deny him in this world / wherefore every good man should pray and
say with ye psalmyste / Ps. cc. xviij. Good lord take not from my mow the /
^he word of truyth / and all ye apopstels and holy Doctors before rehersyd did
^uer preche / and have left behynd the^ In writing ye said word and ordinance
of god / and have made thereof co^stytucyo^s and holy cano^ns affyrmyng
pouertye / and for beddyng alwes te^porall possessions to be in the Clergy,
and have set them In the book / of holy decres to be perpetuallye obseruyd and
kept by the clergy / affyrmyng ye books and vyolators thereof to be
blasphemours / in the holy ghost, which as saint / Matthew, wytnessyth / Math.
xi. Is Irremyssilbe in this world and In the world to come / All this not
withsto^dyng sythen ye time of the Emperor consta^tyne and of pope Syluester
which was.iii. C. yers after Christ's, birth, The covetous sort of the clergy
do writ yt te^porall possessions and te^porall auctorytes has cu^me to the
by myraclis, wheruppon ye pope has co^mau^dyd that no man shall be so hardy to
speak there against / yet, a general counsel has affyrmyd this proposicion /
Luc. xiiii. (Nisi ^s renu^ciau^it oi^bus que possidet non potest meuus est
discipls) which semyth to be heretycal in his lyterall se^s as it apperyth i^ a
book of Eneas siluius of ye council of Basyll / in ye co^de^nacyon of the.xii.
article of John^, wykelyff. In these matters seems to be a great seysme and
co^trariete and where.ii. such contraryes be / both of the^ ca^ not be trwe /
and it may well be said, that ye holy ghost was not present at ye making of the^
both / whereby the kings lay subiectys be brought into a marvelous perplexite
and dau^gere of heresye / for not knowing whether / of those.ii. co^traryes is
to be best believed / For we have but one god / one faith / and one king to
whom of necessyte all we his lay subjects must pray and hu^byll make
intercessyo^ to be easyd of ye said perplexyte Scysme and co^traryte / for it
may be well said to ye clergy i^ this case as Christ said to the pharasyes and
falls Ipocrytis / Math / xv. ye have not ratifyed nor allowed nether regardyd the
commau^deme^t of god / but your own tradycions / wherefore it may please ye
Kings hyghnes to say to ye clergy with Christ all plantynges or graffynges yt
my heavenly / fader has not plantyd / or graffyd / shall be pluckyd up be the
rote.

That the correccyon of all such and other enormytyes in ye clergy belongyth to
the King and to his seculer power. Cap..vii.
xxiii. q^. iii. (Qui potest obuiare) there it is said that he that may punyshe
malefactors and does it not / is the very fauorer of their wykednes.

xxiii. q^. v. (Sunt quidam enormia)

There it is said that all outragyous offensys shall be punyshyde by seculer
Iugys.

xxiii. q^. v. (de Liguribus et venetecis) There it is said that the seculer
power shall constrayne and correct all scismatykes and heretykes

xxiii. q^. v. (Regum officium) there it is said the kings office is to
punyshe all ill folks and to releue good folks xxiii. q^. i. (Si apud
carnales dn^os) There it is said that he that refucyth or dyspysyth to bear or
to give reverence to ye powers of rulers, shall lack his reward in heuyn.

xxiii. q^. v. (Qui malos percutit) there it is said that he is the very
minister of god that punyssheth and strykyth ill folks for their offenses.

xxiii. q^. v. (Si propterea) there it is said that the wrongs of the
sacramentys of Christ / must be auengyd by kyngys. saint Paul / ad tit..i.
byddyth / upon cause geuy^ to punysh offenders straytly and hardely to make
them hole and sound in the feyth. And there he says farther Take no head to
their Iwysshe fables nether to the comaundementes of men that turnyth them
self from the trowth for as well their myndys as the consciences ben foul
spotted.

They knowelege them self to know Christ and yet in their dedys they deny him
for they be abhomynable And vnfeythfull and frowardly dysposyd to every good
work Et ps. xviii. it is spoken of them thus (Narr / auerunt michi) and.c.
wicked men have told me fables but not as the law / and saint Paul. To. xiii.
seyth. (Omnis anima).and.c.

Every soul is subject to the superyour powers / There is no power but of god
they that be / be ordained of god / so yt he which resistyth power resistyth
the ordinance of god / they yt resyst get to them selfs damnacyon / for
pryncys be not ordynyd to the fere of good works but of evil / if thou will
not dred power do good / and thou shalt have laud thereof He is mynyster of
god to the in good things / if you do evil dred / he beryth not the sword
without cause / he is ye mynester of god, vengaunce in wrath to him that does
evil / therefore of necessyte be ye subject not only for wrath / but also for
conscience.

And saint Peter seyth. i. Pet. ii. (Subiecti igitur) and.c.

Therefore be ye subject to every humayn ^reature for god to the vengaunce of
evil doers and laud of good men.

Now for the love of god. That clerk yt lustyth to reprove or i^pugne y^
foresaid auctorytese or the applyyng of ye same let him do it louyngly and
charitably ye and ^t y^ lest by like auctorties and by no less. which if they
can not do / let the^ forsake their abusys and conform the^ selffys to the
word of god / and to live thereafter God grant ye same / Amen.

Fourthly it appears that tempora possessions ben forbedyn to ye clergy by the
