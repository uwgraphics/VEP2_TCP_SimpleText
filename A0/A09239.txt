A proper new balade expressyng the fames,
Concerning a warning to al London dames,

To the tune of the black Almaine.
YOu London dawes, whose passing fames
Through out the world is spread,
In to the sky, ascendyng hye
To every place is fled:
For through each land and place,
For beauties kyndely grace:
You are renowned over all,
You have the praise and ever shall.
What wight on earth that can behold
More dearer and fayrer dames then you?
Therefore to extol you I may be bold,
Your paces and graces so gay to vieu.
For Virtues lore, and other things more
Of truth you do excel,
I may well guess, for comeliness
Of all, you bear the bell:
As trim in your arraye
As be the flowers in May
With roset hew so bravely dight
As twinklyng stars that shyneth by night.
For curtesye in every part
Not many nor any resemble you can,
In lady Natures camely art
So gravely and bravely to every man.
And often when you go, fair dames on a row
In to the feeldes so green,
You sit and vewe the beautiful hew
Of flowers that there be seen:
Which lady FLORA has
So garnyshed in each path
With all the pleasures that may be
(Fair dames) are there to pleasure ye
Till Frost does come and nip the top,
And lop them and crop them, not one to be seen
So when that Death does hap to your lot,
Consider and gather what beauty has been.
For as the flower, does change in an hour
That was so fair to see,
Consider and gather (fair dames) the wether
May change as well with ye:
And turn your joys as soon
As Frost the flowers has done
So sudden Death may change as well
Your beauties that now does excel,
And turn your sweetes to bitter and sour
When death with his breath comes stealing near:
Such haps may hap to come in an hour
Which ever or never you little did fear.
Wherefore I say, fair dames so gay
That Death is busyest now,
To catch you hence, where no defense
May make him once to bow:
Experience well does try
You see it with your eye,
How quickly some are taken hence
Not youthful years may make defense:
And strange diseases many are seen
Encreasyng and preasyng to vex us each day,
But sure the like has ever been
May houe you and move you to God to pray.
And learn to know, as grass does grow
And withers in to hay,
Remember therefore, keep virtue in store
For so you shall decay:
And pity on the poor
With some part of your store,
Look that your lamps may ready be
The dreadful day approaches nigh:
When Christ shall come to judge our deeds
No fairenes nor clerenes can help you than,
The corn to separate from the weeds
Fair dames, when comes the day of dome.
Now that I have said, let it be wayed
It is no iestyng toye,
Not all your treasure, can you pleasure
It is but fadyng joy:
Therefore remember me
What I have said to ye,
And thus the Lord preserve the Queen
Long space with us to live and reign:
As we are all bound incessantly
To desire with prayer both night and day,
God to preserve her majesty
Amen, let all her good subjects say.
quoth Steven Peell.

FINIS.
