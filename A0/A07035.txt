TO The right honorable, and truly noble, Sr. HENRY VANE KNIGHT, MASTER
CONTROVLER OF THE KINGS HOVSEHOLD, and one of his Majesty's most honorable
privy Councillors of State.
WHen your honor was last here in the Netherlands Lord Ambassador
extraordinary for his Matie of great Brittan^e; with the Lords the States
General of the United Provinces: It pleased your honor, to employ your servant
in collecting, and abbreviating some military Abstracts. Since which time, in
regard of my long service, I have gained more experience, and studied my
profession some what better. To this end, for the good of my Country, and
Nation (for every man by a natural inclination, ought to add some thing
thereunto) I have of late undertaken, and written a treatise entitled, The
Principles of the Art Militaire, practiced in the vvarres of the United
Netherlands, represented by figure, the word of Command, an demonstration,
disgesting the same into three parts, whereof the first, shows the duty, and
office of a Captain, his inferior officers, the true form observed amongst
us in the exercising of a Company, the Ordering of a Regiment, and our laws,
and articles of Marshall discipline. The second part treats of the several
duties of the officers of the field, and the diverse forms of ranging horse
and foot in battle-ray, shown by Prince Maurice of famous memory, and his
brother his highness the Prince of Orange our General that now is, at sundry
times, and in diverse places. The third part, handles the place and office of
the Master (or General) of the Ordinance and all the officers under his train
and Command, together with the Ordinance, Munition, Engines, Instruments,
Materials, and all necessary preparations, and Equipage, belonging to an Army
and other officers depending on the war. But yet (me thinks) these three
parts, are defective and incompleate, unless a fourth be added thereunto,
which is the excellent art of Fortification. To this effect, I have translated
into English out of French, the works of two famous Mathematicians of our
modern times, namely Mr. Samuel Marolois, and Mr. Albert Girard, who have
written at large upon this subject. As for exemple, what valor, and this art
have done, witness the famous siege of Ostend, for by the means hereof never
was town so bravely disputed, never Fortress (in the memory of man) so
courageously defended, having to do with so brave an Ennemy, who was fainte
during the time of three years, three months, and odd days Siege, to get
this town (as it were) by ynchmeale: what should I say by ynchmeale? when they
were driven to such nonpluses, that they could not get a strawes breadth of
us, but held up many days, and weeks (finding such a resistance) their
approches, before they could advance them any further: yea which is more, when
they had approached, sapt, and mined into the very bowels of some Bulvvarkes,
blowing them up with the violence of powder, steeple-high into the air, each
Ennemy then strived at push of the pike, who should become master of that fallen
Earth, to turn it up one against an other. And at last being master of the
deformed karkeis of a torn Bulwark or two, found presently a new
retrenchment, or cutting of cast up before them; being then forced to sapp
forward again, and make new works, and mines, which lasted so long, and was
so well disputed, till they got the half of the town, before they had the
whole. This men, valor, and fortification (by the help of Almighty God) can
do. Again, this was one of Prince Maurice (of blessed memory) his master
pieces, for by this art, he was so wary, and careful of the Lives of his men,
that he choose rather, to spend the States a hundred pound, in casting up a
trench, a Sap, and a work, rather then to hasard and loose the life of a man,
so good a Menagier was he for the preserving of his men. This Art then, being
of such singular use, for the making of all manner of Fortresses, and works
both Regular, and irregular, even from a quadrangle which is a fortress with
four points or Bulwarks, to a Dodecon, which is a town or a fortress with
twelve Bastions, for the preservation of men in a War defensive, comes in
most humble wise, to crave your honors gracious patronage, that under your
favor, and protection, it may come to the view of the world, an may be
helpful to such, as are desirous and ingenious to study this noble art, which
if it be acceptable unto your honor, then I shall think my time well spent, and
acknowledge my self much bound unto your honor, and shall be obliged not only to
pray unto the Almighty, to preserve you and yours in health; but also to
crown you hereafter with everlasting felicity, resting*

Iour honors humble, and devoted servant HENRY HEXHAM.

THE FIRST PART OF REGVLAR FORTIFICATION, DEMONSTRATED BY THE DECEASED SAMVEL
MAROLOIS, And Reviewed, corrected and augmented BY ALBERT GIRARD, SANMIELOIS.
GOd having found good to create Man, did with all prepare his affection for
society, that by this means he might the longer preserve him, and so make him
become more strong and able. According to which and to the same end, there
were first built howses, and lodgings, to keep men from the injury of the
air, as winds, storms, rain, excessive heat, and cold, as the situation
of their dwellings, and the commodiousnesse of those places did afford. And as
by divine blessing, and their own industry, they attained unto many Earthly
riches, as famillies, cattle, and other goods: so by the instinct of nature,
they sought always to strengthen and defend themselves with the best
fortifications they could, that thereby they might not only preserve their
bodies against the violence of their Adversaires; but also their goods,
kindred, and Associates. To this end (as we may observe as well in ancient
histories, as also at this day in some East and West Indian Nations) they drove
in piles of timber, and made Empalements closse one to an other, that
enclossing themselves so narrowly together, they might be the better able to
defend and resist the fury of their Ennemies. But in process of time, the
defects of such enclossure being well marked, they began afterward to make
their Fortifications of a more solid, firm, and durable matter, as stone,
brick, earth and such like. And though experience taught them, that these their
Empalements of wood, were not able to ^esist fire, and diverse other accidents,
which might befall them: yet it is certain, they used these and the like
fortifications, till they found the harm and conveniencie, which they received
by them. But necessity, the Inventrix of Arts, found that walls built with
stones and bricks were better. These were in use and train, till such time
also, as their imperfections were known, and that by the force of man, and
Engines they were diverse ways attempted; yea many times beaten down and
overthrown: which made them seek from time to time to remedy their defects:
for perceiving that their walls were heretofore subject to be beaten down (by
Rames) and other ancient Engines; they made them (upon the right line of the
wall) Spures, and roundles to hinder the beating of them down, and to preserve
them the better from a breach, and tumbling down, they gave them the Talude,
that is, a slooping toward the inside of the place, that they might be the
more able to resist the violence and force of these Engines. Finally these
walls were made after diverse manners: first in a round form, which, as on the
one side, it was held the strongest; because these Engines beating against the
wall crushed the stones, and made them stick the closser together, in regard
the circle exterior was greater then the interior, and that the Engines could
not unfasten, loose and break them but with great difficulty. So on the other
side, it was impossible to defend such walls, when approches was made unto
them; because no part of them could be discouvered, or flancked: so that
afterward they built the^ in a square form, with small squares in their
angles, for the defense of their Curtains. Then made them also Demycircles
with angles interior, and exterior, and lastly triangular wise, on the one
side to resist the force of the furious Canon, used at this day; and on the
other side, that they might be the more capable to defend themselves by
discovering every part of the wall, even to the very foundation. And as
invention of attempting is grown to the highest degree in these days, by
reason of the long experience of the wars in these parts (which is the Schole
of all military actions) and the ability, and capacity of the Assaillants and
Defendants: So am I of the opinion, that the Fortifications made in these Low
Countries, are the strongest, exactest, and perfectest, which can be invented,
and which have been made and practiced, not by a simple General, but by one of
the greatest Captains of the World, endowed with a singular courage and
spirit, an excellent Mathematician, and is not only a Prince of a great house;
but also experienced and beaten in all militaire actions, and stratagems;
as well offensive, as defensive: of which Fortification, we have undertaken to
treat briefly at this present, and as succinctly as possibly may be.

Of the definitions.
I.
Forasmuch then as the definitions of Fortification are by the daily use of
arms grown so common: it were in vain for me (in my opinion) to make any
further explication thereof: yet to satisfy the ignorant, we will mark out
the angles, and sides of a Fortress, by the Letters of the Alphabeth, and
opposite to the said letters, ye shall find their names, and appellations, as
we may note by the figures 1. and 2, following.

places.

Before we come to instruct you particularly in the Art of Fortification; we
will briefly treat of the calculation thereof: In which supputation, ye shall
have first set down the known terms, and under them the disposition of the
Characters or Letters: beginning with a square fortress with four angles, or
Bulwarks, and proceed on to a Dodecagone, a fortress with twelve angles, or
Bulwarks, making upon every Polygone, 3 or 4 Trialls, that afterward one may
choose the best of them: and because the angles will not be much altered by the
diversity of the trials: I have thought good to give this general rule for
them following.

It is a thing generally received of all men, that a square fortress with
four Bulwarks, is not so good as a Pentagonall with five angles, nor a
Pentagonall so strong as an Exagonall with six, and so consequently of the
rest. If the cause thereof be sought out; one may observe that this proceeds
from the smallness of their angles; as not being able to bear such a body of
a Bastion, as the subsequent Polygones: so that a square fortress for this
reason, will be more defective, then the Pentagonall, and this less defensive
then the Hexagonall, and so well the rest following even to a Dodecagone, which
has the angle of the Bastion right, which is the cause, that constraines one
to make the angles flanked lesser, then the reason of building well does
require, that is, the flanks too little, the Gorge too narrow, and the line of
defense too long. To increase then proportionally the angles of Fortresses,
according as the angle of their Polygone augmenteth; we will take then the
half of their angles, and adding thereunto 15 degrees, the sum will be the
angle of the Bulwark, which we term the angle-flanked, and if the
angle-flanked be subtracted from the angle of the Polygone, there will remain
the double of the angle flanking interior, which double being subtracted from
180 degrees, `then will remain the angle flanking exterior, called the
Tenaille, and if ye add to the angle flanking interior 90 degrees, then the
sum will be the angle of the Shoulder.

To find out the angle of the Polygone from the number of its substract,
namely 2, the remaynder must be multiplied by 2. and the product will be the
number of the right angles, which such a Polygone contains, as ye may see by
this exemple following.^

Or thus.^

And by the same rule ye shall find the angles of the Subsequent Polygones,
beginning from a square Fortress to a Dodecagone.

4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12 90. 72. 60. 51 3/7. 45. 40. 36. 32 8/^^. 30 the

1/2. 114 9/14. 116 1/4. 117 1/2. 118 1/2. 119 1/22. 120 the ang. of the should.

And seeing the angle flanked of a Dodecagone is right, and able to resist a
battery, which is also made always with right angles to shake the more the
face of the Bulwark; one must fortify the Polygones, which are above the
Dodecagone, with a right angle, that the line of defense may come the more into
the curtain, that one may give the more fire upon it: but the Polygones, which
are under a Dodecagone, must be fortified, according to the precedent Table,
and the calculation thereof shall be made hereafter.

Some times we augment, as well the angles of the Bulwarks, as the Octogone, a
Fortress with 8 angles or Bulwarks, with a right angle, and those above are
always right, and those under diminishing to the square fortress (which has
the angle of its Bulwark only of 60 degrees.) According to which the Bulwarks
are somewhat larger, and the gorges and flank greater then the former, but the
second flanks lesser. Now for the finding out of every angle, ye must do this
following, where ye may observe, that in the manner above said, the angles
flanking interior are the fourth part of the angle flanked, or the 1/^ of the
angle of the Polygone.

IIII. V. VI. VII. VIII the angle 90. 108. 120. 128 4/7. 135. the angle of the

In the same manner also may be made right the angle flanked of the Decagone, a
Fortress of ten Bulwarks, where ye must note also, that before we proceed
further, we will make use in the supputation following of the tenths or
decinall numbers; which though it gives some imperfection: yet seeing the
things, which we omit therein are of no great consequence, it were ridiculous
to make any further search thereof; considering likewise that the tables of
Sines, tangents, and secants, are one and the same; I thought it good therefore
to make use of these following.

THE I. QUESTION. The 1. Figure, and 1. Plate.
Let there be made upon a Square a fortification of four Bulwarks, so that
the line of the Gorge be 7 parts: DI the curtain 21, and IF, which is the
flank of 5, and from the angle of the flank is drawn the line of defense by
the angle of the Shoulder, to give it a face. The question is how many the
angles will be, and every line of the same fortress, when as the line of
defense will take up 600 feet. Now the length of a foot is set down in the
25 model of Geometry, noted by 1, and is divided into 12 inches, and the ynch
into 10 equal parts, and is the same foot, whereof 12 makes a rodd, which his
Excel, uses in all his Fortifications.

ALBERT GIRARD.
THe Author has here above so disposed his calculations, that in stead of
explaining them briefly, he confounds them teadiously, as if heretofore there
had been noe certain rule set down in vvriting, to calculate lines and
angles as is ordinarily done by the Trigometrie of plain Triangles, although
there have been a number of Authors, which have treated of them, the one
after one manner, the other after an other; and the most part of them commixed
with long discourses, which moved me not long since, to putt into light
some tables of Sines in a portable volume, with the most succinct method that
possibly could, touching the supputation of such plain triangles, reducing
them into four diverse cases, where I did insert in their places, some of my
own inventions to the purpose, known as I suppose to none others
heretofore; so that it cannot be, but having 3 known terms, in a triangle,
but that one may know the other three, or one of them only, which one
desires, as the Reader may know it; the manner and order thereof being much
more facile, and easier to conceive, then the reading of our Author in his
former editions, being obscure, troublesome, and hard to be attained unto. For
this reason the Learners of this science, are required to be forevvarned before
they come to the reading of this book; and are advertized hereby, that when
it is said, a triangle has three terms, he must understand known, or given,
and that when I say that a triangle right-angle has three terms, that then I
am bound but to show two of them; seeing that this word (right-angle)
presupposes that the triangle has a right angle, to vveet of 90 degrees:
moreover, that touching this present question, these 7, 21, 5 parts,
demonstrate the reason of the lines ND, DI, IF, and not the quantity of the
same in feet, as is necessary to find in the manner follovving.

To find out the Angles.
IN the triangle right angle CDI, the side CD, is to DI, as 5 to 21, (for CD
being of 5 parts; then DI will be the 21 thereof) therefore the angle DIC, will be
found for 13:24 its double CLD 26:48, and its adjunct CLF flanking exterior,
will be of 153:12. Now in the figure quadrilatere, or of foure-sides, ABLH; the
angle exterior BLH is always equal to the 3 interiours B, A and H; now A 90,
the angle of the center, being taken from BLH, 153:12, there will remain the
two Demy-flankes ABL, and LHA 63:12. for one entire flank ZBC: and seeing that
the angle of the Shoulder BCD, is exterior in the triangle CDI, it will be
equal to the two interiours D.90. and 1. 13; 24, and therefore the Shoulder C,
will be 103. 24.

To find out the Lengths.
IN a triangle ambligone BNI, the side BY is 600 feet, and the angles are
found, therefore the other terms shall be found, to wit BN the Capital line
196, 64, and NI, 444, 62, but ND is the third of DI (for ND being 7, DI is 21
by the Hypotheses) therefore the fourth part of the found NI, will be ND, 111, 15
the Gorge, and the rest will be 333, 46, for DI, the Curtain, now DI to DC is as
21, to 5: therefore one may say, if 21 gives me 5, how many DI 333, 46, give
me? facit for CD 79, 40. and so CI will be 343, 84, which taken from BY 600,
there will remain BC 257, 16, for the face.

Finally, the triangle right-angle VDH has three terms, DH 600, and the angle
H equal to HDI. 13:24 (because of the parallels DI; VH) then you shall know VD
139, 05, and VH 583, 67, from which side substract UP (equal to Demi DI) 166,
73, there will remain PH 416, 94, whereof the double will be for BH 833, 88, and
PA will be 416, 94, for it is equal to PH, and thus must ye do with the rest
following.

The 3. Figure, 1. Plate.
Let there be a square Fortress, whereof the curtain DI being 4 parts; the
flanck CD shall have 1 of them, and also the Gorge 1: The defense running from
the angle of the flank, forms the face, and the length BY is of 600 feet,
one requires the greatness of the other lines of the same Fortress.

To find out the Angles.
THe triangle right-angle CDI has three terms, as the reason of the sides CD,
1, to DI, 4, therefore the flancking interior CDI will be 14 degrees and 2
minutes, whereunto add D 90 degrees, then the Shoulder BCD will be 104: 2; now if
ye double the angle CID, it will be 28:4, CMD, and its adjunct CMF, 151: 56 for
the angle flancking exterior, from which substract the angle of the center A
90: there will remain 61: 56 for the angle flancked entire B, and thus much
for the angles.

For the sides.
THe triangle BNI, has three terms, to wit, BY 600 feet, and the angles B,
30: 58. and N, 135. I, 14. 2, so one shall find the lines BN 205, 76 and NI
436, 59; but in regard that ND to DI is as 1, to 4, according to the Hypotese,
then ND will be the fifth of NI, where will follow that ND will be 87, 32 (and DC
as much) and DI the rest 349, 27. Now seeing that in the triangle right-angle
CDI, the sides CD, DI are notified, one shall find the Hypotenuse CI of 360,
which taken from BY 600. there remains the face BC 240. Finally, in the
triangle right-angle VDH, which has 3 terms DH 600, the angle H, equal to
CID 14.2, ye shall have VD 145, 49: also VH 582. 09, from which take UP 174,
64. (equal to the demy-curtaine DI) there will remain PH 407, 45, also PA its
equal: then in the triangle right-angle APH, ye shall find AH 576, 22 from
whence take BN or HO, the capital line 205, 76, there will remain AO 370, 46,
and in taking VD, from AP, there will remain the perpendicular of the Center,
A upon the midst of the curtain 261, 96. Now BH will be 114, 90. as being the
double of PH.

4. Figure. and 1. Plate.
In this square Fortress, the defense BY is 600 feet, and the angle flanked
60 degrees, whereof DBC is the fourth part, which is 15 degrees, the question
is what the quantity of the parts of such a Fortress will be?

For the angles.
Seeing that the line flanked is 60, then in the triangle BNI the angle B will be
30, and N 135, (the adjunct of ANY 45:) whereof the angle remaining BIN will be
15 degrees: therefore the triangle BDI will be Isosceles, that is, two sides a
like, such that DBI is as well 15; as BID; The Shoulder C will be 105, and in the
triangle DMI, the angles upon the basis are each of them 15 degrees, the
remaynder M will be then 150 for the flanking exterior BMH.

For the sides.
THe triangle Isoceles BDI has three terms, the defense BY 600 feet, and the
pointed angles every of them 15 degrees. Therefore DI the Curtain will be 310,
584. Also the triangle CDI, has three terms, the angle D right; I 15. and the
curtain DI, then CD the flank 83, 217, and CI 321, 535, which being taken
from BY 600, there will remain BC the face 278, 465. Moreover in the triangle
IBN, the angles B 30, I, 15, and the defense 600: so then BN the Capital line
will be 219, 623, and NI 424. 268. from whence DI being taken there will remain
the gorge ND, 113. 684. Moreover, the triangle BIL having three terms, L
right, B equal to CID 15. and BY 600, then IL will be 155, 292, and BL 579, 558,
and taking from it PL 155. 292. (which is the half of the curtain) there
will remain BP 424, 266 for AP; also its double being BH 848, 532, one may
also easily know BA 600. The 5. Figure. and 2. Plate.

ALBERT GIRARD.
Heitherto of the defense drawn from the angle of the flank, but in those
follovving, there is a second flank, and the distance of the angle of the
flank, even to the angle flanked, which is called Fichant.

The 5 figure is the dessigne or draught of a square Fortress, whereof the
line of defense fichant DH makes 600 feet, the angle flanked 60 degrees, the
line HB is divided into 7 equal parts; whereof the one which is between the
Characters 1. 2. is subdivided into 5 equal parts, and from the center B, is
made the Arch, 4 N cutting the capital line at N, from which point is drawn
NDZ parallel to BH, and from the point V (which is in the character 2) the
perpendicular VD, the question is how many these lines, and the angles of such
a Fortress, will make?

For the lines in parts indetermined.
FOrasmuch as BH contains 35 such parts as BN 9; BV 10, VH 25, ye shall have
in the triangle right-angle BTN terms enough to know BT, or TN 6, 364, and TV
or, ND 3, 636: Also the triangle right-angle DVH, had three terms, VD equal
to TN, 6364, and VH 25, then DII will be 25, 797 parts or the same DH is 600
foot. We must then calculate according to this reason, the lines above
mentioned to bring them into feet, saying, as follows.

For the lines in parts determined, to wit, brought into feet.
THe 25, 797 parts, make 600 foot, how many then will BH 35. come to? There
will be for BH 814, 04 foot, likewise VL, or DZ the curtain may be made so; BH
7 parts make 814, 04 foot, how many VL 3? it will come for the curtain to
348, 87, and for BN the Capital line ye shall say, if 35 gives 814, 04: how
many 9? ye shall have for BN 209.32: and so of the other: for TN, or BT, or VD
will be 148. 02, and TV, or the Gorge ND 84 57. and seeing that BH is known, also
VL the half of the remainder will be BV 232, 58. In the triangle right-angle
BVC, the angle B will be 15 degrees: (for PBO is 45, and CBO 30:) and BV being
known, therefore BC the face will be 240, 78, and VC 62, 32, which being taken
from VD, there will remain CD the flanck 85. 7; and therefore the triangle
right-angle CDI, shall have 3 terms, the angle C 75, and CD 85, 7. so DI
will be 319, 84, CI 331, 15, likewise BY flancking 571, 93. and I, Z 29. 03 for
the second flancke. Now OP is known as being the half of BH.

Now of the Pentagons, or Fortresses with five angles or Bulwarks.

6. Figure. and 2. Plate.
In the Pentagone, a Fortress with five Bulwarks, KFBDL, let the line, KL be
63 rods, and divided into 7 equal parts, whereof the Capital line KA is 2 of
them, also LE, and from the Character 2 (or G) let GB be the perpendicular.
Also the angle flancked is 69 degrees, according to the precedent table, how
many then will be the lines and the angles of such a Fortress?

ALB. GIRARD.
Before we come to the Construction hereof, take notice, that KA in this
figure is not answerable to the length of KG, yet ye must suppose them to be
equal, asvvell as the cipher 1, and the letter H, are two differing points,
which would have been the better discerned, if the figure had bin well made,
which may serve as a fore-vvarning for some figures follovving, upon which
one ought not to stand so much as upon the Suppositions, or Hypoteses of the
Propositions.

The triangle right-angle KHA has three terms, KA 18 rodd, the angle AKH 54
degrees, which being of KH will be 10, 5802, and HA or GB 14, 5623. Now if ye
take away KH from KG, there will remain for AB the Gorge, 7. 4198. Item the
curtain BD will be 27 rodd, being equal to GM. And because the angle flancked
is 69 degrees, if ye add thereunto the angle of the Center, which is 72, ye
shall have the angle flancking exterior, 141 degrees, the half of its adjunct
for the interior 19 1/2 degrees. The triangle right-angle KGF, having 3
terms, KG 18, GKF 19 1/2: the face KF will be 19, 0953, and FG 6. 3741, which
being taken from GB 14, 5623. there will remain FB (the flanck) (...), then
the triangle right-angle FBI may be known, seeing that FB is found, and the
angle (...) 1/2 the complement of 1; therefore BY will be 23.1227, which taken
from BD 27, there will remain ID for the second flanck 3, 8773, also FI will be
found to be 24, 5297, whereunto add KF 19. 0953, and ye shall have KI, the
defense flancking 43. 6250, finally the triangle right-angle LGB, having three
terms, to wit LG 45 rodd, and GB 14, 5623; one may easily know BL, and the
distance of the Center of the Fortress by K, because that KP is 31 1/2 rodd,
and the angle AKP 54 degrees.

The 7. Figure, and 2. Plate.
In a Fortress Pentagonall, BOV, let AB the deffence flancking be 50 rodd, the
Flanck ED 9 rodd, and the angle of the Bulwark 72 degrees. How many then will
the other parts of the same make, when the second flanck AG makes five rodd.

THe angle of the Polygone is 108, the half is 54 for FBQ, to which add CBF 36
degrees by the Hypoteses, you shall have 90 for CBQ, but CF is parallel to BQ
therefore BCA right, the triangle BCA will be then the right-angle, and BA of 50,
and the angle B of 72 degrees, then ye shall find BC, or QUOTH to be of 15, 451,
and CA 47, 553, and the angle A 18 degrees. Also in the triangle right-angle
EDA, the angle A is given, and the side ED 9 rodd, by the Hypotese, then EA
will be 29, 12463, and DA 27, 69912; now if ye take EA from DA, there will
remain BE the face 20, 87537, and if ye substract DA from AC, there will
remain CD, or BQ, 19. 854. Also the triangle right-angle BCF, has 3 terms,
BC and the angles; in fine BF the capital line will be 19, 097 and CF, 11, 226,
which being taken from CD, there will remain FD 8, 628, the Gorge; now if to
DA, ye add AG 5 rodd, the second flanck, ye shall have the curtain DG 32.
69912, to which add twice BQ, and ye shall have BV 72, 40711 its half BK 36,
20355, and so the triangle right-angle BKO, having 3 terms, the angle KBO
will be 54 degrees, ye shall find BO 61, 593099, and KO 49, 82984. Finally VB,
BQ being known, then the triangle right angle DQV, having 3 terms given VQ,
and QUOTH; ye shall find the fichant DV easily.

ALB. GIRARD.
IF one will consider the difference which is betvveene this operation, and
that of our Author published in his former Editions, he shall find that this
question is defective, for I have added thereunto (that the second flank AG is
rodd) seeing that in all such questions, where there is a second flank, he
ought to have set down 5 known terms and neither more nor less, without
the one depending on the other, as in this present, the name of the Fortress,
to wit, Pentagonall is a term, in the second place there is the defense; then
the flanck, the angle flancked, and the second flancke, which are five terms:
where ye must note, that when there are reasons in the proposition, and that
though a reason has two numbers, nevertheless it is but one term; but
where there is no second flanck (as in the figures of the first plate, then 4
terms will suffice.) Finally, my Author had so ordained his Supputation,
that in stead of making an addition, or a substraction; he made the rules of
three very great, so that ye must imagine it was easier for me to change all,
then to recorrect it, having no other respect, but to the explication of the
figures, and as much as is lavvfull and possible to show his intention, which
I am bound to do: Moreover, if peradventure same one should find this manner
of operation strange, which I (...) heitherto, it is requisite for him to
know also (be it spoken under ^^^^ection) that he understands not much, if
he does not practice it so himself in other Subjects, yea though I had not
set down one only number; which I should have done already heretofore, if
I had not had regard to the obscurity, which students might pretend to find,
which having cleared heitherto, ye may go on with the more assurance in the
rest follovving: and must also know, that the 8 figure was left without
explication by the Author.

The 8. 9. 10 Figure. and 3. Plate.
In this figure Pentagonall, the angle ELO is divided into 2 equal parts by
LD, the flanck FB 9 rodd, the angle flancked 69 degrees, and the curtain 30
rodd, how many then will the other lines and angles be?

THe angle of the Polygone is parted in the midst by KA, and the angle AKF is
known, also the rest shall be FKG, or its equal FB, whence follows that the
triangle right-angle FBI shall have 3 terms FB, and the angles; therefore the
other 3 terms will be known, also the whole line DB, and the part BY, ergo the
rest ID is the second flank. The triangle KBI has three terms, the angle
found, BY and K (the fourth part of the flanck by consequence the 3 terms
remaining are known, and the difference of the found lines KI, IF will be for
the face KF; which makes that in the triangle right-angle KGF will be known KG.
GF; and if to KG doubled, ye add the curtain, ye shall have KL; also KG to the
curtain is for GL, or XB if to GF ye add FB, ye shall have LX, and therefore
in the triangle right-angle LB will be known; seeing that LX, XB are found.
Moreover, in the triangle right-angle LXE, the angle E is a demi Polygone, and
the line LX being known, ye shall have LE the Capital line, and XE taken from
XD (equal to KG) there will remain DE the Gorge.

The 9. Figure, which is the 8, 9. 10. and 3 Plate.
In the former figure Pentagonall, there are other Hypoteses BL, fichant 60
rodd, the angle DLM 36 degrees, and 45 minutes, DM 17 rodd, and the angle OLE
parted in the midst by LM.

THe angle MLE is 54: from which take DLM 36, 45; there will remain 17, 15;
for DLE its quadruple or fourefould for the angle flancked 69: ye must first
calculate the traingles right-angles MDL, QEL, whereby is found DE the Gorge,
LE the Capital line, and ML in the triangle right-angle LGB; the line of
defense LB 600, and GB 17; therefore ye shall find GL, which added to KG
equal to ML, ye shall have (...) take ML, from it, there will remain GM for
the curtain BD, in the triangle MLO, ye shall find the face OL, and MO, which
taken from 17, there remains OD for the flanck, and the triangle right-angle
ODC may be known, because the angle C, is equal to MLO 19 1/2, then CO and CD
being notified, ye shall find CL and BC, and from the Center of the Fortress
will be known the distances toward K, P, A.

The 10. Figure, which is the 8, 9. 10.
In the figure Pentagonall, let LB fichant be 60 rodd, and LC the defense
flancking 50, 92758 fifth-parts. Also BC the second flancke 9, 53481, and the
angle OLE parted in the midst by LD.

THe triangle BCL having the three sides given, then ye shall find the angle
C, or the lengthning of the basis BC unto the perpendicular X, as follows
here, the basis BC, 9, 53481 gives me the Sum of both the other sides, 110,
92758, how much then will their difference 9, 07242 give? it will come to 105,
54816, from which take the basis (because that the perpendicular falls without,
which is seen, when the said quotient is more then the basis) there will
remain one number, whereof the half is CX 48, 00668, this being done ye must
calculate the triangle right-angle CLX, by which ye shall know the angle C, or
LMO, which taken from LME, the remainder will be OLE, 34 1/2, and the angle
flancked will be the double of it 69; also ye shall have LX, or MD, and then
shall ye calculate the triangle MDL (for the angle MLD is known) seeing it is
equal to MLO 19 1/2, and OLD 17 1/2: Also the triangle LQE, whereby ye shall
find the Gorge, the Capital line, and CD, then by the triangle ODC is found
the flank, and after that the face: and if to CX above said, ye put BC being
given, there will come out BX, or GL, to which add ML by addition, then by
substraction ye shall have KL, and the curtain BD, whereof the numbers agree
with those of the precedent question.

The 11. Figure. 3. Plate.
In this figure Hexagone, that is, a Fortress with six angles or Bulwarks,
let the Curtain be sesquialtere, or half as much again to the face, and the
face to the flancke doubled-sesquialtere, the angle flancked 75 degrees, and DP
distant from the points 70 rodd. We must find out the rest.

SEsquialtere, or one and a half, is as 3 in respect of 2; twice sesquialtere
is as 5 to 2: so that BH, DC, CB will be as 15, 10, 4. whereunto if ye add 4
cifphers to each of them, DC will be 100000 sines of the right-angle. Now ADF is
60, and ADC 37 1/2, then CDF will be 22 1/2 degrees; therefore CF 38268, and DF
92388 also KP; but BH, or FK is 150000, then DB will be 334776 parts, which make
70 rodd by the Hypoteses, we will bring then these lines into Rodds, according
to this reason following; because 334776 parts make 70 Rodd.

How many parts. they will come to.
150000 31, 364 BH 100000 20, 909 DC 40000 8, 364 CB 38268 8, 002 CE 92388 19,
318 DF
And seeing that PD, DF are known, FP will be also; and by FC, CB, will be known
FB, or AE, 16. 366, now by the 47 pro.1 of Euclide BP fichant will be 53, 259:
And if one calculates the triangles CBG, DEA, ye shall find DG, 42, 765; and
DE, 9, 448, ergo OF, or AB the Gorge will be 9, 87; the distance from the Center
to D, is equal to DP, 70 rodd.

The 12. Figure. and 4. Plate.
Let DP be 72 rod, the angles of the Bulwarks are 72 degrees, the curtain BH
32 rod, the flancks of 8, 3638, fourth of rodds, how many then will be the other
parts of this Fortress Hexagonall?

Seeing that DP is 72, and BH, or FK 32, then the half of the rest will be 20 for
DF, and also the angle ABF being 60 degrees, and ADC 37 1/2, then CDF will be 22
1/2 degrees: whereby ye shall know then the triangle right-angle CDF. Secondly,
FC found, with CB given, will make known FB, but PF is 52, then the triangle
right-angle BFP has the sides BF, FP known, and BP will be known in the
triangles right-angles ADE, CBG, their terms will suffice to make the rest to
be understood. when ye have DA, its half will be for DE, which taken from DF,
there will remain AB.

The 13. Figure.
In this Figure Hexagonall, the second flank is in the flank as 6 to 7, the
flank has its gorge as 7 to 10, the Gorge to the line of the Polygone, as 2
to 9. the question is how many they, and the other dimensions will be, when as DH
makes 60 rodd.

IF ye make GH 6, then HO will be 7, and HI 10, the Curtain will be 25; Then ye
shall calculate the triangles CBG, DAG by which ye have the angle G, or his
equal CDF, and the face D^ and then in the triangle DCF, the lines DF, FC, FB,
FP, and finally BF 44, 93555, which make (...)* for which reason one must
reduce the parts into rodds: but this reason may be set down more easy, in
taking but 7, 48926, which make 1000000 parts; Now if ye had rather work it
by multiplication, without division, then ye must take but 100000 parts, which
make 13352 rodd, and so ye shall find

DC 25, 38302 CB 9, 34672 BA 13, 35246 DP 81, 01484 BH 33, 38115 The angle
flancked 79. 33.
The 14. Figure, the 1. of the two.
In this Fortress Hexagonall, let EH be 60 rodd, and EI, BC, KH equal, the
flank KC 8 rodd, it behoues us to find out the rest.

BY the help of the rule of Algeber, ye shall find that the angle EIF will be 69
degrees, 4 1/2 minutes; then in the triangle IBC, the angle I, and the side IB 8
rodd being given, ye shall find BC 20, 9229 for the face EI; also IC will be 22,
4002, then EC will make 43, 3231, the rest is easy, without the second flanck.

The 15. Figure.
This figure has for the flank 10 rodd; the rest being like to the former
they shall be put in order in the Tables following.

The 16. Figure. and 5. Plate.
The flank of this Heptagone, that is, A Fortress with seven angles, or
Bulwarks, makes 10 rodd, the distance of the points 72 rodd, and the angle
flanked 80 degrees, how many then will the rest make, when as the second flank
is 10 rodd.

Seeing that the angle of the Bulwark makes 80 degrees, and the angle of the
Polygone 128:34, 17 the difference divided in the half will be the angle
flanking interior 24, 17, 18 1/2, the flanck CB 10 rodd, whence the triangle
CBG will be known, and by adding GH given to BG, ye shall have the curtain 32,
1623, which taken from DP 72 rod, and then take the half of the rest, ye shall
find DF, and also DC. CF, for the face DC 21, 8525, and DG 46, 1666, also in
the triangle DAE; ye shall have DE, and consequently OF, or AB. Moreover ye
shall find DH in the triangle DKH, to be 55, 4345.

The 17. Figure, and 5. Plate.
This Heptagone has the flank of 9 rodd, the angle flanked 79 degrees 25. 43,
DP ^2 rodd, and the choice of the second flank.

ALB. GIRARD.
Having calculated the angles as in the former. OM will be 21, 6436, and HM, 19
6836, let us make the second flank 7, 3164, and then the curtain will be 26;
DF, 23; the face OP 25, 2901. MP 46, 9337. Marolois had given here 80 degrees,
but took no more then 79, 25, 43, for the angle flanked, which he did without
premeditation.

The 18. Figure. and 5. Plate.
In this present Heptagone the angle flanked is 79 degrees, the gorge 12 rodd,
and the curtain 32 rodd, how much will the other lines and angles make of this
Fortress.

TO resolve this question, ye must suppute from the triangle CBG, the lines CG,
GB, and ye shall have GB the second flank; now if to BG, ye add AB, ye shall
have AG, then the triangle DAG will be known; afterward the triangle DAE, and
finally the triangles DCF, and DHK.

ALB. GIRARD.
NOte that in this Question Marolois had set down the angle flanked 79 and 2
seuenths, yet did not follow this number, but 79 degrees: the same error also
was committed in his supputation of the former, and in the 14 figure. One
cannot guess well his Supposition: nevertheless that needs not to stay the
reader; for I have set down the question, as it seems he would have
propounded it, but the worst is, he made 2 figures, and one cannot understand
well of which of either of them he would speak, but we will speak more
thereof hereafter; howsoever those which are most intricate (as well by reason
of the faults escaped in the impression of the former Editions, as by the
error of his disciples, which did calculate them) shall be partly omitted, and
shall give no impediment, but that the rest may give contentment to the
Readers, for that which they are desirous to find out in this book: (in the
20 figure following the Letters ye were sent unto were wholly repugnant.)

The 19. Figure.
In this Heptagone let the angle flanked be 80 degrees, and the angle from the
Capital line, and from the imagined DB (to wit ADB) let be 22 degrees, DP 82
rodd, and the flank CB 10 rodd.

FRom the angle of the Polygone 128, 34, 17, take the flanked 80, the half of
theremainder will be 24, 17, 9: for the angle flanking interior DGA: beginn then
the triangles CBG, DBG. (whereof the angle in D makes 17) ye shall find BG
22, 1621, CG 24, 3138; and BD 30, 3118, then GD will be 49, 1096, and DC the face
24, 7958, afterward the triangle BDF, the line BF will be found to be 20, 1982,
and DF 22, 6014, whereof the double taken from DP 82, there will remain for
the curtain BH 36, 7972, and consequently for the second flank GH, 14, 6350.
Now knowing the triangle DEA, ye shall find the Capital, also the gorge AB
12, 8744. If in the triangle DKH, ye seek DH, then ye shall find it to be
62, 7388. Now the reason of the Demy-diameter or middle line in the side of
this Heptagone, is as 1000000000, to 867767478.

The 20. Figure.
This present Octogone, that is a Fortress of 8 angles or Bulwarks, has the
distance DP divided into 7 equal parts, whereof DF, and FB make each of them
2, and BP fichant is 60 rod, the angle flanked 82 degrees.

THe line BF being 2, and FP 5, then the square of BP will be 29, and seeing that
BP is 60 rodd, its square will be 3600 rod, by which reason ye may know one part
of the 7 of DP, saying, if 29 gives me 3600, how many will 1 give me (the
square of an other part?) it will come to 124, 1379310345, whereof the square
root subtracted will be 11, 14172, and its double 22, 28344 for DF, or FB, the
triple is 33, 42516 for the curtain BH, and the seventhfould 77, 99204 for DP.
Moreover, the angle flanking interior, or its equal FDC will be 26, 15; so that
DC will be 24, 84581, also FC 10, 98907, the flank then will be 11, 29437 (for FB
was known) in the triangle rightangle DRG, the angle D is also 26. 15; and RC
equal to FB, then DG the line of defense flanking, will be 50, 38218; finally,
the Capital will be found 24, 11937, and the gorge AB 13, 05342, if ye calculate
the triangle DEA.

The 21. Figure.
In this Octogone let the face be 24 rod, the flank 12, and the curtain 36
rod, and the angle flanked, right, it is required how many the other lines and
angles will be?

The angles ADF 67, and ADC 45, will make known CDF to be 22 Now DC is 24 rod,
by consequence DF, FC, DP, FB will be known; also seeing that FB is found (or EA)
ye have also the triangle DEA, by which ye shall find DA, AB, and shall find
DG in the triangle CBG: for having CG, ye add unto it DC) finally DH in the
triangle DKH.

The 22. Figure.
In this present Octogone, the flank is 11 rod, the angle flanked 82 degrees,
the line DP 76 rod, and the second flank to be choosen, how many then will be
the other parts of this Fortress?

THe angle of the Octogone is known, and the angle flanked, also their half
ADF, ADC, therefore the rest, and the triangle CBG will be known, and BG will be
found 22, 3058, suppose the second flank GH is 9, 6942, then BH 32 rod,
likewise as much for FK; but DP is 76, therefore DF makes 22, and after ye have
calculated the triangles DCF, DAE, ye shall find DC, 24, 52978, DG 49, 40045,
AB 12, 94981, and finally in the triangle DKH the fichant DH, 58, 25283.

The 23. Figure.
Let the angle flanked be 82 of this present Octogone, the line of defense DG
50 rod, DP 76, and CAB the half of the angle flanked.

AFter ye have carried AC, which was forgetten, if ye count the triangles DAG,
ACG, ye shall find the Capital, the face, and the gorge, and BG, then the
triangles CBG, DCF, afterward ye shall have CB, CF, DF, and therefore FK, or the
curtain, and the second flank, then DH, 58, 3498.

The Capital 23, 93655 The Gorge 12, 84323 The Flank 11, 26362 The second
flank 9, 15324 The face 24, 53340 The Curtain 31, 99346
The 24. Figure.
Let there be an Enneagone, A fortress with nine Angles or Bulwarks, (that is
with 9 sides) whereof the angle flanked is 85 degrees, the face 24 rod, the
flank 12, and the curtain 36 rod.

THe angle of the Polygone is 140 degrees, seek the triangles, DCF, CBG, DEA,
DKH, and then ye shall find the lines GH 12, 94824: DP 78, 57648: AB 12, 88709.

The 25. Figure.
As in the tables above let the angle flanked of the Enneagone be 85 degrees,
the fichant 60 rod, and DP being 7 parts, then let DF be two of them, afterward
FB the perpendicular 2, for the making of the flank CB, we require the rest.

DK being 5 parts, and KH 2. the square DH will be 29. which makes 3600, whereof
1 makes 124, 13793103 for the square of one part, its root subtracted will be
11, 14172 for one part, whereof the double will be for DF, or FB, and the triple
for FK, or the curtain 33, 42516 BH, and after ye have calculated the
triangles DFC, CBG, DEA, ye shall find the other lines DC 25, 1219, DG, 48,
25855, GH 12, 9026, BC will be 10, 68335, the seven parts of the number above
said will be for DP, 77, 99204.

The 26. Figure.
In this present Enneagone, let the angle flanked be 85 degrees, the defense 50
rod, the other 60, and the gorge in the flank as 4 to 3. the rest is required.

IF ye take away the angle ADC 42 from ADF 70, the angles GDR will remain, and
DG makes 50 rod, then the triangle DGR will be known, to wit, DR, and RG, or KH
23. 0875, which will make ye know the triangle DKH (for DH is 60) then RK, or
GH will be 11, 0301. Moreover, in the triangle DEA the side EA is equal to KH,
by DE and DR, ye shall have AG 35, 94735, then in carrying AC, ye shall seek
the angle A from the triangle ABC, setting down AB 4, and BC 3 parts,
according to the Hypatese, ye shall find then the angle A of 36 degrees, 52
min. and 12. seconds. Then let us go to the triangle ACG, having AG known,
the angle A and G, equal to CDF 27 degrees, to find CG afterward the face,
and consequently DF, FK, OF or AB the Gorge, which will be 14, 72808, therefore
if 4 gives 3, how many then AB? ye shall have BC for the flank 11, 04606, and
DP 78, 51183, DA 24, 56925.

The 27. Figure.
The distance DP being 7 parts, DF and FB each of them 2 parts, the defenses 50
and 60 rod, and the angle flanked 85 degrees, how many will the other
dimensions be of such a Fortress non angular?

ALB. GIRARD.
THis question is impossible to resolve being exceeding, seeing that there is a
condition in it more then one desires, and which is vvorst, repugnant to the
others, for which fault the Author may be excused, seeing that in his time,
there were no such advertisements given as we have given thereof in the
beginning of the Trigonometrie, cited in the first question going before, the
which though they may seem to be of little consequence to some; yet one must
acknowledge, that those that know them shall not fall into the like errors,
as these which may be explained thus; There are two reasons given DP to DF,
and DF to FB (a reason of equality) two lines of defense the angle flanked,
and the name of the figure of nine-side figure, which are six terms, yet one
needs but 5 (as ye shall find it noted in the 7 figure, where the question
was defective, and of some others afterward) finally, the proof of this may
be seen in making comparaison of this with the 25 figure, where the same
question is propounded, and where ye shall find that the defense flanking
ought to be 48, 25855, and here he will have it 50, which is absurd, as is
said.

The 28. Figure.
In this present Decagone, a Fortress with ten angles or Bulwarks, let the
angle flanked be 87 degrees, the Gorge in the flank in reason sesquitertia,
the defenses 50 and 60 rod, it is required how many the other parts thereof
will make?

THe reason sesquitertia is, as 4 to 3, for AB to BC, then the imaginall angle
BAC will be 36 degrees, 52 minutes, 12 seconds. Moreover, the angle ADC being 43
then CDF will be 28, which is an angle of the triangle GDR, and which may be
known, seeing that DG is 50 rod, therefore GR 23, 858, or its equal KH, and
for as much as DH is 60, then DK will be known, and also DR withal, and so ye
shall find RK for the second flank: likewise the triangle DEA will be known,
then ED and DR will make known ER, or AG, and consequently ye shall have the
triangle ACG for the angle A was found above, and the angle G is 28 degrees,
then the face will be 26, 11334, and having found out DF, ye shall find OF, or
the gorge 15, 197: Also FK for the curtain 32, 10821; DP 78, 00619.

The 29. Figure.
In this Decagone the angle flanked maked 87 degrees, the defense fichant 60
rod, the flank 12 rod, and the gorge 16 rod, it is required how much the other
parts make?

THe quadrangle ABCD having five terms given, ye shall find the other parts;
also the triangle DFC, whereby ye have FB, or KH, and consequently the triangle
DKH, and having FD and DK, their sum and difference will be for DP, 78, 65, and
BH 30, 32633; the face shall be 27, 49377: DG 52, 64265.

The 30. Figure.
In this Decagone, let the curtain be 36 rod, and the flank 12, the face 24,
and the reason of the Bulwark in the flanking interior, as 58 to 19.

THe half of 58 is 29, then the angles ADG to AGD, or CDF, will be as 29 to 19,
therefore setting down ADF to CDF, it will be as 48 to 19; but ADF is 72
degrees, then CDF will be 28 degrees, and then the angle flanked 87 degrees, the
rest is easy, for the triangles DCF, CBG will make known CF, FD; DG is 49,
14888, DH 61, 68324; DP 78, 18336, AD 24, 52336.

The 31. Figure.
Let there be a Decagone, whereof the face is 24 rod, the flank 12, and the
curtain 36, how many will those parts make, when the defense flanking is
doubled to the Capital.

IF DG be set down 2. then DA will be 1. Now the angle DAG is 108 degrees, then
the angle flanking interior G will be 28. 23. 38, and the angle flanked 87, 12,
44^ the rest is easy, and is found in the same manner, as the end of the
former, and therefore Marolois leaves its so for this reason.

The 32. Figure.
In this present Vndecagone, a fortress with eleven Bulwarks, let the face be
24 rod, the flank 12, the curtain 36, and the capital DA to AG as 5 to 7,
the unknown parts are required.

SEt down DA 5, and AG 7, and the angle DAG is 106 degrees, and 4 eleuenths:
that is 106, 21, 49, and hence ye shall know the angles remaining ADC, 43, 55,
48, and the other or CDF 29, 42, 23, therefore in the triangle CDF, the angle D
is then so, and DC 24 rod, and then DF, DK, DP will be known, likewise FC, FB,
BP, and AD, DE and OF for the gorge. Here is nothing but that which is ill
calculated by the Autheur, or rather by his disciples, as from the beginning
(without all doubt) seekeing to help themselves with the figure put here under,
which was needless; supposing that they had skill in Trigonometrie. I will
only set down here the reason of the raid (or semy-diameter) in the side of
the Vndecagone inscribed in the Circle, is as 100000000000000
to 563^46511368285.
So that ye may take here the reason or proportion as precisely as ye will.

The 33. Figure.
In this Vndecagone let the face of the curtain be as 2 to 3: and the gorge in
the flank as 4 to 3, the distance of the points of the Bastions 75 rod, and
the angle flanked 88 degrees, 38 min. 11 seconds, the question is how ye shall
find out the other dimensions?

Seeing that ADC, and ADF are known, the rest CDF will be also, being 29, 19, 6,
and setting down DC 2 parts, (then the curtain, or FK will be 3) the triangle
CDF will be known by the parts, namely DF 1, 74384, as much also is KL, and FK
3, then DP will be (in parts) 6, 48768, which make by the Hypotese 75 rod, and by
this reason, ye shall find out the face, and the curtain, saying, if 6, 48768
parts make 75 rod, how many then will make as well 2, as 3? DC 23, 12075, and BH
34, 68112 as much makes FK, which taken from 75, the half of the rest will be
for DF, ye shall find then also FC, afterward AB, being set down upon 4. BC
will be 3, then the triangle BAC will be 36, 52, 12; which taken from DAB, there
will remain DAC, and so the triangle DAC shall have 3 terms, ye shall then
seek DA, or AC, by which ye shall come to have AB 13, 7969, and BC 10, 34743,
then in the triangle CBG, ye shall find BG, afterward DR, or CG being known
ye shall have DG 41, 54579, GH 11, 57496, and finally DH the fichant 58, 96636.

The 34. Figure.
Moreover for this Vndecagone let the angle flanked be 88 degrees 38, 11, and
the face to the curtain as 2 to 3, and the gorge in the flank as 8 to 5. and
the fichant 60 rod, how many will all these lines make?

YE must first find out the Quadrangle ABCD, whereof the angles are known,
and set down AB, 8 parts; then BC will be 5, and DC being found, ye shall find
DF, FC, also BH, seeing that DC is to BH as 2 to 3; having DK, and KH ye shall
have DH in parts, which make 60 rod, by which reason ye have the lines
required, AB, 14, 6, CB 9, 127, DG 42, 374, DC 23, 7363, BH 35, 604, and DP 76,
99675. Upon the 35. Figure.

ALB. GIRARD.
THis question is defective, in regard it has but four terms known, DP 70
rod, and CB 10, the reason of DC to BG is as 10 to 9, and the name of the
figure Undecagonall, which are but 4 terms, he comes to the (...)* setting
down the face 20 rod, to see if there be not in it repugnanci^, as if the
question were exceeding, so that he in this search commits the faulth,
which is called petitio principij. Which is spoken not to defame the Author,
but to show, how this proceeded from hence, that in this time many thought
that Geometry has attained to her highest degree; though we have had but
the A, B, C of it: till that some undertakeing the restoration thereof,
haueing in part made it flourish again, could nevertheless escape the blame
of some envious and ignorant men in this divine science, as happens often, have
let pass the most difficult of the Analitica, which ought to adorn those,
that make profession thereof, who contrariwise setting down the limits of
their pretensions from the beginning of their course; by emulating one an
other, content themselves to grope together without learning to go forvvard
with a solid, and a firm pace in a fair way.

The 36. Figure.
In this Dodecagone, let the face be 24, the flank and the curtain 36 rod,
the angle flanked right, how many will the remaining lines make?

LEt DF be found, also FC, ye shall have DK, and KH for to have DH, afterward
in the triangle DGR, having the angles and RG, ye shall find DG. Finally ye
shall find DE in the triangle DEA, for to have OF, or the gorge: Now seeing
that GCB is 60 degrees, then of necessity GC will be 24, as being as much again
as CB, then DG will be 48, and GR, or KH the half is 12, therefore DH will be 61,
648, DP, 77, 56944.

The 37. Figure.
In this present Dodecagone, let the angle flanked be right, the defenses
flanking, and the fichant 45, and 60 rod, the gorge in the flank is as 4 to 3.

Seeing that the angle DCF is 60 degrees. DH 45 will be the double of GR 22 rod,
DH, HK being known, DK will be 55, 621, DR 38, 971, then the second flank 16,
65. Also DE will be found by the triangle DAE, and taken from DR, there will
remain AG the basis of the triangle ACG, the angle A thereof will be 36, 52, 11,
because of the reason given, and G 60 degrees, then the said triangle ACG will
make known CG 21, 4933, and also the face 23, 5067 (for DG is 45) the half of
GC is CB 10, 7466, which multiplied by 4/3, ye shall have BA 14, 3289, DP 75,
979, BH 35, 2637.

The 38. Figure.
Let the curtain be 36 rod, the line of defense flanking 45, the angle BAC 36,
45, and the flanked right. How many will the other parts of this Fortress
Dodecagonall come to?

THe triangle DAG, afterward ACG will be known, and also CBG, DCF, DKH, whereby
DC will be found 23, 974, GR 22 (the half of DG) 10, 5127, DH 61, 0593. DP, 77,
52516, AB 14, 733.

The 39. Figure.
In this Dodecagone the angle BAC makes 37 degrees, the flanked right, the face
24 rod, the fichant 62, how many makes then the other lines?

THe line DC 24 shall be the double of CF 12; the angle BAC being given, the
triangle DAC, will be known, therefore DA, AC, and the triangles DAE, ACB DGR,
DHK will be known; and consequently the lines required, as AB, 14, 6179. BC, 11,
01525, BH 36, 7851; DP 78, 3547. DA 23, 82709; He failed herein to calculate
them a new together: but the reason of this was, that we agree not, seeing that
in the construction, in stead of 37 for the angle BAC, (as he set down) he
took 38.

All questions coming after this are defective even to the discourse, which
ends the order of the same questions; but seeing I know whither it tends, I
will explane them, in adding thereunto the things, that were wanting passing
over the figures 40, 41, and so we will beginn with the 42, as follows.

The 42. Figure.
In a square Fortress with four Bulwarks, let the angle flanked be 60
degrees, the angle forming the flank FID 40 degrees, the face 24 rod, having
the reason to the curtain as 4 to 5, the other lines are required.

Seek the triangles DAL: AID, IFD, DFP, ye shall find also PH, for FH will be
30: IO 48, 45532: AK 76, 6464, IF 9, 22766: FD, 7, 74298, IA 19, 73479, the
fichant AH 54, 98265.

The 43 Figure.
Is a Pentagone, the angle flanked 69 degrees, the angle forming the flank ^0
degrees, the curtain to the face as 5 to 4, the face 24 rod; we desire to
know the other lengths.

Ye must do as before, and then there will be no difference in the operation,
Touching the number of the names of the figures in this 9 plate, ye shall find
them marked about the angle flanking exterior, the reason of the face to the
curtain is marked on the point of the Bastions, the length as well of the face,
as of the curtain next themselves, and must be proposed as the two former,
having always the angle forming the flank of 40 degrees: the opening of the
flanked angles, is according to the manner of the first table, to wit 15
degrees more then the demy-angle of the Polygone, saving that in the figures 2,
43, and 2, 44, afterward an other time the 45, 46, he takes for the angles
flanked the of the angle of the Polygone, according to the second table in the
beginning placed before: Of these things ye shall find 2 tables in the end of
this book, setting down the faces to the curtains, as 2 to 3, the faces 24
rod, which make the former-flankes 40 degrees, and the flanked according to the
two manners abouesaid, where ye must know, that the lines of defense fichant
are about 60, 61 rod. The said tables are both calculated (...); because of the
errors escaped in the other editions. Moreover, after the Dodecagone ye shall
have over and above following a Fortification upon a right line, which is
called upon a right curtain. Now let us mark what the Author says.

Note 1.
NOw not to take so much pains in remembering the diverse proportions of the
face to the curtain, whereof the Fortress quadrangular, and Pentagonall
Fortress is as 4 to 5, and the Exagonall as 3 to 4, it will not be amiss
(seeing that the line of defense will bear it) to make also the said Fortresses
of the same proportion, as the subsequent, to wit, in reason sesquialtere, as
appears by the 3 figures of the 9 plate, quoted by the numbers 2, 42. 2, 43.
2, 44. where the lines of defense do not much exceed 60 rod, which is as
far as a musket can well carry, and therefore one ought not to exceed this
number; because that always from the flank reciprocally the entrance into the
moate must be defended, which is often done, and most commodiously by the
Musketeers, because that Canon cannot so suddenly (by reason of the weight) be
brought thither, many good occasions are neglected, for which cause they are
preferred before Canon, and in regard a Musket will but carry some 700 feet
point-blanke, Bulwarks ought to be made noe further one from another, for
otherwise the line of defense would be too long, which should cause
imperfection.

Note 2.
IF in stead of taking the face 24 rod, for the line of the Polygone exterior
take 80 rod, and the rest according to the former proportion, the parts will be
brought very near together, as appears by the precede^t Examples, according
to the figures of the 10 plate, marked with the numbers 51. 52. 53. 54. 55. 56.
57. 58, 59, whereof we have made no calculation; because they are easily done
by the former supputations.

Note 3.
THat in all our designs and calculations, we are resolved to use but one
measure only, which is in the 25 plate of our Geometry upon the rule of the
instrument marked number 1, which is a foot divided into 12 equal parts,
whereof 12 foot makes a Rheneland rodd in the territoire of Leyden.

Designs and plat forms of diverse Fortifications.
WE might according to the former supputations give diverse constructions of
the platformes of Fortifications; but considering the great diversity of rules,
(which often causes confusion, and that time will not permit us) we will give
but one simple and general rule for them, which is this following.

The 9 Plate, and the 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 Figures.
FIrst, if the face be given (suppose it to be 24 rod) then ye must do as
follows: Ye shall draw a right line infinite AC from the point A, the angle
CAB shall be made according to the form of the Polygone, upon which A, B shall be
set down the 24 rod abouesayd, as from A to D, and by D is drawn the line,
which forms the angle of the Center of the Bulwark 40 degrees, then must ye
set down upon A, C and A, B, the reason of the curtain to the face that by
the same ye may draw the line infinite A, E, making from the point D, a
parallel with A, C, cutting the said AE, at G, by which point is drawn the
line, that forms the other face G, K, in such sort that the angle G, K, A,
will be equal to the angle D, A, K, and so the figure will be drawn, according to
the said proportion.

The 10. Plate, and the 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, Figures.
SEcondly, if the line from angle to angle be given AB (for example 80 rod) ye
shall then proportion out the face to the curtain sesquialtera, as 2 to 3.
Then in conformity of the table of angles set down before, will be made the
angle CAB, according to its form, to wit, in a square of 15 degrees, in a
Pentagone of 89 degrees, in the Exagone 22 degrees, and so consequently of the
rest, then for the forming of the abouesaid proportion of the face to the
curtain, which is (as we have said) as 2 to 3. as well in a square Fortress as
in a Pentagone, and others following ye shall take upon a scale of a reasonable
greatness 2. which shall be set from A to C, and 3 from A to D, suppose that it
be at C and D, then from the point D will be made the arch G of the distance of
2, (to wit CA) and from C of the distance of D, A, 3, will be made the arches,
which cut between each other at G, by which a right line being drawn to A,
where the same cutting the line FB, as here at F ye have the face of the
Bulwark, and by that the curtain will be known. To know also the line of the
gorge, and the flank, and all the other parts, ye must make the angle forming
the gorge, and the flank of 40 degrees, as is here the angle KIE, cutting the
diameter P, A, at I, from which point I a right line parallel being drawn from
A, B, as is I, N, ye shall draw the line perpendicular to be E, K, which
shall be the flank, and K, I, the line of the gorge of this Fortress, and then
ye have the thing required.

In like manner ye shall find, and mark out the other Fortresses, according
to their several forms, taking heed that as here ye take 2 and 3, ye must
in the others also take 2 and 3, to place them as well upon A, B, as upon A, C,
and the rest being the same; as is in the former construction it will be
needelesse, to give you here any further particular instruction for them. The
3, 50. Figure, and the 9. Plate.

ALBERT GIRARD.
THirdly, When upon the line of the Polygone interior AB, ye desire to
construe, or explane a Fortress, having 5 terms, to wit, the name of the
figure, the angle of the bastion M, The angle forming the flank GBH, and the
reason of the face DG, to the curtain HL, conceiving therein that AB is given.

This figure is in stead of the 2, 50, being vvorth nothing. I am so
constrained to make a new figure, and a new explanation. Let then NBA be
equal to the demy-angle of the Polygone, and let the angle forming the flank
be HBG, LAK, so ye shall have the intersection or cutting betvveene C, then DBF
the half equal to the demy-angle flanked, and finding the point F, so that
AB, to BF is the reason of the curtain to the face, and having drawn CF,
cutting NB at D, and making DG a parallel with FB, meeting with BC, at G, ye
have finally GH the perpendicular with BA, and doing the like also on the
other side, ye shall have all the parts required; the demonstration is
manifest, seeing that C is the common point of the like figures FBA, DGK: then
as FB, to BA: so DG the face, will be to GK, or HL.

The 11. Plate, and 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, ^7, ^^, Figures.
IF there be a question to proportion out the face to the curtain, and the
gorge to the flank, when the line OF is given, ye shall do as the figures in
appearance demonstrate to the eye, namely, ye shall first proportion out the
face to the curtain by the former rules, and make it so that the curtain of
a square Fortress be 300 foot, and the face HF, 250 foot, having reason as 5
to 6, according to which ye shall find the point G, which is the angle of the
shoulder. To find then afterward the gorge and the flank, ye shall make the
covert line GH, which must be divided into 4 equal parts (in four, because ye
would have the reason of the gorge in the flank as 4 to 3) whereof ye must
place three of them from H to I, and then draw I, G, cutting through the
semy-Diameter of the Polygone, which is here squared into A, and then the line
AB being drawn it will be parallel with OF, and so ye have the side of the
Polygone interior, upon which the 2 perpendiculars being drawn GC, HD, ye
have the 2 flanks, and consequently the essential parts of a square
fortification known: ye must also observe the same in the other figures
following.

If the line OF, which is the side of the Polygone exterior (or the distance
of the angles of the Bulwarks) be not given, but only the line AB, the side of
the Polygone interior, ye shall seek out in the tables a Fortress of such a
form, whereof the face to the curtain is as 5 to 6, and shall work it by the
rule of proportion, or else let it be made after the former manner, which is
much more easy, then all the figures of the 11. Plate.

If such a side of a Polygone interior, gives such a side of a Polygone
exterior, what will such a side interior give? and ye shall have the thing
required; to wit, the Polygone exterior, whereby one may easily know the other
parts of the Fortress, when the line AB of the Polygone interior is given.
But if in the tables the proportion be not found, make first upon the line AB
the triangle ARB, whereof the half of the basis has the like reason to the
perpendicular, as ye will have proportioned out the gorge of the flank,
demonstrated by this exemple as 4 to 3, which will be done in setting down upon
the said line AB four equal parts (4 because ye desire to have proportioned
out the gorge to the flank, as 4 to 3) to wit from A to D, raising out of the
point D a perpendicular, and put 3 of the said parts from D to I, then doing
the like on the other side, by this means will be formed the triangle ARB, and
from the points A and B, the angles flanking interior will be made according to
the form of the Polygone, (which is a Pentagone) conformable to the table of
angles described heretofore, as appears by the letters SBA and TAB, which
cut the lines infinite A, L. L, B at the points S, T, and the line S, and T
being drawn, the angles T, S, B, and S, T, A will be equal to the angles S, B,
A, and T, A, B, as appears by the 28 proposition of the first part of Euclide.

According to which the reason of the face being putt to the curtain, upon T,
S, and T, A, namely, the face upon TA, and the curtain upon T, S; ye have the
like distances, and from the points I and X, the arches which cuts between
them in a certain place, by which intersection the line T, V, shall be drawn
cutting the line S, B, at V, then the right line V, L. being drawn passing
through the center L, and cutting A, R at G, ye shall have all the parts of
this Fortress: for having set down the distance R, G, from R to H, from the
same point G is drawn a parallel to S, B, as E, G, cutting the Diagonall line
L, A, at E, the like ye shall find for F, and consequently all the other parts
of the said Fortress Pentagonall. The same must ye also understand of the
other figures following, from the figure 60, to the figure 68. Also ye may
find the point V, in setting down upon T, A, 2 equal parts, such as ye
require, and from the extremity or utmost end, having made it a parallel to S,
T, and upon the same, 3 of those parts, and drawn from the extremity the line
TV, the said point will consequently be known thereby.

NOte that the proportion given here, between the face and the curtain is not
so much to rely fast upon it, as to show that the general rule set down
here before in the 9 and 10 plates, take place also in all other reasons, which
may be propounded. For otherwise we are of the opinion; that the former
figures would rather be accepted then these here, because that the reason of
the curtain to the face is (as we have said above, sesquialtera as well in
square Fortress, as of Pentagonall, and others following. Which for the
facility, and simplicity together with the goodness of them ought to be
preferred before the figures 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, and 68, of the 11
Plate above said. Whereof the face to the curtain is (as the exemples show) of
diverse reasons; in such sort, that hence forward one ought to resolve, that
the reason of the curtain to the face ought in all forms of Fortification to
be sesquialtera, and the face 24 rod, each rod containing 12 foot, the length
whereof is set down in the 25 plate of our Geometry, noted with the
character or the figure 1, and is divided into 12 inches, which rod is used in
the Fortifications of the United Provinces, to the end that the line of defense
may not exceed much above 60 rod, which is about as far as a Musket can well
bear, the gorge to the flank may be made by the rule given in the 11 plate,
according to the reason given, but forasmuch as it is more convenient to make
the angle forming the flank GAC (plate the 11) of 40 degrees which gives the
reason almost as 6 to 7, in my opinion one ought to rest thereupon, and so ye
shall have a general rule for all manner of Fortifications, whither they be
Quadrialtera, Pentagonall, Hexagonall, or the others following, as ye may
perfectly understand by that which shall be said hereafter. In the mean while
note that I give here the reason of the gorge to the flank as 7 to 6, which
ought to be understood in Fortresses without Casemates, but if it were my
intention to make some of them, I would then alter somewhat of the said
proportion.

The manner how to describe succinctly the designs or Plots of some regular
Fortifications.
The 12. Plate, and the 69. Figure.
ALthough one may (by that which we have taught) sufficiently now understand
the order, and Method requisite to be held in all manner of Fortifications: yet
I have thought it good to trace out here some from among the rest, to make the
lovers of this Art to conceive the better my intention, and will begin with a
regular Pentagone, whereof the angle of the center makes 72 degrees, and the
angle of the Polygone 108 degrees, and seeing the angle flanked according to the
table before mentioned, makes 69 degrees: It will be easy to find the angle C,
A, D, which is always equal to the angle flanking interior, and shall find
the same to be 19 degrees, setting then your graduate Instrument upon 19
degrees, it makes the angle CAD, and drawing first the covert line infinite AB,
taking upon the scale 24 parts, or rod: and set then from A to C, drawing
from the point C a perpendicular upon A, B, as is CD afterward having set on
DE the length of the curtain, which is here only 34 rod (because the false
brayes makes the lines of defense too great) and then the distance AD, from B
to E, raising from the E the (...)cular OF, being equal to D, C, and FB drawn
out, the two faces will be known; for to know the center of the Bulwark,
shall be made of 2 lines GA, and GB the Demy-diameter of the Polygone, then your
instrument being set upon 40 degrees, ye shall find the angle HKA, cutting
the said demy-diameter at the same point H: from which point the line HI being
drawn; ye shall have the side of the Polygone interior upon which out of the
points C, and F, shall be drawn the perpendiculars CL and FM, which will form
the flanks, and the gorges of the said Fortress Pentagonall, in the inside of
the side of the Polygone interior shall be drawn a parallel of 5 rod for the
thickness of the rampart, as N, O N, R, and RS, and ye must draw for the
parapett of the rampart a parallel of 20 feet (also in the inside of the said
side of the Polygone HI) and on the outside thereof ye shall draw a parallel
of 20 foot for the falsebray as LX, and yet more outward 20 other foot for
its parapet, and so all the other parts will be traced out, which are within the
moate; for seeing that there is here noe Casemates, the falsebray is carried not
only about the curtains; but also about the flanks, and the faces of the
Bulwarks, in such sort, that the falsebray serves as a Casemats to the said
flanks, the entrance or sallies ought in my opinion to be made in the midst of
the curtains, as covertly as possibly may be; the Bulwarks are made either
massiue, or hollow from Earth; at this present we have drawn them out as
being hollow from earth, and so the superficies, or plain in the midst of the
bulwark N, R, S, H. is of the same height, as the rest of the enclosure of the
Pentagone is, the moate shall be 10 rod broad, which is traced out as follows:
In the point A, or the angle of the Bulwark, shall be made an arch of the
distance of 10 rod, and in the point V make an other arch of somewhat a lesser
extention then the former about 10 or 12 foot, then draw upon the back
thereof a covert line infinite; the like must be done on the otherside of the
Bulwark, and so from place to place, with covert lines being drawn as
abouesaid, the intersections of them will bring forth the angles of the said
moate, as well on the interior as on the exterior parts, ye must make upon the
brinke of the moate exterior a parallel of 20 or 24 foot; for the breadth of
the covert way, and besides somewhat more toward the exterior part, ye shall
make a parallel of 50 foot for the thickness of the parapet thereof, which
shall go down sloaping being only raised toward the covert way, or the
Coridor of 6 foot, and diminishing little by little to the furthest part of the
50 foot, and so ye shall have finished the Icnographia, or ground-draught of
this Fortress Pentagonall, the streets between the ramparts and the housen
ought to be 30 foot, that with the more convenience they may be entrenched in
the time of need, and that the soldiers may stand there in battle-ray. The
streets ought to be made of 24 or 30 foot, and for the market place every side
shall be made 12 rod, and of the same form, as the Polygone is, which is
fortified, being a Pentagone, in which the towne-house is to be made, and other
public buildings, and thus we have finished the form thereof.

The 70. Figure.
THe Profile or draught shall be made in this manner: first a privy line is
drawn from the utmost part thereof, then ye shall begin to lay out the
breath of the ramparts, moates and ways, and as we have set down in our
Icnographia for the breadth of the rampart 66 foot, which make 5 rod, we will
take upon the skale joined to the Profile 66 foot, for to place them upon the
said covert line as from A to B: then as the way of the rounds, which we
otherwise term the falsebray, is counted 20 foot, which one may take upon the
said skale, and remove them upon the said covert line, as from B to I, and the
same 20 foot from I to M, for the breadth of the parapet, then ye shall make an
edge MN of 6 foot, which is called in flemish the Teen, or the toe of the
foot of the parapet, the better to prevent the falling of the same into the
moate: from whence ye must take the breadth of the moate, which shall be 120
foot; for so much makes the 10 rod as from N to Q, from Q to R, ye must draw
out 20 or 24 foot for the covert way, and from R to T 50 foot for the
parapet; and so ye have all the dimensions required. For their heigths above AB
ye shall make a parallel of 14 foot, which shall be the height of the rampart,
and underneath a parallel of 10 foot for the depth of the moate, the talud or
slooping interior of the rampart A, V, ought to be 14 foot, and the talud
exterior XB, must be the half of its height, which is 7 foot, and the
trapeze, or unequal sides given A, D, C, B, being the profile of the rampart:
for its parapet ye shall take 20 foot from C to E, and from the point E draw a
perpendicular of 6 foot, which shall be the height of the said parapet, and upon
the said perpendicular EG shall be laid out 4 foot to draw a parallel to DC,
cutting the line B, H, at H, which shall be the height of the said parapet in
this place, and for the superior part ye shall draw the line GH. Your foot
bank shall be made as follows: from E is drawn the line FE of 3 foot, and 1
foot high, then from the upper part of the footebanke make the line G 2. in
such sort, that the said footbanke shall not be broader in height then 2 foot,
and shall have the talud 1 foot, which shall be the talud interior of the said
parapet. The parapet of the falsebray IM shall be made as is above said; to wit,
from the point I, is raised the perpendicular IK of 6 foot, which shall be the
height of the said parapet, and from I toward B draw 3 foot for the
footebanke, being a foot and a half high, and so draw out the line K2, that
the breadth of the upper part of the footebanke be not (as we have said) above
2 foot, in such sort that the Talud interior (after ye have drawn out the
said line K 2) of the said parapet shall be but a foot: for from the point I,
the foot bank is 3 foot broad, but in the point 3 it is found to be but 2
foot broad. For the moate first draw out NO, which is the brinke interior
thereof, having the talud, as much as is the depth of the moate, to wit, of 10
foot, likewise the line Q, P, is taken, which is the brinke exterior of the
said moate, the parapet of the covert way Q, P, is made by rising from the
point R, the perpe^dicular line RS of 6 foot, taking from the said point R
toward the left hand 3 foot for the breadth of the footbanke, and to make it a
foot and a half high; To give the more firmness to the said parapet, there
shall be made from the upper part of the point S an oblique line upon the said
footebanke, which is (as is before said) three foot broad; in such sort, that
the said line declining a foot upon the said footebanke, makes the said
footebanke to be noe broader then 2 foot. Finally a right line is drawn from
S to T, which makes the slooping of the said parapet.

Note.
WE have made the rampare no higher then 14 foot, upon the upper part whereof
is made a parapet of 6 foot high, all upon a plain field, which is a
convenient heith for a place, that has noe hills or heigths about it, but in
case there be any hills, that do command the said place, it will be then
necessary to raise the rampart somewhat higher, then is here described,
answerable to the height of the said hill, which otherwise would command the
Fortress, and for the better blinding of such places, sometimes one makes upon
the upper part of the rampart an other parapet about 7 foot broad, or there
abouts and 6 foot high, which Parapet serves so much the better to blind the
said place, and to discouver the fields about it, but when an Ennemy has
approached near unto such places, then the said parapet can do them no further
service, so that necessity will compel them to take it away for their more
safeguard, and to lie under the said parapet of 20 foot broad: for Canon shot
coming every time to pierce the said parapet being but 7 footebroade; they
cannot safely lodge behind it, without extreme danger; and therefore is
necessary to be razed, to make use of the other, which is able to resist the
force of Canon.

We have not made here in this 79 figure any Ravelins or half moons, which
are loose pieces on the further side of a moate, neither any Catts, or high
platformes to plant ordinance upon, which are usually made in diverse places
within Forts, and upon Bulwarks; because we intend to speak of them hereafter.
In the mean while it will be good to note, that the said Cats, Ravelins, and
other works, may be applied to this present Fortification, but in this place
is omitted for the avoiding of prolixity, because we are minded to treat of
them briefly in an other place.

The description of the design or the plate form of a Fortress Hexagonall.
The 13. Plate, and 71. Figure.
LEt there be given a Fortress Hexagonall to be fortified, whereof the face AC
makes 24 rod, and the angle flanked 80 degrees, according to which the angle
flanking interior will make 20 degrees, and the exterior 140 degrees, and let
the curtain be 30 rod, which gives the reason of the face to the curtain, as
3 to 4. To do this, ye shall draw the covert line infinite, A, B, and by the
help of an instrument graduate, the other angle CAD of 20 degrees (of 20,
because that the angle flanking interior, which is always equal to it makes
here 20 degrees) by means of the line indefinite AC, upon which ye make the
length of the face 24 rod, as from A to C, from which point C, the
perpendicular CD being drawn upon the line A, B, shall be placed from D, the
length of the curtain, which is here 32 rod as from D to E, finally the
distance AD from E to B, and the perpendicular OF the distance of CD as from E
to F, drawing the line FB, ye have the other face, so that all the parts of the
reason given are described; and for to find the curtain, ye must make first
the angles GAB, and GBA of 60 degr. seeing the whole angle of the Polygone
makes 120 degr. by the lines AG, GB, which cutting through on an other at G,
is the center of the Polygone, and seeing the gorge, when as ye would make
casemates in them or in a bulwark where Cats or mounts are raised, they had
need of a larger extent, then otherwise; we suppose that it were requisite, to
make Casemates in them, to that end we make the angle HKA, which otherwise
might be but 40 degrees only of 35, according to which the gorge in the flank
will be almost as 4 to 3, or somewhat more by reason of the line H, K, cutting
the line Diagonall AG at H, from which point H the line HN being drawn,
parallel to AB, ye shall have the Polygone interior, upon which the lines CL,
and FM, being drawn in length the lines DC to L, and OF to M; in so doing all
the essential parts of the said Fortress, will be described; Now to continue
the same draught or platform in every place ye shall make from the center G a
privy circle from the distance GB, and shall be set upon the privy
circumference the distance AB, which being the 6 part of the said figure
Hexagonall, the said circumference will contain justly still five parts, which
finally will come to end at A. In the like manner is the privy circle made out
of the same center G, and from the distance G, N, upon the circumference
thereof shall be set the line of the Polygone interior HN, afterward ye must
only coppie out the rest. Moreover, the parapet wilbet 20 foot, which shall be
made in the inside of ACL. MFB, and as the way of the rounds, or the falsebray,
is on the outside of the body of the Fortress, we will make parallells toward
the moate of 20 foot broad, and then 20 foot more for the parapet thereof, on
the outside of the parapet, before ye come to the moate, is made an edge, or a
toe of 6 or 8 foot, to keep the said parapet from falling into the moate,
which is made of 140, or 150 foot or thereabouts, as necessity, and the
bottom requires; for it must be fitted according to this consideration,
because the ground lying low, it will not bear much digging before ye come to
water, and therefore in this place one is forced to make the moate to get
earth enough for the rampart, but when the ground lies high, then ye may digg
very deep before ye come to the water, and so by this means ye may have
as much earth, as possibly ye can well use, and seeing without it cannot be but
hurtful, it will be better not to make the moate so broad, that ye may receive
noe hindrance or hurt by the store of Earth that it affords; which may be
cast upon the outside: For to believe that the ramparts being raised higher
then the dimension given in the former figure to wit of 14; or at least 15
foot, that they were better as some have mainteyned, yet experience has
shown many times the contrary, for an ennemie having once approached to the
brinke of the moate, the breadth of the parapet hinders one from making any
defense upon it, which notwithstanding is most necessary: because the nearer
an ennemie comes with his approches toward us, we ought the more to defend our
selves, and this being committed by our default, it is too manifest that one
ought to take heed of it, and to remedy this error by the former way: namely
in making the rampart of the height abouesaid. Some are of the opinion by a
simple command that one ought to heigthen the ramparts above the said 14 or 15
foot, and not the Bulwarks, for which they have some reason; for indeed the
Bulwarks make the greatest defense, and when an ennemy is become master of the
said bulwark, there were a means to command the said bulwark more
absolutely, so that an ennemy could not hinder the use of them, if he raised
not his works above the said rampart, to hinder the defenses of the besieged,
which they might make with the said ramparts so raised by a simple command,
which in some manner might hinder the intents and approches of the besiegers,
the more easy would the entrenchements be made, and seeing the more the
bulwarks are raised, the more one ought to use diligence about the
entrenchment; hence would follow this difficulty, that the coming to the
rampart or the bulwark, would not be so easy, as otherwise, neither could one
make any great defense from such ramparts by reason of their too much height,
in such sort that one bulwark ought to defend an other, and in such a case the
second flank would be of noe use after an ennemy is entered into the moate, at
which time it is then most needful to give the greatest resistance that may
be, seeing that when they are gotten over the moate, and taken in the foot of
the bulwark, then the courage of the besiegers begins to increase, and the
besieged to fail them, for it is too apparent, that many times resistance
fails in such and the like accidents.

Between two bulwarks are commonly made ravelins or half moons, which are
Quadrangular figures, every face containing 12, 15, or sometimes 20 rod, which
beginn at the brinke of the moate: so that its angle interior, or the tenaille
O, lies just upon the brinke and angle of the moate, the reason why their faces
P, Q, and Q, R, are made of a greater distance, is that the deffence may be the
better: for otherwise their could be noe defense made but from one part of the
face of the bulwark, which otherwise would not be sufficient to hinder the
assaults of an ennemie, which ravelins or loose pieces li^ so open and are
raised above the plain field some four foot, that one may the easier
discover the said field, and so also to prevent the inconveniences which might
happen, when one would give fire from them upon the besiegers, (if the said
ravelin had not been raised) which would have annoyed those which were under
the covert way. Upon the said Ravelin being so raised, is made a parapet of 20
foot broad, and 6 foot high, which will be able to resist Canon, the moate
whereof ought to be made 50, or 60 foot, and as deep, as possibly may be
about the said moate, ye must make also a cover way of some 20 foot broad, as
has been noted before; Afterward ye must make a parapet of 50 foot broad and
six foot high, ending at the end of the 50 foot toward the plain field; as
the profile does show in the 72 figure, and to the intent ye may the better
understand my meaning, we have made the said Hexagone in perspectiue, with the
falsebrayes, Ravelins, covert ways, and their parapets apart, as appears by
the second 71 figure, but ye must note, that the said Ravelins must be in
respect of Ramparts, which have a double height, to see in them the more
perfection, also a double height, to make them show the better: for otherwise
they would seem too little for the reason abouesaid against our intention.

The 72. Figure.
THe Profile shall be made as in the 12 Plate of the former figure 70, by drawing
a privy line infinite, and taking upon it all the dimensions, as first the
breadth of the ramparts, the parapets, the falsebrayes, its parapet, the breadth
of the moate, the covert way, and the other parts of the said profile; and
seeing we have here ordained Ravelins, we will make this profile from the
midst of the rampart, passing also through the midst of the Raveline, that ye
may the better understand our meaning. According to which ye shall take the
breadth of the Rampart 68 foot from A to C, from C to D 20 foot, from D to E
20 foot, and from E to F 6 foot, the breadth of the moate shall be 150 foot, as
from F to G, which ought to be broader, but seeing the distance falls out too
little, it shall be made but of 150 foot, the Raveline ought to have in this
place 180 foot, but seeing the ground fail us, we have made the dimension
thereof 180 foot, but this hindrance would not permit us, to make it of that
competent greatness as it ought, which I speak to give noe stop to the
Reader, which Ravelin is raised 4 foot above the plain field from 6 to T,
upon which a parapet is made, whereof the basis shall be 20 foot broad, and 6
foot high, to wit its breadth from Q to R, and the height from Q to S, the
footebankes are made of the same breadth and height, and therefore I will make
here no mention of them, neither of the taluds or sloopings of Ramparts,
Parapets, and moates; as well the interior, as the exterior parts are made
according to the nature of the soil; for by how much the ground is lean and
sandy, by so much ye ought to give it the talud, and by that means ye shall
hinder the falling down of the works, for which reason often times ye must
give on the exterior side, being a sandy ground, as much talude as height,
and if the said Ravelin be also raised 4 foot above the plain field, me
thinks it will not be amiss, to raise the rampart thereof, which is 15 foot,
some 6 foot higher to command the better the said Raueline, and leave the
Bulwarks of the height of 15 foot, that all inconveniences may be prevented:
on the outside of the Raveline is made the edge HI of 6 foot, and a moate of
50 foot, then the covert way 20 foot, and the parapet LN 60 foot, with a
footebanke of the ordinary breadth of 3 foot in that manner, as the 72 figure
demonstrateth.

The description of the plote of a Fortress Heptagonall.
The 14. Plate, and 73. Figure.
LEt there be given to be fortified a Heptagone, whereof the side of the
Polygone exterior makes 63 rod, and the angle flanked 80 degrees. To do
this, ye shall first divide the said side AB into 7 equal parts, as ye see by
the points 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. and from the points of the 5 and 2 parts the
perpendiculars D, N, and E, O shall be drawn being equal to A, D, and E, B, to
wit, either of them 2 seventh parts of the line A, B, then ye shall draw from
the extremities, or the utmost parts of these perpendiculars, the privy line
infinite H, I. which shall be the side of the Polygone interior, and by
consequence N, O the curtain. The angles C, A, B, and C, B, A, shall be made by
the help of a graduate-instrument, as our compass is, or an other; either of
64 degrees; in such sort that the intersection of the lines A, C. C, B, which
is C, shall be the center of the said Fortress Heptagonall. Afterward I, B, 8,
of the 40 degr. which is the half of the angle flanked, that ye may have the
whole angle of 80 degr. according to the Hypotheses, and where the said lines
cut the said perpendiculars D, N, and E, O, in the points 2. and 8, ye shall
have the faces A 2. and B 8, the flanks N. 2. and O. 8, and also the gorges H,
N. and O, I, the Parapets, Ramparts, Falsebrayes and for the other parts of
this Fortress, ye shall do the like as has been taught in the former figure
Hexagonall, the faces in this present Raveline shall be made of 15 rod, the moate
of 10 rod, and the moate to the Ravelin of 15 foot, then about it shall be made
a covert way of 20 foot, and a parapet of 60 foot broad descending (as we
have said before) sloopingly. According to this form the flank will be then
made of a reasonable greatness, but the gorge so much the lesser, which may be
made so, seeing ye intend not to make any flanks in the Casemates, but in case
ye would, ye must then make the flank the lesser, and consequently the gorge
the greater, to the end ye may have space enough for to make within them the
said Casemates. The like is to be understood when ye mean to make a Catt upon
the Bulwark, for the gorge being so little (besides other inconveniences) it is
impossible to make there such a body, in reserving sufficient space for the
flanks, which me thinks in such places, that have such narrow gorges, it were
better to make the said Cats upon the Curtain, yet so that they be noe
hindrance to the Rounds going along the Ramparts, for which reason they ought
to be made more inward, and so that they may lie as near the rampart as
possibly may be, the better to discouver, and command the fields about them.

The 74. 75. Figures.
THe figure 74 is the profile of the Rampart, Falsebray, its Parapet, moate,
covert way, and its parapet, whereof the length, breadth, height and depth are
marked out in the said figure 74, which is a section of the Bulwarck, as the
figure 75, the section of the midst of the Rampart, and because all the profile
cannot commodiously be drawn out, we have represented but a part of the moate,
the form of the Raveline, its height, and the form of its parapet, the breadth
and the depth of its side, with their taluds or sloopings, the covert way with
its parapet and footebanke, as ye may exactly note by the figures hereunto
annexed.

The 2. of the 14. Plate.
ANd for the better facilitating of that (...) we have spoken of this present
figure 73. we have added hereu^to the platform of the Fortress of Coverden in
Frizland, whereby ye may the better understand our intention, being accounted
the master piece, and the most regular, and royal Fort in the Low Countries,
having a Falsebraye, Rauelins, or half moons, covertwayes, with which we will
put an end to the description of our regular Fortresses.

A succint description of some other works in the said Heptagone, which are of
an other manner of making then the former.
The 15. Plate, and 76. Figure.
LEt the side of the Polygone interior be B, C, upon which ye would have a
part of a Fortress Heptagonall made, whereof the face to the curtain is as 3
to 4. and the gorge to the flank as 13 to 9. To do this, ye must do as we
have taught you in the 11. Plate, or in the 9. Plate, and Figure 3. 50, where
ye shall find the proportion requisite: on the outside of the same face,
shall be made the parallells each of 20 foot, as well for the parapet, as for the
falsebray, the like is to be done in the flanks, and curtains, and on the
inside a parallel of 20 foot, with an other parallel of 72 foot for the
breadth of the Rampart in the basis, in the same manner as this 76 figure
shows, on the outside ye shall make a parallel of 10 rod for the breadth of
the moate, and upon the brinke of it to the tenaille, ye shall lay out the
Ravelins, as we have said in the former figure 73, in the angles of the
Bulwarks ye shall make also Ravelins, such as ye see here marked with I, K, L,
M, which shall be defended by the Ravelins E, F, G, H, and the better to defend
the said ravelins, which are in the angles of the Bulwarks, ye shall make the
other works N, O, P, and Q, which are called Horne-works, which are made in
such a manner, that the moates of these Horneworks comes to answer to the
Falsebray, which is in the flanks of the Bulwarks: so that their breadth S, T,
makes about 32 rod, of which distance the two demy-Bulwarks V, X, are made
(whereof the face, and the curtain are of a like greatness) according to the
rule prescribed in the 10. Plate, the flanks will be found, making from the
angle of the shoulder, two lines perpendicular upon the curtain, which is
directly opposite to it. even as the figures 77, 78 demonstrate. The utmost
angles of the said Horneworks ought not to be further from the curtain of the
Fortress, then a Musket can carry point-blanke, which is 60 rod or there
abouts, and if the Rauelins OF, GH, are not made in the tenailles, then ye may
cut the said Hornworke, as is here marked out in the 78 figure: the breadth of
the moate shall be 24 or 25 foot: The Rampart here is noe otherwise then the
parapet of the same breadth.

The depth of the moate may be made 6 foot in case the ground lies low; but
otherwise the deeper it is made it will be so much the better, the breadth will
not hinder it, though it were made but 36 foot; for according to the same
breadth and depth ye may enlarge the Rampart, as well in height as in breadth,
upon which afterward ye may make a parapet as great as it can well bear: but
when haste requires, I would make noe Rampart, but only a Parapet of 24 foot
thick, as we have made here being 6 foot high, and a footbanke of 3 or 4
foot.

The figure 79 marketh out a Profile, which is a section or cut drawn through
the midst of a curtain passing through the midst of the Ravelines G, and
traversing through the Horneworke P, and the Rampart and the moate. The true
dimensions thereof are clearly expressed in the said Profile, by the help of
the scale; joined to it: as also by the means of the Alphabeticall letters,
showing the feet to be 12 inches, whereof the length is (...) in the 25 Plate
of our Geometry.

The benefit of such works are well known, when they are made in places of
advantage for deffence, or where noe men, victuals, and ammunition of war are
wanting, as also where the ground is of a reasonable largeness, to wit at the
least 32 rod, that the faces of the said horneworkes may be about 12 rod, which
is the least length that one can give to such works, against the attempt,
which may be given by an Army: and as a great assault, cannot be resisted with
a few men, but up a small room: so is it manifest that the greatness and
largeness of such a place, must be answerable. Therefore in my opinion, it is
a thing repugnant to the rule of Fortification, to make such Horneworkes in the
angles of Bulwarks, where they are so straightned. For Demy-bulwarkes cannot
(by reason of their smallness) be well mainteyned and defended, and on the
other side, their two vvings cannot be defended from the maine Fortress, but
with great disadvantage, as we intend to discuss: thereof more at large
hereafter in the plateforme of Gulick.

How Citadels, or Castles may be joined to Towns, or Towns to Castles,
The 16. Plate, and the 81. 82. Figures.
FOr to build a Castle (or a Citadell) to a Town, either to help to defend it
the better, or to curb it: ye must find out first the most advantageous
place: in case there be a river, then ye shall build your Castle upon the side
of it, where it may best command, with all the advantage that possibly may be,
also taking heed that it be built in such a place, that the Castle may
receive noe disadvantage thereby, but that the Rampart of the Town where the
letters A, G are, be the weakest part; to the end that by this means, ye may
frustrate the desire of the inhabitans of the said town, from opposing
themselves against the said Castle: but if ye fear noe such inconvenience, ye
may make the places A, G, as strong as the other: saving that the Ramparts in
the said angles be noe thicker in the angles A, G (which are angles of
imperfect Bulwarks) then in other places, and not massiue or full of earth, as
the Bulwarks B, and C, D, are. Let there be a town then containing 8 angles,
whereof 7 of them are marked out with these Alphabeticall letters A, B, C, D,
E, F, and G, and that you are desirous to make a Pentagonall Citadell. For the
doing whereof ye must first make a mapp of the said town Octogonall: in case
it be not made, according to the method given heretofore in our Geometry,
which is here marked out by these letters A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, with the
Falsebrays, Parapets, Moates, Covert way, and its Parapet. Then upon a paper of
the same scale, whereof the mapp of the said town is made, being traced out in
a Pentagone with all the outworkes, such as the figure marked H, I, K, L, M,
demonstrats, according to the method given you before in the 10 and 11 Plates,
then the same figure Pentagonall must be cut perfectly, and so fitted to the
town, removing it so long till you have at length found out the most
advantageous place to make there your Castle Pentagone, taking heed that the
tenailles N and O, fall out right, to answer the curtains P, O, and Q, N, to
the end that the entrance into the town may be the more commodious, and that
the town in the places N, R, S, T, O, be not discovered without, whereof one
ought to have a singular care: for there where the said angles of the tenaille,
be not well joined to the Ramparts, those places will always be badly defended
in the said joynings, as ye may observe in the Castle of Gulick, which
platform follows next. It is true; that when ye make these angles in the
curtains, that the parts N, R, S, T, O, take up a great deal of the town,
which may be prevented in setting the Castle more outward, and making the said
curtains meet nearer the faces of the Bulwarks of the Castle. But the side of
the town N, R, S, T, O, will in noe wise be guarded, as the Platform of the
Castle of Gulick shows: so that necessity will require, for the preventing of
such an inconveniencie, to make some Ravelins, or some other works without the
said place, as the commodiousnesse of the ground may afforde, which would make
me resolve rather to approve of the form of the 80 figure, then of the other,
were it not for some cause more urgent, then is here alleged, which reason
would move me to change my opinion.

If the town or City A, B, C, D, E, F, G, were greater, then were it
unnecessary to take so much care for the place, which the Castle takes up: for
then ye might make the curtains P, O, and Q, N, longer, to wit some 50 rod,
that the flanks V, X, and Y, Z, might not come so near the Bulwarks E, M: from
whence one may easily discover the Falsebray of the Castle, for the preventing
of which inconvenience, it will be good to raise the Bulwarks of the Castle,
which looks into the town, somewhat higher above the Ramparts thereof, but the
town being of a small circuit (as we have said) one shall be constrained to use
for it the same figures as are demonstrated by the figures 80. and 81.

If one would built a town to a Castle, first ye must observe diligently the
site of the place, and if it may be made regular, to take care, how many
Inhabitants this place will contain, the nature and quality of them, and
whether the town may in process of time be enlarged: which ye shall be able to
judge, when ye see the country that lies about it, what ways, avenues and
passages there are to come to it, as also to consider the goodness of the
air, and of the soil of all which things (as Vitruvius says) one ought to
have a most special care. According to all which one ought to govern
themselves: for to enclosse a great piece of ground, where there is none, or
little appearance of Inhabitants, this were rather to ruinate, then to edify,
to which taking heed then, ye must resolve of the Circuit, or Capacity, which
ye would give to the said town, and suppose ye would make the form thereof
Octogonall, and regular: ye must trace out then an Octogonall Fortress
regular, according to the former method, with covert ways, and what ye require
more upon the same scale, as you made your Castle Pentagonall, then ye must
cut the said form Octogonall, and join it to the said Castle, removing it so
long, till you have found out and chosen out (with all circumspection
requisite) the most convenientest place, and staying there ye may trace out the
said town, as the figures 80 and 81 demonstrate, joined to the Castle. But as
we have said, it will loose much of its capacity, because the curtains of the
town will come to meet with the angles of the tenailles of the Castle in the
points marked O, and N.

The 17. Plate, and the 82. 83. Figure.
IF ye will not tie your self so precisely to this form Octogonall, ye may
make the town much better by the means which we will now speak of. Let
first be drawn the lines D, D, and A, A. etc. right perpendiculars upon the
midst of the curtains N, M, and K, Y, of some 60 rod, or there abouts, then
let there be made the perpendicular line infinite in the midst, and upon the
curtain D, E; in which ye have the center of the circle, which makes the
circle of all the figure, and suppose ye desire to make a form regular of nine
Bulwarks, whereof the angles flanked, are distant one from an other 80 rod,
from the utmost end Q, shall be made an arch, in such sort, that within the
circuit thereof the distance N, P, is contained 9 times, which shall make the
point of the center C, C. then upon the circumference of the said arch the said
9 points, being marked as they are noted here by the letters Q, R, S, T, V, X,
Y, Z, etc ye shall make the angles interior flanking, according to their
form, that ye may have the angle flanked right, and that ye may the better
make the angle flanking, or the tenaille pointed and small, which is accounted
the best, as that skillful, and diligent man M. John Errard of Barleduke,
Ingenier to the King of France has observed well, and to know how much the
said angle flanking will make, ye must substract the half of the angle from
the Bulwark, or flanked from the half of the angle of the Polygone, the rest
shall be the angle flanking interior. But if the angle of the Polygone be lesser
then 150 degrees, which is the angle of a Dodecagone, ye shall then govern
your self according to the table given before, taking heed that the angle of
the Polygone agrees most with the angle to be fortified, and in its column is
found the angle flanking interior, necessary to the said angle, by which ye
may come to the angle of the tenaille, and seeing in this exemple we have set
down the distance from angle to angle, as well of the Pentag. as of the town
80 rod, we will set down upon the lines, which make the tenailles 2 equal
parts, and from the said 2 parts in the line which forms the angle flanking,
a parallel line being drawn to that of 80 rod, and placed upon the 3 equal
parts, a privy line infinite, must be drawn through the said 3 point, and
through the angle, and where the same comes to cut the other side of the
tenaille in the point O, ye shall have the shoulder, through which the line A,
B, being drawn, making the angle forming the flank 40 degrees, ye shall have
the center of the Bulwarks justas we have taught heretofore in the 10 and 11
plates. If the Castle had bin made with four angles, the construction would
have been the same, and if the lines D, D, Q, and A, A, etc. had been somewhat
more then 60 rod, the form would have been better, for though we have made the
lines of defense, to be 60 rod in the former Fortresses, there is an other
consideration in this present building; in regard the Bulwarks Q, etc. advance
themselves toward the angles Q, etc. from whence the said curtains Q, E, E.
and B, B etc. may be sufficiently defended, when they do not exceed above 70
rod, the moates, covert ways, falsebrayes and other works, must be made in
that form as we have set them down before in the 16. plate.

How to describe the order which is observed in making of a platform, and of
some other appendances.
THe draught being made upon a paper, ere ye make a platform of it, ye ought
first to ouercast, as well the lines, as the body of the Fortress, in that
manner as we have shown you before in our Geometry, that ye may know
pertinently all the particular dimensions, and so committ noe error, in
making a plateforme thereof: Before ye let it out, according to our Method
given in the conclusion of the practice of Geometry, which being done before
the Inginier begins the work, he shall declare the particular conditions,
which he would have observed in the making and finishing of this work, as the
time when they are to beginn, how long it will be before it be finished, how many
men he must ordinarily have to work, what instruments they must use for the
driving in of piles, and the laying of the foundation, how many foot, and what
edge they are to give to the wall, or the parapet of the falsebray, the
thickness of the parapet, and how broad the falsebray ought to be, how much
the talud (or slooping) on the inside and on the outside must be* and that
according to the goodness or weakness of the matter upon which one builds,
how many bundles of brush in a sand^e Earth he is to lay in the parapet of the
falsebray, and in the Rampart, the height, the Talud or slooping, both on the
inside, and on the outside, the breadth and depth of the moate, and its
slooping, and generally and specially all things touching the making of such a
Castle, whereof he has made his platform. And some days before they come to
the place, or that the form be drawn out, they shall set up billets in the
next adjoining towns to give notice to the Work masters, that upon such and
such a day, one is resolved to hire and let out such and such works, to him
that will take them on upon the least price: and before the day prefixed the
said Inginier shall come thither himself with some one of the Deputies, or some
other that has the managing of that work, to draw a draught of the said
Fortress, and to prepare all things necessary against that day assigned. Then
tho day being come, all the Worke-masters and Undertakers shall come together,
either upon the place where the work is to be made, or else in some other
place where the conditions and covenants are read, according as they will have
the work hastened: this done, they shall demand, who will take it on for the
least money, then one of the Workemasters will say for so much, an other for so
much lesser, which is done till noe man will take it on at a lesser rate, then
underneath they sign unto the articles of the conditions, that I N, N, have
undertaken the work upon such and such conditions, for the sum of so much
money: sometimes ye shall have two or three Undertakers join together and
undertake the whole work, all of them signing to the articles, as also the
Commissioners, and Inginier must do on their part: then they beginn the work,
and commonly the Undertakers are bound by the said articles and Contracts, to
deliver all the materials necessary for the said work, which they receive
from the Master of the Magazin there or else, where giving him a note under
their hands for the restitution of them back again, when the work is
finished, and to make good whatsoever they either break or loose.

Then the Workemaster places his men in order, as he knows the quality of the
work requires best, some to digg, and cast up the Earth, others to fill
Karrs, and Wheele-barrowes, others to level the ground which is pricked out;
for in the beginning it will be necessary to carry the Earth away, with a Horse
and a Karre, which is cast up on the outside of the moate upon the basis of the
Rampart, and not with Wheele-barrowes as they must do at the last, when the
work grows high, and that ye are come to the depth of the moate, for then ye
cannot so well use Horse and Karrs; by reason of the difficulties known to all
men, namely, that the treading of the horses and the Karrs spoil the
groundworke, and cannot be laid so well, as when men brings the Earth up in
Wheele-barrowes upon away ascending with plancies, as has been found by
experience often times by the undertakers of such works.

Of the Foundations.
2. The 17. Plate.
WHen the foundation is bad, it will be your best course to drive in piles, along
the foot of the Rampart, just where the said Rampart begins, some piles 25,
or 30 foot, or else young Alders-trees, about four or five years growth along
the work about 18 or 20 foot long, closse one to an other, and the closser
the better, and though this be a great charge, and a long work; yet this is
the best foundation ye can choose: But as we have said oftentimes, seeing it
happens that one cannot stay so long, ye must then take bundles of brush, and
bind them up in fagots, and lay them crossewise, driving them into the Earth
with stakes to fasten them together, that they may lie firm, and if ye lay the
foundation in a ditch or a quagmire, ye must make use of such fagots bound and
tied up together with cords, and if it be in a river, then ye must bind
brickbats, or stones between two bundles, to make them sink to the botome: ye
may make them as long, or as short as ye please, and so necessity requires,
till ye have filled up the water with these sinkers, upon which you must lay
your foundation, then ye must also drive in some piles about 18 or 20 foot
long, (according to the depth) to make them lie the more firm and solid
together. Now these bundles are made in the form of Saucidges, as here
follows.

First, ye drive into the ground stakes of the height and breadth as ye desire
to make these Saucidges, either great or small, the one a foot high, the other
a foot and a half, and sometimes two foot, then ye lay between these stakes
bulrushes, boughs or small bundles of brush bound fast together, and in the
midst of them ye must lay brick-bats, when ye sink them in a river, but of
Earth if ye will lay them as a foundation in a moate all along the said work,
then ye bind the said bundles with stones, or Earth in them, fastening them
with withs in the same manner, as ye bind up a faggot, or a bavin, and in this
form are your Saucidges, or sinkers made, which being done, the letters A are
bound one to another, as strong as possible may be, as ye may perceive by the
letter B in the 2. 17. Plate.

Then ye sink these down to the bottom, that ye may afterward build your
Fortress upon them, according to the former platform, whereof a Plate is made
before, which groundworks among the Ingeniers of the united Provinces are much
used, because these parts are maritimate, moorish, and subject to bad
foundations, so that in some places the foundations cost more then the rest of
the building it self, yea in diverse places of these Countries, the Inhabitants
are driven to keep their grounds from the violence of the Sea and Rivers, by
such and such like means and remedies, to their great and unspeakeable
charges, for one would have thought it had been impossible for them so many
years to do it, since the times that these Provinces were united, had not the
superintendants, and Dikegraues used great care and diligence in continuing the
same preservation for the good of the inhabitants, and common weal, whereof
we will speak more at large hereafter.

When the work is raised above the water, and that the Earth in the moate
diminishes, the Worck-master shall then beginn to lay his edge, or border upon
the line drawn out for the Rampart. Now the line being drawn out upon the
ground, as ye see in the line C. by the 2. of the 17. Plate, being five or six
inches broad, and as deep, which is done by the Ingenier himself to take away
all excuse from the Work-masters, that he may likewise carry a right line,
as well on the inside as on the outside of the Rampart, as also for the moate,
and the other parts of the said Fortress, represented in the plat-forme:
Besides if the condition of the undertaker contains, that the outside of the
Rampart must be raised with sodds, which are ordinarily 4 or 5 inches square,
and 14 or 15 inches long diminishing toward the inside, as ye may see here by
the figure D, to the end that between the said rows of sodds, one may lay a
little earth to settle them the better together to the body of the Rampart.
Moreover, they are so laid together that the rows above must lie even in the
midst of the jointure of the rows beneath, making them settle together
according as the condition bears, and as the articles are which the undertaker
has signed unto. Now for his better ease, he must make use of a triangular
Instrument, such a one as the letter F demonstrats, being (...) ^^de A, B,
about 2, or 3 foot more or less, according to the quality of the work, and
the rest so consequently: For as ye desire to have the Talud, either great or
little, so ye must enlarge the line A, G, or lessen it: If it be needful to
lay bundles of brush to strengthen your works of the Fortress, ye must lay
them so that the ends touch the former sodds, to wit the one row half a foot
above the other, and between each of them half a foot of Earth, continuing
the work so until it be finished: upon the top of the Earth of the Rampart,
ye shall raise the parapet with such a Talud and breadth, as the conditions
imports, in the same manner as before, raising it with sodds, as we have said.
If ye make your Fortress in a fatt and a clayie soil, then ye may (in stead
of sodds) make a cruste of 3, or 4 foot, or more, stamping it well with a
stamper made to that end, and of such an inclination as your agreement bears,
in which crust ye may set a certain kind of grass, called in Flemish
Queeckcruyt, in Latin Gramen, and in English Meddovv grass, which root is of
such a nature, that it will spread itfelfe over the whole Rampart, and bind
the Earth fast together: so that it will make the said crust of a long durance,
and almost perpetual: on the outside of the said brust, ye may sow Oats or
Hay-seed: they use also to set upon the Bulwark, roots of
seuen-leaued-grasse, which is likewise very good: but the leaves do not spread
themselves over the exterior superficies, or this crust, as the abouesaid
grass does: for this reason some years since his Excellency has found it
good, to repair all the Fortifications of such a crust without sodds; because
experience has taught us, that the said sodds binds not the rest of the
Earth, so well as the said crust does, which being moist by that means joyneth
so much the better the rest of the wall or Rampart together, which is of very
great use, and is quickly done.

The talud of the Rampart is made somewhat greater, that one may stand an end
the better upon it, as ye may see by the profiles here before, as well of
Ramparts as Falsebrayes. This being done, ye must make the parapet of the
covert-way of earth dug out of the moate, whereof good store was laid on the
outside of the moate, to that purpose: and the said undertaker ought to that
end make an exact calculation of the quantity of Earth, which is necessary for
that use. But seeing oftentimes the undertakers are not skillfull in casting up
such accounts: It were good that the Ingenier himself should make an exact
calculation, not only of this part, but also of the whole work, which may be
done in that manner, as we have shown in our Geometry, or else in this easy
manner following.

The second 17. Plate, and Letters G, H, R.
LEt the 12 part of the Fortress be Dodecangular G, and AB the face 24 rod;
the flank AD 12, and the curtain 36. and for the Rampart H. Let the talud
interior be 15 foot, and the height as much, the talud exterior 10 foot, the
breadth upon the Rampart 50 foot, which makes that the superficies of the
Profile of the said Rampart will be 933 1/3. Moreover, for the Profile of the
parapet, which is K 99 1/4. the height EC 6 foot, HF, 4. AB for the footbanke
a foot and a half; AC 3. BD 2. CG 20. HG 2 1/2. the solidity of the Rampart
and the parapet is required.

Of the Rampart.
THe Icnographie shows, that CM 10 foot is the talud exterior, and HN 15
foot the interior, the angle B is right in the Dodecagone, and in the
Polygones upon it, ye must remember once for all, that if the Profile on all
sides hold one and the same dimensions, to wit in the faces, flanks, and (...)
the angles BAD shall be cut by halues from the lines HB, EA, KD. Also the angle
of the Polygone being 150, and the flanked right; the angle flanking interior
will be 30 degrees, as it is marked, and the shoulder 120 degrees, which makes
that the triangles right-angles are as follows: those which have their angles
pointed of 45 degrees, shall be Isosceles, or like angles, BM, MC upon the basis
each of them 10 foot, the lines C 3. 3 G, each 50 foot, BX and XH, each 75
foot, GN, NH 15 foot, and the like in the triangles having their Hypotenouses
at KD. Moreover in the triangle ORA, in the shoulder TO 10, OA 5, 7735, the
line marked 5 A, 43, 30125, therefore taking the lines BX, and 5 A from BA 24
rod, or 288 foot, there will remain HF 169, 69875. Likewise AD 144 foot, PD,
or RV, will be 138, 2265, and by adding to it FV. FR will come to 148, 2265, the
line A 12 is equal to A 5. taken from AD, there will remain 100, 69857 for T
8, to which add 8 I, 60, TI will come to 160, 69875, and LI, 169, 359, add to
the said TI, IZ, 15, ye shall have EK 175, 69875.

The demy-curtaine 13 D, makes 216, then 9 F, 226, also 11 K 291, and 10 I,
276: so that if ye add CR 272, 2265, RF 148, 2265, and F 9. which is 226, ye
shall have 646, 453 for CFR 9. the circuit exterior.

Ye shall find also GL 193, 359, and LI, 169, 35904: and 10 I, 276. whereof
the sum for GLI 10, will be 638, 718 the circuit interior, which being added
to the exterior abouenamed, will amount to 1285, 171, its half is 642, 5855,
which multiplied by G3, the distance of the parallells 50, will come to 32129,
275 for the superficies, between the abouesaid circuits, and then multiply by
15 the heights, ye shall have the solidity of the wall, without the taluds
481939, 125. CRF 9. 10. ILGC, which had been too short as here follows.

The Author having made this above with so many lines, if from the midst of
LR, he had drawn a perpendicular line upon the face, and cut af from it 20,
2071 its double subtracted from the sum of the abouesaid perpendicular, and
from BA, AD, D 13, which is 683, the remainder will be 642, 5856, which
multiplied by 15, it will be the same as above.

Of the Taluds or slooping vvalls or Ramparts.
THe Taluds without the Pyramids, which are in the angles, shall be calculated
thus, their Profile is a triangle, which multiplied by the length, or else as
Demy-parallelipedes, the Basis multiplied by the height, afterward the half
taken, add to it then CR 272, 2265, RV 138, 2265, with D 13, which is 216, the
sum 626, 453 multiplied by MC, 10, the superficial basis will be 6264, 53;
likewise HE 169, 69875, EY 160, 69875 and I 10, which is 276, making together
606, 3975, which being multiplied by IY 15, will make 9095, 9625 for the other
superficial basis, together with the former will make 15360, 4925 (because
they are of a like height) by which height of 15 being multiplied, then the
half will come to 115203, 69375 for the taluds, as well interior, as exterior
besides the Pyramides.

Of Pyramids, and double Pyramids of the Taluds.
THere are 3 Pyramides in the angles convexe B, A, K, and three double Pyramids
in the angles concave, H, E, D, which I say because Marolois making no
distinction of them, takes two things for one: As for exemple, the body upon
VFXD is 1000 foot cubicall, and he (...) but 500, and so of the two others.

The Superficies of the triangle BMC, is 50 from ROAP, is the right-angle TO,
OA 57, 735, and YIZK 225, and then the double superficies of GNH 225 (according
to that as we have said before touching the Authors fault) ESLT its double
Superficies is 259, 8057, and the double superficies VFXC, of 200, whereof the
sum is 1071, 5425, which multiplied by the tierce of the common heights, ye
shall have for the abouesaid fix bodies 5087, 7125, (whereas Marolois has but
3375, 69375) to which if ye add, as well the Taluds 115203, 69375, as the
Rampart 481934, 125, the sum will be 602230, 5312, for the soliditie of the
Rampart, besides the parapet.

Those which will not take the pains to have it done so exactly, but are
contented to come somewhat near unto it, shall add unto it BAD 13, which is
648, with HEK 11, being 636, 396, and the half of the sum multiplied by the
profile of the Rampart 937 1/2 ye shall have 602060, which comes the nearest
unto 602230, found out above (being only 170 too little) for Marolois found out
but 600518, with much ado, having 1712 too little.

Of a Parapet.
WE have before set down the dimensions of a Parapet as ye may see by the
letter K, newly cut, with its Rampart H, in this plate, and ye must not think
it strange, that the Parapet is made upon a greater measure, then that of the
Rampart, the reason is, because there are noe more dissections, or cutting of,
and that we have not room to make that which we would within the some Plate.

Now if ye desire to calculate the Profile as the Author has done, the whole
as the brevitie of the Rampart shows above mentioned, its situation is
termined on the outside by CRF 9. and on the inside by a parallel line,
between the abouesaid and GLI 10, distant from the other 20 foot, and for the
avoiding of the confusion which the plurality of lines might cause, we will
take for the said parallel, the line GLI 10, and therefore 3 G, or 7 S, will
make 20, or else the line LT; ye shall find by the triangles, that TR will be 5,
369. add hereunto C 3, which is 20, and the sum of CR known above, taken
from 272, 2265, there will remain for GL 246, 8675, then from RF 148, 2265,
substracting the length equal to TR, 5, 359, there will remain 142, 8675,
afterward add thereunto 8 V, or its equal 20, ye shall have 162, 8675 for LI;
also F 9, being 226, then I 10 will be 246; then the sum of CRF 9, (added to
GLI 10) and the half taken, ye shall have for the middle length of the
parapett 651, 094.

For the superficies of the Profile of the Parapet K, the triangle EIF 17 1/2:
and DO 2 1/4, the trapeze, (or unequally side) IFGC 75; and BOCA 4 1/2, the
sum is 99 1/4, for the Superficies of the Profile, which multiplied by the
middle length above said, ye shall have 64621, 0795 for the solidity of the
parapet, which is much too much; for it ought to be as I have calculated it
with its dissections 63976, 9475, to which add 602230, 5312 from the Rampart ye
shall have 666207, 478, for the whole solidity of the Rampart and Parapet,
whereof the double 1332414, 956, will be the twelfth part of the Circuit, which
multiply by 12, ye shall have the total sum 15988979, 472, and divided by
144, ye shall have 111034, 68 plyntides, or as Marolois calls them Chevilles,
peggs or pynnes, for the whole circuit of the Dodecagone.

Seeing then there are 9252, 88 pinnes in the 12 part of this Fortress
Dodecagonall, the Ingenier may conjecture, for how much he may let out the same
work, which is about 16, 20, 25 or 30 pinnes, according to the situation of
the place, the ground and other considerations, and after that the undertakers
shall offer to make it according to the calculation, made thereof, they may
take on the said work upon condition, that they shall finish it in such a
time, and with so many men as is specified in the contract, and so at that
instant they beginn the work, and finish it according to their bargains and
conditions, as the greatness of the work requires, and the time limited, for
which also the undertaker is bound to have as many work men upon it, as shall
be found needful for the finishing of the said work: and for the better
assurance thereof, it is requisite to know how many pinnes a man may spit, and
lay upon a wheele-barrow in a day: for those that are skilled therein, say that
a man if he works his best, he may dig and lay up 4 1/2 pinnes in a day, but
ordinarily men suppose that one can do three pinnes every day, without taking
too much pains, according to which, one may easily make his calculation how
many spadmen he must use to make up that work in such a time prefixed, for men
which shall do nothing else, but spit and digg up the Earth and the others to
carry it away upon wheele-barrowes to the Rampart, for ye must have as many
men to carry up the Earth in the wheel-barrowes, as that the spiters may be
continually kept in work without any cessation or stay, to the intent the
Work-master may finish his work within the time limited.

Note.
WE say here, that a man may in case of necessity spit in a day 4 1/2 pinnes,
and commonly three in a day with leisure, but it is to be understood, this must
be in a good and fast ground, which will be bear spiting without falling or
breaking; but when the Earth is lean and sandy, it will be impossible for a man
to do so much, and so by consequence one cannot know any certain rule.

The 1. Maxim.
ACcording to which plotts and calculations all other places as well regular as
irregular may be fortified, and hold this for a maxim, that the place so
fortified, as we have taught above, will be better then the others.

The 2. Maxim.
THat the line of defense which comes from the angle of the flank to the angle
of the Bulwark, called the line of deffence fichant ought not to be much
longer then 60 rod, because it is as far as a Musket can well carry, but if
ye will defend the face with Canon, then it may be a 100, or 120 foot long.

The 3. Maxim.
THat lesser the angle of the tenaille is, it is so much the better, because
the faces look more directly one upon another, therefore ye may see that in
the plots of the Dodecagone above said: ye must make the angle of the Bulwark
only of 90 degrees, that the angle of the tenaille may be shutt the closser.

The 4. Maxim.
BY how much the flank and the gorge are greater and spacious, by so much they
are the fitter for defense.

The 5. Maxim.
THe further the defense is made in the curtain, it is the better, because ye
may bring the more men to give fire upon it, for the defense of the faces.
Therefore in the plots of the Dodecagone abouesaid, ye must see that the angle
of the Bulwark be made of 90 degrees, to the end ye may give fire the larger.

The 6. Maxim.
That the angle flanked ought to be noe less then 60, and not above 90 degrees.

The 7. Maxim.
THat the angle of the Polygone, which ye intend to fortify, ought not to be
less then 90 degrees, but the greater it is, it will be so much the better.

The 8. Maxim.
THat in all Fortresses we will make the face to be 24 rod, and the curtain
36, according to which the lines of the Polygones exterior will make about 60
rod, and the lines of the Polygones interior 60 rod. In a Heptagone and the
Polygones underneath, the Polygones exterior will be more then 80 rod, and above
less then 80. The Polygones interior which are beneath the said Heptagone,
are less then 60 rod, and above more then 60, the one increasing, the other
decreasing, until that the angles of the Polygones come to be 180 degrees, and
then ye have the Polygones exterior, and interior equal, and each of them 70
rod, the line of defense fichant in the whole about 60 rod, and the angle
forming the flank of 40 degrees.

The 9 Maxim.
THat the angle flanking interior ought to be noe less then 15 degrees, but
the greater the better they are.

The 10. Maxim.
THat the angle of the flank be always right, the angle of the shoulder must
be at the least 105 degrees, and the greater the better.

The 11. Maxim.
IF it be needful to fortify any Polygone, either regular or irregular,
whereof the sides are less then is here spoken of, then ye must proportion out
the gorges, flanks and faces, according to the form of the angle, as ye shall
se in a table following.

Herewith we will put an end to our first part of Fortification, and will come
now to the fortifying of places irregular.

THE SECOND PART, TREATING OF THE FORTIFICATION OF PLACES IRREGVLAR. BY SAMVELL
MAROLOIS, Revewed, Corrected, and Augmented BY ALBERT GIRARD SAMIELOIS.
THe Fortification irregular being more variable by an infinite deal then the
regular, is therefore more difficult and requires for this cause much more
judgment and discretion, for the effectuating of it well, and in choosing the
best way to make it then the former. Now to discuss thereof methodically
methinks it will not be amiss to beginn with the Fortification of a triangle
equilaterall, that is, of equal sides; which is well contained among the
regular Polygones. And howbeit that their angles fall so little and pointed,
that they cannot be duly fortified as they ought: yet notwithstanding, I think
it best to beginn with them, as being irregular places, fortified noe otherwise
then with a Wall or a small Moate. But if the ground cann afford a good
rampart, and a large moate; then I am of the opinion that sometimes it will be
requisite, yea, and for the most part better, that one fortifies such a place
out of the enclossure, then otherwise, as I hope I shall demonstrate unto you
hereafter.

The 18 Plate and 84. Figure.
LEt then the triangle A, B, C, be Equiangle and Equilaterall, which ye would
fortify without diminishing of the place in anywise, nor yet enlarging it
much. To do this, we will divide the sides of the triangle into 3 equal parts
by the points F and D, and from the distance F, D, shall be made the triangle
Equilaterall D, F, E: the like must be done with the other triangles upon the
two sides A, B, A, C, and so ye shall make a body Hexangular, built as a
tenaille, without which ye may make a moate of a competent breadth and capable
for a place so fortified; and within the inside, ye may cast up a rampart of
some 40, or 50 foot, as necessity shall require, all as appears by this
present figure. But if the^ afterward, ye find that the matter requires, that
the angles exterior may be made, and reduced into Bulwarks, as then ye must
follow our general rule, given for our regular fortification, noted before in
the 10, and 11 Plates, and shall draw the utmost angles, to wit privy lines,
as from G to A, then having resolved to lay out the proportion of the curtain
to the face, as 4 to 3. ye must upon G, H, make 3 equal parts, and four of
the same parts from G toward A, as from G to A. from which point A from the
distance of the 3 parts is made an arch toward I, and from H an other arch of
4 parts toward the same point I. cutting the first at the point I* by which
the line G. I. being drawn cutting H, A. at R. we have AR. for the face, and
by this means the said face will be in like proportion to the curtain as 3 is
to 4: Now for to know the flank, the Capital line and the line of the gorge
ye shall make an angle of 40 degrees through the line S. M. passing by the
point R, and cutting the line diagonall that is, which extends it self from
one corner to the other) at S. and so AS will be the Capital line, S, T the
gorge, T, R the flank of the Bulwark, and T, V, the curtain, which has the
like proportion to A. R, as 4 to 3. And though this plote be not so well
proportioned as is to be desired: nevertheless the defense thereof will fall
out well, being drawn from the midst of the curtain; but because of the
smallness of the angles flanked, which are but 60 degrees, the gorge is very
narrow, and the flank little enoug: so that the said bulwark will bear noe
cutting off; neither can contain men sufficient to endure an assault: so that
this manner of fortification, has many imperfections, and ought not to be
built in such a sort, when there is a commodious place to make it otherwise:
yea it would be better to alter somewhat the angles by making them more blunt,
and open, as in drawing the line Q. P. in such wise, that the angle R. Q. P be
22 1/2 degrees, and the face Q. R. comes not without the fortress; then draw
the line P, R which gives the length of the face Q. R, according to the method
abouesaid, and the angle being made 40 degrees, you shall have the capital
line Q, S, and R, T the flank S, T the Gorge, and T V, the curtain, which
proportion is better then the former; because the angle flanked is more open
then the precedent, the Gorge larger, the flank greater and stronger and of
sufficient strength to resist a furious battery, so that by this means though
the place will bear noe great alterations, yet it is made much better. Whence
appears that by a little change a fortification may be much bettered, without
any great charge and labor, which ought not only to be understood of this
fortification; but also of all others, as we hope shall appear by the rest.

How to fortify a square fortress with a Tenaille.
Figure 85.
FIrst ye must consider, whither it were more fitting, to fortify the angles
of a quadrate, the^ to fortify it with a tenaille, which in my opinion ought
to be done, when as the angles of the square are so far distant, that it is
very needful, to make a bulwark in the midst of the curtain, then in stead
of building upon the angles of the square pointed Bulwarks, as commonly the
quadrate Bulwarks are: I would make the angles BCD, FGH, KLM, and OPQ, in the
midst of the sides of the squares, so that the lines, which form the tenailles
be all alike among themselves; as A B C D E F G H etc, and the angles also
equal one to another, which is done by drawing the two diagonal lines from the
quadrate, to wit, A I, N E, which cuts through each other in the center R. Then
the distance A R being taken; and placed from A to D, from E to B, from E to H,
and from I to F, and finally having made the angles DCB Isoceles etc, from the
distance D E, ye shall have the figure Octoangular formed into a tenaille,
whereof all the angles will be right, which afterward may be made angles of the
Bulwarks, when there is accommodation to make a fort royal thereof, and that
the distance from angle to angle, be about 80 rod; for if the right angles
should come much nearer then 40 or 50 rod, this would cause an imperfection,
and such a fortificatio^ cannot be called a fort royal: so that in such a case
one ought to take advise, and consider well, whither it were not better, to
leave such a fortification in the former estate; then to alter it, because the
circuit of such a place, will not be worth the time, labor and expe^ce, in
regard the Bulwarks will be too little, the lines too short, and too weak to
work their effects: but if so be, the distance of the angles be capable to
bear a perfect fortification the^ ye may make the plott as follows. Let the
line EG, be drawn, and divided into three equal parts at the poincts 1, 2.
Then 2 of those parts shall be placed upon H, G, as here at S. and from the
points S. and I. of the distances I, G, and G, S, shall be made the arches, which
cut through one another at the point 4; by which the line G. 4. being drawn,
where the same cutteth the line H, I, at the point 2, will be I, 2; the face, or
the skirt of the Bulwark. For to have its flank, the angle XVI must be made
of 40 degrees by the line XV, passing through the point 2, and 5, and cutting
the Diagonall G, R, in the point X, which shall be the center of the Bulwark
through which point X a parallel line, being drawn to the line I Gas X X, and
from the point 2, drawing a perpendicular line upon it, as Y 2, ye shall have
all the essential parts of this fortification, namely, the line I 2. shall be
the face, 2 Y the flank: Y X the line of the gorge: YT the curtain; and ZI
the line of defe^se flanking. According to which the angles G, E, C, A, etc.
being placed, ye have the distance I. 2. and upon the distance I, X, one may
make the plot of such a fortification, which was first built into a tenaille,
as appears by the two Bulwarks I and G, and nothing altered in all this
fortification; but the lines of the tenailles 2, H. 5 placed upon ST, TY, and 2
Y, which in all are but a little longer then the abouesaid 2, H, and H, 5. Now
the Earth which is taken from the space T 5, H 2, Y, is sufficient to supply
that deffect. The moate which was made before, if it be broad and deep
enough, ye may leave it as it was without making any alteration in it. And
because that in such places, noe falsebrayes cann be made, but with great
expense; in regard they are made on the outside of the ramparts: and therefore
one must make on the other side of the moate a good covert way, according to
our former plots, that your men may give the better resistance to the
assaillants. Moreover one may (as appears by the figure 87 from 5 to H) make
a good parapet, which shall run down slooping about some 20, or 24 foot
thick, and between H and 5 some traverses, rising one above an other, to lodge
conveniently behind them your musketeers, which may give fire upon the
passage to the moate, yea, ye may make these traverses in such a manner that
they may easily plant two pieces of ordinance upon them, that with them one
may beat upon, and break the Ennemies gallerie, when he shall offer to putt
it into the moate, as also to defend the breach, when the assaulters shall
attempt any thing upon one of the Bulwarks, which may be done not only with
the said pieces: but also by the continual shooting of the musketeers lodged
in the said traverses, which would do great spoil and could hardly be entered,
because the breach, having noe false bray under the bulwark (as there can be
none here) would make it more vnentrable, then if there were one. For the Earth
of the rampart tumbling down into the moate (which is deep, would cause in my
judgment the entrance to be more troublesome, then if there were a false bray;
seeing an Ennemy should be forced with great difficulty, danger, and loss of
time, to damme and fill up the said moate, which is one of the chiefest
observations of an Ennemy besieged, to gain time, and to hinder and forslow
his Ennemies approches, whereunto me thinks one ought most diligently to
endeavor.

If one finds this manner of cutting off, good, which nevertheless I will
leave to the judgment of Captains experienced in the art militaire: it is
manifest, that this fortification with a tenaille will be changed but a very
little, by the addition of Bulwarks, and so of less expense: for the Ramparts
5. H. 2. ought to be made low, to the height required, and diminished to the
thickness of 20 or 24 foot: so that all may be done without any great loss,
and time. But if the moats be so deep, that one cannot from the flank 5 see
the botome of them, being dry, or else cannot discouver the superficies of the
water (if there bea^^y) and that by the hindrance of the said Earth, or
parrapet 5. H, 2. It were in vain to fortify it, seeing reason requires, that
it should be slighted: otherwise I see noe cause, that it ought to be taken
away. For to believe, that the said Earth might give some advantage to the
Besiegers, that being passed over the moate, they might have the better access
to lodge in the said place: the same may be said as well of a false braye,
which nevertheless is approved of the most expert Captains; It is not likely
then, that the said Earth can cause any damage, which might cause this to be
left undone.

To fortify a Quadrilatera irregular in the form of a trapeze.
Figure. 86.
LEt the Trapezoide (A fortress of unequal sides) be A B C D, where of the
sides A D are 69 rod, D C 45, CB 40, BA, 46: and the angle B 108 degrees (and
consequently C. 109: 10. D 71: 52, and A. 70: 50, and that ye would fortify
the same into a quadrangle.

To do this, let there be described two Bulwarks upon the angles B, C, the one
being the angle of the Pentagone, and the other C approaching, all in
proportioning the gorges, flanks, and faces according to the distance BC,
saying by rule of three, if 56, 88 the Polygone interior in the tables, gives
the face 24, what will 40 rod give, the side of the Polygone given B, C? the
like do with the flank, gorge and second flank, according to which
Dimensions afterward the said bulwarks FGHIK, and LMNHE. are described.

And as the distance AD is two great, to describe two Bulwarks upon the angles
A, D, which may defend themselves, because this distance exceeds our rules
given heretofore, and the angles too little: ye shall make or ordain two
Bulwarks, as is seen in this figure, to wit, when as the said distance AD is
great enough, otherwise, ye must make but one Bulwark, as we will show you
hereafter. But in this exemple, the flanks of the abouesaid Bulwarks 1. 2. 3.
4. shall be made perpendicular lines upon AD. and so far lengthned from the
angles AD, that there be means to defend the said flanks 1. 2. 3. 4. so that
indeed the two Bulwarks abouesaid, are but in effect as Demy-Bulwarks; whereof
their angles 1. 3. make 70. degrees, and are defended from one side of the
curtain, as a Pentagone is defended, and from the other sides, are the flanks
of the said Curtains 2. A and 4. D defended: so that the flanks 1. 2. and 3.
4. are also sufficient to defend the two lengths A. 2. and 4. D. and forasmuch
as it is to be doubted, that the nearer one approches to the abouesaid flanks
of the said angles A and D. that they will be in the most danger to be ruined: It
will be good, to draw back these flanks of the said angles, at the least some
400. foot, that they may not be beaten down with Canon; on the otherside, ye
must take heed that the flanks 1. 2. and 3. 4. be not made too great, nor too
far assunder from the said angles A. and D. that the lines of defense coming
out of the curtain be made in the same sort, as the defenses of the Pentagone
are, as is seen upon the curtain B. C. And as the distance A. D. is in this
exemple but 69 rod making there in 2 Bulwarks: it follows necessarily, that
the distances 2 A: 4. D. also the flanks, and the faces of the said Bulwarks be
much more less, then our former plateformes, will bear: in such sort, that
the parts A 2 and 4. D. are but 15 rod, and the flanks 2. 1. and 4 3, only ten
rod; because that otherwise the line of defense cannot come out of the curtain
F. G. as here from the point O, which of necessity must be made to defend the
face K, 3. Afterward the face 3 K. being made 12 rod, the flanks K. G. and V,
F, will be about 7 rod, from the side C. D. ye shall draw a parallel of 10 rod,
and the instrument being opened of 70 degrees, it must be moved so much, that
the line of defense M. T. may come a little out of the curtain E P: the flank
P Q. being made equal to E H. ye have the demi Bulwark P. Q. M N. The like is
to be done upon the side A. B. and so this place will be fortifyed, according to
our intention, and in the same manner, as the figure 86 demonstrateth: and
though the Bulwarks be very small: notwithstanding by this means the angles
A, and D, will be well preserved; and the one will defend the other directly. And
when as the distances C. D. are but 45 rod: one may in some wise from the
flank defend the angle D. But when the flank is noe more then 6 9/10 rod, one
ought rather to make the demi Bulvvarke P. Q. M. N, having the flank N M. 10
rod, which is more capable to defend N. D. then is E. H. yet with this caveat,
that the distance N D be not too little: for then by reason of the thickness of
the parapet, it will be impossible to discouver N D. if the demy-Bulwarke P Q.
M. N. be not made lower then the curtain C. D. and in so doing such an
inconveniency may be prevented: the like is to be understood of the Bulwarks
placed upon the curtain A. D.

An other way.
The 19. Plate, and 88. Figure.
NOw in such a fortification, which has but one simple defense, the angles of
the tenaille may lightly be taken in, because that in the figure 86 N M. and
N. D. are so short: It were better in my opinion, to fortify the said figure
in this form following.

Let there be made upon the longest side the Bulwark 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
proportioned according to the lenght A. 6. the half of A. D, and of the nature
of the Dodecagone, whereof the gullet (which is the distance from the one
flank to the other) makes 27. 71. and the capital line drawn from the angle
thereof through its center perpendicular upon the said line from flank to
flank, called extended, makes 28. 59. as appears by the table here to fore
many times repeated, which is the cause of the obliquitie of the flanks upon
the said curtain, A D, for seeing that the Dodecagone has the angle in the
circumference of 150 degrees, the flanks will fall perpendicularly upon the
sides, and consequently the same flanks will make upon the said curtain A, D,
an angle of the half of the angle of a Dodecagone, which is 150 degrees,
making for every angle of the flank 75 degrees, and as much will the angles A
12, and 45. D make. The rest of the Bulwark in noe wise changes the
proportion. To know then the Capital line 6, 3. you shall say by the rule of
proportion: If the curtain interior and exterior, which are here alike
containing 70 rod, in a right curtain giving 28. 59. rod, for the capital
line extended, what vvil 34 1/2 rod, the length A. 6. give? that which it
will bring forth, to with 14. 9, is the capital line, 6, 3. for the face ye
shall say: if 70 the side of the Polygone interior or exterior in a right
curtain (which are equal) gives for the face 24, what vvil the side of the
Polygone A. 6. 34 1/2 rod, give? ye shall have for the face 11, 83 rod, which
being placed from 3 to 4, and from 3 to 2 (first the angles 6. 3. 4. and 6. 3.
2. being made of 45 degrees, because the whole angle 2. 3. 4 makes 90 degrees
by Hypothesis) ye shall set the transporter upon 15 degrees, and shall make
the lines 1. 2 and 4. 5 of such an inclination, that shall form the flanks,
according to the proportion required, and by the same means shall be known
the gullet 1. 5, which may be found likewise by the former rule of proportion,
in saying: if 70 gives 1385 (the half of 27. 71) what will 34 1/2 rod give
for A. 6? that which this rule will produce shall be for 1. 6. or 6. 5. After
the same manner must ye make up the Bulvvarks, E, F, G, H, I, and S, T, V, W,
X. dessigned in the midst of the sides A, K, and R, P, according to their
length. But before they are laid out, the two sides A B, and C, D, ought to be
lengthened so far, that one may make the angles B, K, L and C, R, P, of 75
degrees, and that the line of defense O. K. termineth in the curtain M. Q. and
to know the length of the faces and flanks, the face shall be made double in the
flank, which is done if ye place upon the perpendicular O N, the half of the
line of Defense O K. as from O to N. and from the point K, the privy right
line N K, being drawn, cutting through the line C, B, at M, ye shall dravv the
line M, L, parallel to N, O, or perpendicular upon C, B, and so the flank L,
M, will be the half of the face L, K. And thus we have finished the
fortification of the abouesaid Quadrilatere irregular, which in my opinion is
a better fortification, then the precedent figure 86. because these Bulvvarks
are more capable to defend the angles A, D, K, R, and the flanks of the said
Bulvvarks being drawn obliquely, as they are here, cannot be made into right
angles: in such sort, that they are the better able to resist against the
force, which may be used against them, and yet make a good defense, as the
figure 88 plainly demonstrates.

An other way to make the fortification of such a place regular.
The 19. Plate and 89. Figure.
FIrst of all we vvil describe the quadrate E F. G H. after such a manner that
the line E F is parallel to A. D. and of the greatness of the poligone
exterior; in the follovving table of lengths: dravving the parallel E, F, so,
that its distance A, D, be equal to the distance of the Polygons, as well
interior as exterior, to the intent, that the side of the Quadrilatere A, D,
may serve for the curtain. Then the angles I, F, E, and I, E, F, being made 15
degrees (because the angle interior flanking is of 15 degrees in the square)
ye shall take upon a scale 5. equal parts and place them upon the line F, E,
and four of the same parts upon the line F, I. from the extremity (or utmost
end) whereof and with the said distances ye shall make two arches, that shall
cut through one an other at X, drawing from thence a line to F, cutting
through the line, I E, at G. then E, G, will be the face of the Bulwark, which
will have the like proportion to the curtain, as 4 to 5. But we will here
after in all the kinds of Polygones, ordain the curtain to the face in
proportion as 3 to 2. that is sesquilatera, finding it best, as we have said
before. Afterward, to have your flanks ye must make two perpendicular lines G
N. and H K, upon the side A. D. in such manner, that the lines G N and H K,
shall be the flanks, and N K the curtain, which is part of the side A D. The
like ye shall do with the three other sides, and so by this means this
fortification will be made regular, and royal, which will not cost much more,
then the former irregular fortification abouesaid, the benefit whereof
surpasses the others by far: so that in such like accidents, I am of the
opinion, that such places ought to be made regular, in case that time, and the
situation will permit it: As for the moates, ramparts, and parapets, they must
be made as we have taught in the places of regular fortifications.

The fortification of a Pentagone irregular.
The 19. Plate and 90. 91 Figures.
LEt the Pentagone irregular be A, B, C, D, E, which one would have fortified
in such sort, that the Bulwarks come again to the angles of the propounded
figure; To do this, ye shall first measure the outsides, and the angles, which
I supposeye shall find to be as they stand here underneath.

rod
A B 57. B C 50. C D 46. D E 56:
degrees
A 72. B 135. C 111. D 97. E 125. 540.
And seeing the angle A, is lesser then 90 degrees, reason requires that the
said angle be not fortified; because it would make an angle flanked, lesser
then 60 degrees, and flanking greater then 150 degrees, against our former
maxims, according to which ye shall make of the same angle A. an angle of the
bulwark, making the angle of the Polygone F. so that the right lines FG, and
FI, come to cut through the lines lengthned BC, DE, in the points G and I.
Upon the angles whereof, and according to the proportion of the sides shall be
described the Bulwarks, taking heed, that the angle of the Polygone show what
form of a Bulwark one must built upon, to wit, a Quadrate, a Pentagonall or
an exagonall, proportioning out the parts of such a Bulwark, according to the
least side of the two, and then the figure will be described, according to this
present form: And seeing the side DE (because it has been lengthned) is longer,
then the proportion can bear of our regular figurs precedent: It will be
necessary, that between the two Bulwarks D and E, a Ravelin be made, which is
a loose piece, that may be defended at leastvvise from the flanks of the
abouesaid two Bulvvarks: according to which flank, the angle of the Raveline
shall be made a little more open, or closser as the curtain is either long, or
short. The faces whereof shall be made of 18 or 20 rod, some times a little
lesser, as the place and situation of the ground requires. And to give you to
understand more clearly my intention touching the fortification of places
irregular, whereof the angles are noe less then 90 degrees, which is the
angle of a Quadrate, and that the sides do not differ much from those places
which are regular: It must be proportioned thus: Suppose that one gives me
the angle C to be fortified, of which the magnitude is III degrees, which
comes near the angle of a Pentagone, according to which I take the shortest
line of the two BC; and C, D, making therevvith the angle B, C, D, which is
C. D. containing 46 rod, we will seek out then in the table of the lengths of
our regular fortifications, the dimensions of a Pentagone, and will say by the
rule of proportion, if a Polygone 56, 88 giu^^ the face 24, what will then a
Polygone of 46 rod give? ye shall have for the face 19. 41 rod. The like ye
shall have for the flank, and then the Gorge, where by ye shall find the said
Bulvvarke C. as also all the other parts of this fortress Pentagonall: holding
this for an infallible rule, that the angles of the Polygone, which you would
fortify ought to be at the least right, and in case there be any angle that
has a less opening, then the right, ye must make thereof the angle of a
Bulwark or else dravve a line (if you cannot lessen the place) which will
form an angle compete^t to build a Bulwark upon, as appears by the 90
figure in the angle A. Which line you must so husband, that if it be possible
it may be made equal to that, which shall come to cut through it, that so
ye may have a new angle, whereupon ye may make likewise an other
Bulvvarke, even as the said figure F, G, C, D, I, demonstrateth, and if the
lines exceed by much the length of the Polygones interior, then ye shall take
them for sides of the Polygones exterior, in tracing out the said fortresses
within them, and that according to the kind of every angle F, G, C, D, I, and
in so doing your Pentagone will be fortified.

An other way.
The 19 Plate and 91 Figure.
LEt the Pentagone be A, B, C, D, E, which you desire to fortify after an
other manner then above: for the effecting of this, ye shall prepare the angles
of the Bulvvarks, according to the scale of the figure, that you would have
fortified, such as before ye have traced out, all separated one from an other,
as they are marked out in the 21 Plate by the numbres 97, 98, 99, 100, 101,
which angles shall be placed upon the angles often figure to be fortified,
observing well by what means the said place may be best made up and with the
least expenses, according to our former Maxims, and to that end, if it be so
that the place be girt about with a wall or a rampart, and that ye would make
as much use of it, as possible might be for the saving of charges the which
(though ye help your self with the old fortification) is always great enough,
at the least ye must labor, that the sides of the Pentagone be accommodated
between the two Bulwarks, to serve as a curtain, as we have done in the
figure 91. where we have placed in the angle A (which is less then 90
degrees) the angle of a Pentagone, or else the Bulwark of a Pentagone, that
may be removed so long till ye shall find the buy sinesse, and the
disposition of the place required drawing from the center of the said Bulwark
F, two lines, as F, G, and F, I, serving for curtains, and meeting with the
other two sides of the Pentagone lengthned in the points G, and I. Upon which
angles G, C, D, I, ye shall form after our former rule (to wit, according to
the angles and the sides) the Bulwarks upon them, and if ye find, that the
sides are somewhat longer, then our precedent rules approve of, in the midst
thereof we will cast up a good Raveline as we have done here between the two
Bulwarks D and H, and take this for a general rule, that your Bulwarks ought
not to be any further assunder then some 60 rod, or thereabouts, to wit, that
the line of defense fichant, be of this length or near upon it. If it be so,
it would not be needful otherwise to make a Raveling, but when as the said
line exceeds by much the said measure, then is it wholly necessary, that the
said Raveline be placed in the midst, between the two Bulwarks abouesaid, to
supply thereby the defect of the said line, and the better to blind the flanks
which by that great distance would lie very open.

An other way.
The 20. Plate and 92. Figure.
IF the place permits to alter the angles a little, then the fortification will be
the better, as is seen in the Pentagone A, B, C, D, E, which is the same with
the former, where the angles of the Bulwarks are changed, and some faces of
them unequal, and so by this means the Bulwarks will not be too far distant
one from an other, as this present figure 92 demonstrateth. But in such a case
ye are constrained that the curtains comes or runns a little out of the sides
of the Pentagone, and sometimes cuts through them, as the same figure shows,
and seeing it were hard to trace out this figure so without some direction, ye
shall make use (as we have said before in the 19 Plate) of Bulwarks cut out
in pastboord, marked in the 21 Plate, according to the space of the angle,
which ye would fortify as we have done here; for the angle A being 72
degrees, ye shall make use thereof, then coming to B, and finding it to be the
angle of an Exagone; I take the Bulvvarke of the Exagone, and place it at B,
turning and removing it so long, till the line of the tenaille comes to cut
through the line AB, as here at O. making A, O, and O, F, equal, that the
defense may be made thereby alike: for I am of the opinion, that the two
faces, flanks, and lines of defense ought to be equal among themselves,
because they must necessarily defend each other alike: seeing the defense cannot
be unequal without diminishing the force of the one or of the other,
whereunto ye must take special heed, as much as possibly may be, to hinder
such an irregularitie, that the one receive noe prejudice by the other, and so
the faces F, H, and AL. will be equal, but FH, will be unequal with FG. the
second face of the bulwark H, F, G, and yet so, that the said inequality
causes noe great hindrance to its form, and force. For first the face H, F,
cannot be made noe longer; in regard of the distance A, F, which may not be
much augmented, unless the Curtain M, N, comes much out of the line B, C.
Also the line A, F, cannot be augmented unless consequently the line, or
distance F, C, be not more and more augmented so that always the same
difficulty remains, to wit, that the Bulwarks F, and I. will be of a greater
distance then the Bulwarks F, and A, and thus the distances differing, will
make also differing faces, curtains, and flanks: for according as the space is
great between F, I. so ye must have more men to defend it, then if the place
were lesser. Now seeing this defense cannot be made more commodionsly, then from
the faces of the Bulwarks: It is most certain that the faces ought to be
augmented more then the former: Yet never the less without passing the limits
of the former plots in our regular fortification, which have their faces about
24 rod, some more some less: but if they be much longer, then the lines of
defense will be of such a large extent, that it will be almost impossible to make
any use and profit of them. For which reason I have thought fitting to make
the augmentation of the faces F, G. and K, I, according to the distance F, I,
remaining notwithstanding within the bounds of regular fortification; and
within the compass of the maxims grounded thereupon, written before. And ye
must note besides, that the interior angle flanking F, A, L, or A, F, H, must
never be less then 15 degrees: and observe also, that the more open this angle
is, the more closser the angle of the tenaille will be, and consequently the
better. But ye ought on the other side to take heed, that the angle F, A, L,
being large and open, the line A, F. be not lenghtned to far from the body of
the figure to be fortified: so that herein ye must use discretion requisite in
such a case, and so accommodate the said bulvvarks cut out in pastboord that
the said angles be tolerable, and that on the other side the curtains be not
too far distant from the sides of the Polygone as B. C. and C. D, and as this
figure represents it to your eye.

Yet an other way.
The 20. Plate and 93. Figure.
IF you are desirous that the flanks of the Bulvvarks B, and C, fall upon the
side of the Polygone B, C, so that the part G, H, may serve for a curtain;
you must do as follovveth, the angle B, A, F, is made of 15 degrees, because
that in making it greater, the line FA would run too far from the place
A, B, C, D, E: the^ ye shall make the line parallel, F, G, distant from the
line B, C, as far as the Polygone exterior is distant from the Polygone
interior, in the Pentagone; because that the angle G, ought to be Pentagonall,
and if the line F, G, is shorter, then the Polygone exterior in our table of
lengths; ye shall sinde out a proportionable distance, in saying: If the side
of the Polygone exterior 8125. gives distance to the Polygones 1677 what
distance will FG, give, that which this rule will produce shall be the distance
of the paralells B, C, and F, G, and so consequently the parallel F, G, being
made, from that distance ye have the thing required, and before ye begin
with the Bulvvarks, it is your best way to make the lines GH, HI, and IA, and
as the line B, C. has served for a curtain, the line C, D, may serve for the
most part thereto, seeing that the line GH, is not ordinarily parallel to the
side of the Polygone irregular, C, D, but the side E, D, may be accommodated
as before: so that one part of it will serve for a curtain to the two
Bulwarks; which shall be made in the angles I. and H. so that if the angle D, had
not ben so sharp, and that the line G, H, might have been parallel to E, D, it
is evident, that one could have made use of C, D, for the curtain of the two
Bulvvarks, G and H. Or else if the line F, G, might have been somevvhat
augmented, the curtain would have fallen much nearer to C. D: But seeing in this
exemple it could be noe longer, of necessity the said curtain must fall
within the inside of the figure Pentagonall irregular. Then having drawn
these your lines A, F, G, H, I with all circumspection requisite, to wit,
that the angle flanking interior be at the least 15. degrees: ye shall draw
out upon them the Bulwarks, flanks, and curtains, in such sort, that the faces
and flanks of the Bulwarks, which are upon the one side of the Polygone, be
alike among themselves, as those which are noted in the 92. Figure, and
according to our former rules given in our regular fortifications.

A way how to fortify a right Curtain.
The 20. Plate and 94. Figure.
IF it be needful to fortify a right Curtain, whereof the angles of the
Bulwarks are right, ye must do as follows. Let there be taken 70 rod,
wanting 6 seconds (that is 69. 64. rod) and putt upon the said curtain A, E,
as many times as the said curtain will bear it, as appears here by the
points A, B, C, D, E, from which points shall rise the privy perpendiculars A
F, B G, C H, D I, and F K the Capitals of 28, 97. rod, and on each side of the
said points A, B, C, D, E, shall be placed 16, 97. rod, as from A, to L. and at
M, raising the perpendiculars L, N, and M, O, 12 rod, the flanks 6, 11: then
the lines NF, and FO, being drawn, which will make the faces of the
Bulwarks, ye shall have that which is necessary for the description of such a
Bulwark, whereof the face is 24, rod, the flank 12. the line of defense
fichant 60, 37, and the line of the gorge L, A, 16. 97, rod. The moate may be
made broader, seeing that the angle of the Tenaille Z hinders, that the angle
of the flank T, cannot discover the angle flanked F: but if the expense were
not too much (which happens when one makes the moate very deep) one might to
that end cut the part X, Y, Z, and so this inconveniencie would be remedied.
For I find that such Bulwarks are far better, then those that are made upon
an angle; because the gorge is very large; the flank, the face, and the
curtain of a competent measure, and according to our former rules, to wit, the
line of Defense fichant is 60 rod, or thereabouts, the Curtain 36, the flank
12, the face 24, and the gorge well nigh 17, rod, which is much better, and
larger, then in the Bulwarks, that are made upon some angle. So that such
Bulwarks ought to be preferred before the others, were it not for some other
reason, which makes one change his mind, as for to have more place, or
otherwise. Now touching the distance of Bulwarks, or a Polygone interior
mentioned of 70 rod vvanting 6 seconds, these 6 seconds are of noe great
moment: nevertheless one must observe the dimention as near as possible may
be: Otherwise one might say, that the face being 24, the curtain 36, the flank
12, rod, and the angle flanked right, that then the Capital will be well nigh 29,
the gorge 17, the defense flanking 41. the line of the Poligone interior, or
exterior 70. rod, the formed-flanked is 35 degrees, and 16 minutes.

How to fortify a Hexagone irregular.
The 21. Plate, and 95, 96. Figure.
LEt the figure Hexagonall to be fortified, be A, B, C, D, E, F, whereof the
length of every side makes as many rod, as they are marked out, to wit AB.
70: BC. 132: CD, 114: DE. 80: OF, 124: and FA, 176 rod. To do this, ye must
take notice of the angles thereof, and as their greatness is ye shall order
the angles of the Bulvvarks, according to their forms. And for as much as the
angles A and F, are but 108, and 110 degrees, which are the angles of a
Pentagone, it will be good to make there the angles of demi bulvvarks, to have
the angles more open, and the angle of the Tenaille more closser, and
consequently better. Upon the curtain FA, shall be placed two Bulwarks G and H,
of a competent greatness to the curtains, proportioning out the Capital
lines, the gorge, flanks and faces, according to the greatness of the^, and as
we have said before in saying: If 70, (which is the distance of each angle, or
the center of the Bulvvarks, gives for the Capital line 28, 97. what will the
distances of the centers of the bulvvarks give? that which this rule will
produce will be the Capital line, and in the like manner shall ye find the
line of the gorge, the flank, and the face of the Bulvvarks H, and, G, the
Bulwark I shall be made in the midst of the curtain M, N. or in the midst of
the line E, F, and for as much as the angle E, is of 112. degrees, which comes
near upon the angle of a Pentagone ye shall be upon the foresaid angle E
describe the angle of a Pentagone, and seeing that the line E, D makes 80 rod,
we will make the angles flanking interior of the form of a Pentagone, to
the end, tha the skirts E, L. and D, O. be equal, as we have said before: for
seeing the Ennemies force betvveene E and D is equal, reason requires that the
defense thereof be likewise made equal, that by this means, ye may take away
all occasion from an Ennemie to attempt any further place the most advantageous
for him. Now in regard that the distance D. C. exceeds the measure, which
we have spoken of before, to wit, of 114 rod, it will be necessarry to make the
Raveline K, between the said angles D, and C, to supply the defect of the
defense: the like may be made between C, B, and the angles of the Bulwarks,
and B, the rest shall be made according to their forms and the faces, flanks
and Curtains in that form, as we have said above, even as this figure
Hexagonall 95. demonstrateth.

The 96. Figure.
HErein it is requisite to note, that when one is bound to fortify precisely
the angles of the figure, either interiourly, or exteriourly, ye meet many
times with difficulties: to wit, here are some angles or sides too small, and
others too great; in so much, that this irregularitie may cause many great
defects. Which may greatly be remedied, when ye may have liberty, to change
a little the angles of the figure, even as we have done in this 96. figure, in
such sort, that the angle E, being but 112. degrees, which is the angle of a
Pentagone, makes the angle of the bulwark S, E, T too much pointed, as when ye
would make it on the inside of the angle E. Therefore, see that ye make the
face E, S, upon the side ED, that by this means, ye may have the angle S, E,
T, broader and more open, drawing the line E O so, that it be equal to ED, and
that the angle O, E, D, be 20 degrees, so that the curtain Q. P. comes not too
far into the figure, and that the line of defense ER, may come a part of it
out thereof, if it be possible, as here to R: for the more the said line
comes out of the curtain, it is so much the better, which is, when the angle
O, E, D, is broad and open. But this exemple if this had been observed the
Bulwark L, had been a great distance from the curtain C, D, and would have
made it much longer then it is at this present; Then upon the point O, shall be
made the second face of the Bulwark, W, O, V, and so made that O, W, and O, V,
and ES, are of an equal greatness, and that the line D, X, be drawn in such a
manner, that the angle Y, Z, 5, be capable to receive the Bulwark of an
Exagone, and for the better attayning to such a structure, ye shall make first
upon the line C, B, the flank noted by 4, 5, and the face Z, 5, to the end
that CB may serve for a curtain, and so fitted, that it may almost be equal
to the curtain D. C. Then upon CB, ye shall make the Bulwark I. according to
the greatness of 4, B. answerable to the Bulwarks G. H. and seeing the angles A
and Bare sharp: ye shall make these two Demy-Bulwarks, according to our method
mentioned in the 18 Plate and so ye have finished the thing required.

Note.
AS we have fortified this figure on the inside: so ye may do the like on the
outside in case the ground will afford it, but we suppose here, that it would
be necessaire to make it in such a sort: in regard that the lengths of the
sides require more the interior fortification, then the exterior; whence
appears, that there are many vvayes to fortify places irregular, yea, an
infinite number, yet bounded with these limits, to wit, that the angles of the
Bulwarks ought not to be noe further assunder then 80 rod, at least 60. that
the angles flanked must not be less then 60. degrees. That your line of
defense ought not to exceed much above 60 rod for by how much the Bulwarks
have a second flank, by so much they are the better; and the more spacious and
larger the flanks and gorg^^ (...), the Bulwarks are the better for them,
according to our former Maxims set down in the end of the first part,
according to which an expert and skillfull Ingenier, will be sure as much as
possibly may be, to have all these advantages abouesaid. And for the better
facilitating of what is said above, we have made here the figures 97, 98, 99,
100, 101, which must be cut out upon a pastboord and drawn out upon the same
measure, as the plott of the place requires which is to be fortified, and to
fit them to the places of the figure, with the greater consideration that
possible may be, that he may follow the rules abouesaid as near as may be,
where unto these figures (in my opinion) are of very great use: for he may
turn, and remove them on what side soever he will, and after he has found the
most convenient place then he may join and fasten them together with a little
wax, that afterward he may overcast the advantages, and disadvantages, which
he is to expect.

How to fortify an Irregular place lying upon the side of a river.
The 22. Plate and 102. Figure.
LEt the form irregular, which ye would have* be the plate of Hardervvijck,
noted by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, whereof the extremities (or utmost
ends) are 1 and 6. touching the Dike A, B, and C, D, which ye desire to
fortify. To do this ye must first overweigh, how many bulwarks the circuit,
of the same place will take up, husbanding them so, that ye must make as few as
may be, because they are parts of a fortification, which will cost much, and
yet so, that you must not place them so far assunder, but that the one
bulwark must help to defend the other: for this reason we have made the line
of defense about 60. rod, which is a longer distance then is given when one is
to defend them with the Muskett, or caliver. The others that must be defended
with the Cano^, may be 1000 foot distant one from an other, or there abouts:
because at the least, it will carry so far over, that of^entimes a Canon will
carry much further then to the utmost end of the line of defense; so that they
may hinder the batteries, which are made to beat down the flank of the angle:
from whence the line of defense is drawn, also ye make it so that the distance
of the said angle unto the angle of the Bulwark be not so far as a Canon
bears, but rather shorter: for which reason we have made it 1000, or a 1200
foot at the most. Now experience has taught us, of what little use such a
defense is, seeing a Canon cannot be used with that agility as a musket, and for
some other inconveniences, which happens to ordinance, when they shoot from
above downward. It is in noe wise advisable, to make the Bulwarks so far
from one an other, and it were better to increase the charge, then to let them
be so far assunder. For to pretend that when the said Bulwarks lie so far
distant, one from an other one hinders the spoiling of the Flanks, me thinks
this reason is too weak to take place, seeing the continual defense made with
musketeers hinders much more Besiegers dessignes then that which is made by
Canon shot, because that in the interim, while they are a chargeing and
making ready, the Besiegers may advance much, and at last get into the
moate, the bottom whereof being filled with fagotts and earth cast into it,
makes the way accessible, and being ones got over, they come presently to make
a mine in the bulwark and, to blow it up: but if the Besieged have good store
of ordinance so that they may play continually upon them; then it will
foreslow, and hinder them much. But if these places be so built before, that
store of Canon cannot be planted upon them and that it is uncertain, vvhither
the time, the lord of the town, and other accidents will permit, to furnish
them with so many ordinance, and other necessaries belonging to Bulwarks:
which if they were, yet the charge of the said pieces would at last grow so
excessive, that the benefit which one receive by it, would finally come to
nothing: if the Besiegers should take in that place, considering the loss of
their ordinance, would often times be of a greater value, then the place it
self; so that this need not be observed; but in cases of great necessity,
and where it concerns the conservation, or the ruin of a kingdom, or a
country, and that ye are sure to be assaulted by a mighty ennemy: which must
be beaten off and resisted with an number of ordinance, musketeers, and small
shot, as the Great Sultan, who commonly comes into the field with two or three
hundred thousand men caring not much for the loss of the lives of this men, in
such sort that the space, which is between two Bulwarks, may be easier taken
in, when it is small, then being great, for the more the said Bulwarks are
distant one from an other, the more men ye must have to man the space which is
betwixt them, which would be a disadvantage to the Besiegers: But on the other
side, these Bulwarks ought not to be so far assunder, but that the one may
defend the other, and in such a case I find it fitting that there be made two,
or three Casemates in the flanks, which ye may when as the curtains are so
long, that they may be made there great and wide enough, to have the more
places of defense which cannot be so soon ruinated by a large space, as by a
small.

According then to these considerations, let us come now to the fortification
of such a place irregular, situated (as we have said above) upon the edge of a
river, and observe, that commonly, such places are more long, then broad, or
deep: because the greatest part of the Inhabitants seek to have the
accommodation of the river, and as ordinarily towns are made after a good part
of the house are built, by the water side, whence it appears manifestly, that
such towns are always more long, then large. Which is the reason that the
sides 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 6. are more difficult to be fortified, then the others
parts thereof, seeing the angles 2. and 5 are much less, then the others, as ye
may conceive by this present plott, and when ye will not go far out of the
circuit: It is wholly necessary, that about the angle 5. ye make a bulwark
which being pointed, the angle of the Bulvvark must be so likewise, as
appears by the angles of the Bulwarck D, and I. whereof the faces are about
20 rod, and the flanks 8 rod, accommodating them so, that as much as possibly
may be the face, or the skirt of them, as O, P, or Q, R, looks directly
toward the dike C, D, to the end, that the said face may have the more force
against the said dike CD: the like is to be understood also of the Bulwark A,
or E: the other Bulwarks shall be made as the exigencie of the cause requires,
as is here noted by the Bulwarks B, C, D, and F, G, H, I, whereof in all this
circuit ye find not one Bulwark less then the other; But as on the one side
the charge is somewhat less, so on the other side the Bulwarks are so far
distant one from an other, that the defense, which is made from the one bulwark
to the other, either with musket, or calliver, will be almost in vain: in such
sort, that the discommodity, which one shall reap on the one side, will be much
greater, then the husbanding of it so as to save the fortification of an other
Bulwark: Therefore the best way is to make one Bulwarck more, then to deprive
it of its best defense, which may be made from the flanks, and so we may
say, that the fortification which is accommodated upon the said irregular
place, marked with E, F, G, H, and I. is better, then that which is marked with
the letters A, B, C, D, because that the lines of defense in this are much more
greater: for which one ought to take diligent advise that he gives himself noe
disadvantage, for an Ennemy who will employ all his knowledge and industry
thereto will give him enough to do, so that he needs not give himself any:
in such sort, that this observation is absolutely necessary. The Bulvvarks
then ought to be so large and capable, as that they may lodge within them a
sufficient number of Musketeers, to defend the space, betvveene the two
Bulwarks. For if the said Bulwarks be too far assunder, ye must then defend a
large space with as many men, as you would do a little, which notwithstanding
is against the order of defense; whereby it appears, how requisite it is to
observe therein a good proportion, to the end, that the expense, time, and
labor may be answerable to the benefit and profit which one ought to receive
from it. Moreover the said Bulwark ought to be made so large, that they may
the better resist (with a body of pikes and musketeers lodged in the said
Bulwark) at that time, when as an Ennemie shall give an Assault upon it, and
seeks to take it in, and by that means such Bulwarks may be better cut off,
then those that are small, as we shall discourse more at large hereafter when
we come to treat of cuttingh off: as well in general as in particular and so
reserve this discourse to its due place; to the end, we may speak more
particularly of the fortification of this place irregular, which I rather
choose (to make the Bulwark, I, the stronger) that the side of the Polygone
were drawn toward the point C. for the preventing of the smalnesse of the
angle, 5. which causes the smallness of the angles P and R. for without all
question it is better to draw the said line, then to leave the plate, as it is
at this present, to the intent, the inconveniency abouesaid may be avoided;
but ere ye do this, ye must consider, if the line so drawn, be capable to
defend well the face of the Bulwark Q. R. which then would fall back almost
upon the angle, 5. so that one might thereby gain a Bulwark, and the defense
would be much better then before: for otherwise, it were better that the
Bulwark should remain, as little as it is, then to make it large, and open
without defense. Moreover if the Dike C, D, have any passable way without it
toward the river side, it were dangerous to make the said rampart against it,
and much better to leave the wall 5, 6, as it was, and to make the
fortification according to this draught, then to make it as is abouesaid:
unless ye intend to take away the dike, and in stead thereof make a sufficient
wall to resist the water, as the wall S, T, extending the same from T to D.
But seeing experience has shown, what danger there is to take away an
ancient, solid, and a settled dike, almost grown permanent, to build in the
place thereof a heap of stones or bricks of sufficient strenght to stop the
violence of the water, one ought to consider maturely, vvhither it were not
better to fortify the plain, which is here our question, according to our
former rules, then to hazard the drowning of all the Country, to the
dishonor of the Ingenier, who gave his advise for such a change, to the
damage and hurt of the Inhabitants, as well of the town it self as of the
country, yea, by endangering the subversion of many houses, villages, together
with the ruin of man and beast. Which an Ingenier of a sound judgment ought
well to consider and not lightly give consent to such an alteration, unless it
be in a case of extremity, or else in consideration of a very great advantage,
which one might receive thereby.

If the wall ST be much raised, as it often happens there were the country
lies low, and the rivers flow high, that one cannot well defend from the
curtain the face R. It were good to make the Bulwarck H, Y, Z which is 9. and
10. 11. A, and the Demi V, X, ^, which would lessen somewhat the circuit of the
town; but would hinder much the former inconveniency, and the charge would be
lesser: for as then there would be but four Bulwarcks, which would have the
lines of defense capable, and able to defend the same Bulwarks, and so the
Bulwark O, P, or Q. R, would not come so near the Dike C, D, which being
wholly commanded by the said Dike, the force will be lesser: for the small
distance betvveene Q, and C, or from T, to R, would cause the Besiegers to
make that Bulwark continually ineffectuall, as well by Canon as Muskets, as
by casting in of firevvorks into it, which could not be done, if this bulvvark
stood backwards as here H, Y, and Z do, and yet is near enough to defend well
the face X, ^, as also the moate: even as this form demonstrateth, marked
with the double blind lines, 12, 9, 10, 11, A.

That which we have spoken of the side 5. 6 may be said also of the side 1,
2. But if the defense of the Bulvvarck E, be better then of the Bulvvark F,
reason requires, that it be left so, without altering the said Bulvvark E, by
taking diligent heed, of the advantages, and disadvantages, which the site
of the place may bring to such accidents as may fall out, according to which
ye must order and acco^modate the Bulvvark: for most often the seat is that
part, which ought most of all to be had in consideration, not only in this
figure, but also in all others whatsoever they be, either regular, or
irregular.

Note.
THat in maritimate places, such as are situated by a river side, where the
banks, or d^kes, come to touch, ye must draw them in such a manner that the
skirt S, 6. may be as far distant as possibly may be from the extremity, or
utmost end 6, that the said space S. 6, may help to defend the furthest part
of the said Dike. D, C.

How to fortify a place situated by a river side, where it is necessary to
make also some fortification on the other side of the water opposite to it.
The 23. Plate, and 103. Figure.
LEt the town irregular be A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H, having many other
oblique corns, as well interior as exterior, situated upon the side of a
large river, about some 200, or 300, foot broad and that the side M, N, often
said town (as it is ordinary) is in noe wise fortified; which place you are
desirous to make strong, and capable of resistance. To do this ye must first
dravve the lines FE, DB. so that they fall not into the old moate, but that
there be left space enough to make a rampart thereupon, on the outside whereof
ye shall trace out your Bulvvarks, according to our precedent rules: so that
the lines of defense do not much exceed above 60 rod, which is within a
musket short (as we have often times said) to the end, that the one Bulvvarke
may help to defend the other, as the art of defense requires, without
making many angles, or sides, as much as possibly may be, to save charges:
because it is certain, that the Bulvvarks, which are made upon a right
curtain, are stronger then those that are made upon angles: for seeing (as we
have said at the first) that the figures of many sides are better to be
fortified, then those which have fewer: for as the quantity of the sides
diminish, so also the greatness of their angles diminish, which afterward
cause the greatness of the angles of the tenailles, or Flankers: and the more
the same angle flanking is open, the less is it capable of flanking;
contrarievvise, the more the said angle of the tenaille is pointed, it has
alvvaies been found the better: so that this is without all dispute. According
to which; seeing that the greatness of the angle of the Polygone begets the
smallness of the angle flanking, and that the, more open the angle is the
nearer it comes to a 180. degrees (which make two right angles) it is
manifest then, that Bulvvarks made upon two right angles (making a continued
line) are better, then those which are made upon some angle lesser then the
two right angles are, and hereby we have sufficiently proved the goodness
of those Bulwarks, which are made upon right lines, which is the cause (as I
believe) that a great Mathematician consumed his time wholly in this point, by
maintayning that all fortifications, as well great as small ought to be made in
a square-forme: but seeing that the Bulwarks toward the 4 angles by this means
become less forcible then the others, as the figures A and B, demonstrate in
the 23, Plate: me thinks, this ought to be taken into consideration. Whither it
were not better, to make a Fortress, whereof the Bulwarks and the lines of
defense be of a like force, then to make them as above. For it is impossible,
that one should make a fortress stronger in one place, but ye must diminish
the strength thereof in an other place, to wit, as the common proverb is, one
ought to cut his coat according to his cloth; But when the situation of the
place, and the avenues thereof be such, that one may be assured of the
resistance, which may be made better here then there, reason then requires
that in such a case, one must make such an avenue stronger, by diminishing the
strength of an other, which is not so subject to be attempted as the former is:
For the site of a place sometimes will require this irregularity. But when as
it falls out in a plain field, it is reason that the strength thereof be also
regular, so then in such a case one cannot take any advantage in one place more
then a^ other, without hurting, and weakening of an other, which one ought
maturely to consider, and not yield easily thereunto without good and pregnant
reasons. And seeing these Countries, which lie low, and are subject to
inundations and overflowings, the rivers are commonly bounded in with Banks
and Dikes, for the preventing of such inconveniences and the preservation of
the Inhabitants from an utter subversion. These dikes coming to touch both the
one and the other part of the said towns (as here in the points H, and A.)
which sometimes are separated from the said town by a wall, which goes from
A, to N. and from M, to H, which in the Figure C is called a Doudan made in
the form of an Asses back, narrow in the midst, and bending downwards on both
sides, which is made over a moate (to stop the water, which otherwise
would break into the land) is called by those of these countries a Beer that
is, a Bear; in regard of the strength, which makes it almost inviolable.
Therefore the Basis, or foundation of such a work, is laid first with a grate
of beams of timber, locked one into an other with squared beams bound fast
together; upon which the wall is built: these beams and piles which are
driven in and laid in this groundvvorke are some 8, 10, or 12, foot long:
according to the depth of the river; and about 7, 8, 9, or 10, inches thick,
lying two or three foot distance one from an other, which also ought to be
in length answerable to the depth of the water. Sometimes these Bears are
made wholy of timber, and are lyned with huge thick oaken plancks, betvveene
them closse together, and are much longer then the former; because the upper
ends must stand of much above the water, as ye think the water can rise in
winter, and on both sides of these piles, you shall lay two great beams or
bands of timber, the one at the ends of the piles, and the other in the midst,
betvveene the bottom, and the upper end of them, fastened together with iron
bolts (which are as thick as these piles) and passing through these piles, and
then ye shall line them with good strong oaken boords, in joining them as
closse together as possible may be, that they may keep out the water the
better, and last the longer. Now if ye resolve to make noe such separation, but
to let the banck or dike stand; then it will be good to cut and pare it as
narrow as you can, to keep an Ennemy from coming upon it with many men in
front, or to hinder his approches the better on that side. I am of the opinion
also, that ye ought to make the line C, B. and F, G. about 300, foot long,
that one might give the more fire upon an Ennemy, both at his falling on, and
going off; but when there is noe fortification made on the other side of the
river, it were much better that the dike did not stand against the point A; but
that it were made nearer to the inside of the town, that one might the better
offend the approches made on the outside thereof, to wit, toward the river, as
is shown in the former Figure and 22 Plate: but if the other side of the riner
lying opposite to the town, ought to be fortified, (for the reasons abouesaid)
then it matters not greatly: seeing one may sufficiently offend the Approches
on that side: and because the cutting off would be chargeable, if it be made in
a circular form (me thinks) the best course is to draw the right line, O, P
and the two others O, Y, and P. K: so that O Y, and P. K. may be of the length
of one of the sides of an Octogone, or thereabouts, that the Bulwarks, O and P.
may be well defended from the curtains, and that the Bulwark also on the
other side, may likewise help to defend the curtains: then between O and P.
according to their distance may be made the Bulwarks Q. and R, but seeing the
distances E, F. and B, D. are too long to be defended from the Bulwarks D, and
E. ye must make the two Bulwarks S, T. whereof the faces are 16 rod, the flanks
8 rod, and the faces of the other Bulwarks are each of them 20 rod, or
thereabouts: which distance is capable to lodge men enough in it, to defend it,
and if need requires, to make also therein some special cuttings off, as we
shall declare unto you hereafter.

Note that if the lines D, B, F, and E, be too short to make the Bulwarks upon
them, marked S, and T: it is apparent ye may then lengthen the sides so far,
that the said Bulwarks may (with convenience) be made upon them, then ye must
draw a line parallel to D, E. but if the distance D, B. and E, F. be so, that
the angles B and F may be defended well from the Bulwarks E and D. as then you
need not make the said Bulwarks S. and T: seeing that from the others, namely.
E and D, they may be sufficiently defended. And for as much as I find these
fortifications to be best, which come nearest to the demensions given before in
our regular fortifications, termed Royal, whereof the faces, flanks,
defenses, and gorges (which are the principal parts of a fortification) are
all capable to work well their effects: one ought to have a special care
above all things, to fit the sides of places to be fortified, that they may
be almost of the length of Polygones, which ye shall find in the table of our
demensions, described hereafter, even as we have done here in lengthning the
sides B, D, and F, E. till that X, Z be equal to the lengthened sides B, X.
and F, Z. Upon which, and in the very midst of them, ye shall make three
Bulwarks and upon the angles X, and Z, the two Bulwarks X, and Z, which are the
Bulwarks of an Hexagone, because the angels X, and Z, make each of them 120
degrees, which are (indeed) the angles of an Hexagone as appears by the said
table, in which are taken all the demensions belonging to an Hexagone, as well
the gorges, flanks, as the faces: and from them, ye may draw out your
Bulwarks X and Z, abouesaid, which will be more royal, then the two Bulwarks D,
and E, yea or of the others likewise: so that this fortification will not cost
much more then the former, making the place more spacious, the circuit almost
alike, and the Bulwarks much better: and in my opinion, this form of
fortification ought to be preferred far above the other, considering what
advantages one may get thereby. But if one were tied to the form B, D, E, F,
whereof the two sides B, D. and F, E, are longer then 90 rod, which is a
distance too far for the Bulwarks D, and E. to help to defend the angles F
and B, one should be driven to make the two Bulwarks S. T. lesser then the
former, whereof the faces would make but 16, rod, which notwithstanding will be
capable to defend the abouesaid Angles F, and B.

Note that if the place requires, that ye must lengthen the line O, P. as far
as the riue side I, K. lies, then ye may draw from the furthest end of the
Bulwarks O, and P. right lines to I, and K, and then ye may make two Bulwarks
upon the said lines, one upon the right curtain, by which ye shall make your
fortification the stronger, because the angles of the Bulwarks O, P. will be so
much the larger, and the defense of the other Bulwarks upon the said lines the
better.

How to fortify a place situated by the seaside, and to make thereunto a
commodious Haven.
The 23 and 24. Plates, and the 103. and 104. Figures.
PLaces lying by the seaside, have oftentimes need of a good haven, as well to
harbor such shipping, as may daily come into them, as also to keep them
safe from an Ennemy, and from the violence of storms and tempests: And for
as much as these places must resist the injuries of wind, weather, and the
raging billows of the sea, as is said, they ought to be soundly fortified and
kept: and because Earth alone will not be sufficient to withstand the beating
of the sea upon them in regard of the fragility thereof, which would be washed
away, such places ought to be made with freestone, or at least wise with good
brick, with driving in on the outside of the wall next the seaside many
strong piles, by clasping them together in this manner following:

FIrst some 300. foot, or thereabouts from the wall A, B. (marked figure 104)
ye must drive in a row of piles a foot thick in diameter, and some 8. or 10.
foot long, as the 24, Plate, and the 104, and 105, Figures demonstrate. These
must be pointed with iron, and sharpened well, that they may enter the better
into the ground, and must be driven in with an Engine called in Dutch a Hye,
having a block plated with iron of some 1000, or 1200; pound weight, which
falls down upon the heads of these piles, and is drawn up with a pullie, with
some 40. men, even as one should ring at a Bell, four or five of them guiding
the Hye, that the logg may fall down perpendicular just upon the head of the
pile, that they drive in, and shall drive it in so deep, till the head thereof
be but three, or four foot above the ground.

After ye have driven in the first row, some six or seven foot distance from
it, ye must drive in the second row, whereof the upper ends must be above the
ground, more then the first row by a foot and a half, or at the most two
foot: so that your second row ought to be four foot and a half, or at the
most six foot. Then about six foot nearer the town, ye must drive in a
third row of piles, the heads being a foot or two foot above the second row,
as the site and the necessity of the place shall require, continuing so till
you come to the very wall of the town against which you shall lay bedds made
of Bundles of brush (as the figures 106. and 107. shows) whereupon ye shall
lay heavy stones 3, or 4, cubicall foot thick, to make them lie firm and
fast between the rows, which are also driven in with stakes, or sparrs as the
figure 105, and 106, demonstrate. All these rows must be so ordered by a
masons line, that they may lie even from the one side to the other, and to
keep them closse together, ye must have long sparrs sawne in two, through
which you must boore holes, and drive iron, or wooden pinnes through the said
rows, and clinch them well, and (as is said) remember, that the piles of the
second row are longer then the first, and the third row longer then the
second, and so consequently the rest must be. Then every ninth foot, ye must
lay cross sparrs of the same weight as the first, or thereabouts, which ye
join to every row by driving great iron bolts through the piles and the other
sparrs, which lie cross the other rows, making through them quadrangular
chambers, which you lay bundles of brush into in making them lie fast
together by diving in of stakes and in laying first a bed of brush, and then a
row of flint stones upon it, and your brush must be hedged, and wreathed
together, to make it lie the faster and firmer, that it may not be loosened,
and driven away, with the violence of the water, as ye may see in the 24.
Plate, and the 106. and 107. Figures.

This being done, then ye shall lay the Basis of the wall first by driving in
piles into the Earth and foundation, if it be moorish, as the 108. figure
shows. But if your foundation be good and firm, then ye shall make (as it
were) but a Gridiron of wood upon it, as the figure 109 notes, these sparrs
wherewith you make it, must be some 8, 10, or 12, foot long (according to
the ponderosity of the wall, and as your foundation shall require) and some 10,
or 12, inches thick. Upon this you shall beginn to lay your wall about 10, or
12, foot thick, allowing to every foot of t^lude, two foot of height, laying
within it spurrs of wood from 16, to 20, foot, and four or five foot long,
making them lie level with the wall (as the art of Masonrie teaches) and some
six foot distant one from an other: then by this means, ye shall bind the
vaults one to an other, and the two vaults shall be comprehended by the third, to
make them last the longer, and will be the better able to resist the waves of the
sea, when the wind makes them beat against the wall, filling the vaults,
which are betvveene the spurrs with good Earth, stamped and beaten in well,
that there be noe holes, or hollovvnesse betvveene them: In doing so ye make
your haven as the greatness of the place will bear it, and according to the
number of ships, which you mean to harbor in it. The mouth or entrance into
the haven being some 20, 24, or 30, foot broad, according to the greatness
or smallness of the ships that are to come into it. Ye may make the haven,
either of a round form, ovall, square, or (a paralellogramma) with a right
angle, as the site of the place and the accommodation of the Inhabitants shall
require. On the outside of the mouth, ye shall drive in the breath of 100, or
150. foot rovves of piles, from one end to the other, as abouesaid, which may
serve for the coming in, and going out, to make the entrance of the ships the
more easy, as appears by the 104, figure: in which the parallel lines AB,
CE, OF, FG, GH, HR, are rovves of piles filled and stuffed with bundles of
brush, and stones upon them, as we have noted in the 106. figure, where ye
must observe, that the wall of the figure 106, which ye see on the outside,
is the same as the figure 110 is, which ye see on the inside. The rest of the
town, asvvell that part of it which lies next the sea, as the other side
may be fortified in that form as the plate of Ostend demonstrates, which is
the next follovving, making your fortification so, that the faces of the
Bulvvarks may be about 100 foot or more, to hinder the better the approches,
which an Ennemie may make on that side, seeing those places will be the weakest,
in regard of the banks, and shelues of sand noted Z, which are commonly in such
places: Therefore one is constrained to raise the ramparts higher in such
places, then the order of fortifying well requires, that one may lie the
safer under couvert from an ennemies battery. If the utmost ends A, and B, be
of a rock, ye must cut them off as much as possible may be, both in the
height, and in the breadth, as the commodiousnesse and the site of the place
will afford: if it be sandy it will be safer to deepen the moate even up to
ones neck, in case the country circumjacent vvil permit it, as ye may see
here in the 25. Plate of Ostend and the Figure 112, in which town has bin
practiced and found out as many inventions to make it invincible as in any
town of our age, and noe less inventions tried on the ennemies part to gain
it, which they did at last after three years, three months and odd days
siege, using all manner of industry, in making their the approches,
galleries, mines, and other inventions, which the art of man could invent them.
Neither was there less art used on the defensive part to make them get it by
inches meal as appeared by the general, and particular cuttings off, counter
mines, counter-batteries, and other works which were made in such sort,
that this place was as it were a school, and a studdie of euells, to bring
men to their ends, where nothing was either omitted, or forgotten, but many
strange engines invented, as well to stop the mouths of the channels and havens,
as for the approches toward the town, as this 25. Plate demonstrateth, where
ye shall see the approches made with gabions, or great Bassketts filled with
Earth and woolsacks to stop the water breaches and at other times sand-baggs:
for the reason why they made use rather of these things, then to advance their
works and by approches and sapps (whereof we intend to treat hereafter) was
because the country lay low, and was sometimes overflowne with water, in
regard of the ebbing and flowing of the sea, entering in, and going out between
the mouths A and B.

Of some loose Pieces in regular fortresses.
The 23. Plate and 111. Figure.
MAny men are of the opinion, that in places of great importance to forslow and
hinder an ennemy the more, one ought on the outside of a place regular to make
diverse works separated from the body of it, by that means to give the
Assaillant the more work, that he cannot come to advance his dessigne. And
though I dare not approve much of them; in regard of the great expense which
they will cost, and the number of men necessary to keep and defend them: yet I
will give here some instruction to those, that are desirous to make such works,
Let AB then be the side of a Decagone, upon which ye shall make by the help of
our former table the Bulwarks Q, T, Y, Z, S, R, then ye shall draw the
parallel lines G, I, H, and HP, for the faces of the Bulwarks of the distance
of some 10, or 12, rod, for the breadth of the moate, and for to find the angle
L, M, N, ye shall draw the angle of the shoulder passing through the angle of
the Bulwark R. the line RM, the like ye shall do with the line Q, M, then ye
shall make the faces LM, MN, of 24 rod, from whence ye shall dravv the flanks
LK, and NO, equal to the flanks TY, or SZ, and finally the lines IK, and OP,
answering to the points Q, and R. and for the better keeping of them ye shall
make the Ravelins VWX, whereof the angle W comes noe further from the center
of the fortress then the angle M, dravving from the angle of the flank O, a
line unto the point W, and the face V, W, of the length M N. Ye may make
likewise the flanks 3, 4, and V 6, but then the defenses of the Bulvvarks
will be of noe use, because they blind the faces LM, and MN, on the outside of
these loose works, ye may make a good moate with a couvert way, and a
parapet, as the figure 111 demonstrateth. These works will cost much, and ye
must have a great many men to guard them: so that one ought to be well advised
ere he undertakes the making of them: and to see if the means of the Lord of
the place, his forces, and time will permit it: more over he ought to consider
that the entrances in and commings out of the said loose pieces, are dangerous
and difficult, and therefore hardly to be relieved.

How to make a fortress, where two great rivers are not above 15, or 18, rod
assunder one from an other, or thereabouts.
The 26. Plate and 113. Figure.
THat you may the better understand my intention and meaning I have thought
good to make use of the Plate of S. Andrews Fort made by the Admirant of
Arragon, that year as he withdrew his army from the siege of Bommel, which is
a Fort situated in Bommelsvvard, between these two great rivers called the
Mase, and the VVhale, haueing noe great distance between A and C, then some
80, rod, being the narrovvst place of the whole Island, and consequently strong
by nature and situation, having but two avenues, or passages to come to it, to
wit, one upon the left side from Rossems field, and the other on the right side
from Hervverden situated at the utmost end of Bommelsvvard, opposite against
the Vorne, or Nassaus Fort, which is a fortress, with five Bulwarks, and well
made. Now to ordain the said place, ye must first resolve if ye intend to make
a Covert-Way with a parapet round about the place, and with all suppose that
the circuit interior (though little enough) is able to lodge in it as many men,
as ye mean to leave there in garnison, according to which ye shall first make
the angles of the Tenailles A, B, C, and according to the course of the sides
of both the rivers ye shall make the two angles of the Tenailles A, I, H, and
C, R, D, and finally the other two D, E, F, and F, G, H, etc. which angles,
because the sides of the rivers runs somewhat slanting toward one of the
sides, they cannot be equal, which causes the inequality of the sides of the
Tenailles, and consequently of this fortress Pentagonall: then ye shall make
of the distance of some 6, or 7 rod, parallel lines to the lines A, B, C, R, D,
which will form the breadth of the parapet for the covert way: then on the
inside ye shall make a parallel of some 18 foot for the breadth of the covert
way, the breadth of the moate about some 7 rod, which lines of the moate toward
the interior side, make the angles M, N, O, P, Q, which shall be the angles of
the Bulwarks, the faces, flanks, and curtains whereof often ye shall find
rules given in our former rules of the 10 Plate, and so ye shall have the thing
required. The Heads K, and L, are made to break the course of the water, which
otherwise would spoil the fortification and especially the angles D, and H, of
the parapet of the covert way, which having a good moate of some 12 rod, as
this Plate shows, it will make a great resistance.

Note.
THat this figure for want of taking heed, is turned the wrong way: so that
the angle F ought to be with all that which lies on that side on the left hand;
and the angles A, B, C, with all that is on the left hand toward the right
hand, the cause is, because they cut the Plate as the Figure was marked.

How a General shall come to besiege a Town.
WE have for a time been minded to describe the order, which an Army ought to
keep in marching toward the place, which one intends to besiege, where it is
necessary to treat of military motions, of the order of the march, which
every soldier ought to observe in particular, as also of the Companies,
Regiments, and of the whole Army, but seeing I have noe leisure to do it at
this present, I will reserve that for the next Edition to make this and other
things in some places more complete. And now we will beginn to treat of
quarters, and lodgings of every company, then of every regiment, and finally
of the whole army, as also of their entrenchments, and the things which
depends thereon, that we may afterward come to the approches, sapps, mines,
galleries and interior cuttings off, as follows.

The 27, 28, Plates, and 114, and 115. Figures.
WHen as an Army is come within 3, or 4, miles of the place, where it shall
quarter. The Quartermaster General goes out before with some 50, 80, or 100
horse, that he may the better view the ground and place where the army shall
encampe, before they come thither, which ought (if it be possible) to be near
unto some river side, nor far from a good wood, and where there is good store
of forage, asvvell for horse as straw and wood for hutting and making of
paillasses. The said Quartermaster General then having viewed all the grounds
and chosen the best, shall draw a draught of it, and show it to the General
of the Army, which being done and resolved, he shall then go in all diligence
with all the other particular Quartermasters of the Regiments, to give them
their ground and quarter: which shall be 300 foot deep, and the breadth
according to the number of the Companies and the greatness of the Regiments.
After this the particular Quartermasters shall line and draw out their quarters
to distribute them according to the number and qualities of the companies,
giving to every company, which is about 110 or 120, two rows of Hutts, to
these which are 150, 3, rows, and to 200, four rows, and all running down
in right lines from the front, so that the said rows are all paralels one to
another, each row being 200 foot deep, and 8 broad* The Sutlars Hutts must be
20 foot deep, and 60, foot is allowed for the Captains Hutt, and enbowring,
and the street between the Hutts, and the said lodging are 100 foot, which
with the 200 foot for the soldiers Hutts, makes in all 300 foot, which is
the depth, that a regiment must have, either for Horse, or foot, and other
quarters: and the rows between them, which make the streets and back streets,
shall be likewise and must be 8 foot: which rows in their depth shall be
divided into 25 parts* so that every of them make 8 foot for the depth of the
said Hutts, and the breadth being likewise 8 foot, each hutt will contain 64
foot square, for every two soldiers, that they may the better lie together
and help each other, as well in making up their Hutts as before and afterward.
And for the better accommodation of the Army the Quartermaster General ought
to take care, that the Quarter (as is said) be near unto some river, wood, and
fourrage, and to labor that the said Quarter be provided with all things
necessary, and quartred as near the Town besieged, as possibly may be, to
the end the trenches and approches may be relieved, as soon as may be in
case of necessity: And seeing oftentimes there happenssome mischief among the
Hutts, which join closse together, when as fire takes them, so that one row, a
whole street, yea sometimes the whole Quarter is burnt before any order can
be taken, they shall build them I, ^, or 3, foot assunder one from another, to
the end one may pull them down quickly without endangering the other, and so
by this means may be kept from fyring. From the front of the Hutts, ye shall
Kitspit 10, foot, where ye shall sent up your crutches for your piks and
arms, and beyond them some 16, or 10, foot further is the distance between
the Captains lodging and the arms being 28, 30, or 32, foot deep, and 24,
or 28, broad in the front. But when the streets between the Hutts, and the
Captains lodging are but 20 foot, then the said lodging is to be 40 foot
deep. Beyond the Captains Hutts there is a place of 200, or 250, foot or
thereabouts called the Alarm place to draw in arms, at the end whereof the
line of entrenchment for the Camp runs, to wit, haueing a ditch some 6, 7,
or 8, foot broad, 5, or 6, foot deep, and the parapet of the same breadth
and height, to wit, the basis of 8, foot, and 4, or 5, foot high: but when it
is 6 foot high, then ye must make a foot bank which must be a foot high,
and 2, or 3, foot broad, that ye may the better discouver the fields about
ye. Behind the Regiment are the sutlars Hutts or tents, leaving a street
between them and the soldiers Hutts of 20 foot and the breadth of their hutts
are likewise 20, foot. Between the sutlars and the other Regiments there is a
street, or a separation made between regiment and regiment about 40, 50, yea
100, foot as the ground will afford it, and the greatness of the said
Regiments. And the better to accommodate every Regiment, the Quartermaster
General ought to know the greatness, and the number of the companies of them.
And so, as is said, ye have the depth of a regiment, which is 300, foot, in
which are contained the Captains, and the sutlars lodgings with their streets,
and the distances between them and the soldiers.

The Colonel is lodged in the midst of his regiment leaving a street of 80
foot, as the Figures 114 and 115 demonstrate, to lodge therein his train and
the officers of his Regiment, as the Quartermaster, the Marshall, Chirurgian,
and others. In the midst of the quarter the General of the Army is lodged
some 600 foot, or more from the entrenchment, according to the greatness of
the Camp, and the accommodation of the place, having a front of some 700 foot
more or less, as his train is either great or small, being 300 foot deep
(as all the other quarters are) having in the midst, where they set his
pavillions, an overture of 400 foot broad, for to discouver by sight the place
where they draw up in arms. Behind him the master of the ordinance is
quartered, having his quarter 300 foot deep, and 700 foot in front more or
less according as his train is great. For in case that the carrages and
victuals must be lodged within the compass of the Camp, it is very
necessary the said place be larger, that it may contain them all, and as
then ye may separate the train of victuals from the train of the ordinance.
Upon the right hand are lodged sometimes the other Officers belonging to the
army, leaving between them and the rest, a street of some 40, 50, or 60,
foot, that they may freely pass through it with the ammunition of war, to
the place where they are to be used: and then round about it are the foot
lodged, according to the former order, being as is said) 300 foot deep with
the Captains tents, and the sutlars hutts, and the breadth of the front
according to the greatness of the regiment, every company of 100 men taking
up 32 foot with the streets, which are between the hutts, and before them is
the place of Arms 200, or 250 foot, to draw up by companies into their
divisions and battallions, to wit, every company directly before his Captains
lodging and their to draw up in parado and to receive the commands of the
General of the Army. In the front of the hutts the Lieutenants and Ensigns
are lodged, and the Sergants and Gentlemen of the arms in the reere next the
(...), they may presently prevent any disorders which might fall out. And for
the more easy understanding of what is said above in the 27 Plate, and 114
Figure, we have here represented the quarter of an English Regiment consisting
of 20 Companies, as they were quartered (as I remember) before Gulick whereof
the Plate K, L, M, N, O, P, is the Colonels lodging, Q, R, S, T, his Kitchen
and Stable, H, I, the Captains lodgings 24 foot broad, and 30, or 32, foot
deep. G, the crutches or the forks against which the Pikes and Muskets stand.
CA, the soldiers Hutts, whereof every file contains 25, and 8 foot in depth
and breadth, the goings out are between the two files; but the four utmost
hutts of every company have their goings out toward the streets, CH, and AE,
which is the Sutlars street, E F, are the Sutlars Hutts, which are made either
large or straight, as every ones occasion shall require, leaving a little space
betvveene them, for their more freedom, and for the danger of fyring. The
scale which is hereunto annexed will show you the true measures.

The 28, Plate, and 115. Figure.
THe 28, Plate is the draught of a Colonels lodging, in a larger form, that
one may the better vnderstant the order, which is here to be observed. 9, is
his tent, and his gallerie to go into his tent, 5, 6, is his sleeping tent,
where it may be so ordered, which would not be amiss, that there be a gallery
from 5, to 6, to go in and out prively from one tent to an other, 7, is a hutt
for the Colonels servants: 11 his Kitchen, 10 and 12 are also Hutts, 13 in his
Stable, 14 and 15 are the officers Hutts of the Regiment, and all other
officers, which are not ranged under any Company, are lodged in this street,
behind the Colonel. 2, and 3, are the Captains tents, 16, and 17, the places
where they draw up in arms, 4, 4, 4, 4. are the soldiers Hutts, the side KL,
from the colonels lodging is a right line with the Captains lodgings, not to
hinder the sight of the front of the Hutts. But as for me I think it were
more convenient that the front of the Captains lodgings, were made in a right
line even with the front of the Colonel, to wit, that 2 and 3, and M, and N,
may be in a right line, whereby the alarm place should be of an equal breadth.

The 29. Plate and 121. Figure.
IF necessity requires to quarter the Horse with the foot within the circuit
of one line, which is usually done when one fears an Ennemie to fall on upon
many sides, and that there is noe other accommodation for the horse without the
camp, otherwise it were much better to lodge the Horse out of the foot
quarter, for the avoiding of many inconveniences, which the foot might receive
by them, and which the Horsemen might receive from the foot, leaving between
the Sutlars Hutts of the foot and them, a street of 40, 50, yea sometimes of
100 foot according as the place will afford it, having their front toward the
place of arms, and every regiment quartred together, being commonly 8 troops
in a regiment allowing to every hutt 10 foot in length: between them and
their Horse there is a space, or a street given them of 5, or 6, foot broad,
to lay in their fourrage: then between the same 5 foot, and the great
streets (which are ordinarily 20 foot) is made a space of 10 foot for their
horse, allowing to every horse 4 foot in breadth. The great streets are made as
is said of 20 foot, the narrow of 8, or 12, foot, that they may the better
come one to an other, and to join together in case of necessity, and for other
considerations, in such wise that in one row, which is 200, foot in depth,
there are three such streets of 8 or 12 foot: For otherwise the rows,
because of the great spaces, which such Hutts will take up, makes the entrance
into them uneasy, and thus the lodging of a troop of horse of 70 foot, to
wit, the lodging of the Horsemen 110 foot and 2 small streets 5 foot, the
street between the Horse 20 foot, and twice 10 foot for their horses, which
makes in all 70 foot: and when as the streets between the Horse-heads and the
Hutts shall be six foot, the front will be 72 foot, of which breadth the
Captains lodging is made, leaving between him and his soldiers Hutts a
street of 18 or 20 foot, and the depth 40, or 42, foot, and seeing the depth
of the Horsemens Hutts is 200 foot, as the Hutts of the foot are and 40 the
Captains, with the street of 20 foot, makes 60, foot and 40 for the Sutlars
street, it is manifest then that the quarter for the Horse (as is said) will be
300 foot deep. Then between the companies there is a street of 20 foot,
which if necessity requires may be made narrower. And seeing the Captain which
commands a Regiment of 4 or eight troops, has noe greater train then an
other horse Captain has, he is lodged noe otherwise then they are; neither
takes up any more ground, only the honorablest place is given him, because he
commands for that time: but the army being in garnison, has noe command
over them.

In the front of these Hutts are lodged the Lieutenants and Corners, and next
unto the sutlars street are the Hutts of the Corporals and Quartermaster, that
they may upon any occasion be ready to prevent any disorders that may happen.
Beseides the ordinary Sutlars, which use to follow the Regiments, there are a
great number of other Sutlars and Tradsmen, which follow the Army, as Drapers,
Merchants and others, which are all lodged in a quarter by themselves a part;
to the end that those which have need of any thing, may go presently thither
and buy it. And this is the reason why all of one profession are lodged in a
street, or two rows, leaving a large street between the principal Tradsmen
of some 200 foot or there abouts, which shall serve as a Markett-place, where
all things necessary as well for the sustentation of man as other wares are
daily sold, which are brought thither by the Country men, and others. The
other rows which are of an other profession, have their streets more narrow
as 15, 18, or 20, foot. Those which are of a contrary profession have a
street of some 30, or 40, foot, as the place will afford it, and the quality
of the merchants. The Butchers quarter is ordinarily made in one of the
furthest corners of the Camp, because of the garbages, and panches of the
Beasts they kill, which they are toburie without the quarter in a hole or a
ditch dug for that purpose some 200 foot without the entrenchment, that noe
evil sent or filthy stink may cause the infection of the air. If the Camp
be quartered by a riuer-side (which one must seek to do if it be possible) it
will not only be able to furnish the soldiers with water for their
accommodation, and to preserve them on that side from an ennemie, but also
will be good for the shipping, which may bring the^ all manner of victuals and
commodities as experience has shown in diverse sieges, which if it so falls
out then the market place is made by the river side in the same place where
they should draw in arms being 300 foot broad or there abouts, without having
any Hutts in all this plain, that they may not hinder the entrances in, and
going out of the ships, from whence they fetch all things necessary, as well
for ammunition, as for victuals, and the Merchants, Sutlars, and Mercers and
others following the army are lodged on this side, and separated by streets
some 12, 15, or 18, foot, according to the site and commodiousnesse of the
place, as we have said above.

In the quarter of the Master of the ordinance is (...) lodged the Commissarie
of the Victuals, and his Conductours, as we have said before, and that when as
his magazine is not very great in respect of the place, as also all the other
officers, over which the said master of the ordinance commands, as the
Commissarie of the ordinance, his Conductours, the Master gunner, and
Gentlemen of the ordinance and the ordinary Gunners. The Commissarie of the
Ammunition* with his train, as Carpenters, Smiths, Watermen, Pioniers, Miners,
and others, all of them being lodged by themselves, that one may find their
lodgings the better. The Master of the ordinance has commonly the gentlemen of
the ordinance lodged within his circuit, that they may be ready upon any
occasion to receive his commands, and to execute them as the General of the
Army shall think good, as appears by the Figure 122: In which A is the
place ordained for the master of the ordinance: B, the quarter of the
Inginiers, the Commis and his conductours, C, the quarter of the Carpenters,
belonging to the Army. D, The quarter of the Carpenters which attends upon the
ordinance: E, the quarter of the saylours following the train of the
ordinance. F, G. the Pioniers quarter. I, is the master Gunners haueing 100, or
150. Canoniers under him, and the Provost marshall of ordinance. H, The Miners
quarter. L, the Magazine for the ammunition, and his Commis: E, the Magazine for
the ordinance; with his Commis, M, N, the Magazine for the Victuals, and O, a
place where the wagons stand: but when they fear noe ennemie then this place
is appointed without the Camp some 200, 300, or 400, footewithout the
entrenchme^t. But when there is any doubt, or that the wagons may give any
hindrance being set without, they appoint them ordinarily to stand on that
side by the master of the ordinance his quarter, where also the Wagon master
is lodged, with his lieutenant and their conductours, the better to keep all
things in good order, and that they may presently be employed upon any
occasion, when the waggon-master shall call for them, and for the better
understanding hereof we have made here a draught of it, as appears by the
Figure 122.

Figure 123.
HAving described the particular lodgings, and quarters of every company of a
Regiment as well of foot as of Horse and other officers, it will be requisite
to represent them together in a General quarter. And because exemples are of
great use: I will take first this Figure 123, which was his Excel* quarter
before Gulick in the year 1611, G is then the quarter and tents of the
General: I the quarter of the Master of the; ordinance K the officers of the
Army; L the market place, where all the tradsmen and merchants stand, which
follows the Army, as we have said before. F and H are the French Regiments,
namely F, Monsieur Chastillon his Regiment, H, Monsieur Bethunes. A, the
Regiment of Count Ernest of Nassou: B English companies commanded by Monsieur
Medkercke Lieut. Colonel to General Horatius Vere. Care 8, companies of
Frizes. E, are 6 Germany companies. D the 4 companies of the gards, to which
quarters are added the number, which show the length, and the breadth of every
quarter in particular, also the length of the streets, and the greatness of
the whole quarter in General.

Figure 124. and 125.
ANd because commonly the Captains, after their soldiers are hutted, build
Hutts in the place, where their tents stood, being warmer, and cooler against
the sun, and more durable. I thought it not amiss to represent the form of
them: A, then is the Captains Hutt, B his Kitchen. C, his stable, D. the place
where his fourrage lies. E, is the street between the Captains lodging,
which is 8 foot. the scale noted by the numbers 124 and 125 will show the
depth and breadth of the said lodgings, and the largnesse of the streets.

Figure 126.
THe Figure 126, is a quarter of Horse and foot, whereof A, is the Generals
lodging. I, the lodging of the master of the ordinance. G, L, F, H, are four
Regiments of Horse. B, C, D, E, M, N, O, P, are 8 regiments of foot. K the
Market place for the Sutlars; the Half squares 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. and
10. are the places of defense, to hinder the giving on of an Ennemie, whereof
every face is about 100 foot (as also in the Figure 123. are the exterior
angles 3, and 4) to the intent that one may lodge more men in them to defend
the skirt AB, the Overtures 13, 14, 15, and 16, are the avenues, passages and
entrances into the general quarter: whence it is necessary, that a
Quartermaster General ought to have true notice of the number and quality of
the Regiments and companies, that he may dispose of them according as the
place and the nature of the ground will afford, and for the better effectuating
of what is said before, it would be good, to draw out a draught of the
greatness of every Regiment in paper, and above it to put the colonels names,
to alter and change them according to the accommodation of the place and the
number and greatness of the Regiments, setting them down in two, three or
four rows, or in length if the Entrenchment be by a riverside, lodging the
Nations which cannot agree well together as far assunder as possibly may be
one from an other, to prevent mischiefs, quarrels, and other disorders, which
may happen between them. If he quarters the Horse with the foot, the
General of them, ought to have his quarter in the same front as the General
of the Camp has, or between the troops of Horse, being not far distant
from the said General, and his front, and there must be, if it be possible, an
overture made of 300. or 400, foot, that one may have the perfect sight of
the Generals quarter toward the place of arms, for to draw in and out. The
sutlars and merchants, which follow the Army ought to be quartered behind the
Generals quarter, on that side where the master of the ordinance lies: but the
Butchers shambles, as is said before, in one of the corners of the camp, or if
they be within, to be stricktly commanded to carry out their offald and filth
out of the Camp, or else to digg up great holes to cast them in to them, that
by such noisome smells the air may not be infected.

The 29 Plate, Figures 116, 117, 118, 119, and 120.
AT the end of the said 200, or 250, foot, the entrenchment is kilspitted
made by the soldiers for nothing, every company against his own quarter, if
it so falls out, which entrenchements are (as we have said some 6, 7, or 8,
foot more or less, as necessity requires. For when one fears an Ennemie, it
is needful that the entrenchements be made stronger, and greater, them when
there is no appearance to be attempted: in the midst of these entrenchments
there may be made spurrs, and redoubts on every side of some 4, 5, or 6, rod,
for the better defending of the said trenches: for from them they may bed
scouvered all alonge, and so by night or otherwise they may hinder an
unexpected attempt, being distant one from an other some 40, or 50 rod,
according to the greatness of the skirts of the trenches. The reason why one
makes these square redoubts is, because others cannot be so soon made,
otherwise I should be of the opinion that one ought to make great flanks, and
large skirts, to draw the more men to flancker the^, and not to entrench the
inside (to wit in the entrenchments of the camp) as appears by the
entrenchment A B C, Figure 116, which would make a better defense, if one
should assault the squares D, E, F, G. It is true, that when one has passed
the entrenchment, that the space A and C, being open, would be sooner taken in
then the square: but I leave this to your consideration, if when ye have lost
your trenches, the square redoubts may be kept, in regard of their smallness
and the fewness of men that man's them, to wit, some 25, 30, or 40, men at the
most: now for the better preventing of such a danger, ye may make the lines,
and entrenchments D, F, leaving only a gapp open of some 3, or 4, foot, for
an entrance in and out with a drawbridge, and so this would be as difficult to
be taken in as the whole squares; so that I should rather resolve to make the
entrenchment of a Camp with skirts of demysquares: so much the greater on the
outside (as is said) without making whole squares, or redoubts. For in so
doing the defense would be much better, and the coming to defend it more
commodious and easy. Those which find the other manner better may make use
of it, for my own part I rather approve of these Demy-squares. The
Entrenchments which are made without the enclossure of the Camp, as those
which enclosse a town, or for to cut of the passage of an Ennemie, to hinder
their Victuals and such like things ought to be made with strongh redoubts as
Prince Maurice did at the siege of the Grave, where the Ennemies army lay
closse by his camp, not daring once to attempt the passage: because of the
strongh entrenchment, which he had made by the said square-redoubts, being not
further distant one from an other then some 50, or 60, rod, and about as much
also upon the Entrenchment, which were made (as I have said) in the form of
Bulwarks, and within them were the said squares, which in my opinion are
exceeding good in such entrenchments, which are made without the circuit of the
quarter, especially, upon the Avenues that they may lodge in them some 25, or
30 men to guard them, and to hinder an Ennemies passage, but when one is not
resolved to make the said entrenchments like Bulvvarks, there ought to be made
at the least such square works as the Figures 116, and 117, demonstrate,
because they are wholly enclossed, having but one entrance as narrovv as
possibly may be, being advantageous asvvell without as within. For as long
as the Approches are not much advanced before, and about the town, they may
send men unto them, and occasion many hindrances, if they be not well
entrenched: The Figure 117, will give us clearly to understand, that which
we come to speak off, the square D, E, F, G, being the same of the squares of
the Figure 116, which is an entrenchment running round about the town, which
is besieged, and is as far distant from it at the least as a muskett can
well bear, beginning and ending at the entrenchment of the quarter; DE, is
the outside of the Redoubt containing 4, rod, or 48, foot; the space marked I,
is the talud of the parapet; 2, the superficies thereof; 13, the footbanck; 5,
the ditch eight foot broad, and 6 foot deep, as ye may more plainly
understand by the Figure 118, which is the Profile of the said entrenchment,
whereof the height, and the breadth are noted here, the bottom of the ditch
being 2, foot vvide, and consequently every side of the talud is the half of
the height, or depth, the foot bank in the basis 3 foot, a foot high, and
above 2^ foot. And there ought to be one the outside of the parapet an edge of
some 2, foot, which was forgotten in this Figure 118, but ye may see it
marked in the 120, A, T. And seeing the said squares or Redoubts are chiefly
made upon the Advenues and passages, to hinder thereby the attempts of an
Ennemie, which secks as much as possibly may be to keep a free passage, and
entrance into the town besieged: It is sometime (for ones better assurance)
necessary to use the greatest care and perfection to hinder him; so that those
squares be made like little Bulwarks, as appears by the Figure 119, and then
the sides of these square works are greater then those above, according to the
quality of the passage, their curtains being at the least of those
provisionall Forts some 4, rod, according to which the other parts being
proportioned as the table of our dimensions shows, the faces F, C, and D, E,
3 2/5 rod, the flank C, A, 103, rod, and the line of the gorge 1. 22, rod, the
Rampartas almost all other provisionall works are only made of 6, foot high
at the least, and at the highest 9, or 10 foot, making the basis of 14, or
15, foot, and 3, or 4, foot of height with the ordinary taluds, upon which
is made a parapett of 7, or 8, foot broad, and 5, or 6, foot high, with a
footebanke some 3 foot with the taluds, according to the quality of the
ground, to wit, sometimes but a foot high, and as much Talude, and otherwhiles
but half a foot only, then one supputes how vvide the ditch will be
according to the said Rampart, being eueryvvhere 6 foot deep or thereabouts:
And when one raises the rampart above 6 foot, which is usually made in
provisionall fortresses, whereof the curtain is 5, rod or more; I think it
were not amiss, to make in the ditch a foot bank afect the fashion of a
counterscharfe some; foot, that if need be the musketeers may runn along
it, raising the parapet thereof above the plain field, as much as the said
rampart exceeds 6 foot in height, or somevvhat less, as the draught shows,
which we have made thereof marked with the number 120, where we have raised
the parapet 2 foot higher then the field, as likewise the edge of the ditch,
and cutting the Talud of the ditch toward the same place some 3 foot,
making together 5, foot, with the allowance of a little Talud, as commonly
one gives to parapets, to serve as a parapet to the ditch, and there to be
under covert, and seeing there rests yet three foot, before ye come to the
bottom of the ditch, ye may make a second footbanke, a foot and a half
high, that ye may the better descend from the other to charge and discharg
your muskett, while the other are a giving fire, and for to know the
greatness of the parapets, and how vvide the ditch must be answerable to it,
we will make here this calculation thereof follovving.

Before we come to the supputation of the said profile (Figure 120) we must
set down 6, in the place of a 5, for the line S, R. To mark out 10, for M,
K, and an O omitted at the interfection of F, H, and of a parallel through E,
to B, C.

A B C D.
A D, making 14. foot, BC, 9 1/2, the sum being multiplied by C, G, 3, the
half will be 35 1/4 for the superficies A B C D.

B E F I.
F, H, 5, being multiplied by I, H, 1/^ the half of the product will be 1 1/4
for the triangle F, H, ^, then F, O, I, multiplying the half of O, E, ye shall
have 2, for the triangle F, O, E. Finally, the sum of O, E, 4. and H, B, 6,
multiplied by 2, the half of O, H, ye shall have 20, to which add 3 1/4 for
the two triangles abouesaid, ye shall have 23 1/4 for the superficies of B E F
I.

L M K, and all the rasing.
The half of 1/4 LM, being multiplied by M, K, 10, ye shall have 10, for the
triangle LM, K: to which add A B C D 35 1/4 and B, E, F, I, 23 1/4 there will
come for all the rasing 68 1/2, which ought to be equal to that which is
void, M N O P Q R S T, but to the end we may resolve this by the Trapeze M, T,
S, R, we will substract from the Sum abouesaid the two Triangles M N O, 4
1/2, and O P Q, 1 1/^, which make 5 1/^, and will remain 62 7/^ for the
trapeze M, T, S, R, which divided by the depth which is 6, it will give 10
23/4^ the Talud exterior 6, with the interior 3, makes 9, the half is 4 1/2,
which added to 10 23/48 ye shall have 14 47/48 for T, M, which is very near
15 foot, and likewise 4 1/2 subtracted from 10 48/23 ye shall have 5 47/48
for S, R, (making very near 6) the proof is that the superficies of M N O P
Q R S T, is 68 1/2 equal to the superficies of the whole rasing, the like ye
may do with all provisionall fortifications.

The 33 Plate, and 140. Figure.
ABout the entrenchment of a Camp, there are made some gapps, avenues, and
passages for men, and wagons to go out, and in, which have noe ditches, or
ramparts, some being 6, 7, or 8, foot vvide, as occasion serves, shutt in
with a vvodden gate, or Turnepikes made of sparrs some two inches and a half
thick in diameter, and about five or six foot high, plated with iron heads at
the points, and having two great Iron nails driven through them eight or nine
inches long, and blund headed on the other side of the thickness of an ynch,
half an ynch, or thereabouts; they are pointed to drive them in the better
into the ground in two places, to stopp up the passage, as the 33 Plate, and
the 140 Figure shows, which pikes three or four rows of them, must be
driven in closse one to another as high as a man's girdle, which is about 3
foot, or three foot and a half, the first and utmost row must be driven
into the ground deeper then the other, and so the one above the other row,
that they may not be pulled up. These are of good use also to be driven in
upon the topp of a breach (as Sr. Francis Vere did in Ostend) when an Ennemy
is ready to give an assault, and that one has not time enough, to cast up a
breast of Earth upon it. These and an other Instrument called in Dutch a frize
Ruyter, and by us a turnepike (as also your quadrangular tanternailes cast
down upon a breach) are of singular use, to barrocadoe, and stopp up places*
A Turne-pike is made in this manner follovving:

The 33 Plate and 141 Figure.
TO make a turne-pike, ye must take a round sparre some 12 or 15 foot long,
and about 5, or 6, inches in diameter, and boore holes through it in many
places: so that these holes meet not one with an other, being boored right
one under another, about an ynch in a sexangular form, that the circuit may
be divided into three equal parts, and in every part, ye must boore a hole as
is said one under an other, that the demypikes of six foot length, well
sharpened with iron heads at both ends, about an ynch or an ynch and a half,
may be putt crossvvise fast through the holes of the sparres 3 or 4, inches
one from an other, even as the Figure 141 demonstrateth.

These turne-pikes are of a very good defense against horsemen, to stopp a
passage into the Camp, to stand at the entrance into a work, or upon the gapp
of a work: They may be made so that ye may run them upon wheels, to
remove them from one place to an other and join their axeltrees together with
pinnes of iron, so that on a sudden ye may shutt in the passages unto an army,
and being so joined ye cannot remove the one without the other, so that these
turnepikes joined together gives the longer and better resistance. There are
other inventions to keep out an Ennemie, but having noe leisure now at this
time to treat of them, we will pass them over, and come to handle of the
Approches.

OF APPROCHES.
The 31, and 32 Plates, and 127. 128. 129. 130. 131. 132. 133. 134. Figures.
FOr as much as in approches (whereof we intend annon to speak) one must of
necessity use showels, spades, fire-rakes, pickaxses, mattocks, hatches, bills,
and axses, to give the more luster to our buysinesse I have thought good to
describe them here. And seeing Monsieur Doncker in his life time Controuler of
the fortifications in the united provinces, and besides at the siege of Gulick
Controuler of the princes of Brandenburgh and of Nieuburgh their ordinance, a
man being very skillfull in making these materials, gave me the model of them
in that true form as ye shall see them represented here to your view in the
31, and 32 Plates, by the numbers 127, 128. 129. 130. 131. 132. 133. 134. 135.
136. 137. 138. and 139.

The Figure 127 is an ammunition spade, whereof the part A B, is a foot high
and A, C, two foot, being in all three foot long: the point A B, is platted
with a sharp edge of iron some six inches broad, that ye may spitt a foot
into the Earth with it.

The 128 Figure is a showell, made more hollow, and some what greater, then a
spade, which cannot be used with that nimblenesse, as the former: because of
the great quantity of Earth, which it will take: so that for ordinary use I
should rather advise one to use the spade, for those that are not able, and
strong men.

The showel 129, has a plate of iron only, being fit to level, and plain
the ground, and for this reason (in my opinion) ought to be made longer, then
the other, because it must be used with as much strength as the other.

The Figure 130 is a pickaxe, well known to workmen, wherewith ye digg up a
stony and hard ground, into which a spade or a showell will not enter.

The 131 Figure is a Mattock, the head whereof is like an axe made bending,
which is also well known, and used to digg up hard and stony grounds.

The 132 Figure is a hatchet, to be used with one hand.

The 133 Figure is an Axe, to be used with both hand:

The 134 is a less kind of axe, used with both hands not usual in these
parts.

The Figure 135 demonstrated in the 32 Plate, is an ammunition wheele-barrow,
which will hold a foot of Earth deep, and if it be well loaded a foot and a
half, which wheele-barrow, as the Figure 136 shows, is made of an
i^nographick form, containing 16 inches in length, and 14, or 15, inches in
breadth, and 7, inches high, the boords being made for lightness of fur wood;
saving the axeltree, and the handles, which are of other wood some 17, inches
long, but the shorter they are, the better they are, and that for diverse
reasons.

The Figure 137 is a bill, to cut brush and branches with all, and useful
for the making of Bavins, and bundles of brush, Gabions, and for other
necessary occasions, as well in hutting, as to be used in trenches and works.

The 138 Figure is a kind of a crooked bill, serving for the same use.

The Figure 139 is a long showel, or a rake for the casting up of Earth out of
galleries, to fill up a moate, and in other dangerous places. And the form A,
in the 31 Plate, is good also to plain the Earth which is cast upon a
gallerie, to keep it from fyring, which otherwise might happen to a gallerie.

The 33 Plate and 144. 145. Figures.
BEfore we come to speak of Approches, it is very necessary, that one should
get an exact draught, as well of the interior, as of the exterior part of
that town, of fortress, which one resolves to approach unto, with all the
marks, and observations, as namely, of hedges, ways, hills, valleys, and the
like, that ye may know the better how to order and run your approches. Ye
ought not to break ground noe nearer at the first the^ within a muskett shot,
or at the furthest as far as a harquebusse a Crock can reach, and (as I say)
ye ought to begin your trenches, somewhat further off from the town; if
there be a commodious access from the quarter to the trenches, that when need
requires ye may the sooner relieve, and second your men in the approches, if
the Ennemie shall sallie, or fall out upon them. For, when the place where you
first break ground is a great way from the quarter, it will be disadvantagious
unto you, because ye must allwaies keep in them a strong guard, to repulse an
Ennemy, and to beat them back when they shall fa^lout, and while your men are
a making ready, and coming from the quarter, many good occasions may be lost,
before they cann be at hand. Therefore you must have a great care, and
circumspection, where your trenches are to beginn, and where your quarter must
be made, as near to and as covertly from the town as possibly may be,
considering well, whither it were not better to quarter sometimes the more
incommodiously, that ye may beginn your approches in a place of most
advantage, near unto the town, or place, which ye are resolved to take in:
then to choose a place more commodious for your quarter, that would be a
hindrance to your dessigne, by reason of the great distance between that and
the approches, or which may lie too open to Canon shot, all which in my
judgment ought to be maturely considered, that your dessigne may not be
hindered or fore-slowed.

The next thing is for you, to know the weakest part, and side of the town,
or place, where you may beginn your approches, and which place you intend to
gain. For, it is a great help, especially in places regular, to choose out
the most advantageous place. If you should make a breach in a curtain,
betvveene two bulwarks, ye shall find it to be the retyredst place, the best
to be defended, soonest cut off, and the hardest for you to approach unto,
therefore would advise you, not to beginn there. And if it has a tenaille,
then ye have less reason to make any attempt upon that place, having a retired
angle, and so consequently the cutting of will be according to their vvish. But
to approach to the angles of a Bulvvarke, which are angles shooting out, being
the exterior parts of a town, or fortress will be the easiest for you to come
unto, and the hardest for them within to cut off: seeing the place is little,
and that the ramparts themselves may give some hindrance there unto.

The place the^ being resolved on, a certain number of soldiers (or
Commanded men) are choosen out of every Regiment, and Company to the number
of 4, or 500 men, more or less, to go down in the night to break ground,
and to beginn the approches. Also there must be placed a competent number of
horse, and foot, to help to guard and defend these workmen, if an ennemy
should sallie out upon them. These commanded men have each of them ten stivers
a night, or more as the danger of the work shall require: they having men (as
is said) in arms lying round about them, to defend them as appears by the
numbers 20. 20: in the 145 figure. Then the Ingenier, who has the ordering of
the approches, setts these men out in a right (or a crooked) line placing three
or four men upon every rod, and all in a file, in as right a line as possibly
may be, taking special care, that his men may stand as much out of danger
of shot as is possible, which is done also by the help of these gates, which
lies about them in keeping their marches closse, that they may not be
discouvered by those of the town. More over, they must lay out Sentinel
perdues, before and round about them, which if they hear, or see any thing,
may give the alarm silently before an Ennemie can fall upon the workmen: For
the alarm being once given, these gards are to draw up, and help to defend
the Workmen. But if they see that the Ennemie sallies out to strong for them,
these gards then may draw into these Corpse de guard made purposely for them,
and withal the commanded men must quitt their work for that time, and bring
off their arms, spades, showells, and mattocks; but is have and necessity
constraines them, to defend themselves; then they must betake themselves to
their arms, and cast away their materials, retyring softly (with the gards
abouesaid) if they cannot make the place good, to the Corpse de guard made first
for their retreat. These works ought to be strong, and able to repulse and
keep out an ennemie, yea it often happens, that they upon a disorderly
retreat, into the town may be followed, and beaten back with the loss of
many men, even to their very moate side, and that the Besiegers may discouver
the strength, or weakness of their works, and spy out some advantages for
them. The Ennemie being beaten back, the commanded men may fall instantly to
their work again, and being got some 3 foot deep, and casting up the
Earth toward the town, they may work with the more safety, and out of
danger. And for this reason every soldier will make as much have as possibly
he can to get into the ground for his own preservation, and the Earth being
cast up thus out of holes, they may afterward repair it, and make thereof a
large trench, and ditch, namely, (as is said) 3 foot broad, and 3 foot high,
casting the Earth upon the edg of the trench, and the next day may make it 6
foot broad, and six foot high: for the larger the trench is, the higher ought
the parapet to be; because otherwise, they might be discouvered by those of
the town, and so your men may be the better under covert, and lie safer in
the said approches. And because this cannot be done so exactly by night, fresh
commanded men are sent down in the morning from the quarter to repair, and
enlarge the trenches, and if the trenches be so large, and so high, that one
cannot well discover the fields round about them, then ye must make a
foot-banke or two, for the musketeers to come to the topp of the trench to
give fire over the^ through muskett baskets, which is done mosttimes when a
sapp is begunn: At the first entrance into the trenches, or approches, ye make
a square work, or two, called Redoubts, or a Corpse de guard being distant one
from an other some 40, or 50, rod, that in them ye may keep a strong guard
the day following, and the Ingenier, who has the mannaging of the approaches;
may so order and encourage his men, that the said Corpse de guard may be in
defense before day, to the end, that if the Ennemie should sallie out upon the
trenches, that from the same Corpse de guard they may be beaten back: the
breadth of every side ought to be some 4, or 5, or at the most 6 rod, and the
ditch broad and deep as necessity shall require. They ought to be made in my
opinion in such a manner, that the two opposite angles do enfile the said
thrench as appears by the Figure 117, Plate 29, and by the Corpse de guard D E
F, Figure 145. For then the said trenches will not only lie open unto it, but
also one may discouver the fields round about it. But if it be not found good
to make them so, then the best way in my judgment were to make them out of the
Trenches a rod and a half, or at most two rods distant from them: so that the
said trenches ought to be between the town, and the said Corpse de guard: one
of the sides must be parallel to the said trench that ye may march by it in
the night, both with men and wagons, and to draw up the ordinance betvveene
the said Corpse de guard, and the Trench, and so the said Corpse de guard will
flank the said trenches on that side where they lie most open as ye may note
by the Corpse de guard in the 4, Figure, 145 and 33 Plate.

After your commanded men have wrought almost to the break of the day, then
they must be drawn off (without beating of a drum) by a Sergant or the
Quartermaster of a Regiment, and being returned to their quarter the Sergant
shall deliver the note of the number of his men to the Quartermaster of his
regiment, and the Quartermaster to the controuler of the works, who to that
end comes to v^site the said work and to see if there were as many men as was
appointed, least there should be any fraud committed therein. Then the
Controuler is to give the Quartermaster his attestation for the work men, or
in his absence the Ingenier gives the said Certificate, and the Quartermaster
brings it to the States, who gives an ordinance upon it to the Treasurer, and
so the Quartermaster receives money for the workmen of every company, to wit,
ten stivers, gives it to the Sergants and the Sergants to the soldiers of
every company.

The reparing of the trenches are made by the undertakers (as we have said)
for so much, or so much the rod, according as one desires to have them large
and spacious, as some times 6, 8, foot, or more, as necessity requires. For
oftentimes they must be so broad, that a wagon laden with fagotts, Brush, or
Gabions may go in them. The wages of every soldier is then augmented some
times to 15, 20, or 30. stivers a day, when there is evident danger, as there
is commonly, at last before one beginns to sapp: for the musketeers playing
continually upon the points of the Trenches, where they imagine that the
approches will run, kills many men: yea so that sometimes they are forced to
give over the work, because many men are not able to work in it, and being
too hott, they putt in a resolute man or two, into the work, promising to
give them more then ordinary if they will hasten the work, and this is
considerable, whither this extraordinary expense be not profitable for the
advancing of the approches, and gayning of time, then to spare a little money
and foreslow them: For experience has many times taught us: that expedition in
such cases has wrought many great effects.

When you are approached so near your Ennemie, that by reason of their
continual shooting upon your points ye cannot advance your trenches any
further; then you must beginn your sapp, which ye shall run, if it be
possible, directly upon the point or side of the Bulwark, which ye intend to
take in, as the point, I, and K, Figure 145, demonstrate. And because two men
at the most can but work in them, these sapps are ordinarily taken on by some
resolute soldiers for some 7, 8, yea or 12, gilders a rod, as the danger
requires: they first make the sap some 3 foot broad, and about 3. 4. 5. or 6
foot deep according as the ground is, either high or low, then these
undertakers or others are to repair the Sapps, and receive for their pains 6.
7. or 8, gilders a rod, and so make it 6 foot broad, or thereabouts casting up
the Earth on both sides, that they may be the better under covert, and the
safer from the Ennemies shot.

According to which we have made the Figure 144, whereof P, Q, are two
Bulwarks. A is the beginning of the Approches, A, B, the first trench or line
where the workmen break ground, carried in such a manner toward the angle
R. (in case the same line be lengthned and comes out of the Corpse of the
Fortress) in the angle B is made a Corpse de guard for the assurance of those,
which guard the trenches, as appears by the Figure 145 to the letter B. At C
is made a line toward the angle S, which must be drawn in such a sort, that
if it be lengthned, it will fall on the outside of the Corpse of the fortress
Q. which is continued (as the said Figure demonstrated) to I, the parapet of
the covert way, where one beginns a mine to blow up the counterscharfe, that
ye may come to the brinke of the moate. From D, is drawn the line E, K, to
assure one the better of the enclossure K, E, I, between K, E, and I, E
(before ye come to peerce through with your sapp) ye ought to make the lines L,
O, and F, M: that from these lines you may give fire upon the Ennemies
Musketeers, setting along upon these lines muskett basketts that ye may play
continually upon the besieged, that under the favor thereof, you may advance
your sapps toward the faces R, T, and V, S, as the said Figures 144, and 145.
shows. If the Corpse de guard be in some eminent places as they ought to be (if
it be possibly) after ye are advanced to them, ye make a battery upon them,
but if there be one piece of ground higher then another, that is more
commodious, which ye may choose for your batteries, as we have done here in
the Figures G, H, P, O, X, Z, Y, Figure 145.

Figure 142. 143.
WHen ye beginn your trenches of Approach, ye commonly make some battery, that
under the favor thereof your men may work forward with the more safety, and
hinder the Ennemies from falling out, which would much foreslow your works.
Your Batteries then are made first in such a manner that they may beat upon
the Parapet of the ramparts and Bulwarks of the town, to dismount the ennemies
ordinance, and for this reason you must raise your Batteries high according to
the height of the ramparts, so that your Canon may play freely about two foot
lower, then the topp of the parapet, according to which, and in consideration
of the distance, ye must raise your said batteries, taking heed that your
Canon be planted upon a plain superficies, and elevated some 13, degrees, when
the distance is far off: ye must not raise them so high as when the batteries
are near unto the place: so that ye must either raise, or sink them, as need
shall require. Ye make your batteries, and platformes according to the
greatness, and number of your pieces: for a Demy-Canon, being shorter then a
whole, of necessity the platform of the one, must be longer, and deeper then
the other, and seeing a Canon being mounted upon its Carriage, is some 16 or 18
foot long; it is evident, that the batteries ought to be made for recoyling
at the least 10, or 12 foot longer making together 28, or 30 foot: 12, or 15
of the first foot toward the parapet, must be vnderlayd with thick and
strong oken plancks and the other with hurdles, when ye have not plancks
enough: upon the said batteries ye make a parapet 12, 16, or 20 foot thick or
thereabouts, with port-holes for your canon as the Figure 143 demontrateth.
Sometimes ye set up Gabions 6 foot high and 3 foot broad filled with Earth,
for your ordinance to play out of, leaving a little space betvveene them, to
putt out the mouth of your Canon, which space so soon as the Canon is
discharged is presently stopped and blinded with a bundle of brush full of
leaves, that the ennemie may not discouver the port-holes, but when you make
your batteries upon the Counterscharfe, or upon the brinke of the moate, then
the port-holes as soon as your Cannon is sho^^ off, are shutt with doors of
thick oken planks musket proof, that the said port-holes may not be seen.
Sometimes ye set only Gabions upon the parapets of Batteries which contain 7
foot in Diameter, and 10 in height, yea oftentimes set 3 rovves of them upon
he said parapet, which make in all 21 foot thick as appears by the Figure
149, and the 34, Plate, There are usually made three sorts of Gabions, to wit,
the ordinary of 6 foot high and 3 foot wide: the middle sized 7 foot high,
and 5 wide, and the double Gabions 10 foot high, and seven foot wide in the
mouths, as appears by the Figures 146. 147. and 148. the platform or bed, is
a foot higher behind then before, or by the parapet to the end the pieces
may not recoyle too far, as also that with the more ease they may be drawn
up toward their port-holes, and seeing every piece is broad at the Axeltree
some 7 foot, ye must allow 5, or 6 foot for a space between the Axeltrees of
each piece one both sides and so haueing 4, 5, or 7. foot distance between
them one may the better come to the mouths of the pieces to lade them, for it
is necessary to have room enough unto both sides to come to them readily, that
being discharged ye may draw them up again into their places.

If the sides lie open, they must be blinded with a parapet of Earth or with
Gabions; at the furthest end of the battery, ye must make a cellar or a place
for your powder bullets and match and other necessaries, for the Conductour,
which shall give out the powder, the bullets, with a gentleman of the
ordinance, who shall give order to the Canoniers, when and how often they shall
shoot, and without whose knowledge, and Command they shall do nothing: the
ammunition which is there must be covered, with horse skinns and hair cloth to
prevent the danger of fyring, and to that end this hole is made in the Earth.
The circuit of the battery is oftentimes trenched about as the others in the
approches are, but otherwise, when an ennemie is not to be feared, only is
compassed about with match bound up with stakes, that noe man unawares or
without leave may come within the compass thereof. The entrance into the said
battery is made slooping, that one may the better come up, and go down, and
chiefly that ye may with the more ease draw up the Canon into them. The
Batteries must not be far from the trenches, but that upon all occasions they
may be seconded.

According to which directions ye shall easily make all sorts of batteries, as
for exemple: The General would have you to make a battery for four pieces of
Canon, ye must take for every piece at least 12 foot, in length: so that for
the four pieces ye must have 48 foot, and then for the two utmost pieces each
5 foot makes 10 foot, which with the 48 make in all 58 foot, which shall be
the breadth of the said battery for 4 pieces, excepting the Parapets and
Taluds, which oftentimes have as much Talud, as heith, and sometimes the
half, and for the depth, ye must take 28, or 30 foot, or thereabouts besides
the Parapets and Taluds, the first 12, or 15 foot are laid with Oaken plancks,
and the other with hurdles, for whole Canon, (as we have said) which carrye a
bullet of 48 pound weight, but some two foot less for the half Canon, and
for other pieces accordingly; The said plancks must be laid both at length and
sidelings, and the hurdles along the pieces, as appears by the Figure 143, in
which H is the ditch, G the edge, F the Talud, E the parapet, B the bedding of
the plancks, C the Talud. The Figure 142 is the profile of the said battery 8.
12 is the cellar, where the powder stands, which ought to be somewhat nearer
the battery then is marked here, and was made in the same time as the battery
was, and the Earth which is cast up out of it, is used to raize the said
battery: when ye have not earth enough to make up the battery with all, then
ye must digg round about it, as we have said in this exemple 143. But for a
battery, which is made upon the brinke of a moate, it is not commonly so high,
nor takes up such a great space, as this present battery does; because the
ground will not afford it, and that they cannot so well cover such places: so
that one is constrained to entrench them more narrowly, within the place to be
the more secure under convert from the short of the besieged, which forbeares
not to offend, ye as well by hand grenades as otherwise.

WHen you are come with your sapp to the parapet of the covert way, then you
must make batteries to beat down the flancks, and the other places of
defense of the Fortress or town, and vvithall ye beginn then to pierce into
their counterscharfe: and for the better effectuating thereof, if it be high ye
must make an entrance into it through a mine, so that your descent into the
moate may be made level with the Superficies of the water of the moate, which
descent must go down slanting as F, L, and the Figure 150, G, H, I, K, is the
furthest end of the mine, or the descent into the moate F, G, the height of the
mine, being 6 foot or above, and some 5 foot broad, or some what more, that
the Earth which is taken out of it may the more commodiously be carried away,
and that the more men may march in front in it. Before ye get in the ground
at the entrance ye must underprop it with posts as the former F, G, H, shows,
until such time as ye are got so deep, that ye are under the Earth, and then
for keeping the earth from falling down, ye must drive in posts on both sides,
and lay oaken plancks (which are not very broad cross upon them, continuing
so as you advance your mine in keeping the Earth from tumbling down: these
posts and plancks must stand and join closse one to another as ye see
represented by the Figures 150, and 153, Plate 34. In which F, G, H, is the
entrance into the mine to descend into the moate. The 3 first posts (because ye
are not yet entered much into the ground) are made in that manner as the Figure
152 demonstrates, the rest are set in that form, as the Figure 150 shows, in
such sort that I, K, is the entrance into the Counterscharfe. If the ground lie
low, and that ye cannot get into the counterscharfe after the manner
abouesaid, then ye must continue your sapp, to the brinke of the moate, and
that ye may keep it from fyring, ye must cover it over with fyrre plancks and
cast earth upon it, that your men may work with the more safety and that ye
may hinder the besieged from casting in of grenades, and other fire works, ye
must place musketeers round about the approches, which if they perceive the
ennemie cast any fire works from the rampart upon it, they may give fire
presently upon them.

Being gotten through the Counterscharfe and come to the edge of the moate: ye
presently cast abundance of fagots, brush and earth into it, to fill it up, and
one or two of your resolutest men leaps into the moate to lay them right upon
the face of the Bulwark, that as you fill up the moate to come to the skirt of
the Bulwark so ye may advance your gallery till you are over in setting your
posts forward, and laying plancks over it and casting Earth upon the gallerie,
which must be 7 or 8 foot high, and 6, 7, or 8 foot broad for the larger it
is so much the better and the more men may march in Front in it: the posts, or
supporters may be set some 5, or 6 foot distance one from an other, which
may be plancked on the in side, and on the outside with oake^ planks, and the
posts being some 6 inches thick, the gapps, or spaces between then, are filled
with Earth, to resist the force or violence of canon, and above the gall^rie,
as is said, ye cast upon it a foot or half a foot of earth thick, and then
spread it abroad with a fire-rake to keep it from fyring, which fire-rake is
described in the 31 Plate, by the Figure A.

The 151 Figure.
WHen you have putt over your gallerie (as we have said) then you must beginn
to mine, as the place, and as the Assaillants shall find it best, either upon
your right, or left hand, high or low, if the water hinder you not mining and
workeing in this manner following: The Earth which you digg out of the mine,
must be carried away in wheelebarrows through the gallerie whither you will. If
you please you may cast it into the water toward the angle of the Bulwark,
and so fill up the moate with it, if it be not incommodious for you to carry it
through the gallerie: But on the other side, ye must mark well the turnings of
your mine, which may occasion the Besieged to counter-mine, and so to hinder
the dessigne of the Besiegers. For if they have once discouvered, or met with
the mine of the Assailants, they must be forced to stopp it up and to abandon
it, and so beginn another. The Countermines which are made in ramparts, or
Bulvvarks when a fortress is new made, being some 5, or 6 foot high, and 3,
or 4 foot broad, are of singular use, which do encircle the place, and from
them ye may hear the least noise that is made on the outside, and which way
one works, and by that means may hinder them the better from myning.

These mines are commonly made in the form of a paralellograme or a long
square, to wit, the chamber in which the powder is laid, must be 4 or 5 foot
high, and 3 or 4 foot broad, and in length answerable to the ponderosity or
weight of the rampart, and according to the breach, which ye intend to make. If
ye would blow up the rampart on the inside, you must peerce into it some 6,
or 8 foot, and then ye must make your chamber, but only 4 foot high, some 3
or 4 foot broad, and some 6 foot long, according to the number of the
barrells of powder, which you mean to lay in it, and the greatness of the
wall, which you intend to blovv up. The reason why the chamber is made here
but only 4 foot high, is to the end that the exhalation finding the least
resistance toward the inside, forces it with the more violence and makes
therein a greater shaking and breach to the terror, and hurt of the besieged:
when ye would blow up the upper part of the rampart, the^ you make your mine
some what ascending upwards: if the moate be very deep, that your dessigne be
not frustrate by reason of the water, for your better assurance, ye must make
your chamber some 5, 6, or 7 foot high, to the intent that the exhalation may
break upwards according to the intention of the Masterminer. But the entrance
into the said chamber, as we have said above, must be only 4 foot high and 3
broad, to the end one may the better stopp it, and hinder the exhalatio^ from
breaking out backward, toward the gallerie, which one ought deligently to
prevent, in shunning those inconveniences and mischiefs, which oftentimes by
such casualities have happened heretofore.

Then having chambred your powder, and noted well, that those within have not
discouvered it: you must stopp, and shutt up your mine exceeding firm that it
may take the better effect. To do this, the best way will be to stopp it at E,
with two hughe plancks, just at the said entrance at E with great sparts of
timber, and driving them into the Earth, as firmly as possibly may be. The
chamber F G H I is 4 foot broad, and F G, and F, I, is six foot in length:
Oftentimes the breadth is but 3 foot, that one may be the better assured of
the resistance of the posts and plancks. In one of the plancks, which stops
up the entrance E into the mine, ye make a hole in it, to putt your train
through which runns from E, to B, that through it ye may give fire to the
powder in the said chamber: After these plancks ye damme up your mine with good
Earth, from E, to B: the turnings C D E, are made to delude the besieged, that
they may not find out your mine by counter myning; but most often it runns
right forward, or somewhat winding. The length of the chamber F, I, (which is
here but six foot) is made as long as necessity requires, but the breadth F
G, is ordinarily noe more then 3, or 4, foot at the most: and to weaken the
more the place which you intend to blow up; me thinks it would be good before
ye spring your mine to digg some Holes in some corners that the exhalation may
have the better vent, and easy bursting out. Some are of the opinion that a
barrel of powder will blow up 12 foot of Earth, according to which ye may
make the said chamber, and lay in as many barrils of powder as you please, to
the end you may make your breach the larger and more spacious. But seeing this
is yet vnresolved, I will leave the judgment thereof to those which have more
experience therein then my self.

How one must be prepared against a Siege.
The 35 Plate and 154 and 155. Figures.
HAving succinctly spoken of Approches, Sapps, the descent into a moate,
galleries and mines: me thinks it will not be amiss now to treat of the
preparations which must be made against a seige.

If then one should be suddenly surprised: so that there is noe time to make
any outworks, half moons, Horn works or other pieces of fortifications as
well loose, as joining to the wall, or place: one ought in my opinion (besides
the care that ought to be taken for materials, ammunition, and victuals
(whereof I do not intend here to speak) one is to take special heed upon
what side of the town or Fortress the Ennemie will beginn and run his
approches, toward what Bulwark he makes them, on which side I would make some
works to hinder an ennemie, as we shall declare in the 38 Plate and Figure 159.
But if one be advertized of the Siege some time before, or that ye imagine, it
will be good to provide such necessaries and to fortify those places with a more
capable defe^se, which we inte^d to speak of hereafter (according as ye shall
find the weakness of the place to require, and as time will permit you to do
it before ye be besieged) as well without the town as within, to make good
entrenchments and to provide munition, victuals, and men sufficient to defend
that place, without the Town, you must make Horneworks invented of late
years, Halfmoones, traverses, and other works, all tending to hinder the
Besiegers from getting into your moate, and to prolonge the siege with hopes of
relief, seeing experience has taught us, that when an Ennemy comes once to
enter your moate, and to putt over his gallerie, that town or place cannot
long hold out: if you have not made strong works, entrenchments, and
cuttings off without (to give an Ennemie his handful, and to make them gain
your work^ ynch by ynch) which notwithstanding are not of so good a resistance,
as is your settled, firm, and solid rampart. These works ought to be drawn
out according to the greatness of the place, and the men which ye have to man
them. For, if ye have many of those works, they will require a great many men
to defend them so that if ye have not men enough to keep them, that labor and
expense will be in vain, and so an Ennemie may soon become master of them.
And seeing in all observations, exemples are of great efficacy I have thought
good, and profitable to make you understand my intention by representing unto
you the Plate of Gulich prepared against that siege, whereof the Bulwarks of
the town are marked by the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, the Castle, which is
quadrangular by the Ciphers 6, 7, 8, 9. And seeing the town stands upon a low
ground, and the Castle upon the side 6, 9, 8, upon a higher ground: in all
likelihood the approches was to be begun on this side, as the Besiegers did in
the year 1611, for which reason, and to hinder the Approches on that side,
they made the angles 9. 8. and between them the Horneworks c, d, f, the
Ravelins c, g, h, b, being not further assunder one from an other, but that
from the curtain one might defend the utmost horns c, d, f. But seeing c, and
f, are very narrow, to wit, only some 24 rod, and shoot out far from the
body of the Fortress: in my opinion they ought rather and it had been much
better to have made the angles in the form of the Raveline c, and f, and so
have quitted the said horne-works, because (as we have said) they were too
straight, and narrow, and to have made them at g, or upon the curtain 6, 9,
the Horneworks 1, and (also whither the Raveline b, could not have defended the
Raveline c, in the place of the angle of the Bulwark 8) and to have made the
hornworke q. upon the curtain ^, 8, and so might have saved the Raveline a.
And between the two Bulwarks of the town 4, and 5, the Raveline r, and o,
between 3, and 4, and so have saved the entrenchment n, which runs out far
from the angle 3, and is of noe great defense. The Raveline k, is made between
the Bulwarks 2, and 3, to take away the entrenchment m, made in a Tenaille, but
the sides being of a very small distance, and for this consideration of little
use, yea many times hurtful as experience has shown oftentimes. The reason
why I make of the angles 8, and 9, the Ravelins, c, and f, in stead of the
Horneworks, is, that the Horneworkes d, and i, might be the better defended,
which will be reciprocaly defended from the said Horneworks, and will not be so
far distant from the body of the said fortress. Those which are of an other
opinion, may follow their own intention and experience, against whom I will
not contend acknowledging that experience strikes a great stroke in all
occurrence, saving that I am only permitted to give advise thereupon.

The said Horn works are made in breadth, and height as necessity requires and
as they may resist the forces of an Ennemie, and according to the time they
have to make them. For the first one makes a Rampart, or a parapet, some 12,
16, or 20, foot broad, 6 foot high, and a ditch of the same breadth of 12,
16, or 20 foot, and some 6 foot deep. If one cares not for the expense and
has time, ye may add to the former breadth 6, 8, 10, or 12 foot more, in
enlarging also to so much the breadth of the ditch, and then the Rampart is made
some 3. 4. 5. or 6 foot high, and upon it also ye shall make a parapett of 6
foot high, with a foot-banck some 3 foot broad, and a foot high, the ditch
is enlarged and deepned, according to the greatness of the Rampart, and as we
have taught in the Plates of our regular fortification before: and the higher
the Ramparts be, the entrenchments are the better covered: one may make them
the further from the place, to wit within a musket shot, so that there will be a
better means for entrenching, and cuttings off, and to fors^ow and hinder an
Ennemy from advancing his approches.

The 38 Plate and 159 Figure.
IF one has not time to make these works abouesaid, as when an Ennemy is
nearer at hand, then one did expect: After ye have observed well the place
toward which the Assaillant makes his account to beginn his approches, as
toward these two Bulwarks, one might make little ditches without them as A B C
D, which are in the extention of the Capitals beginning in the Angles A, C, of
the length of 600 foot, or thereabouts (to wit, that the utmost end B, D, be
not out of muskett shot) of the breadth of some 6 foot at the most, and 5
foot deep without the parapet, the Earth being playned from the one part to
the other, to the end that you may not hinder the sight of the musketeers,
which you shall lodge in them, and in stead thereof upon the edg of these shall be
set small muskett basketts filled with Earth, easy to be removed from one
place to an other: It will be good for ones better security to hold there a Corpse
de guard, that if the ennemie seek to beat them from thence, they may be the
more able to discharge their duties, whereby (in my opinion) the approches of
the Besiegers may be much hindered, and being so puzzled they will be constrained
every time to alter their dessignes and so to beginn their approches again a
good way further off, and more crookedly, as toward B, D, to which being come
they can get noe advantage, seeing they are enfiled with the angles of the
Bulwarks: If they had time to make chests in them, or to make them in such a
sort, that the Besiegers could not drive them out of them, it would be much
better.

Of Cuttings off, as well general, as particular.
The 36 Plate and 156 Figure.
IF an Ennemie be got into the skirt of the Bulwark g, h, and that one has
not time to cut it off royally, and yet you are resolved to make him gain the
place foot by foot, you must make the cuttings off f, l, m, whereof n, o, p,
is the ditch, making the angle of the Tenaille l, as much pointed as possible
may be, that the lines f, l, and l, m, may be the better seen from one an
other, carrying the outward edg of the ditch n, o, and p, as near the skirt g,
h as possibly may be, that ye may have the ditch as large as may be, to
hinder the taking away of the tenaille l. If the whole face be not ruined, but
only the angle of the Bulwark r, one shall make the angle t, from the
Tenaille s, t, u, (which in regard of the smallness of it will be better then
the former) so that on the inside of the cutting off x, y, z, one may have
space there to make the ditch as great and as deep as may be: the entrance
ought to be in the angle of the tenaille t. But seeing that fortification is
better, which has two flancked, and flanking angles, ye must make the
entrances in and out also double, to have the same the more easy, and if time
and occasion would permit, they may make in the angle t, two issues, which in
my opinion might be made upon the two sides s, t, and t, u, as near the angle
t, as one can: and ye must note by the way, that the Bulwark against our
intention is made massy, and not hollow.

The 38 Plate and 159 Figure.
IF the two faces be wholly spoyld, as the Figure 159. demonstrateth, then I
should think it good, to make the angles a, b, c, containing the angle of the
tenaille b, as little as may be to gain the better place of defense in
making the ditch, as large and as deep as is possible, as it is here marked
out by the lines d, g, and e.

When the Bulwark has a Catt noted B, and that its angle h, is ruined, then
one might so order the cuttings off l, m, n, o, and the ditch p. q. r. s* t,
that the besiegers should be compelled to undermine the Catt, and to pass the
ditch, which the lines p, q, r, s, t, represents upon the edge exterior.

But if the whole Bulwark be ruined, you shall draw from the midst of the
curtain of the Bulwark ruined a privy line marked by the letters h, I, upon
the inside whereof, ye shall make the two skirts of the bulwarks, according to
our general method given in our regular fortifications, and the other cuttings
off h, k, l, m, n, i, shall have: the other Bulwark B, being also ruined, one
may draw the privy line s, h, and make within it two other skirts, as h, o,
p, q, r, s, and so o, h, k, p, l, will be a perfect bulwark, having flancks,
gorges, faces and curtains of the same proportion, as the two Bulwarks had
which were ruined, and by this means every place as well regular as irregular
may be cut off. Many other sorts of cuttings off might be described,
according to the situation of the place, and the manner of attempting, by the
industry of the lngenier, which has the ordering of such cuttings off: But
seeing the like inventions were abundantly practiced in the Town of Ostend, the
Lovers thereof may peruse the 25 Plate of this bocke, and see what cuttings
off was used there, the ennemy having possessed half the town, before he
gained the whole.

How one ought to carry him self upon an Assault.
The 36, and 38 Plates, and 156, and 159, Figures.
IF the ennemie prepares to give you an assault, and that his breach be great
enough, those within must labor by all means and seek to stopp it and to
defend them selves in the best manner they are able, and above all if it be
possible to drive in some strong piles upon the top of the breach, which we
before have called palisadoes, for an assault, described in the 33 Plate and
Figure 140, each palissadoe having 2 iron pinnes some 10 inches long, driven
through them, as we have said that by this means one may keep them from
coming up and entering the rampart or breach. Now seeing the breach ought to be
defended by able men, furnished with arms fitting to such an end, ye must make
choice of your best ablest, and most courageous men, which must stand under the
breach to second those which helps to defend it, and shall fall on, when they
see their fellow soldiers repulsed back. On the inside of the cutting off you
shall place some other troops of a stronger body then the former, to the end,
that if those men, which defends the breach, should be forced to retreat into
the ditch, that the others at that very instant may show themselves upon the
top of the rampart of the new cutting off, and if there be any means to plant
a piece of ordinance or two upon it (which may be blinded till the Besiegers
falls on) it will greatly offend them. The entrances, and sallies to the said
breach, ought in my opinion (if the cutting off be in the tenaille of the
angles t. l. Figure 156, and b, 159) of an easy access, being raised as little
as possibly may be, whereof the one may serve for an entrance, and the other
for a coming out, choosing the one or the other for the most commodious,
according to the situation of the place. And seeing the cuttings off (as we have
said before) are esteemed the best, which have two angles flanking, ye must at
the first make the cutting off, h, k, l, m, n, i: Figure 159, to be raised even
with the height of the rampart, or according to the height of the Bulwarks, if
they be a little lower, then the curtain, if that the batteries do not
command them. For in such a case, you must raise it much higher, that from
thence (with the more vivacity, and courage) ye may repulse the Assaillants.
But seeing this cutting off is of a better defense, and is much more labor,
then the cutting off, a, b, c, ye must consider well, it time will give you
leave to do it, if not ye may make use of the cutting off a, b, c, for
oftentimes necessity has noe law.

And seeing experience has taught us too much what difficulties, one shall
meet with all in such cutting off: the only way is in my mind to hinder (as
much as possibly may be) the Ennemies descent into the moate: which besides
other inventions that are in use, may be done by the means of the cuttings
off, at the lines a, b, and c, d, Figure 159, which are made here right
opposite to the angles of the Bulwarks from one part to an other, besett with
small muskett baskets and filled with Earth as we have said before.

Of Casemates.
The 37 Plate and 157, and 158, Figures.
FOr as much as we have seen the difficulties, which Casemates have caused to
the besieged, and the small benefit they have received by them, which not
withstanding have been made with all the industry that possibly might be,
thereby to hinder an Ennemie from putting over a moate and making his
batteries upon the brinke of the moate, to beat down the flanks, and to
dismount the pieces of ordinance, planted in the said Casemates, to wit, that
besides the expense, the gorges are made by this means lesser, the Orillon or
pillow being noe more then the 2/3 of the flanck, and is of little resistance,
and on the other side gives but little advantage, being soon stopped, as we have
seen in time past: I was minded not to have spoken of them at all, though I
esteem them good, if they were made in such a sort, that there mouths might
not be stopped up, and the pieces within them dismounted: which has not been
done hitherto to my remembrance. For^f^hese Casemates be made of brick batts,
when the Besiegers shall play upon them with there ordinance, the bricks flying
into the port-holes will do more hurt to the Canoniers, and other men, then
the Ennemies bullets themselves, and by this means the portholes will be easily
filled, and stopped up, as we have seen in diverse places. If your Casemate
be made of Earth, ye must give it a great Talude (that is much slooping) which
makes the gorge so narrow, namely in those Fortresses, which are under an
Hexagone, that oftentimes there will be hardly any entrance into the bulwark,
which we call the gullet, the Orillon, and the flank very little, and
consequently will be of little resistance, wherein they find so many
difficulties, that many great Captains have resolved wholly, to leave them
unmade. If one could not preserve them otherwise then they have done to this
present: I should approve of them: But seeing I cannot resolve of a thing, which
I dare not wholly approve off, because experience, and many men slain in the
wars have not found it good, this is my opinion also. In the Figures 157, and
158, of the Plate 37, a, b, is the utmost end of the shoulder, the double of p,
a, Figure 157, the mouth, or porthole of the Casemate, and as b, p, makes 150,
foot, so p, a, will make 50 foot, p, t, equal to p, a, will be likewise 50
foot, t, v, is 36 foot, from a ye shall draw a line to u, that ye may the
better discouver the exterior brinke of the moate, and the said t, u, shall
contain three portholes for three pieces of Canon, which shall be vauted over
from d, e, to, t, u, with steps as the Figure 158 demonstrats, marked between
t, v, and e, d, in such sort that the first Vault on the side of e, d, is
closse by the superficies of the water enlarging or raising the said Vaults
more and more, until that the last vault toward t, v, be raised above the
superficies l, f, g, k, which is the plateforme of the Casemate, some 3 foot,
or thereabouts, and seeing that t, e, and d, v, are about 20 foot, ye shall
advance as far as possibly ye can the parapet t, f, and g, v, as much as the
canon, and the place will permit you, to give the better soliditie and
firmness to the parapet of the Casemates. Then upon the topp of the basis f,
g, e, d, the said parapet shall be so raised that the inside f, g, shall be lined
with a wall, that it may prevent the falling down of such a height, and so
that the ennemie may not discover the upper part of your vault, h, i, k, l,
and firmly joined as well to the wall, as to the Orillon and on the outside
with hard Earth, as strong as possibly may, going down sloopingly, that it
may not be subject to tumble down into the moate, and this will hinder the
Ennemie greatly from entering into the moate and putting his gallerie over. For
by this means they must be driven first to beat down the shoulder, and make
it to fall into the moate at the space p, a, e, d, which for this reason must
be made as deep, as possibly ye can, to the end, that the portholes 3, 4, and
5, be not easily stopped, the place l, k, f, g, is about 20 foot uncovered, and
the vault i, h, l, k, also 20 foot broad. The line h, i, is about some 54,
foot: the Colomne is made in the midst of l, k, to make the vaults crosswise:
because the distance between l, k, is too great, to make there a single vault,
which may serve to make upon it the parapet of the superior place, to gain
more place for the gorge, and to lodge the Canoniers, and there ammunition dry.

The entrance into the Casemate must be in that place, where m, n, is, under
the rampart, and must be vaulted from m, to i, and from n, to o, being some 10
or 12 foot broad, or thereabouts, that ye may the better draw in your
ordinance and all what ye have need of into the Casemate, and make it as high
as necessity requires: The orillon a, v, y, b, is al together massy, that it
may give the greater resistance. And because ye may the better understand our
intention, we have added hereunto the Figure 158, which raised work is
represented in perspectiue: in which ye may see the parapet of the false bray,
the port-holes of the Casemate, and other things, which we have thought
necessary to make known.

The 38, Plate and 160, Figure.
A Fortress being thus provided with good false-brayes, as well under the
Bulwarks, as along the curtains, broad according to our former plots: I could
wish that a Casemate weere made in that form which we shall now describe, and
that the curtains, were drawn in as the far as the breadth of the falsebray
with the parapet contains, to wit, that the false brayes under the Bulwarks
might end on the outside of the foundamentall lines a, b, and the like: and
contrariewise, that in the curtains the said falsebrayes may end within the
said fundamental line c, d, so that the space i, f, g, may be accommodated,
as the Figure 160, represents, to plant therein two pieces of ordinance,
which will work noe small effect: and by this means the Casemates, will be
better preserved then otherwise, because ye need not fear the flying of
brick-batts about your ears, seeing that the flanck e, will serve as a stay and
a covert thereunto: so that in stead of one shoulder ye shall have two, to wit,
b, p, and c, e.

The descent into the false-bray, which goes round about the Bulwark ought to
be made at m, and to come out at y, and seeing one makes sometimes some privy
sallies, between A and p, one might also make the entrance into the Casemate
in this place, making a vault from m, to y, to wit, in the vnderpart of the
Casemate: The entrance into the false bray from the curtain ought to be made
at w, from one and the other part. The letters q, r, s, t, v, represents the
place where I would maks Catts, if one resolves to make them: but seeing I am
not resolved about this point, I will rather speak nothing thereof at this
present.

Figure 2. 160. and 38. Plate.
IF the Bulwark be not massy, but hollow, ye may make your entrance into the
Casemate, as here toward o. r. p. l. z. and the entrance into it should be at

Of Brass ordinance.
The 39. and 40. Plates and 161. 162. 163. 164. Figures.
WE were minded to have treated of diverse other dependances belonging to
fortificatio^, as of bridges, gates, ports, foundations etc. how towns and
public places ought to be fortified; but the Printer not willing to stay any
longer for the finishing of this book, it is not possible for me to effect my
intention, so that my project also touching the casting of brass ordinance is
for this reason also frustrated, having been minded to have described the
proportion, as well of their carriages as of their charges, and other
dependances about them. To which end I had ordained these 4 brass pieces which
are usually cast in the united provinces, according to the scale hereunto
annexed: whereof the least carries a bullett of 6 pound weight with the Figure
noted 161: the second is the Figure 162 and carries a bullet of 12 pound
weight, the third 163 carries a bullett of 24 pound, and the fourth marked with
the Figure 164. carries a bullet of 48 pound, of the two last, the first is a
half Canon, and the last a whole canon, or pieces for battery: the two
others are field-peeces, bearing a bullet of 6, and 12 pound. In the mean
while, he that desires to know the proportions of them may make use of this
scale, till we write more at large thereof.

ALBERT GIRARD.
BEfore we come to describe the two tables, whereof we have made mention
before, supputed of a new: we vvil explain some terms, which we have
introduced, because they were namelesse before. To that end we vvil take one
of the Figures of the eleventh Plate excepting the last which is the 68, and
the line N C being drawn, which we will term the gullet (to distinguish
it from N A, or A C, the gorges) which comes to cut through the Capital,
being drawn further within the Figure, in a point, where the letter Z, is
made, then E, Z shall be called (the extention) that is the lengthned capital,
for the Bulvvarks extends so far outvvard. Then the angle G, A, C, (the
forme-flanck). Also in the 60, or 61, Figure E L, shall be called the Raid
majour, and L A, the Raid minour, finally, in the sixth Plate, the line D, F,
or K, L, is called the surface as being placed before the face (for surface is
a word not much used, and as superficies signifies all one thing: ye must not
think that the second table is calculated amiss; because the progression of
the second flanks do increase, even to that of the Heptagone, and then
diminishes: for if one should continue the table from the one end to the
other, it would follovv, that the angles of a Polygone, should be equidistant
130, degrees (which well nigh contains the second flank majour 8. 412) and
so have the second flanks equal. we understand equidistants the one so much
more then 130, as the oth^^ less. Likewise the defense flancking, diminishes
even to a Pentagone and then augmenteth. The least that we can observe is,
where the angle of the Polygone is 113, degrees, to wit, of 53, 366, and the
Equidistant are equal. One may say the like of the first table, which
decreaseth to 48 rod, and afterward increases. The fortification of a right
line holding not with the one or the other table, is placed betvveene them
both. Those that will make use of them proportionally, for the building of
irregular Figures commits noe small errors, though Marolois was of this
opinion, and so much the more, because the angles of the Polygone are about the
right angles, for the other Polygones differ alvvaies less one from an other,
the further they fall from the quadrate: so that we to this end, if we were
vvilling to make use of them, the tables whereof the angles of the Polygones
are progressiue of 3, or 4, degrees of space, would be of a better choice, and
should here take place if time would permit us. Let there be here some small
exemple thereof, and suppose, that one would fortify an angle of 99, degrees,
whereof the two sides are each of them 36 rod, and 3 primes, and take a
Pentagone, or a quadrate to imitate, and let us take a quadrate by which
means, he shall find the lines as they are hereunto annexed: which done, let
us take the 7, Figure of the second Plate: to speak more intelligibly thereof
let us demand of him, how much the angle C B Evvilbe. BF Capital 13, 15 BE
The face 16, 00 ED The flank 5, 16 DF The gorge 6, 15 BA Defen. Flanc. 33. 94
Angles required FBE 32 degrees. 15. min. BFD 130. 30 EDF 90. Angles of a quadrate
30 degrees 135. 90.
He will say, that to the half of 99 he has added 15, and the sum is for
the said angle C, B, E, and that the angle B, F, D, is adjunct of the half of
99, to wit, 130, 30, afterward he cannot deny, but the number of lines,
which he has found may receive the angles of the square-Bulvvarks halued as
there annexed: for the lines are drawn proportionally from thence: as then
the consequence will be absurd, seeing that the quadrangle, having the four
lines known and D the right, which are 5 common terms of both sorts of a
quadrangle abouesaid: The unknown angles shall receive each of them a
certain number of degrees, as appears by our Trigonometrie, and not two
sorts of numbers for each angle, so that if F, comes to be 135 degrees as it
is, it can never make 130, and 30, and so of the rest. Now of one should take
the angles as he requires it, and the two sides F D, D E, the other lines
will be otherwise, then he has calculated them, for in stead of 16, 00, the
face, one shall have 51, 04; and in stead of its flanking 35, 94, ye shall
find only 32, 44, and so of the rest, which is an error of 3^ rod, upon 32,
here then are small lines and great faults, what would those be then in great
and solid fortifications. To conclude, we will propound one question asvvell
to exercise those which are addicted thereunto, as for to end this discourse:
A square fortress regular has the face 24 rod, and the curtain 36, with an
angle forming the flancke of 40 degrees: without a second flanck: how many
then will the other angles and lines be? The manner to resolve this, and the
solution ye shall see hereafter, when we have made some treaty upon that
subject, with hope shortly to bring to light, the restoration of Geometry,
touching the parts thereof, which have been lost hitherto, whereof the
Authors are Euclid, Aristeus the elder, Eratosthenes, and Apolonius Pergeus,
with some other parts of the mathematiques all according to our vveake power,
by the help and grace of God.
