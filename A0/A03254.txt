A SHORT CATECHISM, SVMMARILY COMPRIZING THE Principal points of Christian
faith, somewhat corrected and augmented by JAMES BALMFORD Minister.

Prou. 24. 27. Prepare thy work without, and make ready thy things in the
field, and after build thine house. blazon or coat of arms

AT LONDON, Imprinted by Felix Kyngston, for RICHARD BOIL. 1607.

TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL, THE Master, Wardens, Assistants, and whole company
of Carpenters in London, JAMES BALMFORD, a Carpenters son, and a builder,
according to his calling and gifts, wishes the continual edification of their
godly faith while they travail in this vale of tears, and at the last the end
of that faith even the salvation of their Souls.
THis little Catechism has been long in Print, but not yet dedicated unto any.
Being now to reprint it with other little treatises, I have thought it
convenient to dedicate it unto you, as a monument of my thankefulnes for your
many favors, but especially for your charitable exhibition, when I was a poor
student in Oxford; Hoping that this dedication will not only encourage you to
continue, and increase (as God shall enable) your Christian charity to
Students of good hope in either University (than which I know not a more
charitable, and fruitful work of faith) but also stir you up both to read
the Catechism diligently your selves, and carefully to cause your families to
learn it. For it is commonly seen; that (howsoever too many be newfangled,
yet for the most part) men are rather moved with those Treatises, which are
expressly and specially addressed unto themselves, and that by such as, in
some special sort, belong unto them. This only I desire, that ye would take
some pains in examining the quotations, because they give both light unto the
understanding, and warrant to the confirmation of the several points of this
Catechism.

I doubt not of your good will; but whereas this Catechism is likely to come
into the hands of some, who will not, with you, intertaine it favorably for
my sake, I suppose this objection: One general, and well conceived Catechism
does most edify; therefore many are but to little purpose: Whereunto I readily
and freely answer; That, having experience how profitably the studies of
children have been furthered, since diversity of Grammars has been abolished,
and one certain Grammar generally to be taught, by act of Parliament
established, I grant that one general and well conceived Catechism does most
edify, in respect of public use: But I am assured, that, as sundry Grammars,
so sundry Catechismes do much good in private study, and use. For the same
method of teaching which seems to some plausible and pleasant, plain and
profitable, does not seem so to other; And one Catechism does more clearly
lay open some points of Christian faith, than another, yea handles some
necessary point, which another does altogether omit. Again, It helps much to
the confirmation of faith, when it is seen, that, howsoever sundry men in
sundry ages and countries, publish sundry Catechismes, or make sundry
confessions (between which two there is no great difference) as to say with
John Baptist, Behold the Lamb of Joh. 1. 29.
God which takes away the sins of the world; or with Peter, Thou art the
Christ the Son of the living God, the one publishing his office, the other
confessing his nature; yet they hold the same Head, believe in the same Christ,
justify the same Wisdom, and profess the same Truth. What great profit do
Gods children reap by the Harmony of co^fessions, as of Churches, so of
ancient and late writers? What benefit has, and does redound to the Church of
God by sundry Creeds, not only extant, but some of them in public use too, as
the Apostolic, Nicene, and Athanasian, every one does know, and acknowledge.
In these considerations I conceive hope, that this little Catechism will be
offensive to none, but acceptable to you, and profitable to all such, as with
religious humility will use, and peruse it. And the rather, because they shall
find the most necessary doctrine of the Lords Supper more plainly set down in
this Catechism, than in many other of no greater volume.

Well, what good opinion soever this Catechism shall find in the hearts of
other Readers, let me exhort you as a brother, to edify your selves, with all
holy diligence, especially in hearing the Word preached, and (as you may) in
reading first the Scriptures, and then other Godly Treatises; Understanding
that Edification, so much commended and commanded in Holy Writ, does signify
Building. Of which spiritual building, your temporal building should daily
put you in mind; Lest otherwise ye incur a censure and sentence, like to
that of the Prophet Haggai, Hag. 1. 4. 6. 1. Cor. 3. 9. 16.
viz. Can ye build houses for your selves, and other; and will ye carelessely
suffer the Temple of the Lord (which is your selves) to lie waste? Ye shall
therefore earne wages, and put them into a broken bag. But hoping (as I wish)
that ye will more and more apply your hearts unto wisdom, even that wisdom
which is unto salvation, I commend you to God, and the Word of his grace, which
is able to build further, and to give you an inheritance among all the^ which
are sanctified.

Q. If a true faith be such a persuasion, who then be partakers of those
four meritorious works of Christ?

A. True faith is always such in it own nature, but believers are not always
sensible of so great a comfort, because of their infirmities.

Q. May I crave some proof hereof for my confirmation, and comfort?

A. Consider well, 1. The quoted proofs of the description of Faith. 2. That
otherwise it should not differ, either from Opinion Luke 24. 21. 25. Act. 26.
28. 29.
which in it own nature is doubtful, or from the Devils faith Iam. 2. 19.
which trembles, because it does not apply. 3. That the Godly Psalm. 27. 13.
and 77. 9. 10. Ma^ke 9. 24. 2. Cor. 12. 7. 8. 9
have acknowledged as much. 4. What power 1. Pet. 5. 5. 6. 7.
Faith is of to preserve true believers from despair, their great fears
notwithstanding. And 5. That it is therefore Romans 8. 15. 16. 26. 27. Matthew. 14.
30. 31.
like unto the Spirit of Prayer, which the faithful distressed feel weak in
themselves, but find strong in the effect.

Q. How may we know when we have a true faith?

A. When we know that our faith t is grounded on Gods Word; Romans 10. 14. 17.
Philip. 4. 4. 5. 1. Pet. 1. 6. 8.
Rejoices in the Lord more or less; but always vnseignedly, notwithstanding
crosses and tribulations; and Mat. 7. 18. 20. Galat. 5. 6. Iam. 2. 18.
In love brings forth good fruits, which are good works.

Q. What call thou good works?

A. Mat. 19. 16. 17.
Those which God requires in the ten Commandments.

Q. What if good works be wanting?

A. Iam. 2. 20. 21. 26. Titus 1. 16.
Then is instifying faith wanting whatsoever we profess.

Q. Can good works justify?

A. Job. 29. Iam. 2. 18.
They justify in declaring us to be just before men, Romans 3. 27. 28. and 4. 2.
5. 6
but they do not justify in making us just before God.

Q. Why so?

A. Gal. 3. 10. and 5. 3. 4. 17. Hebr. 12. 13.
Because they are not perfectly done of us.

Q. To what purpose serve they then?

A. Matthew. 5. 16.
To glorify. God, 1. Pet. 2. 12.
and profit our brethren.

Q. Touching our selves what use have they?

A. 1. Tim. 1. 5. Iam. 2. 22.
They are certain signs of unfeigned ^aith* Romans 2. 6. 7.
and of GOD are well rewarded.

Q. If good works be rewarded, then they merit, if they merit, then they
justify?

A. Romans 8. 17. 18
They are rewarded for Christ his sake, Hebr. 10. 36. 2. Cor. 1. 20.
and because of Gods promise, Luke 17. 7. 8. etc.
but not for their own worthiness

Q. How are Faith and good works begun in us?

A Romans 10. 14. 17.
By preaching of Gods word, and working 1. Cor. 12 3 4 2. Cor 4. 13.
of his holy Spirit.

Q. How are they increased* and continued in us?

A. Ephesians. 4. 1. etc. 2. Cor. 3. 18.
By the same means, and further by the use of the Romans 4 11.
Sacraments and Mark 9. 24.
prayer.

Q. What are the Sacraments?

A. Romans 4. 11.
Holy signs and seals of Matthew. 26. 26. etc. 1. Cor. 12. 13.
Jesus Christ* and his benefits.

Q. How many Sacraments be there?

A. 1. Cor. 10. 2. 3 and 12. 13.
Two: Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord.

Q Why be there two Sacraments and no more?

A. Hebr. 9. 15.
Because the maker and Mediator of the new Rom 11. 27.
Covenant Matthew. 28. ^9. 1 Cor. 11. 23. 25
ordained these and no more, Mark 1. 4.
as seals of the same.

Q. What difference is there between these two?

A. Baptism signifies our new Titus 3. 5.
birth, or entering 1. Cor. 12. 13.
into the Covenant: and therefore we are but once baptized.

Q. How does the Supper of the Lord otherwise signify?

A. Our spiritual feeding or continuance in the Covenant, and therefore Act. 2.
42. 46. and 20. 7. 1. Cor. 11. 24. 26
we receive often, and not only once at Easter, which is Leuit. 23. 6.
Jewish.

Q. Why are children baptized?

A. 1. Cor. 7. 14.
Because they be the seed of the faithful, and therefore Genesis 17. 7.
within the visible Covenant, so that the seal thereof is to be Act. 10. 44.
47. Genesis 17. 11. 12.
administered unto them.

Q. Why receive they not the Supper of the Lord?

A. 1. Cor. 11. 28.
Because they cannot examine themselves.

Q. Of how many things does a Sacrament consist?

A. Two: a sign perceived Mark. 1. 4. ^. 1. Cor. 11. 23. and 10. 25. 2. 3. 4
by sense, and a thing signified, not at all perceived by sense.

Q. In Baptism which is the sign, which is the thing signified?

A. Act. 8. 36.
Water the sign: Christ his blood Ephesians. 5. 25. 26. Hebr. 9. 14.
the thing signified.

Q. Whath does the washing of the body signify and seal unto us?

A. Act. 22. 16. Romans 5. 9. and 3. 24. 25.
The washing away of our sins by the blood of Christ, which is our
Justification.

Q. What does it else signify and seal unto us?

A. Romans 6. 3. 5. 1. Cor. 6. 11.
The reforming of our actions and affections in the name of Christ, Gal. 3. 27.
24. Ephesians. 4. 23.
which is our Sanctification.

Q. In the Supper of the Lord, which is the sign, which the thing signified?

A. 1. Cor. 11. 23. 24. 25.
Bread and wine the sign, Christ his body and blood the thing signified.

Q. What signifies the breaking of the bread, and pouring of the wine?

A. 1. Cor. 11. 24.
The breaking of his body and Mark 14. 24
shedding of his blood.

Q. What does the eating and drinking signify and seal unto us?

A. Psalm. 104. 15.
That as bread and wine preserves our natural life: so John 6. 54.
Christ his body and blood is our spiritual food unto eternal life.

Q. How so?

A. Because Christ is our continual 1. John 1. 7. 9.
Justification and Romans 8. 10. 11.
Sanctification.

Q. Why call thou the body and blood of Christ spiritual food?

A. 1. Cor. 10. 3. 4. Ioh. 6. 35. 63. Ephesians. 3. 17.
Because it is spiritually received by faith, not corporally eaten with teeth.

Q. Are not the body and blood of Christ called spiritual food, because the
substance of bread and wine is transubstantiated into the substance of Christ
his very body and blood, though only the accidents of bread and wine remain
and be seen?

A. No: For such a Transubstantiation, is most contrary to this spiritual
banquet, for three reasons.

Q. Which be they?

A. If there be such a Transubstantiation, then this Sacrament should want the
outward sign. For the accidents; without the substance of bread and wine
cannot nourish, and therefore there is no sign perceived by sense, to signify
spiritual feeding, not perceived by sense.

Q. What is your second reason?

A. This Trausubstantiation being a miracle, should be evidently seen (as was
Joh. 2. 8. 9. 10. 11.
the transubstantiation of water into wine at the marriage in Cana) for
confirmation of the word, especially in a Sacrament. Seeing both Mark 16. 20
miracles, and Romans 4. 11.
Sacraments be called Signs, in regard of such confirmation.

Q. What is your third reason?

A. By such Transubstantiation, the supposed spiritual food, should be a body
and blood presently made of bread and wine, and not the body and blood of
Christ crucified, and long since Galat. 4. 4.
made of a woman, which this spiritual banquet does signify, and seal unto
faithful receivers.

Q. If there be no such Transubstantiation, how then can we eat Christ his
very body, and drink his very blood, which are bodily substances Act. 3. 21.
abiding in heaven, and that only by faith spiritually?

A. As they who acknowledge his Majesty to be their only sovereign, and do
accordingly submit themselves unto his government, become members of the same
politic body, whereof his very person is head: So they Ioh. 1. 12. and 6. 35.
37. Act. 4. 12. Ephesians. 4. 13. 15.
who by faith profess Christ to be their only Savior, and do accordingly
commit themselves to his salvation, become members of the same mystical body
whereof his very person is the head.

Q. You speak now of the whole person, and incorporation; but before of the
body and blood of Christ, and feeding.

A. As 1. Cor. 12. 13. Ephesians. 5. 23. Ioh. 15. 1. 4.
Incorporation, and other borrowed speeches of Holy writ, so and 6. 56. 1. Cor.
10. 16.
Feeding signifies our spiritual communion with Christ, yet with some further
consideration.

Q. What is that?

A. To teach us that we are incorporated into Ioh. 12. 32. 33 Romans 6. 3.
Christ crucified. As we are fed with the flesh of beasts not living, Act.
10 13.
but slain.

Q. Is not this the reason why both bread and wine be necessarily distributed
in the Lords Supper?

A. Yes: and further, 1. Cor. 11. ^3. 24. 25. Matthew 19 6.
because of the institution: 1. Cor. 11. 26.
for a lively representation of Christ his death: Joh. 19. 32. 33. 34.
differing from the thieues death: Leuit. 7. 2.
and answering to the sacrifices: Psalm. 104. 1^. Ioh 6. 35. 54. 55.
and for the comfortable assurance of our perfect nourishment.

Q. Is not then our perfect nourishment another consideration of our spiritual
feeding, besides our incorporation into Christ?

A. Yes: for Io^ 6. 57.
if we eat Christ, we shall live by Christ, and and 4. 49. 51. 52.
that (as it were) with health, and 15. 4. 5.
which is the effect of such incorporation.

Q Express this yet more fully.

A. As he who corporally feeds with good digestion, feels his heart Act.
14. 17. 1. King. 19. 7. 8
gladded, and the whole man better enabled to perform the actions of natural
life: So be who spiritually feeds by a true faith, feels Romans 5. 1. 2.
the peace of consciente, and Galat. 2. 20. John 6. 57.
the whole man better enabled to perform the actions of a spiritual life.

Q. Then I perceive that the Scripture uses borrowed speeches in regard only
of Eating and Drinking, and not of Christ his body and blood; because our
communion* though really and verily with Christ himself crucified, is yet by
the spiritual mean of a true faith.

A. It is so; As may be evidently seen in the 6. chapter of John so often
quoted. For whereas in the 54. verse Christ says, Whosoever eases my flesh,
and drinks my blood has eternal life; in the 35 verse he says, He that
comes to me shall not hunger, and he that believes in me shall never thirst.
So that F^eding* Coming, and Believing are manifestly* th^^ case, all on^, And
consequently our receiving of Christ crucified must of necessity be spiritual.
As it further appears in the 12. verse of the first chapter of the same book.

Q. All that come to the Lords table, do they spiritually receive the body and
blood of Christ?

A. No: The wicked receive only ^uke 1^. 26. 27. and 22. 14.
the signs* to their damnation, not John 13. 2. and 6. 35.
the things signified to their salvation.

Q. Why so? 2 Thessalonians 3. 2.


A. M^t 8. 11. 12. 1 Cor. 11. 27.
Because they receive unworthily.

Q. How may we receive worthily?

A. By coming to the Lords table with John 6. 35.
Faith and 1. Cor. 11. 30. 3^
Repentance.

Q. What is repentance?

A. A forsaking Ezec. 33. 11.
of our sins and turning Jerem* 4* 1* 2.
to God, by Matthew. 4. 17.
amendment of life.

Q. Can we believe and repent of our selves?

A. Philip. 1. 29. Ezec. 11. 19.
No: And therefore we must crave Mark 9. 24. Je^em. 31. 18.
these and all other graces of God by hearty prayer.

Q. What is prayer?

A. Luke 18. 1. etc.
An earnest request to God, in y^ name John 14. 13.
of Christ for all things Iam. 4. 3.
necessary.

Q. How may we be sure to obtain all things necessary?

A Mar. 9* 22. 33
If we ask in faith: Matthew. 21. 2^*
For so God has promised. To whom b^ glory for ever.

Amen.
A PRAYER.
O Most merciful and gracious Father, whereas we are not able of our selves to
perceive the things of the Spirit, 1. Cor. 2. 14.
being natural men, yea so foolish Ierem. 4. 22.
and of no understanding, that howsoever, we are wise to do evil, to do well
we have no knowledge, we most humbly beseech thee for Christ his sake to
remember thy Ier. 31. 33.
Covenant, and teach us by thy Ioh. 16. 13.
holy Spirit, which searches all things, 1. Cor. 2. 10. 12.
yea the deep things of God, to know those things which thou have given us.
Suffer us not therefore, O Lord, with the 1. Ioh. 5. 19. 20.
world to lie in wickedness, but give us a mind to know thy Son Jesus Christ,
who is very God and eternal life. And open our Luke 24. 45.
understanding, that we John 5. 39.
searching may understand the Scriptures, which are able to 2. Tim. 3. 14. 15.
make us wise unto salvation. And whereas sin Hebr. 12. 1. 2
hangs so fast on, that we cannot run the race that is set before us, with an
eye still looking to Jesus the Author and finisher of our faith, with groaning
spirits we entreat thee, to separate them from us, as far as the East is Psalm.
103. 12.
from the West, that having laid a sure foundation Hebr. 6. 1.
of repentance from dead works and faith toward God, we may be led forward to
perfection, and having learned the doctrine of the beginning of Christ, we may
grow Ephesians. 4. 15. 13
up into him which is our head, until we meet together in the unity of
faith, and knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, and unto the measure
of the age of the fulness of Christ. That so growing in 2. Pet. 3. 17. 18
grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we be not plucked
away with the error of the wicked, and fall from our own stedfastnes: but
having the righteousness Romans 1. 16. 17.
of God revealed to us from faith to faith, we may perceive indeed, the Gospel
to be to us the power of God to salvation, and so go from strength Psalm. 84. 7.
to strength, till we appear before God in Zion. Which graces, with all other
blessings spiritual and temporal, for our selves and every member of thy
Church, we beg of thee O holy Father in the name and mediation of our Lord and
Savior Christ Jesus, further recommending our selves, our prayers and wants to
thy fatherly consideration, concluding in that most holy prayer which our
Master himself has taught us, saying: Our Father which art in heaven, etc.

FINIS.
