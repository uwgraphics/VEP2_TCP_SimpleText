PROPER PSALMS.
The Penitents Confession.
To the tune of the 51. Psalm.
The first part.
THy mercy, Lord, I wholly need,
Yet dare not crave it at thine hands;
Thou say his prayers shall not speed,
who is intrapt in sinful bands:
Can I then hope, or boldly come,
which nothing am but filth and sin;
Polluted from my mothers womb,
in thought, in life, without, within?
2
Thy glory does amaze me quite,
consuming fire thou seem to me;
I fear and quake before thy sight,
mine heart does faint, approaching thee:
Thine anger hot against sinners is,
their sacrifice thou do detest;
The cleansed hands, no thoughts amiss,
the purest life, do please thee best.
3
How dare I then to th 'Heauens hie,
or Thee which sit^st in glory there,
Once look, or lift my sinful eye,
whose heart, whose thoughts, whose hands vncleere,
Corrupt, defiled, distayned are,
most loathsome (which my self must rue)
If once my conscience do not spare
to lay them open unto my view?
4
The guilt, the filth, the weight of sin,
affrights, confounds, and makes me sink:
Dismay, shame, sorrow, never linne,
but force me to the hopeless brinke:
Thy wrath I fear, thine eyes I shun,
my self I loath, mine heart I break:
If mercy fail, I am undone,
here must I die, here must I wreake.
5
But why should I doubt of thy grace,
or dread thy mercies sweet to crave,
Since thou desire to turn thy face
on him which would thy mercies have?
In judgment thou do not delight,
much grieuing at a sinners fall,
And take it for despair or spite,
if fallen, he will not on thee call.
The second part.
TO Moses (Lord) thou do proclaim
the self long-suffering, loath to strike:
Thy Prophets all assure the same,
that death of men thou do not like:
Yea, thou expectest their return,
and call'st upon them thee to seek:
Thou profer'st grace to men forlorn,
and shewst thy self a God most meek.
2
But were thy proffers none at all,
or Prophets silent were herein:
No more assurance could befall,
then that thy Son did die for sin.
Thy dearest Son, our Savior kind,
that spotless Lamb, the mighty God,
The skorne, yet ransom of mankind;
which felt, and brake thy furious rod.
3
In vain thou did not down him send,
so to afflict his body dear,
His blood to spill, his flesh to rend,
his side to pierce, his head to tear:
Such torments he has not endured,
for his own faults in any deal:
Man's safety he thereby procured,
for by his stripes he did us heal.
4
His blood was price of ransom large,
and bath to cleanse my sinful soul,
Admit that price for my discharge,
purge through that bath what is in me foul:
Grant me thy spirit, that pledge of grace,
t'assure my heart of mercy come:
Forgive, forbear, forget, out-raze,
my sin, thy wrath, my guilt, thy doom.
5
Make soft this stony heart of mine,
t'imbrace thy word, to melt with grief;
This flesh corrupt reform betime,
lest sins adiourn'd find no relief:
To all thy mercies I resort,
vouchsafe them all on me to send,
Prevent my fall, my ways support,
assist my course, and crown mine end.
To thee then blessed Trinity, Bis.

O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;
My soul shall say in verity,
thou God delight'st in mercies most.
The Sinners Confidence.
To the tune of the 124. Psalm.
O Lord thou have
commanded men to pray,
And promise given
to harken what they say;
Most specially,
when that they troubled be:
(The troubled mind
most welcome is to thee)
I troubled pray,
but prayers naught comfort me.
2
I pray and sin,
and sin and pray amain;
I sin and pray,
and pray, but sin again:
O God what will
become of me poor wight?
If thou should judge
according unto right;
Damned should I be,
and cast out of thy sight.
3
It Is true, if thou
no mercy should extend;
My hopes were vain,
in vain my prayers I spend:
But since thou (Lord)
wil'st not a sinner dye,
I dare approach
and to thy mercies fly,
Assuring me
my sins thou will pass by.
4
Not for my self,
who wretched sinner am;
To whom belongs
naught but confounding shame:
But for the death
of thy beloved Son,
Without whose blood
mankind had been undone:
By it alone,
my soul her peace has won.
5
Then pray my soul,
but cease again to sin;
At least delight
not (wilfully) therein:
So think of grace,
that thou Gods judgment fear:
Sin he abhorres,
though sinners he forbear:
To him be praise,
his Son, and Spirit most dear.
Our Saviors birth.
The first part.
IF any day (Lord) shined to man,
wherein thy power and love
Conioin'd for good of all the wor'd,
a Father thee to prove:
It Was Christmas day, that
this blessed day,
which often
now we celebrate,
When God for man 'came God and man,
hels fury to abate.
2
A day which puts us all in doubt,
what first we should admire:
Thy love, or grace, or power divine,
all three did here conspire:
Exceeding love, t'abase thy Son,
for man a worm and dust:
But mercy more, t'incarnate him,
for sinners and unjust.
3
But that he should man's flesh assume
yet perfect God remain;
That Uirgins womb should him conceive,
yet free from touch of stain:
This was thy power, that dazels quite,
all humane wit and skill:
The wise does daunt, and satan quell,
who man had thought to spill.
4
(Lord) what is man that thou should thus,
grace and extol his nature?
His flesh is filth, his entrails dung,
His life a breath, a vapor.
Thy Son true God, even as thy self,
eternal, pure, a spirit:
If other nature he would take,
next was the Angels bright.
5
The case all one, for both had sinned,
and Gods just wrath prouok'd;
It Was man had fallen, so Angels had,
hell had them both enyoak'd:
To rescue Angels from their loss,
was never his intent:
That nature therefore he would take,
which to redeem he meant.
The second Part.
To the tune of the 148 Psalm.
YEt Angels were the chief,
these news which did conuoy;
The Uirgins first belief,
an Angel raised with joy;
The very morn,
an Angel told,
And did unfold,
when he was borne.
2
His name he did define,
a Savior, Christ the Lord;
Confirmed it with a sign,
which strong might make his word:
And showed the place,
the manger and Inn,
The swathes he lay in,
his birth and race.
3
Those tidings to make sure,
an host of Angels bright,
Lift up their voices pure,
God praising in the height:
Assuring men
Of Gods good will,
And peace to their fill,
By Christ come then.
4
Thus Angels which no part,
of comfort nor release,
Need by him incarnate,
their ioying would not cease:
Even for man's sake,
Who of this birth,
Both in heaven and earth,
The fruit should take.
5
Yea blasing star above,
bright glittering in the sky,
As Herald of Gods love,
points where the Babe does lie.
The Sages three,
With odors and gold,
(Which was foretold)
Greet him on knee.
6
Unworthy then, us say,
the name of Christ to bear,
If that we will not wey
this birth, this love so dear.
To us alone,
This child was meant,
This Son he was sent,
This holy one.
The third part.
NOw since the benefit is ours,
if Angels, much more we,
Ought praises sing, which best befit
the glorious Trinity.
For this his incarnation strange,
all persons three contrived,
The Father him sent, the Son flesh took,
by the Spirit he was conceived.
2
What each here did, let us the same
perform in our degree;
For not in tongue alone, in acts
this birth expressed must be:
The Father first, showed love, grace, might,
more then we could desire,
All which we must examples make,
not only them admire.
3
Since God on high loved us below,
we ought love one another:
The iustest God releast man's sins,
man must forgive his brother.
In one to join both God and man,
that power exceeds our line,
Yet in this flesh we may, we must,
have minds, show works divine.
4
The second person flesh became,
(O strange humility!)
The Eternal God bereaved himself
of all sublimitie.
Auaunt all vaunt of birth, of race,
of learning, beauty, wealth:
Christ had all these, yet left them all,
to work mankind his health.
5
The holy Ghost, the person third,
the Uirgin pure infused,
Of her was borne this happy babe,
the Serpents head which bruised:
Open we our hearts to this good spirit,
that entering by his grace,
He may anew in us Christ form,
sin wholly to displace.
6
O dreadful blessed Trinity,
in this new birth accord,
That infant-like, we pure may be,
chaste, harmless, meek (O Lord:)
Accept us (Father) for thy sons,
us (Christ) as brethren take,
Breathe life, give strength, (O holy spirit)
us Gods true children make.
7
O Jesus sweet, whose birth us saved,
from Satan, sin, and death,
So break their force, that they may not
us damn to hell beneath:
Heaven thou forsook'st (O babe thus born)
to make us just by thee:
Lord with thy justice so us cloth,
that there our place may be.
8
And since of heaven to make us heirs, Bis.

thou took'st the flesh of man;
Here make us sons, there crown us saints,
sweet Jesus say Amen.
Christo nato Laus summa incarnato sola

Nouembers Thanksgiving.
The first part.
SHed tears, clap hands, yield sighs, rejoice
our mirth with throbs allay;
The trembling and triumphing voice
do both befit this day:
This day, whose danger dread did make,
whose rescue quit annoy,
Record the one, it will cause us quake,
th'escape will raise our joy.
2
The power of hell, the arm of Rome,
combined themselves, ah woe!
This day to make the day of doom,
our State to overthrow:
By bloody men; not men, but fiends,
whose shape and hearts did differ.
Men's looks did harbor devils minds,
our Church and Realm to shiuer.
3
This Realm, which florish'd had so long,
with peace and plenty store;
This Church, which truth had kept from wron^
home schisms, and forrraine lore:
Yea, this was it which eaus^d their ruth,
and stird them to conspire,
It Was Englands peace, it was Churches truth
which set their rage on fire.
4
And rage of fire was their design,
close couched as a net;
When King, Queen, Prince, and Roial line,
Peers, Prelates, Commons met:
One train, one touch, one slash, one blow,
One frush, one hoist, one hour:
Had finished what they did fore-trow,
and crushed the lands whole power.
5
Our Realm made headless, void of guide,
our State confusion mere,
Our Land a prey on every side,
the Gospel banished clear:
Our streets with clamor had bin filled,
our streams had run blood red:
Our eyes with tears bin thick distilled,
our hearts through horror dead.
6
Then on this day, this dismal day,
can we sing Psalms of gladness?
Affrighted thoughts, deep sighs, dismay,
this days design best witness:
Cease we to sing, let us quake for dread,
and tremble while we think,
Of their so monstrous bloody read,
who swear our Realm to sink.
The second part.
To the tune of the 124. Psalm.
HAd their lewd plot,
for death and change designed,
Attained the end,
which wrath and oath defined:
No cause of joy,
no matter were to sing;
But war and blood,
which horror use to bring:
Then praisd be God,
from whom our joy did spring.
2
Close they conspired,
yet he their secrets knew:
Deep they did dig,
and he their engines view;
They silence swear,
but God their silence brake:
The oath they took
upon their wafer cake,
Could not beguile
him, who does ever wake.
3
Scarce durst they trust
their tongues with what they thought,
Much less their pens,
what with their tongues they wrought;
Yet their own tongues
and pens their facts made plain,
Their riddles dark
gave light them to arraigne,
Even when they thought
most sure their Powder train.
4
Let then no man
lay claim to this disclose,
It was the Lord
alone, that kith'd our foes;
Our King inspired
their riddle to assoile,
Their knot to break,
their project thus to foil:
Such care has God
for Kings anoint with oil.
5
Great is his power
in every rescue made:
But this was strange,
the plot so close was laid,
So long held on,
even to the very day:
Secure were we,
and confident were they.
Give fire, quoth Vaux,
Hold off, our God did say.
6
The knife which was
for Izacks throat prepared,
Even at the touch
was stayed, and he was spared.
From Sodoms fire
Lot hardly escaped free,
Yet saved he was:
So were the Children three:
Like was our case,
from death even snatched were we.
7
So that this day
our Birthday we may call:
We were not, and
we were, at the instant all:
As men therefore
joy at their childrens birth,
So sing we Psalms
of laud, of glee, of mirth,
To God alone,
who guides both heaven and earth.
8
This day is his,
through that deliverance strange,
Which we among
the solemn Feasts will range.
O blessed God,
thou Savior of all men,
Which kepst us safe
from that prodigious den,
Thy name be praisd
for evermore, Amen.
Christ's Resurrection.
The first part.
WHat greater cause can Christians have
th eternal God to praise,
Then that our Lord out of his grave
this day himself did raise?
Not full three days were past when he
was nayld unto the cross,
Sustayning on that cursed tree,
with scorn and pain, our loss.
2
His head with thorny crown was pressed,
his bodies joints were stretched,
The dearest blood out of his breast
with Iauelin keen was fetched.
His vital spirits with torture spent,
his ghost he yielded up:
And paid to Nature what she lent,
by drink of deadly cup.
3
Dead sure he was, so taken down,
balm'd, spied, in linen bound,
In grave was laid (not earthie mowne)
hewne out of rocks most sound,
Which covered was with massy stone,
sealed, grouncel'd, watch't with men.
Close he was coucht, as fully gone,
no life was looked for then.
4
The Priests began skoffe, the people doubt,
The Apostles hearts did quail,
To see their Master thus cast out,
their Savior so to fail.
We hoped, said some of them, that he
would Israel have restord:
And us advanced next him to be,
our King and Sovereign Lord.
5
Lo, he, not minding promise made,
lies past recovery dead:
This day the third since he was laid
in grave, obliuions bed.
Yea, strong'st in faith, erst fierce to fight,
were now so unbelieving.
Not Angels, women, men, not sight,
persuade could he was living.
6
To grave they come, and find the stone
rolled off, the clothes cast by:
His mother tells them he is gone,
and void the grave they spy:
Perplexed they lurk, 'twixt hope and grief,
expecting this event,
Striving with faith and unbelief,
wondering what should be meant.
The second Part.
To the tune of the 148 Psalm.
IN this distress, that joy
might fearful doubts remove;
Himself does news conuoy,
their faith thereby to prone:
And says, It Is I,
Be not afeard,
It Is sooth ye have heard,
Truth cannot lie.
2
Have not the Scriptures told,
that Christ should dye, and rise?
This might have made you bold,
were you but Scripture wise:
The root of Iesse,
(Fast deep in the ground)
Springs not in a stound,
Lives nere-the-lesse.
3
Have you so soon forgot
(O dull Disciples mine)
The type by Jonas lot,
which I gave for a sign?
As he in the fish,
So I in the tomb,
Should live as in womb
And not perish.
4
In Natures course you find
(whereof I once foretold)
The corn which men do grind,
and it for bread do mold,
It will not thrive,
Nor the seed take birth,
Till it rot in the earth,
And so revive.
5
How often did I it preach,
(in words direct and plain)
That death should me attach,
yet I should rise again?
Killed I must be,
(By Elder and Scribe,
And those of my Tribe)
But or days three.
6
Yet, though you me now see,
you take me for a sprite:
And trembling seem to flee
amazed and affright:
Come near and try,
A spirit, at once,
Has not flesh and bones
As you see have I.
7
He willed to set him meat,
prepared for their store,
Which he did take and eat,
at the instant them before.
Not far from brinke,
He caused their drag,
Such fishes to lag,
That the ship began sink.
8
Even doubting Thomas, who
reports would not believe,
By touch did feel and know,
that sure he was alive:
The wounds accord,
His hand in the side,
Forced him that he cried,
O God my Lord.
The third part.
To the tune of the 45. Psalm.
CHrist Jesus our Lord is raised
from death, from grave, from hell,
Whose bands, rot, rage (his name be praised)
by rising he did quel.
Though Satan thought him sure,
when once his life was gone;
Sopposing mankind past all cure,
their Savior now had done.
2
Yet when he found that death,
Christ's triumph proved to be,
The grave to save* descent beneath,
make way for victory:
He roues, he raues amain,
but rage is more then force;
Blunt is his sting, cut short his train,
broke are his darts in course.
3
Death is by death devoured,
and hell in hell subdued,
The grave in grave it self is scowr'd,
and sin does sin exclude:
O death where is the sting,
and hell thy victory?
Come sin, thy marshaled forces bring;
defeated back they fly.
4
These once were terrors fierce,
before their strength was broke,
Till Christ by rising from his hearse
did lead them all in yoke.
Against us they may avail,
and tempt us by surprising,
But cannot as they will prevail,
he lives that conquered rising.
5
Shall we then light-let sin,
not eying Satan's lure;
Or hell contemn; not fear deaths gin;
do ill, and walk secure?
No, God forbid: As he
dyed, sin in us to kill:
So did he rise again, that we
might do his righteous will.
6
The end of that his rape
was us to justify,
That we, in heaven, sins guilt might escape,
in earth sins acts might fly.
Assurance eke to give,
that though our bodies dead
Corrupt in grave, yet raised shall live,
and live with Christ our head.
7
(Lord) help us rise aright:
first raise our faith to thee,
Then raise our minds by thy good spirit,
in earth heavens joys to see.
Our souls these corpse must leave,
these bodies lie in grave,
Though low they lie, yet up them heave,
both souls and bodies save.
Amen.
A Psalm for the Kings Majesty on the 24. of March.
O God, who powr'st on us amain
thy blessings manifold,
And naught requir'st, but that thy name
for them may be extold:
To us this day thou gave a King,
our greatest worldly bliss,
Thy praise therefore t'extoll and sing,
this day we will never miss.
2
Long was this day desired to come,
by those which did us hate,
Full hoping that Elizaes doom,
our land would quite amate:
At least that thy Religion true,
(with us so long professed)
Into Romes superstition new
should then be changed, as best.
3
Which to effect, they plots laid down,
by pen, by force, by slight,
On foreign head to plant the Crown,
through feigned pretense of right:
Contrived there were invasions,
by Malcontents at home,
Who joined with other nations,
to show their love to Rome.
But thou which see from heaven above,
their complots did deride;
Preventing, of thy wonted love,
all harm which might betide.
For though that Queen so from us hent,
our hearts appalled much;
(Whose wise courageous government
kept us from dangers touch.)
5
Yet thou made known thy love and might,
conioyn'd for Englands sake,
In midst of darkness raising light,
caused joy, when hearts did quake.
No sooner was that Phoenix gone,
but (so thou did aread)
In all the world suruiues this one,
and he becomes our head.
The second Part.
THe right was his by blood, not blade,
the womb a King him bore;
And Natures dowre was perfect made,
by educations lore:
Zeal, learning, virtue, birth by kind,
do show, to Englands fame,
That grace, art, nature, were combined
a perfect King to frame.
2
King JAMES he hight, Great Britans light,
who powerful as the Sun,
Does cherish Truth with all his might,
and errors darkness shun:
A King, who David's praise deserves,
framed fit to Gods own heart,
For with his heart that God he serves,
from whom he will not start.
3
Lord bless him with full length of days,
his years let doubled be;
Protect thou him at all assayes,
from danger quit him free:
So tender him, as thou would keep
the apple of thine eye,
In war, in peace, waking, asleep,
still hold him thee fast by.
4
Confound his foes, not only those
who shall rise up in arms,
Or mischief with their tongues disclose,
or work his outward harms:
But also those, who in their hearts
conceive against him ill,
Reveal their secretst inward parts,
before they work their will.
The third part.
STrength thou his hand, when, truth to seal,
he writes, or fights against sect;
His pen, his sword, his skill, his zeal,
guide, edge, increase, direct.
Uouchsafe to him that promise great,
to David firm'd for good,
That when he long has held his seat,
succeed may of his blood.
2
His wife, our Queen, sweet CHARLES his son,
Princess ELIZABETH
Bless, that of them we still have one
to reign while man has breath.
Our sins may shorten half his days,
thy wrath they so incense;
(For sinful subjects wicked ways
good Kings often rid from hence.)
3
Sins most we fear, yet least omit;
they vex thee, us they please;
On us them wreake, him clear acquit,
his Throne safe guard in peace:
Or rather, though we wrath deserve,
two mercies join in one,
Forgive our sins, our King preserve,
so dread we shall have none.
4
Unto our prayers (Christ) Bis.
bend thine ear
thou God and guide of men;
What for our selves, and King most dear
we ask, grant Lord: Amen.
FINIS.
