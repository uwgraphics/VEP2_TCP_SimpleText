THE TRAGICAL HIStorye of Romeus and Juliet, written first in Italian by
Bandell, and now in English by Ar. Br.

In aedibus Richardi Tottelli. Cum Priuilegio.

To the Reader.
THe God of all glory created universally all creatures, to set forth his
praise, both those which we esteem profitable in use and pleasure, and also
those, which we account noisome, and loathsome. But principally he has
appointed man, the chiefest instrument of his honor, not only, for ministryng
matter thereof in man himself: but as well in gatheryng out of other, the
occasions of publishing Gods goodness, wisdom, and power. And in like sort,
every dooyng of man has by Gods dyspensacion some thing, whereby God may,
and ought to be honored. So the good doyrges of the good, and the evil acts
of the wicked, the happy success of the blessed, and the woeful procedinges of
the miserable, do in diverse sort sound one praise of God. And as each flower
yeldeth honey to the be: so every exaumple ministers good lessons, to the well
disposed mind. The glorious triumph of the continent man upon the lusts of
wanton flesh, incourageth men to honest restraynt of wyld affections the
shameful and wretched ends of such, as have yielded their liberty thrall to
foul desires, teach men to witholde them selves from the hedlong fall of
loose dishonestie. So, to like effect, by sundry means, the good man's exaumple
byddeth men to be good, and the evil man's mischefe; warns men not to be
evil. To this good end, serve all ill ends, of ill begynnynges. And to this
end (good Reader) is this tragical matter written, to describe unto thee a
coople of unfortunate lovers, thralling themselves to dishonest desire,
neglecting the authority and advise of parents and friends, conferring their
principal counsels with dronken gossyppes, and superstitious friars (the
naturally fit instruments of unchastity) attemptyng all adventures of
peril, for thattaynyng of their wished lust, vsyng auriculer confession (the
kay of whoredom, and treason) for furtheraunce of their purpose, abusyng the
honorable name of lawefull marriage, to cloak the shame of stolen contractes,
finallye, by all means of dishonest life, hastyng to most unhappy death. This
president (good Reader) shall be to thee, as the slaves of Lacedemon, oppressed
with excess of drink, deformed and altered from likeness of men, both in
mind, and use of body, were to the free borne children, so showed to them by
their parents, to the intent to raise in them an hateful lothyng of so filthy
beastlynes. Hereunto if you apply it, ye shall deliver my doing from offense,
and profit your selves. Though I saw the same argument lately set forth on
stage with more commendation, then I can look (...)

The Argument.
Love has inflamed twain by sodayn sight.
And both do grant the thing that both desire.
They wed in shrift by counsel of a friar.
Young Romeus clymes fair Iuliets bower by night.
Three months he does enjoy his chief delight.
By Tybalts rage, provoked unto ire,
He pays death to Tybalt for his hyre.
A banished man he scapes by secret flight.
New marriage is offered to his wife.
She drinks a drink that seems to (...) her breath.
They bury her, that sleping yet has life.
Her husband heart the tydinges of her death.
He drinks his bane. And she with Romeus knyfe,
When she awakes, her self (alas) she sleath.
Romeus and Juliet.
THere is beyond the Alps,
a town of ancient same,
Whose bright renoune yet shines clear,
Verona men it name.
Bylt in an happy time,
bylt on a fertile soil:
Maynteined by the heavenly fates,
and by the townish toil.
The fruitful hills above,
the pleasant vales below,
The silver stream with channel deep,
that through the town does flow:
The store of springes that serve
for use, and eke for ease:
And other more commodities
which profit may and please.
Eke many certain signs
of things betyde of old,
To fill the houngry eyes of those
that curiously behold:
Do make this town to be
preferde above the rest
Of Lumbard towns, or at the least
compared with the best.
In which while Escalus,
as prince alone did reign,
To reach reward unto the good,
to pay the lewd with pain.
Alas (I rewe to think)
an heavy hap befell:
Which Boccace skant (not my rude tongue)
were able forth to tell.
Within my trembling hand,
my pen does shake for fear:
And on my cold amassed head,
upright does stand my hear.
But since she does command,
whose hest I must obaye,
In moorning verse, a woeful chance
to tell I will assaye.
Help learned Pallas, help,
ye muses with your art,
Help all ye damned feendes to tell,
of joys retournd to smart.
Help eke ye sisters three,
my skillesse pen tindyte:
For you it causd which I (alas)
unable am to write.
There were two ancient stocks,
which Fortune high did place
Above the rest, indewd with wealth,
and nobler of their race.
Loved of the common sort,
loved of the Prince alike:
And like unhappy were they both,
when Fortune list to strike.
Whose praise with equal blast,
fame in her trumpet blew:
The one was cliped Capelet,
and the other Montagew.
A wonted use it is,
that men of likely sort
(I wot not by what furye forsd)
envy each others port.
So these, whose egall state
bred envy pale of hew,
And then of grudging enuyes root,
black hate and rancor grew.
As of a little spark,
often ryseth mighty fire,
So of a kyndled spark of grudge,
in flames flashe out their ire.
And then their deadly food,
first hatchd of trifling strife:
Did bathe in blood of smarting wounds,
it reued breath and life.
No legend lie I tell,
scarce yet their eyes be dry:
That did behold the grisly sight,
with wet and weping eye.
But when the prudent prince,
who there the scepter held
So great a new disorder in
his common weal beheld:
By ientyl mean he sought,
their choler to assuage:
And by persuasion to appease,
their blameful furious rage.
But both his words and time,
the prince has spent in vain:
So rooted was the inward hate,
he lost his buysy pain.
When friendly sage advise,
ne ientyll words avail:
By thondring threats, and princely power
their courage began he qua^le.
In hope that when he had
the wasting flame suppressed,
In time he should quyte quench the sparks
that boornd within their breast.
Now whilst these kyndreds do
remain in this estate,
And each with outward friendly show
does hyde his inward hate:
One Romeus, who was
of race a Montague,
Upon whose tender chyn, as yet,
no manlyke beard there grew.
Whose beauty and whose shape
so far the rest did stayne:
That from the chief of Veron youth
he greatest fame did gain.
Has found a mayte so fair
(he found so foul his hap)
Whose beauty, shape, and comely grace,
did so his heart entrappe,
That from his own affairs,
his thought she did remove:
Only he sought to honor her,
to serve her, and to love.
To her he writes often,
often messengers are sent:
At length (in hope of better speed)
himself the lover went:
Present to plead for grace,
which absent was not found:
And to discover to her eye
his new received wound.
But she that from her youth
was fostred evermore
With virtues food, and taught in schole
of wisdoms skillful lore:
By answer did cut of
thaffections of his love,
That he no more occasion had
so vain a suit to move.
So stern she was of chere,
(for all the pain he took)
That in reward of toil, she would
not give a friendly look.
And yet how much she did
with constant mind retire:
So much the more his fervent mind
was pricked fourth by desire.
But when he many months,
hopeless of his recure,
Had served her, who forced not
what pains he did endure:
At length he thought to leave
Verona, and to prove,
If change of place might change away
his ill bestowed love.
And speaking to himself,
thus began he make his moan:
What booteth me to love and serve
a fell unthankful one,
Since that my humble ^ute
and labor so wede in vain,
Can reap none other fruit at all
but scorn and proud disdain:
What way she seeks to go,
the same I seek to run:
But she the path wherein I tread,
with spedy flight does shun.
I can not live, except
that nere to her I be:
She is ay best content when she
is farthest of from me.
Wherefore henceforth I will
far from her take my flight:
Perhaps mine eye once banished
by absence from her sight:
This fire of mine, that by
her pleasant eyne is fed:
Shall little and little wear away,
and quite at last be ded.
But whilst he did decree
this purpose still to keep:
A contrary repugnant thought
sanke in his breast so deep:
That doutefull is he now,
which of the twain is best:
In sighs, in tears, in plainte, in care,
in sorrow and unrest.
He moves the day, he wakes
the long and weary night,
So deep has love with pearcing hand,
ygraud her bewty bright.
Within his breast, and has
so mastred quite his heart:
That he of force must yield as thrall,
no way is left to start.
He can not stay his step,
but forth still must he run,
He languisheth and melts away,
as snow against the son.
His kyndred and alyes,
do wonder what he ails,
And each of them in friendly wise,
his heavy hap bewayles.
But one among the rest,
the trustiest of his feeres.
Far more then he with counsel filled,
and ryper of his years.
Began sharply him rebuke,
such love to him he bare:
That he was fellow of his smart,
and partner of his care.
What meanst thou Romeus
(quoth he) what doting rage
Does make thee thus consume away,
the best part of thine age,
In seking her that scorns,
and hydes her from thy sight:
Not forsing all thy great expense,
ne yet thy honor bright.
Thy tears, thy wretched life,
ne thine unspotted truth:
Which are of force (I ween) to move
the hardest heart to ruthe.
Now for our frendships sake,
and for thy health I pray:
That thou henceforth become thine own,
O give no more away.
Unto a thankeles wight,
thy precious free estate:
In that thou love such a one,
thou seemst thy self to hate.
For she does love else where,
(and then thy time is lorne)
Or else (what booteth thee to sue)
loves court she has forsworn.
Both young thou art of years,
and high in Fortunes grace:
What man is better shapd then thou?
who has a swetter face?
By painful studies mean,
great learning have thou won:
Thy parents have none other heir,
thou art their only son.
What greater grief (trowst thou?)
what woeful dedly smart
Should so be able to distraine
thy seely fathers heart?
As in his age to see
thee plonged deep in vice:
When greatest hope he has to hear
thy virtues fame arise.
What shall thy kinsmen think,
thou cause of all their ruthe?
Thy dedly foes do laugh to skorne
thy ill employed youth.
Wherefore my counsel is,
that thou henceforth begin
To know and fly the error which
to long thou liuedst in.
Remove the veale of love,
that keeps thine eyes so blind:
That thou ne can the ready path
of thy forefathers find.
But if unto thy will
so much in thrall thou art:
Yet in some other place bestow
thy witles wandering heart.
Choose out some worthy dame,
her honor thou and serve,
Who will give ear to thy complaint
and pity ere thou sterue.
But sow no more thy pains
in such a barrayne soil:
As yeldes in harvest time no crop
in recompense of toil.
Ere long the townishe dames
together will resort:
Some one of bewty, favor, shape,
and of so lovely port:
With so fast fixed eye,
perhaps thou may behold:
That thou shall quite forget thy love,
and passions past of old.
The young man's lystning ear
receiude the wholesome sound,
And reasons truth yplanted so,
within his head had ground:
That now with healthy cool
ytempred is the heat:
And piecemeale wears away the grief
that erst his heart did freate.
To his approved friend,
a solemn oath he plight:
At every feast ykept by day,
and banquet made by night:
At pardons in the church,
at games in open streate:
And every where he would resort
where Ladies wont to meet.
Eke should his savage heart
like all indifferently:
For he would view and judge them all
with vnallured eye.
How happy had he been.
had he not been forsworn:
But twyse as happy had he been
had he been never borne.
For ere the Moon could thryse
her wasted horns renew,
False Fortune cast for him poor wretch,
a myschiefe new to brewe.
The weary winter nights
restore the Christmas games:
And now the season does inuit
to banquet townish dames.
And first in Capels house,
the chief of all the kyn:
Sparth for no cost, the wonted use
of banquets to begin.
No Lady fair or foul,
was in Verona town:
No knight or gentleman
of high or low renown:
But Capilet himself
has bid unto his feast:
Or by his name in paper sent,
appointed as a geast.
Young damsels thither flock,
of bachelors a rowte:
Not so much for the banquets sake,
as bewties to search out.
But not a Montagew
would enter at his gate:
For as you heard, the Capilets,
and they were at debate.
Save Romeus, and he.
in mask with hidden face:
The supper done, with other five
did prease into the place.
When they had maskd a while,
with dames in courtly wise:
All did unmask, the rest did show
them to their ladies eyes.
But bashful Romeus,
with shamefast face forsook
The open prease, and him withdrew
into the chambers nooke.
But brighter then the sun,
the waxen torches shone:
That mauger what he could, he was
espyd of every one.
But of the women chief,
their gasing eyes that threw
To wonder at his sightly shape
and bewties spotles hew.
With which the heavens him had
and nature so bedect:
That Ladies thought the fairest dames
were foul in his respect.
And in their head beside,
an other wonder rose,
How he durst put himself in throng
among so many foes.
Of courage stout they thought
his cumming to proceed:
And women love an hardy heart
as I in stories read.
The Capilets disdain
the presence of their foe:
Yet they suppress their ^^yrred ire,
the cause I do not know.
Perhaps toffend their gestes
the courteous knights are loath,
Perhaps they stay from sharp revenge,
dreadyng the Princes wroth.
Perhaps for that they shamd
to exercise their rage:
Within their house, against one alone
and him of tender age.
They use no taunting talk,
ne harm him by their deed:
They neither say, what makst thou here,
ne yet they say God speed.
So that he freely might
the Ladies view at ease:
And they also behelding him,
their change of fancies please.
Which nature had him taught
to do with such a grace,
That there was none but ioyed at
his being there in place.
With upright beam he wayd
the bewty of each dame,
And iudgd who best, and who next her,
was wrought in natures frame.
At length he saw a maid,
right fair of perfect shape:
Which Theseus, or Paris would
have chosen to their rape.
Whom erst he never saw,
of all she pleased him most:
Within himself he said to her,
thou justly may thee boste.
Of perfect shapes renoune,
and Beauties sounding praise:
Whose like ne has, ne shall be seen,
ne lives in our days.
And whilst he fixd on her
his part all perced eye,
His former love, for which of ^ate
he ready was to dye.
Is now as quite forgotte,
as it had never been:
The proverb says vnminded often
are they that are unseen.
And as out of a planke
a nail a nail does drive:
So novel love out of the mind
the ancient loved does riue.
This sudden kindled fire
in time is wox so great:
That only death, and both their bloods
might quench the fiery heat.
When Romeus saw himself
in this new tempest tossed:
Where both was hope of pleasant port,
and danger to be lost:
He doubtefull, skasely knew
what countenance to keep
In Lethies flood his wonted flames
were quenchd and drenched deep.
Yea he forgets himself,
ne is the wretch so bold
To ask her name, that without force
has him in bondage fold.
Ne how tunloose his bonds
does the poor fool devise,
But only seeks by her sight
to feed his houngry eyes.
Through them he swalloweth down
loves sweet empoysonde bait,
How ^encly are the ware^es wrapped
by those that lie in wait?
(...) is the poison spread
throughout his bones and veins:
That in a while (alas the while)
it hastes deadly pains.
Whilst Juliet (for so
this gentle damsel hight)
From side to side on every one
did cast about her sight:
At last her flo^ing eyes
were ancored fast on him,
Who for her sake did banishe health
and fredome from each limme.
He in her sight did seem
to pass the rest as far
As Phoebus shining beams do pass
the brightness of a star.
In wait lay warlike love
with golden bow and shaft,
And to his ear with steady hand
the bowstring up he raft.
Till now she had escapde
his sharp inflaming darte:
Till now he listed not assault
her young and tender heart.
His whetted arrow loosde,
so touchd her to the quick:
That through the eye it struck the heart,
and there the hedde did stick.
It booted not to strive,
for why, she wanted strength:
The weaker aye unto the strong
of force must yield at length.
The pomps now of the feast
her heart gyns to despise:
And only ioyeth when her eyes
meet with her lovers eyes.
When their new smitten hearts
had fed on loving gleames:
Whilst passing too and fro* their eyes
ymingled were their beams*
Each of these lovers began
by others looks to know:
That friendship in their breast had root,
and both would have it grow.
When thus in both their hearts
had Cupide made his breach:
And each of them had sought the mean
to end the war by speech.
Dame Fortune did assent
their purpose to advance:
With torche in hand a comely knight
did fetch her forth to dance.
She quit her self so well,
and with so trim a grace:
That she the chief praise wan that night
from all Verona race.
The whilst our Romeus,
a place had warely won:
Nigh to the seat where she must sit,
the dance once being done.
Fair Juliet turned to,
her chair with pleasant cheer:
And glad she was her Romeus
approached was so near.
At the one side of her chair*
her lover Romeo:
And on the other side there sat
one called Mercutio.
A courtier that each where
was highly had in price:
For he was coorteous of his speech,
and pleasant of devise.
Even as a Lion would
among the lambs be bold:
Such was among the bashful maids,
Mercutio to behold.
With friendly gripe he ceasd
fair Iuliets snowith hand:
A gift he had that nature gave
him in his swathing band.
That frosen mountain yse
was never half so cold
As were his hands, though nere so near
the fire he did them hold.
As soon as had the knight
the vyrgins right hand raught:
Within his trembling hand her left
has loving Romeus caught.
For he wist well himself
for her abode most pain:
And well he wist she loved him best,
unless she list to feign.
Then she with tender hand
his tender palm has pressed:
What joy trow you was graffed so
in Romeus cloven breast?
The soodain sweet delight
has stopped quite his tongue:
Ne can he claim of her his right,
ne crave redress of wrong.
But she espyd straight way
by changing o^ his hew
From pale to red, from red to pale,
and so from pale anewe:
That vehment love was cause,
why so his tongue did stay:
And so much more she longde to hear
what love could teach him say.
When she had longed long,
and he long held his peace,
And her desire of hearing him,
by silence did increase.
At last with trembling voice
and shamefast chere, the maid
Unto her Romeus tournde her self,
and thus to him she said.
O blessed be the time
of thy arrival here:
But ere she could speak forth the rest,
to her love drew so nere:
And so within her mouth,
her tongue he glewed fast,
That no one word could escape her more,
then what already past.
In great contented ease
the young man straight is rapt,
What chance (quod he) unware to me
O lady mine is hapt?
That geues you worthy cause,
my cumming here to bliss:
Fair Juliet was come again
unto her self by this.
First ruthfully she lookd,
then said with smylyng cheer:
Marvel no whit my hearts delight,
my only knight and fere.
Mercutious ysy hand
had all to frosen mine
And of thy goodness thou again
have warmed it with thine.
Whereto with stayed brow,
gau Romeus to replye
If so the gods have granted me,
such favor from the sky,
That by my being here,
some service I have done
That pleases you I am as glad,
as I a realm had won,
O well bestowed time.
that has the happy hyre,
Which I would wysh if I might have,
my wished hearts desire.
For I of God would crave,
as pryse of pains forpast.
To serve, obey and honor you,
so long as life shall last.
As proof shall teach you plain,
if that you like to try
His faltles truth, that nill for ought,
unto his lady lie.
But if my tooched hand,
have warmed yours some dele
Assure your self the heat is cold,
which in your hand you feel.
Compard to such quick sparks
and glowing furious gleade
As from your bewties pleasant ^yne,
love caused to proceade.
Which have so set on fire,
each feling part of mine.
That lo, my mind does melt away:
my vtwerd parts do pyne.
And but you help all whole,
to ashes shall I toorne:
Wherefore (alas) have ruth on him,
whom you do force to boorne.
Even with his ended tale,
the torches dance had end,
And Juliet of force must part
from her new chosen friend.
His hand she clasped hard,
and all her parts did shake:
When lay sureles with whispring voice
thus did she answer make.
You are no more your own
(dear friend) then I am yours
(My honor saved) pressed tobay
your will, while life endures*
Lo here the lucky lot
that sild true lovers find:
Each takes away the others heart,
and leaves the own behind.
A happy life is love
if God grant from above,
That heart with heart by even weight
do make exchange of love.
But Romeus gone from her,
his heart for care is cold:
He has forgot to ask her name
that has his heart in hold.
With forged careless cheer,
of one he seeks to know,
Both how she hight, and whence she camme,
that him enchaunted so.
So has he learnd her name,
and knowth she is no geast.
Her father was a Capilet,
and master of the feast.
Thus has his foe in choice
to give him life or death:
That scarsely can his woeful breast
keep in the lively breath.
Wherefore with piteous plaint
feerce Fortune does he blame:
That in his ruth and wretched plight
does seek her laughing game.
And he reproves love,
chief cause of his unrest:
Who ease and freedom has exilde
out of his youthful breast.
Twyse has he made him serve,
hopeles of his reward:
Of both the ylles to choose the less,
I ween the choice were hard*
First to a ruthlesse one
he made him sue for grace:
And now with spur he forces him
to run an endless race.
Amyd these stormy seas
one ancor does him hold,
He serves not a cruel one,
as he had done of old.
And therefore is content,
and chooses still to serve:
Though hap should swear that guerdonles
the wretched wight should sterue.
The lot of Tantalus
is Romeus like to thine
For want of food amid his food,
the myser still does pine.
As careful was the maid
what way were best devise
To learn his name, that intertaind
her in so gentle wise.
Of whom her heart received
so deep, so wide a wound,
An ancient dame she calde to her,
and in her ear began round.
This old dame in her youth,
had nursed her with her milk,
With slender nedle taught her sow,
and how to spin with silk,
What twain are those (quoth she)
which prease unto the door,
Whose pages in their hand do bear,
two toorches light before.
And then as each of them
had of his household name,
So she him namde yet once again
the young and wyly dame.
And tell me who is he
with vysor in his hand
That yender does in masking weed
beside the window stand.
His name is Romeus
(said she) a Montegewe.
Whose fathers pride first styrd the strife
which both your housholdes rewe.
The word of Montegew,
her joys did overthrow,
And straight in stead of happy hope,
dyspayre began to grow.
What hap have I quoth she,
to love my fathers foe?
What, am I weary of my well?
what, do I wish my woe?
But though her grievous pains
distraind her tender heart,
Yet with an outward show of joy
she cloked inward smart.
And of the courtlyke dames
her leave so courtly took,
That none did guess the sudden change
by changing of her look.
Then at her mothers hest
to chamber she^her hyde
So well she faynde, mother ne nurce.
the hidden harm descride.
But when she should have slept
as wont she was, in bed,
Not half a wink of quiet sleep
could harber in her head*
For lo, an hugy heap
of diverse thoughts arise
That rest have banished from her heart,
and slumber from her eyes.
And now from side to side
she tosseth and she turns,
And now for fear she sheuereth,
and now for love she burns.
And now she lykes her choice,
and now her choice she blames,
And now each hour within her head,
a thousand fancies frames
Sometime in mind to stop,
amyd her course begone
Sometime she vows what so betyde,
that tempted race to run.
Thus dangers dred and love,
within the maiden fought,
The fight was feerce continuyng long
by their contrary thought.
In tourning mase of love
she wandreth too and fro,
Then stands doutfull what to do,
last ouerprest with woe.
How so her fancies cease,
her tears did never blyn,
With heavy cheer and wringed hands,
thus does her plaint begin.
Ah sily fool quoth she)
ycought in soottill snare:
Ah wretched wench bewrapt in woe,
an caytife clad with care.
Whence come these wandering thoughts
to thy unconstant breast?
By straying thus from raysons lore,
that reave thy wonted rest.
What if his suttell brain,
to feign have taught his tongue?
And so the snake that lurkes in grass,
thy tender heart has stong?
What if with friendly speech
the traitor lie in wait?
As often the poysond hook is hid,
wrapped in the pleasant bayte?
Often under cloak of truth,
has falsehood served her lust:
And toornd their honor into shame,
that did so slightly trust.
What, was not Dido so,
a crouned Queen: defamd?
And eke for such an heinous crime,
have men not Theseus blamd?
A thousand stories more,
to teach me to beware:
In Boccace, and in Ouids books
too plainly written are.
Perhaps the great revenge
he cannot work by strength:
By suttel slight (my honor staynde)
he hopes to work at length.
So shall I seek to find
my fathers foe his game:
So I befylde, report shall take
her trompe of black defame.
Whence she with puffed cheek
shall blow a blast so shrill
Of my disprayse, that with the noise
Verona shall she still.
Then I a laughing stock
through all the town becomme:
Shall hide my self, but not my shame,
within an hollow toombe.
Straight underneath her foot,
she treads in the dust
Her troublesome thought as wholly vain,
ybred of fond distrust.
No no by God above,
I wot it well quoth she,
Although I rashely spoke before,
in no wise can it be.
That where such perfet shape,
with pleasant bewty restes:
There crooked craft and trayson black,
should be appointed gestes.
Sage writers say, the thoughts
are dwelling in the eyne:
Then sure I am as Cupid reigns
that Romeus is mine.
The tongue the messenger,
eke call they of the mind:
So that I see he loves me,
shall I then be unkind?
His faces rosy hew,
I saw full often to seek:
And straight again it flashed forth,
and spread in either cheek.
His fyred heavenly ^yne,
that through me quite did perce
His thoughts unto my heart, my thought
they seemed to rehearce.
What meant his foltring tunge,
in telling of his tale:
The trembling of his joints and eke
his cooller waxen pale?
And whilst I take with him,
him self he has exylde,
Out of him self (as seemed me)
ne was I sure begylde.
Those arguments of love,
craft wrate not in his face
But natures hand when all deceyte*
was banishd out of place
What other certain signs
seek I of his good will?
These do suffice, and steadfast I
will love and serve him still.
Till Attropos shall cut,
my fatal thread of life,
So that he mind to make of me
his lawful wedded wife.
For so perchance this new
aliance may procure
Unto our houses such a peace
as ever shall endure
Oh how we can persuade,
our self to what we like
And how we can diswade our mind,
if ought our mind mis^yke.
Weak arguments are strong,
our fancies straight to frame,
To pleasing things, and eke to shonne,
if we mislike the same.
The maid had scarsely yet
ended the weary war,
Kept in her heart by striving thoughts
when every shining star
Had paid his borrowed light,
and Phoebus spread in skies
His golden rays, which seemd to say:
now time it is to rise.
And Romeus had by this
forsaken his weary bed:
Where restles he a thousand thoughts
had forged in his head.
And while with lingering step
by Iuliets house he past:
And upward to her windows high
his gredy eyes did cast:
His love that looked for him,
there began he straight epsy,
With pleasant cheer each greeted is,
she follows with her eye
His parting steps, and he
often looks back again:
But not so often as he desires,
warely he does refrain.
What life were like to love,
if dred of ieopardy,
Ysowred not the sweet, if love
were free from ielosy.
But she more sure within,
unseen of any wight,
When so he comes, looks after him,
till he be out of sight.
In often passing so,
his busy eyes he threw,
That every pane and tooting hole
the wily lover knew.
In happy hour he does
a garden plot espy:
From which except he warely walk,
men may his love descrye.
For lo, it fronted full,
upon her leaning place:
Where she is wont to show her heart
by cheerful friendly face.
And lest the arbors might
their secret love bewraye:
He does keep back his forward foot
from passing there by day.
But when on earth the night
her mantel black has spread:
Well armd he walks forth alone,
ne dreadful foes does dred.
Whom makes love not bold,
nay whom makes he not blind?
He reueth dangers dread often times
out of the loves mind.
By night he passes here,
a week or two in vain:
And for the missing of his mark.
his grief has him nigh slain.
And Juliet that now
both lack her hearts relief:
Her Romeus pleasant eyes (I meene)
is almost dead for grief.
Each day she changes hours,
(for lovers keep an hour)
When they are sure to see their love
in passing by their hour.
Impacient of her woe,
she hapt to lean one night
Within her window, and anon
the Moon did shine so bright.
That she espyde her love,
her heart revived, sprang,
And now for joy she clappes her hands,
which erst for woe she wrang.
Eke Romeus when he saw
his long desired sight:
His moorning cloak of moan cast of,
has clad him with delight.
Yet dare I say, of both,
that she rejoiced more:
His care was great, hers twice as great,
was all the time before:
For whilst she knew not why
he did himself absent:
Ay douting both his health and life,
his death she did lament.
For love is fearful often,
where is no cause of fear:
And what love fears, that love laments,
as though it chanced wear.
Of greater cause always
is greater work ybred:
While he naught douteth of her health,
she dreads lest he be ded.
When only absence is
the cause of Romeus smart:
By happy hope of sight again
he feeds his faynting heart.
What wonder then if he
were wrapped in less annoye?
What marvel if by sudden sight
she fed of greater joy?
His smaller grief or joy,
no smaller love do prove:
He for she passed him in both,
did she him pass in love.
But each of them alike
did burn in equal flame:
The welbelouing knight, and eke
the well-beloved dame.
How whilst with bitter tears
her eyes as fountaynes run:
With whispering voice ybroke with sobs,
thus is her tale begone.
Oh Romeus (of your life)
too lauas sure yon are:
That in this place, and at this time
to hasard it you dare.
What if your dedly foes
my kynsmen, saw you here?
Like Lions wild, your tender parts
asonder would they tear.
In ruth and in disdain,
I weary of my life:
With cruel hand my moorning heart
would perce with bloody knyfe.
For you mine own once dead,
what joy should I have hear?
And eke my honor staynde which I
then life do hold more dear.
Fair lady mine dame Juliet
my life (quod he)
Even from my birth committed was
to fatal sisters three.
They may in spyte of foes,
draw forth my lively thread:
And they also, who so says nay,
a sonder may it shreed.
But who to reaue my life,
his rage and force would bend:
Perhaps should try unto his pain
how I it could defend.
Ne yet I love it so,
but always for your sake,
A sacrifice to death I would
my wounded corpse betake.
If my mishappe were such,
that here before your sight,
I should restore again to death,
of life my borowde light:
This one thing and no more
my parting sprite would rewe:
That part he should, before that you
by certain trial knew
The love I owe to you,
the thrall I languish in:
And how I dread to loose the gain
which I do hope to win.
And how I wish for life,
not for my propre ease:
But that in it, you might I love,
you honor, serve and please.
Till dedly pangs the sprite
out of the corpse shall send:
And thereupon he swear an oath,
and so his tale had end.
Now love and pity boil,
in Iuliets ruthful breast,
In window on her leaning arm,
her weary head does rest.
Her bosom bathd in tears,
to witness inward pain:
With dreary chere to Romeus,
thus aunswerd she again.
Ah my dear Romeus,
keep in these words (quod she)
For lo, the thought of such mischaunce,
already makes me
For pity and for dred,
welnigh to yield up breath:
In even balance paysed are
my life and eke my death.
For so my heart is knitte,
yea, made one self with yours:
That sure there is no grief so small,
by which your mind endures.
But as you suffer pain,
so I do bear in part:
(Although it lessens not your grief)
the half of all your smart.
But these things ouerpast,
if of your health and mine
You have respect, or pity ought
my teary weping eyes:
In few unfeigned words,
your hidden mind unfold,
That as I see your pleasant face,
your heart I may behold.
For if you do intend
my honor to defile:
In error shall you wander still
as you have done this while,
But if your thought be chaste,
and have on virtue ground,
If wedlock be the end and mark
which your desire has found:
Obedience set aside,
unto my parents dew:
The quarrel eke that long ago
between our housholdes grew:
Both me and mine I will
all whole to you betake:
And following you where so you go,
my fathers house forsake.
But if by wanton love,
and by unlawful suit.
You think in ripest years to pluck
my maydenhods dainty fruit:
You are begylde, and now
your Juliet you be seeks
To cease your suit, and suffer her
to live among her likes.
Then Romeus, whose thought
was free from foul desire:
And to the top of virtues haight,
did worthily aspyre:
Was filled with greater joy
then can my pen express:
Or till they have enjoyed the like
the hearers heart can guess.
And then with joined hands
heaud up into the skies:
He thanks the Gods, and from the heavens
for vengeance down he cries.
If he have other thought,
but as his lady spoke:
And then his look he toornd to her,
and thus did answer make.
Since Lady that you like
to honor me so much,
As to accept me for your spouse,
I yield my self for such.
In true witness whereof,
because I must depart,
Till that my deed do prove my word,
I leave in pawn my heart.
To morrow eke betimes.
before the sun arise:
To friar Lawrence will I wend,
to learn his sage advise.
He is my gostly sire,
and often he has me taught
What I should do in things of wayght,
when I his aid have sought.
And at this self same hour,
I plyte you here my faith:
I will be here (if you think good)
to tell you what he says.
She was contented well,
else favor found he none,
That night at lady Iuliets hand,
save pleasant words alone.
This barefoote friar gyrt,
with cord his grayish weed,
For he of Frauncis order was,
a friar as I reed,
Not as the most was he,
a gross unlearned fool:
But doctor of divinity
proceeded he in school.
The secrets eke he knew,
in natures works that loorke:
By magiks art most men supposd
that he could wonders work.
Ne does it ill beseem
deuines those skils to know:
If on no harmefull deed they do
such skilfulnes bestow.
For justly of no art
can men condemn the use:
But right and reasons lore cry out
against the lewd abuse.
The bounty of the friar
and wisdom has so won
The towns folks herts, that welnigh all
to friar Lawrence tonne.
To shriue them self the old,
the young, the great and small:
Of all he is beloved well,
and honored much of all.
And for he did the rest
in wisdom far exceed:
The prince by him (his counsel craude)
was help at time of need.
Betwixt the Capilets
and him great friendship grew:
A secret and assured friend
unto the Montegue.
Loved of this young man more
then any other gest,
The friar eke of Verone youth,
aye liked Romeus best.
For whom he ever has
in time of his distres:
(As erst you heard) by skillful lore,
found out his harms redress.
To him is Romeus gonne,
ne stayth he till the morrow:
To him he paynteth all his case,
his passed joy and sorrow.
How he has her espyde
with other dames in dance,
And how that first to talk with her,
himself he did advance.
Their talk and change of looks
he began to him declare:
And how so fast by faith and troth
they both ycoupled are.
That neither hope of life,
nor dreed of cruel death,
Shall make him false his faith to her
while life shall lend him breath.
And then with weping eyes
he prays his gostly sire
To further and accomplish all
their honest hearts desire.
A thousand doutes and more
in thold man's head arose:
A thousand dangers like to come,
the old man does disclose.
And from the spousall rites
he reads him refrain:
Perhaps he shall be bet aduisde
within a week or twain.
Advise is banishd quite
from those that follow love,
Except advise to what they like
their bending mind do move.
As well the father might
have counseld him to stay
That from a mountains top thrown down,
is falling half the way:
As warn his friend to stop,
amyd his race begone,
Whom Cupid with his smarting whip
enforces forth to run.
Part won by earnest suit,
the friar does grant at last:
And part, because he thinks the storms
so lately ouerpast,
Of both the housholdes wrath:
this marriage might apease,
So that they should not rage again,
but quite for ever cease.
The respite of a day,
he asks to deuyse:
What way were best unknown to end
so great an enterprise.
The wounded man that now
does dedly pains endure:
Scarce pacient tarieth whilst his leeche
does make the salve to cure.
So Romeus hardly graunts
a short day and a night,
Yet needs he must, else must he want
his only hearts delight.
You see that Romeus
no time or pain does spare:
Think that the whilst fair Juliet
is not deuoyde of care.
Young Romeus powers forth
his hap and his mishap,
Into the friars breast, but where
shall Juliet unwrap
The secrets of her heart?
to whom shall she unfold,
Her hidden burning love, and eke
her thought and cares so cold.
The nurce of whom I spoke
within her chaumber lay:
Upon the maid she wayteth still,
to her she does bewray
Her new received wound,
and then her aid does crave:
In her she says it lies to spill,
in her her life to save.
Not easily she made
the froward nurce to bow:
But won at length, with promest hyre
she made a solemn vow.
To do what she commaundes,
as handmayd of her hest:
Her mistres secrets hide she will,
within her covert breast.
To Romeus she goes
of him she does desire,
To know the mean of marriage
by council of the fryre.
On Saturday quod he,
if Juliet come to shrift,
She shall be shriued and married,
how like you noorse this drist?
Now by my truth (quod she)
gods blessing have your heart:
For yet in all my life I have
not heard of such a part.
Lord how you young men can
such crafty wiles devise,
If that you love the daughter well
to bleare the mothers eyes.
An easy thing it is,
with cloak of holiness,
To mock the sely mother that
suspecteth nothing less
But that it pleased you
to tell me of the case.
For all my many years perhaps,
I should have found it scarce.
Now for the rest let me
and Juliet alone:
To get her leave, some feate excuse
I will devise anon.
For that her golden locks
by sloth have been unkempt:
Or for unawares some wanton dream
the youthful damsel drempt,
Or for in thoughts of love
her ydel time she spent:
Or otherwise within her heart
deserved to be shent.
I know her mother will
in no case say her nay:
I warrant you she shall not fail
to come on Saturday.
And then she swears to him,
the mother loves her well:
And how she gave her suck in youth
she leaves not to tell.
A pretty babe (quod she)
it was when it was young:
Lord how it could full pretely
have prated with it tongue.
A thousand times and more
I said her on my lap,
And clapped her on the buttocke soft
and kissed where I did clappe.
And gladder then was I
of such a kiss forsooth:
Then I had been to have a kiss
of some old lechers mouth.
And thus of Iuliets youth
began this prating noorse,
And of her present state to make
a tedious long discoorse.
For though he pleasure took
in hearing of his love:
The message answer seemed him
to be of more behoue.
But when these Beldams sit
at ease upon their tail:
The day and eke the candle light
before their talk shall fail.
And part they say is true,
and part they do devise:
Yet boldly do they that of both
when no man checkes their lies.
Then he.vi. crowns of gold
out of his pocket drew:
And gave them her, a slight reward
(quod he) and so adieu.
In seven years twice told
she had not bowd so low,
Her crooked knees, as now they bow,
she swears she will bestow.
Her crafty wit, her time,
and all her busy pain,
To help him to his hoped bliss,
and cowring down again:
She takes her leave, and home
she hyes with spedy pace:
The chaumber door she shuts, and then
she says with smyling face.
Good news for thee my gyrle,
good tidinges I thee bring:
Leave of thy woonted song of care
and now of pleasure sing.
For thou may hold thy self
the happiest under son:
That in so little while, so well
so worthy a knight have won.
The best yshapde is he,
and has the fairest face,
Of all this town, and there is none
has half so good a grace.
So gentle of his speech,
and of his counsel wise:
And still with many praises more
she heaued him to the skies.
Tell me else what (quod she)
this evermore I thought:
But of our marriage say at once,
what answer have you brought?
Nay soft quoth she, I fear,
your hurt by sudden joy:
I list not play quoth Juliet,
although thou list to toye.
How glad trow you was she,
when she had heard her say:
No farther of then Saturday,
differred was the day.
Again the ancient nurce
does speak of Romeus,
And then (said she) he spoke to me,
and then I spoke him thus.
Nothing was done or said,
that she has left untold,
Save only one, that she forgot
the taking of the gold.
There is no loss quod she,
(sweet wench) to loss of time:
Ne in thine age shall thou repent
so much of any crime.
For when I call to mind,
my former passed youth:
One thing there is which most of all
does cause my endless ruth.
At sixtene years I first
did choose my loving feere:
And I was fully ripe before,
(I dare well say) a year.
The pleasure that I lost.
that year so ouerpast:
A thousand times I have be wept,
and shall while life does last.
In faith it were a shame,
yea sin it were ywisse,
When thou may live in happy joy
to set light by thy bliss.
She that this morning could
her mistres mind dissuade,
Is now becomme an Dratresse,
her lady to persuade.
If any man be here
whom love has clad with care:
To him I speak, if thou will speed,
thy purse thou must not spare.
Two sorts of men there are,
seeld welcome in at door:
The welthy sparing nigard, and
the suitor that is poor.
For glittring gold is wont
by kind to move the heart:
And often times a slight reward
does cause a more desert.
Ywritten have I red,
I wot not in what book:
There is no better way to fish,
then with a golden hook.
Of Romeus these two,
do sit and chat a while,
And to them self they laugh, how they
the mother shall begyle.
A feate excuse they find,
but sure I know it not:
And leave for her to go to shrift
on Saturday she got.
So well this Juliet,
this wyly wench did know
Her mothers angry hours, and eke
the true bent of her bow.
The Saturday betimes
in sober weed yelad,
She took her leave, and forth she went
with visage grave and sad.
With her the nurce is sent
as bridle of her lust:
With her the mother sendes a maid,
almost of equal trust.
Betwixt her teeth the bytte,
the Ienet now has cought:
So warely eke the vyrgin walks
her maid perceives naught.
She gaseth not in church,
on young men of the town:
Ne wandreth she from place to place,
but straight she kneleth down
Upon an alters step,
where she devoutly prays:
And there upon her tender knees
the weary lady stays:
Whilst she does send her maid
the certain truth to know,
If friar Lawrence laysure had,
to hear her shrift, or no.
Out of his shriuing place
he commes with pleasant cheer:
The shamefast maid with bashful brow
to himward draws near.
Some great offense (quod he)
you have committed late:
Perhaps you have displeasd your friend,
by giving him a mate.
Then turning to the nurce,
and to the other maid:
Go hear a mass or two quod be,
which straight way shall be said.
For her confession heard,
I will unto you twain
The charge that I receiud of you,
restore to you again.
What, was not Juliet
trow you right well apayde?
That for this trusty fryre has chaungde
her young mistrusting maid?
I dare well say there is
in all Verona none:
But Romeus, with whom she would
so gladly be alone.
Thus to the friars cell,
they both forth walked bin:
He shuts the door as soon as he
and Juliet were in.
But Romeus her friend
was entered in before:
And there had waited for his love,
two hours large and more.
Each minute seemde an hour,
and every hour a day:
Twixt hope he lived and despair,
of cumming or of stay.
Now wavering hope and fear,
are quite fled out of sight.
For what he hopde he has at hand
his pleasant chief delight.
And joyful Juliet
is healde of all her smart:
For now the rest of all her parts,
have found her straying heart.
Both their confessions first
the friar has heard them make:
And then to her with louder voice
thus friar Lawrence spoke.
Fair lady Juliet
my gostly daughter dear:
As far as I of Romeus learn
who by you stands here:
Twixt you it is agreed
that you shall be his wife:
And he your spouse in steady truth
till death shall end your life.
Are you both fully bent
to keep this great behest?
And both the lovers said it was
their only hearts request.
When he did see their minds
in linkes of love so fast:
When in the praise of wedlocks state
sum skillful talk was past.
When he had told at length
the wife what was her due:
His duty eke by gostly talk
the youthful husband knew.
How that the wife in love
must honor and obey:
What love and honor he does owe,
and debt that he must pay.
The words pronounced were
which holy church of old
Appointed has for marriage:
and she a ring of gold
Received of Romeus:
and then they both arose.
To whom the friar then said, perchance
a part you will disclose
Betwixt your self alone
the bottom of your heart:
Say on at once, for time it is
that hence you should depart.
Then Romeus said to her,
(both loath to part so soon:)
Fair lady send to me again
your nurce this after noone.
Of cord I will bespeake,
a ladder by that time:
By which, this night, while other sleep,
I will your window clime.
Then will we talk of love,
and of our old dispayres:
And then with longer laysure had,
dispose our great affairs.
These said, they kiss, and then
part to their fathers house:
The joyful bryde unto her home,
to his eke goth the spouse.
Contented both, and yet
both discontented still:
Till night and Venus child, give leave
the wedding to fulfill.
The painful soldier sore
ybet with weary war:
The merchant eke that needful things
does dred to fetch from far:
The plowman that for doubt
of feerce inuading foes,
Rather to sit in idle ease
then sow his tilt has chose:
Rejoice to hear proclaymd
the tydinges of the peace:
Not pleasurd with the sound so much:
but when the wars do cease.
Then ceased are the harms
which cruel war bringes forth.
The merchant then may boldly fetch,
his wares of precious worth.
Dredelesse the husband man
does till his fertile feeld:
For wealth her mate, not for her self,
is peace so precious held.
So lovers live in care,
in dread, and in unrest:
And dedly war by striving thoughts
they keep within their breast.
But wedlock is the peace
whereby is freedom won,
To do a thousand pleasant things
that should not else be done.
The news of ended war
these two have hard with joy:
But now they long the fruit of peace
with pleasure to enjoy.
In stormy wind and wave,
in danger to be lost:
Thy stearles ship (O Romeus)
has been long while betost.
The seas are now appeasd,
and thou by happy star
Art comme in sight of quiet haven:
and now the wrackfull bar
Is hid with swelling tide,
boldly thou may resort
Unto thy wedded ladies bed,
thy long desired port.
God grant no follies mist
so dymme thy inward sight,
That thou do miss the channel, that
does lead to thy delight.
God grant no dangers rock
ylurking in the dark
Before thou win the happy port
wrack thy sea beaten bark.
A servant Romeus had,
of word and deed so just:
That with his life (if need requierd)
his master would him trust,
His faithfulness had often
our Romeus proved of old
And therefore all that yet was done
unto his man he told.
Who straight as he was charged,
a corden ladder looks:
To which he has made fast two strong
and crooked iron hooks.
The bryde to send the nurce
at twylight fails not:
To whom the bridegroom yeuen has.
the ladder that he got.
And then to watch for him
appoints her an hour:
For whether Fortune smyle on him,
or if she list to lowre,
He will not miss to comme
to his appointed place,
Where wont he was to take by stelth
the view of Iuliets face.
How long these lovers thought
the lasting of the day,
Let other judge that woonted are
like passions to assay.
For my part, I do guess
each hour seems twenty year:
So that I deem if they might have
(as of Alcume we hear)
The sun bond to their will,
if they the heavens might gyde:
Black shade of night and doubled dark
should straight all oner hyde.
Thappointed hour is comme,
he clad in rich array,
Walks toward his desired home,
good Fortune gyde his way.
Approaching nere the place
from whence his heart had lffe:
So light he worcester, he lept the wall,
and there he spyde his wife.
Who in the window watched
the cumming of her lord:
Where she so surely had made fast
the ladder made of cord:
That daungerles her spouse
the chaumber window climes,
Where he ere then had wished himself
above ten thousand times.
The windows close are shut,
else look they for no gest,
To light the waxen quariers,
the ancient nurce is pressed,
Which Juliet had before
prepared to be light,
That she at pleasure might behold
her husbands bewty bright.
A Carchef white as snow,
ware Juliet on her head,
Such as she wonted was to wear,
attire meet for the bed.
As soon as she him spyde,
about his neck she clong:
And by her long and slender arms
a great while there she hong.
A thousand times she kissed,
and him vnkist again:
Ne could she speak a word to him
though would she nere so feign.
And like betwixt his arms
to faint his lady is:
She fettes a sigh, and clappeth close
her closed mouth to his.
And ready then to sownde
she looked ruthfully:
That lo, it made him both at once
to live and eke to dye.
These piteous painful panges
were happily ouerpast:
And she unto her self again
returned home at last.
Then through her troubled breast,
even from the farthest part,
An hollow sigh, a messenger
she sends from her heart.
O Romeus quoth she,
in whom all virtues shine:
Welcome thou art into this place
where from these eyes of mine,
Such teary streams did flow,
that I suppose welny
The source of all my bitter tears
is altogether dry.
Absence so pynde my heart,
which on thy presence fed:
And of thy safety and thy health
so much I stood in dred.
But now what is decreed
by fatal desteny:
I force it not, let Fortune do
and death their woorst to me.
Full recompensd am I
for all my passed harms,
In that the Gods have granted me
to claspe thee in mine arms.
The crystal tears began
to stand in Romeus eyes,
When he unto his ladies words
began answer in this wise.
Though cruel Fortune be
so much my dedly foe:
That I ne can by lively proof
cause thee (fair dame) to know
How much I am by love
enthralled unto thee:
Ne yet what mighty power thou have
by thy desert on me.
Ne torments that for thee
I did ere this endure:
Yet of thus much (ne will I feign)
I may thee well assure.
The least of many pains
which of thy absence sprung:
More paynefully then death it self
my tender heart has wroong.
Ere this one death had reft
a thousand deaths away:
But life prolonged was by hope,
of this desired day.
Which so just tribute pays
of all my passed moan:
That I as well contented am,
as if my self alone
Did from the Occean reign
unto the sea of Inde:
Wherefore now let us wipe away
old cares out of our mind.
For as the wretched state
is now redrest at last,
So is it skill behind our back
the cursed care to cast.
Since Fortune of her grace
has place and time assinde
Where we with pleasure may content
our discontented mind.
In Lethes hyde we deep
all grief and all annoy,
Whilst we do bath in bliss, and fill
our hungry hearts with joy.
And for the time to comme,
let be our busy care:
So wisely to direct our love
as no wight else be ware.
Lest enmous foes by force
despoyle our new delight,
And us throw back from happy state
to more unhappy plight.
Fair Juliet began
to answer what he said:
But forth in have the old nurce stepped,
and so her answer stayde.
Who takes not time (quoth she)
when time well offered is,
An other time shall seek for time,
and yet of time shall miss.
And when occasion serves,
who so does let it slip,
Is worthy sure (if I might judge)
of lashes with a whippe.
Wherefore, if each of you
has harmde the other so,
And each of you has been the cause
of others wayled woe,
Lo here a field, (she showed
a fieeldbed ready dight)
Where you may, if you list, in arms,
revenge your self by fight.
Whereto these lovers both
began easily assent,
And to the place of mylde revenge
with pleasant cheer they went.
Where they were left alone,
the nurce is gone to rest:
How can this be? they restles lie,
ne yet they feel unrest.
I grant that I envy
the bliss they lived in:
Oh that I might have found the like.
I wish it for no sin.
But that I might as well
with pen their joys depaynt,
As here to fore I have displayed
their secret hidden playnt.
Of shyuering care and bred,
I have felt many a fit,
But Fortune such delight as theyrs
did never grant me yet.
By proof no certain truth
can I unhappy write:
But what I guess by likelihod,
that dare I to endite.
The blyndfyld goddess that
with frowning face does fraye,
And from their seat the mighty kings
throws down with hedlong sway*
Begins now to turn,
to these her smyling face,
Needs must they taste of great delight,
so much in Fortunes grace.
If Cupid, God of love,
be God of pleasant sport,
I thinck O Romeus Mars himself
enuies thy happy sort.
Ne Venus justly might,
(as I suppose) repent,
If in thy stead (O Juliet)
this pleasant time she spent.
This pass they forth the night
in sport, in ioly game:
The hastines of Phoebus steeds
in great despyte they blame.
And now the virgins fort
has warlike Romeus got,
In which as yet no breach was made
by force of canon shot.
And now in ease he does
possess the hoped place:
How glad was he, speak you that may
your lovers parts embrace?
The marriage thus made up,
and both the parties pleased:
The nigh approach of days retoorne
these seely foles diseasd.
And for they might no while
in pleasure pass their time,
Ne leisure had they much to blame
the hasty mornings crime:
With friendly kiss in arms
of her his leave he takes,
And every oath night to come,
a solemn oath he makes.
By one self mean, and eke
to come at one self hour:
And so he does till Fortune list
to sawse his sweet with sour.
But who is he that can
his present state assure?
And say unto himself, thy joys
shall yet a day endure.
So wavering Fortunes whele
her chaunges be so strange.
And every wight ythralled is
by sat unto her change.
Who reigns so over all,
that each man has his part:
(Although not aye perchance alike)
of pleasure and of smart.
For after many joys,
some feel but little pain:
And from that little grief they toorne
to happy joy again.
But other sum there are,
that living long in woe,
At length they be in quiet ease,
but long abide not so.
Whose grief is much increast
by mirth that went before:
Because the sudden change of things
does make it seem the more.
Of this unlucky sort
our Romeus is one
For all his hap turns to mishap,
and all his mirth to moan.
And joyful Juliet
an other leaf must toorne:
As wont she was (her joys bereft)
she must begin to moorne.
The summer of their bliss,
does last a month or twain:
But winters blast with spedy foot
does bring the fall again.
Whom glorious fortune erst
had heaued to the skies:
By envious fortune overthrown
on earth now groueling lies.
She paid their former grief
with pleasures doubled gain:
But now for pleasures vsery
ten fold redoubleth pain.
The prince could never cause
those households so agree,
But that some sparcles of their wrath,
as yet remaining be.
Which lie this whi eraakd up,
in ashes pale and ded,
Till time do serve that they again
in wasting flame may spread.
At holiest times men say
most heinous crimes are done,
The morrow after Easter day
the mischief new begone.
A band of Capilets
did meet (my heart it rewes)
Within the walls by Pursers gate,
a band of Montagewes.
The Capilets as chief,
a young man have chose out:
Best exercisd in feats of arms,
and noblest of the rowte.
Our Iuliets uncles son
that cliped was Tibalt:
He was of body tall and strong,
and of his courage halt.
They need no trumpet sound
to bid them give the charge,
So loud he cryde with ftrayned voice
and mouth out stretched large.
Now, now, (quod he) my friends,
our self so let us wreake,
That of this days revenge, and us,
our childrens heirs may speak.
Now once for all let us
their swelling pride assuage,
Let none of them escape alive,
then he with furious rage
And they with him gave charge,
upon they present foes,
And then forthwith a skyrmishe great
upon this fray arose.
For lo, the Montagewes
thought shame away to fly,
And rather then to live with shame,
with praise did choose to dye.
The words that Tybalt vsd
to stir his folk to ire,
Have in the breasts of Montegewes
kindled a furious fire.
With Lions hearts they fight,
warely themself defend:
To wound his foe, his present wit
and force each one does bend.
This furious fray is long,
on each side stoutly fought,
That whether part had got the woorst
full doutfull were the thought.
The noise hereof anon,
throughout the town does fly:
And parts are taken on every side.
both kinreds thither hye.
Here one does gasp for breath,
his friend bestrideth him,
And he has lost a hand, and he
another maimed him.
His leg is cut whilst he
strikes at an other full:
And who^ he would have thrust quite through
has cleft his cracked skull.
Their valiant hearts forbode
their foot to give the ground,
With vnappauled cheer they took
full deep and doutfull wound.
Thus foot by foot long while,
and shield to shield set fast:
One foe does make another faint
but makes him not aghast.
And whilst this noise is ryfe
in every towns man's ear,
Eke walking with his friends, the noise
does woeful Romeus hear.
With spedy foot he ronnes
unto the fray apace:
With him those few that were with him
he leads to the place.
They pity much to see
the slaughter made so great:
That wetshod they might stand in blood
on either side the streate.
Part friends (said he) part friends,
help friends to part the fray:
And to the rest, enough (he cries)
now time it is to stay.
Gods farther wrath you stir,
beside the hurt you feel:
And with this new uproar confound
all this our common well.
But they so busy are
in fight so egar and feerce,
That through their ears his sage advise
no leisure had to pearce.
Then lept he in the throng,
to part, and bar the blows,
As well of those that were his friends:
as of his dedly foes.
As soon as Tybalt had
our Romeus espyde:
He threw a thrust at him that would
have past from side to side.
But Romeus ever went
(douting his foes) well armde:
So that the swerd (kept out by mayle)
has nothing Romeus harmde.
Thou do me wrong (quoth he)
for I but part the fraye,
Not dread, but other weighty cause
my hasty hand does stay.
Thou art the chief of thine,
the noblest eke thou art:
Wherefore leave of thy malice now,
and help these folk to part.
Many are hurt, some slain,
and some are like to dye.
No, coward traitor boy (quod he)
straight way I mind to try
Whether thy sugared talk,
and tongue so smootely fylde:
Against the force of this my swerd
shall serve thee for a shylde.
And then at Romeus head,
a blow he struck so hard,
That might have cloue him to the brain
but for his cunning ward.
It was but lent to him
that could repay again:
And give him death for interest,
a well forborne gain.
Right as a forest bore,
that lodged in the thick,
Pinched with dog, or else with spear
ypricked to the quick:
His bristles stiff upright
upon his back does set,
And in his fomy mouth, his sharp
and crooked tuskes does whet.
Or as a Lion wild
that rampeth in his rage,
His whelps bereft, whose fury can
no weaker beast assuage.
Such seemed Romeus,
in every others sight:
When he him shope, of wrong receaude
tauenge himself by fight.
Even as two thunderboltes,
thrown down out of the sky,
That through the air the massy earth
and seas have power to fly:
So met these two, and while
they change a blow or twain,
Our Romeus thrust him through the throat
and so is Tybalt slain.
Lo here the end of those
that stir a dedly strife:
Who thyrsteth after others death,
himself has lost his life.
The Capilets are quaylde,
by Tybalts overthrow:
The courage of the Mountagewes,
by Romeus sight does grow,
The towns men waren strong,
the prince does send his force:
The fray has end, the Capilets
do bring the brethles corce,
Before the prince: and crave,
that cruel dedly pain
May be the guerdon of his falt,
that has their kinsman slain.
The Montagewes do plead,
their Romeus void of falt:
The lookers on do say, the fight
begone was by Tybalt.
The prince does pawse, and then
geues sentence in a while,
That Romeus, for sleying him
should gone into exyle.
His foes would have him hangde,
or sterue in prison strong:
His friends do think (but dare not say)
that Romeus has wrong.
Both households straight are charged
on pain of losing life:
Their bloody weapons laid aside,
to cease the styrred strife.
This common plage is spread,
through all the town anon:
From side to side the town is filled
with murmour and with moan.
For Tybalts hasty death,
bewailed was of sum,
Both for his skill in frates of arms,
and for in time to comme:
He should (had this not chanced)
been rich, and of great power:
To help his friends, and serve the state,
which hope within an hour
Was wasted quite, and he
thus yelding up his breath,
More then he help the town in life,
has harmde it by his death.
And other sum bewail,
(but ladies most of all)
The lookeles lot by Fortunes gylt,
that is so late befall,
(Without his falt,) unto
the seely Romeus,
For whilst that he from native land
shall live exyled thus.
From heavenly bewties light,
and his welshaped parts:
The sight of which, was wont (fair dames)
to glad your youthful hearts.
Shall you be banishd quite:
and till he do retoorne
What hope have you to joy?
what hope to cease to moorne?
This Romeus was borne
so much in heavens grace
Of Fortune, and of nature so
beloved, that in his face
(Beside the heavenly bewty
glistring ay so bright:
And seemly grace, that wontes so
to glad the seers sight.)
A certain charm was graued
by natures secret art:
That virtue had to draw to it,
the love of many a heart.
So every one does wish,
to bear a part of pain:
That he released of exyle,
might straight return again.
But how does moorne among
the moorners Juliet?
How does she bathe her breast in tears?
what deep sighs does she fet?
How does she tear her hear?
her weed how does she rent?
How fares the lover hearing of
her lovers banishment?
How wayles she Libalts death,
whom she had loved so well?
Her hearty grief and piteous plaint,
cunning I want to tell
For deluing depely now
in depth of deep despair:
With wretched sorrows cruel sound
she fills the empty air.
And to the lowest hell,
down falls her heavy cry,
And up unto the heavens haight
her piteous plaint does fly.
The waters and the woods,
of sighs and sobs resounde:
And from the hard resounding rocks
her sorrows do rebounde.
Eke from her teary eyne,
down rayned many a shower:
That in the garden where she walkd
might water herb and flower.
But when at length she saw
her self outraged so:
Unto her chaumber straight she hide
there ouercharged with woe.
Upon her stately bed,
her painful parts she threw:
And in so wondrous wise began
her sorrows to renew:
That sure no heart so hard,
(but it of flint had been:)
But would have rude the pitious plaint
that she did languishe in.
Then rapt out of her self,
whilst she on every side
Did cast her restles eye, at length
the window she espide,
Through which she had with joy
seen Romeus many a time:
Which often the ventrous knight was wont
For Iuliets sake to clyme.
She cryde O cursed window,
a cursed be every pane,
Through which (alas) to one I raught
the cause of life and bane.
If by thy mean I have
some slight delight received,
Or else such fading pleasure as
by Fortune straight was reaued:
Have thou not made me pay
a tribute rigorous?
Of heaped grief, and lasting care:
and sorrows dolorous?
That these my tender parts,
which needful strength do lack,
To bear so great unwieldy lode?
upon so weak a back:
Oppressed with weight of cares
and with these sorrows rife:
At length must open wide to death,
the gates of lothed life.
That so my weary sprite,
may sum where else unload
His dedly lode, and free from thrall
may seek else where abroad:
For pleasant quiet ease,
and for assured rest,
Which I as yet could never find,
but for my more unrest.
O Romeus, when first
we both acquainted were,
When to thy painted promises
I lent my listening ear:
Which to the brinkes you filled
with many a solemn oath,
And I them iudgde empty of gyle,
and fraughted full of troth:
I thought you rather would
continue our good will,
And seek tappease our fathers strife
which daily grows still.
I little wend you would
have sought occasion how
By such an heinous act to break
the peace, and eke your vow
Whereby your bright renoune,
all whole yelipsed is,
And I unhappy husbandles,
of cumfort robde, and bliss.
But if you did so much
the blood of Capels thyrst,
Why have you often spared mine?
mine might have quenched it first.
Since that so many times,
and in so secret place
(Where you were wont with vele of love
to hyde your hatreds face.)
My doutfull life has hapt
by fatal dome to stand,
In mercy of your cruel heart,
and of your bloody hand.
What? seemd the conquest which
you got of me, so small?
What? seemd it not enough that I
poor wretch, was made your thrall?
But that you must increase
it with that kinsmans blood,
Which for his worth and love to me
most in my favor stood?
Well, go henceforth else where,
and seek another while,
Some other as unhappy as I,
by flattry to begyle.
And where I comme, see that
you shonne to show your face:
For your excuse within my heart
shall find no resting place.
And I that now too late
my former fault repent:
Will so the rest of weary life
with many tears lament:
That soon my ioyceles corpse,
shall yield up banishd breath,
And where on earth it restles lived,
in earth seek rest by death.
These said, her tender heart,
by pain oppressed sore:
Restraynd her tears, and forced her tongue
to keep her talk in store.
And then as still she was,
as if in sownd she lay:
And then again, wroth with her self,
with feeble voice began say.
Ah cruel murdering tongue,
murthrer of others fame:
How durst thou once attempt to tooch
the honor of his name?
Whose dedly foes do yield
him dew and earned praise:
For though his fredome be bereft,
his honor not decays.
Why blamst thou Romeus
for sleying of Tybalt,
Since he is gyltles guite of all,
and Tybalt bears the falt?
Whether shall he (alas)
poor banishd man now fly?
What place of succor shall he seek
beneth the starry sky?
Since she pursues him,
and him defames by wrong:
That in distres should be his fort,
and only rampire strong.
Receive the recompense,
O Romeus of thy wife:
Who for she was unkind her self,
does offer up her life.
In flames of ire, in sighs,
in sorrow and in ruth:
So to revenge the crime she did
commit against thy truth.
These said, she could no more,
her senses all began fail:
And dedly panges began straight way
her tender heart assail.
Her limbs she stretched forth,
she drew no more her breath,
Who had been there, might well have seen
the signs of present death.
The nurce that knew no cause,
why she absented her,
Did doubt lest that some sudden grief
too much tormented her.
Each where but where she was
the careful Beldam sought,
Last, of the chamber where she lay,
she happily her bethought.
Where she with piteous eye,
her nurce child did behold:
Her limbs stretched out, her vtward parts
as any marble cold.
The nurce supposde that she
had paid to death her det:
And then as she had lost her wits,
she cried to Juliet.
Ah my dear heart (quoth she)
how greeueth me thy death?
Alas what cause have thou thus soon,
to yield up living breath?
But while she handled her,
and chafed every part,
She knew there was some spark of life
by beating of her heart.
So that a thousand times
she called upon her name,
There is no way to help a trance,
but she has tryde the same.
She opens wide her mouth,
she stops close her nose,
She bends down her breast, she wringes
her fingers and her toes.
And on her bosom cold,
she lays clothes hot,
A warmed and a wholesome juice
she powers down her throat.
At length does Juliet,
heave fayntly up her eyes,
And then she stretches forth her arm,
and then her nurce she spies.
But when she was awakde,
from her unkindly trance:
Why do thou trouble me (quoth she)
what drove thee (with mischaunce)
To come to see my sprite,
forsake my brethles corce?
Go hence, and let me dye, if thou
have on my smart remorse.
For who would see her friend
to live in dedly pain?
Alas, I see my grief begoone,
for ever will remain.
Or who would seek to live,
all pleasure being past?
My mirth is done, my moorning moan
for ay is like to last.
Wherefore since that there is
none other remedy,
Comme gentle death, and ryue my heart,
at once, and let my dye.
The nurce with tricling tears,
to witness inward smart,
With helow sigh fetchd from the depth,
of her appauled heart.
Thus spoke to Juliet,
yelad with eugly care.
Good lady mine, I do not know
what makes you thus to fare.
Ne yet the cause of your
vnmeasurde heaviness.
But of this one I you assure,
for care and sorrows stresse,
This hour large and more,
I thought (so god me save)
That my dead corpse should wait on yours,
to your untimely grave.
Alas my tender nurce,
and trusty friend (quoth she)
Art thou so blind, that with thine eye,
thou can not easily see
The lawful cause I have,
to sorrow and to moorne,
Since those the which I hyld most dear
I have at once forlorn?
Her nurce then aunswerd thus.
Me thinks it sits you ill,
To fall in these extremities
that may you gyltles spill.
For when the storms of care,
and troubles do arise,
Then is the time for men to know,
the foolish from the wise.
You are accounted wise,
a fool am I your nurce:
But I see not how in like case
I could be have me wurse.
Tibalt your friend is ded,
what ween you by your tears,
To call him back again? think you
that he your crying hears?
You shall perceue the falt,
(if it be justly tryde)
Of his so sodayn death, was in
his rashness and his pride.
Would you that Romeus,
him self had wronged so,
To suffer himself causeles to be
outraged of his foe?
To whom in no respect,
he ought a place to give?
Let it suffice to thee fair dame,
that Romeus does live.
And that there is good hope
that he within a while,
With greater glory shall be calde
home from his hard exile.
How well yborne he is,
thy self I know can tell:
By kindred strong, and well alyed,
of all beloved well.
With patience arm thy self,
for though that Fortunes crime
Without your falt, to both your greefes
depart you for a time.
I dare say for amends
of all your present pain
She will restore your own to you,
within a month or twain.
With such contented ease,
as never erst you had:
Wherefore rejoice a while in hope,
and be ne more so sad.
And that I may discharge
your heart of heavy care:
A certain way I have found out,
my pains ne will I spare.
To learn his present state,
and what in time to comme
He minds to do, which known by me,
you shall know all and sum.
But that I dread the whilst
your sorrows will you quell,
Straight would I hye where he does lurk
to friar Lawrence cell.
But if you gyn eftsoon
(as erst you did) to moorre
Whereto go I, you will be ded
before I thence retoorne.
So I shall spend in wast,
my time, and busy pain,
So unto you (your life once lost)
good answer commes in vain.
So shall I rid my self
with this sharp pointed knife:
So shall you cause your parents derre
wax weary of their life.
So shall your Romeus,
(despysing lively breath,)
With hasty foot (before his time)
run to untimely death.
Where if you can a while,
by reason, rage suppress,
I hope at my return to bring
the salve of your distress.
Now choose to have me here
a partner of your pain,
Or promosse me, to feed on hope,
till I return again.
Her mistres sendes her forth,
and makes a grave behest,
With reasons rain to rule the thoughts
that rage within her breast.
When hugy beapes of harms,
are heapd before her eyes,
Then vanish they by hope of escape,
and thus the lady lies,
Twixt well assured trust.
and doutfull lewd despair,
Now black and ougly be her thoughts:
now seem they white and fair.
As often in summer tide,
black clouds do dim the son,
And straight again in clearest sky
his restles steedes do run,
So Iuliets wandering mind
yclowded is with woe,
And by and by her hasty thought
the woes does ouergoe.
But now is time to tell
whilst she was tossed thus
What winds did drive or haven did hold
her lover, lover Romeus
When he had slain his foe,
that began this dedly strife,
And saw the furious fray had end,
by ending Tybalts life:
He fled the sharp revenge
of those that yet did live,
And douting much what penal doom
the troubled prince might give,
He sought some where unseen,
to lurk a little space,
And trusty Lawrence secret cell,
he thought the surest place.
In doutfull hap ay best,
a trusty friend is tried,
The friendly friar in this distress,
does grant his friend to hyde.
A secret place he has,
well seeled round about,
The mouth of which, so close is shut,
that none may find it out.
Both room there is to walk,
and place to sit and rest,
Beside, a bed to sleep upon,
full soft and trimly dressed.
The flower is planked so
with mattes, it is so warm.
That neither wind, nor smoky damps
have power him ought to harm.
Where he was wont in youth,
his fair friends to bestow,
There now he hydeth Romeus
whilst forth he goes to know
Both what is said and done,
and what appointed pain,
Is published by trumpets sound.
then home he hyes again.
By this, unto his cell,
the nurce with spedy pace:
Was co^^^e the nerest way: she sought,
no ydel resting place.
The friar sent home the news
of Romeus certain health:
And promise made (what so befell)
he should that night by stelth
Comme to his wonted place
that they in needful wise
Of their affairs in time to comme,
might thoroughly deuyse.
Those joyful news, the nurce
brought home with merry joy:
And now our Juliet joys, to think,
she shall her love enjoy.
The friar shuts fast his door,
and then to him beneth.
That waytes to hear the doutefull news
of life orels of death:
Thy hap quoth he, is good,
danger of death is none:
But thou shall live, and do full well,
in spite of spiteful fone.
This only pain for thee
was erst proclaymde aloude,
A banishd man, thou may thee not
within Verona shroude.
These heavy tydinges heard,
his golden locks he tare:
And like a frantike man has torn
the garments that he ware.
And as the smitten dear,
in brakes is waltring found:
So waltreth he, and with his breast
does beat the trodden ground.
He rises eft, and strikes
his head against the walls,
He falls down again, and loud
for hasty death be calls.
Come spedy death (quoth he)
the readiest leache in love,
Since naught can else beneth the sun
the ground of grief remove.
Of loathsome life break down
the hated staggering stays,
Destroy, destroy at once the life
that faintly yet decays.
But you (fair dame) in whom
dame nature did devise,:
With cunning hand to work, that might
seem wondrous in our eyes:
For you I pray the Gods,
your pleasures to increase,
And all mishap, with this my death,
for evermore to cease.
And mighty Jove with speed,
of justice bring them low,
Whose lofty pride (without our gylt)
our bliss does ouerblowe.
And Cupide grant to those
their spedy wrongs redress,
That shall bewail my cruel death,
and pity her distress.
Therewith, a cloud of sighs,
he breathd into the skies:
And two great streams of bitter tears,
ran from his swollen eyes.
These things, the ancient fryre,
with sorrow saw, and heard,
Of such beginning eke, the end,
the wise man greatly feared.
But lo, he was so weak,
by reason of his age,
That he ne could by force, repress
the rigor of his rage.
His wise and friendly words,
he speaks to the air:
For Romeus so vexed is,
with care and with despair,
That no advise can perce,
his close forstopped ears:
So now the friar does take his part,
in shedding ruthful tears.
With color pale, and wan,
with arms full hard yfold,
With woeful cheer, his wayling friend,
he stands to behold.
And then, our Romeus.
with tender hands ywrong:
With voice, with plaint made horce, with sobs,
and with a foltring tongue.
Renewd with nouel moan
the dolours of his heart,
His outward dreery cheer bewrayde,
his store of inward smart.
First, nature did he blame,
the author of his life,
In which his joys had been so scant,
and sorrows aye so ryfe:
The time and place of birth,
he fiersly did reprove,
He cried out (with open mouth)
against the stars above:
The ^^tall sisters three,
he said, had done hun wrong,
The thread that should not have been sponne
they had drawn forth too long.
He wished that he had
before this time been borne,
Or that as soon as he wan light,
his life he had forlorn.
His nurce he cursed, and
the hand that gave him pappe,
The midwife eke with tender grype
that held him in her lap:
And then did he complain,
on Venus cruel son
Who led him first unto the rocks,
which he should warely shonne.
By mean whereof he lost,
both life and liberty,
And dyed a hundred times a day,
and yet could never dye.
Loves troubles lasten long,
the joys he geues are short:
He forces not a lovers pain,
their ernest is his sport.
A thousand things and more,
I here let pass to write,
Which unto love this woeful man,
did speak in great despite.
On Fortune eke he raylde,
he calde her deaf, and blind,
Vinconstant, fond, deceitful rash,
vnruthfull, and unkind.
And to him self he laid
a great part of the falt:
For that he slew, and was not slain,
in fighting with Tibalt.
He blamed all the world,
and all he did defye
But Juliet, for whom he lived,
for whom eke would he dye.
When after raging fits,
appeased was his rage,
And when his passions (powered forth)
began partly to assuage.
So wisely did the fryre,
unto his tale replye,
That he straight cared for his life,
that erst had care to dye.
Art thou quoth he a man?
Thy shape says so thou art:
Thy crying and thy weping eyes,
denote a woman's heart.
For manly reason is
quite from of thy mind outchased,
And in her stead affections lewd,
and fancies highly placed.
So that, I stood in doubt
this hour (at the least)
If thou a man, or woman were,
or else a brutish beast.
A wise man in the midst
of troubles and distres,
Still stands not wayling present harm,
but seeks his harms redres,
As when the winter flawes,
with dreadful noise arise,
And heave the fomy swelling waves
up to the starry skies,
So that the broosed bark
in cruel seas betost,
Dispayreth of the happy haven
in danger to be lost.
The pylate bold at helm,
cries, mates strike now your sail:
And tornes her stem into the waves,
that strongly her assail.
Then driven hard upon
the bare and wrackfull shore,
In greater danger to be wract,
then he had been before.
He sees his ship full right
against the rock to run,
But yet he does what lies in hun
the perilous rock to shonne.
Sometimes the beaten boat,
by cunning government,
The ancors lost, the cables broke,
and all the tackle spent.
The roder smitten of,
and over board the mast,
Does win the long desired port,
the stormy danger past.
But if the master dread,
and ouerprest with woe,
Begin to wring his hands, and lets
the gyding rodder go
The ship rents on the rock,
or sinketh in the deep,
And eke the coward drenched is,
So: if thou still be weep
And seek not how to help
the chaunges that do chance,
Thy cause of sorrow shall increase,
thou cause of thy mischaunce.
Other account thee wise,
prove not thy self a fool,
Now put in practice lessons learnd,
of old in wisdoms school,
The wise man says, beware
thou double not thy pain:
For one perhaps thou may abide,
but hardly suffer twain.
As well we ought to seek
things hurtful to decrease,
As to endeavor helping things
by study to increase.
The praise of true fredom,
in wisdoms bondage lies
He wins blame whose deeds be fond,
although his words be wise.
Sickness the bodies gayle,
grief, gayle is of the mind,
If thou can escape from heavy grief,
true fredome shall thou find.
Fortune can fill nothing,
so full of hearty grief,
But in the same a constant mind,
Finds solace and relief,
Virtue is always thrall,
to troubles and annoye,
But wisdom in adversity,
finds cause of quiet joy.
And they most wretched are,
that know no wretchedness:
And afther great extremity,
mishaps ay waxen less.
Like as there is no weal,
but wastes away sometime,
So every kind of wayled woe,
will wear away in time.
If thou will master quite,
the troubles that the spill,
Endeavor first by reasons help,
to master witles will.
A sundry medson has,
each sundry faint disease,
But patience, a common salve,
to every wound geues ease.
The world is always full
of chances and of change,
Wherefore the change of chance must not
seem to a wise man strange.
For tickel Fortune does,
in changing but her kind:
But all her chaunges cannot change,
a steady constant mind.
Though wavering Fortune toorne
from thee her smyling face,
And sorrow seek to set him self,
in banishd pleasures place,
Yet may thy marred state,
be mended in a while,
And she eftsoon that frowneth now,
with pleasant cheer shall smyle.
For as her happy state,
no long while stands sure,
Even so the heavy plight she brings,
not always does endure.
What need so many words,
to thee that art so wise?
Thou better can advise thy self,
then I can thee advise.
Wisdom I see is vain,
if thus in time of need,
A wise man's wit unpracticed,
does stand him in no steed.
I know thou have some cause,
of sorrow and of care:
But well I wot thou have no cause
thus frantikly to fare.
Affections foggy mist,
thy febled sight does blind,
But if that reasons beams again,
might shine into thy mind:
If thou would view thy state
with an indifferent eye,
I think thou would condemn thy plaint,
thy sighing and thy cry.
With valiant hand thou made
thy foe yield up his breath,
Thou have escapd his swerd, and eke
the laws that threatten death.
By thy escape, thy friends,
are fraughted full of joy,
And by his death thy deadly foes
are laden with annoy
Will thou with trusty friends,
of pleasure take some part?
Or else to please thy hateful foes,
be partner of their smart?
Why cryest thou out on love,
why do thou blame thy fate?
Why do thou so cry after death?
thy life why do thou hate?
Do thou repent the choice.
that thou so late did choose?
Love is thy Lord, thou ought obey,
and not thy prince accuse.
For thou have found (thou know)
great favor in his sight:
He granted thee at thy request,
thy only hearts delight:
So that the Gods enuyde
the bliss thou liuedst in,
To give to such unthankful men,
is folly and a sin.
He thinks I hear thee say
the cruel banishment,
Is only cause of thy unrest,
only thou do lament,
That from thy native land,
and friends thou must depart,
Enforsd to fly from her that has
the keeping of thy heart.
And so oppressed with weight
of smart that thou do feel,
Thou do complain of Cupides brand,
and Fortunes turning wheel.
Unto a valiant heart,
there is no banishment,
All countries are his native soil
beneath the firmament.
As to the fish, the sea:
as to the foul, the air:
So is like pleasant to the wise,
each place of his repair.
Though froward Fortune chase
thee hence into exyle:
With doubled honor shall she call
thee home within a while.
Admyt thou should abide
abroad a year or twain:
Should so short absence cause so long,
and eke so grievous pain?
Though thou ne may thy friends,
here in Verona see,
They are not banishd Mantua,
where safely thou mast be.
Thither they may resort,
though thou resort not hither,
And there in surety may you talk,
of your affairs together.
Yea, but this while (alas)
thy Juliet must thou miss,
The only pillar of thy health,
and ancor of thy bliss.
Thy heart thou leauest with her,
when thou do hence depart:
And in thy breast enclosed bearst,
her tender friendly heart.
But if thou rue so much,
to leave the rest behind,
With thought of passed joys, content
thy discontented mind.
So shall the moon decrease,
wherewith thy mind does melt,
Compared to the heavenly joys
which thou have often felt.
He is too nyse a weakeling,
that shrinketh at a shower,
And he unworthy of the sweet,
that tastes not the sour.
Call now again to mind,
thy first consuming flame,
How did thou vainly burn in love
of an unloving dame.
Had thou not welnigh wept,
quite out thy swelling eyne:
Did not thy parts fordoon with pain,
languishe away and pyne?
Those greefes and others like,
were happly ouerpast:
And thou in haight of Fortunes wheel,
well placed at the last:
From whence thou art now fallen,
that raised up again,
With greater joy a greater while
in pleasure may thou raygne.
Compare the present while,
with times ypast before,
And think that Fortune has for thee,
great pleasure yet in store.
The whilst, this little wrong,
receive thou patiently,
And what of force must needs be done,
that do thou willingly.
Folly it is to fear
that thou can not avoid
And madness to desire it much,
that can not be enioyde.
To give to Fortune place,
not ay deserves blame:
But skill it is, according to
the times, thy self to frame.
Whilst to this skillful lore;
he lent his listening ears:
His sighs are stopped, and stopped are
the conduits of his tears.
As blackest clouds are chaced,
by winters nimble wind:
So have his reasons chaced care,
out of his careful mind.
As of a morning foul,
ensues an evening fair:
So banished hope returns home,
to banish his despair.
Now is affections veale,
removed from his eyes.
He sees the path that he must walk,
and reason makes him wise.
For very shame, the blood
does flashe in both his cheeks:
He thanks the father for his lore,
and farther aid he seeks.
He says that skilles youth,
for counsel is unfit,
And anger often with hastines
are ioind to want of wit.
But sound advise aboundes
in heddes with horishe hears:
For wisdom is by practice won,
and perfect made by years.
But aye from this time forth,
his ready bending will:
Shall Be in awe, and governed,
by friar Lawrence skill.
The governor is now,
right careful of his charge:
To whom he does wisely discoorse,
of his affairs at large.
He tells him how he shall,
depart the town unknown,
Both mindful of his friends safety,
and careful of his own.
How he shall gyde him self,
how he shall seek to win,
The friendship of the better sort,
how warely to crepe in
The favor of the Mantuan prince:
and how he may
Appease the wrath of Escalus:
and wipe the fault away.
The choler of his foes,
by gentle means tasswage:
Or else by force and practices,
to bridle quite their rage.
And last he charge him,
at his appointed hour,
To go with manly merry cheer,
unto his ladies bower.
And there with hole some words,
to salve her sorrows smart:
And to revive, (if need require,
her faint and dying heart.
The old man's words have filled
with joy, our Romeus breast:
And eke the old wives talk, has set
our Iuliets heart at rest.
Whereto may I compare,
(O lovers) this your day?
Like days the painful mariners,
are woonted to assay.
For beat with tempest great,
when they at length, espy
Some little beam of Phoebus light,
that perceth through the sky,
To clear the shadowde earth,
by clearenes of his face:
They hope that dreadles, they shall run
the remnant of their race.
Yea, they assure them self:
and quite behynd their back,
They cast all doubt, and thank the Gods
for scraping of the wrack.
But straight the boisterous winds,
with greater fury blow,
And over board the broken mast.
the stormy blastes do throw.
The heavens large, are clad
with clouds, as dark as hell:
And twice as hye, the striving waves
begin to roar, and swell.
With greater dangers dred,
the men are vexed more:
In greater peril of their life,
then they had been before.
The golden son, was gonne
to lodge him in the west:
The full moon eke in yonder South,
had sent most men to rest:
When restles Romeus,
and restles Juliet,
In woonted sort, by woonted mean,
in Iuliets chaumber met.
And from the windows top,
down had he leaped scarce,
When she with arms outstretched wide,
so hard did him embrace,
That welnigh had the sprite
(not forced by dedly force)
Flowne unto death, before the time
abandoning the corce.
Thus muet stood they both,
the eight part of an hour
And both would speak, but neither had
of speaking any power.
But on his breast her head
does ioylesse Juliet lay,
And on her slender neck, his chyn
does ruthful Romeus stay.
Their scalding sighs ascend,
and by their cheeks dowue fall,
Their trickling tears, as crystal clear,
but bitterer far then gall.
Then he to end the grief,
which both they lived in,
Did kiss his love, and wisely thus
his tale he did begin.
My Juliet, my love,
my only hope and care:
To you I purpose not as now,
with length of words declare,
The diuersenes, and eke
the accidents so strange,
Of frail unconstant Fortune, that
delyteth still in change.
Who in a moment heaues
her friends up to the height,
Of her swift turning slippery wheel,
then fleetes her friendship straight,
O wondrous change, even with
the twinkling of an eye,
Whom erst her self had rashly set,
in pleasant place so hye?
The same in great despyte,
down hedlong does she throw:
And while she treades and spurneth at
the lofty state laid low,
More sorrow does she shape
within an hours space,
Then pleasure in an hundred years:
so geyson is her grace.
The proof whereof in me
(alas) too plain apperes,
Whom tenderly my careful friends
have fostered with my feers,
In prosperous high degree:
mayntayned so by fate,
That (as your self did see) my foes
enuyde my noble state.
One thing there was, I did
above the rest desire,
To which, as to the sovereign good,
by hope I would aspyre:
Thol by our marriage mean,
we might within a while,
(To work our perfect happiness)
our parents reconsile.
That safely so we might
(not stopped by sturdy strife)
Unto the bounds that God has set,
gyde forth our pleasant life.
But now (alack) too soon
my bliss is ouerblowne,
And vpside down my purpose and
my enterprise are thrown,
And driven from my friends,
of strangers must I crave,
(O grant it God) from dangers dread,
that I may suertie have.
For lo, henceforth I must,
wander in lands unknown:
(So hard I find the princes doom,)
exyled from mine own.
Which thing I have thought good,
to set before your eyes:
And to exhort you, now to prove
your self a woman wise.
That patiently, you bear
my absent long abod.
For, what above by fatal doomes
decreed is that God,
And more then this, to say
it seemed he was bent,
But Juliet, in dedly grief,
with brackish tears besprent,
Brake of his tale begone,
and whilst his speech he stayde,
These self same words, or like to these,
with dreery chere she said.
Why Romeus, can it be,
thou have so hard a heart?
So far removed from ruth? so far
from thinking on my smart?
To leave me thus alone?
(thou cause of my distress)
Beseged with so great a camp,
of mortal wretchedness,
That every hour now,
and moment in a day,
A thousand times, death bragges, as he
would reaue my life away.
Yet such is my mishap,
(O cruel destenye)
That still I live, and wish for death,
but yet can never dye.
So that just cause I have,
to think (as seems me)
That froward Fortune did of late,
with cruel death agree
To lengthen lothed life,
to pleasure in my pain,
And triumph in my harm, as in
the greatest hoped gain.
And thou the instrument
of Fortunes cruel will,
Without whose aid she can no way,
her tyrans lust fulfill:
Art not a whit ashamde,
(as far as I can see)
To cast me of, when thou have culd
the better part of me.
Whereby (alas) to soon,
I seely wretch do prove,
That all the ancient sacred laws,
of friendship and of love,
Are quelde and quenched quite.
since he on whom always,
My chief hope, and my steady trust,
was wonted still to stay,
For whom I am becomme,
unto my self a foe:
Disdayneth me his steadfast friend,
and scorns my friendship so.
Nay Romeus, nay, thou may
of two things choose the one:
Either to see thy castaway
as soon as thou art gone,
Hedlong to throw her self
down from the windows haight,
And so to break her siender neck,
with all the bodies weight.
Or suffer her to be
companion of thy pain,
Where so thou go (Fortune thee gyde)
till thou retoorne again.
So wholly into thine,
transformed is my heart,
That even as often as I do think
that thou and I shall part:
So often (me thinks) my life
withdrawes it self away,
Which I retain, to no end else,
but to the end I may
In spite of all thy foes,
thy present parts enjoy,
And in distres to bear with thee,
the half of thine annoye.
Wherefore in humble sort
(Romeus) I make request,
If ever tender pity yet,
were lodgde in gentle breast,
O let it now have place,
to rest within thy heart,
Receive me as thy servant, and
the fellow of thy smart.
Thy absence is my death,
thy sight shall give me life.
But if perhaps thou stand in dred,
to lead me as a wife,
Art thou all counsellesse,
can thou no shift devise?
What lets, but in other weed
I may my self disguyse.
What, shall I he the first?
has none done so ere this?
To escape the bondage of their friends?
thy self can answer yes.
Or do thou stand in doubt,
that I thy wife ne can,
By service pleasure thee as much,
as may thy hired man?
Or is my loyalte
of both accounted less?
Perhaps thou fearst lest I for gain,
forsake thee in distress.
What,has my bewty now,
no power at all on you?
Whose brightness, force, and praise sometime,
up to the skies you blew?
My tears, my friendship, and
my pleasures done of old:
Shall they be quite forgote in deed?
when Romeus did behold
The wildnes of her look,
her cooler pale and ded,
The woorst of all that might betyde
to her, he began to dred.
And once again he did
in arms his Juliet take:
And kissed her with a loving kiss,
And thus to her he spoke.
Ah Juliet (quoth he)
the mistres of my heart,
For whom (even now) thy servant does
abide in dedly smart,
Even for the happy days
which thou desyrest to see,
And for the fervent frendships sake
that thou do owe to me:
At once these fancies vain,
out of thy mind root out,
Except perhaps unto thy blame,
thou fondly go about
To hasten forth my death,
and to thine own to run:
Which Natures law, and wisdoms lore
teach every wight to shonne.
For, but thou change thy mind,
(I do foretell the end)
Thou shall undo thy self for ay,
and me thy trusty friend.
For why, thy absence known,
thy father will be wroth,
And in his rage, so narowly
he will pursue us both:
That we shall try in vain,
to escape away by flight,
And vainly seek a loorking place,
to hyde us from his sight.
Then we found out, and caught,
quite void of strong defense
Shall cruelly be punished,
for thy departure hence.
I, as a rauishor,
thou, as a careless child,
I, as a man who does defile,
thou, as a maid defilde.
Thinking to lead in ease,
a long contented life,
Shall short our days by shameful death.
but (if my loving wife)
Thou banish from thy mind,
two foes that counsel has:
(That wont to hinder sound advise)
rash hastines, and wrath:
If thou be bend to bay
the lore of reasons skill,
And wisely by her princely power
suppress rebelling will:
If thou our safety seek,
more then thine own delight,
Since suerty stands in parting, and
thy pleasures grow of sight:
For hear the cause of joy,
and suffer for a while,
So shall I safely live abroad,
and safe torn from exile.
So shall no slanders blot,
thy spotles life destayne,
So shall thy kinsmen be vnstyrd,
and I exempt from pain.
And think thou not that aye,
the cause of care shall last,
These stormy broils shall ouerblow,
much like a winters blast.
For Fortune changes more,
then fickel fantasy,
In nothing Fortune constant is,
save in inconstancy.
Her hasty ronning wheel,
is of a restles coorse,
That turns the clymers hedlong down,
from better to the worse.
And those that are beneth,
she heaueth up again,
So we shall rise to pleasures mount,
out of the pit of pain.
Ere four months ouerpasse,
such order will I take,
And by my letters, and my friends,
such means I mind to make,
That of my wandering race,
ended shall be the royle,
And I called home with honor great,
unto my native soil.
But if I be condemd
to wander still in thrall,
I will return to you (mine own)
befall what may befall.
And then by strength of friends,
and with a mighty hand,
From Verone will I carry thee,
into a foreign land.
Not in man's weed disguisd,
or as one scarcely known,
But as my wife and only feere,
in garment of thine own.
Wherefore repress at once,
the passions of thy heart,
And where there is no cause of grief,
cause hope to heal thy smart.
For of this one thing thou
may well assured be:
That nothing else but only death
shall sunder me from thee.
The reasons that he made,
did seem of so great weight,
And had with her such force: that she
to him began answer straight.
Dear sir, naught else wish I,
but to obey your will:
But sure where so you go, your heart
with me shall tarry still,
As sign and certain pledge,
till here I shall you see:
Of all the power that over you
your self did grant to me.
And in hip stead take mine,
the gage of my good will:
One promise crave I at your hand,
that grant me to fulfill.
Fail not to let me have
at friar Lawrence hand,
The tydinges of your health, and how
your doutfull case shall stand.
And all the weary while
that you shall spend abroad:
Cause me from time to time to know
the place of your abode.
His eyes did gushe out tears,
a sigh brake from his breast,
When he did grant, and with an oath
did vow to keep the hest.
Thus these two lovers pass
away the weary night,
In pain and plaint, not (as they wont)
in pleasure and delight.
But now (somewhat too soon)
in farthest East arose
Fair Lucifer, the golden star,
that Lady Venus chose.
Whose course appointed is,
with spedy race to run,
A messenger of dawning day,
and of the rising son.
Then fresh Aurora, with
her pay and silver glade
Did clear the skies, and from the earth,
had chased ougly shade.
When thou ne look wide,
ne closely do thou wink,
When Phoebus from our hemysphere,
in western wave does sink.
What cooller then the heavens
do show unto thine eyes:
The same, (or like) saw Romeus
in farthest Esterne skies.
As yet, he saw no day:
ne could he call it night,
With equal force, decreasing dark,
fought with increasing light.
Then Romeus in arms
his lady began to fold,
With friendly kiss and ruthfully
she began her knight behold.
With solemn oath they both*
their sorrowful leave do take,
They swear no stormy troubles shall
their steady friendship shake.
Then careful Romeus,
again to cell retoornes,
And in her chamber secretly
our ioyles Juliet moornes.
Now hugycloudes of care,
of sorrow and of dread,
The clearnes of their gladsome hearts
has wholly ouerspread.
When golden crested Phoebus
bosteth him in sky,
And under earth, to escape revenge,
his dedly foe does fly:
Then has these lovers day
an end, their night begone,
For each of them to other is,
as to the world, the sun.
The dawning they shall see,
ne summer any more,
But blackfaced night with winter rough,
(ah) beaten over sore.
The weary watch discharged,
did hye them home to sleep,
The warders, and the skowtes were chargd*
their place and coorse to keep.
And Verone gates a wide,
the porters had set open,
When Romeus had of his affairs
with friar Lawrence spoken:
Warely he walked forth,
unknown of friend or foe:
Clad like a merchant venterer,
from top even to the toe.
He spurd apace and came
withouten stop or stay,
To Mantua gates, where lighted down,
he sent his man away.
With words of comfort, to
his old afflicted fire:
And straight in mind to soiorne there,
a lodgeing does he hyre.
And with the nobler sort
he does himself acquaint,
And of his open wrong received,
the Duke does hear his plaint.
He practices by friends,
for pardon of ^^yle,
The whilst, he seeks every way,
his sorrows to begyle.
But who forgets the cole
that burns in his breast?
Alas his cares, deny his heart,
the sweet desired rest.
No time finds he of mirth,
he finds no place of joy,
But every thing occasion geues,
of sorrow and annoye.
For when in toorning skies,
the heavens lamps are light,
And from the other hemysphere,
fair Phoebus chaceth night,
When every man and beast,
has rest from painful toil,
Then in the breast of Romeus,
his passions gyn to boil.
Then does he wet with tears,
the cowche whereon he lies,
And then his sighs the chamber fill,
and out aloude he cries
Against the restles stars,
in rolling skies that raunge,
Against the fatal sisters three,
and Fortune full of change.
Each night a thousand times
he calls for the day,
He thinks Titans restles stedes,
of restines do stay.
Or that at length they have
some ^ay^ing place found out,
Or (gyded ill) have lost their way
and wandered far about.
While thus in ydel thoughts,
the weary time he spends,
The night has end, but not with night*
the plaint of night be ends.
Is he accompanied,
is he in place alone?
In cumpany he wayles his harm,
a part be makes moan.
For if his feeres rejoice,
what cause has he to joy,
That wants still his chief delight,
while they their loves enjoy*
But if with heavy cheer,
they show their inward grief,
He wayleth most his wretchedness,
that is of wretches chief.
When he does hear abroad,
the praise of ladies blown.
Within his thought he scorneth them
and does prefer his own.
When pleasant songs he bears
When others do rejoice
The melody of Music does
stir up his mourning voice.
But if in secret place
he walk some where alone,
The place it self, and secretnes
redoubleth all his moan.
Then speaks he to the beasts
to fethered fowls, and trees,
Unto the earth, the clouds, and to
what so beside he sees.
To them he shewth his smart,
as though they reason had,
Each thing may cause his heaviness*
but naught may make him glad.
And (weary of the day)
again he calls night,
The sun he curses, and the hour,
when first his eyes saw light.
And as the night, and day,
their course do enterchaunge:
So does our Romeus nightly cares,
for cares of day exchange.
In absence of her knight,
the lady no way could
Keep true between her greefes and her,
though nere so feign she would.
And though with greater pain
she cloked sorrows smart:
Yet did her paled face disclose
the passions of her heart.
Her sighing every hour,
her weping every where,
Her recheles heed of meat, of sleep,
and wearing of her gear:
The careful mother marks.
then of her health afraid,
Because the greefes increased still.
thus to her child she said.
Dear daughter, if you should
long languishe in this sort,
I stand in doubt that over soon
your sorrows* will make short
Your loving fathers life,
and mine, that love you more
Then our own propre breath, and life.
Brydel hence forth therefore
Your grief, and pain your self
on joy your thought to set,
For time it is that now you should
our Tybalts death forget.
Of whom, since God has claymd
the life, that was but lent,
He is in bliss, ne is there cause
why you should thus lament*
You can not call him back
with tears, and shrikinges shrill:
It is a falt thus still to grudge
at Gods appointed will.
The seely soul had now
no longer power to feign,
Ne longer could she hyde her harm:
but aunswerd thus again.
With heavy broken sighs,
with visage pale and ded
Madame, the last of Tybalts tears,
a great while since I shed.
Whose spring has been ere this
so laded out by me,
That empty quite, and moystureles,
I guess it now to be.
So that my payned heart
by canduites of the eyne,
No more henceforth (as wont it was)
shall gush forth dropping bryne.
The woeful mother knew
not, what her daughter meant,
And loath to vex her child by words,
her peace she warely hent.
But when from hour to hour,
from morrow to the morrow,
Still more and more she saw increast
her daughters wonted sorrow.
All means she sought of her,
and howshold folk, to know
The certain root, whereon her grief,
and booteles moan does grow.
But lo, she has in vain,
her time, and labor lore,
Wherefore without all measure, is
her heart tormented sore.
And since her self could not
find out the cause of care:
She thought it good to tell the sire,
how ill his child did fare.
And when she saw her time,
thus to her feere she said:
Sir, if you mark our daughter well,
the countenance of the maid,
And how she fares, since
that Tybalt unto death,
(Before his time, forced by his foe)
did yield his living breath.
Her face shall seem so changed,
her doings eke so strange,
That you will greatly wonder at,
so great and sudden change.
Not only she forbeares,
her meat, her drink, and sleep,
But now she tends nothing else
but to lament and weep.
No greater joy has she,
nothing contents her heart
So much, as in her chaumber, close
to shut her self apart.
Where she does so torment
her poor afflicted mind,
That much in danger stands her life,
except sum help we find.
But (out alas) I see not
how it may be found:
Unless that first, we might find, whence
her sorrows thus abound.
For though with busy care,
I have employde my wit,
And used all the ways I knew,
to learn the truth of it:
Neither extremity,
ne gentle means could boot.
She hydeth close within her breast,
her secret sorrows root.
This was my first conceit,
that all her ruth arose
Out of her coofin Tybalts death,
late slain of dedly foes.
But now my heart does hold
a new repugnant thought,
Some greater thing, not Tybalts death
this change in her has wrought.
Her self assured me,
that many days a go,
She shed the last of Tybalts tears,
which word amald me so,
That I then could not guess
what thing else might her green,
But now at length I have bethought
me. And I do believe
The only crop and root
of all my daughters pain,
Is grudgeing enuies faint disease,
perhaps she does disdain
To see in wedlock yoke
the most part of her feeres,
Whilst only she unmarried,
does lose so many years.
And more perchance she thinks
you mind to keep her so,
Wherefore dispayring does she wear
her self away with woe.
Therefore (dear sir) in time,
take on your daughter ruth,
For why, a brickel thing is glass,
and frail is frayllesse youth.
Join her at once to sum,
in link of marriage,
That may be meet for our degree,
and much about her age.
So shall you banish care
out of your daughters breast:
So we her parents in our age,
shall live in quiet rest.
Whereto began easily
her husband to agree,
And to the mothers skillful talk,
thus straight way aunswerd he.
Often have I thought (dear wife)
of all these things ere this,
But evermore my mind me gave,
it should not be amiss,
By farther leisure had,
a husband to provide,
Scarce saw she yet full.xvi. years:
too young to be a bryde.
But since her state does stand
on terms so perilous,
And that a maiden daughter is
a treasour dangerous:
With so great speed I will
endeavor to procure
A husband for our daughter young,
her sickness faint to cure.
That you shall rest content,
(so warely will I choose)
And she recover soon enough
the time she seems to loose.
The whilst, seek you to learn,
if she in any part,
Already has (unware to us)
fixed her friendly heart.
Lest we have more respect
to honor and to wealth,
Then to our daughters quiet life,
and to her happy health.
Whom I do hold as dear,
as thapple of mine eye,
And rather with in poor estate,
and daughterles to dye:
Then leave my goods and her
ythrald to such a one,
Whose chorlish dealing (I once dead)
should be her cause of moan.
This pleasant answer heard,
the lady parts again.
And Capilet the maidens sire,
within a day or twain,
Conferreth with his friends,
for marriage of his daughter,
And many gentlemen there were,
with busy care that sought her.
Both for the maiden was
well shaped, young, and fair,
As also well brought up, and wise,
her fathers only heir.
Among the rest was one
inflamde with her desire,
Who, County Paris cliped was,
an Earl he had to sire.
Of all the futers, him
the father likes best,
And easily unto the Earl
he makes his behest.
Both of his own good will,
and of his friendly aid,
To win his wife unto his will,
and to persuade the maid.
The wife did joy to hear
the joyful husband say,
How happy hap, how meet a match,
he had found out that day.
He did she seek to hyde
her joys within her heart,
But straight she hyeth to Juliet,
to her she tells apart,
What happy talk (by mean
of her) was past no rather
Between the woing Paris, and
her careful loving father.
The person of the man,
the fewters of his face,
His youthful years, his fayrenes, and
his port and semely grace.
With curious words she payntes
before her daughters eyes,
And then with store of virtues praise,
she heaues him to the skies.
She vauntes his race, and gifts,
that Fortune did him give:
Whereby (she says) both she and hers,
in great delight shall live.
When Juliet conceived
her parents whole intent,
Whereto, both love, and reasons right,
forbod her to assent:
Within her self she thought,
rather then be forsworn,
With horses wild, her tender parts
a sonder should be torn.
Not now with bashful brow
(in wonted wise) she spoke,
But with unwonted boldness, straight
into these words she brake.
Madame, I marvel much,
that you so lauasse are,
Of me your child, (your jewel once,
your only joy and care.)
As thus to yield me up,
at pleasure of another,
Before you know if I do like,
or else mislike my lover.
Do what you list, but yet
of this assure you still,
If you do as you say you will,
I yield not there until.
For had I choice of twain,
far rather would I choose,
My part of all your goods, and eke
my breath and life to lose:
Then grant that he possess
of me the smallest part.
First, weary of my painful life,
my cares shall kill my heart.
Else will I perce my breast,
with sharp and bloody knife,
And you my mother shall becomme
the murdresse of my life:
In giving me to him,
whom I ne can ne may,
Ne ought to love. Wherefore on knees,
dear mother I you pray
To let me live henceforth,
as I have lived tofore:
Cease all your troubles for my sake,
and care for me no more.
But suffer Fortune feerce,
to work on me her will,
In her it lies to do me boot,
in her it lies to spill.
For whilst you for the best,
desire to place me so,
You have a way my lingering death,
and double all my woe.
So deep this answer made
the sorrows down to sink,
Into the mothers breast: that she
ne knows what to think.
Of these her daughters words.
but all appalde she stands,
And up unto the heavens she throws
her wondering head and hands.
And nigh beside her self
her husband has she sought,
She tells him all, she does forget
ne yet she hydeth ought.
The testy old man wroth,
disdainful without measure,
Sendes forth his folk in haste for her.
and byds them take no leisure.
Ne on her tears or plaint,
at all to have remorse,
But (if they can not with her will,)
to bring the maid perforce.
The message heard, they part,
to fetch that they must fet:
And willingly with them walks forth
obedient Juliet.
Arrived in the place,
when she her father saw,
Of whom (as much as duty would)
the daughter stood in awe.
The servants sent away,
(the mother thought it meet)
The woeful daughter all be wept,
fell groueling at his feet.
Which she does wash with tears
as she thus groueling lies:
So fast and eke so plenteously
distill they from her eyes.
When she to call for grace
her mouth does think to open,
Must she is: for sighs and sobs
her fearful talk have broken.
The sire, whose swelling worth
her tears could not assuage,
With fiery eyes, and skarlet cheeks,
thus spoke her in his rage.
Whilst ruthfully stood by
the maidens mother mylde,
Listen (quoth he) unthankful and
thou disobedient child.
Have thou so soon let slip
out of thy mind the word,
That thou so often times have heard
rehearsed at my board?
How much the Romayne youth
of parents stood in awe,
And eke what power upon their seed
the fathers had by law?
Whom they not only might
pledge, alienate, and sell,
(When so they stood in need) but more
if children did rebel,
The parents had the power,
of life and sodayn death.
What if those goodmen should again
receive the living breath?
In how straight bonds would they
thy stubberne body bind:
What weapons would they seek for thee?
what torments would they find?
To chasten (if they saw)
the lewdnes of thy life,
Thy great unthankfulness to me,
and shameful sturdy strife?
Such care thy mother had,
so dear then were to me,
That I with long and earnest ^ute,
provided have for thee.
One of the greatest lords,
that wonnes about this town,
And for his many virtues sake,
a man of great renown.
Of whom, both thou and I,
unworthy are too much,
So rich ere long he shall be left,
his fathers wealth is such.
Such is the noblenes,
and honor of the race,
From whence his father came, and yet
thou playest in this case,
The dainty fool, and stubberne
gyrle, for want of skill,
Thou do refuse thy offered weal,
and disobay my will.
Even by his strength I swear,
that first did give me life
And gave me in my youth the strength
to get thee on my wife.
On less by wensday next,
thou bend as I am bent,
And at our castle called free town,
thou freely do assent
To Count Paris suit,
and promise to agree
To whatsoever then shall pass,
twixt him, my wife, and me.
Not only will I give
all that I have away,
From thee, to those that shall me love,
me honor, and obey:
But also too so close,
and to so hard a gayle,
I shall thee wed for all thy life,
that sure thou shall not fail.
A thousand times a day
to wish for sodayn death:
And curse the day, and hour when first
thy lunges did give thee breath.
Advise thee well, and say
that thou art warned now,
And think not that I speak in sport,
or mind to break my vow.
For were it not that I
to Count Paris gave
My faith, which I must keep vnfalst,
my honor so to save:
Ere thou go hence, my self
would see thee chastned so,
That thou should once for all be taught,
thy duty how to know
And what revenge of old,
the angry syres did find
Against their children that rebeld,
and showed them self unkind.
These said, the old man straight.
is gone in have a way.
Ne for his daughters imswere* would
the testy father stay.
And after him, his wife
does follow out of door,
And there they leave their chidden child.
kneeling upon the floor.
Then she that often had seen
the fury of her sire,
Dreading what might come of his rage,
nould farther stir his ire.
Unto her chamber she
withdrew her self aparte,
Where she was wonted to unload,
the sorrows of her heart.
There did she not so much
busy her eyes in sleping,
As ouerprest with restles thoughts
in piteous booteles weping.
The fast falling of tears
make not her tears decrease,
Ne by the pouring forth of plaint,
the cause of plaint does cease.
So that to thend the moon
and sorrow may decay,
The best is that she seek some mean
to take the cause away.
Her weary bed betime
the woeful wight forsakes,
And to saint Frauncis church to mass
her way devoutly takes.
The friar forth is calde,
she prays him hear her shrift:
Devotion is in so young years,
a rare and precious gift.
When in her tender knees
the dainty lady kneeles,
In mind to power forth all the grief,
that inwardly she feels.
With sighs and salted tears
her shryuing does begin,
Forshe of heaped sorrows has
to speak, and not of sin.
Her voice with piteous plaint
was made already horce,
And hasty sobs, when she would speak,
brake of her words parforce.
But as she may piece meal,
she powers in his lap,
The marriage news, a mischief new,
prepared by mishappe.
Her parents promise erst
to Count Paris past,
Her fathers threats she tells him,
and thus concludes at last.
Once was I wedded well,
ne will I wed again,
For since I know I may not be
the wedded wife of twain,
For I am bound to have
one God, ene faith, one make,
My purpose is as soon as I
shall hence my journey take
With these two hands which ioynde
unto the heavens I stretch,
The hasty death which I desire
unto my self to reach.
This day (O Romeus)
this day thy woeful wife
Will (...) the end of all her ears
by ending careful life.
So my departed sprite
shall witness to the sky,
And eke my blood unto the earth
bear record how that I
Have kept my faith unbroke,
steadfast unto my friend,
When this her heavy tale was told
her vow eke at an end,
Her gasing here and there,
her feerce and staring look,
Did witness that some lewd attempt,
her heart had undertook.
Whereat, the friar affonde,
and gaftfully afraid,
Lest she by deed perform her word,
thus much to her he said.
Ah lady Juliet,
what need the words you spoke*
I pray you grant me one request
for blessed Mary's sake.
Measure somewhat your grief,
hold here a while your peace,
Whilst I bethink me of your case,
your plaint and sorrows cease.
Such comfort will I give
you ere you part from hence,
And for thassaltes of Fortunes pre
prepare so sure defense,
So wholesome salve will I
for your afflictions find,
That you shall hence depart again
with well contented mind.
His words have chased straight
out of her heart despair,
Her black and ougly dreadful thoughts
by hope are waxen fair.
So friar Lawrence now
has left her there alone,
And he out of the church in have
is to his chaumber gone.
Where sundry thoughts within
his careful head arise,
The old man's foresight diverse doutes
has set before his eyes.
His conscience one while
condems it for a sin,
To let her take Paris to spouse,
since he himself had been
The chefest cause, that she
unknown to father or mother,
Not five months past in that self place
was wedded to another.
An other while an hugy
heap of dangers dred,
His restles thought has heaped up,
within his troubled head.
Even of it self that tempt
he judges pertious,
The execucion eke he demes
so much more dangerous,
That to a woman's grace
he must himself commit,
That young is, simple, and unware,
for weighty affairs unfit.
For if the fail in ought
the matter published,
Both she and Romeus were undone,
himself eke punished,
When too and fro in mind
he diverse thoughts had cast,
With tender pity and with ruth
his heart was won at last.
He thought he rather would
in hasard set his fame,
Then suffer such adultery
resolving on the same,
Out of his closet straight,
he took a litele glass,
And then with double have retornde
where woeful Juliet was.
Whom he has found welnigh
in trance, scarce drawing breath,
Attending still to hear the news
of life or else of death.
Of whom he did enquire
of the appointed day.
On wensday next (quod Juliet)
so does my father say:
I must give my consent
but (as I do remember)
The solemn day of marriage is,
the tenth day of September.
Dear daughter quoth the friar
of good chere see thou be,
For lo, saint Frauncis of his grace
has shewde a way to me,
By which I may both thee,
and Romeus together,
Out of the bondage which you fear
assured deliver.
Even from the holy font
thy husband have I known,
And since he grew in years, have kept
his counsels as mine own.
For from his youth he would
unfold to me his heart,
And often have I cured him,
of anguish, and of smart.
I know that by desert
his friendship I have won,
And I him hold as dear, as if
he were my propre son.
Wherefore my friendly heart,
can not abide that he
Should wrongfully in ought be harmde,
if that it lay in me,
To right or to revenge
the wrong by my advise,
Or timely to prevent the same
in any other wise.
And since thou art his wife,
thee am I bound to love,
For Romeus frindships sake, and seek
thy anguishe to remove.
And dreadful torments which
thy heart besegen round,
Wherefore my daughter give good care,
unto my counsels sound.
Forget not what I say,
ne tell it any wight,
Not to the nurce thou trustest so,
as Romeus is thy knight.
For on this thread does hang
thy death and eke thy life,
My fame, or shame, his weal or woe,
that chose thee to his wife.
Thou art not ignorant
(because of such renown
As every where is spread of me,
but chefely in this town.)
That in my youthful days
abroad I trauayled
Through every land found out by men,
by men inhabited,
So twenty years from home,
in lands unknown, a gest,
I never gave my weary limbs
long time of quiet rest.
But in the desert woods,
to beast? of cruel kind,
Or on the seas to drenching waves,
at pleasure of the wind.
I have committed them
to ruth of rouers hand,
And to a thousand dangers more
by water and by land,
But not in vain (my child)
has all my wandering been,
Beside the great contentednes
my sprete abides in.
That by the pleasant thought
of passed things does grow
One private fruit more have I pluchd
which thou shall shortly know:
What force the stones, the plants,
and metals have to work,
And diverse other things that in
the bowels of earth do loorke,
With care I have sought out
with pain I did them prove,
With them eke can I help my self,
at times of my behoue,
(Although the science be
against the laws of men)
When sudden danger forces me,
but yet most chiefly when
The work to do is least
displeasing unto God,
Not helping to do any sin
that wrekefull Jove forbode.
For since in life no hope
of long abode I have,
But now am comme unto the drink
of my appointed grave,
And that my death draws nere,
whose stripe I may not shonne,
But shall be calde to make account
of all that I have done,
Now ought I from hence forth
more depely print in mind
The judgment of the lord, then when
youths folly made me blind,
When love and fond desire
were boiling in my breast,
Whence hope and dred by striving thoughts
had banished friendly rest,
Know therefore (daughter) that
with other gifts which I
Have well attained to by grace
and favor of the sky,
Long since I did find out,
and yet the way I know
Of certain roots and sauory herbs
to make a kind of dowe,
Which baked hard, and bet
into a powder fine,
And drunk with conduite water, or
with any kind of wine,
It does in half an hour
astonne the taker so,
And mastreth all his senses, that
he feels weal nor woe,
And so it burieth up
the sprite and living breath,
That even the skillful leche would say,
that he is slain by death.
One virtue more it has,
as marvelous as this,
The taker by receiving it,
at all not grieved is.
But painlesse as a man,
that thinks naught at all,
Into a sweet and quiet sleep
immediately does fall,
From which (according to
the quantity he takes,
Longer or shorter is the time
before the sleper waketh.
And thence (theffect once wrought)
again it does restore
Him that received unto the state,
wherein he was before.
Wherefore, mark well the end,
of this my tale begone,
And thereby learn what is by thee
hereafter to be done.
Cast of from thee at once,
the weed of womannish dread,
With manly courage arm thy self,
from heel unto the head.
For only on the fear
or boldness of thy breast,
The happy hap, or ill mishappe
of thy affayre does rest.
Receive this vyoll small,
and keep it as thine eye,
And on thy marriage day before
the sun do clear the sky,
Fill it with water full,
up to the very brim.
Then drink it of, and thou shall feel,
throughout each vain and lim:
A pleasant slumber slide,
and quite dispred at length,
On all thy parts, from every part
reave all thy kindly strength.
Withouten moving thus
thy ^dle parts shall rest,
No pulse shall go, ne heart once beat
within thy hollow breast.
But thou shall lie as she
that dies in a trance,
Thy kinsmen, and thy trusty friends
shall wayle the sudden chance:
Thy corpse then will they bring
to grave in this church yard,
Where thy forefathers long ago
a costly tomb preparde.
Both for himself, and eke
for those that should come after,
Both deep it is, and long and large,
where thou shall rest my daughter,
Till I to Mantua send
for Romeus thy knight.
Out of the tomb, both he and I
will take thee forth that night.
And when out of thy sleep
thou shall awake again,
Then may thou go with him from hence,
and healed of thy pain.
In Mantua lead with him
unknown a pleasant life,
And yet perhaps in time to comme,
when c^ase shall all the strife,
And that the peace is made
twixt Romeus and his foes,
My self may find so fit a time
these secrets to dysclose,
Both to my praise, and to
thy tender parents joy,
That daungerles without reproach
thou shall thy love enjoy.
When of his skillful tale,
the friar had made an end,
To which our Juliet so well
her ear and wits did bend,
That she has heard it all,
and has forgotten naught,
Her fainting heart was comforted,
with hope and pleasant thought.
And then to him she said,
doubt not but that I will
With stout and vnappauled heart,
your happy hest fulfill.
Yea, if I wist it were
a venomous dedly drink:
Rather would I that through my throat
the certain bane should sink,
Then I (not drinking it)
into his hands should fall,
That has no part of me as yet,
ne ought to have at all.
Much more I ought with bold
and with a willing heart,
To greatest danger yield my self
and to the dedly smart,
To comme to him, on whom
my life does wholly stay,
That is my only hearts delight,
and so he shall be aye.
Then go quoth he (my child)
I pray that God on hye,
Direct thy foot, and by thy hand
upon the way thee gye:
God grant he so confirm
in thee thy present will,
That no inconstant toy thee let,
thy promise to fulfill.
A thousand thanks and more,
our Juliet gave the friar,
And homeward to her fathers house
joyful she does retire.
And as with stately gate
she passed through the street,
She saw her mother in the door,
that with her there would meet.
In mind to ask if she
her purpose yet did hold,
In mind also a part twixt them,
her duty to have told:
Wherefore with pleasant face,
and with unwonted chere,
As soon as she was unto her
approached sumwhat nere,
Before the mother spoke,
thus did she first begin,
Madame, at saint Frauncis church
have I this morning been,
Where I did make abode,
alonger while (percase)
Then dewty would, yet have I not
been absent from this place,
So long a while, whithout
a great and just cause why,
This fruit have I received there,
my heart erst like to dye,
Is now revived again,
and my afflicted breast
Released from affliction,
restored is to rest.
For lo, my tronbled ghost
(alas too sore diseasde,)
By gostly counsel and advise,
has friar Lawrence easde,
To whom I did at large
discourse my former life,
And in confession did I tell
of all our passed strife.
Of Count Paris suit,
and how my lord my sire,
By my ungrate and stubborn stryft,
I styrred unto ire.
But lo, the holy friar
has by his gostly lore,
Made me another woman now,
then I had been before,
By strength of arguments
he charged so my mind,
That (though I sought) no sure defense
my serching thought could find.
So forced I was at length
to yield up witles will,
And promised to be orderd by
the friars praised skill,
Wherefore, albeit I
had rashely long before,
The bed and rytes of marriage,
for many years forswore,
Yet mother now behold,
your daughter at your will,
Ready (if you command her ought)
your pleasure to fulfill.
Wherefore in humble wise.
dear madam I you pray
To go unto my lord and sire,
withouten long delay,
Of him first pardon crave
of faults already past,
And show him (if it pleases you)
his child is now at last
Obedient to his just
and to his skillful hest.
And that I will (god lending life)
on wensday next be pressed*
To wait on him and you,
unto thappoynted place,
Where I will in your hearing and
before my fathers face,
Unto the Count give
my faith and whole assent,
To take him for my lord and spouse.
thus fully am I bent.
And that out of your mind
I may remove all doubt,
Unto my closet fare I now,
to search and to choose out
The brauest garments and
the richest jewels there,
Which (better him to please) I mind
on wensday next to wear.
For if I did excel
the famous Gretian rape,
Yet might attire help to amend
my bewty and my shape.
The simple mother was,
rapt in to great delight,
Not half a word could she bring forth,
but in this joyful plight,
With nimble foot she ran
and with unwonted pace,
Unto her pensive husband, and
to him with pleasant face
She told what she had heard,
and prayseth much the friar.
And joyful tears ran down the cheeks
of this gray berded fire.
With hands and eyes heaued up,
he thanks God in his heart,
And then he says, this is not (wife)
the friars first desert.
Often has he shewde to us,
great friendship heretofore,
By helping us at needful times,
with wisdoms precious lore:
In all our common weal,
scarce one is to be found,
But is for sum good torn unto
this holy father bound.
Oh that the third part of
my goods (I do not feign)
But twenty of his passed years
might purchase him again
So much in recompense
of friendship would I give,
So much (in faith) his extreme age
my friendly heart does grieve.
These said, the glad old man,
from home, goes straight abroad,
And to the stately palace hyeth,
where Paris made abode.
Whom he desires to be
on wensday next his geast,
At Freetowne, where he minds to make
for him a costly feast.
But lo, the Earl says
such feasting were but lost,
And counsels him till marriage time
to spare so great a cost.
For then he knows well
the charges will be great,
The whilst his heart desires still
her sight, and not his meat.
He craves of Capilet,
that he may straight go see
Fair Juliet, where to he does
right willingly agree.
The mother warnde before,
her daughter does prepare,
She warns and she charge her
that in no wise she spare
Her courteous speech, her pleasant
looks, and commely grace,
But liberally to give them forth
when Paris commes in place.
Which she as cunningly
could set forth to the show,
As cunning craftesmen to the sale
do set theie wares on rue:
That ere the County did
out of her sight depart,
So secretly unawares to him,
she stale away his heart,
That of his life and death
the wyly wench has power,
And now his longing heart thinks long
for their appointed hour.
And with importune suit,
the parents does he pray,
The wedlock knot to knit soon up,
and have the marriage day.
The woer has past forth
the first day in this sort,
And many other more then this,
in pleasure and disport,
At length the wished time
of long hoped delight,
(As Paris thought) drew nere, but nere
approached heavy plight:
Against the bridal day
the parents did prepare,
Such rich attire, such furniture,
such store of dainty fare,
That they which did behold
the same the night before,
Did think and say, a man could scarcely
wish for any more.
Nothing did seem to dear,
the dearest things were bought,
And (as the written story says)
in deed there wanted naught.
That longd to his degree
and honor of his stock,
But Juliet the whilst her thoughts
within her breast did lock.
Even from the trusty nurce,
whose secretries was tryde,
The secret counsel of her heart
the nurce child seeks to hide.
For since to mock her dame
she did not stick to lie,
She thought no sin with show of truth,
to bleare her nurces eye.
In chamber-secretly
the tale she began renew,
That at the door she told her dame
as though it had been true.
The flattring nurce did praise
the friar for his skill,
And said that she had done right well
by wit to order will.
She sets forth at large
the fathers furious rage,
And eke she prayseth much to her,
the second marriage.
And County Paris now
she praises ten times more,
By wrong, then she her self by right,
had Romeus praysde before.
Paris shall dwell there still,
Romeus shall not return,
What shall it boot her life,
to languish still and mourn.
The pleasures past before,
she must account as gain,
But if he do reforne, what then?
for one she shall have twain.
The one shall use her as
his lawful wedded wise,
In wanton love, with equal joy
the other lead his life:
And best shall she be sped
of any townish dame,
Of husband and of paramour,
to find her change of game.
These words and like, the nurce
did speak, in hope to please,
But greatly did those wicked words
the ladies mind disease:
But ay she hid her wrath,
and seemed well content,
When daily did the naughty nurce
new arguments invent:
But when the bryde perceued
her hour opproched nere,
She sought (the best she could) to feign,
and tempted so her cheer,
That by her outward look,
no living wight could guess
Her inward woe, and yet a new
renewde is her distress.
Unto her chaumber does
the pensive wight repair.
And in her hand a percher light
the nurce bears up the stayre,
In Iuliets chamber was
her wonted use to lie,
Wherefore her mistres dreading that
she should her work descrye
As soon as she began
her pallet to unfold,
Thinking to lie that night, where she
was wont to lie of old:
Does gently pray her seek,
her lodgeing some where else.
And lest the crafty should suspect,
a ready reason tells.
Derefrend (quoth she) you know,
to morrow is the day,
Of new contract, wherefore this night,
my purpose is to pray,
Unto the heavenly minds,
that dwell above the skies,
And order all the course of things,
as they can best deuyse,
That they so smyle upon
the doings of To morrow,
That all the remnant of my life,
may be exempt from sorrow:
Wherefore I pray you leave
me here alone this night,
But see that you to morrow comme
before the dawning light,
For you must coorle my hear,
and set on my attire,
And eastly the loving nurse,
did yield to her desire.
For she within he head
did cast before no doubt,
She little knew the close attempt,
her nurce child went about.
The nurce departed once,
the chamber door shut close,
Assured that no living wight,
her doing might disclose,
She powered forth into
the vyole of the friar,
Water out of a silver ewer,
that on the board stood by her,
The slepy mixture made,
fair Juliet does it hyde,
Under her bolster soft, and so
unto her bed she hyed:
Where diverse nouel thoughts
arise within her head,
And she is so environed
about with deadly dred,
That what before she had
resolved undoubtedly,
That same she calls into doubt,
and lying doutfully,
Whilst honest love did strive
with dred of dedly pain,
With hands ywrong, and weping eyes,
thus began she to complain.
What, is there any one
beneth the heavens hye,
So much unfortunate as I,
so much past hope as I?
What, am not I my self
of all that yet were borne,
The depest drenched in despair,
and most in Fortunes skorne?
For lo the world for me,
has nothing else to find,
Beside mishap and wretchedness,
and anguish of the mind,
Since that the cruel cause
of my unhappiness,
Has put me to this sudden plonge,
and brought to such distres,
As (to the end I may
my name and conscience save,)
I must deuowre the mixed drink,
that by me here I have.
Whose woorking and whose force
as yet I do not know,
And of this piteous plaint began
another doubt to grow.
What do I know (quoth she)
if that this powder shall
Sooner or later then it should
or else not work at all?
And then my craft descride,
as open as the day,
The peoples tale and laughing stock,
shall I remain for aye.
And what know I (quoth she)
if serpents odious,
And other beasts and worms that are
of nature venomous,
That wonted are to lurk,
in dark caves under ground,
And commonly as I have heard
in dead men's tombs are found,
Shall harm me yea or nay,
where I shall lie as ded,
Or how shall I that always have
in so fresh air been bred
Endure the loathsome stink
of such an heaped store
Of carkases, not yet consumde
and bones that long before
Intombed were, where I
my sleping place shall have,
Where all my auncesters do rest,
my kindreds common grave.
Shall not the friar and
my Romeus when they come,
Find me (if I awake before)
ystified in the tomb?
And whtlst she in these thoughts
does dwell somewhat to long,
The force of her ymagining,
anon did ware so strong,
That she surmysde she saw
out of the hollow vaulte,
(A griefly thing to look upon,)
the carkas of Tybalt,
Right in the self same sort,
that she few days before
Had seen him in his blood embrewde,
to death eke wounded sore.
And then, when she again
within her self had wayde,
That quick she should be buried there,
and by his side be laid
All comfortles, for she
shall living feere have none
But many a rotten carkas, and
full many a naked bone:
Her dainty tender parts
began sheuer all for dred,
Her golden hears did stand upright,
upon her chillish head.
Then pressed with the fear
that she there lived in,
A sweat as cold as mountain yse,
pearst through her tender skin,
That with the moisture has
wet every part of hers,
And more besides, she vainly thinks,
whilst vainly thus she fears,
A thousand bodies dead
have compast her about,
And lest they will dismember her,
she greatly stands in dout,
But when she felt her strength
began to wear away,
By little and little, and in her heart
her fear increased ay:
Dreading that weakness might
or foolish cowardice
Hinder the execution of
the purposde enterprise,
As she had frantike been,
in have the glass she cought,
And up she drank the mixture quite.
withouten farther thought.
Then on her breast she crossed
her arms long and small,
And so her senses failing her,
into a trance did fall.
And when that Phoebus bright
heaued up his seemly head,
And from the East in open skies
his glistring rays dispred
The nurce unshut the door,
for she the key did keep,
And douting she had slept to long,
she thought to break her sleep:
First, softly did she call,
then louder thus did cry,
Lady, you sleep to long, (the Earl)
will raise you by and by.
But well away, in vain
unto the deaf she calls,
She thinks to speak to Juliet,
but speaks to the walls.
If all the dreadful noise,
that might on earth be found,
Or on the roaring seas, or if
the dreadful thunders sound,
Had blown into her ears,
I think they could not make,
The sleping wight before the time
by any means awake:
So were the sprites of life
shut up, and senses thrald,
Wherewith the seely careful nurce,
was wondrously apalde.
She thought to daw her now
as she had done of old,
But lo, she found her parts were stiff.
and more then marble cold,
Neither at mouth nor nose,
found she recourse of breath,
Two certain arguments were these,
of her untimely death.
Wherefore as one distraught,
she to her mother ran,
With scratched face, and hear betorne,
but no word speak she can.
At last (with much a do)
dead (quoth she) is my child,
Now out alas (the mother cryde)
and as a Tiger wild,
Whose whelps whilst she is gonne
out of her den to pray,
The hunter gredy of his game,
does kill or carry away:
So, rageing forth she ran,
unto her Iuliets bed,
And there she found her derling, and
her only comfort ded.
Then shriked she out as loud,
as serve her would her breath,
And then (that pity was to hear)
thus cryde she out on death.
Ah cruel death (quoth she)
that thus against all right
Have ended my felicity,
and robde my hearts delight,
Do now thy worst to me,
once wreake thy wrath for all.
Even in despite I cry to thee
thy vengeance let thou fall.
Whereto stay I (alas,)
since Juliet is gone?
Whereto live I since she is dead,
except to wayle and moan?
Alack dear child, my tears
for thee shall never cease,
Even as my days of life increase,
so shall my plaint increase.
Such store of sorrow shall
afflict my tender heart,
That dedly panges when they assail
shall not augment my smart.
Then began she so to sobbe,
it seemde her heart would brast,
And while she cries thus, behold
the father at the last,
The County Paris, and
of gentilmen a route,
And ladies of Verona town,
and country round about,
Both kindreds and alies,
thet her a pace have preast,
For by their presence there they sought
to honor so the feast,
But when the heavy news
the hydden geastes did hear,
So much they mournd, that who had seen
their countnance and their cheer,
Might easily have indgde,
by that that they had seen,
That day the day of wrath, and eke
of pity have been.
But more then all the rest
the fathers heart was so
Smit with the heavy news, and so
shut up with sudden woe,
That he ne had the power
his daughter to bewepe,
Ne yet to speak, but long is forsd,
his tears and plaint to keep.
In all the have he has
for skillful leaches sent,
And hearing of her passed life,
they judge with one assent,
The cause of this her death
was inward care and thought,
And then with double force again
the doubled sorrows wrought.
If ever there has been
a lamentable day,
A day ruthful, unfortunate,
and fatal, then I say,
The same was it in which,
through Veron town was spread,
The woeful news how Juliet
was sterued in her bed.
For so she was bemonde,
both of the young and old,
That it might seem to him that would
the commen plaint behold,
That all the commen wealth
did stand in ieopardy,
So universal was the plaint,
so piteous was the cry.
For lo, beside her shape,
and native bewties hew,
With which, like as she grew in age,
her virtues praises grew.
She was also so wise,
so lowly, and so mydle:
That even from the hory head,
unto the witles child,
She wan the hearts of all,
so that there was not one,
Ne great ne small, but did that day
her wretched state bemone.
Whilst Juliet slept, and whilst
the other wepen thus:
Our friar Lawrence has by this,
sent one to Romeus.
A friar of his house,
there never was a better,
He trusted him even as himself,
to whom he gave a letter:
In which, he written had,
of every thing at length,
That past twixt Juliet and him,
and of the powders strength.
The next night after that,
he wills him to comme
To help to take his Juliet
out of the hollow toombe.
For by that time, the drink
he says will cease to work,
And for one night his wife and he
within his cell shall loorke.
Then shall he carry her
to Mantua away,
(Till sickell Fortune favor him)
disguisde in man's array.
This letter closde he sendes
to Romeus by his brother:
He charge him that in no case
he give it any other.
Apace our friar John
to Mantua him hyes,
And for because in Italy
it is a wonted gyse,
That friars in the town
should seeldome walk alone,
But of their covent ay should be
accompanide with one:
Of his profession straight
a house he fyndeth out.
In mind to take some friar with him,
to walk the town about.
But entered once, he might
not issue out again,
For that a brother of the house,
a day before or twain.
Dyed of the plague (a sickness which
they greatly fear and hate)
So were the brethren charged to keep
within their covent gate,
Bard of their fellowship,
that in the town do won,
The town folk eke commanded are,
the friars house to shonne:
Till they that had the care of health,
their fredome should renew,
Whereof, as you shall shortly hear,
a mischief great there grew.
The friar by this restraint,
beset with dred and sorrow,
Not knowing what the letters held,
differd until the morrow:
And then he thought in time
to send to Romeus,
But whilst at Mantua where he was,
these dooinges framed thus,
The town of Iuliets birth
was wholly busied,
About her obsequies, to see
their darlyng buried.
Now is the parents mirth
quite changed into moan,
And now to sorrow is retornde
the joy of every one.
And now the wedding weeds
for mourning weeds they change,
And Hymene into a Dyrge,
alas it seems strange.
In stead of marriage gloves,
now funeral gloves they have,
And whom they should see married,
they follow to the grave.
The feast that should have been
of pleasure and of joy,
Has every dish, and cup, filled full
of sorrow and annoye.
Now throughout Italy
this commen use they have,
That all the best of every stock
are earthed in one grave.
For every household, if
it be of any fame,
Does bylde a tomb, or dig a vault
that bears the housholdes name.
Wherein (if any of
that kindred hap to dye)
They are bestowde, else in the same
no other corpse may lie.
The Capilets, her corpse
in such a one did lay,
Where Tybalt slain of Romeus,
was laid the other, day:
An other use there is,
that whosoever dies,
Borne to their church with open face,
upon the beer he lies
In wonted weed attyrde,
not wrapped in winding sheet,
So, as by chance he walked abroad,
our Romeus man did meet
His masters wise, the sight
with sorrow straight did wound
His honest heart, with tears he saw
her lodged under ground.
And for he had been sent
to Verone for a spy,
The doings of the Capilets
by wisdom to descrye,
And for he knew her death
did tooch his master most,
(Alas) too soon, with heavy news
he byed away in post:
And in his house he found
his master Romeus,
Where he besprent with many fears,
began to speak him thus.
Sir, unto you of late
is chanced so great a harm,
That sure except with constancy
you seek your self to arm,
I fear that straight you will
brethe out your latter breath,
And I most wretched wight shall be
thoccasion of your death.
Know sir that yesterday
my lady and your wife,
I wot not by what sudden grefe,
has made exchange of life:
And for because on earth,
she found naught but unrest,
In heaven has she sought to find
a place of quiet rest.
And with these weping eyes
my self have seen her laid
Within the tomb of Capilets,
and here withal he stayde,
This sudden message sound
sent forth with sighs and tears,
Our Romeus received too soon
with open listening ears,
And thereby has sonke in
such sorrow in his heart,
That lo, his sprite annoyed sore
with torment and with smart,
Was like to break out of
his prison house perforce,
And that he might fly after hers,
would leave the massy corce.
But earnest love that will
not fail him till hie end,
This fond and sudden fantasy
into his head did send:
That if nere unto her
he offered up his breath,
That then an hundred thousand parts
more glorious were his death,
Eke should his painful heart
a great deal more be eased,
And more also (he vainly thought)
his lady better pleased.
Wherefore, when he his face
has washed with water cleene,
Lest that the staynes of dried tears,
might on his cheeks be seen,
And so his sorrow should
of every one be spyde,
Which he with all his care did seek
from every one to hyde:
Straight weary of the house,
he walks forth abroad,
His servant at the masters hest
in chamber still abode:
And then fro streate to streate,
he wandreth up and down,
To see if he in any place
may find in all the town,
A salve meet for his sore,
an oil fit for his wound,
And seeking long (alac too soon)
the thing he sought, he found.
An Apothecary sat
vnbusied at his door,
Whom by his heavy countenance
he gessed to be poor,
And in his shop he saw
his boxes were but few,
And in his window (of his wares)
there was so small a show,
Wherefore our Romeus
assuredly has thought,
What by no friendship could be got,
with money should be bought.
For nedy lack is like
the poor man to compel,
To sell that which the cities law
forbids him to sell.
Then by the hand he drew
the nedy man apart,
And with the sight of glitrring gold
inflamed has his heart,
Take fifty crowns of gold
(quoth he) I give them thee*
So that before I part from hence
thou straight deliver me,
Sum poison strong, that may
in less then half an hour,
Kill him whose wretched hap shall be
the potion to deuowre.
The wretch by couetise
is won, and does assent,
To sell the thing, whose sale ere long*
too late he does repent.
In have he poison sought,
and closely he it bound,
And then began with whispering voice
thus in his ear to round,
Fair sir (quoth he) be sure,
this is the speeding gere,
And more there is then you shall need,
for half of that is there,
Will serve, I undertake,
in less then half an hour,
To kill the strongest man alive,
such is the poisons power,
Then Romeus somewhat easd
of one part of his care,
Within his bosom puts up
his dear unthrifty ware.
Retorning home again,
he sent his man away,
To Verone town, and charge him,
that he without delay,
Provide both instruments,
to open wide the toombe,
And lights to show him Juliet,
and stay (till he shall comme.)
Nere to the place whereas
his loving wife does rest,
And charge him not to bewray
the dolours of his breast.
Peter, these heard, his leave
both of his master take,
Betyme he commes to town, such have
the paynfull man did make.
And then with busy care
he seeks to fulfill,
But does dysclose unto no wight
his woeful masters will.
Would God he had herein
broken his masters hest,
Would God that to the friar he had
dysclosed all his breast.
But Romeus, the while,
with many a dedly thought,
Provoked much, has caused ynke
and paper to be brought,
And in few lines he did
of all his love dyscoorse,
How by the friars help, and by
the knowledge of the noorse,
The wedlock knot was knyt,
and by what mean that night
And many more he did enjoy,
his happy hearts delight.
Where he the poison bought,
and how his life should end,
And so his wailefull tragedy
the wretched man has pend.
The letters close and sealed,
directed to his sire:
He locketh in his purse, and then,
a post horse does he hyre.
When he approached nere,
he waxely lighted down,
And even with the shade of night,
he entered Verone town,
Where he has found his man
waiting when he should comme,
With lantern and with instruments,
to open Iuliets toomme.
Help Peter, help quod he,
help to remove the stone,
And straight when I am gone fro thee
my Juliet to bemone:
See that thou get thee hence,
and on the pain of death,
I charge thee that thou comme not nere,
while I abide beneath,
Ne seek thou not to let
thy masters enterprise,
Which he has fully purposed
to do in any wise.
Take there a letter, which
as soon as he shall rise,
Present it in the morning to
my loving fathers eyes.
Which unto him perhaps
far pleasanter shall seem,
Then either I do mind to say,
or thy gross head can deem.
Now Peter that knew not,
the purpose of his heart,
Obediently a little way
withdrew himself apart,
And then our Romeus,
(the vault stone set upright)
Descended down, and in his hand,
he bare the candle light.
And then with piteous eye,
the body of his wife,
He began behold, who surely was
the organ of his life.
For whom unhappy now
he is, but erst was blyst:
He watered her with tears, and then
an hundred times her kyst.
And in his folded arms,
full straightly he her plight,
But no way could his greedy eyes
be filled with her sight,
His fearful hands he laid
upon her stomach cold,
And them on diverse parts beside,
the woeful wight did hold.
But when he could not find
the signs of life he sought,
Out of his cursed box he drew
the poison that he bought.
Whereof, he gredely
deuowrde the greater part,
And then he cryde with dedly sigh,
fetched from his mourning heart:
Oh Juliet, of whom
the world unworthy was,
From which, for worlds unworthiness
thy worthy ghost did pass:
What death more pleasant could
my heart wish to abide,
Then that which here it suffers now,
so nere thy friendly side.
Or else so glorious tomb,
how could my youth have craved.
As in one self same vaulte with thee
happily to be ingraued?
What Epitaph more worth,
or half so excellent,
To consecrate my memory,
could any man inuente
As this, our mutuell, and
our piteous sacrifice
Of life, set light for love, but while
he talks in this wise,
And thought as yet a while
his dolors to enforce,
His tender heart began to faint,
pressed with the venoms force:
Which little and little began
to ouercomme his heart,
And whilst his busy eyne he threw
about to every part:
He saw hard by the corce
of sleping Juliet,
Bold Tybalts carkas dead, which was
not all consumed yet,
To whom (as having life)
in this sort speaks he,
Ah cousin dear Tybalt, whereso
thy restles sprite now be,
With stretched hands to thee
for mercy now I cry,
For that before thy kindly hour
I forced thee to dye.
But if with quenched life,
not quenched be thine ire.
But with reuengeing lust as yet
thy heart be set on fire:
What more amends, or cruel
wreke desyrest thou?
To see on me, then this which here
is showed forth to thee now?
Who reft by force of arms
from thee thy living breath,
The same with his own hand (thou see)
does poison himself to death.
And for he caused thee
in tomb too soon to lie,
Too soon also, younger then thou
himself he lays by.
These said, when he began feel,
the poisons force prevail,
And little and little mastred life,
for aye began to fail,
Kneeling upon his knees,
he said with voice full low,
Lord Christ that so to ransom me
rescendedst long ago,
Out of thy fathers bosom,
and in the virgins womb,
Did put on flesh, Oh let my plaint
out of this hollow toombe,
Perce through the air, and grant
my suit may favor find.
Take pity on my sinful and
my poor afflicted mind.
For well enough I know,
this body is but clay,
Naught but a mass of sin, to frail,
and subject to decay.
Then pressed with extreme grief,
he threw with so great force,
His ouerpressed parts upon
his ladies wayled corpse:
That now his wekened heart,
weakened with torments past,
Unable to abide this pang,
the sharpest and the last:
Remained quite deprived,
of sense and kindly strength,
And so the long imprisond soul,
has freedom won at length.
Ah cruel death, too soon,
too soon was this deuorce,
Twixt youthful Romeus heavenly sprite,
and his fair earthy corse.
The friar that knew what time
the powder had been taken,
Knew eke the very instant, when
the sleper should awaken.
But wondering that he could
no kind of answer hear,
Of letters, which to Romeus
his fellow friar did bear:
Out of saint Frauncis church
himself alone did fare,
And for the opening of the tomb,
meet instruments he bare:
Approaching nigh the place,
and seeing there the light,
Great horror felt he in his heart,
by strange and sudden sight,
Till Peter (Romeus man)
his coward heart made bold,
When of his masters being there,
the certain news he told:
There has he been (quoth he)
this half hour at the least,
And in this time I dare well say
his plaint has still increast.
Then both they entered in,
where they (alas) did find,
The bretheles corpse of Romeus,
forsaken of the mind.
Where they have made such moan,
as they may best conceue,
That have with perfect friendship loved,
whose friend, feeres death did reave.
But whilst with piteous playnt,
they Romeus fate be weep,
An hour too late fair Juliet
awaked out of sleep.
And much amasde to see
in tomb so great a light,
She wist not if she saw a dream,
or sprite that walkd by night.
But cumming to her self,
she knew them, and said thus,
What friar Lawrence, is it you?
where is my Romeus?
And then the ancient friar,
that greatly stood in fear,
Lest if they lingered over long,
they should be taken theare,
In few plain words, the whole
that was betyde he told,
And with his fingar showed his corpse
out stretched, stiff, and cold,
And then persuaded her
with patience to abide
This sudden great mischaunce, and says
that he will soon provide
In sum religious house
for her a quiet place,
Where she may spend the rest of life,
and where in time percase
She may with wisdoms mean,
measure her mourning breast,
And unto her tormented soul
call back exiled rest.
But lo, as soon as she
had cast her ruthful eye
On Romeus face, that pale and wan,
fast by her side did lie,
Straight way she did unstop
the conduites of her tears,
And out they gushe, with cruel hand
she tare her golden hears.
But when she neither could
her swelling sorows wage,
Ne yet her tender heart abide
her sickness furious rage:
Fallen on his corpse, she lay
long panting on his face,
And then with all her force and strength,
the ded corpse did embrace,
As though with sighs, with sobs,
with force and busy pain,
She would him raise, and hun restore
from death to life again:
A thousand times she kissed
his month as cold as stone,
And it vnkist again as often,
then began she thus to moan.
Ah pleasant prop of all
my thoughts, ah only ground
Of all the sweet delights, that yet
in all my life I found.
Did such assured trust
within thy heart repose:
That in this place, and at this time,
this churchyard thou have chose?
Betwixt the arms of me,
thy perfect loving make?
And thus by means of me to end
thy life, and for my sake?
Even in the flowring of
thy youth, when unto thee,
Thy life most dear (as to the most)
and pleasant ought to be:
How could this tender corpse
withstand the cruel fight
Of furious death, that wonts to fray
the steutest with his sight:
How could thy dainty youth
agree with willing heart,
In this so foul infected place
(to dwell) where now thou art.
Where spiteful Fortune has
appaynted thee to be,
The dainty food of greedy woormes,
unworthy sure of thee.
Alas, alas, alas,
what neded now a new,
My wonted sorrows doubled twice
again thus to renew?
Which both the time, and eke
my pacient long abode,
Should now at length have quenched quite,
and under foot have trod.
Ah wretch, and caytiue that
I am, even when I thought
To find my painful passions salve:
I mist the thing I sought,
And to my mortal harm,
the fatal knyfe I ground,
That gave to me so deep, so wide,
so cruel dedly wound.
Ah thou most fortunate,
and most unhappy tomb,
For thou shall bear from age to age,
witness in time to comme,
Of the most perfect leage,
betwixt a pair of lovers,
That were the most unfortunate,
and fortunate of others:
Receive the latter sigh,
receive the latter pang,
Of the most cruel of cruel slaves,
that wrath and death ay wrang.
And when our Juliet would
continue still her moan,
The friar and the servant fied
and left her there alone.
For they a sudden noise,
fast by the place did hear,
And lest they might be taken there,
greatly they stood in fear.
When Juliet saw her self
left in the vaulte alone,
That freely she might work her will,
for let or stay was none:
Then once for all, she took
the cause of all her harms,
The body dead of Romeus,
and claspd it in her arms,
Then she with earnest kiss,
sufficiently did prove,
That more then by the fear of death,
she was attaint by love.
And then past deadly fear,
for life ne had she care,
With hasty hand she did draw out,
the dagger that he ware.
O welcome death (quoth she)
end of unhappiness,
That also art beginning of
assured happiness:
Fear not to darte me now,
thy stripe no longer stay,
Prolong no longer now my life,
I hate this long delay.
For straight my parting sprite,
out of this carkas fled,
At ease shall find my Romeus sprite,
among so many ded.
And thou my loving lord,
Romeus my trusty feer,
If knowledge yet do rest in thee,
if thou these words do here:
Receue thou her whom thou
did love so lawfully,
That causd (alas) thy violent death
although unwillingly.
And therefore willingly
offers to thee her ghost,
To thend that no wight else but thou,
might have just cause to boste
Thinioying of my love,
which ay I have reserved,
Free from the rest, bound unto thee,
that have it well deserved.
That so our parted sprites,
from light that we see here,
In place of endless light and bliss,
may ever live yfere.
These said, her ruthlesse hand
through gyrt her valiant heart.
Ah Ladies help with tears to wayle,
the ladies dedly smart.
She groans she stretches out
her simmes, she shuttes her eyes,
And from her corpse the sprite does fiye.
what should I say: she dies.
The watchemen of the town,
the whilst are passed by,
And through the grates the candel light
within the tomb they spy:
Whereby they did suppose,
inchaunters to be comme,
That with prepared instruments
had opend wide the tomb,
In purpose to abuse
the bodies of the ded,
Which by their science aid abusde
do stand them often in sted.
Their curious hearts desire,
the truth hereof to know,
Then they by certain steps descend,
where they do find below
In clasped arms ywrapt
the husband and the wife,
In whom as yet they seemd to see
sum certain marks of life.
But when more curiously
with leisure they did view,
The certainty of both their deaths,
assuredly they knew.
Then here and there so long
with careful ere they sought,
That at the length hidden they found
the murthrers, so they thought.
In dongeon deep that night
they lodgde them under ground,
The next day do they tell the prince
the mischefe that they found.
The news was by and by
throughout the town dyspred
Both of the taking of the friar,
and of the two found ded.
Thither might you have seen
whole housholdes forth to run.
For to the tomb where they did hear
this wonder strange was done,
The great, the small, the rich,
the poor, the young, the old,
With hasly pace do run to see,
but rue when they beheld.
And that the murderers
to all men might be known,
Like as the murders brute abroad
through all the town was blown.
The prince did straight ordain,
the corses that were found
Should be set forth upon a stage,
hye raised from the ground,
Right in the self same form,
(shewde forth to all men's sight)
That in the hollow valt they had
been found that other night.
And eke that Romeus man,
and friar Lawrence should
Be openly examined,
for else the people would
Have murmured, or faynd
there were some wayghty cause,
Why openly they were not calde,
and so convict by laws.
The holy friar now,
and reverent by his age,
In great reproach set to the show
upon the open stage.
(A thing that ill beseemde,
a man of silver hears)
His beard as white as milk he bathes,
with great fast falling tears.
Whom straight the dreadful Judge
commands to declare
Both how this murder has been done,
and who the murthrers are.
For that he nere the tomb
was found at hours unfit,
And had with him those iron tools,
for such a purpose fit:
The friar was of lively
sprite, and free of speech,
The Judges words appald him not,
ne were his wits to seeche.
But with advised heed,
a while first did he stay,
And then with bold assured voice,
aloude thus began he say.
My lords, there is not one
among you, set together,
So that (affection set aside)
by wisdom he consider
My former passed life,
and this my extreme age,
And eke this heavy sight, the wreke,
of frantike Fortunes rage,
But that amassed much,
does wonder at this change,
So great, so suddenly befalne,
unlooked for, and strange.
For I, that in the space
of.lx. years and ten,
Since first I did begin to soon
to lead my life with men,
And with the worlds vain things
my self I did acquaint,
Was never yet, in open place
at any time attaynt
With any crime, in weight,
as heavy as a rushe,
Ne is there any stander by,
can make me gylty blushe,
(Although before the face
of God, and do confess,
My self to be the sinfulst wretch
of all this mighty press.)
When readiest I am,
and likeliest to make
My great account, which no man else
for me shall undertake:
When worms, the earth, and death
do cite me every hour,
Tappeare before the judgment seat
of everlasting power,
And falling ripe I step
upon my graves brinke:
Even then am I most wretched wight
(as each of you does think.)
Through my most heinous deed,
with hedlong sway thrown down,
In greatest danger of my life,
and damage of renown.
The spring, whence in your head,
this new conceit does rise,
And in your heart increases still
your vain and wrong surmise:
May be the hugenes of
these tears of mine (percase,)
That so abundantly down fall,
by either side my face.
As though the memory
in scriptures were not kept,
That Christ our savior himself
for ruth and pity wept.
And more whosoever will read,
ywritten shall he find,
That tears are as true messengers
of man's vngyltie mind,
Orels (a liker proof)
that I am in the crime,
You say these present yrone are,
and the suspected time.
As though all hours alike
had not been made above,
Did Christ not say the day had twelve?
whereby he sought to prone,
That no respect of hours,
ought justly to be had,
But at all times men have the choice
of doing good or bad.
Even as the sprite of God,
the hearts of men does guide,
Or as it leaves them to stray
from Virtues path aside.
As for the yrons that
were taken in my hand,
As now I deem, I need not seek,
to make ye understand,
To what use iron first
was made, when it began:
How of it self it helps not,
ne yet can help a man.
The thing that hurts, is
the malice of his will,
That such indifferent things is wont
to use and order ill.
Thus much I thought to say,
to cause you so to know,
That neither these my piteous tears,
though nere so fast they flow.
Ne yet these iron tools,
nor the suspected time,
Can justly prout the murder done,
or damn me of the crime,
No one of these has power,
ne power have all the three,
To make me other then I am,
how so I seem to be.
But sure my conscience
(if so my gylt deserve)
For an appeacher, witness, and
a hangman eke should serve.
For through mine age, whose hears,
of long time since were hoar,
And credyt great that I was in,
with you in time to fore,
And eke the soiorne short
that I on earth must make,
That every day and hour do look
my journey hence to take,
My conscience inwardly,
should more torment me thrice,
Then all the outward deadly pain
that all you could deuyse.
But (God I praise) I feel
no worm that gnaweth me,
And from remorses pricking sting,
I joy that I am free.
I mean as touching this,
wherewith you troubled are,
Wherewith you should be troubled still
if I my speech should spare.
But to the end I may
set all your hearts at rest,
And pluck out all the scrupuls that
are rooted in your breast:
Which might perhaps henceforth
increasing more and more
Within your conscience also,
increase your curelesse sore:
I swear by yonder heavens,
whither I hope to clym,
And for a witness of my words,
my heart attesteth him,
Whose mighty hand does welde
them in their vyolent sway,
And on the rolling stormy seas
the heavy earth does stay:
That I will make a short
and eke a true dyscourse
Of this most woeful Tragedy,
and show both thend and sourse
Of their unhappy death,
which you perchance no less
Will wonder at, then they (alas)
poor lovers in distress,
Tormented much in mind
not forcing lively breath,
With strong and patient heart did yield
themself to cruel death.
Such was the mutual love,
wherein the burned both:
And of their promyst frendshippes faith,
so stedy was the troth.
And then the ancient friar
began to make dyscourse,
Even from the first of Romeus,
and Iuliets amors.
How first by sodayn sight,
the one the other chose,
And twirt them self did knitte the knotte*
which only death might lose.
And how within a while,
with hotter love oppressed,
Under confessions cloak, to him,
them self they have adrest.
And how with solemn oaths
they have protested both,
That they in heart are married
by promise and by oath.
And that except he grant
the rytes of church to give,
They shall be forced by earnest love,
in sinful state to live.
Which thing when he had wayde,
and when he understood,
That the agreement twixt them twaynt
was lawful honest, good,
And all things peysed well,
it seemed meet to be,
For like they were of nobleness,
age, riches, and degree:
Hoping that so at length,
ended might be the strife,
Of Montagewes and Capelets,
that led in hate their life.
Thinking to work a work
well pleasing in Gods sight,
In secret shrift he wedded them,
and they the self same night
Made up the marriage
in house of Capelet,
As well does know (if she be asked,)
the nurce of Juliet.
He told how Romeus fled,
for reuing Tybalts life,
And how the whilst, Paris the Earl
was offered to his wife.
And how the lady did,
so great a wrong dysdayne,
And how to shrift unto his church
she came to him again:
And how she fell flat down
before his feet aground,
And how she swear her hand,
and blody knife should wound
Her harmeles heart, except,
that he some mean did find
To dysappoynt the Earls attempt,
and spotles save her mind.
Wherefore he does conclude,
(although that long before)
By thought of death, and age, he had
refusde for evermore.
The hidden arts which he
delighted in, in youth,
Yet won by her importunenes,
and by his inward ruth,
And fearing lest she would
her cruel vow dyscharge,
His closed conscience he had
opened and set at large.
And rather did he choose
to suffer for one time,
His soul to be spotted somdeale
with small and easy crime,
Then that the lady should,
(weary of living breath)
Murder her self, and danger much
her seely soul by death.
Wherefore, his ancient arts
again he putres in ure,
A certain powder gave he her
(...) made her sleep so sure,
That they her held for dead,
and how that friar John
With letters sent to Romeus,
to Mantua is gone,
Of whom he knows not
as yet, what is becomme,
And how that dead he found his friend
within her kindreds tomb.
He thinks with poison strong,
for care the young man sterued,
Supposing Juliet dead, and how,
that Juliet has carved
With Romeus dagger drawn
her heart and yielded breath,
Desirous to accompany
her lover after death.
And how they could not save
her, so they were afeard,
And hid them self, dreding the noise
of watchmen that they heard.
And for the proof of this
his tale, he does desyer
The Judge, to send forthwith
to ^^ntus for the friar,
To learn his cause of stay,
and eke to read his letter,
And more beside, to thend that they
might judge his cause the better,
He prays them depose
the nurce of Juliet,
And Romeus man, whom at unawares
beside the tomb he met.
Then Peter not so much
as erst he was, dysmayd,
My lords (quoth he) too true is all,
that friar Laurence said.
And when my master went
into my mystres grave,
This letter that I offer you,
unto me then he gave.
Which he himself did write
as I do understand,
And charged me to offer them
unto his fathers hand.
The opened packet does
conteyne in it the same,
That erst the skillful friar said,
and eke the wretches name
That had at his request,
the dedly poison sold,
The price of it, and why he bought,
his letters plain have told.
The case unfolded so,
and open now it lies,
That they could wish no better proof*
save seeing it with their eyes.
So orderly all things
were told and tried out,
That in the prease there was not one*
that stood at all in doubt.
The wyser sort to council
called by Escalus,
Have given advise, and Escalus
sagely decrees thus.
The nurse of Juliet,
is banished in her age,
Because that from the parents she
did hyde the marriage.
Which might have wrought much good,
hau it in time been known,
Where now by her concealing it,
a mischief great is grown.
And Peter, for he did
obey his masters hest,
In woonted freedom had good leave
to lead his life in rest.
Thapothecary, high
is hanged by the throat,
And for the pains he took with him,
the hangman had his cote.
But now what shall betyde
of this gray bearded sire?
Of friar Lawrence thus araynde,
that good barefooted fryre.
Because that many times
he woorthely did serve
The commen wealth, and in his life
was never found to swerue:
He was discharged quyte,
and no mark of defame,
Did seem to blot, or touch at all,
the honor of his name.
But of him self he went
into an Hermitage,
Two miles from Veron town, where he
in prayers past forth his age.
Till that from earth to heaven,
his heavenly sprite did fly,
Five years he lived an Hermit, and
an Hermit did he dye.
The stranngenes of the chance,
when tried was the truth
The Montagewes and Capelets
has moved so to ruth,
That with their emptyed tears,
their choler and their rage,
Was emptied quite, and they whose wrath
no wisdom could assuage,
Nor threatening of the prince,
ne mind of murders done:
At length (so mighty Jove it would)
by pitye they are won.
And lest that length of time
might from our minds remove,
The memory of so perfect, sound,
and so approved love.
The bodies dead removed
from vaulte where they did dye,
In stately tomb, on pillars great,
of marble raise they hye.
On every side above,
were set and eke beneath,
Great store of cunning Epitaphes,
in honor of their death.
And even at this day
the tomb is to be seen.
So that among the monumentes
that in Verona been,
There is no monument
more worthy of the sight:
Then is the tomb of Juliet,
and Romeus her knight.
