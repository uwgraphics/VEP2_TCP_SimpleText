The praise of Sailors, here set forth, with their hard fortunes which do
befall them on the Seas, when Land-men sleep safe in their Beds.
To a pleasant new tune.


AS I lay musing in my bed,
full warm and well at ease,
I thought upon the lodging hard
poor Sailors have at Seas.
They bide it out with hunger and cold,
and many a bitter blast,
And many a time constrained they are
for to cut down their Past,
Their victuals and their Ordinance,
and ought else that they have,
They throw it ouer-boord with speed,
and seek their lives to save.
When as the raging Seas do foam,
and lofty winds do blow,
The Saylors they go to the top,
when Land-men stay below.
Our Masters Mate takes Helm in hand,
his Course he steeres full well,
When as the lofty winds do blow,
and raging Seas do swell.
Our Master to his Compass goes,
so well he plies his charge:
He sends a Youth to the Top amain,
for to ^^^^ing the Yeards.
The Boatson he is under the Deck,
a man of courage bold;
To th'top toth'top, my lively Lads,
hold fast my hearts of gold.
The Pilot he stands on the Claine,
with Line and Lead to sound,
To see how far and near they are
from any dangerous ground.
It is a testimonial good,
we are not far from land,
There sits a Mermaid on the Rock,
with Comb and Glass in hand.
Our Captain he is on the Poope,
a man of might and power,
And looks when raging Seas do gape
our bodies to devour.
Our royal Ship is run to rack,
that was so stout and trim,
And some are put unto their ^ifts,
either to sink or swim.
The Second Part.
To the same tune.


OUr Ship that was before so good,
and eke likewise so trim,
Is now with raging Seas grown leakt,
and water fast comes in.
The Quarter master is a man,
so well his charge plies he,
He calls them to the Pumpe amain,
to keep their leakeship free.
And many dangers likewise they
do many times endure,
When as they meet their enemies,
that come with might and power*
And seek likewise from them to take
their lives and eke their goods:
Thus Saylors they sometimes endure,
upon the surging floods.
But when as they do come to Land,
and homewards safe return,
They are most kind good fellows all,
and scorn ever to mourn.
And likewise they will call for Wine,
and score it on the post:
For Sailors they are honest men,
and will pay well their Oast.


For Saylors they be honest men,
and they do take great pains,
When landed men and rufling lads,
do rob them of their gains.
Our Saylors they work night and day,
their manhood for to try,
When landed men and ruffling Iacks,
do in their Cabines lie.
Therefore let all good minded men,
give ear unto my Song,
And say also as well as I,
Saylors deserve no wrong.
This have I done for Saylors sakes,
in token of good will:
If ever I can do them good,
I will be ready still.
God bless them eke by Sea and land,
and also other men;
And as my Song beginning had,
so must it have an end.
FINIS.
