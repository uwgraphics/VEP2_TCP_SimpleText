The Contents of the whole BOOK.
1 IN the first Treatise, is showed what cause we had of sorowing for the
loss of our late renowned Sovereign; and thereupon called The Mourning Weed.

2 In the the second Treatise, are set forth the great and undoubted hopes of
our godly rejoicing, upon the proclamation and enjoying of our most famous and
rightful King; who is the ground of our rejoicing; and herfore called The
Mornings Joy, the night of heaviness upon the death of our late beloved Queen
being ouerpassed.

3 In the third and last Treatise, is noted and showed the duty of Subjects,
and how they should study in all thankfulness to requite by all means possible,
so great a blessing, by fearing of God, and honoring of their Prince; to Gods
glory, and comfort of our King: and for that entitled, The Kings Rejoicing.
