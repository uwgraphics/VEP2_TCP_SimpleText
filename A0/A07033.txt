A pithie, And most earnest exhortation, concerning the estate of
Christiandome, together with the means to preserve and defend the same;

DEDICATED To al christian Kings Princes and Potentates, with all other the
estates of Christiandome:

By a German Gentleman, a lover of his Country.

Printed at Antwerpe. ANNO D. 1583.

To all Christian Kings, Princes and Potentates, with all other the estates of
Christendom.
IF we would in the balance of understanding weye and ponder what soever the
councels and actions which we conceive in other men's affairs and business, we
should no dout build the whole estate of our life upon a more assured
foundation, and with all eschew an infinite number of calamities as well public
as particular which now we do incur. For the examples of other men's perils
and losses, being the most faithful teachers and expert guids of this present
life, would make us more wary and stand us in stead of a rule whereby to
direct al our enterprises, determinations, and the conduct of al our affairs.
This kind of wisdom have the most circumspect in all ages, accounted to be,
not only of the greatest profit, but also most mild and tolerable, and
which does yield greatest contentation to the practitioners of the same.

Howbeit it happens for the most part, that in the gouernm^et and direction
of our affairs we be so altered, either with hope, or fear, or some other
humane frailty or infirmity, that we can not comprehend or forsee the mischief
which eue^ at hand hangs over our heads, until it has utterly snared and
caught us through some sudden and unlooked for fall and ruin, and so we do
fully suffer the punishment due to our dulnes and negligence: Whereby
notwithstanding we do many times wisely enter into the consideration of other
men's affairs, yet in case our selves be to eschew the like perilles, it falls
ordinarily out, that either in pondring the waightines of the matter, either
amazed with doubt of the uncertain event thereof, either waiting that others
first set to their hands, either hoping time enough to be able to provide
therefore, we do so prolo^g our business that the commodity and occasion escaping
us, all this goodly wisdom, and wary forecast that we had conceived in the
consideration of the examples of other men's mischa^ces, vanishes into smoke
and so suddenly wereth away, that weca^not thereof reap any fruit or commodity.

Hitherto was there never province, Town, or valiant and virtuous citizen, but
did account their safety, liberty and common quiet to depend upon the moderat
and peaceable government of their mightiest borderers: as also that nothing
went so nere the^, or was of such importance, as their neighbors to establish
their estate in justice, or moderat affection, and in peaceable co^teining the^
selves within their own bounds and limits, as it were within certain strong
bulwarks and barriers. And assuredly as ambition is ever to be feared and
suspected in all manner of persons, so is it most dangerous in those, who being
already of great power and strength, cannot nevertheless bridle their covetous
assections, how large soever the extent of their bounds and limits be: For
since it is impossible that any innouations, or alterations in kingdoms and
common wealths, can hapen without perverting, molesting or general confounding
of al things, it must necessarily follow that not only the bordering provinces,
but also those countries which lie farther off, being tossed and turmoiled with
the waves and billows of such their neighbors ambition, shall finally be
entangled and swallowed up in the gulf of so horrible calamity.

For as the waves of the Ocean Sea, being tossed with some mighty storm and so
swelling out of their banks and ordinary limittes, may at the first with small
labor be restrained through some strong wall speedily erected and by the
diligence of all the neighbors and borderers, each helping other in so great
peril, opposed against the^: but having once pierced and made breach in a bank
or two, and thereby dispearsing themselves and slowing over the whole champion
country without restreint, cannot after ward either by power or policy be
reduced, or stopped from breeding and working inestimable and inevitable
calamity among both men and cattle inhabiting the said Country, but also
oftentimes against whole towns, countries and Kingdoms lying further off: Even
so likewise ambitious Princes endeavoring to enlarge their own bounds and
limits, although with other men's losses, may easily in the beginning of their
enterprises be repressed, and by a common consent and correspondence of their
neighbors, generallye opposinge themselves against their attempts, be so
restreined within their own bounds and limittes, that hardlye they shall put
any to loss or other notable inconvenience: but having once passed their
armies into other men's provinces, and being allured by the sweetness of
taking some strong hold or place of importance, and so conceiving some hope of
further extending the bounds of their empire: and especially knowing their
name to be grown terrible amongst their neighbors, there is then no means,
power, or force how great so ever, either any other let, that can stop the
forcible course of their mad affection and frantic ambition, coveting to
rule and command over others. This matter whosoever among the wisest have
heretofore considered (as all those have done, which thought it necessary to
use discreet moderation in the conduct of their affairs) have ever holden this
for a principle, namely that it is the duty of every good countriman,
especially of Kings, princes and governors, not only diligently and in time
to see that the affairs of their Countries, people and provinces be in good
estate, and quietly and peaceably ordered, but also to prevent such Princes and
neighbors as are provoked by ambition and allured with desire of rule, from
transporting any power, under whatsoever color and pretense, into other men's
dominions, also from all ambitious enlargeing of their own bounds and limits.

Upon this ground did the Romans, seeking even in the beginning to suppress
the power of the Carthagenians and to set Spain free from the Africane
bondage, think it necessary to aid the Mamertynes whom they had besieged.

For this cause when Antiochus the noble, under title of the protectorship of
his nephew, sought to seize upon Egypt, the said Romans commanded him to
desist, and content himself with the possession of his predecessors ancient
dominions: and that generally they never suffered any prince or common wealth
whatsoever to rise into too great power.

Hereupon also the Venetians both now and aforetime obtained the name of
wisdom and singular forecast. For as they were never easily induced to new
wars, so have they alwais nevertheless in such manner tempered their
determinations and counsels, that if any neighbor, either prince or common
wealth, through immoderat desire of government, areared war against his
borderers, their armies were still in readiness as a help and safeguard to the
weaker party, to the end that thus restraining the forces of the Italian
Princes and commonwealths in equal balance, they might keep them from all hope
of subduing them by force of arms, which perpetual resolution of theirs is
among all other excellent matters noted to be the most certain reason,
whereby we see their common wealth not only to have flourished and prospered
above a thousand years, but also in all virtue and wisdom to be grown into
admiration among other nations. This was that Maxim which Laurence de Medicis,
the wisest man in his time in Italy, did so earnestly and with so singular
endeavor all his life time both follow and maintain, unto whom that great
quietness and tranquillity which so long as he lived all Italy did enjoy, was
in the opinion of most hystoriographers attributed: For he so brideled the
affections of the Italian Princes and souerainties, partly by council and
advice, and partly by the power and authority of the Florentine common wealth,
whereof himself was chief governor, that if any, ambitiously passing his
bounds and limits did enterprise ought against his neighbor, he was
immediately reduced into his duty by the mutual power of other Princes and
people united together.

To be brief, there is no wise man but sees, knows, and is fully resolved,
yea, and grievously accuses that people, tearming them traitors to their
Country, who either daunted with fear and cowardlinesse, or provoked with
desire of rest and quietness, either drowned in retchlesnesse, or detained in
civil dissentions, have so suffered their ambitious neighbors empire to
increase, that afterward being unable to bear the brunt or withstand the power
and might thereof, they have been forced with their own eyes to see
themselves suppressed, and their Country reduced into extreme misery and
calamity. Yea, who is there among us, that is not of opinion that the ancient
Gauls might have lived in liberty and bin exe^pt from the Romans bondage, if
by common counsel and consent they had altogether with stood the power of
Julius Caesar? But some standing as idle lookers upon the subuersio^ of their
neighbors, and other with their own weapons increasing the power of the
Romans, things grew in short space to that extremity that the so mighty and
large empire of the Gauls was in the end restrained into a Roman province,
and vtterlyouerwhelmed in most vile bondage.

How have the Italians themseleues sped? If at the beginning they had with a
common power and army suppressed the rising of the Romans, and not suffered the
Antiates, Crustumniens, Centans and Latins each one severally, also soon after
the Volsques, Aeques, Sabins, and then the Samnites, Vmbres, Brutians,
Hetrurians, and other people by little and little one after another to have
stouped under their yoke: had they not first preserved their own liberty, and
then freed al other nations in Europe from that infamous bondage whereunto they
afterward fell? and yet did there not in manner any of them reap any benefit of
al these examples: For notwithstanding they well weyed other men's cases, yet
was there none that could accomodate the fruit of such consideration to him
self or his own time. So that after Italy, immediately Cicil, the^ Africa,
and within a while al Asia, and finally in a manner the universal world being
come under the power of the Romans, felt the burden of their folly. Through the
like giddines and negligence, wherein the hearts of Christian kings and princes
have heretofore been drowned, the Sarasens have found opportunity and means most
villanously to entrap and entangle the chiefest churches of Asia, Africa and
Egypt, under the lamentable yoke and bondage of Mahomet, through the which
they be utterly alienated from the true knoweledge of the Heavenly Doctrine:
whose succession and tyranny, the cruel Empire of the Ottomanns, which took
their beeginning of so conte^ptible an offspring and is now (eue^ with a trice)
enhanced to such might, as it have penetrated not only into the dominions of
Asia and Africa, but also have subverted, ouerthrown and turned topsy turuy
even the inward Provinces of Europe, have seized upon. Yea it is evident to
all men that most Christian kings and nations being either busied in their own
civil wars and domestical dissentions, either daunted with dastardlinesse, or
swelling in ambition, little weening their neighbors losses to be in ought
prejudicial unto their estates, and each one severally supposing himself to
have of his own, power sufficient to turn the storm from him and his dominions,
have given the Turks more leisure and opportunity to execute their cruel
determinations then them selves durst have desired, or so much as once have
hoped for. So that had not the policy power of Germany withstoode their flame,
and thought it expedient, by an Emperial decree, with the conjunction of their
whole forces, coin and public revenues to prevent these proceedinges of the
Ottomanus, long since had the whole Empire of Chirstiandome been subverted and
wholly reduced into ashes: yea the very power and strength of Germany was it
which alone heretofore withstoode the Roman armies: For when all the rest of
Europe together with the inhabitants of Africa and Asia, unto the very
Persians had universally thorough their aforesaid sloth accepted the yoke of
the Roman Empire, the Germans only, assembling their whole forces together,
sundry times conquered and ouerthrewe their whole power, and some times
winning, sometimes loosing did still so supply their armies, that the civil
wars ensuing in the Roman Empire, they with great force and in sundry
places, made diverse and notable roades and invasions into the said Empire, and
finally gathered such courage that they taught those, who before were inured in
conquestes and victories, now not only to receive the yoke of the Germane
Empire, but also did utterly subvert and in manner root them out, which their
so valiant victories and noble valor can not by the posterity be sufficiently
extolled and commended.

Howbeit the more valiant and victorious that our predecessors have been: the
more marvelous, and among al honorable persons lamentable may it be, that thus
degenerating from the ancient valeantise and victorious virtue of our
forefathers, we do peceably behold and quietly suffer the cruel and proud
yoke of the Spanish tyranny (already extended almost over the whole world)
thus leysurely to encroche upon us, to the end for ever to subvert both us and
our posterity together.

I will not by comparisons of nations and Princes one with an other, make any
name more odious then other (for all kind of servitude is heavy and
intolerable, and utterly unworthy any that bears the face of a man) but I
doubt whether the yoke of the Spanish nation, (drawing their petigree from the
Moors and Sarasens, and of late through force and rigor of the inquisition
forced unwillingly to profess Christian Religion) be any whit more tolerable
then the Turkish bondage: Of my self I will affirm nothing, only I refer
the judgment thereof to the inhabitants of Granado, the Indians, Neopolitains
and others: notwithstanding undoubtedly the Roman yoke, although it were
through the greedy coueteousnes of both Emperors and soldiers (who are said
to have destroyed more confederate Cities with their garrisons, then enemies
towns with their armies) intolerable to all men: yet being compared with the
pride, cruelty, and ouetousnes of the Spaniards, may by reason of sundry most
excellent virtues, wherewith it was endewed, be both termed, and accounted in
liew of bondage, liberty, and in stead of a forced obedience, a just and lawful
commandment: but howsoever that case stands all the world does plainly
perceive, that unless in time it be looked unto, and by some general consent
and union of the counsel and force of al other Kings and princes, the Spanish
purposes be prevented and subverted, it will shortly so come to pass that their
strength being grown to perfection thorough the common negligence and want of
consideration in all, those men shall over late begin to resist him, which now
at pleasure and ease beholding the fire consuming the low countries, do not
think that the flame thereof does any whit touch them, either consider that
through their owe sloth and simple forecast, the coals of Spanishe ambition
will in short space so kindle and take hold, that they will reduce both their
own territories, and the dominions of al other states and Princes into ashes.

Neither are they to suppose that this Fire of Spanish ambition is to be
termined with the Provinces of Barbant, Holand, and Zealand, since that already
not only the flakes and sparckles, but also the very fiery flames thereof are
flowen into Italy, France, England, Scotland, and Germany: Yea and have taken
hold of almost all the habitable land. And which is more, even the Spaniards
themselves do not forbear to rereporte that by a certain celestial
constitution, the monarchy of the whole world is due unto them, having as an
earnest penny thereof, through their own power and might, conquered a new world
to our auncesters heretofore unknown, which they have beautified with laws
and customs, polished with manners and discipline, and endued, and instructed
in the Romish Catholic religion: thinking it to be their bounden duty: also
that they ought, having established their Monarchy, to endeavor them selves to
force all other people, and nations unto their Religion and discipline, and
thorough the only terror of their armies, and power of their Empire, to
determine all controversies in all places and causes concerning Christian
religion.

These things do they not only daily in familiar speech give out: but also
in deeds, which are the assured tokens, and in all their actions, counsails
and enterpises, as well past as present, confirm: for their only study, and the
mark whereat they continually leuel, is, how they may, when they have subdued
the low countries, in the midst of the same establish an ordinary resort for
the wars, from whence they may at al times at their pleasure and ease pass
their armies in to England, France, or Germany, and so first with all rigor to
entreat these whom they have found most contrary to their enterprises, and
afterward to prescribe unto all other Christian Kings, Princes, and nations,
whatsoever shall come in their heads, and thus excluding each from al help of
other, and compassing them with their armies, to reduce under their yoke all
those which willingly will not yield unto them al ready and perfect obedience.

This is the mark whereat they always have shot. To this end have al their
counsels, practices and devises tended, as appears in that having with
their armies oppressed Italy, they sense not only extended their power into
Germany under color of restoring religion, but also have endeavored to subdue
the whole estate and monarchy of Christiandome unto their subjection.

And that I may the more plainly open this matter unto you, most mighty
Kings, Princes, and Magistrates. It is expedient orderly to set down a brief
and manifest discourse of all the counsayles, dealinges and practices of the
Spaniards, even from the original of their enterprises unto this time, to the
end their purposes, driftes and devises being detected and laid open to the
whole world, we may in time apply and minister al convenient and meet
medicines to that mischief, which is so known to the whole christian common
wealth. Wherein I will not undoubtedly rehearse any thing, but that which have
been done in the face of the whole world, and as it were, in so public a
theater, that no man can be ignorant thereof, which thing whilst I do
discourse and set before your eyes, I beseech you (noble Princes) vouchsafe to
be attentive, and turning your affections from all opinions preiuditially
conceived, diligently to apply your minds to consider, and understand the
assured and lively truth of the whole affairs.

The Spaniarde therefore, through the valiauncy of King Ferdinando, delivered
out of the bondage of the Moors, and by continual exercise in Wars, grown
so perfect and skillful in arms, that he had conceived a certain opinion of
himself, that he had either surmounted all other nations in warlike knowledge
and fame, or at the least boorded the most excellent, did immediately cast his
view upon Italy, and in his heart devised to attempt to subdue the same to his
obedience, being thereunto especially moved, and allured by reason of the great
plenty, and abundance of all things in the said Country, which they had
found and tried at such time as the Arragons (by nation Spaniards, and then
ruling in Naples) had craved their help against the French armies: they had
before encroched upon the French the I Will of Sicil, being a very commodious
place for passage of their munition, armies, and soldiers, and very
convenient for the provision of whatsoever were requisite and necessary either
to the making of war, or relieuing the wantes of their men.

Giving over therefore the defense of the posterity of Alfonce, who had craved
their help, they entered communication of accord with the French and so agreed
to part between them all that province. But perceiving the French to be slack
in their business and slow in prosecuting this war: taking occasion of some
controversy arising about their bounds, they renewed the wars against them
with all extremity, and yet so, that shortly after, propounding on both sides
certain conditions of peace, the same was through the help of Archduke Philip
the king of Castiles neuew concluded: By which policy, being in very good time
put in use for the staying of the French succor, which being leauied, was
ready to march, it fell out that the remaynder of the French Armies, whom
Gonsalue surprised near the river of Garillan, was quite ouerthrown and as it
were utterly rooted out: So as the French, being by this means clean
expelled out of the Realm of Naples, it was an easy matter for the Spaniardes
there at their pleasure to build Forts and Castles, and the same to fortefie
with strong Garrisons, and so to establish a commodious seat, from whence they
might afterward easily command over the rest of all Italy.

About the same time also the Bishop of Rome, having by his authority made
partition of the Indies between the Porting^les and the Castillians, and by
means thereof, as it had been by some heavenly decree, they had with
unspeakable cruelty ransacked and wasted an incredible extent of Land, and so
subdued to their government all America, together with that great compass of
the west Indies: also that at the same time they had joined to their Dominion
that part of Gaul which is called Belgica, by means of aliance contracted by
the marriage of the said Archduke Philips: thinking them selves furnished with
a sufficient and fit treasure for the conduct of the wars, as well by reason
of the Gold and spice, which yearly they brought very plentifully out of the
Indies, as also through the great profit that daily did arise of the ordinary
nauigations and tranfique of the Flemish Merchants in Spain, (a matter of
great increase unto their revenues and ordinary customs) they cast in their
minds no longer to forbear the invasion and subduing of the rest of Italy:
according to which determination, under pretense to aid the Sforces against
the French, they first entered into Lombardia, a very rich and fruitful
country: There having first expelled the French, and then subdued and
oppressed the Sforces, they strengthened it to their own use with fortresses
and strong Garrisons. They altered also the estate of Florence, Siene, Pise, and
all Thuscane, in giving them such a Duke as they knew to depend of them selves,
and in all things to savor their attempts: and having confirmed the aucthority
of the Doryes in the city of Genes (which being a very commodious Haven, was
at that time molested with civil dissentions) they assured and bound it to
their own devotions.

Finally under the favor of the provinces of the Low Countries, finding
opportunity (after that Charles was by the voice of the electors chosen emperor)
and making way through the said provinces, they did diversely molest the realm
of France: Also under pretense of establishing the popish religion, they gave a
notable gird even into the bowels of Germany, yea and that with so good
success, that having ouercomen, and in battle taken the protestant princes,
they bent their whole minds assuredly to bring the same into subjection and so
to appropriate it to their own inheritance, and to that intent placed their
spanish garrisons in sundry Fortes, even in the center thereof.

Howbeit seeing that the natural moderation and equitye of Charles could not
be alured to satisfy their so ambitious interprises: Also considering that
they were not long able to defend and keep the places where their garrisons
were lodged, as well for that they were to far from Spain, as also because
they were inuyroned with such warlicke people and nations: And with all seeing
them selves by Duke Maurice his armies expelled and so driven out of all high
Germany: besides that, not sinding such success as they hoped for in the wars
which sundry times they had renewed against the French: being wonderfullye
chased and much bewayling the taking of so notable and ritche a pray out of
their hands, they did of necessitye stay the course of their purposes, and so
proceeded no further in the pursuit of their enterprise: Thus refrayned they
them selves until such time as the Emperor, being returned into Spain, the
ambitious, haughty and mere Spanish mind of King Philip, was found meet to
satisfy their desire, and that thereby they took fit occasion to reenter,
although an other way, into that path which before they were forced to forsake:
For they considered that they could not safely at their pleasures conduct any
army into France or Germany: Also that if they brought any, yet should they
want both munition and all other means wherewith to prosecute the wars, even
the first day, unless before they had possession of the Havens of Holland and
Zealand, and withal had established good and sufficient Spanish garrisons,
throughout the Provinces of the low Countries: that they had raised new
tributes and impostes for their pays: To be brief, that they had chosen a
convenient seat from whence they might at ease continue and prosecute the war:
But perceiving that they could not well compass any of all these points so
long as the privileges of the Country (which does exclude all strangers from
the administration of their estate, and admits no other then home born
parsons therein) continued in force: Also that they might not leauy any subsidy
or new tribute: neither put Garrison in any place, without the counsel of the
estates, they concluded among them selves, before they prosecuted the enlarging
of their limits, that necessarily they must restrain and bridle this the over
large liberty of the estates of the Country, and deprive them of their
privileges, freedoms and ancient customs: To be brief, that they must
debar them from all such means, help, and succor, as time out of mind had
stood them in stead, for the maintenance of the dignity and assurance of
those Provinces: to the end that thus wresting and getting into their own
hands the commodity to erect Castles and fortresses at their pleasures, and to
leauy new tributes and taxes as they list: also to chose within these
flourishing provinces such a seat as in their opinions might seem most
commodious for the wars, and so the whole being throghly brought under their
subjection and by spanish legions assured unto the^: they might in time to come
use the same for the assaulting of any who^soeuer they listed. To this end
have they ever since directed their whole studies, counsels and actions,
namely, either by hook or crook to find means to distribute in the provinces
of the low countries a gariso^ of ten thousand soldiers of the old bands: to
the end that ioining thereto the choice of the footmen of A^tors and Hencult,
and strengthening the^ with the ordinary bands, whom the king according to the
manner of the ancient Lords of the said countries, does usually intertain,
having also the friendship or aliance of some Germain prince, even by oath bound
unto them, or if possibly it might be, getting the possession of some
neighbor city of Germany, they may so often as occasion shall serve, reenforce
the said power with a good number of Germayn horsemen, and so upon every
occurrence have a co^pleat armyredy. For this intent was Duke Eric of Brunswik
at the first chosen, whom the king with an annual pentio^ retained: the same
time also took they counsel to take Coulogue and Munster: but as the estats of
the low cou^trys did obstinatly refuse al spanish gariso^s: and therewith in
sta^tly required the reuoking of those out of the country which yet remained of
the french wars, utterly refusing (in case this were not performed) the aid of
money which was required at their hands, it fell out that by reason of the
overthrow taken at Felbes in Africa, wherein the spanish legio^s were almost
quit consumed, the king, who very vnpatie^tly bare this dema^d at the hands of
the states, and was already resolved to punish it as a treazo^, being overcome
with the necessity of his own affairs, seemed to find it somewhat reasonable
and so suffered the reuoking of the said bands out of the countries, to the
end with them to keep and defend the passages of Italy and Spain, together
with his houlds in Africa, against the ordinary incursions of the ^urkes and
Moors: being nevertheless fully resolved (as himself could not but confess,
which also the Spaniaras in their writings have testified) upon the first
commodity to return the said garrisons, who with arms and open force should
blot out the injury supposed to be wrought against the Spanith name, and with
a more stricte bond should bridle and restrain the over great liberty and
authority of al these provinces.

For the compassing thereof, there fell out nothing more fit and apparent then
the Kings constant and perpetual desire, care and zeal, earnestly and
strictly to establish the Romish religion in the low Countries, which caused
him in all his letters written out of Spain, ordinarily to accuse the Duchess
of Parma, and the chief Lords and Magistrates of the country, that they were
not earnest enough in these causes: saying that he well perceived that unless
they used more violent remedies then before time, the Romish religion would
soon be extinguished throughout Flounders, which for his part, he would never
permit, but rather to hazard whatsoever lands and kingdoms he yet possessed:
Wherefore that he willed and ordained that the rigor of the edicts and
placards of religion, should be executed without dissimulation, and that they
should not upon any, whatsoever occasion be moderated, qualified or in any
wise mitigated: but rather that their strictnes should be augmented and
increased: and to that end that they should create new Bishops whom they should
make inquisitours for matters of Faith: that Granuel Archbishop of Mali^es, a
little before become a cardinal, who by reason of his intolerable ambition and
inordinate desire of government, had incurred the malice of al estates, should
be made head and president of that college: that to the end the said bishops
might more diligently attend to the said inquisitio^, some of the spoils of
diverse Abots and other Prelates of the country, whom they accused to be to
negligent in persecuting and punishing of the heretics, should be distributed
among them: and with all that the hearing of all causes, if never so smallye
they pertained to matter of religion, should be reserved to them: whereupon even
at one time, and by one means, al sorts of people of the said cuntries were
grievously offended. The princes and great Lords could not patiently suffer the
administration of the affairs to be taken from them and committed to one
Granuel, a new man and a stranger. The nobility could not like that authority
over their lives and goods should (to the prejudice of their country customs)
be committed to unknown, beggarly and base persons, who coveting their goods
and tresurs, might easily find means to accuse and betraye them. The
magistrates and rulers of cities and towns did murmr that the judgments and
privileges of the cuntry, contrary to the kings oath so sole^nly sworn, should
be taken from them and put into the hands of rascals, and such as besides were
by oath bound to a foreign prince, the pope of Rome, and had already given out
sufficient testimony and proof of their cruelty and covetousness: To be brief,
the whole cominalty generally complained that in stead of sheepheards they were
committed to the custody of ravening wolves continually gaping after their
goods, so that sundry merchants determined to seek new habitations in foreign
countries, which diverse of the^ did indeed: al these things being rehearsed to
the king in sundri suplications, peticions, messages and ambassages (the states
insta^tly requiring that by such innouatio^s, so faithfula people to their
princes might not be forced any whit to deminish their accustomed obedience) so
far was he from giving audience, or harkning to their peticions, that
contrariwise, obstinatly refusing all their demands, he would that eue^ the
decrees of the counsel of Trident (whereby in manner all the laws and customs
of the cuntry were infringed) should be published throughout the said provinces.

And in deed by that means he found the commodity of the time so long looked
for: For in case his precepts took place, the aucthority of the inquisitours
once established, and the laws and customs of the country infringed, it
would be no hard matter to put to death all such as had either aucthority or
countenance among the people, and so also the Spanishe garrisons together with
a new form of regiment might easily be brought in: but contrariwise, if herein
they refused to obey his decrees (as there was no other likelihood,
considering how al sorts of people were by these demaundes oppressed) then
necessarily must ensue both tumultes and disorder, for the pacifiyng whereof,
the Spanish garrizons must needs be returned, and so how so ever the world
went, the obstinate rejecting of the Kings commandment, should (as a matter
of Treason) minister cause sufficient to chastize the people with fire and
swoorde: Neither was he deceived in the event of this counsel.

For some of the chief Nobility having exhibited a certain request into the
Court, wherein was proved that the kings commandment concerning Placards
was not only pernicious to the common wealth, but also dangerous to them
selves, requiring therefore that the publication of the said Placards might
cease, until the king were informed of their dema^ds by such notable persons
as to that end should expressly trauail to his majesty: the people thereby
conceiving hope of greater liberty, took upon them, (and peradventure
somewhat more then was requisite) openly to profess the reformed religion,
which the king and Spaniards did so greatly detest and abhor: This so honest
and aparant occasion ministered unto the king means, first to condemn such of
the nobility of treazon as had exhibited the said request, and so to execute
the ambassadors which by the gouernesse commandment went unto him, and then
under the conduct of the Duke of Alua, to send the old spanish bands into the
low countries, to the end, under pretense of religion, to put to death al such
of the chief lords and nobles of the country, as could not brook their
demeanures: to establishe pains of death against al good men* to entangle the
people with charges, impostes, and grievous bondage: to erect fortress and
castles in their towns and finally to deprive the estates and magistrates of al
aucthority: the nobility of al dignity and preeminence: the people of their
substance and wealth: the towns of their laws, customs, privileges and
freedoms: and finally all the provinces generally of their ancient honor,
dignity and power, and so to open a way to the counsel so long before taken,
for the establishing of the seat of their premeditated wars in the low
countries. Al which things the world knows so well: as also how the Duke of
Alua has endeavored to bring the^ to effect, that I shall not here need to make
any further demo^stratio^ or repeticio^. Undoubtedly any man that would open the
eyes of his understanding and narrowly consider of these counsels and
demenures, might plainly perceive that al these drifts tended not to the
subduing of the low countries, who refused no kind of obedience, but rather to
the laying of a firm foundation of the spanish monarchy that they leuel at.
And indeed the Duke of Alua immediately upon his ariual in the low cuntries,
determined to set upon the City of Coulogne, under pretense that she had
admitted into the number of Burgeses the king of Spayns pretended rebels, and
at the same time sought also to bring into his subjection the city of Mu^ster
in Westphaly: both which interprises had at one time taken place had not the
prince of Orange, who the^ had levied a strong power in Germany interrupted his
whole devises and utterly subverted the course of his counsel and practices:
which notwithstanding, he did not nevertheless forbear to prescribe and command
laws to the inhabittants of Coulogne, or with great threts to move the
magistrates to his obedience: At the same time also he first dealt with the
bishop of Treuers, (who promised al help and favor in the advancement of the
Kings affairs) to the great prejudice of the Palatin elector of hapy memory,
and after grew to debate with him for the chief town of his country, which he
affirmed to be under the King his masters protection. He also limited to the
Duke of Cleue, such counsailours as should no otherwise govern his Country
then as if it had wholly ben under the absolute command of the king of Spain:
he sought to bind the Earl of Embden unto him as his vassal under color of
protection and safgard: He commanded the inhabitants of Liege, to furnish him
of weapons, furniture and victuals. To be brief, he exccuted upon al borderers
all absolute authority, commandment and power. And as for the princes that
were farther off: first he quarrelled with the most high and noble Queen of
England, under color and pretense of intercourse, and emprisoned such English
merchants, as usually trafiqued in the said provinces: he commanded her to
banish who^ he lift, whiles himself not only harbored and friendly entreated
in the low countries sundry lewd persons, which had been attainted of treason
against their sovereign, but also enriched them with gifts and yearly
pentions. By sundry devises and driftes did they solicit the Queen of Scots
(being then prisoner) to work some new treacherous devise: they loded with
honor and rewards the murderers of the regent of Scotland, using both the^,
their counsels and endeavors in sundry their affairs. And what not? they
found means by the Popes bull to pronounce the Queen of England an heretic
and unlawful inheritour: They raised troubles against her in the heart of her
Realm: They put her in danger of her life: They did by publication habandon
her Realm to the first that would or could surprise or seize upon it, and
expressly charged Don John of Auctrich perticularly, immediately upon the
quieting of the low countries to leauy mortal war against her, to marrye
the Queen of Scotts, and with her to appropriate to him self the Realms of
England, Scotland, and Irelande: These things when they could not compass
to their minds, by reason of the wars revived among the Estates of the low
Countries, they sought to bring to pass thorough Irelande, whether they
transported, in outward show, in the Popes name, but in truth by the
commandment, motion and will of the King of Spain, a number of Italians and
Spaniardes, that they passing through that i will, (which they hoped to find
wholly at their devotion) into the realm of England, might the more
commodiously subdue and bring it under their power and authority. And had not
the King, at the Duke of Aluaes persuasion (who wondered at the difficulties and
lettes that happened in this enterprise,) thought it best to refer this
matter to a more convenient time, the weight of all this war had long since
been transported into England in hope that that being first gotten, the
Spaniard thereby being at quiet on that side of the Sea, might have a more
ready way to subdue all the whole low countries.

And as for France, which by reason of the Kings noneage was troubled with
domestical dissension, they omitted no manner of inventions, or policies, but
employed their whole industry, care and study to wrappe and entangle it more
and more in civil wars, to the end, that when the same so flourishing, and
mighty a Realm were with her own weapons almost subverted and destroyed, they
might as their leisure, with more opportunitye, and as convenient time served,
with the less a do subdue it: neither need I here much to stand upon those
means which they have used to heap more coals upon these civil flames: what
helps they have ministered to the nourishing of these discordes, with what
affection they have travailed in it, what actions among parties, clokinges,
leagues and conspiracies they have invented wherewith to maintein and uphold
this miserable kindling: For the most Christian king does evidently and well
know that diverse times they have procured his subjects to rebel, and sought
means again to bring them to take arms: yea and least any man should think
they did it for zeal to their Catholic religion, they have with promises of
great sums of ready money sought to seduce the hearts of the Princes,
defenders of the reformed religion: neither is he ignorant how often he has been informed that sundry times they have endeavored to corrupt, seduce, and
win from their sworn allegiaunce the particular governors of towns,
fortresses, and havens on the sea costs: how they have with great diligence
labored even the King of Nauai, promising him great sums of money in case he
would break the peace last concluded: yea how they have proceeded even to his
highness, persuading him to take arms, to the subversion of the King his
brother, and the desolation of his whole kingdom: whom when they perceived
nothing prone to serve their mischievous tournes, they have sought to make away
with poison and sword, having to that end, hired express murderers, who
since have by law ben executed. I will not here speak what number of pentioners
the King of Spain has bound to his devotion, not only in the privy council
of the King of France, but also of all other Christian Kings, Princes and
potentates, through whom he does at his pleasure trouble the estates of some,
procure the rising of others subjects, overthrow and supplant whatsoever
counsails are holden against him, and to be brief, make them determine and
like of all that he thinks commodious to himself: This is manifestly and well
known to all Kings and Princes, to whose detriment these things are put in
practice: none dare the while speak any word of al these matters or once open
his lips against them: so greatly are all men's minds overtaken with fear and
astonished at the only name of the Spanish nation.

What shall I say of our Germany? which being in greater danger then any other
Province, yea almost already swallowed up in this monsterous gulf of Spanish
ambition, does (as in outward show it were sufficiently warranted) make no
account of her own danger, weening that the fire which has consumed her
neighbors houses, and is entered even into her own bowels does no whit touch her
at all: so that this Empire, which aforetime was wo^t so valiantly to defend,
both her own liberty and the liberty of al christiandome, does now seem to be
more cowardly and rechlesse in preventing the establishing of that yoke that
threatens the whole world, then any other nation. It is evident that the King
of Spain has in Germany not only his pe^sioners and privy whisprers which
reveal to him al their Princes councils, and enterprises, but also a public
cousailour in the chamber of the empire, by who^ he understands the whole
affairs of all the country, and determines al matters as if he were a prince of
the Empire in the degree of the rest. He has also his place by his Ambassadors
in all the assemblies of the Empire: he carefully co^sidereth of all that is done
in all their diets, he endeavors to learn all their secrets, and has no
less intelligence and notice, the seven electors themselves: and what may be
more unworthy, or more contumelious to the Germain nation, either more
dangerous and fit for the surprising of their liberty, then not to call any
Imperial diet: any convocation in the Empire: any counsel: any assembly of
estates: yea almost execute any administration of private justice: without the
presence, counsel, and (as I may almost say) without the will and
commaundenent of the King of Spain? But under what pretense? forsooth by
reason of the precinct of Burgundy, which being numbered among the Imperial
precinctes, the king of Spain must be accounted among the Princes of the
Empire. And what is this, most Noble Princes, other then a manifest mockery and
contempt of you, your aucthority, and ancient glory? Yea and wittingly, before
your faces, and with your own consent, a snarling of you in the haulter of
Spanishe bondage? The emperor Charles having by force oppressed Germany, and
being inuyroned with his spanish and Italian legions, called an Imperial diet
at Ausburge, as I ween in the year 1548: Wherein he declared that in diverse
parts of the low countries there were sundry Towns and provinces which in old
time were wont to take their laws and be subject to the Emperial chamber,
whereunto they did ordinarilye appeal: To be brief, that they had always
been holden and reputed among the precincts of Germany, whereupon sundry and
many questions and controversies did oftentimes arise, he would therefore,
said he, at once both end their quarrels, and do a great pleasure to all
Germany: and therefore purposed to decree, that as well those Provinces which
he had in the nether Germany, as also the rest that lay in the Belgique Gaul,
being reduced into an Imperial precinct, should from thenceforth be reputed,
holden, and termed, The precinct of Burgundy: and that in respect thereof, he
and his successors should disburse toward the charges of the Empire, twice so
much as every two Electours were to contribute to the wars against the Turk:
and so they should hereafter remain exempt and free, not only from all kinds
of contributions and collections of money, but also from al jurisdiction of the
chamber, and the laws and decrees of the Empire. Here may we behold the price
of the spoils of our jurisdiction, aucthority and power, also the reward of
our bondage: This is that small sum of money wherewith the most sacred
dignity and freedom of our Empire is supplanted, and authority given to
aforeine prince, (with whom we have no bond of affinity, correspondence of
language, neighborhod, or agreement of laws and customs) to enter into our
diets: to have a place in our assemblies: to give his voice in our Emperial
chamber: to be brief, to peruse and consider of al our counsels, and
actions, either public or private.

If to serve a master, notwithstanding he be neither rigorous he hauty, be of
it self a misery, who sees not our Germany in most miserable estate, where
the King of Spain may, if he will, command at pleasure? But what need I say,
he might if he would, since all the world does plainly see that in effect he does
command both far and near? For what is it that the Spaniard has not gained by
the erectio^ of this precinct of Burgundy? except that he does not only rule
there at his pleasure, but also uses al absolute authority over the precinct
of Westphaly, which time out of mind was accounted one of the chiefest, and
mightiest in all Germany: yea he so commands there, that there is none which
dare in any wise control or gainsay him. As for example. Have not the inhabit
antes of Liege hitherto obeyed his Empire: either the Duchyes of Cleue and
Iuliers: and finally the whole territories of Coulogne, and Westphaly, been at
his devotion? And yet not content with this kind of commandment, he seeks
after a new sort of obligation to subdue and conquer them, and so to extend
his Empire generally over all Germany: Therefore to say nothing of those men,
who being in possession almost of all the straightes of Germany, even from
the foot of the Alps to the Ocean Sea, are most ready to obey his
commandments, and dare not refuse any of his requests: neither to speak of
those who being by blood, alliance, league, and near affinity united and knit
unto him, do command over Istria, Carinthia, Croatia, and the most part of
Pannonia, yea and bear sovereign authority even in Bauaria, possessing all
the heads and springs of the Rivers of Licus, Aenus, and Danow, and are
pearched over the heads of Augusta, Ratispone, and other mighty Emperial
cities: to hold my peace, also of those, who holding as it were the rudder of
the Empire, (in hope hereafter to attain to the succession of the kingdom of
Spain) will not once oppose them selves against his rising and might: who
seeeth not whereunto this unquenchable thirst and ambition of the young Duke of
Banaria, Bishop of Frifinguen does tend? who being egged on by the King of
Spaines industry, armed with his authority, and kindeled with his
commandments, is so inflamed and burns in so wonderful ambition, that he
can not be satisfied with any Bishoplike dignities or princely authorities
whatsouer? he has almost in a moment atteined unto so great and mighty
power, that in strength he may compare with sundry Kings of Europe, and is
justly to be doubted of, and feared among all the Princes of Germany: And in
truth there be sundry noble Realms in Europe, which neither in greatenesse and
extent: in multitude of people: in strength of soldiers: or in abundance of
all things necessary, are to be compared with the principalities that pertain
to his jurisdiction and are under his obedience: all which notwithstanding, he
can not yet be quiet, but frying and flaming in the ambitious fury of the
Spanish nation, he coueteth and aspireth daily to greater matters: For he has
already by the King of Spains help and suite obtained, besides the
Bishoppricks of Frisinguen, and Hildesheim, the principaltye over the country
of Liege, which in situation, extent and power of people is nothing inferior
to any other Province: hereunto endeuoreth he also to join the Electorship of
Coulogne: for notwithstanding hitherto the Country of Liege has openly
enough, and unfeignedly aided and succored the Spaniards with armor,
artillery, victuals, and al other necessary provision for the wars, yet so
long as the Bishop was any whit restrained in the awe of the Bishop of
Coulogne, he thought it not good plainly to show his mind, but although in
effect he had submitted his whole estate to the Spanish obedience, yet did he
still in words bear himself a newter: howbe it now to the end the Spaniard
might without controlement command at pleasure he seeks partly by force,
partly by threatninges, and partly by the Popes authority to inuest him (or
rather in his name and person him self) with the electorall dignity, and
Archebishoppricke of Coulogne, by whose means he may not only prosecute his
wars in the low countries, and nether Germany, even with the weapons and power
of Germany it self: but also prepare the way to subdue to his dominions all
the upper Germany also, and take into his hands the disposition of the toules
and tributes due to the Electors, and other Princes, which have always (most
noble Princes) been accounted, and that justly, the sinews and preservation
of the dignity and aucthority of your Empire: but being once lost, and
through this new election of the Archbishop of Coulogne, reduced into the
power of a foreign Prince will be unto you in stead of fetters and stocks,
to keep you from leauying war in your necessities, and to force you to bow
down your necks to the Spanish yoke, so often or whenever he shall think
good.

For hereafter shall not King Philipp need to trouble him self with making a
bridge over the Rhyne as did Julius Caesar, since the chief city of the Empire,
the Electoral sea of Coulogne, and the Archbishops whole diocese shall with the
twinkling of his eye be as ready to obey him as there Prince, and so stand him in
stead of a bridge, gate, and passage: what else shall the Spaniarde need
whereby absolutely to command over all Germany? to prescribe laws, and
ordinances at his pleasure? and to leauy wars against whom so ever he shall
think good? unless peradventure he wants yet some haven in the mouth of the
German sea whereby he may upon every, necessity transporte his soldiers out
of Spain: But for that he has provided, yea so well that he can not stand in
need of any more: for under color of raising war in Friesland, and
transporting victuals into the low Countries, he earnestly craves possession
of the river of Ems: for the atteining whereof, he has given commission to
Billy the Portingale so to deal with Ertsart Earl of East Friseland his
vassal, that he would as it were in loan and for a time grant him the use of
the Town of Embden: Offering in recompense and reward for so great a
benefit, the propriety of the Town of Groening, (which being enuyroned with
the spanish forces, and secluded from all commodity of victuals, he may recover
when he list) also the government of Burgundy with the revenues, demaynes, and
other the commodities thereunto belonging, retayning nevertheless his ordinary
garrisons in the same. If he may obtayn this, then shall he get into his power
all the principal rivers of Germany, namely Danowe, Rhine, Like, Aene, Meuse,
Moselle, and Ems: And as by his kindered, alyes and vassals he has all the
land passages open unto him, so now shall there be no thing by sea able either
to break his power, or slack the course of his enterprises. Finally also
calling to mind the difficulties and lets which the invincible force of neither
Saxony ministered in the affairs of the Emperor Charlemaine: Also remembering
how the one only town of Maydenburge being abandoned of all her neighbors
and alyes, did neuerthe^esse keep footing against the victorious army of the
invincible Emperor Charles the fifth his father: stopped the course of his
victories, yea and wholly brake his power, he has found means to minister a
medicine and provide a salve for this soar, to the end there might be no stop
to let the advancement of his Empire in Germany. For he has by his endeavors
so dealt with the Pope and the Emperor, that besides all the prefermentes
before mentioned, they have by faithful promise bound them selves to confer
to the Bauarian, the Byshoprick of Maidenborow, that is to say, the whole power
of Saxony.

And for his part, he accompteth it no difference, whether by him self, or by
his deputy, vassal, kinsman or confederate wholly affected to the furtherance
of his enterprises, he get the possession of any thing: Besides that he is
particulerly and assuredly persuaded, that by this bishop he may have
authority to command what he please: All which notwithstanding, he is not
yet content, but to remove all manner of stumbling blocks out of his way he
endeuoreth by all diligent means and practizes to create him Primate of all
Germany, and so to deal, that by his will and only authority all
ecclesiastical Prebends and promotions through out Germany may be conferred and
given to whom he list.

And do you not yet feel (most noble German princes) that the king of Spain
(I will not say only soliciteth earnestly) but already possesses and keeps
in his hands the state of the whole Empire? That it is he who having forcibly
supplanted the low countries, shall be Lord of all the ports and havens of the
Occean sea, and the mouths of all rivers in Germany? That it is he that at his
pleasure shall exclude you from all benefit and use of trafique: That seeks
the dominion over the river Ems? That seazeth upon and disposes all your
tributes, toules and revenues? That prescribes Laws and ordinances to the
inhabitauntes of Cleeue land, Iuliers, Liege, and Westphalye? that would
bring the state of Coulogne to his obedience? that it is he whose Kinsmen
confederates and reteyners do command over great nations and large provinces
in Germany? that it is he who personally being in Spain, has nevertheless his
seat and voice in all your assemblyes and imperial dyets? that it is he that
spieth, considers of and notes all your counsails, actions and most secret
affairs? that it is he that does not only command, forbid, establish, and
confirm what so ever he lists, but also gives and appoints unto you the
bishops of Trisinghem Heldesheim and that establishes princes and electours of
the Empire at Coulogne, Liege, and Maydenburg? and to be brief, that it is he
who seeking dominion over the mighty ecclesiastical state of our nation,
nominateth a Primate in Germany at his devotion? and to supply all these
rooms, presents unto you one only person, one only man, and him such a one
as is very near unto him in blood, affinity and confederacy, and bound unto
him by the law of protection: also for a number of benefits received at his
hand, wholly subject to his ordinances: Yea such a one as he is assured, will
not speak, do, or attempt any thing without his will and commandment. And
finally that man who he knows will through infinite controversies that he
has with many of the Germain princes, kindle such a fire of division and
discord throughout the whole Empire as can never be quenched, but by the utter
subversion of all Germany. For who knows not that great and old quarrel that
is between him and the noble Dukes of the house of Brunswik for the title of a
thousand and one villages that he requires of them, Which undoubtedly he will
not forget, ne suffer so to sleep: Or who is ignorant of the envious emulation
that is between this family of Bauier and the County Palatins for the
preeminence of the electorate of the Empire? Or how they do complain that it
was taken from their name, stock and family? Which quarrel if this bishop
(when he is through your silence and at the king of Spaines pursuit grown to
such aucthority) does renew, as undoubtedly he will: how many woeful tragedies
will it breed in Germany? what a gap will it open to the spanish tyranny and our
bondage? and finally what overthrow, sorrows and desolation will it bring upon
our miserable, folish and unadvised country? and yet most (noble princes and
excellent estates of the empire) you do not only bear with these things and
say nothing, but also taking your sound rest, and careless of all, you are
become idle gazers (as it were for pleasure, upon the overthrow and calamities
of your next neigbours) yea, notwithstanding this so dangerous a fire has
burned their houses almost to the ground, and be kindled at your gats, and is
even come so near, as to scortch your very beds, yet do you not think the
matter to touch your selves either that it is time for you to withstand the
practices of so ambitious and haughty a Prince.

And what is to be said to all other kings, princes, and estates of
Christendom? Even that the like sloth and slugishnes detaineth them every one:
For while the only low countries do oppose them selves against the king of
Spaines tyranny, and do give al other kings, princes and christian common
wealths time, leisure, and opportunity to turn away this bondage, and by their
example do show how easy a matter it is not only to shake, but also even
utterly to undermine and subvert these foundations of tyranny, there is none of
the^ all that will once seem to mislike of a matter of so great importance? But
as if purposedly each one endeavored to augment and increase the spanierds power
to their own destruction, sitting with their arms a cross or leaning on their
elbowes they do permit and suffer the low countries (already wasted and
consumed with the force and long continuance of this war) in such wise to
quail and deminish, that being at their wits end, they know not what
counsel to take, either what other course they may best follow.

The King of France being daunted with his brother the Duke of Anieowes rash
and unadvised attemptes, gazeth upon the fire which kindles far and near
among his neighbors: thinking him self peradventure of force sufficient to
keep and defend both him and his estate. The Duke of Anieow not knowing what to
do, can neither determine nor perceive what is good for him self. Others
likewise, wondering at the Realm of Portingale which the the Spaniard has
newly conquered, do sit still, as not resolved what counsel to take. The
Spaniard in the mean time, over aweth all the low country with his whole
power, and finding none to withstand him, lays firm and assured foundations
of his so long coueted Monarchy: So that through the only terror of his name,
strength and power, his fame is blown al over, even into the uttermost parts
of the East and West, and so in effect he apporpriateth to himself only, the
name of Universal, which aforetime the Byshopps of Rome have entitled him
withal. Which prediction does in truth (most noble Kings, princes and
Christian Magistrates) threaten unto you a miserable bondage, and through your
negligence promises unto him a Catholic power, that is to say, an universal
dominion and tyranny over all nations and provinces, unless in time your
selves do seek some remedy.

King Phillip of Macedon, was justly suspected of the Grecia^s, because that
subduing certain people of Thracia, their neighbors, they feared that he
pryed into the liberties of the rest of all their countries: and therefore the
Athenians doubting lest the fire of ambition that consumed his bowels would
brast out, and not only kindle in Grecia, but even consume all Asia, thought
it requisite with the common power and strength of Greece to suppress and
break his might: neither was their suspicion in vain as the event showed: for
notwithstanding king Philip being prevented by death could not compass and
bring to effect the imaginations of his mind, yet did he leave to his son
Alexander such a choice number of soldiers and warriers, that the young man
being ambitious, did through their force and valiancy subdue not only all
Greece, but also Asia, Siria, Babylon, Persia and Egypt: and having scoured
all over even to the ends of India, and Scithia, did in a small time erect and
establish the third and chief monarchy of the world after the Persians. All
which notwithstanding, we do not yet fear the ambitious power of the King of
Spain, neither think it necessary to suppres his unreasonable forces, who not
in one place only, but in many and diverse, has his whole armies of old
bands, and practiced soldiers, whom he still does maintain in ordinary
garrisons: and has ready at all assaies above 30000. men of war: who has
exte^ded the limits of his Empire into Africa, Asia, Europe, and America, even
to the East, and West Indies: who by Sea has ouerthrown the poer of the
Ottomans: who has joined to his kingdom al Portingale with innumerable other
Islands, and most flourishing kingdoms: who rules Italy, which was wont to
command over all the world, as it please him: who is Lord of sundry ports and
havens in Africa: who every where possesses the Ocean Sea: who has in his
power the chiefest Islands and havens of the mediterranean sea: and to be
brief who through the only terror of his name, decrees, commands and
effectually fulfilleth what he list among all Princes and Christian nations.

Howbeit if any man ween that co^. tenting him self with so large an Empire,
he will not hereafter attempt any thing but what equity and law shall permit:
undoubtedly the same is willingly deceived, and flattring himself, has no care
of his own honor, liberty, or life. For first the desire of government is un
satiable, and like to a flaming fire, which the more stuf and matter that it
finds, the further it does stretch and extend it self, wasting all as it
goes. Again who sees not that by this manifest usurping of Portingale, eue^
in the face of the whole world, the king of Spain means not to submit
himself to any laws, rytes, or capitulations whatsoever. For if he had
thought himself to have had any right in the said succession, why did he by
force prevent the laws? or by fire and sword the holy decree of the ludges?
wherefore has he abused King Antony, the Queen, mother to the most christian
King, the Duke of Bragrance, and even the Prince of Parmats son: and to be
brief, all those that pretended any title to the said kingdom?

Shall we then yet think that either conscience, justice, or equity can take
place in him, who so evidently has declared that in matter of government he
will not take or measure his right, other then with the power and force of his
armies? that he, who with his money has armed the Turk against the
Venetians, and so turned that storm from himself unto his confederates in
Ciprus, can think himself bound unto any covenants, treaties, or agreements
whatsoever? That that man's fiery ambition, who has not kept any covenants
with the inhabitaunts of Grenado, the Indians, or Flemings any longer then he
found them profitable to himself, ca^ be stayed by any bond of league or
confederacy of aliance? Either what conscience, right or law can bind him,
who by the principles or precepts of his religion, together with the Bishop of
Romes authority, thinks himself released from all bonds of faith or
promise? shall we hope that he, who could not by any bonds of marriage be
restrained from Incest: for any love or duty of matrimony abstain from
adultery: for any natural love forbear parricide: or for any sworn faith
refrain from perjury: being besides so ambitious as all men know: so desirous
to enlarge the bounds of his Empire, and so far transported with pursuit of
revenge, may by any proposition of equity, right, law, or Justice be cooled
and brought to reasonable order in whatsoever matter? As if it were not as
lawful for the Bis. of Rome to dispe^se, by his Bull, as well with the laws,
bounds and limits of kingdoms and Provinces, as with the bands of matrimony,
and faith so solemnly sworn. But to what purpose is it for us to think under
pretense of law and justice to moderate that man's ambition, who has been long
resolved, that he has lawful and just title, to invade other men's kingdoms,
and if he may to bring the same into his subjection?

For among all princes, potentates, and Christian common wealths, who is there
against who^ he thinks not him self long since to have had sufficient and
just cause to move wars? He will accuse the King of France, that he did not
only not hinder his brothers attempts in Flanders, but also aided him with
men, money, and Weapons, and so began the wars: That in the behoof of the
Queen his mother, he has in warlike manner assaulted the Islands apperteining
to his obedience, fought with his navy: and not only received and harbored
Don Anthony his enemy and supposed rebel in his kingdom, but also aided and
assisted him both with men and money: also that he succored the low countries
as much as possibly he could.

To the Queen of England he will allege, that first by the Popes Bulls she
is denounced an heretic, and thereupon excommunicated: then, that in diverse
dealinges both by Sea and by land she has showed herself to be his enemy:
that in her dominions she has harbored and aided his enemies, with men,
munition, money and ships: that she has favored Don Anthony in all his
enterprises: and that upon every opportunity she has intercepted his navy
and treasure coming from the Indyes.

Amongst the German Princes, some he will accuse for succouring the Prince of
Orange, and others for their parsonal presence in the Flemish wars Against some
he will raise controversies in respect of their territories by means of the
Bishop of Frisenguen, and against others for the preeminence of the electorate:
and generally he will accuse al to be either heretics, or to be confederate
with those that have shaken of the Bishop of Romes obedience whom altogether
the Pope will (as heretofore he has done) command to be by force reduced to
their duties. And I pray you, is not all this sufficient to serve for a very
good color to make him, who accounts of all the Popes precepts, as of
heavenly revelations: And of his excommunications, as of celestial
thunderboltes, to assail them? Who of him self is a sworn enemy to religion,
abhorring it as the plague of the world: who in all his counsels, purposes,
practices, and leagues that ever he made, has no other meaning but to root it
out and quight to suppress it? and who being the most ambitious prince alive
does yet protest that he had rather lose all his dominions and dignities, then
leave any spark of this religion vnque^ched? And to be brief, who makes no
more accounte of the Germans, then if they were Turks, Sarazens or Moors.
Yea, will not the Pone think himself to have as full power after his
thunderbolts of excommunication, to exhibit Germany as a pray to king Philip,
as had his predecessors to give it to his Father the Emperor Charles? Pope
Paul the third and his predecessor Clement the feuenth did threaten Charles
the fifth with excommunications, because he thought it requisite to pacify
the trouble (arising in Germany for matter of religion) rather by the
authority of a general council, then by proceedinge by force of arms: yea
in the end with their thonderboltes of excommunication they drove that good
prince (for still he relented to them) to such an exigent, that as an extreme
remedy, he was forced to make wars with all extremity. And shall we now think
that the Pope do want means to persuade the king of Spain (who of himself is
sufficiently inclyned that way) that he has just cause by mere strength to
reduce them to the faith of the Romish Church? If any man think that the
fear hereof touches no more but the protestant princes, also that they which
still have perseuered in Popery need not doubt or mistrust any thing: Let him
call to mind that the Henry's, Ottoes, Frederickes and other most mighty, and
in all commendable virtues, most excellent Emperors your predecessors (most
noble princes) did in their days profess the same faith and religion with the
popes, and yet could not escape their thonderbolts and most wrongful
excommunications: But that some of them see their Empyres translated and given
to foreign princes: Others came bare footed and bare headed to ask them
forgyuenesse, and submitting them selves to be trodden under the Popes feet
could not nevertheless mollify their minds without suffering great injuries
and tollerating notable abuses: Let him suppose that the Pope wants no
occasions to arm the Spaniard to the destruction of the Germans, seeing that
they which be of his own religion, do not only not oppose them selves against
the protestants, but also daily enter a legue, amity, and firm alyaunce with
them: Let him conjecture that the spanierds not being able to subdue Germany
to their own dominion, neither to reduce it to the Popes obedience, unless to
that end, they contract amity with the rest, either in respect of ancient
allance, or by right of protection, or for fear of their armies: it is
necessary for the Germains to stand to one of these conditions, namely, either
to ioyn with the spaniardes in the conquest of their fellow cuntry me, or else
uniting their whole forces together, to take arms against the^ for the
delivery of an Germany out of their bondage: This unless they do spedely take
in hand, and so using the occasion of the affairs of the low countries do
cut off the increase of the Spanish power, they shall hereafter in vain each
after other, endeavor to turn away the force of their tyranny.

Certainly most noble princes, the King of Spains power is great: and yet is it
such, that as by your sufferance, (I had almost said sloth) the foundations
thereof have sprung and grown forward, so may it again by your union as easily
be shaken, and finally with small labor by your power and concord be brought
to utter subversion. For all the Provinces of his obedience do lie separate a
great way each from other, whereby their victuals may easily be cut off, their
forces debarred, and their strength utterly overthrown, in case you will but
of your selves help your selves, and not suffer Italy: by a list running
thorough the midst of Germany to be joined with Flaunders. A matter so much
the easier for you to compass, for that you see evidently how al nations do
abhor their great tyranny, and attend no other but opportunity to free
themselves out of their bondage. Neithe are you ignorant with how weak a
power, and with what a handful of men, or small beginnings, the Prince of
Orange has wasted and brought to naught their great enterprises, and consumed
their mighty armies: what a while the low countries (destitute of al aid and
bereaved of succor) have borne the brunt of so mighty a Prince: also in what
danger within these few years Don John of Austrich, and of late days the
Prince of Parma were of being driven out of all the said low countries with
their whole power: yea and that at that time, had not sundry provinces by
reason of civil dissension departed from the general union: and the Duke of
Aniow through perverse counsel let slip his good fortune which he possessed,
they had not only aba^doned Flanders, but also peradventure limited their
dominions with the Pirinean mountains. So that as you are not to co^te^ne
their might and suffer it thus to grow on, so have you no cause most noble
Princes to fear the greatness thereof, or to dant you from valiant defense of
your selves or revenge of the common liberty.

The king of Spains power can not greatly hurt you, if in time you see to your
business: If you neglect not the wars of the low countries: if through your
authority you undermine al Billies purposes concerning the river of Ems: if you
repress the fiery ambition of the Duke of Bauier together with his exceeding
affection to the king of Spain: if with the most christian king, if with the
right excellent Queen of England, and al other christian princes and potentats
you do earnestly consider of some necessary means to suppress this their over
great power and authority. But if contrariwise you suffer the inhabitauntes of
the low cuntries, your next neighbors (through the spanish power almost
wasted) yet to be consumed with the stre^gh of Germany: if you hold your
peaces when you see the inhabitants of Cleueland, Iuliers, and Coulogn eue^
quake for fear at the precepts of the king of Spain: if you force not the
inahbitants of liege to aid the common enemy with money, munition and wepons,
as hitherto they have openly don: If you bridle not the vile ambition of the
Duke of Bauier, but suffer him to join the Archbishopric of Coulogn and
electorial dignity to his authority: If you restrain him not from joining his
forces with the spanish to the destruction of Flanders, and exclude not the
spaniard from all the havens of the Ocean sea: doubt not but Fla^ders being
brought under the yoke. Germany divided into factions: France consumed in civil
wars, or with drawn into sundry opinions and diverse affections: the terror of
the spanish name, and weight of his empire will become a mighty tempest and
inevitable inundation, which having piersed the causies, ditches and ba^ks, will
shortly be sufficient through the fury of his ambition to incroch al
christe^do^ together. Against which procedings if any man will the^ oppose
himself, either by force or otherwise, he shall (though to late) find that
which in the beginning of our discourse we have set down, namely, that fit
opportunity to do well being once escaped us (which will never be recovered
either by entreaty or compulsion) will cry vengeance against us, and bring
upon us that plague which our rechlesnes and negligence does deserve.

This prognostication I beseech God to turn from all Christendom, especially
from Germany, my sweet country: most earnestly desiring him in the name of
our Savior JESUS CHRIST, that he will vouchsafe in his holy spirit to assist
all your counsails (most noble princes of thempire, and you al other christian
Kings, Princes and magistrates) and therewith so govern, conduct and frame all
your enterprises and determinations, that you may conclude upon, and put in
execution whatsoever shall seem most just, profitable, requisite, and necessary
for the benefit of all Christendom, the glory of his holy name, and the
wealth and salvation of his people.

FINIS.
