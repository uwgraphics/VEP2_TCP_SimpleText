A RELATION OF THE PASSAGES OF OUR ENGLISH COMPANIES FROM time to time since
their departure from England, to the parts of Germany, and the united
Provinces.
MY love and duty (Right Worshipful) urging me oftentimes (since my departure
from England) to make an explanation of the same to your self, with the rest
of my good friends, and now coming to a fullness of affection, I am here to
give you a certification, of all the occurrances and passages in service from
those troublesome parts of Germany, where I am now resident: and although I am
a little prevented, in laying open the full discourse of our Iournalls or
Martch, by the departure of many of our Regiment that are returned back to
England, who has reported more then I am able to write, yet nevertheless,
will I give you a touch of our travail and martch, as my remembrance will give
me leave.

First, we had a quick passage to Roterdam, from thence to Delfe, where we
were mustered for the King of Bohemia, and was billited there for three weeks,
where we had our Apparel, our Hats, and Colors, with our Arms given to us:
from thence we Marched up the River of Rhine to Raise, where we stayed until we
heard from his Excellence; from thence we Marched up the Rhine, until we came
right against Wesell, where his Excellence lay with twenty thousand Horse and
Foot, and mounted his Ordinance against Wesell, where we lay in leaguer the
most part of July, until the Bridge was made over the Rhine: and the first of
August we Marched over the Rhine; his Excellencies Musketieres gave us three
volleyes of shot at our departing: from thence we Marched accompanied with Grave
Henrick, and his troops of Horse, and when we came to our lodging, we were
entertained by the Boores of the Country, with fresh Straw, Bread, and Beer,
and what else we could get, and so Marched forwards, sometimes twenty miles a
day, sometimes more, and sometimes less: but Spindola made account to cut us
off every man of us; and because we Marched extraordinary, he reported the
Devil did lead us; but I am sure that God was our guide and defender, and so
we Marched until we came to a Town called Bensum, where we were billited
three days, where we had good Wine in abundance, and good cheer with it. The
Wine was commonly set on the Table in a Paile or some such like vessel,
wherein we filled our glass, and drank every man his belly full. From this
Town we Marched toward Anne, where dwells Grave Henrickes sister, who is
Princess of that place, and she Royally came to us in the Field, with other
Gallants in their Caroches, guarded with Horse and Foot, whom courteously
greeted our Lords and Captains, we standing in Battalia manner, which when she
returned, we Marched to a little Dorpe near adjoining, where we had two
Alarums that night, which caused most of us to leave our victuals behind us:
some their meat a boiling, and some rosting, which was a great grief unto us
being hungry the next day. Also it was the first time that we had any Alarm,
and so we Marched from that Dorpe toward Worms, where we Marched over the
River, and so thorough Worms to a Dorpe six miles distant from that place,
and so we Marched up and down until we did meet with the Princes of the
Union, who joined with our forces to meet Spindola, who lay then in a Town
called Vpnam, which was yielded to him, and there he Entrencht his Forces, that
by no means possible they could remove him out; wherefore the General gave
command to draw our Forces into Field to give him battle, and so we Marched
until we had sight of his Forces, and we Marched about to get the wind of
them, the which we obtained, and then our General gave command to draw out
part out of every Company, to be of the Forlorn Hope, to give the onset,
whereof my self was one of the number, and Doctor Burges our Minister did
encourage us to fight valiantly, and did assure us we should find our reward
in heaven: whereupon we feasted our selves with such victuals as we had, and
threw away our Snap-sackes, with all our Provision, both linen and woollen,
because it would be troublesome to us, and courageously providing us for the
battle, and upon the sudden we heard the Enemies Drums beat a Martch,
where we discried them to Martch back again to our Lodgings the next
morning, for we remained in the Field all that night, the next day our
General had notice given him, that the Enemy did martch toward the City of
Worms, wherefore he gave command the next night to martch without sound of
Drum, or displaying our Colors, thinking to meet with him before he came
to Worms: but the Enemy had intelligence of our coming, wherefore they
returned back into their Trenches that night, being extreme cold, that it
killed many of our Soldiers, as namely Captain Trussell, my Lieutenant, and
diverse others, whom died when they came to Garrison into Frankendale, which was
a little before Christmas, for the Rain and Snow began to fall, that we were
not able to lie any longer in the Fields: wherefore we marched into
Frankendale, where we have duty enough put upon us, for every third night we
watch at the Ports and Bulwarks, standing Sentinel on the walls with our
Arms in our hands: we do make them to stand, be he friend or foe, and cry que
vella? besides Alarums, which often times falls out, some times two or three
in a week: we had Alarm on the Saturday night before Shroue-Sunday, where
we were drawn all on the walls, and on the next night following we were
drawn out of the Town, expecting to meet with some of the Enemies Forces,
but we did not; and marching near unto Worms without sound of Drum or
displaying our Colors, they thought us to be Enemies, wherefore they shot at
us, and hurt two of our Company, wherefore we discried our selves, and Marched
back again: and now we are certified that Lepoltus the Emperors brother is
coming down with twelve thousand to aid Marquis Spindola against us, and
they have reported to besiege this Town and Worms both in one day, but before
they win them, it will cost them hot liquor, for our General gave command
to burn some Towns near unto us, because the Enemy shall not Entrench his
Forces near us, and the Boores that dwelt in them have brought their Goods
into our Town, and they themselves do work upon our Walls without the
Town, and are making half Moons, Sconces, Bulwarks, Counterscarfes, and
Trenches. We have had lately 12. Pieces of Ordinance from Worms to plant upon
our Walls, besides the Pieces that were planted before, which will encounter
with them before they come at our Town; and afterward, our nimble Muskatieres
will speak three words at once to them: We have in our Town many Streets,
and in every Street one Well with two Buckets of very good water, also a good
River running thorough the Town: and nevertheless, we have Wine in the Town
as plentiful as water, which is sold under three pence the quart: also Bread
and Beer as good and cheaper then in England, and so of Flesh and other
commodities. There was in our martch good Hogs sold for twelve pence a piece
and under, also Pullets, Pidgions, and other flesh very reasonable. I think we
shall not have the like penny-worthes when we come to England: but we hope
well, and purpose to make a trial of it, and now unwilling to be too tedious,
I will abruptly conclude. So remembering my love and commendations to all my
good friends, I rest: committing you to the protection of the Almighty, this 9.
of March. 1621.
