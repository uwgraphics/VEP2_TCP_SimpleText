Directions for the weak and ignorant Reader.
YOu first directed and taught me, how to teach you; I learned from you, not
from my Books, what questions to instruct you in, by observing your
misconceits of the first and necessary grounds of faith, and accordingly I have
framed this short Catechism: Many other points are needful for you, as to
understand the Creed, because else you cannot believe it: and the ten
Commandments, else you cannot know your sins, nor your duties: and also the
Lords Prayer, else you cannot tell how to pray: But for help herein, I refer
you to some short Catechism, where these Heads are expounded. Now that you may
profit by this take these directions: 1. Learn by heart the places of Scripture
brought for proofs, and ponder them in thy mind, till thou understandest how
they prove the point for which they are alleged. This will help thy
understanding; for it is not enough to say the words, unless thou understand
the matter. 2. Observe by the order of the parts, how and in what order God
does save men by Christ and be you sure to go that way. 3. Observe that the
Covenant of Life and Peace in Christ, and justification by faith do go before
the use of the Sacrament, as the Grant or conveyance of Land, does before the
sealing: and therefore you must first be in covenant with God, ere you can have
right to, or benefit by the Sacrament 4. For the great duty of examining your
selves, do thus: Lay the sign of trial before thee, and then ask thy
conscience, Is it thus and thus with my soul? For example for trial of thy
faith and repentance, put thy self to the question: How long have I had faith?
Have I indeed been wrought upon by the word of God? What change do I find in
my self since I was a believer? Spread all thy sins before thee, and then
demand, Soul how do I like of this or that sin? Do I make conscience of it? or
am I willing to enjoy it longer? to make excuses, and find pretenses for the
practicing of it? So for obedience and charity, examine thy self thus; Do I
desire and endeavor to know, and do Gods will in all things? Or am I willing
to hide mine cies from this or that daty, and to shift it off? Do I love the
godly because they be godly? Or can I sco^ne, mock, and despite them? Deal
faithfully with thy poor soul in this duty of examination and trial
remembering that before the act of receiving, thou do confess thy sins,
and profess before God and that Congregation, that the remembrance of them is
grievous unto thee, and the burden intolerable: do not now dissemble with God
and men: be sure of this, that if thou bring not grace, the Sacrament will put
none into thee. He that comes a Iuaas, shall go a Judas: he that comes an
unbeleever, or ignorant, or impenitent, shall go away so as he came, may in
worse case then he came. 5. And lastly, Labor for distinct knowledge in
matters of salvation, content not thy self with ungreauded conjectures, as I
think so, and I hope so. Build not on the sand, but be thou an hearer and a
doer of the word, so shall thou be able to day hold on eternal life. Amen.

An help for young People preparing for the worthy receiving of the Lords Supper.
Of Christ, and how he seveth us.
Q. HOW do you hope to be saved?

A. By Jesus Christ.

Q. Who is Jesus Christ?

A. Yes; for death is the wages of sin, and all that are sinners be under the
Curse. Gal. 3.10. To 6.23.

Q. How can the death of another save you?

A. Yes, Because Christ is our suertie, appointed of God to bear our sins, and

it our selves. Heb. 7.22. Es. 42.6. Es. 53.6. Gal. 3.1.3. Gal. 4.4.5. 2. Cor.
5.21. 1 Pet. 2.24

Q. How does Christ satifie Gods Justice for us?

A. Because he answered the law for us: Gal. 4.4, 5 To. 10.3.

1. Pet. 19.1. Cor. 2.8.

Of our need of Christ.
Q. DO you stand in need of Christ's righteousness to save you?

A. Yes: Because I and all the world are wholly corrupted with sin through

Q. What is the punishment due to sin and sinners?

A. The wrath of God, and eternal death in Hell fire.

said?

A. Yes, for his blood cleanses us from all sin, 1. Ioh. 1.7. Heb. 9.26.

Q. How can that be, seeing you confess that you are still a sinner?

A. Yes, though sin remain in me, yet I am cleansed from all sin for two
reasons.

justified by the blood of Christ: To. 8.1. To. 5.1. To. 10.4. To. 4.7.

Q. Why secondly?

A. Because by Christ, we are made free from the power of sin, so that sin
does not reign in us: 2. Co. 5.17.20. Gal. 2.17. To. 6.6, 114.1. Ioh. 3, 8.
To. 8.2.

Of the means to partake of Christ's righteousness.

A. No: only they that truly believe and repent of the evil of their doings:
Es. 1.16. Luke 13.3. Mark 4.17. Luke 24.47.

Q. What is faith?

A. It is a belief of the Gospel, whereby a sinner truly humbled for sin,
does trust and test upon Christ alone for salvation. Or thus; Faith is the

Q. Can we not be Justified before God by our works of obedience, and good
endeavors?

A. No, because in many things we fail all: and he that is a breaker of the
law cannot be saved by it. To. 3.20 To 4.5. Iam. 3.2.

Q. What is the true difference between the Doctrine of the law, and of the
Gospel touching salvation?

A. The law off^reth salvation to them alone, that do fulfill and keep it
perfectly in their own persons R^. ^0.5.

Q. How does the Gospel off^r us salvation?

A. By the righteousness of another, (i.) of Christ, apprehended and applied
to the humbled Soul by a lively faith: To 10 9.11. To. 4 6.13.

Q. Is true faith then void of good works, and of holiness of life?

A No: for then it were a dead faith, and it could not profit us, because
whosoever is in Christ is a new creature: Iam 2.14. 2. Cor. 5.17. John 15.2.

Q. What is the meaning then when you say we are justified by faith without
works?

A. The meaning is, that we are justified by Christ's righteousness only, and
that there is no need of our works to be joined with him in that business Romans
3.21.24.28.

Q. It seems then that God does receive us into his favor out of his mere
mercy in Christ alone, Imputing his righteousness unto us, and not our sins?

A. It is most true: 2. Cor. 5.21. Romans 4.5.6.

Q. The covenant also of life and peace is made in Christ, to them that believe
and repent without the condition of perfect obedience?

A. It is so. Romans 5.6. Gal. 2.17.1. Ioh. 2.2.

Q. This blessed doctrine is taught us in the Gospel, how else is it taught
and confirmed to us?

A. In the Sacraments.

Of the nature and use of the Sacrament, and of our preparation thereunto.
Q. HOw many Sacraments be there?

A. Two only: Baptism and the supper of the Lord:

Q. What is a Sacrament?

A. It is a Seal of the righteousness of faith: or a token of the Covenant of
peace between God and man. To. 4.11. Genesis 17.11.

Q. Say the same in other words?

A. A Sacrament is an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual
Grace given unto us: as in your Catechism:

Q. What is that spiritual Grace, whereof the Sacraments be outward signs and
pledges?

A. The favor of God doing away our sins in and by Christ Crucified: 1. Cor.
10.16. 1. Cor. 11.26. Heb. 9.26.

Q. How many parts be there of every Sacrament?

A. Two: first some outward bodily sign of Christ's own ordaining: secondly and
some spiritual Grace or Benefit thereby signified:

Q. What is the outward sign in the Lords supper?

A. Bread and wine given and received according to Christ's appointment.

Q. What is signified thereby?

A. The body and blood of Christ Crucified for our sins.

Q. What is the benefit of receiving these signs?

A. By them, as by a token and pledge from God himself, the worthy receives is
assured that be has a part and share in Christ's Death, and shall be saved
thereby.

Q. Do all that come to the Lords Table receive such a pledge of Gods favor?

A. No: only they that be worthy receivers: [the rest receive meet bread and
wine, and so profane Gods ordinance, and provoke Gods judgments against
themselves.]

Q. What must we do that we may be worthy receivers?

A. We must examine our selves whether we have first Faith. Secondly,
Repentance. Thirdly, New obedience. Fourthly Charity. [For the ignorant and
unbeleevers, the Impenitent, disobedient and uncharitable persons, be all of
them unworthy receivers.]

Q. What Faith is required in a worthy Communicant?

A. The profession of the true Faith, and the Grace of faith.

Q. Why is the profession of Faith required?

A. Because He that looks to partake of Christian Privileges, must know and
maintain the Articles of Christian religion.

Q. Where be the Articles of the Christian Faith contained?

A. In the word of God, and more summarily in the Creed.

Q. Do you understand the Creed?

A. Yes.

Q. Why is the understanding of those Articles of faith required?

A. Because if we do not understand the meaning of them, we can never believe
them.

Q. Many understand the Creed and yet are unworthy receivers: How may one be
assured that his knowledge is Sound and Saving?

A. By two signs of saving knowledge.

Q. What is the first?

A. It is a Renewing knowledge, it does not only acquainte me with Gods will
and ways, But also it works my heart to Obedience of the same. Luke 7.47.
Ioh. 13.17. To. 2.20. To. 6.17.2. Cor. 3.18.2. Tim. 3.5.

Q. What Is the second sign of saving knowledge?

A. It is an humbling knowledge, which makes me more and more to see how vile
I am, and how unable to do any thing that is good, and so to seek strength and
help from Christ. Phil. 3.7.8. To. 7.9. Job 42.6.

Q. You have said, that faith is the relying and resting of the humbled soul
upon Christ alone for salvation, How will you try your faith whether it be
sound and lively?

A. By two signs.

Q. What Is the first?

A. If it has been wrought in my heart by hearing and knowledge of the word of
God. To. 10.4.17. [for if we have always had this faith, as carnal persons
say they have had, it is a Counterfeite faith: for naturally we are borne in
unbelief, Neither does faith grow up with our Education, But it is a
supernatural gift of Gods spirit, wrought in us by the Gospel Ephesians. 2.8. To.
2.27. Gal. 5 6. To. 9.8. Ioh. 3.6.

Q. What Is a second sign of true faith, whereby it may be known?

A. By the fruit of Faith which is to make me walk by the rule of faith (i.)
the scripture, so that I shall not believe one thing and do the Contrary: [True
faith will make one to practice what he believes: else it is a dead faith.] ^am.
2.16.17. Act. 15 9.

Q. Why is this Gracy of faith required in a receiver?

A. Because by faith we are made partakers of Christ, and of the benefits of
his passion, which are set forth to us in the sacrament: [we must bring faith
to Gods promises, and Gods sacraments.] Heb. 3.14. Gal. 3.26, the second Grace
is repentance: He must examine himself in that.

Q. How will you know your repentance to be found?

A. By two signs.

Q. What Is the first?

A. If I make conscience of every sin, even because it is sin. Luke 16.10. Act.
24.16. Ps. 119.128. Genesis 39.9. [if we greive for sin because of shame that is a
worldly respect, and therefore a wordly sorrow, But if we greive for our sins
because God is offended, that is a Godly sorrow, because the respect and ground
of it is Godly.]

Q. What is the second sign of sound repentance?

A. Amendment: and forsaking of sin. [for true loathing and in^ard hatred of
sin, is accompained with a leaving of it, else it is but a mock sorrow.] Act.
26.20. Joel 2.13. 2. Cor. 10.11.

Q. Why is this Grace required in a Commun^cant?

A. Because God promises nothing to a wicked man, and therefore the sacrament
cannot seal nor assure him of any mercy in Christ. To. 25. Mat. 3.7.8.

Q. What is the Third Grace required in a worthy receiver?

A. Care to walk in New obedience. (i.) to abstain from evil, and exercise
our selves in that which is Good. To. 12.9. Es. 1.16.

Q. Why is new obedience required?

A. Because if we say, we have fellowship with Christ and walk in darkness,
we do but deceive our selves. 1. Ioh. 1.6. 1. Ioh. 3.10.

Q. What is the sign of true obedience?

A. Sincerity (i.) when without doubling of deceit, without dispensing or
pretenses for sin, we walk upright in the Commandments of God. Ps. 32.2.1.
Cro. 28.9.1. Cro. 12.33. [It is a spirit without guile, we must not hide our
eyes from any part of Gods will or of our duty.] Ps. 1 19.80.

Q. What is the fourth Grace required in a worthy receiver?

A. Christian love and Charity, especially toward all them that love and fear
God. 1. Co. 5.8.

Q. What is the first sign of Christian love?

A. If we love the Children of God because they be the Children of God, and
fear Him. 1. Ioh. 5.1. 1. Ioh. 3.12.14. Mat. 10.41.

Q. What is the second sign?

A. To do our brother no wrong but good if we can. To. 13.10.1. Cor. 1.5.

Q. What Is a Third sign?

A. If he has wronged us to forgive him. Ephesians. 4.32. Mat. 6.14.15.

Q. What is a fourth sign?

A. A fellow-feeling of our Brothers weal and woe [(i.) if we can rejoice at the
good that befalls our Neighbor, in his wealth, credit, gifts, preferment, and
graces, as if they had happened to our selves; and on the other side, if we can
heartly be sorry for the disgraces and losses which befall our brethren.] Pro.
24 18. Job 31.29.30. [especially if we can rejoice and greive for such good and
evils as befall them for Christ's sake, Name and cause.]

Q. Why is such love required in a Communicant?

A. Because we are members of one Head Christ Jesus: and are all partakers of
one Bread, one Hope, one Faith, and therefore should be of one mind and of one
heart. Act. 4.32. Ioh. 13.35.

Q. What if after examination we find not these graces to be in our selves?

A. They that be void of these graces cannot be worthy receivers, But if we
find them to be in us in truth and sincerity, though not in that measure we
desire, we may and ought to come to the Lords Table.

Q. By what means does God work these Graces in our hearts?

A. By the word preached and heard with an honest heart: by which also they are
daily increased. To. 14.10.

Other General questions.
Q. What is the estate of man by Creation?

A. An holy and happy estate: for man was at the first made like unto God in
holiness and righteousness, in goodness and immortallity. He was free from
sin and misery.

Q. What is the estate of all men through the fall of Adam?

A. An estate of sin and misery, for we are all of us originally very sinful
and miserable, Being enemies to all Goodness, and prone to all evil, and so
the objects of Gods wrath, and heirs of hell fire.

Q. What is the state of them that be renewed by Christ?

A. It is an estate of holiness and righteousness, which is begun here in the
kingdom of Grace, and shall be finished in the kingdom of Glory. [They that
are Christ's, are renewed in knowledge and holiness according to that Image
wherein Adam at the first was created, and they are acquitted from the guilt
and punishment of sin by the Blood and Intercession of Christ and finally,
they are entitled to an estate of Glory and Immortality with God in Heaven for
evermore.]

Q. How must we serve God here in this life?

A. According to his word, and not according to our own fancies and devises.

Q. How must we pray to God!

A. Only in the Name and mediation of Jesus Christ, praying for such things as
are agreeable to Gods will to give us.

Q. How shall I know that?

A. By the word of God which shows us what things God has promised, and
commanded and forbidden.

Q. How else may I know what things I may beg of God in prayer?

A. By the Lords prayer, wherein Christ has taught us what to pray for, so
that whatsoever we have need to pray for, or ought to pray for, it is contained
in those Petitions.
