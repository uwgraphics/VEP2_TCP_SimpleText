The cunning Northern Beggar, Who all the Bystanders does earnestly pray,
To bestow a penny upon him to day.

To the tune of Tom of Bedlam.


I Am a lusty beggar,
and live by others giving,
I scorn to work,
But by the highway lurk,
And beg to get my living:
I Will 'ith wind and weather,
And wear all ragged Garments.
Yet though I Am bare,
I Am free from care,
A fig for high preferments.
For still will I cry good your worship good sir,
Bestow one poor denier sir:
Which when I Have got
At the Pipe and Pot,
I soon will it casheere sir.
I have my shifts about me,
Like Proteus often changing
My shape when I will,
I alter still,
About the Country ranging:
As soon as I a Coatch see,
Or Gallants by come riging,
I take my Crutch,
And rouse from my Couch,
Whereas I lay abiding.
And still do I cry, etc.
Now like a wandering Soldier
(That has 'ith wars bin maimed
With the shot of a Gunne)
To Gallants I run,
And beg sir help the lamed,
I am a poor old Soldier,
And better times once viewed,
Though bare now I go,
Yet many a foe,
By my has bin subdued.
And therefore I cry, etc.
Although I nere was further
Then Kentish street in Southwarke,
Nor ere did see
A Battery
Made against any Bulwarks,
But with my Trulis and Doxes,
Lay in some corner lurking,
and nere went abroad
But to beg on the road,
To keep my self from working.
And always to cry, etc.
Anon I Am like a saylor,
And wear old Canvas clothing,
And then I say
The Dunkerks away,
Took all and left me nothing:
Six ships set all upon us,
Against which we bravely ventured,
And long withstood,
Yet could do no good,
Our ship at length they entered.
And therefore I cry good your worship good sir
Bestow one poor denier sir:
which when I Have got,
at the pipe and pot, etc.
The second part,
To the same tune.


SOmetime I like a Criple
Upon the ground lie crawling,
for money I beg,
as wanting a leg
To bear my corpse from falling,
Then seem I weak of body,
And long to have been diseased,
And make complaint,
As ready to faint,
And of my griefs increased,
And faintly I cry good your worship good, sir.
Bestow one poor desire sir,
which when I Have got,
at the Pipe and Pot,
I soon will it casheere sir.
My flesh I so can temper,
That it shall seem to feister,
And look all over,
Like a raw sore,
Whereon I stick a plaster.
With blood I daub my face then,
To faigne the falling sickness,
That in every place
They pity my case,
As if it came through weakness.
And then I do cry, etc.
Then as if my sight I wanted,
A Boy does walk beside me,
Or else I do
Grope as I go,
Or have a Dog to guide me:
And when I Am thus accounted,
To the highway side I hye me,
and there I stand
with cords in my hand,
And beg of all comes nigh me.
And earnestly, cry good your worship good sir
Bestow one poor denier, etc.
Next to some Country fellow,
I presently am turned,
And cry alack
With a child at my back,
My house and goods were burned:
Then me my Doxes follows,
Who for my wifes believed,
and along we two
together go,
With such mischantes grieved.
And still we do cry good your worship, etc.
What though I cannot labor,
Shall I therefore pine with hunger
No, rather then I
Will starve where I lie?
I Will beg of the money monger,
No other care shall trouble
My mind, nor grief disease me,
Though sometime the slash
I get, or the lash,
'Twill but a while displease me,
And still I will cry good your worship good sir
Bestow one, etc.
No tricks at all shall escape me,
But I will by my maunding,
Get some relief
To ease my grief,
When by the highway standing:
It Is better be a Beggar,
And ask of kind good fellows,
And honestly have
What we do crave,
then steal and go to' th'Gallowes:
Therefore 'Ile cry good your worship good sir,
Bestow one poor denier sir.
Which when I Have got
At the Pipe and Pot,
I soon will it casheere sir.
FINIS.
