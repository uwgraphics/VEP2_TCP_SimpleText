Robert Copland the translatour hereof to the Reders.
Gentle reders in consyderacion that every science, art, and faculte that are
speculate and practysed by Philosophers, not only ought to be showed and
taught unto such as be present with them in their days, but also for a
perpetual benefyte to be set forth by wrytynges vulgarily in every tongue, for
the more eredines and erudycyon of all young and pregnaunt practycyens, as
feign would attain to the perfytenes of every such science, art, and
faculte. And not withstanding that there be right many and sundry sorts,
as well of very good and scyentyke books, as of right expert men within this
Realm in the scyentycall art of Cyrurgery. Nevertheless this little
questyonary and formulary with the other books added thereto have been often
required and sought for, to be had in english (as well of me as of other) by
diverse and many persons of the said science. In consyderacyon aforesaid, and
that it is co^modyous, vtyle, behouefull, and benefycyall to the common wealth
of the said science and art. A certain young gentle man enured in the said
science have a book of the same in french moved the right honest person Henry
Dabbe bybliopolyst and stacyoner to have it translated in to english. At
whose instigacyon meaning the help of God (though most rudely) with the
symplenes of a good wyllyng heart I have enterprysed to do it in following
dyrectly my copy. For I knowledge mine enernyte in pronou^cyng the english of
the names and terms naturally expressed in the said book, as well in greek,
latyne, and other, which mine aucthour has not reduced in to french, which
names and terms I commit to the dyscrecyon, emendacyon, and grauyte of t^em
that have the perfytenesse of the said science and faculty. For as Phylyatros
says, many terms and names that are symply spoken in one language and
science is hard to be spoken in an other, except they be expressed, and what
they signyfye. wherefore curteys and gentle reders take this in worth, and
desyst mine ygnoraunce in the same with your scyentycall benevolence, and clear
fronysate intellygence. And Jesus preserve you. Amen.

Hereafter follows the questyonary of Cyrurgyens.
The Demand or questyon.
WHat is Cyrurgery? The responce or answer. Cyrurgery is science that teaches
the manner and qualyte to work / principally in knyttynge / in cuttyng / and
exercysyng other works of ye hand. In healynge of man, as much as it is
possible. And here science is put for kind. And albeit that Cyrurgery is of it
self proprely by art and no science / yet for the bond and affynytie that
art and science have each with other / sometime vnproprely that which is art
is called science / and that which is science is called art. It is otherwise
said (and better) that Cyrurgery is in two manners. One is that shows only
so yt by it we can do nothing as touching the operacion / and that proprely
is called science / as we say in physycke that there be.vi. manners of simple
appostumes / that is to wit.iiij. humeralles / one aignous / and the other
ve^tous. The other manner of cyrurgery is vsaunce / that is to say / that it
teaches to use / that he yt knows it may help him self therewith as many
times and as often as he will as touching Cyrurgycall operacions / so that by
it he is governed and ruled when he will use it / as by the Cyrurgery that he
has in his understanding / that teaches him that in all hot appostumes he
ought to put and lay to it repercutyues / saufe unto them that been in the
sumuytones / and to such as be venymous / This Cyrurgery or art that thou
haste in thine understanding / teaches the to work and use manually in
medecynes / and is proprely called art and not science. And in the end of thy
dyffynicion beside the particulers that are put for differences that are set
unto that which is possible / for it is not possible to all Cyrurgyens to
heal all them that are dyseased and sore. Demand. In what case ought a
Cyrurgyen to use very cure? And in what cases is he permytted to use only
palliatiue cures. Answer. In all cases ought he to use very cure / except in
three cases / where as alonely he is permitted the cure palliatyue. The first
is when the disease of them selfs are incurable as lazary. The second for ye
inobedyence of ye pacient to suffer the pains that he ought / because his
might can not suffer it / as is the Canker in a pertyculer member. The third /
if by the cure of such a disease there follows a greater inconuenyent / as in
to evil inueterate sores / or in to old emeroides / if there be not always
left an issue there as any danger is / for dread to fall in to ydropsy or
manyake / as Ipocras says in his Aphorysmes. Demand. Whereof is named
Cyrurgery? Answer. It is so named of chyr / that is a hand / and of Gow /
that is operacion / for it is a science that teaches to work by hand yt is
manually. Demand. What is the subject of cyrurgery? Answer. The subject of
Cyrurgery is the body of man that is diseased and sore able to be healed, for
it is therabout that the Cyrurgyen works. Demand. what is theffecte of
Cyrurgery? Answer. Theffect thereof is to take away the disease of man's body
/ and to keep it in health as much as it is possible.

Demand. In how many kinds or parties is Cyrurgery devised? Answer.
Ioha^nyce says that generally it is devised in two, that is to wit to work
in soft members / as in the flesh. And to work in the hard me^bres as the
bones. And partyculerly Cyrurgery is divided in.v. That is to wit to work in
wou^des / in appostumes / in sores / and in restoracyons / and in other things
belonging to handy operacyon. Demand. What diverse operacions exercises the
Cyrurgyen? Answer. In three diverse operacions. That is to wit dysolue the
thing continued / knyt the thing separated / and put out the superflue
thing. To dyssolue the thing continued is by incysynge / cuttynge / or
scaturysyng. To reioyne the separate as in consolydynge the wounds and
redusynge the lyppes. And to put out the superflue things, as in curyng
appostumes to cleanse them and put away the coores. Demand. How many and what
yrens ought a Cyrurgyen to bear in his case with him? Answer. He ought to
have.v. as Cysers / Nyppers / Launcettes / Rasoures / and Nedelles. Demand.
How many and what oyntementes commonly ought the Cyrurgyen bear with him?
Answer.v. That is to wit / an oyntement Basylycon for to ripe / Apostolorum to
cleanse / Aureum to increase flesh. And the white oyntement for to dry and
bind. And de Althea for to sowple.

Demand. Of how many things / and what things the Cyrurgyen takes his
entencions for to heal sore folks? Answer. That after Galyen in his
terapentyc they ben taken of three things. That is of things against nature /
of natural things / and of unnatural things / and also of their annexes.
And first he takes this indycacyon of things against nature / that is to wit
to the knowledge of the malady in his nature after Galyen in the second of his
terapentic. And than come unto the naturalles / and after to the vnnaturalles
and their annexes. And so after his indycacyons taken he ought to proceed to
the healyng of the pacyent in all that may lie in him possible. And let the
Cyrurgyen note that it is said / in all that may lie possible in him / because
it is not always possible. And with what things, and how. For as galyen says
toward ye end of his third book / and in the seventh of his said terapentyc
/ ^f the intencyons curatyues ben few / and according / the cure is easy to
the Cyrurgyen as in a simple wound. But where there is many consy^eracyons
which in it self are contrary / as in a holowe wound and apostumate and
nyghe to a noble membre, the Cyrurgyen ought to consydre.iij. things. The
first is, if there be two contrary diseases, whereof ye cure of the one lets
the other (which is most doubtful and dangerous if it remain) in such
case he ought to begin his cure at the most dangerous / and where there is
most peril in the remaining of it / and oftentimes more sooner in the
accydentes that happens in a sore / then in the sore self. As when a great
flux of blood overcomes in any wound or any sore fretynge that has corroded
any vain / in such case often he must leave the healynge of the sore for to
entende to the flux of blood that is so great. Likewise if in a sore were any
synew that was pricked whereof follows crampe / there must he begin at the
pryckyng of the synew for danger of the spasna, which is most peryllous. The
second thing that the Cyrurgyen ought to consydre is / if one of the said
dyseases be not the cause of the other, and nouryssheth not the other. In such
case he ought to begin at the cure of it that is the syller and nouryssher of
the other. For till that yt which is the causer of the other be totally
extyrped the healynge can not be. Demand. How many consideracions ought the
Cyrurgyen to have touching his form and general manner to work manually?
Answer. After Arnolde de villa noua, he ought to have.iiij. The first is he
ought to consydre what operacyon it is that he ought to do to man's body. And
it is known by the dyuysyon of the operacyons of Cyrurgery aforesaid / that
is to knyt the thing divided. The second consyderacyon is / that he ought to
consydre wherefore he works. And this is known by ye general intencyon of
Cyrurgery, that commands to do the operacions unto the body of man
profitably with confydence or surenes. The third consyderacyon is / that he
ought to consydre if such operacyon be necessary and conuenable to be done to
man's body. And this he knows when it can not be healed otherwise. And the
fourth consyderacyon is / that the Cyrurgyen ought to know how to bestow his
remedies to the body of man. In these consyderacyons the Cyrurgyen ought to
take heed in doing all things that he ought to do / as touching this
operacyon / as well before the workyng as after. The which.iiij. consyderacyons
thou may have and perceive by such an example. If thou wylt draw water fro
the belies of ydropikes by manual operacyon. First thou ought to consydre
that the operacion which thou wylt do is to draw out the said water. Secondely
thou ought to consydre wherefore thou do it / for it is for to ^eale / or at
ye least way to give ease. Thyrdly why there such operacyon be necessary /
nedeful / or possy^^e. And thou ought to wit that it is necessary at ^^ast
ways if thou wylt heal an ydropyke of the ^dropesy confermed / and thou
know that it is ^^defull and possible if the might of the pacyent ^e strong
/ for if it be weke be well ware for to do it. And fourthly thou ought to
co^sydre the manner to do it, which is such. First lie thy pacient vpryght, and
than with a rasour cut the skin of his belly under the nauel unto the void
places that are between the cyphac and the myrac. And also thou ought to make
incision on ye left side if the disease come of the right side. Contrarywyse
make ye incysion on the right side if it come fro the left, and than put a
little quyll or read in to the hole, wherewith thou shall draw out of that
water after the strength of ye pacient. And when thou wylt draw no more / take
away the quyll and let the skin of the belie go that will close the hole that
no more water come out. And when thou wylt draw any more do as thou did
before. Demand. How many and what condycyons ought a Cyrurgyen to have?
Answer, iiij, The first is that he ought to be learned and a clarke / and not
only in the pryncyples and beginning of Cyrurgery / but likewise in Phisyke,
and asmoche in theoryke as pra^tyke^ For in theoryke he ought to know the
natural things and vnnaturalles / and against nature, First he ought to
know the unnatural things / and chyefly the nathomy / for without it
nothing can be done surely in Cyrurgery / as it appears afterward more
plainly. Also he ought to know the complexyon of his pacient / for after the
dyuersyte of the nature of the bodies ought the medicines be diuersified as
Galyen declares all alonge in his terapentyke against Thesilus. And by like
reason ought he for to know the strength. Secondly he ought to know the
unnatural things, that is ye meat / the drink. etc. for they are cause of
all health when they be used as they ought to be. And also they be causes of all
maladies when they are evil used. Thyrdly he ought to knowledge the things
against nature, which are.iij. The disease, the causes, and the accydentes of
the disease. First he ought to know ye disease. Secondly the cause thereof /
for if he healed otherwise (it should not be of a saints disease / as good old
women say) it should be but case of adventure. Thyrdly he ought to know the
accydentes that chance to come in dyseases / for often times it preuaryeth the
same self cure of the dyseases / as Galyen declares in the beginning of the
book that he sent to Glauton his dyscyple. As I said before he ought for to
^^owe the unnatural things / and to mynystre them as they ought / that are
meat / drink. etc. Also by this ye shall understand that the Cyrurgyen ought
to know how to mynistre medicyns ^^^atyues / which are one of the
instruments of ^^^syke as of Cyrurgery / without the which the ^^^ence of
Cyrurgery can not be co^plete. And this (...) ought to know as touching ye
practice. Thus (...) appears the veryfycacyon of the first con^^^^yon that a
Cyrurgyen ought to have / for he ^^ght to be lettred and learned. And this
condycyon ^^^^areth Galyen in the first book of the Tera^^^^yke against
Thesyllo^, where he says at this ^^ynte. If Physycyens had nothing to do with
Astronomye / Geometrye / Logyke / Gra^mer / nor with other good doctrynes / the
Cobbelers / Corryers of lether / Carpenters / Smythes, and such manner of
people would leave their crafts and re^ne to Physyke, and become Physicyens. The
second co^dycyon yt a Cyrurgyen should have / is to be expert / and ought to
have sen other masters work. And this witnesses Auenzoar when he said thus.
It behooves that every Physycyen first know / and than to have use and
experience. The third condycyon that a Cyrurgyen ought to have / is that he
ought not to be a fool / vnwytty / nor of rude understanding. But as Haly
says in the third book de regni / he ought to be a man of good memory / of
good judgment / of good dylygence / of a clear sight / hole of mind / and of
his members, with sclender fyngers / and a steadfast hand without shaking. The
fourth condycyon is that a Cyrurgyen should have / is that he ought to be well
manered / bold / and sure in things that be not to fear. And doubtful, and
fearful in peryllous things. And ought to eschew all desperate cures / and
ought to be gentle to his pacientes, well wyllyng to his company / wyly in
pronostykynge / chaste / sobre / meke / and merciful / not anaricious / nor
extorcyoner for money. but after the capacyte of the pacyent / and the faculte
received / competent and moderate reward. Demand. How many and what
condycyons ought the pacyent to have that will be healed by the art of
Cyrurgery? Answer. That he ought to have.iij. condycyons. The first that he
ought to be obedyent to his Cyrurgyen / as the servant toward his master /
as Galyen declares in the first of his Terapentyke. The second condycyon of
the pacyent / is that he ought to have trust in his cyrurgyen / for he heleth
most in whom he trusts most / as Galyen says in the first book of
Pronostykes. And the thyde condycyon is / that he take pacyence in him self /
for pacyence is it yt overcomes. Demand. How many and what condycions
ought the assystentes and servants or mynysters of the pacyent have? Answer.
As Galyen says in the end of the first comment of the afforysmes. The
condycyons of the company / mynysters and servants of them that are diseased
ought to be such as pleases the pacyent / so yt they ought to have agreeable
servants put to them, being true, loving, peasyble, gentle, and dyscrete.

Here begins the second treaty / wherein is moved and assoyled certain
questyons and dyffyculties touching the Nathomy.
Demand.
WHyther the science of the Nathomye be necessary and needful to the
Cyrurgyen or not / and by how many and what manners? Answer. Yee^ The science
of the Nathomy is needful and necessary to the Cyrurgyen / as it appears by
two reasons. The first Galyen puts in the.vj. book of his Terapentyke, and
is such, for the Cyrurgyens that be ygnoraunt in the Nathomy may arre in many
manners in their incysyon of synewes and their knyttynges, the which if they
knew the nature of every member, their setting and colligacion that they have
in all the body, and with every only membre partyculer / if it did happen yt
they were hurt they should know if the synewes were cut or not. And by this
same reason they should not arre in their incisions. And this reason is
confyrmed by an example yt Henry de Mau^deuille puts / saying that the same
manner that a blind man works in hewynge of a log, so does a cyrurgyen that
knows not the nathomy. For like as a blind man that heweth on a log knows
not how much he should hew thereof, nor how, and therefore commonly he arreth
hewynge more or less than he ought to do. Likewise so does the Cyrurgyen that
works in man's body without the Nathomy. Also the said Henry approves that
the Cyrurgyen ought of necessyte to know ye Nathomy, for every workman is
bound to know the subject of his work in which he works, or else he should
arre in workynge. Tha^ likewise if it so be that the subject of the Cyrurgyen
be the body of menkynde, it must be of necessyte that the Cyrurgyen do know ye
body of mankind in it self / and in the parties thereof, so tha^ it is
necessary for a Cyrurgyen to know the Nathomy. And this is for the first
part of the questyon. The second part where is demanded to how many and
what things the science of Nathomy is necessary to the Cyrurgyen. That is to
wit how many proffytes and vtylities be of the science of Nathomy? The
answer. The science of the Nathomy is necessary and needful to the Cyrurgyen
for.iiij. vtylyties. The first and the greatest is for ye marvel of the
great power of God the creator of men, that so has made them to his lykenes
and form. The second is for to have the knowledge of the members yt may be
dyseased. The third for because to have knowledge to tell the disposicions to
come of ye me^bres. The fourth is for to heal the dyseases yt come to the
me^bres. Demand. What is Anathomye, and whereof is it deryuate? Answer.
Anathomy is the right determynacyon and dyuysyon of every partyculer membre of
ye body of mankind. And is deryuate of Ana, that is to say (night) that is to
say (dyuysyon.) Thus Anathomy is called night dyuysyon of members done for
certain knowleges. Demand. In how many and which manners ought ^he science
of Anathomy be taught? Answer. In ^wo manners. That is to wit by way of
doctrine as by books written thereof. In seeing and redynge that which has been
wryte^ by au^cyent doctors / and by experyence / in deuysynge and
Anathomysynge the dead corpses. As did Mundy and Bo^oyne, and as likewise did
master Bertruce, that when he had a dead body by beheadyng or other wise / he
laid him on a benche in making.iiij. partycyons. In the first he divided the
nutratyf me^bres, for they be dysposed to putrefaccyon. And in the second the
spyrytuall members. And in the third the anymall me^bres. And in the fourth
the extremyties. And upon every member ought to be sought.ix. things. That is
to wit the posycyon / the complexyon, the substance, the quantyte, the nombre,
the figure, the operacyon, the vtilite, and what dyseases may come thereunto.
Demand. What is the body humayne? Answer. It is one hole together decorate
with reason / composed of many and diverse members. Demand. what is membre?
Answer. Diverse auctours have given diverse diffinicions. G. in the first book
of the vtylyte of the partycles says it is a body that is not holly separate,
nor holly conioynt to another. And also in the first book of his canon he
defyneth it in plurell, and says thus, that me^bres ben bodies that are
engendered of the first co^myction of humors. Demand. How many manners of
members are found? Answer. Two. That is to wit, simple members called
conse^blables, and me^bres compost. The simple members ben they that may not be
divided into another kind, but what party thou take of them it bears always
ye name and the dyffynycyon of his hole. As the bone / for what part thou
take of the bone be it more or less ever it bears ye name and diffinicion
of the bone, for every part of a bone in bone / and every part of a synew in
synew. The compost members contraryly be they that may be divided in other
kinds, for no part of them separated bears not away the name of all. As the
hand, the leg, the head. Demand. How many simple me^bres ben there?
Answer. There be.xi. That is to wit the bones, grystles, or cartilages, the
synewes, the veins, the anteres, the pannicules, the s^rynges. The cords, the
skin, the flesh, the greece or fat, the hear, and the nails. The which
although that verytably they be not members / nevertheless in asmoche as they
have vtylyte in ye body of man kind, and have regeneracyon as the members,
they be called members, though it be vnproprely.

Demand. If all the me^bres may regenerate after their perdicion, and knytte
again after their dislocacio^^ Answer. For to declare that behooves two
things to be noted. First yt the simple members be of two manners. Some be
sanguyne members of whom the generation is of sanguyne matter, as the flesh
and the greece. And the other me^bres be spermatyke members so named / because
they have their breding and beginning of sparmatyke matter. Secondly it is to
be noted yt there be two manners of regeneracyon. One is very regeneracion,
which is very reformacion of the member in the same self substance, form,
qualyte, and quantite, and other such accidents proprely as it was before the
corrupcion and alteracion. And the other is regeneracyon not very / but like
thereto as nyghe as may be. And likewise there is.ij. manners of consolydacyon /
one is true, that is when both the parts of the thing that is dyssolued by
seperatynge / and reassembled and knyt without any manner of apperynge of the
dyssolucyon before / and without any means. And ye other is untrue
consolydacyon / and like to the other as nyghe as can be done, by means of the
poor that the Physycyons call Porus sarcoydes. These things ^^derstande and
noted / I say first that all sanguyne members may regenerate and knyt by very
regeneracion and consolidacion, for contynually there engenders blood enough
within the body for to regenerate the substance of the sanguyne membre lost,
and for to reconsolidate and knyt it again. I say secondly that no members
sparmatyf after the loss of their substance may not regenerate because that
their matter is attribuate to them at the very beginning of their creacyon, and
after that never engendre again. And also for their so lidite, and because
they are weke of here and moisture. And for these causes and reasons they do
not reconsolydate with true reconsolydacyon after the desolucion of their
seperatyng, but nature strengthynge always possible things the best that she
may / will not leave them thus dyssolute, reioyneth and knytteth them the best
that she may / and engenders a flesh (for to hold ye dissolved parties)
that is called porus sarcoydes. Demand. Be all the members consemblables of
one co^plexyon. Answer? No / for some be hot and moist / and the other cold
and moist / and other cold and dry. And of the hot and dry there is none /
for among all members co^se^blables, there is none more hot and dry tha^ the
skin that is temperate. And it is not only temperate among the members of
mankind / but also among all the substau^ces of things that may engendre and
corrupt / as Galyen says in his first book of co^plexyons / and the last
Chapter. The members hot and moist be the me^bres that are sanguyne / as the
flesh / the spyrytes / and the natural humydities / as wylleth Auerroys in
the ^^. of collyges. The members cold and moist are the flewme, fat / or the
greece, and the maroughes. The members cold and dry are all the other me^bres
after their degrees / as the bones / the cartylages / the strings or cords /
the lygumentes, the ^^newes / the veins / arteres / and pannycules. And here
is the main see / where as it behooves ney^her Physycyen nor Cyrurgyen to
sail, for a phy^^eyen and Cyrurgyen ought for to know ye com^^^xion of the
me^bres / as natural Philosophers. Demand. Which are the me^bres compostes /
and wherefore are they called organykes and instrumentalles? Answer. The
members compostes be me^ores that are composed of the simple and consemblable
members. And therefore they be called therogenes / that is to say of diverse
natures / and may be divided in diverse kinds / that is to wit in to members
consemblables / and their parties bears not away the dyffinycion and reason of
the hole. As to the second questyon that asks why they be called organykes
and ins^rumentalles? The answer is, because they are ins^rumentes of the soul
/ as by the hands / the fete / the liver / ye face, and the semblables.
Demand. How be the organyke members ordained and composed. Answer. Some of
these members be pryncypalles / and the other not pryncypalles. Demand. How
many vnpryncypal members be there? and how many vnpryncypal. Answe^e. There
be.ii^^. pryncypalles / that is to wit the heart / the liver / the brain /
and the genytalles / all the other be called vnpryncypalles. Demand. Of what
complexyon is the heart? Answer. The heart is hot because it is like the very
bre^nynge hot oven of all the body / fro whens comes the heat to all the
body. And albeit that Philosopher have wylled to say that it is te^perate
because it is pryncyple / and that it gives beginning of life. Nevertheless
the heart is dry in his complexyon because of his composycyon / for it is
composed of strings and pannycles / and of hard and styf flesh. Demand.
Of what complexyon is the liver? Answer. It is hot and moist. For the mos^e
part of the things that it is composed is flesshely / blody / and therewith
ben transmysed diverse pypes or arteres.

Demand. Of what complexyon is the brain? Answer. It is cold and moist,
because it has a marowy substance. Nevertheless it differs fro the
maroughe / because the brain is a sparmatyke membre / and the marough is a
sanguyne membre. And thereby it is cold in comparyson of other members / and
that not symply / for all members be naturally hot. Demand. Of what
complexyon are the kydneys and the mylt? Answer. The kydneys be hot and
moist / howebeit the kydneys be not so hot as ye mylt, because of the gross
blood that is in the mylt, like as the mylt is not so hot as the liver.
Demand. Of what complexyon is the longes? Answer. Hot and moist. It is
hot because that heat is sent to it from the heart as Galyen says in ye
fourth book of ye vtylite of the particles / and is moist / but not so moist
as the greas / for it melts not at the fire as the greas does.

Demaundes upon the Anathomy of the skin or the lether.
Demand. What is the skin. Answer. It is a covering of the body of
mankind / ^at is composed and context and wonen with thre^s and veins / with
synewes and arteres / for to ^^^^nde the body and give it feeling. Demand.
(...) many manners of skyn^es or lether are there? ^^swere. Two, one is
extrynsyke or outforth, and ^^at is proprely called lether. The other is intryn
^^ke / and that is proprely called pannycle rym or skin as be those of the
head yt cover the brain and the skull / and they yt cover ye bowelles of ye
body.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the greas.
Demand. What is the grease? Answer. It is a thing in the humayne body /
that is as oil that chauffeth and humecteth the body. Demand. How many
manners of greas be there? Answer. Two. The one is without forth nere to the
skin / and that proprely is called adeps or fatnes. And ye other is inward
and nyghe to the belly / and proprely is called auxunge or fat grease.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the flesh.
Demand. How many manners of flesh are found? Answer. Three. One is very
flesh and propre / and it is found but in a little quantite, and one in two
places of the body of mankind. That is on the heed of the yerde / and between
the tethe. The other is glandulouster, odenose, or cruddy and kyrnele, as is
the flesh of the ballockes / of the dugges and the flesh of the emuntores.
The other is flesh musculous or lacertous yt is hard as bawme styffe or
knotty. And this is found in great quantyte, and over all the body where as is

Demand upon the muscles and lacertes.
Demand. Be the muscles simple membres^ Answer. yea, as touching the
sensyble judgment / Howbeit of very troth they are me^bres composed of synewes
/ of lyens / strings / thredes^ and flesh that fulfylleth them / and of the
pa^nycule that covers them. Demand. Wherein agrees and differ the muscles
and lacertes? Answer. It is all one thing / which after diverse consyderacyons
has been called muscle and lacerte / for it is called muscle for his
resemblaunce of a mouse / that in latin hight mus. And it is called lacerte
^ycause it has thy form of a Lyzard / for like as those two beestes are byg
in the middle and sclender toward the tail / so is the muscle or lacerte.
^Demaunde. What is the manner and how do the muscles and lacertes proceed in
the body of mankind. Answer. After that the muscles is composed as is
aforesaid / from it discendeth round strings and cords that comes nygh to
the joints / the which when they be nygh the joints they do ^^^de abroad and
enlarge / and reyse the joint all ^^out with the pa^nycle that covers the
bones. ^^d when they are passed the joint / they do wax ^^unde again / and
return into cords and with ^he flesh make another muscle. And of this
mus^^^ proceeds and ryseth another round cord and ^^^^ges that byndeth the
joint all about and moe^^^^^^. And so cease not to proceed till they come
(...) ^he extreme and ferthest partycles of the body. (...) thus always ye
muscle proceeds the ioynture. ^^d as the synewes that proceed of the noddle
ta^^th form of muscle at the neck and at the breast, and than comes to the
joint of the shulder. And ^eco^meth round strings and spredynge flat in
comprysynge all the joint / and do plant them in the bone of the ioynte and
moeueth it. And when they come fro the joint of ye sholdre a two or three fyngre
bread they wax round in cordewyse. And with the flesh and string that
comes from the head to the bone of the shouldre is made muscle upon the
mids of the bone of the ioynture / fro which comes a cord that three
fyngre bread fro the elbow enlarges and compriseth all the elbow and moeueth
the little arm. And three fyngers be ponde it waxes round and retourneth in
to a cord. The which with the string that comes fro the neck and with the
flesh make a muscle upon the said little arm / of the which muscle is made
a cord / and three fyngers fro the ioynte of the little hand it spredeth and
compriseth all the ioynture of the said hand / than it twisteth round again
and enters the muscle of the mids of ye hand / of the which comes cords
that move ye fyngers, by the which things it appears that the wounds that
are made about three fyngers of the joints be peryllous, for the synewy cords
be made bare of the flesh and apparentes. Of the which all only pryckynge
is cause of spasme or crampe / and of death as Galyen says in the third book
de regny, and in the second of his terapentyc / which is to be noted of the
Cyrurgyen.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the synewes.
Demand. What is synew. Answer. It is a simple membre created to give
feeling and mouyng to the members deputed to nature. Demand. For how many
distributary intencyons were they created? Answer. After Galyen in the fourth
book of the vtylyte of the partycules in the last Chapter, they were created
for three intencions. One is to give felyng to the organykes sensytyfes. The
second to give moeuynge to the motyfe or styrynge members. And thyrdly to give
knowledge to all the other members of the things that hurt them. And it is
notably said to the sensytyfe or felyng members. For in the cartilages or
grystles, nor in bones, nor glaudylous or cruddy ^lesshe the synewes be not
penetrate but in ye teth / as Galyen says in ye book aforesaid. Demau^^^^ Fro
whens bredeth the synewes? Answer. All the synewes of the body bread and come
out of the ^^ayne by it self / or of the noddle that is his vy^^^^, between
the which some bread of ye foreparte (...) the brain / and they be softer and
more propre ^ g^ue felyng than mouyng. And the other come (...) and bread of
the hyndre part of the noddle / (...) descend fro the brain / and these be
har^^^^ more propre to give mouyng than feeling. ^^emaunde. If the feeling and
moeuynge by one ^^^^ynew alone or by many? Answer. After Ga^^^n in the first
book of the interyours / sometime they are borne by one synewe alone, and
sometime by many. Demand. How many parell or like synewes be there that
without mean spryng and bread of ye brain. And how many pareyle or like
synewes comes fro it by mean of the noddle? Answer. Fro the brain
i^mediatly springs.vij. pereylles. And.xxx. pareylles come fro it by mean of
the nuke that bread behind by the end of the lossarn / as Haly Abas says in
his book de Regaly dispositione, in ye second sermon of the fore party.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the strings ^r lyens.
Demand. Of what nature ben the lyens or strings / and whereof bread they?
Answer. They be of the nature of synewes / howebeit they bread of the bones.
Demand. How many manners of lyens or strings be there? Answer. Two. Some
binds the bones inward. And the other byndeth the joints outward / as
Galyen says in the.xii. book of the vtilite of the partycles in the first
Chapter, of cowplynge of bones / that they are comprysed about with strong
brau^ched strings.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the cords.
Demand. Of what nature are the corbes? Answer. The strings ben almost as
all of one nature / for both be of the nature of synewes / but yet the cords
more than the strings. For like as the strings be mean among the cords and
the bones / so be the cords mean among ye strings and the synewes. Demand.
Whereof bread the cords / and whens take they feeling and mouynge. Answer.
They bread of the muscles / and take feeling and mouynge of the synewes /
whereby the members are moved. Demand. Wherefore is it that when the cords
withoutforth are cut the membre leseth bowynge / and when they withinforth are
cut the member leseth ye stretching. Answer. Albeit the cords be round when
they issue of the muscle, yet do they sprede when they ^ome to the joint / and
they are lyens or strings that are set round about the said joint / as the
cords about the member / so that they withinforth ^^awe the member / and they
withoutforth do stretche it. And when the one draws ye other loses. And
(...) when they are cut outward the bowynge is (...). And when they are
cut inward the stret^^ynge is lost.

Questyons upon the Anathomy upon the veins and arteres.
Demand. What is a vain? Answer. It is the place of the blood of
nourysshyng. De^^^^. What is artere. Answer. It is the pla^^ the spyrytuall
blood. Demand. Wherein ^^ag^e and differ the veins fro the arteres. An^^^^.
They do agree in that they be of consembla^^ dystryoucyon through all the body
/ that is in ^^rynge of blood. And they dyffer in two things. The first
appears by their dyffynycyons aforesaid / that is yt the veins bears the
nourysshyng blood / and the arteres the spyrytuall blood. The second
dyfference between them is taken of the place of their breding. For the veins
bread of the liver, and the arteres of the heart as Galyen says in the.xvij.
book of the partycles. Demand: Do they separe in any wise one from the other
in the body of mankind / so that the veins may be without the arteres, and
the arteres without the veins. Answer. In some places the veins do separe
from the arteres. And the arteres be found without veins. As it is manifest
both in ye arms / and in rethe mirable, howbeit no vain is found without
artere. Demand. What is the manner of procedyng of the veins and arteres
through the body? Answer. When they go forth of the place of their breding,
they re^ne forkewyse in two parties / the one upward and the other downewarde
/ and yet of them every party braunchet^ and proceeds unto the last and
extreme parties of ye body for to nourysshe and give life to all the members
thereof.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the bones.
Demand. Wherefore are the bones made? Answer. Because they should be the
foundacyon of all the body and susteynynge thereof. And therefore they are made
hard and strong the better to here the burden of all the other. Howebeit some
of ye bones are made for the defense of the inward members / as the bones of
the heed, the breast bone, and the back bone. Demand. How many in nombre are
all the bones in a body of mankynde^ Answer. Auycen says that there
is.CC.xlviij. saufe the bone that is called (os laud) whereto the tongue is
founded. The which bones thou may consider and se by the figure here before
written / and of which partyculer mencyon shall be made, and declared in this
present treaty. Demand How ben the dyuersytyes among the bones of the body
of mankind? Answer. They be deuersyfyed in diverse manners / for some because
of ye joints are full of maroughes / and the other not. Some are straight /
and other crooked. Some are little / and ^ome byg. And all bones are bygger at
the ends ^han in the mids by reason of the joints. And ^ome are enbossed
for to enter, and other have va^nytees that receives. And some have both the
one and ye other. And other have neither one nor the other. And of them that
have enbossynges and ^a^uytees, some have them clauelares like keys (...) ye
teth / And other ben sacratyles or saw wise, as the skull of the head. And
other knotty in each ^^de as v^na in the thyghe. Other be foueable or ^olow as
the faucylles or forke bones. Other have both sorts as the fyngers. And they
that have ^eyther one nor other ben joined solidatiuely, and they that have the
enbossynges and vacuacyons be they that make the joints / of whom comes
dyfloracyon and other separacyons.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the cartylages or grystles.
Demand. What is cartylage? Answer. It is a substance as it were of the
kind of bones, but it is softer or sowpler than the bone is. Demand.
Wherefore were the cartylages made? Answer. For two reasons. One to fulfill the
lack of the bone / as in the palpebres or eye lyddes / the nosethyrlles, and
ears. The second to make the better coniu^ction of the bones with the parties
next them, as in thorax and parties of the loins / because that the soft
substance, (as the flesh and other parties) be not hurt by the mouynge of
the bones which are hard.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the nails.
Demand. Wherefore are the nails made of the utter parts of the body?
Answer. The better to take hold.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the hears.
Demand. Wherefore were the hears made^ Answer. For two reasons / that is to
wit / to increase beauty and to purge.

Here ends the first partycle of the second treaty. And begins the
second ptycle / where as is moved and ass^ysed certain questions and
difficultees upon the Anathomy of the members composed.
Demand.
WHat is the skull or scawpe of the head? Answer. It is that part of the
head that is full of hear / wherein the anymal members are contained.
Demand. Upon the seven things yt a good Anathomypost ought to consydre on
every member which are in the skull or scawpe of the heed. Answer. First his
helpyng appears by diffinicion abouesayd. The posycyon thereof is on the
highest place of the body. The col^ygaunce is notorious / for it has
collygaunce with the face and the neck, and of it comes all the parties of the
face / and the muscles mouyng the head be planted in the neck / which are
of.ij. manners. Some be proprely lacertes that bread nyghe the ^^res / till they
come to the furcules or forkes of (...) breast. The other be co^myn in the neck
and heed / which shall be said when we speak of the neck. The quantyte is
more in man than in any other beast / as the brain is more in man than in any
^ther beast. The form thereof is round compry^ate lightly fro one part to
another. And it be^oueth that the part before and behind be bony / ^s Galyen
says in the second de regni. And the ^ther cause of this form says Galien
in the.viij. ^oke of the vtilite of the partycles / because that it may be the
less passyble. The substance is bony and full of maroughe as appears by
experyence. The complexyon is cold by means of ye parties that it is composed
of be cold. Demand. Of how many and what parties is ye scawpe of the head
composed. Answer. After Auycen in the.ii^. book of his canon and.j. Chapter
it is composed of.x. parties. That is to wit.v. conteynyng and v. sundry. The
contenau^tes that be without, first ben the hears / than the lether or skin
/ and than the flesh musculous / than the great pa^nycle, and than the brain
pa^ne skulle or crane. And the sundry ensuyng withinforth ben the dura matter
and the pio matter / and than rethe myrable / and than the substance of the
brain, and than the bone that is the foundacyon of the brain / and than the
rotes of the synewes yt bread of the brain / which shall be spoken of by
order. Demand. Of what substance is the great pa^nacle that is called
Per^eranium / and whereof bredeth it / and with what parties has it
collygaunce? Answer. First it is a neruous or synewy substance. Secondly it
is bred of the dura matter. And thyrdly it has collygau^ce with the said dura
matter / and is bound with it / by strings / synewes / and veins that go in
and out by ye co^myssures or seames of the brain pa^ne or skull. Demand. Is
the brain pa^ne of one bone or of many / and for what reason? Answer. It is
of many, for it is of.vij. that join together / and is so ordained because that
if anoyau^ce come to one that it should not come to another / and is conioynte
with the co^myssures called sarratylles seames endented as tethe of a saw to
thyntent that the fumosytees or vapors may have issue fro the brain.
Demand. Which are the.vij. that the head is composed of? Answer. The first
bone of the fore part is called Coronall / that dureth and compryseth fro the
mids of the orbytauntes unto the co^myssure that trauerseth the Crane or
skull. And in it is the holes of the eyes and the collatores of the
nosethyrlles. The which col^atores be departed by the addyng of bones in ma^er
of a crest of a he^ne / within the which is fast^ed the cartylages or grystles
that deuydeth the ^osethyrlles. Howbeit it is to wit that sometime ^he coronall
is divided by a co^myssure in the mids of the browe / which most often is
found in women, The second bone of the head in the hyn^^e part is called
Occipitall / and is enclosed by a ^o^myssure thwartly in manner of a greek
lettre cal^^ Lampda / and is hard / and full of perced holes (...) by the
which descends the nuke of the ^^ayne through the mids of the spondylles
or ^^dge bones till unto the end of the back, The ^^yrde and fourth bone of
the head ben in the myd^e of the sides thereof / and therefore they high
pery^^sles / and be divided by a co^myssure after the ^ength of the noddle of
the head / and by two commyssures be led unto the bones of the ears / and are
square, The, v, and the, vj. be ye bones that are called Petrous / for they are
hard as a ^tone, Also they be called Scamous or scale / for they be conioynte
in manner of the scales of a fysshe with the said parietalles which are the
holes of the ears, and the instruments mamylares of ye emu^ctures. And be
braunched as like the bones called peryetalles with ye co^myssure (called
Lampda) unto the bones of the temples. The.vij. bone is the bone bafylare /
that is like a wedge that closes and susteyneth all the said bones over the
rofe / and this bone is perced and has great spongeosyte to purge the gross
superfluytees and is of a gross substance. And these.vij. bones abouesayd are
pryncypalles. Howbeit beside these said bones there are yet other small bones
less pryncypalles that are made for certain helps, as is the bone of the
crete that deuyde the nosethyrlles within the coronall / and the equal bones
that are in the face. And the clauall bones y^ are the bones of the ears
whereunto are fastened ye muscles and cords that cover the Jaws. Demand.
How ought the parties inward of the head be well seen and known at the eye?
Answer. Ye ought to deuyde the skull with a saw after the roundenesse.
Demand. What is the dura matter and pie matter? Answer. They be two pa^nycles
full of veins and arteres / whereof one is of the party of the head / and the
other of the party of the brain / that wrappeth and covers all the
substance of the brain. Demand. From whens comes the nourysshynge in to
the brain? Answer. It comes fro the soft mother by veins and arteres that
comes by ye holes of the inward bones / and outward by the co^myssures of
the superyour bones. Demand. Where is the substance of the brain sytuate /
and of what shape, and of what substance and color is it of? Answer. First
it is situate under the foot of hard mother / and is round in shape / and white
of color. Demand. By what reason are the members organykes / sensytyues /
and diverse other double. Answer. Because that if one of them suffered the other
should not suffer. Demand. How many ^^lies has the brain after his length /
and how ^any parts in each ventrycle / and how many and what virtues takes
their orygine in each party? Answer. First ye brain in length has three
ven(...) / that is to wit / the ventrycle before / that (...) / and that in the
mids / and the anteriour and mean / each is divided in.ii. parties. In each
(...) one virtue takes his origyne. In the fyrs^e (...) of the ventricle
before is put ye common blood. (...) second y^ virtue of ymagynacyon. In the
(...) ventry^le is put the cogitatyfe and racyo^^^. And in the hinder ventrycle
is put the virtue (...) or memoratyfe. Demand. Whi^^ of these three ventrycles
are the byggest? An^were. The formoste is the byggest? The myddle ^ost the
least, and the hyndermost is mean. Demand. Has the blood of ye other
ventrycle any ways? Answer. Yes, wherthorow all the spirits pass. Demand.
In which of the ventrycles is the wit of smelling founded? Answer. In the
foremost ventrycle where the addyng mamyllares are / it is founded. Demand.
How many cowples of sensityfe synewes come fro the brain / and fro which
part? Answer. From the anteryour part comes.vij. pair of synewes
sensytyfes which go to the eyes / to the ears / to the stomach / and other
me^bres. Demand. In which ventrycle of the brain ben the places called
lacune / vernus / fornus / and ancafernis / and the glaudynous flesh that
fulfylleth them? Responce. They be in the mean ventrycle. Demand. Where is
rethe mirable set, and whereof is it composed? Answer. It is set under the
pa^nycles / and is only composed of arteres yt comes fro the heart. Demand.
Where is the vital spirit made anymall and how? Answer. It is made of the said
arteres that rethe myrable is composed by the labor of ye complexyon of the
brain? Demand. Is ye nuche any party of ye brain? Answer. It seems to be
a party thereof, and therefore the signs and accidents are as they of the
brain / as Galyen says in the.xi. book of the vtylyte of the partycles.
Demand. Whereof bredeth the maroughe of the nuche, and how? Answer. It
bredeth of the hinder part of the brain / wrapped with two pannycles as the
brain. Demand. How proceeds the maroughe of the nuche / and what synewes
bread of it? Answer. It descends by the spondyles unto the end of the back
/ and of it bredeth motyfe synewes. Demand. What dyseases may come to the
scalpe of the head? Answer. There may come wounds / appostumes / and ill
complexyons. Demand. What wounds of the scalpe of the heed be most
peryllous? Answer. To penetrate all the skulle / but more the touching the
rymmes / but most of all yt touches the substance medulare. Demand.
Wherefore is it that the operacyons Cyrurgycalles that are done about ye
co^myssures be suspecte? Answer. For fear lest the dura matter fall not on the
pie matter / and that it compryme the brain. Demand. How ought the incy^^ons
of the heed be made? Answer. They ought ^^ ^e made according as the hears do
proceed / (...) so proceeds the muscles.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the face / and parties thereof.
Demand. Which are the parties of the face / whereof it is composed? Answer.
The ^^owes / the iyes / the nosethyrlles / the ears / the ^^mples / the chekes
/ the Iawe bone / with ye teth. Demand. Whereof is the forheade comsed?
Answer. One of the skin and musculous flesh / ^or the bone underneath is of
the coronall. Demand. How is the form of the brows made? Answer, Of the
bone that is under the browe, for ^he spongeosite of the second table of y^
said bone is raised alonge as if it were double / and that makes the form of
the brows. Demand, wherefore are ye brows made, Answer. They are made for
the more beauty / and to save the eyes / and therefore the eyes are armed with
them, Demand, How ought incysyons be made in those parties? Answer. They
ought to be made after the length of the body / for so proceeds the nuche, and
not after the rugnesse. Demand. Wherefore are the eyes made / and where are
they set? Answer. They are made to be instruments of the sight / and are set
within the bone arbytall that is a party of the coronall / and the bones of the
temples. Demand. Wherefore are the synewes obtykes perced? Answer. For to be
the way of the spyryte vysyble. Demand. What is the manner that proceeds the
obtyke synewes from their bredynge unto the eyes? Answer. It is thus / for
first they proceed from both the sides / one here and another there. And when
they are wtin the skull they come and join together / and than deuyde them
each from the party that it is bread / and proceed not thwart each over other
cross wise from the right side to the left side / nor fro the left side to the
right side, as some have wened. Demand. Of how many vestures or tunycles ben
ye eyes composed? Answer. Of.vij. The first without is called coniu^ctiua /
that is thycke and white. And it compasses all the eye / except that yt
appears of that yt is called cornea / and it is bred of the pa^nycle that
covers the skull that compasses all the eye / suppose that in it self is but
three / yet for the dyuersyte of colors that takes about the mids of the
eye that is called yris, it is said that there is.vj. where of the other three
ben of the party of the brain / the other three be of the party withoutforth.
The first bredeth of dura matter / and in the inward party it is called
slirotiqua / and in the outward cornea. The second bredeth of pia matter / and
of the inward party it is called Secundina / and of the outward party it hight
vnca. The third bredeth of the synew abtyke / and of the inward party is
called rethina / and of the outward part on the humor Crystalline it hight
Aranea. Demand. Of how many humors is the eye composed? Answer Of.iiij.
The first that is set in the mids of the eye is called humor crystalline /
by cause it is of color of Crystal in form of a hayle done / wherein
pryneypally is founded the syghte. After this humor so nyghe the brain is ye
giasy ^umour that susteyneth and compryseth all the hyn (...) party of ye
humor crystallyne. And both these ^^mours ben wrapped with pa^nycle oblyke.
The ^hyrde humor that is on the fore party is called the humor Albugineus.
And this humor is be^wene the said weithe or tunycle called Rethina ^ that
which bredeth of pia matter. The fourth hu^our puts Galyen in the book of ye
vt^lytes of ye ^^rtycles and last chapitre y^ is called the humors ^^^era
lu^ida in the region of the black of the eye and it is all spyrytuall.
Demand. Whereof is the eye composed beside the parties aforesaid? Answer.
Over and beside these foresaid things the eye is composed of mouynge synewes /
descendyng fro the second equalyte of synewes coming down fro the brain /
and the six muscles that move them / and fro the veins and arteres / and the
spongeous flesh that fulfill the places about the lachrymall / and the
palpebres neighbors cartylagynouses with hears determined closing the
superyour parties with a muscle / and opening with two transuersall muscles.
Demand. Of how many substau^ces is the nose, and how many and what
partycles has every substance? Answer. It is of three substaunces / that is
to wit of substance flesshely / bony / and cartilagynous, The flesshely
substance has the skin and two muscles about the hinder part. The bony
substance has two trianguler bones wherewith the bridge is raised up / and the
foundacyons do join on the one part by the mids of the length of the nose,
and on the other after the days. The subcartylagynous is dowble / one outward
that makes the typ of the nose / and the other inward deuydeth the
nosethyrlles. The nosethyrlles ben two gutters ascendyng unto the bone of the
collatory where as are applicate the addicions mamylares of the brain where as
smell is and descendyng unto the palace nygh lanulle / by the which channels is
drawn the fumous vaporacyon to the said places. And the air is brethed and
respyred to the longes / and the brain is purged of superfluytees. Demand.
Of what substance / form / and what place / and for what cause were the ears
made? Answer. First they are made of cartylagynous substance. Secondly they
are holowe of form. Thyrdly they are set on the petrous bones. And fourthly
they be ordained to the herynge.

Demand. Fro whens comes the herynge to the ears? Answer. It comes by
the streyt holes of the bones petrous by mean of a synewe that comes to the
ears that bredeth of the.v. equalyte of synewes of ye brain. Demand. Whereof
serves the glaudinous flesh that is under the ^ares? Answer. That they may
be clensers of the brain. Demand. Whereof ferueth certain veins that
parnygh by that place? Answer. After Lanfrankes in tencyon / because they carry
the ^ater sparmatyke to the ballockes. And therefore if ^hey be cut a man is
never apt to generacyon. Nevertheless Galyen holds the contrary / as
^^^ycen recyteth in the treatye of the lygnage. ^Demau^de. Whereof serve the
temples / the che^^^ / and the Jaws? Answer. They be parties of (...) sides
of the face. Demand. Whereof are ^he chekes / the temples / and the Jaws
compo^^^ Answer. Of the musculous flesh with veins / ^^teres / and bones.
Demand. How muscles ^re there in the said parties / and fro whens come ^hey?
Answer. First there is.vij. muscles that move the lyppes / and the chekes /
which after Auycen comes from the forcule of the lower parties. After Haly
there is also.xij. that move the nether Jaws / of the which some opens it
that come fro the place of the party of ye ears. And the other close it that
descend from above in passing under the bail of the bones of the temples /
and those are called tymporalles / and are right noble and very sensyble / and
therefore their hurt is very peryllous / by the reason whereof nature has
wrought wisely for to save the^ / and has ordained ye bought of the temples
bones / and the other muscles are made for to grynde and chawe / and those
proceed of the balle of the chekes. And to all these muscles comes sinews
fro the third pareyle of synewes of the brain. Demand. Comes there any
veins or arteres with ye said muscles? Answer. Yea, chyefly about the
temples, and the corners o^ the eyes / and the lyppes. Demand. How many
bones is there in the parties abouesayde? Answer. There is many. For first
there is.ix. bones of the chekes as Galyen says / though there appear but two
that are joined under the nose. And than is there two parell that are called
the bones of the temples / the which in making a party of the orbytall / or
emynent pomall that is round bright apples of the chekes compassyng ye chekes^
producynge an addycyon round about the addycyon of the bone petrous, and
makes the bought under the which be conserved and keep the muscles of the
temples. Than is there ye nether Iawe bones whereof Auycen says that ye nether
Iawe is composed of two bones / which be narowe under the chynne / and there
are knit by an only joint, and in the top of every of the other extremities /
in cuttynge is a bowed sarrature which is composed with an addycion very
subtylly made and bred there. The bones that come there are fastened with
strings. Demand. Of how many parties is the mouth composed? Answer. Of.v.
partycles. The lyppes / the tethe / the tongue / the roof / and ^ncl^.
Demand. Fro whens comes it that the ^^the have felyng seeing that bones feel
not? An^^^^e. Albeit that the tethe be of bony substance, ^^^^rthelesse after
Galyen in the.xvj. book of the (...) of par^^^^^ ^^ey feel by reason of
certain ^^^^wes desce^^ (...) ^ro the third pareyle of the ^^^ewes of y^
bra^^^ ^^at have there their rotes. Demand. How many tethe ought every
person to have? Answer. Some have mo / and some (...). In some is
sou^de.xxxij.xvj. in every Iawe. and in other is found but.xviij. That is to
wit / (...) donales / two quadruples.viij. molares / and (...) cassalles. And
their roots are fyxed within ^he Jaws / of the which some has but one / and

the sholders? Answer. There be diverse, First the fore part where as be two
byg ones that descends fro under the ears unto the furcule, And in the
hinder perte there is yet other greater yt binds it to the spondiles of the
back and the sides. There be other that descend to the sholdres in such
dysposycyon that the tenant muscles and the strings ben about the neck that
makes the head bow and ye neck, and to lift up and turn about, for
without them it is not possible to make artyculacyon or mouyng, Demand. What
dyseases may the neck suffer? Answer. Diverse, as well in it self as in

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the sholdres / and the great hands,
IT is first to be noted that a sholdre / homoplate / and the humere is all
one, Demand. Wherefore be ye hands made? Answer. To take and defend the
organes / and for that cause man is garnysshed with hands in stead of
weapons, Demand. Whereof ben composed the sholdres and ye hands? Answer.
They are made of skin (...) flesh / of veins / of arteres / of synewes, of
mus^^es / of cords / of strings / of pa^nicles / of gristles, and bones,
Demand. Whens comes the mus^^es and cords that move the arms / and how
are they sytuate? Answer. They descend fro the (...) / and pass by the breast
/ and compryse and be ^^^^peth all the joint of the bone called vlna / or of
(...) addycyon / and are planted therein, Demand. (...) whens comes the
synewes that move the ^^oldres and the arms? Answer. Fro the noddle (...)
pass thorough the neck, Demand. From ^^e^s comes their veins and
arteres? Answer. ^hey are sent fro the arm, Demand. How ^any bones are in
ye sholdre? Answer. Two, the ^one sholdre blade / and the bone furculare, The
bone spatulare yssueth fro the party of the back / and is like a pal / for it
is large and thynne fro the back part / with an appearance holden by ye
mids, And at the party of the ioynte it is somewhat long and round in manner
of a helue / with three addycyons in the end, The first in the mids that
receives the end of vlna in a socket, The second in the heyght is crooked,
and sharp in manner of a ravens byll, And the third is on the left side
outward more crooked like an anchor. The bone furculare comes from the party
of the breast / and is round and styfe in the holownes of the superyour party
of the breast bone / and has two branches / one goes to one sholdre / and
another to another sholdre / and byndeth and closes these two addycyons called
Rostralles because the said myddle socket hold ye end of vlna more styfly in
ye ioynte, Demand. Be the addicions abouesayd other bones than the bone of ye
sholdre? Answer. No, after Lanfranke and Henry / but are substancyall party of
it / as it appears by experyence. And also Galyen in the.xiij. book of the
vtilite of partycles the second and twelfe chapter / where he says that the
homoplate towcheth the extremities of the sholdres, and joins and covers
together in manner of a coueryng / which is guard of all their artyculacyon as
touching the sholdre / and ought to defend the upper end of the arm that it
go not out of his place. Demand. What collygau^ce has the bone furculare?
Answer. It has three great collygaunces that goes from the end of the
sholdre unto vlna / and round about is bound and strayned with great
tenauntes that bread of the great muscles that comes from the breast, and of
the sholdre plant in ye bone that styreth it / of the which some do stretche
upward and the other downward, and ye other two converse all about it.
Demand. In what party of the sholdre is it where as is assygned the memory
of the heart? Answer. It is assygned in the party that is under the joint that
is under the arm pytte that is filled with glaudynous flesh Demand. In how
many parties is the arm devised that is called ye great hand? Answer. After
Galyen in the second book of the vtylyte of partycles and second chapter it
is divided in three great parties. One is called vlna / the other little arm,
and the third the surall hand. Demand. In how many and what particles is
the great hand composed? Answer. Of such partycles as the other / that is of
skin, of flesh, of arteres, and veins. Demand. How many and what veins
is found apperyng in the arm? Answer. Diverse / the which after the
branches that they make / and the ^^tending by ye arm are diuersified, for
although that they in making of branches they come vn^^r the arm pyttes /
yet agaynwarde they ramy^^ in to two parties. One part goes on the out (...)
of the arm / and the other on ye insyde. That (...) the outsyde yet brauncheth
more / and makes ^ branch over the sholdre in to the head. And ^he other
descends and makes two branches / of the which one is divided on the
outsyde of the arm in diverse parts / and is called the cord of the arm /
b^t the other part desce^deth to ye part of the arm / and appears in the
fold of the elbow / and there is called Cephalyca / and fro that place
descends in to the hand / and appears between the thombe and the fore
finger / and there it is called cephalica occularis. And that party that was
divided under the arm pyttes that goes in to the inward party in descending
appears within the bought of the elbowe / and is called Basylyc. And fro that
place desce^deth in to the hand and appears between the myddle finger and his
neighbor / and high Saluatell. And of these two said veins that are in the
bought of ye elbow is made a branch that appears in the mids of those ij.
and is called Mediana. And diverse other veins are found in the arm / that
for their smalnes the Cyrurgyen has little a do with them. Demand. How many
notable synewes come in to ye arm / and whereby, and whereof bread they?
Answer. By the spondyles of ye neck desce^deth in to each arm four notable
synewes that bread of the noddle / one above, and another beneth, one behind,
and another before.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the great hand.
Demand, How many bones are in ye first part of the great hand that is
named vlna or adiutor / and how it is fygured? Answer, There is but one alone
full of maroughe / and is round of figure at both ends, for at the upper end
it is round as one only entering in to the socket or pyt of ye sholdre / and
at the nether end the rou^dnes is double in the mids in form of a poully.
And in the inward part is a little appearance / and in the outward part
backewarde is a concauyte wherein is received the end of the addicyon like a
beke of a raven, in to ye byggest socket, what time that the arm is raised /
in such manner that the said roundelles enter in to the holownesse of the
sockettes, And when the arm is stretched and bowed it comes and makes the
joint of the elbowe,

Demand. How many bones is in the little (...) / and how be they figured?
Answer. There ^e two and hight focylles / that is to wit the byg^^st that is
in the arm / and is greater and lon^er than the other for the addycyon that it
has / that resembles a beke / and it goes toward the (...) finger, In
making outward an enbossed ^^peraunce in manner of a wedge, The lesser goth
^^warde / and goes fro the bought of the elbowe (...) the hand toward the
thombe / like as it (...) ^oyne to it, And in both the ends of ye same
^^^^yttes receyuynge the roundnesses, Toward ^^^^owe ben received ye
roundnesses graduales (...) adiutory with the addycyon that is like a (...) of
the said elbowe, And toward the hand (...) roundnesses of the bones of the
hand / and they (...) both bygger toward the ends because of the ^oynture /
and sklender toward the mids / and longer ye synewes and the muscles,
Demand. How many conjunction of bone be in the hand / and how many bones
in every conjunction / and how they are figured and formed? Answer. There be
three conjunctions of bone in the hand. In the first conjunction be three / and
in the second conjunction four. And of this nombre Auycen gives his reason /
because yt the first conjunction touches the focyll bones / as holding all
to one bone / and therefore there may not so many hold. In the second
conjunction there be four, because there might be no mo for the space of three
in the first conjunction toward the focyll bones. And the bones of these two
conjunctions be short, and these two conjunctions of bones be called the
recepte of the hand. In the third conjunction be four bones longer than the
other. And that conjunction is called the breast of the hand or pecten. Howbeit
Auycen puts to these three coniu^ction of bones one bone mo / which is added
to the two first conjunctions of the recept / and was create for to defend
the synew of the breast of the hand. And this dyuysion of bones may be seen in
the figure that was fygured before. Demand. How many fyngers is there in the
hand, and how many bones in every finger? Answer. There be.v. fyngers / and
in every finger three bones. And thus in all the fyngers is but.xv. bones. By
the which things aforesaid it may be known that in all the great is
but.xxix. bones. That is.xv. in ye fyngers.xj. in the little hand.ij. in the
arm / and one in the adiutor. Demand. Which bones out of joint of the
abouesayd me^bres ben most easyest to set in again / and which be most
dyffycyle? Answer. The most difficyle is the joint of ye elbow / and the
easyest is the sholdre ioynte / and the mean is that of the hand.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the breast.

composed / and with what members have they collygaunce? Answer. They be
composed of white glaudenous ^^esshe, and with veins, arteres, and synewes.
Ther^^re have they collygaunce with the heart, the liver, and the brain, and
with the genytall me^bres.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the muscles of the breast.
Demand. How many muscles be there in the breast? Answer, After Auycen there
be. lxxxx. of which some are common at ye neck / other at the sholdres /
other at the mydryfe / other at the rybbes / other at the back / and proprely
other ar at the breast. Demand, In how many and what manners ben the bones of
the breast divided? Answer. In three manners / some be in the fore part / other
in the hyndre part, and the other at the sides. Demand. How many bones be
in the fore part of the breast? Answer. Seven, after as there be.vij. rybbes

and.v. false or lyengly, for they be not complete as the other be aforesaid.

Questyons upon the parties contained within the breast.
Demand. How is the heart situate within the breast? Answer. Because that
the heart is the beginning of life / and is within the body as king and lord
of all the other me^bres / of whom all the other members do take influence. And
for that cause it is set in the mids of the breast / not declynynge to one
part more than to another, as Galyen says in his.vj. book of the vtylyte of
partycles. And this is certainly understand, for from the nether part it is
enclyned a little toward the left side / to give place to the liver that is on
the right side above the heart. And as to the upper part it declyneth somewhat
toward ye right side for to give rowme to the arteres. Demand. Of what shape

many celles is there in the heart? Answer. Three, that is the right and the left
between the said bentrycles is a pyt wherein the nourysshynge blood coming fro
the liver is dygered and made spyrytuall / that is sent by the arteres to all
the body / and chyefly to all the pryncypall members / as to the brain / where
by dygestyon is take another nature, and is made anymall. And in the liver where
in it is made natural. And to the ballocke where it is made genytall / and to
all the other members cause life. And by the right ventrycle / the branch of
the vein mountynge that bears the blood fro the liver upward and yssueth of
it self, of the which vein the one part called vein arteryall goth to
nourysshe the lunges. And ye rest in mountynge makes sundry branches unto the
hinder parties / as is abouesayd. And fro the left ventrycle of the heart
yssueth ye vein called pulsatyle / fro the which one part goth to the lunges
that there is called Arterea venalis that bears ye capenous vapors fro the
lunges and introduces the air for to cool the heart. And the other part
makes branches upward and downwarde / as is abouesayd of the other veins.
And over the three oryfyces of the said three ventrycles there be three pellycles
that open and close the entering of the blood and of ye spyryte in conuenable
time. Demand. How many ears has the heart, and how are they set / and
wherefore serve they? Answer. The heart has two ears, on each side one set
upon the said laterall ventrycles yt serve for to let the air in and out that

Demand. Of what substance is ye lunges^ Answer. Of a soft substance,
clear, spongeous, and white. Demand. How many manner of vessels be
conjoined by the substance of the lunges? Answer. Three, that is the branch
of the vain arteryall that bredeth (as it is said) of the right ventrycle of
the heart. And the branch of the vain pulsatyle that comes fro the left
side. And the branches of Trachea arteria that bears the air to the heart.
Demand. How ben these three manners of vessels set within the lunges?
Answer. They be divided over all ye substance by small ones and less, unto a
very small quantite. Demand. How many lobbes has the lunges? Answer.v.
Three in the right party / and two in the left. Demand. How many pa^^tycles
be there in ye breast? Answer. Three. The first covers inward all the
ribs, and that is called pleura. The second hight Mediastu^um / and that
deuydeth all the breast in the right party and left. And the third is called
the mydryfe that ^^nydeth all the spyritual me^bres from the nutry ^yfes / and
is composed of pleura, and of the cyphac, and of the pa^nycle that hight
Cordorus / that is of synewes sent to it from the spondyles, and the flesshely
parties chyefly next the rybbes, that proprely is a muscle, the operacyon
whereof serves to put out superfluytees, as Galyen says.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the belly / and parties thereof.
IT is to be noted upon these things that follow, that the belly may be taken
for two things. First for the stomach. Secondly for the regyon of all
nutrytyfe members / and so it is taken here. Demand. What is the holle
posycyon of the belly? Answer. It is under the region of the spyrytuall members
/ so that the superyour part that is at ye entryng called p^cordyal / and
toward ye forcule, and the party that is called stomacle, a three fyngers nygh
the nauyl downwarde / and the party vmbelycall synual is fro ye nauyll
downwarde / and the ypocondres be in the side under ye rybbes. And the parties
called yliac are over the hau^ches. Demand, To se the Anathomy very well in
the parties of the belly, as well the conteynynges as the continued / how ought
the Cyrurgyen to open it? Answer. He ought to open it alonge and overthwart /
this way and that / that he may the lyghtlyer se the parties before (that be the
Myrac and Cyphac) as behind / where as are the.v. spondyles of the kydnees,
and the flesh over them.

Demand. Of how many and what and how many parts is the myrac composed.
Answer. It is composed of.iiij. parts. Of the skin, of the grease, of the
flesshy pa^nycle, and of the muscles, of whom yssueth the cords. Demand.
What is Cyphac? Answer. It is a pa^nycle only that is added to the Myrac.
Demand. How many and what be the parties contained in the belly? Answer.vij.
First the ars gut, secondly the guts, thyrdly the stomach, than ye liver,
than the mylt, and the kydnees. Demand. Wherefore are the muscles of the belly
fourmed? Answer. For two reasons. The first is to strength it. The second to
expel the superfluytees of the members. Demand. How many muscles be in the
belly? Answer. After Galyen in the.iiij. book of the vtylyte of partycles / and
in the.vij. of his Terapentycke ^here be, viij, That are two all alonge coming
fro the boucler of the stomach unto the share bone / and two overthwart the
back, and entrelace by the mids of the belie, And, iiij, from the angles
transuersalles / of the which two bread in the rybbes of the right side, and go
to the left side, and of the hakle bones, and of the share / and the other two
of the left side, and go to the right side of the said ^ones / in crossynge by
the myddle of the belly.

Demand. What is ^he perytoneon / and wher^f is it dyryuate? of what
substance is it / and wher^^re serves it? Answer. It is sytuate under the
^ayde muscles, and it so named of Pery / that is to ^^y round about, and of
Tonnes / that is to say ^ntestynon / for it goes round about the nutry^yfe
parties / and is a little pa^nycle, synewy, subtle, and hard / and serves to
keep that the muscles compryse not the natural members / and it may be
enlarged, and comprymate in manner of other members / and that it be not lightly
broken / and that the things contained in it issue not / as it happens to
them yt are grieved therewith / and it is proprely called Cyphac. Demand. What
wou^des of the belly are most peryllous and most dyfficyle to heal, either
they of the mids of the belly / or they in the sides? Answer. They in the
mids of the belly / because the parties there ben more treatable / and the
bowelles there come sooner out, than by other places, Demand. What is
Epypleon / and whereof is it composed? Answer. It is a pannycle that covers
and wrappeth the stomach about / and is named of epi / that is to say over
all or about, or pleon, that is to appear, for it pereth over all the stomach
/ and is composed of two tunycles, the one thycke, and the other thynne, laid
one on another, and of diverse arteres, veins, and synewes, and great quantyte
of fat / and is called ars gut. Demand. Whereof bredeth the pypleon / and
wherefore serves it? Answer, It bredeth of the parties that be under ye back
/ and of the Cyphac, and it is ordained for to rechaufe the parties next
thereto, as Galyen says in the fourth book of the vtylyte of partycles and,
xiij, chapter. Demand. May the pypleon hold long when it is hurt without
great alteracyon / and how ought it to be dressed? Answer, No, but it is
lightly altered and changed for the fatness, and ought to be bound and not
cut for fear of flux of blood, Demand. Of how many skynnes or tunycles are
the bowels composed / and wherefore serve they? Answer They be composed of two
tunycles / and serve first to make dygestyon / and to bring the Chilus to the
liver by means of the veins mescraykes / and to put out the fylthy
superfluytees. Demand. How many guts be there. Answer. Six / although
that they be joined together / yet have they diverse offices / and diverse shapes
/ whereby they are divided. Of the which six guts three be sklendre and three
byg. The first of the three sklendre is named Portanarium / or Duodenum. The
second is called Ieiunium. And the third is called Subtle. Of the three byg /
the first hight Esac / the second Colon / and the third is the ars gut
called Longaon, or ye straight gut. Demand. Be the said guts garnysshed
with muscles? Answer. Yes / for the gouernynge of the superfluytees that they
receive and put out. Demand, What is the manner to make incysion for to know,
dyscerne, and se well every gutte by the Anathomy? Answer. First it behooves
to begin ^t the ars gut / that is called longaum or rectum / and because that
ye fylthy matter shall not let the / ^ynde it at the upper end, and let it be
two ends, and be cut in the mids of the lygature / and let the nether part
be left / and proceed in dyscaruynge almost unto yleon / where as the gut
begins that hight Collon, which is byg with little celles / wherein the fecall
matter takes form / and is two fadom long, or there about / and declyneth
much toward the left kydney / and in mountyng toward the mylt / and
reuolueth of ye party coming toward the right side of the stomach, under the
pa^nycle of the liver, where receives a porcyon of the humor coloryke / which
moves it to put out the superfluytees, and in the rancluyng it descends to
the right kydney at the hyndre end of the hau^che there as begins the gutte
called one eye, or the bag / for it seems yt it has but one eye / although it
have two after ye very truth. One whereat the fylthy matter / and another that
it goes out / but because that they be very nere it seems yt it has but one
/ and this gut is very short / for it is but of a handful long. And because
of the nyghnesse of the haunches / and because it is not well bound it
descends sooner in to ye ballocke coddes, when a man is grieved or broken than
any other gutte / and of this gut is bred y^ sklendre gut that hight Ylion /
the which Ylion is well.vij. or.viij fadoms long / and it has many
reuolucyons in all ye back. After this is the gut that hight Ieiuniu^, because
it is always emptye for the great multitude of messerayke veins that be
about it contynually suckynge it / and for the color that is seen between it
and Portanarium that incyteth it contynually to expel that that is in it. And
to this gut is contained the gut called Duodeum / which is so called because
it is.xij. fyngers of length / after the which follows ye gut called
Portanariu^, so called by his office, for it is the nether gate of the
stomach, as Merry is the upper gate. Demand. Wherefore is it yt the wounds
made in the small guts never heal, and yet those of the great guts heal
sometime? Answer, Because that the small guts be full of pa^nycles / and the
great guts are full of flesh. Demand. How may the Mezentereon be known
by Anathomy? Answer. To se the Mezentereon very well thou ought to bind the
guts toward the gut Portanariu^ and cut in manner as the longaon is / and
than put all the guts out. Demand, Whereof is Mezentereon composed, and how
is it set? Answer. First it is composed of veins messeraykes i^numerable
braunched fro the vein of the liver called Portanaria / and is covered and
garnysht before with pa^nycles and strings yt conioyne the bowelles with the
back / and with glandynous grease / and is commonly called seame / which when
it is out ye may clearly se the Anathomy of the stomach. Demand. What is the
stomach. Answer. It is the organ of the first digestion engenders the
chyl^^s. Demand. What is the place of the stomach within the body? Answer.
After Galyen in the.iiij. book of the vtylyte of partycles and first chapter.
The place of the stomach is in the mids of the body / because it is the
common almoner alms dealer and preparer to all the members of the body /
natwithstandynge that the superyour party thereof somewhat enclyneth unto the
left side toward the.xij. spondyles where as the dyafragma ends / and the
lower part declyneth to the right. Demand. What me^bres have be made for to
serve the stomach? Answer. The first is the mouth / for in likewise as the
veins Mezeryalles be preparatyues of the second dygestyon that is done in the
liver / likewise is the mouth of the stomach. For as Auycen says / ye
chawyng acquyreth some digestion. Afterward serves the Merry and ysophagus of
the upward parties in bringing the meat in to the stomach. And of the
nether parties serves ye guts, and the veins Mezeraycalles to put forth the
noyfull things / and dystrybute the profitable things dygested and chylozed
in it. Demand. Whereof serves the stomach? Answer. Proprely it serves to
dygest by his heat of his own carnosyte in the botome thereof, as Auycen
says, and by the heates gotten of the next parties / for it has the liver on
the right side that warmeth / and the mylt on the left side that trauerseth it
with his grease and ways / whereby it sends the humor melencolyke to the
stomach for to provoke it appetyte. And above i^ is the heart with the arteres
that causes life / and the brain that sends it a branch of synewes from
the upward parties gyuynge to it feeling. Also from the party of the back /
and the veins called kyllis, and adorthy, and diverse other strings
descendynge fro it / whereby it is bound with the spondyles of the reins.
Demand. With how many skynnes is the stomach covered? Answer. With two,
one is flesshy that is outward, and the other is synewy that is inward.
Demand. Of what villes is the stomach composed. Answer, Of longytudynalles
to draw in and transuersalles to reteyne / and latitudinalles to put forth.
Demand. Of what shape is the stomach? Answer. It is round endlong in manner
of concord such wise curbed that his entrynges be higher than his body /
because ye issue of the things that it conteyneth be made inducly. Demand.
Of what quantyte is the stomach? Answer. It is manifest / for commonly it
holds.ij. or.iij. pyntes. Demand. What is the liver? Answer. It is the
organe of the second dygestion / engendrynge blood. Demand. How or where is
the liver set in the body of mankind? and of what figure is it? Answer.
First it is set under the bought of the rybbes / and is of figure as of the
moon / curbed toward the rybbes / and is holowe toward the stomach with.v.
lappes or pa^nulles in manner of hands comprysynge the stomach. Demand.
whens comes the feeling to the liver? Answer. It comes by a pa^nycle that
covers it / to which comes a synewe for his feeling. Demand. With what
members has the liver collygau^ce? Answer, First with the dyafragma by his
pa^nycle yt covers it which byndeth it to ye diafragma with strong strings.
And also it has colligau^ce with the back, with the stomach, with ye guts, with
the heart, and all the other me^bres. Demand. Of what substance is ye liver.
Answer. It is the substance of flesh / and red as quayl^ed blood,
entrelaced all about with veins and arteres. Demand. Whereof serves a great
vein that comes out of the holownes of the liver called Portanaria? Answer.
It is because that all the succosyte that chyllus draws by his branches it
transmytteth and dystrybuteth by all the liver / for that vein is divided
Mezeraycalles i^numerable that are planted in the stomach and in the bowelles
for to draw and bear away the said succosite fro the liver. Demand. Of what
party of the liver yssueth a great vein and holow called killis / and whereof
serves it? Answer, It yssueth out of the bosse of the liver / and serves to
dystrybute all the blood that is engendered within the liver over all the body /
for that vein yssueth out of the liver, and makes branches upward and
downwarde through all the body / whereby it deals the said blood to every
membre to feed it. Demand. What are the medycynes yt ought to be applied on
ye liver? Answer. That for the substance seldom dyssoluable lightly it ought
to have medycyne somewhat styptyke. Demand. What is ye galle? Answer. It is a
bag or bladder pa^nyculous set in the holownes of the liver about the mean
pa^nulle for to receive the coleryke superfluyte. Demand. How is testis
fellis composed? Answer. It has two entrynges or necks between which is a
dystau^ce, whereof one is on the right side that adresseth toward the mids of
the liver to receive the colere. The other is at the botome of the stomach /
and in the bowelles to send them colere for the vtylytees aforesaid.
Demand. Of what quantyte is the galle? Answer. It conteyneth peradventure a
glass full / or the mountenaunce of a fyoyle. Demand. What dyseases suffers
it commonly? and how be they known? Answer. It suffers opylacyons as well in
the neck propre, as in the neck common. And the disease known when the
stoppynge is in the neck common / because that the colere may not issue out
of ye liver / nor the blood may not cleanse but abides with the blood and
makes the vryne yelow, and all the body. And it is known when it is in the
neck propre because that the helpynges do fail, that it was wont to have /
and even accydent follows as Ga^^en says in the.vij. book of the disease and
the accydent, and in the.v. of the interiours. Demand. What is the mylte?
Answer. It is the receyuer of melancolyke superfluite engendered in ye liver.
Demand. What is the situacion of the mylt in the body of mankind? Answer.
It is of the left side embracyng trauersly the stomach. Demand. Of what
substance is the mylt? Answer. It is of soft substance and spongyous,
blacker then the liver. Demand. Of what shape is ye mylt? Answer. Of a long
figure in manner of four corners. Demand. With what members has the mylt
collygaunce? Answer. It is bound by his pa^nycle with the rybbes / and of his
bosse and concauyte it has collygacyon with the stomach, and with the ars
gut. Demand. Wherein serves the mylt in the body of mankind? Answer. It
serves by these two ways / for by one way it draws the superfluyte
melancolyke of the liver. And by the other way it sends it to the oryfyce of
the stomach, for the causes abouesayde. Demand. What manner disease does ye
mylt suffer? Answer, It does suffer opylacyons because that his ma^er is
gross / whereby the said opylacyons follow other inconuenyentes / for when it
fails to cleanse the liver of the said superfluytees the body is faint and ill
colored. And when it fails to transuyt the stomach / not sendynge yt it
ought to do / the appetyte wastes or is taken away.

Demand. What solucyons of contynuyte be most peryllous in them of ye liver,
or them of the mylt / and which of both suffers strongest medycynes? Answer.
The solucyons of contynuyte be more dangerous in the liver than in the mylt?
and the mylt suffers stronger medicines then the liver / and purges chyefly by
the belly. Demand, What things are the kydnees / and how many are in the
body of man / and of what substance are they? Answer. They are partycles
ordained to cleanse the blood of heinous superfluytees / and there be two of
them on every side one, and are of the substau^nce of hard flesh. Demand.
Of what shape are they? Answer. They are long of shape as an egg comprymate /
and have in them concauytees / wheri^ ^hey receive that which is drawn by
them / and each of them have.ij. holes whereby they draw the aquosyte of the
vein called kyllis / and by the other send the said aquosite called pysse to
the bladder. Demand. What members comes to the kydnees / and with what
members have they collygau^ce? Answer. There comes to them veins, arteres,
and synewes, whereof their pa^nycle is made / and their fat is like talowe / and
have collygaunce with the back. Demand, Whereon are the kydnees sytuate?
Answer. They are situate upon the tumbes, whereon they be as on a coytte.
Demand. What veins pass between the kydnees over the spondyles. Answer.
There pass the vein adorty / descendynge to the nether members / from the
which very ^ere it yssueth the members sparmatykes. Demand. What dyseases
may the kydnees suffer? Answer. They do suffer many dyseases / and specially
they suffer opylacyons and stones that are hard to heal.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the haunches bones.
Demand. How many bones ar in ye huckles? Answer. After the veryte there is
but one / howbeit after diverse parties of it there are three. The first is
called the hallowed sacred / or yt there be three or four spondyles on the party
of ye back / and on that side it is very byg / and toward the lower end / yt
is to say the foundement it comes in lessenynge / and there is i^
^artilaginous / and this bone has a hole before whereby passes ye synewes and
not by the side as do other spondyles of the back. The two other be two great
bones / one on each side that be coniuncte with this great spondyle of the holowe
bone behind and before in making the pectynall bone, and these two bones are
large on the yliake parties / and on the party of the share they be narowe in
manner of brau^che / and joins to ye share before / and therefore are they
called the share bones. And in the mids of these bones of the back party
there be two concauytees called exides or boxes / wherein are received the ends
o^ the bones of the thyghes, called vertebres, and there are called the thygh
bones. And all the said bones thereby nyghe the parties of ye foundement echone
has a great hole whereby desce^deth synewes, m^scles, veins, and arteres, that
be brought from above downwarde. Demand. What is the bladder / of what
substance / and of what shape / of what quantyte / and how it is sytuate?
Answer. It is a receyuer of aygnous superfluytees of the kydnees / and it is
pa^nyculous and strong / for it is composed of pa^nycles / and is round of
shape / the bygnes for to hold a pynte, and is sytuate under the share.
Demand. Whereby receives the bladder the superfluite vrynal of the kydnees,
and whereby is it put out? Answer. First it receives the superfluyte vrynall
by two long ways that descend fro the kydnees that enter by the sides of the
bladder dyagno^nelly by two angles / yt which ways are called the pores
vritides, and by a carnous neck / with muscles closing and opening in bowyng
and ouerpassynge to the yerde in men. And in women without reflyxyon unto two
fyngers within the neck of the matryce / whereby she puts forth that vrynall
aquosite. Demand. To what diseases is ye bladder disposed? Answer. It is
dysposed to opylacyons / as well by stones as by graueylous vryne / yt it
receives of ye kydnees. Demand. How are medycynes applied to the bladder?
Answer. By cyrurgery. Demand. Where ought incysyon to be made for the stone
in the bladder? Answer. At the neck without the ^eame perignous. Demand.
What are ye sparmatyke vessels? Answer. They are certain veins that bread
nere the kydnees / and nygh the vein kyllis and adorthi berynge the blood to
the genytal me^bres, as well in man as woman wherein by the last generation it is
made sparme or sede of mankind nature. Demand. How many manners of
sparmatyke vessels be there? Answer. Two / for some brings the matter
sparmatyke ^n / and some puts it out. They that bring it ^e branches of
veins and arteres that bread of ^he vein kyllis and adorthi. And they that
put it out be they yt mount nere to the neck of the bladder / and puts the
sparme out of the hole of the yerde, and with them is the synew suspensory and
sensyfe that descends to the genytalles. Demand. How be the vessels
sparmatyke situate? Answer. They are set thus for toward ye grynde about the
Myrac and Cyphac is a hole whereby descends from above the three bodies
aforesaid, that is the vein and artere that brings / and the synewe
sensytyfe that is hard to the neck of the bladder at the rote of the yerde,
and the hole of the yerde / whereby mounteth the matter sparmatyke for to go out.
And thus may be seen that if ye hole toward grynde be out of measure large /
the bodies superyours as the zyrbus, or guts may descend in the loceon, and
swell the purs of the ballockes as if one were broken, and often makes
brustenesse where as may descend moist matter that will make a hermen.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the pyntyll.
Demand. What is the yerde / and whereof is it composed? Answer. It is the
yerde vyryll / that is the cultyner and labourer of the field of mankind / and
is the way of the vryne / and is composed of skin, of muscles, of strings,
of veins, and arteres, of synewes, and of right great bands. Demand, Where
is the dysposicion of the yerde. Answer. It is planted upon ye back of the
share. Demand. Fro whens are sent the skyn^e, the strings, the veins,
arteres, flesh, and the synewes? Answer. First the stringes are sent fro
the bone satron / and the parties next it. The veins, the arteres, the
flesh, the synewes, and the skin are sent to it from the superyour parties.
Demand. How many pryncypal ways has the yerde? and what dyuersyte of names
takes it in sundry parties thereof? Answer, It has two ways / that is of the
sperme, and of the vryne / and the end of the yerde hight balanum. The bowell
hight mitra / and the head hight prepuce. Demand. Of what quantite ought ye
yerde of man to be? Answer. Commonly of.viij. or.ix. inches / howebeit to be
plyfyke with any woman it ought to be proporcyoned at the neck of her matryce.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the losseum.
Demand. Whereof bredeth the losseum / and whereof takes it name. Answer. It
bredeth (...) Syphac and Myrac / their parties passing and hangyng outward of
it upon ye back of ye share at the begyn^ynge of it. It is called the Dymdyme
and there it doubleth / and fro the lower party it is called Loceum / and is
the coddes of the geny^alles. Demand. What are the ballockes? Answer. They
are the pryncypall organs of the generacyon of mankind / for in them the matter
spermatyke is made parfyte and sure. Demand. Fro whens comes the sperme to
the ballockes? Answer. From all the body / and specially fro the pryncypall
members for the bredynge of their vesse^les, as of the heart, the liver, and
the kydneys. And for the cause of delectacyon the brain has co^mutacyon
therein, for the synewes that descend fro the brain to the ballockes. Thus of
all the body it takes nature / not by quantyte but by vygour. Demand. What
is the matryce / and in what place is it set? Answer. The matryce is the field
of generacyon of mankind, and organ susceptyfe of gendrynge matter / and is set
between the bladder and the longaon. Demand. Of what substance is the
matryce? Answer. Of a pa^nyculous substance. Demand. Of how many skynnes
or tunicles is the matryce composed? Answer. It is composed of two skynnes /
of which the inward is full of sharp veins / with ye ends of which veins
be contained with the pannycles Lembryon / and are divided in two parties
pryncypalles after ye nombre of the dugges / and though there appear but these
two chaumbres in the matryce / yet after Mundyne there are.vij. small chau^bres
in the matryce, three in each of the two chau^bres / and one in the mids / and
the outward tunycle neruous. Not as Auycen says that it is create of synewes
coming fro the brain / but as in substance is conse^blable neruous, for it
is white, and pryuate of menstruall blood, and is stretchynge as the synewes /
for it streyneth and loses as needs requires. It comes but very little of
synewes whereby it feleth / and this outward tunycle is all plain, and is not
divided. Demand. Of what shape is the matryce? Answer. It is the shape of
the instrument of generacyon of men / for it is proporcionly made to the yerde
and coddes of man's genytours, except that it is reuersed, and is holowe
within for to receive man's yerde in the time of copylacyon / for the neck of
the matryce is like a man's yerde / and the matryce with in is like coddes or
purce of ye genytalles of men. And as men have two ballockes or stones yt pass
and appear outward / so have women inward / except that they be bygger in the
man than in the woman. And in men they are longwyse and round / and in women
they be round and flat, and are set on both the sides of ye matryce each on a
side. And even so as the vessels spermatykes ben in ye mids of the
ballockes outward / so be they inward in women. Demand. With what members
has the matryce collygaunce? Answer. Their collygau^ce pryncypally is with
breasts by the veins of milk, and menstrualles, for the which things
nouryces have not well their menstruous flowers. Demand. Of what quantite is
the matryce / and the neck of it? Answer. The matryce comes almost fro the
nauyll unto ye utter part of the cont, in comprysynge the neck and all the
body of the matryce. Howbeit the neck of the matryce ought for to be naturally
of.x. or.xj. fyngers bread / and after as the woman has to meddle with man
flesshely little or much / it waxes long or shorteneth. And also it waxes
long or short after as the man that medleth with her has his yerde short or
long.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the ars gut / which was left before the better
to se the Anathomy of the other nutratyfe members.
Demand, What is the Longaon / of what length is it / and where is it set?
Answer. It is the ars gut that is a palm or handefull long almost to the
kydneys / and is set right over the foundement on the back and tail.
Demand. How many muscles be in the ars gut / and where to serve they it?
Answer. There be two that open and close it when it needs. Demand. How
many veins comes to the gut nygh to the foundement? Answer. Five branches
of veins named Emorroides or Emorroidalles. Demand. With what members has
the ars gut collygaunce? Answer. With the bladder, and therefore when one of
them suffers so does ye other. Demand. What is the pigneum? Answer. Pigneum
in Arabyke is to say the ars hole. And it is the place between the ars and the
yerde / which is a seame that follows the coddes / and the stock of the
yerde. Demand. What are the gryndes? Answer. They are the clensynge places
of the liver / and are of Glaudynous flesh ordained to the bought of the
thyghes. Demand. What are the buttockes? Answer. They are gross musculous
flesh ordained over ye bones of the thyghes, and hukcles wherfro descends
muscles, cords, and strings, mouyng the thyghes, and the great leg with the
hukcles.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the great foot.
Demand. Where begins the great foot / and how f^rre it lasts / and in
how many parts the great foot is divided? Answer. The great foot lasts fro
the joint of the hukcle called (...), unto the ferdest part of the toes / and
is divided as the great hand in three parties. The first is called the thyghe
/ the other the leg / and the last the little foot. Demand. Whereof is the
great foot composed? Answer. At ye great hand, with ^^ynne, flesh, veins,
arteres, muscles, stryn^es, grys^les, and bones.

Questyons upon the veins of the great foot.
Demand. Fro whens comes the veins to the great foot / and how do they
dyuyde them (...) the great foot? Answer. After that the veins (...) making
branches, at their beginning ben ^^scended to the last spondyle and there are
dyuyded (...) two parties / one on the right / another on the ^^ft / each of
them likewise ar divided in two brau^^h^s / fro thens one goes to the outward
part / and the other to the inward in making branches descendynge by the
legs to the ankles and fete. Demand. How many and what veins ben let
blood commonly in the great foot? Answer. There be.iiij. the sopheynes that
are upon the ancle inward toward the hele / and the scyatyke under the ancle
outward / and the popletyke that is under the kne / and the arenal that is
between the little too and his next fellow. Demand. Whereof bredeth the
synewes that comes to the great leg / and where pass they? Answer. They
bread of the last spondyles of the kydneys / of the holy bone, and the most
part of them pas by the hole of the thyghe bone / and make muscles in the
bought of the ^ne / so that they descendynge from the hukcles and cleue to the
bone of the thyghe with the cords mouynge the ioynte makes the great brawne
that are on the thygh that styreth the kne and the leg, and the calfe over the
leg mouyng the foot and ancle / and the muscles of the fete mouynge the toes /
after the form and manner as is before said of the hand. Demand, How goes
the long and byg strings / where end they, and where appear they most?
Answer. They descend by all the leg / and appear greatly in the greyndes and
under the knees, and under the hele, and on the joints of the toes, and the
sole of the foot is all full / and there they end.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of the great foot.
Demand. How many bones are in ye thygh and of what shape be they? Answer.
There is but one bone / and that is full of maroughe, and is round in one party
/ and the roundnesse thereof upward hight Uertebrum yt declyneth inward, and
is received in the pyt of the hukcle bone / and is somewhat bossed outward /
but in ye inward party toward the kne are two roundnesses which ben received
and wrapped in two concauytees that are in the focylle of the leg. And over it
one round bone above that is called the knop of the kne.

Demand. How many bones are in the kne / and how be they named? Answer.
There be two that be called ye morteys bones / whereof ye greatest is on the
insyde part / whereof is made the sharpenynge and conioynynge of the leg / and
goes fro the kne unto the foot making the ancle inward. The lesser pyt bone
is in the utter part / descendyng under the kne a little / and is smoth unto
the foot ioynynge there with the other pyt bone ma^ynge the outward ancle.
Demand. Of what shape are yt two focyl bones? Answer, The grea^est has two
pyttes toward the kne which re^eyue the round ends of the thyghe bone / for
the ^^sser comes not unto the joint / but is smothe as (...) is said / and
lies nygh under the kne / and ther^ore it is called arcus. And toward the
foot in the ^^ynynge with the bygger bone both they make (...) holowe pyt or
morteys wherein the first bone of the foot is received. Demand. How many
conjunctions or assemblyng of bones are in the little foot / and how many
bones are in every conjunction? Answer. There be three. In the first
conjunction be three bones assembled in one rou^dnesse. The first hight Caab in
Arabyc, in Greek Astra gallus, and is in manner as yt nut of a crosbow round on
each side. In the upper rou^dnes thereof is affyrmed the holownesse of the pyt
or morteys bones, and there the foot is moved, and the nether roundnes is
affyrmed to the concauyte of the manyculare bone / and after that forwith
toward the bone called Nanyculer / that is a synew concaued on each side. In
the first concaue is received the roundnes of Cohas aforesaid. In the second
concaue is received ye second coniu^ction of the bones of the fete / and under
them is the bone of the hele, of the which all the foot is stedyed / and
yssueth toward the hyndre part for ye strings that are fyxed in it.
Demand. How many bones is there in the second conjunction / and how are
they fygured? Answer. There be four that be short enough / one of them is
called grandmos^n / that is on the utter part toward the little too. And
these bones be round toward the nanyculare / and holowe toward the third
conjunction. Demand. How many bones are in the third conjunction of the
little foot? Answer. Five long enough that coresponde and receive the toes.
Demand. How many toes is there in each foot, and how many bones is in every
too? Answer. There be five toes / in every too three bones / except the great
too that has but twain. Thus in nombre there be.xxvi. bones in the foot. And
in all ye great foot or great leg there be.xxx. Demand. Which of the said
joints is most easy to set again, and which is most dyffycyll? Answer.
That of the little foot is most dyffycyll / and that of the kne is more / and
the scyatyke is mean.

Here ends the second treaty of this present questyonary.
Here begins the third treaty of this present questyonary / where as are
moved and soylled diverse questyons and dyfycultees in the manner of byndynge /
wyndynge / or rollynge / to sewe / to make boylsters / lynte / and tents.
Questyons upon the manner of rollynge or byndynge. Demand.
How many manners of lygatu^res or rollynges ben there / and how ought they to
be made / and whereto each of them brings together? Answer, There ben three
manners. One is incarnatyue / and it competeth to new wounds, and fractures,
and is done thus. The wound is bound at both ends unto the mids / in
beginning fro the party opposite to the hurt place / in ledynge one end
toward the upper part of the membre / and the other toward the nether in
taking the parties or about them till it be seen what is best to be done, in
streynyng more upon ye hurt place than on ye parties about it. Nevertheless
howebeit head must be taken to strain to hard or to loose / but the time to
bind is when the pacyent may well suffer it. And ye fore end of the said
roll ought to be sewed. And if need be there ought to take diverse rolls
wound by one self manner of wyndyng. The lyppes of the wound are joined one
to the other / and so the appost^macion is deffended / and some put to double
clothes / and strain them and sewe them on the place. Other manner of byndynge
is called expulsinc / and it proprely agrees to deep wounds, for to expel
and put out the matter from the botome / and to deffe^de that other matters come
not in the place, and this is done with a roll folded at the heed beginning
at the nether part of the membre in streynyng most there. And fro thens in
vnwrappynge toward the upper part. The third lygature is called the lygature
holdyng the medicines and it competeth as unto the members where as straynynge
can not be made nor other ligature, as at the neck, the belly, and in all
apos^umes, and dolorous dystrybucyons. And this is done with rolls of one
chyef or diverse chyefs, or arms, beginning upon the hurt place in byndynge to
the contrary of the said place. Demand. What ought ye manner of byndyng to
be? Answer. They ought to be softly and without pain. And if the bonds or
rolls cleue fast / let them be moysted only with wine till they be losed.
Demand. Whereof ought the rolls to be made? Answer. After Galyen they ought
for to be made of boleyn cloth, old, soft, smoth, and clean. Demand. Of what
quantite of length and bread ought the bonds to be? Answer. They ought to be
long and large / commonly they that bind ye sholdres ought to be of six
fyngers bread / those for the thyghes fy^e / those for the leg four / they for
ye arm three / and those for the fyngers one / and the length to b^ after the
necessyte of wyndynge. And this says Galyen in ye fourth book of his
Terapentyke, that the partycule vlcerate may not well be bound with ^ut to have
learned the indycacyon of the formyng of the membre.

Questyons upon the Anathomy of seamynge or stytchynge.
Demand, How many and what manners are there of seames? Answer. Three / that
is ^ ^eame incarnatyfe / and it agrees to all woun^es whose lyppes be far a
sonder, if they may be ^pproched and made egall / and which lygature ^^ely
suffyseth not / and have no strange things ^etwene the lyppes / and that be
new or renewed by ^caryfycacyon / in taking the skin away. The other seame
sowyng hight restrayntyfe of blood / and is done with the nedle in entering and
foldynge as skynnes be sewed. And this is done when for the great effusyon of
blood the other seames can not be made. The third is called the seame
conseruatyfe / and it is done as the other be / but it is not so narowe / for
it is not made but for to maintain the lyppes till the wound be closed.
Demand. In how many manners is ye incarnatyfe seame made? Answer. In.v.
manners. The first is making the first stytche in the myddle of the wound /
and the other in mean space of each syde^ and going also between let two
stytches be left the space of a finger bread overthwart / and also ye ought to
have a quyll with a hole in the side wherewith the other side of the lyppe shall be
steyed / because it shall not swerue / and because that when the nedle is
passed through it may be sen at ye hole in the quyl. And when the nedle is
passed to draw it and the threde in steyenge the lyppe that it follow not the
threde. And first knyt it with two reuolucions. Secondly with one, and than
cut the threde fer fro the kno^. Secondly the seame incarnatyfe is made with
nedles or with steal of feathers led in with the nedle in to wounds that be
great and deep that have lyppes wide separate in puttyng threded nedles in to
them as need is / in wrappynge them with threde as ye would fasten a nedle
with threde on your bosom or pouche lid, and to abide there unto the
consolidacyon of ye wound. Thyrdly a seame incarnatyfe is made with egal the
mylles made of towe well wrythen and sklenderly, as strawes the length of a
finger / or of the steal of a fether / which appertain to the places when we
will that the seame remain long time. And it is done when threded nedles are
put in to it by both the lyppes. Than is the nedle returned by the same hole
till that there remain a pyt / where i^ is put one of the ends of the wedge /
and than the tails of the thredes are streyned and bound on the other end of
the wedge / and there cut of the ends of ye thredes / and let the wedge lie
unto the parfyte consolidacion. Fourthly a seame incarnatyfe is made with hokes
/ and they ought to be small mete for the membre, curbed on each side, in
fastnynge it in to one lyppe / and than brought to the other. And in the same
let the hokes be fastened like as the shere men do in hokyng their clothes.
fyfthly an incarnatyfe seame is made with cloth, and is made in places wherein
we would that no ^^catryce should appear, as in ye face / and it is made o^ two
peaces three tryangled / and of the bygnesse of the quantite of the membre. And
anoynte them with oyntementes myscatyues and conglutyna^^ues, made of ye powdre
of dragons blood, of en^^nse, mastyke, sarcacole, and steynge meal of the
^^yll, encorporate with white of an egg, and that ^^ery peace be laid in
every side of the wound ^^ter an ynche of dystau^ce / and when they be dry
^ewe them subtylly / and the lyppes will reioyne to ^ydre. Demand. What nedles
ought they to be for to make these incarnatyfe semes? Answer. They ought to be
even and smoth, and three edged at the point / and at the eye they ought to be
holow /because ye threde shall not let it to pass easily. Dema^nde. In what
wounds accords the seames conseruatyues? Answer. They conioyne in wide
wounds (where as the flesh is lost) for to approach ye lyppes, wherein it
behooves to draw some thing out / because they may the sooner be consolydate.
Demand. When is it time to take away the seames / and how ought they to be
taken away? Answer. The time to do the^ away is when they have done their
operacyon. And the manner to take them of, is to put the tail of the prove
under the fyst / and to cut the threde of the said tail of the prove / and in
putting the flat of the prove above the lyppe whereby ye threde is drawn out,
for dread of dyuydynge the wound.

Questyons upon the manner to make and to applycate the bolsters.
Demand. What is the manner to make bolsters? Answer. Auncyently they were
made of feathers sewed between two white clothes / and therefore are they called
plumeceaulx or pylowes of feathers in french. And because that they behooved to
often to be renewed and removed / which was over anoyous / it is found to make
them of towe or flax of hemp well boucked and cleansed / and sometime with wol or
cotton / and sometime is put soft and thynne clowtes in two or three foldes or mo
/ as it needs. Demand. Wherefore serves the bolsters? Answer. To stay and
conpryme the places dissolved / and confort the natural heat of the membre
vnioynte / and to deffende ye greues of the lygatures. Demand. How ought the
bolsters to be applicate? Answer. Sometime they be laid to dry / sometime they
ought to be moysted or bathed in gleyr of eggs, in wine, or in oil, as the
dysposycyon requires. And they be of three sorts, some be three square, which
(Auycen says) serve to bread flesh / and ought to be laid on each side of
the wound / and the other on the wound in ioynynge them together / and some
are round that are laid dry on the other to keep the natural heat, and to
ripe the rotte^nes / and other be square, and they are laid to deffende the
hurtynge of the lygatures.

Questyons upon the manner to applycate lyntes and tents.
Demand. In how many and what case ought to be used lyntes and tents?
Answer. In.viij. cases. First is if so be that the wounds that we will
enlarge, cleanse, or draw out any thing fro ^he botome / as in deep wounds
that have need to be serched for the lycour that assembleth in the botome of
the spaciosite. Secondly they be used in ^olowe wounds / wherein we ought to
engendre flesh. Thyrdly in wounds altered of air, which ought to be
cleansed. Fourthly in wounds bruised. Fyfthly in appostumes. Syxtly in wounds
that must be wrought about the bones. Seventhly in bytynges. And last in
wounds vlceres. And all other wounds without tents and moches ought to be
understand to be consolydate. Demand. Wherefore be tents and lyntes made?
Answer. Some be for to cleanse the wounds / and they be made of soft tender,
as of sear old lynen cloth / other are made to keep the lyppes of wou^des
open and they ben made of very clean towe / or of fine clowtes, or cotton, or
of quyll of bras or silver holowe, as to the nosethyrlles for to have air, or
in deep wounds that the rottennes reclose not but come out. Other are made to
enlarge the oryfyces of the wounds / and they be made of sponges hard wrythen
or of Gencyan rotes.

Thus ends the third treaty of this present questyonary.
Here begins the fourth treaty of this present questyonary / in
containing.iiij. partycles. In the first partycle is moved and solued
certain questyons and dyffycultees upon the manner of bledynge.
Demand.
WHat is bledyng or blood lettynge? Answer. Diverse Auctours have given diverse
diffynycions of bledynge. Arnolde of the new town in his book of partyculer
operacyon that bledynge is incysyon of veins / by the which incysyon the
blood euacueth and the humors that re^ne in the veins with ye blood. And
Auycen in his first fen, of the first book of his canon says / that bledynge
is an universal euacuacyon of emptyeng the multitude of humors. And in the
third book of the said canon he has dyffyned that it connue euacuacyon of
humors. And Galyen upon the syxth article of the affoe of Ypocras upon this
canon. Quecunque flo^mia. etc. says that it is the common help of pluresy.
Demand. What euacuacion is most surest and least dangerous / either the
lettynge blood or the medycyne laxatyfe? Answer. After Galyen in his little
book that he made of blood lettynge / that lettyng of blood is the least
dangerous / for it is restraynt when we will, and not the medycyne / for after
that it is ones taken it will do ye operacyon. Demand. For how many
intencions be the bledynges made? Answer. For.vj. The first is for ^o purge /
and of this intencyon says Galyen in the third of his Terapentycke that
euacuacyon for the object regards all only ye replexion. The ^econde
intencyon that bledynge is made is for to dyuerte, and this intencion puts
Galyen in the ^econde book of blood lettynge / it is sometime an^yspatyc / that
is to say dyuersyue / and this declares Galyen in ye fyfth book of his
Terapentycke / as the flux of blood at the nose of the right nosethrylle, is
restraynte by the bledynge of the right arm. And when the left nosethrylle
bledeth the blood lettynge of the left arm restrayneth it / for the diuersion
of the blood that for the blood lettynge takes another way / and tourneth in
to other places than at ye nose. And this likewise shows us Ypocras in ye
fyfth partycle of his affor / where he says that if the hinder part of the
head did ache / yt the sovereign remedy is to make the right vein of the
foreheade be opened / and not only for the euacuacyon that is made by the
bledynge, but likewise for the antispase and diuersion. The third intencyon
wherefore bledyng is made is for to attray as Galyen declares in the book
aboue-sayde of blood lettynge. If we will cause the menstrues of women to come
we cause the sophynes of the fete to be opened / nyghe to ye time that they
should come / or else we apply to them ventoses with scaryfycacyons in the nether
parties. The fourth intencyon wherefore lettynge of blood is made is for to
alter / as says Galyen in the fourth book of his Terapentycke / and upon the
first article of the affor / that blood lettynge unto Lipothomie / that is to
say unto fayllynge of the heart, suddenly coleth all the body / and restrayneth
the fever as if it had slain it. The fyfthe intencyon is for to preserve /
and this intencyon declares Galyen in the said book of blood lettynge, and on
the syxte of affor, upon this affor / that to who soever ye blood lettynge is
good and conuenable where as he says that many dyspose to periplemonie and
spyttynge of blood, to quynsees, to epylence, and appoplexy were preserved of
the said inconuenyentes / by lettynge of blood at the spring time. The syxte
intencyon is for to lyghten nature / as Galyen declares in the eleventh book
of his Terapentycke the xv. chapter, toward the mids of the said chapter /
saying that it is than better to cut ye vein, not only for the fevers
synocalles / but also in all the other that are of rotten humors / and to them
that have aege and suffysau^t strength thereto. For nature dyspensed over all
the body is lyghtned because yt the thing that grieved it is taken away / as a
great burden lessened and made light. The rest it dygereth that ye ought to be
dygered / and dyuyde that yt ought to be dyuyded / and return to kyndly
operacyons. Demand. What be they that may well bear the lettynge of blood?
Answer. To this questyon Galyen in the book above said of blood lettyng says
that it is they that are robust and strong / and that have byg and large
veins / and that be not to lean, to white, and ten^er. And contraryly the
other may scantly suffer it for they have but little blood / and their flesh
is ^argely enaporable. Demand. What folk ^uffreth not blood lettynges?
Answer. It is they that are of contrary dysposycyons to the dysposycyons
aforesaid / as whytely colored and lean folks, or over fat and weyke, yt
have streyt veins and tender folk / and specially little children before. xv.
years / and old folk after.lxx. years / if it be not by great need and with
great cautele / and he that be not wont to be letten blood, and they that have
weyke stomachs / and have flux of the belly dyatryc / and people gullyng,
fraungyng, and dronkerdes, and women with child, chyefly in the first and
last months / as unto.iiij. months / and after.vij. months unto the end
/ and women having their flowers, and Rasis in his fourth book of his Almansor
puts to them that have fasted and suffered hunger. The fleumatykes, and them
that and wont to diseases of cold maladyes. And those that dwells in very
cold regyons, or vehement hot. Demand. How many and what veins are to be
let blood in the body of mankind? Answer. As Haly says in the nynth sermon
of the second part of his book / de regali dispositione / there be xxxiij. Of
the which there be.xij. amyd the arms / that is to wit two medyans, two
cephalykes, two basilykes, two affelleres, two cubytalles, and two seynalles.
And in the head there be.xiij. That is two behind the ears, two in the
angles of ye eyes, two organykes, two on the su^ne of the head, one on the
foreheade, one on the hyndre part of the head, one on the nose, and two under
the tongue. And there be.viij. in the fete, two on the knees, two sopheynes,
two scyatykes, and two at the ancles. Howebeit Albucrosus puts in all
but.xxv. That is to wit.xv. in the head.v. in the arms, and.v. in the legs.
Demand. Is it lefull and conuenable to let blood on the arteres? Answer.
Yea, howbeit it is very doubtful / and yet may ye let blood at the arteres of
the temples and behind the ears. Demand. How ought the arteres to be
opened? Answer. It is better to cut them through then otherwise. Demand. In
how many manners ought ye veins to be opened? Answer. After three manners, that
is to wit the common veins be cut in length, the partycules overthwart / and
are cut through and be canterysed. Demand. In what qua^tyte ought the blood
to purge by the blood lettyng? Answer, It is not possible to measure the blood
lettynges by certain rule / for all medycynall euacuacyons ven coniecturatyues
as Galyen says in his foresaid book, and in his second book of his
Terapentyke. Howebeit Arnolde of de villa noua the new town after the
doctrine of Ypocras measures ^t by coniecturacyon / saying that in blood
lettynge is not to be considered the quanty of the blood all only / but also
must be considered ye time, the regyon, the aege, and the disease. Demand.
Which of the said consyderacions that ought to be had to measure the quantyte
of the bledyng be most necessary / and that ought syngulerly to be
^^nsydered? Answer. There be two among the other / that is the strength of
the malady, and the virtue / for if the malady be great and the necessyte and
the virtue be strong, a great bledynge ought to be made for one time. And if
the virtue be weyke and the necessyte great / it ought not to be done so much
at one time / but ought for to b^ withdrawn and taken away at two or three
times / after as the virtue may suffer at once. And this to do ought to be
considered the poulce / and when it is seen that it alyeneth to vnequalyte /
and that it minissheth the vein ought to be stopped. Thus likewise ought to be
considered the color / for if it change to better disposicion and color / it
ought to be stopped. As it appears by Galyen in ye fyfthe book of sharp
dyseases. And the great bledyng after Galyen and Auycen is of two pound / and
the least of half a pound / and the mean of one pound. Demand. At what
hour / and at what time ought the bledynge to be made? Answer. At all times
necessary and constraynte. The time constraynte is the time when the bledynge
ought to be made / and can not be in any wise tarried / with out more danger
whereunto ought not totally to be regarded in things that should hyndre or let
it / if the lettynge were not so great (as says Bernard of Gordon) yt there
might ensue greater inconuenyence. In such case it may be correct and turned
to some other euacuacyon / as in a child that has a fever synocall instead
of lettyng blood to be boxed. Howebeit that Auynzar let his sone blede that was
but three years old, and healed him. Auerois recounteth in the seventh book of
his collyget, in speaking of this time, and this hour, at all times, and at
all hours, as well by night as day, and ought to let blood without any delay.
The time chosen is the time conuenable to do it / after the instaunce of the
bodies above / and the dysposycyons below / as to the dysposynge of the
bodies. That is to wit that the moon have good light / as of.vii.ix. or.xi.
days in encreasyng, or of xvii.xix. or.xxi. in wanynge / and neither be in
conjunction nor opposycyon / and that she be in a good place, and good sign /
and fre of all ill signs. And master Arnolde de villa noua says in his
affor. That to let blood is best about the mids of the third quadre /
because that than be but little condensed, no renmatizanted. And the
salernytans do choose the bledynge at diverse hours / after that at diverse
hours the humors have their course. Nevertheless it is to be noted as touching
these things that are said / that there where as the two influences may not
both together overcome. The Phisycyen or Cyrurgyen ought sonest to stey at that
yt is best known unto him / that is to the influence here beneth / which is
effect of the dysposycyon above. Demand. How many and what condycyons
ought the workman to have that will dyspose him to let blood? Answer. He
^ught to have four condycyons. First he ought to be young, virtuous and
strong / so that he be ^at caduke nor shaking of his hands. The se^onde is
that he ought to be of good sight, that he may well dyscerne the veins on ye
places where they be. The third is that he ought to be accustomed for to do
it. The fourth that he ought to be furnysshed of bendes and cotton / and red
powdre / because that he may ouerceas^e morogie if it hap to come. Demand.
What ought to be the manner to set blood? Answer. First he ought to rub the
place well all about that he will let blood / and than he ought to take a list
or a gyrdel wherewith he must bind the membre higher than the place where he
will make the opening. And than he ought well to hold the place where the
veins is that he will open / and seek it with the end of his finger / and
than open it softely / and pearce it not through / but ought to reyse somewhat
the point of the launcet upward for fear to hurt ye artere or the synewe /
and his euacuacyon thus suffycyently done, to take away the gyrdell that it
was bound with / and dylygently close the wound with a little cotton and bend
it. Demand. How ought he to be governed that will be letten blood before he
do blede / and after that he has bled. Answer. To the first demand I say
or he be letten blood / if he double that the blood be gross / or in cold
wether as in winter / he ought to walk a little and travail / or be bayned
the day before / specially if he should blede at any little vein of the hands
or fete. And if ye veins as yet appear not well, a day before he must have a
plaster of leueyne And if he doubt of his strength that he were to weyke / or
he blede give him a ^o^te with wine / and than proceed and make him blede
^yttynge if he be strong. If he be weyke let him ^yt in his bed somewhat
raised. To the second d^maunde how he ought to be governed when actually he
is let blood. First if he have rings or stones that have special virtues for
to staunche that he leave them of. And than when ye opening is made give him a
staff in his hand / and that he remove his fyngers and coughe / and that he
be a little stryken on the hand and sholdres. And if the wether be cold / or
that ye doubt that the blood be to gross, or that ye make feco^dacyon / ye
must make an opening long enough. And in wether / and opposyte dysposycyon
ye must make it lesser / and if the virtue be weyke ye must have cold water
all ready for to rub him. And make him other things that are accustomed to be
made for faylyng of the heart, if his heart do faynte. As to the third
questyon, how he ought to be governed after the bledynge / I say that if for
the bledynge he chaufe, ye must give him some of a pomgarnade to eat with a
little cold water, by ye counceyll of Galyen / and if he be not chauffed give
sauge leaves wet in wine. And then lie him vpryght upon a bed decly^yng
somewhat on the side that he has blede on / and close the door and the wyndowes
/ so that by over much light his eyes be not troubled. And an hour after,
(not before) let him ^ate temperatly and not gredyly / and let his meat be of
good substance and qualyte / and that it eugendre good blood and rectify the
ill if any be, and let his drink be more than his meat / but not so much as
he is wont. And if he be accustomed to sleep.ij. or.iij. hours / after let
him sleep a little. Howebeit Auycen forbyddeth holly the slepynge soon after
lettynge of blood / for the co^fraction that than after ensue in the members /
and that the pacyent take good head that his vein open not again / and he
ought to keep this rule three days after. Demand. Is the Cyrurgyen bound to
have the knowledge of the blood that is drawn? Answer. No, but the beholdynge
of the said blood belongs to Physycyens. Nevertheless for to comfort him yt
has bled / and to rejoice him he ought to look on it, and tell him that his
bledynge was good / for ye blood that is drawn was good / and that is better
that is remained, and if it be ill it was a good bleding for him. Demand. If
the Cyrurgyen would have the knowledge of the blood yt he has drawn by the
blood lettynge / how shall he dyscerne the good from the bad? Answer. For the
good is it that is his substance is neither to thycke nor to thynne, and that
is frangyble / and in his color is read. In odoure pure, and in savor sweet
and amyable / and the ill blood is it that is deuoyde of the said condicyons,
as the coleryke yt is to thyn^e and yelowe and bitter / and is sharp in smell.
And the melancolyke blood is thycke and black, or yellowysshe drawing to
dymine^ and aygre in savor. And the blood stewmatyke is thycke and gleymy /
and white in color, and sweet in ^auour / and the blood where as is much
water betokens that the pacyent was a good drynker / or that his reins be
feeble and weyke. And that that is graueyllous, and of color and substance of
ashes / betokens that he is a lazar / and the blood black and asshy is ill,
and betokens corrupcyon of humors / and dysposycyon to fevers and appostumes
/ and evil pustule and blaynes. And yt which is thycke / and the skin over
strong, so yt scantly it will break / sygnyfyeth disposycyon to opilacions.
And ye blood that has the color of greas and blood, sygnyfyeth coldness, or
over great heat and adustyon. Of the which thou shall know the dyfference by
the behauyng of the body. And the blood that can not congele, signifies that
he is waxen cold and ^nnatural. And that that congeleth in competent time, as
in half an hour, sygnyfyeth that he is natural. And of all these manners and
sygnyfycacyons it is very good for the Cyrurgyen to call the Dhysycyens because
of parfyte knowledge.

Here ends the first partycule of this treatise.
And here begins the second partycule wherein is moved and assoyled certain
questyons and dyffycultees upon the manner of ventosynge or boxynge.
Demand.
WHat is ventosyng. Answer. It is the putting of boxes upon any membre for to
expuls the matter between the sky^ne and the flesh. Demand, What are
ve^toses? Answer. Uentose is an instrument made in manner of a box with a
streyt neck and a wide belly. Demand. Where of ought ventoses to be made?
Answer. After Albucrasis they be made of three things. Some of horns, some of
glass, and some of brass. Demand. How many fourmes is there for to use
ventoses / and what is their effects? Answer. Some be with garsynge / and
other without scaryfycacyon. Those that be done without scaryfycacyon draws
the matter out felyng, and ye other contraryly. Demand. What dyfference is
between euacuacions done by blood lettynge, by ventosynge, and by snayles blood
sowkers? Answer. The most dyfference is of blood lettynge / for it draws
the blood deper than the boxynge or the snayles / and the snayles deper than
the ventoses / which proprely draws but between the skin and the flesh.
And therefore Auycen says yt they purge more the thynne blood than the thycke
/ and more the vpperest than the nether. Demand. For how many and for what
intencyons are ventoses appli^ate with gar^^ng upon a man's body? Answer.
For.xij. intencyons. Some general, and some pertyculer. The general is made
to cleanse sensybly / and have the place of a blood lettynge / when blood
lettynge dare not be done for dyners things that lets blood lettyng, as in
a child of.xiiij. year old, and in aged folk above.lxx. years. And for this
cause Auycen calls ve^toses curates of ye veins. The.vij. intencyons whereby
the said ventoses is applied, is taken of the places yt they be set to. The
first is to purge the matter of the head, and the parties thereof / and
therefore they are applied in the nawpe of the neck, and keeps the place of
the cephalyke bledynge. And therefore they be good for the dyseases of the eyes,
to the infections of the face, and stynkynge of the mouth. The second
intencyon is for to cleanse the spyrytual matters / and therefore they must be
applied between the shuldres / and keeps the mean for blood ^ettynge of the
medyan / and therefore they be con^etent to the dyseases of asma, palsye, and
spettynge of blood. The third intencion is to empty the matter that is
contained in the nutrytyfe members / and therefore should they be applied to the
raynes and to the loins / and there they take the place of ^asilica / and
therefore they avail to the opylacyons ^^ostumes, and dolor of the liver of
the reins, and scabbes of all the body. The fourth intencion is that it is
applied in the mids of the arm, for the ache and pains of the parties
thereof. The fyfth intencyon is for that it is applied in the mids of the
thyghes and the legs nygh to the ancles, and applied there is in the stead of
the blood lettynge of the sophynes / and therefore they provoke the flowers to
women / and causes them to pysse, and eases the pains of the matryce and the
bladder, and co^fereth to the gowte of the fete and evil sores. Demand. For
how many / and for what intencyons the ventoses applied without scarificacyon?
Answer. But for one general intencyon / and for.xi. partyculers. The
intencyon general is for to draw, and the particulers do vary after the places
that they be applied to. The first place is upon the ypocondres to reduce and
dyuert the blood of the nosethrylles after Galyen in the fyfth of his
Terapentyke saying that when the right nosethryll does blede, for to staunche
it ye ventose must be applied upon the liver / and when one bledeth at the left
nosethryll it must be applied on ye mylt. The second place where they be
applied is under the breasts for to staunche and dyuerte the flowers of women,
as Ypocras says in ye fyfth of his affo, and as Galyen declares in the
beginning. The third place where they ought to be applied is on the interyour
part of the head for to reyse the euela / and to staunche the rewme. For to
draw the deep matter outward as Galyen declares in the xiij. book of his
Terapentycke / and for that cause they be often applied upon ye appostumes that
be in the clensyng places / the which Auycen hyddeth to be drawn out as much
as may be. Likewise they be applied for ye same cause upon ye thyghes / for to
provoke flowers in women. And also nyghe to the appostumes of the joints / to
wtdrawe and deffende that the said appostumes do not bread / and to put ferof
the humors fro ye said joints. The fourth place to apply them is upon the
bredyng of synewes, in palsy, for to heat them as Auycen says in the third
book of his Canon in the Chaptour of palsy. And Galyen in the third book of ye
interyours, where as he proves against Archygenes that the brain is pryncyple
and beginning of the virtue anymall. The fyfth place to apply ventoses is upon
the belly in colyke passion, for to resolve and vnuapen the ve^tosire, and cease
the pain. The.vj. place is upon the matryce, and upon the bowelles for to
reduce and withdraw them to their places, as Auycen says in his third canon.
The.vij. place is upon the rybbes and like bones for to reduce and return
them in to their places, when they are broken or dysioynted. The. viij. place
is upon the ways and poores whereby the vryne passes from the reins to the
bladder / as Auycen says in the third book of his Canon. The.ix. place is
upon the ears and gappes of depe^ wounds, for to draw out the fylth or other
noyaunce if there were any. The.x. place is upon the neck for to enlarge the
ways of the breath and of the meat. The.xj. place to apply ventoses is upon
venymous bytynges and blaynes to draw out the thycke venym. Demand. How
ought they to governed that must be ventosed before and after it? Answer. To
the first answers Galyen in the third book of the cretyke days, and the
same proves Albumazer i^ his great introductory that the chosen days for to
apply ventoses is when the moon is full and not in the wane. For as the moon
increases in light / likewise increases the humors within the body / and as
it waneth so descreaseth ye humors and withdraw them inward. And therewith it
ought to be an australl day / that is to say hot and moist / and the ventoses
ought to be plied fro two of the clock unto three. And after ye intencyons of
doctors / first ye place ought to be bathed and fomented (which should be
ventosed) with warm water if the blood be thycke / but if it be thynne it is
not need at all, for it should be danger of to much resolucyon / and that the
strength should weyken. And it is to note / that never scaryfieng ought to be
made but first ye must put to the ventose dry, because the blood must be
drawn or it be voyded. As to the second question it is to be noted as is
before spoken that there be two manners of ventoses. Some be of horn / and some
of glass. They of horn are applied in suckynge. They of glass with towe put in
to the ventose / and fire in the twoe and laid on the flesh / than the fire
quenches where the ventose takes. Or after Albucrasis / take a little candell
of wax and give it a little stey below that it may hold right upon the
flesh, and light it, than set on the ventose, and the candell will quench
and the ventose take hold. And the Cyrurgyen ought with his hands to rub
all about the place to move the blood to it. As to the third questyon after
that ye have applied and set to the said ventose by two or three times if it be
need when it is taken away ye ought to make certain scaryfycacyons very deep
with the rasour / and than wype and dry the blody place / and than ones again
set to the ventose as ye did before / and keep it on half an hour till it be
half full of blood, and then take it away and ^ype the place, and set it on
again, and hold it there more or less till ye have suffycyently half a
^ounde of blood, or to a pound, after the tenor ^f the strength the quantyte
of the replexyon. And (...) after the first apposycyon after the scaryfyca^^on
if it blede not well rub the place with the mouth ^f the ventose, or give it small
fyllyps with your (...) / and garse it a new that it may blede well / and when
it has been ventosed wype and dry the (...) / and than anoynte it with oil of
Roses or ^^her oyntement to mytygate the smert / and go^^rne the pacyent as is
aforesaid of them to be ^^ten blood. Demand. Shall they be set upon ^restes
of women or other soft place? Answer. ^ay, for danger that it do not enter
to deep in quantyte, and may not be had again. Demand, If the ventoses will
not hold when they be set on, what ought ye Cyrurgyen do to make them fast?
Answer. He must bath and foment the place all about with warm water in such
wise and so long that the air enter not. Demand. Is it needful for to
continue and keep them long? Answer. No, specially about the pryncipal
members that are the mines of strength / for behind the neck they hurt the
mind / and behind the shuldres they anoy the heart / and in the right
ypocondre they noye the liver.

Thus ends the second partycule of this treatise.
Here begins the third partycule of this treatise / where as be moved and
assoyled some dyffycultees and questyons upon the manner to apply blood souckers
or horse leches.
Demand.
Wherefore are horse leaches applied? Answer. For to understand ye solucyon of
this questyon is to be noted what horse leches be. They are well known to be
certain little black worms like to Myce tails and have small yelowe
streykes on their backs somewhat brownysshe under the belly / and to the
question they are put and applied to draw or soucke as is beforesaid.
Demand. Which are the blood suckers that ought to be chosen / and which are
wholesome / and which are dangerous and ought not to be applied in any wise?
Answer. They that be good are found in clear waters / and they that be of a
loathsome color with great heads, and that be rotten, and found in noughty
waters be dangerous, evil, and venymous. Demand. To what bodies and to what
members ought they to be applied? Answer. They ought only to be applied in
bo^^es void of replexyon / for in cacechymyke bo^^es and replete they ought
never to be applicate as touching the places and members that they ^ughte to
be put to / they are applied but only to ^uche places as ventoses can not be
set, as to sy^ewes, in the lyppes, gu^mes, and in places dry and ^^ar^e of
flesh, as the fyngers and joints. And ^hedery^ wylleth that sometime they be
set upon ^^ostumes of the clensynge places, which are of ^^ffycyle ^uracyon
and maturacyon / and some will ^aue them set on emoroydes for to open them.

^Demau^de. In how many maladyes are blood ^^^kers good? Answer. Auycen
says yt they be ^ood to scabbes, to emoroydes, and to apostumes of the
clensynge places as it is said. Demand. How should blood suckers be applied?
Answer. They ought not to be applied when they are new taken / but kept in
fresshe clear water all a day till they have purged of all that was in their
belyes. And than rub the place that ye will put them to till it do wexe r^ddy
/ and wasshe it or anoynte it with a little blood, or garse it with a rasoure
that some blood issue / and than put them to with a read or your hands / and
put them in two or three places as need shall be. And when they have well sucked
and drawn till they be full, they will fall of by them self / or else put a
little vyneygre on their heads, or white salt, or aloes, or separate them
with a horse hear or a fine threde. Demand. How shall the place be ordered
after that they are fallen of? Answer. Rub and wasshe it with salt and
vyneygre. Demand. If after thextraction and fall of the worm there follow
emororgie or to great flux of blood, what ought the Cyrurgyen to do? Answer.
To staunche it with a plaster of Bolarmynyke galls, balastye, and other that
stau^che blood. Demand. How ought he to be ruled that has been blood sucked
after that they are fallen of? Answer. He ought to be ordered as they that be
let blood, as it is written in ye first partycle of this treatise / and he
ought to take tryacle for doubt of ventosytees that blood suckers do bread.

Thus ends the third partycle of this present treatise.
Here follows the fourth partycle / where as be moved and soyled other
dyffycultees touching the manner of canterisynge or searynge.
Demand.
WHat is canterysacyon? Answer, It is an operacyon made with fire artyfycyally
in ye body of man for certain vtylytees. Demand. How many manners of
Canteres be there? Answer. Two manners Some are actualles and they appear
suddenly in ^ffecte, as they that are made with instruments of ^etall, and
brennynge / or with the rote of Arysto^ogie, or of Affodylles that are sore
heart, or with water, or with sethyng oil laid to the place, co^^yngly and
not at adventure. Other are potencyall whose operations are not so sensible nor
so soday^^, but appears afterward as they that be made ^^th bre^ning or
ruptycke medecines. And there is (...) manners of them. Some are of strong
op^^^ssyon, and makes scarres as lyme and soap and ^^^^ardus. Some other
thyrleth more lightly (...) make no scarres, but blysters as canterides,
^^^mule, and pantalupina. Demand. Which ^anteres are the surest, the
actualles, or the poten^yalles? Answer, The actualles, because ye action of
fire is most simple. And also it hurts less the next parties, and
pryncypall members than the action of rupture / for it is greatly suspecte to
the pryncipall members / and therefore it ought not to be applied, but if case
be that the pacyente were faynte herted and durst not abide the fire / and in
case that ye would apply canteres lastly and for to purge / for in such case
the rupture for the pain that it makes and for the byg scar that it leueth,
and in weykynge of ye place is cause of bygger flux of blood. Demand. Which
is most profitable to make actual canteres with gold or with yren? Answer.
In pryncypall and tender members, as the eyes it is better to do it with gold
than with yren. Howbeit in other me^bres it is more behoue full to do it with
iron as says Albu. For the fire may be better esteemed in ye yren than in the
gold or in silver because of their colors, but if it were a goldsmyth that is
wont thereto. Demand. If actual canteres be necessary, and to whom, and
wherewith? Answer, First they be necessary to conserve health and to heal
diseases, and keeps the rowme of profitable purgynges, as blood let tynges,
and clensynge by medicines laxatyues, in such that may not suffer them. And the
rest that remains after the purgynges it corrects in great and strong
dyseases, where as it is wont to be given. Secondly they be necessary and
conuenable to be given in all dysposycyons of maladyes / and special in
materyal maladyes, saufe in such as are hot and dry / wherein they do many
euylles / and that it is true that they be profitable in the other first
dysposycyons, and cold dysposycyons and moist, in as much as it contraryeth
them holly. Thyrdly in hot and moist dysposycyons in which suppose that holly
they do not contrary, nevertheless they contrary accydentally / in as much as
it voydeth the cause of the maladye. Howebeit it is to be noted that suppose a
cantere be a profitable remedy and very conuenable, yet it is not now adays
so much in use as it was wont to be for the abusers of the art and that
exercysed it, the which indyfferently and in all dysposy^ions, that is to wit
in replection or otherwise apply them. And it is evil done / and many euylles
follows thereby. And therefore good Cyrurgyen beware right well, that in a
person full of humors good or bad never to apply Cantere without precedent
purgacion. Demand. For how many and what vtylytees are canteres made and
ordey^ed? Answer. For.vj. vtylytees. The first to com^orte the members, for
they chanfe and dry the members that were dulled with cold and humy^^te. And
therefore Galyen says of the auctoryte (...) Ypocras, that the dry thing is
nerest the hole ^hynge / and the moist thing ferdest of. The se^^ude vtylite
is to withstand and deffende the mem^re from corruption. And therefore Auycen
in his fourth book commands them to be done round about the estionoenes
sores spredyng or compassynge, and to corrupt bones. The third vtylyte that
Auycen puts is to resolve the coarted matters in any membre / and therefore
byddeth Albucrasis and Haly abbas that they be applied to the pains of the
joints, and great doloure of ye head. The fourth vtylyte is to staunche the
blood, as Auycen puts, and Galyen in the fyfth of Terapenty^ / because they
make scarre. The fyfth vtylyte is purging old fluxes as the eyes, and of all
the body, and this vtilite puts Arnolde of villenensis. And for that cause
be the cetons and canteres done (behind the neck,) and in the fontenelles of
the lacertes where as one is divided from the other) under the said lacertes a
two or three fyngers fro the joints. The syxth vtylyte that Galyen puts is
to entrebreake, and intercyde the matter. And for that cause are the veins of
the temples canterysed / because that the matter re^ne not in to the eyes / and
in ruptures that the bowelles shall not descend, and in the cyrcuyt and next
places to wicked sores. And of this vtylyte Arnolde of vylle. makes an
afforysme / where he says yt the rennynge can not be diuerted nor issue
kyndly / and that his abiden may be co^petently cleansed by canteres. The.vij.
vtylite is for to draw out the superfluytees. This vtylite the common usage
approves by operacyon of apostumes by canteres, and by cuttynge of kyrnelles,
and extyrpacyon of flesh quycke or dead. Demand. Which are the places and
partycle of actual canteres? Answer. After men of this time there be.viij. The
first is applied to the ^oppe of the head whereto the master finger may reche
beginning a spanne fro nyghe to the rote of ye nose stretching upward / and
the doctors will that there ought to be applied a round cantere with an
oliuare for to resolve the brain and dyuert the rewpose matters in the subject
places by low / and some deep them to the bone / and other raze and make bare
the first table of the scul. Howebeit Alb. approves it not / and the said
canteres applied to the said places avails to ydlenes, falling evil, pains
of the head, and to rennynge of the eyes, to ptysyke, and to all rewmes. The
second place to apply canteres ought to be in the flesh of the head
behind in ye noddle. And they ought likewise to be applied round with an
olyuare / and avails for to heat and conforte the head in palsy, in
trembling of lymbes, crampe, and to pale lazery. The third place to apply
can^eres is on the eye lyddes to correct them and reyse them / and is done
with a cantere mytilyn instead ^f pytche, for to close ye holes or places of
ye drawn ^eares, to let them grow again / and ought to (...) actual, that
is in manner of a nedle. Likewise ^^ey be applied to ye lachrymalles to consume
the ^^perflue flesh / and is done with a small actual ^^ntelayre nygh to the
nose, for the fystula, and with (...) quyll. Likewise to ye temples with a
cantelayre to close the veins, to staunche the rewme that falls over the
eyes. And it is applied to the nose with an actual through a quyl or read for
to consume the stynke. The fourth place is for to apply them within the vnulle
for to cut it with a sharp cantere through a quyl. The fyfth place is the
neck where as cetons are applied with tongues cetoned or with a nedle cetonned
behind the neck in the pyt / and they are applied to depart the humors that
re^ne to the eyes / as Lanfrancke says. And other say that they have sen by
experience yt r^u^de canteres applied to the said places and left long open
heal the madness, and the fransy, and furyous. And Galyen in the.xiij. of his
Terapentye says, that a ventose made on the noddle is good help for rewmes
that descend over the eyes / and for the most help so did Guydon. The syxth
place is in the fore part of the neck under the chynne (by the counceyll of
some masters) for to cleanse ye matter of gout rose / and other infections of
the face and mouth / and they will that there be applied a cantere with cetons.
The seventh place is on the homoplate under the fontelles of the arms three
fyngers fro the joints, where as manyfestly is divided the lacert from the
lacert with a cantere and round clauall with head and plate perced. And in
the said place is applied inwardly the canteres for remedies of the face, and
fore part of the neck. And applied in the said place outwardly on the arm,
is for dyseases of the heed, and hinder part of the neck. The.viij. place to
apply canteres is on the parties of the breast or thorax under the furcules
with a round cantere or cetons for disease called asma, or shortness of
brethe, and disease of the lungpype. And likewise they be applied under the
arm holes for the pains of the sholdres and to cleanse and appale y^ lepry /
and likewise for the disease of epimace, or apostumes of the rybbes is opening
made with a knyfe ansall to draw out che rotte^nes / howbeit it is dangerous
of the fystule or of death for the weykenes of the heart / by cause of the air
that thyrlleth in at the opening as Albucrasis says. The.ix. place is on the
fore part of ye belly on the stomach with round canteres, or canteres with
cetons, that keeps it better open, for the dyseases of the stomach, or on the
liver, or on the mylte, for the dyseases of the said members. And under the
nauyll for the water of ydropesy. And Albucrasis and Haly do them with
claualles, dowble or treble. The.x. place is in the flanks for the rupture,
and in the coddes for swellynge of the coddes, and flanks, with ceton / and on
the share for the bladder. The.xj. place is behind on the reins / and is made
with a round or clauall cantere. The.xij. place is on the fonty^elles under ye
knee.iij. fyngers bread, there as the ^^^ert is dyuyded fro the lacert / and is
made with ^ounde claualles with place for the purgacyon of ^^l the body / and
the dyseases of the legs. De^aunde. Which are the general vtylytees of
can^eres potencyalles? Answer. Potencyall canteres are profitable / and serve
to such things as the actualles do, saufe that they conforte not as the
actualles, but they weyken the members / and therefore be they more appropried
to empty and derive the humors, open apostumes, and restrain flux of blood
than the actualles. Demand. Which are the partyculer, and profitable places
of potencyal canteres? Answer. First as touching their partyculer vtylytees,
they are taken of the places where as they are applied / and the places where
as they are applied ben such / for the brennynge potencyalles ought to be
applied i^ f^esshely places, because of their de^e drawing / and deper than
the actual brennynges. Howebeit they be more grievous in noble members. And the
blysters potencyall canteres be applied upon places between flesh and fell,
as under ye chynne, behind on the neck, in the face, on ye ancles, and on the
hands, for it holds but humors that are between the skin and y^ flesh,
as it appears by experyence. Demand. Which and how many be there of
actual canteres, whereto they be used, and what shapes have they? Answer.
Diverse auctours have used and dyscryued the form or shape of certain. Wyllyam
of Salicet discriueth.vj. or.viij. Lanfranc.x. Henry of Mundeuyll.vij. Howbeit
of all common canteres Guydon dyscryueth but.vj. whose names and forms
follows. The first is called Cultelere (of C^ustean) that is a knyfe, and it
is of two manners / one is called Dorsall because it has a back and cutteth
but on the one side / and the other is Ansall because it is made in manner of a
sword cuttynge on both sides. And with this Cultelere be the superfluous
flesshes cut, and apostumes are opened, and the sores vlceres rectified. Of the
which Culteres the shapes or fourmes are such as be here fygured.

The second cantere is named Oliuare because it resembles a kyrnell of Olyue,
as says Haly abbas in his.ix. book de ragali dispositione in the second
party, and chapy^er of doctions of the head, and not like to Olyue leaf as
wened Lanfrancke, Salicet, and Henry. Also his operacyon declares it, the
shape is thus.

The third Cantere is called Dacteler because it is in semblau^ce of a Date
stone / and it is bygger than is the Olyuare / and the form is such.

The fourth is named punctual, which has the point sclendre and round / and
it is of two manners. One is made with a rest or platte, because it shall not
^erce through the skin / and with this there be ^anteres to the dyseases
called knottes in the fontenelles / and in the arms and legs. The other is
plain and long in manner of a beme of the son / which is applied with a
quylle / The fourmes of them are such.

The quyll.
The fyfthe is called a cantere subtle wherewith the Cetons are applied with
small tongues broad and perced. And this is lyghter and more durable.

The pl^^^.
The form of the second is such / that the punctualles because the name of
punctualles do fall often, and have need of byndynge more tydeous than these be
/ the form is such.

The tongues.
The.vj. is called Cyrculare / which has.v. adiutours to make.v. canteres ad
nodulum with plate perced of.v. holes after this form following.

Demand. How and in what manner ought the canteres be applied? Answer. They
ought to be applied in the form as follows. That is, first the place must
be sought where yt they shall be applied, and wype it well and dry it, than
bliss it, after take your platyne or quyl and apply them all cold / but ye
must not let them ^ye long / and than give the canteres to the work man that
shall apply them all hot and very flamynge, so yt the pacyent se them not.
And let them be applied upon the said places in reuoluynge them contynually
from one place to another that they cleue not to the flesh, till the rednes
begone. And they must be harder pressed upon the bones ^han on the synewes,
and more lightly / and let it (...) done as often as need shall be. Demand. In
what time, and in what hour ought the canteres ^o be applied? Answer. After
Galyen in ye third and thyrtene book of his terapentyke, at all times and at
all hours as necessyte requires / so that ^he body be clean and not full of
humors. Demand. How long ought they to be kept open after the
canterysyng? Answer. After ye doctrine of Rog. and of those masters by ye
space of.xl. days or more, by the space of three months / for that is the
last term of apostumes as Ypocras says in the.vj. partycle of his afforysmes
/ and second of the pronostyces. And the cause is, for ye virtue confortatyfe
enters by the canteres by the foresaid time is euaporate, and the place
weyked / and also there abides replexyon of evil humors by the said
opening. Demand. How ought the place to be kept open after the
canterysynge? Answer. They must be kept open with tents or knottes of wax, or
with water in the which is steped and dyssolued the virtue of Euforbie, or
scamony, or colloquintida, or of elebora, after the kind of the humor that
shall be purged, or with a pease, or a nut made of the wood of yuy, or of
Gentian / and over it lay a cole leaf, or an yuy leaf / and over that a
lynnen cloth three dowble, and a platyne of brass or laton, or of silver bound
thereon, and be removed twyse or thryse a day. Demand. How must they be ordered
that shall be canterysed? Answer. Thus. First or they be canterysed they must
be conforted, and to them declare the vtylytees and goodness that canteres will
do to them / and if it be need to make to hold him fast, and to bind him
well. And after that they be canterised ye must apply on the said places oil
of Roses (with white of an egg well beaten together and well in corporate) by the
space of four days. And than apply upon it a maturatife made with butter well
washed and unsalted / and a little wheat flower, or with some other unctuous
thing and sweet without salt unto the scar be fallen / and than to be dressed
and healed as vlceres be / saufe only that if ye will keep them open for to
purge ye humors and the vaporous fumes, or that ye place had been opened long
aforehande. For which thing it should not be sure to close it without that it
were ^uacuate by another place, for it should be danger that the humors that
were wont to re^ne in the said membre should remain within / and that
peradventure it would deryuate to other members and do more harm than was
before. Demand. Is it of necessyte that after it is closed to open it again,
if it be lefull to open it in ye same place? Answer. Yes, or in another membre
nere to it, or to the next place, as Arnolde of new town says in his
parabolles. Demand. If they that be canterised with potenciall canteres may
be ordered as they be canterysed with actualles? Answer. Yes saufe that they shall
not be bound. And also those that blyster make no scarre, which must be well
applied, correct, and reprymate of their malyces. And after that the blysters
be raised perce them with cysours or a nedle, and lay a coleworte leaf thereon
/ and cover it with lynnen, and order it as ye list. And because that they be
not blystred nor make no scar thus they fall within.vij. days.

Thus ends this present questyonary made in the honor of almighty god / and
profit of young studyentes in Cyrurgery / wyllyng to apply their study in ye
same art.
The manner to examyne lazares / and to approve lepry mesel^y / after the minds
of Doctors.
AS Galyen witnesses it is great injury be it done to man or woman to depart
and put away them that be not infecte with lepry, nor touched with meselry, and
not being lazares. And also it is great danger to supporte, haunte, or be
with such as are stryken or dyseased therewith / for it is a contagyous and
dangerous malady. And therefore they that ought to judge and approve them
should right dylygently behold them and considre the vnyuoke signs and
equyuokes also. And not for one only token give their sentences / but by many
conuenaunces / and specially vnyuokes. First than when that the approuers come
or call them dyseased to their presence for to examyne them, they ought to
conforte them with wholesome words, and tell them that the said disease is
penance salutary for the salvation of their souls, and bid them to take it
pacyently. And that they fear not to say the troth / for if they were found
lazares it should be their purgatory in this world. For albeit that they were
refused of the world / yet they were and be chosen of God. etc. And than cause
them to swear to say the troth / and inquire of them such things as
follows. Secondly the examyners ought to inquire of them by the prymatyfe
causes of lepry. And first inquire of them if there were any of his lygnage
that he knew to be lazares / and specially their faders or moders / for by any
other of their kynred they ought not to be lazares / but if it were by some
constellacion that influed equally upon a kynred / and specially on them that
dwelt together, and have one self manner of living / as we se oftentimes by the
time of pestylence, if any of a kynred be stryken or enfect / yt also many
other as brethren, and cosyns, or other parents soon after are stryken, and
yet or they have be borne. For as Auycen says in his second treatise the
first son of the fourth of his Canon in the first chapyter of rottennes. The
first cause of rottennes is meats / and the nourysshynge that is of evil
qualytees. And for that cause if a child be nourysshed of a woman corrupt and
infecte in her humors ought also to be infect. And not all only if the mother
be a lepresse / but let us behold also yt for the said cause by experyence
that they being conceyu^d in the time that ye woman has her flowers / and that
she be not clean that scantly the child ^^apeth lepry, or to be scalled, or
tached with such ^^fecte dyseases / or that he bear some tache upon ^ym. Also
if the father were fecte and in the matter whereof he is composed. For as Galyen
says in the first partycle of the efforysmes of Ypocras upon this canon Et
qui crescunt. The things that are dyssolued of an other thing necessaryly
extends of the nature of the thing whereof they are dissolved. Than ought ye to
inquire if he has had ye company of any lepresse woman. And if any lazare had
meddled with her before him and lately / because of the infect matter and
contagyous fylth that she had received of him. It is to be noted that a woman
is not so dangerous to be a lepresse to habyte with a lazare, as it should be
a man to habyte with a lazarous woman, or with one that has habited newly with a
lazare. For all infections remain in the matryce of the woman, unto the time
that they be pourged by their flowers and cleansed / which a man can not do,
because he has no receptacle where to hold the said i^mundycytees. Than ye
ought to inquire of him if he has had the quartayne fevers / and how long
sith? For howbeit (says Auycen in his first fen of the first book of his
Canon) the fever quartayne delyuereth a man of evil melancolyke diseases / and
wit if he has not had the emorroydes, and sith when? Like reason / the
emorroydes keeps that he fall not in to inconuenyence. Than inquire him of his
dreams / and if his dremes be not terryble / and that he sees black things,
and deuyls / such dreams betoken the melancolyke humor to have domynyon
whereby he is so enclyned. And wit of him how he is wont to live / as if he has
used meats with strong spyce and in great quantyte, and strong wives, or
garlyke, lekes, onyons, and colewortes, old chese, gotes flesh, of bears,
of foxes, of mesyl swyne, or salt meats, and of unclean fysshe all at one
table, and if he have continued therewith. And also of all manner herbs, and
such meats as brenne the blood, and holly consumes it. Than ask if he has
had great solycytudes, and chargeable thoughts that has dried him made him
melancolyke. Than ye ought to behold and consydre in your self of what
complexyon he is, as well natural as accydentall, for suppose that lepry be a
cold disease by incineracio^ of humors, yet Auycen says, the most au^cyent
cause of lepry is the evil complexyon of the liver that is so hot and dry
that it bre^neth the blood and melancolyeth it. After yt the pacient has been
examyned upon the first causes that dyspose a person to be a lazare / he
ought to be examyned and approved by the signs of lepry as well equyuocalles as
vnyuocalles / and are the signs that co^ueneth only in this disease / and the
equyuocal signs conueneth them in diverse maladyes. Of the vnyuocall signs.
First than in procedynge as it is said to the knowledge of the vnyuocal
signs, in following the doctrine of Ypocras in the first book of ye
pro^ostikes saying. Primo enim egri facie^ pernotabis. First you shall note ye
signs apperynge in the face for they are the truest / for all the signs
vnyuocalles are holden there because yt in ye face among al other me^bres of
the person is no greater nombre of spyrytes because of the.v. organes of
knowledge yt is there. That are the hearing, speaking, seeing, smellyng, and
feeling / and also it is the barest of flesh / and therefore it is soonest
altered of all ye other me^bres / and at this cause Gordon preserved a man at
Mou^tpyllier.x. years to be cast out, against the intencyon of all other
doctors there, because ye tokens appeared not in the face, and yet it did over
all the other members. First than begyn^e at the heyght of ye heed, and
behold his here and his brows, and pluck at them, and look if with ye rote
they draw any flesh by the rotte^nes and corrupcyon of their flesh. Such
by defaute of nourysshynge is soon seen. Item feel with thy finger if his brows
be not grauellous, and full of graynes, because that in all lepry the virtue
assymulatyfe defayleth. And for that cause when ye nourysshing comes to the
me^bres they may not assemble them to the me^bres at all / and therefore they
remain grayny / the which thing mounteth always next the members bare of
flesh as is the face. Than behold his eyes if they be round specially to
the domestyke party. Also likewise if his ears be round and thycke and
rugged. Also if his nosethyrlles be wide outward narow wtin and gnawen. Also
if his lyppes and gu^mes are foul stynkyng and corroded. Also if his voice be
horse, and as he speaks in ye nose. And also if his brethe and sweat stynke,
and all that comes fro him / and if there apere any straytnes of breath as if
would querken / and for that cause have the most haunte. Also if his look be
steyed and horrible in manner of monster. These signs be vnyuocalles that
always betoken lepry / when they are all or the most part of them with the
equyuocalles as it shall appear / and such signs come in lepry by these causes
as Auycen says. The first generacyon of lepry is in the entrayles, and for
that cause the lunges and lyghtes be hurt / and the pype of the voice
assysteth it, and causes them to speak as it were in the nose. And for the
rotten and corrupt fumes yt mount upward by the conductes of the brain, and
the hears lessen and fall for defaute of good fedynge. And they appear in the
face and in the breast.

Of the equyuocalles tokens.
THe Doctoures put.vj. tokens equyuocalles. The first is hardness and
tuberosyte of the joints outward as the arms, legs, hands, and fete, for
the dry matter, that is stopped by melancoly. The second is a morfewe color
and derke ^or the black melancolyke humor that corrup^eth the blood. The
third is falling of hear, spoken of in the vnyuokes. The fourth is wastyng
of a brawne, and chyefly of a poulce, so that when it ^s pynched it abides
vpryght by the consu^ption of the said muscle. The fyfth is the insensybylyte
of the rotten humors of the outward parts ex^cemytees, spredde within them.
The.vj. is black ^operous skal and scabbe in the face, and sores on the body
by rotten humors and corrupt, yt strive with ye evil fumosytees. The seventh
is graynes under ye tongue, and behind the ears / the causes are in the
vnyuokes. The.viij. is bre^nynge and feeling of pryckynges over all the body.
The.ix. is ruggyshnes of the skin in manner of a goos, for the great drythe
of the blood and humors. And therefore they ought to be vnclad and water cast
on them / and look if it take and synke in the skyn^e by cause of their drythe
/ where it seems that they are anointed they seem so much to be fat. The.x.
that they be of ill rule / and are commonly begylers. The.xj. that they have
terryble dremes, as I said before. The.xij. yt they have weyke poulces.
The.xiij. they have white vryne, thyn^e, and asshy. The.xiiij. their blood is
black and dusky^^he, of leady color, and sandye / and to se this it must be
wasshen and streyned.

The manner to let them blood, and to wasshe and strain it.
FYloyne says, that there must be a great opening in the vein when they be
letten blood because the thycke blood should not remain and the thynne only
come out. And when it is drawn, consydre the substance and the color if it
be so as is abouesayde, and than wasshe it, and pass it through a fair white
cloth / and than look on the flesh that abides in the cloute / and if it be
graueylous and troublous it is a great token. Otherwise take salt and meddle it
in the blood, and if it melte soon. Another way, take his vryne and vynegre /
and look if they will myngle together. Yet do thus, put some of the blood in to
a basyn full of water / and if it go down to the botome like meal it is a
token that he is a lazare.

Then good Cyrurgyen do not as a folysshe judge that forthwith gives his
sentence / but first or thou give it prefer God before thine eyes / and
consydre dylygently the vnyuocal signs and the equyuocalles, and se if they
agree / but yet neither judge a man to be lazarous by the equyuocalles / nor
for one or two of the vnyuocalles / nor by the least of the pryncypalles / but
there as the vnyuocalles in all or in the most part, and of the pryncypalles
accord with ye equyuocalles of the most part / and of the pryncypalles.

FINIS.
Thus ends the manner for to examyne lazares / and to approve their diseases
after the intencyon of Doctors.
Here begins the Formularye of the aids of apostemes and pustules ordained
at Paris by master Guydon of Cayllyac Cyrurgyen and doctor in medycynes at
Mount pyllier.
Because that after the doctrine of Galyen in tertio de ingenio sanitatis
likewise as of yt workman is the taking of the essence of the disease. Also
the science of things whereof it is given it behooves that it proceed of the
same / I than Antydotary ordynary in the science of apostemes whereby the local
remedies of the same apostemes shall be accomplysshed / but we must first
know the matter of the same. And that done may be found and chosen the
entencyon cutatyfe after the natures of them. And I say for certain that it is
right and artyfycyall way to work as it is proved in ye treatise before
alleged. Than I will put in this present formularye the knowledge of apostemes
and the aids whereby may be given local remedies after the intencyon of
Galyen, Rasis, and Auycen, such as I can compryse in their doctrine. And
merueyle you not if I have not willed to publysshe this work, and have kept
it secret. For it has not ben for pride / but for certain reasons which
admonysshed me there to because that the wepons that a man may beat down his
enemies with all ought not to be put in to their hands. For when one
enforces his enemy wytyngly, it is no marvel if he fall in his own
turn. Than take this little Antydocary in worth. And that howbeit it
co^teyneth but a little / if God lend me time and give me good fort^ne I shall
perforce me to make it hole complete. In the which shall be given doctrine and
artificial manner for to order after Rasis, Galyen, Albucrasis, and Auycen. And
this present treatise shall have four chapytres. The first shall be of the
local remedies of hot apostemes. The second of ye local remedies of
pustules. The third shall be local remedies of cold pustules. The.iiij. shall
be of the exitures Rubrica, of yt cures of hot apostemes. The cure of hot
apostemes have.^ij. intencyons. The first is to egal the matter an^^cedent. The
second to govern the matter con^uncte. And the third is to abate the
accydentes. As of the first and third I hold my peace / but of the second
whereby the matter conioynte is go^erned is fulfilled by repercussyon at the
beginning except in.x. cases / which I leave as now because of bryefnes,
and with repercutis and resolutis, and maduratis, in the encreasyng, and with
resolutis in ye estate, and with dessicatis in ye declynynge.

THe local remedies that fulfill thentencyon of ye beginning be of three
fourmes. The first is Epitheme de Auicena. R.succi solatri, succi super vine,
aque roses, acete an^..i.fiat epithema. The second form is a plaster of
Sandal. de auicena. R. farine ordei..i.sandalis rubei psidie, acacie, sumac
an^..ss. Epithema predicta quod sufficit fiat emplastrum. The third form is
cerot de.G.that Auycen aloweth / and is. R. Olei Ros..iiij. cere..i. fiat
vnguentum / and be it washed in cold water two or three times.

THe local remedies that accomplysshe thentencion of thencreasyng ben of.iij.
fourmes. The first is Epithina. R.vinum dulce. quart troy.i.aqua Ros. aceti
an^ quar. ss. croci..ij. infundantur per horam, et coleti^ / and make epitheme.
The second form is de volubili of Auycen / thus. R. maluarum. M.i. Ros.
abscinthij.an^.. s. farine ordei..i.olei camomille, aque fabrorum, quod
sufficit ad decoquendum, fiat emplastrum in seething it on the fire. The third
form is Cerot of Camomyll. R.olei camomille, olei ross, an^..ij. cere,.i,
fiat vnguentum.

THe local remedies that acco^plysshe thestate are of three fourmes, The first
is de paritaria of master Dinus, R, paritaria, malue, an^, M, i, camomille
aneti fenu greci, siminis lini an^, s, olei vini albi, aque fabrorum, as much
as suffiseth to seth it and make a plaster. The second form is diaqui^lon
common made thus. R. litargiri lib. s.olei co^munis quar.iij. mustilaginis,
altee, fenugreci an^ quar.ij. fiat emplastrum cum custodia litargiri. The
third form is basilicon triafamarcum de.G. made thus. R.cere, resine, picis,
spice, licij, olei an^.quod sussicit fiat vnguentum. And these two abouesayde
have such virtues than when they find matter ready to rypenesse they do
maturate / and to resolve, they resolve, And the remedies that accomplysshe
thentencyon of the declynacyon, be all things dissycatyues and consumynges of
the matter / and specially dyapalma is much praised, and is of, G, in
Cathegenis, and is made thus, R, auxungie porci veteris, lib, ij, olei antiqui,
lib, iij, litargiri, lib, ij, Coperose quart, s, fiat emplastrum cum spatula de
palma viridi, vel ^a^ne, vel iunipero, and apply it.

The second chapter of the local remedies of hot pustules.
THe cure of hot pustules accomplyssheth three entencyons / but the first two
be left. The third is which is egall, The matter antecedent has two
intencyons, and ye other is after, before the vlceracyon first ought to be
mynystred medicines that be cold, dyssycatyues, and infrigidatyues, with some
repercucyon. And herto is the plaster of solatra and farnia order are well
allowed / and it belongs to colerykes. But for certaynte unto sanguynes is
appropriate emplastrum of Arnoglossa / the form whereof is after, G, R,
Arnoglossa, M, i, lentisi quar, i, panis furfuris, quart, s, ros, aut gallaru^,
as the faculte of ye matter is,, s, and be put with smyth water (as master
pilgrym says, till it be thycke, And for the same is ye plaster of
pomogranato of Auycen proved and expert in the one and other regyment, the
form thereof is thus, R, pomorum granatorum, ij, seth them in veneygre or
water acetum put thereto. The gouernall accomplysshynge the entencyon after the
vlceracyon is to dry the rotte^nesse that is thycke and flesshy, blody, and
vyrulent / and after need to deffende the ambulacyon in the one and the other.
The rotte^nes dries with diverse dissycatyues and are made dyuersly after the
dyuersyte of the case to thacomplysshyng of the said entencyon in five forms,
of the which. The first is vnguentum apostolicorum / of Auycen called venera,
and of Hebemesue / and is called the oyntement of Sarrazeos that rectyfyeth the
evil vlceres and wou^des of ill consolydacyon and fystules, The form whereof
is, R, cere, resine, armoniaci, an^., xxiiij, litargiri,, viij, thuris, mirre,
galbani, bedellij, Aristologie an^,, v, floru^ eris, oppoponaci an^,, iij, olei

second form is vnguentum Egiptiaru^, and is put of Galyen and Albucrasis /
and is stronger, and well proved at Boleyn, where it is used, R, florum eris,,
iiij, alumi^s, ij, aceti,, s, melles,, ij, make an oyntement, and boil it on
the fire till it be thycke and read. The third form is vnguentum viride for
the same intencyon, but it is stronger, and therefore Auycen commands it in
the chapter of hestiomeno / because that in clensynge, it lets not the
vlcere to grow large, and is made thus, R, floru^ eris,, s, mellis,, ij, make
an ointment and stir it on the fire, The, iiij, form is trocisu^ aromatici
that are put of Auycen and of Galyen, and in falling makes crust, and opens
with cantere, R, vitrioli, calcanti alumis, an^,, s, corticis granatorum,, x,
gallarum,, v, aristologie, mirre, an^,, s, put all to powdre / and with sweet
wine be well trocysked. Also the trocyskes of Caldaron, that are called
Affrodillorum of master Roger / the form of them are, R, calcis vine partis,
i, arcenici rubei et ^^^rini alkali, an^, partis, s, let them be encorporate
^^^e of affrodylles et fiani trocisci / and when the ^^^st is very hard make
it ^al with butter, and Auycen cou^celeth to meddle a little sulp^ere with butter.
The ^yrulent dries and wastes with one of these, iij, dyssycatyues, that
folowen, Of the which the first (...) vnguentum litargiro, proved at all
exitures, (...), litargiri puluerizati vt alcofol,, ij, olei ros, lib, ^

deffendynge of the vlceracyon is and ambulacyon is made with read ointment,
made this wise. R.baliarminaci..ij.terre sigillate,.i. aceti modicu^, olei
rosarum quod sufficit, fiat vngue^tu^.

The third chapitre wherein are accomplysshed the local remedies of cold
apostemes.
IN the cure of cold apostemes be.iij intencyons. The first is to egall the
matter antecedent. The second is the conioynt matter. And ye third is to
correct ye accydentes / leave we the first. The second is to accomplysshe
with repercutyues in propres, and that is not often / and with stiptyke
resolutyues for the most part, and for common workmanshyp. But for asmoche
that the materes are dyuyded in to hardness and softnes, and resolve them by
right way of workynge, keeping the matter soft that it fall not in to rotte^nes
/ howebeit the soft matter has an only entencyon / that is to wit to resolve.
Therefore shall I say in the su^me of.xvij. Antydotes / that now are
belonging to the soft matter, and shortly to all cold matters, of the which
some resolve and some mollyfy, and some do both. Therefore the dylygent workman,
workyng the matter of cold apostemes ought to wit to which resolucyon is due /
and to which mollyfycacyon, and to which both. The first Antydote, or the
first form is Epythime of liriniu^ of ashes / and is of.G.Ras. and Auycen /
and competeth proprely in vdimia, and in apostemes mollyfyed, whereby it
appeaseth and resolves / of the which the matter is thus. R.lexinium cineru^,

The seventh is vnguentu^ vfifur good and expert to molyfy scrophules, and
co^peteth to all vlceres fraudulentes. R.litargiri, galbani an^,, v,

marcasite..s. mustilaginis, altee, fenugreci, seminis lini an^..ij.olei antiqui
q i.fiat emplastrum, ad modum dyaquylon.

The cure of the exitures.
THe cure of ye exitures has four intencions. The first is to ripe the
matter. The second after the maduracyon to open it. The third is to purge the
place. The fourth is to dry it after the opening and clensynge. The first
intencyon accomplyssheth four fourmes. The first form is tetrafarmacu^ of.
G. that makes it with meal of wheat, saffron, water, and oil. The second
form is a plaster of malowes yt is made thus. R.radicis maluanisti
quar.ij.farini fenugreci, se minis lini an^..i.auxungie porci..iiij.fiat
emplastru^. The third form is a plaster of Tebes, that is propre to our
form. R, ceparu^ coctaru^ su^ pr^nis, iiij, numero frumenti quar, i, farini
fe nugreci,, i, auxungie porci, ij, fiat emplastrum, The fourth form is
dyaquilon and basilicon, and to the same intencyon is dyaquilon magnum
abouesayde,

THe second intencyon is acco^plysshed by hot iron in vnsynewed places or by
blood suckers to such as be fearful, and by corosynes, in mean places ye
form whereof is dowble, The first form is a plaster of Galbanum that
opens the exitures of children, R, galbani,, i, fermenti,, s, stercoris
Columbi,, ij, mellis,, i, make your plaster and lay to it, The second form
is rupture that is made with lyme and soft soap, cum salina aliqualiter
pistata,

THe third intencyon is acco^plysshed by three mundyfycacyons, The first is of
honny that is made thus, R, farine ordei,, i, incorpor^ndo cum melle rosato,
fiat emplastru^, The second form is mundyfycatyfe with eggs, and is of
Auycen, R, vitellorum ouorum numero, iij, mellis,, i, fenugreci quod sufficit,
fiat emplastru^, The third is mundyfycatyse of Apio / and is propre to
^^ytures vnmadurate, because that in mundyfy^ng^ it madureth, and suffers not
to fystule, R, ^^cci apij,, iiij, melles optimi quar, i, farine frume^ti, i,
incorporentur in patella ad ignem et tunc fiat emplastrum.

THe fourth intencyon accomplyssheth by the oyntement of calcadum / and is
dyapalma (...) as Auycen says bathed with towe in vyney (...) as Galyen says
/ and is the same that abides (...) our dyscrecyon in the agregacyon of local
remedies of apostemes, after as I may compryse by mine understanding, the
manner to make it I do ^^aue to the wit of the workman, for I should be to
long / and it is to presuppose that he knows it,

Here follows the Formularie of the helps of wounds and sores, ordained in
Auygnon by master Guydon of Cayllyac / cyrurgyen and master in Physycke.
FOr doubt to forgete, and for the necessyte of mine own propre brother I
will show the remedies proprely localles whereby is healed the sores and
dyrupcyons, and solucyons of contynuynge, after the doctrine of Galyen, Auycen,
Rasis, and Albucrasis / and some masters that I have seen work, I intend to
form su^maryly, and abredge with the formulary of the apostemes and pustules
that I ordained of late at Paris, And because that, G, prince of Moges, in
tertio terapen, says that the cure of vlceres has two general intencyons,
That is to wit one taken in the essence of the disease / and the other for
certain to the nature of the membre / And therefore this present treaty shall
have two parties, In the first shall be the propre fourmes of the helps in all
simple wound or sore in asmoche as a wound is simple, In the second party
of wou^des composed,

The first Chapter of the cure of wounds simple,
AL simple wounds after ye entencyon of Galyen in the place alleged ben new
wounds in the parties of ye flesh, that only requires consolydacyons
wounds after the agreement of al^ workmen has four intencyons, The first is
to draw fro the wound yt ought to be drawn, The second to staunche the flux
of the blood, The third to the form of the wound, The fourth to dry it,
The first is to accomplysshe the wit of the workman in workyng, The second
accomplyssheth it by one of.viij, manners of blood staunchynge, after Galyen in
the fourth Canon, as by ^ood stytchynge, or by good byndyng, and by conuenable
dryeng, The aids to accomplysshe thyntencyon / that is to draw fro the wound
that is to be drawn (without the words of the Empe^ykes) be of three manners,
The first is a common instrument, (as is contained in ye great work, and ^ere
be named, viij,) that is to wit the tongues, The first is good red wine with
towe wet therein and wrong laid on the wound, The second is ^^^mentum rubium
common, that is such, R, tera ^^^tyne lote quar, i, pulueris rubei dicti
superius, (...), misceantur, and ley it on with towe, and a play^^^, for it
dries, encarneth, and conforteth.

The second Chapter of wound composed,
THe wounds composed after the intencion of Galyen aforesaid, be they yt have
sometime dysposycyons that require diverse intencyons for their healynge. And
although it be that the dysposycyons that make composycyons in wounds be
sundry / nevertheless because of breuyte I will put here but the comunes /

The fourth book of the Terapen^yke or Method curatyfe of Claude Galyen Prince
of Medycynes / wherein is syngulerly treated the cure of wou^des and sores.
Translated by me Robert Coplande. Anno. M. CCCCC.vlii. the.iiii, day of
February.
Philiatros the translatour in to French to the Reader gretynge.
Friend and dylygent reder, Quintylian in his first book of the Oratory
instytution recyteth how Philosophy and eloquence are conjoined by nature, and
united together by office and actyon. Nevertheless ye study of philosophy and
eloquence have been separate one from the other, such wise that the neclygence
of men has made that they seem to be sundry acts, and diverse scyences. And he
yeldeth the reason wherefore. For sith that the tongue and eloquence has begone
to give it to the practyke. I say lucratyue exercytatyon, and that men have
abused the goodness and graces of eloquence, they have forsaken and all holly
left the cure of virtues. And good manners, which is the very philosophy the
which of very propre n^^^^e ought to be co^iuncte with eloquence, in following
the sentence of Quintylian. I say likewise that the parties of the art of
Medycyne (yt is to wit dyetityke, pharmaceutyke, and cyrurgery) ben such wise
cowpled (...) connexed together that in nowyse they can not be separated one
fro the other without the do^mage and great detryment of all the medicynall
professyon. For the one is helped, made perfyte, and consumed by the other. In
such wise that the one ^^lteth, and stombleth without the other. How be (...)
now a days I wot not if it be by neclygence, or because of the lucratyfe
practyse, whereto the most part of Physicyens do study more than to the
Theoryke, which is none other thing but ye parfyte and entyer knowledge of
dyseases and tem^ere^s of mankind bodies, with the facultees and ^^^tues of
the medycynes, whereof the indycatyon ^^^^atyfe is taken) the said parties of
physyke is ^^parated. Of the which the first is abyden with ^^e^ that ye
vulgar people call Physyci^ns. The ^^^nde with the apotycaries, whereof they
have ye ^^^me of pharmacopoles. And the.iii. to the Cy^^rgyens. So that the
physycien (now) trusts ^^all or almoost to the apotycaries in the knowledge
of simple medicines the which are so necessary that they can not well compose,
nor well use the medycamentes sometime composed without ye same. And as touching
the Cyrurgery (which is but a manual occupatyon) the physytions esteem it a
thing to vile and unworthy of their professyon. And not only ye said manual
occupation the which Hipocrates and Galyen have not shamed to treat of and to
exercise, but also the Method to cure the vlceres and tumoures against nature,
has been left by them in such manner yt the Barbours and Cyrurgyens in these
days are more ^tudyous than many physytions. Which is the cause wherefore I
have traducte out of latin in to french this fourth book of the method of
Galien moved of the great and ardaunt desire that I have known among the said
Cyrurgiens to have knowledge of some things. Wherein I would desire gladly the
grekysshe tongue or the latin, because of the great pain taking in the
translation, and also because that every tongue has his properte in such wise
that many things can not be sowned in the french speech, so well as they be
written in the Greek or Latin, prayeng the good reader take this my present
writing in worth.

Here begins the.iiii. book of the Terapentyke, of claude Galyen prince of
Physycke.
VUe have said that there is a kind of disease, that is called solution of
co^tynuyte, which comes in to all parties of the body of mankind. Howbeit
it has not one name in them al. For solutyon of co^tynuyte in the flesshy
part is called vlcere, in the bone, fracture. The greeks call it catagma. In
ye synewe, conuulsion, the greeks call it, spasma. There be other kinds of
solutions of continuite, that the greeks call Apospasma, rhegma, and thlasma.
That is to wit thlasma in the ligament, Apospasma, and rhegma in the vessels
and muscles, because of any vyolent stroke or grievous fall, or any other great
mocyon. The solution of contynuyte called ecchymosis in greek comes most
often with concussyon and ruption. Sometime solution of co^tynuyte comes by
opera^yon of the oryfices o^ the vessels, in greek named Anostomosis. Also
(...) comes because that the greeks call it dyapede^^s. Other solutions of
con^ynuyte happens of e^oysion in greek called Anabrosis. But it is a
dysposytyon already meddled and composed with an other kind of disease that
consysteth in the quan^^te of the parties, as before has been showed, (...) we
have spoken of holowe vlceres which ^^^^ede of two causes, that is to wete of
excysyon ^^d of eroysion. It is notorious in what man^r ^^cysion comes. if
eroysion habounde inwardely ^^^s caused of catochimie. if outwardly it is done
^^^her by strong medycyne or by fire. It behooves ^hen as before is said to
take heed dylyge^tly and dysc^rne the simple dyseases fro the compounde. For to
a simple disease a simple healynge is due, And ^o a composed disease a healynge
vnsymple. Also we have said before what Method must be kept for to heal the
composed dyseases. Howbeit it is not enough to know the generalyte of the
said Method / but behooves to be exercyced in all the parties thereof, seeing
that in the same is need (by manner of speaking) of sundry partyculer Methodes,
because yt every kind of disease has his own Method. Than that which
rests of of the curatyon of vlceres must be performed in this book, taking
the beginning here. Every vlcere is ey^her simple and alone without other
dysposytyon or affectyon beginning with it, or precedent, or suvsegeme^t, or
it is with some other dysposycyon, or diverse / whereof some have not all only
excyted the said vlcere, but have augmented it. The other are without the
which the said vlcere may not be cured / and of them have we treated here
before. We shall treat in this present book the dysposycyons which augmenteth
the vlcere / in the which lies double council of curacyon / that is to wit,
either to take the said dysposycyons all holly out of the body / or to
surmou^t the inco^modite that abounds (...). The which thing may be easily
done / if the dysposycyon be little. But if it be great the vlcere may not
come to cycatryce until that remedy be put to the said disposycyon, whereby we
must dylygently consider what the said affeccyons and dysposycyons be / and
how many in nombre, in taking our beginning as is aforsaid. Every vlcere is
be it alone or with holownesse requires and demands that the flesh
subject be natural / and that there be nothing between the lyppes and
extremities that ought to be conglutynate / which ofte^tymes happens, so that
hear, a spyder threde, matter, oil, or such like thing lets the knyttyng.
And those things are as symptoms and accydentes of the said vlceres / which
if they be present may hinder and let the curacion, if they be not, they let
not / but the dysposycyon of the flesh subject is cause of that which
follows. For with the same flesh / and by the same the lyppes that were
asonder are closed and the holownesse filled. It beho^eth than that the said
flesh be kyndely, because that these two things may well and co^modyously
(...) made parfyte. Than shall it be kyndly if it keep it self temperatly / the
which thing is common to all other parties. Whereby it behooves that the
flesh subject be holly temperate / as well to close ^he viceres as to fill
them with ^lesshe / but is it ^^oughe of that? Must not the blood that
gathe^^^h to it be good also? and moderate in qua^tyte? (...) seems thi^ to be
true / for it lacks asmoch ^^t the corrupt blood be as wholesome for the
clo^^sge, and as to fulfill the flesh / as sometime it ^^keth erosion and
exulcere the body. And if it be (...) habundaunt in quantyte it engenders
exe^^ment in the sores / and as is aforesaid lets and hyndreth the curacyon.
And also there be three manners of vlceres dyffycyle for to be healed. The first
manner haboundeth by the vntemperaunce of the flesh subject. The second by
the vice and ill qualyte of the blood gatherynge to it. The third for the over
great measure and quantyte of the said blood. Ought not the dyuysyon to be made
thus? or otherwise / that is to wit the cause wherefore some vlceres are
stubburne and defycyle to be healed is for the mystemperaunce of ye flesh
vlcerate, or for the gatheryng of humors Yet again, the mystempered flesh
ought to be devised in two dyfferences. The first is when the subject flesh
is out of nature in an only qualyte. The second is when with the evil qualyte
it has tumor against nature. The flowyng of humors is dyuyded in two
dyfferences, that is to wit in the qualyte of gatherynge ye humors, and in
the quantyte. Sometime diverse of the said dysposytyons are meddled together, and
sometime all. But the Method for to cure the^ all together ought not to be
given but each one by it self. As if the intemperaunce of the flesh be dry
and fylthy moderate it with bathing, and wetynge in temperate water. But at
all and as many times that this remedy shall be used, the end of the bathing
and wetynge shall be forth with that the partycle becomes ruddy and rise in a
lump. Than sease yt bathing and moystynge. For if ye bath it any more ye
shall close the humor again that was losed out, And so ye shall profit
nothing. Like wise the moystynge faculte of medicines ought to be greater then
it is commanded in hole party if the flesh be more moist, than natural
habytude. Ye must have regard to the contrary, for the faculte of medicines
ought to be desyceatyfe, and in no wise to use any water. But if ye must wasshe
the sore take wine or posca, that is to say oxycraton, or the decoction of
some sharp herb. Likewise ye shall cool the pride of the flesh that is to
hot, and heat that which is to cold. Ye shall know such vntemperaunces
partly by the color, and partly by touching, and partly by feeling the
dyseased. For sometime they feale great heat in the party, sometime manifest
coldenes, and delight them in hot or cold medicines. And sometime appears
rednes, and sometime whytenesse. But it is an impertynent thing to this work
to dystynke these things. In the which work we show not the Method to
know the affectyons, ^ut for to heal them. In such wise that by one
consequence of words, we be come unto the said Method to know the
affectyons. Return we ^han to our purpose. If any parties are vlcera^^ with
swellynge against kind, first the swel^ynge must be cured, What ought to be
the cura^yon of all swellynge we shall say hereafter^ Pre^^ntly we shall treat
of which is co^uycte and common to the curatyons of unkind humors or
swellynges with the vlceres. if the lyppes of the vlceres are dyscoloured
only, or somewhat hardened, they must be cut unto hole flesh. But when such
dysposycyon or affection has to proceed further / there must be had
delyberacyon, to know if all the party dyscoloured and hardened unkindly ought
to be cut, or if it ought to be cured by long space of time. And without any
dowbte in such case it is necessary to know the pacyentes will. For some had
lever to be long in healynge than to suffer incysyon. And other are ready to
endure all things / so that they may be soon healed. Likewise here shall be
spoken of the curacyon of evil humors that gathers in the parts of ye sore
places, in as much, and because that it is an humor gnawynge about
succorosyfe. But in as much as it is a wicked humor or over encreasynge in
quantyte / the curing thereof shall be spoken of in his own place. Than when
the humors that gathers in the vlcerate parties is not very fer of, nor in
quantyte, nor qualyte, it behooves to dyuert and drive away, that is in
restreynyng and to cool the heat of the parties that are before the sore
place. Like manner ye must begin the lygature at the vlcerate party, in ledynge
it toward the hole party / as Hyppocrates wylleth in the fractour of bones.
Also that the salues that are laid to the said vlceres must be more vndryeng
than they that are laid to a syngle sore. And if the flux or re^nynge will not
stop with salues, seek the cause of the said fluxyon, and take it first away.
If the fluxyon come by weykenes and feebleness of the party that receives it, ye
said weykenes must be cured. And such curacyon also shall be propre for ye
vlcerate party. But if cause of the said fluxyon habou^de either by over much
blood, or fylthynesse of all the body, or of any of the superyour parties, ye
must first delay the said causes. The weykenes of the party for the which
gathers to much humor haboundeth holly of the intemperancy. And not all
together of intemperancy / whereof follows that the vlcerate flesh is only
intemperate / and not weyke and feeble. And sometime chances both the one and
other, that is, both intemperate and weyke. For ye great vntemperaunce is cause
of the weykenes of payned party. The which vntemperau^cy shall be cured (as it
is beforesayd) in coolynge the heat, moystynge the dryth, warmyng the cold,
and dryeng the moist. And if the place be to cold and moist together / in
warmyng and dryenge also together. And so of the other vntemperaunces in doing
away ever the qualyte that surmou^teth by his contrary qualyte. The reason is /
every thing that behaueth it well, and is according to nature / not only in
quycke ^hynges, or plants, but also in all other things, (...) moderate
(which the Greeks call symmetron) and without excess of all vycyous humors.
For ^he thing wherfro nothing can be taken, nor put ^o it, neither any party,
nor any qualyte, it is all parfytely moderate. Contraryly, the thing that must
be taken fro, or somewhat put to it, is not in a natural estate, whereto is not
possible to return, but in doing away the excess, and putting to it that
it lacks. In an other place we shall speak of the over much or lack of ye
parties / but when any qualyte is over excessyue, it is needful that the other
qualite contrary be overcome. And that the corrupcyon vntemperau^cy be delayed,
in restorynge the said qualyte that was overcome. For in colyng that which was
to hot, thou shall restore that which lacks / and dymynysshe that which
was to much haboundant. Thus it is necessary that the enracyon of the things
that are put fer fro their natural beynges, by some in temperacy be made by
things of contrary vertne. And thus the flesh / or any party thereof wherein
is fluxyon because of weykenes, ought to be cured in this manner. And when the
intemperau^cy is cured, heal the vlcere. Curing the temperau^cy as if it had
come without vlcere. By the which thing it is manifest that all such curacyon
is not propre to vlcere, but to intemperacy. Likewise if any corrupt fluxyon
happen in the vlcerate parties / as well by ye occasyon of any partycle as of
all the body whereto the blood or any ill humors do gather. First remedy must
be had, either to the party that is cause of ye fluxyon, or also to all the
body. Thus than we shall heal first the varyces that are often over the sore
place / because that anon after we may heal the soore. Likewise in them that
have disease in the mylte, or of any other notable party. First it behooves to
cure the said party / and than after we shall come to the curacyon of the sore
or vlcere / howbeit none of ye curacyons thereof is not propre unto an vlcere,
but to some other affection and dysposycyon, either that engenders vlcere, or
that nouryssheth and conserueth it. Now it is time to make an end that no
strange cause (or as it is now said) the first judicial is iudycatryce of
curacyon, but the curatyfe judicial affection and disease. But the things yt
ought to be done particulerly are found, either that the first judicial
shows either of the nature of the sore party, or of the temperau^ce of the
air / and of other like things. For to speak bryefly no indycacyon may be
taken of things that be not yet parmanent. But in as much as for to know a
disease that is not euydent by reason nor by wit, we are often constrained to
inquire of the externe and prymityfe cause. For this occasion the vulgar meneth
that the said prymytyfe cause is indycatyfe of curacyon, the which is all
other. As it appears clearly that may well and parfytly be known. For if
ecchymosis, or vlcere, or erisipclas, or putryfaction, or phlegmone be in any
part, it a superflue thing to inquire the effycyent cause of such ^yseases,
but if it be yet present and remaining. ^or in this matter we will heal that
which is done all ready / and should prohybyte the effycyent cause to proceed
any ferther. And if the said effycyent cause which has produced the effect
thereof has no longer being, we shall do away the said effect. For to do away
the cause that is no more / it should not be possible for us, when we would do
it away, because that the curacyon apperteyneth to the thing present, as
prouydence to the thing to come / but that which we fear not that it may hurt
neither for the present nor for the coming is out of both the offices of ye
art, that is to wit, of curacyon and of prouydence. Wherefore in such a thing
ought to be no serchyng of any judicial, neither to cure nor to puruey, but (as
said is) the knowledge of the prymytyfe and externe cause only vtyle in the
dyseases to us unknown. Nevertheless the Empirykes take sometime the prymytyfe
cause as party of all the course of the disease (that is called in Greek
syndrome) wherein they have observed and experyme^ted the curacyon / as in them
that have been hurt with a mad dog, or venymous beasts. Thus does also some
Dogmatystes / which do affirm to heal such dyseases by experyence only
without racyonall indicion / for they inquire the cause prymytyfe as party of
all the syndrome, and universal course. But the prymytyfe cause serves
nothing to the indicion of curing, although it be vtyle to the knowledge of
the disease, to them that have known the nature of venymous beasts by use and
experience, and thereof takes curatyfe indicion. For put the case that I know
that the venyme of a Scorpyon be of a cold nature. And for that cause as of a
cold thing that I take indicacion of the remedy, howbeit the case is such
that I have no sign whereby I do understand that the body is hurt of a
scorpyon. It is manifest if that I know that ye said body is hurt with a
scorpion that I would enforce me to warm all the body / and also the party
stynged without abydyng for any other experyence in taking mine indicion of
the nature of the thing. For like as we have showed in the book of
medycamentes / wherein it behooves to be exercyted who soever will take any
fruit of these present commentaries. No such faculte can be found with out
experyence. Sothely it should be a gift of fely ^yte so that any having the
sight of Litargiri, of Castoreum, or Cantiride forthwith to understand their
virtues. But likewise as in all things is committed error, as well by
excess, as by lack, so is it presently. For if they that afferme that the
virtues of medicamentes is not yet known / and that after so great
experyence. And the other yt esteem the said virtues to be known by one
experyence ^lone, do gaynsay each other. For the first speak ^^er lightly and
to i^prudently, if it be i^prudence to afferme a thing impossyble, and the
other are all together stupydes, sturdy, and lytygious. But for this present
time we will say no more, because I have spoken more plainly in ye third book
of temperamentes / and also in the book of medycamentes. Nevertheless for
knowledge of ye diseases some prymytyfe causes are proffytable / but after yt
the present disease is all together known / than the cause prymytyfe is
totally vnutyle. Now have we abouesayd / that it behooves not to meddle and
confound both the doctrynes together / but the emperyke ought to treat by it
self / and the rational also by it self. We must now call to mind
(because we have preposed in these present co^mentaryes) to treat all only
the doctrine rational. Albeit that to some things that we say we do not add
that them all and absolutely be not true, but only after the sentence of the
Methodyke sect / howbeit every one of himself ought to reason it, and for to
add it. And at this present time we have added that any cause externe and
prymytyfe is profitable to the indicacion curatyfe / albeit that it serves
well to the knowledge of the disease. And we confess that the cause prymytyfe
is a party of the syndrome, and of all the emperykes course is that they cure
all dyseases, by reason or by experyence. But in all that we will say hereafter
it shall not be necessary to add such words. Than let us return to our
first purpose in taking the pryncyple certain and vndowbtfull / whereof also
we have used heretofore / there as we have said that the disease that
requires to be cured iugeth the end whereunto the Cyrurgien ought to entende /
and of the same all other indications ben taken / whereby ye may understand
pryncypally of the vlceres, whereof we have begone to speak, that the said
indication has no manner of societe with the cause prymytyfe. For put we the
case that any vlcere be come of a fluxyon in any party than it is manifest that
ye said vlcere proceeds of corrupt humors / for nature is wont for to do so
in dyseases / when she purges the body she sends all the corrupcyon to the
skin / in such a manner that the said skin is vlcerate / and all the body
purged. What is than the curacyon of such vlceres? Certainly as of other
vlceres wherein no corrupt affec^ion or dysposition (that the Greeks call
Cacoctes) is adjoined. And if it be so, it is euydent yt none indication is
taken of the cause that has excited and made the vlcere. But if the vycyous
humor remained some indication might be taken of the said cause / or otherwise
it should be a deaf thing that yt thing which is no more being should
require curacyon^ Or if any thing judged and showed curacyon / where there no
manner of ^^de. Wherefore it is a strange thing / and all ho^e against reason
to say that the indication cura^^fe ought to be taken of the cause externe and
prymy^yfe. And for because that the said indication (...) not taken of the
same cause / it is euydent that (...) ought to be taken of the cause that is
present. But what is such indication fyna^y? Certainly who that should well and
pr^prely speak / it is that thing that belongs to providence, who so would
be abused with the vocable. The greeks call it Prophylactice. For ye curation of
vlceres either being only syngle vlceres, or being with holownesse (if ye
esteem and consydre dylygently) is parfyte in eschewynge and foreseyng the
things that may anoy nature. And the su^me in effect when all is done, it is
the work of nature, as is closing of a sore vlcere / and regeneracyon of
flesh. In the which things belongs all the cure to that part of the art
medycynall / that is called Prophylactyce in Greek / yt is to say prouydence /
although that vulgaryly it hight, healynge. And therefore this party that is
named prouydence is divided in to two kinds. The first is it that does a way
the disease that is present. And the other with stands the disease that is not
yet in estate. Thus the young leaches understand not that their contencyon and
dysputynges is of names. Howebeit that if they were studyous of things / they
should invent and know that there be two first dyfferences of the functions
and actions of medycyne. That is to wit, either to cure and heal the dyseases
all ready grievous / or to let and withsta^de them that are not yet present. Than
is there no man but he will say that to cure and to heal is none other thing
/ but to do away the diseases all ready present and grievous / be it but that is
done in doing away the things that do let the work of nature, or by
medycamentes. But prouydence is none other thing but to let that the said
dyseases come not. And certainly they that by reason and Method admynyster the
art of medycyne do cure y^ vlceres that come before of corrupt humors / in
purgynge the said humors / and also in doing away the things that lets
the work of nature. And proprely to say these two manners of curyng ar called
Prophilactykes in Greek. For they let (as is aforesaid) that the fylthynes
engenders not at the sore / or over much moist corruption. It behooves not
than thus miserably to strive of the names. But rather it is more conuenyent to
give some good Method to cure the vlceres, such as I have given (after my
judgment) as well in the book precedent as in this. But I merueyle me much of
the ^ole hardynes of Thessalus writing so of the curacyon of vlceres, that is
named Cacocthe that is to say wicked. The co^muny^^es of vlceres that last
long time that are incurable / or that return after the cycatryce induct ben
very necessary, in likewise as in vlceres that may not grow together and be
closed. It must be esteemed what is the cause that lets and pro^^^yteth the
said cleuyng, or growyng together / (...) which cause ought to be done away.
But in them that renew ye cycatryce induct / it behooves ^o keep ye said
cycatryce, that is to wit in strength (...) confortynge the suffrynge membre /
or all the ^ody in common / and in ordrynge it that it endure ^at lightly, by
the remedies appropryate thereto. And after that Thessalus has proposed such
words in the beginning of his book of Cyrur^ery, he writes afterward more
plainly of this matter, in this wise. The vlceres that endure long, and that
may not be healed, or that renew and come again after the cycatryce, give
such indications. That is to wit / in them come not to cycatryce, it behooves
the lettynges of the union and coalescence / and renew the vlcerate place. And
after that ye have made it like unto a fresshe wound / it must be healed
again as a bledynge vlcere. And if the said cure profit in nothing, ye ought
to mytygate thynfla^mation / and make all other dylygence. But the vlceres that
come to closing and open again in ye acts and outward sores / ye ought to
heal them, like unto the^ where there is fresshe brennynge. And afterward ye
ought to lay upon the said vlceres a plaster made of mytygant things, until
that the ire and fyersnesse be abated. After this done ye ought to help to
dress the cycatryce. And than that ye make the parties about it wax read /
in wrappyng it about with a malagme (that is to wit a salve malactyke) the
which is made of Mustarde / or with some other medycament that may change the
said parties, and make them to be the less subject to disease. And if they
ceas not i^ this manner / ye ought to have cure of all the body / in strengthyng
it with diverse exercytacyons, iestynges, and vociferacions, in co^myttynge them
that keep him to such things. Also by manner of living, dymynuyng, or
augmentyng by degrees / in beginning at vomytynge made by Rayfortz. Ye shall
also use white Elebore, and all other things, whereof we use in dysseases and
dyffycyle to do away that are subject to reason and manner of living / behold
here the saying of Thessalus. Now we must esteem the stupydyte or audacyte of
the man. I say the stupidite if he think to say well / and the boldness if he
fool him self culpable to say nothing. And by this means hops to abuse
and deceive the readers. But tell me Thessalus / what is the indicacyon
curatyfe taken of old sores? In good soth I never found curation that was
indicate and showed of the old vlceres, nor of new, nor also of the time in
what disease that it be / but of the affection and dysposycion that I have
purposed to heal. For totally if we regard time / as if the indycacyon
cura^^fe were taken of it, the second day we should give all other indication
than the third. And likewise to give the.iiij. day another, than the.v. and so
of the.vj. and all other days following. And by ^he mean we shall no more
consydre the dyseases that we cure. And the indication shall no more be ^^ken
of them / whereby we could never think a ^^^aunger reason. How than are the
co^munytees (...) vlceres necessary that endure a great while, se^^g that ye
time of it self can indicate in nothyn^^^ For when one vlcere is with erosyon,
that co^^eth of evil humors / we shall not take for that ^he months after
another indication, but that which we have taken at the very beginning, and for
a troth I will not parmit that such an vlcere should abide long time / but at
the first I would take the cause thereof away. For it is leful ye most often
to knowledge the disease at the beginning, and it is necessary that the
indication be taken of the said disease. But I can not coniect what may show
and ensygne the time more than the nombre of days, but that Thessalus will
say that to have knowledge of such vlceres / we must tarry the time / but in
such a manner he should be an ydyot all together. That is to wit, if he confess
openly that of other thing the indication curatyfe is taken / and of other the
knowledge of the disease. For although that the time serves somewhat to yt
disease / nevertheless the indication curatyfe is not taken of the time. But
whereof serves it if any vlcere be inueterate, to do away that which lets
the coition and coalescence, and to renew the place that is payned? For a man
inepte if by a fylthy fluxyon (that the Greeks call cacoethe) the lyppes are
disposed in such or such manner / what shall thou proffyte if thou cut it before
thou have provided to stop ye fluxyon? That is to wit / thou shall make the
vlcere wyder than it is / as some do that cure vlceres in the same manner /
because that as long as the cause lasts that before made the vlceres hard
and flynty. Other thing shall not come of thexcysyon of the said vlceres but
amplyfycacion. For them that thou cuttest shall be again as hard and stony as
they were before, albeit that the prudent and wise Thessalus (God knows) has
not added this word, that is to wit, that the party of the vlcere that is
stony and hard and vncoloured ought to be cut, but commands by absolute
sentence and diffynytife, that we ought to cut that which lets the closing
of the vlcere, and renew it, if he counceled to do away ye causes that let and
hyndre the agglutynacyon. And that this reason and manner were antyke I would not
excuse him. For it is a precept and commandment almost of all the ancient
masters / which have written by any reason and Method of the cure of vlceres
that it behooves to do away the effycyent causes of the said vlceres, like as
of al other sores, ^or to say that in vlceres the cause effycyent must (...)
first done away, and not in other diseases, it were of no purpose. But totally
in all dyseases wherein the effycyent cause remains still, it behooves to
begin the curacyon at the same cause. And if the ^ayd Thessalus has left to
tell all the causes that let the coition and conglutination, and that he has
^nely spoken of the labyes (as he has showed af^^^warde) it appears that he
ignoreth, more than (...) knows not what belongs to the curacyon (...)
vlceres. For it is possible that the same cause (...) alone, wherefore the
vlcere may not be cured, as (...) said the intemperancy that is in the vlcerate
^^^tyes, without any tumor against nature may (...) the cause. It is also
possible that the said intemperancy be coniunct with tumor, the which
natwithstandyng requires not al together that the labyes should be cut. It may
so be that varix / that is to say a swolle^ vain that is above it may be the
cause, or that the mylte is augmented, or some disease of the liver, or the
weykenes of the party grieved, the which is none other thing but a clear and
notable vntemperatnes, or evil and vycyous humor in all the body that the
Greeks call Cacochynne. The which is the greatest cause of all them that may
vnproffyte and anoye in the vlceres. As much also may grieve the vlceres the
superhaboundaunce of humors egal to the same that the Greeks call Phethora. If
Thessalus command to do away every of these causes above said, I allow him,
as he that consents and is conformed to the auncyentes. But also if he be not
of the opinion that only the labyes should be done away, I say that of many
things he has known one alone, which is so euydent that the shepeherdes are
not ygnoraunt thereof. For if a shepeherde saw the labies of a sore, hard,
flynty, wan, and black, or of any other notable vice of color, he would have
no dowbte for to cut it. Than for to cut is a ready and easy thing / but for to
heal by medycamentes is a greater thing / and that requires workemanshyp.
Nevertheless Thessalus never knew what the labyes are that may be softened by
medicamentes. For all confess that he has swerued from this party of the
art. And thus (as him self shows) it seems that he had never experyence
nor rational science of any medicame^tes, which is a manifest thing of the
book that he has made of medycamentes. But to the process of this work we
shall treat of the passages which he has not written well.

ANd now we will dyspose us with delyberacyon to speak of the curacyon of
inueterate vlceres, the which he has treated in saying aforesaid. Certainly
it had been better to have called them Cacoethe, that is to say wicked, and not
inneterate, and than declare their nature, and expos^ the cause of their
generacyon, and curacyon of each of them. That is to wit, first the common
cu^acion of al vlceres, in asmoche as they be vlceres, ^^e which I have written
in the third book next after the partyculer and propre curacyon of each of
them, after the kind of the effycyent cause, as I have taught in this present
book. And howbeit ^^at Thessalus has done nothing of all these ^^^nges, yet
he estemeth yt the vlcerate place must ^^^^^ewed. Than when yt it is made as a
fresshe ^^^^nde, to heal it as a blody and raw vlcere, what (...) / if he be
exercysed in the works of the art (...) understands not euydently that
such do^^^ has been written by him that never healed (...) Is it possible that
any may heal a inue^^^^e vlcere as it that is cruent and full of blood, (...)
y^ he has made it like a fresshe wound? shall (...) in drawyng the labyes of
the vlcere together by rolls, or ioynynge them by stytches, or sooner neither
by the one nor the other / but by medycament apt and conuenable in vlceres
cruent and blody with lygature? What is he that knows not that an vlcere
Cacoethes is caued, seeing that it is made by erosyon? Is it possible than (O
fool and imprudent Thessalus) that an vlcere caued may grow together and be
agglutynate before that the cauyte be replete with flesh? Is not that to cure
an vlcere as a grene wound? Than have thou written in vain / that ye
indicacyon to cure caued vlceres is not closyng, but fyllynge. And howbeit that
every vlcere Cacoethes and wicked were not caued of it self and of the own
nature / nevertheless when it is made as cruent in cuttynge the labyes (as thou
co^maundest) necessaryly it is made caued / and acquyreth right great dystaunce
of labyes / in such manner that I can not se how thou may conglutyue it and
make close as that which is cruent. For if thou assay to approach them by
force and vyolence, the labyes that are fer asonder, is of necessyte that there
come a phlegmon / and also the said labyes may not mete and close together,
which as me seems is only to be under stand of Thessalus. Than afterward he
adds these words / if the vlceres be not bound yt thou mytygate the
phlegmon. For it is necessary that they be not vynculate / but because that the
same also be given to Thessalus, and that we pass over without so curyous
examynacyon. It is euydent to every one that he follows not the co^munyte that
him self has given. For if we take y^ which let^^th we shall take no more any
thing of the co^munyte of inueterate vlceres, in asmoche as they be such.
Natwithstandynge this, put we the case that it be so, and let us se what
follows. Thessalus writes in this manner. The vlceres that come to cycatryce,
and open again shall be healed in the acceys and vlceracyon / in such manner
as they that lately have be vexed and grieved by phlegmon. Than after he says /
ye must cause readnes to come to ye parties that are about it by a plaster,
that is to say reuollytyfe, which is made of mustarde sede. What say thou
made fool? if the fluxyon be bitter and hot, must the party be made read with
mustarde sede? In such wise yt that which the said party ought to have of the
fluxion ^t shall obtain forthwith by thy salve? That is, that it be all
vlcerate and read. For the auncyen^^^ made the weykenesses of ye parties that
was ^^me of cold, or habundau^ce of humor without ^anyfest heat in making
read them. But thou (...) rubryfycacyon in all sores. First without ma^^^^ any
dyfference, if the vlcere be not cured ey^^^ by the weykenes of the party, or
by the ma^^^ of the fluxyon, and than thou tournest the order. (...) after that
thou have brent ye party by mustar^^^^^, and have proffyted in nothing, than
thou (...) to the curacyon of all the body. Howebeit ^^^t after my judgment,
all the countries be ordained and stablysshed in such things, as well by reason
as by experyence. That is to wit that all the body be first emptyed of
supfluytees, or that any dare admynyster any bitter or hot medytament to the
party. For all those medycamentes draw unto them from all the body like unto
the cucurbitule, that is to say ventose or boxyng. And thus if thou do not
empty first all the body thou shall leave matter of fluxyon to the bitter
medycament / which thing the emperyke confess / and so do the dogmatistes,
and the most ancient doctors have esteemed it so. For in as much as Thessalus
has made mencyon of them, it shall be no strange thing to cite and allege
them as witnesses. That is not leafull to heal the eye well before all the
rest of the head, nor the head before all the body. Such was y^ sentence of
Arystotyll and Plato in the curacyon of dyseases. Likewise of Hypocrates,
Dyocles, Praxagoras, and Plistonicus / but Thessalus alone gaynsayth this
opinion / and comes first to the composycyon of mustarde / and than he has
sollycytude of all the body / without showing any thing wisely. For as if it
were lefull after to have ones purged all the body / forthwith to feed it with
wholesome and good meats, of vocyferacyons, and exercytacyons, and of iestynges
/ and of the manner of change of living / by certain cyrcuytes and acts.
Than of the vomytes made by Rayffortz / and for su^me and conclusyon he has
ordained the elebora. It is him self that has promised to heal al diseases
easily, but I can not understand how that any has so well healed, either in
more longer space of time, or by more unprofitable labor. Now than like as we
have seen by usage and experyence / put we the case that there be any to whom
it behooves to cure an vlcere malygne and Cacoethes / put we the case also that
there is any other that is in health / but because he has scratched himself in
any party, as on the arm, and suddenly is risen a blyster or pustule. Than
wtin a while after there comes an ytche to the party / and after the pustule
is broken there comes an vlcere dyscoloured with fre^yng vnegally / and that
such things is come in. iiii. days fro the beginning. To this purpose let the
master Thessalyen answer me / in what ma^^r it behooves to heal such an
vlcere. I call it ^ntyerly malygne and cacoethes. And therefore forth ^^th I
will consider what is the disposycyon and ^^fe^^ion of all the body. For I will
invent of what ^^^de the humor superflue shall be; as well by the ^^mptomes of
ye vlcere / as by the signs of all the (...). Than forthwith I will purge the
said su^^^^^e humor / without taryeng yt all y^ elbow of y^ ^^^ent get any
disease / stoburne and waywarde to ^^^^yon. But the sectatours of Thessalus /
that (...) wit they that observe his precepts will tarry (...) vlcere be old,
because it may return to (...) wondrous, and merueylous co^munyte of
in^^^^rate vlceres, as if it were not much better to ^howe the co^munyte of
contumace and waywarde vlceres / the which would indyke the curacyon, and not of
the inueterate vlceres. Afterward y^ said Thessalye^s would do one of both /
either they would cut the vlcere and make it as it were fresshe, and approach
the parties as for to knyt them, or else they would first use of the salve
that is made of mustarde. And all that proffite not, they will have their refuge
to vocyferacyons, and gestacyons, and other exercytacyons, and to the manner of
living that changes by cyrcuytes / and after they will move vomytynge by
rayffert / and if the vlcere be not cured by such things they mynystre
elebore called veratra^ in latin. And if the elebore serve of nothing / they
send the pacyent in to Lybie for the change of air, undoubtedly Thessalus
ought to add this word. After this excellent and synguler curacyon of
froward and rebel vlceres. For of troth the Thessalyens stay in
vocyferacyons, gestacy^ns, and other like things, as if they should cover the
evil habytude of the body (which the Greeks call Cachexte) and not the vice
of the humor (that the Greeks call Cacochymie) Is it not merueyle if they
confess not to know the vlcere Cacoethes as soon as it is made / and that
they tarry till it be old? And that often they use cyca^ryce / and open many
times or they understand what to do? seeing also that they counceyll them that
have the fevers in what manner soever it be / to pass the excess that ought to
come the third day or no? God knows how they have well and parfytly known
the contemplacyon of the Cryse, and in what manner they may fore ^e the great
encreasynge of the sore. What comes thereof most often? Of a certaynte it
comes that the pacyentes abides in their beds / and consume through their
defaulte / which might have been healed the second day. Of a truth not ones,
or twyes, or thryes alonely, but.vj.C. times have we washed many febricitans
incontinent after y^ first acts, which we have seen done by our preceptours
and masters. And consequently have permytted them to live without fear in
their manner accustomed, as they that should no more have the fever, whom wise
Thessalus that has exigited ye first dyete, that is to wit not to eat in
three days should have dried up and consumed in making them sterue for hungre in
three days long. Than as I coniect he would feed them a little on the fourth
day / and ^o nourysshe them by little and little / in such wise that the.vj.
or.vij. day they should scantly be able to (...) about their customable
besynes, they that ne^^^ had the fever but ones only. Of troth he co^^^med
his pacyentes always in their dyseases / the ^^^iche right easily might have been
helped. For (...) so were that the vlcere began to swell at ye be^^^nyng, it
might have been helped in few days, ^hessalus would suffer it to re^ne a year
or more. (...) tarried often so long till the said vlcere often ^^^e produced
cycatryce / and would often open it to wit if it were contumaced. Than after
that he had begone ye curacyon he purges not forthwith the body, but first of
all used his salve of mustarde, and than his Iestes, vocyferacyon, and certain
manners of living, and than his vomyte of rayffort. And fynably of the Elebore
what it is? any other thing than to lyngre a hole year? That is to wit (by the
living god) when the pacient may be healed in.vj. days or in.vij. at the most
/ should we prolonge a month to know if the vlcere be Cacoethes and wicked /
and than that we should begin the curacyon? But what necessyte was it to speak
of the propre co^munyte of vlceres iueterate, seeing that they are mutyle in
the curacyon / albe it that it were lefull to write, not of the co^munyte
indicatryce, but of the curacyon of vlceres, not inueterate, but contumaced and
rebel. For it happens that some vlceres and diseases are contumacy and
rebellyon to heal. Howbeit indicacyon curatyfe is not taken of this contumacy
and rebellyon. But it is the disease that gives the first indicacyon of
healyng. And of the said first indycacyon are found the remedies as I have
declared. That is the manner to heal by Method, as that we do in following the
auncyentes, if it so be that Method is an universal way, which is coming to
all partytuler things. Here is Thessalus be gyled, for he weueth that all y^
knowledge of them that do any thing by Method, is Method / surely it behooves
that he that does any thing by Method have notyce and knowledge of the like
and unlike. Nevertheless that is not Method / that is ^o wit the said notyce
of like and unlike. Also Arystotyll and Platon affermeth it not / which
Thessalus dare falsely allege. But at this time is not conuenyent to reffute
and reprove such purposes / wherefore I will return again unto the Method
curatyfe, promyttyng to show that there is a pryncyple of Method in all
curacions, and that the way that ledeth fro this pryncyple to the end is
semblable in all partyculer things, where by (albeit that in all dyseases it
seems that there is one propre and pryue Method to heal) nevertheless in
all things there is one co^myn gendre / for it behooves always to begin at
the indycacyon that is taken of the disease that we entende to heal. And than
we must esteem and dyscerne if the cause of the disease be ceased a ready, or
yet presently it augmenteth and makes the said disease. If the said cause be
already ceased, we must come so ye Method whereof has been treated in ye third
book of this work. But if the said cause yet presently make the disease, the
Method is treated in the.iiij. book. By the which Method thou shall find
the remedies of a phlegmon and of a ^euer, and shortly to speak of all
maladyes. That ^s to wit, if nothing is done, thou shall not take ^ayne to
inquire the precedent causes / but shall begin only at the disease. But if any
thing be done presently thou shall prepose two fynalytees of curacyon. And
than do the other things by order, as it is said. Now it behooves to merueyl
of Thessalus dyscyples / not for because they fail in such things, but
because they do use these names, Dyspathies, Metasyncrises, Imbecyllitees,
^yrmytudes, and sundry other such names. And if ye questyon them what such
names mean / they wot not what to answer. For to know what it sygnyfyeth
that they call in all inueterate vlceres Metasyncrynien ten exu in Greek / they
answer not with one accord, nor clearly, nor prudently, if that it were an
ancient name, or usurped by any of the Greeks, at adventure we might
understand of that they have written, what thing it sygnyfyeth. But because it
is a propre name unto their stupydite, that is to wit, that is come of the
supposycyon and Hypothese of Asclepiades like as their other decrees, is it not
then just and reasonable that they iustyfy their dreams? That is to wit, from
whens this that is said Syncrinestai ta somata ^ai diacrinestai. As ye would
said meddle and dyuyde the body. And that it were only leafull to usurp such
names, to them that call and constytute the little body Atoms, and the poores,
and conduytes or the indiuidnes, and vacuyte. And fynably the impatable and
inalterable things to be the first elements. As that for certain they
usurp and contynually use such manners. Moreover Thessalus in his Canon when he
confermeth the pryncyples renews some thing beside that which was put in
writing by Themyson and Asclepiades / and ensigneth clearly what he will say,
for he has not esteemed all together as As^^epiades. That is to wit even in
such wise as in Symmetrye, that is to say, that in competent and co^moderacyon
of small conduites lies and consists the health. And in Ametrie, that is to
say / in vncompetence and immoderacyon in them the disease. Also that curacyon
or sanacyon is none other thing but a return to the first symmetrye or
co^moderacyon of the said conduytes / but he weneth that all the state and
condition of the said conduytes must be changed. And of this opinion is
proceeded ye name of Metasyncresis, which may sygnyfy as much as Metaporopoesis
in Greek. That is to say, mutacyon of the state of pores and small conduytes.
Howbeit it was not leful for him to use the name of Dogmatystes, in places
where he commands to eschew the uncertain and dark names and only have
the understanding attentyfe in the co^munytees which appear euydently. Than
his dyscyples and servants answer that he must not be herd as a dogmatyke /
when he uses of these names, Mais alephos, that is to say, symply. For of a
troth some of his dyscyples are accustomed to sustain and defend him in this
manner / in reuokynge us again to another name, that is Arphi^^a, which we
translate, symplenes. The which name (of a troth) I can understand what it
sygnyfyeth. For if he did send us again to a name more vain (that is in
Greek vioticos) the which they expose does signyfy as much as semblably to the
vulgar of men. Truly as much should it be to say Aphelos not duly nor
ryghtwysly / but without art or science. For the men that are the most
lyghtest and quycke of speech use names of arts and sciences, under some sense
that has no foundacyon. And when they are demanded what they mean, they can
neither tell nor show. The which thing th^se Thessalyens confess to be their
decent custom, the which thing we do object them, and for certain they will
also confess that they understand not partfytly and exactly what is
Metasyncrysis, if it be said of ye mutacyon of poores, that in Greek is called
Poropoia, in deed it should have some understanding, and sygnyfy somewhat, but
vain in many manners, because that our bodies are not composed of corpules
motes / nor of poores. And if they were true, yet should it not be possible to
show in what manner Mustarde might change or alter the state and condycyon of
the poores. And if any can show it, yet should he not be consenting and
confermed to their sect, seeing that they say, to be content with the apparent
co^munitees, whereby that they use no more such names, and that they hyndre and
let us no more, for it is leaful without the name of Metasyncrysis, to say in
other words the curacyon of froward vlcere^, as the Emperykes do. Also we have
showed in the second book, how the said Thessalyens ar^ likewise abuse at
the vocable Atonias, that is to say, Imbecilite, for they take the name as the
emperykes, for it sygnyfyeth none other thing, but that the actions is not
kept. But if they propose that there is any facultees and virtues that
governs man, which we afferme, and almost all the auncyentes, besides that
they gaynsay to the precepts of Asclepiades, they propose uncertain things,
of the which the Auctours agree not well together / howebeit they command to
fly such things. But tell me Thessale clearly, what bet^keneth this vocable
Metasycresem? if thou say that it betokens to change the poores and small
conduytes, thou begylest thy self, and vsurpest uncertain things / if thou
say that it is as much to say, as to yield the party of ye body steadfast and
hole, or all the man, thou say no more to this purpose than the Emperykes,
except the nowne. For they know well that man becomes hole by other
remedies, but they know not by what cause and reason the remedies restore
health. For none of the Emperyke can tell if the faculte of medycament changes
the poores / nor if it make symmetrie and co^moderacyon / nor if it alters
the qualyte of the pacyent party, howbeit the Emperykes are discrete if they
say yt they know only one thing, that is to wit, if they have noted and
observed often times, that vtylyte has followed when ye me^ycament of Mustarde
has be mynystred to such a sore, and in such time. Nevertheless they speak not
of Method, nor reyse their brows at it. And be not pleased with such notyce,
and myssaye not the auncyentes, nor dysprayse not Hyppocrates, not estemynge
him as nothing / but they allow him and afferme that he has said all
verytable things. But if Thessalus here that myspryseth Hypocrates, and all the
other masters, understands not that all the precepts that he has written of
the froward and rebel vlceres ben Emperykes. Albeit if he wrote them well and
co^modiously it should be somewhat profitable / but it appears not that he has
done so / seeing that he parnerted the order of remedies / and used remedies for
the party, or that all the body was prepared. In good soth it is a sign and
argument of an untaught and great ygnoraunce (seeing that in this thing almost
all the masters of medycyne do agree, albeit that in sundry things they jar)
that is to wit, that all the body must be emptyed and purged of all his out
waxynges, or that any party be take subject to the strong and vehement
remedies. For who soever would judge, either by experyence or by reason (for
there is none other third manner to judge, nor in what art soever it be, nor
in any party of life) he shall find yt it is a great inco^modyte to mynystre
to ye sore party any salve or plaster that is bitter and hot, or he provides
for all the body, which first requires his propre cure. For the said
medycame^t draws to it from all the body in ye manner as cucurbyte and ventose
does the excrementes and superfluytees. And so it cleueth and stycketh to the
said party grieved and sore, in such wise that with great pain it may be
scantly pulled of. Wherefore it must be asked of these Thessaly^ns, from wkens
ye said fantasy came to Thessalus to write fables and toys, as touching the
curacyon of froward and rebel vlceres, seeing that none Emperyke, nor
racyonall has so written before. Albeit neither Thessalus, nor any of his
dyscyples and sectatours dare not afferme that such ordres or remedies do agree
with expexye^ce or with reason. Moreover they can not show in what manner of time
indyke and not the disease, nor also (that is yet more) how Th^ssalus is not
all holly folysshe and dull, that judges that the cause must be esteemed yt
lets and kyndreth the cycatryce of vlceres, the which cause is to be done
away / and likewise sees not that it suffyseth, and that ye length of time of
vlceres s^rueth of nothing / with this he considers not that he must do
thus, not only in vlceres, but also in all other dyseases, as the auncyentes
do admonysshe. But they answer nothing to these purposes, but that they say
always, that we do not understand them well, as if they knew parfytely ye
thought of Hyppocrates, and of all the auncyentes. And afferme that Thessalus
has a good opinion when he says that there is a co^munyte of ye inueterate
vlceres, and that Hyppocrates understood it so in the book of vlceres, which
writes in this manner. It is profitable that the blood do flow contynually
from ye old sores, in what manner that it has been seen needful. At all
adventures than what may come to speak so^maryly of the sentence and
intelligence of Hyppocrates, though I have not promised that I would speak of
it in this place / but that which I will say shall be of the interpretacyon, of
the wit and knowledge of the auncyentes. The which as we have said as yet
has given no seet, but studyenge with simple and pure thought to invent some
thing profitable to health, it is well semynge that they have found some things
by use and some by reason. Than did they write their inuencyons many times
without gyuynge any reason to their inuencyons, and sometime they did, the which
they have done for cause of the profit of the readers. For they trusted to be
profitable to their successors, as to the good and right usage of invented
things to know the reason of their inuencyon) and have written it dyligently.
To the contrary, where they have esteemed that it should be superflue to
recyte, they have obmysed and left some. Now it is well known to all after
that I hold my peace, that the auncyentes have well loved shortness of speech,
and pryncypally for that cause. Not a lonely Hyppocrate, but also all the other
auncyentes. Sometime without making mencyon of the myddel most added the third
thing. For if the first thing be sign of the second, the third necessaryly
follows after the second. For this cause the first they put ye third,
obmyttyng and leauyng the second. I have showed sundry times how the
auncyentes and chyefly Hyppocrates have written such things. And he that will
know and parfytely understand the manner of interpretynge, that the auncyentes
had, ought to be exercysed in their style and manner of writing. For this time
I will expose only that which I have purposed / that is to wit the vlceres
the which (after well and duly to have done all things requysyte) although
they be not cured, the masters in medicines call them Cacoethe in greek, we
call the malygne or wicked, stoborne and rebel. Now have we spoken in the
book before what curacio^ of vlceres is. Tha^ these vlceres here all are called
Caroethe, inueterate, and dinturnes in using such names indyfferently.
Likewise for to know the disease Cacoethe is (that is to say waywarde,
stoborne or rebellyous for to heal) it makes somewhat with ye other signs,
neuerthe^esse the dyuturnyte, or that the said vlceres be cal^^d dyuturnes, of
long contynuaunce. And inue^^rate, as waxen old / and in deed ar^ such that
(...) manner of conuenyent indycacyon of curing / (...) it must be invented
because that the vlcerate ^arty is ill ordered and paynfull. That invented, ^he
manner of curing is euydent. But thou must ^^ye, how so? Of a troth if thou
heal the vlce^ate parties, provided that they only are payned, but if all the
body habounde in vycyous, and corrupt humor. In emptyenge and clensynge the
said humor / for truly the sign of the vycyous humor is the dyuturnyte of
the vlcere, but ye inuencyon of that which is vtyle and expedyent comes not
first of the dyuturnyte, but of the malice of the humor / whereby these three
things follow each other by order. That is ye sign, thaffection, and the
curacyon. The sign is the dyuturnyte, thaffection is the vice of the humor,
and the curacyon is the euacuacyon of the said humor / by this mean ye shall
find that the auncyentes many times after the first anon make mencyon of the
third, leuyng the myddylmoste. As Hyppocrates did when he said it is vtyle to
cause the blow flow often out of vlceres inueterate in what manner that it be,
so that the thing be seen behouefull not that the dyuturnyte indyketh the
curacyon / but the vice of the blood. For a little after he says thus. The vice
of the blood hyndereth greatly the healyng of the said vlceres. Also
putrefaction of blood / and all thing that is come by transmutacyon of blood
lets all other vlceres for to heal. Anon after when he speaks of vlceres
that come not to festring he says this wise. The vlceres may not be closed
together if the lyppes and parties that are round about it become swarte or
black, because of the rotten blood, or varyce (that is to say a tumyde vain)
that causes the fluxion if ye heal not the said parties that be about it.
Afterward he writes of the cure of the varices. And furthermore he makes
mencyon of the purgacyon of all the body, as well in other wounds, as in them
where there is fear and danger of rotte^nesse (called in Greek spha celos)
and also in serpentz vlceres, and in all Eschirmenes, that is to say that are
eaten and read. And thus Hyppocrates is accustomed to name the vlceres that be
reed by any humor. And also when he speaks of them that ensues he says in
such words. In every vlcere where as chances to come Erysipclas / all the
body must b^ purged. And finally if ye read dylygently the book of vlceres, ye
shall fynd^ that he takes indicacyon of the disease always, as sometime of the
time, but that is to know the disease. And that it is so, ye may know it at
the beg^nnyng of the said book, which is such. It b^hou^th not to moist y^
vlceres, what so^uer they be, but with wy^e. Then tells he the cause saying.
For the dry vlcere is ye nerest of health, and the moist to ^orenes. Then anon
after he says / for ye vlcere (...) moys^e, but y^ is dry is hole, and
therefore in all the ^^^e, in asmoch as he has constitued y^ end of al ^^e
^ure of vlceres to be dryness / forth with he has ^^u^de the particular thyng^
admonysshing us many ^ymes of ye said end / for when he writes in this manner.
Every vlcere yt is dyuyded with a cuttyng in^^^ument or sharp poynted receives
medycame^t ^is mynysire at ye beginning in blody and raw vl^^^^s, yt which
medycament in greek is called Enhameon, or otherwise a drying medicine yt
lets it to come to suppuracyon / for it becomes dryer because of the
fluxyon and shedynge of ye blood, and yet again Hyppocrates says. All vlceres
yt are purged i^ time behoueful, so yt they come always to more dryness, in the
most part of them come none o^ergrowynge nor superfluyte of flesh, but that
there is bruise, and again. If any vlcere may not cleue or grow together, the
moist flesh is the cause. In all these passages Hyppocrates admonyssheth us
of the first indicacyon curatyfe of vlceres. For of a very troth the curacyon
of an vlcere (if as) and being but vlcere is mean and moderate dryinge, whereof
the demonstracyon has been given in the book before, but the curacyon ^f an
vlcere yt is coniunct with another affection, whereof the cure ought to proceed,
is not like an vlcere alone, but the first curacion shall be of ye same
affection, and the second of ye vlcere. For if there be either phlegmon or
swart color, or ecchimosis, or erisipclas, or tumor, yt is called ^edema in
the vlcerate party, first ye must begin ye curacyon at one of the said
affections, howbeit every one knows well yt the vlcere sometime not only is
not well and co^modiously cured, but becomes much greater, for if in the
parties round about ye vlcere there is either bruise, phlegmon, or other
tumor, we must find the propre curacyon of the said affection, and have it
for a certain yt it is not possible to heal ye vlcere, if ye place where it
is be not cured first. And therefore Hyppocrates putting us in memory yt which
he had treated in ye beginning of his book to write al ye other things
comprised above, yt are ^se^t when he says. Every vlcere yt is dy^yded with a
cuttynge instrument, or sharp poynted receives medycament called Erhaemon and
dyssycatyfe that lets the vile matter. But if the flesh be contused or cut
remedy must be given, in such wise that it come soon to suppuracyon / for in
so doyng^ it shall be the less gr^ued with phlegmon. And al^o it is ^e^essary
that the flesh that has been contused, and incis^d, the which putryfyeth,
and comes to suppura^yon, in collyquieng and meltyng, and after that the new
flesh is engendered. By these w^rdes Hyppocrates shows manyfestly that al
d^seases of the vlcerate parties ought to be desic^^t^ except them that we will
suddenly bread pus, that is to say rotten matter / and passing forth ^e
teach^th us that pus or suppuracyo^ is made with ^ome pu^t^faction. Now all
things putrify by heat and moystnes / and therefore the Cathaplasm^s made of
barley meal (se^ng that they chaufe and moist) we shall m^nystre, to all
dyseases whe^^^t is expedyent to engendre pus. For the barley ^ea^e with water
and o^le, and likewise bread ^ith oil, or also a fomentacyon with much hot
water, and the strength of the salve called Tetra^^ne make, and finally all
things that warm and moist, forthwith engendre rotten matter or pus. And for
ye cause in ye parties where as phlegmon is, if there be all ready vehement
pulsacyon / in such wise that there is no more hope of the curac^on of the said
parties without suppuracyon all the auncyentes appl^ the said suppuratyfe
medycynes, and not sooner. The which thing Hyppocrates shows plainly in ye
words beforesaid, whereby he byddeth to dry much the wounded parties without
brusure. And they that be with brusyng, it behooves to bring them soon to
suppuracyon. Moreover when he says, that all vlceres that be not well and
duly purged, and begin always to bread and increase, in them the flesh over
grows greatly / but they that are purged as it behooves, and always comes
to drines, in them the flesh ouergroweth not, but if that there be contusyon.
Of troth to ^he purpose, when he adds, but if that there be contusyon, he
reduces us to mind of that he has said before. That is to w^t all vlceres
require for to be dried, but they where as is brusynge. For if ye do lay to the
parties where as is phlegmon, a Cataplasme that is hot and moist, it is not
done by the first and pryncypal reason. That is to say, as remedy to ye sore,
but asswagynge of the symptom and grefe. For the remedies of phlegmon ar of
dissicatyfe virtue. Harken now what Hyppocrates says. The playsters of
tumors called Cedemata, and phlegmons that consysteth round about, be
verbascu^ soden, and leaves of trifolium raw, and the leaves of Eperitron soden
pol^^m. All these medycamentes have virtue dissycatyfe, as we have showed in
the books of simple medicynes. And the su^me and short cure of the parties
where as phlegmon is, is done by the remedies that does away all ye hole
disease. Or if ye said remedies have left any thing remanyng yt comes to
matter, it is nedeful to have another medycament bitter and strong, yt may make
suppuracion. Or yt the skin yt is about it be thynne, and that you wylt not
yt the pacyent be sooner delivered o^ i^, ye must make incysyon / but of the
cure of phl^gmon by barley meal is sooner lenition than curacyon, and fyghteth
against the disease, and of ye dyfierence of such things we shall sp^ke
hereafter more at large. N^we me thinks to have manyfest^y showed how
Hyppocrates has commanded yt all vlceres ought to be dyssyccate, and that he
has ordained and confermed yt it is the end of the curacyon. In asmoche as the
indicacyon is taken of the disease, and not of the ty^e. And if any desire to
have greater persuasyon, let him red^ dylygently all the b^ke of Hyppocrates,
that he has written of vlceres. For he shall understand clearly that there is
one general indycyon of all vlceres, that is to wit yt which we have showed in
the precedent book. And also yt there is none indycacyon that is taken of time,
nor at vlceres, nor a^ p^legmon, nor at other greues. And therefore we are
common to the purpose and place to speak. It is a thing just and true to
show that Hippocrates has been inuentour, not only of that we have said
before, but also of all other things that is for to be known to him that
ought to hele an vlcere well. For it appears that he has invented the reason
and manner to heal the simple vlceres, and that are without other affection,
which lies and consists in dissiccacion^ But also partyculerly by the kinds
of every disease. For either the vycyous humors flow no more in the sore
party, or else it flows still. If it flow no more, it behooves only to
succor and remedy the party that is payned. That is to wit if it appear pale,
black, or read, it must be scarified and made to blede. Then afterward
(because that I may use his words) must be laid thereupon a sponge more dryer
then moist. I think that no person is ygnorau^t that this partycle (that is
to wit than) has in this place any strength of denial, as if he said thus
dry and not moist. And afterward ought to be applied remedies dyssyccatyues.
And than (if it be requisyte) for to draw blood again, and forth with after
make such things as is abouesayde, unto the time that the health be all
together gotten. And if the lyppes of the vlcere appear hard and stony, they
must be cut, whereof is spoken in this wise. If the vlcere that are cyrculer
and round be caued somewhat, it behooves to cut in manner of a cyrcle the
parties that are common in swellynge, which in Greek is called call apostema.
Either a hoole or half a cyrcle according to the length. Also it is written
of all tumors that are coniunct with an vlcere how it ought for to be cured,
Likewise of the varyces / for by the occasyon of them the vlcere is waywarde
and rebel to be healed, if that any humor of the said varyces do flow in
the vlcerate parties. In likewise when the fluxyon of humor comes from all
the body, he byddeth that all the body be purged without taking of any
indicacion of time. And for certain it should be a laughyng thing that so many
of diverse and often contraryes should be taken of a co^munyte. For put the case
that any indycyon of time be taken / yet finally it must be said what it is,
and compryse it in a su^me / as Thessalus does (not only we) which has always
an indycyon of the disease of the body that is stopped, that is to wit that it
be unloosed / and another unloosed of the body to be stopped. Likewise in the
vlceres, yt that is fylthy requires to be cleansed, that yt is caued to be
filled, that yt is egal to be festred. And that that ouergrowen f^esshe, that
it be had away, as Thessalus self is author. Let him show than that there is
a thing proporcyoned in the dyuturne and inueterate vlceres, as there is i^
all them aforesaid, which is not possible to him, for he byddeth that they
should be cut. But what is that racyonall indycyon taken of time / and than to
use remedies of Mustarde / of the which he takes and vsurpe^h this vain
word Metasycrisis? after that he provoke vomytes, by Raffortz. And at the
last when he fyndeth none other remedy to use Elebore? Of the which things
shall be spoken more plainly hereafter, when we shall show that no indicacyon in
what disease soever it be not taken of time. Albeit that ye time is sometime
sign of the disease. But I find again a^ Hyppocrates, whereof I merueyle of
his great dylygence in all other things, and chyefly y^ he has not forgoten
yt which is pryncypally to be considered, of the master in medicyns touching
to indicacion. Not only in one disease or two, but in all. That is to wit the
indycacyon yt is taken of the myghtynes of the disease, which the Methodykes
only have not left (which is no merueyle) but also diverse of the racyonalles,
and Emperykes although it be in diverse manners. For when they say yt they have
observed the euacuacyon of the course of to much blood / they confess
manyfestly yt they have no regard of other things yt appear in the sores for
to come to such euacuacyo^, which yt I say therefore ye purgacyon is euacuacyon,
the which is not indicate by the course of to much flowyng of blood, but also
for because yt (although yt there be no course of redoundyng blood) we must
sometime come and have refuge to the sendyng of blood, in greek called
phlebotomy? For when the disease is great, with the force of strengthes there
is none but he make phlebotomy, if he be expert in the works of the art. And
sothly we se yt the emperykes comes to the sendyng of blood when any is
fallen from a hye place. Or when there is any parties sore bruised and hurt with
any wound though yt the pacyent were hole and sound before and without
superhabundaunce of blood. By the which it appears yt it is not the
redoundyng of blood yt indicateth the phlebotomye, but it is the myghtynes and
vehemence of the disease, and the force of the strengthes, accepting always
children. And by an other reason, as if a man be hole and sound and in no wise
hurt and is full in habundaunce of blood, for all y^ it is not necessary to take
his blood from him. For to some, fasting may satysfye, to another small
eating, to another^ flux of the womb, or purgacion, or hauntynge of batthes,
to another only besynes, or habundaunt fretyng may be enough. But the
phlebotomye is not necessary to such folks, as the emperykes say also.
Likewise purgacyon is not co^uenable in the only habundaunce of vycyous
humor. But like as the phlebotomye is made either for habu^daunce of blood, or
for the magnytude and fyersnes of the disease, also the purgacyon is made for
the habundaunce of some other humor, and for the vehemence and force of the
disease. As touching the myssyon of blood we have treated in another book, and
shall treat hereafter. In this present book I will speak of the purgacyon. For
they yt be dyseased desire it. Not only because yt it euacueth the superflue
humor and noisome, wherwt they be grieved, but also to put it out and be
cle^sed. And for this cause Hyppocrates as well in his other works as in yt that
he has written of vlceres considers the vehemence and strength of the disease
to ye indication of purging says thus. Purgacyon by the belly is profitable to
many vlceres, to the wounds of the head and of the belly, and of the artycles,
or also if there be danger of rotte^nes in the bone, or where sutares
behooves, or also to gnawyng. Likewise to serpent vlceres and other affections
yt makes the vlceres long in healyng. And also where as rollynges must be
used, in all such affections behooves purgacyons. By these words it is
clearly showed yt purgacyon is profitable to all vlceres and wou^des, at al and
every time yt they are greatest. For in asmoche yt not only the said
affections, but also other be made grievous and great in three manners. That is to
wit either for y^ exc^llency and nobylyte of the party, and myghtynes of the
disease, or because yt the said maladyes and affections are Cacoethe, yt is
wicked. Hyppocrates has made mencyon of all these things by them selfs. That
is when he shows of wounds of the head, and belly, the dygnyte and
excellency of the party yt is hurt. I think yt it is manifest to all yt here
must be understand not only the inward belly, but also the superyour. For in
dividing ye tronke which is between the neck and the legs, is two great
capacytees. The first is contained under the Thorax. The second under the
fondement, yt is to the me^brane yt is stretched under labdomen, and for
certain ye wound yt has perced wtin the Thorax, or wtin the ars hole is very
dangerous, pryncipally if any of the inward parties be wounded. Likewise
there is but few but he knows well yt all wounds of the artycles are
Cacoethes and wicked. The which thing the Emperykes understand by only
experyence. And they yt have studied to have the science of the nature of the
body, understand it by the nature of ye hurt parties. For in the synewes and
bony places and without flesh there is danger of pain, wakyng, and
pryuacyon of rest, and also of con^ulsyon. Such wounds abouesayd, and such as
be stytched, yt is to say yt are so great yt they have need to be sowed, or at
leest ways of byndynge or rollynge require purgacyon. andWe have said in the
next book before yt all the great vlceres ought to be conjoined, either by
seames or by byndynges, like wise yt the vlceres where there is danger of the
corruption of ye bones are with magnytude of phlegmon. Also they yt are with
erosion be cacoethes and wicked, and proceed of evil humors. And also cankers
comes of bylyous excrementes. That is to wit coleryke superfluite, and al
other old vlceres comes of such a cause / wherefore in all ye vlceres
aforesaid Hyppocrates commands to purge by ye belly, and following after he
adds these words. In all vlceres whereto erisipclas is common the body must
be purged in the party most vtyle for the vlcere, so yt the purgacyon be made
either by the upper parties or by the inward, whereof he has taught us the
dyff^rence in the book of humors / where he by^deth to return to the
contrary parties and deryuat to the side. And when there is great fluxion yt it
behooves to make another vlcere in the contrary parties, and thereof he speaks
in the said book, whereof if yet again if the fluxyon be i^petuous and great we
shall make reuulsion in the contrary parties, yt is to wit if the vlcere be in
the upper parties, by purgacyon downwarde, if the vlcere be in the inward
parties, in purgynge the upper belly. But if the fluxion be stopped all ready, in
such wise yt it is drawn to, and fixed in the membre, it is more expedyent to
drive it out by the next places, seeing that the translacyon and transporte is
by ye parties yt be next it. Seeing also ye thaccesse and actraction of the
purging medycament is more easy and prompte nere then fer. The which reason
belongs also to another party of ye art, yt is to wit of yt which treats of
the purgacyon of humors, as it is well known to all, and therefore hereafter
it shall be necessary to repete it, and make it all parfyte^ Now will I show yt
the force or if ye will call it the myghtynes, or fyersnes, ought to be
stablysshed and ordained by indicatrice of phlebotomye, or of purgacio^, and yt
Hyppocrates was ye first inuentour of the said indicacyon, which I will show
as touching to other dyseases in the books yt follow, and in this present book
I will treat of vlceres. I have all ready spoken clearly of the purgacyons. For
sith it is so yt every disease is grievous and fyers in.iij. manners, yt is
either by precellence and noblenes of ye party, or for the strength and
magnytude of ye affection and disease or for ye wyckednes and frowardnes of the
same, called i^ greek Cacoethia. Hyppocrates has made me^cyon of all these
things where as he spoke of purgacyons, but some perchance shall say. How
than? does not Hippocrates persuade sometime for to draw the blood for the same
causes abouesaid? It seems yt he commands them thus, but in few words, and
nevertheless not without demonstracyon, as he is accustomed, and also all the
other auncyentes. Thou shalt understand yt it is thus. First if thou read
again his words yt are such. In all vlceres newly made, but if it be in the
belly, it is expedyent yt forth with it flow in blood either more or less. For
by yt mean the vlcere shall be less grievous by a phlegmon, and also the
places yt are about it. And after these words yt be written i^ his book of
vlceres (if you have mind of it) yt he has often proposed it in his other
books. How yt medycyne ought to be i^mytatour not only of nature, but also to
those things yt are profitable when they come to their, propre and natural
flyryng you shall clearly understand ye mind of Hyppocrates, that is, yt blood
must be drawn when the wounds are great. For if it be expedient yt the blood
flow in such vlceres, and that be not leten slow, you must add and supply
that yt is needful. T^ese words yt he writes after the declaryng thus, and
conioyneth them forth with to them abouesayd. It is profitable yt the blood be
leten flow many times from the inuetera^^ viceres (in what soever manner yt
s^all be seen opportunate) as well in the vlcere, as in the parties about it. For
in asmoche as he has said before ye blood ought to be taken from every grene
wound, seeing yt he made no mention of veterate vlceres, it would have we^ed to
some yt he had only spoken of grene or fresshe wounds, whereby he has well
added yt it behooves to draw blood from ye inueterate and old sores. Now sith
it is so yt the doctrine yt we have taken of him is perpetual and always true,
that is how fluxyon ought to be drawn (the which begins) as ye contrary
parties, and that which is all ready fyxed in the party ought to be purged,
either by the said paynfull party, or by ye next party to it. It is now easy
to us to conclude of the detraction of blood, how from the beginning it ought
to be done in the party far of and most dystaunt, and then in the vlcerate
parties. Likewise if ye add to the abouesayd things yt Hyppocrates
admonysshed to empty the superflue humor, sometime ye shall use detraction of
blood, yt is when the blood surmounteth. Sometime ye shall give a medycament yt
has virtue to purge ye humors coleryke or melancolyke, or else phleume. Having
ever in mind in all these works how none of them is the curacyon of vlceres.
In asmoche and as vlcere. But rather of cacomye yt is coniunct with the vlcere,
or of Pletore, or of phlegmon, or of herpes, and other like dysposycyon, without
to forget yt any of the accydentes of the vlcere give any force of his propre
indication, as magnytude. In the book before we have spoken of vlceres, wherein
we have exposed all the differences of vlceres, how many, and what they be, and
what is the indycacyon of each of them. Howbeit I have not spoken in ye said
book how sometime to purge is taken of the force and vehemence of the disease,
because it should be to long demonstracyon. Also in the said book I have not
conjoined ye cure of all the body with the vlceres, but I have written it in this
present book, in asmoche as it is good and vtyle for ye thing proposed. For the
parfyte and absolute exposycyon of this kind of indicacion, which we have said
is taken of ye myghtynes and strength of the disease, shall be also treated of
hereafter. Likewise of the indication taken of the age, and also of it yt is
taken of purging of humors. And likewise the indicacion yt is taken of the
payned parties shall be parfytly declared in the books yt follows. For as now
we have only made mention of the curatyfe indicacion, which may be taken of
the nature of the said parties, yt is to wit of ye temperaunce and substance,
without touching of yt which is taken of the situacyon of the form and figure,
of the vtylyte and usage, and of ye felyng sharp and dull, Now then let us
speak of the said indi^acions yt is profitable to the curation of vlceres. The
party yt is sharp of felyng ought asmoche as ^s possible to be cured without
dolor or pain. The ^ater of such remedies is treated in the books yt be
written of simple medycamentes. But the par^ye yt is but of small feeling
receives stronger remedies, if the disease require it so. Now we must consydre
the strength of the pryncipal membre, as we shall say more at large when we
speak of phlegmon. But if it be not a pryncypall membre, it is lefull surely
and without danger to lay to it such manner of medycament as mytygate and
assuage, the greeks call it Calastyce, we shall speak of it plainly h^^eafter.
At this present time we will show ye reason and manner to heal, which is taken
of ye situacio^ and figure of the parties, and than we will impose the end of
this fourth book. For this cause we have cogitate and inverted yt we must give
medicame^tes to drink to him yt has his ve^tricle vlcerate, which vulgarily
is called ye stomach, and if the bulk yt properly is called ye stomach, yt
the greeks call cesophagus be vlcerate, the said medycamentes ought not to be
taken and swalowed at ones, but by little and little in contynuyng, because of
the passage, and also of the touching there come vtylyte in the vlceres yt are
in yt party, and not for to contain the said medycamentes yt be adherent, as
in the vlceres of the ventricle. Likewise we have indicate and showed by the
sytuacyon and figure of the said party yt such medycamentes ought to be made
grosser and thycke, and more gleymy and cleuyng, because yt the bulk is a
passage of the things yt is eaten and dronken. For yt cause it has need of
remedies yt may draw to it, and almost in all parts to be coagulate and
cleuyng, and not such as are thy^ne and easy to re^ne and flete lightly. And
also the course and thycke medycamentes do crud and make concrecyon in ye
parties of the bulk or oesophage, and they yt be gleymy do cleue to. Likewise
in vlceres yt are in ye thycke and inward guts have more need of remedies
which are cast out and put out by the syege, in asmoche as the said thyck^ are
next to ye syege. But of the vlceres yt are in the intestynes upward and
thynne, because they be ferdest from the syege, and are set in ye myddle
situacion, require both the two medicines, yt is to wit, those yt are received
by ye mouth, and those be infused and cast out by the syege. Now for certain
the common indicacion of all ye interyour parts is yt we ought to choose those
things yt be most famylyer to the nature of man, be they metes or medicines.
And yt we leave and cast away all contrary things. Albeit yt in the vlceres
which be in the outward parties, the usage of such medycament be not noysom
as is aerugo, aes vstu^, and aeris squama and cadmia, and pa^pholix commonly
called thutie, and argenti spuma, yt is litargiri, and ceruse. Such and like
medycamentes ought not to be used nor admynystred to the vlceres of ye inward
parties, of whose nature we have written in the book of te^peramentes, and in
the book of the simple medycynes. And if ye will bring ye vlcere to a festre or
cleuynge ye ought to choose tarte meats and gleymy yt have no manner of erosyon.
But if ye will cleanse the vlcere ye must choose things yt absterge or wasshe
moderatly, as raw ho^ny, which above al thing is cle^sing thus. As touching
scarre potions and meats they are commonly known over all. I call austere
which in greek hight (styphon) yt is to say a little adstryngent. For sour or
vytter is it yt is tarte (in greek stryph^ion.) The medicines yt may be taken
surely and without danger is treated of in the books of medicamentes.
Nevertheless we will say some formulary for the inward vlceres such medycamentes
are wholesome, as hypocistis, and balaustium, yt is the flower of tame
pomgarnets, and galla, and malicoriu^, y^ is the husk or pyl of the pomgarnet,
terra samea, et leminu^, yt is terra sigillata, and the pyth of Rhus, yt is
symac, also the iuce of roses, and achatia, and other like, which anoy not the
bowels and inward perties. And ye must show and give ye said medicamentes with
some decoction of tarte things, as decoction of quinces, of lentister, or of
the highest boughs of rubus, or of vynes burgeons, or grene myrtylles, or with
tarte wine. It is now manifest and none is ygnorau^t, yt he must beware of
drinking of wine if there be phlegmon, or else there is no danger. In likewise
it is well known and euydent yt the said medycamentes must be prepared and
received with the decoctions, and moist things. Also ye must meddle together
fraga, cauthu, and ge^me, chyefly to ye vlceres yt are in the bulk and
resophage. Also it was commanded to make gargarysynes to the vlceres yt are in
the parties called fauces and pa^ysthmia, but in the vlcere yt is in the sharp
artere called tracheia, the pacyent must be laid vpryght, and keep the
medycament long time in his mouth in losyng all y^ muscles yt be in yt place.
For in so doing some part of the medycament will flow by little and little in
to ye artere se^sibly and manyfestly. As we may know when the said artere is
well disposed after the nature of it, yt somewhat of ye which is dronken re^neth
and passes through it. But likewise as in health and good lust it must be kept
yt it influe not to much, so in it must in disease for fear yt it enge^dre
not ye cough. For as long as the humor descends in every part nygh the
tunycles of ye artere as water does by a wall it exciteth not ye cough, but if
some thing pass in the mids of the way of the spert, yt is the air, forth
with it bredeth the coughe. All the indicacyons of it is taken of ye situacyon
and form of the party. Likewise also hu^ny must be meddled in all
medicamentes destined and ordained to the vlcere of the Thorax and the lunges.
For if ye use only tarte medicines they will remain in ye belly. The^
thynstrument of the dygestyon and distrybucyon of the said medycamentes over
all the body shall be hu^ny. Also of their sudden passing as a vehicule, with
yt there is hu^ny it noyeth not the vlcere. Like manner all and as many times as
there is vlcere in ye bladder and in ye raynes it must be myxed with the
medycamentes of the vlceres, not with hu^ny, but with some dyurytyke
medycamentes, yt is such as provoke and styrreth to pysse. I think that yt
is patent and manifest to every man, after yt I hold my peace, yt is to wit yt
they can know and dyscerne the vlcerate parties by their substance, action,
vtylyte, position and figure, the which has been showed plainly in the book of
the signs of ye payned parties, but this is not now yt time to speak of them.
I will return to ye Method curatyfe, and I say that not only the things
abouesaid, but also many other are the indicyons of the figure, and sytuacyon
of the parties. For ye can not well and co^modyously bind the sore party, but
if first ye have taken indicacyon either of ye figure, or of the sytuacyon, or
of both two together. Nor ye can not set the pype of a clyster right without such
indycacyon. It is also many times necessary to make iniectio^ of the
medycamentes in the bladder by the yerde, wherefore it is no need to make
mencyon here yt totally ye can not well use a syring of bras yt the greeks call
Cathering, but if ye know parfytely the posycyon, and figure of all the
bladder. Than in all these things it appears clearly yt the payned place
indicateth much to all the curacyon, but of the ruptions (yt the greeks call
Regmatha) diverse indicacions are concurrau^t to one purpose, and pryncypally ye
indicacion yt is taken of ye posicion ought to be examyned. For seeing yt the
rupcyons be hyd in the depth of ye body, therefore they require other curacions
than the vlceres yt appear outwardly, and because yt all holly and always such
rupcyons be with ecchymosis or ecchymonia, and sometime with contusyon about the
broken flesh, therefore there be diverse indicacyons curatyues therein, for
always the curatyfe indicacions are correspondent to ye nombre of ye affections
and dyseases, which we shall show more plainly when we speak of phlegmon, how
the dyseases yt are in ye deep places requires stronger medycamentes, than
they yt be at ye superfluyte of the body. Than for the least I do think for to
be manifest and pacyent, yt it is necessary that the strength of medicamentes
yt are mynystred outward be resolved and dymysshed when the party yt should be
helped and remydyed is hyd in the dypenes of the body, and therefore it behooves
asmoche to intend and augment the virtue of the said medycament, as it should
be remyssed and dymynysshed in ye depth of the body. Certainly all acchymosis
or ecchymonia indycateth vacuacyon for remedy of ye cure, whereby it has need
of medycamentes moderatly hot and dry, for they yt dry excessyuely, of troth
do dygest and resolve at ye beginning more euydently than they yt be weyke, but
also some party of the disease scyryous, and dyffycyle to heal, we shall speak
of it hereaft dylygently, for as now we have spoken enough, after as it
belongs to the matter. Of troth all the medicamentes and oyntmentes, yt
moysteth and heteth more then they yt all the greeks call chalastica, yt is to
say laxatyfes, also among the said medycamentes all they yt declyne somewhat
to dryness, nevertheless be not yet clear nor manifest contraction (they be
called syntatica in greek) such medycamentes ben the remedies of all
ecchymosis. But ye must take good head yt the medycamentes applycate to the
ruptions yt are in depenesse of the body have strong virtue, and yt they be
sourer and digestyfe, yt is resolutyfe. (And for to say so^maryly) yt such
medycamentes to be of greater force and effycace, in asmoch as lecchymosis is
ferther of, from the skin unto the depenes of the body. In such affections
and dyseases the usage of the heart bytuleth, yt is to say ventose should not be
inutyle, which is an instrument invented and excogitate of masters for to make
vyolent attraction. And when ecchymosis is all dygested and resolved, than it
is parmytted to dry the broken flesh, much, and to conioyne it with lygature,
and to do all yt is conuenable to coalesse and close an vlcere together. Than
if ecchymosis be soon digested and resolved y^ broken flesh gathers
together and waxes plain easyly, but if the said ecchymosis tarry long or it
be resolved, much fylthynes bredeth in it, and occupyeth ye space yt is
between the labyes or lyppes of the vlcere, so y^ the rupcio^ can not close,
wherefore it follows yt all these things abouesayd admonyssheth us for all
causes, how small soever they be. For though that some has had rygour, yt is to
say unequal concussyon of all ye body, or that it has not made good
concoction, or yt it has had the fever, or yt it has been over weryed or
fatygate, anon it shall have pain in the said party where as the ruption is.
For because of the said ruption have been united and nowryssneth together, but
have alonely ben approached one to another, whereby it follows yt a little thing
may depart them easyly, and fill the place with superflue humor, but what
engenders it in such rupcyons contynually but now ecchymosis, and like unto
the first, that is to wit when y^ flesh was first broken, except yt
presently ecchimosis is made of more toughe and subtyl corrupcyon, and at y^
beginning it was made of blood. And herfore now it digesteth and resolves more
easyly tha^ it did at ye beginning. And thus that which we have said hitherto
shall suffyse for the dysputacyon of vlceres. The^fore as now I make an end
of this fourth book.

Thus ends the fourth book of the Method of Claude Galyen.

To the Reader.
Dear Brethren, and friendly Readers, we have here according to the truth
and meaning of the Author, set forth this needful and necessary work
concerning the Anatomy of man's body, being collected and gathered by Master
Thomas Vicary, and now by us the Chirurgions of S. Bartholmewes Hospital
revived, corrected, and published. And albeit this treatise be small in
volume, yet in commodity it is great and profitable. Notwithstanding, if the
things therein contained be not discreetly and wisely studied and applied,
according to the true meaning of the Author, we have to tell you hereof, that
therein is great perrill, because through ignorant practitioners, not knowing
the Anatomy, commonly does ensue death, and separation of soul and body.
Furthermore, whereas many good and learned men in these our days, do cease to
publish abroad in the English tongue
