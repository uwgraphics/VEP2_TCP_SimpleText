TO THE RIGHT Worshipful HVMPHRIE CONISBYE: W. B. wishes all joy and
happiness in this world; and in the world to come life everlasting.
RIght Worshipful, ever since my childish years were adopted with that
mutual sense of seeing, and imboldned with your favorable smiles; I presumed
to survey the manifold favors, that I found written in the Margent of your
love: which seeing, I find my self so deeply indebted to your Worship, that
although I should endeavor my self, even to the last gasp, yet were it
impossible for me to deserve, or make you restitution for the least of them:
but as heretofore I still presumed on your kindness, presenting to your
Worship the frowns of fortune, so rudely and roughly polished, that I fear
you will smile with Alexander at the crooked deformity of Vulcan: yet sometimes
the mind is as well pleased to hear of Pans, homely fancies, as of Hercules
renowned labors; Homer wrote verses as well on Irus the Beggar, as Eurymachus
the wooer: Apollo gives Oracles as well to the poor for his mite, as the rich
for his treasure: Darius as well received the rough unpolished colors of Mison,
as the curious pictures of Apelles, Therefore I beseech you, to shroud this
imperfect Pamphlet, under your worships patronage: assuring my self that your
worships learned education, and virtuous disposition, will be a sufficient
defense to protect me from the envious tongues of the scorning Sycophants, and
hoping as Jupiter and his Son, vouchsafed to lie in Philemons poor cottage:
so I hope your worship will excuse my slender skill, and accept of my willing
mind, and when you have given them a favorable view, with Minerua under your
golden Target cover a deformed Owl: so hoping for more then yet I have
deserved, I rest, wishing you the happy success of hearts content, where I
leave you to the Heavens disposing.

Your Worships most dutiful and ever bounden W. BETTIE.

THE HISTORY OF TITANA AND THESEUS.
IN Greece, there dwelt a mighty King called Aegeus, who had reigned fifty
years; fortunate and successiue in all his warlike affairs: that through the
puissance of his force to his foes, and bountiful courtesy to his friends; he
was feared in hate, and embraced in love. This Aegeus had one only Son,
whose name was Theseus, who was by birth Royal, learned by education, by
Nature valorous, and by Virtues famous: insomuch that it was hard to judge
whether his valor, Fortune, or Virtue won the greatest praise.

This young Prince, being so richly adorned with she rare feats and
accomplishments of Chiualry that he did not only enjoy his Fathers love, but
also won his Subjects hearts: at that instant, there lived Meleagar, King of
Achaia, not far distant from the Court of Aegeus, who had a Daughter, a fair
young Virgin, whose name was Titana, her virtuous dispositions were such, as
might justly challenge more love than the world could yield her: for her beauty
was such, as it tainted Venus cheeks, her virtue shadowed Diana's Altars, her
learning stained sacred Pallas, and her loyalty was such as if quite surpast
Penelope: how can the world then extol these excellent gifts of Nature, to the
high sphere of their deserts, being so exquisitly limited, and so lovingly
applauded by their Subjects reports, but by committing them to those glittring
creatures, enclosed within the spangled s^ies, where we will leave them to the
Heavens disposing, and turn to Meleagar her father: who in his youth, had
been brought up with Aegeus, and was his Schoolefellow; so as they had been
School fellows in their youth, they remained loving Neighbors in their age,
maintaining course and recourse, to and fro each others Courts, upholding
golden amity, with the pillars of brotherly love, which did not only rejoice
the Achaians, but also augment the Grecians love, with such inordinate and
extreme passions, that every year, upon the Kings Coronation day, the people
throughout all Greece, and Achaia, held a general feast, for the space of
forty days, with Iusts and Turnies, with Running, Wrestling, Leaping and
dancing, with Bonfires, ringing of Bells, and such like pleasant pastimes: not
only to honor their two Kings, but also to show their inward joy, by their
outward actions: as well to show their Kings, their royal deserts, as their
loyalty, being Subjects. When this solemn Triumph was quite ended, the people
returned unto their former labor, and wonted course of life, where we will leave
them and turn to Theseus: who though but young in years, yet old in
experience, though valorous with Hercules, yet not too venturous with Phaeton;
though vpheld with the wings of Fortune, yet not rash in flying with Icarus,
but keeping lower bounds with Daedalus; he feared not the Thunderbolts of
Jove, nor yet the raging waves of Neptune: well (to be brief:)

Theseus, who had ever since he was able to harbor, or conceive one amorous
thought, marked the excellency of Titana's behavior, and the exquisitie of her
beauty, persuaded himself that she was matchless on earth: in so much, that
at last he fell into passionate affections with Titana; and burst out his
passions in these terms, being alone in a garden, sitting under an Orange
Tree:

Ah Theseus thou art a Kings son, and art applauded by the Greeks, to be the
only champion of this climat, and will thou live a slave to Venus, confined and
bard of liberty? no, no, cast off these foolish affections; for Theseus,
surely thou do not love, these are but instant conceits, sweetened with honey,
or fire made with straw, they are not Amors of perfection.

Ah Theseus, flatter not thy self, thy heart does feel she deadly wound of
Cupids Dart: Oh, that blind boy has pierst it clean through, like an Indian
pearl: yet be cheareful Theseus, what needst thou fear, thou know the
salve to cure thy amorous corrasiue: Titana, is a Kings Daughter, and she is by
birth Royal, learned by education, fair by Nature, by virtues famous and by
possessions rich: why then what needst thou fear, cast off these despairing
follies, and put on assuring fancies, for Cupid never throws his Dart, but
Venus seeks the wound: why then Theseus, art thou a Prince, a valiant
Soldier, and wilt live thus perplexed with foolish love, or a wound given by a
Boy? expel such capital follies, as would include thee with ignominious
conceits, when he had thus sufficiently explained his passions, and searched the
deepnesse of his still bleeding wound, he takes his farewell of the Orange Tree,
that shaddowed him from the beams of Phoebus, and returns to his chamber,
where we will leave him ruminating on his love, and turn to Titana: Who all this
while even from her infancy, had noted the princely gesture of Theseus, and
seeing his face so perfectly featured, and viewing each limb* the portraiture
of his body so well limited, that she greatly commended Dame Natures art, and
excellency in shaddowing such perfection under her Fortunes lot: persuading
herself, that none but Theseus should reap the harnest of her affection:
being thus perplexed with inordinate passions, and possessed with amorous
affection, it wrought like a purgation with her, in so much that at last she
brake her passions in these terms.

Ah Titana, (thou art in love) (I) with whom? with Theseus, (with Theseus) he
is a Kings son, why so art thou a Kings Daughter; he is famous in birth; thou
art virtuous, and fair by Nature; he is a Prince, why thou art a Princess:
thou every way art equivalent with him: why then, if thou lonest Theseus,
Theseus cannot choose but love Titana: Ah Titana, thou fond fool, sigh, sob,
and lament thee of thy follies, art thou so fond to think that Theseus being a
valiant warrier, the Grecians champion, and heir apparent to that invincible
King Aegeus, will look on thee? no, thou art not an object fitting for his
expectiue eye, though thy virtuous qualities be opposite to his valorous
accomplishments, yet he cannot love Titana: why? Titana is beautiful,
virtuous, and rich, I, and after her Fathers decease heir to the Crown of
rich Achaia: why then Titana, suppress these frantic passions, and incline
to lovely affections, for do thou but smile, he cannot choose but love: well
when she had thus at large played and displayed her passionate affection, she
returns to her chamber, to be melancholy, where we will leave her.

Theseus, who had received such a deadly wound, thought it long until he had
some remedy for it, starts him up from the imbracements of his restless bed,
and walks toward the Court of Meleagar: even at his approach within the Court
gates, she clock struck eight: quoth Theseus, it is too early days to seek
to speak with Titana yet; I Will go walk a course or two about the Gorden, till
the clock strikes again, and that I think will be about the time of Titana's
rising: he immediately turns on the back side of the Court, to enter into the
Garden, but when he came he found the door fast locked: yet Fortune willing to
favor his presence, would not suffer him to return, but caused him to knock,
the which he did, and immediately it was opened by a Groom of Titana's
chamber: quoth Theseus, where is your Lady and mistress, stirring yet? quoth the
Groom, and shall please your Highness she sits alone at the further end of the
Garden, a reading, with that Theseus cast up his eye, and espied his lovely
Paramour: walking in the Garden unseen of Titana, he stepped into a green
Arbor, which stood directly opposite against her, and not far distant from
her, where he first viewed each limit, or proportraiture of her body: and then
began he to break his passions: Ah Theseus: (ecce) see how her crimson lips
stand like two Pilgrims, to adorn those vermillion cheeks of hers, which
like as the Adamant draws the steel, so they draw thee to love: Nay behold
her crystal eyes, how like to inestimable Diamonds, they glitter and give
light to the out chanted Cynthia: now last of all, see how far her twined
looks do surpass the Arabian gold, in golden beauty: when he had thus
breathed out his passions in these passionate terms; he stands a while
commenting in this dull perplexity, yet at last begins to prosecute his
passions with these terms.

Theseus, thou see her excellency, perfection and beauty, why then make a
mixture with those, and thy entire love, and drink them as a physic potion,
either to cure, or kill, and so shall thou be sure to be eased by death, else
cured to life, for in love there is life, in hate there is death, but Titana's
face, resembles an Adamants virtue, to draw love by affection, and not kill
love with rejecting (and more) it is impossible, that she should cover a flinty
heart with a smiling face, for I know the virtue of Venus mollifies the heart
of Titana: why then Theseus, what need thou fear, show thy self as valiant
a Prince to Titana, as thou have done in former time to Mars, and returned
victor of the field, when thou wast beset with millions of foes, and will thou
now fear the repulse of a woman, and being thy love too? no thou shall scale
the walls, and lay battery to the fairest: and with that he stepts out of the
Arbor with a modest behavior, and full resolution, takes her by the hand, and
withal dimples her cheeks with a lovely smile, as love gives lovers
direction (and thus begins.) Fair Titana, ever since I could conceive one
Amorous thought, or cast a wanton eye on beauties perfection, I have remained
imburthened with the essence of your beauty, and wounded with the vlcerous sore
of your love: therefore, fair Lady reject me not with disdain, because I
approach with courtesy: and as our two aged Fathers live in peaceful amity,
so let us combine a matrimonial unity, it will not only be a comfort to them,
but also an eternal joy to us: Titana resting, and meditating a while, at last
be paints her cheeks with a maiden blush, and thus replies.

Prince Theseus, this is very strange to me, that such inordinate passions of
love, should so far ouerflow her shores on the sudden, being no storm nor
spring to be the causer: therefore Theseus, surely this is not love, these are
but feigned fictions to try simplicity: inluring baits, to catch fond folly in
wantons snares: for Demophoon was fair by nature, but proved false to
Phyllis: Aeneas was a brave man, but as false as Almider: yet were their
protested vows, greater than common hearts can conceive: Therefore Theseus
suppress thy passions, and leave to love Titana, for she cannot love thee
again, she is like the star Artophylax, that is beauteous to the eye, but
fit for no use: even so is Titana, just opposite against nature: well still she
keeps him at the staffes length, and sits her still on the green bank where
he found her: shadowing her yielding passions with denying frowns.

Theseus, who all this while had marked, and viewed each limit of her body, and
the feature of her face, thought it very strange, that Nature should endow so
fair a face, with so hard a heart, such comely limmits with such perverse
conditions? at last thus began to prosecute his cause again in these terms.

Fair Titana, be not proud of beauties painting, for it is but a Summers
flower, the Winter seeds it, and those which disdain in youth, are despised
in age: therefore fair Lady, make not a Goddess of beauty, but yield me love,
for love; and let not the destinies cause me to despair, now in the verdency
of my blooming youth. Titana sitting still on the bank, (as it were) not
regarding him, thus begins. Theseus I commend thine exceeding wit, but in
this case, I pity thy distress, and for thy extremity of love thou bear to
me, I vow thee recompense, but with contract I dare not promise, therefore
good Theseus, suppress those passions, which now thy mind is perplexed with.

Theseus standing a while, commenting of his dull perplexity, scarcely dared
vouchsafe to give an answer, or demand a remedy, yet said he, opportunities
neglected are signs of folly, therefore he began again in these terms.

Titana, the fatal doubts of cruel death, is not so feared of me, but I dare
extend my life with fortunes sat, to enjoy thy love: why then fair Lady, since
I am so wounded with your love, yield to my request, which is within the bounds
of modesty desired: If I were lascivious, demanding unchaste desires to use
thee as a Concubine, then might thou justly be perverse, and say me nay: or
were I a beggar, or a base borne vassal of no desert, or for reputation vile,
then would I hold it wisdom: or came I like a Scythian Shepherd, with my
sheepe-hooke on my neck: but coming like a Grecian Prince, with my Scepter in
my hand, demanding love with a chaste devotion, me thinks you should not be so
perverse to deny so kind a demand. Quoth Titana, good Theseus be not so
tedious, for to be short in terms, I will not grant thee love; for love is
the only thing ^ hate, therefore trouble me no more with such frivolous
speeches, if you please to accompany me, as in former time you have done, you
shall be the welcomest man in Greece: but if you reply with such like speeches
as love, I rather desire your a sense, than your presence.

Theseus hearing her still in that froward denying vein, quite expelled hope,
and included despair: and thus began he, which scarcely found beginning. O
wicked and despairing wretch, forlorn, and of Titana forsaken, worse than the
seruilst slave in Achaia, more base than the stimie earth underneath thy feet,
more in bondage than Tunisian gally slaves, more vacant on earth, than Indians
in Arabia, and more wretched than Progne in her transformation: why how came
thou thus metamorphosed being a Kings son? (oh with love) with love of that
ungrateful Titana, for had I not loved Titana, she had not caused my untimely
death, but measuring my adverse fortune, with thy perverse obstinacy, I Will end
my life: and with that he unsheashed his fatal Engine, and said thus: Fair
Lady, as like the Camelion, I have lived by the Airy essence of thy love: so
like faithful Theseus by thy hate I Will die: He sets the point of his sword to
his breast. Titana seeing him so desperate, lightly skipt from off the bank
whereon she sat, and suddenly takes him by the hand which held his sword, and
thus began.

Theseus, art thou a Prince, and a Kings son, a warrior, and Grecians
Champion: and wilt at a wenches frown ruin thy body, and bring thy aged
Fathers gray hairs with grief unto his grave, and his careful head on a
restless pillow? remember this, thou art Heir apparent unto thy Fathers
Crown and kingdom; and by thy well living, thy Fathers days are prolonged on
earth, but by thy ill dying, with grief they are soon ended: why then know
this brave Theseus, wenches will most deny the thing they most desire; and
seem most perverse, where most they love; and prove most constant, where they
seem most wavering (and so will I) I love, although I feigned a frown, yet
detested I to hate, and though my tongue said no, my heart protested I.
Therefore sweet Theseus, impute me not perverse, for the heavens know, I shame
to express, how proud I have been of Theseus love, yet would I not say,
Theseus I love thee, because then thou might repute me immodest being a Lady,
but the Gods do know, I have honored Theseus with a zealous devotion, and I
loved Theseus with as dutiful affection, as Titana could perform, or Theseus
desire: therefore sweet love, think not I yield with urgent prayers: but with
the force of Love.

Theseus noting her behavior, and hearing such unexpected terms, and snared
allurements of Titana, which made such pleasing harmony in his half dead
ears, was half ravished, and wholly revived to his former senses sheathed his
fatal blade again, embracing her in his arms, laid battery to her skarlet
lips, with many a sugared kiss he gives assault and winnes the Fort: In brief*
they suddenly combind, and fully accomplished a matrimonial contract, so that
after many lovely imbracings, and pleasing-wanton toys, (as love has many)
they parted for the time, so fraught with inordinate joy, that it is impossible
for the capacity of man to look so high as their joy did raise rebounds.

Fortune now envying their good acts, turns her Wheel, and as she had dimpled
her cheeks, so now she wrinkled her forehead, and vnreeled the destinies, for
in Achaia there dwelt Oenie, which every year did sacrifice the firstlings of
his store: the which he first assigned of his corn, and fruits to Ceres: to
Bacchus the first pressing of his wine: and unto Pallas Olive oil* and thus
honoring the gods of Grain, and fruit, he offered frankincense, but at
Diana's Altars none was offered, he over slipped them, the which Diana took in
high disdain, and said, he shall not escape unpunished, though he past mine
Altars vnworshipped, nor vaunt of his escape unrevenged, if I be a Goddess i will
plague him and his fruits, and with that away she flies: and on the next morn,
she sent a huge over grown Bear to Oenies ground, such as the like had never
yet been seen. This greedy Boar devoured the Corn and grass, and rent his
^^ines unto the ground: and not so sufficed but began to overrun, and
devour his Country of Ach^ia; insomuch that the husbandmen had labored in
vain, he over ran their Lambs, sheep* and Hearvs of Kie, nay men, women,
and children went daily in danger of this orped swines dreadful Tuskes.

In so much, that the people of Achaia preferred supplications to Aegeus,
Meleagar and Theseus, and many other Kings, Dukes, Lords and Knights, to desire
their aid to conquer this merciless Hog: the which they all were very
willing and affable, but Theseus: yet he said I, although he could have wished
it no: for the reason that moved him rather to have stayed at home, than have
gone, was this: he was newly returned from his love Titana, and they had both
agreed to make their Fathers acquainted with their loves on the next day
following, which was the day appointed, that this Princely knot should meet
and accompany each other, to the face of the Achaians foe: Theseus very much
discontent with this news, could have feigned himself sick, and stayed at
home, but his heart was so enobled with valor, that it would suffer excuse to
take no place: he seeing no remedy, but go he must, being that renowned King
Meleagar, with his royal troops of valiant Knights, accompanied with his
Father A^geus were come, he like Jason when he ventured for Media, or Hercules
for Deianita, or like Turnus, before he went to his bloody fight, armed and
enobled himself with valor: which done, he accompanied this Princely knot of
noble Knights, even to the very brincke of his own adverse Fortune, where
we will leave him vnreeling the destinies, and turn to Meleagar the causer of
his grief: who being vpholden with the wings of Fortune, reaped the plenteous
Hauest of a renowned encounter, by the winning a famous victory. Meleagar with
the rest of the valiant knights, threw his lucky Dart against this orped swine,
who being more potent with Fortunes favor, then impotent with Diana's frown,
gave this Bear his deadly wound: this being done, though old in years yet
young in conceit, for with pride merely of his fortunate stroke, he presently
fell into amorous feakes, with Atalant, Schoenies Daughter of Tegea: and
suddenly stepping to the Swine, said thus: Oh Lady Atalant, receive this my fee:
And of my glory, vouch thou safe, partaker for to be.


And with that gave her the head of the Swine.

THis Lady for the giuers sake was as glad in heart, as for the gift, and
received it very thankfully: but the rest repinde that she such honor had,
and arms displayed, that all the field might easily see, and hear, their
murmuring discontent: Plexippus and Toxey cried: Dame, lay down this gear,
do we take the toil, and thou the honor of our Game? no nor let that fair
face smooth of thine beguile thee, least he that being doted in thy love, and
giving thee our see, be ouer-farre to rescue thee: and with that word they
took the gift away from her, and right of gift from him.

Quoth Meleagar, with a stern and sterce looking countenance, you Thesties
race, learn this from me, and do not other folks dispoyle of honor given;
for Princes gifts are free, and none to be rejected: and Princes wills are
laws, of none to be usurped. Therefore Plexippus, what difference is betwixt
your threats and deeds, i will with this weapon try: and with that he suddenly
strikes him through the breast with his Boar spear. Toxey seeing his brother
slame, stood doubting what way to take, desiring to revenge his brothers blood,
yet fearing to be murdered as his Brother was before, stood amazedly
commenting: Meleagar, to dispatch his doubtful muzes, drew his fatal sword
and slew him for company of his Brother Plexippus, whose blood was hardly cold
as yet.

This bloody prospect, bred such a mutiny amongst them, that their arms
displayed on both sides, insomuch that the two houses, Meleagar and Aegeus, fell
into civil discension, and much blood was spilt on both sides: and not only
these two houses of Meleagar, and Aegeus, but almost all Greece, Achaia, and
Calidon was in an vproare, for each took arms against other, and being
renowned and famous Princes, friends took parts, and they began to bandie,
and overrun each others Dominions.

This disagreement between the parents, although it was a heart breaking to
these two lovers, Titana, and Theseus, yet did it not at all disparage their
affection, but the greater the mutiny, the deeper was the impression of their
minds, and by this means their liberty was confined, and meeting places
quite debard; yet love being a privy searcher of secrets sound a time and
opportunity which gave them place, time, and leave to parle, to play, and
display each others minds: when these two lovers came together, they were in
fear, and danger to be espied, which caused them one while, to sigh, sodde,
lament, and greiue; another while, kiss, smile laugh, and joy: and thus they
spent the time as pleasantly as distressed lovers could do yet they swear to
each other, y^ their Fathes dissension should never separate their loves, nor
adverse. Fortune should dimini^h their affections, but would remain joyful
unto death, in despite of the hateful destinies: having thus recounted each
others love to their hearts content, yet seeing they could not enjoy the full
fruition of their ^o^les in Greece, nor Achaia. Theseus determined as soon as
time and opportunity gave him leave, to provide a mass of money and Jewels
for the easier carriage: and so transport themselves into Spain, to Tunis: and
there to live a contented life, not known, but as a Grecian Knight, until he
heard of some united peace betwixt their Fathers, else by succession to enjoy
their Kingdoms: Titana hearing his determinate course, commended highly his
witty device, and said thus, Fair love, if thy father Aegeus should take me
within his precinct, it were death, or at least perpetual imprisonment, and
again on the other side, if my father Meleagar, should take thee to his
Dominions, it were the like danger for thoe to come into. But if my Father
should hear of this contract, his fury would be such, that ye tortorous death
were too easy for us both, first you for presumption, then, I for simplicity,
and so we shall bite both on the destinies bridle. Therefore sweet Theseus,
make have with all expedition, and provide all things fitting for our Voyage,
for delay breeds danger, and false Fortune despite. Theseus being fraught with
boundless joy and pricked forward with loves desire, did protest unto her
as soon as opportunity gave him leave, he would provide soch necessaries as
were fitting for their Voyage, so resting upon this resolution, and night
beginning to listen to their complement, after many imbracings, paid and
repayed kisses, they parted, Theseus having taken leave of his best beloved
Titana, returns him back again to his fathers Court: and being there
arrived, called unto him, an ancient Servant of his fathers, whose name was
Iunia: this Iunia being a faithful Servant, and Theseus approved friend, he
thought him not less then fitting to employ about this his secret pretense.
Theseus reposing confident trust in him, declared the whole volume of his mind
unto him, from the beginning to the end: Iunia, hearing him so fully bent, and
determinately resolved on this imperfect course: began to diswade, or divert
him to the contrary, alleging diverse instant inconueniencies: Theseus being
to determinate in his pretense began to reject Iunia for his folly in
diswading him, and told him he did not call nor disclose his mind unto him, to
ask his advice, or to be intercepted by him, but the cause he had him there
present, was this, he did depose trust unto him, and impose this secret business
on him to provide a small bark or Pinnace to transport them into Spain, with
moneys and certain Jewels and such like commodities for the easier carriage:
which if he could provide and make ready against such a time, he would reward
him royally for his pains.

Iunia hearing this, that there was no persuasion would take effect, or instant
examples to the contrary divert him, and withal respecting the Princes
bountfull promise began to yield unto him, I, and in the end promised him to
provide all things ready for their Voyage within the space of forty days at
the farthest. Theseus hearing this direct answer and yromise of Junia, was
exceedingly fraught with joy: insomuch, that to show his bounty, and bind him
unto his promise, he sent him away very richly rewarded, where we will leave him
providing for their Voyage, and turn to Meleagar.

Fortaine, who had already laid her train, so destinated, that it utterly
brake the united bands of these two Lovers Fathers combinde League, and almost
to the separating of their love, with heart breaking: yet not so content,
intending as she had given them a slender check, so now she should give them
a cruel blow; and to bring her pretense to be managed with perfection, she
laid her plot in his wise.

Meleagar walking privately in his Garden, commenting on his Daughter Titana,
brake out his passions in these terms; Meleagar, thou have but one only
Daughter, and she is now about the years of 23. and she is a Prince so richly
decked, and adorned with the gifts of Nature, so fraught with beauty and
virtuous qualities, that she is not only a comfort to thee, but also a joy to
thy poor Commons: why then, place all thy joy in her perfection, and fith she
is now marriageable, provide her a husband that is equivalent with her: when he
had thus passioned a while, he sat him down under a Poomsisherne Tree, to
meditate on whom he might bestow his Daughter Titana: till at last, he called
to mind great Ambrosia King of Portugal, who in former time had bin brought
up togeither for the space of seven years in School: and knowing this
Ambrosia to have a Son, whose name was Pirismus, who was fair by Natures,
royal by birth, by virtues famous, and by possessions rich: presently sends
Ambassadors to the King of Portugal, to entreat a marriage between his
Daughter Titana, and his Son Pirismus. Ambrosia hearing this, was exceedingly
fraught with joy, and told the Ambassadors, it was his decree before they came,
to have sent to their King Meleagar, concerning the same matter, but since they
were so hapily come, he told them his navy was ready, and his Son Pirismus
should along with them to Calidon, and if God did permit him, he would be there
with them within forty days. The Ambassadors having received their answer,
and the Prince borded his Fleet, the Mariners hoisted their maine sails,
weighed anchors, and halled into the deep.

Fortune favoring Theseus destiny, opens the windows of Aeolus, and gives
them a full wind, which in a short space arrived them on the shores of Achaia,
being so fortunately arrived, they instantly retired to the Court with the
young Prince Pirismus, and made report to Meleagar of Ambrosia's answer, and
how he had sent his Son as a pledge in the mean while. When Meleagar heard
that was Ambrosia's Son, he seemed very angry they did not send him word of
their coming, that he might have received him in a more Prince like manner:
but seeing it was now too late, to recall what was past, he saluted him very
submissiuely, and told him he was very sorry he knew not of his coming, for if
he had, he would have met him by the way. Well after these, and such like
words, Meleagar takes him about the middle, and leads him into the privy
Chamber, causing the Nobles to attend them, whereas Titana sat a sowing. Quoth
Meleagar, young Prince Pirismus, behold there sits mine only Daughter Titana,
my chiefest joy, and the original cause of your Voyage hither, and if you
please to acquaint your self with her you may. Quoth Pirismus, my noble Liege,
with your leave* else not* Quoth Meleagar, young Prince, you have our leave to
use your pleasure, Quoth Pirismus with a low obeisance, thanks my noble Liege,
and with that steps unto Titana, takes her by the hand, and thus begins:
Fair Lady if a (...) Prince, may vouchsafe so bold to be, as to prefer a
rough vnpolish'd touch unto those soft lips of yours without offense, my desire
is accomplished, otherwise my suit is cold. Titana seeing him a stranger, and
hearing such inordinate terms proceed from him, was half in a misdoubt that
her father had brought him to be a suter in a cause that was already
overthrown, and damages recovered, yet hoping the best, though fearing the
worst with a low curtisie, she thus replies, noble Knight, as your request is
small, it is the easier granted; again, if I should by dentall refuse it, you
might justly appeach me foolish: with that he gives her a kiss, which she very
thankfully received, and accompanied him unto her father, the which did greatly
rejoice the King, her father: by this time there was a table furnished with
such cates, and dainties, as could at so small a warning be provided. Meleagar
sitting down, caused Pirismus to sit on the same side which he sat on, and
Titana to sit on the other side, right opposite against him, because they
should take a full veiw of each other, the which Pirismus did; in so much, that
her perfection dighted so deep an impression in his heart, that none but
Titana could satisfy the Amor of Pirismus eye: when he was thus solemnly, and
sumptuously feasted, and royally entertained; and so entertained that if
Ambrosia had been there himself in person, having so small warning, they
could not receive him with more triumphant royalty. After they had thus
sufficiently past the day in sumptuous feasts, and banquets; the King gave
command he should be attended on to his lodging, and all his Lords, Knights and
Gentlemen, and their followers appointed their lodgings, and attended also:
which being done and all departed, Meleagar calls for Titana, and thus brake
his mind unto her.

Titana, my gray hairs sounds an alarm, and calls me to my grave: therefore
actions measured by time are seldom bitten with repentance? thou art young,
and I am old, my white hairs are fading blossoms, and thy fresh colors
blooming flowers, mine preparing to die, and thine repairing to live: therefore
(Titana) I take care, and tell thee as a father hoping thou will give care, and
obey as a Child. The chief thing I have taken care for, and desired, has
been to see thee happily married before I die, or thou grow old.

Titana, hearing her fathers counsel, and marking well his words, began to
feel which way the wind sat, and at last persuaded her self in her opinion,
as this, that her father had chosen this young Prince Pirismus to be her
spouse: fearing to displease her father, yet swearing and vowing not to forsake
Theseus, made him this answer.

May it please your Grace, to give me leave to speak? Quoth Meleagar, we give
you free leave. Quoth Titana, Sir, there is no greater bond than duty, nor
stricter law than Nature: for often disobedient youth are despised in age, and
Parents wills are laws; therefore, rather than by denial I should be
appeached of disobedience, i will rest content to love, although it be the only
thing I hate; I fit may please your Highness to appoint whom I shall love.

Meleagar hearing this unexpected answer of his Daughter, and seeing how light
she accounted of Love, began to be very hot, and chollericke, and with a
frowning countenance, made her this hasty answer.

What Titana, can thou not love? why, does the cynicall passion of prone
desires overcome thee with frantic frowardness, or peevish perverseness? or
do thou think thy self a young Phoenix, that there is none to equal she?
Ah Titana, take heed, left high Pride, bring low poverty, and young
disobedience, aged repentance: the Tree Alpia wastes not with fire, but
withers with deaw, and that which love nourishes not, hate perishes.

Well, yield Titana to thy Fathers persuasions, which may prevent all
after-perills; thou see I am old, and full of gray hairs, daily walking on
the brincke of my grave, ready to fall in every hour, and thou heir apparent
to my Crown, after my decease shall succeed in my Kingdom, in more triumphant
Throne, then ere thy Father Meleagar did in his youngest years: knowing this,
thou being young in years, and scarce gouernesse of thine own dispositions,
it would be a greater trouble, and a heavier burden, to be so over pressed with
the charge of a whole Kingdom, to govern and look to: with joy, I have
chosen thee a husband ^^^e, the Prince Pirismus, thou saw here^ore while; he
is a Prince, fair by nature, royal by birth, by virtues famous, and by
possessions rich: therefore if thou like Pirismus, thou breedst my content, and
in loving him, thou shall have my love, otherwise an everlasting hate.

Titana standing a while, called to mind that Theseus did purpose to take his
Voyage to Tunis very shortly, where she determined to arrive with him, and
therefore she thought it was as good for her to say she loved him, and keep
her fathers good will, as say she could not love him, and have his ill will*
and again, she thought this, if she should be perverse, and say him nay, it
might be a means in her fathers anger, to make him suspect, and misdoubt some
other matters, and so look more nearer unto her, and so be a hindrance to her
departure with Theseus: therefore she determined to yield with words unto her
Fathers desire, and thus bespake him, with a low courtesy:

Father, I obey your command as a child, hoping to enjoy your love as a Father:
and if Pirismus can love Titana, Titana will love Pirismus; but pray father
think not, but that I yield with love, and not with your persuasions: and
please you to appoint the nuptial day, I will be ready to accomplish what you
please to impose on me.

Quoth Mel^agar, now have thou won my heart, and shall enjoy my love, I Will
make thee rich by possessions, and happy by marriage, I Will indow thee with
wealth, and Pirismus with love, I joy to see thee toward, and hate to see thee
perverse: now shall my gray-haires enjoy a rest, which long has been
disturbed with ear* so after these, and many other such like speeches, he
appointed her the nuptial day, which should be at Ambrosia's coming: Titana,
being mindful of her true love Theseus, was fore troubled in mind, because her
father had appointed the time within so short a space, she was fearful that
Theseus could not provide all things for their Voyage so soon: yet bearing it
out with a good countenance, she looked pleasantly in the sight of her father,
and determined, if things were not ready soon enough, she would faigne some
excuse to prorogue the time; well for that time they departed, and betook them
to their rest: on the morrow morning, Meleagar was stirring very early, and
calls to him his chief Admiral, and commands him to provide a Fleet of his
chiefest Ships, and furnish them with men and Ordinance, and all things else
fitting to receive a Prince; he being no less then willing to fulfill the
Kings joyful determination, very speedily prepared all things fitting for
their Voyage, took his Embassage of the King, and suddenly boarded the Navy,
hoysted maine Sails, weighed anchors, and away they cut through the deep,
where we will leave them to the favor of the wind, and the Seas.

Meleagar, having sent his Ambassadors for the King of Portugal, ralls his
Nobles, and chief officers together, and told them, that the tenth day of that
present month should be the Nuptial day: and bade them proclaim a feast,
Iusts, and Turnies, and inuit all their neighbor Princes, with the chief of
his own dominions; and that it was Meleagars command and will, the Court gates
should stand open, and receive all comers for the space of twenty days; as
well for the royal entertainment of Ambrosia, as for honor of his Country:
his Nobles being no less than willing to further his pretense, very diligently
according to the Kings command, prepared all things in readiness: where we will
leave them attending Ambrosia's coming, and turn to Titana, who in sight of
her new love Pirismus, seemed no less then fraught with the wanton feakes of
love, to lead that toyish fool into a purblind paradise, where in the end she
meant to leave him champing of Cupids bridle: and in her fathers sight she
seemed so abundant in her love, that she almost made his gray hairs begin
afresh to bud, and to bloome forth youthful blossoms again, in so much that
it is impossible to conceive the inward joy, that he received by their outward
ioying; and though she forced herself to be joyous and pleasant in her fathers
and Pirismus presence, yet was she forced to batefull melancholy, and hateful
grief in their absence: well it happened that in few days after, there came
news to Meleagars Court, that Ambrosia was come within two days sailing to
Calidon, and by contrary winds forced to cast anchor, and lie there for the
winds return. Meleagar hearing this news, caused a Fleet of his best ships to
be made ready; which being done, he himself, and Pirismus with others boarded
the Fleet, and Titana should have gone too, but the Seas unwilling to cross
her submissiue Love, with adverse hate, caused a tempestuous storm to rise,
insomuch that the very sight of Neptunes crowns cast her into a despairing
fear, the which her father seeing, caused her to return to the Court again,
and they took their Voyage toward Ambrosia, where we will leave them to their
fortune, and turn to Titana again.

Who being so long absented from her love Theseus, and too often presented with
her hated Pirismus, like a true Lover discontented, desired to walk and sit
alone to meditate: on the back side of her fathers Palace, there was a very
large Garden, which had diverse doors to enter in at; this Garden was the place
where Theseus did use to meet her, which place she held most convenient, and
fit for her to passion out her griefs: when the afternoon came, she walked
all alone into the Garden with the wonted place where Theseus was wont full
often to embrace her, with many lovely kisses, hoping that the Gods seeing her
distress, would relieve her want, and as they had bin witnesses to her vows,
so she hoped they would be favorers to her pretense: and thus walked thee a
while commenting in these dull perplexities, till at last, her passions were so
urgent with her, she could no longer suppress them, but safe her down on a
green bank, and burst out her passions in these terms.

Ah Titana, thou unfortunate wretch, art thou a Kings Daughter, and live thus a
slave to Cupid? better were thou a country wench, to enjoy their lovely
pleasure* than a courtly mistress, thus wrapped in troward misery: now may
thou see the destinies plague thee for thy disobedience. Ah sigh Titana, draw
dry those two crystal fountains from whence these pearled streams descend,
to ouerflow these tender cheeks of thine: love Pirismus, and in loving him
thou love thy self. Ah no, I dare not; Pirismus, no: it is Theseus, and none
but Theseus shall have my true love: Ah fool that thou art, to fix so fondly;
thou know Theseus is a Grecian, and Greeks thy fathers foes: then stick to
thy fathers Election, and love Pirismus, for in loving him thou shall enjoy the
worlds content. Ah no, I have made my solemn vows to Theseus, and will keep
them, it is not worldly content alone that I desire, but Theseus love, the
patron of my meditating thoughts, the Couch of my weary ioyntures rest, and the
Crown of my earthly glory.

When she had thus breathed forth her solitary passions, from the gray Morn,
to the red Even, Zephyr began to draw the melancholy curtains of portendous
night, which caused Titana to depart, who having taken her leave of the Orange
and Lemmon Trees, which only did accompany her all that day, returns to her
chamber again, where she immures her self in contemplation.

At happened that in two days after, her father Ambrosia, Pirismus, and all
their followers arrived on Calidon shores: and Pageants, Drums and Trumpets
were provided, with sweet persumes, and Frankincense the streets were sweetened
for their passage, which greatly pleased Ambrosia: so that they suddenly
arrived at Meleagars Court, where they were most sumptuously entertained with
banquets, and feasting: which being done, Meleagar willing to make known by
outward shows, how he was possessed within ward joys: leapt from his chair of
state, and fetched his Daughter Titana, leading her into Ambrosia's presence by
the middle: Titana, seeing her supposed sire, feigned on him a smile, and
withal to grace the dimples of her cheeks* she gives them a comely and modest
blush, and with a low and reverent courtesy, the old obeisance to King
Ambrosia, the which he seeing, suddenly stepped to her, took her in his arms,
and lovingly embraced her with many courteous and royal speeches. Pirismus who
had all this while markd her behavior, blessed his Fortune, and thanked the gods
for his good access: when he had so done, he thought himself to have most
right to her, took her aside to the further side of the Room where he
sported his blind folly, and caught at shadows, yet to his hearts content,
and both their Fathers increased joy: but alas to poor Titana's heart
breaking, though she feigned a smile in her fathers presence, yet was she
forced to weep in his absence: Meleagar was so fraught with joy, that he
thought every day a year that his Daughter went unmarried, yet past he six
days more in keeping Ambrosia company, and showing him the Pastimes and
pleasures that he chiefly took delight in: the mean time he called to him
his chief Officers and Nobles, and demands if all things were ready for the
Nuptial; the which they all answered, I. When Meleagar heard that, he was very
joyful, and presently makes Ambrosia, Pirismus and Titana acquainted with his
pretense (which was this) that on the seventh day following being the sixteen
day of the month, he did purpose to accomplish the marriage betwixt Pirismus
and Titana, the which they all seemed to be very joyful and glad of, save
only Titana, yet she seemed no less than joyful in the sight of her Father,
but in her chamber she passioned whole rivers of tears from her crystal
eyes, where weel leave her to the favor of the gods, and turn to Theseus.

Who all this while, has been very busy, and laborious in his careful
affairs, and having accomplished his business, finished his purpose, and laid
the ship ready in the Haven, is very desirous to speak with his love Titana,
but his father being present, he could find no opportunity fitting to make
escape forth, which bred hateful melancholy; in so much that he immured up
himself in his chamber, to solicit sadness. Fortune smiling at his folly,
dandled him once again on her indulgent knee: It happened at that instant, a
Noble man of Aegeus Court, riding through a Forest, that was some eight miles
distant from Athens, espied a wild Boar, and knowing the King loved the sport
of hunting, as well as the one half of his kingdom, came riding post to the
King, and made report of his business: the king hearing him, caused sudden
preparation to be made, he having a very fair Palace standing in the midst of
the Forest, determined to go thither to bed that night, the which preparation
being made, and all things ready he calls for Theseus, but he had heard some
inkling of his fathers hunting progress, and how he was upon going, feigned
himself sick, and took physic: when word was brought to the King that
Theseus could not go, he demanded the occasion, they answered he was not
well, he took physic. The King hearing that news and loath to delay time,
and so lose his sport, called his Nobles about him, where they mounted their
Steeds and rode toward the Forest, where we will leave them to their sport, and
turn to Titana.

Who now has little hope to enjoy Theseus love, for the six days are al most
expired, and the seventh is the Nuptial day appointed, which was the next day
following, yet being the last day of her hope, she went one morning to walk in
the Garden to seek her Theseus, bearing a sharp Engine in her hand,
determining with her self, that as she had made her vows to Theseus, none
should enjoy her love but Theseus: and where she did protest those vows to
Theseus, there she meant to sacrifice her blond to the Gods for Theseus sake,
where we will leave her.

Theseus hearing his father was gone, puts on a disguised suite of apparel,
and secretly conueyes himself forth at the Court gates by Junia's means,
determining never to come in again, sends Junia to the Haven, where the ship
lay, and caused him to attend his coming there; which done, his walks toward
the Court of Meleagar, which was at that time near adjoining to the City of
Atheus: he being arrived at the Court, suddenly makes means to enter the
garden: which being entered, he walked to the farther side, where he was wont
to meet his Love Titana: he was no sooner approacht, but he spied her where
she sat, leaning her head on her hand, as though she had been asleep: he no
less then glad to see her, began to step hastily to her, but even as he was
ready to touch her, he perceived that she was weeping and lamenting very
grievously to her self: breathing out her passions in these terms.

Ah unfortunate Titana, and therefore unfortunate wretch, borne under the
destinies displeasure, and therefore crossed with Fortunes frowns, bound to
Theseus by love, therefore pincht with care by fate: yet Theseus, Ah sweet
Theseus, is dearer far than my self is to my self, and none shall deflowre
me of his Virgins Rose, except this fatal Engine; since protestations, vows,
and bonds are made, and sealed with the wax of Loves sweet lips, it is Theseus,
and none but Theseus shall enjoy my Love.

Theseus, seeing her in that dull perplexity, and so metamorphosed, stand
astonished at that sight, and had not the power to go backward nor forward, he
was driven to such an exigent: feign he would go back to lose the sight of so
grievous a prospect, and fainer go to her to know the cause, and seek
redress, yet could he do neither, but stood still in a dull ecstasy, half
dead with grief: till at the last she removed her head, and looked up after a
mournful fashion, as Phillis looked for Demophoon; and casting aside her
blubbered eyes, she espied her Theseus: she rose off the bank whereon she sat
making her complaints: threw away her Fatal Engine, took him; about the neck
and kissed him, smiled, and thus bespake him; Ah Theseus, art thou come to
prosecute my weal or woe? (Quoth Theseus) thy weal I hope, with hearts
content sweet Love: but I pray thee sweetheart what is the occasion of these
thy preambling passions, thus sob'd with sourcing fears? Oh said Titana,
sinister Fortune has cast me into adverse perplexities: for since thou
departedst from these sweet imbracements of mine, Fortune has frowned on our
pretense: quoth Theseus, how sweet Love? Titana feigned to smile, yet forced to
weep, thus began:

Oh Theseus, my Father sent Ambassadors to Ambrosia King of Portugal, to
entreat a marriage between his Son Pirismus, and thy love Titana; his father
being as willing to yield, as my father to demand, presently sends over his son
Pirismus, as a pledge of his promise, by the return of my Fathers Ambassadors,
and now is come himself to accomplish the match: when my father heard the
return of his Embassage, and saw Pirismus, he called me to him, where he
opened the whole volume of his pretense, persuading me of the Princes entire
love, his rare accomplishments, and how happy I was to enjoy the love of so
rich a friend, with many such capital persuasions; in so much that in the end,
I did reply this obstinate answer: I could not love, it was the only thing
that I did hate, with such like words, that at last he fell from kind
persuasions, and fell into thundering threats, and in such frantic manner,
that I durst no longer withstand him, but gave consent, and promised to be
ready whenever he pleased to appoint the time, the which he was very joyful
to hear, and appointed the Nuptial to be the sixteenth day of this month,
which is the next day following: yet good Theseus account not my behavior
light, though I have promised love to two men at once: but know this dear
love, it is the one is steadfastly to abide, the other but falsely to delude: for
if I should have stood obstinate and perverse, denying him; then should I have
had his perpetual hate, and in having his hate like poor Jove with Argus
should still be watched and looked after, that I the harder should find
opportunity to depart with thee to Tunis: therefore to avoid suspicion, I made
him a feigned promise, but still brave Theseus resting at thy command, and
obeying as thy hand-maide, i will live and die with thee; and with that takes him
about the neck, and does so pay and repay him with kisses, that she half
smothers him. Theseus heard her politic answer; hearing her witty reply, and
seeing her love so constant, much commended her wit, but more pitied her
grief, desired her to patience, and wishing her not to be so passionate,
promised her that every tear that she had for him spent, should from him
return ten thousand joys again: and quoth Theseus I have provided a ship,
and all things necessary for our passage, which lyee ready in the haven, and if
you are ready and willing, now there is a fit gate of Wind to transport us
from the Grecian shores to Tunis. Quoth Titana, my dear love, it is the only
thing I desire, through fire and water to follow thee sweet Theseus. Quoth
Theseus, fair Titana, this night about the hour of twelve, I will come and
meet thee here, for then I hold it the best time to depart without suspicion
of any, therefore sweet heart make no delays, neither for Jewels, or rich
array, lest that we omitting this opportunity, may stay long for she like
again, for I have all things needful already provided. Titana hearing these
joyful tidings, was exceedingly fraught with boundless joy, thinking that
every hour before night came would prove a year, insomuch that the time being
appointed, and fearful to be espied in their private parley, after many
lovely enterchanges, and sweet eclipsed lips, they parted, where we will leave
them a while ruminating on their ensuing fortune, and turn to Pirismus.

Who now is providing Robes for the Nuptial, which I doubt will prove his
funeral, yet love being so urgent with him, it casts a mist before the eyes of
his folly, in so much, that he thinks every smile that Titana lends him, is a
promise of perfection: but alas poor fool, that such infancy should rest in
such experienced years: but it is not to be marvelled at, for Cupid does greater
miracles than this sometimes, for he forces the bondslaue to love, and blinds
the eyes with folly: he makes the young old, and the old become young again; he
cleares the ageds eyes, and make the youthful dim: therefore blame I not
Pirismus, nor yet commend him, but as he deserves, so let fortune attribute her
favors unto him, where we will leave him a spectator to his adverse hopes, and
turn to Titana.

Who being mindful of her promise to Theseus, as soon as the Court was quiet,
and every man betook him to his rest, Titana very carefully had respect that
none might see, nor hear her, stayed till the dead time of the night, which
was much about the hour that Theseus had appointed her to come: she hearing no
noise, nor seeing no light throughout all the Court, having a door that opened
into the Garden, she secretly unlocks it, and away she goes to the wonted
place, where she finds Theseus attending her coming, and without any great
circumstance took her by the arm, and led her forth at a back gate that
Titana had given him the key of before, where his man Junia stayed his coming
with his Gelding: he suddenly mounted on his horses back, took Titana up
behind him, and rode to the haven where the ship lay, which was about a mile
distant from that place; he no sooner came there, but the Mariners were ready
with their Cockboate to receive them aboard: where being coucht together in a
Cabin, they past away the time in recounting their old loves, till their man
Junia came: he had no sooner boarded the ship, but the Mariners hoysting their
mainsailes, weighed anchors and halled into the deep, where we will leave them
to the favor of the wind and the Seas, and return to Meleagar, and the
Bridegroom Pirismus.

The morn being come, and Phoebus saluted the day with his glorious Beams:
Pirismus starts him from the imbracements of his bed, to rouse Titana from her
nightly couth; he being entered her chamber, and saw she was stirring before
him, and forsaken her chamber, he thus began:

What hungry fiend or croaking night worm, durst be so bold as to disturb my
Titana from her rest, till I Pirismus gave her the Bon Jour.

What loving Beast, or bleating Lamb-kin, durst attempt my Love. Titanaes
unrest, before that I bestowed the. Mornings salutation on her?

What Scythian shepherd durst be so bold, with his hoopes and cries to fright
my Titana from her native sleep, before I enterchanged a kiss with her, to
embrace this Nuptial morn?

What Indian Ravens, and Grecian Larkes, what Canary-Finch, or silver Swans
durst with their harmoniall tunes entice my love from forth her bed before I
came?

But yet me thinks, I feel no hate proceed from forth their chirping blasts,
therefore surely thou do misconceiue them: for thy love is gone to recreate
her self in the garden this fresh morn: and is espied by these loving
creatures; and to adorn her and her Nuptial, they all accord, striking the
sweet relaces of their consorted tunes, to give the Heavens an Echo of their
joy, and thy Titana the harmony of so happy a joy.

When he had thus passioned a while, he was returning forth of her chamber
again, even as he was parting, comes Meleagar, calling hastily, for his
Daughter Titana, and meeting Pirismus, asked him for Titana, who answered, she
was not in her chamber: Meleagar returning again enquired, and sent about the
Court and Garden to seek her, but no news could be heard of her, in so much
that in the end Meleagar began to fear some ill was betided her, and that
she had been walking late, and so was taken by some of Aegeus men and kept
prisoner: well this conceit took such effect, that he sends Ambassadors to
Aegeus Court, to demand the question, if Titana were taken prisoner by any of
his Soldiers, who had an answer no: returning again, told Meleagar their
answer: they had no sooner delivered their message, but there comes a post from
Aegeus Court, to demand if they had not taken Theseus prisoner, the which had
his answer delivered him in the same manner, no: which done, he returns
again, Meleagar; who thought to have feasted, and made a triumphant Nuptial;
now casts often his sumptuous Robes, and put on mourning weeds, and instead of
delicious feasting, imbraceth mournful fasting: Pirismus, who fed on the
beauty of Titana, as the Camelion feeds on the air, was frantic at this
sudden ecstasy. Ambrosia, from his aged eyes shed many tears, to see Meleagar
so grieved, and his Son so impatient: the guests that were invited, at this
sudden change were cast into dumps and dull perplexities, in so much that you
might have past through the Court to and fro, and hardly have heard a word
spoken, but have seen many a weeping eye, which held for the space of four
days; the fifth day he caused proclamation to be made, that whosoever could but
bring tidings where Titana is, or what is become of her, he would bestow a
living on him worth an hundred pound a year, during his life: this being
proclaimed, at that time there was a Sailer that should have gone in the ship
with them, but he had some hindrance, he being forth of the ship when Theseus
and Titana boarded it, he stayed something long, and Theseus and his love
thought it seven year till they were put from the shore, lest fortune should
chance to bewray their pretense, he would stay no longer, but commanded them to
put off and lanch into the deep: So that this Sailer was left behind, and
hearing this great promise of the King, determined to go instantly, and
inform the King of her departure: but you must note this, he did it more for
the benefit of the Living, than to certify the King: he being arrived at the
Court, made means to come to the speech of the King, he being in presence,
did his duty, and as far as he could he unfolded the matter in every point:
the King hearing how it was, and that she was gone with Theseus, began to be
in an exceeding great rage, in so much that the Sayler wished himself forth of
his presence, though he never had his gift: yet the King being a noble Prince,
bestowed his promise on him, and sent him away a joyful man.

Meleager, though he heard tidings of his Daughter, yet could it no whit
persuade him to patience, but rather kindled the hot fire of war against Aegeus
for a revenge, because he had but one only daughter, and she to be carried
away by an enemies son. Aegeus missing his son Theseus, and hearing that he
was gone with Meleagars daughter Titana, he swear a bloody revenge on
Meleagar: and thus the two fathers fell into bloody passions, in so much that
all Achaia, Calidon, and Greece were up in arms against each other, where
we will leave them a while, and turn to Pirismus.

Who hearing of the ungrateful departure of Titana, presently betakes him to
his chamber, where he sat^ ruminating on her, and her departure with Theseus,
in so much that he persuaded himself never to return to Portugal again,
since Titana had deceived him: well, he being as it were half frantic, grew
careless what became of himself, and in this discontented humor sitting
alone in his chamber, thus breathed out his passions: Titanaes love, did lend
thee life,
Titanaes hate will cause thee death:
Titanaes parting, has sharpt the knife,
That now must stop thy vital breath.
Titana farewell, for love I die,
As here these lines will testify.


When he had thus passioned a while; he draws his fatal Engine, and stabs
himself: when Meleagar and Ambrosia were sitting at dinner, Pirismus was
called for, but he could not be found, in the end they looked in his chamber,
where they found him most grievously murdered: news was presently carried to
the Kings table, who hearing of this pitious tidings, caused him to be brought
into the presence, and sent for Doctors and Surgeons, but all in vain, for he
was quite gone, and past recovery: they seeing no help, caused preparation for
the funeral, which, all things being in a readiness, those neighbor Princes
which were invited to the Nuptial, were now entreated to his funeral: these
solemn obsequies and funeral being ended every man took his leave, and
departed: but Ambrosia stayed till the beginning of the next month, and when
the time came, he departed toward Portugal, with a heavier heart than he came
toward Greece withal, when he had taken his leave of Meleagar, he boarded the
Fleet, weighed anchors, and away they c^t through the deep, where we will leave
him and turn to Titana and Theseus.

Whom fortune begins to sport her self with in their adversities, for as she
had smiled on them a while, and given them a full wind fitting to transport
them to the haven of their desire: so now she meant to frown on them, and
give them a Calm; when as they lay thus becalmed, fortune who loves to sport
herself in the variable accidents of love, brought it thus to pass: certain
Galleys that were Robbers under the French King, espied this Grecian ship, and
thinking to have some rich prize, made out, and gave onset, commanding them to
yield: the Grecians being calm could not make away from them, yet although too
weak, Theseus stoutly denied to be boarded, and fought it out to the utmost:
yet in the end they boarded the ship, and bestowed Titana and Theseus under the
hatches amongst the Sailers, and then rifled the ship of all their rich Jewels:
which done, they took the Sailors and carried them into their Galleys, and
chained them fast, and made Gallislaues of them, when they had so done, they
took Thesues into one of the Galleys, but the chief commanded that they
should offer no rigor at all unto him, for he saw by his behavior, that he
was of good birth and parentage which made him the more favorable unto him.
Theseus desired of the general that he would entertain, or suffer Titana to
come into the Gallie to him, and fare as he fared, they both desired and
entreated, but it could not be granted, which caused poor Titanaes eyes all
blubbred with tears, and almost dead for fear and grief, but all would not
prevail: the chief general sent half a dozen shake rags with the ship and
her to Roane, where they stripped her out of her Princely Robes and put her into
beggars Rags, and when they came to the shore, they gave her three ducats,
and turned her off there in a strange Country that she neither knew their
language, nor had she any friends there: but since her fortune was so allotted
unto her, for her own part shee-tooke it very patiently, but when she called
to mind her Theseus she wept bitterly, but since there was no remedy, she meant
to pass and spend her life in Pilgrimage, where we will leave her traveling
toward Italy, and turn to Theseus.

Whose chief solliciter is careful grief, for his poor love Titana, and is
forced to live as a rouing Pirate on the Seas: it happened about six months
after they chanced to meet with some Merchants of Venice, on whom these Pirates
gave onset, these merchants being well provided, breathed defiance on them, at
which these Pirates took great disdain and discharged upon them, the
Merchants seeing that, began to play upon them, Piece after Piece, so long
that in the end they overcame them, and took two of their Galleys: in which
two, Theseus, and Junia were Prisoners, fortune favoring Theseus for Titanaes
sake, bare her Target of defense before him, that he escapt with life, but
Junia was slain: when the Merchants had thus rifled the Galleys, being near
the coast of Bohemia, sent the Gallie-slaues, and others that were prisoners in
the Galleys, to the shore side, and set them a land to shift for themselves;
then had Theseus but half a Ducket to buy him meat and drink, and his
clothes were but simple Rags God knows, yet glad he was that he was so
happily landed, but yet poor Titana, the very thought of her struck him half
dead, he determined never to return unless he met with his love Titana, but
would spend his life in Pilgrimage till death claimed his right: where we will
leave him traveling in Germany, and turn to Meleagar.

Who is in the field with Troops of Soldiers, waging war against Aegeus:
but his mother envying him, for killing her two Brothers, Plexipus and Toxie,
had sworn on him to be revenged, yet studied she a long time, and knew not how
to be cruel enough in her revenge, till in the end, she called to mind a
brand that the destinies put into the fire, when she lay in childbed of
Meleagar: which brand was of this merciless force and power, by the destinies
charms, that when this brand was in the fire burnt, Meleagar should consume
and burn to ashes for the destinies spun his fatal thread at his birth day,
and did put this brand in the fire, to take him the first day of his birth* but
Althoea, to prevent it, took it forth again, and laid it up very charily,
till now she meant to make use of it, as thus.

Meleager being in the field against Aegeus in fierce and cruel battle, and
having given an overthrow to Aegeus, there was great rejoicing, and Bonfires
made thorowout all Calidon, with ringing Bells, and such like. Thesties
Daughter seeing so much laid on the fire for Meleagar, and to show the love
they bare to the King her Son: she thought whilst the fire was burning to
bestow one slicke on him, to show the hate she bare to him, although she died
for company with him herself, she cared not so she might be revenged on him:
after she be thought her self, she steps to a chest where she safely had laid
this brand, and takes it forth, and with a zeal to mischief, stretched out her
fatal arm, and threw it in the fire, which being done, she thus began: Behold
ye triple goddesses
Of wrecke, ye hell hounds three*
Behold you all this furious fact,
And sacrifice of me.
I wrecke and do against all right,
With death must death be paid:
On mischief mischief must be heapt,
On curse must curse be laid.
Confounded let this wicked house,
With heaped sorrows be:
Shall Oenie joy his happy Son
In honor for the sea:
And Thesties mourn bereft of his*
Nay better yet it were,
That each with other company
In mourning you should bear:
Now brothers ghosts and souls new dead,
I wish no more but you
To feel the solemn obsequies,
which I prepare as now.
This said.

She turned away her face,
And with a trembling hand;
Did cast amid the fire,
This death-full burning brand.


MEleager being absent, and busied about his warlike affairs, thinks not of
his mothers cruelty, but following his urgent occasions with very attentive
care, it happened not long after as he was walking alone to recreate himself,
upon a sudden he felt an extreme pain in his belly, it wart more and more, in
so much, that he did plainly perceive that his bowels burnt with flames of
secret fire, but yet denied he to die, but bare it out with a Princely courage,
for it grieved him to die so cowardly without shedding his blood: yet death
being so predominant, and potent over him, he began to yield, and with sighing
sobs, called on his aged Father, which with age lay bed rid seven years
before, and then with grief departed; then called he on his brother, and his
sisters, and lastly on his mother: by this time his pain increased so extreme
with the fire, that he sell therewith again, and at that self same instant
quite extinguished were they both: and as his body burnt to ashes, the glowing
coals his spirit from him drew? Then drooped stately Calidon, both young and
old did mourn, the Lords and Commons did lament, and married wives their hair
like franticks rent from off their heads, for grief of king Meleagars death.

The folk of Calidon not so sufficed, gathers the ashes of his consumed body,
and entombs them up, and makes a solemn Funeral; nay, the blackest dismal
day that ere was known in Calidon or Achaia, and on his Tomb engraues an
Epitaph to this effect.

The Epitaph.
Here lies the famous King of Calidon,
Which for his fame the worlds mirror won,
That Achaian land can say, though he be gone,
Foul fall the Author, and of this mothers doom:
Who passes by, and chance these lines to read,
Curse them that caused Meleagar lie here dead.
Having thus done, every man returns again to his abiding place. Aegeus
hearing that Meleagar was dead, provided a great host of men, and marches
toward Calidon, and ouer-runs their Camps, and puts their Soldiers to the
sword, so that in a short space he gets the chief part of Calidon, and still
inuades further into the Country, and much blood has been spilt, and a great
deal more is like to be, but the winter being come, they have left the field,
and lie now in Garrison till the next spring, where weel leave them and turn to
Titana.

Who now has spent full some years in Pilgrimage, from Country to Country in
very poor manner, and now it was her fortune to come into Germany, and as she
was traveling up into the Country, she chanced to come to Fuesen, where being
late the purposed to lie there all that night, yet knowing not how to get a
lodging, for she had no money, sat down and wept bitterly: as she thus sat
washing her tender cheeks with salt bring tears, the high Constable of Fuesen
was passing by and saw a young Maid sit lamenting, and wringing her hanes in
such grievous manner, pitied her, and demanded of her what she was, and
whence; she answered she was a Gentleman's daughter of Athens: he demanded
what she made so far from home then, and how she came there? the which she
answered, that there was a young Gentleman of the same City that was in love
with her* and she with him, but their parents would not give consent,
whereupon we determined to transport our selves into Spain, where we both have
friends, and there to enjoy the fruition of our loves: as we were passing from
Greece to Spain, we met with pirates that rifled and robbed us of all we had,
set me on land in France, and carried my love away, I know not whither: and
these, all these griefs am I possessed withal. The high Constable pitied her
very much, asked her if she could write and read, she answered I, he demanded
if she could sow: me said I: quoth the high Constable, will thou be content to
dwell with me, and teach my children for a year or two or longer as thou shall
think good? Titana being weary of traveling, and was ashamed to go beg,
thought she could not do better than to serve him, till she had gotten money
and clothes to her back, answered him she was very well consent, if it pleased
him to accept of her service; the which be answered very willingly with all his
heart, so he caused her to follow him home, where he instantly strips her out
of rags, and put her on good apparel, which done, she settles herself very
closely to her needle, and teaches his children, that in short time, she grew
famous for her womanship, civil, modest and Gentlewoman like behavior, in so
much that she might have had diverse wealthy and rich marriages, only upon the
good report that was spread abroad of her, but still she refused all* and would
accept of none, yet all this time she never made it known, that she was a
Kings daughter, but kept it close, never meaning to reveal it, but still
following her business with careful diligence, where we will leave her, and turn
to Theseus.

Who being in very poor estate, is entertained by the Lands-grave of Heffen:
and serving him for the space of three years, greatly grew in credit with him,
in so much that he would do nothing without the advice of his man Peregrino,
(for so he fained his name to be) the Lands-grave taking such on extraordinary
liking unto him, (as truly to say the truth, he deserved the love of all:)
never had any Iusts and Turnies but his Peregrino should be one, I, and still
did put them to the foil, whatsoever they were that waged against him,
insomuch that in few years he began to be admired of all; not only for his
rare seats at arms, but also for his Gentleman like accomplishments, civil,
and modest behavior: that in the end, the Lands-grave began to misdoubt that
he came of some noble descent, and by some discontent parted with his Country
and went as a Pilgrim to seek his fortune: well, it happened not long after, he
took an occasion to walk after supper, in a garden that stand on the back
side of his Palace, with a meaning to demand of his man, what Countri man he
was, and of what Parentage; calls for his Peregrino, and charged him to tell
him the truth of a question he meant to asked him. Peregrino maruelling at this
sudden charge, answered thus: My dread Sovereign, as near as I can I will
certify you with the truth (quoth the Grave) but this then, tell of what
Parentage thou co^mest on, and what was the occasion of thy coming into this
Country? for thou toldest me thou wast a Grecian borne: (quoth Peregrino) my
Sovereign Lord truly so I am, and my father was a poor Gentleman, and the
occasion that I came hither was this: there was a gentlewoman dwelling in
Athens whom I dearly loved, and so did she me, I being a younger Brother, and
had but small means to maintain her, her friends being rich, would not give
consent at all; we having but little hope to enjoy the fruition of our loves in
Greece, provided a little Bark to transport our selves into Spain, which
being done, as we were passing the Ocean, there came certain Pirates that were
running on the Sea, and took us, and robbed us of all that we had; this done,
they sent my love away toward the coast of France, and clapped me into a Galley,
where I was forced to manage an Oar, till I was releas^d by a Venetian
Merchant, who landed me on the coast of Bohemia, and I purposing to spend my
life in pilgrimage, w^ndring up and down, it was my fortune to come hither,
where I fortunately happened into your service; he thus ending his speech wept
very bitterly: the Lands-grave being very sorry to see him weep and lament so
bitterly demanded the occasion of his passions, who answered the loss of my
love. Quoth the Lands-grave, come leave off this womanish weeping, and remain
with me, and thou shall never want for any thing so long as I am able to give
thee: well after these and such like words, they departed to their rest.

At that instant, there was attendant in the house of Alphonsus the
Lands-grave, a young Gentlewoman whose name was Impio, this Gentlewoman came of
very good Parentage, the wishtly viewing, noting the excellency of Peregrinoes
face, presently fell in love with him; but having but small acquaintance, could
not tell how to unfold her mind unto him, but thus she past the time for the
space of half a year, and could find no time nor place fitting for to
disclose her love: till at last she watched him when he went to walk in the
Garden alone, and lightly skips after him, he espying her coming after him,
returns again and met her, giving her the time of the day, and she the like
to him again, so that in the end there past and repast many questions between
them: in so much that at last my young Gentlewoman mistress Impio, grew so
impudent with love, that she could bridle her passionate affection no longer
but desired him to sit down on a green bank that was by them, for she told
him that she had good news to tell him: he being no less then willing to
hear good news, according to her desire he sat down, where suddenly she
sat down by him, where she declares the whole volume of her mind unto him.
Peregrino hearing her so passionate in her terms, wondered much at these
sudden accidents or what should be the occasion that should provoke her to such
inordinate feakes, which in his conceit ouerflowed the bounds of modesty, yet
would he not seem to reject her for her folly, but mildly persuaded her to be
content and pacify her self with patience, for he was already provided, yet
did he humbly thank her for her good will, but grant her marriage he could
not: yet she would not be so answered, but began to prosecute it a fresh
again, and like Venus, when she wooed Adonis, strove with him for a kiss, in
so much that he ashamed of her folly, flung away from her; Impio seeing him
gone, meant not to let him go so, but on the next morning, she goes to his
chamber, and in the like manner begins again. Peregrino seeing her, and
hearing her in her old tune, would not stay, but flings from her in an angry
fume; yet she would not give him over nor let him rest, but still would be
troubling and molesting him, in so much that in the end, he told her of her
immodesty very sharply, and told her, that if she came any more troubling him
with the like matter again, he would declare her name to his Lord Alphonsus.
Impio hearing this hasty check and rebuke of Peregrino whom she loved so
dearly, turned now her love to hate, and as in former time she had sought
means to get his love, so now ten times more busy she was, to seek means to
destroy his life: Pirigrino whom fortune had turned on her wheel so often with
frowns and smiles, meant once more, to cast him into adverse perplexities, and
for the better conuoyance of it, she brought it thus to pass.

At that instant there lay in Fueson one of the Emperors of Germany, who had to
his Daughter a very fair and proper young gentle woman: this Virgin being
known to the Duke of Brunswicke, and he having but one only Son thought it a
good match for him: being resolved in this opinion, very speedily sends
Ambassadors to this Emperor, to entreat a marriage between his Son and his
Daughter; to which the Emperor being very willing, told them, with all his
heart, and had them pray him to come and accomplish it as soon as he could, for
his business would be so urgent with him shortly, that he should hardly attiend
their coming else: they received their unswere, and hasted bark to tha Duke
their Master, where they made report of their Embassage: when the Duke heard
each joyful tidings, with all expedition he caused preparation for the
Nuptial, which being all finished, and all things ready, they took their
journey to the Emperors Court, being then in Fueson. The Emperor hearing they
were comming^, invited diverse of the chief of Germany to the Nuptial: whereof
Alphonsus, the Lands-grave of Hessen amongst the rest was one: well, within few
days after the Duke of Brunswicke arrived at the Emperors Court in Fueson,
this Nuptial day being past, and their royalty ended, every man taking her
leave of the Emperor departed, only the Duke of Brunswick, the Lands-grave of
Hessen, and their followers.

It happened in a short time after, Peregrino being chief attendant on
Alphonsus; and Impio on his fair Lady: fortune began to turn her wheel, and
raise an adverse fate on poor submissiue Peregrino in this manner this wicked
lust sulphering Impio, whose heart was fraught with burning hate, had long
studied how she might bring him to disgrace, or take his life from him, because
he did reject her for her folly: in so much that in the end, she agreed thus;
for to inuit him to her chamber to Dinner, where if she could obtain love at
his hands, it was as much as she desired, otherwise she meant to cry out, and
say he would ravish her, and so by that means be revenged on him: she being
profoundly grounded on this hellish pretense, thought it long ere she were
acting it: yet she considered this, that if she should do so having no
witness of it, it was but her I and his no: and she saw that he was so in
favor, that he should be believed before her, therefore to bring her matter
the better to pass, she hires a young man. and gives him fifty crowns to come
and swear against him: when she was thus provided of a witness, she inuites
Peregrino to come the next day to dinner: He thinking no hurt, nor imagining
the mischief she pretended to him, very courteously thanked her, and said he
would make bold to trouble her: with this answer the returned, and called this
yongman to her, and told him where he should stand to hear her, when she
called him; and what he should say: well, this being done, on the next day
according to his promise, Peregrino came to dinner, where they sat all alone,
and were very merry all the dinner time: when they had sufficiently allayed the
hunger of their stomachs, she took away the table her self, and had none to
attend her at all, which made Peregrino muse much thereat, when she had thus
taken away, and set things in order she came to Peregrino, and began her wonted
tune again and again, but still he denied her; yet would she take it for no
answer, but still importuned him for love, in so much that he began to be very
angry with her, and began to go forth of her chamber: the seeing no hope to
obtain love of him, she swear she would have his life: she steps to him
again, and thus besets him. Thou fair faced Peregrino, can thou deny a
Wench that comes of gentle blood, no vassal nor runnagate, but bred and borne
in gentility? therefore read the margent of my brows, and thou shall see that
thy birth is not equivalent with mine; thou know how my Lord and Master
entertained thee the other day, as a Pilgrim that meant to spend his life in
Pilgrimage, and wilt you reject, me that am a Gentlewoman of good account? no
no, Pirigrino; remember thy self what thou were when thou camst hither; and
yield Impio love. Pirigrino hearing her so insatiable in this vain attempt,
began to wrest away from her, whereupon she cried out, help, help, he will
ravish me: with that steps in the young man that she had appointed to bear
false witness against him, and cries out for help too; and suddenly came
running in diverse of the Court, and laid hands on him, and news was carried to
the Lands-grave, and the Emperor, of Pirigrino's fact: Alphonsus very sorry to
hear this tidings, yet would not seek to excuse him, but suffered him to go
to prison, where he lay for the space of six days, the seventh, according to
the order of their law, he was had in examination; and for the love Alphonsus
bare him, he would hear the trial of the matter himself, that he should have
no wrong: but when he heard how evidently the matter was proved against him, by
this rong fellows means, that came in, and swear directly against him, it was
a fact yt was so heinous, and not to be forgiven, their laws were so strict
against it, when he had thus considered with himself, the greatness of the
offense, and the seuerenesse of their Law, he held his tongue and suffered the
Law to pass on him, which overthrew him, and the sentence of death was
pronounced against him, that the next market day, there should be in the midst
of the market place, a stake erected; to which stake, he must be bound fast
with Iron chains, and so done, fire kindled about him, and so burn to death:
the law having thus past on him, and the sentence of death pronounced against
him, they carried him back to the prison, until the next market day: in the
mean while they made ready the stake, and set it in the midst of the market,
and when the day came, according to their order, they brought him to the place
of execution, where was gathered together two or three hundred to see him
executed; he was so beloved that there was many a weeping eye for him, and
cried out to the Sheriffs, saying, it was a great pity so brave a man should
die for so small an offense: yet they could not do withal, but caused him to
be tied to the stake; which done, they laid straw and faggots about him, and
were kindling the fire about him; yet did he smile and laugh on the people, and
prayed them to pray for him, the which they did all very heartily he provided
himself to die: even as the fire was kindling, there came riding by a Knight
of Athens by chance, as he was traveling into France, espying a multitude of
people, gathered together, turns his horse-head, and rides to the place to see
the occasion: when he came near to the place, and seeing a man bound fast to
the stake, he began to look very earnestly on him, in so much that in the end,
he began to persuade himself that it was Theseus: thrusts in amongst the
people and thus spoke (Prince Theseus) Theseus suddenly looked up, maruelling
who it was that knew his name so perfectly, looking on this knight called him
to mind, and answered, Horatio. Quoth the Knight Horatio, for so was his name:
my Noble Liege, what make you here thus bound with chains so near your death?
Quoth Theseus I have been falsely accused, and now condemned to die. Horatio
entreated the Sheriffs to hold back the fire a little, whilst he went to the
Emperor, to certify him what he was, for he is a kings son, and falsely
accused. The Sheriffs, although they were to have done the execution by an
hour, yet for that love they bore to him* they pulled back the fire: Horatio
gallopt to the Emperor, and told him in few words that he knew not what, to
put a Kings Son to death upon a false accusation; with such and such like
words, he roughly bespake the Emperor, without all fear or reverence: in so
much that the Emperor sent some of his chief attendants with his privy Signet
to fetch him again, to hear the matter more plainly proved: the whilst they
went to fetch him, Horatio declared what he was, and the occasion of his
departure from his own Country. Quoth Alphonsus, he told me that was the
occasion of his departure, but he told me be was a Gentleman and a younger
brother: by this time, the Emperors men came to the place of execution, where
they declared his will, and showed the Sheriffs the Emperors signet: when they
saw the Signet they knew it was the Emperors will he should be brought, the^
they caused him to be untied which when the people heard, there was such
casting up of hats, hooting and rejoicing, as though heaven and earth would
have gone together: when he came to the court he was examined again of this
matter, the which he utterly denied, whereupon the fellow was called again,
that came in against him, and demanded if this man were guilty or no; he
answered, I. The Emperor would not believe him so, but would make a farther
trial of it, sends presently for a rack, to rack him, till he told the
truth: as soon as the rack came, the very fear and sight of the rack, made
him fall on his knees, and confess all: telling how Impio did hire him to do
it, I gave him fifty Crowns. The Emperor and the Lands-grave hearing this,
sends for Impio, who hearing her knavery was com out, gets her into her
chamber, where she suddenly strangles her self with a Towell: she being found
there dead in this manner, they were all very sorry, and desired Theseus to
pardon their hasty and rash judgment, the which he freely pardoned: this being
past, the Emperor and the Landsgrave intended to accompany Theseus into Greece:
and command a Fleet of ships to be prepared for this voyage: this news being
bruted about, Perigrino was a Kings Son and of Greece: so that in the end it
came too Titana's ear, who was half persuaded it was her Theseus: well she
could not be quiet in min^ till she saw him: the next day she made an excuse to
go forth and go to the Emperors court, and as she was entering ye court gates
she met her Theseus, yet not knowing him directly, but stood still and looked on
him, and he did the like on her, til at last Theseus said, Titana: when she
heard him say so, she st^^t to him, and with joy she wept, and the like did he,
like two Turtle Doves they sweetly bild each other, when they had thus don,
they made it known to the Emperor and Alphonsus, that she was K. Meleagars
daughter, and she was she, yt the pirates took from him: this news bred more
admiration, and more in Fuesen: this being past, the ships ready and all things
provided; the Emperor clothes them in very rich array, and causes them to
board the Navy, there did accompany them the Emperor, the Duke of Branswicke,
the Lands-grave of Hessen; and diverse other knights, and Gentlemen of good
account and reckoning, which being a full wind suddenly arrived in Athens. K.
Aegeus seeing such a Fleet of goodly ships coming began to misdoubt the worst,
and sent out a Pinnace to see what they wore, and to what intent they came:
which returned him this answer: and shall please your Highness, there is the
Emperor of Germany, the Duke of Brunswicke, the Lands-grave of Hessen, and
your young Prince Theseus. Aegeus hearing that, never stai^d to call any to
attend him, neither to put on his cloak, but (...) t^ meet them without hat or
cloak. His Son Theseus coming for most in the troop, when he saw his Father,
fell down on his knees: the aged king stooped and took him up in his arms
and wept bitterly for joy, having so done, he salutes Titana, and the rest in
the courteousest manner he could devise. The Citizens hearing of their coming
again, to show their joy, made Bonfires, and shows, with Bells ringing
throughout all the City: the Court^^^s and knights appointed Iusts and Turnies,
to signify their (...), gratifying the Kings fortunate hap. Aegeus hearing of
his Son Theseus adverse haps since he departed from him, thought now to
accomplish his joy, caused preparation for the Nuptial, which being done* and
twenty days fully expired in solemn feasting: the Emperor, the Duke, and the
Lands-grave with their followers, took their leave and departed. Aegeus sent
for his men that were in the field against the Achaians, and Calidons,
proclaimed a final peace, and crowned Theseus king of those three kingdoms,
having this done, and finished all things as he could wish, he gave his Son
charge of the well governing his estate, to keep the hearts of his commons;
after these and such live, words he died, even with over ioying himself at
Theseus return: his father being dead, he caused his funeral to be made, which
done his father intombed, and his solemn obsequies being past, Titana and
Theseus ended their vales in quiet rest,

FINIS.
