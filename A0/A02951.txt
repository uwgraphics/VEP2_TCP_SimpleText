A Declaration of the causes that have moved the Cardinal of Bourbon, the
Princes, Peers, Gentlemen, Towns and Comminalties Catholic of this Realm of
France, to oppose themselves to those which by all means do seek to subvert
the Catholic Religion and the Estate.
IN the name of God Almighty King of Kings: Be it manifest to all men, that
the Realm of France having bin troubled and afflicted these four and twenty
years, with a pestilent sedition moved and stirred to subvert the ancient
Religion of our forefathers, which is the strongest band of the Estate, there
have been remedies applied, the which contrary to the hope of their Majesty's,
have fallen out to be more apt to nourish the evil, then to quench the same,
the which had nothing of peace but the bare name, and have not established the
quiet and weal of the Realm, but for their behoof who troubled the same,
leaving the honester sort offended in their consciences, and interessed in
their goods.

And in stead of remedy, the which in time was hoped and looked for against
these mischiefs, such has been the will of God, that our kings of latter time
have deceased in their young years, without leaving any children able to
succeed to the crown. And hitherto it has not pleased him (to the great
grief of all good men) to grant any issue to the king now reigning: although
his subjects have not omitted (neither hereafter at any time will cease) their
most earnest prayers to obtain that favor of the goodness of God: In such
sort, as remaining the last of so many children that God had given to the late
King Henry, it is greatly to be feared (which God forbid) that this royal race
through our evil hap, shall be quite extinguished without any hope of issue:
And that in the establishing of a successor in the royal estate, there will
fall out great troubles throughout all Christendom, and it may be the whole
subversion of the Catholic and Apostolic religion in this most Christian
Realm, where an heretic shall never be suffered to bear rule, in so much as
the subjects are not bound to acknowledge and suffer a Prince that is swarued
and fallen from the Catholic faith: for that the first oath which our kings
do make when they are crowned, is to maintain the Catholic, Apostolic, and
Roman Religion, upon which oath they receive that which their subjects do
make of fidelity and allegiance, and not otherwise. Notwithstanding, sithence
the death of my Lord the Kings brother, the purposes of those which by open
profession have showed themselves always persecuters of the Catholic Church,
have been so bolstered and favored, that it is very needful to think of
some speedy and sound remedy, thereby to avoid the inconveniences most
apparent, whereof the calamities are already known to all men, the remedy to
few, and the way how to apply the same almost to no man.

And so much the rather, that a man may easily judge by the great preparations
and practices which they make to levy soldiers as well within as without the
realm, and the detainyng of towns and strong holds, which long ago they
should have restored and yielded up into the Kings hands, that we are very
near the effect of their evil intentions, being very certain that they have
of late sent to practice the Princes Protestants of Germany, that they might
have forces in a readiness to suppress at their pleasure all good men, as it
is very apparent that they entend nothing else but to assure themselves, and
sease of all necessary means to overthrow the Catholic religion, wherein
every man has interest, and especially the noble men and great personages
which have the honor to hold the first and principal charges in this common
wealth, whom they do go about to undermine and overthrow, during the kings
life and under his authority, to the end that leaving no man which hereafter
may be able to oppose himself to their will, it may be more easy for them to
bring to pass that change and alteration of the Catholic religion which they
do pretend, thereby to enrich themselves with the patrimony of the Church,
following the example which was begun to them in England, especially in that
every man does know sufficiently, and sees (as it were) with open eyes the
behavior and actions of some, which being crept into the favor of the King
our Sovereign Lord (whose Majesty has been and always shall be sacred and
redoubted unto us) they have in a manner seized upon his authority, to
maintain the greatness which they have usurped, favoring and aduauncing by
all means the purposes of the aforesaid. And such has been their audacitie,
to banish from about the King, not only the Princes and the Nobility, but
also those that are most nearest and dearest unto him, giving access to none
but to such as depend upon them.

Wherein they are already so far forth, that there is no man which has any
part or doing in the administration of the government of the Estate, or that
is suffered to exercise entirely his charge: Some are bereft of the title of
their dignities, other of the authority and execution of their offices, though
they are suffered to enjoy the vain and fruiteles name.

In like manner, the like has been done in the behalf of diverse Governors of
Provinces, and Captains of strong places, and to their Officers, who have been
constrained to forgo and yield up their charges in respect of some recompense
of money, which they have received against their own will and desire, because
they durst not say nay unto them which have power to compel the^: A new
example, and never heretofore practiced within this Realm, for some piece of
money to take away the offices and charges from those to whom the same were
given for recompense of their virtue and fidelity. And by this means they are
become masters, and have possessed them selves of the forces of the Realm, as
well by sea as by land, and do go about daily to do the like to others that
are in office, so that there is no man can be assured, and that stands not in
fear, and looks that his office shall be taken from him: Howbeit the same
having been given him for desert and service, he ought not to be deprived
thereof by the ancient laws of the Realm, unless it be for some just and
reasonable considerations, or that he has committed some fault in the
execution of his charge. In like manner they have emptied the Kings Cofers of
his treasure, where they cause the ready money of the general receipts to be
brought, and to be converted to their particular use, and hold at their
devotion all the chief revenues, the which are the very ways to dispose of
this Crown, and to place the same on whose head they shall think good.

Moreover, through their covetousness it is come to pass, that abusing the
gentleness of the Subjects, they have enhanced by little and little to most
grievous exactions, not only matching those which the calamity of war had
brought in (whereof in time of peace nothing was ever remitted and abated) but
other infinite oppressions grown from day to day, at the appetite of their
unbridled wills.

There was some hope, when through the often complaints and exclamations of the
whole Realm, the convocation of the general Estates was published at Blois,
which is the ancient remedy to heal these domestical wounds, and as it were
a conference between the Princes and their subjects, to enter into a
reckoning together of the due obedience of the one part, and due preservation
of the other, which is the groundworke and foundation of the state of France:
But of this troublesome and great assembly, there sprung nothing but the
authorizing of the mischievous counsel of some, who fainyng themselves to be
good Politikes, showed themselves in effect to be evil affected to the
service of God and of the weal public, who were not contented to remove the
King (of his own nature most inclined to godliness) from that holy and most
wholesome determination, which at the most humble request of all the States he
had made, to reunite all his subjects to one Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman
religion, to the end that they might live together in the ancient faith
wherein the Realm was established, and took increase to become the most
flourishing of all Christendom, which then might have been executed without
any danger, and in a manner without resistance. Notwithstanding, they to the
contrary did persuade him, that it was necessary for his service to abate and
diminish the authority of the Princes and Catholic Lords, which with great
zeal had oftentimes put their lives in hazard under his ensign for the
defense of the said Catholic religion, as though the reputation which they had
gotten by their virtue and fidelity, in stead of honor should bring them in
suspicion.

So likewise the abuse which by little and little had taken hold and increase,
afterward is come upon us like a flood and downfall, with so violent a fall,
that the poor Realm is even at the point to be overwhelmed without any hope
of help: For, the Ecclesiastical order, notwithstanding the declarations and
petitions which they have exhibited, is at this day oppressed with tenthes and
extreme exactions, to the despising and contempt of holy orders, and of the
Church of God, wherein now all things are polde and pilde: The Nobility is
greatly aggrieued, driven to pay exactions in despite of their privilege, if
that they will be contented to live, that is to say, if they will either eat,
drink, or apparel themselves. The towns, Officers of the Crown, and common
people, shorn so near by the daily paying of new impositions (which they do
term invention of Finances) that there remains nothing else, but to invent
some good way how to remedy this mischief.

For these just causes and considerations, We Charles Cardinal of Bourbon,
the next Prince of blood to whom it belongs especially to take in hand the
safegarde and protection of the Catholic religion in this Realm, and the
co^seruation of the good and loyal servants of his Majesty and the Estate,
being assisted with the Peers, Cardinals, Princes, Prelates, officers of the
Crown, governors of Provinces, Noble men, Gentlemen, captains of Cities, and
others, which make the best and soundest part of this Realm, having wisely
considered the cause moving us to undertake this enterprise, and taken the advice and counsel, as well of our good friends well affected to the weal and
quiet of this Realm, as of learned and wise men and such as fear God, whom
we would not off^nde herein for all earthly treasure: We declare and make
it known, that we have all sworn, and made a holy vow to keep our selves
in arms, to the end that the holy Church of GOD may be restored to his
former dignity, and the true and Catholic religion established: that the
Nobility may enjoy (as they ought) their freedoms wholly and entirely: and
that the people may be released, the new impositions abolished, and all
exactions taken away, which have been made since the reign of Charles the
ninth, whom God absolve: That the Parliaments may be restored to the fullness
of their authority, and entier soueraintie of Judgment, every one for his
jurisdiction, and all the subjects of the Realm mainteyned in his government,
charge, and office, the which may not be taken from them but in such case as by
law is established, and by ordinary judgment: that all such money as is
levied of the people, may be employed to the defense of the Realm, and to such
purposes as is appointed: and that from henceforth the general Estates may be
assembled freely and without any practice, as often as the state of the Realm
shall require the same, with free liberty to every man to exhibit their
complaints, as they shall find themselves agreeued.

These things and others shall be more particularly provided for at the
assembly of the Estates, which shall be held in arms for the reformation of
the whole Realm, for the maintenance of the good Subjects and punishment of
the evil, and for the surety of our persons, who have been sought, and namely
within these few days through secret conspiracies, should have been made away
and utterly overthrown, as though the safety of the Estate did depend of the
ruin of good men, and of those which so often have ventured their lives for
the preservation of the same, having nothing left unto us more to warrant us
from hurt and to avoid the sword which already hangs over our heads, but to
have recourse to those remedies which we have always abhorred. Whereto
notwithstanding we would not have trusted for the only peril of our lives,
if the subversion of the Catholic Religion in this Realm had not bin
unseparably joined withal: for the preservation and maintenance whereof, we
would never fear nor refuse any danger, making full reckoning that we cannot
choose a more honorable Tomb, then to die for so just and holy a quarrel, both
to discharge our selves of the duty and bond which we owe (as good
Christians) to the service of God, as also to avoid, as faithful and good
subjects, the overthrow of this Estate, which ordinarily does follow such
alteration: Protesting that it is not against the King our Sovereign Lord we
do take Arms, but for the defense of his person, his life, and his estate,
for the which we do swear all of us to expose and spend our goods and lives
to the last drop of our blood, with the like fidelity that we have showed
heretofore: And to lay down our weapons so sone as it shall please his
Majesty to cause the peril to cease which does threaten the ruin of the
service of God and so many good men, the which we most humbly beseech to
procure with all speed, testifying to every man by good and true effects, that
he is a most christian king, having the fear of God and the zeal of religion
graven in his soul, as always we have perceived, and that like a good father
and king he secketh the preservation of his subjects, in doing whereof his
Majesty shall be so much the more obeyed and honored of us, and of all his
ancient subjects, which we desire above all things in the world.

And although that it be not a thing far from reason, that the king should be
required to take order, that during his life, the people committed to his
charge should not be divided into factions and partialities of the difference
of succession: Notwithstanding, so it is, that we are so little moved with any
such consideration, that the slander of those which do reproach it unto us,
shall not be found to be grounded upon any foundation. For, besides that the
laws of the Realm are clear enough in that behalf, and sufficiently known,
the hazard whereunto we the Cardinal of Bourbon do offer our selves in our
old days and last years, are proof sufficient, that we are not set a work
with any such hope or desire, but that we are only moved with a true zeal of
religion, whereby we pretend part to another manner of kingdom more assured,
the enjoying whereof is more to be desired, and of longer continuance.

Our intention being such, we do beseech all men, and most humbly the Queen
mother of the king, our most redoubted Lady (without whose wisdom and good
advise this realm should have bin piecemeale dispersed and quite destroyed)
for the faithful witness, that she is able, will, and ought to afforde to our
great service, namely in particular to us the Cardinal of Bourbon, who have
always honored, aided, and assisted her, in her most urgent affairs, without
the sparing of our goods, lives, friends and kinsfolks, together with her
fortifying ye kings side, and upholding the Catholic religion, that she will
not at this instant leave us in the open field, but rather employ all the
credit, which her pains and laborsome travail have deserved of right, and of
which credit with the king her son, her enemies most unjustly seek to
bereave her.

Also we beseech all the Princes of France, Officers appertaining to the king,
Ecclesiastical persons, Noblemen, Gentlemen, and others of what degree or
calling so ever they be of, which are not as yet joined with us, to help, aid
and assist us with their means and advice in the execution of so good and holy
a work. And we do exhort all towns and co^munalties, even as they do love
their own preservation, to judge soundly of our intentions, to acknowledge the
comfort which hereby shall come unto ye estate, as well publicly, as to their
particular, and to put to their helping hand to this good enterprise, which can
not but prosper with the grace of God to whom we do refer all things: Or at
the least, if their advise and resolution cannot so soon agree together (as
their counsels consist of diverse and sundry persons,) we do admonish the^ to
have an eye to themselves, and not to suffer any man to possess themselves by
any sinister interpretation that they may surmise of our intentions, of their
said towns, and so place in them garnison of soldiers, bringing them to the
same slavery as the other towns be in which they do usurp.

We do declare to al men that we do not mean to use any act of hostility,
but against those who with arms shall offer to oppose themselves unto us, and
by other means shall favor our adversaries, which seek the overthrow of the
Church, and to destroy the estate: Assuring every man, that these our taking of
arms being holy and just, shall offer no oppression to any, be it in passing
and abiding in any place, but shall live with good government, and take nothing
but that which they shall pay for, and receive into their company al such as are
zealous of ye honor of God, and of the holy church, and to the weal and
preservation of the most christian French nation: with protestation
notwithstanding, not to leave off their weapons till we see the full
accomplishment and execution of the things aforesaid, and rather to die most
willingly with a desire to be heaped up together in one sepulcher consecrated
to the latter Frenchmen dead in arms for the cause of God and of their
Country.

Last of all, for because all aid comes from God, we do beseech all true
Catholics to join with us in this society, reconciling themselves with his
divine Majesty, by an entire reformation of their lives, thereby to appease
his wrath, and to call upon him in pureness of conscience, as well by public
prayers and holy processions, as by private and particular devotions: To the
end that all our actions may be referred to the honor and glory of him which
is the God of armies, and of whom we do look for all our strength and most
assured help. Given at Shalous the of March, 1585. Signed. Charles Cardinal of
Bourbon.

A Declaration set forth by the French king, showing his pleasure concerning
the new troubles in his Realm.

Translated out of French into English by E. A.



LONDON Imprinted by John Wolf dwelling in Distaffe lane near the sign of
the Castle. 1585.

A declaration of the French kings pleasure, concerning the new troubles of
his Realm.
Notwithstanding the king by letters and precepts has heretofore sundry times
admonished his Subjects not to suffer themselves to be led away with the
persuasions and counsails of some who seek to practice and associate them unto
themselves, whereby to frustrate them of their quiet: and withal have offered
and promised favor to such as being already entangled, shall upon knowledge of
his meaning withdraw themselves: yet his Majesty to his great grief
understanding that notwithstanding his said precepts and favorable
admonitions, some of his said subjects upon sundry considerations, (but for
the most part being tra^sported and blinded with such fair and beautiful
shows as the authors do set upon their enterprises,) do still enter into the
same. His said Majesty has thought it requisite for the universal weal of
his said subjects, the discharge of his conscience toward God, and his
reputation with the world to oppose against such artificial devise. (...)
light of truth, which is the true comfort of the good and mortal enemy to
their adversaries, to the end his said subjects being conducted by the light
thereof may in time and without let discern and know the original and intent
of such motions and so escew al both public and private calamities that may
grow thereof.

The pretenses which the autors of the said troubles do allege, are chiefly
founded upon The restoring of the Catholic, Apostolic and Romish religion in
this land: The distributing of the offices and dignities thereof, to those unto
whom justly they may appertain: and The wealth, honor, and relief of the
Clergy, Nobility and Commons.

These points al men have manifestly known to have been always so dear and
in such recommendation with his Majesty that none can justly doubt of his
intent concerning the same: whereby it appears that they needed not to have
practiced his subjects, gathered the^ into arms, or levied foreign power
wherewith to induce him to accept of such motions as they pretend to exhibit
concerning the same, in case they were just, possible and commodious to his
subjects.

In respect of the said religion, his said Majesty before his coming to the
crown has adventured his own life and with most happy success fought for
the propagation of the same: also since that it pleased God to call him to the
government of this realm, he has oftentimes to ye like purpose hazarded his
estate, and employed his best means, together with the lives and wealth of his
good subjects and servants, whereby they may presently be persuaded and believe
that no man who so ever either in this realm or else where, of whatsoever
profession has more hearty care of religion and godliness, then always he has
had which by Gods grace he will still continue.

Moreover although after the example of the late king his brother with diverse
other Christian Princes, whose Empires and dominions have been afflicted with
sundry opinions of the said religion, his Majesty by the prudent advise of the
Queen his Mother, my Lord the Cardinal of Bourbon, with other the Princes,
Officers of the Crown, and Lords of his Counsel who then were about him,
has pacified such troubles as were among his subjects by reason of the said
religion, until it might please God to reunite them into the bosom of the
church: It does not nevertheless therefore follow that his zeal and devotion
so far as concerns the glory of God and perfect restoration of the
Catholic, Apostolic and Romish Church should be any whit changed or
diminished rather now then he showed it to be during the said troubles: Yea so
far is he there froe, that his Majesty wishes every one to understand that
he concluded the said peace, purposedly to try whether by the means thereof he
might reunite to the Church of God such his subjects as the iniquity and
liberty of the time may have separated therefrom, as having so long found
even with the danger of his own person and hazard of his estate, and price of
the blood of so many Princes, Lords, gentlemen, and other his subjects, as
have died during the said troubles and by reason of the same, since the
original of the discord for matter of religion, moved and rooted in the said
realm during the minorities of the late kings his brethren and his, to the
great grief of the aforesaid Lady the Queen their Mother, cannot be determined
by force of arms without the destruction of his subjects and imminent danger
of his realm. A matter wherein he was resolved upon notice given him that
all sorts of people were wearied and over toyled with the long course of the
said troubles, as also that he wanted means any longer to supply the charges
of such war: which should not have happened if in the assembly of the
general estates of this realm holden at Bloys the deputies there present had
as well provided for a leuy of a stock of quoyne wherewith to prosecute the said
war to the end, as was requisite. and his Majesty did require, as (being
induced through fervent zeal to the Catholic Religion) they could desire him
utterly to prohibit the exercise of the said Religion pretended reformed,
whereof did ensue the resolution there taken and sworn unto, which since his
Majesty did endeavor to put in execution: nether should they now have any
pretense to complain, no not they who nevertheless do publish abroad that every
man was sone deprived of that glistering beam of good hope which before by
reason of the resolution taken in the said estates did shine upon them: Besides
that it is unseemly and not lawful for the subject to judge of his kings
actions, were it but in respect that many times he is ignorant of the motive
causes of his commandementes, which for the most part are more pregnant then
those that are apparent and manifest to all men: neither is it for any to do
but only God, the searcher and cleanser of the hearts and dealings of Princes,
who knows the causes that did most enforce his said Majesty to the conclusion
of the said peace: As being certain that if he had any longer deferred the
doing thereof, this realm had been replenished with foreign power and diverse
partialities and new divisions which would have been very preiuditiall to the
estate.

His Majesty did therefore grant the said peace to the end to withstand all
the aforesaid inconveniences, to prevent the effects thereof and to try better
remedies, and not as they allege) to ground or establish any heresy in the
realm, for such a thought never entered into the heart of so Christian and good
a Prince as his Majesty is: who having foreseen, felt and found the
difficulties aforesaid, have thought it his duty the rather to harken to the
said pacification, to the end by means thereof to be the better able to
grant to his subjects the enjoying of that relief whereupon they hoped in
other the articles propounded and required at the assembly of estates aforesaid
for the common wealth of the said realm, peace and union being a fore-running
and necessary mean to the establishing of good laws and reformation of
manners.

Hereunto has his Majesty continually ever since intended as is evident by the
edictes and rules thereupon made, which he has endeavored to put in effect and
cause to be observed: and although his intent has not been executed
according to this desire, the same has redounded to his greater grief, and
has happened peradventure as much by the negligence of some of his officers and
sleightes of his evil willers as also by such footing and advantage as
impiety, corruption and disobedience have set in this realm during the said
wars.

Through this peace, diverse towns replenished with Catholic Citizens and
inhabitants are delivered from the soldiers that had seized upon them. The
exercise of the Catholic, Apostolical and Roman religion is renewed in the
same, as likewise through his Majesty's diligence and care it is in most towns
of this realm, yea even in those wherein the professors of the said religion
pretended reformed, have ever since the troubles been and yet are the
stronger, and from whence both before and ever since his coming to the Crown,
the said exercise has been banished.

The face of justice also has thereby appeared though not altogether so fully
and wholly as were to be wished, yet at the least in such estate as for the most
part it has showed force sufficient to comfort the good and make the bad
afraid. The Prelates and clergy are reentred into their Churches and the
enjoying of their goods whereof they had been spoiled. The Nobility and
Gentlemen might live safe in their houses and not be subject to such expenses
as in ye time of war they were forced to be at for preserving them selves from
being surprised. The Citizen deprived of his own and wandering over the
country with his family is by means of the said peace reentred into his
possessions. The Merchant likewise has again begun his trade of traffic
which by the said troubles was wholly interrupted. The poor husbandma^ groaning
under the weight of the supportable burden a rising of the unbridled license of
the soldier has means to breath and have recourse to his ordinary labor,
for the sustentation of his poor life. To be brief there is no estate or
person but does effectually participate in the benefits of the said
pacification.

Moreover as his Majesty has always been most ielous of the honor of God,
and careful for the common wealth of his said subjects, as much as in a Prince
most Christian and truly good, can, by acknowledging all evils and calamities
of any estate to arise principally through want and default of true godliness
and justice has since the said peace continually labored to raise up two
pillars, which the violence of the said troubles had almost subverted and
laid along. For the compassing whereof, he has begun by naming meet and
capable persons such as the holy decrees do appoint to ecclesiastical
promotions, having charge of souls. He has also by his own example invited
his subjects to reformation of their manners, and to have recourse to the grace
and mercy of God through prayer and austeritie of life, which have confirmed
the Catholics in the duty to his divine Majesty, and moved some of those
that were separated from Gods Church to reconsiliation to the same.

He has likewise intended greatly to give ear to the declaration and
complaints of the Clergy, giving them liberty to assemble them selves to
that effect, and having largely and favorably provided for them, has rather
discharged then ouercharged them with extraordinary tenthes, without respect
to the necessity of his own affairs, notwithstanding whatsoever is published
to the contrary: and is sorry that he can not likewise relieve them of the
payment of their ordinary, because he found them at his coming to the crown
morgaged for the payment of the rents of the town of Paris.

The said Prelates and Clergy have also through his said Majesty's permission
had opportunity to call and hold their prouincial Councels, whereby they have
consulted and provided for the reformation of abuses brought into the Church
during the said troubles, and made good and holy rules to the wealth of the
same, which his said Majesty has confirmed and authorized. These are the
fruits and common and general commodities which Gods Church, and the
Catholic, Apostoliike and Romish religion have reaped of the said
pacification, besides infinite other private and particular benefits which
would be too long to rehearse.

Concerning justice every man knows what pains his said Majesty has taken
to withdraw the same out of darkness wherein the troubles had plunged, to the
end to restore the light thereof to his former force and ancient brightness,
having by death suppressed all superfluous offices, and withal prohibited and
ceased the sale of the said offices which ye want of money had forced his
predecessors to bring in, nothing regarding his own need, which is nothing
inferior to his predecessors.

Besides all this his Majesty has excluded all remissions and euocations
which aforetune were dispatched of his proper motion, in consideration that he
perceaueth how great hope to attain the same did autorize evil deeds, and the
small difficulty that was made in granting others did bring confusion into
Justice.

Moreover since the said pacification he has had opportunity to send into
sundry provinces of his realm, sundry chambers composed of officers of the
parliament of Paris to minister justice unto his said subjects even in the
said place, whereof is grown such fruit as all men have tasted, which yet
would increase to the contentation of the good, if his good meaning had been
better assisted by those who naturally and by especial bond of their vocations
were bound thereto. But as the iniquity of the time has emboldened some to
burden his Majesty with other men's faults, and that corruption and malice are
so replenished with boldness and impudency that many have even taken pleasure
in defacing his most holy and best actions, whereby to cause his subjects to
mislike of them and so to get to them selves their good wills with the expense
of his reputation: yea so far as sometimes to dare enterprete the most
commendable zeal that he has had to cause the decrees and sentences of the
said chambers against evil doers to be executed, unto over great rigor and
severity.

His said Majesty had therefore begun by the means aforesaid to provide for
the erecting of these two true pillars, the only foundations and preservation
of every Monarchy and had conceived some assurance wholly to set them up and
restore them to their perfection through the co^tinuation of the peace if it
had pleased God to have given his grace to make his realm and subjects worthy
thereof. This also it seems those men which seek to move the subjects to take
arms and yet under coulor of providing for both the one and the other, did as
soon fear as foresee.

They do also give out that they take arms to the end to withstand the
troubles which they say they fear should happen after his Majesty's decease in
the establishing of a Royal successor to the disadvantage of the said
Catholic, Apostolic, and Romish religion. Being persuaded, or at the least
so giving forth that his said Majesty, or they that are about him do favor the
pretenses of those yt have showed themselves persecuters of the said religion.

A matter whereof his Majesty desires and warns his subjects to believe
that he never thought, as being, thanks be to God, in the flower and strength
of his age and likewise the Queen his wife, and so hops that God will grant
them issue to the general contentation of his good and loyal subjects: besides
it seems to him that they seek to force both nature and time and withal do
to much mistrust the favor and goodness of God, the health and life of his
Majesty, and the faithfulness of the said Lady Queen his wife in motioning at
this time any such question, but much more in prosecuting the decision thereof
by force of arms. For in liew of warranting and delivering y^ realm for the
mischief which they say they fear will one day ensue hereof, the entry into
war presently for that cause is properly as much as to hasten the griefs of
the same: as being assured shortly to replenish the realm with foreign power,
partialities, and innumerable discords, besides blood, murder and infinite
robberies and oppressions.

Here may you see how the Catholic religion shall be restored, the Clergy
discharged of their tenthes, the Gentlemen live quietly and safe in his house
and enjoy his rightes and prerogatives, ye Citizens inhabitants of towns
exempt from garrisons, and the poor towns eased of subsidies and impositions
that it now bears.

His majesty therefore warns and exhorts his subjects in this case to
look about them and not to persuade themselves that this war can be finished so
soon and easily as is given out, but rather to weigh and deeply to consider
the event and inevitable consequence thereof: and not to suffer their
reputations to be stained, and their weapons to seem as an instrument to ye
destruction of their country and to the increase of the power of the enemies
fherof, who only will triumph and reap benefit by the miseries and calamities
of the same. For while we, blinded in our own benefit shall war one upon
another and be succored in outward appearance, but in effect fed on by their
assistaunce, they shall reign prosperously and establish their power.

They complain also of the division of ye offices and houses of this said
realm, saying that such are put from them as have better deserved of the
estate and his Majesty's service. A weak foundation and of no great honor to
build the ruin and salvation of so flourishing a realm whose kings were never
bound to use the service of one more then of an other. For there is no law that
binds him thereto except as the benefit of his service requires.
Nevertheless his said Majesty has at all times greatly honored and cherished
the princes of his blood, as much as any of his predecessors, and has shewe^ a
will to prefer others into credit, honor and reputation by using their
service: for so often as his said Majesty has levied any power or army, he has
still by preferring them committed the charge and conduct of the same unto the^,
and if we do consider who at this present have the greatest and most honorable
rooms in the realm, we shall find that they are said to be the authors of such
complaints and have cause rather to commend his majesty's goodness and favor
then any way to complain and depart from him.

But say they, they have but the name, and in effect are deprived of the
prerogatives depending upon their said offices, which other men do usurp.
Before we judge of the merit of such complainant it were good to see and
deeply to look into the rightes and preheminences to every office attributed,
and then to consider how and by whom they have been administered in the time of
the kings predecessors.

A matter which his Majesty has often propounded, when he has endeavored to
set order in every man's office, and had long since been determined and decided
if those that have interest therein had according to their duties aided and
assisted him as they ought. But shall it therefore be now said and so left to
the posterity that private interests and discontentations should be the cause
of troubling a whole estate, and replenishing the same with blood and
desolation?

This is not the way that should be taken in seeking to redress those abuses
which they complain of, since they have to do with so merciful a Prince, who
still would preuente the inconvenience, and willingly would accept of all meet
and convenient remedies which may be offered to him for the redress of the
same.

Let therefore the weapons be laid down, foreign power countermanded and this
Realm delivered out of that danger which now it is like to incur by this
rising and taking of arms, and in lieu of proceeding in this way which is full
of stumblinge blocks, miseries and both private and public calamities, let
the path of reason duly be sought out, undertaken and followed, whereby Gods
holy Church, the enemy of all violence may more easily be restored to her power
and beauty, and the Nobility satisfied and contented as it ought to be. For
which of the kings his Majesty's predecessors have in effect showed any token
of more love or cherishing ye order thereof then his Majesty has done? as not
being contented with preferring it before the aunciente and principal honors
and degrees of this realm, but has expressly erected and made others new,
which he has consecrated to the illustration of true nobility, as having
excluded and deprived all other estates from the same.

His Majesty will also effectually provide with all speed for the ease of his
people, like as he has already very well begone, and wishes to his power to
continue.

Moreover notwithstanding the Captains of this war do promise that their
power and forces shall live so orderlye that all men shall like thereof, and
withal that they exhort the cities and towns not to admit any garrisons, yet
do we see that the soldiers when they have gathered together do already
commit infinite oppressions and excess, also that they have placed forces in
those towns and holds which they have seized upon, to the end to rule and
keep them in their obedience. Besides all this it is evident that many
vagabonds and idle persons will as has been accustomed rise under the name and
coulor of either part who will commit infinite sacrileges and mischiefs. In
such sort that in lieu of stopping the danger which threatens the destruction
of Gods service and all good men as by this war they do promise, it will
replenish the whole realm withal impiety and ungodliness.

They do also give out that their lives are in danger, and that that is one
of the causes that moves them to rise, No man can think that this complaint
any whit concerns his Majesty, as well in respect of the good and favorable
usage that at all times they have received at his hands, as also in that his
said Majesty is naturally so far from all sort of reueng that the person is
yet unborn, that can justly complain of him for the same, notwithstanding
whatsoever offense against him committed, whereas contrariwise there are many
that having proved his clemency may serve for a perpetual remembrance to the
posterity.

In consideration her of his said Majesty desires and exhorts the Captains
of the said risings speedely to disperse their bands, countermaund the
strangers, and depart from al factions, and as his kinsmen and servants, to
repose assured confidence in his love and good will, which in so doing he
offers to continue unto them, by honoring them with his favor and making
the^ partakers of such honors as he is accustomed to bestow upon men of their
calling: to join and reunite themselves unto him, to the end duly and
effectually to provide for the restoring of Gods service, and the common wealth
of his said subjects in such order as shall be thought meet and convenient,
whereto his Majesty is willing to harken.

He also warns all Ecclesiastical persons and gentlemen his subjects well to
weigh the consequence of these stirs, sincerely to embrace his intent, and to
believe that his mind always has and still shall tend to do good to all, and
harm and displeasure to none.

He does therefore most straightly command them and all other his subjects to
depart and withdraw themselves from all leagues and assotiations, and to
reunite themselves unto him, as nature, duty, and their own wealth and health
does bind them, to the end that if these commotions do proceed any farther
(which he beseeches the goodness of allmighty God not to permit) he may have
assistaunce and succor in their counsel, weapons and commodities to the
preservation of the Realm, whereunto is linked the Catholic Apostolic and
Romish Church therein, their honor, reputation, persons, famelies, and goods.

Offering and promisinge unto them in so doing the continuance of his favor
with recompense for their fidelity and service.
