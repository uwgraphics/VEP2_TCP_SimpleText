Come buy this new Ballad, before you do go: If you rail at the Author, I
know what I know. To the Tune of, I Will tell you but so.


IT is an old saying,
that few words are best,
And he that says little,
shall live most at rest:
And I by experience
do find it right so,
Therefore i will spare speech,
but I know what I know.
Yet shall you perceive well,
though little I say,
That many enormities
I will display:
You may gusse my meaning,
by that which I show,
I will not tell all,
but I know etc.
There be some great climbers,
composed of ambition,
To whom better-borne men
do bend, with submission:
Proud Lucifer climbing,
was cast very low,
I Will not stay these men,
but I know etc.
There be many Foxes
that go on two legs,
They steal greater matters
then Cocks, Hens, and Eggs,
To catch many Guls
in Sheep clothing they go,
They might be destroy (...)
but I know etc.
There be many men
that Devotion pretend,
And make us believe,
that true Faith they will defend:
Three times in one day
to Church they will go,
They cozen the world,
but I know etc.
There be many rich men,
both Yeomen and Gentry,
That for their own private gain
hurt a whole Coun^rey,
By closing free Commons,
yet they will make as though
Twere for common good,
but I know etc.
There be diverse Papists,
that to save their Fine,
Come to Church once a month,
to hear Service Divine,
The Pope gives them power,
as they say, to do so,
They save money by it too,
but I know etc.
There be many Upstarts
that spring from the Cart,
Who gotten to th'Court,
play the Gentleman's part:
Their fathers were plain men,
they scorn to be so,
They think themselves brave,
but I know etc.
There be many Officers,
men of great place,
To whom if one sue
for their favor and grace.
^e must bribe their servants,
while they make as though
They know no such thing,
but I know etc.
The Second Part. To the same Tune.


THere be many Women
that seem very pure,
A kiss from a stranger
they will hardly endure,
They are like Lucretia,
modest in show,
I will accuse none,
but I know etc.
Likewise there be many
dissembling men,
That seem to hate Drinking
and Whoring, yet when
They meet with a Wench,
to the Tavern they will go,
They are civil all day,
but I know etc.
There be many Batchelors,
that to beguile
Believing kind Lasses,
use many a wile,
They all swear that they love,
when they mean nothing so,
And boast of these tricks,
but I know etc.
There Is many an Usurer,
that like a Drone
Does idly live
upon his moneys Lone,
From Tens unto Hundreds
his money does grow:
He says he does good,
but I know etc.
There be many Gallants
that go in gay Raiment,
For which the Tailor
did never receive payment,
They ruffle it out
with a gorgeous show,
Some take them for Knights,
but I know etc.
There be many Rorers
that swagger and rore,
As though they in th'warres had b^
seven years and more,
And yet they never look
in the face of a F^e:
They seem gallant Sparks,
but I know etc,
There Is many, both Women
and Men that appear
With beautiful Outsides,
the Worlds eyes to bleare:
But all is not Gold,
that does glister in show,
They are fine with a Pox,
but I know etc.
There Is many rich Tradesmen
who live by Deceit,
And in Weight and Measure
the poor they do cheat,
They Will not swear an Oath,
but indeed, I, and No,
They truly protest,
but I know etc.
There be many people
so given to strife,
That they will go to Law
for a two-penny Knife:
The Lawyers nere ask them
why they do so,
He gets by their hate,
but I know etc.
I know there be many
will carpe at this Ballet,
Because it is like
sour Sauce to their Pallet:
But he, she, or they,
let me tell ere I go,
If they speak against this Song,
I know what I know.
Fini^.
