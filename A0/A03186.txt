A new Ballad entitled, I have fresh Cheese and Cream. To a new Tune.


IN London lately as I went,
Along the streets to try,
Many a pretty Wench I saw,
Along the streets to try:
But none so sweet,
Which I there could meet,
As there was a handsome Wench,
That sang in Colman street,
I have fresh Cheese and Cream,
I have fresh Cheese and Cream.
Upon her back she wore
A Fustian wast coat white,
Her Bodies and her Stomacher,
Were fastened very tite.
Her N^ckenger of Holland sure,
Her voice was shrill and very pure:
Her Ware she opened straight
To any that would buy.
I have fresh Cheese and Cream,
I have fresh Cheese and Cream.
She pleased me full well,
In singing of her noate;
She sung not like an Oyster whore,
That r^tieth in the throat:
Which made me to admier,
And asked her name, but with the same,
She cried then more higher.
I have fresh Cheese and Cream,
I have, etc.
With that I marked all the trades
Were round about the City,
The cries of youngmen, boys, and maids,
And all their pleasant dittie:
Ripe Cherrie, ripe ripe,
Hot Pippin-pies; they pipe:
Hay'ny Boules or Trayes to mende?
White young Radish, white.
I have fresh Cheese and Cream,
I have, etc.
Will you buy any Aqua-viti?
Sweep Chimney sweep:
Buy any Writing pens, or Incke?
Will you buy any Milk?
Will you buy Pippins fine,
Or Lemmons for your Wine?
Will you buy and Blacking,
Twill make your shoes to shine?
I have fresh Cheese and Cream,
I have, etc.
Old shoes; will you buy any Broomes?
Will you buy a Sieve?
Hay'ny old Bellows to mende?
Hay'ny Wood to cleave?
Will you buy any su^ruy Grass?
Will you buy any Glasses?
Ripe saint Thomas Onions.
But then began this Less,
I have fresh Cheese and Cream,
I have fresh, etc.
Buy a Matte for a Bed.
New Mus^les, Lilly white.
Buy a fine Tinder box.
What Kitchinstuffe hay ye Maids?
I have white young Leekes.
Hay'ny old Dublets?
I have ripe Cowcumbers ripe.
Hay'ny Corns ay'r feet.
I have fresh Cheese and Cream,
I have fresh, etc.
I have fine Pomegranuts.
Hot Codlings hot.
I have ripe Strawberries.
Dee lack sir, what dee lack,
Bands, Shirtes, or Ruffes,
Handkerchers, or Cuffes:
Garters, Knives, or Purses,
Or Muscoua silken Muffes?
I have fresh Cheese and Cream,
I have fresh, etc.
By no means can I get,
To know her dwelling place:
She was so decked with comlines,
And bodyed with such grace.
I would not care a rush,
So might have my wish,
To have her stay all night with me,
which were a bettter dish,
then her fresh Cheese and Cream,
then her fresh Cheese and Cream.
FINIS.
