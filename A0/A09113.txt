AIM FOR FINSBVRIE ARCHERS.

Or an Alphabeticall Table of the names of every Mark within the same fields,
with their true distances according to the dimensuration of the line.

Newly gathered, and amended by James Partridge.

LONDON, Printed by G.M. for John Partridge, and are to be sold at the sign of
the Sun in Paul's Churchyard. 1628.

To all that affect the famous exercise of Archerie frequenting Finsbury fields.
SHooting in the long bow being of it self very laudable, and our English
nation in all ages surpassing therein all others, yea neither the Getes,
Scythes, Parthians, Sarmatians, Armiaspes, famous for that quality, nor any
other people could become equal with English Archers: and yet (a matter to be
lamented) this laudable exercise of late has become cold in most places of
this land, famous London retaining the most ardent desire to maintain the
same, as appears by the daily concourse of Citizens, to their great
commendations, in diverse companies in the convenient fields about the City, but
most specially in that choice place Finsburie, most specially garnished with
many beautiful Marks in this book Alphabetically mentioned, whereby the
benefactors therein shall have perpetual memory recorded by the titles of their
several erections.

And for that every hand ought to bring some portion of help toward the
preservation and increase of so commendable actiuity I have reprinted,
enlarged, and amended this little work, the rather because in these warlike
times the use of the bow, as formerly, so it may again be necessary and very
serviceable to the state, wishing it may work a continuing in the old, and a
growing good will in such beginners as by perusing the same have a desire to
come to the knowledge of the marks, and thereby to good shooting.

Rules touching the use of the Treatise.
1 First note, that sundry Marks have two or three words for their names. Look
for the mark always in the first word: as, in the Kings Mace, look not for
Mace, but for Kings: also the House of Lancaster, look for House, not for
Lancaster, and so in the rest.

2 Note further that the first number shows the scores, the second the yards.
You must shoot long aim because this is set down by measure of the line.

3 Again note, that the marks are to be taken all going into the fields: and
if you be coming homeward, look for the mark you shoot at, and not for the
mark you stand at. And the marks are placed from the left hand to the right,
leaving out none from 9. score to 18. or 19. score. And when a mark is found
along a bank, you must always look for the mark from the West toward the
East.

4 Also for the aid of young shooters there is in the end of the book a Table
of the names of all the marks, with direction in what page to find them, for
the ease of those that are unacquainted with the names of the marks.

And for the better advertisement of such as are not acquainted with the order
of the game and custom of the field, whereby often arise controversies, and
diverse times grow rash and unadvised oaths, to the derogation of Gods glory,
here are set down such orders as are sit to be observed in this exercise.

1 First, for the finding of your mark it must be within every man's reach.
Also the precise naming of your mark preuenteth much cavil.

2 Secondly for whites you may have as many as you will, so they be all
forwards: and if you shoot at any loose white, if it be stricken out of sight,
it is no mark.

3 Thirdly, for the highest of stakes, although the wood be above the pin, you
are to measure at the pin if there be any, because it is put in for the same
purpose.

4 Fourthly, if you find a bush or a black, whatsoever you find highest in it,
being within the compass of the mark, you are to take it for the height.

5 Fifthly, for all trees you are to measure at foot and pole, except in the
naming of it you say, At the nail in such a tree, or hole in such a tree, or
being a tree of so small height, that you may reach the top of it with half
your bow, then you may take the highest.

6 Sixthly, if in measuring of a shoot, by have the mark is stirred, he is to
lose the shoot that measures it.

7 Seventhly, when you come to the mark and claim two, and the contrary sides
draw their arrows, and when your mate comes he says, his would win too, you
are to winn no more then you claimed.

8 Eighthly, if you name one mark and shoot at another, you are to lose your
shoot, and they are to follow at the mark named.

9 Lastly, if your arrow break, you may measure to the nearest piece that has
wood and head, or wood and feather.
