Monophylo, drawn into English by Geffray Fenton. A philosophical discourse,
and division of love.

Mon heur viendra.

Anno. 1572.



TO THE RIGHT virtuous Lady, the Lady Hobby, Geffraie Fenton desires increase
of honor, according to her worthynesse.
SINCE MY LAST translation to your good Ladyshippe, I have disposed some part
of my leisure to reveal Monophylo, whose argument albeit is not religious, and
less exspectation of grave things, in so unquiet a state of his, yet he brings
forth a Phylosophie no less moral and natural, then necessarylie tending to
assure our frayltie amydde many hidden miseries, wherewith we stand enuyroned
by Gods necessary prouydence: wherein by how much he offers help to our
infirmity, as both by advise, whose reasons are invincible, and private
experience which touches us in example: by so much he merits authority
(although with some) his precepts may seem suspicious as touching the subject,
and my hours improperlye exercised, whose condition requires (in common
wisdom) to practice in matters of more benefit. For the first, the
Philosophers generally are to answer for me, who in their precepts either
of glory, of covetousness, to move contempt of the world, or in any other
cause tending to instruct, reform, or edify, observed in their doctrine, to
decypher the secret nature of things, the better to prepare their Disciples to
the high knowledge of such matters as they delivered to them but by speech,
the same being the proper instrument to perfection in science, as Erbes and
Symples rightlye compownde, are ready Medecynes to remove the iniurye and
disease of the Patient: And for my self I allege the corrupt propertye of
the time, whose nature is entangled with such confusion, that in few men is
found conformity of opinion, and much less to yield affection or meritte to
the honest endeavors of others, on whom (either by malice or ignorance) the
most sort do throw many nice errors, according to their imperfect fancies:
But as I doubt not, but Monophylo is able to be his own Champion, as being
armed with loyalty (the very virtue in love.) So I stand not now to allure
the popular favor (whose judgment wandereth in revolution and change) seeing
it is to your Ladyship, to whom I offer the censure of my traueyle, and in
whom is no less discression to discern, then deep modesty to pardon or
excuse: humbly beseeching you to receive this second exercise not as a
recompense worthy your last liberality, but as a simple testimony to
continue the reverent duty I owe you, until I bring forth my great work,
which I hope will more worthily resemble your high virtues, and with less
mourmure draw others to the knowledge of GOD, to whom I leave the success,
and your good Ladyshippe to his holy fear: At London, the sixth of April.
1572.

Your Ladyships readily to command, Geffray Fenton.

The first Book of Monophylo.
NOt long after the expedition of Germany, when the king, to the indifferent
shame and confusion of his enemies, raised the siege of Metz: certain Gentlemen
of no less conformity in nature and consanguinitie, than resembling one
another in society and neighborhood (seeing the wars dissolved, and the
danger for that year either prevented or provided for,) drew into a set
company to return to their houses, with expectation of new occasions to be
eftsoons employed. And after they had (some little time) dispensed with the
honest and chaste entertainments of their wives, disposing (withal) their
household and familiar affairs, they determined by mutual meetings, to
restore their late weary time in war with every honest pleasure, which
either the present season could stir up, or most conveniently agreed with
their state and condition: wherein, foreseeing the term of their delytes to
be but short, as most assured that the wars would revive, they erected by
common consent a law to visit one another mutually and generally, under this
special covenant, that as the husbands should not go vnaccompanyed of their
wives, to the end there should be a common communion of delight and benefit
in that fellowship, so, because there were many young gentlemen happily
unfurnished of wives the law gave strait charge to every married man and
master of famuly, as to whose lot should happen to receive and feast the
reast, to provide such most honest and best spoken gentlewomen as the place and
time could any ways afforde, so should there be an equal sort of company,
every one contented, and their progress run forth in exercise of all
honesty and honor, hoping by such means to recover the arrerages of that
pleasant season, which fortune had kept from them since the beginning of the
wars. This was their beginning and entry into their common wealth of
delytes: but, as they were not all of one conformity, either by an inequality
of years or manners, so every one made choice of his pleasure according to his
complexion and nature: the elder sort for the most part, reasoning in
contemplations most convenient to their age, and the young men contending in the
use and actiuitie of arms, together with all other exercises best consenting
to their humors.

Amongst the rest, Three chief men in this dialogue.
there were in this company three young Gentlemen of choice, not only well
proved in matters of war, but also of deep judgment in learning and
sciences, wherein the most part of their young years had been trained. These
three (of peculiar estimation above the reast) not to seem exempted from the
thing which most resembled their condition and age, protested most of all to
make an estate and profession of love, the same notwithstanding, as the
opinions of men be diverse, so every one in his own behalf according to his
peculiar affection: the one of them was so extreemely passioned with love, as
all his thoughts and devotions tended directly to his Mystresse, upon whom he
committed ydolatrie, as making her the only Idol of his secret
contemplations: him (in a special respect) will I pass under a covert name of
Monophylo: an other, not so deeply distressed as he, preferring a civil and
courteous behavior to the Ladies, seemed rather to hold an estate of a
Courtyer, then to profess singular love: he shall be disguised for this time
under the name of Glaphyro: but the last and youngest of them all delighting in
a liberty of affection, without any peculiar choice or regard, I will name for
one occasion Phylopolo: And these three, as they were diverse in judgments, so
their outward effects revealed a difference in their inward thoughts and
conceytes of mind: Glaphyro better stayed than the rest, enterneyd the Ladies
with honest discourse and exercise, having as many good parts in him as any
Gentleman of the troop: Phylopolo of the contrary disposed to mirth with
variety of delight and salace, tryfled with them with such a liuelye liberty
of speech and affection, that it could hardylye be judged whether of the two
were best accepted of the Ladies, either Glaphyro in his honestye, or Phylopolo
with his skoffes and pleasant toys, such was the order of both the one and
other accompanied with an equal grace and argument of delight. But Monophylo
seemed dyed in another complexion, as so settled in sorrow and solitary
regardes, that by the only heavy and dead carriage of his eye, might be
discerned the secret passion and disposition of his heart: the same being a
singular pleasure to me, and matter of consolation to my present case, as to
see him bleeding in ye same wound, which I judged before to be only peculyar
in my self, albeit as then it could not be easilye discerned by me: For
happening into that place by mean of a gentleman, my very friend, to govern
her who long before had made a stealth and possession of my heart, I had not
(with Monophylo) cause of malancholy conceit, as having before mine eyes the
only mistress of my felycities, who by happy adventure, being one of that
company, made me not only forget all my passions of her absence, but also
even my self to whom it seemed, her sweet deliuerye of speech consenting
with a gracious moving and disposition of her eyes, had power to pearce even
millions of hearts, yea the deytie it self* if by incorporation they had
vouchsafed to have bestowed their eyes upon my earthly Goddess: this or such
like infirmity did travel the languishing mind of poor Monophylo, and so
wrapte him in perplexities, that even the groves and meadows wherein he was
withdrawn to record his desolate state, seemed to impart with his sorrow, and
yield pity to his cries and scorching sighs: and as love carries always an
unquiet condition, hating (with the nature of an Ague) all things that stand
not in conformity with his appetite, so the more he saw us increase in delight
and pleasure, the more did he resolve into sorrow, as dispayring (I know not by
what destenie) of that whereupon depended the substance and full of his
felycitie: wherein certainly as it is one chief office in our christian duty to
use compassion to thafflicted, and such most of all incident to this bond, who
needing comfort, have been relieved accordingly, so for my part
notwithstanding I seemed translated and rapt above the third heaven ioying in
the benefit of the present season and place, yet I could not but yield
trybute to his sorrows with such effect of transitory confusion in my self,
as if I pleasured greatly in the vewe and proof of my present felicity, my
pity likewise was nothing inferior on the behalf of his tragical condition,
so that by how much I traveled in consideration of his case, even by so much I
felt my self drawn to an increase of compassion wishing it were lawful for me
to share and communicate mutually with him, as either to deck his garlande
with some of my flowers, and sprinckle him with the deawe of my delight and
contentment, or else to lay my shoulders under his burden, and so though I
restore him not altogether, yet his distress may be qualified, and he rest
satisfied of my honest meaning.

But now all the campanye abiding at the house of a Gentleman, one chief
director of this fellowship, amongst other discourses there moved (during the
first dinner) according to the custom of our excercises, certain speeches
fashioned to raise and exalte the invincible virtue of the King, togith^r with
the delivery of all Iermany, without stroke of sword, for the only fear of
him to whom the whole world is promised: The Ancients following their estate
of years and discression entertained grave discourses sometimes in matters of
a commonwealth, and sometimes touching the course and condition of our life,
but above all, they decyphered the nature of this earthly fragilitie, wherein
when we account us most near the resolute success of our business, it is
then we are found oftentimes by a divine mystery, no less far from it,
than before we held us sure of the end. With these voluntary speeches was also
drawn into argument this Question, how it happens and that by many examples
of proof, that a Captain, who in the first race of his life carrying (as it
were) fortune upon his shoulders, and happily preuayling in many attemptes of
equal peril and pollecie, should, in riper age which with long use ought to
(assure a more full and perfect experience) be in one instant, as though Fortune
were weary to favor him any longer, overthrown even by a young man, to whose
course and consent of nature, should be also a less lykelyhoode of proof and
experience in such affairs: here was Alexander esteemed most happy above all
his felicities, for that in the glory and flower of his years he gave end by
one self mean, to his life and virtues together and had not as then felt the
smarting whippes of fortune, who no doubt at length had philed him upon her
bedrole and prepared as much for him as for others of his faculty and place.
This argument ran through the whole company and found authority by many
and sundry reasons, as some transferring the guilt of such defaultes not to
fortune, but to our selves, who feeling us raised and puffed up with all
felicitye, do oftentimes so far forget our selves as being blinded with so
many happy chances, we become (as it were) out of breath in our selves,
without foreseeing how the wit and pollecie of other men lies always in wait
to aspire to that degree, whereunto, with the forwardenesse of our youth and
careful diligence, we labored in pretense to come, which reason as some of
them iustyfied by many examples, as in the person and success of Hanny
ball, when he gave himself over to the delights of Capua: so other passing
further, laid the whole occasion and cause to nature, who in all things of
this world does increase according to our proportion by little and little even
until the degree of extremity, and then begins to decline and yield to
infirmities, so as it seems, that successiuelye we all play arsiuersie. A
thing to be veryfied not only in singular men, but also by most huge
monarchies, wherein is found the age of infancy, virilytie or manhood, and
so old age which leads them to their ruin and fall: so that seeing nature is
their guide, it is not to be noted strange, if men, whose business in their
season have happily succeeded, and drawing to extreme age, though they grow
strong and mighty in council, yet become weak in the favors and benefits
of fortune. This was the manner and matter of discourse of these Gentlemen, who
seemed covertly to prognosticate somewhat of the present time, albeit with such
modesty, that without precise diligence and heed, the intent of their reasons
could not be easilye discerned: wherein albeit they were not understand of
every one, yet were they hard with singular and settled cares, with this
liberty, that every one gave his judgment a part as best agreed with his
peculiar fancy. But as they thus continued in variety of matter, falling
eftsoons into fresh occasions to entertain their arguments all that after
dinner, Phylopolo, (after the table uncovered) weighing (as it seemed) in an
ordinary delight such Philisophie, disposed himself to talk with a
Gentlewoman sitting next him, to whom he made this rouing question: Why
Madame, do not we resemble these good and ancient Capitaynes, who after a
long proof and practice in the affairs of their common wealths, forsaking
their estates and rule in cities, do choose the fielden life as there to
entertain the residue of their time to relieve and repose their old bodies
and weary minds: For so (as I have learned) did in old time Cyncynatus,
Curious, and at length that great Emperor Dyoclesian, to whom if the city
seemed a kind of prison, what belongs to us to do, that in the midst of
these fields (a place of pleasant and quiet solace) are yet stung with the
pricks and miseryes of this world, as having passed and learned more in this
little season of dinner while, then all those great personages, during their
most high and weighty affairs: To whom the Gentlewoman somewhat smyling (as
one no less modest in behavior and manners, than of deep insight in all other
virtues unknown to the ordinar^^ sort of women) made this answer. I know
not (sir) the compass and faculty of your judgment, and much less what
opinion you have of their speech, but sure for my part I have heard them not
without a singular delight and pleasure: only I doubt not but such discourses
seem improper enough to your age, which (in my judgment) delights more
naturally otherwise, as in exercises of actiuitie and value of the body, then
to tie your ears to these controversies: whereupon he desired her that without
offending their discourses, they might make their walk to some pleasant
medowe, there to choose their pastimes, no less convenient to their humors,
than to here the contencions of these old Gentlemen, neither concerning their
faculty, nor consenting with their fancy: What seigneur Phylopolo, answered
Charyelea (for so shall be her name at this time) are you yet to know of my
purpose to erect one day a school of Philosophy, wherewith both the one and
other laughed, when Glaphyro, whose place was over against her, and jealous
belyke of their common pleasure, till he was privy to the occasion, enforced
also the appointment as telling her, that it belonged to her both in reason and
honor, not to deny the request of the Gentleman, specially concerning an
equal contentment to them both: and for my part (says he) if either I were
worthy for company, or meet in other regard, I would it might not offend you
to name me a third, not to hold equal place and society with you, but only
to record, or at least lysten to such good matters as I ymagine will pass
amongst you before you depart. I see well (answered Charyclea, who perhaps was
no less weary than they of the exercise at dinner) that it were better to
make a simple consent at the first, than using the pollycie of long excuses, to
be constrained in the end to condiscende to your wills: and therefore both
the one and other of you shall be obeyed, not as in your request, seigneur
Glaphyro, to play the Register as you require, but rather to stand me in steed
of defense against seigneur Phylopolo, if he offer to play his part according
to his common custom: wherewith, after many protestations avowed by Phylopolo,
to attempt nothing contrary to her lyking, the Lady rose, and also the two
Gentlemen, who (after an honorable reverence to the company) led her by
either arm into a little grove, where at the first, they encountered the poor
Monophylo, languishing in heavy and doubtful thoughts, to whom as Glaphyro
yielded compassion in respect of the martiredome he endured, so Phylypolo made
a skoffe at his passion, as esteeming love no other thing than a substance of
follye: Notwithstanding, by the advice of Charyclea, (who foresaw the wrong
they should do him to trouble or break his contemplacions) they agreede to
visit him.

The place where he had shrouded himself contained such excellent art and
industry, together with such familyar respect to the disposition of that
company, that it seemed nature her self prepared it of purpose to assist ye
recreations of so honest personages: For there might you see a gallery of
conuenyent length, so well vawted and pauised above by natural slight, and
assistaunce of little twigges and sprayes that neither the heat of the sun,
nor vehemency of any wind could molest it: And the green arboure or grass
underneath kept in seemly proportion, and sorted with an infinite delicate
and small flowers, gave also such delight to the eye, that even the chirping
birds using their solace upon the tender sprayes, gave sufficient declaration
in what reverence and value they h^lde that shaded temple which
(notwithstanding) seemed far more beautified by the sacrifice of honor which
Monophylo offered in consecrating there his most secret and devout thoughts,
than by all the helps which nature or art had brought: And so finding this a
convenient palace for their devises, Chariclea undertaking the speech of all
her company, framed her behavior to the poor passioned Monophylo and said
unto him: Albeit (sir) in the argument, and outward vewe of your distress, I
find no less cause of compassion than my self redily inclined thereunto, yet
I can not but prepare complaint against you, as seeing you wholly resolved into
a state of sorrow, and that in these fields of solace, who (in respect of their
delightful vewe) ought not only to draw you to a disposition of joy and
pleasure, but also to consent with this honorable company in the exercise of
their most honest disportes: wherein by how much you see us delight in this
paradise of joy and mutual comfort, by so much we find you to settle and
give place to your sorrows, the same making us suspect, that either you grieve
in our common pleasure, or else languishe in some peculyar and secret
heaviness of mind, which if it pleased you to communicate, I believe there is
not one of us whose shoulders should not be offered to ease your burden,
wherein I presume to undertake and protest for these two gentlemen: But if that
which I judge worthy of pity in you, is but a pollecie of nature, your self
may as speedily cure the cause as you seem cunning to dissemble the smart,
whereunto I leave you, with this last advise, that the readiest mean to
relieve a grief, is to will to be eased: Madam says Monophylo, it is an
assured liberty to a free mind to give advise, but very hard for a man in
misery to admit any council, and let death be a due justice to him, who
under pollecye will dessemble torment, albeit some euilles carry this reverent
nature rather to be concealed with grief, then revealed in hope of remedy,
and it is a common wisdom to be as willing to be eased, as loath to suffer
smart, wherein for my part (good Madam) I yield you many humble thanks, and
no less to the Gentlemen, assuring you yt if there were virtue in you to give
order to my sorrows by how much less I have deserved it, even so much larger
should my bond stretch to labor to be thankful: And yet I pray you have
this opinion of my care and travel of mind, not to distende by chance, but
by a natural folly by which I am guilty of mine own evil: These be but
speeches at pleasure (says Phylopolo) neither can you make me believe that
heretofore I have not seen you better disposed, and therefore am ieylowse that
you have some eyle under the rock, which because you will not discover,
breeds you this confusion and dyuision of mind: And be it you confess it, as
the better to defend your condition, giving it such virtue or quality as by
concealing it, your grief would continue in one constaunt estate and as it
is, where in discovering it, would (with the canker) spread further, not unlike
the nature of a green wound, or a disease to whom the air is forbidden: yet
(under correctiou) the resemblaunce agrees not: for albeit the diseases of the
body require the abode and fellowship of the house, the sicknesses concerning
the spirit (according to the opinion of the Physicians of the soul) who be
the Philosophers, desire of the contrary, skope and air, as most proper for
their recovery: So that in greatest passions of love (from whom in my fancy
discendes the original of your present grief) albeit they have commonly
desired three things, to be solytarie, secret, and careful, yet the better
to direct these passions, they have not forbidden the society of an other them
self, into whose bosom they may assuredly distill the secret passions of
their minds, as by that mean the rather to give succors to a thousand small
disquiets and indispositions falling howerly into our fancies, either by a
false suspicion, or faint fear, which some call ielowsie, without the which
love can no more be, than a body without a soul: here Monophylo, seeing an
entry into the field wherein he most delighted to walk (as to speak of love
the only moouer of his disquiet) began to enter into a fresh stomach, and as
one cunningly clawed, where it pleasa^tly ytched, prepared himself to play his
part, when by good adventure, and to entertain for an hour my inconstant
thoughts, I was also withdrawn thither without any suspicion at all of their
purpose, albeit seeing their manner, arguing their further intent, I shrouded
my self subtillie in a tuffe of young trees the better to impart with their
discourse, using rather silence than offer of speech, the better to understand
their issue which fell out in sort, as you may read in the sequel of this
Dialoge: For Monophylo considering the importunitye of their requests, and
under what conditions they require him to discover the cause and state of his
sorrow, break of at last his weary silence, and began to unfold in what
value and estimation he held love, and also that to him only belonged to speak
of him and his laws: But to describe him in deed in his true degree, I think
there was never any so deeply pinched with the miseries of love, nor more
honored him in his common behavior than this Monophylo, in whom was settled
such a resolute jealousy, that only he (in his fancy) was worthy to speak
of love, whose heart languished and labored in the present motion, or at least
had sometime in his life made experience of his stinges, and not that
unpolished rowte of old Philosophers, or other of lea^e heavy and gross
judgments, who tasting only the outward rynde, had never the faculty to
decerne the true sense and virtue of love: seeing, to such people it was
always forbidden to speak of love, according as we read of the priests in
old time, who because they would not have the mysteryes of their sacrosauntos
profane, would not suffer strangers to handle or use them: by whose example,
Monophylo, as a true and simple minister in love, stryuing still to sound and
make further way to the speech of Phylopolo, said unto him: such philosophers
(sir) have judged, as blind men descerne of colors, even so they are to be
pardoned, as men at unawares speaking impertinently. For as they professed no
inclynation to love, so, standing inexperienced in such fittes as you note in
me, they must needs be also ignorant either how to govern him or guide
themselves. I know not, says Phylopolo, in what sort you direct your opinion,
but in my fancy and common reason, it is far more easy to such as bestow
their time and study in contemplation, to judge in these affairs, then to any
who have no further skoape than within this Dedalus, where they labor in such
variety and confusion of mind, that they are not only ignorant in matters
necessary for their knowledge, but also we see them deu^sted of all sense,
brain, and spirit, yea sometimes they loose even the remembrance of
themselves. You know, that to get the name of a good Physician, is not
requisite to lie long sick, and to merit the praise of an excellent Lawyer,
is not meet to have many suits in his proper and private name: But of the
contrary, in respect of the motions and troubles traueiling diversely the minds
of men, it stands against the common order of physic, that the Physician cure
himself, or minister by his own counsel only: and to the Advocate it is
defended to plead in his own cause, as in regard of a certain imperfection
of spirit unknown to him: and lastly experience and nature agree, that our
judgments are more sound and upright in cases of strangers, than in our
own causes. This comparison (says Monophylo) albeit at the first show
appears not impertinent, yet, touching the case which is offered, I pray you
let me ask you, seigneur Phylopolo, whether it were not superfluous to give
counsel in love to such, who being exempted from his laws, seem also void
of need to be either warned or instructed: wherein, if in such respect, such
Philosophy is no less improper, than inprofitable, would it not become a
greater scorn and mockery to any, who never proouing the rules and use of
Geometry, would yet undertake to give precepts of that art before Ptolomeus:
Likewise, who in the profession of an Orator or eloquence, would offer to
instruct Cicero, or who living always without use and judgment in arms, and
no less in exercysed in the guide and charge of an army, would direct
Hannibal in matters of war, should not he be valued with Phormio, that is
rude and gross, as Phormio was judged by Hannibal, when he presumed to lead
that worthy Captain in the Art wherein stood his greatest skill and
profession. If these be notes of vanity in these insolent men, what less
imputation of folly can you lay to your worthy schoolemaysters, whom you will
have to instruct such, as being already forward and advanced in love are
able to learn more in a moment of themselves, than by the books or
persuasions of all those smatterers of Philosophy, altogether without
experience that way. And, in the truth of your own fancy and conscience, I
ask you seigneur Phylopolo, to which of these two would you give more faith,
either to an Amadis of gawle figured by our Romans for a pattern of true and
loyal love, or to Xenocrates, who having not so much as a nose to smell the
true sent of love, may rightly be compared to a stone, for that using company
one night with a Gentlewoman singularly fair, was not of power so much as to
touch her, notwithstanding her delicate and intysing allurements. And yet you
will erect such one to prescribe us precepts of government in this Art:
wherein offering to pass further, Charyclea intercepted him, as not willinge
to give him further liberty of speech till he had satisfied her in one point.
And seeing (says she) our mutual talk of one to another, seeks in this
sort to succeed to matter of argument, I will leave the motion and pursuit of
your disputations, grounded (as it seems) to sift the cause of your
proplexitie, and refer to your good and wise discretions the resolution of
that, wherewith you seem to torment your selves in vain, in which seigneur
Monophylo, it may be, I will make my self one of your side, but not in y^
process which I promise to try with you unless you change opinion. And
therefore, the cause being no less grave in it self, than requiring precise
consideration, let us take breath a little in this arbor, before I prefer ye
point wherein I mean to accuse you in the hearing and witness of these two
Gentlemen, who are to stand as Judges, if with wrong, I bear part against
you: and so entering the Arbor, they made themselves seats of sweet herbs
and flowers, wherein being set every one at his ease, according to the favor
and consent of the place: Madame Charyclea, with a countenance of pleasant
anger, roaued at Monophylo, in this sort: it is you seigneur Monophylo, upon
whom I am to give the charge, if (as they say) you supply not the pageaunt
with an other part, because your last speech (as I think) tendes to a false
blame of the good Philosopher Xenocrates, as not to incline readily to the will
of a woman, notwithstanding she was favored with every perfection in beauty:
would you maintain, that a man possessing such happy place, merits
sinisterly, if he depart either without doing sacrifice to his pleasure, or
adding execution to the advantage of his time and place: what do you know
whether this Xenocrates had his heart consecrated to another Lady, and being
so, would you (as you seem) make it a strange and rare virtue, or wonder at
his chaste government, as to observe loyalty where he had already pawnde his
faith, or that he with honesty used abstinence, where he could not use
appetyte without offense: yea this trial passing natural peril without
stain, approoues his virtue in respect of temperaunce duly requisite in a man,
and assures his affection to his former maistresse, to whom he gave neither
cause of jealous fear, nor doubt of actual wrong: which she pronounced with
such modesty and behavior of delight, that the whole little troop fell into
a soft murmr or secret whispering, as of the dealings of that mortified
Lover, whose austeritie was not unknown to any of that fellowship,
notwithstanding Phylopolo, to satisfy her demand, prevented Monophylo, and
answered her: be it Madame (says he) that Monophylo took it so, and that
your sayings carried truth, would you think notwithstanding that opinion to be
erroneous: touching my self, I would judge him of slender wit and less
discretion (what profession of love soever he published in any singular place)
who standing in possession of the time and opportunity, would let slip the
occasion, as being without the power or pollecie of man eftsoons to be
recovered. Liberty of speech (says the Lady) discovers truly the
inconstancy of thoughts, and words pronounced for pleasure, dissemble
commonly the meaning of the mind, even like a light feather tossed with a
voluntary wind, which rightly is verified in you, in the matter of your
opinion, which I doubt not, differs enough from the consent and judgment of
your thoughts. But what say you seigneur Monophylo, what faith can you afoorde
to his sayings? Oh Madame (says he) God defend that my mouth should deliver
such speech: yea, if I were guilty but in thought, I would restore the fault
with criminal penance, and laying my self upon the sentence of all Ladies, I
would endure mortal punishment as a mylde justice. Neither meant I to
reprehende Xenocrates for such dealing, if his devotion were vowed to another
saint, seeing that as his virtue acquites him from blame, so his constancy
merits above the best, as having made a singular bequest of his heart, he
continued no less firm and stable, than a hard rock bestowed in the midst
of devouring waves: And touching the phra^e of seign^ur phylopolo, besides that
I wype my hands of such judgment, yet (in the testimony of an undefiled
conscience) I protest here to abhor his opinion, notwithstanding it be
grounded upon good and ancient laws, drawn out of the Registers of Venus
Temple at Rome, whose tenor bare express permission to execute our actual
will on all as occasion offered: having also for my self the authority of
custom settled by long distent of time into the minds of men, to the which it
were lawful for me to have recourse if the law should fail me. But I fear
greatly, says Chariclea, that law never found place in the Chapter house,
albeit it were enrolled in the temple of Venus, nor published through the whole
temple, but only to such as stood on the ridge and battlements of the Church
and not to others, who chose their residence within the heart, and they either
may pretend the law not to be general, or at least allege ignorance to
understand it: And touching your recourse to custom (as you threaten) you are
not now to know that such corruption of manners, gotten by an usurped use, do
not merit the name of custom: for so (to shadow and cover our faults by
nature and worldly infection) might we hold by the same reason, that the vices
whereunto we are inclyned since the sin of our first father, have woonne the
name of custume lawful and valable: which speech so shaked phylopolo, that
fore bearing to offer any further question, they found matter enough to treat
upon. And therefore renewing the charge upon Charyclea against loyalty, I
fear Madame (says he) that if you and I should enter this combat, the issue
would stand so hard between us, as the doubt would follow who should
glory in the victory, seeing indifferent errors would rise on both sides:
And I think singularity is no less displeasing to God, than if a man made
division of his heart to many women, seeing amongst the reast, it brings this
loathsome inconvenience, that the love of men to women being extreme, and a
rage above all other passions, makes us oftentimes forsake the love of God, and
ymagin our God to rest in them, as if we should do worship to Idols, whose
nature is under vain resemblances, to corrupt the devotion of men: a thing so
common in example, that to a sensible judgment, a slender rehersall may
suffice: only I pray you remember many millions af great estates, whose life
(so long as they were governed with numbers of Concubines) never fell into
actual stain or populer obloquie, but when they laid themselves upon the
rule of one only, they became so ravished in fancy and affection, that by the
testimony of the hystories, their confusion proved not only hurtful to
themselves, but hateful to their common wealth and people: as what business
(in common experience) succeedes most commonly more unhappily, then where the
affection is parshiall, and the party led in a singular council, which may be
corrupted either in advise or action. We see also by natural reason, that a
thing dispersed and dissipated, is never so sharp and cruel, as that which is
undivided: And therefore Madam I think it not inconvenient to the humor and
appetite of man, and far better for the suerty of his delight, to make a
general estimation of all Ladies, then under a shadow of loyalty, drawing
after one imperfect scent, to move his own skorne to all the world. Here
Monophylo to whom as the cause of loyalty was more dear than to the Lady, so
he challenged before her the revenge of this blasphemy in this sort: mark good
Lady I beseech you, with what rethorike this Gentleman seeks to cloak a huge
vice under a high cover, which is God: Why did he not infer by the same
mean, that marriage is not good according to the present observation and
testimony of the holy laws, but rather (after Mahomets order) to give a
liberty of many wives at one time, to the end that sparing to set our heart
upon one, we put not also in hazard to forget our love to God: Be your own
judge, seigneur Phylopolo and pronounce sentence against your own error, which
in effect, resembles the ancient Cinikes, who in their fond imagination of a
commonwealth, would erect a community of women, and that in general use and
degree. Which opinion notwithstanding (as it well deserved) was banished from
all free states well governed: But why do I stand upon strange
contemplations, seeing our City of Christendom does warn us sufficiently in
this: For read we not on all sides that the conjunction of one man, to one
woman is only required: yea, albeit second marriages are tolerated by Gods
law and man's pollecie, yet were they never found so sweet a sacrifice either
to God or men, as the first, and that in respect of this corporal communion
distributed into many places: God gave to Adam at his first entry into this
world, one wife and no more, which he drew out of his bones, as to advertise
us of the indissoluble amity which we ought to bear to our wives, yea, he
commaundes us to forsake father and mother (to whom notwithstanding all law of
nature prouides a sovereign obedience) to stick one to a another: And
therefore me thinks seigneur Phylopolo, with great wrong you labor to exempt
us from this extreme amity of one to one, which God himself has not only
recommended, but straightly commanded unto us: It may be you will choke me
here with a sinister construction of this text, as that it includes mention of
marriage, and our speech runs in a course of simple love, wherein I pray you
let me thus far advise you that where you pretend in your defense against my
Lady Charyclea, to pauish your opinion under some shadow of virtue, there will
be found on her side a more true and lively image of divinity, than in all
the reasons you can allege: being sorry from the bottom of my heart (which
here I pronounce in the sight and testimony of God) that we m^st be driven to
erect a double kind of love, as one to consist in marriage and the other
without.

At the first, when all marriages were established under a mutual love
according to Gods ordinance, there was not this distinction amongst men, till
by corruption of times manners began to decline, when also crept in this
difference in love, y^ same being at the first introduction of dowries when the
lawyers (incensed upon a wicked consideration) to draw men the rather to this
reciprocal conjunction (whereunto nature sufficiently inclined them) brought
them into their common wealths: and for the same respect and reason, were
enforced to provide infinite laws for adulteries, because that proouing the
inconueniencie wherein by indiscression they were fallen, as to have taken from
marriage part of his accustomed amity (and supplied it with their hurtful
dowries) necessity drive them the better to entertain their diseased common
wealth, to seek out a new medecin, which was by restraining such as should
defile those marriages, notwithstanding their own constitutions had made them
already corrupted: for a true testimonye whereof you shall find it justified
in the common wealth of Sparta where the wise lawmaker Licurgus, would raise no
law against adultery, as not to bring that vice into the knowledge of his
Citizens: And what was it that kept it from their knowledge: not that they were
not moved with the stinges of nature, as well as other people and nations: But
rather this excellent and holy ordinance. By the which that grave lawgiuer
and Philosopher shutting all dowries out of his common wealth, would not that
marriages should proceed upon any other pretense than by an only and har^ie
love: So that it is not to be marueyled, if such as enter that holy state at
this day defiling their affections, with couenauntes and conditions of money,
find this difference in love to the great blemishe and often prejudice of
their husbands, who not being truly and equally cuppled, see their wives for
the most part delight in an other, to whom it seems the heavens had
predestinate them from the beginning: But now seigneur Phylopolo, if in marriage
(which at this day contractes not but under a desire of wealth and goods)
there be required another duty and care of loyalty, suer we are bound in
simple love, yea, even on the behalf of a married woman, if our affection
chance to settle or draw that way wherein if I waded yet further, as well the
matter it self as the innocencye of my meaning, are to clear me of
imputation, and to maintain a truth, all speech is tolerable, seeing the
truth it self caryeth such a modest countenance, that though she use
silence, yet she satisfies by ymagination, so that if I spare to enforce
further proof, I hope you will not turn my modesty to want of matter, no
more than the hounde, that forbeares to hunt when he has killed the chase,
deserves to be rebuked. And so persuading that the laws civil are not of
equal force with the instinctes of nature, it shall stand as the opinion
wherein I will settle and resolve, with this last lesson, that who in a true
and indessembled love, has bequeathed his heart to any singular Mystresse, is
bound to no less chaste behauior to all other Ladies, in respect of her, than
sillye Zenocrates to his Goddess Phryena, from whom the occasion and
authority of our talk did move. Here Phylopolo rather to stir up the
company, then renew the occasion and no less tickled with his reasons, than
loath to be foiled in that presence prepared to answer in this sort: I see
well seigneur Monophylo, that in us shall be veryfied the old saying, that one
fable draws on another, seeing that by how much you advance the authority
of your matter, by so much do you sommon me to maintain the defense, not
only touching the point of our present question, but also in others according
to the variety of your proofs, which if I would encounter as I might, and
the matter requyres, I fear that as well you as I should easily slip into a
Quagmire, whereof the delivery or issue would be hard: and yet I will not
altogether answer you with silence, specially where the matter it self
favors my opinion. And albeit your places and textes of marriage which you
have here preferred to give your mutual love, a deeper authority, concern
little or nothing our purpose, yet as far as my faculty will stretch, and
your consent incline, I will speak my fancy, and leave you satisfied. I
resemble (you say) Mahomet, who allowed many wives at one time, or else the
ancient Cinykes, amongst whom the community of wives was tolerable: only I
wish it had sufficed you to apply their authorityes, albeit they are neither
proper to your purpose, nor apt to the matter, and forborne simply their
names, whose remembrance cannot be without hate. But I pray you, how have you
learned that the marriage of one to one, is better, than that of one to many,
but of the law? the which notwithstanding, if by way of argument it were
lawful for us to exempt, (as our thoughts are free) think you, my last
marriage is not armed with defense as well as your first: wherein if amongst
all other creatures, nature raised up man only, for the procreation, inducing
us, (the better to entertain this human society) to cope one with another,
can you deny, that the conjunction of one with many is not greater, than to
couple fellowship with one only woman: and yet seigneur Monophylo, I stand not
resolute in that opinion, seeing, that besides we have the law written, which
in this behalf binds both our thought and words, yet in upright judgment,
the knot of such maryages would remain imperfect, for that in this condition,
the man would find out an advantage above the wife: seeing, that being all
reciprocally enclyned to the stynges and motions of nature, which one of us
could ever be able to furnishe contentment and lyking to them all: and so
should this conjunction be defective, but not unfurnished of apparaunce and
likelyhoode of reason. But what need we run so far into maryages, with the
which our conference has nothing common, saving, that having no better means
to approve your goodly loyalty, you were glad in the beginning to make them
stand you in turn, but now, with the knowledge of your fault, you have also
confessed the error of them, as not only cutting them of in the end of your
speech, but also that you enter into terms against their part. And touching
that you lay against me, for the community of wives, I stand as free from
such meaning as far from that thought, (albeit I could march under the
authority, not only of the Cynickes, but of the Stoykes, together with all
these people and nations sometimes called Messagettes, yea even with Platos
doctrine, mainteyning still, that in a common wealth, he is more perilous, and
of nearer affinity to the vain Cynikes, who applies his pretense and
practice to one married Gentlewoman (as you esteem) to the end to fashion her
proper and peculiar to himself, than another, who without stay takes his
flight into all places, according to the offer and favor of every happy wind:
a thing whereof I promise you to make declaration, hoping by the same mean,
that of your self, you will apply to your self the wrong, which wrongfully
you heap upon me. To mainteyne simply any good order, or civil policy to
be in the community of women (as the Cynikes hold) would appear to every
one but froth of speech, not much unlike to such, whom time and variety of
argument can not make weary, in the question whether a confused conversation
of goods be more convenient to mankind, than a division, in sort as we
observe it at this day: and what profit would rise to put in controversy a
thing that could not happen in use: and yet there be sorts of people, whereof
some desire generally of goods, and some delight in community of women:
wherein before we pass further, was not (I pray you) that community of goods
better esteemed in the ancient common wealth of the Lacedaemonians, where
theftes and pillage were tolerated, then in the state of Rome, where thieves
and robbers were double punished: wherein as I will not enter into your fancy,
so for my self, I presume ever upright judgment will consent with me in
opinion, no less for the quality of the matter, which in it self is
assuredly grave, then in respect of the conformity of the reasons and proofs
assisted with undoubted authority. Let us then discende from transitory
goods, to women in general (which seem to have a certain resemblaunce one
of the other) and so we shall find with whether of the two common wealths your
opinion has most conformity: you allow loyalty, with tolleration also that
a woman married give her self to her peculiar friend, the same resembling the
ordinance of Lycurgus who by a privy theft would practice to himself a thing
which notwithstanding by the law belonged to another: wherein what confusion do
you indiscretely admit, as to leave nothing in particular to men, but that
whereunto your nature does draw you, and having conquered the good will of a
Lady, you will have Idolatry committed, and that rather under a vain and
fond self fancy, then in any true title of the loyalty you speak of:
wherein seigneur Monophylo, (besides the error of this community wherein you
are slipped unadvisedly) you comprehend not rightly in my judgment the order of
every nature. For if al things in the world have their seasons, wherein they
fall successively from one to an other, may it not stand with the same reason,
that being come to the mark whereunto we did pretend, we resign and give up
our place to another: if the four seasons of the year should stand in this
difference, as the one falling into seasonable opportunity with us, and his
term expyred, would not make place to another, as the Spring time to Summer,
the Summer to Autumn, and lastly Autumn to Winter, would you not think the
fatal ruin and reuersement of the world to be at hand: every thing is
appointed by heavenly influence to take his time, as we have seen in example
most mighty Monarchies by an enterchaunge and revolution of things, to be
translated from one people to another, as the Assyrians to the Medes, the same
to the Persians, then to the Greeks, then to the Romans, and lastly reuerted
once again to the Greeks, so that you dream in vanity, if that you think
to establishe an eternity in this world, and much less plant a perpetual
will so long as you abide upon earth: neither does nature suffer it, who to
declare to us how much she delighted in this great variety, became disguised
hirselfe in an hundredth thousand sorts for our use: and not only in things
concerning our conversation and use, but in infinite other mutations and
chaunges, whereof as she reserues to hirselfe the number, so also we see this
first substance which God endeavored to make incorruptible in this world, take
notwithstanding diverse forms, according to the revolution of times: and yet
seigneur Monophylo, you, either scarcely acknowledging nature, or else
disdainfullye dispysing her lore, would remain always one, as though there
were no mutabilitie, either by destiny, or worldly casualtie.

Besides, what profession of honor make you, in embasing so much your mind,
as having practiced only one Gentlewoman, you dare not adventure upon a higher
enterprise. For my part, as I esteem most in a man, diligence and high
courage, the better to merit and win the price of such a pray, so also,
dwelling in the conquest of it, without stomach eftsoons to venture in a
victory of more majesty and state, cannot escape the note of a cowardly
mind, not unlike the barbarous peasant, who noseled in vile and base
exercises, dare not lift up his mind to aspire to greater things: why then
shall any man be of such negligent and low stomach, as to bring his mind
within singular lymit, seeing the more conquestes he perfourmes, the further
resounds his value and estimation: if Alexander had sufficed in the mighty
estate of his own kingdom, had he ever come to possess the universal
Monarchy: and yet not contenting with the general Empire, he sought still to
apply his victoryes to attemptes of far more high and deep peril if either
by the power or pollecie of man, he could have sought out more worlds:
wherein as (by his example) it stands not with the nature of a valiant mind,
to be content with a little, so he that limittes his glory, is unworthy of
it, and he least meritorious of commendation with whom singularity stands in
value, and will not enforce a further proof and assay of his virtue: to
encroche somewhat upon the lands and marches of an other, but to establishe a
perpetual property, me thinks should be to cut of a traffic and mart
amongst men, for a common enterteynment of this human society: have you not
heard of the comparison which the ancient Roman exhibyted to the people of
Rome, to make them knitte and enter conjunction with the Senators, as
representing unto them the body of man, which no doubt would easily dissolve
and grow to end without the mutual aid and traffic which passes in the
members one to another: in which sort were brought into all common wealths,
sales, bargaynes, purchases disposition of places, loanes, borowings, tributes,
and beneuolences, upon the which only I pretend so to make my ground, that
in acknowledging the benefit which I receive, the husbands of the other side
find a thousand courtesies and friendships at my hand, which otherwise they
should in no respect p^rticipate with all: wherein common reason leads me in
this thankful humor, that if I borrowe familiarity on them for a time, I can
do no less, then in confessing the benefit, to become thankful for their
friendship. where you Monophylo, with all others favorers of your persuasion,
disposing all your study to be come tributarie to one mistress only, all the
pleasure you receive is a short death or quick dispatch of a poor and innocent
husband. By which may be easily deserned, what troubles rise with your reasons,
as accomplishing your stelthes and amorous theftes with unnatural
manslaughter, where, of the contrary, as well your self as the present
assistants are able to consider (I doubt not) what benefit distendes with
mine, moving by a greater bond and unity amongst men, then the laws by
their threats and commandments: wherewith he ceased his further speech
not without cause of pleasant laughter to all the company, the rather for that
all his discourse run in a vain of such pleasant and frank regard, that
it could be hardly judged, whether he argued at pleasure, or spoke as he
thought: When Madam Charyclea,, not yet forbearing to smile and laugh, told
him he was a noble soldier, but perhaps says she, a greater conqueror then
that mighty Alexander, whom you profess to imitate, I mean in acts of
valyauncie, such as you seek to apply your mind unto, which notwithstanding
you seem much to deface and abuse by your comparison of merchandise, which
upon the end of your speech, you seem to match with your brave and high
enterprises, the same proouing (in my fear) no less dishonor to you, than to
him that of a noble man becomes a Merchant: But take heed seigneur Phylopolo,
and stick not to repose credyte in my council, that being (as you profess) a
general traficor, and borowing at a high interest, that when you fall into
the state of marriage, your debtes be not paid with a doubble usury: the same
being the common experience of the present time, that who burns with the
flame, is commonly scorched with the smoke, as every offense has his just
punishment in his due season. But for your part ( seigneur Monophylo) albeit I
had no intent at all to make my self any party to your quarrel (seeing you
stood on my side) but rather to leave it to the censure of you two at your
pleasures: yet notwithstanding I consent with you in all the rest, I fear
shall hardly favor your opinion, that our lover pretend and mainetaine a
perfect loyalty toward the married Gentlewoman: wherein, if you had provided a
behavior of the husband toward his wife of no less integrity than that
which he desires in her, you had used the nature of an upright judge, and your
judgment had stand as an indoubted authority: But to agree with you, that
she on whom is laid the yoke of marriage, is bound to bear respect or
reverence to any other, than to him who though not nature, yet the ceremony of
the law has tied unto her, were to admit a general and hurtful confusion
no less than when the negligent Physician giving liberty to a corrupt humor,
lettes it grow to a canker to the general hazard of the whole body: And
cutting from her all freedom to transgress those lymits, who dare attempt
with you, to give her lib^rtie of loyalty to strangers, whom she is bound
to use but in a general friendeshippe: For be it, we have some lykelyhoode of
reason to content our affection, because nature inclines us to it, yet we ought
to love with moderation, both because it so pleases the laws, and also
conducible to a pollityke government: otherwise we should bring in a huge and
confused Chaos, as not to be able to discern (under the shadow of this mutual
amity) to whom a wife is due, either to him which loves perfitlye and is not
married, or to the husband who only is induced to take a wife in respect of
substance and wealth, wherewith (for my part) I can not consent, seeing that
albeit, a husband be imperfect in many things, to allure and draw love, yet
it is a Christian duty in the wife to love him only because God has made him
her husband: and much less can I allow the subtle tie of him, who having
intised a woman to confess that the Ox, house, or feelde of her neighbor
being better than her own, should be also more acceptable and welcome to her,
would therefore successively conclude (ymagining to hold her in his nets)
that she should owe more love to her neighbor, if he seemed of better taste,
than to her husband: his error being monstrous in it self, is also to be
defaced with sundry reasons: for the wife albeit he for whom she is provided,
is neither rich, fair nor fashioned with equal cause of delight to others,
yea be it that without consent of affection she be thrust to him, yet in the
former respects, she ought to moderate in him, and so temper the passion of
her lot, that no unbridled infirmity appear: wherein let her make familyer
with her self, the modest answer of a virtuous matrone in Rome to her
husband, who falling into angrye terms with her, for that in the long season
and time of their fellowship together, she had not told him the ill savor of
his breath, which in strange company was straungely reproched against him: in
good faith husband (says she) I thought all other men's breathe carried the
like savor: so that a woman ought to make the beawtie and bounty of her
husband a looking glass to resolve her fancy and indgement, and not to
ymagine a deeper perfection, then in his person: yea, and if she happen by
blind concupiscence to use ne^ligence in this duty, let her take advise of
reason, to intercept and break that whereunto not her nature, but a disordered
will does enforce and thrust her, otherwise if your opinion should be favored
with authority it might be applied to other matters of no less injustice,
when by a foolish motion they seem acceptable to us: a thing, which ought not
to be suffered, and therefore for our better asistaunce, the laws are
delivered as a bridle to our fleshely desires, which we could not sometimes
subdue without fear to incur punishment, for which cause in common wealths
was allowed a cohercion of adulteries for such as should offend against the
statutes of marriage, and that only to encounter our human frailetie, and not
for any matter in dowries as is imputed, who much less that they were
impedimentes to maryages, (seeing of the contrary) they gave quick
furtheraunce and high dignity to wedlock: what if I prove seigneur
Monophylo, For dowryes.
by invincible reasons, that by wise and discreet advise, dowries have been
thought necessary for the intertainement of this society of man: will you not
confess to me, that notwithstanding for the only consideration of dowries
marriages did begin, yet for all that they must not be restrained in any sort:
in deed if we were in that golden time, when was erected the first institution
of marriage, I confess a certain conformytie of reason to your present
opinion, and that we ought to knit with our wives for favor sake only without
respect, because in that first time, people were not subject to such variety
of afflictions and miseries as at this day, seeing, without labor or pain,
they lived in the favor and good pleasure of the earth, who not then drawn
into custom, nor yet weary to bear fruits, refused to be tilled as since
she has required, by means whereof they enjoyed all things in common without
discord, neither was there any separation or distinction of things, and
therefore it was lawful for them in such foyson and mass of wealth, to make
their pleasure pryuye to their choice, and may only for affection without
covenant or condition of gold or silver, which as we see at this day happen
to some great Lords, who want neither power nor mean to entertain their
wives in what proporcion they like best: So touching us, whom nature and
fortune have so liberally imparted there treasors, methinkes we stand upon a
weak understanding if under the only consideration of love, without other
necessary care, we enter this bond of marriage: we must live with our wives, I
mean we are bound to continue the port of their estate, to feed them and
norish our children and famuly, and so succor their diseases, as no
inconvenience happen: of all which travels and pains, the only burden restes
upon the hus^^^^e, according to the provision of the eternal and infallible
wisdom of that mighty and sovereign judge in Haven. Will you then confound
your self, and reuerse your whole house, through a vain and fond suggestion
stirring sinisterly in your mind: if in your common wealth of Lacedemonia
(whose authority you have used) the people had been so disordered, as was the
nation of Rome, when the wise Lawyers brought in dowries, I believe your
Lycurgus (so peculyarly esteemed above the rest) would have used no less
pollecie to his Lacedaemonians, than the other magistrates to reduce and
establish their people: for the Lawyer, to such as he would form and
institute, prescribes with the good Physician to his pacient, whom he
suffers sometimes to taste unwholesome brothes, to the end to give him a
quick appetite to better meats: but if he should restrain or tie him to
one singular observation of his straight precepts, his peril might prove
mortal, and his recovery doubtful: even so is it with the Lawyers, who in a
general corruption of manners applying themselves oftentimes to the wills and
humors of their subjects, find it necessary to tolerate vice, in respect
to advance virtue and good things, the same happening in the example of
dowries, which for such respect and reason have been found necessary in
marriage, being no other thing than a common socyetie: And if amongst
merchants, the better to entertain their traficke, yet be lawful for one to
furnish the charge, in counterchaunge of another that affordes his diligence,
what ought we to think in this association of man to woman, whereof (as I have
said,) all the brunt and matter touching this human practice dependes on the
wit and policy of the man: sure ( seigneur Monophylo) I can not make of it
other than very inconvenient (albeit my opinion run directlye against mine
own condition and sex) that only husbands should be clogged with this double
yoke and burden (I mean both to afforde the pain, and contribute with the
gain) and that the wife should be left to her delight and pleasure without
other care than such as is voluntary unto her: Let then this little that I have
said, suffice to prove a necessity of dowries in the course of marriages, and
yet not so necessary, as under color of a corrupt nature, either man nor woman
(transgressing all order of policy) do pretend to violate the laws of
chastity ordained in marriages: Wherewith Charyclea, ended and gave liberty of
speech to Monophylo, who after his waspishe manner replied in this sort. This
language Madame is not inconvenient to your condition, as being either
partial in the matter, or party to the cause, albeit (for mine own part)
happening not long since into socyetie with Gentlemen of value, amongst whom,
as their grew question of our present argument, and maintained by the self
reasons of your defense, there was one amongst the rest of no less aptness
in speech then deep judgment, who undertook to impugn both the matter and
his voluble opinion, which it may like you to suffer me to recyte, seeing the
occasion requyres it: Of Marriages for money.
I find (says he) great reason in your words, but better could I allow your
opinion, were it not that love is above all your statutes and polletykes of
man: hoping you will thus far consent with me, that where nature speaks,
love must keep silence, specially where she contendes against him: as for
example, how can all our positive laws enforced to their greatest power,
dissolve this proximitie of blood and parentage which we have one of another,
so long as we rest upon earth: it may be you will say, that for some fault or
offense, they will sometime bereave us of the right which seems to belong to
us by the mean of parentage: but they cannot cut of consanguinitie by which we
are knit together from our nativity: Because nature only, and not the laws
has laid that foundation, and perfected the work: euenso in a marriage
contracted only under a pretense of dowry, you must not think that the law
who admittes such tolleration, has any power at all to wrest the course of our
true nature: not that I would fashion a Chaos in common wealths according to
men's ymaginations: obedience and society are due to husbands by civil band:
but the singular affection to our peculiar friends, is within the compass of
a natural duty, wherein I believe that the laws (albeit they have made no
public determination) are notwithstanding covertly miscontented with such
reciprocal friendships: and if in times past (as also at this day) only in
respect of a natural appetite inducible to pity, have excused the execution
of vengeance upon any act of oppression, yea though it stretched so far as
murder, which of it self is punishable by all authority and policy: what
ought we to esteem of love, who (being no other then a self nature) caryeth
oftentimes against our wills, our affections, with constraint to love
diversely: neither do I think that the pain and statute for adulterers (the
only remedy for maryages) was raised against such, as in a violent affection
do vow their hearts to one mystresse: but rather to bridle these ^morous
scoffers (who as of a set mind to dally and dissemble) lay siege to every
place, as they who in a privy watch or ambushe put the revenge of their
enimyes to execution: like as I think you shall find justified in the common
wealth of Athens, wherein for a time, it was suffered to the women, not able to
conceive by her husband, to raise generation with an other whom she loved,
with this provision, that the fruit springing of her should be esteemed the
act of her husband, by which (in my opinion) the common wealth was never the
more disordered, but rather governed with more quiet and concord of mind and
manners, because that satisfying their civil ordinances, they contented
withal, those which nature only (without other mean) taught them. And yet
could I be better contented, (the better to incercept all such occasions) if,
cutting of altogether our opinion of dowries, we entered this yoke of marriage
under a simple pretense and motion of affection only: for touching where they
may be mainteyned and made necessary in respect of a pollitike estate, I do
not only disalowe it, but also of the contrary, I think they are the first
and original ground of the greatest part of disquietes that thunder upon
married men. And for your estate pollitike, I pray you of what dependes this
human fellowship, which we have named mutual entertainment, if not of a
reciprocal friendship which we ought to bear one to another, the same being
defaced by this wicked invention of dowries. For if I chance to settle in
affection with a maid of base condition, and by a tolerable suggestion of
nature, proceed with her in holy marriage, shall I not run into a populer
obloquie, as proclayming in me an act and example of wilful folly? yea my
friends will contest against me: my companions concur in common imputation:
and my parents eschew me and my choice with unnatural grudge, as to have
myngled my descent with a match of inferior estate (such is the impression
and regard of dowryes) where they discern not that in this I have found my
Paradise, and by the other I should have run hedlong into hell, for as well
the one as the other, are comprehended under the name of marriage: But if in a
greedy desire of gold and transitory dross, I practice a Lady of equal
place and value to my self, then that blind ignorance commendes and
congratulates with me, as esteeming that for my benefit, which in deed
conuertes to my extreme displeasure: he may live now (says this woondring
people) without the pain of the world, as though by my portion of.xv. or.xx.
thousand frankes, I were able to govern the earth: where others, of deeper
insight into the cares of marriage, stand aloof and lament with me, that biting
(with the fish) at a golden bayte, I should unhappily swallowe up the hook
of continual torment and bondage: oh time, oh manners to much corrupted,
wherein money must usurp the name of marriage, and the conjunction of persons
must be called servitude and bondage: All which I still maintain to move
originally and wholye by covetousness, to the which our predecessors opened
the gate, when they admitted dowryes. And yet you marueyle and canuas your
wonder with infinite subtle reasons, if a lady, forestalling the ordinance
of your laws, encounter a second friend besides her husband, and he likewise
use the like revenge to his wife. For if (according to Lycurgus in his common
wealth of Sparta) every one bent his devotion to her in whom reposed his whole
religion, we should cut of all the pains and traueyles which we see at this
day reign amongst worldlings, which in common reason, would prove far more
convenient, than your commodity (sir) which you have alleged in the
administration of a family: you do nothing in preparing the way to maryages,
if you do not associate them under a mutual friendship: neither shall any
city or state be happy, until (with the example of our ancestors) we
establishe our marriages under one heart, as by which mean and not otherwise,
we shall banishe not only all the errors of such conjunctions, but also even
purge the whole common wealth, who tending to a perpetual moneaccorde and
general quiet, shall never enjoy her felicity, so long as (in place of true
friendship) she finds secret simulation between man and wife: which if it be
so, and that by this marriage copulation your pollecie and whole commonwealth be
brought to the bayte, (seeing that in the beginning the world being divided
but into the unity of two persons, it multiplied by little and little into
villages and walled towns:) sure if the foundation of such bounds be
corrupted, the whole buylding must necessarily fall to ruin: wherein to give
you my fancy in plain speech, I cannot otherwise think, then that from this
corruption of maryages (which succeed in no other meaning than for money,
seeing in all other respects there is no resemblaunce between the parties)
does come the cause of our ordinary iarres and disagreements between brothers
and sisters, who being c^mposed of diverse and different humors, contend as it
were in contrary qualityes and dispositions, which they borrow severally of
their father and mother. I profess, not to pretend by this, to have in my
hands the reformation of our manners, but this me thinks cannot be
inconvenient as well for present order sake, as to banishe from us in time this
corruption of dowryes, that a Lady being in that unhappy sort married, to
have a friend of reservation with assurance to keep to him an indissoluble
faith and loyalty, standing as a good and faithful example to others, not to
marry themselves to goods, but to men according to the consent of love and
destiny: here this forlorn Gentleman, ceased his further discourse, to the
great rejoicing of the assistaunts, amongst whom, as there was none that
pretended interest with him, so, for my part, albeit I know not whether he
argued at voluntary pleasure, or used a plain meaning, yet weighing, with the
majesty of the matter, the nature of his reasons, I could not so far
consent with his sayings, as not to reserve a liberty to contend with him.
And where he mainteyned so sharply, that love passed all ordinances of man,
his error was no less in it self, than his opinion far from the purpose of
the present question. For who is so ignorant or lead heavy in judgment
which discernes not (as it were by his eye) that marriage was not ordained by
man, but erected by the eternal divine pollecie, as the only mean for
conse^uation of mankind: so to accomodate a thing so high, to our human
fra^^tie, me thinks is neither order in discretion, nor consideration in
duty, which draws me (Madame) on your side, not only in regard of the
society which you have wisely alleged, but also for other deep respects, as
chiefly for that God commaundes that a woman do not make her self meet for
any other, then him to whom the ceremony of the Church ^ath bound her: yea,
albeit there were default of love between her husband and her, yet in
christian duty she is bound to enforce her nature, to the end to enjoy an
eternal peace. And yet (Madame) if this marriage happen to be one of those in
whom is such resolute imperfection and contrariety, as love cannot be brought
in, I cannot (in a necessary care for her worldly felicity) but excuse her,
and approve the advice of this Gentleman, to bequeath hirselfe to a constant
friend: wherein though you note me of corrupt counsel, yet I have nature to
answer the cause for me: and marriage it self (if it could speak) I know
would not accuse me, but rather incline on my side, as to see her nourcechilde
under a promise of wealth, defrauded by a husband of her true and pleasant
inheritance, which is love, which justly she may exclaim to be sold at too
vile a price against all reason. And if you will needs thrust upon me the
defense of this cause in mine own name without calling other warraunt, do you
not see in common wealths well ordered (seeing you call upon the aid of a
state well governed) that many things are suffered for necessity sake, which
other ways, being esteemed evil, should be also abolished: referring you to
consider more largely of the rest, seeing this text is ticklishe enough,
specially for the married sort, wherein God grant that as eschuing this goulph
and pit of strife, every one may choose such a wife as nature and not money
reserues for them: so if other ways their lotte prove evil, and they
miscarie, let them blame themselves as guilty to such destiny: With the
which Glaphyro, who had heard all their discourse with a modest ^^lence,
prepares himself to play his part: Here do I find (says he) to be veryfied
in us, the tale of the Poet Horace, of three men invited by him to a banquet,
they all being diverse in taste, strange in appetite, and hard to be pleased,
but most of all the third: because the first delited in sweet meats, the
second took pleasure in sour sauce, and to this were agreeable neither the
one nor the other, such was the delicatie of his complexion, whom in this I
may perhaps resemble, as seeking to find a mean between the two extremities
so thoroughly debated between you. For as far as I can gather of your
contention (as one matter draws on another) from love simply, (as you term
it) you are descended to marriage. In love (seigneur Monophylo) you maintain a
conjunction of one to one, without enforcing the duty by which we are bound
to our mystresses. And in love also, you ( seigneur Phylopolo) defend the
contrary: to your love seigneur Monophylo, you give scope to ouerrunne even
married women, notwithstanding, by right of marriage, they concern us nothing:
and laying all the fault upon dowryes as deuesting us of such friendship as in
those acts is requisite, you would have marriages proceed under the only
title of love: wherein for my part, in as much as concerns the first point, I
am not of opinion with you seigneur Monophylo, and give less faith to the
sayings of you seigneur Phylopolo, not for any desire I have to impugn either
of you, but being men's judgments diverse, every man has also a liberty to
think at pleasure: touching the second tending to affection in wedlock,
whereof for the dignity of the matter I intend to speak before I enter into
that servitude of love which you have set out: it seems seigneur Monophylo, y^
albeit you comprehend in part the mocions of the troubles in marriage, yet, you
build to much upon your ground of nature. For to abolishe altogether the
benifite of dowyres (as you pretend) were no less strange in respect of the
manner, than prejudicial as touching the matter, because that as we ought not
in deed to settle our chiefest stay in them, but marry altogether for the
conservation of our selves in our kind, yet we may use them as an ay^e, and
ornament for the time to come: our will in entering into this bond of mutual
conjunction, is to give being to o^r children that are to come. But in dowryes
as well our children as our selves, find both present being and future benifit
in this behalf we may consent with Madame C^aryclea, that to use regard of
loyalty to a married women by any other then by her husband, is not lawful to
any degree: for albeit those affections (as also they of love) seem to be
in^used into us by a heavenly influence which willingly would usurp a dominion
over us, yet ought they to be brideled by reason, who was given us in a
semblance and similitude of him to whom is due the sovereign Empire over all
the world: seeing that even as this universal circuit or compass, is no
other thing than a great body, wherein the rest seem to hold place of
passions, because that as the affections in us, so also the celestial passions
by their courses and reuolutions, do govern altogether the bridle of this huge
creature which we call the world: in respect of which proximitie the Romans,
gyuing as well to the stars, as to the passions, common names called them
indifferently, motions: And albeit these powers are esteemed to hold a party
government of this round wonder, yet we see all remaynes in the hand of him, to
whom (as an universal reason of this huge body) is due a general and supreeme
empire: even thus may we resemble a man, who being a little world, composed in
his quality as an image of the whole, notwithstanding he seemed sometimes
enclyned to certain mocions of nature proceedi^g (as some hold) of the stars
under which he is borne: yet nature has erected (as it were) a trone in his
brain, wherein reason bearing chief rule, he should in his little kingdom,
govern over this heavenly influence, which seemed to draw him from any
virtuous operation: in which respect, albeit your love pertycipat never so much
with nature (as you say) yet we must needs resolve and end our actions in
the law, who albeit for some singular cause that mooues you, condiscendes not
in your judgment with reason, yet the same reason teaches you to obey it:
because you are so comma^nded by those that have power to direct you: And
therefore seeing adulteries are forbidden, not only in these days, but also
in all ancient memory, we must not suffer to fall into our thoughts, to
bear love to her, whom the law has assigned to another: which
notwithstanding, because you give such a freedom to our natural inclinacions,
there restes only to find a guide to lead reason thither, as to meet the
defectes falling in marriages by occasion of these strange loves, on which you
have run so long a discourse, wherein you and I shall not yet agree, because
that to apply a remedy, you would have such conjunctions performed by that
reciprocal love, which you call instinct of nature, but the ancients in an
apter phrase, term it passion: And of the contrary, I think such vehement
affections ought not to fall in marriage, but only a simple friendship
proceeding of reason: For if being led in this extreme love which you figure
and set out here, you think to take from married women, those inintemperaunces
which you pretend to remedy, yt were also necessary, that our passions vary
not, and being carried in affection to one singular person, that we remain
always firm and constaunt: which as we find notwithstanding m^st ordenarely
to fail, so also, neither by pain nor pollycie, nor assistaunce of any time,
shall you be able to root out of the fancies of either the men or women, those
defaultes which you note, and much less shall you be able to let, that many of
free and disposed minds (I say not voluble and light) by continuance of time,
do not fasten their love on another, as well as they fixed it on you in the
beginning: By which mean and reason, I could have better allowed, if to
warrant marriages, and entertain them in this loyal friendship, you would
have fashioned their beginning, not by this love, which you speak of, as being
to light, but by good and grave advise, and counsel taken at large, the better
to know how to live and love, before they enter into that indissoluble
conversation: For even as a good man of war preparing himself to an
enterprise where he pretendes to make proof of his prowess and value, before
he buie horses, he runs them, traynes them, and makes many tryalles of them,
refusing the vnlykelye and making choice of such as he lykes, at what price so
ever he buyeth them: even so in this short race of life which we mean to
perform with our wives in comfort, solace, and pleasure, we must not so much
stand upon contemplation of a wavering love, which possiblye crept into us in
a dream or at unawares, as with deep advise and consideration, weigh the
manners and conditions of the Lady with whom we pretend that way,
consideringe withal her parentage, and manner of bringing up from her youth, by
which order of choice, we shall easily find mean to make her entertain the
thing which she ought to hold in most dear estimation, which is her honor,
the same being the glory of her husband, as in his honor is contained the
estymation of his wife: The man of war examynes his horse with great
consideration, albeit he may depart with him at his pleasure: But we are
negligent to cyfte and search our wives with precise judgment, with whom we
are tied to an eternal society and abode unto death: we read the marriages
in time past, dissolved upon very slender occasions, some renounced their
wives, because they went amongst company without their vailes or barefaced:
some for that they satte at gase without the knowledge of their husbands, and
some because they went to the common Bathes: Which kind of people, as they had
good means to relieve themselves of the pains in marriage, so they ought not
to stand in example with us, who drawing at this day in another course, as
restrained of that liberty both by Gods and man's law, are bound to another
consideration in the high interprise of marriage, which afterward is either
to reuert to our full felicity, or else resolve to our extreme torment and
mishappe: I have heard often an old persuasion of the people, that, who has a
pretense of marriage, ought to enter therein with his eyes closed: But for my
part, if I had either so many sightes as old Argus, or were able to bear no
fewer eyes than the sky has stars, I should hold them all insufficient to
direct me in my choice, as being a matter of most high judgment and deep in
sight: neither can I allow in this behalf, the consideration of the Romans,
who gave liberty to their daughters at twelve years, and leave to their
sons at fortene to marry: respecting more the abilytie of the body, than
capacity of the mind, as esteeming those ages most fit for copulation to
multiplye the world. At those years they suffered man and woman to alyenate
their body, and yet in all other contractes, they forbad alyenacion of lands
and benefit until twenty and five years: They said maryages should only
knitte by a free consent of the mind: and yet they tolerated contractes in a
slender knowledge and distinction of good and evil: yea, they almost suffered
marriage, when there was no judgment of pleasure: For a child (specially in
such age) is like a tender slip or plant, who plyes always with every
wind, lyking all encounters, as his first motions lead him, to whom many
things at the first are delyghtfull, which time translates to a froward
disdain and contempt: Better could I agree with the institucion of Plato, who
in his commonwealth did not admit man to marriage but in ripe years, which
with him were thirty five, and the woman, in respect of her forwardness,
exceedinge the man in readiness and rypenesse, at eyghtene, and nintene, which
rule if you account either to straight in the persons, or severe in example,
choose your time in the man when you think him in his most maturitye, as of
best knoweledge to consider his commodity: This is the cause why our lawyers
have wisely foreseen, that no marriage should pass without counsel of the
pa^entes, who inclyning to our profit more faythfullye then our selves, stand
as a relief to our wanton weakness, as not sufferyng us to practyse a Wife,
whom they esteem not for our honor and benefit: For albeit (as you persuade
seigneur Monophylo) maryages be made under a suggestion of love, which is no
other thing than an inward passion of torment, and that for the beginning they
flatter us with shadows of joy and pleasure: yet when our desire shall be
satisfied, and our disordered will cloyed, we retire forthwith into continual
penance (the only running plague and canker of the mind) which will prove
such a coresey to the best parts in us, that our expectation of pleasure being
banished as a fair form in a flattering looking glass, we shall live
plunged in a Laborinth of infelicityes, which (to our worthy confusion) of our
selves, we brought to our selves: In your fancy, you fashion a wife, of the
molde and metal of pleasure, with persuasion to find in her all the
felicityes of the world. But beware of the storm that succeedes the
flickering calm, and (with the wise Arthitecture) when you prepare a plot to
buyld upon, be sure to see in your mind the top of your pallayce, before you
pitch your foundation. For if your wife be wanton, if she be unchaste, if
disobedient, if sharp in words, and subtle in abuse, if easy to deceive,
and doubtful to trust, if rude in bringing up, and rough in behavior, if
froward at home, and foolish abroad, if vain in life, and void of will to be
ordered, if lastly she have no other conformity with your conditions, then to
her own liking, will not these griefs come in counterchaunge of your frail
pleasure, yea alas they are poisons of themselves, and galls whose bitterness
can never be taken away: if you once see her disposed to divide the pleasure
which you challenge peculiar to your self, shall you not then to late find your
self deceived in your vain thought: to whom for reward, is reserved a
gnawing repentance, as due to your light and rash choice: yea oftentimes a
sweet kiss received of a delicate Lady, breathes such a poison, as there is
no art to purge it. And in a little glaunce of her eye is harbored such power
(with the nature of the Basilike) to pearce you, that blasted with that
inchauntment, you seek to die before your time. And then, if the sooner to
enforce and effect your loathsome desire, you advance marriage with that
pleasant enchauntresse, think you not on your hasty execution, there attendes
a weary and lingering repentance? and that your choice of folly for that one
day, shall not be redeemed with a price of cares so long as you live after: It
is an experience in nature and reason, that all things take dissolution, from
whence they had their beginning: as our natural beings originally framed out
of earth, resolve eftsoons to the same substance: goods evil gotten,
succeed not well, and friendships kindled in such a light heat, do soon
dissolve to ^um^, as matters of no long continuance, where such as rest upon
the immovable pillor of virtue, are never subject to ruin, so long as the
body is subject to life: which in deed ought to be the state and example of
love in a good and loyal marriage, the rather to induce both the one and other
to a constant felicity. And as that love which you prescribe seigneur
Monophylo, by his heat and vehemency in the beginning, has no long aboade,
so that which I discover in marriage begun by the plot and means I have
laid, does hoyse more and more her sails, and even in the last day (when one
of us must yield tribute to nature) is of no less force, than the first night
wherein he offered his sacrifice to love under the guide of the master of
ceremonies Hymeneus: yea, and for a further disproofe of your opinion, I say,
that for a man to fall in marriage into the hands of her whom he had long
pursued in love, is the thing which above all other he ought most to fear: for
where before he professed the state of her servant and slave, with a prompt
readiness to run under her commandments, his condition being now changed
by reason of marriage, he alters also his authority, chalenging an empire and
souereigntie over her, whereunto she is hardly brought considering her
experience in her former pre-eminence. And so where before there was a sympathia
and concordaunce of friendship, both the one and other are now translated into
loathsome spirits, stryuing either of them to maintain and possess their
right. The man being now careless of his former pretense, for the which he had
in so many sorts disguised himself, seeks to be husband both namely and
actually: as also the wife on the otherside loathe to leave her late
sovereignty, strives still to keep him within the state of his former
servitude: which difference of maystership, where it concurres together, there
can be no concord, and where wantes conformity of wills, there can be no
perfect friendship: Besides, as we further consider herein, we shall find more
inconveniences rise, as where the wife (before her marriage) becommes obedient to
the will of the man, what a Bees nest does she breed in the head of her
husband, who when time has mortyfied his unbridled heat, will not stick to
bring in memory the pleasures he coolled of her without other merit than a
voluntary and light will, wherein jealousy playing her part, will not stick
to lead him in a suspicious mind, to make his wife as prodigal to all men,
as she has been liberal to him: as for example in general, it is proved in
common experience, that things which sometime seem good to us, by a better
advise and consideration become of slender regard, the same happening by our
blind passions which make us unable to discern the good from the evil: to a
foolishman over ruled with a burning desire, nothing seems impossible, but to
the wise man, all things are hard, till by long and grave advise he has made
them easy: Even so love has victory over all things, and making his subjects
able to high enterprises, he qualifies all impossibilities to advance their
pretense, but his great heat being resolved to a temperate cold, they stand
to complain their former folly, and can not cure their present evil. And
notwithstanding their sundry importunities, which (with the Camelion) they can
disguise in all sorts saving true meaning, yet they are no sooner put in
possession of their desire, than as well the thing it self, as their affection
to it, conuerts into an other quality, as beginning then to know the small
value of the cause of his late torment, and of less merit in his own
regard, albeit of special respect touching her, for that on it is grounded
the duty of her honor: wherein also as these things lie hid from him, till by
a charm of prayers and other subtiltyes apt to entice the simplicity of
women, he has brought her within his power, as the Hawke stowpes to the Lewer
at the voice of her keeper: So, when marriage reueales an understanding of them,
it is then he gives judgment against her tractable obedience, as so soon to
bequeath hirselfe to his mercy, without other bond or merit, than a simple
persuasion on his s^de, with this mind that by the same mean she may as
easily prostitute hirselfe to others, as she was willing to incline to him:
which will prove such an indifferent torment to them both, that the felicity
which they expected in marriage, will turn to a curse of that holy
institution. In which respect, it can not but be better to establishe your
marriage under a wise information of the manners and conditions of your wife
(which is a contentment continual and incorrupt) then under a short and
passible pleasure, whose end concludes with far greater grief and
bitterness, than the beginning brought joy or delight. And grounding your
marriage in this sort, it will bring forth such a virtue in the man, as using
chastely his desti^^e, he shall also become estraunged from all other dishonest
prouocations: as also touching the woman it is likely her parents will not
choose for her a man of gold and wealth only, according to the warning of
Themistocles, who had rather marie his daughter to a man needing money and able
to govern wealth, than to gold which had need of a man to use it: For to
speak a truth, without comparison more commendable is the poor man getting
little, than the rich man spending prodigally: So then, let not the father be
slenderly advised to provide place for his daughter, and much less apply to
her discretion, if virtue lay not the ground of her choice: the wanton lo^^ed
assyet in the cradle of imb^cilitie, enable to discern directly, if she have
once tasted the sweet speech of some dallying Courtyer, yeeldes by and by
simple faith to his subtle meaning, and caryes away the picture of his
behavior imprinted in the dearest part of her heart. But alas, what fruit take
we of the example of Medea, who left father and mother with all her own
estates to follow a disloyal Jason: and likewise Oenone miserably abused and
forsaken of Paris. A man enclyned to deceyte, will not stick, by enforced
importunityes to protest such lamentable service and affection to a Lady, as
if marriage succeed not between them, he wissheth death to dissolve his
painful and languishing estate: and she pitying such ghastly resemblances,
makes a present bequest of her heart with consent to the marriage, to the end
to communicate with the honest pleasures therein, but (in mine opinion) with
the most yrkesome encombers that the wit of man can devise: was there ever
man, to whom at the first (notwithstanding he had a more lust to the wealth,
than lyking to the woman) nature has not given a facility to flatter with no
less show of friendly behavior, then if he meant perfect friendship in deed:
for nature has given to men a face to serve as a visor the better to disguise
their thoughts: albeit it is good pollecie to use an Antidot to pourge a
poison. But if even wise men can sooner foresee, than easily eschew the malice
of their evil disposed enemies.

By greater reason, how can a young maid discern him that loves her, amid so
many dissimulations in the world. But admit, he that pretendes her in marriage,
love her unfeignedly, is it meet for all that that love fall into the mind of
so weak and tender a creature: Nature created woman with her eyes downewarde,
and to man she has given a liberty of upright looking, aduising us by that,
that a woman should not be bold to raise the liddes of her eyes, but hold
them always in a modest behavior inclyned to the earth, to the end she
should not have the faculty to judge of the countenance of men. And if she be
capable to know what love is, by the same capacity also many other malices may
enter into her, wherewith it needs not that she perticipate: For, if I might
fashion a Maid entering into marriage, I would frame her either simple not to
know good from evil, or at least so tractable, as to incline altogether to the
fancies of her husband, and not to learn or study any thing which should not
tend to the common quiet of them both: and being such one in her self, and
rightlye matched by her parents: oh happy, and twice happy marriage: oh life
agreeable to God, and plawsible to the world: oh blessed couple of lovers,
enjoying a temporal felycitie which will lead you to ye everlasting paradise:
this husband shall instruct his wife without grudge, and she apply to his will
without compulsion: he shall command and find no resistaunce, and she obey
him with all reverence, if she entreat, he aloweth her reasons, and will not
deny her request, if any thing offend him, she either submyts, or uses
modesty to persuade: and so living both in one nature, and conformytie of
manners, as this husband will not search the life of his wife inciuillye, so
her simple innocence stands always to defend her from those inconveniences
in marriage, which all men fear, and most men find, using rather an unstained
loyalty with an honest love unfeigned in them both, then such a disordered will
as you have discribed: For if in any other respect, a man enter this holy
estate, let him not grieve, if by succession of time, his wife choose. A secret
friend against whom I will not erect such hard ^awes of restraint toward
his mystris, as you ( seigneur Monophylo desire,) wherewith I fall eftsoons
upon the matter of loyalty by you preferred: albeit before I enter into the
field of that argument, because I will not couple so profane a thing as love,
with the holy profession of marriage, it may please you (Madam) to use patience
to hear, and modesty in concealing your judgment. But hear Monophylo not
content with the matter, and less lyking the manner of the man, as one with
whom love stood in more dear value, then all the other felicities in the
world: you have seigneur Glaphyro (says he) I know not by what occasion
entangled our discourse with speech no less impertynent to the matter, then
somewhat estranged from the general purpose of the company, because in my
advise to him that would marrye, I did not pretend in my plot of
singularity, to bring in question that point, unless by the way, and (as it
were) at unawares, neither under hope to stand long upon it, nor to help my
opinion the rather: albeit, seeing you seem to settle in it, your challenge
shall not offend me: and if you had well waighed the nature of my reasons, I
think you would have given them a higher merit, then those which by your
self are revealed, the same containing no less distinction in themselves,
then there is common difference between life and death, seeing your marriage is
grounded upon a voluntary or rather artyficiall consideration, and mine
marches under an inclynation of nature, which we cannot restrain: wherein by
how much less facilytie the bonds of nature are to be unknit, then those
which we see Art does couple and conioyne, even by so much more authority, do
I assure and ground my marriage above yours. And I pray you seigneur Glaphyro,
(to avoid weary speech) how many diuorses, iarres, and household strifes, do
you see happen daily between the honest and chaste wife, and her husband:
yea, I know at this day, a wise and discreet Lady (if there be any) equally
sprinkled with the favors of nature, and lyberally endued with the virtues and
qualyties of the mind, whose race of youth has run under an honest and
obedient name with her husband, and possessed between them a number of fair
children, yet such is his inequality and difference of manners with her, that
notwithstanding the continuance of their love many years, with end honest and
chaste endeavor requisite in the office and part of a wife, he cannot be induced
to honor her with the affection of a husband: wherein, being cyfted in the
cause of this disagreement, when he can not prove prostitution or other such
cryminall error in marriage, he alleges only that as he never loved her with
his heart, so, yet if another man had the lawful interest of marriage in her,
he could then draw his affection thither, is not this man so much the more
worthy of rebuke, as either his words be hateful, or his example hurtful to
a common wealth, but above all his offense is the greater, for that virtue
(with the nature of the Adamant) draws to her even people unknown: But for my
woman, being such one as I have figured, I will love her chastity and virtue,
and not her proper person, only because my mind cannot apply thereunto. I
will honor and esteem in my wife that wisdom which God has breathed into
her, and not such as of it self will offend me: oftentimes, happening into
argument of* marriage, amongst sundry men and women; I hear not seldom as
well the one as the other sort to marueyle of the pleasant and sweet agreement
of some married men with their wives: for (say they) if such a man, or such a
woman, had chanced to my lotte, we should have agreed even as fire and water.
So that what other cause knittes this equality and concord between them two,
who, being divided could hardly agree with others: but a love, a conformity,
yea a kindly nature between them, which could not hold concord with others.
For if you require a precise perfection of manners in your wife, wherewith
perhaps your self is not furnished, never look to agree with her in
conversation and behavior other then as the Lion with the Lamb, whereof the
one is of humble and meek condition, and the other endued with a proud and
hawtie nature. And albeit your wife discreetely assay to reform your
inciuilities* and by reverent obedience seek to lead you in an honest
affection, yea though with the veil of her modesty she cover your
imperfections, thinking at last to allure you with th^se honest traynes, yet
such marriage will prove imperfect and all her honest traueile yeeldes but a
desperate fruit, because you stand estraunged from her in heart: our nature
never changes in us, and (with the opinion of the Philosophers) who seeks to
translate his nature, labors with the Giants in time past) to make war
against the Gods: well may we for a time dissemble ye suggestion of our
thoughts, as by an artificial hypocrasie pretending an other estate than we
bear: but at length as (with Esops Apes that brake the dance to scamble for
Nuts) this nature of ours must reuart and take her place: So when love once
imprintes in her, much less that the man and wife shall jar or disagree
between themselves, but of the contrary they shall bring forth in their lives
and acti^ns* one con^^nt of will, yea there shall be that richesse and
community of manners which you wish* and the wife of such chaste and reverent
behavior to her husband, as their conversation shall be no less free from
reproach, than their whole life far from example of disobedience. In which
estate, were it not better to live in such sort and pleasure, (albeit the one
be deceived in his opinion) then dwelling in the condition you have prescribed,
to be always plunged in pain and passion* This love does so dazell and lead
our spirits in a judgment of affection and favor, that we value all things
in the best, and esteem nothing inconvenient on the behalf of them whom we
love: where this wisdom which you wish: stands upon such delicate and
precise respects, as she holds nothing acceptable, yea though in your wife
were even the very virtues of Judith, or the rare constancy of Penelope:
wherewith the Lady noting their vehemency, me thinks (says she) you lead
the company wrongfully in a cause of doubt, albeit the nature of the matter
requires it. But to leave you mutually contented, my judgment is that you
dwell still in your singular opinions, seeing in either of them is a clear
resemblance of a truth, like as in common experience and practice of things,
that which is proper in one place, we find oftentimes most inconvenient in an
other behalf, and that by the variety of manners and order of such as handle
them. And therefore seeing there is a diversity of fancy between you, let every
one feed on his private opinion without seeking to disenherite his companion.
But for your part ( seigneur Monophylo) if you should be driven to abandon and
exchange your lot (I mean your Lady and Mystresse) to marye the rychest
woman in the world, I think it would digest with you as an unsavory ^yll
in a sound stomach: And even no less to you monsieur Glaphyro, if you were
to choose a wife only for wealth, or altogether for love, so that (as I said)
my sentence runs still to restrain you of speech, and leave you only a
liberty and contentment in thought recommending unto you ( seigneur Glaphyro)
a new memory of your old promise to proceed in the matter of love, whereof
you have given us as it were a pleasant taste, and seems now to faint in the
challenge, when you have kindled our desires leading our appetites in
imagination, as though you would warm us by a painted fire: only I pray you be
not weary in well doing nor hard to incline to honest requests, seeing there
is no less virtue in the one, then the other conducible to merit of them by
whom you are required: your request (Madame) says he, is no less just in it
self, then meritorious on your own behalf, and your reasons so necessary,
as if I should deny them, I should be holden either ignorant or obstinate,
and so leave you unsatisfied in my duty, and fulfill in my self an example of
imperfection touching the parts requisite in a Gentleman. And yet Madame, your
request seemed a fleeing authority, seeing it prevented me in matter, but not
in meaning: yea, if I had not a grounded knowledge of you, I should judge you
with those delicate creditors, who, if their day be not kept, do salute us
suddenly with their Sergeants or officers of areast, notwithstanding you shall
be satisfied as apperteyneth, upon this charge and covenant that you receive
my money in payment as it is, seeing I will give you no other then such as I
cull out of mine own coffers. And so as far as I remember the degrees of our
beginning, seigneur Monophylo, allows love mutually of one to one, and of the
contrary Phylopolo would love in many places: wherein Madam, if I give my
fancy either simply, or as I have partly learned of you, I crave only to be
defended in my right as well as they two. To make such base merchandise of his
body, as to bequeath it to the first (according to the desire of seigneur
Phylopolo) me thinks is neither good nor seemly, and even so I can less
condescend to hold so hard a hand of the bridle, with ymagination of such an
Idol of constancy, as you ( seigneur Monophylo) require: only I could better
allow a mean, as the Lawyers use in causes of contention: I will not deny
that the principal point in love, and the mark whereat every one ought to
shoot, is not loyalty toward our mystresse, yet considering this great
frayltie which nature has grafted in us, as to be all in all and pertaker more
with mortality, than divine respects, seeing our minds be wrapped in the
veil of this fleshly dross, if pursuing our necessary occasions and
opportunities, we chance into a long absence from our Mystresse, and applying
the favor of the time to our desires, happen to row in another stream, I
cannot make that light escape a deep offense, nor such exchange of pleasure
only alienation of mind, and therefore no other fault then either may be
pardoned or excused: seeing that dwelling still in one constant mind and will
toward her, albeit I supply a certain suggestion and actual appetite which
nature styrres in me, yet with that disordered will, I do not translate my
heart to other then to the Lady and Mystresse of my first thoughts, to whom
I bear a constant reverence as well absent as present, wherein as the Sun
keeps always his clearenesse, although sometimes he enter into a cloud, even
so may it be of him who sometimes visites a strange Mystresse, to whom he
yeeldes no other affection then to serve his present turn. To be short, seeing
friendship restes in the heart, and not in these small intemperances of
nature, me thinks love cannot be violated by a necessity forced of an
instinct which mooues and kindles by nature. And yet will I not establish any
liberty (under the shadow of such necessity) to s^acke the bridle of our
pleasures at all times, and upon every motion: for so might we run into a
negligent and careless regard of our mystresse, albeit there be many faults
which may be pardoned for once, but coming to an use and custom, deserve no
small rebuke: wherewith Monophylo, to cut of the question of marriage: Let us
leave them (says he) to such as pretend interest in that holy state, and
return eft soones to the matter of love where we pitched our beginning, wherein
( s^igneur Glaphyro) you are nothing so prodigal of your self, as Phylopolo,
and yet perhaps your opinion might find place amongst the common people, as
holding some simple affinity with them, shadowed with an honest and seemly
cover. But being here to dispute not according to popular fancy, but exactly
upon things, I will frankly tell you my judgment, if friendly you apply
liberty to my simple meaning: not only skope of free speech (says
Charyclea) but all the authority I have to warraunt and assure your cause,
wherein (if need be) I will become pawn and pledge for you: often have I read
(says Glaphyro) that women are sprinkled with many imperfections, as unable
to give advice in causes of estate, and much less to be received into
judgment in matters of this advice: those be the laws of men, says the Lady,
to whose ignorance is given a certain supreeme authority, least in
indifferent reason, they were found either less able, or more imperfect than
we, and all to establish an usurped preregatiue over our virtuous obedience,
wherewith ^ffering to proceed further in the honest defense of their simple
sex: Monophylo, either under the warrant of her consent, or at least presuming
of her condition, intercepted her speech, and pursued his purpose of loyalty
in this sort: if the highest virtue in love be actual constancy, the second
felicity (in mine opinion) says he, is to have the thought clear from all
corrupt motions, as neither to aspire by ymagination, nor attempt by policy,
how so ever the season or opportunity do favor: for who makes profession of
true love ought so to bridle his sturring lusts to all other women, that much
(...) he perform any desire, which you say to be natural, but also tha^ the
will or disposition of so doing do not once fall into his mind: seeing, who
so passes that honest ^onde* and respect, and professes a peculier
consecration to one, is guiltie^ with Gods enimies^ in profane prostitution:
yea I cannot allow Scipio, who in the sack or riste of a town refused to
behold certain maids singulerly fair, least against reason and honor, he
should perform some disordered will of them, by which effect he proved that
his heart was not elsewhere possessed: as also that mighty Alexander, who,
after the overthrow of (...), notwithstanding the (...) and chance of (...),
had brought under his commandment the wife, daughters and damsels of that
great Monarke, yet he spared to lay dishonest hands upon them, as whose honors
were in dear regard to him: not for all this, that I will assure his mind to
be entangled elsewhere, but I lay him as an example, that if he were exempt
from all passion of love, what then is his duty, whose thoughts are and ought
to be aduowed to one only. All of the contrary (says Phylopolo) for such as
do love, being more (...) with such desire, thou others, and not able (...) to
possess the pleasa^^^ pray of then best beloved Mistresses, are enforced to
change of place and (...) to (...) pass over that hea^e which they had (...)
Seeing (says Monophylo) I am not of my self able to satisfy you so well as
both the case requyre^^, and (...) for your incredulity, I pray you (...) and
perfect example of (...) familiar companion of mine own, not altogether
unknown unto you, who, after long and much labor to (...) the good (...)
Lady, and ^he for her (...) with many vanquettes of court, as dissembled
(...), and incertaine hope (...) happened that falling one day into a special
opportunity of time and place, he added new flame to his old fire, and
required to visit the (...), which saving to married folks, nature would not
have known but by ymagination: which notwithstanding (...) unto him, albeit
with a gracious nay, accompanied with a certain hope hereafter, I pray you
judge the estate of this poor Gentleman, who, to quiet his unruly will, went
elsewhere to be satisfied, and being upon the place both free from danger, and
far from all impediments, he became so mortified, that as well the passion as
the cause qualified of themselves: I pray you, what power of love did he show
in this experience: yea such a force and souereigntie, that albeit we be
violently strayned in will and desire, yet does he not suffer us to pass the
limittes of reason. And albeit this Gentleman, is not in some respect, without
his merit of praise, yet will I not phyle him upon the bedroll of true lovers,
seeing he suffered his mind to be spotted with such a corrupt motion: what if
(as we read in Authors worthy of faith) two or three have lain by the space
of six months, even in the arms of them in whom rested their whole
affection, and yet, as not to disobey the chaste wills of their ladies, suffered
themselves to be governed without touch or inclination of dishonor, shall not
or cannot a true lover (by the only memory of the pleasure he encountreth in
dreaming or thinking of his Lady, in whom he lives in true felicity)
abstain copulation with an other although occasion and opportunity consent:
what numbers could I reckon (if numbers were necessary to establish your
fancies, as well as they can prove my opinion) to whom their allegiance to
their Ladies were so dear and careful, that they have even cried out of
nature, when she has suggested dishonestly in them: wherein, (for some
respects) I will spare to wade further at this time, although I could make
example of some of your acquaintance and my through knowledge, with whom God
does witness, that albeit they have governed without danger the bodies of
Ladies of no small affection, and, by the season and place, might prevail over
them, yet would never gather the fruit of the garden which lay open to them,
and that only in a reverent remembrance of their Myst^^sses, in whom they
found more felicity by ymagination, then in all the actual pleasure in the
world: which last words he could not bring forth without some tears,
(albeit he wisely dissembled his passion) the same assuring the company that
in himself was meant the example and party of that pity. But Phylopolo,
according to the malice he always bare to such loves, dissembling withal not
to have understand his words, urged an incredulity to his tale, as holding
all his discourse for fables, not of our time (says he somewhat smyling) but
rather of that first age called the golden season, when men (if we may believe
Hesiodus) continued in infancy the space of an hundredth years: wherein as
such men as you describe unto us, might retain life two hundredth years, and
living in such manner, might dwell in estimation both of beasts and children,
who for want of knowledge in any thing, and inhabilitie of their age, stood
need to be fed: even so also we may well love such men in comparison with
Tantalus, who in the midst of water, and oppressed with a vehement desire to
drink, suffered himself to die of thyrst: which fables albeit they allure
faith with some, yet they can persuade no credit at all to me. Neither do I
mean to traueile with you to such purpose (says Monophylo) yet if by your
self and not by me, you were well and duly instructed in the obedience and
servitude which in love we bear to our mistresses, for fear to offend them,
it may be, though you were not fully of my opinion, yet you would not
altogether withstand it: by which want or default, there is nothing that we can
prefer, which (as well to you as to all others without experience and proof)
will not seem monstrous and impossible to be done. But now for you seigneur
Glaphyro (whom I think to have somewhat satisfied touching the necessity
which you say in us by nature) tell me I pray you, what slanders, how many
iarres, what sorts of yrksome inconveniences in love may spring, if, as you
hold, under pretense of (I know not what) disordered appetite shadowed with
your long absence, you seek to defrawde your mistress of that which is only
due to her, and you duly bound to rescrue for her: would you not the unity of
our hearts to take other ground then of a simple and only presence, as though
absence could hold no love, and men unseen become negligent in affection, ah
how far is that from the office of a loyal mind, how lamentable to be
heard of, how dangerous in use, yea an heresy most intolerable in a
comunion or society of faithful friends: for my part, by these hands and
tears which are witnesses of my zeal I protest and prove the contrary, that
absence is such a torment in our minds, that the more we stand bereaved of
the pleasant philosophy, flowing from the sweet breath and speech of our
Ladies, the more do we honor their virtues in contemplation, and the seldomer
we govern the actual motions of their quick and sparckling eyes, the more
do we travail in desire to behold them, so that it cannot be that we decline
in good will, seeing (with the nature of fire long kept down with straw)
absence reuiueth our affection, enforces our desire, and redoubleth our hope,
which truly used, is never without his true merit: Herein I have the help of
Philosophy, in which this is one principle, that more do we desire those
things which we least command, then such over whom we have a free
government, the same perhaps being the cause why many esteem the Italians
most constaunt in their love (and yet in my judgment not without their errors
that way) because that possessing only the favor and use of the eye, without
other benefit of speech or secret familiarity, they always continue in love,
and increase in desire: which is also the very nature and operation of absence:
not for all this, that I maintain presence to procure any default or
diminishing of love, seeing the only presence of your Ladies, sty^res up such
a present contentment, that all torment, all dolor, yea every sighe and
sorrowful vision passed, is nothing in respect of the pleasure which her only
society brings, and the same (as an indifferent virtue) dividing it self into
a mutual felicity to you both, fashions such a fifth heaven in you, that you
leave her not without a vehement desire eftsoons to see her, as a stomach
whose appetite increases by a restraint of meat: This is it which Amadys de
Gawle has figured unto us in his.viij. Book, when Nyquea presenting before
her eyes in a looking glass her Amadys de Greece, was so rapt into present
conceytes of joy, that the only vision in the Glass defaced all other
pleasures with her, but the form being taken away, the effect also did
vanishe as a shadow on a wall which is governed by the reflection of the
Sun, and all her former joys turned into a mountain of smoke by the only
loss of that dissembled cause: The like also happening to Anastarax, when he
could enjoy no more the presence of his Nyquea: Did Penelope I pray you, for
all the importunities of so many Princes, corrupt the duty of her wiuehoode
to her husband for his long absence of.xx. years: and she was not induced to
this constancy by any fear of her husband, because in such a distaunce of
place and time, she might conceal her fault: no, the extremity of honest and
careful love to her husband kept her in that virtuous course in his absence:
And even as good old Seneca is wont to say, although he knew is offense
would be concealed not only from the world, but even from God himself, yet
(says he) would I not sin, for the only hate I bear to sin: even so, the
true lover (notwithstanding your voluble fancy) although he know his offense
shall not come to the knowledge of his Lady (a thing of very hard assurance)
yet ought he to eschew the inconvenience you spoke of, in a reverent regard to
the perfect love he bears to his Mystresse. So that as their presence procures
to us a pleasure and most perfect contentment, so absence leads us in an
insatiable desire toward them: the same being a sufficient mean to call us
back from all other temptations: yea this only desire and constant
remembrance of them (being continual and extreme) will mortyfie in us all
mind and memory of every other thing. Like as also such ^orment proceeding
of such absence will exceed (without comparison all the delites we can ymagin
even in all the other women in the world, so that if my judgment might
challenge authority) I hold that such love in it self is so passioned, that
by it we forget all other passions and fancies, and are made as half Gods in
such sort, that in respect of our great fragilitie, we are not able to draw
our selves from these intemperaunces whereof you speak (although God
commaundes us) yet, being clothed with this kind of love, (notwithstanding all
the pleasures of the world m^ster, and present before our eyes, we shall not
swerve or decline one jot. And now touching the latter part of your
discourse, that love consistes not but in the heart, and not in these
inclinations of nature, wherewith necessarily we are touched, your opinion is
not altogether without the society of reason, wherein (as I think) you might
allege that Apothegma sometimes attributed to Aelyus Verus Emperor of Rome,
who, to cover his wanton and licentious factes, said it was not lawful by the
honesty of marriage, to execute his passions upon his own wife, and therefore
(to preserve the honor of wedlock) he allowed himself a conversation with
other public women: even so might you allude as not to contamynate this
precious cloak of true love, a law or liberty to do as much on the behalf
of them on whom you had not fixed your heart: Albeit you make a further
restraint of your self, as not desiring the execution in such things, but
only when by a natural violence, you are forced to do it. But I pray you
tell me seigneur Glaphyro, if you had married a wife not for any settled
affection toward her, but only in a greedy regard to the greatness of her
wealth (as we have said before that maryages took their beginning) and she
glosing with you in affection, and profess a presentiall obedience to you, and
secretly prostitutes her self to another, would not her dealing be of hard
disgestion with you: yea albeit, you may answer that it belonges to every
wife dutifully to conform hirselfe altogether to the pleasure of her husband,
and not to seek to delight the residue of the world, yet, would not her abuse
seem intolerable with you: wherein then if you took your wife under pretense
of gain, without any consideration of love, what would you say if she, whom
the heavens seem to have reserved for you, imparted her body with another: Oh
lamentable destiny, oh grief without comparison, oh dealing might you say,
whose bare remembrance bringes with it a horrible ymagination of death: for my
part, albeit I make no careful inquiry in such things, yet, in nature and
reason, I hold it the greatest wound that can happen to the heart of man: so
that you must not think seigneur Glaphyro, that reciprocation is not found in
your Lady, who feels no small smart of mind as often as you relieve
strangers with the alms which she accomptes proper to her self: where as be
it that she be ignorant, yet ought you not to pretend worse to her, then you
would she should perform against you, because it is peremptory in Gods
judgment to reward finne with his merit, and return to every one the same
measure wherewith they have served others. And this is one point (says
Phylopolo) which might give place to the question, wherein perhaps I will one
day offer you the challenge, as finding it strange that you will make march
under one Method the man and the wife: albeit, for the present I will reserve
it to another season, only to discharge my self now against seigneur
Glaphyro, who for the better authority of his opinion, seeks to make us
understand, that love has none other residence then in the heart, and nothing
at all in these natural intemperaunces which he says are nourished in our
minds: sure seigneur Glaphyro, me thinks you sake to lead us in a strange
construction touching the force and virtue of love, seeing, there was never
lover, who loved not to this end which you so far estraung and banish from the
park of love: what other cause is there of our a^^ction* or what else does
induce us to love our Ladies, if not this last felicity which we pretend to
find in them, wherein besides common experience, which of it self ought to
suffice to judge between us, how many examples have we read in antiquity,
amongst whom we find no one lover, who at length has not required of his
mystresse that point which we call the fruit of love, the same (in mine
opinion) being the motion and only purpose of this extreme love: nay rather
it is even love it self, which is none other thing then a desire to use and
possess. Great surely and gracious is the effect of the eye, hand and hears,
but not of such force, as that in them we may find a full relief to the
torments we endure: but rather with Mars when he possessed frankely his Venus,
let us directly seek out the mark whereunto love leads us. And albeit from
the eyes and looks do flow no small contentment, yet they are but dymme
stars in respect of the other light, wherein I hold him altogether
insensua^e, who under any other consideration pretendes to profess love to
Ladies. This speech is not indecently used seigneur Phylopolo, says Monophylo,
neither improperly applied to the present matter: only I thank you, that in
favoring partly my opinion, you offer me simply your aid, without the which
notwithstanding I think Glaphyro understanding my reasons would have
condiscended to my saying as being of it self sufficiently defensible. And
albeit I have now to rest in quiet with him for the matter of loyalty, yet me
thinks, (notwithstanding I acknowledge somewhat unthankfully the benefit you
have presented to me) you and I shall not so easily accord, because (in my
judgment) as you seem sinisterly to comprehend all the nature of love, so I
will not resist that the lover ought not to thurst for the thing which you
hold in such estimation. But that to love only for that respect, is either
true love, or friendship of continuance, I maintain against you and all
chalengers, hoping you will take it as from him whose nature cannot be
disguised from the office of a true lover: we see by experience many men who,
pretending only that mark and end in love, after they have brought their
pretense to a matter of effect (as men whose natures change in a moment, they
become no less cold in desire, than ears^e they labored in vehement means
to advance the execution of their fleeting will: yea, they are evil
acquainted with the nature of love, who dispose him only under a contentment
to frail, he being in himself so divine and wonderful, and the pray after
which they hunt, so passable, and of no abode: indeed this I will confess
that nature, to multiply this huge and round body which you see, does kindle
in us by a secret wisdom certain motions or stinges, which with good right,
some have called brutall as being common to us with other creatures, and not
only with them, but even with trees and things not sensible, which seem to
bloome and become fruitful for the increase of their (...): which natural
vehemency, if it had not been necessary also in us, this huge plot and
workmanship of the earth had soon taken end: This is the cause, why,
intercepting our wills* and guiding our affections by these disordered
appetytes which necessity puttes in us, we bear to the community of women,
certain sparks of str^nger good will, than to men, and they likewise to us:
the same happening in ordinary example, seeing there was never personage of
such deformity (if I may charge him upon his faith and conscience) who
naturally receyues not (specially in a conformetie of things) more contentment
in the company of women, then in the fellowship of men: For our nature does
even rejoice in them, as seeing hirselfe (by an honest and lawful conjunction
of one to another) immortalised: So that by this mean is found an affection
very vehement which generally we bear to all women. But not this particular
friendship of one to one whereof you speak, which in my judgment consistes as
a more vyolent cause then that which you allege: wherein I will lay my self
upon the relation of certain noble minded men, who albeit do honor their
Ladies with a settled affection, pretending with all pollecie to conquer the
extreme mark and felicity in love, yet I have noted them to rest best
satisfied with the only use of the sight, presence, and speech of their
Ladies, and that because they feared, that being possessed of that invisible
paradise, their love would convert into some change, then much less that they
esteemed it to be the only cause of their affection: yea it is a common
persuasion among the populer sort, that having woonne that point upon a
gentlewoman, love (which the son when he is at the highest) begins to
decline, and then better is it to hunt the chase, then obtain the pray: so
that (according to the purpose of their reasons) the self same subject, which
(as they judge) is the very spring and original of love, is also the whole and
only reuersor of the same: seeing their building being pitched upon a frail
foundation, the work and matter desolues in it self, the same happening
oftentimes to such foolish lovers, who rest no less deceived in their
enterprise, than their thought was vain: But now seigneur Glaphyro, let me
ask you this rouing question, if two lovers, not setting their mind upon this
contentment which you mean, and yet one of them betray his affection, as to
become prodigal of his body elsewhere, do you think this abuse is not a
tyring grief to his mystresse, if by chance she come to the knowledge of it:
This I say, because that you, establishing your love in the heart, esteems
these natural intemperaunces as you call them not to touch or hurt in any
sort such as do love: wherein (for my part) such is my opinion (and in it is
some conformity with yours) that love keeps his true and only abode in the
heart, not styrring by such intemperaunces, but by a certain greater cause, as
ymmediately I mean to prove, and yet neither one of our said two lovers can
impart with a stranger without our extreme displeasure: because that as the
life of two lovers dependes mutually one upon an other: the man living
altogether in the woman, and she likewise reposing only in him, so they could
not but communicate both in equal grief, if others besides themselves would
press to give pleasure, not only such as nature kindles in us, but generally,
to their Ladies, as their Lords: And yet they spare it in themselves, as in a
reciprocal regard delyting far rather to feed themselves with a sweet and
sugared desire which by this appetite they have, then with a cloyed fullness
gathering the pleasant fruit one of another: yea we are so deeply vowed in
them, and they assured in us, that if it happen in a dream, their ymaginations
have deceived them, as thinking to have communicated with us (such is our
pleasure to think that felicity moved in them by our occasion and means)
we tryumphe in no less inward joy and gladness of mind, then if we had
been present to perform and execute our wills: For (to use a judgment in
simple truth) the pleasure does not so much move us in our selves, as the
desire we have to be the cause of that wherewith our Mistresses may
participate, seeing as we are borne for them and not for our selves, so we live
in them and not in our selves, and die in them, to be eftsoons revived in
them: like as also the benefit which we promise our selves to receive of them,
although in it self, it conteyne singular greatness and merit, yet is it not
so highly perfect, as that which we hope to procure to them: and so doubt not
at all (sir) that there is any one in love who is not extreemely grieved, when
his pretended friend or second himself, finds contentment with any other
whatsoever: not that their love (as I said and still maintain) be grounded
upon such substance: In deed we desire and thurst after that point, because
nature upon great cause and consideration has taught us so to do: But as we
desire it by nature, so love by a more violent reason teaches us a modest
government, what is more to be said: Although there were no hope to enter
that common haven, and that my mystresse had made me altogether desperate in
accustomed expectation, yet I stand in the same duty and regard of settled
love that was rooted in me before, albeit under this singular persuasion and
assurance in my self, that there was no default of friendship, but rather
some greater reason tending to entertain our love which induced her to deny
me: wherein also if other occasion should lead her, as to be more affected to
an other than to me, or holding me less dear, than either I have hoped or she
professed, yet my love should not diminish otherwise then by a Metamorphesis
or tragi^all conjunction into pyning grief, which (as the Aegle upon
Promotheus) should pluck and pynch my heart by peecemeale, till, with my love,
my life were also resolved to air, because I only des^red to be in place, to
give her the contentment she wished, more in contemplation and regard of her,
than of my self, who if my love did not aspire but to that point, I would
never rest till I had advanced the issue and conquered that happy effect: and
yet in thrusting for it, I desire it not, as in desiring it, I do not long for
it, but as a voluble affection, I make it far inferior to other regardes I
repose in her: You may ask me here what is this true love, whose pleasant
torment so throws the world into passions: whereunto the Philosophers shall
answer for me, who in a deep insight, thinking to attain to the
understanding of nature, ymagined love to be a most excellent form or plot,
exceeding generally the consideration of man, and therefore did figure unto us
an Androgina, by whom they meant a man composed of the Masculine and Femenine
sex, and he standing in his state of perfection, swelled in such mortal pride
against the Gods, that by that means he was afterward divided into two.

But it is most manifest, that this unity of the two halfes, is not meant by a
conjunction of the bodies, but by the communion of the minds: because this
superficial form of body which we see in our selves, is not the man of whom
we speak, but an organe of the man which we cover in our selves, like as we
note even from the beginning of the world, that God has formed us to his own
likeness, as always invisible and de^ided from all corporal mass, until
the time wherein he is to accomplish his promises: If Plato were the first
that preferred this opinion of Androgina, as I am not resolute that he meant the
only conjunction of minds, so I dare fully assure my self that he figured
such a miracle, to represent unto us some heavenly matter in love: wherein it
may be disputed of it in such sort, as one, by whose search and traueyle in
Egypt, he had commoned with the priests of the law in the history of Moses
touching his Genesis: But what need we acknowledge this Androgina in the
Greeks and foreign Philosophers, who only (as it were) by certain chinkes
and creuises behold the Sun, seeing the true light thereof remains amongst
our selves: and whatsoever they defined of it, was either ignorauntly or by
stealth which they have disguised since, as not to be seen to borrow any thing
of other strange nations which they call barbarous. The true and only
Androgina is that which was presented unto us, not by a history or ryding
tale, but by a marvelous effect in the person of Adam, when this mighty
Archit^uctor of all things, of a sovereign wisdom reserved only to
himself, framed of one body, and one spirit, two bodies and two minds,
which proves this amity to be more divine and heavenly than the common sort
can presume: Albeit if you will that I declare more at large (having already in
short revealed this excellent miracle under the which is comprehended the Image
of true love) what liberty God has left us since, to love one another, and
the cause why we traueyle in affection: Assure your self seigneur Phylopolo,
to note no less confusion in me, then happened to him, who undertaking to
dispute upon the nature of God, referred it always from one day to another, as
a thing incomprehensible to our minds: Oh God what thing is love: may I say it
proceeds of a similitude manners: or that he takes his beginning of a
constellation or influence of the self ascendantes under the which we are
borne: No, no, for then, in both the one and other manner it must needs follow
by infallible consequence, that no man loving should be deceived in his love,
but be encountered with reciprocal action, I mean, every one that loved,
should be also beloved: And to establish love upon a self education and
mutual nouriture, would seem no less far from reason, then free from all
conformity to truth, seeing mutual nouriture, kindles a custume and certain
sparks of private familiarity: but neither one body, nor one spirit, sure,
seigneur Phylopolo, the more I aspire into consideration of this great
divinity which we speak of, the more am I rapt into confusion, with such
ghastly amase, that me thinks it were better for me to judge that love is not,
then raising my thoughts above the reach of nature, to seek to fly into his
dwelling, to discover the force wherewith nature has armed him even from the
beginning of the world: And even as who pretendes to comprehend the
substance and majesty of this universal maker and creator of us all,
discourses in himself his most infinite miracles, as this round and firm
plot of the earth, and the voluble course of the skies above, and so discending
from one wonder to an other, fyndes at last, by the greatness of these
effects that the great GOD is not to be discerned by the faculty of mortal
judgment, but that he contaynes an essence exceeding man's consideration: even
so, to whom so ever it lay in desire to understand at large what love is, it
is needful he enter into a particular contemplation of all his wonderful
effects, and so, resolve and end that it is a thing, whose knowledge can not
enter into the spirit of man: So that seeing love takes his being, neither of
a heavenly influence, nor conformity of conditions, nor lastly of a custom
or mutual conversation, what other thing shall I term him to be, than a
mocion sturring I know not how, which is far more easy to be felt in our
hearts, then uttered by speech: yea it so knittes and unites our minds, that
being the cause of a perpetual death, yet it reuiues us in an other, making us
forget our proper condition, to remember our selves eftsoons in an other,
second our selves, and draws us besides by a divine power, with such a strong
and indissoluble bond (returning to the first Androgina of our father Adam)
that he distills two spirits into one body, and by the same miracle brings to
pass that two spirits be made one mind in two bodies, (is not this I pray
you) a most sovereign and extreme miracle, wherein to the end to draw you to
a better understanding of my saying and not to think it a fable, is it not (as
it were) to have one spirit in two bodies, when a man and woman differ not in
desire of things but appliyng in conformity of wills and affections, the one
does not desire but that which the other does wish, and yet being one mind in
two bodies, they become in ye end by a singular metamorphesis and exchange
two spirits in one body, because my mistress standing in full possession of
my heart, and I likewise ruling over her affections, I can not but esteem my
self to possess both mine own and hirs, and she likewise to govern them
both, seeing that like as if I be named Lord over hirs and her, I may
rightfully mean my self the only possessor of both our hearts, so, albeit
we seem both deprived of two minds and two hearts, yet we retain and
possess both the one and other in our selves: And therefore who can say that
the knowledge of love is hable to happen into our minds: or that we have the
faculty to discern the true substance and matter of love. This is the cause
why the ancient fathers and philosophers, amongst the demons which they
established (the only searchers out as they thought of our thoughts and
actions) called love Demon, as to advise us thereby that it is a thing enforced
by a natural instinct, and (as it were) by an impression which we keep of our
ancient image, without other consideration, a thing to be discerned by actual
example: seeing that even as, when we encounter upon a sudden any of our old
friends, whose long absence leads us in a want of knowledge of him, we waver
in judgment, and yet being assured in the end that it is the same of whom we
doubted in the beginning, we embrace him with plawsible signs of so happy a
meeting: even so reserving some knowledge of that ancient custom, wherein it
seems the heavens (if we may use the phrase of the Philosophers) did consent
to us, as soon as our eye has taken hold of her to whom our nature does
draw us, we begin as all amazed to enter into knowledge and (albeit not well
assured otherways than in feeling some little spark of the ancient
conjunction) fortifiyng our selves in our selves by little and little (as being
then assured to have found again the object whereunto the heavens have vowed
us) we delight, we congratulate and become familiar with every pleasure end
contentment: wherein notwithstanding I do not hold, that after such carectes
engraued within us, and that the two lovers be tied together in one mind, by I
know not what benefit, which they understand not (for so has love taught me
to say) we do not desire after a long use and conversation together, a
coniuntion of the two bodies one in another, the same being that appetite which
nature has infused generallye into us all and that we find it better in our
Ladies, than in any other woman whatsoever in respect of the great sympathya
and bound of friendshish which is between her and us, the same retayning such
a force in action of our love, that if after such a valiant beginning, we
chance to be called to perticipate in the pleasure, much less (in mine
opinion) that our love diminishe or fall into any default, but rather that it
will take new force and always increase more and more: Where if even in the
beginning we had not traveled but for that point, the conquest had been
loathsome, and the continuance none, seeing when the desire had been
satisfied, our delight would have vanished, as the smoke dissolues when the
fire forbeares his action, and every effect mortefieth when the cause is taken
away: so that as I can not allow that love (if love it may be called) either
constant or of continuance, whose only purpose is to possess that point: so
also he is weak in opinion, whose fear makes him doubt that the greatness of
his love will diminishe by this mean, and therefore dare not entreat his
mistress in that respect: Love is then a power lying between the two worse
extremities, not setting his original upon this common lust, and yet, though
long he do reject it, at last he does admit it: the same being the cause (as
I believe) why all our church laws in the consomation of a true marriage
(wherein ought to consist the mark and end of true friendeship) require not
but the consent of the parties: as though this true love of marriage ought not
to pass but under a conformity of minds, and not by any lust or suggestion
of the flesh: Thus ended Monophylo, not without a singular contentment to
Chariclea, who to witness how deeply she favored his side, wished she might
warrant his opinion with such authority as she would, the rather (says she)
for that with the property of Archars, who advisedly direct and level their
arrows to a little white, in respect of the white, which of it self is a
small substance, but in a certain secret regard of honor to come nearest
that little mark: even so albeit your lover aspire mistically to that last and
desired sacrifice in love, yet it is not the principal purpose that first
induced him to love: wherein suer as your reasons hold such conformity with
truth, that if love himself should discende from his temple to dispute herein,
he could not more lively touch the very white of this business, so I believe
yt in your mouth are presently revealed ye oracles of Cupido, whereof seigneur
Monophylo, according to my prerogative, I institute you from thinstaunt,
archbishop. Even now began Phoebus to change complexion, converting his rays
of warm reflexcion into a darcke dispericion, inclined (as it proved to
relieve the earth with some pleasant dew or sweet shower, which
notwithstanding) had no power to offend in any sort these four valiant
champions of love, who by his divine providence had so well pauished them with
trees and leaves intricatelie enterlaced together, that neither the sun had
any hurtful power over them, and much less the wind could use his vyolence,
by mean whereof, the Lady, after a little pawse, fell eftsoon upon the
matter of her last speech: If (says she) Cupido be drawn to favor you in
respect of your argument, I stand in doubt whether the sun has reason to
rest contented, as seeking to quench the fire which you begun to kindle in
us touching the deuinitie of love: which perhaps he does for malice, as
seeing this little mighty God does blow up more flame within our hearts than
he that is esteemed the general star to give light to the whole world:
under your correction Madam, says Glaphyro, Monophylo has brought the sun
eftsoon into memory of his ancient loves, which I see he can not remember,
without these sweet tears which you see he lettes fall, to record the great
unthankfulness he received of his Lady Daphne after so many infinite
merits: And so let him be excused (says Charyclea) only this condition I
promise and make, what tears or showers so ever he let fall, not to depart
from this place till our argument be further enlarged, and drawn to an other
issue: and always will I allow your reasons seigneur Monophylo, wherein you
have not only deuinely satisfied the deuinitie of love, but also erected a
notable method and mean, not how the lover ought to behave himself, but
(without difficulty) how he may maintain and defend his challenge wherein I
doubt not but these gentilmen will not only approve the matter, but join
with me in voice, to commend your judgment. Only phylopolo, to whom these
contemplacions were of careless regard, as delighting rather in a liberty of
mind, and general assemblyes where he might liberally slent with all women
and put them in some waspish humor, desiring here to play an other party
with the Lady, and convert his weapons not against Monophylo, but covertly to
touch her, I could with all my heart, Madam, says he, pass my consent to
the opinion of Monophylo, as by that means to be acceptable to him for the
matter, and not hateful to you that so allows it, but seeing you take
pleasures to sound me so deeply, I pray you let me have freedom of speech
with favor, and rather equity in judgment, then disdain to hear my short
opinion: I have listened, with no small diligence to his tedious reasons,
whereof as I find some good, other passable, and the most part impertinent and
loathsome enough: so above all I find the chiefest mark whereunto he seemed to
pretend, was, to make us approve loyalty of one man to one woman: wherein,
seigneur Monophylo, albeit modesty has hither unto brydeled in me, that which
desire offered to enforce, the rather when you fell upon that point wherein you
have given such a gloase to faith: yet seeing you are settled in this voluntary
pawse, I can do no less (with the present opportunity) than enter the field
against you, the matter of your retoricall answer to seigneur Glaphyro, whom
you have established judge in his cause as to know, if his Lady commit heresy
in love against him, whether he could quietly digest it or not: hoping by
such pollecie drawing the worm from his nose, to make him confused in his
saying: But seeing in a civil and respect of high courtesy you seek to bear
the state of procurer general to the community of Ladies, I hope my mocion
will not seem intolerable, if under the like affection of nature, I sewe to
be protector to maintain in their rightes, the condition of men: wherein I
doubt not with such reasons in my self, and honest conformity on your side,
to make you see and know, that albeit loyalty is requisite in the woman to the
man, yet that men are not loyable to such laws, although women (for many
necessary respects) stand subject to their awe. I thank you (says
Glaphyro) for that of your self, without any mocion or merit of mine, you
undertake the defense of my cause, wherein (according to your liberal offer to
stand me in this pleasure) me thinks Monophylo may well assure himself,
that albeit, in the charge you mean to lay upon him, he have the better of
you, yet shall he with much difficulty mainetaine his proof, that love
consists not but in a thing, which he cannot unfold, seeing such forms as
are not to be revealed do seldom happen in love: Here, I governing (as I have
said) their excercises, and therefore concealed my self, as rather to use
mine ears than my tongue, seeing them pass over so lightly the last speeches
of Monophylo, and desirous to supply their default, concluded at last to break
my first purpose of silence: and therewith roosing my self in my place,
without other reverence, than if I had assisted their company all that after
dinner, presumed to tell them that in those two points was cause of
controuers^ie worthy such an assemblye, and to the which it belonged to
Monophylo, in common hour, to prepare his answer, least he were noted either
of insufficiency in matter, or obstinacy in will, and so lose in one instaunt
the estimation which he had so painefully got, and carefully kept: for my
part if by you others I might be admitted into the socyetie of this quarrel, I
would easily incline to the part of you seigneur Glaphyro and Phylopolo: and
therefore let him if he list, whet both his wit and tongue, the better to assure
his credit in the defense he has taken in hand: here Madam Chariclea, amazed
above the reast with my sudden approach, but more troubled (as it seemed) with
my boldness of speech, what seigneur Pasquier says she how are you
dropped out of the clouds, or by what chance are you so aptly light into this
company: suer Madam, and by that faith which I reserve for the God of love
(quod I,) I find my self no less passyoned then you, and to tell you the
cause and manner of my coming hither, though I use a simple truth, yet I fear
it would carry incredulity with you: only having to record at large my
unquiet thoughts, traueiling in contemplacion to the goddess of my devotion
to whom you are no stranger, I know not by what happy wind, I was blown
into this pleasant haue^, where with no small delight, I have made my mind a
register of all your discourses, which I did not think to interupt, without
this occasion of Monophylo, who contrary to the opinion of Phylopolo, goes
about to prove that love is not a lust of corporal conjunction: which I can
not consent unto him, albeit in so doing I shall somewhat transgress your
will: your will is not law (says the Lady) and much less of autorite to
direct the company, seeing as you have no prerogative in council, so you are
not touched in example, and so, if you can not forbear partiality in
judgment, at least let modesty govern your speech, least either you innouate
your purpose or deserve to have the law of silence laid upon you: for we have
already passed sentence on Monophylos side as also Phylopolo, has allowed his
reasons, to whom belongs a deeper interest in the matterthan to you: whereupon
Phylopolo (after the company had somewhat saluted my sudden coming) protested
in his own behalf, that it should not be long of him, that I undertook not
for his sake, his defense: And if (says he) I have necligently past over any
discourse of Monophylo, it was not for that I did consent with him, but only
upon a new occasion, that I might charge him with innouacion of matter:
therefore it may like you (good Madam) not to allege my self in prejudice of
mine own condition, and much less that necligence make me to loase my case,
if there be just cause of favor: I answered to be as free from such meaning,
as far from the fact protesting rather to live in silence all the rest of my
life with the contentment of Madam Chariclea, then to hazard her displeasure
by any liberty of speech, by which suit she was content to grant me audience
albeit upon this charge, that there should be no expectacion of reply, if
perhaps any matter succeed to the disaduauntage of seigneur Monophylo whose
arguments seemed more acceptable to her (although they were naked and void of
reason,) then all my proofs, figured in the subject I pretended, what sense
and method so ever they contained: whose law albeit I allowed, as esteeming
her word, aperemptorie warraunt, yet Phylopolo (after some waspish and
reciprocal iarres) denied her to have any such soueraignetie over that little
fellowship, and gave me an inckling to begin, as in whom he seemed to
repose his protection: No rather the defense of love himself (said I) and
that against him, who, under a pretense to protect him, thought by a certain
art to revive him, when in deed he has altogether mortified him wherein
notwithstanding I half excuse him, as imparting the cause with love, who
albeit will make himself familyar with us, choosing his seat in the very
intralles of our hearts, yet he will in no wise that we know him, but covering
more and more his nature, he leaves us only a judgment according to our
particular affections for love being as a Camelion changing diverse colors
according to his sundry obiectes, every one has his singular opinion
according to ye variety of passions that are in him: and yet in this
diversity, I never knew lover, who either more or less aspired not to this
last point of pleasant use, according to the suggestion of the passion which
he endured: For even as in all things we pretend to a certain end, so love
must necessarily contain a last effect wherein our minds rest satisfied: All
men travel to eat, and supply the necessities of nature, the Captain to
win honor, incurres peril of death, and the pensionarie fouldiour runs to
the wars to have part of the spoil: yea there is no sort of operation how
light so ever it be (unless it proceed from a mad man) wherein is not a hope
of gain and special pretense of a resolute end, the which as it proceeds
not but of a lust that falls in us, so the more we are tormented in it the
more do we settle our heart upon it: So that it is necessary there be a
certain end in love, wherein albeit we feel our selves affected according to
the variety of our passions, it is needful there be a general cause by
which, or for which we love: But least we be abused by the mean of equalitye
proceeding of the proximitie of causes; you shall here understand seigneur
Monophylo, that all the Philosophers maintain (as certainelye is true) that in
all the things of the world there be two principal causes, efficiens, and
finalis: that they name efficient or original, whereof the thing is, and by the
other is meant the cause, why and in whose favor the thing is: which words
albeit to some delicate stomachs may seem to smell somewhat of the school,
yet they are not impertinent to the present question as also necessary to who
soever seeks to understand the knowledge of the truth: oh thrice and thrice
happy is he, who understanding these causes, has the faculty to distinguish
the one from the other, the same being the want (as I guess) which hitherto
has kept you in this foul error, for to take away this impression from the
people that this lust and desire of the flesh is not the cause why we love,
you seek to prove it to be a thing accidental, (which notwithstanding)
proceeds assuredly of the true and pure substance of love: The efficient or
original cause by the which we love a Lady, is in deed the self same
instinct which you say breeds in us as it were by the permission of heaven:
but the end and purpose why we love is, to possess whollye, pleasauntlye, and
absolutely, and so every one of us does love, as one day to possess at our
pleasure, and the cause, by which we are induced to desire this conjunction
more with our mistress, than any other, rises of I know not what, which you
say is more easy to feel, than able to be expressed, which we imprint in us,
by a certain opinion we conceive of it, making thereby a peecemeale or
confusion of reason with passion: This is the cause wherefore our common and
general mother, sought to divide us from all other creatures, who without
discretion of that which pleases them, but pushed forward by their first
motion, tending to the conservation of their kind, seek indifferent
conversation with their females, not knowing what it is to love, because in
them does want opinion, the chief cause that breeds love, some
notwithstanding will not stick to maintain that they have a certain
ymagination and spark, to whom, if they have proved the condition of
beasts, I leave the matter to their beastlye judgment, seeing it is not for
the respect of beasts I speak, but for men which love: wherewith Phylopolo
dissembling his thought, yet have I learned always (says he) that lovers were
beasts: I know not (quod I) either what sorts of lovers you mean, or with
what forms of beasts you resemble them, but well may I vaunt for my self, by
the honor and love which of long I have borne, and yet with all reverence do
owe to a singular mistress of mine, of a simple ydyot, I am beecome better
instructed, then if I had run over all the precepts of the Courtyer. But
not to wander in variety of matter, as I hold with you ( seigneur Monophylo)
that love kindles of this natural instinct, so there restes only in proof
between you and me, and the same to be handled by some sufficient means,
whether the only end of love consider the sweet use, wherein if I might
strengthen my self by the common opinion of the world you should not only
loase your challenge, but resign at one instaunt both the field and the fight:
for (except your self) what is he in the world that loves not chiefelye for
that end, and yet (sir) not to assure my self upon so frail a judgment, I
pray you tell me, if the love of a man to a woman pretended not but to the
mind, why should we feel the same to passion us, sometime with a whire wind
of joy, and from thence to a storm of sorrow, and then sodainelye become as
overwhelmed with quailenesse of fear. And in the friendeship of man to man, we
are touched with no such torment, saving that in this last we hold our selves
satisfied to be beloved of them, and the same being known unto us, we have
already touched the point of our pretense: but in the last, besides the mind
we accompany our desires with a hope which leads us in a promise to bring us
one day to the port of pleasant possession: Besides I pray you tell me, if
this love were guided only by a bond and conjunction of minds, ought we
not, by natural judgment, rather love him whom God has fashioned in every
degree like to our selves, then to follow the woman whom it seems he created
one degree inferior to our selves: But we prove the contrary in common
example and experience, seeing (without comparison) we rather doat of the
woman, than love the man: yea we see (by this feminine love) that the law of
true friendeship, which was between man and man, has been violated and
corrupted, wherein I could commend unto you the tragedye of Gysippus and
Tytus, which Tytus, notwistanding the ancient and settled friendship between
him and his companion, which was such, as their seemed to remain between them
a common will in all things, yet such was the violent fury of love toward
the future spowse of his friend, that it dissolved that strong and long league
between them, and notwithstanding the order and help of his companion, he
prepared his own destruction: the same moving, for that he proved in his
mind two extremities of contrary quality: albeit the one more vehement than
the other, which was love, whose sharp stinges so pricked him forward, that
albeit he would have refrayned in favor of the friendship to his dear
Gysippus, yet he had no power to apply other remedy, than by his death,
whereunto he prepared him self: A like example do I find in Iustine, of the
son of a King, who defyling all laws of men and nature, was so enchaunted in
love to a stepmother of his, that notwithstanding his office of obedience to
his father, yet could he never be purged of that evil, but either by the
accomplishment of his desire, or that death had applied a plaster to his
raging sore: what set abroche these vessels of frenzy in these two men (for
so may I call them, as by whom was violated all right of friendship and
nature) but that in the friendship of man to man is comprehended but a
co^formitie of minds and this love contaynes a sympathia, communicating both
with the mind and the body, I mean (as touching the body) this fleshly
copulation, the only end and purpose of our love: for even as in all other
things being come to the end we aspire to, we resolve into a contentment and
absolute quiet, even so by this only mean, these two before named attained to
the execucion of their passioned desires, and not only they but all others
arriving in that desired port of pleasant use: wherein, in place and proof of
our former perplexities in these extreme desires, being in this haven, the
storms of our violent passions, do either absolutely dissolve, or partelye
qualefie, and love takes in us a new form and habit as our nature is
disposed, abiding still notwithstanding in his essence of love: this is the
cause why the Ethnicks have figured the same Androgina by you alleged, as when
the two parts and moyties separated, seek to reioyne themselves, as an
ancient poet of that time held that the sowles were thereupon coopled
together, to whose opinion you could willinglye have condiscended (were it not
you feared to entangle your self) when you confessed to us, that the
Androgina, was a desire to unite and knitte the two moyties being divided: and
if you will discende to that which God from the beginning of the world
propoundes unto us (whereof you have thought to make your profit albeit upon
credit) is it not provided in the same, that we should be rather two minds in
one body and one flesh, then one spirit within two bodies: I will not deny,
that to form thandrogina, both the one and other are requisite, but the same
is to prove unto you, that if you desire one mind only in two bodies, you
seek to make this our Androgina defective and imperfit: And whereupon the issue
of your discourse (to give a greater grace to your opinion you seem to allege
the authority of your laws, as in that they require the only consent to
establish marriage: I say that consent proceeding of this conjunction of minds
not common, breeds and engenders this love, but the communion of ye bodies
consomates and makes it perfect: for so did our laws understand, who in every
respect maintained the true end of marriage to be the multiplying of the
world: and yet I stand in some doubt in what sense they construed this
consent you speak of: seeing we have in example that it has been suffered to
men and women to enter marriage even in the age of indiscression, wherein they
seemed not so precise in knowledge, so that only there were ability of
cohabitation: and therefore it seemed the laws understood by this consent, a
mutual foreknowledge to this coniuction of the bodies: the same being proved
in many lamentable treatyes of marriage, where if one part be found cold or
imperfect, the bale dissolues at the will of the other, which in other respect
had not been suffered neither by the decrees of our holy Popes, nor our good
Ciuilian lawyers to whom I refer this argument: only let suffice you that
marriages are formed by the consent you speak of, but fastened by the actual
copulation of the body: and where you seem to esteem love a thing far to
heavenly to take his ground in a matter which in your opinion pertakes so
deeply with an earthlye or base substance: see in what error you fall, and
evil do you acknowledge the great felicity which is in love, as tending
only to so happy a end by the which is procured an immortality in our
mortal bodies by the propagation of our selves into our likes: in which point
nature resembles the wise and discreet mother, who forseing the benifite, that
in time to come will prove necessary for her child (wherein his slender age
makes him ignorant) by gifts, presents sweet and pleasant speech, with
other allurements apt to entise his youth, she pampreth and draws him on
(without that he thinks of it) to direct and tend to the purpose which in her
self she has laid and ymagined, until by a long assistaunce of time and
ripe confirmation of age, this child is fashioned fit for the purpose of his
mother to both their great contentmentes: even so Nature our wise and
foreseeing mother, pretending in her self the increase of the world, does
sow in us from our beginning, certain little seeds of love, which we suffer
easily to succeed in us, till they congeale to a ripe and perfect fruit,
which is not that pleasure which we hold in community with other creaturs but
rather as I have said, seigneur Monophylo to make us immortal in our
mortality: and as she does hyde and cover this secret with the veil of the
first pleasure offered in this mutual communion, so aspiring further, we know
at last by a more great and iteratiue pleasure that this end tended to a
higher end, which was to have children: in whom (as having fulfilled our last
purpose) naturally we delight with more pleasure, than in all the other things
of the earth: which end is an end interminable, and subject to no end,
because nature is never weary of having children: And so do renew within us
continually the lusts of pleasure, and also (by the same mean) desire, which
then does not suggest with such passion, because that after this pleasant
conjunction we stand assured of speedy remedy, which we durst not so much as
promise before, wherein as before, we flote between hope and fear, so now we
live in assurance to command that end, whereunto all our thoughts tended:
so that love remains always, albeit he put on diverse qualities, because that
if at the first he might be called desire, garnished with hope, now he may be
named desire accompanied with assurance, I say then that love (I mean that
love which torments men) is a passion conceived of an opinion proceeding of a
certain instinct which is printed within us tending to the corporal
conjunction one of another* So that let love be an instinct according to your
persuasion seigneur Monophylo, but yet let him not be without a desire to be
reioyned, and likewise let your desire march always with the instinct, so
shall we perhaps satisfy certain men, who (by reason of this lust that
encountreth here) maintain, that love ought not to be invested with that name
till the act of pleasant use be performed: wherein for my part, albeit I make
no great profession of terms, (being understood of you) yet methinks such
men are not without their several errors: for albeit we are not as yet entered
into this point of corporal use, yet there is an other thing which in our
selves we enjoy, by which we merit the name of lover to our Ladies, and that
is a natural and inward impression and opinion of their virtues, which as we
cover secretly in our minds; so for them, we love them above all other women?
And to speak simply, of this instinct love does principally depend, because
he seldom aduaune^th himself without the society of this natural lust which
we have to knitte together: where oftentimes we lust for this operation of
nature in many women, without respect of love, but guided (as it were) by a
certain brutalitie without any other consideration than to pass and purge our
collar: But to return to my matter, that love is a passion, I believe you
doubt not of it as by your own discourse you have half confessed: And
touching this communion of the bodies although you are hard to be satisfied,
yet I think I have said as much as is necessaryly requisite in the matter: But
touching the instinct, albeit it cannot well be discovered, yet I ymagin there
is none of us which knows not, that naturally we are inclined more to some
persons, then to others, wherein as our natural judgments are diverse, so
also do we perticulerlie bequeth our hearts, every one as nature leads him:
from whence I may say, does spring the diversity of opinions, so as to some
it seems the truth lies drowned in the bottom of the pit, because every
one of us has a judgment not according to truth, but as our instinct moves
us* So that albeit I cannot discover from whence this instinct proceeds
(unless it (...) of our own nature, because we nourishe so many inclinations
as we contain numbers of men) yet both (...) reason do teach me, that it is
the only keye that opens the door to love: And if (as it may be) many men
fall into affection with one woman, it is because they have some resemblaunce
or affinity with a common influence. This diffinition I have used for the
time, of love, notwistanding, I am sure there is an other kind, which seems
to hold of nature, and yet proceeds of the instinct we speak of, as we see
it happens ordinarilye, that albeit of our selves we are not inclined to sundry
personages, yet contrary to our forethoughtes we feel our selves induced to
bear them a certain affection, because only we see them disposed in good
will to us: wherein our unthankfulness would judge against us, if we should
not be reciprocal in regards of friendship. This is a kind of love, but not
of so liuelye condition as the other, seeing (to give him his proper nature)
he pertakes more with pity, than with love: for even as it is familiar to
every one to green in the displeasure of an other (yea, sometimes to have
sorrow for our enemies when we see them afflicted) and that not in respect of
any affection, like to the friendeshippe we owe to others to whom our nature
does inuit us: even so I cannot ascribe to this last love I speak of, other
dignity than an ordinary compassion, which we take of such whom we see
tormented in our favor, without any touch at all of that divinity which is
rightlye in the other, of whose perfection, albeit I have not so largely spoken
as the worthynesse of the matter requires, and that I stand doubtful with
what mind you digest my reasons, yet I hold my self sufficiently satisfied
with that little wherein it has pleased you to hear me: aduising you for
end, that what so ever I have preferred, contains matter of no small
contemplation, unless to such as having less proved it then I, understand
better his nature, seeing it is easy to be judged that standing (as I do) in
this state of servitude for her who is not unknown to you (Madam) I can have no
liberty of judgment to discern neither in this high matter, nor any other
of far less importance: Here Chariclea, somewhat what smyling, without
consent notwithstanding to any of my reasons, challenged my excuse of
ignorance, and asked me of whom or how I had learned so much: to whom I
answered, that I had no other school than amongst the multitude, to whose
liberty of life (Madam, quod I) is joined a higher capacity in those things,
than to such who wandering in this darcke prison, have not the faculty to
know the thing that has brought them to this captiuitye: you shall have never
the more authority for all that (says she) seeing even in the beginning of
your discourse, you pronounced sentence against your self, as seeking to
instruct us, that such as dealt in the argument of love, had no other method of
speech, than according to their passions: But if they had made no proof of
him, they should be less credible seeing they speak as Clerks of arms: so
that by your own law you cannot be believed of us: Wherewith Monophylo, to
whom silence was a trouble, you may in your own respect Madame give him
assurance of no faith nor credit, but not for these two other Gentlemen: and
therefore I beseech you, albeit it impugn your order, let it be lawful for
the defense of mine own cause for me to give answer to seigneur Pasquier, in
whose favor I think and not altogether for my sake, you have erected a law
not to replye: this law (says she) was not made without reason, and therefore
not to be dispensed with all by any suit, and therefore content your selves in
your several condition, he to have had audience against your will, and you to
have said so sufficiently as there needs no further defense: good Madam (quod
I) let not singular partiality prevail above common right, least in
inclyning to much to the cause of Monophylo, your own credit at last be not
suspicious, which words I tempered with such dissembled countinance, that
Monophylo grew iealouse of my challenge, thinking I had defied him as judging
him unable to answer me: by which occasion, with sundry shows of indignity
toward me, he made many offers of revenge which the Lady, under a certain
pretty waspishe anger, cut of, willing him at last to suffice, that I was but
extraordinary in that fellowship, and not naturalised amongst them: and
therefore seigneur Monophylo, (says she) it is not upon him you ought to
stay, seeing (in a more respect to honor) you have to remember the alaram,
which even now these two other Gentlemen offered you, against whom it lies you
upon to stand upon your guard, and not to feed the time with this new war,
which being without fear, requires no great pollecie: I would Madam says
Phylopolo, who with Glaphyro had heard with silence all our reasons, you would
remove the veil of your affection, and give at last the honor where it is
best deserved: well well sir (says she) of all the reast you have the least
interest in this challenge, only prepare you to perform your enterprise which
you undertook before the coming of Pasquier, to the end that seigneur
Glaphyro may also succeed in the matter of this attempt: This match Madam,
says Monophylo, me thinks is unequally made, seeing under your offer to
favor my weakness, you pretend my whole destruction, as sparing me to enter
the field against one enemy, and stirs up at one instaunt these two
valiant Capitaines to commit me to utter spoil: this fear (quod the Lady) is
without need, seeing as well the goodness of the cause as the value of the
party, does warraunt a contented success: But now seigneur Phylopo, by whom
is opened the occasion of this quarrel, I pray you make us judges whether you
be as roughe in execution, as forward in enterprise, wherein (in my fancy) you
have some necessary reason, as to have chosen a burden whose weight (if you
well forsee not) will overthrow you, seeing you maintain (as a singular
paradox) that loyalty is not requisite as well in a man as in a woman:
Phylopolo answered that albeit he feared least under his pretense to favor
and help the opinion of Glaphyro, he should procure to himself a self wrong,
yet Madam waighing with the nature of your importunities, the duty of mine
own promise, I will give you my fancy in few words, and that only to
declare to Monophylo (under the reverent correction of the whole fellowship)
that where he asked, whether we delighted in our Ladies, using prostitution
with others, and likewise what estimation we ought to have of them, abandoning
our selves to strangers, this comparison in my judgment has no place: not
that I mean to offer any oppression to the noble sex feminine the rather to
extol ours, but only to add a certain new memory to our ancient
prorogatiue, that as women are not placed in such degree of liberty as men, so
many things are made lawful to men, which are not suffered to women: I mean
not as touching government of common wealths, exercise of arms, and charges
over pollitick states from whence they have been repulsed as insufficient for
such uses: only the auncientes have desired in them a certain chastenesse,
which only virtue they have esteemed a supply sufficient to all other
things, of which, as well our laws civil as natural, had deprived them,
which has not been required in man, as being nothing so frayl and sliding a
substance as the woman, wherein nature, providing by good and reasonable
means, has pronounced many things as improper to women, which she has
established as matters of praise to men: touching which law if I were urged to
give a more full reason, I could not otherways answer, than that nature
has proclaimed it: neither was I borne or preserved hethervnto, to make a base
estimation of your sex, of whom the greatest part of my felicity and life do
depend (which perhaps he spoke skoffinglye) only let it suffice you, that
such a thing being imprinted from the beginning within our hearts by a natural
inclynation, there is no need to apply to one, that which may be appropryed
to an other: O smooth style and far from the matter, O simple countenance
and no such meaning, O short discourse, quoth the Lady, and yet nothing
forgotten: I see now your judgment is led by your own opinion, and that
which erst the world noted as a respective modesty in you, I see turns to a
vomit, and you infected with a popular error. But where is seigneur Monophylo,
will he leave us in this plain way without succor: suer I must appeal to
you the rather, for that under this generality me thinks is comprehended that
goddess which you daily worship, where so ever she abide, yea though she
sit even in the midst of your heart: and for my part I could not thus long
have refrayned from answer, were not that both I must not plead in mine own
cause, and also it was latelye defended by your goodly ordinances: it is not
Madam says Monophylo long since you prevented that, when you told us that we
stood not now upon such scrupulous judgment besides, in encountering seigneur
Phylopolo, you shall not be noted to defend your proper cause, but to give
charitable aid to me and mine seeing it pleases you to endue me with that
honor and estimation: here the Lady took some pawse, as though she either
doubted the matter, or feared the success, which I think might be rather
laid to her want of exercise in such affairs, and therefore she wisely foresaw
that hardly she should govern her affection to the cause. But Phylopolo,
using the offer of his opportunity, urged her eftsoon with this second
challenge: I see (says he) your cause is like to quail for want of a good
Champion, if your self undertake not the defense of your quarrel, which in it
self is so perilous, that by good reason, Monophylo, eschewes the listes,
least he be made recreant: wherewith the Lady kindling in a soft anger, as
appeared by a fresh blood drawn into her face, told him, she would rather
put her simplicitye on the judgment of the company, than suffer him to steal
away the victory from her in a cause of no less equity on her side, than
altogether unjust touching his part: wherein (says she) (somewhat rising from
the seat where she sat^) albeit by your wisdom you think to reuerse the
innocence of my cause, yet if I fail in force, I hope the matter will not
faint in value and goodness, as being in it self hable to defend it self
without either orator or advocate: and seeing from the speech of that liberty
which you labored to attribute to men, you are distended into many other
circumstances far impertinent to ye matter of your surmised question, I will
not prepare to satisfy only the motion of our present argument, but even all
the residue of your reasons, to the end your self may judge that you have
put nothing to me of credit, nor I unwilling to repaye it with money no less
curraunt than yours: Wherein if you will enter into necessary consideration of
the difference in our two causes, I doubt not (neither is my fancy vain) but
you will find them of no less inequality and dissemblaunce, then between a
paineted image and a lively creature: For as your reasons are grounded upon
transitory opinions of men, so I have even nature hirselfe to enter defense
with me, who to prove she has not altogether exempted us from acts of virtue
and worthynesse: I pray you look into the lives of Semyramys and Tomyrys for
the direction of a policy or common wealth with infinite others, by whose
womanly wisdom not only their Monarchies and states have been well
established, but also had such a valiant dexterity in arms, that by them
their posterity is made noble so long as the world remains a world: we
read also of Panthasile, and the Amazones of high renown for actiuitie in
warrre: for the gift of Poesy, we have Sapho, and in our own time a Lady of
high memory Margeret de valoys, besides the learned rowte in Italy, whose
works remain as lanternes to guide the studies of learned wits: if you seek
for examples of eloquence (the very pillour of every commonwealth well
guided) behold what majesty the Romans have given to Cornelia, and fame to
Hortensia, to the aid of whose natural wits, was joined such facility in
eloquence that they were valued with the best Orators in Rome, yea what numbers
might also be found in these days of equal merit that way, were not for the
malicious laws of men, who knowing the great minds of women, weak
notwithstanding in bodily force (even with the example of the silly fishes
who are devoured by the great) forbid us all charge over polliticke states,
making us of so frail judgment that we are bereaved from all liberty of
grauntes and alienations of our goods, without the express consent of our
husbands: And yet oh how common is the experience, that great and mighty
howses decline by the wilful prodigality of men, which are eftsoon restored
and entertained by the wise foresight and behauioer of the women, the same
being a probable inducement, that if it were lawful to us to apply our wits
with your exercises (if the direction of a public state, may resemble the
order of a private or familiar family) our capacity may stretch as well to the
greater, as we are thought sufficient to govern that of common moment: But to
leave the examples of the Ethnikes, what state of more majesty have you, than
the supremasie and throne of Rome: wherein notwithstanding we have read that a
woman under the attire of a man, has discharged a government equal with any
that succeeded her: yea it was necessary both to her and Semyramys as well to
content the world, as to intercept the popular opinion, to disguise themselves
in the proportion of a man, which state so long as they exercised, nothing was
evil done, all their attemptes were virtuous, and held for true examples of
high magnanimity: But as soon as they fell into the discovery of men, and that
they were known for women, their ancient praise of virtue, prowess and
holiness, began to take contrary qualities, and beecame no less loathsome,
than the parties hateful, by whom they were performed: such is the settled
malice of men toward us, that fearing, least by our virtue and wisedeme, they
might perhaps fall into some decay of credit with the world (with the
manner of tyrauntes, who destroy all such as they fear) have taken from us the
possession wherein we had as large an interest as they: it may be, you will
encounter me hear with the herisies of these two women by me alleged, as the
one pretending an unseemly lust in the person of her son, and the other in
the end stained with many gross follyes, for such is the common saying of men
as thinking by this only reason to triumph over our weakness: But Oh holy
argument, Oh well disposed people, Oh subtitye worthy your sex: as if even
those of whom you hold most, either for valiantness or wisdom, have not
more fallen into these vices: as first, your worthy Hercules by whose mean
you might well have vaunted to have killed all the monsters in the world, if
he had killed himself, when in place to weilde his heavy mase, he was
commanded to use the spindle. What say you then to your ydolatrous Solomon, to
whom albeit was given a singular wisdom, yet the histories challenge his life
in many other loathsome respects: wherein how far I could further enlarge
with examples of like resemblaunce, I make your self judge, though (in a
worldely custom) you had rather defend your proper errors, than confess a
simple truth: But let us cut off these fond opinions no less inconvenient
to you than hurtful to us, yea, if you weigh them in a precise consideration
most prejudicial to you, as being induced by God, (according to your general
opinion) with a more sound and stable wit than we: and falling eftsoons
upon my speech of opinion and nature, will you have a more wise Philosopher
than Socrates, who could not wink at the wrong which was offered us, but
holds us no less capable of every virtue and science, than even the best of
you: Lycurgus also by his laws accustomed women to deeds of arms with all
other exercises wherein you men challenge a singular peculiaritie: and now in
these days we are left only to our rocks: if I show you that in Lycya in
old time those acts which now you make proper only to us women, were the
common exercises of men, shall it be a sufficient example to prove that such
things consisted not but in mortal opinion: so that seigneur Phylopolo, where
only your tyranny has taken from us the lawful use of such acts and virtues
you must not wronfully blame nature from whom we have no less capacity in
all sciences than you: in deed Lady says Phylopolo, you half persuade me to
believe it, although it is contrary to my will, so that what by the natural
resemblaunce of your examples, and force of your resons, which I could hardely
have thought could have fallen into the brain of a woman, I am almost alured
to hold with you, protesting unto you in mine own hehalfe (which he uttered
under an honest and reverent grace) that in my common wealth you shall be one
day enstalled as president not in causes concerning the acts of women (as
Heliogobalus a Roman Emperor did to his mother) but to govern in affairs
most hard and necessary to entertain my estate: when your common wealth
stands in necessity of such governors (says she) I doubt not of sufficient
numbers besides my self to be your ministers, and albeit I doubt not (if you
resort to the opinion of the common sort) that this little discourse will not
seem strange to you, yet (notwithstanding by you men, we are restrained of
all liberty to read good authors and also to confer with clearkes of
learning and sience) I have spent some part of my voluble youth in such
contemplacions: I think Madam says Monophylo you have the voice of the whole
company, both to allow your reasons, and commend your order, and for my part,
I think your self of sufficient authority, without foreign examples, to
deface the opinion of such with whom your sex stands in a necligent or
careless regard, wishing you only might stand in place of a worthy
Achylles, to answer all sinister chalengers: such is also my consent to your
opinion, as I am fully persuaded (according to the matter of your discourse)
that the same has been the cause why the ancients Poets induyng every thing
of the world with his peculiar God, would not also leave them without their
goddesses, as for the matter of war they erected Bellona, as well as the God
Mars, over science and wisdom, they established Pallas as well as Mercurius,
the disposition of richesse they gave as well to Juno as to Plutus, in love
Venus had as high prorogatiue as Cupido, and touching Poesy, the nine Muses
were as famous as Phoebus, signifying to all the world under the cloak or
mean of Poesy, that as well women as men did aspire in deep capacity of the
arts and siences and all other things which are comprehensible with men: yea
a little further, because nature deuesting them of bodily force, seemed of
right to supplye them with the abundaunce of the mind, as being not coyffed
or ouercharged with so heavy a burden of the earth as we, but drawn forth
of a matter more purified, as taking their beginning of us, and we grosely
raised of the corrupt earth without any form: which surely is a mystery
which ought to figure unto us the majesty of that work of nature, when she
fashioned the woman: for even as we see in Limbeckes, from gross matters are
drawn and distelled sweet and delicate waters, albeit not in so great
quantity, even so women, being as it were distylled from the massiue body of
man, draws with her even the best, and leaving no other remain, than the
original matter of earth (which is his strength as to all other creatures)
puttes on the faculty of his magnanimity in all virtuous things: this
opinion (says Phylopolo, has a very near affinity with truth, seeing God
drawing the woman from the parts where lie our affections, thought to
disfurnish man of them, to the end to fashion the woman of that substance,
and therefore enduyng her with a sharp and vehement anger, with infinite
passions, it was necessary to take from her all force, least in her had been
found a creature more violent and furious (which he pronounced smilinglye)
than who within himself gnawes and ^eedes of a continual fierceness: no
rather (answers Monophylo) nature: (not to fail in any thing to perfect the
woman) having graffed in her so high and excellent a courage, would not by the
same effect arm her with such waspishe heates as rage in us, the rather to
lead her in a temperate discression, the better to govern her hautie courage:
as we see in young men more rash and enflamed humors, than in others, yea
almost thrust into fury and madness by abundaunce of blood and heat which
bear rule in them, where of the contrary, old men seem more gravely stayed
by reason the fountain of passions, which partlye draws her norriture from
the liver, begins to diminish and grow weak: even so, God delighting to
discover his inestimable power in the person of the woman, makes her in common
experience (by this default of ho^e humors) as well advised in her youth, as
the oldest and best stayed man of us all: only, in respect she is sprinckeled
with a pure and subtle blood, she keeps with her always, not a rash and
unbridled courage of our blind youth, but a mind altogether guided by a
certain constaunt wisdom: So that if we settle with them in right
consideration, we shall find the most principal stateliest monarchies that
ever were, to have been directed and preserved, by the wisdom and
magnanimitye of women, or at the least by their means as by a heavenly
influence: and of the contrary small common wealths running under the rule of
men* have either necligently dissolved, or at least, even in their first entry
been ^allowed with the name of tyranny (although I am not ignorant that
there is no rule so general, which has not his exception.) And Madam to
renew eftsoons the virtues of your Semyramys, did not she I pray you open
the first way to make her successors monarchs, even until Sardanapalus by
whose monstrous and filthy lusts, the gate was eftsoons closed upon his
subjects, as giving occasion to the Meade^ to invade the empire upon them: of
which second monarchy notwithstanding I mean not to speak, for the small
estimation which the historians make of it: But if we distende to the Persians,
what was their mean in the beginning to rule over so many nations, but only
the virtue and valiant minds of women, when all that people (under the
conduct of Cyrus) seeking to warraunt themselves by flight against the fury of
Astiages king of the Meades, the women ashamed of the infamy of their
husbands, issued out of the town wherein they had pretended their safety,
and running against them, with their secret parts all bare, asked them if they
would enter again into the place from whence they took their birth, the same
kindling such confusion in their husbands, y^ turning faces upon their enemies
with new hearts, they charged them so hoatlye, that they put them to flight, and
keeping from that time forward the better of them, they became also (as by
that fortune and mean) peaseable possessors of the greatest part of the
world: in memory of these, and as it were in an everlasting monument, it was
ordained that every king, before his entry into that town, out of the which
the women made such valiant issue, should give to every woman Citizen of
that place, a certain sum of silver according to the rate and measure of the
law: And albeit this monarkye by Alexanders means, was translated to the
Macedonians, yet consult with the cronicles, and see what continuance it had,
as taking his beginning in him, and also ending with him, and all because
against the office of mortality, he as a man had conspired to subdue the whole
world: and so in one instaunt, that empire was divided by scantlinges, which
even he in whom the world reposed most for valyauntcie, with such weary
travel had conquered. But now to an other, what common wealth has been ever
more noble than the Roman state, who being raised above all others, may vaunt
to have proou^^ all manner of pollitick gouernementes and from whence did she
draw her original being but from the good ma^r^nes of Troy: who ariuing
upon a coaste of Italy when their husbands were gone of forraging for vituals,
entered into common accord, as well touching their common reast and quiet, as
professing a present benifit, with continuance of honor to their posterity,
and determined at one instaunt to burn all their vessels and ships: which
being put to execution by the council of one of them named Roma (in memory of
which fact the town of Rome, took and has continued her name) they gave
occasion to the Troyans to establishe there, their abode and dwelling: So they
began to erect kings, who adding diverse names and qualities, as albania, and
then Rome, became by success of time, to be abused, and yet (such was the
suffraunce of destinye, who hatched in it self a new form of common wealth,
by the mean of Lucretia defiled by Tarquin, this monarchy changed into a
populer estate, such as was after observed by the space of five hundredth
years: here you may say, that kind of common wealth was not iutroduced by
the wisdom or council of women, even so it may be answered that upon them
fell the lotte and mean to direct that City in an other form, more
profitable for the common sort: But as there is no eternity in mortal
doings, so this common wealth declining into corruption by the licentious
ambition of potentates, to whose peruersitie of manners was required a new
pollecye, there rose up a Julius Caesar, who in a hawtie stoutnesse, inuerting
all ancient laws translated eftsons the order of this city into a
monarchy: but what monarchy may we name it: if not an empire of perpetual
tyranny disguised sometimes by the goodness of a few, who against their
wills were called and chosen to that dignity of an emperor: and yet it was
not for the regard of men, that the Gods prepared such reformations: But now
to a last example of familiarity, it is not yet six score years past, that
in one of the greatest monarchies even in the heart of christendom, a simple
maid (sent by gods providence) was sufficient, to deliver the whole country
from a general servitude, wherein they had long lived, so that it seems God
has reserved to women the best part of honorable victories as not leaving to
us to possess but their small remainder, and therefore with wrong our
ancestors sought to oppress this sex, as thinking to raise our own, which
(not to disguise the truth) comes not near their excellency by a million of
paces: For this have I to give you thanks (says the Lady Chariclea) although
thanks be no sufficient reward to so great a merit, and by this is worthyly
proved your noble condition, which I promise you shall remain with me in no
small estimation: only I am now sorry I used my authority heretofore so
preciselie over your silence, seeing by how much I restrained you to speak,
by so much was I a secret enemy to my self, which open wrong to your deep
judgment tempered with a modesty of speech not ordinary to the most sort of
Gentlemen: But having yet to end mine own Caruer, touching the iealouse
language of Phylopolo, which tended to prove that chastity was more requisite
in women than in men, I pray you let me ask him by what law men have that
privilege above women, if it by the law of God, either you understand it not
rightlye, or allege the text necligently, seeing the scripture abhorres the
same against chastity, as well in the man as in the woman: And if you challenge
it by the statutes of man, you can not allege them to my prejudice, unless
in this cause you will hold an estate both of judge and party: But be it
either sort, I will not much impugn your saying: not that I will confess
such an advantage (for so may I call it) to proceed by bond or natural law,
as you maintain, but by a certain honesty, by which we women plasing it
before our eyes, are always more in study to guard our chaste honor than men,
to whom it is a custom to bequeath their hearts upon credit upon the least
suggestion that mooues, wherein if by our wisdom we have learned to bridle
our natural lusts, and you men (as in a possession and custom without
memory) do slack, the raines to your loathsome desires, to the first that
offreth, I see no reason to allow you (in the matter of love) any prorogatiue
above us, seeing also (if I may weigh my reasons with the opinions of the
world) that as by common voice the woman is esteemed above him who offers
court to her (as she being called mistress, and he servant) so it stands
him more in duty not to offend his Lady, to whom he is bound then she to
fear him, whom she may command like as in common reason there is always
more liberty allowed in general respects to the master, than a simple
license to him that professes the state of a servant, and yet for my part,
because I will be no party to that fond opinion I neither can nor will
persuade, that in love there is or ought to be prorogatiue of power: For where
the woman is not equally plunged with the man, nor he likewise as deeply
touched with affection as the woman (how so ever they embrace one another) yet
such cold banquets can no way merit the name of love, but rather mere
dissimulation, sturring I know not by what motion, whose continuance is not
long: I can make no reckening of that woman, who seeing her poor friend
endure extreme passions of love for her sake, will sometimes embrace him, to
draw him the rather within her nets, and then upon the sudden will turn
the cart against the horse, and not vouchsafe one look of favor upon him: For
my part much less yt I can commend this order seeing, if I were allowed
president in that cause (as Phylopolo would have erst established me) her
cruelty should be punished with a continuance of banishment from the society
of all honest Ladies: I cannot deny for all this, that sometimes we shall not
be constrained to receive such troubles in love, as it is possible then to
entertain our Ladies or friends as we were wont, but in that we ought to be
ignorant, and much loss proceed by any artificial policy, the sooner to
give them a Be to buze withal) but rather by a certain natural instinct
sturred up of an extreme love under the which are comprehended fear and
sorrow: Thus much I hold (Gentlemen) against the opinion of such, as rashly
pretend inequality in love, which I can never admit and much less allow that
the woman be called mystresse of the man, unless in like sort, he be in deed
the peaceable possessor and Lord of the heart of his Lady: maintaining also by
the same (contrary to Phylopolo) that it is no more lawful to the man than to
the woman, under color of my fond opinion, conceived amongst men to
communicate themselves in many places: Indeed (Madam quod I) you may well
call it opinion, but not nature how soever the common sort esteem of it,
wherein (for a better declaration) I wish Phylopolo, to look upon Solon a true
follower of nature, who by his law^s (as one in this company did erst affirm)
made lawful to the wife, not having mean to conceive by her husband, to
procure her generation by other helps, and yet you say it is a natural thing,
that the woman participate not but with one only: if I should aleage unto you
the cuntrie of Cipres, wherein maids win their dowries by the sweat of their
bodies, would you hold our custom to be more founded upon nature than that:
yea if I should bring forth Plato, in whose common wealth was suffered a
community of women, would you not assure your saying upon worldelye opinion,
seeing that great Philosopher thought he ruled himself altogether by the
reasons of nature I like not of that law says the Lady (by reason of the
confusion of children (as being not able to be discerned in this quality) no
more than the request of the good matrones of Rome in the time of Papyrius,
pretending to have two husbands, for such sought to much to satisfy their
disordinat lusts: yet you saw (says Phylopolo) with what oportunities these
good dames enforced their suit to the Senate, and I doubt they would not have
been contented with two husbands, but abusing that liberty would at length
have fallen into the vice of all those women which passed through the hands of
those two erraunt Knights Astolphe, and Ioconde represented within that
excellent Italyan Homer Arioste: herein you are disceyued (says Chariclea) for
if all those Ladies had been stricken with such love as we speak of, they
had never fallen, and in mine opinion, we find more felicity in one frinde
simply and truly affected, than in a number others, whose loves be either
ordinarye, or for necessity, wherein what better example can I aleage that out
of the place you speak of, for the same Astolphe and Ioconde chose in the end
one Lady to content them both, and yet a little quidam, who before had gaged
the vessel of love to them both, notwithstanding their precise heed, did
cut the grass from under their feet, the same because love by this former
ambushe, had given him a first conquest there: But as these examples do not
touch me in care, so are they also out of the course of my first argument,
which tenden only to this end, that as I would not allow to a woman
liberty of communion with every one, so that I would not also have you to
think that the same is caused more by a natural reason (wherein you may
establish some advantage to our prejudice) than by a bounty and sincerity of
heart, which guiding us thereunto, in time does so settle in the hearts of most
men, that if we offer to withstand it, they make it a matter of sinister
ymputation to us: albeit in deed the act it self there is neither cause of
discredit nor reason of such disaduauntage as you pretend, but rather it
includes matter of honor and commodity to our honest meanings: in deed Madame
says Glaphyro, it can not but give you a singular value of honor. But for my
part, I believe that law was never erected, but to our great confusion,
neither do I see any other cause why a woman should be embrased or counted by
so many honest personages, and not attain to the sweet use of their
pleasant attemptes, but the tyranny of this wicked law, raised (as it
seems) in despite both of man and woman: because the woman fearing the note of
dishonor, by the world, dares not perform the last act of the league: but
by wonderful policy: hear Phylopolo stood still upon the iustructions of
nature, and that we were not directed by man's ordinance, wherein he laid the
examples of beasts, amongst whom, notwithstanding the long pursuit of the
male to his mate, yet is she hardlye brought to obey his will: by whom (says
he) we may be taught, that the woman ought not to be so familiar that way as
the man: This is but a voluble fancy (says Charyclea) and rather an error by
ignorance, then a true judgment of the property of beasts, of whom the
example of the turtle is against you, in whom (be he male, or be she female)
is suffered no singular prorogatiue one above an other: wherewith the Lady
retired to silence, not as weary with any long speech, but (as it seemed)
because Phylopolo in an inreuerent lightness, intercepted her further
discourse, a thing no less displeasaunt to the whole fellowship, then
singulerly grievous to me, who, wondering at the ready shift of learning in
this Lady, could not but say in my self, oh singular wit, not common to women,
oh deep judgment aspyring supernaturally, oh modesty worthy of the subject
wherein thou abydest* oh woman no way imperfect, by this do thou make known
(notwithstanding the malicious murmr of the world) the nobylitie of thy
mind, by which thou do not only enoble all thy sex, but also defacest that
little worthynesse, which remained to us: And albeit, during this whole
discourse, I meant not to play other part, then to discharge the office of a
faithful Secretorie to so honorable a company, yet according to my desire to
do good to my power, (in this opportunity of matter and place) but call all
you dear damsels standing in the profession of honor and virtue, to behold
as in a glass the conversation of my Charyclea, whose example I wish might
lead you in no less modesty of behavior, then by her discourses, I wish
you drawn to a desire of equal knowledge: And yet, I doubt not but some will
be esteemed evil employed (as in respect of the majesty of her presence and
chaste honor to her sex) to be the first raysers of the speech and talk
uttered in the favor of love: to whom I answer for her, that it is no less
commendable to seek out the true property of love, wherein nature, even from
the beginning of our age, has hid within us a secret instruction: then by a
dissembled art, to be guyded and taught by an Orator or Physician, who in
times past have been driven out of common wealths, the one for corrupting the
bodies, the other for infecting the minds and manners of men: where love being
imprinted in us, by so excellent a mistress and workewoman, has had always
an Empire over us: by him the world had his being, and in him it has
multiplied: and by him even trees and other insensible things seem to take
their increase one of an other: so that right necessary and noble is the
desire of my Charyclea, to seek out his condition and nature: And for mine
own part, having thus enregistred their reasons, I hope that no one man will
turn that to a singular vice in me, by which all men receive a common profit,
or at least an honest pleasure, but me thinks, I hear such as know me not,
challenge this exercise as inconvenient to the state of my profession, to whom
(if they will not satisfy with the honesty of my meaning) I answer, that
albeit, it be indecent to my faculty, yet not impertynent to my years, who,
before their time are loath to participate with old age: And hear, I put my
self of the beadroll of the happiest crewe in the world, seeing it is the
pleasure of the mighty God of love, to chose me for one of his, to the end to
instruct and acquaint me with his arms, which hereafter will be more
intolerable to me, than if he had called me to his train, when either by age
or other needful occasions, I should be less apt to attend him: And herein
(good Ladies) you may believe me, (as one to whom untrue reports are hateful)
that such is the strange and haggarde nature of love, that if we defy him in
our tender years, he will punish our old age with such sharp passions and
plagues of his power, that (in the common gase and skoffe of the world) he will
bring us at last to march under his banner: being on the other side of such
compassion and just consideration, that if he have entertained and nousseled
from his youth a good and loyal servant, and knowing him to be settled in some
state of persite rypenesse (according to the manner of old souldyours, whom
their common wealth after many good services, does make free from all charges
of war) he gyues us some release and consolation, as not to match his tyranny
with the judgment of the people, who if they had not proved him, may one day
run under a smarting experience: wherein lastly, I beseech that God by whom
I was first moved to employe my Pen in these exercises, that if any crabbed
Saturnus, chance to steal a pyll of his confection, that he may find it of
hard digestion, and so to my Champions, whose most speech (if I be not
deceived) gathered always to this point of loyalty, which Phylopolo would not
should be so requisite in the man as in the woman: by which occasion Charylea
in waspishe terms wished him one day to fall upon a wife in whom in stead
of mercy, he should find a mind equal to this merit: I hope (Madame) says
Phylopolo, your words are without meaning of curse, or at least your curse
not to carry such enchauntment as you wish me, but in his am I best contented,
that being at liberty, I mean never to come in bonds: because I have always
dwelt in this opinion, that as it is a thing impossible to make of a common, a
particular, so if a woman once corrupt her bonds of honor with prostitution of
her body to one, she may use the like liberty of favor to another, then to
a third, and so become general: ah says Monophylo (to whom this judgment
was most hateful) God forbid that in my presence I suffer you so inaduisedly
to blaspheme against the truth: how mean you ( seigneur Phylopolo) to make of
a common, a peculiar, the same being the common error of the people, who think
to sacrifice love by that only reason: as though it were impossible that
loyalty could abide in the brain of a woman, in which who would allege to
you infinite honest Ladies (wherewith the hystories do infinitely swarm) that
have consecrated their honor to one saint, I think you would either hold the
authorities false or such women for monstrous: yea, you would esteem them
rare monsters, as never proouing the virtue of women otherwise then by the
report of the world, which for the most part is malicious: But for such in
whom experience has planted an upright judgment, they will rather repose a
resolute loyalty in their Ladies, than once presume of suspicion of treason:
And yet your argument is to weak to reuerse true love, seeing if my heart be
already settled in one place, there follows not by that reason any duty of
division into diverse places: But of the contrary, because naturally it
inclines to one, me thinks the same should be a sufficient bar against all
other, as having imprinted within it this true love, whereof we spoke even
now: yea, this degree of pryoritie (as I think) is the only cause, why we
see at this day so many poor suffering lovers not to atchiue, the happy plot
of their intentes because indiscreetelye they dressed their vows and
offeringes to Ladies, who before were consecrated to other saints: To avoid
this danger (says Phylopolo) I say as before, a pleasant liberty, is a
precious price, and by so much the dearer to me, by how much my nature is
impacient, being denied what I demand, and therefore if I be enforced to make
love, I will either angle with an enchaunted hook, or at least fish in that
stream which will give me no cause of complaint: This is your liberty of
speech (answers Monophylo) by which you reveal your natural ignorance in
love, as the fond man, in his own brain ymagines he may dispose all the
world: you will not love, you say, otherwise than in an imperial respect to
choose and command: I would to God the choice were in our powers, or our
discressio^ hable to moderate our authority: defy not that, seigneur
Phylopolo, whereunto we are drawn by nature and destiny, seeing when you
account you most free from the motions of love, you shall find your self most
forced with his violence, and so sharply persecuted, that (in dispite of your
wanton resistaunce) you shall be enjoined to do smarting penance for the
blasphemy, which now (without advise) you maintain, as either to like
loathsomely, to love desperatelye, to choose unadvisedly, to possess Ielously,
to live poorly, or to hate extreemelye: of all these says Phylopolo, the
greatest plague is to love and not be encountered, seeing in our lyking, we have
reason and judgment, before we choose, we either know or enquire: in our
love we have temperaunce to avoid iealowsye, touching our state, we stand
upon Gods providence: and to hate is improper to a man of reason, without great
cause: so that next to desperation, in love, a loathsome mate is the second
infelicitie, which I doubt not to avoid by the help of nature who draws us
all to desire the fair and leave the foul: But take heed says Monophylo,
least seeking to enter into the rules of Philosophy, you stumble not upon
Thequiuox for I never as yet heard of lover, who esteemed not his Lady fair,
wherein notwithstanding there is a singularity in fayrenesse, and some ladies
of greater beawtie than others, yet, we see the silly heardeman or poor
Peasaunt, would not leave his preatie Katie for the fairest Lady in the
realm: and why? because in her he has laid up his heart, and she (in his
rural fancy) appears more contenting fair, than all the dainetie dames of
the train. And yet perhaps he is no less studious in beawtie than you, but
his mind being fixed in one place by an opinion which he has conceived of the
party (as of late seigneur Pasquier well approved) albeit in her do rest all
the inciuilitie and rudeness of the world, yet he consters her and her
quality to a singular wise and seemly behavior: wherein what better example
can I prefer then out of Angeliqua figured within Arioste in his book of
Furius: she, who had been beloved courted, and pursued by numbers of the best
knights of the world, without using any mercy upon them, in the end when she
thought her self most free from passion, it was then she felt her self so
deeply inclined in affection to a mean soldier (not comparable to the least
of the other) that even in her was forced the office and endeavor of the man,
which is to require and demand: here Phylopolo, desired him to pass no
further in that example, least (says he) you blind us all with that which
erst you doubted in me, which is Thequiuox. For by the nature of your present
example, the author of Furius sekes to teach us no other thing then that the
natural inclination of a woman, is not (with the man to choose the better, but
(as children) address themselves always to the worsse as we see the she
Woolfe, who amongst the whole troop of Woolues, does commonly make her
singular choice, of him in whom appears least likeyhoode of ability to
satisfy her appetite: even so the experience is common in many women, who
rather then they will yield to the honest friendeshippe of some worthy man,
will dissimule to be a Penelope, but having the place and opportunity free from
danger, they will not stick to enter foul conversation with a foul grome of
the stable or some loathsome Skullion of the kitchen, so that if (as touching
the only regard of women) you judge with me in this sort of this
inclination and opinion, whereof you speak so much, I am of your side, but
otherwise not: you shall pardon me (sir) says Monophylo, if at so dear a
prise you hold your society in judgment, seeing of an infected ^ier, cannot
come but a corrupt gain, and where the consent is bought, the matter cannot
escape dishonest incredulity: but touching your comparison of the Woolfe with
the woman, you are either a sworn enemy to women, ^r else ignorant in the
secret nature of the Woolfe, in whom (under correction) above all other
creatures, is directlye discerned a most full and familier instruction to love,
and to whose example we ought chiefly to apply the manner and measure of our
affection (if the same were in our power) for such is the condition of the she
Woolfe, that being pursued by many dog Woolues, chooses out of infinite
numbers the most lean and evil favored amongst them, even he which first
began to follow her when she entered into her heat, and who by a weary pursuit
and infinite labors is so mortified for her, that to recompense his deformity
proceeding for her sake, she seems to receive him before all the reast, as
having above the reast, best deserved: whose manner I wish might stand in
example to certain Dames, to whom the martyrdom of a poor afflicted lover
is a singular felicity: a thing (in my judgment) so abominable to God and
men, as I think the heavens close their gates, and the earth vomits curses
against such unnatural in iniquity. And yet (Madam) I may wrongfully lay this
fault upon them, seeing they have to allege the supremacy of Cupido, who
only lies in ambushe to steal our hearts, to the end that leading them in
his authority, he may dispose them at his pleasure: For so does this little
Godde entangle himself with our doings, by whom all Ladies falling into such
inconvenience, are dispensed withal, and the whole guilt laid upon him, who
(unawares to us wretches) infectes the best and soundest parts in us, without
any liberty of health but such and in whom it pleases him to grant it: This
is the cause why the auncientes made him an archer without eyes, as having no
respect to the qualities of persons, does oftentimes dazell our sight, and
blind our senses, that without any consideration, we translate our hearts to
such as the common people (murmuring at our destiny) holds unworthy of us,
who as blind judges, lay the fault to our own mocion and clear this little
invisible thief, by whose trains our hearts are betrayed: and yet seigneur
Phylopolo, if some few mistreses chance to fall into that inconvenience, God
defend that either in their example or judgment should be comprehended a
generality of women, as you seem to maintain, which if it should be so,
into this common error should we fall, to think that never manne of honor
and value was beloved of a woman, but such only as deserved the names of
villains, then many hundred thousand gentlemen were never beloved, then men of
noble and high attempts were never esteemed, yea then any sort of people in
whom nature had planted a value of mind, have been dissembled withal which
is not only vnlikelye in common reason, but altogether untrue in familiar and
common proof. And yet I will not deny that many valiant and noble knights,
yea even the very Peragons of a kingdom, may not sometimes and in some places
bestow their love in vain, and even so again without long or many matches
receive a pleasant reward of their painful merits: the same lot or
destiny being altogether governed by that little god Cupid, who in his quiver
does carry two sorts of arrows whereof the one is tipped with gold to molyfie
and allure the hearts of his subjects, and the other dipped in lead, to
harden the hearts of such to whom we pretend most affection: by which fiction
I find no other signification, then that the one feels himself in a mocion
stricken with desire of a thing which he sees in the other: the same by a
certain secret instinct drawing him unto him, and in the other I can discern
nothing by which he may cleave to his love: Here you have prevented me, says
Glaphyro, for that (according to my promise) I had prepared fresh charge for
you as to reuerse your opinion, that love is not kindled but by a certain
thing, which you could not well express, wherein I had thought to have
contended with you bythe authority of certain old Philosophers, who hold
that love dependes not but upon a certain desire of beauty: wherewith he
directed his speech and countenance to me, as to whom (as he said) this
cause did most duly appertain: seeing as in my difinicion of love, he charged
me to have given that nature: so having set forth a large and general
purtraict of him, it belonged to me also to dissipher at full his several
qualities: But I told him this season of after dinner was due only to him
wishing him to remember the felicity that fortune had purchased for him as to
have conquered the favor of her, who stands as judge over our exercises: in
whom (happy Monophylo quod I) you need doubt no favor to hear, nor delay
in judgment, seeing I fear she will entangle his estate of a judge, with the
office of an advocate to defend you: God forgive you seigneur Pasquire says
Charyclea, the goodness of any cause is a judgment in it self, so that you
need not be jealous of my inclination to Monophylo, whom I take to be of that
merit, as I can not think my self deceived if I bear him favor: ah good
Madam answers Monophylo, that the effect of this friendeshippe which you
pretend to bear me, might be reserved for mine absence, seeing I doubt not
so to moderate the present season and ooportunitie, as if you find want of
duty in action, you shall not fail of ready good will, which only is in my
power to perform, which if it be not so much as I ought, and you look for,
at least I hope you will satisfy in my good meaning But to draw Glaphyro out
of suspense, seeing seigneur Pasquire seems to fear the touch, I am content
to answer him in the point of beauty whereof he thinks love to take his
beginning, and not that instinct which you have preferred: albeit, before we
wade further, I pray you let us have your fancy how and in what sort you
understand this beauty: I am consent says Glaphyro, and to lead you to a
more subtle and true sense of it, you have to note that beauty lies not
altogether in the body, but has also her residence in the parts of the
mind: the one is called beauty simply, and the other good behavior, which
consistes not only in good manners and outward fashions of conversation, but
also has a special perticipation with virtue, even as the beauty of the
body restes not altogether in the lineamentes and feature of the face, but
also in a good composition and universal proporcion of all the other parts of
the body: And thus beauty being understood as it is by this short and true
signification, my opinion is that the very first day wherein we are betrayed
by love we feel a certain spark of this beautye which is in our Ladies, a
thing which afterward by succession of time setles so in us that with our
ignorant confusion to all other respects we come even to loase the knowledge
of our selves: wherein as there is diversity of beauties, so also every one
enclining according to his particular fancy, some delights in the properties
of the mind, other takes pleasure in the personage, to some the state and
majesty of the countinaunce are a singular felicity, and to other, the
facility and promptness of speech, is the only cause to kindle affection,
but above all, the eye has a supreme power, about the which the little Cupid
flies and fleetes in ten thousand sorts and shapes: By this I persuade we
delight not in foul things, neither can any be allured to love her, in whom
is a want of all, these qualities, so that as an imperfect and counterfeit
woman cannot set her self forth with cause to be beloved, so I think she is
exempted from all fortune and favor of any to honor her as a mistress in
love: this is the point in which I tarried for you (says Monophylo) seeing by
your talk you seem to establishe certain kinds of beauty, a thing
notwithstanding, not to be done in deed, I cannot but consent with you, that
every one pretendes to the fairest, but in case of love, to hold that one
thing ought to be fairer then an other, is a manifest error: seeing every
woman ingenerall, finds a friend to endure loss passions for her sake, than
may happen to any special lover on the behalf of some singular Lady more
fair and perfect than she, and if your opinion should challenge place of a law,
we might say that only she is honored with servants in love, to whom is
allotted by nature a singularity in one of these proportions you speak of, and
the more she is endued with them, the more does she make her self to merit
in the fancy of men, although we se the contrary in every success of time:
wherein let us make an example by two Gentlewomen, whereof the one by common
judgment is thought to be singularly fair, and to the other is given a
comendation of mean or indifferent beauty: if we be enticed (as you say) by
this beawtie, it is likely we should rather incline to the singular beauty,
than to ye other: albeit we prove often times the contrary, seeing love (to
make known unto men his invincible authority) will as often pitche his aboade
in her of mean and indifferent beauty, as in the other to whom nature seems
to have given a singular perfection: But for a more familyar example, I pray
you seigneur Glaphyro look into the choice of one of your old companions, and
my ancient friend, and tell me, what variety or shift of wit, what shape
of personage, what notable enamell of complexion or favor, what sweet
delivery of speech, yea, what favor of nature above her common regard to
all ordinary women, has she for whom as you know our friend labors in no
small torment of body and mind: sometimes (in an ydolatrous regard to her)
he blasphemes openly all other women, as not to hold value and comparison with
her, in whom (if love be to be measured by that beauty you speak of) there
is no one spark or part of such perfection: sometimes again he sets her in
his mind as an oracle or Goddess of contemplacion, raising her even unto the
highest heavens, with hymns and praises, drawing her excellencies into parts,
and (as it were with a pensell) leaving no part untouched with high reverence
and devotion: But if either you or I should be called to judge of this
Goddess, and her excellency, I fear we would note more folly in her friend,
than worthiness in her to deserve his affection: So that what other thing
causes this fairness in her, if not the instinct we speak of, which has
drawn this our friend to such an extremity in conceyt, that he esteems his
mistress to be even beauty her self: And so feigneur Glaphyro you see how we
aspire to this fayrenesse, and beauty, also being no other thing then as we
are guided by our natural inclinations, such inclinations, by infallible
consequence must needs be the very motions and causers of love: For to hold
(as many pretend) that the excellency of the eye consistes either in green or
black, or the talle or mean personage: to be esteemed one above an other, be
notable abuses moving of the affections which we bear more to one than to an
other, whom because we esteem so we would that every one would consent
with us in will and fancy: wherein to give you my plain judgment after long
and much confusion in my self, with no less perplexity to judge and discern
this difference, I swear unto you, I stand in indifferent doubt whether
beauty be the moouer of love, or our affections kindle by that which seems
fair unto us: But because only that thing that is fair does best please and
agree with us, I must needs say, that the perfection in love, is the only
mean that makes some things appear more fair to us then others: as for
example, there was never father, who in his own fancy found not his own
children fairest, albeit in common judgment nature had made them imperfect:
what other thing draws him to this persuasion of beauty in his children, but
love, yea that love whereunto only nature without other cause, does lead and
induce him: the like may we consider in our Ladies, observing always the
suggestion of our instinct, by the which we both love our Mystresses, and hold
them in a value of beauty above all others, yea, far otherwise then the
father does by his child, for that when by a long absence, not acknowledging
himself as son, the affection of the father will decay and convert into a
common estimation, where even at the first, and as often as we settle our eyes
upon our Ladies, we feel such a translation of affection, that it is without
our power to resolve what mooues us to love them: yea though they had in them
all degrees of deformity, yet by this instinct, their carectes and images
would settle so suerlye in us, that in despite of us, we should both love them
and esteem them the perfitest creatures in the world: hear you seem (says
Phylopolo) to figure unto us a love, resting rather in ymagination, then in
truth? yet methinkes it stands with congruent necessity, that there should
be something which should be called fair, and the same to consist in the pure
truth, and not in the opinion of men, as you seem to maintain: I have in
deed maintained it, and still will defend it (answers Monophylo) so long
as I live: Not that I mean to deny you that there is not something which in
it self ought to be called fair, but if there be, I say it is the only
creator which has knowledge of it: who albeit by his dear grace, do make
distribution of some sparks of it to men, yet think not ( seigneur Phylopolo)
that it is in us to know it: we can not but confess with one voice that in
all things there is one truth, but what is he who durst assure himself at
any time to have found it, but only God, who seems to reserve it in
himself, as meaning that, that title and name should only remain to him and
to none other: and such has been our punishment, since the offense of the
first man, that from thence hitherunto, it has continued as a matter of
continual succession from the father to the son: For where our nature before
was perfect and not corrupt, nor blasted with such whirlewindes as we are now
driven to feel, yea, being bounty it self and standing (as it were) in a
state of most pure innocencye: since declining by this delight to corruption,
keeping notwithstanding some sparckeling memory of her former felicity, there
remains only an appetite to enter into it again, that is to seek to aspire
and pearce into this bounty and beauty (which have a society together) and
yet of our selves we are never hable to attain thereunto: the same perhaps
being the cause why certain notable personages, sought in old time to usurp
the state of Philosophers, and not to bear the name of wisemen, professing
only to be zealors and seachers of wisdom which they could never find
(notwithstanding) by all their subtle Sillogismoes, but speaking generally of
that high benifit (whereunto we all pretend) they disputed severally every one
according to his particular fancy. So that if you ask me who has ever
possessed it, I must answer with the divine, that only he has pierced into
it, who (acknowledging the incomprehensible estate of God) confesses by an
extreme faith not to be able to reach the knowledge of this high science,
which lies only in the hands of the sovereign eternal: For albeit nature
has made us pertakers of a soul reasonable in it self, to study to know
the truth, yet she has sprinkled her with passions which greatly hinder her
heavenly exercises: The ancient Platonistes were of opinion that our soul
occupied in us two seats or places, whereof the one they bestowed in the
brain, which is reason, and the other they say possesses the inferior parts,
which they name lust or desire: wherein albeit that which occupies the parts
more noble, ought to assist the other, as being most wise and forseeing, yet
(such is our share and part with this massy earth) being tickled by their
flattering and deceitful passions, communicating with them her secrets and (as
it were) conspiring secretly against her, submittes her self oftentimes to
their mercy to her great confusion: For example, who ought to have been more
deuested of all human passion than our original father Adam, being in his
innocence, seeing our mortal nature was as then in his most great perfection:
and yet was not he rather over ruled by concupiscence then guided by reason,
when in an ambicious humor, he rebelled against the will of God: But if we
distende more familiarly: by what other effect I pray you are we divided from
beasts, but by this reason only, which (notwithstanding) we see so abused in
thousands of men, that they seem to partake more with beasts than with
humanity, wherein what better testimony can we produce than the doings of
wisemen, and such as are enraged and replenished with fury in whom
notwithstanding that lust or desire never failed, which kepes residence in us
all, which makes me think that when this mighty and general architector began
to fashion man, he framed him divided, as it were half divine and half
brutish, so that, as he would not make him altogether ignorant in things
passed, nor directly to foresee chances to come, so he intercepted him to fly
with the wings of his mind to ye consideration concerning only himself,
which is the knowledge of the truth, but seems contented only with our faith
and credulity: And so in the matter of beauty, we need not much to marvel
if our judgment waver, seeing it happens in all other human actions, which I
think proceeds by the great providence of God (yea even in the matter of our
present question) because such women as of certain are esteemed foul, seem
sufficiently fair to others, as not to be wholly abandoned being as necessary
for the increase of the world, as those that stand in a greater estimation of
beauty: And yet we must think that although in this opinion love makes
himself common with all other things of the world, yet he contains a
certain nature in himself, by which he is made altogether heavenly: For
except this general league of policy, which proceeds of the unity of our
hearts (whereof I will not now speak) I have always learned of such as
imagined the heavenly felicity, that the contentment that most we found in
this supernall region, is a perpetual contemplation of this divine essence,
which makes us forget our selves: wherein albeit I ought not to apply so high
a similitude to the subject we speak of, yet if we be suffered to imprint in
our hearts an image of that divinity, I may well say, that the impression we
have of the forms and figures of our Ladies, does so rauishe us in them, that
by them we do not only hold all the joys of the world as transitory, but
also they take from us the knowledge of the very cause why we love, as being
rapt in wonder in them, even as by a dilligent beholding the sun, we loase
the natural light of our own eyes: I consent to all you say (says Glaphyro)
confessing withal, that as by the imbecilitie of our senses, it is not lawful
for us to fly or aspire to this truth, so I believe also that it is the only
cause of the diversity of laws altogether contrary in diverse places. And yet
you cannot deny to me, that in the question of beauty, there be not things,
which by common consent of the world, are not allowed most fair: as who in a
self obstinate fancy will give unto the crooked and wrinckled a more
singularity in beauty, then those whom nature has created upright and
perfect has (in mine opinion) no less mayme in his sight, then imperfection
of reason and judgment. I speak not of monsters (says Monophylo) but of
things common and indifferent: for seeing nature has created us all upright,
I will not entangle our question with such sort of people as you speak of,
affirming that in what proportion so ever we are framed, if we procure to our
selves no other defect of members then according to Gods general distribution,
we are a substance sufficient enough to be beloved: Because all other
accidents happening, appear not to us, either fair or foul, but according to
the diversity of our humors which lead us to that opinion: yea, we persuade
often times a thing to seem fair in some season which in an other appears
foul and loathsome: So that seigneur Glaphyro, if this generality vary
according to the diversity of times, let us not think strange if our minds
(in the same respect) differ perticulerly: wherein touching women on whom your
late speech did run, I can hardelye believe, that in this variety of
opinions, they find not some friend in affection, albeit not so commonly as
others, because they are further estraunged from our common nature: herein you
are both deceived (says Phylopolo) for nature never created thing so rare, but
for admiration: And albeit (in regard of their bodies, such women are not so
generally delitefull to us, yet they have always a help of the mind to
satisfy that default: for God was never so niggardly bent to any, but if he
raised an imperfite body, he supplied it with some inward excellency of
mind: as in the nature of insensible things, we have an example of the Vine,
who albeit seems most crooked and counterfeyt of all other sorts of wood,
yet he contaynes even in his succeeding effects the spirit and mind of us
men: This is somewhat to purpose for you (says the Lady) and albeit you had
used no other speech at all, yet by these last words you should have been
dispensed with all, touching all your blasphemies, wherein all this afternoon
you have taken your voluntary pleasure: beseehing you all my Gentlemen and
dear friends, to suffer this last speech of Phylopolo to cloase up our long
question of love, wherein Monophylo seems to challenge a singular triumph: who
least he should over ween in himself, I think it is not impertinent so to
moderate the state of his prosperity, as by our mean, he hoyse not sail
above our power, to embase it by discresion: wherein I hold opinion with an
ancient Captain of Athens, who being asked, if he took not pleasure to
learn the art of memory: no rather (says he) I delight in the art of
forgetfulness, because (in his judgment) he preserved well all things in
his mind, which (being learned) he forgot not: But above all, if a thing once
engraued in us, cannot be defaced without great pain, love only once rooted in
our hearts, is most hardly, yea impossible, drawn from us by any human art
or pollysie: and therefore I hold it no less necessary to learn the means
to eschew such a place, then profitable to know the causes for the which we
enter into it: A small perswation (Madam says Glaphyro) would draw me to
your opinion, but let us take heed least offering to make a road or invasion
upon love, the night charge us not behind, whose darcke ministers may do us
more harm, than any way we can grieve him, upon whom we have made this war,
and therefore (Madam) as the present season requires, it were better to make a
safe retraict, than a perilous follye, under this charge notwithstanding, if
the company so like, to renew this war the next morning, when I doubt not
the pleasant dew, as the tears of Jupiter distilled will no less delight
us, than the Sun has specially favored our exercise this afternoon: And so
this little band of amorous soldiers fearing the swift approach of the night,
and finding withal a necessary appetite to relieve their bodies, as well as
their minds were delighted with pleasant discourse, approved the counsel
of Glaphyro and also his condition of return the next morning, which they
performed as you may hear.

The second Book of Monophylo.
THat was (truly) a lawdable custom and most familiar with the Fathers of
old time, who, by how much they reposed a dignity in their works, by so much
were they curious to choose patrons of high condition, under whose authority
their endeavors might spread abroad. For which cause they consecrated both
their names and books to the Gods only and the Muses, as assuring the world
thereby, that the end whereunto they aspired rested not in any mortal pretense.
But in your opinion (Madame) if the world might become a Metamorphosis, and
all those great personages eftsoons return to life, would you not think
that as the complexcions of men be changed, so also generallye they would
alter custom, as leaving their Gods and Goddesses, to search out new
prot^ctors: and yet if we weigh with the condition of their age past, the
nature of the present season wherein we live, we shall find their time more
generally inclined to assist that custom of theirs, then any consideration at
all to follow our exercises, what virtue or variety of wit so ever they
contain: For as in their days (when gold and silver stood not in such
authority as now) he only was esteemed above the rest, whose virtue and
science gave best show of a singular well qualified mind. So being since fallen
into more extreme seasons, which favor not the faculty of good and excellent
wits unless they have a society with wealth and riches, it is not also to
be merueyled if such as have succeeded them in writing (aspiring even with
them to the self same point of ymortalitie) seek to reclaim Princes, to
whom (as to the high executors of Gods benefits) they make offer of the
fruits or best of their faculty, as (by such mean) to partake with their
high liberallities and bounties: By whose example we not only direct to
Princes and great men the greatest part of our works, but also even repose and
depend the value of our wits, upon their wills, as upon the only point and
ceinter, upon which all our thoughts do rest and hang: we find by faith of
Autentike writers what happy numbers of learned men flourished in Rome, in the
life o^ the Emperor Augustus the only macaenas for science in his time, and
of the contrary, how naked that profession grew when the Goths (enemies to
all Art and humanity) reigned over Italy: wherein Madam, enter not into
further wonder then the reason of the cause requires, seeing as every season
has her reuolutions, so no estate is exempt from the power of voluble time,
and naturallye we are all drawn to do good under a hope of honor, which
being not esteemed unless it be pricked full of the feathers of transitory
riches, every one (we see) applies himself to the good pleasure and service
of him, from whom he plucks profit and commodity: And yet I say, he cannot be
to highly recompensed, whose wit and pen as the painful handemaydes of
truth travel to set forth the accidents of time: seeing all the valiant
acts which we see stand upon the heads of great men cannot be raised into a
higher degree of fame, than by the mean of a pen well disposed to whom all
prescription of times has given this privilege, to embase the prowes of great
men, and raise the doings of the meaner sort at his pleasure, which was not
unknown to the great conqueror Alexander, when he lamented to be
disfurnished of such a trompet as fortune had stirred up for Achylles in the
person of Homer: By what other occasion (I pronounce it with reverence and
private grief) are our histories become seasoned with such small value and
estimation, if not by the slender care of our great Lords, who flattering
their time with other professions in their necligent regard to learning, take
away also all example or courage from all men that exercise their wits that
way: Kings give life unto wits, and the learned in counterchaunge crown
princes with ymortalitie: the travel of writers is a monument of perpetuity,
and the endeavor of the pen preserues memory above time: learning (as says
the Psalms) comfortes the afflicted soul, and gives aid to the frail
infirmities of the flesh: it rules between Prince and Prince, and directes
private causes of mean men: it is a testimony to the matter, and a judge to
the controversy which cannot be corrupted: yea, by learning we have
conversation even with God, and in writing he has left amongst us the words
of his infallible will, which being well observed, leads us (as the Prophet
says) above the heavens: But Oh miserable condition of our great men, who in
place to prefer learning, pluck away the means to preserve it, as in not
assisting the painful endeavors of writers, are unthankful even to the
benefits of God, whose providence they use unworthily, and are guilty in the
spoil of their own monumentes and eternity: For by how much God blesses our
age with men of quality and science (a constaunt sign of his care over us) by
so much it lies you in charge (you noble men and states of wealth) so to
govern this singular blessing, as neither the soil in the seed, nor the
seed in the fruit, be unthankfully used, least (with the plague of other
times) your monumentes be defaced and your names and actions run in a darcke
memory, as the eclipse of the Moon when she is barred from her natural
light: But Madam, amongst so many eloquent wits, albeit I iustlye esteem my
self inferior even to the woorst, as standing also less in the favor of
nature then they, yet, (with the Be that yeldes honnie for his house rent) I
must confess, that if ever any fruit went out of this little gardaine of
mine, you only have planted it: and as others aspire to Kings and Princes,
for whose delight they set aworke their wits, so I beseech you let it
be lawefull for me to name you the star by whose aspect I am led to
every well doing: protesting (for my part) to hold such a guide in no less
value and honor, then in times past the Muses upon whom the Poets bestowed
such solemn and devout inuocacions: you only (Madam) are the Goddess whom
I invoke, yea, the element wherein I live, and the oracle of all my plottes
and purposes, wherein I dare pretend no other benifite of you, then that which
even your self is able to promise in me: wherein albeit, all my works and
trauelles are directlye disposed to you, yet I dare not presume to present you
at this time with the exercise of this morning, nor yet the discourses chiefly
raised to our confusion: neither had I adventured to spread them abroad were
it not, that as the day before was employed in such felicity of mind as I
desired, so also I imagined such success and sequelle to our present
proceedings, that albeit, it import some sinister advantage to us, yet it may
bring such fruit to some other the assistantes and parties, that if they
grudged in the matter of the former exercises, this may be applied as a
recompense and supplye of their supposed injury, if an injury it may be
called: A thing so just and true, as was the discourse of our Monophylo,
altogether in the favor of love: and therefore in this treatise there is
reserved for them some satisfaction, but no contentment at all to me, who
stands not only to disalowe Chariclea, for whose respect these speeches were
first procured, and also Glaphyro by whom they are pronounced, but also I
mourmour even against my self, as to have used my pen in a subject, so
hateful to all equity and reason: wherein in common truth I confess my self
more imputable then all the rest, seeing that as to Chariclea is just cause of
pardon, as seeking (by a natural zeal to knowledge (common to all your other
Ladies) to comprehend all things from good to better: so Glaphyro, is
tolerable because he argued according to the suggestion of his thought: But
for mine own part I protest, if any thing be handled against the majesty of
that little God whose slave I am, it is altogether contrary to my opinion of
him, as being for this time settled in a certain hypocrisy, the better to
fulfill the plot of my determination: wherein as I may resemble those good and
ancient instructors, who leading us by their divine exhortacions to the
contempt of honor, prepare to themselves a ready pathwaye to an immortal
glory. So seeking to mortify in others by the speech and discourse of our
four Champions, the true roots of love, I shall kindle the sparks more and
more in my self, and with the Salymander bathe my limbs in the flames of hot
affection: aduertising you notwithstanding (Madam) that albeit they conspired
not only the overthrow of love, but also to reuerse me altogether, yet (such
is Gods ordinance) that there is infirmity in their pretense, and their
wicked will without force, as professing if you look into their dooinges)
rather words of threats, than matter of effect: so that I dare promise in my
self that love has the least cause to be offended: Assuring you for end,
that according to my delight in the discourses of Monophylo, I dare eftsoon
give him the honor of this days exercise with this last request (to you
Madam) to set down in memory his reasons with some of mine, as a rose amongst
a number of thorns. And so without further report of their several
circumstaunces, let us leave them ready to pursue the point of their purpose,
which was to fall into a second society the next morning in the place which
erst had yielded them such convenient favor: where according to the hour of
appointment, the whole fellowship being assembled, Phylopolo used his
accustomed liberty, and began to make court to the Lady Chariclea, not with
speeches of cyuill and honest regard, as is the use of all men professing the
state of honor, but offered to touch her indecentlye, yea, even to lay his
hand upon the place which stands in curious charge to al women of careful
behavior, when the Lady more misliking his rashness, then fearing her own
weakness, gave him this modest cheke, if seigneur Phylopolo you adventure to
offer me this wrong in respect of my familier conversation in this solitary
place under the hands of you four young Gentlemen, I hope to find defense in
the virtue of your faith, and assurance in the promise of seigneur Glaphyro,
under whose protection I began this enterprise yesterday, which if I eftsoons
put in practice this morning, methinkes I merit not imputation, but rather
that my disposition be more favored, and my honesty better assured by you,
upon whose safeconduct I repose even the estate of mine honor: Here ought to
be no cause of doubt (Madam says Glaphyro) where is no pretense of evil
dealing, and the faith of a Gentleman is the best warraunt he can give to
assure his behavior, wherein as we protest innocencye in thought and act, so
our hope is, you will not defile your discression with any corrupt judgment,
as to note us inciuill in that, wherein if we seemed insufficient in duty,
yet not unready in good will as far as belongs to the office of Gentlemen:
only your opinion to enter society with us shall not lose her expectation,
which I beseech you let lead you in such judgment of our behavior, as
(notwithstanding the wanton liberty of Phylopolo) you may use us in our
meaning of honor toward you, wherein it may please you eftsoons to settle
under the faith and promise of those to whom nothing is more dear then to do
you duty and service: I accept your conditions (says the Lady) and believe
your promise, albeit I could not otherways say of Phylopolo then I both
find and prove, which I entreated him to forbear, least he kindled occasion
of complaint, and to hold him less welcome to all honest company, ah Madam
says Phylopolo, how you challenge my liberty in speech, whereunto custom has
given a grace and name of modesty to others, though you make me guilty in
rude behavior: And if the exercise of yesterdaye was wholye consecrated to the
commemoration of love, what new offense can be enforced if you and I dress a
sacrifice to him by a reciprocal pleasure one of an other by which should be
made perfect the dedication of this place: which last words he pronounced with
such life in countenance, as they seemed plawsible to the whole company,
except the Lady, who dissembling her opinion of his meaning, told him she
had no other sacrifice to make with him, then that as the day before they
studied to erect, and set up the tabernacle of love, so now they would labor
to commit him to formentes and utter ruin: For so (says she) shall we offer
a goodlye and acceptable sacrifice and of far more merit, then the
supersticious oblations of the old ydol^tours for penance and satisfaction of
their sins: wherein I could wish the society of Aryadne by whose policy
the poor desperate Theseus found means to wind out such a Dedalus as
Monophylo has figured unto us: ah Madam quod I, how religious you are in
opinion, from which much less that the night, your absence, or change of
place, have taken any authority, but rather have added (as it seems) an
invincible force the better to establishe your fancy in the matters of our
conversation yesterdaye: yea who would have thought, that by your means and
counsel, our lover would have enforced the gates of so honest a prison, to
hope to settle himself eftsoons in liberty: Oh seigneur Pasquier says
Phylopolo, are you yet to know that torments can make men tell truth, and a
pinching sore cannot abide a smarting plaster: even so oftentimes the rude and
hard handeling which we find of our friends or Ladies, bringes occasion to
eschew their society, or at least to labor to avoid it: and yet I dare not
bring, Madam Chariclea, within the compass of that condition: whether she be
or not (says the Lady) I account you without commission to enquire, and my
self without reason to yield your reckoning: And yet I hope you will not note it
strange in me, if (according to the care I have over the state of poor
lovers, the same concurring with the nature of our present exercise) I use the
compassion of my sex and calling, to wish them rather a plawsible liberty,
then this darcke and hydeous prison, wherein I see them so martired: not that I
challenge any property in these speeches or that such matters resemble me above
the reast (as you think) But because I have dwelt always in this mind, that
notwithstanding the pleasures distending with love, is great in the highest
degree, in respect of other felicities, yea and without comparison: yet, in
common experience it comes not near the least part of the sorrows and
torments, which of it are nouzled and trained, as a thousand suspicions, ten
thousand ielowsies, with infinite distempered fears (the proper substitutes of
love) with whom (as rain in a mighty wind) is brought such passions and
panges, that to a man of sound judgment there seems no difference between
the laborinth of this endelesse traueyle, and the infernal gulphe which
continually castes up nothing but loathsome vapors and flames of sulphur. For
my part, I never knew lover favored with any hour or moment of happy time
which he bought not both before and after the act, at an unlawful price and
usury. For before he trauelles in a confusion with incertaintie of success,
as being not yet come to the assurance of his unbridled affections: and after
having got with charge, that which he keeps with care, he lives in fear to
loase what he hardelye holds: in deed the perfect lover, who stands assured
in his felicity, lives without the compass of those doubts: But whom may we
term this assured lover, yea, who can give unto himself, such certain
warraunt of the will of his Lady, as of his own faith and constancy: I spare
here to aleage unto you the speech of the people, which (for the single honor
of his mistress) h^e ought to satisfy: For if such be the malice of the
world now a days, as a simple conversation of a young man and a woman, does
draw people into opinion and suspicion, what travel of mind, and
inconvenience of policy is he tied unto, who being vowed to a mystresse, must
both supplye her will, and satisfy the popular speeches, seeing the nature of
love making men properly silent and sorrowful, serves here as a proper trumpet
to discover their passions: What make you hear also of a sharp repulse, after
a long suit, yea, how digest you a false report, whether of spite touching
your self to your mystresse, or of disdain of her to your self: Suer those
pills and ague fittes are of more bitter qualities, then all the pleasures
that can be ymagined in love, contain felicity, and albeit the joys be great
in number, and pleasant in condition, yet are they not without their
continual property of fretting melancholy. I could here enlarge further in
the ordinary accidents in love (whose number is no less infinite, then their
quality intolerable) and their actions most true in example, were not I
should do wrong to the experience of your other Gentlemen, whose practice
proves you in those affairs deep judgment only in my knowledge I never saw
or knew any one truly transfigured into the state of a perfect lover, on
whom (notwithstanding he had possessed the actual felicity in love) did not
attend inward perplexities, and outward disquietnesse, confused counsayles
and careless execution, broken speech and unsound judgments, yea, such a
general necligence in all his acts and conversation of life, that in a due
consideration of the effects of love in his example, it may be easily
discerned that there is more gall than honye, less pleasure then pain, far
more care care than commodity, and more want of courage, than any true
commendation of a noble mind. You are not far from the truth says Glaphyro,
and for that self cause certain ancient Philosophers feigned love to be borne
of Porus and Penius, as making him the son of abundance and penury, to
figure unto us, that lovers, in their greatest contentment, are notwithstanding
miserable, by a certain insatiable lust: yea even he that possesses, is never
absolutely contented, and that was the cause answered the Lady, why I would
wish this lover to find some issue in love, if it were to be found. Here
Monophylo the only protector of this little murderer, by whom moved all his
grief, I know not (Madam) says he, by what occasion you happen into these
terms: yea, I meruell so much the more, as I know your wisdom and high
discression to carry no small praise amongst men of judgment, and yet by the
manner and phrase of your speech you seem to resemble him, who for a small
transitory delight which he promised himself by the vewe of his mistress,
despised an imortalitie prepared for him by the Gods: this I say as seeing
you wish a lover to leave his profession for certain light disquiets of mind,
which being banished from him, you esteem him more then happy: But (good
Madam) what is he in whom this disease has not been incurable, or who has
ever been unfurnished of those passions, yea generally I ask, what state of
mortality has been ever so absolutely happy, on whom (in the greatest
delight of the world) has not attended some coffeehouse: I meruell that by
the same mean you desire not that children should not be borne, seeing the
more we love and esteem them above others, so much the more do they bring
unto us care and grief: do we not fear, desire, hope, and travel our bodies
and minds for their sakes: we desire to see them great, as then to become the
stay and comfort of our old age, wherein we employe no small diligence: we
fear their venterous youth, as not to fall into danger of body or infection
of mind by lewd conversation, and for that cause we provide tutors to
moderate their rashness: such is our torment and care of mind for them, that
we even feel the displeasures they suffer, and endure a share in their woes
and miseries: yea if we waighe in even ballaunce the greeues distending with
such as we bring into this world, with the pleasures we receive by them, we
shall hardly judge the difference and yet such is the vehement nature of our
affection, as it makes us forget the sorrow and trouble whereof they are the
cause: it is impossible that in matters by which we receive extreme
contentment, that sometimes also they turn us not to heavy greeues and
annoyes: what one thing in the world does more necessarilye delight us then
the fire, and yet by it we see stately cities and palaces reuersed and
consumed: who denies water to be most convenient for the necessitye of man, and
yet it is the element in which much people perish, and great treasure is
devoured. So that notwithstanding the perilous accidents happening by these
two elements, yet to hinder or take away their use, were to drive nature from
her course, and confuse the things of the world: even so is it of love, whose
profession you wish us to leave for certain light inconveniences accompanying
him by circumstaunce, and nothing considering the sovereign benifits which
secretly lie shrouded and hid within him, wherein to offer you familiarity
of experience, why wish you not in like sort, that we were not borne at all,
seeing that as being once entered into this world, our conversation runs
under infinite and intolerable miseries: even so our destiny caries this
condition that the higher we are raised into degrees of felicity, the redilier
we incline to revolution, and feel with more grief the pinching stinges of
displeasure: which (Madame) me thinks might draw you to a favorable
consideration of love, by whom if sometimes we are lifted into acts of high
and perfect pleasure, it is not out of reason if at other seasons he lead us in
effects of more hard and strange nature seeing that if at one time the
pleasure should be little even so at an other season, the displeasure could not
but be less, for so has God united and paysed the one with the other, as to
bridle our presumption in vaunting to be happy on all sides, and therefore he
does draw over our calm of pleasure and felicity, a darcke cloud of grief
and calamity: and yet our voluble pleasure is far more great without
comparison (in the respect of our present controversy) then the inward
greeues which we feel: for where the lamentable tears, the strayned sighs,
the broken sorrows, which oftentimes we pour out in love, are not enforced by
other occasion or mean, then as perticipating of our mortality, subject to
all infirmity and misery: the pleasures, on the other side which like sweet
honye distilles by his suggestion, lay us in resemblaunce with Aungelles, as
though in that contemplacion, we imparted with the heavenly powers, and to use
a direct truth, love would establish us (as it were) in a perfect felicity
upon earth, were not that his pleasant mocions be sometimes mingled with
certain light disquietes: Wherein may be discovered a great providence of
God, who (to lay before us our humanity) has tempered our delights with
pills of sorrow, and provided our river of transitory joy to run in a
stream of anguishe and grief: not that those small accurrauntes should
challenge such authority and force as, for them, it should be needful to
deuest our selves of so great beatitude: But it behooues, amid such distresses,
to prove the heart of a true and loyal lover, even as gold is tried in the
furnace, seeing that to whom so ever living continually nourished in
pleasures, such as either he would have or can wish for, without proof of
displeasure or grief, it is a hard experience to have a true taste of the
sweet fruit which the gardaine of such delights does yield: yea it stands
not with incongruent necessity (to make his taste and judgment more perfect)
to entangle his pleasures with some easy and light annoyes, like as to give a
good season to meat, is required not only sugar and sweet things, but also
some sharp spices (of quality, to be hardelye disgested) which applied and
tempered with other drugges, do give a good and perfect taste to that which
otherwise would carry no season at all: Ah seigneur Monophylo, says the
Lady, such is your force in speech and reasons to persuade, that I could
even settle in your opinion, were it not that for you alone over whom a
voluntary force holds the heavy yoke of love, there may be found
thousands and ten thousands, who bitterlye do wash their mouths in curses
and complaints, against the day and hour wherein they took first footing in
that miserable prison: yea, such is either their natural blindness, or
providence of destiny, that albeit they behold their own spoil and ruin,
yet the missery of their thrall estate holds so straight a hand upon them,
that neither force nor policy can deliver them, even like unto the Dear
entangled in nets, who the more he strives, the faster contendes he against
his delivery: Why has nature then, says Phylopolo (who valued lovers with
brute beasts) endued man with a soul of reason, as to divide him from
beastlye creatures, if he loasing the custom of reason, enter willingly into a
place, which afterward (without his great confusion) he cannot eschew: the
same resembling the condition of the silly bird (albeit more excusable) to
whom only belonges to complain of nature as taking from her all knowledge to
resist the sweet charm of the fowler, by whom if she escape death, she is
suer at least of captivity: where man drawing to himself, his self
destruction, without other power of remedy then to late a repentance wherein I
pray you, is he to be divided from other creatures, but only in the outward
eface under the which he covers his great beastelinesse: What sir answers
Charyclea, who here though good to cut of his jealous speech wished him not to
presume so far of his own felicity, seeing he had neither policy nor
special prerogative above others to avoid the mystery if the mischief fell
upon him: For says she, even as the experience is common that many Marinors
undertaking a long voyage, commit themselves to the sea under a show of fair
weather, smiling at the first upon them, albeit their hope being turned to
heaviness, they stand at last so deep in the danger of the tempest, that
(notwithstanding their endeavors) they are enforced to abandon their ship to
the mercy of the waves, without mean of remedy: even so stands it with our
lover, who oftentimes indiscreetlye, yea, when he thinks to sleep in most
safety, slippes into the charm of the intising eyes of some Lady, who leads
him with great delyght into this huge sea of love, where in the end he takes
a miserable comfort in to late a repentance: oh happy mariner so long as he
sailed under a favorable clymat, oh thrice happy lover, until his son
disguised his light: But oh wretched condition of both the one and other when a
contrary wind and common destiny castes them upon the sands of Charibde and
Sylla, monstrus women (with the Poets) whose custom is to change into form
of beasts, all such as unhappily rub upon their shore, when the poor lover
finds his pleasure translated into a quality of bitterness, and his hope so
turned into despair, that he has no other refuge then in death, and yet in
him he hardely finds medicine, what think you then of the authority of love
whose sweet baytes as they are swallowed up even by the most wise and subtle
that be: so he has also a second power, that having once made himself Lord
over us, he takes from us all knowledge both of himself and his nature,
bathing us (as it were) in a consuming flame, far less quencheable than the
continual fire of the hill of Cycylie, yea, such is the virtue of this
indissoluble knot of perfect love, that it is without power or mean to us
mortified: and that which worse is, it happens in often experience, that some
man laboring long in an amorous train with a Lady, and she perhaps no
less touched with the mocions and passions of love than he, yet in a
necessary regard to her honor, she is driven to answer his desire with
modesty, and dare not adventure to be thankful to his demand: I pray you
judge by your self (if his purpose pretend altogether to possess:) the
condition of this lover and the languishing panges that long suit sturres up:
yea, what medicine would you apply to his disease? I would not that for my
repulse he should alter the nature of his affection to his Lady, and much
less be necligent in his means of obedience and humility: But let us find
out some happy operation or droage, by which we may help to qualify his
passions, and yet not discontinue his love: for so shall we make lively in him
the pleasures which by ymagination he shall conceive of his mistress, and
utterly choke up those sorrows which else would devour him with infinite
deaths. Your discourse (quod I) contains matter of to high condition, as to
demand a thing that is not to be done, which is to love without passion: and
it is as easy to draw out of the four elements that Quintessence, from
whence the Philosophers derive the original of our souls, as to hope to
satisfy in any one respect your present desire, which albeit I cannot but
esteem of high merit, as proceeding from a mind so well affected to the
miserable estate of lovers: yet in all reason and experience I cannot hold it
less impossible that love should be without passion, then a man without a
soul, the Sun without light, fire without heat, and water without moisture:
which things as they are so natural and proper, as without them neither man,
Sun, fire, or water, can be in their particular: even so if you lead love in
his true degree, you shall never see him march without passions as his
familiar substitutes and companions: In which respect me thinks it were matter
much impertinent to dispute upon a form in our minds, which neither has been
nor can be: only let us apply our speech to things not impossible, least
with the loss of time, our exercise also bring forth nothing but vanity: And
touching your opinion that a woman making an estate to love, and yet will
maintain her honor (or at least that which she esteems her honor)
although in such a case it would be hard that love should ever bring forth
his full and absolute effect: yet in such proof I wish the example of the
amorous Poet might be remembered, that for two, three, or many repulses, he
must not think himself denied, but turning modesty into importunity,
solicit his Lady with increase of diligence and means: who albeit at the
first (under a light fear to make a wound in her honor) stands doubtful to
bequeth her self to our mercy: yet doubt you not but she trauelleth
inwardely in a singular felicity and joy of mind, to see her self sued and
required of him whom she honors most, and specially in a thing which she
would chiefelie desire, were it not for that strong bulwark and rampire of
shamefestnesse, which notwithstanding is not so defencible, but being battered
it may at the last become vincible by vehemency of love to whose power all
worldly forces are but weak: herein also, reason stands most peremptory
(specially in the present case that moves) because this honor consistes not
but in the opinion of men, and love is drawn altogether out of ye registers of
nature, by whom we are induced to it: wherein because you shall not judge
straungely of my opinion, I make you this resemblaunce: if our enemies become
affable by our humility, yea if brute beasts void of reasonable
consideration, be drawn to a familiar tamenesse, by our soft strokings and
alluerments, I pray you what belonges to him in duty, which holds us in
dear regard, which cherishes us, and who loves us no less then himself: do
you think a woman is not subject to love as much or more than a man? yea, even
to adventure upon things which are expreslye forbidden her: did not Byblys
love her brother, Mirrha her father, and poor Pasiphae was she not ravished
in lust with a Bull? And yet I think it was never hard that a woman (what
passion of love so ever possessed her) adventured to solicit or require, but
being governed with a certain shamefastness, would not so much as be
required, and yet being required would make no doubt to consent: and therefore
I have heard it often spoken of people well experienced in those exercises,
that the best is to be sparing in requiring, but in requiring, to use such an
honest boldness to s^ack the bridle of their passions that with impudency
they be not possessed of the thing which without shamefastness they ought not to
desire: whereof I make judges my masters of the spirituality, and lawyers
specially in these affairs wherein the speech, how covertly so ever it run,
is far more shamefaste and hard to digest then the effect: the same in my
opinion being the only mean to come to the full of their purpose, which
being well practiced, is seldom without his desired fruit: seeing (with
reverence I speak it) the number is very small (and they borne under an
unhappy star) whose love in the end has not happelye succeeded. Here
Phylopolo observing his oportunitye to molest women, allowing his reasons,
began in speech to justify them further: for (says he) if women were as
haggardlike as they seem, and as many poor fondelinges in love, full simply
do believe, their pomp and vanity would be less in attire, and themselves
not so Popingaye like in conversation, as now a days we see them: For who (I
pray you) has first brought in this caull or coronet of gold, more curious
than comely, more precious than necessary, for the modest attire of the head:
unless (with the old superstition) you would deck an artificial ydoll to
draw the world to vain worshipping: who devised this curling of hayr^, so
divided and laid into locks that it seems to carry precepts and proportion of
Art: who first invented this hooue, such a mask or veil for the face, that
it leads men in ymagination of a greater beawtie then is in deed, even as in
times past the papists, although (to enforce a more religion to their
pilgrims) they were curious to reveal their saint, yet, when the doors of
his shrine were disclosed, there apeared nothing but a counterfeyte image: for
what cause have they drawn to them of late suborned bodies either of horn or
wood according to the mind of the Carpenter: yea what other purpose is in
their huge vertingale, with infinite other vanities in their common attire, but
only to please men, and pleasing them, to be desired of them: yea what other
mystery is contained in these curiosities, then that they are invented as
helps and instruments to supplye the tongue, who either fear^^g, or shamefast
to exercise his office to require is for the ^ost part revealed by these
aluring ministers most famyli^^ in these times with most women. Be that as it
may be (quod I) and yet perhaps seigneur Phylopolo, you are either not well
informed in this matter, or to forward in judgment, seeing this curiosity
(as you term it) is allowed to women with more authority then you think.
For being created only for the aid and pleasure of man, it is like that God
sturs that opinion in her, to raise her into endeavor not to please her self,
but to give contentment to the eyes of him, for whose sake she was brought
into the world: as for example, is it not a tolerable behavior in a maid,
to prepare her beauty, the better to please those that pretend marriage to
her: the same being allowed by Licurgus in his common wealth, that maids
should go bare faced to the end they might be s^ene and desired: and by the
same mean the married wife laboreth to please not the populer sort, but her
husband to whom she is predestinate, it is written that the good Emperor
Augustus, seeing his daughter attired one day above her custom of modesty,
wherein albeit he took no delight, yet for the present, he governed his
judgment by silence, as attending a more fit season to warn her, whom when
he found an other time in habit more simple and convenient (as he thought)
for the condition of women: oh (says he) how far more seemelye is this attire
for the daughter of Augustus, then that which she ware the other day to the
disguising of nature, and deface of both our estates: to whom she answered,
and that with reverence rather to believe her reasons, then enter into wonder,
seeing (sir says she) I used my time to please the desire of my husband, and
now I stand to satysfie my duty to you: such was in effect the example of
the good Lady Esther, when she protested before God, that the sumptuous
atires which sometimes she used, carried no other purpose then to feed the
liking of that great king Assuerus, who had chosen her for his own: All this I
bring in (albeit as matter impertinent to our present purpose, yet occasioned
by you) to show how wrongfully women are charged with their sumptuous attire,
when both their estate requires it, and their husbands consent to it: For to
that, ought they to apply their fancy, and not to delight the eyes of
strangers, to whom as they owe but common regard so if they should fall from
the fancy of their husbands, to follow the wills of others, their fault
rather deserves punishment then rebuke: indeed I must hold a difference
between the order of the wyddowe, and manner of the married woman and maid,
seeing as she ought not to pretend further object of contentment, so, albeit
she feel stir in her a vehement desire and will to enter marriage again, yet
is she more acceptable both to God and the world, in her seemly and modest
simplicity: yea the tears of her wydowhead continuing a careful memory of
her dead husband, ought to serve her as an honest bridle to draw her from
pomp or vanity, whose example also I wish might direct the behauyour of the
married wife in the absence of her husband, seeing that living without him, she
ought also to lay a part all occasions to delight others. And why (says
Phylopolo) should not maids be as commendable in their modesty as wydowes.
Let us not I pray you disguyse or cloak their thought, seeing we live not at
this present in that commonwealth of Sparta, but are exercised in a time of
other manners and conditions of life: And yet howsoever you wrest the laws of
Lycurgus, you never found them to give liberty to maids (although they went
without vailes) to use this visor and mask of garments which now a days we
see in common custom: And to use a simple truth, if in such consideration of
marriage, such disguised garments should be practiced as you ( seigneur
pasquior) presume, were it not as hurtefull in example, as hateful in
sufferaunce, and most of all to be scoffed at in the parties themselves: seeing
that to a maid pretending to get a husband these confused attyres are but as
Popingay feathers pricked on a black Crow, which notwithstanding, when she
flies, do fall away with the wind: For as wisdom and honesty ought to be
the proper virtues in a maid, to allure the affection of a husband, so if by
art she seek rather to flatter the world, then follow the virtues in
nature, she shall hardly win preferment, and not easilye shake of the speech
of people, who as they note her garments indecent, will judge her also
dissolute in condition, as being a common experience in our conversation to set
our judgments upon that which we see with our eye: an example well observed
by that good Captain Lysander, to whom a certain tyrant of Cycylie having
sent many precious garments to advance the beauty of his daughters, he
refused them with this wise and commendable answer, that those attyres did
rather conteyne dyshonor then ornament: whether does he better resemble the
state and name of a gray Friar, or a Iacobyn, who in swashe apparel wandreth
like a Vacabond in the world, or he who keeping always his cloysture, does
fashion his life according to the form of his order: even so, in the judgment
of the world, a maid shall not be holden chaste in such great superfluity of
garments, and less likelye (by the same reason) to win a contented husband:
seeing that so precious a virtue is chastity, either in maid or married wife,
that it is as easily defiled in garments, thought, and the eyes, as in the
act: For if she reapose in her attire such a special bayte to allure a
husband, she may on the otherside account her self so much less lykely or
worthy, as he sees her vanity and void of true arguments of chastity:
what need we any more disguise or suspende our purpose, seeing such spiced
follies were never invented, but to advance the last act in love: For, to God
has been always more acceptable a woman in her simple modesty, or modest
simplicity, then being imboast with such curious insolency, which we read
has been paineally forbidden to the wise matrones in Rome, as the only
encomber of their commonwealth, as fell out in example when by little and
little it gat footing amongst them: great is the folly of that husband (if we
may touch the married estate) who not content with that beauty which nature has
given his wife, will set a new form upon her to abuse himself, and make her
desired of others: if she be fair, may not her natural beauty content him: if
she be foul or deformed, forbear to resist the will of God, in seeking to
suborne in her an other form then according to her first creation, least in
gyuing an edge to the tongues of the multitude, he be also subject to the
common destiny of the married sort: by this he helps forward the rumors of
the people, to whom every light occasion is matter sufficient to set abroche
their vessels of infamous speech: yea, by this, the evil sort will take ready
cause to make court to his wife, in whom pyed attire is like a mark in the
field that leads the eyes of the Archer: Ah many be the examples of old
time, and ten times so many are the miseries of the present season, and ten
times ten so many infelicities will thunder upon us, if there be not
discipline to reform this general abuse: what other cause rooted out the
ancient kings of Rome, if not the follye of the husband of Lucrece, who
washed his fond mouth with such a flattering praise of his wife in the presence
of Tarquyn, that it wrought like a violent Medicine in the heart of the
ra^isher: wherein what necessary occasion could draw him to such speech,
specially in a thing, which touching himself in peculiar, ought not to
concern others in common talk, the rather if to him only belong the use and
benefit of the beauty of his wife (how excellent or imperfect soever it be)
what need he to blase it, and so bring it into the desire of the world, whose
nature is dangerous to allure: such lipsubtill people I may lay in
comparison with that ancient Candaules, who less provident then was
necessary, and more arrogant in the beauty of his wife, then able to use it
worthylie, discovered her immodestly to one Giges his supposed friend, who to
return his dear familiarity, settled so deeply in love with her, that to
enter marriage with her, he prepared death for her husband: But what, such
people are not perhaps to be resembled with that Candaules on whom fell such
hyer for his desert, seeing of the contrary, those that I speak of, more
happy then wise, receive upon credit a thousand favors for their sakes, to
whom many honest people make love, and so are they cherished of every one for
their wives, whom they besmeare with all painted bravery: A thing so hateful
to God, and abominable in reason, that who suffers it merits even with
beasts: But why stand I so long upon this matter, which is so convenient
for us, and prejudicial to husbands: let them feed and flatter themselves
with so fond suffraunce, and we in the mean while as errant knights, will
travail in the conquests of their wives: For to believe that in the favor of
them, these sumptuous pompes were first drawn into use, were a faith without a
reason: But to hold them invented only as a visor to cover their wantonness,
is no less lykely in judgment, then most true in proof, as is directly
manifest in the answer which Augustus daughter practiced with her father: yea
I say (and by this I leave you to see how far I differ from you) that less
is the wydowe to be accused in this habit of immodestie, then either the maid
or married wife, because that as she is a better warrant to make love with more
suretye, so, with less danger she may disguise her self with these
artificial vanities, then either of the other two, whereof the one is commonly
discovered by her waspishe parents, and the other daungerously suspected by a
shaded husband, yea, and the wyddowe (quoth I) lies open to the whole popular
sort, whose eyes are so much the more exercised upon her, as her veil and
visor is taken away, which was her husband, whose affection blinded him in
many respects to his wife, which lie naked to the world, whose property is
to use the eyes of Argus in the discovery of other men's dealings: But you must
consider answers Phylopolo, that the opportunity either to speak, or
execute, favor not so familiarly the married women, as the wydowes, who depend
not but of themselves? and therefore having a more due property to love (as
well for the opportunity, as in a natural heat and forwardness, to that
business, whereof the maid has made no proof, and the married wife fyndes
some satisfaction with her husband) it is also more convenient for them to use
garments necessary for love, then the other two: Here the Lady suffering with
a modest impacience this challenge of their prerogative in attire, told him
that his reasons might find place in such as would agree that this curiosity
of attire was invented as an instrument or occasion to love, the same being
neither indifferent in truth, nor likely in resemblance, as being a weak
ground in judgment to resolve upon an inward effect by an outward
apparaunce of cause, seeing (with the old proverb) as the feather makes not
the bird, so our renown ought not to be assured but upon virtue: For as the
Frocke makes the Friar never the more devout, but is rather a sign of
religion, then a proof of his holiness: so in the attire of a woman lies no
true argument of incontinencie, and much less ought her garments to breed
any opinion of lewd life: And albeit they are matters apt to where the
suspicions of the world, yet our conscience being clear, what other reckning
have we to make of wicked speeches, then that they are rather of custom then
of credit: Besides (such is the babble of the enimyes to our behavior) if a
Lady should attire her self contrary to the order and use of others, she
should be noted either disdainful of the present fashion, or at least an
hypocrite in her conversation: and no less blame should she have of the
multitude who amid so many pompes, would disclaim the use, then an other
entangled with innovation) would play the Courtier among a company of severe
Noones: because, if all such newfangled devises carry a property of hate in
their beginning: yet time and practice gettes them such authority, that they
are as easily disgested as the other fashions: And as those light challenges
consist not but in the opinion of men, so seigneur Phylopolo, seeing such
fashions make their own authority, and by little and little become both
tolerable in use, and seemly in conversation, I pray your (with the property
of an upright judgment) mis^yke not if we practice them by general and common
accord, some upon a lewd will, and others without evil thinking, but most
part for that use and custom so require: you know also how commonly it
happens in our worldly experience, that any thing how good so ever it be,
yet if it be wrested to evil, may be as easily fashioned thereunto as to good,
whereof the example is more then lamentable even in the gospel, the which
(with grief I speak it) we wrest and apply according to our wavering
affections: And so seigneur pasquyor, to cut of this waspishe and weary
discourse, I pray you work us out of this, encombred laborinth, with a fresh
onset of your first beginning, least with wandering in unknown ways, we lose
the lines that should lead us to our first entry: Then Madame (quoth I) my
opinion holds it impossible, that a woman thoroughly touched with love
(notwithstanding all resistaunce at first) be not brought at last to reason,
and made tractable to the will of her friend, wherein notwithstanding I wish
you to hold my judgment imperfite, if the love be not reciprocal between
the two parties, as we presume: for if it should want on either side, (a thing
likely to happen, either by a prevention of some other, or by a disconformitie
in the persons) there is no less impossibility to plant affection there, then
to kyndle a flame where is no fire: a sentence notwithstanding which I will not
justify to the death, seeing I have seen ere now most strong Castles
(invincible by imagination) brought to submission by time and policy: such
Ladies (says Phylopolo) would I practice with the Engine of Phylip king of
Macedonia, whose common saying was, when he came before any town inassaultable
by force, that if an Ass laden with Gold could enter, he and his army
would not be kept out, as aduising us thereby that what friendship or force
could not mollefie, might be made soft by money, who governing the things of
the world, does also command our men: even so I believe there are few
women, whose virtue are not vanquished by this mean, and in whom although
love can work no power, yet money (bearing the nature of the Adamant) is an
instrument to draw them to the pleasures of men: ah seigneur Phylopolo
answered I, how unnatural is such pleasure, whose price and value being vile
in it self, the love also is most abominable that runs under such hope, yea
they are to be condemned with the damnable policies of such, who by magical
brothes and drinks, seek to force the nature of women, as a mean to induce
them to love: For love, resting not but in the heart, of small value is the use
of the body, where wantes the consent of the mind: and as what Lady so ever
bequeathes her body to use under a price and pretense of money, cannot merit
better than with a common strumpet: So, of the contrary, the honor were
greater in her, not only to withdraw all affection from such a friend, but
also to settle in hate against him, as to hold her in such vile estimation,
that rather money then other merit had power to lead her affection: yea, this
ought to stand in such high consideration with Ladies as not once to fall into
the thought of any noble mind: the same being the cause why some making a
question, whether it were better to offer love to a gentlewoman or a Marchaunts
wife, maintain that to the gentlewoman belongs a more property to love, as
whose fancy is not defiled with vile respect of money, nor her pleasure
subject to other tribute then love for love: and yet I will not excuse those
people of their errors, seeing that as we see commonly, good and high flying
Hawks of all sorts of plumes, so I have heard that the effect of money is no
less hateful to many merchants wives, then to most gentlewomen, on whom in
this case may be thrown a more suspicion, because their estate being great and
of nature like to birds desiring costly feathers, requires a high proportion,
and continual supply of money, where the condition of the other being less
chargeable, has also less need of relief, and yet both lives and loves in
no less felicity then the gentlewoman: and yet for my part, I can not judge
either sort of those women (having their affections settled in places worthy of
them) to owe more delight to wealth, then desire to the persons: And therefore to
a man not being beloved, and yet continuing in his purpose to possess her
whom he pursues, a most proper and fit way were, (in my experience) to
stand upon increase of merits, and by his ready services, to declare the
vehement nature of his love to his mistress, seeing that nature teaches us, to
hold reckning of such as be our well willers, as also to be desirous of
revenge against those who prepare violence against us: yea, even as God
(fashioning man of matter more massye) endued him with a force, which the woman
does want, so having framed the woman with a nature more tender and subtle,
has made her most familiar with mercy and pity: ah says Phylopolo, how
either you abuse your experience, or are ignorant in the condition of women,
to whom in all other respects, mercy and pity are most familier, but in
this their tirannie exceedes the natural cruelty of beasts: yea, such is the
violence of their spite, that with the Salymander, they seem to have a
felicity in the torment of their servants, whose presence they feed with a
flattering hope, and in their absence make a skoffe at their honest affection.
This I speak not without cause, as being warranted by the manner of many
Ladies, who albeit have their hearts settled in any one place, yet being
courted by diverse honest gentlemen, and desirous (in a common humor) to be
seen to have many servant sue to them (the same being in their fancy the
chief testimony of their beauty) they will not stick to embrace every one
with a particular affection, and that with such cunning, as the wisest shall be
led in a blind hope of their good wills: yea such is the violence of this
coossenage in love, that their lovers falling from one hope to an other, into
infinite fancies, happen at last into miserable passions, either incurable in
deed, or at least of painful remedy, and yet seigneur pasquyer, if you
think that for all these extremities, such women are drawn to any pity,
you are deceived in their property, and the truth not known to you, seeing
(with the Vipor) the more they see you tormented for them, the heauyer
martyrdom will they heap upon you, and yet never dismiss you, but with hope
to return: so that where destenie (or rather our natural folly) brings upon
us this misery, let counsel be applied before such passions take deep
continuance, seeing love (with the property of the Mariegolde), who being
grown by the sun, discloseth as the sun ascendes into degrees of heat: so
our thoughts and cares do more and more increase, if at the first we resist
not love, the original mouer of our disquiet. And even as a material fire, if
it be not quenched in the beginning, uses his property to increase in such
dangerous flames, that even rivers of waters can not command it,
notwithstanding in the beginning it might be put out without difficulty: even
so if this natural motion be not restrained in the beginning, our suffraunce
will turn to our smarte, and our selves rest miserably subject to his
authority: And albeit by small coldes and slender frostes we hope to deface
him, as by ieolousies and other inconveniences in his behavior, yet in the
end we shall prove (alas to late) those flattering defenses to breed (with
water sprinkled upon hot coals) but a renewing of the fire and flame of our
love. And because you shall not think my counsel to concern only such as
find not a reciprocal love in their Ladies, I wish my advise might warn all
other in whom is pretense to enter under the yoke of love: because that if
once they swalow down his traiterous baytes, it shall be always impossible to
discern truly the loyal mistress from her that has no faith, and that as
well by a blindness in their own passions, as that they shall see most women
disguise themselves in so many sorts, that they shall find it hard to
discern even their colors: So that I hold and mainteyne him to be most wise,
who, notwithstanding he think to receive some reward and hyer of his Lady,
estraungeth himself even in the beginning, and not suffer his mind to enter
into captivity: wherein albeit this pleasant use of her body be of such
sweet savor, as it may take from you all taste of my council yet (besides the
many lamentable passions in love wisely revealed by the Lady Chariclea) make
you no reckoning of a vain loss of your time, a contynuall traueyle of your
body, an infinite care of mind a devouring charge and consuming of your
substance, and lastely, that to follow altogether the allurementes of love
you must fall from all other exercises of virtue and honest faculty: I account
him happy, who possesses in love. I hold him wise that moderates that vain
felicity: But I esteem him most happy and wise, in whom though love breed a
fancy, yet he forsake him before he enter into his fury: And as certain
ancient Philosophers held him most happy that never was borne, giving a
second felicity to him that was formed impotent or deformed, so I lay him
amongst the number of the happiest who eschewing al occasions forbeareth also
the practice of love, and I will ymitate the other, who although he have dipped
his finger in that unsavory broth, yet, fearing to be altogether scalded,
draws back to his honor and profitte: And yet, he that dare adventure under
the veil of such hope as lovers pretend, I could better allow the gentleman
to practice that trade, then such who profess the modest attire of the long
gown: not that I will derogate more the one than the other, esteeming them
both of one degree, every one in his quality: only me think the estate of
the Gentleman (which is to follow arms) is more tolerable in love, then our
frockemen, whose profession lies chiefelye in study, altogether unfit for
love: neither can the gentlemen so far transgress from any worthy
enterprise, as the other, seeing in him love is oftentimes one special cause
of courage, to attempt great things for the only service and remembrance of
his Lady, in whose respect he laboreth in many worthy exercises altogether
concerning arms, who seem to take their original mocion (or at least their
greatest increase) in the opinion of our Ladies, in whose favor we arm our
selves for the iustes, torneyes, and other acts of high actiuitie: so that it
seems almost necessary that such sorts of youth be sprinkled with the dew
of love, the better to prepare them to arms: the same (in mine opinion) being
the cause why the Poets aunciently painted out Mars and Venus using their
pleasures together, which has been eft represented unto us by all the Romants
either spanish or french: to such kind of people then I will not much defend
the practice of love if they list: but touching the others I hold it as
inconvenient for their trade, for the Merchaunt to confuse his traffike of
forrayne wares with the study of Physic: All of the contrary says
Phylopolo: For from what other cause proceed the effects of so many excellent
wits both of ancient memory, and present experience, yea, shyning amongst
the other monumentes of the world, as the Moon amid the stars, but that
they were kindled and set on fire by this brande of love whose drawing violence
as an adamant or loadestone, first entised the pen of Petrarche, Sauazar and
Beuibo, and in our time and country, was ye original bellows which gave the
first wind to the amorous exercises of Consart, Bellay and Thart, whose
singular perfection in their several phrase and method of style, has drawn
unto them a name of ymortalitie, and translated as it were the gift and
disposition of poestye from ytaly (the late mother nurse of that faculty) to
our country of france a chief mainteyner now of that ancient and
commendable exercise. And amongst all this socyetie of most excellent wits,
what other mean has raised them to the tip or high ripeness of perfection,
but only love, who without them albeit may seem to have been nothing, so by
these proves, the candle of their estimation had quenched, if love had not
ministered matter and given them value. So that I must ^aye to your charge,
either malice or parcialitie, if you take from men of study the practice of
love: it were a doubtful opinion, says Monophylo to hold that those kind of
men had sypped on the cup of love, seeing, if we may measure the dispositions of
others, by our proper fancyes, I think it would prove hard that a man
entangled in his snares, could at pleasure discover the state of so high a
conceyte as the writings of the Poets seem to disclose by figure: for as it
is a true experience that they only command their senses most, whose
affections be freeest, so there are none in whom liberty of speech has
less power, or the wits furthest enstranged from their due office and
function, then where love has a sole soueraignetie and government, the same
being an argument of opinion to me, that the better to advance their glorious
excellency in a subject exceeding all consideration of man, every one of
those voluble writers did fashion and choose a woman friend, as in whose
praise and memory, they raised so many excellent monumentes in writing: if in
such respect only (says Phylopolo) as you presume these writers heaped such
famous exercises, meethinkes their wrong was no less to the dignity of their
learning, then their actions most intolerable in example, seeing they might
have chosen many matters of much more worthynesse, than to become vain
worshippers of transitory ydols, as though their judgments were so base, and
their wits so vilely inclined, as without the subject of women, they could
bring forth no substance of learning: ah quod I, beware of hasty judgments,
seeing we may easelier slander their doings, than know their pretense. For
as we have reason to think that all these great loves which in their young
and green years they disguised in themselves under the shadow of poeie, do
promise more waightye exercises as they rise into more ripeness of age, so
considering how all things have their time, and every time his proper season,
it need not seem strange, if fashioning their rhymes according to the
subject resembling their present youth, they suborned certain passions and
pangues, and sawced their volumes with varieties of Venus miseries, the better
to serve as a looking glass for all the world, as for such as profess love
to find necessary rules for their instruction, and to such as hate him, to
abhor him more by their example, the same being so much the more convenient
in them (as whose age is not prepared for other studies (as their endeavor
brought forth a fruit of common commodity. This speech says Glaphyro, is
impertinent to our present purpose, and yet, to whosoever would demand a
reason of their writings, I think the Poets would answer, that it was the
most high and excellent theme that could be devised, because love has
always carried such sovereign power, that the highest elements that ever were,
yea even the ancient Gods themselves have vouchsafed to be led in triumph
under his banner: And for my part, if they traveled in those exercises, as men
in experienced in his authority, and but induced only to reveal the passions
which he hiteth in himself, I esteem them so much the more worthy, as the
matter was haughty and hard (I mean to speak so properlye of love having
made no proof of his nature) but if they have been lymed with the feathers of
his wings, and proved the burden of his power, it were not amiss, no less
for the furtheraunce of their study, then to favor their health and quiet,
that they resign their pretense, seeing it brings such danger in practices
wherein they have this assured and infallyble mean, if before they loase the
use of their senses, they persuade no possibility to attain to the end: yea,
albeit there be power to possess, yet let them fix upon this as upon the
north star, that the pleasant use (being the end and mark of all their
pretense) is no other thing then an opinion of pleasure raised of an affection
which is borne more to one woman than an other: and lastelye that all women
have affinity with the humors of their first mother Eve, who was not without
her frail and slyding infirmities. I confess that in this mean or medicine
is neither such facilitye nor constancy as may be devised, because who has
once imprinted an opinion of a woman in his conceyte, may answer that he
makes no value or estimation to use or possess, but only because of an
affection which is extreme toward his mistress: yea, if causes be
indifferently measured, you shall find no comparison between the pleasure we
receive of a public woman to whom we bear but a vile and squirilous
affection, in respect of the delight we feel in our peculiar friend: so that
the best advise I can give to him that would beguile love, is to fashion at
the first a desperate impossibility to possess, seeing that to warraunt us
from the passions, amongst which love reigns, we have a double medicine, the
one, if in believing the suggestions of reason purelye and simply we do
supplant all affections leaving neither root nor rynde in us, the other, if
when passions kindle and prevail over us, we fight against our proper wills,
maintayning a civil war in our selves, under the leading of reason,
accompanied notwithstanding with some contrary passion: the first was familiar
with Socrares, who (by a deep and heavenly Philosophy) being armed with a
continual contempt of all things, observed such constancy that neither
prosperity could make him swell, nor aduersitye cause him to stoop: This
remedy seems so much the stranger as our soul being composed of reason and
passion, our passions oftentimes do carye away our reason: And therefore we
must with diligence resort to the second medicine: when reason (environed with
passions, and not able of her self to shifte them of, takes aid of a
contrary passion, which albeit of it self be not good, yet enclyning in this
hehalfe to reason, with serviceable duty as to her sovereign mystrisse, can
not be called evil, because affections be not evil, but when against the
order of nature, they seek to bear rule over reason: This was the medicine
which the Philosopher Carneadus applied to our instructions, as aduising us
that amydde the froth of our mortal delights, we should remember the
myseries of the world, to the end that brydeling by that mean our unbridled
pleasure, we may temper the one with the other: This was the wish of Phylip
of Macedonia, who receiving in one day news of the birth of his mighty
son, and report of two victories obtained to his use, craved that Fortune
would mix his great felicity with some sharp accident, least his flesh used
her property: the wise Anaxagoras, notwithstanding nature stirred him to
delight singulerly in the life of his child, yet his extreme joy was so
moderated with a continual fear of our common frayltie, that his death was
not grievous when he remembered he had begot him in the state of mortality.

These two ways in deed are no less commendable for their excellency, then
most convenient to defend men from such sorts of furies: And yet touching the
first, although in other affections it may prevail by a continual use and
meditation, yet I stand in doubt to assure it any place in love, for that he
is a passion so subtle, that we see him no sooner enter into us, then we have
advertisement of him: yea even Pallas the Goddess of wisdom fell one day
upon a sudden into the nets of Venus and Cupide choice of place, we shall
relief our grief and release the bonds of our first sorrows: it may be this
policy is nothing pleasant to Monophylo, whose reasons yesterdaye contained
matter of ymputation against such as were defiled in thought only against
their Ladies, but for my part, much less that I find cause of offense therein,
seeing of the contrary, (and yet I am not far estraunged from your opinion) I
hold it the only and ready mean to love well and perfitely: For if this
love as you say derive from a heavenly power, can you have a better mean to
know her, whom destenie and providence have provided for you, then changing
from one to another, to fall at last upon her in whom your senses do settle
and your affections rest satisfied: This is a persuasion amongst the Genetliake
Philosophers, that to know the estate of our providence and follow our
influence, is required change of habites, names, and diverse countries: and
their to pitche our stay where we encounter our best contentment, and not to
be obstinately bent to one place, wherein if we look to thrive we must reuerse
the revolution of the heavens, who seem to incline us an other way: And
therefore seigneur Monophylo, it were an error in all men of high courage, so
to encomber his mind with peculier subjection, that he had rather move his
own spoil in the daily pursuit of a woman not predestinate to him, then to
search his choice seuerallye elsewhere, whose favors he shall obtain at the
first, because both lot and destenie will incline to his affection: This
discourse of Phylopolo environed with miseries as to cover ye opinion which he
understood better by effect then by speech, setting all the company on a
pleasant laughter, was suddenly answered by the Lady, who under a smooth anger
told him he needed not add an oath to make her believe him, and much less
that himself was without experience of his own remedy in whom she doubted
not there was fulfilled a more perfect warraunt and witness than in any of the
company: which he denied, assuring her that he never embased himself so much
as to become the servant of one mystresse only, esteeming it an act of great
unthankfulness to all the rest of that sex, for the respect of one only, to
abandon the love of infinite others to whom perhaps is more desert and duty
of obedience, then to her in whose regard we entangle our credit and consume
our goods and time: all of the contrary (answered I) for singular love or
affection simply and pefectly settle to one only, breeds in us a ready
behavior of general courtesy to the rest, where otherwise in seeking to
content all, we hazard the displeasure of all, for there is no other motion
or original cause of courtesy, but of love according to the testimony of all
the Romants and histories treating of such affairs, where you shall find the
most perfect and loyal lovers to be they that most exercise courtesy toward
all others induced only by a reverent respect to their only mystresse, how
many men do we see impotent in form, of metal lead heavy, of mind
sluggishly inclined, and of manners loathsomely disposed, in whom neither
learning, si^nce, use custom nor example of wise conversation, can work any
honest alurement to honor, yet love, whose entisements are proper spurs to
civility, has so transnatured him as if he were cast in a new form, by
which mean he becomes no less civil in life and manners, then before he
excelled in dumpish and lyther disposition, the same agreeing with the common
speech and perswacion of the people, that to fashion a young man is necessary
to shrowde him under the wings of some Lady, of whom he is amorous as a
sufficient mean to draw him to honor and civility: for such is our common
fault that being cladde with the mistie colors of Philastie and self love to
our selves, we cannot enter into our own errors, whereof as our Ladies do
give us often knowledge, so their warninges become come commonly special
instruments of our speedy change making their slight corrections of far
more authority with us than if we had been warned by any severe preacher in a
pulpet: And albeit (love being once as deeply settled in the woman as in the
man) it is not vnlikelye that she may be no less blinded in the manners of
her friend, then himself, and that (with the follye of parents toward their
children) for friendship sake she pass over necligentlye his imperfections,
yet the desire we have to please the eye and judgment of our Ladies, is
always a quick and clear lantorne to lead us to that behavior of honor
which we ymagine would satisfy them: And even as a good Captain prepared to
assault a town, reaposeth not altogether in his people (who notwithstanding
are his chiefest stay and strength) but necessarilye applies the cannon and
other engines of war, even so runs the condition of the true lover, who
pretending to batter the heart of his Lady, does not only prepare love to
vanquish and possess her (which is the principal of all) but leads her in
many exercises of civility and honor, as worthy pollecies to prefere his
enterbose the same being the perswation of that ancient Poet in his art of
love, who instructing him whom he would have to feign love, gives also
straight charge to him that loves indeed to use his advise without other art
but such as he learneth of love only, who may serve us sufficiently as a Mask
or Visor to play such a part: These matters (says Phylopolo) are no less
strange to me in speech, then their sense of hard understanding, wherein if
I should wade deeper, I should but heap confusion and rather speak by heart
then by the book, as being altogether inexperienced that way: But because I
govern not my self in these matters so much by the book, as by mine own
contemplation (and my fancy is not without singular pleasure) I pray you tell
me what other sign or mark of courtesy can you discern in these mad lovers
then a most solitary and continual care, a distraughting of the wit, a
distemper of the body, and lastly a general contempt of all other things
except her to whom his thoughts are addressed according to the late
instruction of Monophylo: So that seigneur pasquier, you can hardly establishe
honesty in your lover, who you see holds the world in contempt, and all
things therein in hate, yea they are either so ravished in passion, or
restrained from reason, that with the contempt of the world, I have seen them
bear such hate even to themselves, that their Ladies have loathed their
condition and been ashamed of their follye: and being sometimes rebuked by
them for such frantic behavior, what was the excuse of these poor fools,
but yt having no power of themselves, their only felicity depended upon the
presence of their Ladies: Suerly such haggard Pigions would hardlye be made
tame, and much less that their capacities stretched to learn any honest or
civil behavior, but rather as beasts void of natural judgment, they live
without courage or countenance: for if in the presence of their Lady, any
other hindered their access, or were impediments to have speech with them, oh
how wild are they in countenance, how unquiet in mind, yea, their whole
estate so restless, as if they were tormented with some hurtful spirit: and
if they fall into the absence of their mistress, you shall never see them settle
in any company or place of what value or worthiness soever it be, but as
vacabondes without warrant, or people fearing the fall of the firmament, they
ru^ne here and there, as though they had no other place to hide them in, but in
the eyes of their Ladies: But if either the power of love, (to whom they durst
offer no disobedience) or the authority of their Ladies (in whom they lived)
drew them to a certainetie of ab^ade with what other exercise did they
furnishe the place and time, then either to behold the Moon, prune their
stomach with fretting and jealous sighs, or at least sit like saint
Leonarde, resolved into weary silence, and so moving their own scorn, they
blased themselves in their proper colors: wherein seeing I am slipped thus far
into the discourse and state of this matter, I can not but commend the short
counsel of seigneur Pasquier, that to conform young men to honest civility,
is necessary they make love, neither am I against Glaphyro, aduising men of
arms to do the like to prepare them the better to actions of virtue and
honor: And for mine own part, I see no reason to restrain any degree, whether
he be a round cap or a long gown, seeing that albeit study is their
principal profession, yet the exercise of courtesy can not be inconvenient to
them, if neither they turn their sweet time into spoil, nor their senses
into subjection of the rage and folly of that imperious angel Cupide: by
these observations they may easily attain to the civility requisite in all
Gentlemen, and by this mean are they apt to be acceptable not only to
Ladies, but also to all other people of any qualyty: and to exchange
discretion for fancye, or to run so headlong in the humor of their will,
that they loase not only the due knowledge of others, but even be blind in
themselves, as we read of Solomon, Hercules, with many others of excellent
wits so long as they stood free from this passion, but being once embrued
with it, their state declyned, their condition changed, their fortune
reuersed, and lastely themselves so generallye transformed, that (except the
shape) they retained no resemblance of men if these had been men acording to
their name, or their wisdom exercised in due and worthy sort, they had
rather governed love, then become thralles to his power, they might better have
dissembled with him, then so vilely incline to him, and so might they have
eschued the populer obloquie raised to their confusion. But what such accidents
are the true fruits of love, and to who so ever treades that desperate
laborinth, it is an ordinary destinye of a wise man to take the habit of a
fool, of a careful manne, to become negligent, of a valiant manne to be so
weak, as to stand in awe of a word of his mystresse, of a provident man, to
loase all pollecye, of a young man, to become withered, of a well spoken to
stutte, from a good shape, to be cladde with deformities, of a free man, to be
miserablye bound, of a pacient man to become a murmurer or else to bear the
burden of an Ass, of a religious man, to be an ydolater, of a rich man
honored, to be made poor and skorned, of a liberal man inclyned to charity,
a disdainer of the honest necessitye of others, of a quiet man according to
christianity, a minister of revenge in the filthye cause of his minion, and
lastely even to loase the knowledge of himself, God and the world: whereof
the contrary, he who by wisdom can avoid the rage of passion, and apply
himself to the honest means requisite to allure the hearts of Ladies, shall
have a thousand aduauntages above the other overwhelmed with the burden of
love: as first by his wisdom he shall not suffer himself to be over ruled
with passions: his care shall not be turned into necligence, his courage into
cowardnesse, his youth into age, his sweet speech into stammering, his
liberty into thraldom, his patience into murmour, his faith into hypocrisy,
his wealth into want, his devotion into deuillishnesse, his sufferance into
revenge, nor lastely, he shall be neither blind in himself, ignorant of God,
nor unthankful to the world: he shall bring no stain to his sex, as being a
man to suffer himself to be conquered by the fragilitie of a woman, whom God
has not created, but as an inferior companion to the man, and much less shall
run into the babble of people, either for himself or his mistress, which the
lover perplexed or enuyroned with passions, can not eschew, although he think
he walks in the clouds: as for example, so soon as he enters into speech
of his mystris, how easily may we see the coals of affection kindle in his
face, as both by change of color, and also partiality of speech stryuing
always to raise her worthynesse, the same being one cause (I suppose) why the
Poets figured love all naked, because he does so easily discover himself to
all: where of the contrary, he that under an artificial pollecie, with
indifferent and familiar behauior, can rather pretend then make love, speaks
not without modesty of her whom above the rest he means to court, yea if
necessity so require, he is so curious over all causes of suspicion, that Argus
himself can not descrie in what respect he traueyleth: And who doubts that a
woman to whom her honor ought to be more dear then all the values of the
world, esteems not better of such one, then either of a blabbe, to whose
tongue silence is a pain, or a fantasite fleeter, who, with himself,
forgettes also the estimation of his mystris: wherein if these reasons suffice
you not to prove the passioned lover to be less acceptable to his Lady, then
he that but dallyeth or dissembleth in love, let us I pray you consider the
proper nature of a woman (I speak not generally) whether she applies more
frankely to the will of him with whom she stands in secret and dear value,
or to him of whom she is most made of: for my part I hold with common
experience, that he is best welcome, that best can govern her with sweet and
pleasant devise, in whom is most show of thankfulness, who best can make
court to her, who soonest can find her humor and wisely feed it, in whom
lastly is a most ready facility of tryfling flatteries, with such other
outward varieties of delight: for touching the inward respect, women (for the
most part) hold little or no care of it, albeit they may pretend a desire of
loyalty, which notwithstanding they esteem but as a superficial ceremony:
No, the more she sees you plunged in passions for her, the less careful is
she of your contentment, where if she find you grow cold in love, it is
then that she enters into the heat of her affection, being of nature like
to a disease, whose cure comes by a contrary medicine: So that seeing women
(even by their own confession) stand in condition contrary to our wills,
and that by custom they take pleasure to entertain the true lover with
blaunched signs, were it not far better with the loss of liberty, to
eschew also the scorn: And truly I can not (although to our proper shame)
but accuse here the common weakness of men, as to incline so easily to the
will of women, whose custom of dissembling dealing, deserves a counterchange
of like quality: And herein I wish my example might induce others to use the
friears hypocrisy, and (with the women themselves) to prefer many sorts of
curte^ies, which being applied in their apt season and accompanied with such
show of loyalty, that they think all is done in their favor, may happily
incline them as we best wish them: it is hard for a woman to restrain her
affection from him, who is civil in behavior, secret in fact, modest in
speech, wise in all chances, and professing to love that which his Lady
likes, with a disposition to conceal not only all things of general
importance, but also to be circumspect even in the small favors which he
receives of his mystris: These things are easy to be done of him whom I have
figured unto you, and of hard compass to the other, by whose proper
beastliness he moves his own scorn in the world, as to hunt after the
fancy of a woman, whose felicity is his grief, for that he seeks so much to
please her, yea (seeing him already bleared) she enforces her pollecie to
make him more blind, choking him with sugared words, with the subtlety of
Silla or Circes: which I beseech you (Madame) note not as evil in me, seeing
custom has made my opinion more then natural: and if in uttering my fancy,
I bring offense to your presence and majesty of this place, I lay my self
upon your authority, whose property is either to excuse or pardon: This
discourse seemed waspishe to one of the company, who feeling a new plaster
applied to his old wound, could not but clawe, though he rather smarted then
ytched, assuring him that spoke it, that were not the friendship he bare him,
and reverence he reserved to the company, he would tell him, that either he
had long disguised his nature, or for the present was become a corrupter of the
commonwealth, as to bring in such magical hypocrisy, that no woman was so
honest as to defend her self from his pepered pollecies: But I pray you (Sir)
says he, take heed you fall not into the fortune of him who lost the liberty
of his country, for that he fashioned such a subtle lover as you seem to
desire: Admit that should happen (says Charyclea) yet would I make my
self party to his cause, not that I allow his opinion in the generality of
women, although I can suffer his counsel to be exercised against such, who
have a malicious glory to bob those poor souls, whose folly is rather to be
punished, then their condition pitied: And in deed the world so swarms with
numbers of that sort of women, that I am half persuaded to believe his report,
although it tend to our great disaduauntage, for now we have (besides our
apron Ladies of the City) many popingay pratlers elsewhere, who as they take
it for a marvelous vaunt and brag of their beauty to have many suitors, so
their property is (with the Iuggeler, that has for every company change of
Legerdemeane) sometime to interteyne one with speech, to court an other with
looks, to be familiar with the third by signs, to lure the fourth by a false
train of cloaked honesty, feeding them all with one unsavory hope, and him
she makes her Ass, that bears her most affection: So that I stand not now
to marueyle, if many (made wise with your counsel seigneur Phylopolo) seek to
disguise with women, seeing in themselves is bredde the example, neither is the
revenge unjust, if with the precedent of their own deceites, they encounter
the like pollecies, and having satisfied the subtle desires of men, they slip
forthwith into the slander of the world: yea Madame answers Monophylo (the
only protector of women) and many there be who wrongfully backbite women,
boasting oftentimes to have the possession of their whole body, which they had
never so much credit as to touch with their little finger, and that for a
revenge of an honest and chaste repulse: an other sort there are also, who, to
win the name of iolie Gentlemen, will not stick to say, they have and do
govern her, of whom they never received word of light quality: And
therefore I wish all women of this straight regard, that before they depart
with the thing which they can not call again, they consider with two minds,
and behold with three or four eyes. For the first woman being seduced by
hasty credulity, was the cause why our ancient father was deceived: and at
this day, men are not without their revenge, and much less unfurnished of
means to exercise it, as turning it to their great glory to disguise their
behavior, and all to deceive a simple and innocent woman with present
imagination, that as soon as they have fashioned a woman in their mind, she
is due to them as it were by obligation, and therefore they take small advise
to commit their fancy to execution: But if she, for the more surety of her
honor, will not condescend to their importunities, then they either give her
the name of fine mistress dainty, or else to be so subtellie simple, that she
had rather choose a little quidam of mean value, then admit into favor a
gentleman of so lusty estate as he weeneth in himself: Oh seigneur Phylopolo,
what heresy is in these opinions, what blasphemy in their doings, seeing that
as to the man is allowed a simple power to assail, so the law has left to the
woman an honest liberty to defend, and as the man has only a tongue to
require, so nature has lent the woman two ears to hear, to the end that if
he make it lawful to sue, she has no authority to deny: But if you will
have it so, that the woman (with the tree that inclines to every wind)
abandon her self to every request, what prerogative (I pray you) allow you
to such as are the first in date: what pre-eminence deserve they, who by a
perfection in love, and long and loyal pursuit, have won the possession both
of the body and mind of their mistress: could it stand either with reason or
honesty to dispossess them of the thing so well deserved: here Charyclea
using her authority told Glaphyro that if he intercepted not the quarrel,
Monophylo was like to give the Canuesado to Phylopolo, and therefore as well to
cut of their grudge, as satisfy the rest of the society, she wylled him to
renew his late discourse touching the remedy of a lover: whereupon Glaphyro,
whose quiet hearing of their controversies, had brought him to a settled
judgment of their arguments, although he made it hard to judge in so
doubtful a cause, yet he told them generally that it were best not to love at
all, but to give speedy remedy to him that were already entangled, was in
the hand of God, of whom only counsel is to be taken. But seeing (says he)
you will needs have my medicine applied to your lover, I say (as before) let
him retire with speed, least his misery be incurable: For encountering the
cause in the beginning, he easily may govern the effect, neither need he any
medicine to restore him again to his nature: But if he be so far spent with
passion, that his forces are to weak to help his desire out of that peril,
then let him resort to a good and long dyot, I mean an absence long and far
from the place of his infection, and with (the pollecie of Gallen to eschew the
place) let him flee far, tarry long, and not return, till either change of
air have purged his mind, or suffraunce of time seasoned his disease: This
medicine albeit in the beginning may carry a little taste, yet his effect is not
least pleasant and most sovereign of all other against the state of this
danger: for if the presence of our Ladies kindle and feed the flame of our
torment, it can not be but absence (as an antidot to purge a poison) brings
health, or at least mortifieth our passion: And albeit to some, absence is
rather a bellows to renew the coals of affection, then a sufficient lyquor
to quench them, and that absence stays the course of all other sorrows,
saving only the misery of many consumed lovers, whose reprobate state
proves it without force against their condition: yea it may be that generally
our first days grief of absence, may seem more intolerable then a whole
year: yet singular experience makes no general authority, nor the misery of
one proves no community of destenie: and by reason we find that there is no
love so violent, nor sorrow so vehement, which give not place to time, who
estraungeth all things from their present nature, only in this remedy must be
observed a constant and continual patience: For if for one, two, three or
four Months you absent your self, and then fall into the presence of your
Lady, it is as if you should cast seed into a ground, and not give it
convenient time to ripe, to the end you might reap perfect fruit: seeing in
this new presence are renewed such sparks of your old misery, that you are
not only negligent in your late preservative of health. But (with the nature
of hot ymbers sprinkled with drops of waters) you fall into a more violent
heat then before: All Physicians fear much the second return of a
sickness: And even as a sick man to whom the air is forbidden, aduenturing
before his time, falls into a more dangerous fever, so if your diseased lover
be not well confirmed when he encountreth, a second presence of his mistress,
his pollecy of absence will profit him nothing, where if he be well purged and
cleared of all passions (which time and discresion will bring to pass) then
with no pain and less fear, he may safely encounter her, and yet not endure
to much fellowship with her, seeing to a delicate stomach, a surfeit comes as
soon with to much of a good meat, as to eat a very little, of that which is
evil: So that even as a little sight is much dangerous, if he be not
altogether cured of love, so notwithstanding he be thoroughly healed, yet to much
familiar society can not but bring him great disquiet: seeing the eyes of our
Ladies (I know not by what art) are far more hurtful to us then the mortal
sight of the basilicque, by whom we die but of one death only, but with the
eyes of our mistress, we are stricken ten thousand times a day without power,
notwithstanding to dye, considering that even the best parts in them, are to
us more venomous then the bytings of a poisoned Serpent, and where they serve
to them for a beauty and necessary sense, it seems (of the contrary) that
nature has not placed them there, but as instruments of our common
destruction: I may resemble the mischief in them with the misery of
Promotheus, whose liver did daily increase, notwithstanding Jupiters Egle
prayed daily upon it: yea it is worse then Sysiphus, whose penance is
without ceassing, to turn and role a stone: and more horrible then the monster
Hydra: So that let him be wise, who stands of himself to vanquishe these
passions, seeing his trouble will be no less (if they be once rooted in him) to
subdue them, then to that valiant Hercules, against the forces of the monster:
And therefore let him stand specially upon his guard, that if he have
discontynued the presence of his mystris some long time, he renew not
eftsoons her company, but with precise distression, least either the charm in
her eyes, or enchauntment of her tongue, set a new edge of those sorrows,
which time had made dull.

It may be seigneur pasquier, that my advise caryeth small credit with you,
and less authority with Monophylo, as both the one and the other being
without proof of such a medicine: But as all other things stand in awe of
time, so doubt not but time also makes love wax old, according to the example
of a fertile soil, which for want of due tyllage, falls at last into
sterrilitie: even so, love being not enterteyned of his sinews, nor fed with
that which should mainteyne him in his iolytie, becomes no less cold in his
heat, then the ground withrede in fruit: Al things have their time, which
time is the proper trompe to sound every secret, and therefore a Lady cannot
take sufficient counsel against the danger she enters into, when she
bequeathes her body to the mercy of a man, seeing (as the world says) the
value of a woman consistes in the innocence of her honor, and her worthynesse
of no longer date then that treasure is kept undefiled: And not only (as you
said erst seigneur Monophylo) for the disguisings of men, which is a right
good consideration, but also in respect of others pretending for a time a
better affection to them: for that as men, like men be frail and weak in
their counsels, so their wills are full of variety, and the most wisest now a
days not least infected with revolution or change: And seeing (Madame) your
chief request runs that we proceed to mortify love altogether, I could
not avoid the name of unthankful, if I should spare my counsel, to such who
(perhaps) have nothing to do with him, I mean all honest Ladies, whom I
warn eftsoons (albeit to my great disaduauntage) that the thing which they
ought most to fear, either toward their best beloved, or on the behalf of
strangers, is not to lose the authority which they have won of them: For a
woman (to resemble her properly) is as a tender glass, which in his fragilitie
is pure, neat, and clean, and delightful to every one, so long as he stands
in his integretie: But if it be once cracked or broken, it falls into the
contempt of every one: even so a woman being corrupt in that, which she ought
to keep as a precious treasure loaseth (with the same) the estimation of her
self, whose glory before stood not in such high value, as now (to her
grief) her flower withers, and her plumes fall even into contempt with such,
who erst being even slaves to her will, stand now in a state of souereintie
over her and hirs: The hystories discover at large the ancient division of
man, who from his original, being formed with four feet, as many hands and
two heads, was divided by the Gods, whereof the one part was made the male,
and in the other moytie the female found her name. And (I have read in many
authors worthy of faith, that the great God Jupiter having applied to every of
them their proper and particular qualities, amongst other memories worthy to be
marked, he gave the charge of virginity to the maid, and the guard of
chastity to the wife to serve them for assured pauises against the assaults
of the world: Then what pain I pray you is due to her, who is negligent in a
charge of such high importance: it may be you note this phrase inconvenient in
me, as though I seem to shake the estate of our common commodity: but how so
ever you attyrs your opinion, my indifferency appears in this, that I warn
as well the man as the woman, although my speech brings prejudice to our sex:
And therefore I wish you Ladies to season your stomachs with other diet, then
with the peppered allurementes of love, in whom if there be danger to the man
in respect of his passions peculiar and proper to himself, he is double
perilous to you, whose weak nature suffers their sorrows as well as your
own smart, besides the blemishe of your renown, which as you ought to waighe
even in the balance of your life, so if you lose it, you stop the river that
feeds the fountain of your estimation: if these fears be insufficient to
restrain you, eschew in time all intising occasions, as both the dissembling
looks, and deceytfull ears of such as you ought so necessarily to fear. The
honest shamefastness of women requires to embase their eyes and bear their
sight low, as not to desire any thing: And if upon a vain presumption, she
raise her self into a self hope and promise to conquer love, she shall no
less suddenly slip into his snares, then lightly she suffered her self to
be possessed with that ouerwening opinion: The Monks enclose themselves in
their cloisters, to conquer the flesh, and the Hermittes lead a solitary
life in Forrestes and groaues: how then can a woman live in presumption to
bridle her frailty standing even in the midst of worldly delights: she
laughes, she speaks, she has conversation with young men, she thinks she is
not sought, because her self does not desire, and yet she sees not how she
hatcheth under the wing of those familiarities her own destruction: far
better were it for her, and more for her honest profit to eschew such
society who seek but to ransake the castle wherein is kept the assurance of
her honor: and above all, let her close her ears from him, who by corrupt
gifts, settes a stale to entangle her, as the fowler enchauntes the bird, or
the Fisher by his worm, betrays the stelie Gudgeon: every hold enclyning to
somonce, with long parle seems willing to consent to her spoil, and to admit
the power of the enemies: neither seems any thing impossible to him that
strives to conquer, and less easy to the woman to warraunt her self amidde
the ambushes of our polletike youth: This counsel stands not inconvenient to
my estate, and less exspectation of hyer for my traueyle, because I live
bound in honest duty to all Ladies, whom as I dare assure generally (if
they learn and follow my principles) of increase in honor with perpetuity of
name, so the necessity of my counsel I commend only to such as have been
prodigal of their liberty, unless they know an other line to lead them
more directly then mine, who (in this small discourse) did not pretend to
apply to the contentment of every one, (for so my burden would prove
intellerable) but only to discover a short remedy which I have always
esteemed most proper for the health of a lover, which is absence, with firm
purpose never to tread the path of his mistress again: and this remedy is
enforced rather, by an art and industry guyding us, then once procured by our
proper nature or motion: But even as you ( seigneur Monophylo and Pasquier) by
your several discourses, have erst taught us, not the means to love, or by
what art we should moderate our affections in love, but rather have laid open
the subtle manners, by which that little thief seaseth of our hearts, when we
least think to be his subjects: so I will here present you with: an other
mean, not as by counsel, how we ought to escape love, but oftentimes how
without thinking we are constrained to abandon him: it is disdain, I mean an
almighty disdain, which has power to put this love to mortal utterance, And
this albeit be most certain and iustefyed by many examples, yet as seigneur
pasquier, laying open the parts of love, gave him diverse natures, according to
the diversity of passions: even so this disdain takes sundry effects,
according to the quality of lovers, sometimes more and sometimes less, even
as they are touched with vyolence: And if you will know whereof this disdain
takes his beginning, I will not satisfy you with mine own experience, because
I never made proof of it, but by reason, I will derive him from two heads and
fountains: The first is, (and that of no mean importance) when after a long
suit and service to our Ladies with many reverent obediences, we find them
not only unthankful, but also (making a scorn of our service) they translate
the merit of our martyrdom to an other, and so make our grief the instrument
of their delight: which albeit at the first we hardly receive into judgment,
and as it were see and not see, yet their dealings entering into custom, and by
little and little vanquishing our partiality, it is most assured, that such
love changes habit and takes the quality of a hate far above the nature
of the former friendship, according to the witness of Reguier discovered by
Boccace in one of his Nouells: oh dangerous disdain, oh spite whose power
has brought many noble Gentlemen to such extremity of fury, that defyling
their hands with the blood of their Ladies, they have also at one instaunt been
the unnatural homicides of themselves: For (with pasquiers rule) there is such
a natural simpathya of humors amongst men, that even as we love such as like
of us, so also our flesh and minds rise against them in whom is grudge
against us or ours, as the glorious or proud man loving no other then
himself: the same being the cause (as I think) why the ancient Lawyers
allowed in their law of nations, this desire of revenge, as falling by nature
into the minds of all men: and albeit by Gods decree we are defended to use
revenge, yet our nature holds her sweet course to vomit poison against such
as hate us: And therefore no marueyle if a woman having once charmed our
affections, and after, by certain outward acts we prove their disguised
nature toward us, that then we turn course, as being instructed by the
precedent of their pollecies.

This is the first kind of this disdain, whose power is far more violent
then the other which proceeds of a certain ymagination of the mind, or else
by a light belief of false reports made of our Ladies, and this disdain
albeit is nothing so mortal as the other, yet increasing by succession of
time, his effects in the end prove nothing inferior to the first, and
therefore in his beginning, he is called ielowsie, which although in his prime
age is nothing else then a renewing of love, yet as he rypeneth by little and
little, and by degrees rises to perfection, he changes condition, and
leaving the name of ielowsie, usurps the nature of disdain in many persons,
I say not in all, because for the most part, our affection is so great, and
our weakness so general, that oftentimes we are constrained to digest it,
as a weak stomach indueth a hard medicine, and all because there remains
certain sparks of the love we bear to our mistress. There be also sundry
other manners of disdain, as that which rises of a continual repulse, with
far sundry others, which I am content now to pass over, as having never
tasted their condition or nature.

Here Phylopolo, albeit he commended the means which Glaphyro preferred to
dissolve love, yet (says he) if that charge had happened to me, I would not
have doubted to have applied more necessary medicines to such an evil, and
with more ease have cured the cause, and with less danger governed the
effect: he brings in a long absence, accompanied with a desire to steal out of
this prison of love, and then a light disdain whose cause comes many ways.
But (in my fancy) he is far from the mark, and his reasons nothing incydent
to the necessary points of the present purpose: Asclepiades an ancient
Physician, was not approved of many others of that faculty, because he
affirmed in opinion and argument, that the art of physic, or mean to cure
pacients, might be wholly maintained without any potions or medicines
compownded, but leaving all artificial helps, he referred all men to five
infallible and most necessary cures, that is, temperate exercise, moderate
vomit, reasonable sleep, convenient walking, and a good and long dyot: which
remedies in deed, were not impertinent to such as were in health and not
infected with disease: But to him who labored in a long and hot fever, I see
not in what use they could serve: even so I can not find how this long dyot
and absence commended so much by seigneur Glaphyro, can work any necessary
virtue in such, who are already stricken and touched (as it were) to the death:
And touching the disdain which he alleges, because his remedy in that is
more casual and by chance then otherways, I will leave it to work in
lovers, even as their nature can brook and bear: And for the means I have
promised you I will use the common method of most Physicians, as delivering
you a potion or drink, wherein is brued the whole and absolute cure of this
our diseased lover. Let him then drink of the flood of Lethes, other ways
called the lake of oblivion, of which the Lady Chariclea has cunninglye
brought into our memory toward the end of her shipwrake. And if this mean
either fail him, or he faint in the execution, then let him resort to the
circle of the moon, where perhaps he shall encounter a great part of his
senses, distraught since he first made inuacion upon the frontiers of Cupide:
But if this way be either hard to find, or uneasy to hold, let him at last
practice the counsel of the Physicians, and use a little Helbora, an herb
altogether dedicated to such vain and sonde miseries: For if ever any sort of
people were robbed of their wits, it is the miserable corporation of lovers,
whose blindness is such, that the sun seems dark to them in the plain
day, and in the night, they judge the moon a thick cloud: whereinto to
confess a simple truth, it is to be doubted, whether that misery proceed
more of their own indiscression, or is derived of the natural subtlety of
women, who have such a drawing power over the hearts of men (this he spoke
simply to urge the opinion of Chariclea and Monophylo her protector) that it
seems the Devil has incorporate himself in them, the better to delude men
not of base or low condition, but even such as by long use have won the name
of rich, wise and worthy Monarkes and kings of the earth: oh what partiality
show you here (says Monophylo) that to give season to your unsavory words,
you forbear not (even without occasion) to forsake the lymittes of our
argument: and yet you could not better discover our common beastliness, then
by the discourse you have made and so inconueniently applied: seeing that by so
much are we rude and weak in condition, by how much we suffer them to subdue
us, and their wisdom the more assured and commendable, by how much they can
warrant themselves from the wrongs which so castlye they lay upon us. But yet
seigneur Phylopolo, it is nothing so, nor your opinion so generally true, but
it may be disprooued by many examples: For if some by women have fallen into the
babble and rebuke of the world, yet we have Medea, Phyllis, Dido, with many
other unfortunate Ladies, who by the treason of their disloyal Jason,
Demophon, and Eneas, are made (alas) sorrowful grounds of unworthy obloquie,
both to their unhappy cotemporians or time fellows, and also their lamentable
posterity, and therefore me thinks your wrong is without reason, which so
partially you will lay upon that sex of whom we depend in comfort,
commodity and felicity: and without whom, as we could have had no original
being, so were it not by them, we could have no present conversation nor life:
in deed says Phylopolo, they are a necessary evil: and therein replied
Monophylo, are you no less ouerseene then in all the reast, and your error
more hurtful: But you seigneur Glaphyro, notwithstanding the cauell of
Phylopolo, I wish not to discontinue your discourse, the same being no less
necessary to intercept his heresy, then most convenient to confyrme the reast
of the fellowship: But the Lady considering by the height of the sun, that
their longer aboade there, might bring offense to the rest of their company,
whose custom (during this progress) was to observe good hours for their
repaste: told Monophylo what wrong he practiced to himself, in urging
Glaphyro in a matter (as she thought) of so small advantage to himself, seeing
withal (says she) that the time offers you favor, as thereby to sommon you
to resolve our long controversy, whereunto as I prepared the beginning, so am
I now to intercesse for love, of whom I take more pity, then he uses
compassion to such as implore his mercy: And so breaking of so indifferentlye,
I hope there is never one of us all who restes not satisfied, Glaphyro to have
run over so much matter in so few words: we to have been edified by his
acceptable speech, you ( Monophylo) to see so short an issue of all, and
lastly, the reast of the company, not to be offended with our long exercise
and aboade here: whereupon they discryed at hand four young Gentlemen of the
general trowpe, coming to warn them of dinner, who being informed of the
estate of the arguments passed amongst them all that morning, grudged with
their fortune to restrain them from such honorable fellowship, albeit if the
exercise renewed at after dynner, they sued to be admytted, and also others
more ancient of the band, who being also received, prepared themselves
against the hour of appointment, but such was their sodeyne occasion, neither
looked for before it fell, nor welcome when it happened, that they were driven to
change host, where, with the opportunity of a new place, they renewed
eftesoones the matter of their late appointment, whose success I leave at
large, as being suddenly estraunged from their society by mine own occasion.
