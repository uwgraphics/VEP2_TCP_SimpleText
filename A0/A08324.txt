A warning to London by the fall of Antwerp
To the tune of Row well ye Mariners.


THe sturdy Oak at length*
When forse does fail
though nere so tall:
Resigneth up his strength,
By boistrous blasts unto the fall.
The stately Stag in time does yield:
Him self a pray to Dogs in feeld.
The Pecock proud, ye swelling Swan:
At last does serve the use of man.
Pride, pomp, plumes gay:
Must have a fall who ere say nay,
Hye minds, state, power:
Shall come to end within an hour.
Let Antwerp warning be,
thou stately London to beware:
Lest resting in thy glee,
thou wrapst thy self in wretched care
Be vigilant, sleep not in sin:
Lest that thy foe do enter in.
Keep sure thy trench, prepare thy shot:
Watch well, so shall no foil be got.
Stand fast, play thy part:
Quail not but show an english heart,
Dout, dread, still fear:
For Antvverps plague approaches near.
Leave tearing of thy God,
let vain excess be laid aside:
Else shall thou feel the rod,
prepared for to scouge thy pride.
Forsake thy Deuilish drunken trade:
Which almost has the entrance made.
Erect your walls give out your charge
Keep well your ray, run not at large.
Faint not, fiercely fight:
Shrink not but keep your co^tries right.
Stand stout, on Jesus call:
And he no dout will help you all.
Trust not a civil foe,
Which under color wishes good:
For ere thy self do know,
by craft he seeks to have thy blood.
The Snake in grass does groueling lie:
Til for revenge due time he spy.
The leering Dog does bite more sore:
Then he that warning gives before.
Fine flattery, fair face:
Much discord breeds in every place.
Fire, shot, must be to hot:
For those which have their God forgot.
Rejoice not if thou see,
thy neighbors house set on a flame:
For like thy luck may be,
unless thou well prevent the same.
The scourge which late on Antwerp fell:
Thy wrack and ruin does foretell.
Make not a gibing jest thereat:
Lest stately Troy be beaten flat.
Pray God faithfully:
To save us from all treachery.
Dout not if we do so:
We shall escape the forain fo.
Pray we with one accord,
that God our Queen may ay defend:
From those which seek by sword*
to bring her graces reign to end.
Cut of (O Lord) their deuilish days:
And grant her life thy name to praise.
Guard her with grace her Champion be
That she may gain the victory.
Hope well, pray still:
God is our guide we fear none il.
Fear not, watch pray:
God sheeld this City from decay.
AMEN.
quod. Rafe Norris.
