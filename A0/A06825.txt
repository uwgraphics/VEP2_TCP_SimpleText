(...) was lodged in the Millers house, and of their pleasant communication. To
the tune of the French Lau^^
HEnry our royal King would go on hunting,
To the green forest most pleasant and fair:
(...) gave the ^art chaced, the dainty Does tripping,
(...) merry Sherwood his nobles repair.
(...)and (...), was unbound, all things prepared,
(...) the same, to the game with good regard.
(...) a long Summers day, rode the King pleasantly,
with all his princes and nobles each one:
^hasing the Heart and Hind, and the Bucke gallantly,
(...) the dark evening inforst them turn home.
then at last riding fast he had lost quite,
all his Lords in the woods, late in dark night.
Wandering thus wearily, all alone up and down,
With a rude Millar he met at the last:
asking the ready way unto fair Nottingham.
(...)quoth the Miller your way you have lost.
yet I think what I think truth for to say,
you do not lightly go but of your way.
(...) what do thou think of me quoth our king merrily
(...) thy judgment upon m^ so bree^e:
(...)(...) to quoth the Miller I mean not to flatter,
guess thee to be but a gentleman thief.
(...) thee back in the dark ^ight not a down,
(...)cast to it I presently crack thy knaves crown.
Thou do abuse me much (quoth our king) saying thus,
(...) a gentleman, lodging I lack:
(...) have quoth the miller not a grote in thy purse,
(...) thy inheritaince hangs on thy back.
I have gold codischarge all that I call,
If it be forty pence I will pay all.
(...)thou be a true man then answered the miller,
(...) wear by my tole dishile lodge thee all night.
^^eres m^ hand quoth our King that I was ever:
Say so^t quoth the miller thou may be a sprite.
^etter i will know thee ere hands I will shake,
(...) none but with honest men hands I will take.
Thus they went al a long unto the millers house:
Where they were ^^^^^ing of ^^^dings and souse:
(...) miller first entered in after him went the king:
^euer came he in so smokie a house.
now quoth he let me see here what you are,
quoth our king look your fill, and do not spare.
like well thy countenance thou have an honest face,
With my son Richard this night thou shall lie:
Quoth his wife by my troth it is a good hansome youth
(...) is it best husband to deal warily
art thou not run away, pray thee youth tell,
show us thy pasport and al shall be well.
Then our king presently making low courtesy,
With his hat in his hand, thus he did say:
(...) have no pasport nor never was seruiture,
^^nt a poor courtier roue out of my way.
and for your kindness now proffered to me,
I will requite it in every degree.
Then to the miller his wife whispered secretly,
Saying it seems this youth's of good kin:
Both by his apparel and eke by his manners,
(...) turn him out certainly were a great sin.
(...) quoth he, you may see, he has some grace,
(...) he speaks unto his betters in place.
Well quoth the millers wife, young man welcome h^^
And though I say it, well lodged shall thou be:
Fresh straw I will have, laid in your bed so brau^^
Good brown hempen ^^^ts likewise quoth she.
(...) quoth the goodman and when that is done.
you shall lie with no worse then with mine own^
Nay first quoth Richard, good fellow tell me true,
Have thou no creepers in thy gay hose,
Or art thou not troubled with the scrubado?
I pray you quoth our King what things be those?
Art thou not lousie, or scabbed quoth he?
If thou be, surely thou lie not with me.
This causde our King suddenly laugh out most h^^
til the tears trickled down from his face:
then unto supper were they set orderly,
With hot bagpudding, and good applepies.
Nappy ale good and stale in a black boule,
which did about all the boorde merrily troule.
Here quoth the Miller good fellow I drink to it
and to all courtnoles that courteous be,
I pledge thee quoth our King, and thank thee har^^
For m^ good welcome in every degree.
and here in like manner I drink to thy son,
do so quoth Richard and quick let it come.
Wife quoth the miller now fetch me forth light^^
that we of his sweetness a little may taste:
A fair Venson p^tie th^n brought the forth pres
Cate quoth the miller, but sir make no waste.
Here is good lightfoot, in faith quoth our King,
I never eat so dainty a thing.
Ywis said Richard no daint^ at all it is.
For we do eat of it every day,
In what place said our king may be bought like (...)
We never pay ^ennie for it by my fare:
from merry Sherwood we fetch it home here,
now and then we make bold with the Kings d^^
Then I think quoth our King that it is venison,
Each fool quoth Richard full well may see that
Never are we without two or thr^^^^ the ruff,
Uery well fleshed and excelent fat.
but pre thee say nothing where ever thou go,
we would not for two pence the King should it (...)
Doubt not quoth our King my promised secrecie^
the King shall never know more on it for me,
a cup then of lamps wool they drunk strait vnt^
and so to their beds they past presently:
the nobles next morning went al up and down
for to seek out the King in every town.
at last at this millers house some did espy him p^^^
as he was mounting upon his fair steed:
to whom they ran presently falling down on th^^^
Which made the millers heart woefully bleed,
shaking and quaking before him be stood,
thinking he should have been hanged by the roo^
The King perceiving him fearful and trembling
Drew out his sword, but nothing he sed^
The miller down did fall crying before them all
Doubting the King would have cut of his head.
but he his kind courtesy strait to requite,
gave him great living, and dubbd him a Knight
