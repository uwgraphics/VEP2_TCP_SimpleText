The presentacyon and introyte of this present book.
TO the right holy and right well e^rous loving and magnyfycence of our
saueoure Ihesu christ / and of his right doulce and glorious mod^r saint Marye /
the which ben the mocyons of all good operacyons / and with out the which
none can be begone nor ended. I Henry Watson apprentyse of London trusting in
the grace of god has enterprysed for to translate this present hystorye out
of Frensshe in to English / our moders tongue / at the commandment of my
worshypfull master Wynkyn de word / not having regard for to lay it in
another / or in more dyffused terms tha^ the frensshe does specyfye / for in
doing so I might lightly have failed. Wherefore I require all them that shall
read it / or that hereth it read / for to hold for excused my little and
obscure understanding. In praynge our lord that he give me grace for to
fynysshe it by such manner that it may be pleasant and agreeable / and
profitable unto the reders / and unto the herers of the same. Ame^.



Of the natyuyte of Olyuer of Castyll / and of the death of his mother.
Capitulo. i.


Because that I desire ye hye and notable faytes of right noble and right
valiant men of honor and prowess for to bring them in to memory and
recommendacyon / and also to the end that all noble and virtuous hertes may be
moved and styred for to do well / in likewise as our predecessors has done
before us / and in especyall / they of the which this present hystorye treats
of. I find written that after the death of the right noble / and valiant
lord / and prince. Carlemayne the great Emperor / and King of France /
after that he had subdu^d / and brought under his obeyssaunce / in to our
holy cryste^ faith the Spanyerdes. There was a king in Castyll / y^ which was
a right puyssaunt prince / that was much beloved of all his subgectes / that
at that time was depryued of the right heurous felycyte / that is in marriage /
which is to have lygnage / and generacyon / for the which cause all his
subgectes were gretely at my sease / for they desired no thing so much as to
se an heir of his body that might be successor of the realm after y^ decease
of this good king. His wife the which was the daughter of the king of Galyce
/ that was a fair lady and a virtuous / among her prayers and orysons / that
she ma^e so our lord forgate not to require him by his debona^e clemense /
that he would send her a child / to the end that the country abode not with
out an hery^ou^. Our lord Ihesu christ herynge the request that this good queen
made to him / forga^e her no^ / (...) in sh^^te time after she conceived / and
when term was come she was delivered of a fair sone / of the which the king
/ and all his subgectes were gretely reioysce / but their Joy was soon turned
to sorrow for the quenchad trauaylled so sore / y^ she lived not two hours
after the birth of her sone / the which was great dyspleasure to the king
that loved her so much / And certainly he had good cause / nevertheless he
was not left alone making that sorrow / for all his subgectes bare him
company.

How Olyuer was borne to be baptized / and how his mother was borne to be
buried. And how the Ambassadors were transmysed in to Al^arbe for to mary the
king again. Capitulo. ii.


AFter the co^playntes innumerable of the king / and of his subgectes / y^
queen was laid on bear and for to give comfort they ordained that the child
should be borne to be baptized / with the corpse of the queen. And so it was
done in great lamentacyons / and the child was named Olyuer and after that y^
service was fynysshed the king returned in to his palace / in the which palace
he demeaned his sorrow by long space of time / and he took no comfort but in
his right amyable sone Olyuer. And in kissing him oftentimes he said unto him
/ Alas my dear sone thy natyuyte has turned me to great Joy / and also unto
great trystesse and dolor / but in all humylyte I beseech our lord that he
have mercy on thy moders soul^ / And that he give the grace that thou may be
such one as my heart does require. In such words and semblables he
complained him often upon his fellow and spouse that he had so fervently
loved The noble men of his court / and also other of the realm were right
dolaunt because that as them seemed the king was becomen all desolate / and not
so famylyer with them as he had been accustomed before the death of the queen /
wherefore they said that the kings lamenting endured over long / wherefore it
is expedyent to us for to take advise in what manner we may cause him for to
cesse it / for he must put it out of his memory / for he is yet young and
lusty enough for to have progeny and children / and there is nothing y^ may
cause him so sone for to ^esse his sorrow / and make him Iocounde as to mary
him unto some young lady ^where as he may take his pleasure and delight in all
gladness. These words were not said alonly in this absence / but also in his
presence for they that were most couersaunt with his person / declared it
often unto him / and exhorted him for to be married / if that they might find
one that were acceptable for the dygnyte. At that time the king of Algarbe was
deed / and his wife was abyden wydowe / the which was one of the most
excellentest ladies at that time of the world / the which had a sone by her
ryghtfull lord and husband that was named Arthur / the which was a meruaylous
fair child / and Olyuer and he were both of one aege. The king of Castyll
had been aduertysed of the beauty of the queen of Algarbe / wherefore he sent
his Ambassatours / for to have her to his queen / y^ which Embassatours when
they were comen theder / were received with great tryumphe and honor / in so
much that shortly after she was accorded to them by ye lords of the realm /
as ye shall here. When they were brought in the presence of the queen and her
counsayll / they declared the cause of their coming / y^ which was gladly
herd both of her kynnesmen / and the other barons / and after that the
Embassatours had rehearsed that the which they had in commandment by their
lord and king / they with drew them in to their lodges / with whom went
many knights and squyres for to conueye them.



How the marriage was treated between the king of Castyll Olyuers fader / and
the queen of Algarbe / Arthurs mother. Capitulo. iii.
AS the queen saw her accompanied (...) most part of her friends. And them
that she most trusted in said. Lords ye know the cause wherefore the king of
Ca^^yll has se^te his Ambassadors hither / wherefore I prarye you for (...)
in this matter / for I am she that by our good counsayll will be agreeable to do
that the which ye shall determyne. These wor^s fynysshed / she took (...) and
went in to her chamber / and leave them alone with that matter. And fy^^^ly /
they were all of ou^ accord / that the marriage should be made / And returned
toward the (...) s^ynge that as them thought there was but (...) princes of
more auctoryte than the king of Casty^l was wherefore she might not be lightly
better bestowed. And in effect they showed her the young aege that she was yet
in / and also the tender aege of her sone. Wherefore they counsaylled her that
she should accept the request of the King of Castyll / The queen answered /
my friends I have told you / and yet does / that your good counsayll and
(...) / ^s well my will. And therefore make the responce / and answer to the
Ambassadors on (...) / such as ^e shall think most expedyent / (...) I
shall (...). And then they thanked her / and (...) five / or six of the most
notablest / (...) which were chosen for to give the answer (...) of y^ king
of Castyll. And wha^ that they were com^n to their inn / they said to them.
Our honorable lady the queen / of her grace and be^ygnyte / has accorded unto
your request / not all of her own voluntary will / but at the instaunce o^h^r
(...) and Barons. To whom it seems good / and vtyll / for the prospery^e of
both parties. That ye (...) when it shall seem you good / and (...) your lord
/ that as (...) as it shall please him / he may send for her / or come in his
person. For they put (...) to his noble (...). Nevertheless seeing that both^
parties were wydowes / unto their advise / it were (...) that he came the^er
for to wedde her And (...) the spous^ylies should be done / without any (...)
excess of (...) / more than apperteyned to such a feast. And as for the
surplus that he should do as it pleased him.

How the King of Castyll espeused the queen of Algarbe / and led her in to
Castyll / with her young sone that resembled Olyuer. Capitulo. ^^j.
Ra^yously the Ambassadors thanked y^ que^e / and her noble counsayll / saying
that they would gladly tell their r^sponce unto their ^orde and king / y^
shall be well content of this unity. And then at their requcit they were led
before the queen / whom they thanked / and ^oke their (...) ^ther full
honorably / and of all the other (...). And after that they had taken their
(...) / upon the (...) morrow they departed. But ye may (...) departed / the
queen h^d sent them many (...) gifts. Of their way and I ^urn^yes I can not
(...) you / but they made such dyl^gence / that they descended in the town
where as at that time the king remained. And as bryefly as they might / they
went toward the king / that allredy was aduertysed of their retornynge. And
after the reverence done / they recounted to him how they had spedde and
wroughte / whereof the king was meruayllously Iocounde / and at that time he
was delyvered for to goo theder within a three wekes / or a month for to
espouse the queen. And in likewise as the king had devised / so it was
accomplysshed / and departed from Castyll with a little company. And then as he
was upon his way / he sent word to the queen pronouncynge his comy^ge. The
which received him with great melody. And hastily ye spousaylles were
sumptuously made / in such a wise as apperteyneth to a king and a queen. The
young Arthur with all his puyssaunce made good chere to the king his stepfader.
Also when the king beheld him / him thought that he saw his sone Olyuer /
for to aege and bygnesse they resembled so much that they could not dyscusse
ye one from another / whereof the barons that came with y^ king was gretely
abashed. So when the wedding was fynyshed / and that the king had soiourned
there a month or two / he commysed in his stead a right noble knight / to be
protector of the realm of Algarbe. And after those things done he departed /
and led with him his new queen / and Arthur her sone. They rode so long that
they arrived in the cite where as the king did most remain / and were
received with great tryumphe and Joy. The king commanded that Arthur should
have such estate as his own sone Olyuer had / wherefore fro that day forward
/ they were nourysshed together / and loved ^oo perfoundly together that it might
never be lost / as ye shall here more euydently after ensuynge / and for a good
cause why / for they resembled so much that oftentimes they took one for
another.

How Olyuer and Arthur were commysed to a noble knight / for to practyse them
in feats of arms / And o^ the Iustes made by them / and who wanne y^ price.
Capitulo. v.


IT was so that Olyuer / and Arthur began for to wax great. Wherefore they were
taken from the keeping of the ladies. And gave to them a right prudent / and
valiant knight / for to demonstre / and enduce them in feats of arms / as it
apperteyneth to ky^ges sons. He received the two noble children / that were
both of one aege / and of one beauty / and instructed them in all good m^^ers.
Th^n when they began for to have knowledge / they loved together with so perfyte
love / that hey made a^ya^nce together of fraternall company / in promising
(...) for to fail unto the death departed them / for considering y^ will of
their lord / that kept them both so rychely / and put in their understanding
that it should be impossyble that ever their great love should fail. The king
and the queen and all the barons of the country / seeing the two children so
perfyte fellows togyde^ / and love ^o inwardly were gretely reioysed / and
thanked our lord thereof with mylde hertes / if I name them perfyte with out
any defaute blame me not / nor meruayll you not of it / for certainly of beauty
/ bounte prudence / and humylyte / that ought to be in any noble heart / was in
tho two noble men. They may dysportes among the knights and squyres and
among ladies and damoyselles / as in dauncynge / and diverse other games they
found none that might pass them / as for dysportes that be used by noble men
in time of peace / as at t^nnys / lepe / spring / wrestle / cast the stone /
cast the bar^e / or any other games / none would compare with them two. And
brye^^y all thing that they applied them to / became them well As unto the
regard of Iustes / and tourneymentes / it was defended them by the king their
fader / because y^ they were to tender of aege as at that time.
Notwithstanding when the king saw that they were puyssaunt enough for to
welde armor at their ^ase he gave them license for to do cry a Iustynge / and
a turneyment. The which Olyuer / and Arthur made for to be cried / that three
auenturous knights should Iu^e against all comers / the which should find
the^ there the first day of the lus^y month of may in complete harneys /
for to Just against their adversaries / with sharp speres / and the said three
champyons should Just.iij. days in three colors / that is to wete / in black
/ gray / and vyolet / and their sheldes of the same hew / and them to find on
the third day at the lystes. There Iusted diverse young knights of the kings
court. And the Iustynge was more asperer of those young knights tha^ ever
they had seen any in that country / and by the report of the ladies they did
so knyghtly euerychone y^ it was not possible for to do better as them thought
by their strokes. But above all other Olyuer and Arthur his loyal fellow had
the bruyte and loos. The Iustynge endured long / it was meruayll to se the
hydeous strokes that they delte / for the Iustynge had not fynysshed so sone /
but that the night separed them / nevertheless the adversary party abode till
the torches were light. But the ladies and damoyselles / that of all the
Iustynge time had been there were weary / and would depart / wherefore the
Iusters departed in like wise / and went and dysarmed them for to come to the
banquet or feast / and when that the banquet was fynysshed and done / the
daunces began. And there came the king and ye valiant knights of arms /
for to inquire of the ladies / and damoyselles who that had best borne hy^ as
for that day. The ladies which were all of one accord / and agreement / said
that Olyuer and Arthur had su^mou^ted all y^ best doers of that Iourneye. And
because that Olyuer / and Arthur were both of one party / and that they could
find but little dyffere^ce between them of knyghthode / they knew not the
which they might sustain. But in the end they said that Arthur had done
right valyauntly / nevertheless they said that Olyuer had done best / unto
their semynge. And therefore it was concluded that the price should be given
unto Olyuer / as for the best of them of within. And another noble knight of
the realm of Algarbe / that came with the queen had the price of without /
wha^ the price of the Iustes that had been made / was brought before Olyuer
by two fair damoyselles he waxed all read and was as ashamed at that present
time and said that (...) was of their bounte for to give him the price and not
of his deserte / nevertheless he received it / and as it was of custom in
guerdonnynge them be kyssed them. And sone after they brought the wine and
spyces / and then the daunces and the feast took an end as for that night.

How the queen of Castyll began to be amourous of her sone Olyuer of folysshe
love and dyshonest. Capitulo. vi.


THe two young me^ after that the feast was fynysshed / and the leave taken /
they went unto their chamber. Olyuer thinking that he would not be content
with that price. And Arthur on the other side said that he would do so much if
he might / that another time he might get the price / but not for envy of
the honor of his fellow. But good courage and good will caused him to have
those thoughts. On the other party the king allredy entered in to his chamber
for to go unto his rest / the queen also thought excessyuely on the feast that
she had seen the day tofore. And in especyall on the two young knights was
all her thought. Of the which the one of them was her own sone / the which
ye may think did not dysplease her / and said unto herself. Lady Mary what
dure and aspre strokes I have seen the^ give and receive to day. How gentylly
it became the kings sone Olyuer for to dance / and the clothing that he ware
/ certes that lady or damoysell should be well happy y^ he would love. In these
thoughts she went to bed and fell on sleep / but that was not but yt she
thought in her sleep that she saw him dance all about the chamber. that had
pleased her so much the day before. So began the queen for to enter in to so
great a folly that it never left her / and that was great pity and dommage as
ye shall here afterward. The day spronge / and at the hour that they were
accustomed for to rise in the court / Olyuer and his fellow Arthur arose and
made them ready in the same wise that they were accustomed / and in that estate
they went in to the kings court. When the queen saw them / she made them
better semblaunce / and better chere than she shas wont to do / and called

between her tethe. Olyuer my friend I think that god has made you for to be
looked on in this world. Olyuer herd it well / and meruaylled hy^ much
wherefore she said it / for he wys^ not whether she said it for good / or for
evil / nevertheless he put it in oubly / and thought no more upon it.

How the queen gave Olyuer for to understand yt she loved him / and that she
desired for to sin with him And how olyuer answered her covertly / and all to
honor. Capitulo. vij.


BY space of time this passed over / nevertheless Olyuer was not ashamed to be
among ladies / and damoyselles / and was never weary of Iustynge and turneynge
/ or other feats of arms that apperteyned to any noble prince. And when that
he knew of any great assemble / he would not have failed but that he would
have been there^ whether that he had been far or nere / and therefore every body
had great Joy of him / and said it was a great reioysynge to the king of
Castyll the which was already far altered in aege for to se his only sone and
heir so replenysshed in all virtuous operacyons / but fortune the which is
maystresse of all aduersyte and sorrows aduychylled his co^solacyon / and
separed from him his elect welfare by ye queen his wife. The which be
holding the gift of grace that nature had given him so fair a child / she
was so taken with his love that it is meruayll to recounte it / for when she
was by herself in any secret place alone / as in her bed / or else where
she said full often. Ha a Olyuer right fair creature y^ treasoure of my
thoughts. Iowe well for to curse thy resplendysshynge beauty / for I am
constrained for thy excellence to do the thing that never queen did / for I
must habandon the love of my lord / and husband for thine. And if that thou
have not compassyon upon me the surplus of my days shall be in anguyssh and
dolor In this wise the queen complained so long / that Olyuer and his fellow
came for to se her. Whom she received with Joyous semblaunt. And when any
person axed her wherefore she showed more sign of amyte to olyuer than she
did to Arthur her own sone / she said that she did it for to please the
king y^ better with all She took Olyuer by the hand and made him by force for
to sytte down beside her. And began for to deuyse with him of diverse matters /
and among other deuyses she demanded him by the faith of his body / if that
he were not amorous of some fair lady. And he said nay And then she said unto
him Olyuer my love. I can not byl^ue that the which ye have spoken. And
therefore I require you that ye tell me the truth in what place she remains
that is so eurous for to be your lover. Madame answered Olyuer / in good faith
she has none a bydynge. For there is so many excellent ladies in this realm
/ that I can not tell the which I may love. And also I doubt to be refused.
Wherefore madame I know well that ye do but mock with me / for she should be
but a little happy for to have my love. For I am not a man that as yet has
done any thing / whereof I ought to inquire any lady of love. And therefore
unto this hour I have not done so much / nor won / wherefore I ought to be
content. The queen herynge the answer of y^ young knight / was sore abashed.
For the more that she devised with him / the more she found him constaunt and
ferme in his purpose / and always she continued in her folly / in so much that
Olyuer apperceyued a part of her will and desire. Wherefore he held his peace
and spoke not so much as he had done before. And she seeing that she spoke no
more said unto him. My friend if any great maystresse required you of love /
would ye refuse her / certes madame said he. I am not so happy / nor no woman
so folysh / for to require me of love / and therefore there is none answer.

How Olyuer departed sore troubled of the requests that his stepmoder had made
to him. And how ye he prayed to our lord / for to revoke her from her folys^^
/ and corrupt volente. Capitulo. viij.


OLyuer that was not well pleased for to be in such deuyses with his fair
mother / made to his fellow a sign that he should call him the which did so
/ and said. My brother the hour passes that we should go there as ye wot of /
and therefore I put you in remembrance. Olyuer answered that it was true. And
then he took his leave of the queen / the which did strain his fyngres
together at the departing Olyuer was tha^ right dyspleasau^t because that he
knew her in such estate / but he durst make ^o semblau^t unto his fellow /
for dread and fere / that he would have been to dysplesaunt. So as they were out
of the queen's chamber / the queen drew herself aparte in to a little garderobe
/ and let herself fall upon a bed / and said unto her self. My love ye be
not so folysshe / but that ye know thaffayre in the which I am oppressyd /
and certainly it shall not be left thus / for to morrow ye shall have knowledge
of all my sorrow / and disease And also Olyuer upon that other side / was in
great thought as well as y^ queen his stepmoder was / for when he was in his
lodgys / he went in to his chamber all alone / where as he did say knelynge
/ My blessed creator thou have formed me unto thy semblaunce / and have given
me indygne more beauty than I am worthy for to have / the which shall because
of my destruccyon / if that thou by thy grace put not (...) Wherefore I pray
the that thou wouchesauf for to keep the honor of my fader / and me / and that
I be not occasyon of the evil will / wherein I se her at this present time /
for I will not accord thereto for to deye. And therefore I require you with
humble heart that it will please y^ for to take her out of that dampnable
opinion / and that thou reduce / an bring her into such estate / and will /
that as a good and loyal spouse / she may keep her toward her husband.

How the queen yet again declared her courage to Olyuer / the which was /
that she would that he should do her dysordynate will / and ye fair answers
that Olyuer gave her. Capitulo. ix.


ON the morrow after that Olyuer was come^ in to his faders court / about the
hour of dinner / he durst not leave his old custom / the which was / for to
go and vysyte the queen / and also to the end that none should apperceyue his
affayre. In contynent as he had salued her / he withdrewe him in to the
thyckest prees of the ladies / because that he would not be alone with the
queen his stepmoder / but that auaylled him but little / For the queen without
any shame went and fetched hy^ again / and took him by the hand / saying
that she would speak with hy^. And by forse whether he would or not she made
him for to sytte down by her. And satte thynky^ge / and musing a great while
/ and said never a word. Wha^ the queen saw that he said never a word / she
was half ashamed and changed color / and said to him. My love have ye no
remembrance of the deuyses that we had together. Truly madame said Olyuer. My
memory is so small / that I have retained but little / or naught. Ha my sweet
heart said the queen I suppose y^ your understanding is not so dull / to
forgete in so short space / that the which is said unto you But I apperceyue
by your langage / that ye know my mind better than I can record it to you.
Madame I wot not what ye would say. Certainly said she my love / to y^ end
that ye know it. I tell you that I will be yours. And therefore I give me unto
you all holly. It is not of new that ye be lord over me / and of my will /
But fere / and shame has caused me to keep it close by long space of time.
Nevertheless all doubts put abacke I put you in memory that I am not of your
ky^red so nere / but hat ye may do all your pleasure with me / as ye would do
to your lady and love / and I also of you in like wise / where through we may
have inco^preable Joy and solace together. And if that my fortune be so unhappy
/ that my request be not vttred I shall occyse myself And therefore my love /
in you lies my life and my death when Olyuer understood this / he was more
abashed than ever he was before / and said unto her in this wise Madame where
as ye say that ye love me I thank you hertly and as for that / that ye name
you my lover / it can not be no gretter than it is as for my part / for as
unto my mother / and maystresse / there is no service but that I will do it at
your commandment / as I am bound for to do. I can not think that ye be so
chyldysshe that ye would love me otherwise than a good mother should / and ought
to love her child. For I hold my self for such one / that I had lever deye
than for to do any thing that were contrary to the honor of the king my
fader And if that I did otherwise / the hour of my birth ought well to be
cursed.

How Olyuer refused all the requests of his fair stepmoder. And how she
menased him unto the death. Capitulo. x.
THe queen right furyously / and Irefully brake his words in sayng. Olyuer
cursed be thy beauty / when y^ thou art so eleuate in pride / to refuse such
a queen as I am / but fro hens forth / ye name of a friend y^ was given to the
by me / and that has been fyxed in the profou^denesse of my secret thoughts
/ and also ye reioycynge of my heart / by thy great outragyous cruelte shall be
turned in to great amerenes. For I shall name the my mortal enemy / as one
that is a destroyer / and sleer of ladies. For thou art a murderer of me / and
shall be cause of my death / and that right shortly. But it shall not be with
out the. For in all the manners / and facyons that can be / unto me possible I
shall abredge thy life. For me thinks that it is reason sith that I must dye
for the / and ye thou art cause of my death / that thou be parteyner of my
dolor and anguysshe / notwithstanding I pray to our lord that he pardo^ne
the / the innumerable evil les that by the are lykly for to befall. And then
she said unto him. Arise of my quysshen / and go thy way / for it is
impossyble to me / for to be here in the presence of the people / without that
my sorrow shall be apperceyued / Olyuer arose and took his leave of the queen /
the which went in to a little chamber / where as she demeaned her sorrow so
meruaylously that it were impossyble for to ^ecounte / and tell it. Olyuer
went toward the king and salued him. So after that he had been there a while
he went unto his place / and his fellow with him / which knew full well that
his brother made not so good chere as he was accustomed for to do / and
demanded him what meuyd him / that he was so sad. And when he saw that he
would not tell him / he thought in himself that he would not demand him no
more / lest that he should be dyspleased with him. All that day Olyuer a bode
in this chamber / and for to cover the better his dyspleasure / he made his men
for too understand that he was not well at ease / and that he was a little
dysmayde For the which thing his fellow Arthur was right do lent / and
sorrowful / but it was impossyble to him for to amend it / this
notwithstanding / he would not depart from him / but after so^per Olyuer
required him y^ he would go toward the king / and the ladies for that night.
And that he would keep him without making any mensyon of his sykenes / and
that at his coming again he should find hy^ a bed. So at the request of
his brother he was content for to goo / and said to him / My good brother Olyuer
it is your will that I shall go in to the court / and because that it shall be
late or that I come again / and that I might happen awake you I hid you good
night. And I pray god give you go ^e rest so that your sykenesse may to morrow
be aledged And told him that he would not lie with him ye night Then Olyuer
embrased him / with the teres in his eyes and said to Arthur that he abode over
long. Arthur apperceyued the teres in his eyes / wherefore he was sore
abashed. For he knew hy^ for such a man / that he dyscomforted him not for a
little thing / nevertheless he made no semblaunt / but departed with great
lame^tacy on. Alas if he had known whereon his fellow did thy^ke / his sorrow
would have doubled / for he saw him not after unto the time that they had
both suffered many aduersytees / as ye shall here more plainly afterward.



How Olyuer abode all alone in his chamber / where as he made diverse
complayntes / and lamentacyons / and of the lettre that he wrote unto his
fellow Arthur / and at what thing he should have knowledge / if he had any
evil adventure. Capitulo. xi.
AS Olyuer saw that he was left alone / and that his loyal fellow was gone /
he abode al pensyf / and sad. And said unto his chamberlayne that he would go
unto bed / and y^ he should make every body to avoid for that night. And
badde his chamberlayne that he should make prouysyon of paper / and ynke. So
when every body was departed / and that there was no moo left with in the
chamber but his chamberlayne / he made him ready and went to bed. And then he
badde his chamberlayne that he should go his way for that night / for there is
one that will lie with me / the which will not be known. The chamberlayne
did his lords commandment / and departed / and shytte the door after him.
And when that Olyuer saw that every body was avoided / there is no heart may
think / nor express / the innumerable lamentacyo^s that he made. And first
of all the great goods / and honor / that in that country he had received.
And after / for the right bitter dolor that for his sake were lykly for to
come / as well unto the king his fader / as unto his fellow / and in general
al them of the ky^ges court / where as he was so derely byloued This
notwithstanding he concluded in himself that he would depart habandonnynge
lands / possessions / and honors / saying that the worldly honors / were
nothing in comparyson of the spyrytuelles / y^ which has never end / and
said that he ought not for to keep his carcas so deyntely / that was ordained
in this world for to be worms mete / as his honor and his soul / the which
should be tormented in hell / if that he would believe the dampnable opinion of
his fair mother. He thought in himself that it were better for him for to
depart be times / than over late / for he had no more trust nor confydens in
the queen / seeing and considering y^ words that she had said unto him. Then
he took the paper and the ynke / and began for to write a lettre the which
adressyd unto his fellow. In the which after y^ gretynges and salutacyons /
made as amyably as any might be made / he put in y^ lettre that for certain
causes he was departed from the court in praynge him right debonayrly that he
would pardon him of that that he had not aduertysed him of his departing / for
certay^ly it had been impossyble unto him / for to have departed in his
presence. And this notwithstanding if that he were far from his syghte / yet
he should not be longed from his heart / for in what country / or in what place
that ever he were / he would hold him for his good brother / and friend / and
that never on his side he would forgete hy^ Afterward he prayed him that he
would make his recommendacyons right humbly unto his fader the king and the
queen / and unto all them the which should demand after him. And then he
wrote above. My brother because that I wot never wha^ I shall se you again. I
leave with you this little glass / the which is full of clear water as ye may
see / and I pray you that ye look every day ones upon it for my love / for if
I have any evil adventure / that water that is in the glass shall become all
black / and that shall sygnyfye that I am (...) some evil adventure or
empesshement. And then my loyal brother and faithful fellow I beseech you that
for the great love and amyte / that we have ^ad together that if so happen /
that ye will depart from the court of my fader and never rest till that ye

trust / above all them in the world. Of her thing my brother I wot not what
to write to you / but that ye may be sure that I shall deye yours. I pray to
our lord Ihesu christ / that he give you asmoche good / and grace / as my
heart desires. Amen.

both booted / and sporred / and his sword by his side / he went in to his
stable at the hour of mydnyght when that every body was retrayed unto their
ynnes / for it was a place all alone a good way from the kings court / and
at that time there dwelled no body nor none of his servants / and at that
time / there was no war in the realm of Castyll / but all peace / and
therefore he might the better / and the more secretly do his will / so he took
a horse the which that semyd him best / and sadled him / and then he lepte upon
him / but that was not / but that before his departing / he put the lettre and
the glass in his chamber in the most redyest place to his semynge / and there
as it might sonest be found. And also he had taken a little purse / in the
which he had put a thousand nobles / and other little bags that were not of
so great value / but what of silver / and other thing / they were worth as
much. He found the gate of his place open / and the king at that time was in
a place / where as no gates were shytte. Olyuer rode forthand exployted so
much with his ease / and also with the fair light of the moon / that he
passed the town lyghtely. And when that Olyuer was a little passed the town
heretorned his right heauteous vysage toward the place where as he had been

HEre above ye have herd of the departing of the noble Olyuer / sone of the
King of Castylle. When it was day / erly in y^ morning his servants came
to his chamber for to be at his vprysynge / as they were accustomed. And when
that they were comen theder they found the guard of his person without the
door / wherefore they meruaylled gretely. In the mean while that they abode
before the door / and that the hour of dinner approached nere / his first
chamberlayne came / and found this company before the chamber door / the which
as yet had not entered in to the chamber whereof he was abashed meruaylously /
and demanded what tidings / and said to him that Olyuer had bydden the
evening before that they should depart / and axed hy^ why he was (...) over

squyers of his chamber that have the keys of that door / in the same wise as
Olyuer had / for they twain had never but one chamber / and made to open the
chamber door / and after entered all alone / and shytte the door after him. As soon as he was in the chamber / the first thing that he ^yde / was that he
went straight unto the bed where as he found nobody / wherefore he was ^ore
abashed And began for to search all about / as well at y^ draught as
elleswhere, And when he saw that he could not find him / he was so

ALl the noble men of the court that abode at Olyuers chamber door seeing that
they had no tidings of Arthur / that was entered in to the chamber / made it
for to be known to the king their fader / and the first chamberla^^^ of
Olyuer said unto him. My sovereign lord your sone Olyuer was yesterdaye a
little dyseased / and made to avoid all the gromes of his chamber / and abode
all alone. And yet at this hour all the grome of his chamber / was without the
door / the which be not as yet entered. And as touching my part I have
knocked at the chamber door / but there was no body that answered me. Also my
lord Arthur his brother not long ago / is entered / but we have had no more
tidings of him than before. And therefore I put you in memory of these things
/ for to do therewith your good pleasure. Then the king said y^ he would go
theder in his person for to know what it might sygnefye. And came unto ye
chamber door / y^ which was locked / but he made it to be opened / and entered
in to the chamber with little company / And incon^ynent as he saw not his sone
Olyuer upon his bed / he doubted well that there was some what y^ would not
please him to much. And as he looked here / and there / he (...) Arthur that
was ^yenge upon y^ (...) tha^ alive / and as yet he was (...). And when the
king apperc^^^ (...) he said unto him. My friend I trow that thou know

here all that the lettre contained / for when that he entered in to the matter
where as it spoke of the departing of his sone / as hye as he stood he let
himself fall down to the earth. It was great pity to have been in the chamber /
for they wist not to whom they might attend / either to the fader / or to the
brother / or to the servants for all y^ when he might speak he a^^ryed and
said. O right miserable king / wherefore does not god send to the the death /
truly nothing should be to me (...) the death / nor nothing so dyspleasaunt

IN such words so semblables / led the right ^olent king and the queen /

Nevertheless a little while after the king went saying. Alas my friends /
(...) this poor / and desolute king / and fader the which has lost all his
Joy / that is his sone / (...) I beseech you euerycho^e / to put you on the
way for to here some tytynges of him / or if that it be possible for to find
him / for whom I have so much dolor / and anguysshe. Then the most part of
them departed at the commandment of the king / and put them upon the way /
and for to make short process / they were in so many places / and countrees
/ that it is meruayl to recounte it. And nevertheless they herd no tidings
that were any thing pleasant in that behalf. And therefore they returned
toward the king / unto whom they told all that they had found. And when he
knew that his loss was incurable / he laid him down in his bed all
melancolyous. They that beheld hy^ / thought y^ he would never have risen from
the^s the queen seeing the great maladye of the king / and al so knowing that
all these euylles proceeded from her / y^ great furour / and anger of the night
before / was changed in to pity / sorrow / and dyspleasure / saying thus. O
unhappy and cursed woman thou art cause of the exyle and loss / of the most
fairest / the most gentle / the most wise and the most knyghtely that ever
was in Castylle / thy desteny ought well to be cursed / and who yt knew thy
case / they ought to punysshe ye right bitterly. Alas my right fair love
Olyuer / and my right dear heart for to be drawn with horses / and for to
suffer martyrdom / it is impossyble for me to amend the dyspleasure and
iniurye that by me has been spoken unto you / as she that was not maystresse
of herfelfe / but was subgecte by my fragylyte to wrath / not knowing thy
great bounte and loyalte / and because that thy loss is vncouerable / and that
it proceeds from me / and of my cause / never shall I have Joy. And as
infortuned I shall use y^ surplus of my life in praynge our lord that he will
keep thy right fair yongth from all encomberaunce. Who that would tell the
complayntes of them of the country / it would be to long to tell it / and
therefore I hold my peace / and reforneth to Olyuer.

English knight were preserved from drownynge. Capitulo. xvi.


WE have suffycyently herd spoken here before of the departing that Olyuer
made / that was sone and heir of the king of Castyll / And how be put him
upon the sea / where as he was two mo^thes / or there about. It be fell upon a
night that a tempest / and meruaylous orage took them / wherefore it was force
to the shypmen for to habandonne their ship at the pleasure of god / unto
whom they recommaunded them full often / as they that abode but his mercy. In
that estate they were the space three days / in right great torment. And the
tempest was so hydeous / and terryble / that upon the third day their ship
stroke on ground / by so great force that it claue in two pyeces / and all
were perysshed except Olyuer / and sir Johan Talbot. Which seeing land / the
which was not far of / took some comfort. For when they saw that their
ship was cloven / and that all their felysshyp were perysshed / they said that
it was better that they put themself for to swymme / for to save their life as
long as it might be possible. And therefore each of them in making the sign
of the cross / and recommaundynge them in the keeping of our lord / le^te in
to the sea / and began for to swymme / trusting for to save themself / the
which was impossyble for them / if that our lord had not extended his grace /
for they were swymmynge so long / that there was neither of the^ but that he
lacked breath / and were at the point to have been lost. And also the water was
so cold / and so aspre that if they had suffered none other evil / it had been in oughe for to have deyed. And in that estate they lenthed not far the
one from the others / and required our lord with all their hertes of his mercy
/ and grace / and that he would have pity on them / for they trusted never to
have escaped Nevertheless our lord that ever purueyeth for his true
servants / scute them socour / for they were all abashed when that that saw
by them a white heart / the which Olyuer took by the hor^^s / and mounted on
his back. Talbot the which was not far from him / gate up behind Olyuer.
And in y^ estate the heart bare them to the land / and then he vanysshed away
/ and then either of them as well as they might have lauds and thankynges to
god / that of his infynyte grace had preserved them / and this done they
enforced the^ for to go unto a little place / the which was not far from ye
see side. This place was a gentylmans of the country / and when he saw them
in that plyte / he had great pity on them. And made them a good fire / and
warmed / and chaffed them right well / and laid them in a soft bed. And he
did to them all the pleasure that he could. And when that they were a little
amended / he demanded them how they were escaped. And they recou^ted to him
all y^ danger / and peril that they had been in / and how that god of his
endless grace had saved them by miracle / Whereof their host had great
meruayll. Notwithstanding he byleued them right well / for he wist well that
there was nothing impossyble to god / whereby we may have always memory hereof
/ to the end that if we find our self in any danger / or peril by fortune /
and also to the occasyon for to flee sin / for wha^ a sinner gothe to commyt
sin / and remembers the mercy / and puyssaunce of god / and deuoutely
reclaymeth the aid of our lord. Then god permytteth / and gives them such
comfort / that they ben delivered from all temptacyon as to the purpose of
these two / the which he preserved from the peril of the sea.

How the knight that was Olyuers fellow deyed / and of that the which happened
after his death. Capitulo. xvij.
Right as they devised. Olyuer demanded in what country they were in. And
they told him that it was England. Whereof the knight that was with Olyuer /
was much reioysed / notwithstanding that he was sore syke. And inquired of
his host if he knew not a knight that was called sir Ioha^ Talbot. He
answered / that he had often herd speak of such one / but he never saw him /
but he saed that his pryncypall abydyng was in Caunterburye / as they said all
about / and said that he was but twenty mile from thens. Then the syke
knight said unto him / blessed be god that has brought us he there / for I am
that same sir Johan Talbot / that I spered after before / and my dwelling is in
the cite of Cau^terburye. And because that I know that without the mercy of
god I am never like to releue of my maladye and also that I feel my death
approaches. I beseech you that ye make me to be carried to Caunterbury / to the
end that I may make my testament / and ordynaunces as a good christian man. And
ye shall be well recompensed. Olyuer seeing this knight so grievously vexed
with that maladye / he was right pensyf / and sorrowful / as he y^ which knew
not whether for to goo / or resort. And then the gentle Olyuer said unto him.
My lord / and my friend I am right dyspleasau^t of your maladye / and because
that I have found with you so good company I shall never habandon you / if
that it please you / till y^ time that I have seen as our lord will expose
your sykenes / for as for my part I thank god that I am all guarysshed / and
in good point / and ready ^or to mount on horsbarke / for to conueye you
whether that ye please The knight thanked him full humbly / and said that al
his vole^te was for to go there as he had specyfyed / and that he required none
other thing / and all was at the dyspence of his host / and would take
nothing of them And then he was carried in a horse bear to his place / and
Olyuer rode with him / but he lived not long after he was comen in to his
place / and his friends made great sorrow for him / but after his death they
showed hy^ but little sign of amyte / because of money that he ought te a
burgeys of the cite / he was in the sentence of cursynge / unto the time that
the burgeys were contended / and he had been the space of seven year in that
sentence / as he the which had not whereof to pay / but if that he should have
sold right largely of his gods / for to have paid his debt withal / and in
such estate he deyed / wherefore the burgeys was not content but if that he
were paid that the knight were put in holy ground / but his heirs seeing
this concluded / and loved better for to burye him in the profane / and
unhallowed ground / tha^ for to pay his derte / as they the which loved not
ye souls o^ their friends / so well as they did the goods moundaynes.

How Olyuer made the knight for to be buried / and of the Iustes that were
publysshed in England / the which was this / that who that did best should
have ye fair Helayne in marriage / that was the kings daughter. Capitulo.

OLyuer seeing the great falste / and auaryce of the friends of that deed body
/ was no thing well content with them. He did all the dylygence that he
might that he were buried / as well toward him that he ought the good to / as
to them that should pay it / too the end that the knight the which he had
known in his life / for a good / and a virtuous man / might be buried in holy
ground / but it was impossyble for him to find any appoyntement / for the
knights frend^s would not do nothing. And the burgeys said that he would do
nothing except that he were paid all alonge / that which was his duete.
Olyuer seeing that there would be none other thing / inquired what the some of
ye death did draw to. And found that it drew to a.lx. pound. not
withstanding that during his vyage he had spente a good part of his.M.
nobles / that he had but left alytell more than half / yet he was delybered
for to content the burgeysland paid him. And also he made the service of the
knight right honorably / for which cause he was much praised of every body /
and to the contrary the friends of the deed body / was much blamed as it was
right. Olyuer the which had but a little money left / soiourned a little
space of time in Caunterburye / where as he herd tytynges that the king of
England / at the instaunce of his subgectes had made a cry of a torneyment /
that should last three days. And theder might come all noble men. And he that
should do best by the saying of the princes / and pryncesses / the which was
commysed thereto / should have his only daughter in marriage / if that she had
will unto him. The which daughter at that present time / was holden for ye
most fairest lady that was in all the monarchye of the world. And the King
her fader would not mary her to no great prince / because he would not have
her lenthed fro him. For he loved her so fervently / that he could make no good
chere / y^ day that he saw her not. Also he did think that for the welfare
of the country / it was more necessary for to give her to a hardy / and a
valiant man / thought that he were poor / than to a great lord / that had
not those virtues. And also as touching noblesse and r^^chesse / she had
enough for the^ both / and for that cause he had made cry the tor^eyme^t /
that the most valyauntest of the feast / should have his right beauteuous and
fair daughter in marriage. And that after his decesse / his kingdom might
fall in to the hands of the valiant knight / and lord / for to keep and
defend it from all them that would grieve it. There were four ho^dred knights
commysed of within for to resyste against all comers. And it was.xi. months
sith that the feast had be^ publysshed thrughe all the realms christian. This
not withstanding until that time Olyuer had herd no tidings thereof / and
there was no more but.xv. days to the corneyment / wherefore Olyuer had great
dyspleasure / because that him thought that he might not come theder sone
enough / and also because that he had but little money for to go theder
withal Nevertheless he made hymredy for to be there / in the best wise that
he might / if that our lord sent him not some empesshement / that he could
not go. And fro that hour he began for to feel the sparcles of love / and
said to himself that he should be well eurous if that after his great
aduersyte and euylles he might attain unto so hye a thing as for to have her
in marriage / of whom he herd speak so much good / thrughe the universal
world.

How Olyuer was assaylled by thieves / and slew them / and of that which
happened him upon his way toward London. Capitulo. xix.


OLyuer having right great desire and will for to be with the other at the
tornaymente aforesaid / considering that ye term was short / paid and
contended his host / and after departed from the cite of Caunterbury / all
alone withouten any company toward the cite of London. Where as the great /
and solemn feast / should be holden. And therefore diverse great lords were
comen theder all ready. And there came so many that all the lodgings / and
ynnes were full. So as Olyuer exployted him so on his Iourneye that he was a
good dele auaunged / as he the which thought that he should never come theder
time enough / for to se her for whose love he took that Iourneye / and so he
passed on his way in such thoughts / and in those thoughts he came into a
little busshy wodde / somewhat out of his hye way / and he had not long gone
therein / when he met.xv. thieves the which were armed in complete harnays /
and cried to him saying that he was but deed / and he was enuyronned with them
or ever he looked up / and left his pen sees of love. And when he saw that he
could not escape without medlynge / he set his hand to his sword and smote
one of them upon the heed so asprely / that he claue him to the tethe / and so
fell down deed. And than he smote on the right hand / and on the left hand
/ so impyteously that he cut arms / and hedes / in a such wise / that the
hardyest of them durst not abide him a buffet / for he had set his back
against a thycke hedge / so that his enemies might not endommage him behind
And for to make it short he did so much by the help of god / that he
slew.xi. of them / and the remenau^t fledso^e wounded. When Olyuer saw that
he was delivered of them / he thanked god of that vyctorye / and alyghted of
his horse / and tayde him to a tree / and then he began for to bind some of his
wounds / in the best wise that he might / but they were not mortal / whereof
he gave thanky^ges to god. And so as he took keep to his wou^des / his horse
brake loose / for he had not tayed him fast. And so went away with his casket
of money the which was at the arson of the sadell / and was gone all ready a
good way or ever Olyuer apperceyued him. Nevertheless when that the
apperceyued him / he began for to run after him as well as he might / and
Olyuer ran so long / and so fast / that he was al^moost bretheles. And in
that estate the horse came rennynge bofore the place where one of the thieves was
hid / that had escaped from Olyuer. And when the said thief saw the horse /
he knew him well enough / and ran after him / and took him / and
incontynente mounted upon his back / and rode his way with casket and all.
When Olyuer apperceyued him / he knew well enough y^ he had lost his horse /
and his casket with money / wherefore ye may well think that he was right
dysplesaunt / for he found himself without money / and also in a strange
country / where as he had no knowledge / and when he saw that all was lost /
he said to himself. O good sweet lord Ihesu christ I require y^ comfort this
poor unhappy catyf / for all mine esperaunce and hope is only in the for I se
well that fortune is contrary to me / and that if it proceed not of thyn
infynyte grace / mine enterprise can never be encheued / wherefore good lord I
put me totally in to thy grace and mercy. In praynge the good lord Ihesu christ
that thou dystinge it after thyn own will / for lightly I can not have worse
than I have had hitherto / whereof I thank the.

How a knight came for to comfort Olyuer / and of y^ promesses that they had
together. Capitulo. xx.


Right so as Olyuer complained him of his mysauenture / there came a man to him
the which plucked him by the slew diverse times saying. Olyuer of Castylle be
nothing abashed because that I take you out of your thought Olyuer lift up
his heed when he herd his name pronounced / and wist not whether that he had
dremed it / or not / and as all abashed in making the sign of the cross
said unto him. I conjure the in the name of god that thou do me no harm / and
that thou tell me who gave the knowledge of my name. The man that seemed both
fair and reverent said. My friend have no doubt of me / for I am a christian
man / and byleueth as well in god as thou do / and meruayll the not if that
I know thy name / for thou ought to know that ye feldes has sight / and
every wood has sown. I know yt thy dyspleasure has adnychylled thyn
understanding for and thou had thought on thy fayte / thou would not have made
thy complaynt so hye / for I have herd all yt thou have said / and how thou
have will for to goo to the torneyment that shall be holden at London within
this six days. Also how thou have ben dysmou^ted and lost thy money. I am
beholden unto you for some service and pleasure that thy most nerest friends
has done unto me / therefore I am he that will aid the for to accomplys^he
thy good and high enterprise / in praynge our savior / that he will give the
grace well for to fyenysshe it / and but if it hold at the I shall furnysshe
the of armor / and of horses / so well that it shall suffyce the But it shall
be on such a condycyon / that thou shall promise me that of all that thou
shalt win by occacyon of the torneyment half / if it be my pleasure to
demand it / and take it. Olyuer seeing the offer that the knight made him /
said unto him as evil auysed of afterclaps My friend if the hour be such /
and that my fortune will consent that thou do to me this pleasure. I promise
yt upon the part that I trust to have of paradyse / that if any good come to
me by occasyon of thy service / that y^ shalt be perteyner of the Just half /
or of the grettest part / if it were his pleasure for to demand it. At these
words the knight answered / it suffyseth / and prayed him that he would
remember him when time would require it. And after those words were fynysshed
the noble knight said unto him. Mine own special friend Olyuer meruayll the
of nothing of that that thou see but keep always this little path that thou
fyndest on the right hand / and thou shall find an hermytage / and there
thou shall have tidings of me / but I go theder / but there I shall fetch the
when time is / so they departed / and Olyuer went on his way / and prayed the
knight to remember him.

How Olyuer came in to the hermytage / and of the la^gage that he had with the
holy hermyte / of whom he was confessed. Capitulo. xxi.


IN a little while Olyuer had lost the sight of his knight / and wist not
where he became / for all that he forgate not to hold the way that he had
showed him / and so exployted him that he came to the hermytage with ^ay / but
he found the door shytte / wherefore he knocked so long that y^ good hermyte
the which was in his orysons came and opened the door / and was all abashed /
for he was not a customed to open the door at that time a day. When Olyuer
apperceyued the hermyte / he salued him / and y^ good man rendered him his
salute In demanding hy what aue^ture brought him theder at that time a day
And Olyuer answered him. My fair fader I pray you that I may be your geste
and clerk for this night / for I know none other place here about / where as
I might go to. And then the holy man said unto him. My friend the house and the
goods that god has given me be at your commandment. Then Olyuer entered into
ye chapel / and souped with the hermyte / that gave him bread and water
enough / in saying to him / Sir ye be not used to such vy^aylles / but and ye
had said Saint Iulyans pater noster / ye had found better lodging /
notwithstanding take it in pacyente / for and I had better / ye should have
better / but beware that ye swear not. In such words or semblables / was
Olyuer occupied the most part of the night. And when it was time they went
to rest / but Olyuer slepte not so well nor so long in the morning / as if he
had layne on a fether bed. When the gentyil Olyuer apperceyued the day he
arose / and aided the hermyte for to say mass / the same mass did Olyuer
here with great deuocyo^ / and after that the mass was fynysshed / he
confessed him to y^ holy hermyte / and among other things he recou^ted unto
him of the knight that he had found in the forest / and how that he had
called him by his name. The holy hermyte assayed him saying. My fair brother
and friend / ye say that all y^ salutacyons that he has made unto you /
has been in gods name / for and it had been any thing else but good / he
would not have sent you hither in to this holy place / notwithsta^dynge that I
am indygne. Wherefore me seems that ye can not do evil for to give credence to
it. It is parauenture a knight of this country that has understand your
case / as he has told you / by occasyon that ye spoke so hye / And the best
counsayll that I can give you is to remyt you in the holy guard of our saueour
/ and require him that he will defend you from all evil / and from all
yllusyons of the evil enemy.

How Olyuer of Castylle saw come toward him diverse knights and other folk
in great tryumphe and array. Capitulo. xxij.
SO as ye have herd / soiourned Oliver in ye hermytage with the good holy man
by ye espace of three days / or four / and there was no more but two days unto
y^ beginning of y^ torneyment. This hermytage was with in two mile of London.
And when Olyuer went for to dysporte him without the wood he might se the cite
all at full / and the place where as the torneyment should be the which was
all enclosed about / and there he saw them assaye their sadelles / and their
cousers / and in like wise their harneys / wherein he took no great pleasure
because he doubted yt his knight should forgete him And because that the time
was short / he was in great doubt / and repented him sore that he had byleued
hy^ so lightly. And that also in the mean while that he had soiourned in the
hermytage / that he had not gone in to the cite / for to se her for whose love
so many noble men put themself in pain and Ieoperdye / and of whom he had
herd so much good spoken of / but he durst not habandonne the hermytage /
lest that his knight should not find him in defaute / saying that he was not
there as he had appointed him to abide. And in that estate he passed the two
days. And when it came unto y^ day that every gentylman and lord ought for
to be and find himself upon the lystes / and ye may ymagyne in what dolor was
the poor Olyuer. And if that his heart was sorry / and dyspleasaunte / no body
ought to meruayll them / for he stood before the door of the hermytage always
herke^^nge if that his knight came / for there fell not a lefe / but that he
wend that he had comen / he abode so long that he was out of all esperaunce
and hope. And he stood in that estate sore musing / he herd great noise of
ryders among the leaves. And then Olyuer thought that it was some great
gentylman that rode to the torneyment / as the other lords did. And the^ he
kest his regard that way where he herd the noise / And aspyed to the nombre
of fyftene gentylmen clothed in black sa^sene^. And the surplus of their
habyllementes was of the same color / and they were mounted on black coursers
and their coursers were trapped all in black velvet / and each of them had a
spear in his hand / that was covered with black velvet. And then he saw come
after therein ten knights ^abylyed in long gowns of black velvet and furred
with martres / and ^edde after them a courser morell / the which had
^uskynges of clothe of gold up to the belly / and he was en^yronne^ with xv.
pages mounted upon coursers of y^ same color and buskynges of the same color.
And after them was (...) score pages of the same lyue^ay / reserved that it was
clothe.

Of the great Joy that Olyuer had when he saw the fair stedes / and the
rich parementes that his knight had brought to him / and how he armed hy^ /
and of the rich pa^ciyon of the fair Helayne the kings daughter of England
/ and of her beauty. Ca. xxiij.


HIs folk clothed and habylyed as ye have herd before / rode unto the
hermytage and then every body ^oued and abode there all ^oye / and salued
Olyuer that was before y^ bare / and he full gentylly rendered to them their
salute. And as he beheld that fair company / hy^ thought that the knight with
the longest gown was y^ same knight that spoke unto him in the wood / whereof
he was right glad / and went for to salve him / but as soon as the knight
apperceyued him coming he a^yghted of his horse / and came against him / and
after he said to him. Olyuer good friend these me^ that ye se here I have
brought them unto you. And because that we ben comen from far / for to do you
service and honor I pray you that ye do so much at his ^^^neyment that ye
have honor / and that we lose not our pain. Olyuer answered him right
curteysly. My lord and my friend / ye do so much for me / that I can never
render you the guerdon / wherefore such as I am ye may command me / for th^^
^dy is yours / and at this time I can not give you no better thing. I pray to
god that he give me grace for to deserve it against you / and that he give me
strength for to do as well as I have the volente / These words fynysshed y^
knight said to him that it was hye hour for to arm him. And therefore in a
fair grene place y^ was before y^ hermytage / there was a chair brought /
wherein Olyuer set him for to take his refeccyon / and then after they armed him
dylygently In y^ mean while that he armed him / the ladies came in to the
field / and brought with them y^ fair Helayne daughter of the king of
England / and led her in to the pauelyon that for her was ordained / and it
was hanged with tapysserye of clothe of gold right rich / and there was a
chair raised up on hye in ye which chair was.x. steps or that they might
come to ye syege above / over the which was a canape of purple velvet charged
full of great perles oryentales / and had in the mids thereof a Carbuncle /
that rendered so great lumere y^ it was meruayll for to behold it. In the syege
above as I have receyted to you was set the excellent Helayne / And upon each
of the foresaid steps satte two Iuges. That is for to know a prince / and a
pryncesse / echone after his degree. The other ladies and damoyselles the
which was there without nombre / put them in their places / and scaffoldes
that were for the^ ordained / and ensygned. And in like wise on the other side
was a great company of noble and valiant knights and lords of this realm of
England. Ye may well think that it was great tryumphe and great solace for
the men of arms / for to behold so fair a company about the noble / and
excellent Helayne / and every thing so well ordained as that thing was there
/ for her sake / the which was so rychely apparaylled that non^ can not
rehearse the light that the precious stones rendered that were about^ her / the
which embelysshed her excellent vysage. Who that had seen her in that estate
/ he would have thought that she had been a thing of the other world / for I
think that at her nayssau^ce and birth / nature had put all her excellence /
and grace. If that she was semely of body / and excellent of vysage / it was
nothing in comparyson toward the gifts of grace / where with she was endowed
/ for all excellence / and bounte / honor / and hu^blenesse / doulsure / and
swetnesse / and all other virtues and good condycyons that in any woman of
noble lygnage apperteyned / florysshed in her. And therefore she should be right
eurous in this wretched world that might attain unto so high a thing as for
to have for his part ye flower and lyesse of this world. And even thus every
body put himself in pain for to conquer her. And there was not one but that
him seemed that he would conquer her / or else deye in the pain.

Of the great meruaylles that Olyuer did at the torneyment above them all.
Capitulo. xxiii.


ANd then the ladies were not so sone in the scaffoldes / but that the four
hundred knights were upon ye field / ready for to withstand all comers / as ye
have herd before / for the torneyment should last three days. The first day
was ordained for to Just. The second day for to torneye / not as they do now
a days / but with sharp swerdes / and not rebatred. The third day was for to
fight on foot / and every body might have an axe of arms / and a sword about
him. And because that they were many knights / they had great place / they with
out had knowledge that they of within were already at the lystes upon the field /
and all the ladies ready for to behold them which should do best / every
knight put him in deuoyre for to Just the first. Nevertheless Olyuer was not
the first / for there was many there before him As the kings sone of Scotland
/ and diverse kings of Irlonde / and many other princes / and great lords /
the which were so manerly clothed / that it was tryumphe for behold them.
There was but few speres broken before Olyuers coming. And when he was among
the prece he smote his horse with the sporres / and made his horse to torn so
gentylly / that every body looked upon him. And in especyall it pleased the
ladies much his first entering in / sayng that the black knight was best in
point / and the fairest armed of all the place / and after began the Iustes /
and every body put him in pain for to do well. The knight that was Olyuers
governor said unto him / my friend behold upon this scaffolde the fair lady
that ye shall conquer / if that it hold not at you / take good courage / and
think for to do well. And then he took a spear and gave it to Olyuer y^
which took of it no regard / for he had fyxed his syghte upon the excellent
Helayne. And so he had his spear in the rest a great while / without any
mouynge from one place / as he that that thought nothy^ge on it. And so as the
knight beheld him in that estate / he said unto him Olyuer he sleep. And
then Olyuer as a person that is awaked out of his sleep / smote his horse
with the sporres without auysynge where he went / and ye first thing that he
recountred with his spear / that was ionge and strong meruaylously / was a
post that held up a scaffolde / and upon that scaffolde was much people / and
he smote it down / and all them that were upon it. Then there was great
laughter of them that saw it / and said that it was a meruayllous stroke. The
ladies excused him / saying that he had not clear syghte / or that his horse was
not at his will. Olyuer was led back to his fellows sore ashamed / and they
gave hy^ a new spear. The first that he encountered with was one of the kings
of Irlande / named Maquemor / y^ which was smyten down horse and all. Then ye
should have herd the heraudes cry / see the aue^turous knight armed in black
/ that with one only stroke has smyten down a.C. persons / and with the
second stroke a king / ye shall se hy^ do meruaylles of arms to day. Olyuer
herd the se words / wherefore he put himself in pain for to do well. And
there was none that might abide him a stroke with a spear. Nevertheless every
body put himself in deuoyre as well within as without / but above all Olyuer
bare y^ price / the which did not dysplease y^ fair Helayne / yt said to
herself / that and he were as knyghtly unarmed / as he was armed / that he
might be ye flower of all them in the place.

How Olyuer returned in to y^ hermyte the second time without making him to be
known / and how he was abylled in new garments. Capitulo. xxv.
IN like wise as ye have herd endured the Iustes unto the night separed them.
And then the king and his daughter Helayne returned in to the cite. And then
the Iusters departed for that night. And the most part of the knights of the
torneyment in dysarmynge them devised of the black knight / saying that they
had great vole^te for to se him dysarmed / for to know if he were as semely a
knight on foot / as he was on horsbacke / and if y^ his gown became him as
well as harneys. And there was many at the banquet / the which would not have
be there if they had not thought to have fou^^e him therefore no pryse should
not be given unto the last day. And when it came to the daunces / and that
Olyuer was not there / every body meruaylled / so each did the best that he
could. Olyuer was in the hermytage by the cou^sayll of his knight / the which
was departed from him / and he had told him that without doubt he would
return unto him in the morning betymes / wherefore Olyuer thanked him / and
abode in the hermytage that night / in thanking our lord of his good
adventure. The good hermyte made him Ioyefull chere to his power / but he made
not so good chere as they did at London. The noble Helayne was set in the
halle / in ye same wise that she was set at the Iustes / to the end that
every body might behold her. After that the daunces were ended they brought
spyees. And after the fair Helayne was conveyed to her chamber / with foyson
of ladies / and so the feast ended for that day. Now ye ought to understand
that every person made him y^ best at case that he might for that night / for
to be upon the morrow more fressher than Olyuer. So the night passed and the
day came / wherefore every body put him in deuoyre for to find all that them
belonged for the second Journey And when that it was time for to depart.
Olyuer apperceyued a great company of folk / all habylyed in read / in the
same estate that they were clothed the day before save y^ it was read, when
they approached Olyuer he went and salued his knight that was clothed in a
long ge^owne of cramosyn / and behind hy^ was Olyuers horse / and the pages of
the day before / were clothed in satyn cremosyn. The courser on the which
Olyuer should ride was a bayarde. And the horse was hosed in clothe of gold
^yght rich.

How Olyuer came the second day to the turneyment / and how he smote down
the standarde of they^ of within. Capitulo. xxvi.


ANd then Olyuer came to the torneymente and was the first that entered in to
the field of them of without / but ye may well thyuke that it was not without
great beholdynge of the ladies / and in like wise of them of within / ye may
well think that Olyuer thus accompanied as ye have herd / was beholden of
kings and queen's / lords and ladies / and of all them that were there
present / and he the which knew it / the best wise y^ he might made him
lyghtest for to be armed / for to give great st^okes. And because that he would
not travail the horse upon the which he ought for to work as he haddened^
thereof. He mounted upon a little horse that was right well accustomed for to
make some pleasant thing before the ladies / and therefore he faylled not at
that time / wherefore the said Olyuer was beholden of every body / and said the
one to the other / behold what a semely knight he is / for by symylytude of
his body he ought well for to encheue a hye enterprise / se how honestly and
knyghtly he rydeth / for he remeueth no moore for all that his horse can do /
than if he were not upon his back. Among these deuyses / the kings sone of
Scotland came right rychely clothed / and strongly accompanied with valiant
knights / that would torneye that day with him / and also the most part for
the guard of his person. After came the king Maquen or and two other kyng^s of
Irlonde / of whom I know not the names. And after came the duke of Buroon /
and the Earl of Flaundres. And then came in the duke o^ G^^cecetre / the duke
of Lanca^^e / the duke of Bedforde / the duke of Northf^lke / and the duke of
Somerset. And so came in the earl of Northumberlande / the Earl of Le^^etre /
and y^ earl of Salysburye / and so many otherlordes / that was it meruayll.
When all these princes / and lords were assembled / and that they saw there
came no moo / it was cried by the King that every man should do his deuoy^^.
Then the two signs / that is to know that of within / and in like wise that
of without began for to approach. There ye might have seen cleue many
basynettes / and many a knight beten down to y^ earth Olyuer that was mounted
upon his courser / held his sword in his hand / wherewith he did meruaylles
of arms / he went seeking them that him thought were the most val^auntest /
and with them he had add gladly / and when he had remembrance / or leyser to
look on hye / and that he might behold the fair Helayne / his force and
hardynesse doubled. Wherefore none may recounte the valyauntnes and feats of
arms that he did / Now it was ordained that and the sign of them of within
might by force of arms be brought to a place that was there / by their
adversary party / that the torneyng should be accomplysshed. Therefore they of
without put themself in pain for to win it. And Olyuer the which rested
never in one place / and to whom every body made way / encountered him that
bare the sign of the^ of within / and ^aue him such a stroke that he made him
bow his heed upon the horse neck / and was so astonyed that he had almoost
fallen to the earth / and Olyuer returned his stroke thinking for to have
cut the shafte of the sign / but he sound it so strong / and so well
banded with ^ron / that he could not empayre it / but it was force to the
knight that held it / for to let it go fro him and so it sell to the earth /
then ye might have herd gretes^ outes on both parties / and they of within
put themsel^e in ^^^yre for to reyse up their sign again. But that was
unpossyble for them / because of the valyaunte Olyuer that defended it / with
y^ good help that he had of his party.

How Olyuer returned in to his hermytage / after y^ he had wo^^^ the vyctorye
of the torneyenge / and of the dyspleasure that the king and his daughter had
because of the deed knights. Capitulo. xxvii.
AT the re^cowes of that sign / was many a knight s^ayne on both parties /
but moore of them of within / than of without / whereof the king was not well
content for to se his men dye so. And then he commanded to two or three
knights the which were ordained when there moved any deb^tes / that they
should put them in pain for to repease them / to go hastily and depart them /
the which without py^^ slew each other. They did the kings commandment /
but or they might come to ye place where the debate was / there was diverse
m^ruaylous strokes given. And the hystorye says that a v^^yaunt knight of
within when Olyuer did so many feats of arm^^ approached to him / and took his
sword in both his hands for to give the gretter stroke / and eue^ so as he
had both his arms eleuate for to smite Olyuer. Olyuer apperc^yued it / and
hasted him for to smite fyrst^ / and gave him so great a stroke that he made to
fle in to y^ ^elde / y^ sword with both his arms / wherefore all they y^ saw
it meruaylled. And in like wise the king began for to bliss him sayng / if
this read knight that was yesterdaye clothed in black live long / or if y^
fighting be not departed / he will make dye the most part of my men / he is
a living devil se how his sword does cut / he has done so much / that
it is of the same color that his armor is of. The knight that he has smyten
down shall never cut no purse. In that estate devised the king / and on ye
other part the ladies had always their eye^ on him / but the fair ^^elayne
had not the courage for to behold him / because of the effusyon of blood of
her gentyl knights / but it was not long after / but they were departed / and
was cried by the king that none so herdy upon pain of death sor to torneye
any more for that day. And therefore every body did withdraw hy^ / and it was
time for Olyuer to return into his hermytage / whether as his knight did
bring him / and then took leave of him / and told hy^ that he would not
forgete him the next morrow. The king and his excellent daughter returned in
to the n^ble cite. And souped yt night in the fair He ayns chamber / the
which was not wel^ at case because she had sytten so long / and also for
the slaughter that she had seen / wherefore she said to her fader. My lord my
fader be ye not dyspleasaunt for the pyteous syghte that was to day / ye make
your men to deye without cause. I believe not that it is for me / for and I
knew it I should rather make an oath never to be married / where ore I beseech
you that ye will acco^de me y^ they Just or torneye / no more in the facyon
that they have done to day. The king answered her. My daughter think for to
make good chere / and take no thought of nothing / for of this that is
happened I am more dyspleasaunt than ye be / Therefore I shall put so good
remedy / that it shall not happen as it has done to day. And then, he
gave her good night / in saying that he saw well that she had no talent for to
dance that night / and she answered nay And for the causes aforesaid there
was (...) dau^ces that night.

How Olyuer came to the torneyme^t the third time / and had the honor
above them all by his great prowess / and how the King co^mysed.xx. knyghttes
for to bring him before him / to know what he was. Capitulo. xxviii.


When the king was in his chamber he inquired how many knights there had
beslayn and found deed of the^ of with in to the no^bre of.xivi. and of the^ of
without.xv. wherefore the king was much angrye / and commanded that.xlvi.
other knights should be put in the places of ye deed knights / and if there
were any hurt that might not help themself on the morrow / that they should
put in other. The thing was done so / and upon the morrow the King went in
to his scaffolde / where as he dyned / and the fair Helayne also during the
^yner time they spoke of nothing but of the torneyenge. of the day past. And
the king said that he was right dyspleasau^t because that he might not se him
that did so great deeds of arms / wherefore he commanded.xx. knights that
they should have always regard to him and that they should not fail to bring
him to the banquet / for he would se him. He commanded also that the nombre of
two thousand fighting men were armed / for to keep the field from all debates
and noyses. The mean while the masters stewardes and controllers / were in
the palace making all thing ready for the banquet and feast / that should be at
night / the which should be without comparyson of all that ever had be^ seen
in this realm. The hour approached that they should find them in the field.
And the four hundred knights of within / with the two thousand came in to
the field / whereof some of them had lever have be^ commysed to make ready y^
feast / for the example that the read knight had given them the day before /
the which all ready did arm him / and was comen upon his horse clothed in white
and all his folk in the same suit / in the same manner that they came the day
before / save that they had been clothed in read / and so came in to the field
on horsbacke / and put hemselfe beside the kings sone of Scotland / and all
the other alyght in like wise. And then when all were assembled / the king
badde two knights for to goo look how many they were of without. Then they
went down / and told the Lords the kings will and commandment. Then they
took a gyrdell and made them for to pass underneath / and found that they of
without were well four hundred. And a knight by the commandment of the king
said that every body should vngyrde his sword / and said that the axe suffysed
/ and after that the battle was begone / the King sent men for to depart
them / and badde that none were so hardy for to smite on the heed with the
trenchau^t after y^ time / and aduertysed them yt the price should be given at
night / to him that has deserved it. And then it was told them that they
might begin when it should seem the^ good. Then they began for to smite in
such wise that it was a goodly sight to behold them. It was a semely sight
for to behold how Olyuer demeaned him with his axe / for he smote so
puyssauntly that he made him away large enough. When they approached nere the
one smote upon ye other so impetyously that it was meruayll they might stand.
Olyuer dremed not / for he gave so pesaunt strokes / that him that he hytte a
right he made him to kiss the ground / and he did so much that there durst
not abide before him / so with force of smy^ynge / his axe that was great and
long did break And when he saw that / he approached him to a knight and
pulled his axe out of his hands / by such a might and by such a chyualrous
puyssaunce / virtue and also manner that whether he would or not he made him
kiss the ground. Twain of the kings of Irlande / had great envy at Olyuer
/ because they saw the price could not escape him / and therefore by great
dyspleasure they assaylled Olyuer / the which defended him so valyauntly /
that he cloue one of them to the tethe. The king seeing that it might not
endure without great debate / said that it suffysed. And so they departed
whether they would or not.

How Olyuer was taken by the knights that the king had co^mysed / and how his
servants vanysshed away / and after how he found foyson of money / and
vestymentes. Capitulo. xxix.


ANd then the king and the ladies returned in to the cite / and every body
withdrewe the^ in to their habytacyons / so the deed ky^ges body was borne in
to London by his men / where as his body was enseuelyd / and put in a horse
lyttere covered with black / and in that estate / in great lamentacyons was
led in to his realm. Olyuer was yet in the field where as he cried after his
horse but none answered hy^ / nor he could espy none of them that came with him
/ whereof he had great meruayl / and was so dyspleasaunt that he wist not what
to do / not with standing his armor / he put him self on the way toward the
hermytage all ashamed / saying that he saw well his evil au^nture / and that
in all fortune was to him contrary. And therefore he delybered in him self for
to habandonne the good that might come to him by occasyon of the torneyment /
and not for to make him to be known to any person living. Even so as he
went thinking on his evil adventure / the.xx. knights that by the king
were commysed / and ordained for to have regard on him / sought him on every
side / and did so much that they apperceyued hy^ going alone Then they
smote their horses with the sportes / and did so much that they ouertoke him /
and said to him. Ge^tyll knight let it not torn you to dyspleasure / if that
we^ do that the which was commanded us by the king for he has commanded
us for to witholde you / y^ which requires you / that it will please you /
for to be this night at the daunces / and at the banquet / and therefore by him
we lay hands on you. It was force to Olyuer to obey the commandment of the
king. And therefore all ashamed he returned to London with the foresaid
knights. But during the way it was not without plesau^t thoughts / for
when he bethoughte him of the great pompes / and rich habyllementes that he
had during the other days / and now he found him alone with out any knowledge /
and that it was force for him to be at ye banquet and feast with the other /
without gown / or other clothing / save in his harneys / but if he found
some that would lenne him a gown / he was in so great dyspleasau^ce / that he
would have been a.M. mile thens if it had been possible for him. In that estate
they rode till they came to London / and dyslodged one of the xx. knights for
to lodge him / and demanded him in what place they would find his servants
/ for to send for them. The poor Olyuer all ashamed said. Certaynlye I can
not tell you where to find them / but for this night I shall be master /
and varlet. As they were in these deuyses the hostess came to Olyuers person
and said to him allow. My lord it is not long ago sith one of your servants
was here / and gave me this little fardell / telling me that your clothes were
in it / and has laid the bogette under your beds heed For all your
servants ben gone / and ye shall find the^ no more. And told me that the
knight that ye wot of / recommaundeth him to you / and puts you in memory
of the promise yt ye made to him / the which prayth you that ye will have it
in remembrance Olyuer hery^ge his hostess / was more abashed than ever he
had been and feynynge that he knew well enough what it would mean / went
first to his beds heed / and found ye bogette that his hostess had told
him of / and found the keye in the lock / and tasted it / and felt well
enough that it was heavy / and vndyde it / and in lokynge in to it he
apperceyued that it was nothing but gold / and good nobles of England.

How Olyuer found great fynaunce^ / servants and clothynges / and how he was
brought in to the Kings court with great reverence of the knights that had
taken him. Capitulo. xxx.


OLyuer that found himself all alone in his chamber / sat him down / for
the.xx. knights had taken leave of him / and were gone for to dysarme them /
to be at the feast / and seeing that he had time enough / began for to tell
his money / and found that there was.v. M. nobles / wherefore he thanked god
and the noble knight that had / had so good remembrance on him. Whiles that
he put up his gold in to his bougette / entered in to ye chamber five gentle
squyers clothed in white satyn and.x. varlets clothed in white clothe / which
salued him saying. My lord / your master steward has been here this after
none / and has given each of us a gown and told us that it was your lyueray
/ and that ye should reteyne us in your service / and therefore we come toward
you to know and it be your will / for there is none of us but that he has
good master / for some be the Earl of Flaundres men / and the other the dukes
of Somerset And thus each of us has good masters / but they have as many
servants as them need the. And for the valyau^tnesse that we have seen in
you / we become your servants if it be your pleasure. Olyuer answered the^
and said. My friends of your grace ye say more good of me than I have
deserved. Ans as I understand each of you has a good master / and better
than I am / but and it be your will I reteyne you all. And to morrow sith that
ye be men of knowledge I shall enquere of your estate / and then to each of
you I shall give such estate as to you apperteyneth. One of y^ servants said
to him. My lord your master steward has ordained me your palfreynere /
therefore ye shall tell me if it please you what I shall do with your horses.
For I have five good coursers / and two little hobyes right fair / of which
he badde me take good heed. And because that it is far to the court I
think ye will not g^ on foot therefore if it please you ye shall tell me which
of your horses ye will have / and what harneys I shall put upon him whether
that of velvet crymosyn / or that of beten gold and if that it please you that
your four pages shall come toward you. Olyuer was much abashed / and made
the sign of the cross / and said to him. My friend go in gods name / and
sadle one of the two little hobyes which thou love best / and put on him the
harnes of beten gold / and make ye pages come with two torches for to light me
in to the court. And the^ Olyuer commanded for to undo the fardell / and so
it was done. And found three sorts of clotynge for him / of the same colors
yt he had worn during the torneyment / that is to wit / black / read /
and white. The hosen were of scarlet / the gowns of velvet / the doublettes of
black damask fygured / and the hatte of black / upon the which was a right
gentle and rich ouche of stones right curyously wrought / and there was in it
an e / and an o / together. Wherefore he began for to kiss it / and said allow.
Fair fader god if that thou will extend so much thy grace on me / that my
fortune were such that Olyuer and Helayn might come so nere together as these
two lettres / I should be much beholden to thank thy great majesty. In y^
same words Olyuer clothed him / and found that his clothing were so well
made for him / that there could none amend them. He was not so sone clothed
but that his horse was ready abiding him at the door / and his four pages. And
within short time after y^ knights that had brought him theder / came for to
fetch him / and told him that it was high time to goo in to the court. They
they mounted on horsbacke / and the torches were lyghted that conduyted them in
to y^ court.

How Olyuer came in to the court of the right noble king of England / where
as he was received of all y^ lords / and l^dyes with great Joy. Ca. xxxi.


WHa^ Olyuer was before the gate of y^ palace he began for to smite his horse
with y^ sporres / y^ which made lepes without no^bre and did all that his
master would have hy^ do / he made fire to spring out of the payment in such
haboundaunce yt every body looked out at ye wyndowes to behold him / and in
such estate he came to the place where it was time to alyght. And because y^
he was so semely a knight / there was great prece to be hold him. There was so
huge a nombre of folk that with great pain he might descend / and pass
forth / The tidings came to the king / and to the other pry^ces that theder
were comen / how y^ white knight was comen / and mounted up the steyres / and
said that and his beauty were lost / that in all the world it might not be
recovered / and in like wise these tidings were pronounced to the ladies / the
which demanded what manner a man he was / and it was told them that he was a
heed of work / and that there was never seen a more fayrer knight. And during
these words he entered in to y^ halle where as all the lords were / and salued
the king The which by semblaunt made him right great chere and honor / and
so did all the other lords / the which sholdred one another for to se him /
for his excellent be aute. There was many that at his coming would that he
had been a thousand mile thens / and in especyall they that had done best
next him did curse him in their courage / but his physnamye and maneres were
so sweet / that he should have been right cursed y^ would have done him any
harm. So as he was fested on every side / ye right fair and good Helayne
accompanied with diverse great lords and ladies came in to the hall apparaylled
and aourned so rychely / that her habyllementes were worth a realm / for
there was never seen the pareylles or like. Her beauty enlumyned the palace /
the which exceded all natures work. And think not that that Helayne for
whom Troy received so many aduersytes passed this. But because that
comparysons be heinous / and noysous I hold my peace in retornynge to my
purpose. The fair Helayne of England seeing the thought of her lord and
fader set her upon her knees / and made to him reverence and honor as it
apperteyned. The king her fader took her by the hand and made her for to
arise / in saying that she was right well come. And then she was salued of
all the other k^yghtes and lords unto whom she rendered echone their salute
after their qualyte / as she could do full well. Then was Olyuer brought
before her the which knew him as soon as she saw him. For he was easy for to
know amongst them all. Wherefore she beheld him voluntarylye / and it was
force to the knights and squyres for to withdraw them aparte / for to make
place to the lad^es and gentylwomen / to the end that they might se him the
better at their cases. And there was but few of them that were for to marye /
but that they thought within theymselfe / and would that Olyuer had conquered
them by force of arms / as well as he had done y^ fair Helayne.

How in secret the price was ordained for Olyuer by the Iuges commysed / and
the counsayll of the king approved for to aduertyse Olyuer. Capi. xxxii.


ALytell while after these things d^uyse^ the tables were spredde / and
incontynente as all thing was ready y^ trompettes blewe for water to wasshe
their hands. And then the king and his daughter washed / and all the other
lords in general. And the King made to enquere of Olyuer / of his ky^ne /
and what he was / and of what marches / to the end that y^ honor were done to
him after his estate. He answered to them that demanded him that he was a
poor knight of Spain / and not of a hye place. There was not one neither the
king nor the other / but that men seemed well by his phys^amye / that he was of
a good house / and that also without great puyssaunce he could not have
furnysshed the habyllementes that they had seen him have during the f^^st /
When time was the king satte him down at the table / and with him all the
great lords and ladies / reserved Helayne / that was set up on hye in the
mids of a table that was eleuate / to the end that she might be seen of all
them in the halle. At the right side were the princes Iuges set at the same
table / and on the other side were the.x. pryncesses at the same table. Olyuer
would not sytten down at the kings stable. Notwithstanding he was prayed so
much / and commanded that it was force for him to obey. There was other
tables without nombre where as the other knights and ladies were set. Who
that would deuyse to you the service and the mysteryes that was there / it
should be to long to recou^te it. There was no mete that replenysshed the^ so
sone / as to behold the excellent Helayne / she was the repose of the weary /
and the couragynge of the valiant And there was not one but that they thought
that god had made her for to show his high puyssau^ce. This feast dured so
long till that it was time to vnserue / and there was none of them all that
thought other thing / save to make good chere / and also they were not
required otherwise. The tables taken away and graces given to our lord of his
goodness / the daunces began / and incontinent the.x. princes / and the.x.
pryncesses withdrewe them a part in to a little chamber for to know who had
done best / and they were in great plete. The one held with the kings sone of
Scotland / and the other (...) the earl of Flaundres / and the other with the
good duke of Somerset. But the most part held with Olyuer. In such wise
that there was none of them but that they gave their voice to Olyuer / and
when the king thought that they might well have done / he habandonned the
daunces and came toward them / and demanded them what thing that they had
done. One of them kneled down and said. Our sovereign lord ye have of your
good grace commysed us for to say fr^ly the truth. Also we have made our
oath that we shall not take regard to the magnyfycence of the lygnag^ nor
lordshyppe / And us seems that the best doer of all this assemble has been
Olyuer / not for one day alonely / but for all the the days / and we saw
never knight do such deeds of arms as he has done / therefore we aduertyse
you thereof / for to do therewith your good pleasure. The king answered and
said. My fair cosyns / and my good friends / and you my fair ladies here
present I here well enough what ye have said / and knows that it should be
against reason to take y^ price from him y^ has deseruyd it. And truly who
had axed me mine aduyse^ would have said the same that ye have told me / but
for all that ye ought to know that this is not a little thyn^ For he that
wynneth the price / wynneth my daughter and consequently all my realm for to
be king over yo^ al after my decease. And because that ye give the pry^^ to a
stranger unknown of us all I would under cor^reccyon so it that seem you
good / yt he were aduertyse^ of this thing by one of you / and how the price
shall b^ given to him. And he the which shall aduertyse him / may say also
to him / that I am delybered for to make unto him a request / that is for to
know that he were co^tente for to abide a year in my court before that my
fair daughter Helayne be given unto him / for to know^ his mures and
condycyons. And also I shall promys^ him by the faith that I owe to knyghthode
that during that time I shall not mary her / and if that he be a man worthy
her / and that I know none other thing tha^ I do till this present time / that
which he has won shall not be taken from him. And also I shall put in
doubt right great lords that be^ here / and if that I gave her to him in
their presence / they might co^spyre some evil against his pers^ne / whereby
right great inconuenyentes might come to him / and there is mine advise. Wha^
the king had fynysshed his words / they withdrewe themsel^e a part. And
found in counsayll that the king had said right well / and said it should be
well done to know Olyuers will / before that the request were made on high.
Because that it should be shame to the King if it were not unto him accorded.
Thus there is no thing but good / and the king has no wrong to know before
the love.

How the king of England came toward his fair daughter / for to demand
her to whom her seemed that the price ought to be given / and of her answers.
Capitulo. xxxiii.
ONe of the princes was ordained to speak to Olyuer / wherefore he came in to
the hall where as ye ladies were / and ^oke Olyuer aparte / and said to hy^ all
that ye have her ^e before. Olyuer had always doubt of y^ thing / by cause of
the great multitude of lords that were there / to whom hy^ thought they would
sooner apply than to him / and thought as well that if he were not content
that it should be force to him / wherefore he answered to the prince. My lord
ye mock with me for I have not deserved the honor that ye do to me / but and
ye speak in sadness / and that it please the king to make to me a request /
as I here you say. I tell you that it is no prayer / but his commandment to
the which I will not dysobeye / and said no more / nor the lord also but
returned toward the king / and aduertysed him of that which he had founden
in Olyuer / and said that he found never a more dyscreter man / nor more
worthy and that he was dygne of much good. And the King was right Joyous of
that report / and began for to tell in what manner he would that ye price were
given / and who should bear it / and told them that he would make them have
knowledge / the hour that the price should he given. And then he departed and
came to the daunces where as he found his daughter / y^ which he took by the
hand / and said to her. My fair daughter ye must tell me to which of these
lords that ye have s^ue here / ye have best will to / and which has done
best by your advise. My lord my fader I have no more will to one tha^ to an
other. Ye be my fader reason it is that I obey to you / for your pleasure is
mine / and also me thy^keth that they have all done so well that none can
amend it / Then the king demanded her if that she would be as well co^tente
if Olyuer had the price / as if a gretter lord had it. She answered / it is
a fair thing to do right to every body. Ye be wise and knows what ye have
to do. The king which was dyscrete sent for y^ price / y^ which was brought
in the manner that follows.

How the price of the torneyment was brought to Olyuer by diverse lords and
ladies / and what it was. Capitulo. xxxiiii.


THere came first many torches / and officers for to make place. After came a
King of arms rychely clothed holdy^g^ on high with both his hands a great
and massysse cheyne of gold / charged and enryched with precious stones. After
him came two fair ladies / clothed in like habyllementes / the which became
them so well that it was a pleasant sight to behold them. These ladies were
accompanied with four knights clothed in like wise / and each of the ladies
were on the right hand of two knights. And in such estate they came before y^
ky^ges person / to whom they did the reverence as it apperteyned. And the^
they demanded him if it were his good pleasure that the price were given. And
he answered ye. Then they began to walk about the halle / and came to the
place where as Olyuer was hid among the prece. To whom the King of arms
said that he should come forth / and that it was to him that they would speak /
and after that he was comen forth the king of arms said to him in this wise.
Carbu^cle and gemme of all prowess and hardynesse / the king our sovereign
lord / and the ladies of this company / by the great and high faytes of arms
that in you has be^ showed / and comen to their knowledge / does present to
you this noble cheyne / in gyuynge you the price of ye three days with tryumphe
and glory / above al them that theder has been comen / or found them there.
I make you no me^syon of my right redoubted maystresse / and lady Helayne
because that the King my sovereign lord make y^ to you a request / that is
that the right that ye can demand of her by the cry that was publysshed by
his commandment / that it will please you for to be co^tente and (...)
dyfferre and abide until a year be passed. And he does promise you that
enduryng that while / my lady Helayne his dought^^ shall not be married / and
then he shall do so much toward you that ye shall be well content / For she
shall be appareylled for you / even as she should be at this present time /
for he would not take fro you for no thing / that the which ye have deserved.
Oliver with a simple voice all rubycu^de answered that he had not deserved the
honor that they presented him / but sith that it was the kings good pleasure
/ and the lords and ladies / he should be a great fool / and mysproude to
refuse it. As for the surplus touching the kings requests / he answered that
his requests were commandments / in praynge if that he had won any thing
that it should not be taken from him. For he was well in will for to take it /
if it fell to him. This notwithstanding he was well content that the kings
will were accomplysshed / and to abide a year. And thanked the king / and the
ladies that had made him that present. And took the chain of gold and put it
about his neck And then they demanded him his name / and surname he made
himself Olyuer / but he said that his surname might not be known at that
present time. And because that the heraude could not tell how to give his name
in knowledge that the price was given to / he began for to cry in this manner
wise To this black / read / and white knight / the flower of chyualrye / that
by force of arms has obtained the last tryumphe of the torneyment has been
delivered the price.

How Olyuer required y^ king of England that he would reteyne him of his
court / and that he might k^^ue before his daughter / the which he vttred him.
before all his barons. Capitulo. xxxv.


THen was Olyuer led before the king / y^ which he thanked humbly of the
great honor that he had done to him without deseruynge / and besought him for
to have always memory of him / and of his promise that he h^o made him / and
to reteyne him of his court. The king answered in saying that he would do it
with ryght^ good will / and that such estate as he would demand / should be
delivered him / and with that that he should not fere him / but that he would
have me morye of him / and that because of the price that was his he should
lose nothing. Sir said Olyuer I can not tell you how ye understand it / truly
I can nothing lose / of what whereof I had never nothing / but I hold you for
so valiant that ye will not go against your word ye give me for to chese and
take such estate as shall please me / wherefore I thank you. And therefore I
pray you that ye will be co^tente that I be squyre keruer before my lady your
daughter. And the King answered in refusing him / and said that his daughter
was not accustomed for to be served of a knight. Notwithstanding he required
and prayed so much that the king was co^tente that his will were fulfilled.
Nevertheless that he was worthy to have had a gretter estate than that / Then
he made him to rise and took him by the hand / and led him toward his
daughter / and then commanded her that she should kiss him / because that him
seemed that Olyuer had well deserved it / and at the leest if that he had no
more honor but that for to content hy^ the better. The fair Helayne in
accomplysshynge the will of the King her fader / took Olyuer by y^ hand y^
was already on his knee / and kyssed him in touchy^ge her mouth against his.
This kiss through perced y^ heart of Olyuer and his entraylles / and entered and
lodged in the most secretest place of his heart / and never after departed /
that done she made Olyuer to arise / the which thanked her. After the daunces
were begone again / and endured a great space of time / and after came the
wine and spyces / and wha^ every body had drunk and that it was our for to go
to bed / the great princes / and lords took leave of the king / and of the
fair Helayne / for to return on the morrow in to their countrees / and
thanked the king of the great chere and honor that he had done to them in his
court. The king prayed him that they would yet abide a day or twain. But
they would not abide but badde him adieu. And when it came that the kings sone
of Scotland took his leave of ye fair Helayne / he said to her allow as in
reprochynge / y^ he was right Joyous that she was so well assygned. Helayne
that was not folysshe / understood well that all that he had said / proceeded
of envy / wherefore she held her still and said nothing / but took leave of
him and of all the other / the which went in to their lodgings and on the
morrow departed. The king Maquemor of Irlande / and another that was his
neighbor for any prayer that the king did make / would not come to y^ feast
but all evil content were departed / without taking leave / for the
dyspleasure that they had of the death of the king of Irlande their friend /
and that the king had made thereof so little accounte. And affermed and
promised the one to the other that if it were possible for them when they were
comen in to their country / that the king of England should repent him to
late.

How Olyuer was retained of the Kings court and kerued before his daughter /
and made his oath. Capitulo. xxxvi.


OLyuer badde good night to the king and to his fair daughter Helayne / and
consequentlye to all the other. And he was conveyed to his lodges / by diverse
gentylmen of the kings court / that all ready had great volente for to be
acquaynted with hy^. Olyuer comen in to his lodges / made them for to drink /
and then he thanked them for y^ trauayll y^ they had taken for him / and said
to them. My lords I will be from hensforth your servant / brother / and
fellow. And if there be any thing that I may do for you / there is none of you
but that ye shall find me ready at need. Then they all departed / save one
gentle squyre / the which Olyuer retained with him / for to lie with him / and
also to the end that he should have the more acquayntaunce with the lords of
the court. The night passed and the day came. And wha^ it was time. Olyuer
arose and clothed him in new robes / that he had made make all the night. And
was led to the court by his squyre / and found the king y^ was already at the
mass / the which fynysshed / the king commanded that Olyuer should be led
toward his first knight chamberlayne / the which he had ordained for to speak
to him. Wha^ Olyuer was comen / y^ first chamberlayne said to him Olyuer my
friend the king has ordained me for to receive your oath / and that I give to
you retynue of.xx. horses. And if it be your pleasure for to serve my lady his
daughter as ye have required / as well ye may do it / as if ye were of less
estate. Olyuer thanked the king / and made his oath. And as he y^ which
thought never time enough for to se her that had given him that gracyous
kiss / required that for that day he might kerue before her / and so he was
led into her chamber / where as Helayns table was spredde / the which made
no long taryenge but came. When Olyuer saw her / he gave her good morrow /
And she rendered him his salute right curteysly / and beheld him gladly. And
then she sat her down at the table. Where as Olyuer began for to kerue before
her. And in casting up her eyes demanded him if that it was his will for to
kerue before her. Olyuer answered / madame it is my pleasure for to do you all
the service that I can / so that it torn you not to dyspleasure. Olyuer my
friend said she nay / but I thank you / how well y^ I had would that ye had
deported you of this office / but sith yt it is your will / it is well mine.
So Olyuer kerued before his fair maystres all alonge the dinner / but it was not
without foyson of regardes and lokes. When the table was up / he was a little
while with the ladies / and then he went toward the king / to whom they had
told that Olyuer did serve at his daughters dinner / and said that he was the
gentyllest servant that ever they had seen.

How Olyuer was surprysed of the love of Helayne and cut his fyngre in
serving her. Ca. xxxvii.
THese things did pass / and Olyuer was a great while in ye court so well
beloved that all that knew hy^ said good of him. The king himself could not
praise him enough / and said often that Olyuer was both fair and good /
saying that he and his daughter were well served The fair Helayne in like wise
seeing the graces and beautees that god and nature had endowed that young
knight with / did praise him strongly in her heart / but she made no semblaunt
for doubt of some folk. For ye know well enough that they say oftener the
evil than the good / for all that wha^ they demanded her / she said that she
saw nothing in hy^ but all good / and that he was a right gracyous knight /
and in such estate he had put him in the grace of all them that knew him. And
in like wise at y^ beginning had been co^spyred diverse enuyes against his
person / but by the great wisdom and doulcenesse that remained in him / he
had subdued and overcome his evil wyllers / in such wise that every body loved
him. Also none can not record to you y^ new things that were begone /
enterprysed / and acheued by hy^ / as well Iustynge as other dyspertes and
plays Ye have well herd how Olyuer had received a kiss of his excellent
maystresse / and I have also told you that he kept it so well / that he lost
it not when he would / for love in a short space had defaced his Joy and
lyesse / and with that held him so streyte in his bonds that he could not ete
nor drink / sleep nor rest in bed / and he was not at his ease nor peace the
hour that he had lost the sight of his lady and maystresse. And was not in
no place but that him thought that he saw the representacyo^ of his excellent
lady before his eyes. In such estate he was a space of time / and in such wise
he aduychylled / him that he became in such estate that he cared no more of
no good deed. Thystorye says that on a time as he kerued before his maystres
at the table as he that was not master over himself began to behold her /
and in beholdynge her he made many syghes of love that proceeded from his heart.
Then the fair Helayne apperceyued that he thought strongely upon her / and she
had no thing kerued before her for to ete. For Olyuer had given her none /
wherefore she said by diverse times. Olyuer my friend I would ete gladly if ye
gave me whereof Olyuer that thought on other things herd her not at y^ first
time. And when his understanding was comen again / all ashamed he began for to
serve / and as he that had no thought on that which he did / cut his fyngre
^ll most of. Wherefore he departed from thens incontinent / and gave another to
serve. Helayne apperceyuynge these things knew and apperceyued clearly y^
thought of Olyuer / whereof she was nothing glad / when she saw him in such
point for her love.

How Olyuer laid him down in his bed soore syke / and how that Helayne was
syke also for him / and of their complayntes / and how Helayne gate leave of her
fader go to vysyte Olyuer. Capitulo. xxxviii.


OLyuer come^ in to his lodgys entered all alone in to his chamber / and laid
him down upon his bed / in complaining him so pyteously / that it was great
pity for to here. He cursed the god of love that had wounded him so profoundly
with his hambynge darte and bound him in his bands so vyolently / wherefore
he saw appertely that he must needs deye / for he abode none allegeaunce / nor
mercy of his anguysshous maladye. Ha king of England said Olyuer if thy
word had been verytable / as a kings ought to be / I had not fallen in this
extremyte that I am now in. Thus as ye have herd demeaned Olyuer his sorrow
by long space of time / and continued so in that he was grievously sick / and
laid him down in his naked bed. Whereof the King and all they of the court
were right dyspleasaunt. And the king vysyted him right famylyerly / and made
him to be sumptuously kept / and taken heed to of his physycyons. But above
all them that were dolaunt / the noble Helayne passed / notwithsta^dynge she
made no semblaunt outward. And on a time as y^ physycyens came to her / as it
is their custom for to vysyte princes and prencesses / she demanded them how
Olyuer did / and if that he amended not. They answered nay / and said that
they had great doubt of his life When Helayne herd these tidings she was so
dolent that she might scarsely sustain herself. The^ she with drew her in to
her garderobe / and gave them to understand that she was sick / and therefore
she laid her down on her bed / and made her to be covered / for to cover
the better her dole. And when the ladies were voyded / she began to say with a
soft voice. O god almyghtye creator of heaven and earth / the which after thy
pleasure dysposeth all erthely things. And thou right doulce queen of heaven /
lady of the world / and empress of hell also truly as thou bare.ix. months
in thy blessed flanks the very sone of god thyn espouse / and that conceived
him a vyrgyn / and delivered him a vyrgyn / and y^ art advocate and refuge of
all desolate creatures I beseech the that thou will counsayll me unhappy and
vnfortuned woman. O glorious vyrgyn Marye wherefore has thy blessed sone given
me so much beauty for to be cause of the death of the most fairest / and
most valyauntest knight that ever was seen / the which am in dygne of this
grace. Wherefore I beseech the that thou keep this gentle knight / the which
has not my soon me in no manner of the world / whereby I should put him in
this right dangerous peril / and that thou dysdeyne not for to tell me mine
honor saved / how that I might give him allegeaunce of his maladye. Whiles
that she complained so to god and to our lady / a light sompne took her /
wherthrughe she was constrained to sleep. In her sleep her seemed that our lady
spoke to her and said. Helayne my sone and I have herd thy request The knight
for whom thou have prayed is sick to the death. And because that thou art
cause of his maladye / thou must be cause also of his guarysshy^ge and health /
go toward thy fader and demand him license for to ^o se him / and when thou
shalt be there / put him in memory that the years end approaches nere / and
that thou shalt have so good mind on him / that it shall suffyse him. Helayne
a waked right Joyous of her vysyo^ / and in thanking god and our lady arose /
and went toward her fader / the which gave her leave to go vysyte Olyuer /
and so she went theder with a little company. And when she was entered in to
the chamber / she approached toward the bed where as Olyuer was / that
alredye had lost his knowledge / and with the teres in her eyes named him her
friend / in demanding him how he did. Olyuer knew the voice of his
may^^^esse / and lift up his eyes in making a little syghe anguysshous / for
other thing could he not answer. Helayne apperceyued that he had but little
knowledge / wherefore she approached more nerer / and said with a low voice. Alas
my friend what lack ye / will ye leave me a wydowe / do ye not know y^ the
end of the twelve monthe approaches By my troth my friend your maladye does
grieve me so sore that ye can not believe it / wherefore I pray you that ye will
think for to guarysshe you / and if there be any thing that I can do for you
/ tell it me. And eue^ so god help me mine honor salued / I know no man for
whom I would do more than for you.

How Olyuer after that the fair Helayne had vysyted him came to the court /
and of the messenger of the Kings of Irlande / sent to the King of England
/ for to defye him of fire and blood. Capitulo. xxxix.
AS Olyuer herd y^ sweet voice of his maystres that recomforted him so swetely
/ he forced him for to speak / and with great pain thanked her / and with
pain might he absteyne him from saying that she was cause of his death / and
as she that loved him / said to him / Fair sir think for to wax hole / and
come to ye court For upon my faith ye shall be right welcome. Then she took
leave of him and returned / and it was never a day after / but that she shente
for to know how he did / and with that she sent him right largely of her
wynes / and did so much that within short time he was strou^ge enough for
to promayne him about his chamber / as he that had had a good physycyen in his
maladye. And it was not long after that he went in to the court / and when
he felt himself that he was entyerly hole / he served his maystres as he had
done before The which made him greter chere than she was accustomed to do. In
such wise y^ Olyuer was more beauteuous than ever he had be^ before. Helayne
that apperceyued that Olyuer was out of danger / put him in remembrance of
the regrettes and complayntes that she had made for him during his maladye /
whereof Olyuer had his heed diverse times sore troubled. It happened upon a
whytsontyde / on the which day he held open court. And there was the most
part of the lords of England assembled / even so as he was at dinner / and
his daughter set beside him / came a messanger before the table / the which
began for to say. That same god all puyssaunt / that governs all things /
give honor and glory and good adventure to the high and puyssaunt princes /
and my sovereign lords the seven kings of Irlande / by whom I am sent
hither / and that he confound the crown of England / the which is not
worthy to be named King. Now harken tyrant what I have in charge for to say
to the by the kings of Irlande. They send the word by me / and defyeth the
of fire and blood / and that they will depose the of thy realm / as he that
is not worthy for to hold it Some of them has been comen to thy court for to
know more plainly thy gouernynge / whereas they have apperceyued thy great
crude lyte and tyranny / and how that by thy synguler and dampnable will /
has accomplysshed thy tyranny on cold blood withouten any cause reasonable
/ wherefore thou art cause of the effusyon of blood humayne / and of the
semblable christian. And therefore take heed to that which thou have to do. For
I tell the that they ben already descended on thy ground / and shall do such
Justice on the as apperteyneth.

How Olyuer after that the messanger had fynysshed his words / required the
king of England for to give him men of arms / and that he would goo against
them / the which was vttred upon him with a good will. Capitulo. xl.


FYnysshed the words of the messanger / the king enclyned his heed / and sone
after lift it up again / and began to roll his eyes / and to bend his brows
in such wise that here sembled a man extracte out of his mind / When the
messenger saw the king make such chere / he would with a good will have been
in his moders belly. There was none that answered / for the court at that time
was to troubled that it was great meruayll to behold it / for all they in the
halle kept scylence / and said never a word. When the valiant Olyuer saw
all the company so sore abashed for so little a thing / as him seemed / he
set himself on his knees before the kings person / and all ashamed began
for to speak and said Right mighty Emperor and redou^ted sir. I beseech you
that your ryall mayeste be not dysmayed against me / if that I auaunce me to
speak sooner than I ought to do. Sir ye have herd the iniuryes that these
caytyfs kings of Irlande has unposed on you by the saying of the herauldes.
And for because that I know you so valiant and so puyssau^t / and with that
that ye had lever deye than it should abide thus without vengynge you on your
enemies / that already ben entered in to your realm / wherefore I supplye me in
all humylyte that unto me young man / notwithstanding that I am not dygne /
and that I have little seen unto this present time that ye will do me that
honor for to give me a certain nombre of men of arms / such as your good
pleasure shall be / and that ye shall find by the delyberacyon of your good
counsayll / for to go against these unhappy folk / that without cause will
usurp you lordshyppe. The king answered unto Olyuer and said Olyuer I shall
counsayll me on the request that ye make to me after dinner / and after I shall
make you to know my will. And then he commanded that the messaunger of the
Kings of Irlande should be set to dinner. And so it was done. Wha^ the king
was risen from the table / he assembled his counsayll. And then was given an
answer to the messanger that he should say to his masters that they might be
well sure that the King doubted them but little / and that he had good will
for to keep his heritage / and that if they might wynne^^ that it should be
theyres / but by the pleasure of god it should not happen so / and then they
gave some gift unto the messanger. And then the said messanger departed and
returned toward the kings of Irla^de that already were entered into the realm
of England / to whom he told the answer that he had received. And then y^
king of England accorded to Olyuer his request / for the great valiantness
y^ he had seen him do before times. And gave to him.x. thousand men of arms /
the which comen he took leave of the king / and the king gave him four
thousand nobles at his departing / the which Olyuer took in good thank. But
before that he departed from the cite he dystrybued it unto the poor men of
arms that had need thereof / and more to / and he did so much that they
spoke of nothing but of his great largess / wherefore he gate the love of
every body. And in y^ manner departed after that he had taken leave of his may
stresse / the which commanded him unto god. And he spedde him so well on his
Iourneye that he came with in three mile of his enemies. And when it came to
their knowledge they raised up their syege that they had laid about a strong
place / and put them all upon a plain in fair ordenaunce ready to abide
bataylle. Olyuer in like wise prayed and required all his men for to do well /
in showing them that they should have more honor without comparyson / if
any good adventure happened them / than if the king were there in his person
/ and each of them promised to do his deuoyre. And in that good will they
approached so nere their enemies that they might se them clearly / the which
were four against one man. But they were not men of such chap for the most
part were comune men and evil armed at all points.

How Olyuer after that he was departed from London in arms came before a town
that was besyeged of the Iryssheme^ / and how he fought with them and
vaynquysshed them. Capitulo. xlj.


Right so as these two hoostes approached to gyder / ye might have herd such a
noise that it was hydeous to here / and when it came to the strokes gyuynge /
ye should have seen sheldes c^ouen / and helmes and hauberkes broken / stedes
and knights smyten down / hedes and arms cut of / and many one pulled down
that never rose after. Olyuer went thrughe the battle maulgre all his enemies
/ and did such deeds of arms that he made him to be known within a little
stounde of every body / wherefore they fled before him and made him way. For
all that he hytte he smote down / none can not rehearse unto you the meruaylous
strokes that he gave / for both his friends and his enemies were all abashed
to behold them. He escryed as hye as he might / if the kings of Irlande be
here I shall make them crowns. One of the kings of Irlande that was a
valiant man took a great spear in his hand and came toward Olyuer / Olyuer
that saw him come pulled a spear from him that was next him / and smote his
horse with the sporres and met together so strongly that it was not in the
horses puyssaunce to sustain them / wherefore both fell to the earth / but the
king never arose after / for Olyuer had perced his hauberke and smyten him to
the heart / whereof it was great dommage / for he was a valyaunte man. Then ye
should have seen Englysshmen and Irysmen run to the socoure of their lords
and there was slain much people on both sides. Olyuer was on sote amongst
his enemies where as he smote on the right hand and of the left hand / and
did such deeds of arms that it was great meruayll. His cutty^ge sword made
his enemies to flee before hy^. For all that maulgre them all he mounted on his
horse / and then began the battle more fyers and more aspre than it had been
of all the day before. And in that same bataylle / Olyuer with his propre
hands took two of the most grettest Kings of Irlande. And then after that
Olyuer with great pain perced the host and did so much that in despyte of
all his enemies / he came unto the chyef standarde of the Irysshmen / the
which by force of arms he smote down to the ground / and with one stroke he
smote of his heed that bare the standarde / and so he deyed / Then ye should
have seen Irysshemen gretely abashed wha^ they saw their chyfe standarde fall
to y^ earth they took great pain for to rere it up again / but they could
not. And fynably / by y^ valiantness of Olyuer and the courage that he gave
his men the Irysshemen were dyscomfyted / and so they fled. The chase endured
more than two mile / and there was so many slain y^ it was a pyteous sight
for to behold it / and every body saved him that might. And than they came by
night and by dare to their ships / and in great have they entered in to their
ships / and sailed in to Irlande where as they told their pyteous
dyscomfyture that gave great dyscomforte unto all them of that country.
Olyuer made to sown the retreyte / to the end that none went ferder forth /
wherefore every body returned. And when it came to repasse by the way where as
the battle was done / and saw the great effusyo^ of blood / there was none of
them but that their hertes abhorred. And Olyuer himself had the teres in his
eyes and said. My blessed creator I pray the that by thy great mercy thou
will pardon me the effusyon of blood of these christian men. Nevertheless take
that Olyuer said these words / yet he was right Joyous and glad of the
vyctorye / and gave louynges and thankynges to almighty god / with a good
heart. In that manner they came unto the town that had been assyeged before of
the Irysshemen / where as they were received with great tryumphe and Joy and
with processyon of all the chyrches / and all the belles were rongen at his
entering. And they gave Olyuer great gifts / the which he gave unto his men /
and in likewise of all the butyn that he had won he would have nothing.
After he sent for the capytaynes of his army / and when they were comen he
said to them / fair lords ye know the vyctorye that god of his grace has
given to us against our enemies. And therefore it should be good to sygnefye
these tidings to the King our soueraylle lord. Wherefore I pray you that the
deed bodies may be nombred / to the end that we may write to him the more
certaynlye. It was told him y^ the king should have shortly tidings / for
it should be to long to abide the telling of them. But as it seemed them they
might not fail to write.xx.M. of their enemies deed / without putting other
nombre / and few of their men.

How Olyuer sent word to the King of England of their vyctorye. And of the
enterprise that Olyuer made to go into Irlande. Capitulo. xlii.
ANd wha^ the lettres were made by Olyuer and by the lords / they were given
unto a messaunger / and badde him make all dylygence that he could / the which
he did / and when he was comen to London he presented them to the king / and
when the king had read them allow / ye may well think that he was right
Joyous and glad. And therefore he made them for to be read on high / and
when it came to the knowledge of them of the court / there was none but that he
thanked god. And the King commanded that these tidings should be publysshed
all about. And after mounted on horsbacke and diverse other lords in his
company and so came to the cathedral church of Poules in ye which he, gave
louynges / and praysynges to our lord / and to the valyaunte Olyuer. I
return here to Olyuer the which assembled all the gretest of his army / and
demanded them if they had any talent to do a good thing / And they answered
ye and that it should not hold at them Then Olyuer said / my lords friends
and fellows god has given us so fair aue^ture that we can never thanbe hy^
enough. Therefore me seems seeing our good beginning if that it stycke not
at you we may do yet some good thing. For ye ought for to know that there
was never men more abashed than our enemies were when they knew the veryte
how it went / that one of their kings was slain / and the other twain taken
/ and with this all their men of war slain / in whom they affyed them. And
thus the^ as me seems seeing y^ we be not far from their marches / if that
we put us in to their country hastily / before that their great anguysshe and
sorrow were passed / and without gyuynge them leyser to think on their
affairs / we should find them so vnpurueyde / that in them should be little
resystence / and there is mine aduyce under correccyo^ / for as me seems if
that we might conquer this country ye should be worthy to have great loving
and reco^mendacyon / and shall be dynge never to be put out of memory amonst
the noble and valyannt men. Those capytaynes herynge the words of Olyuer
preysed him much in their hertes / and well seemed them that that which he
had said proceeded of a high and noble courage / therefore all of one accord
without long counsayl said unto him. Olyuer we ben departed for to serve the
King against his enemies / and the after / and therefore we tell you that
where someuer ye will go / we shall follow you as they that will live and deye
with you / and never too fail you. Olyuer seeing the affection of those noble

How Olyuer entered in to Irlande and assyeged a king / the which was socoured
of four other kings / that the said Olyuer dyscomfyted. Capitulo. xliij.


BY this manner was concluded the vyage in to Irlande / and took in the town as
many pauelyons and te^tes as they might get / and all thing that was
necessary for their vyage / and departed from thens / and took with them a
thousand men on horsbacke / and as many on foot / without their nombre. And
also they took with them as much artyllerye and other habyllementes of war
as that they might well have without dysgarnysshynge of the town / and it was
told them before their departing / by them that had charge for to bury the
deed folk y^ they had found deed of their enemies.xxiiij.M. and of their
me^.xij.C. wherefore their friends were right dyspleasaunt. And they assembled
ships and entered into y^ see / and did so much that in short time they
were out of the realm of England / and entered in to Irlande where as they
began for to do much harm / and found but few places that resysted against
them / for they be not so strong as these of this regyon. They that were taken
by force had no mercy but that they slew them all. They that did yield them
to them before that they besyeged them / were taken to mercy. And with this they
fered so sore their enemies / that the most part of them yielded them or they
came to them. Then ye kings of y^ country that were escaped fro the battle
were so sore abashed that they could not put no consayll to their affairs /
for their folk were yet full of sorrow / because of the dolorous fortune that
had happened them. Wherefore they habandonned all in the will of god / and
alonely fortefyed the places where as they would retray them / but this was not
but that they gave often assaults and scarmoshes to the Englyshmen right
subtyllye governed on their side / wherthrughe there was many men slain on
both parties. And in such wise by succession of time that the most part
yielded them to the^ And ye rich themself helped for to war against their
lords. In that estate they went and assyeged a place / where as one of the
kings of Irlande was / that had been new crowned. And was his sone that
Olyuer did slay at the torneyment. The which they assaylled right quyckely /
and boystously / and there was done on the one side and on the other great
deeds of arms For they that were within the castle defended them vygorously /
so that they received that day but little dommage. The king Maquemor was
aduertysed of these, things / and how the fyege was before the place of his
cousyn. Wherefore he was right dyspleasaunt. And swore by his crown that it
should not abide se. He assembled as much folk as he might. And then he the
third king came for to arise the syege. Olyuer was aduertysed of all these
things / wherefore he put himself on the field for to abide them. And left a
party of his folk for to keep the syege. He put his folk in ordinance / and
abode his enemees all ready for to fight / the which a^ode not long or y^ they
came. And when they saw that Olyuer was already on the field / they knew well
that they could not escape without medlynge. And then they put their folk in
right fair ordenaunce / and began for to shote gonnes and Olyuer and his folk
remeuyd not / but abode the^ with ferme foot / and with one cry received them
at the points of their swerdes and speres. And there was slain at the first
recountre diverse me^ on both parties. Full many ladies lost their lords / and
many children were faderles / and full many maidens lost their lovers there
Olyuer cut of hedes and arms in such manner that never man did more deeds
of arms than he did. Not withstanding the Irysshmen sold their lives right
derely / as men replenysshed with prowess / for as them seemed and they lost
that battle / that in like wise they should lose their country / wherefore
their courage doubled and did as well as they might. In that estate dured the
battle almoost unto their night / but in the end the Irysshemen were
dyscomfyted / as they that might not endure the ^adde strokes of the
Englysshemen. The pursuyte dured not long because of the night The King
Maquemor and two other kings were taken / whereof Olyuer was right glad / for
he had already five / and so there was no moo left but two / whereof there abode
one enclosed in y^ place where the syege was when the night was comen Olyuer in
his tente made the Kings prisoners to be served right honorably. And on y^
morrow he made to cry that every body should put him in pain for to do his
deuoyre to take ye place. Then ye should have seen many a valiant knight and
squyre / and me^ of arms go to the assault but they of within defended them
so valyau^tly that it was great meruayll. And the king said that he had
lever deye than for to yield him in to the hands of his enemies / and to him
that had slain his fader.

How the castle and place where as one of the Kings of Irlande was in was
taken. Capitulo. xliiij.
Even so as ye have herd endured the syege by long space of time before y^
castle. During the which time Olyuer made often the king of England to
know of his demeanynge And sent him often word that he should have no
doubt of them / for they had nothing but good The artellerye that was there
endommaged strongely the castle / and so much that a great part of the wall
was smyten down / and then it was assaylled at that side. Olyuer was in that
assault and bare him so valyauntly that he was the first that entered in /
wherefore al his men followed him. And at that time was the castle won / and
the king taken. But before that he was taken he did great deeds of arms / and
all the other were slain. Olyuer departed from thens / and left good garnyson
there. He put him on the way for to goo conquer the realm of the sone of him
that he had slain in the first battle. But that same king abode not his
coming / but came against Olyuer without any armoure at all / berynge in his
hand a branch of Olyue in y^ sign of peace. And when he saw Olyuer he said
to hy^ O right valiant conqueror / before whom nothing can endure / by the
furoure of thy sword thou haste subdued seven kingdoms / and have the kings
prisoners wherefore I know that my person alonely can not resyste against thy
person and puyssaunce. Therefore I come and yield me at thy will / and do offer
me and my realm for to serve the. Olyuer thanked him and took him by the
hand / and said that he should soupe with him that night. Then Olyuer
commanded that the te^tes should be pyght in a fair grene field that was no
far from the^ / by the which diverse ryuers and fountaynes passed by /
wherefore the place was more delectable. Olyuer commanded that the kings that
had be^ prisoners of long time / the which were abyden in a strong for
tresse not far from the^ should be brought to him / and made to say to his
cook that he should make ready the souper in y^ best manner that he could / for
he would feast the seven kings in his pauylyon. And wha^ the hour of souper
approached / he made them to sytte down at a table / and souped rychely. After
souper Olyuer made auoydaunce / and said unto the seven kings how that they
were prisoners / not to come of them / but at the pleasure and will of the king
of England / that they had so vylaynously offended and made great doubt
that he would punysshed them grievously as it apperteyned / and told them that
they should be led to him on the next morrow / and that they should think on
that that they would do / for to amend the offense that had been done by
them.



How Olyuer after diverse things / sent for to denounce his coming to the
king of England / and of the honor that was done to him. Capitulo. xlv.
SOne after diverse words came ye spyces and ye wine / and after they went
unto bed unto the morrow / yt every body by the commandment of the
capytayns made the^ ready to depart and so every thing packed and trussed
they returned toward London. And than Olyuer called unto him a right valiant
knight and one of ye capytaynes English / to whom he prayed much curtaysly
that he would goo toward the king and denounce to him their coming / and
that he could tell him the things better than any could write them. The
knight in accomplysshynge the will of Olyuer put hy^ self on the way and he
did so much that within a little space he arrived at London / and salued the
king / and made the reco^maundacyons right humbly from Olyuer and all his
fellows / and than he began to tell him how they were on ye way to return /
and that ye seven kyngedomes of Irlande were conquered / and put in ye
obeyssaunce of his septre. And that Olyuer brought him the seven kings
prisoners for to do with them his good pleasure. And began to deuyse him of ye
valyaunce that he had seen Olyuer do / and that with pain it was credyble that
the which he had seen Olyuer accomplysshe. And said sire after god and his
holy mother give thankynges unto the right valiant knight Olyuer / for by his
right arm ye have obtained vyctory of all your enemies. And certainly I think
that never god gave to no man so much goodness as he has given to this same.
The king herynge those Joyous tidings was so replenysshed with Joy that he
was a long space or that he might speak. Nevertheless sone after he enbraced
the knight and said. My friend ye be right welcome I thank god / the arms /
and the sword of the right gentle knight / of the Joyous tidings that ye
bring me. And after commanded him for to tell it on high. So he began for to
recounte it more longer than he had done to the kings person. And always
pray sing and loving Olyuer / saying that it was a thing of the other world
/ and not for to believe to them that had not seen it. These tidings were sone
spredde about in the ladies chambres / and came to the ceres of the fair
Helayne that was much Joyous of that which she herd / and her thought that
and he had been king and she queen / that all the world should have be^ the
better. Wherefore her courage blamed strongly her fader because that he kept
from so gentle a knight that y^ which was due to him. The king inquired and
demanded the day of his coming / and made to ordeyne a right great feast at
their coming. He commanded all the great lords and princes of his realm for
to be there And when it came that Olyuer approached nere the Cite / all the
princes went against him / and there was none of them but that they did him
honor and reverence. The king had ordained that he should be led in
great tryumphe thorughe the cite. And therefore the strete^ were hanged / and
the fyres alyghted / and the belles rougen on all sides. Also the processyons
on all sides went against him to the gate of the cite. And when (...)
apperceyued the processyons he alyghted of his (...) and consequently all the
great lords that did him that honor. And in that estate they came unto ye
cathedral church of Poules where as they gave than^ kings and louynges to
almighty god and to our lady And then they mounted on horsbacke / and then
Olyuer sent the seven kings prisoners in to ye places that we reordeyned for
them. And he all armed went toward the king / the which he salued right
humbly. Wha^ the king apperceyued him he went against him / and began for to
kiss him and colle him saying / my right sweet friend / blessed be the fader
that engendered the / and the mother that bare the. And thanked be my blessed
lord that ever gave the will for to come in to this country the which at this
present time is so gretely honored and redoubted by thy sword. I pray to
god that he give me space for to deserve it to you ward Olyuer answered to
him. Sir thank our lord / and after the valiant men that ye gave to me / and
not me / for take that I have done the best that I can / yet I have not
deserved the honor that ye do to me. The king answered that he was
aduertysed of every thing / and commanded him to go and dysarme him. And when
the hour of souper should approach that he should return / and that he should
bring with him the seven kings / for he would soupe with them in his palace.
Olyuer went toward his maystres / to whom the king had commanded / that
all the honor that she could make him / that she should do it. And therefore
when she saw Olyuer come to ward her / she went against him and took him by
the hand and kyssed him in saying that he was right welcome / and that she was
glad of his welfare / but because that the souper time approached that he should
^etche the kings prisoners / he abode not long there / but took leave and
went in to his lodging.

please him / in to ye lodgys of the seven kings the which he salued / and
said to them that the King his lord would speak with them and soupe with them
/ they said that they would go gladlye / and mounted on horsbacke / and Olyuer
also with them that conduyted them. And wha^ they entered in to the court
diverse lords / and princes of England came against them that did led them
to ward the king / the which when he law them in his chamber / he remeuyd
not from his place / y^ other bowy^ge their knees low enough. And when they
approached nere the king / the king took of his hatte and in marchynge three or
four paas against them / said that they were right welcome. And when he had
salued the^ all / he began for to deuyse with them of diverse thyng^s pleasant
without making any mencyon of war. And so long they were in these deuyses
that the hour of souper was comen / and the water blown. The King of
England had ordained that three tables should be set in the halle. One more
eleuate and higher tha^ the other. And at that table the king satte him down
/ and commanded Olyuer for to sytte with him / the which durst not dysobeye
the kings commandment. And therefore all ashamed he satte hy^ down / and
there was no moo. After he commanded that the Kings of Irlande should be
set. The master co^troller that knew well enough what he should do / made
them for to sytte at the second table / and all the other princes the which
were without nombre satte at the third table / and were right sumptuously
served.

How the king of England gave his fair daughter unto Olyuer in guerdon and
reward of the hye seruyces that he had done to him. Capitulo. xlvij.


Right as they had souped / and that the tables were taken up / and graces
rendered unto god / the king commanded for to go fetch his fair dougter
Helayne / to the end that the dau^ces were begonne^. And the noble and
valiant knight Olyuer went for to fetch his goodly and excelleut maystres.
And when that she was comen and that she had salued her fader / she salued
after the seven kings / even so as she could full well do it / and the other
lords ensewynge. Then were the daunces begone the which the king beheld
gladly. And in beholdy^ge Olyuer dau^ce / he thought in him self how it should
be possible for to render to him the guerdon of his service And thought so
much that a more gretter thing he might not give him than his daughter /
that before he had wo^ne by force of arms / but because that he had taken her
from him / paraue^ture he would have dysdayne for to take her again / wherefore
he concluded for to speak to him after the dau^ces in the presence of all them
that were there / or that would be there. And even so as he had thought it he
did it. And when all was faylled / and that his daughter was comen for to give
him good night. He made to be said to her that when she should be in her
chamber / that she should not hye her unto bed The which did even so. After
he called Olyuer in the presence of the kings of Irlande / and of the other
princes and lords that were there. Olyuer my friend I begin for to have
knowledge of my caas / and how that of long time I have with holde^ that which
ought to be yours / that is my daughter. That the which did move me thereto
was because that I knew not / so plainly your estate as I do now. But truly
and Helayne were queen of all ye world I would think her well bestowed onyou /
as to the most valyauntest knight of ye world Thus I then knowing all these
things shall give to you the most derest thing that I have / y^ is my
daughter / if it please you for to take her to your wife. Whereby after my death
ye may be king of England / the which would be right happy to have such a
lord. The^ fynysshed the king his words. When Olyuer saw that the king had
fynysshed his words / he set him on both his knees / and began to say
these words. Right honorable lord / truly there is no service but of a
king for I may well auaunte me / that with little deseruynge I have the gretest
guerdon that ever had man / whereof I give louynges to god and to you graces
and thanks / nor never poor man as I am had the hondrethe part of the
honor that ye do to me. I pray to god that he give me grace to deserve it
unto your highness. For by you my name shall be changed / and they that shall
here speak of this matter / shall name me the servant hyghly guerdonned.

THen the king commanded Olyuer for to arise / and sent for his daughter.
And when she was comen / he took her by the hand and leddeher to him and said.
My friend se here my daughter that I give you to your wife / in acquytynge my
promise. Olyuer thanked him right humblye. The poor Helayne that of all this
knew nothing / was more abashed than ever she had been before / and began for
to change color / whereby her beauty was nor mynysshed. When the king saw
her in that estate / he said to her. My right dear daughter I have all troubled
you as seems me / wha^ I have given you to a man without knowing your will.
But by the help of god he shall do nothing to you but that ye may well suffer
and endure / as I deem. Then Olyuer began for to laughe at the words that the
king had said. Wherefore Helayne was more ashamed than she had been before The
archebysshop that was in the halle did handfeste them. Then began for to speak
by the kings commandment an au^cyent knight / ye which adressyd his words
unto the kings of Irlande / and said to them that the king his sovereign
lord for the love of the solemp nyte that should be on the morrow / and also
for the love of Olyuer / he was content to render to them their realms /
quyte their raunsons / and send them again in to their countrees without any
dommage / by such moyen / that each of them should do him homage / and hold
of him their lands. With this that as often as y^ kings good pleasure should
be for to send for the^ / in war / or in peace / that they should come and
serve hy^. And fro thens forth to hold him for their sovereign lord / They
knowing that of two euylles it is the best to eschew the worste / accorded
to the kings request / and did homage unto the king of England. And after
these things / and that they had daunced ones about for the espousayles every
body went to bed / but Olyuer slepte not that night / but watched al yt
night / as he y^ would with a good will have been a day elder / and thanked god
of his goodness. For him semyd that he was lift out of his evil adventure /
and so passed the night. And when the day was comen and that it was time for
him to arise / the king that knew well enough that Olyuer could not have his
gowns made so soon / sent him / three or four gowns of clothe of gold
beten. And wha^ Olyuer was apparaylled / all the princes and lords came and
fetched him / and five kings of Irlande came / and the other twain abode for
to accompany the fair Helayne.

How Olyuer wedded the fair Helayne / and of y^ solempnyte of the
espousaylles. Capitulo. xlix.
Right sone after that all these things were ready. Olyuer came in to ye court
acco^panyed as ye have herd before / and went to ye portall of ye chapel /
where as he found ye Arche bishop ready. They had not be^ long there when
that they herd coming to them great foyson of trompettes / and mynstrelles /
and began for to sown / and come to ward the chapel after them / and there
came diverse kings and herauldes of arms / and after came the Usshers And
after them then came Helayne aourned as it apperteyneth to a bryde / and to a
lady of so ryall a lygnage. She was accompanied of diverse ladies and
damoyselles that followed her. And with this she was on the right hand of two
kings. And came a soft paas unto the place where as Olyuer abode her / And
they had not ben long there when the king came / at whose coming they were
wedded. The service was done. The tables were laid / and then they set them to
dinner after that the ladies were returned from the chambres. Who that would
deuyse to you the scruyce of the said dinner / the gifts that were given as
well on the one syd^ as on the other / it should be to long a thing to
recou^te. The young men of the kings court that never were dyfferent to no
thing that was for Iustes made cry a Iustynge for the after dinner / where as
the ladies were. Also a torneyment was cried.xvj. against xvi. that was a right
fair sight to se. Olyuer Iusted not because he should not be defouled / and to
the end that he should be fresshe for to dance at night / but he was mounted
on a great courser and did meruaylles. He served one of the kings of Irlande
/ that for to do him honor Iusted / and four of the other also. And did so
well that twain of the five had the price / one within / and the other
without. And it was given them or that they departed from the tyltes / as they
that had done best. And after that every body was come^ to the court the
ladies were clothed in new gowns. And then they went to the banquet that was
already apparaylled. If they were well served it is no need to demand it. For
there was never a fayrer feast in England / after that of the great torneyment
/ that had been before. And when it was after the banquet ye daunces began / and
Olyuer led the fair Helayne at the daunces / that every body saw gladly.
For all the world said that they had never seen a more fayrer couple of folk
together. After that y^ daunces had endured a long space of time / the far
and noble Helayne was led unto bed. And then wine and spyces were brought.
The which Olyuer abode not / For he was already in his chamber where as he
dysabylled him. And when he knew that the bryde was a bed / incontyn^nt he put
him on the way toward the chamber. And when he was there he chased all the
ladies out except one. And came toward the table where as the banquet was on
/ and kest it to the earth / to the end that he sho^de not be awaked / then he
came to the door / and locked it / and went to bed to her that of long time
he had loved / and she hated him not / wherefore they were the better content
together / and of the surplus I hold my peace. But the hystorye says that upon
that same night they engendered a child male / the which did sithe much
good / and exalted our cryste^ faith against the sarasyns / in vengynge the
death of our lord Ihesucryst.

How Olyuer was virtuous in appesynge stryfes / and noyses / and how his wife
was gre^e with a sone / the which was named Henry. Capitulo. L.
When it came to the kings knowledge that Olyuer had casten down the table y^
the ba^ker was on / he began for to laughe. And said y^ he had right well
wrought / wherefore no body would not meddle for to enter in y^ chamber / and was
not awaked of no body unto the moro we / at a.xi. of the clock / and y^ the
king had dyned / the which came unto the chamber door / and began for to
call them / and said that it was day and time for to rise / Olyuer the which
slepte not came in his sherte and opened the door to the king / the which
entered alone / and came unto his daughters bed / where as he comforted her as
well as he might. In saying y^ he knew it well of long ago that she was to
young for to sleep with the me^. The which answered nothing unto him for any
thing that he could do. Wherefore he took leave of her / and said to her that
she was evil content with him sithe that she would not speak to hy^. After
that he was departed / the ladies came and took her up. Then when she was
ready she went to mass / but this was not without foyson of regardes of diverse
lords and ladies / the which with one accord Iuged y^ she halted not. The
mass was said / and the dinner passed / the which was right plenteuous of all
goods. And ye king held open court by the space of.xv. days / after the
which all the lords took leave of him. And the king abode in his simple estate
/ reserved that Olyuer had his estate as a kings sone / and retained diverse
gentylmen of his court The kings of Irlande took their leave for to return
home / In offrynge them always at ye kings pleasure / and Olyuers / for god
had given him such grace that every body loved him. The debates and dyscordes
among the gentylmen. Olyuer appeased to his power. The poor knights by his
largess were made rich. He was the defendour of wydowes and Orphelyns / and
to his power to all dyscomforted and dyssolute he gave comfort and cou^sayll.
Shortly all virtues that were possible to be in a man's mortal body /
florysshed in this right valiant and gentle knight / in such wise that every
body louyd him and blessed his coming. And held the king for wise and
prudent that so sone could know his co^dycyons / and that he had so kept his
daughter to mary her so virtuously / without thy^kynge on couetyse / so the
king lived in great ease within his court / and in great louy^ge and glory
without. And was so much fered and redoubted that none durst do him
dyspleasure / but was master and lord of all his neighbors. The fair and
good Helayne that was with child was not of less recommendacyon against her /
for all virtues that a woman ought for to have habounded in her. It happened
that after that she had borne her term / she was delivered of a pair sone /
the which was named at the font stone Henry. And this child gave so much
Joy to the king / and to all them of the realm y^ it was metuayll But that
same child wist and knew that he ought yet to be the most derest holden of
all the other. For he was one of the best and valyauntest knights that ever
was Nevertheless he was not king of England / for he deyed young / whereof it
was great dommage. A long time did pass and so much that the fair Helayne
was with child again / the which was delivered of a fair daughter / y^
which was right solempnelye baptized and she was named Clarysse. The fair
Helayne and Olyuer were so assotted and doted on their children that it was a
great meruayll / and I am not abashed. For they ought well to be so. The mother
had them always between her arms / and might not forgo the sight of them. It
was the pass time of Olyuer / for the realm of England was in peace / and
wist not wherein to occupye him save to goo on hunting / and haukynge / and for
to make good chere.

How Olyuer went on hunting / and of the vysyon of his wife the which she
told unto hy^. Capi. lj.
OLyuer passed his time Ioyously / so as ye have herd. It happened that the
hunters made him to know that the grettest wild bore that ever was seen / was
in the forest five mile thens. Olyuer that loved well hu^tynge was right Joyous
/ and said that he would go right gladly / wherefore on an after none he
departed from the cite / and lodged him in a vyllage by y^ forest where the
wild bore was in. That night his wife dremed a meruaylous dreme / for her
thought that she was on hunting with her lord / and that she saw a Tygre
meruaylously great / that with his teeth / and his nails devoured Olyuer / and
bare him away she wyste not where Of his vysyon all trymblynge the fair
Helayne awaked / and could not sleep after that. And on the morrow she sent
word to her lord / and required him that he would not hunte as for that day
/ for and he did her heart Iuged her that he should have some hurt. Olyuer
herynge the message of his wife did no thing but laughe / for him seemed y^
dremes were but fantasyes / wherefore he sent word to his wife that she should
make good chere / and that he would bring her some venyson / then he mounted
on horsbacke and went to y^ forest / and uncoupled the hounds / and began for
to hunte. The^ Olyuer put him in to the forest / and followed the hounds /
wherefore he did folly. For if he had byleued the counsayll of his wife / it
had not happened to him as it did For so as he followed the hounds as nere as
he might the wild bore came that was on foot / and trauersed before him.
Olyuer that was welhorsed smote him with the sporres / and ran after. And he
did so much that he had lost all his men within a little while. Alas if he
had known of the evil adventure / he would not have put him so soon in the
forest / but as he that took no head rode on always without keeping any way /
so as his evil adventure led him. O king of England truly of a long time
thou shalt not se thy fair sone Olyuer / nor thou right fair Helayne of a
long time thou shall not se thy lord and husband.



How the Kings sone of Irlande / of which Olyuer had slain his fader at the
torneyment / found Olyuer all alone from his me^ / and took him prisoner / and
of the great sorrow that was made for him. Capitulo. lij.
Before that Olyuer apperceyued that no body did follow him / he was far from
his folk. And when he found himself alone / he blewe his horn / but none
answered him Wherefore he put him on the way in an unhappy hour. For the more
that he went forward / the ferder he was from them. Thus as he went so the
wild bore that was far from him / came amongst a company of men that passed
thorughe the forest / the which went to London. And the chyef was one of the
kings of Irlande / that same that Olyuer had slain the fader of at the
torneymente. As he saw the wild bore / with such hounds as he had he
followed / and ran so much in the forest that they recou^tred Olyuer which
was all alone. Then Olyuer auaunced him and salued the king / but the king
dysdayned to speak to him. And he escryed to his men saying / here is the
murderer that has slain my fader. Wherefore I do pray you that ye will take
hy^ alive / for I can not avenge me better than at this time. And when Olyuer
herd these words he sethande to his sword / and defended him right
valyauntly. But in the end whether he would or not he was taken. And the king
made a hode all close to be put on his heed / to the end that he should not be
known / and in that estate he made him to be led to a port of y^ see where
as he was put in a ship and led in to a fortress of Irlande that was that
same kings. In the which Olyuer was put in prison full of vermyne / and had
bread and water ones a day. Abiding the retornynge of the king / that should
do Justice on him at his pleasure. And to the end that his treason were not
known / he returned not / but went to London toward the king his sovereign
lord / y^ which he found gretely dyscomforted / for he had herd no tidings
of Olyuer the which was sought on all sides. O what pyteous and innumerable
lamentacyons was made when y^ truth was known that he could not be founden.
Certaynlye never so great dolours was not demeaned in no country The good king
said. Ha right noble realm thou have well lost the flower of thy crown / and
the most part of thyn armoure. Alas my right sweet sone thou was he y^
trauaylled when I reposed me / and he by whom I was redoubted / and he by
whom I was obeyed / and he by whom I lived in rest and in surete. These
regrettes were nothing in comparyson to the pyteous lamentacyons that his
daughter made. She might neither ete nor drink / but had laid her on a bed
as she had bendeed / in such wise that all they that saw her had great pity
on her. And when she might speak she escryed saying. My blessed creat our
wherefore did thou ever give me him / that in his departing does eve me in
so great doloure / and dystresse upon the earth / certes if it were thy blessed
pleasure I would be in his company / then she complanyed her unto the blessed
vyrgyn Marye in saying. Right sweet vyrgyn mary mother of god what may I have
done to the / that thou have separed me fro the sight of my right amyable lord
and husband that so derely loved me. With such or semblable words the right
fair Helayne meuyd all them about her / that they could not comfort her. I
shall leave her to speak of the king of England and his daughter / and all
them of his realm demeanynge their sorrow. And shall speak of them of the
realm of Castylle / and of Arthu^ King of Algarbe / and Regente of Castylle.

How Arthur King of Algarbe and Regent of Castyll made an enterprise for to
find his fellow Olyuer. Capitulo. liij.


WE have herd here before how Olyuer was departed from Castylle / and of the
meruaylous dule that the good king demeaned because of his departing / the
which never let him unto the death / for within short space it made him
fynysshe his days / and lyucd not long after the departing of his sone. For
the which cause Arthur king of Algarbe / and fellow of Olyuer / by the
consent of diverse lords of the country / was chosen for to be Regente of
Castylle unto the retornynge of Olyuer. And by cause that the affairs of the
realm of castyll be gretter than they of Algarbe the which is but a little
country. Arthur held him most in Algarbe. And forgate never to vysyte the
glass of his fellow. And so much that he apperceyued that the said glass
was such as the lettre specyfyed. That is for to know that the water was
troubled and gretely obscure. In such wise that it was almoost like ynke. And
when Arthur apper ceyued it such / with great haboundaunce of teres he began
for to say in this manner. O right noble right valiant and loyal fellow / I
se well that ye have some great empesshynge / or some evil adventure / or in
fermyte of body wherefore I am right dyspleasaunt. And because that at a need
one knows his friend I make auowe to god and promyseth him by the faith that
I owe unto him / and to the crown that I bear / that even as secretly as ye
departed from this realm / shall I depart also. Nor never as long as I live
shall I not rest / till that I know whether that ye be a live or deed. The^
in wypy^ge his eyes / he departed out of the chamber / and came in to a halle.
And commanded to make lettres for to assemble all the three estates / and all
the princes of the country. And when they were all assembled / he began for to
show them and said that it was not possible for him to govern both ye
realms well that he had in his charge. And therefore his will was for to
commyse some dyscrete prince in his stead to be Regent of Castyll. For he would
return in to that of Algarbe / because that he loved it more / for because
that it was his propre heritage / and that it was the place of his birth.
Therefore he would know of them / if it were their good pleasure y^ he resygned
his estate at his dyscrecyon to the most wysest as hy^ seemed. Or if they would
chese one after their dyscrecyon and counsayll. They answered. Right puyssaunt
king of Algarbe we have not holden you for Regente / but for king unto the
coming of Olyuer as ye do know / for we never found you dysobeyssaunt. And
also there is none of us but that we would do you as sone pleasure as to our
sovereign lord. Your will and departing is full grievous unto us. But sith it
is so that we can not keep you / chese which of us it shall please you and
give him your stead. For we shall hold your eleccyon. For all that we shall
never have man so dcre as you. Arthur thanked them / and did chese a good
prince that was right virtuous for to be regente. And then he took leave of them
in great wepynges. And then he took a certain nombre of men with him / and he
did somoche that within a short space he came in to his realm / and when he
was there / he recommaunded to his conestable all the governance of his
country. And after commanded al his men to obey to him / and said that he
would ge in to a place all alone / the which was not far of. And that with
the grace of god he would not tarry long. This done he departed in a fair
morning and went his way withouten any company / save of god alonely / to
whom I pray that he be in his guard / for great need he had thereof / as ye
shall here here after ward.

How Arthur departed / and put him on the way for to find his fellow / and of
the adventures that he had. Capitulo. liiii.
IN such manner as ye have herd departed the valiant and gentle Arthur from
his country. And began for to search tidings of his fellow / as he that had
will never for to rest till that he had herd tidings of him. The first
country that he arrived in was Portyngale / in the which he found nothing
that was pleasant unto him. After he sought the remenaunt of Spain / and came
in to that of France / and went so much on one side and other that he came
to Calys / where as he found men that went in to England / and therefore he
mounted on the sea for to go theder. Ye may well think that he was long in
searching the countries that ye have herd above. In this mean while Olyuer
his fellow was always in prison / with bread and water / and often bette as he
that had never hope to depart thens. And desired nothing but the death. As
Arthur was on y^ see for to go in to England / there happened a wind contrary
to arise on the sea / and drove them in to the marches that the maryners knew
not at that present time. But when that they had long beholden and seen it
/ they apperceyued that it was one of the countrees and realms of Irlande /
the ferdest from y^ of England. When Arthur herd say that it was one of the
realm of Irlande / he prayed them that they would set him a land / for as him
semyd / as sone might he here tidings of y^ which he sought / as in another
country / so as he did by the will of god even so as ye shall here. Wha^
Arthur was on ground / he went on foot in praynge our lord for to adresse
him on his way. He was well the space of two months in that country. And
when he would have any thing he must make some sign / or else they could
not understand him. He had neither horse nor mule for to ride on / wherefore
he went on foot / and so long he went that on a day he found himself in
a thycke forest / in the which diverse wild beestes did remain. They had
well made him sign that he should not enter in to that forest but he had not
vnderstonden them. He went all the day alonge the forest without finding of
any adventure. The night took him wherefore it was force to him for to sleep.
And when it came upon the morrow / he put him on y^ way right euylly broken
his fast. And he had not long gone when he apperceyued a great and an
horrible lion strongly oppressyd with hongre. For he had found no pray of
long time. Wherefore when Arthur saw and apperceyued that he came toward him
he appareylled him for to fight for he was armed at all points / and also he
had a good sword. He took of his mauntell and wound it about his arm / and
then he drew out his sword / and kyssed the hyltes / in recommaundynge him to
god / and went toward the lion / that doubted him but little. For wha^ it
came to approach he gave hy^ such a stroke with his pa^^es that he rent his
cloak / and mo than a hond^eth mayles of his haubergon. And it was force to
Arthur for to fall to the earth / but as a valiant knight he gate him on his
fece. And incontinent he began for to assayll the lion right asprely. And when
the lion ^elte ^ymself hurt / he began for to cast a cry so meruaylous that
all ye forest did ring of it. And Arthur recovered another stroke / and set
it so well on that he smote of his head / and so the lion deyed.

How Arthur being in the forest was assaylled of another meruaylous be / of
the which he was vyetoryous. lv.


AS Arthur saw that he was delivered of y^ lion / he thanked god with a meke
heart / and when it came unto y^ night and that he found him not out of the
forest / no more than if he had not remeuyd out of one place / he was much
dyspleasaunt / as he that of all the day had not eten / but his comfort was
when he thought upon saint Johan Baptyst that lived by rotes / and him semyd
that he should be right meschaunt if he might not live with such vytaylles for
a space of time. So he began for to search about the forest / and began for to
cete herbs and rotes such as he found by so great appetyte for hongre / that
he had never eten capon in his country that had seemed him so good. And when
the night came he put him on a little tree / for dread of dombe beestes. Then
within the night when the moon was fair and clear / he herd a thing come a
far that made so great a noise that it was a hydeous thing to here for in
his way he smote down all that he met to the earth And whysteled so hye
that it thrughe perced Arthurs eres. The which wha^ he herd that meruayll /
he began for to bliss him / in recommaundynge him unto god, praynge him for to
be his defendour against that be that he saw coming. And even so as he
recommaunded him to god / this meruaylous be came toward y^ tree that he
was mounted on / and smote the tree with his tail so empyteously that he fell
down to the earth / when the poor Arthur found himself on the ground / if
that he had fere and dread I am nothing ameruaylled / and I think well that
he would have be^ in his country again with a good will. But as a valyaunte
knight he prayed god that he would have mercy on his soul. For he thought that
his last day had been comen and set hand to his sword for to defend him /
if the beast assaylled him. For he had no will for to deliver y^ first assault
the beast was passed whereof Arthur was right Joyous / but within a while the beast returned to ward him again in enuyronnynge him Th^n he made him to
torn three or four tornes / and made him for to fall agay^st a tree so hard
that it lacked but little that the heart of the valiant Arthur did byrste.
Arthur was not so soon up but that the beast was beside him and he as wise
lenyd against a tree. And when y^ be thought for to have smyten him / he
smote ye tree / wherefore he endommaged him but little or naught. But her tethe
was long and cuttynge meruaylously / wherewith she strayned him in such wise
that if it had not ben the tree that he held him by / he should nothing
have resysted. For already he was so sore wounded that he had nothing on him
but that it was perced. He revenged him valyauntly and gave him great and sad
strokes but she had so hard a skin that in no wise he might dommage it.
The synke of her alonely grieved Arthur as much as all the remenaunt. The
which when he saw the beast that for nothing that he had done she was as
fresshe as she was at the beginning of the med lynge / he began for to reclayme
our lord / in praynge hy^ that he would have pity on his creature / and said.
Ha my right sweet lord and fellow by the cause I shall fynysshe here my life /
but and I had seen the before my death. I should end the surplus of my life
with a better will.

How Arthur lyenge in the wood all hurt / appeared to him an ancient knight
the which helyd hy^ / and after told unto him the place where as Olyuer was
prisoner in. Capitulo. lvj.


IN complaining him the beast kept him so straytlye that he smote him down
to the earth under him / and held him so fast with his nails that all that he
had hold of was in pyeces / in such wise that Arthur might not remeue him.
For all that our lord the which never forgeteth his friends at their need /
forgate not this ge^tyll knight / nor would not suffer the loss of him. For
ye be that held him so straytlye / let goo her hold that she held with
her feet / for to take him with the ^ethe to devour him / but when Arthur
felt his arms delivered / he that had yet his sword smote him under the
na^yll / the which was not so hard as the back / and thrysted him to the
heart. And when the beast felt him wounded / in casting a great cry let him
fall to the earth. And Arthur that felt him delivered / gave him so many
strokes that he slew him. It was not long after that the day came / but that
recomforted him nothing for he might not from one place / as he that abode but
he death / because of the wounds that he had received. And thus as he was in
danger as ye have herd / yet again he herkened toward the forest / and
apperceyued a thing coming toward him / wherefore he thought better to have been deed than before. Therefore he said / Right glorious vyrgyn Mary be mine
advocate / and that ye will to day present my poor soul before the face of
thy blessed sone. For I se will that the hour is comen that I must depart out
of this world. That thing approached more nerer and nerer. And when he was all
most at him. Arthur knew y^ it was a man clothed in white which began for to
say King of Algarbe god salueth the. And when Arthur herd him named king /
he made the sign of the cross and said unto him / art thou a thing of the
other world. I think y^ thou art transmysed from god / sith that by him thou
have salued me. For other wise thou could not have known my name / And
therefore I pray the that thou have pity on me / and that thou do so much that
I may be aledged of my hurtes / and that I may be put out of this forest
wherein I have had so much to suffer. This man answered to hy^ Arthur thou have
not failed for to say that I am of god For so it is. And think that I am comen
for your aledgemente. Then he alyghted of his horse / and fat him down on the
earth beside him / and drew out of his purse a box of gold full of precious
oyntementes / with ye which oyntement he anointed and touched all his wou^des
/ and gave him a rote for to ete. And incontyneute as he had tasted of it /
he was as hole and safe as ever he had been. Wherefore his medecyne clothed in
white did bydde him that he should thank god / by whom he was sent theder.
Arthur did so as he had commanded him / and gave louynges to god. Then the
white man made him for to mou^te upon his horse behind hy^ and said to him that
he should put him out of the forest And then in going he said to him. King of
Algarbe / I know well wherefore that thou art departed out of thy country. It
is for to leke Olyuer of Castylle thy fellow wherefore I shall tell you
tidings. Know that after his departing he arry^ed in the realm of England
/ whereas he has governed him so well that by his prowess he has won ye
only daughter of the king the which is one of the fairest ladies of the
world / but (...) fortuned to him / for a king of Irlande the which loved
him not / because he had slain his fader / has taken him prosoner / and
has put him in a dongeon / where as he suffers as much mysery as any man is
possible for to suffer. But have no doubt of his life. For he shall never deye
unto the time that thou have casten him out / and if that I had to counsayll
the / and y^ thou would believe me / I would counsayll the for to goo first to
London / for to comfort the king and his daughter. For thou know that thou
resemblest Olyuer / and that it is all one thing / wherefore Helayne shall
thyn^^ that thou art her lord / and shall guarysshe because of thy coming /
and truly if that thou haste the not thou shalt never se her / for she is
syke unto the death / go and lie with her to the end that they believe the
better that thou art Olyuer / but beware the well thou think not on vylanye /
nor dys^^onoure / for thou should offend to gretely. And after that thou see
her in y^ way of health depart the and come unto this forest / for thou
shalt here tidings of me here. In these deuyses he led him out of the wood
/ and made him descend / then Arthur set him on his knees / as before a holy
thing and than k^d him / but incontinent he lost the sight of him without
knowing where he became.

How Arthur by the counsayll of the white knight went toward the king of
England at London / And of the Joy that they made him thykynge that it had been Olyuer. Capitulo. lviij.
AS Arthur found him alone in his way / he thanked god / and did so much
that he came to the sea / where as he found a ship that went in to England /
and entered in to it / and when he was in England / the first town y^ he
entered in was Brystowe / where as he was known for Olyuer. And incontinent the
tytynges were spread all about. And some adressyd them unto London / and came
and told the king. The which when he knew it / he was so replenysshed with
Joy / and his heart so close with Joy / that he had letten himself fall
to y^ earth / if some of his servants had not sustained him but for all that
they must bear him to bed / where as he was a space of time without any
knowledge. Nevertheless he fell a sleep / and when he was awaked he demanded
of them of his chamber if it were true that Olyuer was alive / and if he did
come. They answered him ye / whereof he was right glad / and thanked god but
before he knew not whether that they had told it hy^ or if that he had dremed
it. Thus as they were in these deuyses came a squyre and knocked at the chamber
door that said that they should axe the king if he would see Olyuer / the
which would come shortly / for he was not more tha^ a mile of. The king
sent sone for his horses and mounted upon him / for to goo against him. In
like wise every body went in to the feldes / for to se him that was so much
desired. And when Arthur apperceyued the people that came against him / the
teres were in his eyes / and began for to bewail his fe^owe. And did so much
that he approached the king / and when y^ king apperceyued him that he had not
seen of three year before / him seems that it is none other but Olyuer and also
to all the other of his company / wherefore with both his arms abroad he ran
to him / and began for to embrace him so strongly that it was meruayl / but
he might not speak one word to him. And when that he might speak / he said
that he was right welcome / and that he had done great alms for to return
and comfort this realm^ that was so replenysshed with dolor because of his
departing. Arthur answered to him. My lord that the which has been done /
was done against my will / nor other thing I may not say / but by the
pleasure of god I shall ^yue more Joy and lyesse unto this realm because of
my retornynge / than ever there was sorrow for my departing. And am more redyer
for to do you service than ever I have been. Whereof I do thank god.

lay with her withouten vylanye. Capitulo. lviij.


AFter these deuyses Arthur salued the noble men that werein the ky^ges
company / and generally all the other / but there came so many / that it was
not possible for them for to enter in to ye cite. Wherefore it was force for
them for to bring a great and a hye chair of Cypres / upon the which Arthur
mounted / to the end that he were seen on every side / for to content the
people ye better. Then it was cried that every body should return / and after
Arthur mounted upon horsbacke. And when he entered in to London / none can not
deuyse to you the Joy that was made on every side / ye streets were hanged
ladies and damoyselles were at the wy^dowes / the noise was so great that it
was meruayll for to here. And in sign of more gretter Joy / both more and
less cried Te deum laudamus. And when they approached the palace Helayne that
was strongly syke / herd yt noise where as she lay / and demanded what it
was / but none durst not tether / for fere leest that the sudden Joy should
have been to great. Wherefore they abode the maystres that did tell a far what
it was. When she knew it where hands Joined up to heaven she began for to
than ke god in saying. O redempt our of humayne lygnage I render to the graces
and thanks / when that before my death I may se him that has put me in so
great doloure. Come now death when that thou will / for I shall abide the
Ioyously / sith that I know that my sovereign lord is comen / it can not
grieve me. The fair and good Helayne had great talent for to see him that she
wend had been her husband / but Arthur was in great thought how he might
demean him toward y^ wise of his fellow. For all that when his botes were of
/ he went toward Helayne for to know how she did / And when she saw him /
she was a great while or that she might speak. But when that she might speak /
she said that she did well sith that she saw him in good health. The our of
souper came / and therefore Arthur took leave of her / and prayed her that she
would make good chere / and that she would think for to make her hole The
ladies and damoyselles of the cite of London were somoued to souper / and there
was made a meruaylous Joy / but yet it should have be^ more gretter if it
had not ben for Helaynes maladye. And it was defended by the king that none
should work of viij. days but each ^nenst him made the feast as great as they
might. Arthur by the counsayll of the medecyns / was excused for to lie with
Helayne because of her maladye / whereof he was Joyous without making any
semblaunt / but with in short space she gate up and found guaryson and health
And so much that within a little time the physycyens gave him leave for to lie
with her / so as he did. And when he was in bed with her / he remeuyd not
out of his place / but the fair Helayne did not so / for she that of long
time had not had the embrasynge of her lord / began for to approach / but
Arthur drew back and said to her / my love withdraw you in to your place
again for I have made auowe that never by embracing / nor otherwise I shall
touch your body till that I have paid a pilgrimage that I have promised unto
saint James / wherefore I pray you that ye be content / and after I shall come
to you again / for as soon as I may I will pay it / and after by the grace of
god we shall make good chere. Helayne herynge Arthurs words did his
commandment In saying to him that it was well reason for to hold that which
he ha^ promised to god and to Saint James. Then she began for to deuyse a far
with him / in demanding him where as he had been / Arthur badde her that she
should not speak to him / for she might not know it / wherefore Helayne
deported her at that time.

IN such estate was Arthur well the space of a moan / he in the king of
Englandes court the which made him as good chere and honor. as he would
have done to Olyuer / thinking that it had been he / and also did Helayne /
and all the other. And when he saw that Helayne had ouercomen her maladye /
and that there was no more danger / he came toward ye king and said to him
that he did owe a vyage to Saint James / and that he must needs do it
withouten any company / wherefore he prayed him that he would be content that
he might go alone / and that he would return again as shortly as he might.
The king asked him if that he was weary of his wife already / and he answered
nay. After he took his leave of the king for to depart / and on the morowethe
king prayed him that he would not tarry / and also that he should take some
company with him / but Arthur would not do nothing / and so departed all aloue
after that he had taken his leave of the fair Helayne / and promised he^ that
he should return right shortly. He did so much that he arrived in the
forest where as he had fou^den the white knight. Nevertheless he durst not enter
/ for fere of the wild beestes / and therefore he abode the truth of his
knight there. And he was there so long that he apperceyued hy^ coming. Then
Arthur salued him / and he rendered to him his salute. Then he made him to
mount up behind him / and said to him. My friend Arthur have thou good will
for to have again thy fellow / dare thou put the in adventure for to recover
him. Truly laid Arthur there fs nothing but that I would do it for to recover
him. Now I shall tell y^ said y^ knight / thou art armed at all pyeces /
wherefore thou ought to be the more hardyer. I aduertyse the that the king that
holds Olyuer in prison / is a good mile from his place with a little company.
There is from hens theder.xxxiij. mile / and there is but three knights with
hy^ all a foot / but and I thought that thou durst fight with them all four
for to get again thy friend. I should led the theder in a little space.
Arthur thanked him / and prayed him that he would do so. The knight smote y^
horse with the sportes / and he had not so sone done it / but that in a moment
he was there as the king was. The^ he showed him to Arthur and said. Arthur
descend adowne for yonder is thyn enemy / and if that thou recover Olyuer /
tell him that the knight clothed in white does salve him / the which did
bring the heder.

Incontinent Arthur alyght / and took leave of y^ knight / the which vanysshed

incontinent he escryed him to the death / and then he set hand to his sword
and gave one of his knights such a stroke / that he cloue hy^ to the tethe.
The second he smote of his harm and his sholder. The third he kest down
deed. The king had but a short dager wherewith he defended him valyau^tlye /
but in the end he fled / and Arthur followed him and gave hy^ so great a
stroke with the platte of his sword that he smote him down astonyed / and
then he said to hy^ A falls traitor king / thou can not deny but that y^
have the king in thy prison / wherefore enforce the for to render him to me /
or else I make auowe to god I shall smite of thy heed. The king cried him
mercy and said / O noble knight save my life and I shall render him to the
again. Arthur promised hy^ that he would save his life / so that he would
send him to him incontynente / and that he would promise him to let them go
safe. The king promised him that he would do so. And then he departed all mate
/ and dyscomfyted / and he did so much that he came in to his castle. And
incontinent as he was there / he commanded that Olyuer should be drawn out.
When Olyuer was before him he said. King I pray the that thou slay me before
that I enter in agay^ in prison. The king said to him that it went not so /
for a knight has acquyted thy prison / and I promised him to send the to
him. Then he badde give him new clothes / so as it was done / and then he
gave him leave / but at the departing he said. Olyuer I se my death approach /
sith that I deliver the / and I have well deserved it. Nevertheless if prayer
may have place. I beseech the for to pardon me. Olyuer that was more sympler
than a maiden / said to him. My friend that that ye have done to me / has been
withouten cause / for all yt I promise you that as for me I shall never tell no
body of the Iniurye that ye have done to me / but and it be known by other /
and that some make you war / I will not help you. The king thanked him and
said that he would abide till than. They mounted both on one horse all alone
withouten other company. And went so much that they found Arthur. Olyuer
knew him sooner than Arthur did him. Wherefore he set foot on ground and
ran to him with stratched arms and embraced hy^. Who that had seen the
knowledge of these two faithful fellows / he should have had a hard heart if he
had not wept. They held each other embraced with out any speech. Olyuer
seeing his fellow that might not speak / he had his heart sofull of Joy and
pity that he might to nothy^ge but kiss him and colle him. On the other side
Arthur that saw ye fair face in which the ladies took their solace for to
behold it so pale with prysonynge where as he had been in / had not less
sorrow than Olyuer. For all that he was the first that spoke and said. My right
sweet lord and fellow / this Iourneye has been fore desired on my party. I
give louynges to god that I have found you. A white knight has brought me
hither / the which salueth you / and charged me to tell it you. Olyuer
answered him. Arthur my brother by your bou^te and loyalte ye have done so much
for me / that I can never render you to guerdon. I pray to god that he render
you the reward / for I am not suffycyent for to do it.

THis notwithstanding that they both should have done dyspleasure to the king
of Irla^de that was there present / for all that he s^ynge the knowledge and
love that they showed / demanded them if that they would that he should give
to each of them a good courser / but then they said nay / but and he would
give to them the horse that he rode on / he should do them a great pleasure /
and that it should suffyse at that time for them both. The king ^^yd that he
was content / and gave him them These tweyne mounted upon him / and Arthur
rode before / for he was a little wounded. And so they put them on the way /
and did so much that they arrived in England. But before that they were
there ye may well think that they had diverse words together / and each of
them demanded of others tidings. When they came in to England Olyuer shaued
his berde to be ye more gentyller But they would have none other horse / but
that same that they were comen on / and concluded to tell the truth of their
adventure / without declarynge the place of his prysoneme^t / and also without
gyuyng any knowledge of whens they were / nor whom. And they of England were
all abashed to se these two men upon one horse / and semblable. And said that
Olyuer had brought one of his brederne from saint James / but they could not
know which was Olyuer. Thus as ^e may here the two fellows approached within a
mile of London And so as they devised Olyuer demanded Arthur if ever he had been at London. And he said ye more than a monethe / by the counsayll of the
white knight* for to comfort the king / and the lords of the realm / and
also for to give health unto Helayne his wife / the which at that present
time was syke unto the death / and that he had made them for to believe that
he was Olyuer / Olyuer demanded him how that he had governed him toward
his wife. And Arthur said to him that he had layne with her. And wha^ Olyuer
these herd tidings / he put out of remembrance the service that his fellow
had done unto him / and as hastye and full of furour / he kest Arthur down
that was mounted before him / so rudely without more enquery^ge / that he brake
one of his legs in falling. Then he lepte in to the sadell and passed forth
on his way without^ ret^^^nynge him / or making semblau^t of any thing / and
when he was passed he wist not what he should do for to return and slay him.
But he thought with in himself that he should mysdo to gretely / seeing the
love that had been before time between them. And also y^ great service that he
had done for him / as to have taken him out of that place so full of myserye /
from which he should never have departed if he had not ben. Wherefore he
concluded y^ for all these seruyces he would leave him his life / but this was
not but that he thought that he had done his will with his wife / and gave
himself marvel how that in so noble a heart might lodge so much treason.

How Olyuer dem^aned great sorrow for the dyspleasure that he had done unto
Arthur his fellow without en cause. Capitulo. lxij.
OLyuer rode long in these thoughts. And when he came to the court / and
that the tidings came to the king / and to Helayne that Olyuer was comen
again / they were all abashed / for they knew well that in so short a space
as he had be^ out that he could not have been there. Nevertheless they were
right glad and Joyous. And the king made him great chere wha^ he saw him.
But with pain he ^oude know him because he was so lene / and demanded him
what sykenes he had sith his departing / and who had put him in such estate.
For as him semyd he saw never man so sore changed in so short space. And
Olyuer said to him that never sith his departing he had had health. Fair sone
said the King ye be comen in to this country for to help you. And then he
demanded him why he had not ben at saint James / as he had told them at his
departing. Olyuer saw well that his fellow had made them to believe at his
departing that he went to saint James / wherefore he said. My lord my malydye
has has let me / and if it please god / when that I am hole I may do it
better with mine ease / and with gretter company. when it came after souper / he
took the sonest leave of the king that he might / as he that had great will
for to lie with his wife the which was so ^^cellente / and that of long time
he had not seen her to whom he could none evil will of any thing that was
happened her / nor that his fellow had done. For he know well that she could
not do withal / and that ygnoraunce made her for to do it thinking that it
had been he. when he was a bed with his wife / he began for to colle her and
kiss her / whereof she was all abashed and said. My lord ye have forgeten the
promise that ye made to Saint James Olyuer demanded her what it was / and how
quod she / do ye not think on that ye have layne with me more than a monethe
withouten touching of me / and that of all that while I might not have of you
one only kiss / and ye told me that it might not be tell that your vyage were
done I have herd you say that ye have not ben there / and therefore I pray
you my dear lord if that ye have promised any thing to god / that ye will
hold it. Olyuer demanded her of every thing so ferforthe / that he
apperceyued the loyalte of his fellow wherefore tenderly weeping he withdrewe
him abacke from his wife / and of all that night he slepte not / but said to
himself that he was the most unhappy / that ever was borne of mother. And
that the euelles and trybulacyons that he had endured had not done him the
hondreth part of dyspleasure that he had at that present time And said that
and his fellow had any hurt / that he should never have Joy and that if he
were deed that he should ^lee himself / for had well deseruyd it.

How Olyuer departed from London and came to the place where as he had left
his fellow / and cried him mercy. Capitulo. lxiij.
REcydently he abode in that doloure and dystresse till it was day / and
inco^tynente as it was day ^he arose and made to sadell his horse upon y^ which
he mounted and did so much / that he arrived in y^ place where as he had
left Arthur / and when he found hy^ not he began for to search him on every
side / and as he went heder / and theder / he herd toward the wood a voice
that conplayned him right bytterly / wherefore he went thederwarde. And when he
approached nere there / he knew y^ it was his fellow / that with right great
pain had with drawn him out of the way under a tree. And when Olyuer saw
him he set foot on ground. And truly he had so great doloure that he might
not sustain hy^self And I think if that god had not helped him / that he had
fallen in dyspayre / and smyten himself thrughe y^ body with his sword that
he had drawn out. And the first word that he said to his fellow was such
in casting himself on his knees before him / with the naked sword in his
hand. Alas my brother behold this caytyfe in pity / the which has so
grievously offended the / wherefore take this sword and slew me / and with all
my heart I pardon the / for the surplus of my life shall be in dystresse and
sorrow. Arthur seeing his fellow so meke him toward him said. My right dear
brother / and loyal fellow I pray to god that the pardon you / and I do. And
think that it is a thing more possible for to deuyde all the things that god
has made / than to depart the love of us twain / till the death. When
Olyuer herd him speak so humbly / he would gladly have been deed. And could not
tell what to do save to weep perfou^dely beside him. Wherefore Arthur prayed him
for to look how that he might be had thens / for h^ su^^^ed / and had suffered
the night before so much dolor because of his hurt that it was meruayll. And
then Olyuer axed him if that he might abide so long / till that he had been
at a little vyllage nere them for to fetch a charette / Arthur said ye / and
prayed hy^ for to hye him Olyuer went and made such dylygence y^ within a
short space he brought one / upon the which he put him / and in this wise he
was brought to London sore syke / and Olyuer was in it also for to bear him
company. And made for to be given him a house / and servants. After that
this was done Olyuer made all the kings physycyens and surgyens for to come /
the which put Arthur in point. And they did so much that within short time
he went about the chamber. Olyuer that vysyted him of ten told to his wife
how ^uery thing went / and had been / and that by the space of a month
another man had layne with her / the which was all abashed / and swore to him
that in no manner of the world he had not touched her / not asmoche as to kiss
her. The king in like wise did demand of Olyuer what manner a man he was /
that he had brought in such wise theder. And Olyuer said unto him that it
was one of his good fellows / the which had been nourysshed with him sithe
his yo^ghthe. And then Olyuer began for to recou^te unto the king of
England / the great loyalte / and also love that he had to him / and in like
wise how y^ he had layne with his wife and the manner how that he had conduyted
him and after the pain / and travail that he had suffered for to put him out
of prison where as he was in And of the great valyau^^yses that he hade done
for that cause t^en he recounted the pyteous guerdon and reward that he had
given him wherefore he prayed the king that he would honor him as much or
more than him self. For he was more worthy it than he.



How Arthur after that he was heled passed over y^ s^e / and had vengeance on
the king that had kept Olyuer prisoner. Capitulo. lxiiij.
THe king was gretely abashed / and said y^ it was one of the meruaylous
hystoryes that ever he had herd / and said to Olyuer that he could never do
hy^ so much honor / but that he ought to do him more / and also if y^ he
loved him well / he should do nothing but that he ought to do. For never
brother had done for another that y^ he had done for him / wherefore he could not
to much deserve it. And that as touching his part he would do him as much
honor as should be possible to him / and sent for his chamberlayne / and his
master steward / and other governors / and commanded them that such and
semblable estate as his sone Olyuer had / should be given to Arthur. And began
for to tell them all alonge that y^ which Olyuer had rehearsed to him /
reserved that he made no mencyon how that Arthur had layne with his daughter
/ y^ which was not a thing for to recounte / for it was a desloyalte / but
the king kept him well from telling of it / because that there was / and is
many folk / y^ paraue^ture would sooner have thought evil than good /
wherefore he deported him. After the kings commandment all things were
ordained as he had devised. And diverse knights and squyres were reteyne^d of
Arthurs household / the which began for to get up / and the king vysyted him
right often. Also did the fair Helayne / that made no semblaunte of nothing.
And so much passed on these things that Arthur was heled. And when it came
y^ he might walk about in the court / and have acquayntaunce with the noble
men that remained therein / every body began for to love him / because of the
humblenes that he was replete with. And the king himself loved him almoost as
moch^ as Olyuer his sone in law. And wha^ he saw that he was in the grace of
every body / he forgate not y^ wrong that the king of Irlande had done to
his fellow / wherefore he demanded him on a day if that he had any will for
to avenge him. And Olyuer said nay / and said that he had perdo^ned him. And
how quod Arthur have ye so feeble a courage that ye dare not avenge you on your
enemy / by the faith that I owe to god / it shall not abide so. And then all
evil content he came toward the king / and told him all alonge in what
prison Olyuer had been in / and prayed him y^ he would give him men for to
avenge Olyuer / for he knew well that Olyuer had no talente for to do it.
When y^ the king herd Arthur speak so / he took it more grievously at his heart
than Arthur did / wherefore he said to him. My fair friend let my sone have
his will / for it may be that he has made some promesses before that he issued
out of prison. Ye be well the man for to avenge him without any more that he
meddle him thereof. And then the king raised up a great army of y^ which
Arthur was the chyef Capytayne / the which were not so sone arrived in
Irlande but that the King their enemy the which had knowledge of their
coming / gave them battle / where as was slain diverse men upon both sides /
but finally the Irysshmen were dyscomfyted / and the king fled / and was
assyeged in one of his places / that was not well garnysshed with vytaylles /
wherefore it might not hold long. So when he saw y^ he had no more mete /
and that it was force for to yield him / as a valiant man he said that he had
lever deye in the field in auengynge his death with the cuttynge of his sword
on his enemies / than for to yield (...) their volente / and prayed the little
folk that he had for to do well / and then armed them and made to open the
gates of th fortress in smiting on their enemies / and slew many at the
first bronte / but there was so many men against them that they could not
escape. And fynably the king and all his men were slain. After his death all
his realm yielded them / and were content for to have such a lord as the
king of England would assygne them.

How Arthur fell in a great maladye / and of the dyspleasure that Olyuer had.
Capitulo. lxv.
THese things done Arthur and his company returned in to England / where as
they were fested of the king / of Olyuer / and of all y^ other lords. And the
king gave Arthur the realm of Irlande that he had ^onquered of new. And the
Irysshemen were sent for / the which came and did him homage and feate /
whereby Arthur was more puyssaunt tha^ before / but this was not but that he
demanded often of Olyuer what thing did meue him y^ he made hy^ not to be
known / for then every man would have made him better chere / and the king
would have been right Joyous / for to have married his daughter so hyghlye.
Notwithstanding that it suffysed hy^ Also he told him how that after his
departing his fader had never Joy / and thought that anger had put him to
death / wherefore Olyuer wept right strongely for the death of his fader / for
him seemed if that he were deed / that it was for his sake / and prayed him that
he would not as ye tell what he was / for it was yet time ynoug^^ for to make
them to be known / and that when that it should please them they might do it.
Arthur that would all that his fellow would / did not dysobeye him in
nothing Also Olyuer made to bear more honor unto him than to himself / and
pleased him the most that he might. Truly the two loyal fellows made so many
now things that all they of the realm reioysed them Al their thoughts was
but for to make good chere and Joyous and that the which the one would the
other would also / and their two hertes were more agreynge tha^ their
semblaunce / that was all one thing Thus as ye here they passed the time in
Joy / but forture that is mother of all ^rybnlacyon had envy of the goodness of
these two loyal brederen and perfyte fellows / for in a short time all their
laughynges and Joys were changed in to wepynges and lamentacyons / for Arthur
was so grievously syke that the physycyens iuged him but deed but he was not so
happy for to deye / at every time that he wysshed it. His sekenes was without
comparyson of all them that ever had been seen / for in a manner of worms
descended from his brains / the which ete all his face / whereby he was so
strongely dysfygured / that there was never man more. Out of his body issued so
great a stynke / that none might approach him save Olyuer / y^ at every thing
was about him / and would not depart fro him. He sent for all y^ maystres
surgyens on every side / and prayed them if that they could find any remedy
for his fair brother that they should spare for nothing. And fynably none
could put no remedy to it / And this sykenes he^de Arthur so long that he was
bly^de. When Olyuer saw him so blind that he seemed better deed than alive /
he maid right great sorrow / so much that every body had pity on him. Often
Olyuer said unto Arthur / my brother if there be any thing that ye know that I
may do for to help you / spare it not for upon my faith I would be the poorest
man in the world / so that ye had your health.

Of the dreme and vysyon that Olyuer had by four (...) and in likewise it seemed
to Arthur that his health was in the power of Olyuer his fellow / and y^ he
must do it for to hele him. Capitulo. lxvj.
MY brother and faithful fellow said Arthur ye do me more good than I have
deserved wherefore I thank you / and pray you that ye will pray to god for to
send death to me for and it were his will I would feign be out of this
myserye. It happened that Olyuer slepte upon a night / and dremed that it was
well possible to find health for his fellow. And Arthur dremed in like wise
that it was in Olyuers power for to hele him / and they had this vysyon four
days together / whereof Olyuer was ^ore ameruayled. He came to se his fellow and
declared to hy^ his dreme / and his fellow said that dremes were but abusyon /
notwithstanding he told him that by three days he had dremed / and him
thought y^ a thing said to him that he might hele him / and none other.
Olyuer said to him would to god that it were in my power for to hele you / for
and I might do it / ye should be shortly hole / or else I pray to god that he
never give me his paradyse. Wha^ it came to the night and y^ Olyuer went to
bed / he set him on his knees before his bed prayng our lord yt he would
give him knowledge of that vysyon / that so often times had happened him. And
with this that he would tell him in what manner that he might hele his fellow.
Then he laid him down / and he was not so sone a sleep but that a voice said
to him so high that he awaked. Olyuer thy fellow may not be heled till that he
drink of the bloo^^ of two Innoce^tes / sone and daughter / the which must be
slain / and their blood meddled together / and then give it him to drink /
but he must not know of it wha^ he shall drink it / for and he knew it he
would not drink it for nothing. When Olyuer herd this he was al abashed and
thought for to have resoned him ferder forth / but the king was gone and said
no more. Helayne had herd nothing of all this. Upon the morrow he went to se
his fellow as he was accustomed / and axed him how he had done that night.
Arthur knew him by his voice / for he had lost his sight / and prayed hy^ for
to approach to him. And when he felt him he enbraced him sayng My right sweet
brother ye be my death and my life / for a voice has told me this night that
it is possible for you to hele me / nor other thing could I not know. Olyuer
said to him what he would well that it were so / and then he departed fro thens
/ and after that he had herd mass / he withdrewe him aparte in to alytel
chamber / and began for to think on that which he had herd on the night
before / then he set him on his knees before an image of the glorious vyrgyn
Marye / the which he had of custom for to salve / and began for to say thus
/ Right glorious vyrgyn Marye I pray the that by thy pity thou will counsayll
this unhappy. I have my fellow syke the which has done so much for me that
I can never deserve it. It has been said to me whether it is by god or not /
that who should sle two children a sone and daughter / and that their blood
were meddled to gyder / and that it were given him to drink / that he
sholdehele. Right sweet lady I have two children / a sone and a daughter of
kings blood. Nevertheless if that I knew that I should not offend the
highness of thy sone and the / I should slay my two children / for to render
to my brother his health.

How Olyuer for to give health and guaryson to his fellow / slew his two
children for to have the blood that Arthur might drink it. Capitulo. lxvij.


WHa^ Olyuer had made thus his co^playnte to y^ vyrgyn Marye / and that he had
had diverse ymagynacyons / as well of the love yt he had to his children / as y^
which he had to his fellow / he concluded for to slay his two children for the
love of his fellow / saying ^he had nothing more dear than his fellow / and
that y^ love that he loved his two children with / was nothing for to compare
to that the which he loved his fellow with / Wherefore he departed fro his
chamber / and came in to that of his two children. And when he was entered he
commanded all the ladies for to avoid out / the which did his
commandment. And when he found himself alone he shytte the chamber door /
and bare a basyn / and a naked sword in his hand unto the bed of the two
children the which slepte / and were not yet risen / When he approached nere
the bed / he lift up the couerlette / and found them slepynge right
swetely. The little sone that was of y^ aege of.v. year awaked / and in
contynente as he saw Olyuer / nature taught him for to make him chere / and^
in smiling named him fader The daughter that was the younger never left
slepy^ge when the said Olyuer saw the^ / he considered which of them two he
should slay first / and because that the sone began for to speak to him / he
had so great pity in his heart that he recu^ed abacke / and for all the
word he would not have smyten them / and then he said to himself How many
nature fail so much for to suffer the fader for to slay his child. Nor how
may there be so much cruelte in a man for to co^sente to murdre. Alas y^
fair and good Helayne / what pyteous tidings shall come unto your eeres /
when that ye shall know y^ I have slain your children / what shall ye say.
Certainly your pyteous heart may not endure it. And with that that ye lose your
children / ye shall lose your husband also / for he dare not abide in this
realm for y^ fere of your fader that shall put him to death / for he is well
worthy. And certes the (...) beestes has more reason than I have / unto whom
nature does teache for to keep their fruit to the death / and truly I ought
for to resemble unto them I ought to put me in peril of death for to save my
children / but thus it shall not go. And in saying this he approached to the
bed / and yet lift up the couerlet again / and drew him by the arm and
said. Unhappy children / ye ought well for to curse your fader / and his life
when he has engendered you and put you in this world from which ye must
depart. Thus saying full dolorously with the teres descendynge a long his
face / and the sword in his hand ready for to smite / nature and reason put
before him that it should be to great dommage / and cruelte. And lyberalyte said
to the contrary / that for to render health to his fellow he could not do to
much / y^ which he byleued / and in putting all feres behind / with one
stroke he smote of both their hedes / and then he put the basyn underneath /
and received as meche blood as he might have / and then he laid them in
their bed again / and the hedes in their places so as they had been alive.
He took a mau^tell with the which he covered it / and so bare it / in lockynge
the door after him and took the keye with him / to the end that non^ should
enter to know what was done.

How Olyuer in a basyn of silver brought the blood of his two children to his
fellow / and made him to drink it / and was all heled. Capitulo. lxviij.


OLyuer all alone holding the basyn in his hands came in to y^ chamber of his
fellow and made to avoid all them that were there / and then after he took a
little pot ^ull of the blood that was yet all hot / and gave it to his fellow
Arthur for to drink / that knew nothing what it was. And the hystorye makes
mencyon that as soon as he had tasted of it all the vermyne of his heed fell
of. And with this he keste out all the vapors of his body / in such wise
that he felt himself of all points heled / save the flesh that was eten of
his vysage was not so sone comen again. But Olyuer by three or four times
washed it / and gave him the surplus for to dry^ke so much that he had again
his sight and his health And when Arthur felt himself heled / he kneled down
for the kiss the feet of his fellow. And Olyuer that was glad of the
guaryson and health of his fellow said to him. My friend give thankynges to god
/ and after to my children the which I have slain for thy health / And to the
end that thou believe it the better to there y^ basyn that is yet all blody of
their blood. Arthur hery^ge and seeing this meruayll / had so great
abhomynacyon / and was so meuyd at his heart / that with pain it can be
specyfyed / and said to him. Ha ha Olyuer how may there rest so great cruelte
and tyranny in a man's heart as in thyn / that has slain thy two children
for me that am a strange man / and nothing of thy kynne Truly I would be deed
/ so that it had not happened so to the. Olyuer said to him my friend I was
their fader / and seeing that I have put them to death / thou art nothy^ge
culpable / for it was not at thy request / wherefore hold the content. But my
right loyal fellow there is another thing / for it is needful that the
departy^ge of us twain be made. Wherefore I recommende my wife unto the / and
pray the that thou will comfort and help her. For I know well that she
shall have great need of help when she shall know that the which is
happened. All the gold of the world should not keep me if the king knew it.
Wherefore it is force for me for to depart / and go in to such a place where
never tidings shall be herd of me / and where as I may serve god al y^
remenaunt of my life for to purge my vices and sins whiles that Olyuer spoke
to his fellow / the lady that had the keeping of the two children had be^ at
Helayne and complained her strongely of that / that she knew not in what
estate the children were / and excused her saying that and there came any evil
to them / that it was by the said Olyuer.

Of the great miracle that god did to Olyuer for his loyalte / in reysyng his
two children to life that he had slain. Capitulo. lxix.
OLyuer thought that it should be a thing in humayne for to se his two
children by heded / wherefore he went in to the chamber where as they were /
for to have put them in a place where never tidings should have been herd of
them. And this would he do before his departing. Wha^ he had lift up to the
couerlet / he opened the wyndowe that was shytte for to se them more plainly /
and then he came toward his children with y^ teres in his eyes / and in
casting his regard on them / he apperceyued that they had life / and played
both together. When Olyuer saw this miracle / for pure Joy he fell in a
swowne to the earth. And wha^ he was arysen he enbraced and kyssed them a.M.
times / and then he said. O innumerable puyssaunce of god that no man can
comprehend I render unto the praysynges and thanks / of the goodness that thou
have done to me poor sinner / in showing thy great pity and mercy. He took
his two children in his arms and lapped them in a clothe all blody. And the
first that he encountered was his fellow. Arthur to whom he said. Brother
rejoice the / goo and se the king / and do so much that he follow me to the
church that I go to. In like wise my wife and all them of the court that ye
may find. Then Olyuer passed forth^ all alone thrughe the streets / and he
did so much that he came to the cathedral church of Poules where as he
commanded that all the belles should be rongen / to the end that all manner
of folk should come theder. He mounted on hye for to be herd of every body
And then he began for to say when he saw that the king was comen / and that
the church was full of folk. Right puyssaunt king of England thou have
married thy daughter to a man unknown / for ye know that I never reherced to
you of my lygnage / notwithstanding think that my condycyons be not so hye and
so virtuous as they ought to be / and that apperteynethe to my lygnage / the
which is ryall / for I am sone of a king and of a queen / and at this
present time king of Castyll. But never syfh the decesse of my fader / and
that the realm is fallen to me I have not be^ there But my will is now for to
getheder / and make me to be crowned king and my wife queen. Wherefore I
beseech you noble king that ye will accompany me and your daughter theder /
for it is reason that I return better acco^panyed than I came forth.
Notwithstanding that I had taken leave of the right puyssaunce King of
Algarbe / my faithful fellow that is there. I left him a lettre by the which
I prayed him that if he saw the water of a glass that I had left him change
his color / that he should put him in quest after me / for I should than have
need of help. He forgate it not / for he looked so much that he saw it
change / and it was at the hour that I was taken in Irlande. When he
apperceyued it / he that is a king redoubted / and regente of Castyll in
abiding of my return / has habandonned lands and possessions / and all
other things for my love / and all alone without any company put him on the
way / and made auowe to god that he should never rest till that he had herd
tidings of me.

How Olyuer before the king of England and the other barons of the realm /
told his ad^entures and meruaylous fortunes. Capitulo. lxx.
AFter Olyuer began for to recou^te all the adventures of Arthur / as well of
them of the forest / as of y^ other / and how that he had foughten with the
king of Irlande / and four of his knights that held him in prison / and did
so much by force of arms that he did vaynquysshe him / and slew his men.
And after said in this manner contyne wynge by conclusyon. By the moyen of my
brother and loyal fellow Arthur I am delivered from the place where as I should
never have issued out. And in guerdon of all these things I broke one of his
legs. Now it is happened after all these things that he has had a
meruaylous sykenes / not four hours ago. And so as I desired some thing y^
might hele him. It happened me to have a vysyon / and was told to me yt who
that would give him a drink of the blood of two Innocents / sone and daughter
meddled together / that he should have health. So it is happened for to get hy^
health yt with this sword I have slain my propre children / and byheded them
for to render to him his health / the which he has / wherefore I give
thankynges unto our savior. And after that I saw him heled I thought for to
have departed from this realm. But yet I came in to her chamber for to se my
children that I had slain / the which by the will of our lord that has
extended his grace / and pyteous mercy on me poor sinner / has found them
alive / and playnge the one with the other Wherefore faders and moders that
has children / think in what doloure I was in wha^ I put them to death And
what Joy that I have herd when I se the^ reuyued. Then he took his two
children and before all the people showed them alive / lapped in the clothe that
was all bebledde of their blood. Wherefore all they that were the represent /
were mouyd with inwardly pity / that with wepynges and lame^tacyons they made a
great bruyte The king wept for great Joy and pity. The poor Helayne that
saw her children so / might not supporte herself but fell in a swowne. And
when she was comente herself / she came to her children in showing to the^
moderly love / and she could not be fulfilled with kissing / and pyteous
remuneracyon. Bryefely it was a pyteous thing for to be in that church / for
some wept for Joy and the other for pity. And when the sorrow was a little
aswaged the king al weeping came and enbraced Olyuer saying. Noble king
blessed be our lord when he has given me the puyssau^ce for to mary my
daughter so nobly / as to a king that is extracte of so noble a lygnage. Ye
recou^te unto us y^ most meruaylous tale that ever was herd in any country.
And ye may well ymagyne that they that shall here it after us shall say thus
for for evermore the compaynye of you and of your brother as long as the world
shall endure ought to be recounted for the not semblable that ever was herd or
that shall be.

How Olyuer sent Arthur in to Castyll / for to notyfye his coming. And how
the king of England accompanied Olyuer in to Castylle. Capitulo. lxxi.


THe miracle was publysshed thrughe the real me of England. And after all
these things they began for to make Joyous feestes in welcomynge the king
of Castylle that was than known. And every body said that the king was happy
for to have married his daughter so And said that it was meruayll that he had
kept him (...) long close. The king of England sent for the lords and
ladies of his country. And held one of the gretest feestes that ever he had
made. Olyuer prayed them all that they would accompanye him in to Castylle to
be at his coronacyon. And they accorded him all / and the king himself said
that he would go with him / and Olyuer thanked him. And after prayed the king
of Algarbe his fellow that he would do so much as to goo in to Castylle for
to denounce his coming. Arthur said that he would do it gladly. He departed
from England well accompanied / and did so much that they arrived in
Castylle / where as he told the coming of the king / and of his wife the
king of Englandes daughter. When y^ tidings were denounced that, he was come^
/ and that Olyuer came after / every body thanked god / and apparaylled them
for to receive him in the most honourablest wise that they might. They of the
realm assembled them / and by counsayll ordained for to make feast* from the
first town of the realm where as he should enter / unto the last that he
should pass by. And all at y^ expense of the realm. When Olyuer thought that
his fellow might be well in Castyll / he made that the king was content to
depart. And departed from London the fairest / and the most noble company /
and the best in point that ever was seen upon a day. Helayne was accompanied
of ladies and damoyselles in such wise that it was great pleasure for to
behold them of their Iourneys I can not deuyse to you / but they did so
much that they arrived in Spain / where as they were feested of all the great
lords that they passed by. And when they approached nere Castylle. Arthur and
all the great lords came against them. And welcomed them right gracyouslye /
and Ioyously in thanking god of their coming. Then they made reverence to
their lord / and to their new queen also. The which seemed them the fairest
lady that ever they had seen. Also they salued the king of England in
offrynge them to his service / And when they were entered in to the first town
of the realm / the streets were hanged / and pagentes upon scaffoldes / and
there was so many other plays that they wist not y^ which they might
behold. The ladies were in the wyndowes so rychely clothed that it was
meruayll. And when it came that they entered in to the princes place / all that
they had seen before was nothing to that y^ which they saw there. They were
so well served at souper that it was m^ruayle. And fynablye in all the towns
that they passed by they found new things and always better and better. From
the beginning of the realm all the company were at the good Olyuers
expenses. In that estate they came unto the cite of Vaudolytys / where as they
found the old queen of Castyll Olyuers stepmoder / and Arthurs own mother /
the which at the request of her sone Arthur / was come^ out of the realm and
country of Algarbe for to say unto the fair Helayne that was new queen /
that she was welcome / and to Olyuer semblably. Also in that same Cite was the
most ryalte as in the pryncypall cite. And when it came that they were
descended at the palace / y^ queen Arthurs mother came against them strongely
accompanied with ^adyes and damoyselles / and welcomed the new queen / and
also y^ king of England her fader. And on y^ morrow Olyuer was crowned / and
he layne also And at the dinner the king of England / the king of Casty^^^ /
the king of Algarbe / and the two other queen's were set at one table / and
all.v. were crowned.

Here it deuyseth how the king and y^ other lords and ladies did depart.
And how y^ white knight appeared to Olyuer / and oppressed hy^ for to hold his
promise / which was for to give him y^ half of his winning because of the
torneyment. Ca. lxxij.


AFter these things and that the king of England had been there by the
space of two months / he demanded Olyuer if that he would not return in to
England / and he answered him nay. And said that he was more at his ease in
his realm that had be^ so long without a king / than for to return in to
England. Then the king concluded to depart / and Olyuer conveyed him out of
his realm. And when it came that they should take leave the king of England
said to him. My sone and my friend Olyuer I reco^maunde unto you my daughter
your wife / and I pray you if that I have need that ye will forgete not me. And
Olyuer said to hy^naye / and that as often and as many times as he should have
to do with him that he should find him ready. And so they took leave / and the
king of England went toward England / and the king of Castylle returned /
in to his country / where as he found his brother Arthur king of Algarbe / y^
which would return in to his country / and led again his mother that took
leave of the king without making any mencyon of any thing y^ had happened
before. And when he found himself alone / and was delivered of all strange
men / he vysyted his realm / and made his ordynaunces so fair and so good
that every body was content. He with held diverse lords of the realm of
Castylle of his court / with some of England that were abyden with him. And
as he had been there a while he was known of all the noble men / that loved him
as their life. They were all reioysed of the two fair children that they had /
the which did encr^ase in aege / in condycyons / and in beauty that it was
meruayll. And when it came to the knowledge of them of the country of the fair
miracle that had happened / all the world was abashed how he had / had the
courage for to ^lee them / for they knew well as to there guard of the miracle
that the puyssau^ce of god is so great that none can comprehended it. Thus as
ye here the king of Castylle lived in Joy with his fair and good spou^e /
resours of all his sykenesses and adue^tures / and aledgynge of all his
dolours. Every body loved and dreded him so much that never king of Castylle
was so obeyed of his subgectes. It happened on a somer da^e about four a
cloak that the day was fair and clear / and as the king of Castylle slepte
with his wife / a thing came and knocked at the chamber door so meruayllous
strokes that it had almoost broken the door. The king awaked and demanded
what it was. That same thing answered open the door and thou shalt se / or
else I shall break it. When the king herd him speak so he put on his sherte
/ and took his naked sword in his hand and came and opened the door. It was
not so soon open but that he knew that it was his knight / that at his need
had always socoured and served him. And yet he was clothed in the white gown
that he had at the hour that he departed fro him. When the king saw him he
took him in his arms and said. My friend ye be welcome. And he answered /
welcome or ill come / yet am I comen / and not for to tell you any thing that
is pleasant. The king said that he could say nothing that should dysplease
him / for he had good remembrance of the promise that he had made to him /
and was ready for to hold it.

Here it makes mencyon of the said white knight And of the great dolor that
Olyuer and his wife demeaned for their children / of which the white knight
took the sone for his part / and of other mysteryes of the queen. Capitulo.
lxxiiij.


THey entered both in to y^ chamber where as they found Helayne a bed / that
was all a basshed wha^ she saw the knight clothed in white enter in to the
chamber. The king badde her arise / so as she did / and when Oly. she was
ready / the knight prayed the king that he would keep his promise / and that
he would keep his faith / The king Olyuer had then all the things ready and
apparaylled. For it was of long time purueyed in abiding the white knight /
and had departed all these things (...) wayne / and began for to say unto the
knight in this manner. My friend I shall begin at the Jewel les of my wife
without the clothing that has been estymed a mylyon of gold / lo there the
keye take the which that ye will / for all his departed in half / and my
treasoure in like wise ye shall chese the which half that ye will. After the
mouable goods of my house that I am served with / I think that ye have but
little to do with them / save the vessel. And that upon his faith he had
departed in two all that he had won and moore to / for the most part of
his treasour proceeded of the realm of Castylle / and that and he had ever any
thing of that of England / he should be lord of the Just half as he had
promised him. The knight said that he was not content and said to him. King
ye leye to me of that which ye say / for ye do not depart it so to me as ye
have promised. Have ye not wo^ne wife and children The king said ye. Then said
the knight I ought to have part. When the king understood him he set him on
his knees / and prayed him with Joined hands that he would leave him his
children / and that he would give him the half of his realm and with that y^
resydue of his treasoure. In like wise the poor Helyayne in great humylite
with the teres in her eyes prayed him y^ he would have pity on her / and on her
burden / and that he were content for to take that the which her husband
did ossre him / by such moye^ y^ the children should abide to them. The
knight said to him. Dame I will do nothing for you nor for none other. And if
that ye will not do it / it is well in my power for to make you recompense it
full derely. Then the king commanded the mother for to fetch her children /
the which she did and found them a bed and made them t^ary^ / and clothed
them / and then brought them. When the king saw them he demanded the knight
if that he would be content for his realm and his treasoure for to render to
him his children / if prayer might have any place. The knight said nay. Now
said y^ king sith that it gothe thus / chese which that ye love best. The
knight laid that he would have the sone / because that he knew that he loved
him best. The king all wepy^ge took his sone by the hand^ and gave him to the
knight saying / My sone and my child I recommaunde the in to the guard of our
lord / the pleasure of thy yongthe has little endured me. Who that than had
seen the poor Helayne take leave of her child / he should have had a hard
heart if that he had not wept / and Helayne wept haboundauntly saying. Child
ryall wherefore have I borne the when that I must be consentyng of thy
p^rdyccyon O right noble realms of England and of Castylle to day ye shall
lose your king and lord. After this the knight would have half of the fair
Helayne / the which thing Olyuer could not understand how it might be but if
that he should slay her / wherefore he committed the deed to the knight. And
then the knight answered unto him that he was no murderer of ladies / and
alsoo y^ it was no reason that he should pay him with his hand / for he knew
well that he must pay him hymsel^e y^ the which he had promised him / and
then said / if that thou hye the not it shall mysthynke us both. When Olyuer
saw that he might have none other thing / he came toward his wife and set
him on his knees in praynge her that she would pardon him her death. The good
helayne said that she would pardon him with good heart and then she embrased
him in saying. Right noble king the dyfference is great of the Joyous
acquayntaunce that we had first together / at the time that ye were called
Olyuer. Has right dolourous departy^ge that todaye shall be made of us two.
After that she had said these words / she made her orysons to god and to the
virgyn Mary / in cryenge mercy to god for all her sins / and that he would
put her soul in the glory of paradyse / and that if her lord had done any
sin for to slay her / that he would pardon him. And when she had ended her
prayers and said her orysons / she came toward her lord and husband / and
kyssed him with the teres descendynge from her eyes / and said that she was
ready for to abide the death. Wherefore she took leave of him / and of her two
children / and set her upon her knees with her hands joined toward heaven /
in recommaundynge her unto god. As she that abode but the stroke of death. When
the king saw her in that estate as a man half out of ^is wit approached
and in lyftynge up his sword would have ^louen her in two py^ces.

How the knight had pity on Olyuer having knowledge of his loyalte / and quyted
him all. And then he made him to be known him / and told hy^ what he was.
Capitulo. lxxiiij.
When y^ knight saw this pyteous adventure / he let not y^ sword auale a
down / for he withelde his arm and said / abide king that I may speak to
you / and to you queen / here me speak. Then the began for to say and demand
the king / if that he had no remembr^unce of a knight that was named sir Johan
Talbot the which was deed in his company in the sentence of cursynge. And if
that he remembered him not how that he paid the debt to the purgeys / and made
him to be buried. The king answered ye. And I tell the said the knight that I
am that same knight / and that same that served the at the torneyment of
England / and because that thou have done me pleasure / I render to the all
thy money / and all holy thy fynaunce that thou haste given me. And in
likewise I render to the thy sone / and quyte the in like wise the half of thy
wife / that which I have done has been for to assaye the and thy frau^chyle.
To the surplus I shall tell the wherefore at the first day of the torneyment I
clothed y^ in black / that was sygnefyaunce of y^ obscur^te that I was in. The
second day that was in read / sygnefyed my pains in purgatory. The last
day in white / sygnefyed my salvation / for so as y^ white is vyrgyn / for it
was never soylled by steynynge / whereby it is pure and clean. In like wise I am
so at this present time / for by the and by the cause / I am aledged of all my
doloure / and now I go in to the holy glory of paradyse / to se y^ presence of
my creatoure that is the reioysynge of the saved / wherefore I take leave of the
/ for there as I go thou may not come yet / but be thou sure that I shall
pray for the. Then he vanysshed away / and in their presence he mounted in to
heaven gloryously in casting the beams of his clerenes upon the wyndowe that
the king and the queen lened upon The which in a little while was out of
their syghte. Then they fette them upon their knees in rendrynge graces to
their creator / and after that they had made they^^ryso^s in tha^kynge god /
they began for to make the one to the other right pyteous acquayntaunce / so
much and by such manner as if the queen had been arysen from death at that
s^ame hour. The king of Castyll that never had received one goodness / but that
he had received ten euylles against it / lived in Joy with his right
well-beloved wife / and had never dyspleasure after that / ^aue all Joys unto
the hour of his death. Helayne was strongely seek for the fere that she had
had d^rynge the which maladye Arthur came in to Castyll for to se Olyuer /
to whom Olyuer made right great chere / and sone after that Helayne gate up /
the which was cause of more gretter Joy / and all Joy and myrthe was in the
realm of Castylle / there was no speaking of nothing save to make good chere.
The sone and y^ daughter of the king were already great / in so much that y^
daughter was ready for to be married. Wherefore the king said upon a day to the
king of Algarbe / my brother I have but one fellow in all the world / and that
is you For ye may well auaunte you that ye be parsonere of the goods that god
has given me. And therefore as unto my brother I will tell unto you mine advise.
Fynably ye be to mary and as yet has no wife / wherefore I am gretely
ameruaylled that ye have abyde^ so long. I have two children a sone and a
daughter / and by my faith if that I thought that ye were content for to mary
you / I would give you my daughter in marriage / and thereto reloke and my
daughter does please you / and if that ye think that she is for you. I give
her to you. Or if that it seems you better else where take it. Ye may say
he repryuely your will / for y^ love that I have to you makes me for to say
thus to you.

How Olyuer of Castylle gave his daughter in marriage to his fellow Arthur of
Algarbe / and of the death of Olyuer and of Helayne his wife. Ca. lxxv.


ANd when that Arthur King of Algarbe herd, the king of Castylle speak so
humbly he thanked him in saying y^ he did to him more honor than apperteyned
to hy^ / and sith that it was his pleasure for to give hy^ his do^ghter / that
he should be right ungracious for to refuse her. When the king of Castylle
understood that his fellow had great will for to atteyne to this marriage / he
sent incontinent after all the noble me^ of his country. And when they were
all assembled he made y^ spousaylles of Arthur and his daughter so great and so
plenteous of all goods / that it could be no more. And this feast endured a
long time. In the which while tidings came in to Castylle that the king of
Chyppres was assyeged of the infydeles / and required the king of castylle of
help and socoure / and also all the other christian princes. When this tidings
came to the knowledge of the young prince the kings sone / he made a request
to his fader that he would give hy^ leave and aid for to goo to the which he
accorded / and gave him a great army but he returned never after again / as
treats more at long the chronicles of Castylle. For after that he had
delivered the realm of Chyppres of their enemies / he went in to Turkey where
as he conquered diverse realms that he made for to be Crystenned. And if that
he had not deyed young / he had been a man for to have conquered the most part
of the world. The king of Algarbe led his wife in to his country. And three
year after his departing / a right grievous maladye took y^ King of Castylle
by the will of our lord that of these things dysposeth at his pleasure / and
was so syke that Helayne his wife / as she that abode not but his death sent
for the king of Algarbe / the which was not so sone arrived / but that the
king of Castyll passed out of this world in great wepynges and lamentacyons
of all his subgectes and friends / and generally of his me^ and all them that
knew him. And when the tidings were pronounced to Helayne / maulgre all them
that k^^te her she came to se her lord that was deed / and when she was entered
in to the chamber and that she approached the body / she escryed on hye. A right
puyssaunt king how I se thy fair face pale / by the death anguysshous / and
thy furyous arms affebled / and in saying this she let her self fall upon
the body / and she arose never after / for of doloure her heart did break and
deyed. Whereby the doloure was redoubled. The poor king of Algarbe demeaned so
great dole that it was pity for to se. And made innumerable lamc^tacyons so
much that it should be to long to recounte it. In like wise the queen of
Algar became for to see her fader and her mother that were deed / and she made
so great dole that with great pain she might be comforted. Both the deed
bodies were buried in one tomb / the which was right pyteous to behold.

How Olyuers sone deyed in turkey / and how Arthur was king of England and of
Castylle. Ca. lxxvii.
SOne after that the great dole had be^ in Castylle / Olyuers sone that at y^
time was their king was enprysonned by some ^^rasyns in y^ marches of Turkey /
but that was not but that a^ore his prysonynge he had be^ crowned of three
realms that he had conquered / and by cause that there was no moo
apperteynynge heirs in castyll than y^ queen of Algarbe Arthurs wife / they
made her queen / and crowned her husband king of the country / in doing to
him faith and homage. Alytell while after came tidings to the king of
Castylle and of Algarbe / that the King of England grandfader of his wife was
decessed. And that the Duke of Glocestre that was cousyn germayne to the King
of England / had made him to be crowned king of the realm. Wherefore he sent
in to England for to know and it were by the consent of the noble men of the
country And for to know if that he should not be received for king as reason
would. It was answered to him nay^ / wherefore he assembled a great company of
folk / and with great puyssaunce came and descended in England / and did so
much by force of arms / after diverse great bataylles / that he that said him
king was taken and put in prison / where as he never issued out after. After
he made him to be crowned king as reason would / and y^ Englysshemen received
him for their lord / and so he was king of England / of Castylle / and of
Algarbe / and also he was king of one of ye realms of Irlande. The surplus of
his days he lived in great prosperyte and encreasynge of all goods. He had
three children of his wife two sons and one daughter / that after his decesse
they held his lordshyppes. The eldest was king of England and of Irlande /
and the other king of Castylle / and his daughter was married to the king of
Portyngale / and he had with her the realm of Algarbe / that yet apperteyneth
to him. The two sons governed well and wisely their realms. And were
redoubted / and full dear holden of their subgectes and neighbors. After / the
death of the King their fader / and of the queen their mother. The surplus of
their days they lived holyly in serving god and the glorious vyrgyn Marye.
Then they passed out of this world right gloryously / god for his holy grace
have mercy on their souls. And gy^e good life and long / and encreasynge of
all goodness unto all them that this hystorye shall read or here read / and
that writes it or makes it to be written / and also to all them that shall se
it. Ame^.

The epylogacyon of the book. The last Ca.
ARystotle the phylosophre says that the things y^ be separed be vndersto^den
and known more dystynctely / for y^ which cause the table has been made and
put in the begynny^ge of this present book for to understand it y^ better.
And because that it should seem to diverse y^ some passyues of thystorye by
symplytude of impossylyte ought not to be byleued for a truth / for the
meruayll y^ is said. To the declaracyon of the passages of thystorye by manner
of epylogacyon this last chapter is c^mprysed. And to the regard of Olyuer
and Arthur that were so like / the dyffyculte is not to great / for when y^ two
children be of one aege / and of one felt complexc^on having some symylytude
of vysage / and corsage / facylly one may be taken for another / namely bycau^e
they be nourysshed together / speaking all one langage clothed in se^blable
clothes / instruct under one master / holding and keeping all one manner of
doing and countenance / all this rogyder / and diverse other things make the
them be said semblable.

To the regard of the queen that was esprysed of the love of Olyuer / it was
but fragylyte natural of women that follows sensualyte against honor.

Touching y^ water of the glass that ought to ^roub^e at Olyuers danger / by
this ye must not understand that it was water elementall in his nature / but
because that Olyuer was all virtuous / and that his under standing was all
given to good / and to love god / persevering in good and virtuous operacyo^s
/ and fleing all vices and sins / god permysed that Arthur had knowledge of
y^ aduersytees happened to Olyuer his fellow by the chaungynge of the water of
the said glass^ / by the prayer of his fellow Olyuer made unto god / eue^ so as
he had written in the lettre / and all this to the end that of them were
memory afterward / for to know the puyssaunce of god / and the meruayles
that on them he would show / as on his friends and good christian men / and ^or
to give example unto the other.

Almoche as it touches of the fortunes happened unto Olyuer and Arthur / as
well on the sea as on the land it is but a thing natural / and of semblable
happens often by the dysposycyon of the weder / but that when y^ they were
presetued from death / that was y^ will of god / and things myraculous that
were showed on them.

To the regard of the white knight that appeared so to Olyuer / and gave him
comfort and aid in his needs / god had sent him in rewardy^ge him in this
world of y^ great goodness and works of myserycorde that he had
accomplysshed in procuring the absolucyon of that same knight that was holden
for accursed.

Where as it touches that Olyuer was taken by one of the kings of Irlande /
and retained prisoner / and after delivered out of prison by Arthur / god
caused all this / to the end that the king of Irlande that unjustly and
without cause was enemy of his her^^ and traitor / for already by just war
he had made to him homage / and to the king of England / the which put hy^
in his realm again / abode not unpunished in this same world of his evil
and traytourous will / to the end that all traitors take ensample by him /
and keep them from falsynge of their oath.

To the regard that Arthur could not be heled but if he drank of the blood of
two Innocents / sone and daughter / god had done it and given it to
understand by reuelacyon for to preue y^ loyalte and true love of these two
fellows / as we read of Abraham that was content for to make sacrefyce of his
soue Ysaac unto god / in like wise Olyuer was sooner co^tente to hele his fellow
by sleynge of his children / than for to se him deye / and it may be that his
children were deed / and after reuyued / or else that god covered the murdre
and seemed to Olyuer that they were deed / so as it seemed to the Jews that
Moses had horns / yet had he none.

And asmoche as it touches that Olyuer was conte^te for to slay his wife the
queen for to keep his promise unto the white knight Sir Johan Talbot / to
whom he had promised the half of his winning at the torneyment / he was so
grounded and resolved in loyalte y^ of his promise he could not nor durst not
excuse him. As we have of king Herod y^ loved of saint Ioha^ baptyst / but
yet he would keep his promise to his daughter and make him to be byheded / than
to fail and break y^ faith of his oath. And because that to god is nothing
impossyble / he has done for our doctrine diverse miracles that been worthy of
memory perpetual / as y^ hystorye specyfyeth here before / made to ye
praysynge of god and of his glorious mother / and to the honor of the noble me^
/ and to the felycyte of all loyal and true lovers. to the example of
pacyentes / to the hope of the cheualrous / and to the ferrylyte and occupacyon
of the time salutarye. Amen.

Here ends ye hystorye of Olyuer of Castylle / and of the fair Helayne
daughter unto the king of England. Inprynted at London in Fleet street at the
