To the Truly Honorable, and vvorthie of Reverence, Dr JOHN FORBES OF CORSE,
Rector of the Universitie of Aberdene, and Professor of Divinity in the same.
THe Carian Lady, in a stately Frame
Of richest matter, with Dedalean Hands,
Caused build a Tomb, to vindicate the Fame
Of her deceassed Lord, from Lethes sands.
So shall this Treatise to the world declare,
Thy Father's Honor, and thy Filial Care.
In it Characters of His matchless Worth,
Are to the Life expressed, in measured lines;
And this ensueing piece is here set forth,
To be the Usher to these great ingyns.
Whose quills are deeply dyv'd in Cyrrha's Stream,
And so the fitter for this stately Theme.
A Dolorous Expression, of a woeful Breach made in our Church and Policy, By
the death of that Honorable, Discreit, and admirably gifted Prelate, PATRICKE
FORBES OF CORSE, Late Bishop of Aberdene, Chanceller and Restorer of the
Universitie of the same, and worthilie-one of his Majesty's Privy Counsel,
etc. Who, under the hope of a Glorious Resurrection, most cheerfully laid down
his Tabernacle, at his Palace in Aberdene, the xxviij of March, 1635.
COnsider ( Sacred Nine) the cause why I do weep,
And in this time of public Grief, a doleful co^sort keep.
Stricke sad upon your Lyrs, Threnodicallie sing,
And let the torrent of your tears match your Castal'an Spring.
Send out your sighs with mine, as Heralds of our woe.
To tell the world, we are injured, by man-kynds ruethles Foe,
Whose hand, alace; has spoyld our Countries rarest gemme,
And slain Minerva's Minion, sprung from a stately stem.
Who can abstain from Tears, to see his Shryne enterr'd,
On whom the Lord, with lib'rall hand, so many Gifts co^ferr'd*
And these in mercy were so seasoned with Grace,
That every eye saw him a man proportioned for his place.
And which adorned him much, and did enlarge his fame,
He clearly taught the ways of God, and walked in the same,
His thoughts converst with God, his lips were Truth her keys,
Authority and Courtesy were pincell'd in his eyes.
And what I ever thought, my pen shall now proclaim,
He was the splendour of our Church, and glory of his Name.
Our sovereign Lord, our Church, our Schools, and public Stat,
Do all concur (through sense of loss) for to condoll this fate.
For while he lived, his gifts were useful for them all:
But GOD for to afflict the earth, by death did him recall.
Leaving his darling Church, the Orphane of his care,
The world the relict of his worth, this Sea an empty Chair.
Yet every place retaynes* Characters, of his worth,
Which ravished minds did often admire, but no hand could set forth.
Then, Muse, be not ashamed, sincerely to confess,
That thou will but obscure his worth if thou preasse to express.
This pearlesse Prelates praise, in who^ we saw co^bynd
Minervas wit, Apollo's tongue, and Phineas zealous mind.
An unrelenting hope, firm faith, and daring cowrage;
A Soul devote, a life vnstayn'd, a kyndlie-manlie visage.
A will propense to good, a just-divyded ear;
A marble breast, well fortified against the assaults of Fear:
A heart enricht with love, a mind with deep conceptions;
A tongue and pen replenished with ravishing expressions.
His wit untied all knots, his cowrage overcame
All incident difficulties. He ever was the same.
But since my slow-plum'd Muse, with her vnsassel'd phraises,
Can not amount the high extent of his deserved praises,
I will resign this task to some Maron'an pen,
Which can more fitly celebrate this Quintessence of Men.
Yet no Virgil^an quill, can honor him so much,
As he will dignifie the same; his worthienesse was such.
Wherein I dare avow he has exceeded all
That ever did possess this Chair, I fear, or ever shall.
But if that Sions Lord, who treads upon the Spears,
Shall bless this Church with such a Guide? then i will recant my Fears.
And with a heart enlarged, praise HIM while I have breath.
Who only can fill up the breach, made by our Prelates death.
Of His Sepulcher.
IF halow'd Ashes can renown a place;
If Relicts of rare Saints procure respect:
If sacred Vessels of great gifts and grace,
Can viants hearts with deepest groans affect:
Then none can look upon this Prelates Urne,
But, with a due respect, must sigh, and mourn:
And for his worth prefer this sleeping rowme,
To Mausolus his much admired Tomb.

AN ECLOG On the Death of the same Incomparable Prelate:
Written by the foresaid Master DAVID LINDSAY, Person of BELHELVIE, and
Moderator of the Presbytery of ABERDENE.
Compraehensor. Viator. C. Speak Pastors of this Church, with whom I once
converst,
And tell me whence your tears proceeds; Are all your flocks dispersed*

V. Is this our Prelates voice, whom we enjoyde of late?
Is It thy imparadized Soul, that does condole our state.
Then give triumphing ghosts, can stoop to things below,
And Condescend the afflicted case of Militants to know,
We will unfold the cause, of our luxurious tears;
It Is thy translation from this Seat, to the celestial spears.

C. What? do ye grudge my state, who have made gain by death*

V. No: but lament our loss of thee, with sorrow-sounding breath.
How can we cease from tears, when we remember now,
The loving aspects of thy face, the terrors of thy brow?
The first inlyf'd our hearts; the nixt did guarde our sheep;
Thy zeal, thy wit, thy active care, did all in safety keep.
When thou our Center wast, we thy Circumference,
The Rod of Aaron blossomed fair, by thy wise influence.
But now we languish all, our Halcyon days are ended:
And that most justly, we confess, for happy time mispende^.
Our hands were steeled by thee; thou cleared our clowdie sight;
When any thing was out of frame, thou joynted all things right.
The errant, wilful, weak thou carefully observed,
Whom thou reclaym'd, constaain'd, releiv'd, thou all in peace preserved.
Our loss, alace, is gain, to the Ignatian brood,
Whose machinations thou forsaw, whose practice thou withstood.
Since thou removedst hence, they dare accoast our Flocks;
The wholesome seed that we have sown, there nociue darnell chocks.
Now at thy empty Chair we stand amazed to see,
So great a Tropicke of our state so suddenly to be.

C. Wmquhill Commilitons, why should ye think it strange,
To see a Church that is militant, subjected to a change?
For neither time nor place, is priviledg'd below:
A Church that wants parallaxes, is in the heavens, ye know.
And give the times be evil preserve your own souls pure:
That which ye cannot rectify, with grief of heart endure.
Let not your zeal disbend, prove faithful in your places;
Communicete with no man's sin, set GOD before your faces:
Who will your pains at last remunerate in love,
And place you with the rest of Saints upon these Thrones above,
Then let hope of this allay your cresses here:
Lift up your heads, ye drouping Saints, for your releasse draws near.
I know Viators think, their LORD makes long delay:
But with the weight of endless bless, He Will recompense His stay.

V. And art thou gone, dear ghost?

C. Yes, I have stayed too long;
For I must go, and bear my part of our triumphing Song:
Whereof I know one day ye shall sustain your parts,
And sing the Praises of the Lamb, with jubilating hearts*
Mean time present your selves, with heaven erected eyes,
And recommend your faynting hearts, your weakened hands and knees,
To him whom GOD has made, Brabeutes of your host:
He hears your cries, He sees your tears, not one of them is lost.
As we have joyful proof, who are triumphers now:
The like estate, undoubtedly, He will vouchsafe on you.
Under the hope whereof I bid you all Goodnight,
Till ye enjoy what ye expect, and Faith be changed in sight.

A SERMON, Preached at the Funeral of the R. R. Father in GOD, PATRICKE
FORBES, Late Lord Bishop of Aberdene, In the Cathedral Church of that Dioces,
the 9 of April, 1635; by ROBERT BARON, Doctor and Professor of Divinity, and
one of the Ministers of GOD'S Word in the Burgh of ABERDENE.
REVEL. CHAP. xiiij. VERSE. 13. Blessed are the dead, which die in the LORD.


THis Sentence may justly be called an Heavenly Sentence; and that not only
in these general respects, for the which other passages of Scripture are so
called; but also for special causes, or reasons. For it was delivered to
Saynct John by a voice from Heaven. It tells us, that perfect happiness is
not to be found in earth, but in Heaven; that none may exspect, or attain
thereunto, but these who live and die in a League with Heaven; and, as it were,
in the arms, in the bosom of the King of Heaven; and, that they can not come
to it, but by death, which is to them Ianua Coeli, the Gate of Heaven. The LORD
furnish us at this time with a competent measure of heavenly Grace, and fill
our souls with heavenly thoughts; that this our present exercise may tend to
the glory of Him that dwells in the Heavens, and to our benefit, who exspect
one day to see His glorious, His beautiful, and lovely Countenance there.

In this Sentence we have only two things to consider: to wit, the persons of
whom the Spirit of God here speaks, and the blessedness attributed unto
them. The persons who are the subject of this proposition, are the godly, who
have departed this life. Ye have a description of them in these words, The
dead who die in the Lord: where by the dead, we must not with Ambrose, Or
rather, the Author of that Co^mentarie upon the Revelation, which is falselie
attributed to S. Ambrose.
and Alcazar, understand these who are spirituallie, or misticallie dead to the
world, and to sin: neither will we follow the fantastical conceit of
Aureolus, who did understand by the dead here spoken of, these who by
monastical vows have sequestrated themselves from the world, and the ordinary
conversation of men. But we must here understand these who are naturally
dead, or whose souls are separated from their bodies. Neither must we limitate
the subject of this proposition to those who were dead before S. John heard
this voice in Pathmos; as if blessedness were here ascribed to them only,
others being excluded, who were to die thereafter. But the words of this
proposition must be understood cum ampliatione terminorum, as the Summulists
call it: that is, they must be ampliated, or extended to al differences of
time. For the meaning of this sentence, is, not only that the dead who have
already died in the Lord, are blessed; but also, that these who hereafter
shall die in the Lord, shall by death attain unto perfect Happiness, and
Blessedness.

The description of the persons, to whom Blessedness is here attributed,
consists of a general part, common to all; and of a particular part,
limitating this description to the Elect. To die, is common to all: it is the
way of all the earth. To die in the Lord, Joshua 13.14.
is the way not of all, but of some few, or the last part of that narrow way,
which few do find. Matthew. 7.13.14.
And to this is another way opposite, which is the way of many: even that
broadway which leads to destruction, in the which all do walk who are not
in Christ. So, then, if we consider the general part, or the genus of this
description, together with the limitation, or difference added thereunto; and
if we compare this difference with its contrary, (for every difference has
its contrary) we shall have these three ways of men mentioned in Scripture;
to wit, The way of all, the way of few, Via omnium, via paucorum, and via
multorum.
and the way of many.

As for the general part of this description set down in the word dead, I can
not let it go without some observation; neither can I observe any thing so
fitly there-ane^t, as that same which I have already touched; to wit, that it
is a general, yea, so general, that it includes all who have been before us in
the world, (those being excepted, whom GOD extraordinarily has exempted from
death) and ere it be long shall actuallie include us all, who are now in it, as
also those, who when we are removed, shall come in our rooms. No Nation, no
Province, nor City, yea, no rank nor degree of men, has exemption from this
common mortality, or necessity of dying: and therefore Hormisdas the Persian,
who fled from his native country to Rome, in the days of Constantius the
Emperor,, Zonaras Annal. tom* 3.
and who was in Rome, when Constantius, after he had overcome Magnentius, and
his adherents, entered the city in a most magnificke and triumphant manner,
being asked by the Emperor, what he thought of that glorious city, and the
rare monumentes he had seen therein? wittily replied, checking the
Emperor's pride, that nothing which he had observed in Rome pleased him so
well, Id tantum sibi placuisse aiebat, quod homines didicisset ibi quoque mori.
Ammianus Marcellinus lib. 16. c. 17.
as this, that the inhabitants thereof were mortal, and died as other men.

This general and inevitable necessity of death, is known to al, even to the
Ethnicks, by an experimental tradition, almost as old as the world. But the
knowledge which we who are Christians have of it,- as it is more excellent,
being more perfect, and grounded upon supernatural or divine Revelation; so it
obliedgeth us to make better use of the consideration of death, than others can
make. How deficient we are in this, the profane lives of many amongst us do
sufficiently declare. We die daily, we are daily changed, Epist. 3. ad
Heliod.
says Jerome, and yet we live as if we were immortal. Xerxes, when he viewed
his hudge Army from an eminent place, wept, because within an hundredth years
none of all that number should be found alive. But, O, (says Jerome) if we
might ascend to such an high mountain, Ibidem.
or spy-tower, from whence we might see the whole earth under our feet, then I
should let you see the ruins of the whole world, the conflicts of nations, the
great diversity of the estates or conditions of men, and that within a short
time, not only such a multitude as Xerxes his army, but all the men who now
are upon this stage, shall be removed from it by death. This sight might make
any man weep, if he would seriously consider that which my Text insinuates,
that the greatest part of these who are now upon this stage, and ere it be
long, shall be in their graves, are to pass from the miseries and troubles of
this life, to payns endless and easelesse in Hell. For this Text attributes
Happiness only to those few, who die in the Lord; and consequently
declares, that all others after death are eternally miserable. But of this I
shall speak heere-after.

I come now to the particular part of this description, set down in these
words, Who die in the Lord. Anent the which, one thing is of it self clear,
and manifest; to wit, that it is proper and peculiar to the Elect; and no ways
can be extended to the wicked, who depart this life. But two things do here
occur, which do need explication: One is, whether or not this particular part
be so ample, as that it comprehends all the godly, or elect? The other is,
how, and in what sense, these whom it comprehends, are said to die in the
Lord? As for the first; some popish writers, because this text, if it be
extended to all the Sayncts, who are departed, or shall depart this life, is as
contrary to their doctrine of Purgatory, as Blessedness is to Misery, Rest
to Vexation, and Reward of good works to Punishment of sins: therefore they
craftily labor to restrict the words to the Martyrs, affirming, that by dying
in the Lord here, is understood dying for the Lord: and consequently, that
blessedness immediately after death, is not ascrybed here to all the elect;
but only to those, who seal their profession with their blood, and are
crowned with martyrdom. This gloss may seem the more probable, because it is
followed by some Reformed Divines; by Beza in special, and by Piscator, in
their Notes upon this place. Others of our Adversaries do extend the
particular part of this description somewhat farther; and yet not so far as
they should: for they think, that it comprehends not only Martyrs, but also
all these Christians whom they call men perfectly just, or men free of all
sins, even venial, and of all guilt of punishment due unto them for their
mortal sins. Both these sorts of men, say they, are said to die in the Lord,
by way of excellency; because they are perfectly united with Christ; whereas
others may be said to die partly in the Lord, in respect of true charity, or
the love of God, which they carry with them; and partly not in the Lord, in
respect of their sins, which also they carry with them. So says
Bellarmine, in his first book, Cap. 12. resp. vd object. 10.
De Purgatorio, and diverse Modern Jesuits following him.

These restrictions of the particular part of this description, we do reject;
and that not without reason, as ye shall shortly perceive: and on the contrary,
that all Gods dear children may have their due consolation from this Heavenly
Sentence, we affirm, that the Spirit of God here speaks of all these, who
die in the estate of grace; and proclaims them al to be blessed, whatsoever
their worldly estate, or condition has been in this life, whatsoever be the
cause of their death, and whatsoever be their estate, condition, or carriage
in death.

First, I say, all they who die in the estate of grace are happy, whatsoever
their worldly estate has been in this life; James 2.5.
that the poor ones of this world, who are rich in faith, 1 Thessalonians. 4.18.
may comfort themselves with these words, as well as the great and mighty
ones. Worldly happiness is not granted unto them: and their estate is so
miserable in the eyes of the world, that the rich apprehend a great difference,
and put a large distance betwixt them, and the Poor. They will not suffer them
to sit at table with them; nay, not to walk with them, or stand beside them:
and whereas they should pity their wants, often times they laugh and jest at
them, according to that of the Poet; Iuvenal. Satyr. 3.
Nil habet infelix paupertas durius in se,
Quam quod ridiculos homines facit.
But within a short time death puts an end to that difference, and equalleth
them in glory and happiness with kings and Emperors. Ye that are rich,
consider this, and despise not the Poor, when ye look upon their base, and
contemptible worldly estate: but rather be ready to help them; remembering
this which the Spirit of God here tells you, That if they die in the Lord,
they shall one day be participant of that same Kingdom, that same Robe of
immortality, that same Banquet of Angels, which ye look for. And therefore
holy Augustine, checking the disdaynfull and uncharitable carriage of the Rich
toward the Poor, wittily and pithilie says unto them; Sermon. 2. de tempere.
Wherefore shall not the Poor eat with thee, who shall one day reygne with
thee? Wherefore will thou not give so much as thy old Coat to him, who shall
one day receive the Robe of immortality with thee? How is he not worthy of
thy Bread, who has obtained one and the selfsame Baptism with thee? or of
the relics of thy dishes, who is with thee invited to the Banquet of Angels?
Be not proud, then, of your worldly prerogatives, neither apprehend such
distance or difference betwixt you and the Poor, as ye do. The difference
which these few worldly things makes betwixt you and them, is but for a
short time, and in things of small moment: the matters of greatest consequence
God has made common to rich and poor: Duo optima, Duo pessima.

Duo per^culosissima.


even the two best things that can befall men, to wit, grace and glory; the
two worst things, to wit, sin and damnation; and the two most dangerous
things, to wit, death and judgment. The Poor are not excluded from the first
two, more than the Rich; neither are the Rich exempted from the other two, more
than the Poor. And as for the last two, neither Rich nor Poor can eschew
them. For it is appointed unto men, once to die; but after this the judgment.
Such like, Heb. 9.27.
ye that are poor in this world, and rich in faith, possess your souls in
patience, and be not grieved because the Rich and ye meet unequal upon the
streets; for ye shall meet equal with them a^ the right Hand of the Judge. Yea,
if they be not rich toward God, Luke 12.^^
and as they are charged, 1. TIM. 6. rich in good works, they shall meet very
unequal with you in judgment: for ye shall have dominion over them, in
ma^utin^ illo, in that morning of Resurrection, when by the bright appearance
of the Sun of Righteousness, these things which now are invisible, during
this night of ignorance, shall be brought to light: to wit, the hid things of
darkness, 1. Cor. 4.5.
the secret counsels of the heart, the mysteries of Gods providence in
governing the world, and the glory, happiness, and excellency of the sons
of God. 1. John, 3.2
For although we be the sons of God, yet it does not appear what we shall
be: that is, how happy and glorious we shall be in the world to come. But in
that Day it shall appear to all; and the wicked shall see it, with unspeakable
grief, and astonishment; and shall say of the godly man whom before they
despised; This was he whom we had sometyms in derision, and a proverb of
reproach: we fools accounted his life madness, and his end to be without
honor. Wisdom 5. verse. 3.4.5.
How is he numbered amongst the children of God! and his lo^ is amongst the
Sayncts.

Secondly, I say, all these who die in the estate of grace, are happy,
whatsoever the cause of their death be: that is, whether they die as Martyrs
for the Lord, or as ordinary professors in the Lord. For, first, as for the
matter it self, although the Martyrs have an eminent degree of glory in
Heaven above many others, which the Schoolmen, by a barbarous word of their
own devysing, call aureolam martyrum; yet neither is Blessedness immediately
after death appointed only for them, even by the confession of our
Adversaries; nor yet is that wherein the glory and excellency of martyrdom
chiefelie consists, altogether proper, and peculiar to them; but, in some
sort, common to other Sayncts. The dignity and excellency of martyrdom
stands in two things; Ad Martyrium completum duo conc^rrunt: Iusta voluntas,
and justa causa. In 4. (...)
which, as Bonaventur says, do make up a complete martyrdom: First, in a
pious willingness, or desire to undergo whatsoever tribulation, yea* death it
self, for the testimony of Christ, if God should require it. Secondly, in the
goodness of the cause wherefore we suffer. For Martyrs non facit poena, sed
causa, says holy Augustine; Conc. 2. in Psalm. 34.
it is not the suffering, but the cause of suffering, which makes the Martyr.
Now, the cause of suffering is twofold; to wit, Causa calamitatis, the cause
wherefore the calamity comes upon the Martyr, and Causa tolerantiae, Causa
calamitatis, and causa tolerantiae.
seu patientiae, the cause wherefore he willingly does undergo and endure
it. The dignity and glory of Martyrdom depends as much from the second, as
from the first; and perhaps more: For although a man be persecuted for a good
cause; that is, for profession of the truth; yet if the cause or motive, which
makes him to undergo persecution, be bad and perverse; as for example, Timeo
dicere, sed dicendu^ est, Martyrium ipsum si ideo fiat, ut admirationi and
laudi habeamur a fratribus; frustra sanguis effusus est. Comment. in Gal. 5.
If he suffer only or chiefly that he may be praised or admired of men, he
sheddeth his blood in vain, as Jerome says. Now, to apply all this to the
present purpose: Many who do not actuallie suffer death for the cause of
Christ, have in some sort both these two things, wherein the glory and
dignity of Martyrdom chiefly consists: to wit, First, a pious willingness
or readiness to suffer the loss of all things; yea, of life it self, for
Christ's sake: which is a thing so acceptable and gracious in the sight of God,
that He esteems this a kind of dying for His sake. And therefore Chrysostom
writing upon these words, (ROMANS 8.36.) For thy sake we are killed all the day
long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter, says, Sermon. 15. in epist. ad
Romans
that although we actually can die but once, for the Lord's sake; yet God has
granted this to us, that if we be ready or willing to die for Him, we may,
by virtue of this our resolution and willingness, die every day for Him; yea,
every day we may die many times for Him; and so obtain not one, but many
crowns of Martyrdom herafter. Secondly, as for the cause of the ordinary
sufferings of true Christians* although in time of their troubles or
distresses, the evil, or calamity does not always come upon them for the
Lord's sake; yet it is for the Lords sake that they patiently suffer it. And
when they die, although we cannot say, that they are put to death for the
Lord's cause; yet we may say, that they accept of death, and suffer willingly
all the pains of it, for the Lords cause; (to wit, because it is the Lords
will, and because they long to be with Him:) and consequently we may even
say, in some sort, that they die for the Lord. Hence it is, that diverse of the
Fathers have exte^ded this glorious title of Martyrdom, to those who died not
for the cause of Christ, as to the blessed Virgin, to the penitent Thief,
yea, in general, to all Sayncts Cypr. Ep. 73 ad Iubajanum, Author sermon. de
pass. and de Coena Domini apud eundem. August. l. 1. de anima, et ejus origin.

.

Next, as to the Apostles phrase; although the particle, in the Lord, be
sometimes taken as all one with for the Lord, yet in phrases like to this,
which the Apostle here uses, Ioh. 15.4 5.6.7. Romans 8.1. and 16.7. 1. Cor.
15.18. 1 Thessalonians. 4.14. and 16.
such as to be in Christ, to abide in Christ, to sleep in Christ, or to be
asleep in Him, it is not so taken, but only imports the union of the
faithful with Christ, or else the continuance of that union: so that the
restriction of this text to Martyrs, who die for the Lord, is violent, and
repugnant to the native, or ordinary sense of the phrase. But although it were
not violent, yet we would have sufficient reason to reject it; for phrases of
sacred Scripture ought not to be restricted, nor yet extended beyond their
ordinary signification, except upon solid and evident warrant or reason from
the analogy of faith, or from the Text it self. But no such reason can be
brought to prove, that the Apostle is here speaking only of Martyrs, as some
of the most famous Popish writers do confess: Ribera* Viegas, Cornel. a
Lapide, and Estius, all writing upon this place.
yea, the Jesuit, Cornelius a Lapide, speaking of these writers, who extend the
words of this text to all the godly, says, that they interpret this text
before and planius, more playnlie, and more fully. And as for the judgment
of the best and most famous interpreters of this book, we have many of them
for us; (to wit, Ambrose, Primasius, Andreas Caesariensis, Beda, Richardus de
Sancto-Victore, Ioachim. Abbas, Coelius Pannonius, etc.) yea, so many, that
scarce can our Adversaries name one of them, who strictly and precisely
adhereth to their exposition. To them we may add other ancient writers, who
have spoken occasionally of this text, as S. Augustine, in his 20 book De
civit. Dei, cap. 9. (although the Rhemists imagine that he favors their
gloss) Bernard, in diverse places of his works Sermon. 2. in festo omniu^
sanctorum. Sermon. 24. (...) parvis, and epist. 98. de Maccabais.
and others.

Thirdly, I say, al these who die in the estate of grace are blessed, whatsoever
their spiritual estate or condition be in the hour of death: for if they be in
Christ, there is no condemnation to them; yea, Romans 8.1.
they cannot come to condemnation, Ioh. 5.24.
but are already passed from death unto life. And if they being fred from
sin, and made the servants of God, have had their fruit here unto holiness,
Romans 6.22.
what can follow hereafter, but the end everlasting life? How then can they be
condemned after death, to grievous and intolerable payns in Purgatory? or
what may hinder their present admission and entrance into their Masters joy?
for all their sins are pardoned to them; yea, so pardoned, that God will not
remember them any more to punish them Esa. 38.17 43.25. and 44.22. Ezech. 18
22. Mich. 7.19^
. I know our adversaries do speak and think far otherways of the remission
of sins, whether they be mortal or venial, as they call them. For, first,
concerning the remission of mortal sins, they too boldly affirm, that
although the elect, when they are first reconciled to God, or justified in
Baptism, they get a plenarie or full remission, not only of their sins, but
also of the whole punishment due unto them: yet if they sin mortally
afterward, upon their repentance they are fred indeed from eternal
punishment; but in lieu thereof they must endure temporal pains, and these
most grievous, in Purgatory, if they do not free themselves from them by
voluntary satisfaction, or penal exercyses in this life. And this they labor
to prove, partly because we find in Scripture, that God, after he has
pardoned the great and enormious offenses of his servants, has inflicted many
times great temporal punishments upon them; in special, upon Moses, Aaron,
Numb. 20.12. 2. Sam. 12. and 24. Psalm. 99.8. 1. Cor. 11.31.
David, and others: and partly because the ancient Church observed a severe
discipline toward those who were relapse in mortal sins; imposing upon
them long and paynfull exercyses of repentance; which they styled by the name
of Satisfaction.

It is no strange thing with our Adversaries, to affirm, that God pardons
mortal sins committed after Baptism, with a reservation of the temporal
punishment, which is only a part of the punishment due unto them, seeing they
are so bold, as to maintain, that GOD, after this life, pardons venial
sins, with a reservation of the whole punishment; that is, discharging
nothing of the punishment due unto men for them: Vasquez in 3. part. Th. tom.
4. quaest. 87. art. 1. (...). 2. Suarez in cande^ part. Th. tom. 4. disp. 11.
sect. 4. Caspar Hurtado, disp. 2. de poenite^tia. Diffic. 17.
And, which is more strange, that God, de potentia absoluta, might, if he
pleased, pardon a man his mortal sins, and yet punish him eternally in hell
for them Suarez opere cit. disp. 10 sect. 2. Tannerus, in 3. part. Th. disp 5.
cap. 3. these. 64. and alii.
. We have not learned to distinguish so subtillie betwixt the remission of
sins, and the remission of the punishment due unto them. But on the contrary
we hold, and that with most sufficient warrant, both from Scripture and
Antiquity, that when GOD pardons our sins, he does it not with reservation
of a part of the punishment due unto us ex rigore justitiae; much less of the
whole punishment; but discharges all punishment of malediction, or pure
revenge. As for these calamities or temporal evils, which many times have
been inflicted upon the Elect, they cannot serve for that which our
Adversaries intend; that is, to prove, that remission of sins in Baptism is
more perfect, than it is after Baptism; or, that the whole punishment is
discharged in Baptism, and not thereafter. For we see by experience, that
infants are not fred by Baptism from sickness, death, and other miseries,
which were inflicted upon man-kynde for sin: and consequently the whole
temporal punishment is not discharged in Baptism, more than after Baptism.
They answer to this, That these are not properly punishments, but rather
penalities, as they call them; Penalita^^s.
and that because they are common to all man-kynd, and have their original
from the natural constitution of man's body. But, first, what is that to the
purpose? They were inflicted upon man-kynd in the wrath of God, for the common
transgression of our first parents: and unto all these, who are not in Christ,
they are most truly and properly punishments. Secondly, we can easily
cloze up this lurking-hole to our Adversaries. For what if a man baptized after
he has come to perfect age, have been before his baptism plagued by God for
his bygone actual sins, with poverty, blindness, lamenesse, or any other
grievous sickness; will our Adversaries say, that by Baptism he shall be fred
from them; as they imagine, that Constantine, when he was baptized by
Silvester, was fred from his leprosy? I think they dare not say it: for then,
as Aquinas and Durandus do reason, men would seek the benefit of Baptism for
worldly respects; to wit, Propter impassibilitate^ prasentis vita, and non
propter gloriam vitae aterna. Aquinas 3. part. Summa. qu. 69. art. 3. Propter
commoditatom vitae prasentis, and non propter fructum vita spiritualis.
Durandus, in 4. Sent. Did. 4. Quast. 3.
that they may be fred from temporal miseries; and not for the glory of
eternal life.

Ye see, then, that this difficulty anent the reservation of temporal
punishment, after sin is remitted, concerns our Adversaries, as well as us:
and that, for ought we know of God his dealing with men in baptism, and in
penitential reconciliation after baptism, temporal punishment is alyke
discharged in both: so that, if baptismall remission free a man from
Purgatorie-fire after this life, penitential remission must have the like
effect. Wherefore, as our Adversaries do say of these penalities, or temporal
miseries, unto which the baptized are subject after baptism, that they are not
truly and properly punishments, (they should say, they are not punishments
meerlie vindictiue; for indeed they are punishments) that the baptized are
still subject to them, for their own weal: especially to the effect they may
be conformed to Christ their head: that although they remain after baptismall
remission, yet baptismall remission is full and perfect; no ways exposing the
baptized to a necessity of suffering purgatorie-paynes after this life: and,
that although men be not fred from them presently; yet by virtue of baptismall
remission, they shall in the world to come, especially in the day of
resurrection, be fully fred from them. So we may say, and ought to say, of
these temporal afflictions and calamities, unto which the Elect are subject,
after their sins are pardoned in penitential reconciliation: First, that
they are not punishments meerlie vindictiue, or satisfactorie to the justice of
God. Secondly, that they are inflicted upon them for their weal; to wit, that
they may be unto them exercyses of their virtues, and means whereby they are
conformed unto Christ their head. Thirdly, that although they be inflicted
after penitential remission, yet penitential remission is perfect, and no
ways exposes penitent sinners to a necessity of suffering purgatorie-payns
after this life. And last of al, that although penitent sinners be not fred
from them in this life, yet by virtue of penitential remission, and of Christ's
merits, which by it are applied unto them, they shall obtain a total and
perfect deliverance from them in the life to come, when all the stayne, or
deformity of sin, shall be fully purged out. Here indeed such a
deliverance cannot be expected: For although our Savior has merited unto us a
deliverance, both from sin, and also from the punishments and consequents of
it; yet seeing it has not pleased God to free us fully from sin in this
life, it is not to be marveled, that we are not fully delivered, so long as
we live here, from these evils and miseries, which are the punishments and
consequenrs of sin. But blessed be God, as we are here fred from the dominion
of sin, so also are we fred from the malediction of the punishment. And as we
shall hereafter be altogether fred from sin it self; so shall we also be fred
altogether from the miseries, which are the consequents thereof.

But, to leave this, and to come to that other argument, which our Adversaries
do bring against us, from the severe Discipline observed in the ancient
Church, toward those, who had fallen into mortal sins after baptism, and
from the long and paynful exercyses of repentance imposed upon them: truly it
is a wonder that our Adversaries should be so impudent, as to affirm that,
that laudable custom of the Ancients does make for them; seeing it makes so
manifestly against them. For these penitential exercyses were not by the
ancient Church imposed upon men after absolution, or remission of sins, as
means requisite for a removal of temporal punishments, or for deliverance from
purgatorie-paynes; but were imposed ordinarily before it, as means requisite for
obtaining remission of the sin it self, and deliverance from eternal
damnation. For the Fathers gave not absolution to sinners, until such time, as
they had accomplished penitential actions enjoined: and after absolution was
given, they did not any more impose such penance upon them; which I might
easily prove by a cloud of ancient witnesses; but I need not, seeing so many
of our Adversaries do confess it Bellarm. Lib. 4. de pae^it. cap. 5 Estius in
4. sent. did. 15.. 10. Suarez in 3. part. Th. tom. 4. disp. 38. sect. 2.. 5.
Vasquez in eandem part. Th. tom. 4. quast. 90. art. 1. dub. 2. number. 26. Vide
etiam Cassand. art. 12. de poenit. Albasp. de veter. Eccles. ritibus, lib. 2.
observe. 3. and Rhenanum in Annotat. in Tertulliani Librum de Poenitentia.
. By this ye may perceive, that the Fathers of the ancient Church believed,
that in penitential reconciliation, there is a full discharge of the whole
punishment. For if they had thought otherwise, they would have imposed penal
exercyses upon penitentes after they were absolved; to the effect, that by them
they might be fred from these reserved, or vndischarged punishments.

I know Bellarmine says, that those penal exercyses which in the ancient
Church preceeded absolution, were imposed ad poenam temporalem expiandam, to
the end, that the penitents might be fred from those temporal punishments,
which would have been reserved after the remission of their sins, if those
satisfactorie exercyses had not preceeded. But this is flat contrary to the
mind of those Fathers: for they thought, that if those penitential exercyses,
or satisfactions, as they called them, (but not in that sense, in the which
Papists now take this word) did not preceed, nothing of the punishment should
be discharged unto the delinquents; and consequently, that one part of it, to
wit, the temporal punishment, should not be reserved. Temporal punishment is
said to be reserved only when the aeternall is discharged; or, as our
Adversaries speak, when the aeternall is so remitted, that in liew thereof,
temporal punishment is imposed. But the Ancients thought, that, without
praecedent satisfaction, by poenall exercyses, aeternall punishment is not
discharged: or, which is all one, sin is not remitted: Terenl. lib. de
Poenitentiae, Cap. 6. Quam porro ineptum p^enitententiam non adimplere, and
veniam sustinere; id est, exspectare. Ambros. ep. 82. ad Eccles. Vercellensem.
Qua nobis salus esse potest nisi jesunio eluerimus peccata nostra? Et ad
Virginem lapsam, Cap. 8. Poenitudo enim lapsis necessaria est, sicut vulneratis
necessaria sunt medicamina. Et infra; Grande scelus, grandem necessariam habet

baptismum and DEI notitiam corruerit in hoc corpus mortis, sciat se purgandum
afflictione poenitentiae diuturna, aut poenali d^lore, non quotidiana gratia
CHRISTI; id est, facili remissione, -- aut certe pro iis deputandum se esse
postea poenis aeternis, etc.
and, consequently, they thought, that when satisfaction does not proceed,
temporal punishment is not reserved.

Ye have heard what Popish doctors say concerning the greater, or mortal
sins of those who die in the Lord, and concerning the temporal punishment
which they think is ever reserved, when they are remitted after Baptism. Now
I come to the smaller sins of the Godly, which they call Venial. Our
Adversaries say of them, that although a man die in the Lord, yet he may die
with the guiltiness of these sins, not having as yet obtained pardon or
remission of them; especially if he die suddenly, or in the rage of a fever:
and that in respect he has never retracted them by repentance, nor craved
pardon for them. In which case, say they, he cannot enter into Heaven
immediately after death, (because no polluted or unclean thing can enter into
that glorious City) but must, for a time, be tormented in Purgatory, to
the effect he may be fully cleansed from the guiltiness of those sins. This
comfortless doctrine of our Adversaries, consists of three Assertions, which
we shall particularly, but very shortly, consider. The first is, That sin
is never pardoned, except it be retracted by repentance: or, to use their own
phrase, except there be some real change in the sinner, or some praevious
disposition, whereby he is fitted, and prepared, for receaving remission. The
second is, That those of the Elect, who die suddenly, or in a raging Fever,
can not have this praevious disposition, which consists in the acts of
repentance: and consequently, they die without remission of their venial
sins. The third is, That they who die so, must be purged from their
guiltiness, by suffering Purgatorie-payns.

The first of these Assertions, if it be taken in its full generality, and
extended to all Cases, it ought not to be admitted. For although in that Great
and Main Justification, whereby we are translated from the estate of sin,
into the estate of Grace, mortal sin is not remitted to those who are come
to perfect age, without some real and intrinsecall alteration in them, or
without some praevious disposition, whereby they are disposed, and fitted for
it; according to that of holy Augustine, ^ui fecit te sine te, no^ justificat
te sine te. Sermon. 15. de Verbis Apostol^, c. 11.
He who made thee, without thy consent, and concurrence, does not justify
thee without thy consent, and concurrence. Yet it is possible, yea, very
probable, that these smaller sins are sometyms remitted by our Gracious LORD,
to those who are already justified, without any praevious change, or
disposition, on their part; especially when by suddentie of death, and
indisposition of body and mind, they are impeded from considering, and
acknowledging of their offenses. This should not seem strange to our
Adversaries seeing many of their modern scholasticke writers, and those of
greatest note, do teach; First, that God, according to the fullness of his
absolute power, might, if he pleased, remit sins both mortal and venial,
without any infusion of grace, yea, without any intrinsecall change, or
praevious disposition by repentance in those to whom they are remitted Suarez
de gratia* lib. ^. c. 23. Cu^iel in 1am 2ae qu. 113. art. 2 dub. 2. Zumel in
eand. qu. Th. art. 2. and Ta^nerus in 1am 2ae disp 4 cap. 4. these. 66.
. Secondly, that mortal sins not only may be, but also sometimes are
remitted, without any act of contrition, (or formal repentance, as they call
it) especially in the case of oblivion; that is, when a man is altogether
unmindful of them Suarez in 3. part. Th. tom. 4. disp. 9. sect. 1. Vasq. in
eandem part. Th. qu. 86. art. 2. dub. 1. number. 18.
. Thirdly, that venial sins may be, and often are, remitted, without any
act of repentance, whether formal, or virtuall, by aspersion of holy Water,
Episcopal benediction, giving of Alms, etc. and that ex opere operato Valent.
in Th. tom. 4. disp. 7. qu. 4. punct. 1. Victor. in summa Sacram. tract. de
poenit. number. 110 and Mel^h. Canus, l. 12. de locis, cap. 23. ad 9.
. Now, if God, out of the fulness of his absolute power, can remit any
sin, without repentance upon our part; and if he sometimes does show this
fulness of his power, together with the greatness of his mercy, in
pardoning the mortal sins of the Elect, without any praevious act of
contrition, when they cannot be remembered, as also in pardoning venial sins
without the same, even when they may be easily remembered; shall we not
think, that he will dispense with the defect of repentance in them for their
venial sins, and supply it by gracious condonation, when through suddentie
of their departure, or through indisposition of body and mind, they are not
able to have it? Many things in such a case plead for mercy and favor to
the godly man; yea, plead more powerfullie and effectually with GOD, than
aspersion of holy water, Episcopal benediction, or any other of these
things, which Papists call Sacramentalia: to wit, inherent grace, (which is a
habitual repentance; for by it we habituallie detest and forsake all sin)
the prayer of the faithful, who are then present with him, the prayer of the
Church in general, which at all times recommendeth to God most earnestly
those who are in distress and danger, either temporal, or spiritual; and,
above all, the intercession of our Lord and Savior for him in the Heavens. To
these we may add the prayers of the godly man himself, (who dies so) by
which long before death, preparing himself for death, he most frequentlie and
ferventlie besought the Lord, to grant unto him a happy departure, and a full
discharge of all his sins before his dissolution. The godly put up this
request to God ordinarily in their prayers; and consequently it is granted
unto them. For seeing the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous avayleth
much; James 5.16.
and seeing Christ has told us, that if we abide in him, and his words
abide in us, John 15.7.
we shall ask what we will, and it shall be done unto us; it were great
folly to to imagine, that the godly in vain put up this request to GOD.

In the second Assertion of our Adversaries, there is no certainty at all. For
although a godly man die suddenly, or in a great rage, and distemper, yet who
knows what operation the Spirit of God has secretly upon his departing soul
immediately before it be loosed from the body; or what communication he
has with God, after the passages of his senses are so stopped, that he can
have no communication with men? It may be, when he seems to thee altogether
senseless, that then he is most sensible of his spiritual estate, and is
crying, Petcavi, Miserere; 2. Sam. 24.10.
I have sinned greatly in that I have done; and now I beseech thee, O Lord,
take away the iniquity of thy servant. It may be, when he is speachlesse, and
past conference with men, that he is then entertaining an heavenly conference
or Dialogue with Christ his Savior: that he hears Christ saying, Surely, I
come quickly; and is replying, Even so, Come, Revel* 22.20.
Lord Jesus: that he is saying, Lord, remember me, for now thou art in thy
Kingdom: and, Luke 23.42.43.
that he hears CHRIST rounding in his ear, that which He said to the
penitent thief, To day shall thou be with me in Paradise. I will not take
upon me to determine, whether or not these of the godly who die suddenly, or
in a raging Fever, have any such exercise of prayer and repentance, after they
have lost the use of their senses: But this one thing I will say; If God have
decreed to pardon no sin, how small soever, but upon subsequent repentance, as
our Adversaries affirm in their first Assertion, it is more than probable,
that GOD grants that benefit to all the godly before their departure,
whatsoever be the manner of their death, or their carriage in death.

The third Assertion of our Adversaries, which is drawn out of the other two,
as a conclusion from its praemisses, has but two faults: one is, that these
praemisses, upon which it is grounded, are not sure. The other is, that
although they were infallibly true, yet the conclusion it self might be
denied. For although we should grant, that repentance by Gods appointment and
decree, is absolutely necessary for remission of every sin, how small
soever, and that many godly men die without it; yet it will not follow, that
they must be tormented after this life in Purgatory. For the common and
received doctrine of the Papists themselves, anent the remission of these
venial sins, with which a man dies, does show us a fair and easy way,
to eschew that melancholious and fearful consequent. For they all (some few
being excepted) affirm, that those venial sins from which the Elect are not
fred before death, are remitted to them in the very instant of death, or
(which is all one) in that instant, in the which the soul is separated from
the body. This doctrine was not only maintained by Alensis, Thomas, Scotus,
Durandus, Almainus, and many other ancient Schoolmen, (who indeed do
differ very much amongst themselves, anent the mean or disposition, whereby
remission of venial sins is obtained, in that first instant of separation)
but also by their most famous late writers, who have handled this matter,
partly in their Disputes against us, and partly in their Commentaries and
Disputes upon the third part of Thomas his Sum, Quaest. 87. Suarez in 3.

Now, if these sins be remitted in the moment of dissolution, what can
follow after that moment, but eternity of blessedness? For that which did
let or impede the present entrance of the godly man into his Masters joy, to
wit, his guiltiness of venial sins, is removed by Gods gracious
condonation, in the very dissolution of his soul and his body, as our
Adversaries affirm. And perhaps it is so: yea, that most learned and judicious
Divine, Doctor FIELD, Appendic. ad Lib. 5. de Ecclesia, Par^e 1. Page 775.
seems to have been altogether of this mind. But I dare not peremptorlie
affirm any thing in a matter so secret and hid from our knowledge; (for
perhaps the remission of these venial sins preceedeth the moment of
dissolution, as I have already marked) only I maintain this conditional
Assertion, That if those sins be remitted in the instant of death, there is
no punishment inflicted for them after death. I know they will re^ly, ^^at
although these sins be pardoned, yet the whole punishment due unto them, is
reserved, and no ways discharged Suarez, in 3. Part* Th Disp. 11. de Poenit.

. But this conceat is so fond, that it needs not any refutation; for it is
repugnant to the very nature of Remission Peccatum Ventale remitti nihil aliud

, and to the ordinary conception which men have of it, (for who would say,
that the King did pardon a Traitor, if he did inflict upon him all the
punishment due unto him for his treason?) as also to that notable proportion,
which is betwixt our deliverance from sin, and from those miseries, which are
the consequents thereof. For, as I observed before, the reason wherefore men
are not fully delivered in this life from those punishments, or miseries, which
are the consequents of sin, is because they are not fully fred from sin it
self. But in death, as all do grant, the soul of a good man is fully fred
from sin: nothing remains therein, which displeases GOD; and that which
pleases GOD, to wit, inherent righteousness, is perfect in it. Hence we
justly conclude, That as it is fully fred from sin; so also is it from all
the consequents of sin; and that in respect nothing remains in it, which
may offend GOD, or provoke Him to do that which He is unwilling to do; I
mean, to punish.

This also ought to be confessed by those Popish Writers, who do teach,
concerning Inherent Grace, That it is so amiable, or lovely a quality, in the
sight of GOD, that by it self, or by its own natural force, and not for any
reference which it has to CHRIST, for whose merits it is infused, it makes
GOD to accept those in whom it is found, unto aeternall Life, as His Children,
and Heirs. Now, if this be the natural force and efficacy, or the
connaturall effect, Suarez, de great. Sanct. lib. 7. c. 12. Vide etiam cap. 5.
illiu^ lib*
(as Suarez calls it) of inherent righteousness, even when it is imperfect,
or at least when it is conjoined with original concupiscence, the relics of
vicious acquired habites, the rebellious motions of the flesh, and many
venial enormities, as they call them; what force shall it have to make GOD to
respect, to love, to affect tenderly, the soul of a man after death? and,
consequently, not to torment, and punish it, when it is fully fred from all
those vicious inclinations, and motions?

I have shown you, at great length, (and that because of the perverse opinions
of our Adversaries) That to die in the LORD, is common to all the Elect. Now I
come to that other point, which I propounded to be handled anent the same
words; that is, to show you what this phrase, To die in the LORD, (taking it
as it is common to all the Godly) imports. All those who take it so, agree
amongst themselves anent the meaning thereof; to wit, That it is To die in that
happy union which we have with CHRIST by true Faith, and other Theological
virtues.

There be four things, wherein men are said to die this bodily death,
mentioned in holy Scripture.

1. Men die in Adam. 2. Men die either in prosperity, or adversity; riches,
or poverty, or moyen ^ondition; in high honor, or in low degree; in pain,
or without pain, etc. 3. Men are said to die in their sins. 4. Men are said
to die in CHRIST.

The first of these four, is simply common to all the children of Adam, by
natural propagation.

The second is disjunctiuelie common to all.

The third befalls all who die without CHRIST.

The fourth appertains to them only who in in this Text are called blessed:
Blessed are they that die in the LORD.

The first has a diverse manner of signification, from the other three.

For, to die in Adam, signifies not only the coexistence of a man's being
in Adam, and of his dying; but also the meritorious cause of our death; to wit,
That by the sin of Adam, in whom we all sinned, and from whom we bring with
us into this world original corruption, we are all liable to death. As in
Adam all die, (as says the Apostle) even so in CHRIST shall all be made
alive. ^. Cor. 15.22.


This dying of all in Adam, is explayned by the same Apostle elsewhere, By one
man sin entered into the world, and death by sin: Romans 5.12.
and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. Whereby is
evidentlie overthrown that error of Pelagius, and his followers, who falselie
denied Death bodily to have been brought in by Sin: affirming, (as
Augustine relates) That although Adam had not sinned, Aug. haeres. 88.
yet he had died bodily death. Which Assertion, as very pernicious and
haereticall, and brought in for denying of original sin, was justly
condemned, and anathematized, in the second Milevitane Council. Council. Milev*
2. can. 1.


The other three, being understood of bodily death, do signify rather the
estate wherein a man is found when he dies. For although he who dies in his
sins, has in his sins the merit of both the first and second death, yet
when a man is said to die in his sins, is not so much poynted at the cause
of his bodily death, (being now common to all flesh) as the miserable and
doleful condition wherein death finds him, and carries him away. Which
before we explayne, let us speak a word of dying in prosperity, or
adversity, etc.

One dies (says holy Job) in his full strength, being wholly at ease, and
quiet: Job. 21.23.24.25.26.
his breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moystened with marrow. And
another dies in the bitterness of his soul, and never eats with pleasure.
They shall lie down alyke in the dust, and the worms shall cover them. Here are
two things to be observed: 1. That men are said to die in prosperity or
adversity, only in regard of their estate before they be dead; and not in
respect of any condition in and after death: for the one so dies in
prosperity, and the other in adversity temporal, as by dying, both he
leaves his prosperity, and he his adversity. 2. In regard of that transient
estate, they are made by death both aequall. They lie down alyke in the dust.
There the wicked cease from troubling: and there the weary be at rest. Job.
3.17.18.19.
There the prisoners rest together: they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
The small and great are there: and the servant is free from his master.

Mors sceptra ligonibus aequat. The third thing wherein men are said to die, is
in their sins. This befalls all the unbelievers, who die in unbelief,
according to that saying of our Savior; I said therefore unto yom, that ye
shall die in your sins. Joan. 8.24.
For if ye believe not that I am HE, ye shall die in your sins. Where is
not meaned, that they shall cease to be in their sins, or in the stayne and
guiltiness thereof, as those who dying in worldly wealth, or poverty, cease
to be in them any more: but he that dies in his sins, his bones are full
of the sin of his youth, Job. 20.11.
which shall lie down with him in the dust. Now, as Solomon says, if the tree
fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree
falls, Eccles. 11.3^
there it shall be: That is, as Saynct Hierome expounds the place, in what
estate a man dies, either in sin, Hieron. comm. in Eccles. (...).
or in righteousness, he shall for ever remain in that same estate. The
misery of such a man is descrybed in the Evangell of Saynct JOHN, with the
felicity of those who live and die in the true faith of the Son of GOD,
briefly, in these words, He that believes on the Son, has everlasting
Life: and he that believes not the Son, Joan. 3.36.
shall not see Life, but the wrath of GOD abides on him.

Therefore this Proposition, Blessed are they that die in the LORD, is
reciprocal, They die in the LORD who are blessed: meaning of mortal men, who
die this bodily death; of whom none are blessed, but only they that die in
the LORD. Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other
name under Heaven given amongst men whereby we must be saved. Act. 4.12*


To die in the LORD, signifies not, that the LORD is the cause of our death,
as Adam to them that die in Adam: but it signifies that happy estate of a
dying man, that he is in the LORD, and consequently, of the number of those
of whom the Apostle says, Romans ^.^.
There is no condemnation to those which are in CHRIST JESUS. Neither does
dying in the LORD import ceasing from being in the LORD, as they who die in
worldly wealth, or poverty, do cease to be in that estate any more: but to
die in the LORD, Ioann. 1.4. Coloss. 3.3* 1. Ioann. 5.12, 20.
signifies to die being and remaining in the LORD, before death, in death,
and after death. The LORD is our life, even aeternall Life. He then that dies
in the LORD, remains in Life, according to that saying of our Savior;
Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that hears My word, Ioann. 5.24.
and believes on Him that sent Me, has everlasting Life, and shall not come
into condemnation; but is passed from death, unto life. Death may separate our
soul from our body; but it can not break that Union which we have with
JESUS CHRIST; whose we are, whether we live or die. Romans 14.^.


I come now to a more particular consideration of this Union which we have
with CHRIST in life and death; and in respect whereof we are said here to
die in the LORD. This Union is so strange and wonderful, that it can not be
sufficiently expressed by any one kind of union; and therefore the Spirit of
GOD in the Scripture expresses it by many, and those most diverse sorts of
union, or conjunction: to wit, by the union of conformity; telling us, Vnio
conformitatis. Romans 8.29. Vnio per affectum. Joan. 15.15. Heb. 2.11. 2. Cor.
11.2. Ephesians. 5.25.27. Unto per influxum. Joan. 15.1.2 Ephesians. 1.22. Coloss. 1, 18
that we are praedestinated, to be conformed to the Image of the Son of God:
by the union of affection; yea, of most entire affection, or friendship;
telling us, that we are His Friends, Brethren, and Spouse: by the union of
influence, or real operation; telling us, that He is the Vine, and we are
the Branches; that He is the Head, and we are His Members: whereby is
signified, That as the root of the Vine, by real influence, does communicate
life, nowrishment, and growth, unto the branches; and as the head, by real
influence, or operation, does communicate sense, and motion, unto the
inferior members, and does direct them in their actions; So CHRIST, by the
seret, and most powerful influence of His Spirit, does communicate Spiritual
life, sense, motion, and growth, unto the members of His mystical body: as
also directs them in their actions; making them to walk circumspectly, and
to work out their salvation with fear and trembling. Ephesians. 5.15. Phil. 2.12.
And because things are united, or joined together, two ways, by the union of
influence; to wit, either so that they concur together, to make up one total
or composed substance, (as for example, The head and the members make up one
total substance; and so do the root and the branches) which sort of union
is called a Formal, Substantial, Unto formalis.
and Physical union: or else so that no total or composed thing is made up of
them; (so the Lodestone, and the iron which it draws to it self, are united
together) which sort of union is called vnio effectiva, an union of mere
influence, or efficiencie. Therefore our conjunction with CHRIST, Unto
effectiva.
is expressed in Scripture, sometimes by a Formal and Physical union; as when
He is called the Vine, and we the Branches; or when He is called the Head,
and we the members of His body: and sometimes by the union of mere
inftuence; as when He says, If I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw
all men unto Me: and, Lo, I am with you always, Joan. 12.32.
even unto the end of the world. Matthew. 28.20.


Now, to apply all this to the present purpose: The Godly have all these
kinds or sorts of union with CHRIST, in death, as well as in life; and
therefore they are most justly said to die in the LORD. And first, as for the
Union of Conformity, although the Learned, speaking of that conformity with
CHRIST, unto which we are praedestinated, do only mention our Conformity
with Him in Grace and Glory; yet betwixt these two, we may very well take in
another part or degree of our conformity with CHRIST; to wit, our Conformity
with Him in our death; which is the passage from Grace to Glory. For, as we
resemble Him by an holy life, so also by an happy and victorious death. This
degree of conformity, which the Godly have with CHRIST, is grounded chiefelie
upon three respects. For first, as CHRIST died voluntarily, and by way of
obedience to GOD His Fathers Commandment; so the Godly die, humbly
submitting themselves, and all their desires, unto GOD'S will. For although,
when that bitter Cup of deadly sickness is presented to a Godly man, he
sometimes say with CHRIST, Father, if it be possible, let this Cup pass from
me; Matthew. 26.39.
yet He ever does subjoyne this* Nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou will. Secondliie; As CHRIST died, to destroy the works of the Devil; ^. Joan.
3.5. and 8.
that is, to take away our sins; so the Godly desire to die, that they may
be fred from their sins, and not offend GOD any more; Judge. 16* 30.
saying with SAMPSON, Let me die with these my enemies. Thirdly, as CHRIST
died, to acquire a Kingdom to Himself Romans 14.9.
; so death is to the Godly an entrance into that kingdom which GOD has
promised to those that love Him: and every Godly man may, when he dies,
James 2.5.
say with PAVL, Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of
Righteousness. ^* Tim. 4.8*


Secondly; As for the union of Love, or Friendship, which the Godly have with
CHRIST, death can not end, or dissolve it: for Paul tells us, That nothing
is able to separate us from the love of CHRIST: Romans 8.35.
and, in the words following, boldly gives a defyance to death; affirming,
That it is not able to effectuat^ this separation. Many, yea, great and
inaesteemable benefits redound unto the Godly, by virtue of this union, in the
hour of their death. For, first, by reason of it, CHRIST JESUS, in that most
dangerous hour, pleads for them most earnestly, and effectually. Our
necessity does require this. For, when we are arreasted by Death, and are
going to be praesented before that dreadful Tribunal, where all our works
of Righteousness, yea, all our sufferings can not sufficiently plead for us;
we have more nor need, that that Blood which speaks better things than
that of Abell, Hebr. ^^.24
should plead for Mercy and favor to us. His love also, and most tender
affection, which made Him to ware, or bestow, His Blood, and His Life for us*
can not but make Him to ware His Request for vt, in that time of our great
need. He, who upon the Cross prayed for His cruel Tormentors, will,
undoubtedly, now, when He is in His Kingdom, remember His Friends, and
say, Pater, ignosce iis; Father, forgive them. He, Luke 23.^4
who in that last and most dolorous night of His ly^e, when He made, as it
were, His Legacy, and declared His latter Will to His Father, said,
concerning all the Elect, Father, I will that they also whom Thou have given
Me, be with Me, etc. He, I say, Joan. 17.^^
will particularly, for every one of them, at the hour of their death, say,
Father, it is My will, that this My Servant, whom Thou have given Me, be with
Me where I am, that he may behold that Glory which Thou have given Me.
Secondly; in respect of this Union, CHRIST does strengthen the Godly upon
their bed of languishing, Psalm. 4^.^^
and makes all their bed in their sickness: yea, He makes a Bed of inward
joye, and comfort, unto their souls, wherein they may rest, and be refreshed,
when their bodily payns are most grievous, and intolerable: For then Hse
speaks to them, by His Spirit, Words of comfort; or rather, as Peter calls
them, Words of aeternall Life. John 6.68.
He says to them, as He said to the poenitent Thief, To day shall thou be
with Me in Paradyse. Luke 23.43.
He says to them, as He said concerning Lazarus his sickness, This
sickness is not unto death; yea, This death, John 11.4.
is not unto death Hoc est ergo, quod ai^* infirmitas hac no^ est a^ morte^,
quia and ipsa no^ erat ad mortem. August. Tract 49. in Joan Genes. 46.3*
, but for the Glory of GOD, and also for your glory; that by it ye may
attain unto aeternall Glory, and Happinesse^ and as He said to Jacob, when
he was going down to Egypt, Fear not to go down to Egypt, for I will go
down with thee, and will surely bring thee up again; so says He to His
languishing and dying Servants, Fear not to go down into the dark and
silent Grave; for I will go down with you, and I also will surely bring you
up again.

These, and the like comforts, Christ Jesus, by the inward and secret language,
or testimony of His Spirit, does communicate unto many of His Servantes upon
their deathbeds* but whether or not He does communicate them unto all the
Elect, without exception, I dare not determine, as I said before. One thing I
firmlie believe; That all the Elect are, in some measure, strengthened by Him
upon the bed of languishing. I mean, upon their deathbed: yea, so
strengthened, that all the Powers of Hell can not make them to die in that
fearful sin of Desparation. For GOD, who is not deficient in things
necessary for our natural life, DEVS non deficit in necessariis.
and much less in things necessary for our spiritual estate, has give^ us
this sweet promise, I will never leave thee, Hebr. 13.5.
nor forsake thee: and consequently, deoth ever conserve in His own Children,
such a measure of Faith and Hope, as is sufficient for salvation. Thirdly; As
the Godly, in the hour of death, are bold, to commend their spirits unto
CHRIST, Luc. 23.46.
and, as it were, to breathe out their souls into His Bosom; (for this is the
last suit of a departing Saynct, LORD JESUS, receive my spirit) so He also,
Act. 7.53.
in regard of this union, grants their desire: that is, He receaveth their
spirits; He welco^meth them with this sweet Salve; Intra in gaudium DOMINI tui;
Enter into the joye of thy LORD: and He praesenteth them unto His Father,
saying; Behold, I and the Children which GOD has given me. John, I am sure,
was glad when CHRIST said to His Mother, Joan. 19.26.^7.
Behold thy Son; and to him, Behold thy Mother. How much more shall me
rejoice, when CHRIST, bringing our souls into GOD'S Chamber of Praesence,
shall say to GOD, Ecce Filii Tui, Behold thy Children; and to us, Ecce Pater
vester, Behold your Father?

The third, or last sort of union, which the Godly have with Christ, to wit,
the union of influence, or real operation; and, in special, that union,
whereby the Godly are united with Christ, as members of his mystical body,
and branches ingrafted in him, not only continues, or endures unto death,
but in death: and by virtue thereof, the spiritual life which is communicated
unto the Godly in their regeneration, and the vital operations of the same,
are so effectually, and reallie preserved, that the Godly may be said not
only to live, when they die; but also to come, by death, to a greater
perfection of their life. For the Spirit of God in the holy Scripture tells
us, that the supernatural life, which we have by grace, is an everlasting
life: as likewise, that it is but imperfect here, and shall be perfected
hereafter. John 5.24.
For here we walk by faith, and not by sight: and now (that is, in this
present life) we see through a glass, 2. Cor. 5.7.
darkly; but then (that is, 1. Cor. 13.1^. Vita nostra modo spes est, vita
nostra postea aeternitas erit* Vita vitae mortalis, spes est vita immortalis,
Enarrat. in Psalm. 103. Conc. 4.
in the life to come) we shall see God face to face. And therefore holy
Augustine says very well, that our life, which now is nothing but hope,
shall hereafter be aeternitie; and, that the life of this mortal life, is the
hope of an immortal life.

Ye have heard now, that the union, which the godly have with Christ, is not
abolished, nor yet diminished; but rather augmented, and perfected by death.
Whereby ye may learn, first, how firm and stable that union is, which we
have with Christ; seeing (as I have shown you) death it self is not able to
dissolve it. Happy are these, then, who count all things but dung, that they
may gain Christ, Philip. 3.8.
and that they may be found in him, etc. For with MARIE they have chosen that
good part, Luke 10.4^
which shall not be taken away from them. And, on the contrary, miserable and
mad fools are they, who have set their hearts upon worldly things, and are
united unto them by affection. For, first, they shall shortly be divided, or
separated from these things. Next, that separation shall procure more grief to
them, nor ever they had delight, or contentment, by enjoying these evanishing
trifles. And thirdly, which is worst of all, in that dreadful judgment,
which follows after death, they shall be condemned to everlasting torments,
for the inordinate love which they carried to them. Bernard says very
wittily, Mors peccatorum mala est in mundi amissione. pej^r in carnis
separatione, pess^^^a in ver^is ignisque duplici co^tritione. Epist. 105. ad
Romanum.
that the death of the wicked man is evil, in respect of the loss of worldly
things; worse in respect of the unhappy separation of his body from the
soul; and worst of all, because of that double torment or vexation, of the
worm, and of the fire.

Moreover, the indissolubilitie and aeternitie of that union, which the Godly
have with Christ, makes the union, which they have amongst themselves,
perpetual, and indissoluble, by death. They are lovely and pleasant in their
lives, (as David in his mourning Song said of Saul and Jonathan) and in death
they are not divided. ^. Samul 1.23.
For although some of the members of Christ's body, be called out from this
life, before others, yet they remain still united to one head; and,
consequently, are still united amongst themselves: and albeit they be locallie
separated for a time, yet they shall shortly meet together in their Fathers
house; and shall joyfullie sing for ever that Song of DAVID, Behold how good
and how pleasant a thing it is, for Brethren to dwell together in unity! Ye,
Psalm. 133.1.
then, who are united unto Christ, by a true and lyuelie faith, be careful by
your godly admonitions, and good example, to make these, whom ye tenderly
affect, to be participant of the same union: Fot if ye effectuate this,
neither death, nor judgment, nor any other thing, shall divide you. But if it
be otherwise, death, and that judgment which follows thereafter, shall so
divide you, that ye shall never have a joyful meeting together again. For
when Christ shall come to judge the world, two women shall be grinding
together; the one shall be taken, Luke 17.34 35.36.
and the other left: two men shall be in the field together; the one shall be
taken, and the other left: yea, of two which shall be in one bed; one shall be
taken, and the other left. But what if they be both left, and condemned to Hell
fire, shall they have any comfortable society, or fellowship together? No.
For as in Hell there is fire, without light; night, without rest; and death,
without an end; so there is company, without comfort: yea, those who were
companions in sin, when they meet together there, they salute each other with
mutual execrations, and curse the day that ever they saw other.

Secondly, consider for your use, how sweet an effect this our union with
Christ produces, seeing by virtue of it we spirituallie live, both in death,
and after death. If life be so sweet, as we commonly say; and if this mortal,
yea, this mome^tanie life, be so much esteemed by us, as that a man will give
skin for skin, Job 2.4.
and all that he has, for his life, how much should we esteem and affect this
spiritual life, and that blessed union with Christ, by virtue whereof it is
begun, and also conserved in us unto all aeternitie? HORMISDAS the Persian, as
I show you before, thought little of all the glory and stateliness of Rome;
and that because he perceaved, that men were mortal there, as well as in other
cities of the world. O, but if GOD had given him grace to enter by faith into
that heavenly Jerusalem, the City of the living God; Heb. 1^.^^
and if the eyes of his understanding had been enlightened, that he might have
known what is the hope of our calling, Ephesians. 1.1^
and the riches of the glory of GODS inheritance in the Saints; that is, if
he had known, that GOD, the Father of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, according to his
abundant mercy, has begotten all these who are true^lie and indeed citizens
of this City, in spem vivam; unto a lyuelie hope, (that is, in spem vitae*
unto the hope of life, as Jerome expounds it; or in spem vitae aetern^, unto
the hope of aeternall life, Lib. 1. contra Iovinianum
as Augustine reads it) and to an inheritance incorruptible, Lib. 1. de
peccatorum meritis, and remiss. cap. 27.
and undefiled, and which fades not away, reserved in Heaven for us: if he, I
say, had known this singular praerogatiue of the citizens of heavenly
Jerusalem, he would have thought the glory of Rome, and of all other cities
in the world, to be baseness, in comparison of it: and would have said with
DAVID, Glorious things are spoken of thee, O City of GOD: or as he says in
another place, Psalm. 87.3.
Mount Sion is beautiful for situation, and the joye of the whole earth. Psalm.
48.2.


Thirdly, observe, I pray you, how sweet and comfortable a thing it is to the
Godly, in the hour of death, to consider, that they are in Christ, and that
the union, which they have with Christ, is perpetual, and indissoluble. How
comfortablie and joyfullie may the faithful servant of Christ then say, There
is no condemnation to them which are in Christ: I am now dying, Romans 8.1.
nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: Gal. 2.20.
in Christ my Savior I have boldness and access unto the Throne of Grace,
with confidence by the faith of him. Ephesians. 3.12
O how excellent and happy a thing it is to a man then to have (...),
boldness with God to speak what he pleases, and to propound all his suits;
to say, Lord, strengthen me against all my infirmities, and my fears; perfect
thy strength in my weakness; ^. Cor. 12.9
put an end to all my miseries, and my pains; Psalm. 143.2.
and enter not into judgment with thy servant; LORD, Psalm. 23.4.
walk with me in this valley of the shadow of death, that I may fear no
evil; Father, I comend my spirit into thy hands; Hear me speedily, O Lord,
Luke 23.46
my spirit fails: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that
go down into the pit. Psalm. 143.7.
The wicked cannot have this (...), this boldness of speaking to God, when
death approaches. They shall then find how true that saying of our Savior
is, Sine me nihil potestis facere; Without me ye can do nothing. John 15.5.
For they may well in that hour cry, Miserere, with their lips, and say, Lord,
let thy servant depart in peace; but their heart shall contradict them, and
tell them, that there is no peace to the wicked. Isai. 57.21.


I come now to the consideration of that blessedness, or happiness, which is
here attributed to these who die in the Lord: in the handling whereof, I intend
not to fall out in a Theological discourse, concerning that most noble and
divine operation of our soul, wherein our Summum bonu^ consists: I mean,
the vision and fruition of the glorious countenance of GOD: nor yet to trouble
you, and my self both, with the debating and discussing of these quaestions,
which are too curiously agitated, and too boldly determined by many Divines
anent it. I shall only show you what is, and has been holden, as certain,
and undoubtedly true, by the greatest part of Christians, and what is called
in quaestion by judicious and orthodoxe Divines, concerning the estate of the
Godly after this life.

First, then, it is certain, that these, who die in the Lord, shall in the day
of resurrection, and judgment, attain to perfect, and consummate happiness
of soul and body: for in that day, the Lord, the righteous Judge, 2. Tim. 4.^.
shall give the crown of righteousness unto all these, who love his appearing.

Secondly, the greatest part of Christians, have ever believed, that the
blessedness, which we shall then attain unto, consists in the vision and
fruition of the glorious essence of GOD, which the Schoolmen call visionem
DEI per essentiam. This is evidentlie revealed unto us in diverse places of
Scripture. For our Savior promises this, as a reward to the pure in heart,
Matthew. 5.8.
that they shall see God. And Paul tells us, that this vision of God shall be
a clear, immediate, and intuitiue sight of his essence. For he says, that we
who now see God through a glass, darkly, 1 Cor. 13.12
shall then see him face to face. And Saint John likewise says, that when he
shall appear, we shall see him as he is. 1. John 3.2.
This also has been constantly believed by the Fathers of the Ancient Church:
for none of them ever denied this, except some few Greek Fathers, ^omil. 14.
in Iohann. and ^omil. 3. de ^^comprae^ensibil^ Dei ^atura.
following Chrysostom, who in diverse places of his works affirms, that God
his infinite essence can not be seen by any created or finite understanding.

Thirdly, as for the estate of the souls of men, during that time, which
interveaneth betwixt death and judgment, although some have most fondly and
absurdlie believed, that the soul perishes with the body; and, that both
soul and body shall be raised up together, at the day of judgment; This
opinion ^s maintai^ed by An^baptists, and was of old maintained ^y those
^aeretickes whom Au^ustine cal^eth Arabi^s, in his ^ooke De ^aresibus, ad Quod
Val^^eum, ha^es. 83. ^att. 10.28
and others no less foolishlie have imagined, that the soul, after it is
separated from the body, has no operation, nor knowledge of its own estate;
but lies, as it were, in a dead sleep^* until the day of judgment; for the
which cause they are called Psychopannychitae: nevertheless the Spirit of God,
in the holy Scripture, tells us, that these who kill the body, can not kill
the soul; and consequently, that the soul lives, when the body is killed:
that in the heavenly Jerusalem there are not only Angels, Heb. 12.23.
but also the spirits of just men made perfect; that the Godly, when they are
dissolved, are with Christ, and in Paradyse. Likewise, Philip. 1.23
that they are not there sleeping, Luke 23.43
but have use of their understanding, we may clearlie see by the parable of
Dives and Lazarus, by the Story of Christ's transfiguration, in the which we
read, Revel. 6.9.
that Moses and Eliah talked with Christ; and by that which we read concerning
the souls of Martyrs, crying under the Altar, for acceleration of the
punishment of their persecutions. Herefore the Fathers constantly taught, that
the souls of men, when they are separated from their bodies, do remember of
the things which they did upon earth Plenissim^ docu^t Dominus no^ solum
perseverare animas, sed et meminisse operu^^ quae egerunt hic. Iren. lib. 2.
contra haereses, cap. 62.
: and that those of them who are glorified in Heaven, are sure of their own
happiness, and solicit, or careful, for the weal of the Church militant;
and, in particular, are myndfull of their parents, children, brethren, and
other friends, whom they have left behind them on earth; longing to see them in
that place of glory, where they themselves are. Magnus ^^lic charorum numerus
no^ exspectat, parentu^, fratrum, fili^^u^, frequens (...) and copiosae turba
desiderat, jam de sua immortalitate secura, and adhuc de nostra salute
sollicita. Ciprian. sermon* de mortalitate, in fin^*
Yea, even these of the Fathers, who believed, that the departed souls of
godly men, are not fully glorified as yet; and, that they shall not attain to
the perfection of that happiness, whereof they are capable, before the day of
Judgment; thought not that they are sleeping, and senseless, during the time
of their separation from their bodies; but, on the contrary, thought, that
they are in Abraham's bosom, in a state of refreshment, and joye. See
concerning this, Tertull, in his book De Anima, cap. 58. Chrysostom, writing
upon the Epistle to the Philip. sermon. 3. August. lib 20. de Civit. D^^, cap 9.
and 13 For he also believed, that the souls of the Godly attain not unto the
perfection o^ that happiness, whereof they in themselves are capable, before
the day of the g^^nerall judgment; as we may easily perceive by his 12 book
De Genesi, cap. 35 where he affirms, that the soul separated from the body,
sees not God, as the Angels see him. Yea, sometime he was of that opinion,
which many other of the Fathers did hold, concerning the place where the
souls of the Saints departed are now: to wit, that they are kept in secret
and subterranean places, until the Day of Judgment. Lib. 12. De Civit. DEI,
Cap. 9. and enarra^. in Psalm. 36. Conc. 1. But he seems to have left this
opinion, afterward as appears by his 20 Book, De Civit. Dei, Cap. 15.


Fourthlie; although some few of the Ancients taught, that the souls of the
Saints departed, are not as yet rewarded, but kept in one place, and in one
estate, and condition, with the wicked, not being as yet so much as assured of
that glory, which shall be revealed in them; Nec tamen quisqua^ pucet animas
post motem protin^^ judicari; omne^ in una communique custodia deti^^ntur
do^^c, (...). Lacta^^. Lib. 7. divinaru^ institu^. c. 21. Philip 1^23 2. Cor.
5.^.
yet the common opinion of the Church of God, in all ages, has been, that they
are in an happy and blessed estate, and with unspeakable joye do exspect the
accomplishment of their happiness: yea, many of them affirm, that they are
with Christ, that they reygne with him, and, that they, in some sort, see Gods
face. This is also clearly revealed in Scripture; for Paul wishes to be
dissolved, and to be with Christ; and tells us, that when we are absent from
the body, we are present with the Lord. Christ also said to the poenitent
Thief, To day shall thou be with me in Paradyse: and here a voice from
Heaven proclaymeth the happiness of the dead, who die in the LORD.

This truth so manif^stlie revealed in the Scripture, although, as I have
said, it has been constantly professed in the Church, yet it has been
vitiated, or corrupted, by the admixtion of two erroneous doctrines. For,
first, although none before holy Augustine did talk of such a
Purgatorie-fyre, as our Adversaries do maintain, yet some Fathers, who lived
in the third and fourth age of the Church, to wit, Origin, Lactantius, Hilarie,
Ambrose, Ruffinus, and Jerome, believed, that there shall be a general
Purgatione of all souls, by fire, at the day of Judgment; and, that none shall
be free of it, (except Christ, who is the Righteousness of GOD Ambros.
enarrat. in Psalm. 118. octonar. 20. verse. 153. ideo unus igne^ illum sentire
non potuit qui est justitia Dei Christus, quia peccatum non fecit.
) no, not the blessed and glorious Virgin Marie. Hilar. enarrat. in Psalm. 118.
octonar. 3. verse 20. A^ cum ex omni ocioso verbo ratione^ (...) praestituri,
diem judicii concupisc^^^s, in quo nobis est ille indefessus iguis ob^undus, in
quo subeu^d^ sunt gravi^ illa expiand^ a peccatis animae suppliciae? -- si in
judicii severitate^ capax illa Dei virgo ve^tura est desiderare quis audebit a
DEO judicari?
This opinion is not now mantayned by any: at least, it does not trouble the
peace of the Church; and therefore I will not meddle with it. Secondly, since
the 400 year of our Lord, (about which time Augustine flowrished) some Fathers
have mentioned, and expressed in their works, a sort of purgation by fire,
very far different from the former. For they thought, that all the Elect do
not undergo this Purgation by fire; but only they, who die in some kind of
guiltiness; and, that these begin to be purged immediately after their
departure. Saynct Augustine spoke doubtfullie of this sort of Purgation Lib.
21. De Civitate DEI, Cap. 26. in Enchiridio, Cap. 69. and Lib. De Fide and
Operibus, Cap. 16.
. Gregory the Great did hold it as a thing certain Lib. 4. Dialog. Cap. 3^.
and in Psalm. 3. p^^nitent.
: but he knew no matter, or cause, of this Purgation, except the guiltiness
of these smaller sins, which are called venial: for he dreamed not of that
imperfect remission of mortal sins committed after Baptism, which Papists
do now hold, as a main ground of their doctrine concerning Purgatory. But I
have already confuted this fond conceat, and have shown, that poenitentiall
remission of sins committed after Baptism, is no less perfect, and
absolute, than baptismal remission. It is true indeed, these who after
Baptism, or after their first justification, do fall back, into grievous
sins, have not so easy access unto the Throne of Grace, for obtaining
Mercy, as they had before, (which, I think, moved the Ancient Church, to
enjoyne such hard penance to these, who after they were baptized, fell into
great sins) as also, because of their ingratitude for bygone favoures, and
benefits, they are oft-tymes (I will not say always) punished, or chastised,
with greater, and more fearful judgementes; even after they are reconciled to
God by repentance. But this will never prove such a reservation of temporal
punishment to be inflicted in Purgatory, in case of not satisfaction by
poenall exercyses in this life, as our Adversaries do maintain.

Fiftlie, it is certain, that the glory and happiness, which the dead, who
have died in the Lord, shall have after the general judgment, shall be greater
extensive, in extention, nor it is now; and that because it shall be extended,
or communicated, to their bodies also. But whether or not it shall be intensive
greater, after the general judgment; that is, whether any farther degree of
glory shall be then given to their souls, it is not so certain. For many of
the Ancients Chrysostom. Homil. 39. in 1. Cor. and Homil. 28. in Epist. ad Hebr.
Ambros. lib. 2. de Cain and Abel, Cap. 2. and Lib. de bono mortis* Cap. 10. and
11. August. Epist. 111. ad Fortunatianum: and Lib. 12. de Genesi, Cap. 35.
Bernard in se^to omnium Sanctoru^, Sermon. 2.3. and 4.
, and some judicious and orthodoxe Divines Calvin. lib. 3. Institut. Cap. 25..
6 Spalat. lib. 5 de Repub. Eccl, Cap. 8. number. 75. and sequent.
, do think, that although they are now with Christ, in the company or
fellowship of the blessed Angels, and in an estate of unspeakable joye; yet
they have not attained, as yet, unto that consummate, and accomplished
happiness, which consists in the vision, or immediate sight of God's
glorious essence: and which the Schoolmen call beatitudinem essentialem,
essential happiness: or if they have attained unto it, yet they have not
attained to the perfection, or the fullness of that joyful and blessed sight,
which they shall have hereafter. Others boldly affirm, that they have
already gotten a full sight of God's glorious essence; and, that nothing is
wanting to their happiness, but the glorification of their bodies. For my
part, although I incline most to the first opinion, esteeming it more probable,
in respect of the consent of Antiquity, and of diverse places in Scripture,
which seem to favor it; (for we read in Scripture, that we shall be
satisfied with the likeness of God, when we awake; that is, Psalm. 17.15.
in the day of our resurrection; that the laborers shall be called together
in the evening; that is, Matthew. 20.8
at the end of the world, and shall then receive their hyre, that the Crown
of Righteousness shall be given that day to all these who love the Lord's
appearing; and, 2. Tim. 4.8.
that when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, and shall see Him as He
is) yet, I think, 1. John 3.2
they are wysest, who suspende their judgment, and are not bold to determine
any thing in such matters as are not clearlie revealed in God's word; of which
sort this whereof I am now speaking, is one. Judicious and learned Calvine,
Ibidem.
who also inclined more to the first opinion, condemns their foolish
rashness, who prye too narrowly into this secret; and wills us, to be
content with these bounds, or limits, of our knowledge, concerning this
matter, which are praescribed in Scripture. And, truly, it is sufficient for
our comfort, and encowragement against Death; as also for that Christian, and
cowragious desire of death, which we ought to have; it is, I say, sufficient to
know, that it is an estate of such heavenly glory, and such joyful
happiness, that all worldly happiness, or contentment, is but misery, in
respect of it. That ye may the better conceive this, consider, I pray you,
that if we think it a delightsome, and joyful thing, to dwell in a stately
and glorious Palace, with these whom we love best, and whose company is most
pleasant unto us; it must be a thing exceedingly far more happy, and
joyful, to live in that heavenly Palace, whereof we now see nothing but
the pauement; yea, nothing but the inferior superfice of it* and yet we see
more glorious statelines in it, than in all other parts of the world. For in
it do shine those glorious Lights, which enlighten and beautify the whole
world; and which made DAVID to say, Lord, what is man, that thou art myndfull
of him? Psalm. 8.4.
and the son of man, that thou visitest him? It must be a most delightful
thing, and a matter of exceeding great joye, to dwell in that celestial
Paradyse, with an innumerable company of Angels; with all our pious friends,
who have gone before us, and who shall follow after us; with the Prophets,
Patriarchs, Apostles, Martyrs, and other famous Worthies, whose virtues are so
much praised, and admired on earth; and with our great LORD and Master, our
kind Savior, CHRIST JESUS, who loved us, Gal. 2.20.
and gave Himself for us. What joye, I pray you, shall we have there, in
beholding Him, who died, and suffered so many things for us? How shall we be
affected, and ravished in mind, when we shall view His glorious Head, which
was one day crowned with Thorns for us; His Hands and Feet, which were one
day pierced with nails for us; and His side, which was run through with a
Spear for us? But, above all, if we shall then be admitted to the clear, and
immediate fight of God's infinite essence, (which, truly, is very probable)
what admirable, unspeakable, yea, inconceauable delight, and contentment, shall
that sight work in us, although it be not so full, and perfect, as it shall
be after the general judgment? How joyfullie shall we then say with DAVID,
Psalm. ^4.10.
A day in thy Courts, is better than a thousand: or, as he says in another
place, As we have heard, Psalm. 48.8.
so have we seen in the City of the LORD of Hosts: or rather, as the Queen
of Sheba said, 1. king. 10.7
Behold, the half was not told us: the glorious honor of thy Majesty
infinitely exceeds the same which we heard. Psalm. 145.5.


This doctrine, concerning the felicity, unto which the Godly do attain,
when their souls are separated from their bodies, affords many profitable
lessons, and uses unto us. For, first, we may justly collect from it, that
although the Godly be many ways blessed, or happy, while they live here;
to wit* in respect of that inaesteemable benefit of the remission of their
sins Psalm. 32.1.2.
, in respect of these supernatural virtues, wherewith they are endewed, and of
the operations, or actions of the same Psalm. 1.1.112.1.^19.1.
, in respect of God's Fatherly providence, and care which he has of them
Psalm. 144.15.
; yea, even in respect of his chastisementes, and of their manyfolde
sufferinges Psalm. 94.12. Matthew. 5.10 11.12.
: yet this their happiness, is nothing in comparison of that exceeding great
reward Genes. 15.1.
, or of that far more exceeding and aeternall weight of glory 2. Cor. 4.17.
, which they get after this life. Glorious things indeed are spoken of the
City of GOD; that is, of the Church militant. The estate of these, who truly
and indeed are Citizens of it, is an estate of happiness; but of such
happiness, as consists in sorrowing, or mourning for their sins, and
manyfolde infirmities Matthew. 5.4.
. It is an estate of righteousness; but of such righteousness, as stands
rather in the remission of sins, nor in the perfection of virtues; and unto
the perfection whereof is necessarily required a true acknowledgement, and a
humble confession of its imperfection, as saynct Augustine piouslie, and
judiciouslie says Lib. 19. de Civit. De^, cap. 27. and lib. 3. contra duas
Epistolas Pelagianorum, cap. 7.
. It is an estate of peace; but of such peace, as is praeserved by mayntayning
a continual, and most dangerous warfare, against the Devil, the world, and
the flesh. It is an estate of joye; but of such joye, as is not only mixed
with sorrow; but even grounded upon their sorrows, and tears. August. lib de
vera and falsa poenitentia, c. 13. Ta^diu enim gaudeat and speret homo de
gratia, quamdiu sustentatur a poenitentia. Et infra: Hinc semper doleat, and d^
dolor^ gaudea^.
For when they get grace to sorrow, they have reason to rejoice, and praise God
for it. But, alace, when they look to the measure of their sorrow, they find
a new reason, or cause of sorrow, because they can not sorrow so much, and so
constantly, as they ought. Idem ibid. Et non satis sit quod doleat, sed e^
fide doleat, and non semper doluisse doleat.
In a word, then, if we shall look to the manifold sorrows, fears, dangers,
and sinful infirmities, unto which the Godly are subject in this life; and,
on the other part, to that plenarie, or full deliverance, from all these evils,
which they obtain by death, we shall find, that we have more than reason,
to say with Solon, and in the words of the Poet, although not according to
their sense; dicique beatus Ante obitum nemo, supremaque funera debet. that is,
No man can be called perfectly happy, or fully blessed, so long as he
lives in this valley of tears.

Secondly, this doctrine shows you, that the Godly have no occasion to
fear death; but, rather, ought to desire, and wish for it. The true Christian
may not only meet approaching death, with cowrage, and say, O death, where is
thy sting? O Grave, where is thy victory? 1. Cor. 15.55.
; but also with joye, and say, How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet
of him that brings good tydinges? Isai. 52.7.
Thou art come to tell me the best, and most joyful news, that ever I heard.
For thou art come to tell me* that my warfare is accomplished; and, that I
shall now enter into peace, that my sorrowful seed-tyme is ended; Isai. 57.2.
and, that my joyful harvest is at hand. Psalm. 126* 5.
Thou art come to bring me home to my Father's house, to take my cross from
my sholders, and to put my Crown upon my head. If the Godly have such reason
to welcome death cheerfully when it comes, ought they not to desire, and
long for it, before it come? Cyprian, Chrysostom, and Ambrose, do most
excellently, and eloquently, urge this poynct Cyprian. tom. 2. lib. d^
mortalit. Chrysostom. in epist. ad Plilipp. sermon. 4. Ambros. lib. de bono mortis,
cap. 12.
: and Paul tells us, that all the Godly have a longing, or desire, yea, a
vehement desire, of that glory and happiness, which is begun immediately
after death, and shall be consummated in the day of the Resurrection. Yet all
the Godly have not this vehement desire in a like manner, and measure: for
some of them have desiderium mortis plenum and absolutum, a plenarie and
absolute desire; or, a desire not opposed, or impeded by any other desire.
Such a desire of death, I think, was in old Simeon, when he had gotten
CHRIST in his arms, and said, Nunc dimittis. For the only thing which
detayned him in this life, or made him willing to be detayned in it, was the
desire he had to see Christ Veniebat ille. ^. Christus* ille, s. Simeo^ ibat:
sed donec ille veniret, ille ^re nolebat, Ia^ senectu^ matura excludebat, sed
sincera pietas dotinabat. August. sermon. 3. de verbis Apostoli.
: and, therefore, having gotten his desire, he was most willing to depart Vide
^ustum, velut corporea carcere molis inclusum, velle d^ssolvi ut esset cum
Christo. Ambros. lib. 2. in Lucam.
. Some again of them have desiderium mortis ligatum and impeditum, a vehement
desire of death, but opposed, impeded, and as it were, bound up by another
spiritual desire. Such a desire had Paul, when he said, I am in a strayt
betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ, which is far
better. Nevertheless, to abide in the flesh, is more needful for you Philip.
1.23. Psalm. 39.13. Job 10.20.21.
. So also many of God's dear Servantes, although they have withdrawn their
hearts from the world, and long to be with CHRIST; yet in respect they have
not, as yet, attained to such assurance of remission of their sins, as they
would; therefore they wish with David, that GOD would spare them; to the effect
they may recover strength before they go hence, and be no more: or, as Job
says, that they may take comfort a little before they go, whence they shall
not return. Last of all, there are some of the Godly, who although they
labor earnestly, to get their affection on things above, yet they find, to
their exceeding great grief, that they are still so affected with the love of
this life, and the things which they enjoye here, that they can not attain
to that vehement longing for a better life, that cowragious and Heroicke desire
of death, which other Godly men and women have. Nevertheless, seeing Paul
generally affirms, that all they who have received the first fruits of the
Spirit, Romans 8.23.
groan within themselves, waiting for the accomplishment of their adoption,
and willing to be absent from the body, 2. Cor. 5.8.
that they may be present with the LORD, we may very well say, that even
they have vehemens desiderium mortis, and coelestis beatitudinis. For although
they have it not actuallie, yet they have it in voto and conatu* by way of
earnest desire, and careful stryving to attain to it.

Thirdly, seeing these only are blessed after death, who die in the Lord, it
follows manifestly, that woeful, miserable, and lamentable, is the estate of
the greatest part of the world after death: I mean, of the wicked, who live
not in the Lord; and, consequently, can not die in the Lord. Death, which is
to all a change, and, to the Godly, a blessed change, shall be to them a
doleful, and unhappy change. For the terminus ad quem of their change, or the
estate unto which they shall be changed, is an estate of remediless misery,
easelesse pain, and endless death. This their case, may justly seem the
more miserable, if we shall consider also the the terminus a quo of their
change: that is, if we shall look to the temporal, or worldly estate and
condition, from which they shall be changed. For some of them are acting a
Tragoedie upon the Stage of this world; that is, they spend all their days
in poverty, dishonor, and many other miseries. To these death is a change
from the miseries of this world, to miseries incomparably greater in another
world: and, therefore, their estate, and condition in this life, is called by
BERNARD, In his Book of Sentences, if that Book be his.
via aerumnosa ad mortem, a miserable and sorrowful way unto aeternall death.
Others of them are acting a Comedy upon the same stage* but such a Comedy, as
shall end in a woeful Tragedy: that is, they live in wealth, honor, and
abundance of worldly delights. To them death is a change from the momentanie
pleasures of this world, to everlasting torments, and sorrows, in the world
to come. And their estate, or condition in this life* is called by BERNARD, via
deliciosa ad morte^, a delightsome way unto death. To these two estates of
wicked men in this life, BERNARD adds a third; to wit, the estate or
condition of these who have abundance of worldly things, and yet not being
contented therewith, do continually vex themselves with anxious care, and
paynfull labor, in acquiring more wealth: so that these riches which they
have, perish by evil travel, and all their days they eat in darkness;
Eecles. 5.14.17.
that is, with much sorrow, and wrath. This estate, or condition of wicked men
in this life, is called by SOLOMON, a sore evil; and by BERNARD, via laboriosa
ad mortem; a paynfull, and wretched way unto death. In a word the^, whatsoever
be the temporal estate of wicked men in this life, death is to them an unhappy
change; even in respect of the terminus a quo of their change. For, to some of
them, it is both a change, and an end of their joys: to others, it is a
change, but not an end of their sorrows; and a mean whereby they are
infinitely multiplied, and increased.

Last of all, ye see here, how wise a choice they make, who with MOSES, choose
rather to suffer affliction with the Children of GOD, having respect unto the
recompense of reward, Hebr. 11.25.26.
than to enjoye the pleasures of sin, which last but for a season: and
therefore are called by Bernard, Ibidem.
mome^taneae dulcedines and horariae suavitates: that is, such delights, such
sweetness of earthly objects, as last but for an hour; yea, but for a moment.
The estate of the Godly in this life, seems, to our corrupt reason, a
troublesome, and melancholious estate. For when they enter into this estate,
they must put on the mourning weed of repentance, and never put it off while
they live: they must put on the whole Armor of GOD, and never put it off,
until their Wynding-sheet be put upon them. They must, perhaps, put on Lazarus
his rags, and never put them off, until they die upon a Dunghill, or by a
dyke side. Nevertheless, our estate, is an estate of joye unspeakable, 1. Pet.
^.8.
and full of glory. And although it were not, yet the joye which is set before
us, Psalm. 4.7. Heb. 12.2.
might make us, yea, should make us, gladly to undergo it, and all the
vexations, troubles, and griefs, which accompany the same. All these who have
gone before us to Heaven, have entered into that Kingdom through much
tribulatione: Act. 14.22.
yea, it behoved Christ Jesus himself first to suffer, Luke 24.26
and then to enter into his Glory. And therefore, if any of you be unwilling
to take up his cross, in hope of this glory, I will say to him, as JEROME
said to HELIODORUS, Delicatus es, frater, si and hic vis gaudere cum mundo,
Epist. 1. ad Heliodorum
and postea regnare cum Christ^: Thou art too delicate, my brother, if thou
would both rejoice here with the world, and also reygne hereafter with
Christ. And, as he says in the words following, so say I to every one of
you, That day shall come, 1. Cor. 15.53.
in the which this corrubtible, and mortal, shall put on incorruption, and
immortality. Blessed shall the servant be, Luke 12.37
whom his Lord shall then find watching. If he find thee so, the earth, with
the people which are in it, shall shake, and tremble, at the voice of the
Trumpet; but thou shall rejoice. When the Lord shall come to Judgment, the
world shall sadly roar and groan -- foolish Plato, with his scholars,
shall then be arraygned: Aristotle his arguments that day shall avayle him
nothing. Then thou, although thou be a poor clown, shall rejoice, and laugh,
and say, Behold my God, who was crucified: behold the Judge of the world,
who one day cried as a newborn Child, being wrapped in swedling clowts, and
laid in a manger. This is He, who was the son of a Crafts-man, and of a
work-woman. This is He, who being God, fled from the face of man into Egypt,
carried upon his mothers breast. This is He, whom the soldiers, by way of
derision, clothed with Purple, and crowned with Thorns, etc. Iudicaturo
Domino, lugubre mundu^ immugiet. -- adducetur cu^ suis stultus Plato
discipulis: Aristotelis argumenta non proderunt. Tunc tu rusticanus and pauper
exult^bis, and ridebis, and dices; Ecce crucisixus DEVS meus; ecco Iudex qui
obvolutus pannis in praesepio vagiit. Hic est ille operarit and quaestuariae
Fili^^s: hic qui matris gestatus sinu, hominem DEVS fugit in Aegyptum: hic

Having gone through my Text, I now apply my self, and my Text both, to this
present Text, which lies before us: I mean, the dead half of our late most
worthy, and Reverend, and now most blessed Praelate, whom death has not
destroyed, but divided into two halfs, or parts; his one half, his living, and
better half, is now in suo elemento, in its own element; in terra viventium,
in the land of the living; that is, in that land where death has no place S.
August. in the explication of the 27. psalm. verse. 13. calls Heaven terra^
viventium, and this earth, terrae^ morientium.
. His other half is, as ye see, seized upon by death. But I may justly say
to death, which has seized upon it, as Bernard said in a Funeral Sermon upon
Humbert the devote Monk; O mors, crudelis best^a, amaritudo amarissima, foetor
and horror filiorum Adam, quid fecisti? occidisti, possedisti. quid? curnem
^tique sola^, animae enim no^ habes quod facias. Bern. sermon, in obitu Humberti
devoti monachi.
O death, thou cruel beast, thou most bitter bitterness, the stinch and
horror of the sons of Adam; what have thou done? thou have killed, thou have
possessed. But what? truly nothing, but his flesh, or his body. And this was
dead, before it was dead: for Paul says, the body is dead, because of sin;
to wit, through infirmities, sickness, and troubles; and in respect it is by a
judicial sentence, nigh 6000 years since, condemned to die. The most, then, O
death, which thou have done, is this; thou have put a dead body out of pain;
a body condemned to die, out of fear of death; and this is a vantage: for the
fear of death, is worse than death: Morsque minus poenae, quam mora mortis
habet. Well then, thou have gotten little, thou have little: and therefore, as
Christ says, that from him who has little, even that which he has, shall
be taken: So say I to thee, and Bernard in that same place said it before
me; even that same body which thou seem to have, shall be taken from thee
Sed and ipsum corpus quod videris habere, anferetur a te. Ibidem.
.

This body was the receptacle ingentis and generosi animi, of a great and
generous mind. It was hospitium, the lodging house of a mighty, and most
active spirit. But what a lodging house? It was ever hospitiu^ exile, a slender
lodging house; but within these few years it was also inco^modum and ruinosum
hospitium, an incommodious and ruinous lodging: and, to use Plautus his phrase,
In Trinum* 2.4.
it was hospitium calamitatis; for many bodily infirmities, and diseases
lodged in it. And now at last it is to us docume^tum mortalitatis, a document
of our common mortality: or, to use your own ordinary phrase, it is to us a
memento mori; yea, a memento mori in Domino; a memento not only of dying, but
also of dying as he died, that is, in the Lord. This can not be so well
declared unto you, as by showing you, that he lived in the Lord: and, that he
lived so, I can not demonstrate, but I must fall out into his justly deserved
praises; or rather, into the praises of Gods bounty, and liberality toward
him. For (as Gregory Nazianzen reasoned concerning Athanasius his praises) to
praise him, it is to praise virtue; and to praise virtue, it is to praise God,
who is the author and giver of it (...). Orat. 21. in laudem Athanasit.
. I say, that to praise him, is to praise virtue; because, (as Nazianzen there
says of Athanasius) many rare virtues, both moral, and spiritual, were
collected, and united together in him. Think not that I speak hyperbolicallie:
for I dare affirm, that there was as great a variety of God's graces in him,
as in any Laicke or Clergie-man of this Kingdom. These who knew him well,
do acknowledge this; and these who do not acknowledge it, never knew him. I
will not enumer all his virtues, and laudable carriages: but omitting that
which I might speak of his admirable wisdom, his singular learning His
judicious and accurat Treatises concerning the visibilitie of the Church, and
the lawfulness of our calling to the Ministry: as also his excellent
Comme^tary upon the book of the Revelation, shall bear witness of it to the end
of the world.
, his most quick apprehension, and conceaving of whatsoever purposes, his
solid, or stayed judgment, his mellifluous eloquence, his wonderful
activitie, his generous, and noble, or rather heroicke disposition: so that I
may justly say of him, as Nazianze^ said of Athanasius, he did imitate the
nature both of the Adamant, in respect no unjust opposition, how violent
soever, could break him; and of the Magnes, or lodestone, because of the
attractiue virtue of his pithie and convincing speeches; as also of his
gracious, prudent, and amiable carriage, whereby he was able to draw even the
most refractarie spirits, to the aequitie, or truth, which he did maintain;
omitting, I say, all these things, I will only touch one thing, which is
chiefelie to be looked unto in one of that place; to wit, that he was an
accomplished Prelate, and a most worthy Governor of the Church. Gregory
Nazianzen excellently declares, Orat. 1. Apol. pro fuga,
how hard a thing it is, to be a Ruler in God's House; and that in three
respects: First, because a Bishop must be a man of singular holiness: and he
must not think it anough, not to be evil; but he must excel in virtue.
For, as it is the fault of a private man, not to be good; so it is the fault
of a Prelate, not to excel others in goodness. (...). 2. Tim. 2.15
Secondly, he must preach powerfullie, and prudentlie, dividing the word
aright, which (as this Father there says) is not a thing incident to a small
or base spirit. (...).
For it requires a mind endewed with variety of graces, and applyable to
every sort of Auditors. (...).
Thirdly, he must be a wise and active Governor: and this, says he, is
the Art of Arts, and the Science of Sciences, to govern men, and direct them
in matters of Salvation; which he declares, by comparing Pastors to
Physicians; and prosecuteth that comparison at great length.

These three properties, or qualities do make up an accomplished Prelate: and
I think, ye who hear me, will confess with me, that he had them all in a
great measure; and in such perfection, that very few in this Kingdom did
aequall him in any one of them. For, first, his singular piety kythed in
this, that although he was an Honorable Baron, and of great respect in this
Country, yet he was so taken, yea, so ravished, even in the days of his
youth, with the love of GOD'S Word, and the care which he had of saving
souls, and of the propagation of the Gospel; that renouncing all other
delights, and exercyses, unto which men of his quality do wholly give
themselves, he desired one thing of the Lord, and still did seek after it:
Psalm. 27.4.
to wit, that he might dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of his
life; and that not only to behold the beauty of the LORD, but also to make
others behold it, and to make their hearts enamoured therewith. Secondly, as
piety shyned in his life like lightning, so it thundered in his Sermons.
Nazianzen said this of Saynct Basil, Tom. 2. Carmine. 64.
(...).
Sermo tuus tonitru, vitaque fulgur erat.
And it may justly be applied to him: For, how learned, how pertinent, how
plausible, and how powerful a Preacher he was, I appeal to all your
memories, who often times heard him with delight, and admiration, to your
singular comfort, and benefit. Thirdly, as for his prudencie, and fidelity,
in governing this Dioces, and our famous Universitie, whereof he was
Chancellor; they can not be expressed, or declared unto you, but by a
particular induction, or enumeration of his laudable acts, which, truly, I
dare not undertake; because neither do I know them all; and, although I knew
them, I can not speak of them, as their singularity, and excellency does
require. For this cause then, as Timantes the Painter, Pliniu^, lib. 35. cap. 1^
to express the greatness of a Cyclop-Giant, in a little table, painted the
Satyrs beside him, measuring his thumb with a wand: so to express in some
sort, the greatness of his worth, which he kythed in the administration of
that weyghtie Charge, whereunto he was called, I shall only measure his
thumb, and point at one effect of his wise, and happy Government; to wit,
the establishing of a settled Ministry in these parts; or, which is all one,
of a settled course, whereby the Gospel may be propagated in this country,
unto subsequent ages, by able and well qualified men. Two things were
requisite for this; to wit, convenient mayntaynance of Pastors, and increase of
knowledge in the study of Divinity. Mayntaynance, lest good and able men
should want good Places, or Benefices; and increase of knowledge, lest good
Places should want able and good men to occupy, and fill them. The first of
these two he did effectuate, by attending the Platt most diligently, where
he had a (...). For he fought there with the wild beasts of the field, and
with the boars of the forest, who had wasted the Lord his Vine-yarde. He
fought, I say, partly by his own personal diligence, and pains, while he
was able to travel; and partly after he had contracted sickness, he fought
by his letters, authority, and moyen: which were ever much regarded by the
best of this Kingdom. The second he did effectuate, by three means
especially: First, by establishing a Profession of Divinity, which was a
matter of great charges, both to his Presbyters, and also to himself.
Secondly, by procuring a foundation of a good number of Bursses, for
sustentation of Students in Divinity: and thirdly, by appoynting most exact
and strict trials of exspectantes, before their admission to the Ministerial
charge.

In these, and many mo things, which he did for establishing a settled
Ministry here, and for the propagation of the Gospel unto future ages, the
scope or end at which he aimed, was that at which PAUL aimed before him; to
wit, that he might finish his course with joye, Acts 20.24.
and that in the hour of death he might find in his own soul the answer
of a good conscience toward GOD. 1. Pet. 3.21.
Truly, he failed not of his intention. For to omit many particulars, which
I might relate concerning the happiness, and tranquillity of his death, this
one thing I will say, that I never saw any meet approaching death, with
such undaunted cowrage, such Christian confidence, and such assurance of GOD
his favor, as he expressed in his carriage, while he walked in the valley of
the shadow of death. Many speak stoutly of death, and against the fear of
it, before it come: but, as SENECA wittily says, Magna verba excidunt, cum
t^rtor poposcit manum, cum mors propius accessit. Seneca Epist. 82.
they forget these stout speeches, when death draws nigh* That noble and
valorous Earl, ROBERT DEVEREUX, Earl of ESSEX, who suffered in the year 1601
for his rebellion, and died very Christianlie, as Historicians report, being
desired by the Pastors, who were present at his execution, to lay aside all
fear of death; Thuanus hist. tom. 5. lib. 125. page 947.
ingenuouslie confessed, that although he had been in many extreme
dangers, and consequently had looked death often times in the face, yet he had
never looked upon it without much horror, and fear. But our worthy Prelate
was so wonderfully assisted, and strengthened by the Spirit of GOD, against
the terrors of death, that in all these conflictes, and wrastlinges, which in
his body he had with death, he seemed rather to be a spectator, than an
actor. And this his more than ordinary carriage continued still with him,
until he breathed out his Soul into the Bosom of his Master.

To conclude then, I have spoken somewhat of this most Reverende Praelate, but
much short of his worth, and graces. If any of you think that I have said too
much of his virtues, truly I will profess to you, that I think far more
of them nor I have said: neither dare I speak all that I think, Nihil in
tota vita nisi laudandum aut fecit* aut dixit, aut sensit. Velleius
Pater^culus, lib. 1* hist. Romans
lest my speeches seem to these who know him not, or love him not, to proceed
from a flattering humor. I will not say of him, as VELLEIUS PATERCULUS said
of SCIPIO AEMILIANUS, that in all his life he neither did, nor spoke, nor
thought any thing, but that which was praise worthy, (a speech not
hyperbolicke only, but impious) but as Metellus Macedonicus said of the same
man, to his sons, when they were going to his Burial, Go, my sons, and
celebrate his Exequies; I Will, filii, ^^lebrate exequias: nunquam majoris civis
fu^u^ videbi^^.
you shall never see the Funerals of a greater Citizen: so I will say now to
you; Go, celebrate the Funerals of our Venerable, and most worthy Bishop:
you shall never see the Funerals of a worthier Praelate while you live. And so
I end, beseeching God, to give to us all, as he gave to him, grace to live in
the LORD, to the effect that we also may die in the LORD: AMEN.

A FUNERAL SPEECH, In commemoration of the right Reverend Father in GOD,
PATRICKE FORBES of CORSE, late Bishop of ABERDENE, Chancellor and Restorer of
the Universitie thereof, one of his Majesty's most honorable Privy Counsel, a
jewel both of Church and State, Baron of ONEIL, etc.
Delivered Apr. 12. 1635. by ALEXANDER SCROGIE, Doctor in Divinity, and
ordinary Minister of Gods word in the Cathedral Church of ABERDENE.
THE beholding of this place, over-shadowed with a dark and doleful
countenance upon this unacceptable occasion, (GOD so ordering and disposing the
ways of men, by his providence) gives us just cause of heavines, for the
loss of that Grave and Reverend Praelate, and ever worthy Diocesane, a Man of
eminent and best place amongst us: whom albeit we had cum necessitate
amittendi, and have lost him cum spe recipiendi, and so are comforted with the
will of the LORD, Act. 21.14.
that must be done; yet not to have feeling of that which so nearlie concerns
us, were not patience, but blockish stupiditie, contrary the example of
Heathen and Sayncts, and the Lord JESUS mourning for Lazarus, the destruction
of Jerusalem, and hard heart of the Jews.

This is a praecursorie judgment and punishment. So God makes a way for his
judgementes to come upon a Church, or kingdom, when insensibly and graduallie
he eats out the heart and strength of a State; and so, by degrees,
weakeneth, and praepareth it for a fatal blow; that so, without resistance,
he may ruin it; as pyking out, and taking away, now a prudent and
experienced Counselor, and then another out of the way: and those that pray
for the welfare of the Nation, and wrestle mightily with God, for the peace of
it: the Charets, and Horsemen of the land; the staff, and the stay, and
pillars of the house: and so, (by degrees departing himself) a new judgment
in his anger enters in rowme thereof. Then Truth and Holiness commonly
depart, and Ministers begin to be corrupt: the Prophet is a fool, and the
spiritual man is mad: the power and purity of the truth, and the good and
old way departs: and so idolatry grows, and Sects increase, and a
perilous desolation, and change of all things, enseweth. What mischief
followed the death of Samuel, David, Solomon, and Josias? The Goths, after the
death of Ambrose, made in that same place irruption, and settled the seat of
their kingdom. When Augustine ended his days in defense of the grace of GOD,
the Vandales cruelty and errors succeeded. And after the death of blessed
Martin Luther, the bloody Spaniards invaded Germany, Anno 1546
and took Wittenberg.

And shall we not wit, when GOD departs, but be as Sampson? Judges 17.20.
GOD, by death, has taken away, within this short space, a great number of
rare, and worthy men, both for wisdom and learning; which were Ornaments and
Lights in this Diocie: and we see no great evidenes how to fill up this gap.

It is an ancient proverb, Vivorum oportet meminisse: and why, then, should
there not be made an honorable mention of them who have died in the Lord,
because they live to God.

Precious in the sight of the Lord, is the death of his Sayncts: Psalm. 116.1^
(and shall it seem unto us superfluous, at such times as these are, to hear
in what manner they ended their lives?) and he has so exactly recorded in
Scripture, in what sort they have closed their days on earth, that he
descends even to their meanest actions; Genes. 27.3
as, what meat they longed for in their sickness; what they spoke to their
Children, or Friends; Genes. 49.
how they framed their Testamentes; where they have willed to be buried; 1.
Reg. 2.
yea, the very turning of their faces, Genes. 47. and 49. and 50. 2. Reg. 20.
Joshua 38. 1. Reg. 1.
to this or that side: the setting of their eyes; the degrees whereby their
natural heat departed from them; their cries, groans, breathinges, panting,
and last gasping, he has solemnlie commended to all generations.

And GOD, by the Prophet, has for ever commended to the Church, David his
Epitaph, and Funeral Song, 2. Sam. 1.19.
of wicked Saull, and Jonathan his son. He decoreth them, as if God from
Heaven had said, that the Captains of the Armies of Israel should not be
convoyed to the grave without honor, and tears. And, no less they who have
deserved well of the Church and Commonwealth; who have put to flight the
enemies, with the sword of their mouth, and of the Spirit; than they which have
slain them with the mouth and edge of the Sword, and by Armies.

God makes an honorable commemoration of them that did assist his service,
and cause; Hebr. 11. Prove. 10.7.1.12.8. Matthew. 26.13.
and gives them their glory that do any thing for him. Which Christ applies
to the woman that anointed him. So that it is not only lawful, but also
profitable, that the godly life, manners, and virtue, manner and form of the
death of the faithful servands of God, worthy of aeternall praise, be
recommended to future ages; that they may be acquaynted therewith. So the care
of the living, to live and die well, is increased, when they know, that their
death and life shall not be folded up in silence. They are stirred up to the
imitation of their life, and example, and are taught to walk in a good
conscience, as they have done before them. And when they hear how mercifully
God has dealt with them in the hour of their last need, besides the praise
they give to God, for his graces shyning in them, and the joye which they find
in the communion of Sayncts, their hope is much confirmed against the day of
their last dissolution; beholding God delivering his servandes from these
miseries, and restless temptations, and receaving them into rest with himself
in the heave^s.

Yea, the sound of these things does not so pass the ears of those that are
most dissolute in life, but it causes them sometime or other, to wish in their
hearts, O that we might die the death of the righteous, Number. 23.10.
and that our end might be like his.

And especially in these days it is needful, that in charity we testify
the truth of our brethren departed, and maintain their fame, and justify
them from the calumnies of the wicked, who open their mouths, to prattle
against Pastors, both living and dead; unthankfully rendering evil for good;
and cruelly censuring on bare Rumor, against Charity; especially them of
most eminent place. A before the person was wont to bear of many blows from
the function; now the function wounds the person. And that which should
command respect, brandeth them; men's inconsiderate zeal breeding monstrous
conceptions, uncharitable censures, and envy of their greatness: Mortuis
leonibus, vivi lepores insultant.

We here especially who reap the fruit of his labors, ought of duty, of
a pious affection, and thankful mind, lament his loss, and acknowledge his
worth, who was (...), as Sophocles commended Philoctetes; *
and was, as Theodor said of Irenaeus, (...), and is now a glorious star in
the Heavens above, as he was a shyning lamp in the firmament of the Church
here on earth.

And what my self have observed, by long acquayntance, nude nuda loquar,
neither for fashion, nor flattery, that neither his just praise be silenced,
nor any thing besides the truth be forged, I may say with Bernard, Doleo
quod plenum affectu^ exili cogor designare stylo, and brevi chartula latam
comprehendere charitatem, festine enim ista dicta sunt, and ob hoc minus
festive. Cap. ^9. and 108.


As he was largely honored by God, in blood, in name, and descent of an
honorable stock; so he honored it with all the true ornaments of virtue and
wisdom: In his private life, by his piety, and Religion, and constant
profession of the truth, in the strictest sort; by diligent and profitable
hearing thereof, and living accordingly; and, as a Godly Christian, teaching
others, by his example: and might have said as Gedeon, As I do, so do ye.
Thereafter, Judges 17.7.
received to be a Pastor, and Churchman, he was not an idle shepherd; but
diligent, and paynfull, from his entry, in the Ministry, and feeding of the
people, with sound doctrine, powerfullie delivered: always resident, and never
a deserter of that flock: and, in that time, ever vigilant, by all means, to
procure the peace of the Church, Zach. 11.
and the staff of the binders unbroken: but to be still knit together in God,
and the Spirit of concord, and unity.

Thereafter, his calling to the Episcopal dignity, was rare, and examplarie,
without his knowledge, or seeking, directly, or indirectlie, sine ambitu and
usurpation, hunting after places and preferment, as many do, through ambition,
and love of gain and glory, not awayting the LORD'S calling.

Only this I can not forbear: Our gracious Soveraygne, of blessed memory,
did not so much honor him, as himself, and the age, in the freedom of his
noble, and unexpected choice: Orat. ^0.
and that Elogie which Nazianzen gives to Saynct Basil, See to this purpose,
the letters sent from the King* and from the Bishops; which ye shall find in
this book, after these Funeral Sermons*
truly and properly fitteth our Bishop: he was promoved (...). And though
he acknowledged a deep obligation to many great and honorable friends, yet
he ought it to no thing, to no man, but to GOD'S Providence, and the King's
bounty. And thus shall it be done to all them that honor GOD and the King:
GOD and the King, without doubt, will honor them.

He being preferred to be a Bishop, Over-seer, and President of others, in
the Church, and to be employed in matters of weyghtiest importance, and having
put on that sacred honor, yet was he never less in his own apprehension,
what ever he seemed to others: not stately, but gentle, courteous, and
effable, to all.

It agreed to him which is spoken of Simon, the son of Onias the Priest; Ecclus
50.11.
in the Greek text, (...); he glorified the sacred Priestlie Garment with
Virtue, Wisdom, and Nobility: not feeding himself, nor ydlie and
unprofitably spending his life; but in the work of the LORD: That, whereas in
others wealth and power furnishes them fuel, Ez. 3.
to the fire of their lusts; in him it furnished greater matter of doing, and
set his virtuous mind the more on work, as Gregory Nazian reports of
Basilius the great; the more liberty he had, the less he challenged to
himself: remembering what Seneca said, De consol.
Caesari cui omnia lice^t propter hoc ipsum multa non licent: not languishing
with ease, and delicacie; and enjoying few free hours: that being over-spent
with work, he often times complained of his change; and heartily wished, to
have returned to a private life, (by reason of the cares, toyl^, and vexations,
which attend that place) as Saynct Gregory did, if nothing but earthly
respects had swayed him. But he followed the calling of GOD, to whose service
he willingly sacrificed himself; and whose glory was the end of his being.

His first and foremost care, was for the House of GOD; and especially of the
Cathedral Church where he did reside; aedifying, and reparing the ruins
thereof, and furnishing it with ornaments convenient; and which had lain waste
and desolate since the Reformation, wanting a Preacher; because they who
sacrilegiouslie had impropriated the Tithes, wanted conscience to provyde a
Minister, and mayntaynance for him. And, that there might always be an able
and Godly Ministry, he caused found a Profession of Divinity, and a Rent
for the entertaynment thereof, in all times coming. The Benefit whereof, the
Country has already, with great contentment, beholden.

And, in his frequent Visitations of the Churches in his Diocie, he removed,
from many places, idle Lubbards; and purged out all unclean, and unprofitable
ministers; planted Churches, where there were none, and caused endow them with
Land and Living; that there might be mayntaynance in the House of GOD, for the
Prophets, and their sons after them. He dissolved, in many places, Mal* 3.
the unhappy union which was made of Churches; and procured several
Plantations of them.

Jerome says, Ap. 1^8. a^ Fabil^o.
Tanta debet esse scienti^ and eruditio Pontificis DEI ve gestus ejus, and
motus, and vniversa, and vocalia sint, veritatem mente concipiat, and toto ^am
habitu and ornatu resonat. So was he learned, in this learned City, where
there is the Seat of Learning; wise, in ordering, and governing GOD'S House;
faithful, impartial, and solid in judging, discret in admonishing,
compassionate in correcting, full of power and authority in censuring, and
rebuking, to reduce the inordinate; and, when need was, to cut off evil
examples from the Flock: In dispatch of business, speedy, and with great
dexterity: always provident, and careful, to advance the Gospel; and
paynfull, even in the time of his sickness: Without all carnal and base fear
of men: not bowed with boastes, to betray the Church; or daunted, and
discowraged from executing his office with great cowrage, spirit, and
resolutenesse of mind; contending with them, Ez, 3.9.
that contended with God; and fighting a good fight; both in defense of the
truth, and expugnation of heresies, schisms, and seditions brought in by
adversaries.

And, which is a special mark, descerning a faithful Pastor, Tim. 3.5.
from an hyreling, who seeks his own things: He was not given to filthy
lucre; Psalm. 2.21.
but hating covetousnes, 2. Cor. 12, 19.
all simoniacal practices, all cunning and covetous dealing: not corrupted by
brybes; non erat man^ porrecta ad accipiendum, Bern. de modo b^ne vivencti.
sermon. 49.
and collecta ad dandum. But in word and work benevolent, charitable, and
hospital. Not as Tacitus (lib. 1.) spoke of Otho, Opes perdere iste sciet,
donare nescit. An honorable pattern of piety and humanity to all: a lover
and favourer of good men: a comfort to the best; a terror and a wound to
enemies, and the worst inclyned. And, as Augustine spoke of Cyprian, Multi erat
meriti, multi pectoris, multi oris, multae virtutis. In outward carriage, and
actions, grave, modest, and constant: procuring reverence of all that beheld
him. And, which is especially worthy of mention, and imitation, he was sincere
and upright; being within, what he seemed without. Not as Tertullian says of
certain Philosophers, Mimice affecta^t veritatem, Lib. 1. ad Neronem
and affectando corrumpunt. For as Seneca says of Clemens, Nemo potest diu
personam fictam far. But this integrity and constancy appeared in him unto
the end: and it was not only a natural inclination in him, but a spiritual
and gracious disposition.

At last, being over-taken with a longsome and grievous disease, which he did
bear with his accustomed cowrage, and constancy; not using any word of
impatience, complaint, or motion, showing any discontent with God: but with a
quiet invinceable undaunted heart, as an immovable Rock, ^phelde himself by
Faith and Hope, resting in GOD his Savior: only lamenting his infirmity in
this, That it unabled him from the discharge of his Office, Job 13.15.
as he had done when Health lasted. And yet in time of his weakness, his
Memory and Senses being perfect, he caused carry him, (diverse times) both
to the public meeting of the Ministry, and ordinarily to the Church, to
the public worship of GOD, where he was an attentive and comfortable hearer.

And, at last, extremity of sickness, and death drawing near, he was
compelled to keep home, in Divine conference with all that visited him; in
speech jocund, and pleasant: uttering diverse Christian Apophthegmes before
death; often saying, That he had passed the half of death already: Pulch^a
res est consummare vitam ante mortem, Seneca.
vt mors pauca inveniat quae abolere possit. And, laying aside all other care,
he composed himself wholly unto that heavenly life: and with that store of
Comforts which he had taught others, prepared himself to death; to yield his
days peaceably, and with good resolution: (...).

Wherein he show great contentment, and willingness to die, and change this
life with a better. For he knew, by his singular wisdom and piety; Nihil
esse stultius, quam ad praemia coelestia non obsequio voluntatis accurrere, sed
necessitatis vinculo invitum trahi.

And, for his farther comfort, received the holy SACRAMENT of the Body and
Blood of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, with great devotion, in the company, and
together, with diverse Reverend and Godly Men, the Ministers of both the
Towns; unto whom he very heartily, in token of his agreement, and comfort
he had of their fellowship in his life, gave his Blessing, and recommended
them unto the Grace of GOD.

After which, strength and speech failing, he gave diverse tokens, to them who
were present, of a mind settled and established, by Faith and Hope, in
assurance of the Mercy of GOD, in the remission of his sins. And then the
extremity of pains chased that Soul of his, out of the tabernacle of this
flesh; which the Angels have carried unto the Bosom of his Father ABRAHAM;
being delivered from the wearisomnesse, and perils of this life, and now eats
the Fruits of his labors; and his Conscience, the comfort of his former
fidelity: and with unspeakable joye awayteth for our coming thither.

A SERMON, Preached at the Funeral of the R. R. Father in GOD, PATRICKE
FORBES, Late Lord Bishop of ABERDENE, In the special Church of the City of
ABERDENE, called Saynct Nicolas, the xij of April, 1635.
By WILLIAM GUILD, Doctor of Divinity, Chaplane to his Majesty, and Minister
of GOD'S Word in the foresaid City.
LUKE II. VERSE. 29. LORD, now let thou thy servant depart in peace,
according to thy Word.


THese words (dearly beloved in our Lord and Savior) which I have read in your
present audience, according to the opinion of some, are the words of Praise;
and of others, are the words of Petition. Of Praise* old Simeon in them having
now gotten the performance of that Promise made unto him, That he should not
see Death, till he saw the LORD'S Anointed: and having the Babe, CHRIST JESUS,
in his arms, he prayseth GOD for this performance; and acknowledges, That now
He was letting him depart i^ peace; for his eyes (according to His word of
promise made unto him) had seen his Salvation. And those who so expound this
Text, have for their warrant the word (...), in the present time.

Some, again, (both Ancient and Modern) make these words, to be the words
of Petition, and to contain the holy desire of this happy old Man; wherein
now having gotten in his lyfe-tyme a sight of his promised and longed-for
Savior, while He was presented in the Temple, he desires now a peaceable and
happy departure; as having seen Him who is the death of Death, and LORD of
Life, after whom he longed.

In which Text we have to consider, 1. That there is a Departure out of this
life: 2. That this is common to the Servants of GOD, as well as to the wicked;
therefore says old SIMEON, Now, LORD, let thy servant depart. 3. We see how
the death of GOD'S servants is called; to wit, a Dimission, or freedom, to
depart. 4. The difference between the death and departure of the Godly and
the wicked; to wit, the one is in Peace, the other not. 5. From whom this
peaceable departure is had; and, what is the ground of the Godlie's assurance
of the LORD'S granting the same; to wit, His Word and Promise. And last, what
is it that makes the death of the Godly to be peaceable, and, by
consequence, so appetible* to wit, even the sight of the LORD'S Salvation: For
^yne eyes (says he) have seen thy Salvation.

First, then, we see, that as there is an oritur, or an entry into this life
by birth; so there is a moritur, or a departure out of this life by death: a
Genesis we have by the one, an Exodus by the other. And this is grounded upon
that common Law, by reason of Man's transgression; Dust thou art, and to dust
thou shall return. Whereunto is agreeable that which is said by the Apostle,
It is appointed for all men once to die, and after this is judgment. Genesis
3.19. ^eb. 9.27.
Therefore says the Psalmist, (without any exception) What man lives, and
shall not see death? Psalm. 89.4^* Heb. 13.14*
For we have here no continuing city, (says S. Paul) and our juorney is from
the womb to the worm, carried in the swift chariot of time, upon the two
restless wheels of motion and mutation, till we arrive at that innes in end,
wherein we shall say to corruption, Thou art our Father; and to the worm,
thou art our brother and our sister. Job. 17.^4.
And as we were made of the earth, and live on it, so we shall return to it,
to rest in it, till we rise from it, age still wearing us, sickness
preparing, death arresting, the grave expecting, and the worms at last
welcomming us. Therefore well may it be said of all as it was wittily said
to a Grammarian, that tho he could decline a nowne in every case, yet death
can not be by any declined in no case.

WHENCE WE LEARN; 1. Seeing our mansion place is not here, but (as Isai
says) our age departs, and is removed from us as a shepherds tent, Isa.
38.12,
and we must depart our selves at last, and (as the Apostle subjoyneth) then
come to judgment; Therefore the rememberance of our departure should ever be
before our eyes, and a daily preparation for the same should ever be our
practice, praying with Moses, Lord teach us to number our days, that we may
apply our hearts unto wisdom; Psalm. 90.1^
and acknowledging this only to be true wisdom, to work out the work of our
own salvation in fear and in trembling: therefore says one, Mors tibi
semper sit in tua cogitatione, quia ea semper est in tui expectatione. Which
moved Abraham to make a burial place his first possession in the promised
land, and Joseph of Arimathea to have his tomb in his garden of pleasure.
Nothing being more powerful than this daily rememberance, to kill sin, quell
pride, quench concupiscence, convince avarice, confound luxury, abate
vainglory, and weane our hearts from all worldly vanity: and therefore
this having been ever the godlies Arithmeticke, the Saints Geometry, and the
Christians Philosophy.

2
Seeing we must depart from this world, then let not our souls be ensnared,
and entangled with the love of the world; let us eschew the serpents curse, to
be still cleaving to the dust of the earth; or with Esau, to content with the
fat of the same: let us not be so base as to be filii terrae only, and
earth worms who are borne anew, to be children to God, and citizens of Heaven;
but in time separate our selves in affection therefra, using the same as if we
used it not: that our separation by dissolution therefra may be the fruition
of a better inheritance: and considering that a little earth must once
contain, whom the whole earth can not content.

3
Seeing we must depart from hence, and that we know not how soon, (as the Lord
said unto Abraham, Exi de terra tua) we be in lykemanner charged to go out of
this earthly tabarnacle, let us forecast with our selves, and think of our
after-estate, which is not to be for a short time, but eternal for ever: and
therefore let us be like that wise steward spoken of in the Gospel, and make
friends to our selves with the mammon of iniquity; that when we fail, we
may be received into everlasting habitations; Prospice and praemitte, must be
the practice then of a prudent Christian; that so he may know the reason of his
cupio dissolvi, to be with the Apostle; this confidence of his after-estate,
esse cum CHRISTO: else doleful will be the sight of death, like Iehues march
be toward him, when he can only say this, or worse, with that heathen
wretch, Animula blandula vagula, quae nunc abibis inloca?

And if it please the Lord in this life to exercise us with crosses, or
discontentments, yet let us not grudge with our lot, but possess our Souls
with patience, and remember, that our time of bearing the cross after our
Savior, is but short; and a time draws near, wherein we shall depart from
them, and they in like manner give an eternal farewell to us: the Canaanite
shall no more be in the land, the rod of the wicked shall be no more upon the
back of the righteous, the godly shall no more sow in tears; but it shall be
said to the soul by her blessed Bryde-groome, as we have in the Canticles,
Arise, my love, Cant. ^.
my fair one, and come away; for lo, the winter is past, the rain is over,
and gone; The flowers appear on the earth, the time of singing of birds is
come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our Land, and Vespera quos
flentes ducit sata sancta ferentes,
Fasciculis gravidos aurora reducet ovantes.


Secondly, this Text intimates unto us, that death, or this bodylie departure,
is common to Gods servants, as well as to the wicked: therefore says old
Simeon, Now, Lord, let thy servant depart in peace: and accordingly does the
Psalmist inquire, without any exception, saying, What man is he that lives,
and shall not see death? for which cause we see that this is ever the common
clausule of that record of the lives of all those worthies from Adam to Noah,
Genesis 5. [ and ^ee died.] Howsoever, then, that Abraham be commended for faith,
Isaac for piety, Jacob for integrity, Joseph for chastity, Moses for
meekness, Samuel for uprightness, David for zeal* Solomon for wisdom, and
Job for patience, etc. yet deaths sithe mowed them all down as grass, and
they slept with their Fathers.

The reasons of which the Lords doing, are, 1. For the manifestation of his
truth, in that threatening of Adam, and all his posterity, Dust thou art, and
to dust thou shall return: 2. For declaration of his power, 1. over sin,
which brought in death, wherein Gods wonderful power is seen, that he makes
death which sin brought in, utterly to abolish sin which bred and brought
in the same: so that thereof it may be said, Filia devoravit matrem: and that
sin which in us grace makes moribundum, death kills outright, and makes
it to be mort^um: the brood of this viper gnawing forth so, the womb which
hatched the same, and Goliah's sword cutting off as it were his own head.
Next, hereby the Lord declares his power over death (as well as formerlie,
over sin by death) that although death seem so to prevail over the Godly, as
to turn their bodies into dust, and to have them surely laid fast in his
strong hold of the grave: yet as Potiphars wife catched only and kept the
upper garment of Joseph, but himself went free, and thereafter being advanced
was royally arrayed; even so death lays hold or elie on the garment whereof
we must be unclothed, before our better part get free, or that we be
gloriously arrayed in that place of heavenly advancement: As also, the power
of our good GOD shall appear yet more wonderful, when in the resurrection,
death and the grave shall render up the bodies of his elect, as being only
there Depositum: and as the Apostle says, that which was sown in corruption,
and weakness, shall arise in incorruption, in glory, and in strength. And 4.
This is done by the Lord, for working a conformity of the members with their
head, CHRIST JESUS, that as he tasted of death, and thereby entered into life
eternal; so must they in lykemanner. And last, as Saynct Augustine says. It
is ad certamen, and that by the struggling with the fear thereof, and
overcomming the same, the strength and power of faith may appear, the
fortitude of patience, and the victory of the Godly thereby* may be the more
compleet and glorious. Therefore says that holy Ancient, Si enim parva virtus
esset fidei quae perdilectionem operatur, Aug. de peccatorum meriti^ and
remissione. lib. 2. page 147.
mortis metum vincere non esset tanta martyrum gloria, nec diceret Dominus,
majorem hac charitate^ nemo habet quam ut animam suam ponat pro amicis suis,
nequaqua^ ergo pro justitia in morte subeunda vel contemnenda landaretur
praecipua patientia, si mortis non esset magna multumque dura molestia, cujus
timorem qui vincit ex fide, magna^ ipsius fidei comparat gloriam justamque
mercedem.

The third thing which we have to consider in this Text, is, how the death of
Gods servants is called, as the word (...) signifies unto us; to wit, that the
same is a dimission from servitude or captivity, or a departure out of prison.
This prison being the body, the door whereof by death is opened, that the
soul may go free: and as Noah's dove returned to him who sent her forth,
with an olive branch in her bill; so the spirit of man which came from God, may
return (as says Ecclesiastes) unto God that gave it: Mors ergo
obstretricatur animae. Death then is but the midwyfe to the soul: and as our
first birth brought us out of the prison of the womb, and our second out of
nature and sin; so this third and last birth, by death, shall bring us
perfectly, the soul out of the prison of the body, and the whole man out of
the prison of all worldly misery; the pangues of death-being but the showers
or throws of the bodies traveling before the fowls deliverie; and our
sickly groans and dead rattle at last, being but the sound of the jaylours
key (as it was opening the prison door.) Death does then to the Godly, as
GIDEON and his soldiers did to their earthen pitchers, wherein the burning
lamps were enclosed, and as it were imprisoned: their earthen pitcher is
broken, that the lamp of their soul may be at liberty, and shine more
brightlie in Glory: or as the fire of that furnace wherein the three children
were casten, did only burn the fetters wherewith they were bound, without
harming themselves; even so death bursteth only that bond of natural life
whereby the soul and body are tied together here in misery; but can not
bereave us of our true life, either in Christ of grace, or with Christ of
glory. As Pharao's Butler then was glad at the end of the three days, to go^
out of prison* and comfortable was the incomming of the jaylour to him for his
liberation; so when the few and evil days of the pilgrimage, and the
imprisoment of the Lords servants in their bodies, is at an end, O how joyful
is the coming of the messenger of death unto them! for as the wicked man
dying, may say unto death, as Ahab said to Eliah, Have thou found me, 1.
Kings. 21.20.
O mine enemy? and trembles (like Felix) at the hearing of the same; so on
the contrary, Act. 24.26.
as Adoniah said to Jonathan the son of Abiather, Come in, for thou art a
valiant man, and bring good tidings. 1. King* 1.4^
And as David in like manner said of Ahimaaz, that he was a good man, and
brought good tidings with him: 2. King. 18.
so death is a good messenger to them, and brings good tidings with him; even
(as the Angel said to the sheepheards at CHRIST'S birth) Tidings of great
joye; to wit, that their souls are to be fred from all earthly misery, and
to enter into eternal joy: and that as the blessed of the Lord, they shall
rest from their labors, and their works follow them. Therefore as Laban
welcomed Abrham's servant, and said, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord: even so
the Godly may justly welcome death, and invite him as it were to come in, the
curse, and course, whereof to them is turned to a blessing.

Seeing therefore the death of the Godly, is a freedom, and delyverie, out of
prison, and captivity, we see how far we should be from the love of this
life, being the time only of such a painful imprisonment, such a languishing
labor, an Egyptian bondage, a Babylonish captivity, a woeful exile, a stormy
seavoyage, a weariesome pilgrimage, and a dangerous warrefare, frail it self;
and having an hourlie and circular necessity of such frail things to support
the pillars thereof, whose foundation is in the dust, which is nourished by
dust, and in end the honor and vigor whereof must be laid in the dust;
involved in a world of vanities, and wrapped about with a cloud of vexations,
carnal lusts, thornie cares, and domesticke discontentments; Satan ^empting
without, corruption betraying within, the conscience stinging, pleasures
alluring, fears affrighting, adversity fretting, prosperity flattering,
sickness assaulting, and death ever at last (as a burreau) attending our
execution; besides, who can recount the losses and crosses, the cares and
calamities, disquyetings and discontentments, with the miseries and
mutabilities that are incident to this mortal and momentarie life; rightly
therefore compared to grass, which withers; a flower, which fades; a buble,
or water bell, which breaks; smoke, which evanisheth; a weavers shittle,
which passes* a traveller, who posteth; the fat of lambs which consumes; a
shepherds tent, which f^itteth; a frail ship, which floateth; a dream,
without soliditie; a thought, for celeritie; a hyrelings time, for misery:
and, in a word, mere and only vanity. Wherein to be then, is not to live,
but to be daily dying, thoughts tossing the mind, cares torturing the heart,
pains pinching the body, pensiveness possessing the soul, fears fretting,
crosses consuming, and death at last consummating. And wherein there is not any
hour wherein we are not either in the remembrance of calamities bypast, or
the sense of some present, or under the fear and foresight of some that are to
come. So that it is most true which Job says of man in this life; Job. 14.1.
Man that is borne of woman, is of short continuance* and full of trouble.

Curasque subiisse molestas.
Sors homini connataetulit, velut edita prunis
Scintilla ignitis, Job. 5.7.
tenues vaga scandit in a^ras.
O then (as says Moses) That men were wise, and would consider their latter
end, Deuteronomy. 32.29
and would think on the worlds vanity, to despise it; lyfes frayltie, to
contemn it; deaths certayntie, to expect i^; judgments severitie, to prevent
it; hells misery, to avoyde it; and heavens felicity, to attain it.

Seeing the death of the Godly is a parting, and not a perishing; 2
a delyverie, and not a destruction; an annalysing, and not an annihilating, In
qua potius miseria Christiani, Phil. 1.23.
quam ipse Christianus moritur. Therefore the same is not to be feared by them
who die, nor yet excessiuelie deplored by us who surviue, praemit^untur enim,
and non amittuntur; oriuntur potius quam moriuntur, eorumque funera sunt iis
maxim^ foenera. So that death unto them is rather premiall, nor penal; life,
nor loss; and the day thereof, like a birthday, to be celebrated (in respect
of them) rather with mirth, nor mourning. Therefore they rather desire, nor
dread the same, saying with David, My soul thirsts for God, even for the
living God: when shall I come, and appear before God? Or with S. Paull, Psalm.
42.2.
I desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ. Phil. ^.23.
Or with Simeon here; Lord, now let thy servant depart in peace* Or with the
Sayncts, saying; How long, O Lord, which art holy, and true? Come, Lord Jesus,
come quickly. Revel. 6.10. and 22.2^.
And good reason they have for doing so, because three things concur to them
which are matter of great joye to us in this life; a glad marriage, a glorious
triumph, and a solemn coronation; the marriage with Christ, the triumph over
all their enemies, and the coronation with a crown of righteousness. If poor
Esther, then, and all her kindred, were glad when she was assumed by king
Assuer^s, to be his Queen: If David rejoiced when he came back triumphing
after the slaughter of Goliath; and if the earth it self rang for joye with the
acclamations of the coronation of Solomon; O how joyefull a day is that wherein
the poor soul of a Christian, is married gloriously with Him who is King of
kings, and Lord of lords; and at the sight of that blessed Brydegroome, (as at
Elizabeth's hearing of the blessed virgins salutation the Baptist did) how
does that soul spring and leap for joye? O with what joyefull acclamations
also do these glorious spirits welcome the triumphant soul that is victorious
over the enemies of Gods glory, and man's good, and who so rejoice at the
conversion of a sinner, much more shall they not at the coronation of a Saynct,
assumed up to heaven, associate to the Patriarchs, made equal with the
Angels, and conformed to Christ?

The fourth thing which this Text offers to our consideration, is the
difference between the death of the Godly, and the death of the wicked: the
one is in peace, the other not: therefore, says the Prophet, Isai. 57.
There is no peace to the wicked (says my GOD.) But on the contrary, Mark
the Godly, and the upright man, Psalm. 37.37.
(says the Psalmist) For the end of that man is peace: for according to his
souls estate, (as says Isaias) he enters into peace; and according to his
body, Isai. 57.2.
he rests in the grave, as a sweet sleeping bed: so that he may say with
David, I will lay me down in peace, Psalm. 4.8.
and sleep; And when I awake, I shall be satisfied with thy likeness. The
cause of which death in peace, Psalm. 17.15.
is the life of grace: and because they lived the life of the righteous,
therefore they die the death of the righteous. But as for the wicked, they
depart not in peace, because their life was destitute of grace: both which the
Apostls join as inseparable in their salutations [ grace and peace:] therefore
says the Prophet of them, The way of peace they have not known, and there was
no uprightness in their goings: Isai. 59.8.
but they made them crooked paths, wherein whosoever goes, he shall not know
peace: wherefore they shall be in death, as Balthassar was in his agony,
seeing nothing but their guilty conscience writing bitter things against them;
sorrowing for their sins bygone; being in anguish for their present misery,
and in terror for torments to come. Satan now accusing them, the conscience
convicting them, the law condemning them, the Gospel forsaking them, the
Heavens debarring them, and (like Jonas whale) hell gaping to swallowe them. O
dreadful perplexity, when fear is so on every side* a wrathful judge
above, unquenchable flames beneath, a gnawing worm within, a dreadful dittie
before, fearful fiends about, and a doleful doom at hand. Whereas on the
contraire, the death of the Godly has peace for perplexity, solace for
sorrow, and for dreadour, desire of dissolution, their sins are silent, their
conscience calm; the Law absolveth them, the Gospel comfort them* their
Savior attends them, Heaven is open to them, the Angels accompany them, and
their good works do follow them. O comfortable is the claim that the soul
makes in that hour, to God, as a reconciled Father* to Christ, as her
bryde-groome, and Savior; to his blood, as her ransom; to his sufferings, as
her satisfaction; to his promises, as the covenant; to Heaven, as his purchase
for her; and to the society of the Sayncts and Angels, as fellow-citizens in
eternal glory with her.

1. Seeing then, that this is only the privilege of Gods servantes, to depart
in peace, let not Satan's slaves, in their senseless security, claim or
expect the same: For such a Pearl, is not for swyne; nor this Bread of God's
Children, is not to be given to dogs. Therefore, it may be said to them, ^.
Kinsg. 9.
as Ieh^ said to Ioram, What have thou to do with peace, so long as thy
impieties are so many, and thy impenitencie so great? Or as the Lord says to
the wicked, What have thou to do, Psalm. 50.^6.
to take my Covenant of peace in thy mouth, and that thou should expect to
die the death of the righteous, who wilt not live the life of the righteous?
Seeing that, Qui in vita moritur per viti^, certo in morte transire oportet ad
aeterna supplicia?

2. Seeing the departure of the Godly is in peace, and that (as the Prophet
says) in that hour they enter into peace, or into a joyful and peaceabe
estate, Isai. 17*
resting from their labors; it follows then, that they depart not with the
terrifying expectation of a fyrie purgatory, wherein their perplexed souls
are to satisfy, and suffer in those infernal flames, no less torment nor the
souls of the damned, except only in shorter indureance. For this were not to
die in peace, but perplexity, and in the fit of such a pani^ fear as
over-tooke Balthasser, and by which* their godless and groundless assertion,
whereby like the scorpion tails of those locusts in the Revelation, they
stryke with the terror of torment poor simple souls, Gods mercy is marred,
CHRIST'S merit maimed, his truth belyed, his death debased, his sufferings
stained, and his people abused, by these who have made gain their godliness;
but not godliness to be gain; turning Gods Temple again into a Den of
thieues; and therein making merchandise, not of doves, Revel. 18.13
but of men's souls, (as is fore-tolde of them) being better seen (as one
says) in the golden number of actual receat, nor for their warrant in this
point, in the dominicall letter of sacred and holy Writ.

Out of these things also which have been formerlie spoken, to wit, that the
death of Gods servants, is a peaceable departure out of the prison of this
body, and miseries of this world, we may consider these three things in the
same; to wit, the 1 necessity of their death; 2. The facility; and 3. The
felicity thereof. Necessity, which makes resolution; facility; which gives
consolation; and felicity, which causes appetition. Necessity shows it to
be in evitable; facility, easily tolerable; and felicity, greatly
desiderable.

1
The necessity is herein, that it is our Posse-over, and that we must depart
out of the Egypt of this world, before we can enter into that heavenly
Canaan. A dissolution it is called; and therefore, a separation must be of the
soul from the body, before that celestial union can be effectuated with
our Savior Christ. A devesting of Mortality must be, before we put on
Immortality; 2. Cor. 54.
and a throwing down of our earthly tabernacle, before we get that better
house to dwell in, not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens.

2. The facility of the death of Gods servants, is in this, that their death
is a peaceable departure; death having lost its perplexing fear, its paynfull
sting, and horrid shape; and the soul being more ravished with that
approaching sight of God, than the body is payned with the sense of death: the
passion of mortality, being so beaten back with the impression of aeternitie,
that the soul is so far from slackenesse to go forth, Genesis 1^.
(as Lot was out of Sodom) as on the contrary, it hastes to be in that
place, where it may truly say with the disciples, Bonum est nobis esse hic:
even as Abraham hasted to meet the Angels; or Peter and John hasted to the
grave to see that CHRIST was risen. And as willingly they lay down the body,
when death comes for them, as Peter did his shackels whereof he was unloosed,
Act. 1^.
when the Angel came to bring him out of prison. Hence it is called in
Scripture, only a falling asleep, a giving up the Ghost, a gathering to our
fathers, a laying down of this earthly tabernacle, and an vnclothing of us,
like Joseph, of his prison garments, or the prodigal of his beggarly rags,
to be gloriously arrayed, and highly advanced to a heavenly preferment,
where all losses are recompensed, all wants supplied, all crosses removed, all
tears wiped away, all promises performed, and all happiness procured; where
Satan is trod under, death overcome, corruption abolished, sanctification
perfected, and glory at last obtained.

3. The felicity also of the death of the Godly, in the bright sight of the
Lords salvation, is unutterable, when that eternal Sabbath comes, and
joyefull jubilee approaches, when the Lambs Bryde shall enter into that
marriage Chamber, to sight most specious, in rowme most spacious, and in
beauty most glorious; wherein to come, is hghiest dignity; to dwell, is
greatest felicity; and to live in, is most joyful eternity: the pleasures
whereof are so plentiful, that for greatness they can not be measured; so
many, that they can not be numbered; so precious, that they can not be
esteemated; and so dureable, that they can not be limited: which we shall
enjoye, without weariness; admire, without ignorance; affect, without measure;
and feed on, without loathsomeness: never to be terminated, impossible to be
determinated: where security is with safety; peace, with all plenty; light,
with all liberty; rest, with all rejoicing; and tranquillity, with all
felicity: where youth flowrisheth, that never fades; health continues, which
never alters; beauty lasts, which never blasteth; love abounds, which
never abateth; and life endures, which never ends.

The fifth point, is, from whom this peaceable departure is sought; to wit, from
the Lord, who only can make it such, by that inward assurance of
reconcilement with himself; wherein as we see the practice of the Godly,
ever for all good, or comfort, either in life or death, to have their constant
recourse to God only, and to no creature, Saynct, or Angel, whatsoever. So
we see, that the godly are so far from putting the memory of death away
(as others do) from before their eyes, as a tormenter of them before the time,
that they hold it ever in their sight, and (with old Simeon here, and the
Apostle) earnestly desire the approach thereof, Psalm. 142.7.
saying with the Psalmist, Bring my soul out of prison, O Lord, that I may
praise thy Name. And so they can not only pray with Moses, Lord, teach us to
number our days, that we may apply our heatrs unto wisdom; but also can wish
the acceleration thereof in GODS good time; even as the workman longs for the
shadow; or the hyreling, for the end of his work. Job. ^.2.
And this they do not out of a fit of impatience, as we see in Jonas; nor
out of such discontent, as we perceive even in Godly Eliah; but out of a
longing, Jonas 43.1, King. 19.4 Psalm. 42.
with David, to see Gods face with joye, and of that happy conjunction with
CHRIST, whereof the Apostle speaks. Hence it is, that they make not
themselves for death when sickness comes, because they must die, out of
natures necessity; but because they would die, out of graces desire: many
things giving up their last work at death, which make the godly with the
Apostle to cry out in life, Who shall delyver me from this body of death?
For then Satan gives his last assault, sin leaves her temptation; the world
its allurement; corruption, its repyning; the conscience, its accusing; the
body, its painful toil; and men their hurtful injuring: and then the soul,
in the strongest affection thereof, (set upon Heaven and heavenly things)
having gone before, now in its purified substance, is not so much thrust by
deaths hand out of the body, (as Lot was out of Sodom by the Angel) as it
goes forth joyefullie (like Noah out of the Arc) and is pulled into that
celestial Mansion, by the hand of God, as the Dove was taken into the Arc
again, when she could find no rest to the sole of her foot.

The last thing which this Text offers to our consideration, is the reason of
this wish of old Simeon, or what it is that makes the death of the godly, to
be peaceable, and consequently so appetible; to wit, even the sight of the
Lords Salvation; for so calls he CHRIST, and which word in the greek
((...)) signifies as much, as that he is the author, yea, the very treasury
and storehouse where in all salvation is contained: as he is likewise called
so by the Prophet ( Isai. 52.10.) and so clearlie distinguished from all
others, who in Scripture were styled by the name of Saviors. Neither is it,
that we must think that a corporal sight here is only meant, for that was
common; but that with the eye of faith also, which is special and proper
only to the elect, he saw this blessed Babe to be that salvation,
preordayned and appointed by the LORD* promised, and now sent in the flesh, for
the redemption of mankind. Whence we observe,

1
In that it is formerlie said, that this just and devote man, Simeon, waited
for the consolation of Israel, and had it revealed unto him, by the holy
Ghost, that before he saw death, he should see the LORD'S Anointed: and now
that his longing is satisfied, and that promise which was made unto him (as he
confesses) is fulfilled, we see, that as the Godly hunger and thirst
specially after spiritual things, so they are ever heard in their Godly
desires, and in such things that concern their salvation: therefore as in
David's words doubtless he had said before, O Lord, I have longed for thy
salvation; yea, my soul faynteth for the same: Psalm. 119.174.81.82.
when will thou comfort me? and with the holy Patriarchs* (as the Apostle
shows) as he had embraced the promise thereof spirituallie, which was made
unto him there anent; so now at last, Heb. 11.
we see, he gets him who was promised, to embrace in his arms
corporally; and accordingly acknowledges joyfullie, that his eyes now did
see the Lords salvation. And so the Lords promise is performed, his longing
satisfied, and his waiting accomplished. Let us then only (with old Simeon)
wait patiently, and constantly, for his consolations; and rest assured that
he is myndfull of us, and his own promises; and in his own good and fit
time will come unto us for our joye, and will make no tarrying.

2. We see the ground or cause of a peaceable and comfortable death; to wit, a
preceding sight of the Lords salvation, which he has decreed to be, by the
Son of his love, CHRIST JESUS; and for whose sake and merit of his death, he
has admitted such of mankind to life, as he has elected, for the
manifestation of the riches and glory of his grace. This therefore is the
right art of dying well, to get true faith, and to fix the eye thereof (as the
people in the wilderness did) upon that true brazen Serpent, CHRIST JESUS, the
Lord of life. Incorporate thy self in him then, and there shall be no
condemnation to them that are in CHRIST. Wrap thy self in his righteousness,
and it shall be like Elias mantle, which devyded the waters of Jordan: cleave
thereby to his cross, and it shall be like that tree that made the waters of
Marah sweet; or Moses rod, which made a safe passage to Israel, through the red
sea. Set the Arc of the Covenant in these waters, and from the desert of this
world thou shall have a patent and pleasant path to that heavenly Canaan: yea,
tho stones were flinging about thy ears, to brain thee, as was done to that
protomartyr Steven* yet looking up with the eye of faith, and getting a sight
of JESUS CHRIST, standing at the right hand of his Father, ready to receive
thee, thy departure shall be most calm and comfortable; and thy sins being
silenced by him who is this salvation spoken of, thou shall hear nothing but
the sweet voice of that blood of sprinkling, which speaks better things nor
the blood of Abell; and dying, as it were, in the arms of thy Lord: As Jacob
saw with joye of heart, the chariots that Joseph sent for him for his
transportation; so shall thou see the glorious and blessed Angels sent for
thee, and thy good works following thee; the one to guide thee, and surrender
their charge; the other to gladden thee, and receive their reward.

3. As we see what is the ground of the peaceable death of the Godly; so on
the contrary, we may perceive what is the cause of the terror of death in
the wicked; and that the memory thereof so much tormenteth them before the
time, that as Pharao did to Moses, they bid it go packing out of their sight:
even this is the cause thereof; that being blinded by Satan, all the days of
their life, in committing sin, and never once looking with a tearing eye of
true repentance upon them, therefore in death they never get a sight of this
salvation of the Lords, nor have they any assurance, that he who is the
Savior of the world, shall be a Savior to them: but on the contrary, then
they find that he who was their Tempter, begins to be their Tormenter:
then they begin to hear the clamours of their accusing conscience, to see the
ugly shape of their sinful souls, the dreadful aspect of their heinous
sins, the wrathful face of the angry Judge; Heaven closed above, to debar
them, as Adam was from the tree of life; and hell opened beneath, to swallow
them, as the earth was to swallow up Korah: then they begin to feel the
approaching flames of that infernal fire, paynfullie to scorch them; the worm
that never dies, drawing near, to guawe them; the wrath of GOD, that never
shall be appeased, most furious to astonish them* and the infernal fiendes,
who attend, to terrify, and cruelly to torture them. In which woeful estate,
to hyde themselves, is impossible; to avoyde these miseries, inevitable; and,
to endure them, intolerable. Hence the sting of death shall torment them; the
rememberance of judgment, perplexe them; the gulf of despare, (without hope
or help) swallowe them; and the apprehension of eternity, in easelesse and
endless pain, confound them. O! who can then express their sad sorrow for
sins past; their agonizing anguish, for misery present, and their trembling
terrors, for the torments to come? being justly thus served, as they have
deserved: and finding at the doleful parting of the sinful soul, from the
wretched body, (whose meeting again, and re-uniting, to be a faggot in hell
fire, shall be much more doleful and dolorous) no comfort from Heaven, nor
earth; the Creator, nor the creature; but matter of confusion. The ground of
all which deep distress being this; Because the soul (with old Simeon
here) can get no sight of the LORDS Salvation.

4. We see here a near and clear way, how to contemn all earthly and
worldly things; the bewitching love whereof, has made many to make
ship-wracke of a good conscience, and clogged their hearts so to the earth,
that it has debarred them for ever from the joys of Heaven. Eeven this is the
way; Labor to get a sight of the Lord's Salvation; which if thou do, all
other things will seem but dung, and loss: and that which dazeleth the eyes
of the wicked, with the glory of them, (wherewith Satan would have tempted our
SAVIOR) will appear unto thee, but as they are; to wit, base dust, vain
tryf^es, and altogether worthless. Then, getting this comfortable, and
contenting sight, thou will not care, tho thy eyes be closed, from seeing any
other earthly after-sight; and wilt say rather with old Simeon, Let thy
servant depart in peace, from seeing farther here, in respect of that sweet
sight of thy salvation, which I have gotten by grace, and long to have it more
clearlie, and fully in glory. Surely, as when the three Disciples saw this
Salvation of the Lord in His transfiguration, they despised all sights beside,
and said, Bonum est nobis esse hic; so will they who get this spiritual sight
of Him, and assurance of salvation in Him, despise all worldly things, and
say, that to be dissolved from them, and to be with Christ, is the best of all:
whereas others, alia non despiciunt, quia non eum recipient; and are so in
love with earth, because they were never acquaynted with Heaven.

5. If this was such joy to old Simeon, to see Christ Jesus, a poor Babe, in
the estate of humility, that he desired to depart in peace, O what joye is it
and shall be, to His Sayncts, to see Him as He now is, in the estate of Glory?
not (as then) upon earth, but now in Heaven; not amongst sinful men, but
glorious Angels, and spirits of the just: and not subject to passion, and
injuries; but now in exaltation, and inhabiting praises. Old Iaakob was so
ravished with joye, when he saw Joseph in Egypt, that almost with the very
like words he cried out with old Simeon, Now let me die, Genesis 46 30
since I have seen thy face. The people of Israel also they shouted for joy,
when the Ark of God came into the host: the earth it self likewise rang for
joy, when the people saw Solomon anointed, and crowned their king: and the
Baptist also in his mothers womb leaped for joy, at the approach of our
Savior, newly conceaved. O then, how shall the elect soul, departing out of
this earthly body, be ravished with joye, when it shall see Christ Jesus,
glorious in the Heavens; when it shall behold that true Ark of God, and hear
the Heavens ring with joyful praises of that true SOLOMON, the King of kings,
and Lord of lords, who sits upon the Throne? And if Moses face did shine,
when he was but a few days with the Lord on Horeb, and saw but His
back-parts; O, how shall they shine, then, who in all aeternitie shall see Him
face to face, upon that heavenly Mountain? Or if those servantes of Salomons
were pronounced blessed, who stood before him, and heard his wisdom; how much
more blessed shall His servantes and sons be, who is greater than Solomon,
who in those Celestial Mansions stall stand before Him, hear Him, see Him,
and for ever live with Him? Whom to see, is felicity; to hear, is heavenly
melody; and to live with Him, a most blessed society.

6. Last of all, these words of old Simeon, decanted near his death, are
called The Song of Simeon; being herein like the Swan, who is said to sing
sweetly, about that time when death approaches unto her: Wherein we see,
what way to make our death joyful, and comfortable unto us; wherein we may not
begin to sorrow, but to sing, to wit, with Simeon, who is said to be a just and
devote man; to lead a holy life, and embrace offered salvation: and so we
shall die a happy death, and eschow damnation. Sow then in tears betyme, if
thou would reap in joy; and let thy tears here, prevent thy terrors
hereafter; a holy life, a hellish death; and true sanctification, aeternall
condemnation.

Having thus expounded this Text, I made choice thereof in this Funeral
Commemoration of the la^e Right Reverend Praelate, our most worthi^ Diocesane,
and Ordinary, for these respects: 1. Two days before his happy departure,
having an earnest desire to participate of the blessed Communion, with us his
Clergy, Ministers of Aberden^, and ordinary Assessors; when, most devotelie,
he with us had received that blessed Pledge of his Salvation, there was read
unto him thereafter this portion of holy Scripture: unto which words of old
Simeon, Lord, now let thy servant depart in peace, etc. (with his eyes lifted
up) he gave an hearty AMEN. This being then the portion of Scripture which
was read, and whereof he so took hold before his death, I have now made
choice of at this time, after his death, to expound.

Next, with this Text, and him who uttered these words, to wit, old Simeon,
this Reverende late Praelate most fitly in these things is found to symbolize:
1. Simeon was an old man; and so the Lord honored him, in whose Funeral
Commemoration these words are handled, with many years, and a full age, which
is a Crown of Glory, being found in the way of Righteousness. 2. Simeon was
a devote and just man; and so was this Religious Praelate, adorned both with
Piety and Equity; devote toward God in his worship of Him, and just
toward men in his dealinges with them. 3. Simeon was of good report amongst
his people; and so was this worthy Praelate, as Paull wills a Bishop to be,
of good report, even amongst those that were without* and of a singular both
great respect and good report amongst them that were within, both in Church and
Policy. 4. Simeon was a Priest in the Jewish Church; so this Venerable and
Honorable Man was a Praelate in the Christian Church; advanced to that top of
Eminency, for his life and learning* worth and wisdom, godliness and
gravitie. 5. Simeon now stricken in age* having gotten a sight of the LORD'S
Salvation, desired to depart in peace; Even so this Reverend and Glorified
Praelate, being also stricken in age, having not only gotten himself a
sight of the LORD'S Salvation; but also having given, by his many years
preaching, a sight thereof to others; at last having finished his course with
joye, he desired likewise to depart in peace, and be with his LORD. Of whose
blameless life, sound literature, vigilant care, sober conversation, good
behavior, hospital heart, (all relucent Virtues requisite in a Bishop)
besides his kyndnesse and cowrage, prudence and patience, worth and other
Virtues, rare parts, and just praises; seeing my Reverend Colleagues which
went before, have more amply discoursed, ne ligna in sylvas feram; and that my
Speech seem not to wrong, by a ruder rehearsal, and needless tautologie,
what so truly and worthily has been already spoken, I can not but
abruptly end; deploring the loss which both Church and Commonwealth
sustayneth in him* who (as ye all know) was borne honorably, lived amongst
us piouslie, preached the Truth powerfullie, mayntayned the same
courageously, ruled in this Church prudentlie, died at last most comfortablie,
and now rests (we hope) with CHRIST JESUS in Glory aeternallie: To whom,
with the Father, and the holy Spirit, be ascribed all Honor, Glory,
Majesty, Praise, Power, and Dominion, for ever and ever, world without end:
AMEN.

I Have made choice, this day, of this Text, Introduction.
both that I may aedifie you in Holiness, I. Our purpose.
and that I may perform that duty, and pay that debt, which I owe to the
Virtues, and Memory, of our Holy, Reverend, and Worthy Praelate, of blessed
memory.

The holy Prophet Moses, in praeceeding verses, in this now read, and in some
following after, II. Intention of GODS Spirit here
sets down the direction of GOD, concerning the Holy Vestments of Aaron,
and his sons, who were to succeed him in the Office of the high Priest.
Dignity o^ the high Priests Vestments and their signification.
Glorious were those Vestments; giving the high Priest more than a humane
splendour. Glorious, 1. considered in themselves, and with reference to the high
Priests Dignity, and one of the most precious things in the world; highly
esteemed, and most carefully kept by the Jews, as you may see at length in
Josephus. Whence Jesus, ^oseph. l. 15. Antiq. 14.
the son of Syrach, speaking of this, ( Eccles. 45.7.) says, that God
beautified or blessed the high Priest, with comely Ornaments; and clothed him
with a Robe of glory. He put upon him perfect glory; and strengthened him
with rich Garments. And verse. 13. Before him there were none such: neither did
any stranger ever put them on; but only his children, and his childrens
children, perpetually. 2. Much more precious yet were they in respect of their
signification; which was, 1. of the incompable excellencies of Christ Jesus,
that great high Priest for ever, who is the end of the Law, adorned with all
perfections, whereby he is to GOD most acceptable, and most venerable to us.
2. Of the excellency required in those of that place, whether under the Law,
or under the Gospel; which challenges greater perfection. That (says Beda)
which outwardly did shine in the Ornaments of the Priestlie Vestmentes, Beda.
should inwardly be deeply seated in the mynds of our Priests; being
spirituallie understood; and should outwardly shine glorious in their actions,
above the ordinary virtues of the faithful. It is not anough for them, to be
like unto other men, though good: for the Priestlie Authority (says Ambrose)
requires a singular weight of virtues, Ambros. Lib. 1. Ep. 6.

Nazian. Orat. 20.

and a most serious endeavor thereunto. So Greg. Nazianzen, speaking of saint
Basil, says, that he accounted the virtue of a private man, to stand in
fleeing of evil, and attayning to some degree of goodness: But that it is
blameable in a Praelate, not to be excellent; since even by his excellency
scarce can he draw people to a mediocritie of virtue. The Christian Church
has thought it good, to enjoyne her Priests, even an outward habit, and
conversation, differing from that of others: But much more different, and much
more excellent, should be the inward disposition, and virtues of their mind,
which is before God of great price. Let the Priests be clothed with Salvation;
and the Sayncts shall shout for joye. PSALM. cxxxij.16.

In the words which I have read, II. The first part.
a singular piece of this holy Vestment is commanded to be made; to wit, the
plate of the holy Crown, I. Of the holy Crown, what it was.
having this inscription, HOLINESS TO THE LORD. Let us consider, 1. The Crown
it self: 2. The inscription of it. The accomplishment of this commandment
here concerning it, is set down, EXODUS xxxix.30. And they made the plate of
the holy Crown of pure gold, and wrote thereon a writing like to the
ingraving of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD. SO LEVIT. viij.9. And he put the
Mitre on his head: also upon the Mitre, even upon his forefront, did he put
the golden plate, the holy Crown, which the Lord commanded Moses. ECCLESIAST.
xlv.12. He set a crown of gold upon the mitre, wherein was engraven HOLINESS;
an ornament of honor, a costly work, the desire of the eyes, goodly and
beautiful. Here it is called a plate of gold, EXODUS 29. a crown of holinsse,
(...). It was, as it were, a semicircle, from the one ear, to the other, upon
the forefront of the mitre, tied behind with a blew lace, EXODUS xxviij.37. And
thou shall put it on a blew lace, that it may be upon the mitre: upon the
forefront of the mitre it shall be. Josephus says, that beside the ordinary
Cap of the Priests, the high Priest had another, which a golden crown did
compass, Joseph. lib. ^ Antiq. cap. ^*
in a threefold order. His words are these; The high Priests Hat was such as
the other Priests used; on which there stood another sewed thereunto, and
flowrished with Hyacynthyn. This, after a triple order, was environed with a
golden crown, in which there were diverse vessels of gold, made after such a
sort as may be seen in that herb which we call Daccharus; and amongst the
Grecian Herbalists, Henbane. But the Scripture, though very exact in the
description of these garments, mentions no such thing. Howsoever, the plate
was the ornament, and, as it were, the crown of the high Priests crown. And
indeed it was a kind of crown covering a good part of the head, from the one
ear, to the other before, upon the Mitre.

A Crown was appointed, to adorn the head, the most eminent, II. What
signifies a Crown.
and most absolute part of the body; to declare, that it signified the
greatest and most excellent thing. No greater thing amongst men, than Virtue;
and the reward thereof, Honor, as the Philosopher calls it. Arist. lib. 4.
de moribus. cap. 17.
Therefore a Crown was used, to signify Holiness, Ingine and Learning,
Cowrage and Victory, and finally, high Dignities, Joy, and Felicity
therein. All this was signified by a Crown. Hence whatsoever in life is
perfect, and excellent, even the top, end, consummation, and perfection of
every thing is so called. He that says a Crown, says all this. Ecclesiasticus
1.2. The fear of the Lord is Honor, and Glory, Gladness, and a Crown of
rejoicing Ecclesiasticus 25.6. Much experience, is the Crown of old men; and
the fear of God, is their glory. Pliny says, that a Crown was not given of
old to any, Plin lib. 16. cap. ^.
but to GOD. The Hebrew Doctors make a three-folde Crown, of Kingdom, of
Knowledge, and of Priesthood. Of which last we are now more particularly to
speak.

This Crown was given to the high Priest by God; 1. Because he was a type of
Christ, III. What signified this Crown of Priesthood Clem. Alex. lib. 5.
^^^om. p. 241.
who is not only a Priest, but also a King; a King, whose Kingdom is ^n
everlasting Kingdom, and whose dominion has no end. DAN. vij.14. And this is
marked by Clem. Alexandr. who says, that the golden Hat of the high Priest,
exalting him, did signify (...), the Royal power of our Lord. 2. To signify
the dignity of his priestlie Office, and the excellency or Crown of Virtues,
wherewith such should be adorned, both then and now. For if the dignity of high
Priests was so great under the Old Testament, and their Virtues answerable
thereunto; how much greater is the dignity of Priesthood under the New
Testament, and of Virtues required to it? 2. COR. 3.7. If the ministration of
death written and engraven in stones, was glorious, etc. how shall not the
ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious?

For clearing this, it shall not be amiss, shortly to look to the Crown of
all faithful Christians. IV. Crown of Christians.
W^ find in the ancient Monumentes of the Christian Church, that all
Christians after Baptism were crowned. This ceremony indeed was not used
before Tertullian, nor in his time, as appears by his book de corona
militis. Yet was it in use in the time of Nazianz. as appears by his 23
Oration; where he desires Hero the Philosopher, to come to him, Nazianz.
Orat. 23.

Elias Cre^ens* indeed interprets him there otherwise.

Severus Alex. de Baptismo, and elevant baptizatos ad altar eisque dan^
mysteria Eucharistiam, and sertis coronat eos Sacerdos. Ord^ confirmat.
secu^dum usum Ethiopum: Domine Pater, bone and sancte, qui coronasti servos
tuos, corona qu^ non corrumpitur, benedic eis, qui dignos (...) fecisti, qui
eas imponeremus capitibus famulorum tuonum, ut sint eis corona honoris and
glori^, Amen. Corona benedistionis and s^lutis, etc:


that he might crown him. So Orat. 40. So Chrysostom. Homil. ad baptizatos,
concerning the virtue of Baptism. Severus Alexand. lib. de Baptismo, most
playnlie expresses it. So the form of Baptism, according to the form of the
Ethiopians. All Christians are (...), a Royal Priesthood. 1. PET. 2.9. Nothing
is so Royal, says Leo, Sermon. 3. in annivers. die suae assumptionis, as that
our souls being subject to GOD, should rule the body: Nothing more Priestlie,
than to consecrate to GOD a clean conscience, and to offer to Him unspotted
sacrifices of piety, upon the Altar of our heart. Unspeakable is the matter of
joye that we have, through the benefit of Baptism: we are fred thereby from
the servitude of Satan. Nazianz. Orat. 40. (...).
Therefore says Tertullian, When one is baptized, the Devil perceaveth him
plan^ libera^^m, truly delivered out of his hands. And Nazianzen calls
Baptism, a freeing of us from servitude. Yea, by it we are advanced, not
only to Liber^ie, but also to the Dignity of GODS Children: for it is the
washing of the new birth, Chrysostom. ^omil. ad Neophyt.
TIT. iij.5. Hence Chrysostom. By Baptism we become free: and not only free,
but also righteous; Op^at^^ Mi^^vit. lib. 5. co^tra Parm.

Nazianz. Orat. 40. (...).


and not only that, but also Children: and not only Children, but also Heyrs:
and not only Heyrs, but also the Brethren of CHRIST, and joynt-Heyres with Him.
Hence also another of the Ancients calls Baptism Coelestis Regni
comparationem, the obtaining of the heavenly Kingdom. By it CHRIST becomes
our Crown. In that day, the LORD of Hosts is unto us for a Crown of Glory,
Clement Ale^. lib. 2. Ped^g. ^. 8. (...). Chrysostom. homil. ad Neophyt^s.
Clemens Alex. lib. 2. Ped^g. c. ^.
and for a Diadem of Beauty, ISAI 28.5. And we by it obtain a title to the
incorruptible Crown of Glory; which undoubtedly we shall receive, if we,
as a Royal Priesthood, or Priestlie Kings, fight valiantly the Battles of the
LORD. This is that Crown of life, which the LORD has promised to them that
love Him, IAM. 1.12. Which none gets, but he that stryveth lawfully, 2.
TIM. 2.5. And which every one receaveth, that does so. Be thou faithful unto
the death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life* REV. 2.10. This is that
incorruptible Crown, 1. COR. 9.26. And which fades not, 1. PET. 5.4. The
beautiful Crown of Amaranthus, says Clemens Alex* is laid up for him that
does well: it is Heaven alone, and not the earth, that can bring forth this
Flower. This only Flower fades not, and hence has this name* To this purpose
Sever. before cited, says, that at this Ceremony, Plin. lib. ^2. cap. 8.
the prayer was, The Lord make you worthy of His heavenly Kingdom; Post qu^^
desecer^ cu^^cti flores* madefactu^ aqua revivisc^, and hyberna coronas facit,
summa eju^ nature in nomine est, appellato quonia^ ^^n marcescit.
and in stead of this corruptible crown, crown you with the Crowns of
Righteousness and good works. To signify and remember these things was this
Crown given to all Christians.

cowrage, and hope, be so great; how much more is it with the spiritual
rulers, whose duty is to lead and bring them to the Crown? According to the
ancient phrase, all Christian Bishops are summi Sacerdotes, high Priests:
albeit in the third Council of Carthage this Title was forbidden, because by
some abused, to cherish their ambition. Great is their pre-eminence, great and
many their battles; wherein if they acquyte themselves worthily, there
abides them a far more glorious Crown, than others, 1. PET. 5.4. The
Civicke Crown, or Garland, was much esteemed of amongst the Romans. Plin.
calls it, the most notable testimony of military virtue: yet was it given
for the saving of one. How much then was the Crown to be esteemed, which was
called Graminea, given for the safety of the whole Army? Plin. Such a Crown
belongs to a faithful Bishop. He not only saves his own soul, but the
souls of many. They that turn many to righteousness, shall shine as the
stars, for ever and ever, DAN. 12.3. What more Divine thing can there be,
than to be a worker with GOD, in procuring the salvation of men, for whom the
Blood of CHRIST was shed? Of all Divine Perfections, (says that old Writer
that goes under the name of Dionysius the Areopagite) it is the most Divine,
to be GOD'S Fellow-worker; especially in so Divine a work, as is the saving
of souls. What advantageth it a man, to gain the whole world, if he lose
his soul? There can be nothing aequalled to the soul, (says Chrysostom)
in the whole world: Chrysostom. hom. 3. in Ep. 5. ad Corinth*
and therefore says he, Though thou would give huge riches to the poor,
yet should thou do more, by converting one soul. How glorious a thing had
it been for a man, to have been a worker with GOD in the framing of this
world! Chrysostom. Hom. 55. ad popul. Antioch.
But (to apply to our purpose the words of that same golden mouth) GOD gives
a greater honor to Pastors; to whom He says, as it were, I have made Heaven
and Earth; but I give thee power to make Earth Heaven: Ammian. Marc. l. 29.
^ap. 25. (...) sign^ and co^onam (...) interce erat nihil (...).
I have made clear Lights; but make thou more clear: thou can not make a
man; but thou may make him gracious, and acceptable unto Me. Hence they are
said to save, JUDE* 23. 1. COR. 9.22. 1. TIM. 4.16. IAM. 5.25. Thus ye see
that Christian Bishops have their Crown, and that precious. Their outward
Crown, though old, can not be compared unto it: it is but a small
resemblance thereof.

If any man will strain the words farther, and labor to find the Pope's
triple Crown of Gold here, his travel will be lost: For that is exalted
not only above the Church, but also above the Crowns of Kings, directly, or
indirectlie: and the inscription (as if that of Christ's Vicar were too base)
is a Monarch, a Spiritual King: so Cajet. Cathar. and Salmer. speak, says
Lorinus. Yea, and as if this were too small, he is entitled, The sole
Emperor in the world. Neither stay they here; he is to his flatterers, Vice
Deus: Omnipotentiae Pontificiae Conservator: another God, as it were, and
conserver of the Papal Omnipotency: and, in a word, Optimum, Maximum,
sempi^ernum Numen in terris, as Stapleton calls him. This Crown of our high
Priest, was only the Crown of Pristhood; and no inscription in it, but
Holiness to the Lord. Who, I pray you, gave the Pope such a crown? Christ? His
own Kingdom was not of this world, JOHN 18.36. And all that He promised to
S. Peter, was to give him the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven. HE is now
indeed crowned with Glory and Honor; but on earth was crowned with Thorns*
Did saynct Peter wear a Crown of Gold, who said truly, Gold and Silver I
have none? It is saynct Bernard's argument. Bernard, a consideratio^ne ad
Eug^^nium, lib. 3* cap. 2.
Though the Churches estate then had been most prosperous, would saynct Peter
have worn such a Crown, who would not have his head vpwardes upon the Cross
whereunto he was nailed, as was the head of his Savior? Hier. in Petr^.
But Constantine, they say, gave this Crown of Gold, and the earthly power
with it, unto Silvester, Lauren^. Valla, de d^^^atione Con^stanti^.
and his successoures. This of all Fables the most impudent, has been long
since solidlie confuted. Yea, more, I am persuaded, that those holy Fathers,
and blessed Martyrs, that first did hold that Sea, would not have accepted of
such an offer, though it had been made. The Crown they thought upon, was the
Crown of Martyrdom. They thought deeply upon Christ His Crown of Thorns.
If Godfray of Bulloyg^e, proclaimed King in Jerusalem, refused a Golden
Crown, because Christ there had worn a Crown of Thorns; what would they
have done? By that Crown of Thorns, says Gregory Nazianzen, Nazianz* Orat.
25.

Cl^m. Alex. lib. 2. Pa^. cap. ^


I have learned to crown my self with severitie of life. So Clemens Alexand*
says, we ought not to have so much as a Crown of Flowers, since our Lord
was crowned with Thorns. What would these, and the rest of the holy Fathers
say, if they did now see the Papal Crown* Yet even they are called to be
witnesses of this earthly Crown, and Monarchy. But we might write upon
their Statues, as some did upon that of Brutus: when Caesar usurped in Rome the
like superiority, S^et^n* in ^ita Iulii C^sari^.
Vtinam viveretis; O that you were alive. Yea, they live, and by their writs
proclayme alowde with ESAI, 25.1. Woe to the crown of pride. They cry to all
that have ears to hear, That the Crown of the greatest Prelate then, was
this holy Crown, wherein was engraven, HOLINESS TO THE LORD: the inscription
which now we come to.

And grave upon it like the ingraving of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.
III.
HEre is the second part, the ingraving upon this Crown, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.
This was not lightly insert, 1. The second principal part.
but engraven, EXODUS 39.30. and that with the ingraving of a Signet, Scriptura
distincta, says the Chaldean interpreter, that it might be easily and
clearlie read. The inscription.
Josephus seems to think, that GOD'S NAME was only engraven here: (...)
On the same (says he) there was as it were a band of Gold, on which the
NAME of GOD was engraven. So Philo; Unto this Crown (says he) was prefixed
a Golden Plate, Ios^p. antiq. lib. 3. cap. 8. Philo lib. 3. de vita Mosis.

Hierom. (...) Exodus 28.


having four small letters engraven in it. So Hierome also. It may be said,
that they exclude not the ingraving of Holiness, when they mention the
ingraving of GOD'S NAME. If their words admit this exposition, it is well* but
though they would not receive it, yet the words of holy Scripture are so
clear, that I make no doubt to think with others, Sal^ian^, ^nn. M. 2544.
n^m. ^61.
that both this Great NAME of GOD* (...) and HOLINESS^ also was engraven* Let
us therefore speak shortly, 1. of this Great NAME; and 2. of the Holiness
whereupon chiefelie we intend to insist.

The NAME of GOD engraven here, 2. Gods ineffable Name
is that GREAT NAME, which the Jews called Secret, or Wonderful, JUDGE.
xiij.18. Josephus speaking of Moses, says, Joseph* lib. ^. antiq. cap. 5.
That GOD declared unto him His proper Name, before unknown to men; Whereof
(says he) it is not lawful for me to speak. Philo says, Philo, lib. 3.
de vit^ Mosis.
that this Name is called INEFFABLE; because it is lawful for them only that
are purged by wisdom, to hear and name it in Divine Service* and to none
else. Naz. orat* 36. page 589.
Greg. Nazianz. says, that it was in great veneration amongst the Jews, and
Ineffable. So Theodoret. Theod. quaest 15 in Exodus
This Name amongst the Jews is called Ineffable; and they forbid the
pronouncing of it. Hierom. Epist. 136.
So Hierome calls it (...): and in like manner do others, both Greek and
Latin Fathers, speak of it. But whatsoever be the pronouncing of it,
Chryso^t. hom. 1. co^tra A^^^aos.
whereupon it is not pertinent for us to stay, thus much can not be denied,
that it signifies GOD'S BEING, and that as perfectly as can be. No name can
perfectly express GOD; because of the infiniteness of His nature. We are
but men, and therefore can not speak of GOD, but with an humane tongue. Naz.
orat* ^9.
Will thou ask (says Nazianz. what is GOD, which neither the eye has seen,
nor the ear has heard, nor has entered into the heart of man? Why desire
thou that to be expressed by the tongue, which the heart can not conceive?
Truly, GOD is such a Thing, that when It is said, can not be said; and
when It is esteemed, can not be esteemed; and when defined, ipsa definitione
crescit. Tertull. lib. de Tri^it* cap. 7.
That which is (says Tertull. or whosoever was author of the Book De
Trinitate, ascrybed to him) according to that which It is* can neither be
expressed by humane speech, Di^^^s. ^. 1. de Divi^. (...)
nor perceaved by humane ears, nor be taken up by humane sense. We can not
conceive GOD, but imperfectlie, or confusedly: and our knowledge is the
fountain, and obstetrix sermonis, that which brings forth our speech. Yet
have we no name that more expresslie and distinctlie signifies GOD, than that
which is here: for it signifies such a one that is per essentiam, by His
Essence, and from none other; whose Being never began, Hilar. Lib 1 de Trinit.
nor shall end; in whom is nothing bypast, or to come; no vicissitude, or
change; but such a One, as is aeternall, being All at once, the Fountain and
original of all Being; containing in Himself united* and eminentlie
whatsoever can be. Thus it explayneth the Divine Essence, the ground of all
Divine Perfections: so that no name can manifest it more inwardly, or better.
Hence the LORD being demanded of Moses, concerning His Name, EXODUS 3.14.
answed. I AM that I am: thus shall thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM
has sent me unto you. And EXODUS 6.2. he groundeth his veracitie or fidelity
upon this; And GOD spoke unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord: and I
appeared unto Abraham, Isaac, and to Jacob, by the Name of GOD ALL-MIGHTIE,
((...)) but by My NAME JEHOVAH was I not known unto them. That is, I so
appeared unto them, that I did show, that I was able to give the land of Canaan
unto them; and so, that I was, (...) GOD ALL-MIGHTIE; but by this Name JEHOVAH
was I not known unto them; for then did I not perform My Promise: but now
shall ye know, by the effect, the power of this NAME; even that I AM* and that
I give being to my Promises; calling the things that are not, as if they were.
That which I have promised, and which heretofore I have declared to be
possible to me, I will now reallie perform; and so will show my self to be
JEHOVAH. Most justly then is GOD called by this Name, which signifies BEING:
For not only gives He Being to His Promises, and to all things else that
have any being; but also in respect of His Infiniteness, He contains in
Himself all perfection of Being. He is Independentlie; He is Aeternallie;
containing and filling all Duration, Revel. 1.8.16.5. He is Immenselie,
containing and filling all space. He is Universally, containing Formallie, or
Eminentlie, all that is. He is the Fullness of Being. Whatsoever Goodness,
Beauty, Perfection, or Being, is in the creature, is in Him infinitely more
perfectly, and fully.

This Being is so proper to Him, that all other things compared to Him, are
not: they are nothing, Aug. Trac. de eo quod dictum est* Ego sum etc.
but in so far as they are from Him, and in Him: for of Him, and through Him,
and to Him, are all things, ROMANS 11.36. ISAI. 40.17. All nations before Him
are as nothing, and they are counted to Him less than nothing, and vanity.
The Ethnickes saw this darkly; and therefore Plato called GOD (...). Hence
Nazianzen calls Him the infinite and unbounded Ocean of Essence: and says,
Seneca* Epist. 37.
that He only has no name, and yet all names. All, because all are contained
in Him: and yet He is said to be none of these; because He is above all
things which we can conceive. Well, therefore, was this Great and Glorious
Name put here, to ground His Holiness, to crown and protect all the beauty
of the high Priest, as saynct Hierome marketh; and to signify, Hieron. Ep. ad
Pabi^^^m.
both to high Priest, and to us, that in Him, and by Him, we live, and have
our being; which is Philo's observation. Thus having adored HIS GREAT NAME,
we come to consider HIS HOLINESS.

Holiness.
HOLINESS was engraven, together with GOD'S NAME, Holiness.
for three causes, (as it is well observed by Cajetan^) 1. To show, that GOD is
Holy in Himself, against those that think vnreverentlie of the Divine
Nature, and ascrybe to it things unbeseeming One that is infinitely pure. 2.
To show, that HOLINESS is in all His works* against those that are bold to
open their mouth to accuse His Providence, and Government. 3. To show, that it
should be in all things that have reference to Him* as well the inward
motions of the mind, as outward actions, sacrifices, and oblations; against
those that are profane. This order we shall follow; and therefore, (by GOD'S
Grace) for opening up of this point, we shall show you, that HOLINESS
belongs to the LORD; 1. Considered in Himself: 2. Considered in His works*
and ways: 3. Considered with reference to those that serve Him, especially
that are Priests, or high Priests. For clearing of the first branch we will,
1. show, what is HOLINESS; and then we shall apply it to GOD, considered in
Himself.

The first Branch. IV.
HOLINESS and HALOWING, says Aug. is not altogether of one kind: Meat and
drink are sanctified by the word and prayer, 1. TIM. 4.5. notwithstanding
whereof they go into the draught, I. What is Holiness. Aug. Ser. 14 de
^empere, Lib. 2. de piece. merit. and remiss^ Cap. ^6.
and are cast out. We learn therefore, says he there, that there is some
kind of Holiness, and, as it were, a shadow of Sanctification; which is not
sufficient for attayning Salvation. Thus, says he, the unfaithful husband
is sanctified by the faithful wife. 1. COR. 7.14. Yet may he not therefore
be secure, as if he could come to life not baptized, and not renewed. In like
manner speaks he there of the Holiness of the children of the faithful,
not baptized. But to leave this, for taking up the nature of true Holiness,
we are to mark, 1. That Holiness formally is Purity, and cleanness of
affection, in respect of sin, contrary to the impuritie and filthiness
thereof, 2. COR. 7.1. Let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of the
flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. Purity then it is
whereby the blot and spot of sin is taken away. Therefore that learned and
ancient Writer who goes under the name of Dionys. Areopag. defining Holiness,
says, Dionys. Areopag. cap. 12. de Divin, Nom,
that it is Purity altogether unspotted, fully perfect, and free of all
sin. 2. Observe, that this purity of the mind, and perfection thereof in
our thoughts, affections, words, and actions, can not be had, except our
minds and affections, be conform to GOD, the Supreme PURITY; the
participation of whom alone makes pure. Hence Gregory Nazianzen descrybeth
Holiness, to be a conversing with GOD. Greg. Na^zianz. (...) 2. page 20^
3. Consider that this conformity can not be had, except these thoughts,
affections, and actions, be conform to GOD'S aeternall Law, the supreme Rule
of their perfection. As the conception of the mind of GOD, or Idaea, is the
rule of natural perfection; so His aeternall Law is rule to all perfection
supernatural. His own nature and essence is the prime, and original source,
of all both natural and supernatural perfection. Thence aryseth, according to
our conceaving, His Law aeternall: I say, according to our manner of
conceaving: for otherwise it being nothing else but the rectitude and
strayghtnesse of His Divine reason; is in effect nothing else but His own
essence, or Himself. From all this follows, that he is Holy, and
perfectly Holy, who is so conform to GOD, that his thoughts, affections*
and actions, are perfectly conform, and justly answerable to His aeternall
Law. Not then that which we will, is holy, wherewith Augustine vpbraydeth
the Donatistes; but that which is agreeable to the Law of GOD. Hence also
appears, that besides the moral goodness which is in our virtues, there is
a goodness of holiness, which consists in convenientia cum natura
rationali, in agreement with reason. But this ryseth up higher, and stands in
a conformity with that good, perfect, holy, and acceptable will of GOD, ROMANS
12. With this description of Holiness, agrees that of saynct Basil, wherein
he says, that Holiness imports Purity, Basil. de Spir. Sanct. Cap. ^.
from all bodily and material taynting, and freedom from composition. To it
also agrees the Hebrew KADASH, signifying to separate: whence KADOSH, that
which is separated from things unclean and profane, as also the Greek
(...), which Hesychius expounds (...), pure; as he does (...) also. Thus
we have laid the ground; let us now apply it, and see how this Holiness is
in GOD Himself. How God is holy in Himself.


HOLINESS belongs to GOD, considered in Himself, other ways than to us,
and far more excellently. As is His Being, so is His Holiness. Now His
Being, 2. Holiness essential (...) GOD.
as we have shown, is every way perfect; having nothing of not-being,
nothing of imperfect being; but altogether full, absolute, and infinite. It is
so with His Holiness, which will more clearlie appear by these following
considerations: First, His Holiness is not accidental to Him, as ours. His
Divine will and manners are conform to His aeternall Law, essentiallie, and
from within. By Himself, and by His own essence, is He holy: albeit
according to our manner of conceaving His aeternall Law, the purity and love
in His mind and will arise from His essence; yet indeed His purity is nothing
else, but His own essence, as it has ratione^ voluntatis: and so He is not
only holy, but Holiness it self. For purity of affection, wherein
Holiness stands, is nothing else, but the love of GOD. Now GOD is love, 1.
JOHN 4.8.16. This no creature is* nor can be: all their holiness is by some
thing supernatural added to nature. Hence no creature by nature can be
vnpeccable, or free of possibility of sinning. I know, some Schoolmen
think, that a creature even by nature vnpeccable, is possible. But far
truly it is mayntayned by others. Durand. ^* Did. 23. Qua^t. 1.
That no reasonable creature can be made (...), free of liberty and power of
sinning. Thom. part. 1. quaest. 63. Scotus, 2. distinct. 23. quaest. 1. Aug.
Lib. 1^ de Civitat^ D^s* cap. 1.
Augustine proves the mutabilitie to evil that is in the creature, from this,
that it is made of nothing. We say (says he) that there is not an
unchangeable, good, but the one, true, blessed GOD; and that these things which
He has made are good; because from Him, yet mu^^bili^, quod (...) de illo,
sed de nihilo facta sunt, changeable, because not made of Him, but of nothing.
To this same purpose speaks Gregor. Nyssen. This reason extends it self
not only to the things which are, (...) opific. ho^inis, cap. 16.
but also to all that are possible; for those also should be made of nothing.
So Immortality is a proper attribute of GOD, 1. TIM. 6.16. and can not by
nature belong to any creature. (...). de fi^. lib. 3. cap. 2.

Elia^ Cretens. Orat. 4. N^^.


Now this in the phrase of Ambrose, and other Ancientes, is an impossibility
to die by sin.

From this it follows, That His Holiness is a substance, 3. His Holiness
substantial.
as His will, power, etc. whereas that of the creature is but a quality, and
comprehends many acts of the understanding and will. There must be in the
understanding, light of faith, or glory; in the will, religion, charity, and
other virtues, praevious, or subservient thereunto. The Grace of GOD serving to
this effect, is manifold* 1. Pet. 4.10.

Thirdly; His Holiness is independent, and that from which our holiness
many ways depends: 4. Our holiness depends from it many ways.
^. Ours depends from Him, and His Holiness, as from the original and
efficient. His Divine Essence is the root and fountain of all Holiness and
Purity in the creatures. It is He that infuseth grace in Angels and men, that
converteth us unto Himself* and purges our sins, Heb. 1.3. and washes us,
Revel. 1.5. and gives us both the light of faith, and all other supernatural
graces: Every good gift, and every perfect gift, is from Above; and comes
down, from the Father of Lights, Iam. 1.17. Levit. 20.8. I am the LORD, which
sanctifies you. 2. Our holiness depends from Him, as from the object; for
it stands in love of Him, and in conjunction with him. Holiness is Purity:
and therefore, as impuritie aryseth from the touch of things unclean,
bodily, or spiritual; so purity from cleaving and adhering of the affection
to things that are clean. Now, of all such, the most pure is OOD: He is
Light, and there is no darkness in Him at all, 1. John 1.5. Where He is not,
nothing is clean; where He is, nothing unclean. Therefore, Holiness is
called by saynct Peter, (Chap. 2. verse. 1.4.) a participation of the Divine
nature. 3. Which follows hence, our holiness depends from Him, and His
Holiness as from the Rule. He has none, to whom He should conform
Himself: but, on the contrary, His eternal Law, which is Himself, because
nothing else, but the rectitude of His Divine Reason, is the Rule and Exemplar,
to which all should be conform, that would be holy, Levit. 11.44. Ye shall
be holy, for I am holy. And Chap. 19.2. And Chap. 20.7. 1. Pet. 1.16. 4. It
depends from Him, as from the end. All holiness of the creature, is
directed to the praise of the glory of His Grace, Ephesians. 1.6. as to the end.
And therefore is every one sanctified, that is holy; that he may cleave to
God, as to his last end: honor, praise, and glorify Him: For of Him, and
through Him, and to Him, are all things: To whom be glory for ever, Amen.
Romans 11.36.

Fourthlie: His Holiness is altogether infinite. 1. Intensiuelie: for He
loves Himself, 5. His Holiness is infinite, intensiuelie, and extensiuelie.
as much as He is lovely; and as great purity is there in His love, as in
the perfection of His essence. He loves the creature indeed, but for
Himself: and therefore most holy in the love of all; in the which He does
not stay, or rest, but in the infinite excellency of His own goodness. 2.
Extensiuelie^ that extends it self to infinite things; for all that He
sees in His essence, He loves: all these please Him for Himself, and for
His glory. So His Holiness is a perfection, infinitely lifted up above ours;
superessentiall, and the infinite fullness of Holiness. In regard of it, all
holiness in the creature, how sublime soever, is as it were nothing; yea, and
as it were impuritie; even as all power, wisdom, beauty, and excellency,
compared to His Power, Wisdom, etc. is as nothing. Hence His solemn Style is
THE HOLY ONE, Esai. 1.4.10.20.17.7.29.19.30.11.12.31.1. etc. Hence the
Seraphims cry, Isai. 6. HOLY, HOLY, HOLY; and the four Beasts, Revel. 4.8.
rest not day and night, Council. Vasense. Tam dulcis and desiderabilis v^x,
etiamsi die noctuque possit d^ci, fastidium non poterit g^nerare.
saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD GOD All-mightie, which was, and (...), and
is to come. Which Song the Church from most ancient times most devoutlie has
used in her Service: So sweet and so desirable a voice is this, that it could
not breed loathing, though it were uttered both day and night, say the Fathers
in an ancient Council.

6. GOD'S goodness, in beholding our impuritie, admired. Gr^g. lib. 5. moral*
quasi quaedam restis animae caro est: and this garment, says he, habet tinca^
suam, quia ab ipsa carnalis tent^tio oritur ex qua laceratur. Nyss. de opefic.
hominis, cap. 16. Naz. orat. 26. (...). Aug. de perfecti^ne justitia cui bonum
esse, h^c est ipsum esse: therefore alone good. Luke 18.19
Hence appears how wonderful is His Goodness, that any ways accepts us
dwelling in tabernacles of clay, and defiled not only with the dust of
earthly things, but also with the filth of sin. The Heavens are not clean
in His sight; and His Angels He charge with folly, Job 15.15. and 4.18. The
Seraphims cover both^ their faces and feet before Him, Isai. 6. If those
heavenly spirits, free from all bodily tainture, attain not to the purity
which His service might require, how can we, so far inferior to them,
whose foundation is in the dust, whose flesh is as it were a mothie garment,
who dwell continually as it were, and are trained up in sin, as Gregor.
Nyssen. speaks, be pleasant in His sight? When all is said of the perfection
of our holiness, that can be truly said, when we are propter excellentiam
vitae, Greg. lib. 12. moral. cap. 17. called the Heavens, ye^ are we not
clean in His sight, infinitely yet are we distant from that most sublime
Light, whereof the most pure light here is but a small ray and beam. It is
much for any created nature, how pure soever, to draw near any way to Him
that is only bright, and shyning, and in purity exceeds all bodily and
spiritual nature; whose Goodness is His very Being, as August* speaks.
Notwithstanding, so marvelous is His goodness, that He calls us undefiled
and fair* holy and without blame before Him in love, and makes us accepted
in the Beloved, Ephesians. 1.4.6. And thus much of Holiness belonging to GOD, as
considered in Himself. I come now to the second Branch, which is Holiness
belonging to Him, considered in His works, and ways.

If we consider GOD in His ways, V. Holiness belongs to God, in respect of
His ways. 1. Degree. He neither does nor wills evil. Basil. homil. Quod
Deus non sit author mali. Faust. Rheg. 2. de great. cap. 3. Nec quarum rerum
ulto^ est DEVS, earu^ and author credendus est.

Ambros. hexam. lib. 1 cap. 8. Eusebius. 6. de preparatione, cap. 5.


Holiness belongs most perfectly to Him, PSALM. 145.17. The LORD is
righteous in all His ways, and holy in all His works. We shall lay this open
to you, in some measure, in these four degrees: The first, whether we
consider His works done by Himself alone, or with us, there is no blot to be
found therein, Psalm. 5.4. Thou art not a God that have pleasure in wickedness,
neither shall evil dwell with thee. Saynct Basil, in a Homily of this
subject, says, that it is as great an impiety, to affirm GOD to be the
cause of evil, as to say with the fool, There is no GOD, PSALM. 14.1. They
both deny GOD to be good: For if He be the cause of evil, says he, He
is not good; and if not good, then not GOD. GOD and Good are not so near in
name, as in nature. Therefore, says he, in both these there is (...), a
denial of GOD. He is not the author of those things, whereof He is the
revenger. To affirm the contrary, is feralis opionio, a detestable tenet,
says Ambrose. It is a most horrible injury against GOD, says Eusebius.
Therefore Plato commanded, that none should be permitted in the Commonwealth,
young or old, in sport, or earnest, to say, that GOD is the cause of evil.
All that He made, was good, GENESIS 1.31. And all that He makes, is so. He
neither does evil, nor desires it to be done; neither gives He strength
and concurrence for that end; neither any way approves He it when done-
Habak. 1.12.13. Art not Thou from everlasting, O LORD my GOD, my Holy One?
Thou art of purer eyes, than to behold evil, and (...) not look on
iniquity. And this is very true, not only of actual, but also of habitual
evil. False and absurd is it, Vasquez* Disp. 40. in promam secunda cap. 4
which some of the Schoolmen say, that GOD may immediately, and without
concurrence of the second cause, infound a vicious habit^ into the mind of
man. For such an habit, should be an habitual impelling and inclyning to an
evil act: See Gabriel Alvaret. in Isai, cap. 44. verse. ^^.
in respect whereof GOD might be said, to impe^^ and urge us to sin: which
is (...) contrary to His HOLINESS.

2. He wills not evil, in any condition, or for any end, how good soever.
The second degree is, GOD wills no Unholiness, in any condition; or for
any end. Evil actions, if proceeding from GOD, could not be allowed for
any end, how good soever. For a good end is not sufficient to make things
lawful, which are of themselus evil, and dishonest, Ro^. 3.8. Evil may not
be done, that good may come. And this is so true, that the good which
praesupponeth sin, is not desired by GOD of it self. It is not the final
cause of permitting of sin, but causa sine qu^ non. If sin be necessary
to the execution thereof, it can not be desired, nor intended, before sin.
Such a good is the remedy of sin, repentance the chastisementes of sin,
whether medicinal in this life, or of mere revenge in the life to come: the
exercise, and patience, and humiliation, of the Sayncts: the manifesting of
mercy, in pardoning, or of justice in punishing. All these, and the like,
which cannot be had without the interveaning of sin, GOD desires not of
themselves, neither seeks He occasion of doing them, before sin. Yea, of
Himself He desires that there were never occasion of any such good, though
sin being supponed, He desire and intend them; for then they have rationem
boni, and are desirable; and the execution of them may be without sin. Hence
He is said, to will them not voluntate antecedente, but consequente; which
takes occasion of us. Be it far, therefore, from us to say with some, that
He made our first Parents, hoc consilio vt laberentur, of purpose that they
might fall; because otherwise, say they, He could not attain to those
principal ends; the manifesting of his mercy, in saving some; and justice,
in punishing others: since He could not have mercy, but on the miserable; nor
justly condemn any, but sinners. Say not thou, It is through the Lord that I
fall away. For thou ought not to do things which He hates. Say not thou,
He has caused me to err: For He has no need of the sinful man,

Fulge lib. 1. (...).
say the Fathers of the second Arausican Council, Can. ult. that any man is
appointed to evil by the power of GOD; that on the contrary, if any will be
so bold, as to believe so great an evil, cum omni detestatione in illos
anathema dicimus; let such be most dreadfullie accursed. Justice it self
should be unjust, says Fulgentius, if it should not find, but make men
guilty, that so they might be punished.

The third degree is; All His affections and actions are so exactly conform to
the rectitude of His aeternall Law, 3. Degr^^ Impossi^^^ for GO^ either (...)

that there is no possibility in Him of such evil. For, first, His infinite
perfection can not stand with any possibility of sinful defect. All
apprehende GOD, as such a One, that nothing better can be conceaved: Yea, He
exceeds all good that can be comprehended by thought, or by understanding.
Nyssen. de Opisic. hominis, Cap. 16. Which should not be, if He were not out
of all danger of falling, and had liberty in respect of moral evil.
Secondly; GOD necessarily loves Himself, and all other things but
secondarilie, and with reference to Himself: Therefore can He not love any
thing, but that which is lovely, and which may be referred to His own
soveraygne goodness. Thirdly; Thom. p^^t* ^. q. 63. art. (...). in (...)*
As the rule cannot err, because of it self, it is right, and can not fall
from it self; But the hand may err; because not being it self a rule, it
may declyne from the rule, and not be conform to the outward direction
thereof: So any creature, because it is not the rule, may err: But GOD, who
is the rule, and can not deny Himself, is not subject to sin* or moral
error: it is impossible that He should do any thing amiss. It can not be,
that He can be the procurer or doer of any evil work, Tertull. lib. ^.
contra (...).
that takes to Himself, and justly, the Name of Perfect, Father, and Judge.
Light can not be changed into darkness, nor Goodness it self become wicked.
Wicked Martion, as crooked and perverse as his mind was, was affrayde to
ascrybe evil to the good GOD; and choosed rather geminare Deitatem, and to
divide it betwixt two; one good, and one evil. The Philosopher affirms
indeed, That GOD and good men may do evil things. ^ristotle 4. ^p. cap. 3.
But hardly can I think, that he speaks there according to his own mind;
but rather according to the common opinion of those amongst whom he lived.
Neither is this praejudiciall to the liberty of GOD. Possibility to do evil,
is not necessary thereunto. This is a weakness of created Free Will, which is
flexible to evil, and liable to defect: It is a blessed necessity, ^ag. 22.
d^ ^vit. DEI. ^p. ult.
whereby GOD can not be evil, as Augustine teaches us.

Not only can He not will or do evil; but also of necessity He hates it,
Degree.
and that with an infinite hatred. For, 1. since necessarily He loves the
rectitude of His aeternall Law, He hates vnholines, and that infinitely.
of necessity He must hate whatsoever is contrary thereunto: and such is all
sin. 2. He necessarily loves His goodness, and perfection of His nature:
and therefore must needs hate sin, which is repugnant, and contrary
thereunto; As darkness to Light, and deformity to Beauty, and crookedness
to Strayghtnesse, and defylment to Purity. The infiniteness of His hatred
appears, first, From that He depryveth a sinner for it, of an infinite good;
to wit, Himself. 2. To blot it out, He sent His own Son; both to take our
flesh, and to undergo death. 3. He for it inflicteth infinite sorrows, and
ignominy, even aeternall torments. And though one had innumerable good
works, yet for one grievous sin, He forgets them all, EZECH. 18. For one
sin, He thrust down from Heaven so many millions of Angels: He cared not
for their innumerable multitude, nor for their eximious beauty, nor for the
excellency of their nature, most nearlie resembling His; nor for their depth
of engine, pearcing and comprehending so many things; nor for that blessed
sight which should for ever have shyned in their mynds; or perfect love,
whereby they should have loved Him above all things: nor for the praise,
thankesgiving, and glory, which He should have had for ever, through saving
so many spirits. He cared not for all the evil which He knew could come
by their condemnation; their aeternall blasphemies, and contumelies, the fall
of man-kynde, and perverting of the whole world. So hateful infinitely to
His Holiness was sin, that passing by all these considerations* He did
stryke them immediately with the Thunderbolt of Condemnation. The like
terrible demonstration, of His infinite hatred of sin, may also be seen in
His dealing toward man. Hence ISAI vj. in that mystical vision, the
SERAPHIMS provoke Him as it were, to punishment of that wicked people, by a
threefolde compellation of His Holiness. What man should not be infinitely
punished by His Holiness for sin, if He were not restrained by His infinite
Mercy?

Hence clearlie may appear the error of those who teach, 5.
Praedetermination to evil, refuted.
That GOD by an absolute will, praedefyned and decreed from aeternitie, all
actions, and positive effects of the creatures, how wicked soever, so and so
to be done in particular, with all their circumstances: and, That accordingly
in time He moves, pusheth, and physicallie praedeterminateth them to those
effects: This praevious motion being such, that without it no creature can
do any thing: But it being present, they must needs do that whereunto it
carries them. This doctrine at once destroys both the Liberty of men, and
Sanctity of GOD. The first; For that praemotion, or praedetermination, is
independent from our liberty. It is not in our power, though it be simply
necessary to our actions, according to the authors thereof, when we have it
not; therefore we can not work, some necessary thing being deficient to us,
which GOD alone can give. If it be present, we must needs do that whereunto
it impelleth: and this necessity is antecedent, Anselm. lib. de ^^ncord.
prasci. and pradest. Cap. 1.
which playnlie overthrows Liberty, as Anselme observes. 2. It destroys
the Sanctity of GOD: For if He so move, push, and praedetermine, the will to
evil, that it can not do otherwise, nor in another manner, how can He be
more effectually, and powerfullie* the author of evil? Which is an horrible
blasphemy. To advyse, and command sin, should not make Him so truly and
effectually the author thereof, as by this doctrine He is made, according to
which He directly wills the evil act, and inwardly moves, applies, and
praedetermineth the will, that it may be done. Advyce and commandment move
only objectiuelie, and may be resisted: but this Praedetermination pearceth
the essence of the will, and inwardly frames it to work, so that no way it
can be resisted, or the work hindered.

If you say, 6. Evasions of the praedeterminants, refuted.
that GOD is to be esteemed in these actions, as a natural and necessary
cause, and not free, it is false: For He does nothing ad extra, without
Himself necessarily, but altogether freely: 2. If you say, that GOD wills
not that which is formal in sin, this is not sufficient: For by the
material of sin, whereunto they say GOD praedeterminateth, they understand
the actions, according to all the conditions, and circumstances, determining
and making it individual. Now, if GOD be the cause of this, inwardly
moving, and praedeterminating our wills, to consent thereunto* He must needs
also be the cause of that, which is formal. Hence, first, God forbids that
in sin, which is material; as when He forbids to commit adultery, or
steal. The sense is not, Beware hereof that when thou take another man's
goods against his will, there be in that action the privation of rectitude, or
meralitas malitiae; for we can not hinder this sequel of evil. But the
meaning is, Take heed thou do not this act, whereunto evil is necessarily
joined. If GOD forbid it, and deter from it, can He effectually
praedetermine me thereunto, before all inclination of my will, and altogether
independentlie from my liberty? 2. Man is no other ways the cause of tha^
which is formal in Theft, or the like sin, but by producing the positive
entitie, and free act, of taking another man's goods. He wills not the
formal evil; yea, he would that this action had been without it; yet does
he properly a moral evil, because evil necessarily cleaves unto his
action. 3. Admitting that Praedetermination, great and light temptations,
should not differ by vehemency of the object, or temptation of the Devil: But
all the danger should be from this Divine praemotion, and impulse; which being
present, we should fall into the lightest; and being absent, should stand in
the greatest assaults. All this is so absurd, that even some of the Dominicans
themselves, though they maintain Praedetermination in good actions; yet they
deny it in evil; Cumel.
as Franciscus Cumel, Disputat. ad primam partem, and primam secundae Thomae,
page 209.

If it be objected, That the same absurdities follow upon the immediate
concourse of GOD, 7. The objection taken from Gods concurrence, answered.
to the act of sin, though there be no praemotion or praedetermination: I
answer, 1. That this praemotion is more absurd: For, 1. The praedeterminantes
admit this immediate concurrence, and the moving, or impelling of the agent
besides. 2. Praedetermination has a necessary and determinate connection with
the act of sin; so that it can not be joined with the contrary act: and
GOD, they say, frames the decree of it, of Himself, and without any respect
to our will. But the denyers thereof say, That GODS concurrence, though
immediate, is general, indifferent, and indeterminate; in so far as the
concurrence of GOD in actu primo; that is, GOD, vt paratus ad concurrendum
quantum est ex se, and ex munere causae primae, according to His place, is
ready to cooperate to any action of the creature, whether good, or evil.
This they mean by GOD'S indifferent concourse; and not that the action is
only from GOD, secundum rationem genericam, Weston l. ^. c. 11. de trip.
offic. hominis.
as some do chyldishlie interpret them. And so probably they teach, though
the act of sin, in respect of that which is material, be from GOD, and the
creature both; yet considered as it is free, and in respect of the morality
founded upon Liberty, Vasqu. in primam secunda. Canus lib. 2. de locis* cap.
4. ad 8. Scotus lib. 1. de not. and gr. cap. 18. Vega, lib. 2. cap. 15.
Raynaud. in Theol. nature. did. 1. q. 3. art. 1.
it is not from GOD. Vasquez, Canus, Scotus, Vega, Raynaud. So in a vital act
of understanding or love, though the vitalitie be one with the entitie of the
act; yet the vitalitie of the action follows not the same cause that the
entitie thereof does. For the act of understanding is vital, by reference to
that only principle from which it inwardly ^loweth; to wit, the
understanding; and yet it receaveth not the whole entitie, or being, from the
understanding alone; but also from the species and habit which sometimes
interveaneth. Praedetermination therefore is much more repugnant to Divine
Holiness, and innocence.

Secondly: Some, and those very learned, 8. 2. Answer. Some deny this
immediate concourse to evil.
have affirmed, That the concurrence of GOD to evil actions, is not immediate,
and, as they speak, identificatus, or altogether one with the act it self. So
not only Durand. and Aureol. who deny this kind of concurrence to any act;
but also diverse others; albeit, says Vasqu. the opinion of Durand. and
Aureol. taking it in the full latitude thereof, Dur. 2. sent. did. 1. q. 3.

in the time of the Master of Sentences, were of this mind, as he shows,
Lib. 2. Did. 37. where he himself also dare not take upon him to define the
contrary; illarum vero sententiarum judicium prudentis lectoris arbitrio

these two opinions is most true. Scotus also thinks this opinion probable.

Aristotle was of this mind, says Lessius. But, which is most of all, holy
Augustine seems to have been of this mind, Less. de great. cap. 18. number. 8.

concerning evil actions. Saynct Hieron. Dialog. 1. contra Pelag. says
Vasquez in the place before cited* seems to favor this opinion: but far
more clearlic August. for in his second Book, de Lib. Arbit. cap. 20. he
says, that motus aversionis, which is sin, is not from GOD: Ad DEVM non
pertinere ne dubites, says he: It belongs no ways to GOD, but to our
will. Neither speaks he only of the defect; but also of the act it self.
So in his Book de perfect. justitiae, he says, sin is not res, but actus;
for he grants a distinction betwixt these two; understanding by res, a
substance; as in diverse other places he does: and thereupon he admits,
that there must be some other author even of the act of sin, Aug. lib. 12.
consess. c. 11. Item dixisti mihi, Domine, voce forti, in auro^^ interiorem,
quod omnes ^aturas atque substantias, que no^ sunt quod tu es, et tamen sunt*

than GOD: esteeming it only absurd, to admit an author alicujus rei, that
is, of some substance, beside GOD. So he playnlie says, that the motion it
self of the will whereby we sin, is not from GOD. Thou toldest me (says
he) also with a strong voice, O LORD, in my inner ear, how that it is thy
self who made all these natures and substances, which are not what thy self
is, and which yet have their being: and how, that only is not from thee
which has no being: no, nor the will that slydeth back from thee, that art
(eminentlie) unto that which has an inferior being; because that all such
back-slyding is transgression and sin. This I have insisted so much in, to
show, that there is no necessity in this philosophical argument, to make us
admit any thing contrary to true Divinity, and praejudice of the Sanctity
of GOD. Leaving, therefore, more curiously to search in this manner of GOD'S
working, I conclude this poynct with holy Augustine, speaking of this matter;
this, to wit, that sin is not from GOD, etc. Thou have manifested unto me,
and, Lord, make it more and more manifest, and grant, that in this
manifestation I may continue sober under thy wings.

If ye urge yet more, that even the power of sinning, given by GOD, and the
permission of sin seem to derogate from His Holiness, in His works;
because, as the Ethnicke says in Justin. Martyr. 9. The argument from giving
power to sin, and the permission thereof* answered.
He that may hinder, and permits, in effect does what he permits. I
answer, first, concerning the power of sinning; that if we understand
thereby, a license to do evil, it is not from GOD; for this is an unbridled
disorder of the will, importing in it, permission, impunitie, and a formal or
virtuall approbation of him that gives this liberty. Thus it is not from GOD,
Ecclesiasticus 15.20. He has commanded no man to do wickedlie, neither has
He given any man license to sin. But if we understand by the power of
sinning, a natural power, Vasq. in 1.2. disp. 129. cap. 10.
that may be exercysed well or evil; it can not be denied, that so taken, it
is from GOD; and so, Aug. de gratia Christ. cap. 17. Lomb. in 2. did. 44.
Scotus there and others. Arist. 3. Ethic. cap. 7.

August. de Spiritu and litera, c. 31.


with Augustine, the Schoolmen teach. Neither is there any blame in this;
for if it were not, our liberty would not appear. The free power of doing one
thing, is joined with the power circa oppositum in us, as the Philosopher
teaches, and August. with him. When it is in our power to do, it is also in
our power not to do, etc. So Thomas there. Therefore this power of sinning, is
not evil, but good, and has a good use, Tertull. 2. in Marcio. cap. 6.
to wit, to make us free. Hence Tertullian, Basil* and others, grant it, when
having to do with those that made GOD the author of sin. I mean, not that
the power of sinning, Basil. in homil. Quod DEVS non sit author malorum.
belongs to Liberty, taking liberty in the largest amplitude thereof: for
that is false, as we are taught by Thomas, and others: and it is manifest in
GOD, who is most free, yet can not sin. Thom. q. 24. de lib. arb. art. 3. and
in 2. did. 44. art. ^. ad primum.
This Anselme meaned, when in his Dialogue, de lib. arbit. cap. 1. he said,
that the power of sinning is neither liberty, nor a part thereof: yet can it
not be denied, that this power belongs to mutable liberty. The act of
sinning, is a free act. So the power whence it proceeds, must be actus
primus, liber. 1. There can not be a second act* without the first,
proportionable. 2. If this were not true, the power of desisting from sin,
should not belong to Liberty: for the liberty of one contradictorie*
includes the liberty of the other. This indeed is a defect and imperfection;
but so also is the mutabilitie of the will: and therefore the Divine Liberty
excludes this, as well as that. Secondly, as for the permission of sin, I
answer, 1. GOD is not bound to hinder. 2. He has most just and holy
reasons, for which He permits the evil of sin: for it is fit, that the
Universal and Supreme Governor, having furnished all things perfectly, and
most sufficiently, for every good, should suffer them to be carried freely,
with their own motions: Otherwise, the help given, might seem not
sufficient; and the good work done, forced, and not worthy of praise.
Therefore Basil, having propounded the question, Why GOD did not take from us
the power of sinning? Basil.
answers: As we think not our servantes duetifull, when we have them
bound, and in chains; but when they do willingly that which they ought. So
he is gracious to GOD, not who does of necessity, but of virtue; and virtue
is of election, says he, and not of necessity; and election is of that
which is in our power; and that which is in our power, is free. 2. It becomes
men to waken up themselves, to the doing of good, and avoiding of evil; and
ever to be sollicitous, and attentive, that they be not inlacking to the
grace of GOD: but if GOD would permit no sin, there should be no need of
this solicitude. 3. He can draw great good out of evil: as, first, The
manifesting His goodness, and patience, suffering the contempt of His Majesty
by sin. 2. The manifesting of His Divine Mercy, pardoning it; whereunto
belongs the Mystery of the Incarnation of the Son of GOD; and whatsoever
He has done and suffered for us. All this is by occasion of sin, whereby He
has manifested His Glory far more than if sin had never been. 3. The
good of His Chosen He draws even out of this evil. Thus the cruelty of
Tyrants served to the increase of glory to the Martyrs. Hence Vincentius the
Martyr said to his torturer Dacianus; Nunquam quisquam adeo been servivit mihi
vt tu: Thou have been the best servant that ever I had. So the wickedness of
Heretics serves for the proving and clearing the faith of the Church:
Nunquid perfect de Trinitate tractatum est, antequam oblatrarent Arriani?
Nunquid de panitentia tractatu^ est, antequam obsisterent Novatiani? August.
Psalm. 54. Baptism, says he there, Aug. Psalm. 54.
was not so perfectly handled before the contradiction of the Rebaptizers, or
the unity of Christ and His Church, before the separation of Schismatickes.
Thus GOD makes sometimes a man's own sin, to be occasion of amending his
coldness, and presumption; and of greater care and humility in times coming.
Saynct Peter, and many of the Sayncts, have been, by occasion of some fall,
ever thereafter more wary, fervent, and humble. 4. This manifests the
greatness of His Divine Majesty, which is such, that one sin committed
against it, is worthy of aeternall death. 5. He manifests hereby His
Divine Justice, while He chastises one wicked man, by the wickedness of
another: as He did to His people Israel, by the Assyrians, ISAI. x.5. or
while He permits one's sin, for the punishment of another, in the sinner
himself, ROMANS 1. Thus sin is called the punishment of sin: not that it is
properly a punishment; for it is not intended by GOD the Punisher; but because
the permission of it is a punishment willed by GOD for revenge; through which
permission, by accident, another sin falls out. For when a man, by former
sins, makes himself unworthy of the inspiration and protection of GOD, He
withdraws it from him; that is, He gives him it not, as other ways He
would have done; and so he falls into other sins, which, by the grace of
GOD, he would have eschewed. Lastly; The splendour of His justice shall
appear, when sin shall be revenged with aeternall punishment. So He
draws many fold good out of sin. Almighty GOD, August. in E^chyrid. cap.
11.
says AUGUSTINE, who has power of all things, since He is infinitely
good, would suffer no evil at all to be in His work, except He were so
powerful, and so good, as that He can draw good out of evil. So neither
does His permission derogate from His Holiness, nor yet from His Providence.
He is not an idle spectator of sins and sinners; but everie-where His Divine
Providence over-ruleth them. Though they preasse to draw themselves from His
Disposition and Providence, yet can they not: for while they withdraw
themselves from the order of His Divine Direction, they fall into the order of
His Chastisement: and while they withdraw themselves from the bounty of His
Mercy, they fall into the Severitie of His Justice: and while they will not
honor Him by well-doing, they are forced to honor Him by suffering evil:
August. l. 12 confess. c. 11. Null^^ peccatum aut tibi nocat, aut perti^ebat
ordin^^^ imperii tui, vel in primo, vel in imo.
while they will not willingly be subject, by obeying His Commandementes, they
are forced, against their wills, to be subject, by suffering Torments. Hence
says holy AUGUSTINE, No man's sin does either hurt thee, O LORD, or
disturb the order of thy Government, first or last.

Let no man, therefore, blame GOD for his sins. His Holiness is such, (as
has been shown) that He can have no hand in the procuring of sin. 10. Our
evil is from our selves.
IAM. j.13.14.15. Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of GOD: for
GOD can not be tempted with evil; neither tempts He any man. But every
man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and entysed. Then,
when lust has conceaved, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it is
finished, brings forth death. Let us, therefore, smite our own breasts,
and rent our own hearts; our destruction is of our selves; we conceive, and
bring forth, this wicked brood, ISAI. lix.4. Consent not, says AU^USTINE, to
thy lust: it has not whereof to conceive, Aust. l. 50* (...). 4^.8.
but of thee. Have thou consented? Thou have as it were lain with it in thy
heart. If thy concupiscence arise, deny thy self to it; follow it not. When
lust has conceaved, it brings forth sin; and sin finished, brings
death. Be not, therefore, drawn away with thy lust: deny thy self unto it;
follow it not: it is unlawful, it is licencious, it is filthy: it turns
thee away from GOD. Give not the embracing of consent, lest thou bewail the
woeful brood thereof. The Devil, indeed, concurreth powerfullie; and
therefore absolutely is called the Tempter, MATH. iv.2. 1 Thessalonians. iij.5. 1.
COR. vij. 5. ACT. iij.3. Yet, it may be, his hand is not so often, and so much
in our falls, as we think. NAZIANZ. Why cast we all the fault upon our
enemy, since our own wickedness gives him strength? Nazian^. (...). 2.
Blame thy self wholly, or chiefelie; for thy fire, is the Devil's flame.
(...). Aug. Tract. 12. in Joan. Hieron. Matthew. 4. Ambr. Hex. 1.8.
The Devil can not cast down the will: he can but prepare the bayte, and
hook; and so allure, and entyse; but not force, and compel. If a man consent
not, he can do nothing: Therefore said he to our Savior, MATTHEW. iv.3. LUKE
iv.3. Command these stones, etc. Cast thy self down, etc. If thou will fall
down, etc. all words of sollistation, and provocation, as Hieron. marketh.
Much less can th'allurement of the creature cast us down, which is but a trap,
for the feet of the foolish. Excellently says Ambr. to this purpose; Our
danger is chiefelie from our selves: not from any thing without: within is the
adversary, within the author of our error. Thou thy self art the cause of
thy impiety: thou thy self art the leader unto, and the kindler of thy
crimes. Why labourest thou to excuse thy falls, by accusing of another? O that
thou would not drive and cast thy self headlongs, etc. And thus much
concerning the second branch of HOLINESS, as it belongs to the Lord in His
ways. Now let us come to the third, and speak of HOLINESS, as it belongs
unto Him in respect of those that serve Him.

The third ^ranch. HOLINESS ^elongeth ^o GOD, ^n respect ^f all that ^ertayne
to ^im.
HOLINESS belongs to GOD, in respect of all that pertayne unto Him; but
especially, in respect of Men; and amongst these, chiefelie, in respect of the
PRIEST, and High PRIEST.

All this world is as it were The Temple of His DEITY, consecrated to His
worship, sanctified by His presence, and filled with his glory, ISAI. vj.3. 1.
The whole world, an holy Temple.
Everie-where as it were, we may see Him present; and ever, as in His
presence, should walk in it, as in an holy Temple, worshipping, praising, and
blessing Him; for in His Temple does every one speak of His Glory, PSALM.
xxix.9. Even the senseless creatures praise and bless Him; because, so much
as in them lies, they excite to this duty such as have reason, by their
representation of the Divine perfections. Herein their goodness and chief
use stands, and for it they were chiefelie made. Hence the creatures are
called the Proclaymers and Witnesses of the DEITY; Prosp. 2. de voc. Gent.
cap. 4.
whose voice is heard and understood everie-where, PSALM. xix.1.2.3. ACT. xiv.17.

The spirits of Men are yet more properly His Temple; His presence in them is
more illustrious, 2. Man, a more holy Temple.
than in things bodily; and they may come to Him, and be joined to Him more
excellently than those: there is no soul, which is not more capable of Him,
than the whole world besides: therefore the Fathers, Nyssen. and Chrysostom.
mark, that GOD proceeded to the making of Man, Nyssen. d^ opific. hom. cap. 3.

Chrysostom. hom. 8. in Genes.


as it were with deliberation, and drew as it were beforehand his portraiture
by His word, showing what a one he should be, and according to what lyknesse,
and for what end, Genes. 1.26. He is more especially sanctified unto His
Divine worship, and inhabitation, than al things bodily; that converting
himself within to his indweller, he may converse with GOD, worship, and adore
Him. He alone, and the Angelical Spirits, may know and love Him, which is
true Holiness, whereby He dwells in them, and they become His Temple; much
more happy and sublime, than all this bodily world, which is not sensible of
His presence. This Knowledge and Love unite them unto Him, by a vital band:
thereby they are made partakers of His Divine Nature, 2. PET. 1.4. Yea, and
thereby are changed in Him whom they know and love, and become one Spirit
with Him, 1. COR. 6.17. So in them is required a more special Holiness.

Hence, though Man received many rich and costly endewmentes from his Maker,
3. Man's Holiness in the creation.
in the day of his creation; yet the jewel of greatest price and value, was
Holiness. The colors wherewith GOD drew His Image and likeness in Man at
the beginning, were not bodily; but they were Purity, immunitie from
perturbations, blessedness, and an estate free of all evil. With such Flowers
did the Framer of His Image adorn our nature, Nyss. de hom. opific. cap. 5.
and cap. ^.
says Nyssen. This Image (says he again) was not adorned with purple, nor
did show forth its dignity by a Scepter, or Diadem: but in stead of purple,
was clothed with virtue, which is the most Royal Garment: and for a Scepter,
had the blessedness of Immortality: and in stead of a Royal Crown, was
adorned with the Crown of Righteousness. By all other his perfections
accompanying Essence, Life, Sense, or Reason, he was indeed like his
pattern, more or less: all these did in some degree and measure resemble that
which in his Maker was entire, perfect, and infinite: Yet the chiefest of all
these compared to His Sanctity, were but the foote-steppes of His DEITY. This
was the lyuelie Character of His Image, Ephesians. iv.24. By this one he was
nearer GOD, than by them all. This was the Soveraygne Quality, whereunto all
the rest did homage, and whereupon the safety of them all depended: while it
was safe, all these were well; but being lost, they perished.

4. His Holiness in Hi^ restoration.
If we consider the Restoration of Man-kynde, this will yet appear more
clearlie: For in CHRIST JESUS, GOD by Himself, and not by any created gift,
sanctifies the humane nature; drawing it above all things created to
Himself; and substantiallie uniting it, into the person of the Son of GOD:
Therefore the Ancients say, that by the Deity it self, the manhood of CHRIST
is velut igne penetrata, and vnguento delibuta, pierced by it, as it were, with
fire; and anointed by it, as with ointment: so the Divine nature in this union,
is as it were the ointment, and the humane nature, that which is anointed.
Whence also is the Name of CHRIST: CHRIST (says Nazianz.) became man, that He
by Himself might sanctify men, and might be, as it were, leaven, to the
whole lump; Nazian* Orat. 36.
and that uniting them to Himself, who was condemned, He might deliver them
from damnation; being made for us, all that we are, except sin. The Son
of man, in respect of whom He came, (...); He is CHRIST, by the DEITY
anointing Him; not by the operation thereof, as it did to others; but by the
presence of it self: the effect whereof is this, that he who anoynteth, is
made man; and he that is anointed, is made God. Elias Cretenses writing upon
this place of Nazianz. says, that whereas others were sanctified by grace, in
CHRIST the presence of the DEITY it self was in stead of anoyn^ing. The
fulness of the Godhead dwells in Him; and therefore the fulness of
Holiness. So He is Sanctus Sanctorum. CHRIST, says August. Aug. P^ ^6.
Si sacramenta cogites, est Sanctus Sanctorum; si gregem subditum cogites; est
Pastor Pastorum; si fabricam cogites, est fundamentum fundamentorum: the
Holiest of Holies, the Pastor of Pastors, and Foundation of Foundations. This
is an admirable and incomprehensible Holiness. Here kytheth an infinite
goodness of GOD, which has appointed such a Fountain of Purity and
Sanctity of Man-kynde. Of His fulness we all receive, JOHN j.16. By this
One, all that are made holy, are sanctified, as by one all were defiled. From
Him comes all Holiness to the outward Symboles or Sacraments which He has
instituted for us that are rude, and led by Sense; that by these sensible
things He might sanctify us, and by bodily touching He might infuse His
Spirit, and His gifts, in our souls, and faculties thereof; that thence it
may break out in all our actions; and so the whole man, and all his life, may
be wholly devouted, and consecrated to GOD; and thereby reduced to Him, who
is the Supreme good, and last end, from whom he came, and in whom for ever
he should rest.

He is blind that can not perceive from that which has been said, 5.
Necessity (...) Holiness (...) in all (...).
the necessity of Holiness in all. If GOD be of such infinite Purity and
Holiness in Himself, in all His works, and in all His appoyntmentes toward
us, how can He but require Purity and Holiness in all them that worship
Him? LEVIT. xj.44.xix.2.xx.7. and 1. PET. 1. Whence this HOLINESS TO THE LORD
was to be written not in the edge of the peoples garments, nor in any obscure
part of the Priest's Vesture; but on the head, the most eminent part of the
body; and on the forehead, the most conspicuous part of the head: that all
seeing it in so eminent a place, might think the care of it, their prime
duty. No servand can please that Supreme Purity, but he that is pure: None
ever pleased Him, but by Holiness: none ever displeased Him that was endewed
therewith. He is the Spouse of pure Souls, says Nazianz. No wonder that,
^azianz.
that Fountain of Holiness, will have none to serve Him, but those that are
holy* that Author, End, Rule, and Example of all Holiness, by whom, for
whom, and according to whose lyknesse all things are sanctified, both in
Heaven and earth. He has not commanded us to imitate His Power, nor Wisdom,
nor height of Majesty, but Holiness: Ye shall be holy, for I am holy,
LEVIT. xj.44. To it from aeternitie He choosed us in CHRIST, EPHESIANS. 1.4. And
this is that which brings to the aeternitie of Bliss, MATTHEW. v.8. Blessed
are the pure in heart, for they shall see GOD. He that has this hope, purges
himself, that he may be pure, as He is pure, 1. JOHN iij.3. Without Holiness
no man shall see Him, HEB. xij.14. This is His will, 1. TH^S* iv.7 For this
end has He sanctified Time, ISAI. lviij 13. Place, MATTHEW. xxiv.15. Persons,
DEVT. xxxiij.8. For this end has He given us His sanctifying WORD, John
xvij.17. in plenty, and His holy Sacraments, Ephesians. v.25. For this end
CHRIST was sanctified, John xvij.19. Ephesians. v.27. So we are most straytlie
tied to Holiness and Purity. The title of Christians is An holy People,
ISAI. lxij.12. And they shall call them the holy People, An holy Temple. To
signify this Holiness and Innocence, Dionys. Areopag. Hie^ Eccl. cap. 12.
Ambr. de iis qui mysteri^ initiantur, cap. 3.

Aug. sermon. 157 and 163. de tempore Chris. Hom. in Psalm. 119.


Christians at Baptism were clothed with a white garment. The solid praise
of every Christian, is Holiness. Has any Riches, Joy, or Honor, and is not
Holy? woe unto him: he has received his consolation, Luke vj. 24.25. He
shall mourn and weep, and shall be abased. Is any learned, or eloquent, and
not holy? woe to him, though he speak with the tongue of Men and Angels;
though by the sublimitie of co^templation he should seem to converse with the
glorious Spirits; yet shall he be thrust down, to the lowest Hells, to utter
Darkness. On the contrary; Is a man poor, base, unlearned, rude, and every
way contemptible? Yet, if Holy, blessed is he: Blessed are the pure in heart;
for they shall see GOD, Matthew. v. How careful then should we be, to purge
our selves from all uncleanness of the flesh, and of the spirit? How careful
to eschew all uncleanness, in thoughts, words, and actions? Otherwise, our
souls are hateful to GOD, and become an abomination to that Holy One.

Alace! Where is this HOLINESS, that ought to be, 6. Our defect herein
lamented.
and that may be so abundantly in us? We do not sanctify the LORD of
Hosts, neither is He our Dread. We profane His Holy and Reverende Name,
His Holy Day, His Holy Word, Ezech. xxxiij.32. His Holy Sacrament, 1. Cor.
xj.29. Yea, by our wicked and unclean lives, by our security, and obstinate
impenitencie, we, in a manner, count the Blood of the Covenant, wherewith we
were sanctified, an unholy thing, Hebr. x.29. Is it any wonder then, that the
Holy One of Israel is provoked to anger? Isai. j.4. We refuse to express
His Holiness in our conversations; and just therefore is it, that He manifest
it in the deserved revenge of our wicked lives. In that terrible vision, Isai.
vj.2.3. the Seraphims cried, Holy, Holy, Holy; again and again inculcating
His Holiness, to proclayme the equity of His judgment, and to provoke Him,
as it were, to the inflicting of it upon that sinful people, laden with
iniquity. No doubt they cry in like manner now, when they look upon the great
impiety and impuritie of this Land, though we hear them not. We feel in part
the effect of GOD'S Holiness this way. We are almost consumed, and yet we
have neither had Sword, nor Famine, nor Pestilence. Through the anger of the
Holy One of Israel, the whole earth is darkened, and the people is as the
fuel of the fire: no man spare^h his brother, ISAI. ix.19. Every one eats
the flesh of his own arm, ISAI. ix.20. We spread forth our hands, and He
hydeth His Eyes: We make many prayers, but He will not hear, Isai. j.15.
For all this, His anger is not turned away; but His Hand is stretched out
still; because our profane hands are full of wickedness. If He be so
terrible to us now, how dreadful shall He be hereafter, when we shall
stand before Him, at death, or at judgment? ISAIAH was an holy man, when that
vision was presented unto him, Isai. 6. yet how astonished was he at the
sight of the LORD? Woe is me, for I am thee undone, etc. How terrible then
shall the presence of God thy Judge be to thee, who have not here or there a
spot of sin; but have filthiness incorporat in thy soul? Revel. vj.16. They
said to the mountains, and to the rocks, Fall on us, and hyde us from the
face of Him that sits on the Throne. Go, then, such as are unclean, and
unholy; wash you, and make you clean: Go to that pure Fountain, which the
HOLIEST of HOLIES has opened out of His own side, Zach. xiij.1. and say with
DAVID, PSALM. lj. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity.

Though all GOD'S People should worship Him in the Beauty of Holiness, yet
more especially they, 7. Holines^ of Pastor*
that serve at the LORD'S Altar. A terrible demonstration hereof the LORD gave
to Nadab and Abihu, Levit. x.1.2. Their office requires a particular
sanctification, inward, by the grace of GOD'S Spirit, working an ardent and
fervent desire of halowing the NAME of GOD; giving power and skill to dispense
the means of Holiness; and moving them to go before others, in a life
examplari^ie holy. Outward, by the authority of the CHVRCH, separating, and
consecrating them with Prayers, Supplications, and imposition of hands, to
this Sacred Office, to be Fellow-workers with GOD, and His Instruments, in
sanctifying, and saving of men. Therefore this HOLINESS TO THE LORD, was
engraven in the head, and forehead of the high Priest; to signify, that
though the duty be common to all, yet chiefly belonged to him; and, that
he, by his example, should lead all others, both Priests, and People, in the
study of Holiness. Exceeding great Holiness is required in the high Priest,
whether we consider him in reference to GOD, or Man. Priesthood, says
Chrysostom in his excellent Books De Sacerdotio, Lib. 3. is performed on
earth; but yet it is to be counted in the rank of heavenly things. And
therefore a Priest must be so pure, as if in Heaven it self he were walking,
amongst heavenly powers. Terrible were those things which praeceeded the time
of Grace, as Bells, Pomgranats, precious Stones, the Mitre, the plate of Gold,
the Holiest of Holies, etc. Yet, says he, if we compare them with the things
that are under the time of Grace, we will find them to be very light, and
that true which saynct PAVL says, 2. COR. 3. For while thou beholdest the
LORD sacrificed, the Priest performing that Sacrifice, and pouring ou^ Prayers,
and the people dyed, as it were, and made red, with that precious Blood,
think thou that thou art yet amongst mortal men, and on the earth? Art thou
not rather translated to Heaven? and do thou not, laying aside all carnal
cogitation, behold with a free and pure mind, the things that are in Heaven?
And Lib. 6. he says to the same purpose, when the Priest performs this
most sublime part of Christian Service in the EVCHARIST; I demand (says he)
where shall we rank him? What integrity should we require of him? What
religion? How innocent should those hands ^ee that serve? How pure the tongue,
that utters those words? What thing should be so pure and clean, as the
soul, that receaveth so great and so worthy a Spirit? At that time, says
he, the Angels stand beside, and the whole order of the heavenly Powers do
shout. What is required of him, says NAZIANZ* Nazians. Urat. 1. p. 31.
that is to stand with the Angels, and to praise with the Archangels, and to
send Sacrifice to the Altar that is Above, and to discharge Priesthood with
CHRIST, and to restore the frame of Man-kynde, and to renew his Image, and to
be an Architect for that superior world; and, to say more, (...), Naz. ibidem
who becomes himself God, and makes others, such? And again, (...).
A man should greatly purge his mind, and approach beyond others, to GOD,
before he take care of Souls, and to mediate betwixt GOD and Man; which is the
duty of a Priest, before he presume to offer that great Sacrifice. This is
the sum, says NAZIANZ. then, Tbat Priests be such in vettue, as that to
speak it in a word, they be heavenly: that they themselves be first purged,
then purge others: first endewed themselves with wisdom, and then make others
wise: first be themselves a light, and then enlighten others: first come to
GOD themselves, and then bring others to Him. A Ruler, says GREGORY, should
greatly labor to be clean: Greg. lib. 1. Ep. c. 24.
he should be polluted with no spet, who has undertaken this office, to
cleanse the hearts of other men: Quia necesse est, ut esse munda studeat
manus, quae diluere sordes curat: The hand should be clean, that would
cleanse: For if unclean, says he, it yet defiles more. It is written,
says he there, ISAI. lij. Mundamiui qui fertis Vasa DOMINI: Be ye clean,
that bear the Vessels of the LORD, VERSE. 11. This they do, who bear the
Souls of their Brethren to the inward Sacrifices; In conversationis suae
exemplo; in the example of their own conversation. How clean, then, Qui ad
a^e^ nitatis Templum vas^ viventia in finis conversationis propriae portat^.
should he be, who carries in the bosom of his own conscience, those
living Vessels, to the Temple of Aeternitie? Therefore, whereas all Christians
should be, and are called Sancti, HOLY; Christian Bishops should be, and
have been styled Sanctissimi, MOST HOLY. It was the Sanctity of the
Priestlie Office, and conversation, that procured to those of that place of
old so great veneration, Hier. ep. 61. ad Pammachium. Malmesburiensis.

Ambros. de dignit. Sacerdotali, c. 2

See Sidonius Apollinaris* l. 7. ep. 11. et l. 8. ep. 11.


as that it proceeded even to the kissing of their feet and hands. So the
people of Jerusalem kissed the feet of Epiphanius, and the people of Rome,
the feet of Anselme. Thou see (says Ambrose) the necks of Kings and
Princes bowed down to the knees of Priests; and having kissed their hands,
they think themselves guarded by their Prayers.

Before we end, let us descend to a more particular application, Transition
to the praise of the Bishop of Aberdene.
and shortly consider, how this our REVEREND and WORTHY PRELATE, of Blessed
Memory, did acquit himself in those Duties; so shall we, according to our
promise, conjoine to the consideration, (...) of the Holy ONE, and His
Holiness, (...), this Sacred Duty, that we owe to the memory of our
Reverend and Holy Father.

But ye will say, We have heard already his praises. 1. Reasons of his
renewed praise.
It is true, ye heard them judiciouslie, and eloquently delivered the day of
his Funerals; and since that again, and again. The harvest, and reaping, as
it were, of his praise, was the day of his Funerals; and therefore none
prevented it, left he should have seemed to have thrust his sickle into the
field of another: But, after reaping, it is lawful to gleane. Neither need
ye fear this travel shall be unprofitable; for the field is rich. Beside
Glory, is a frequent Celebration by many; Ci^. ^. 3. Tus. ul. (...) been

Aug. l. 83 quast. 31. frequens de aliquo sama cum laud.


and therefore Cicero says, that it is an unanimous praise of good men, and
vncorrupt voice, of many judging right. And holy Augustine defines Glory. A
frequent report, and fame, with praise. Now, if the mouths of many should be
often opened, to praise the grace of GOD, in this Worthy Prelate, whose should
rather than ours, his Presbyters, who so often, and so much, have tasted the
sweet fruits of it? If we consider our office, we are debtors by
necessity; if his graces, and the fruits of them, by love, which is far
more, as Augustine speaks. We are debtors, I say, not to him alone, but to
GOD also, Aug. in Psalm. 103. Conc. 2.
who dwelt and wrought in him these things; and to you, whose loving and
faithful Pastor he was. Come, therefere, and let us shortly view the Crown
of his excellent Perfectio^s, which have been so steadable to this whole
CHVRCH, to this whole Land, and to you especially. I aim not at a just
pourtraict of his worth: that exceeds my strength: yea, I doubt not, Plin. in
praef. (...).

Naz. orat. 10. in laudem Basil.


but the most sufficient will be contented with the excellent Paynters of
old, to draw under their labors of this kind, titulum pendentem, as Pliny
speaks; and to say they are but doing, and had not yet done. It shall content
our weakness, to give some small and rude delineation: Even GOD accepts of
that which we are able to do.

The first Jewel of his Crown that I present unto your view, is his
Judgment; 2 His judgment.
which was in him most rare: it was ready; pearcing, stayed, and happy. None
could more readily conceive, deeply dyue, or more resolutelie and solidlie
conclude.

Two rare Ornaments beautified it: The first, 3 Learning.
Singular Learning* in holy Scripture; which from his youth he sought, and so
followed after, that he did happily wade in the deepest mysteries of that
high and sublime Apostle saynct John, surnamed, by way of excellency The
Divine; as appears by his learned Commentary upon his Revelation.

The second was Prudence, wherein he excelled not others only, 4 Prudence.
but also himself. This made him even in youth famous, at home, and abroad:
and for it the wysest king that Europe had did take particular notice of him.
By the same, when advanced to Ecclesiastical and saecular praeferment, he
governed the difficile and turbulent state of this CHVRCH; wherein he did
encounter with so many distempered judgementes, perverse and unruly humors,
in peace and quietness, Ambros. ep. 24.

Aug. ep. 147. possidonius in vitae Aug. c. 19.


those seave^hteene years, with wonderful dexterity. By this he as
Honorarius arbiter, according to the practice of most holy and ancient
Bishops, settled the Variances of Laymen, having recourse to his wisdom, as to
an Oracle. Variances, (I say) which if not composed by him, Sidonius Apoll. l.
6 ep. 2.
might have broken out into the same doleful effects, which the like
Dissentions have brought to other parts of the Country. By the same was he
most steadable to the whole Estate, whether he sat in Parliament, or
Counsel: and for it honored and admired, by the wysest of the Kingdom. A
most necessary Virtue this was for his place. A Priest, says Chrysostom,
should be various: that is, says he, not subdolous, flattering, or
dissembling: but one that can accommodate and apply himself according to the
matter in hand; and, that can both be benign, and severe. He knew by it how
to accommodate himself to times, places, persons, and occasions: so walking
with a straight foot, that in the mean time he remembered, that he lived not
in Republica Platonis, but in face Romuli; not in Plato's Commonwealth, but in
the midst of a perverse Generation: which saying he had often in his mouth;
and for not observing whereof, he said Cato was justly censured by Cicero.

Another rare Gemme of this Crown, was his Eloquence. His expression was grave
and majesticke, 5 Eloquence
powerful, copious, and plain; having in it a singular and sweet insinuation
and grace; his face and eyes, (as ye know) shyning: so that by his speech,
things were presented rather to the sight, than convoyed to the ear. So great
was his dexterity in this, that if he did read the holy Scripture, he did
so sensibly and powerfullie convoy it to the mind, that I have thought often,
one might have profit more by his reading, than by reading the Commentaries of
many.

To these great Perfections, 6 His magnanimity.

Arist. l. 4. de morilu^. c. 7.


was joined that Ornament of all Virtues, (as the Philosopher calls it)
Magnanimity: so justly may I call the generous, cowragious, and constant
disposition of his mind. The Philosopher tells us, That the magnanimous man
is exercysed in great matters; and yet so great he is, that none of these is
great to him. Such a depth and weight he has of excellent Virtues, as makes
him also stayed and settled in every thing: whence he is neither moved with
allurement of Honor, nor shaken with fear of Danger, nor easily taken up
with Admiration. Yea, in his very words and gesture, he is grave, and stayed:
and finally, is guided by Truth, and not by Opinion. This worthy Prelate was
such a one. He had a Greatness and Weight more excellent than the Philosopher
could dream of: For beside his Natural and Moral Perfection, which in this
kind was excellent, he had that weight of Divine Grace, which establishes
and imboldeneth the heart. GOD, the Rock of Ages, dwelt in his Soul; to whom
he was most strictly united, by firm confidence. Hence was he most grave
and stayed, in all his words, deeds, and behavior. This made him, that he
chased not Honor, as many do, nor turned his back to Terrors, His face was
as Adamant* when he was to strive for good against the perverse* and no cross
could make his heart to break, (as he used to say.) Popular opinion, and
applause, he contemned, condemning it exceedingly in those that are affected
with it; and recommending nothing more to others, than the contempt thereof. In
a word; He was employed in great things, and was encountered with great
crosses; and yet he was still greater than his fortunes, (so to speak)
whether good, or evil. Thus truly was he Magnanimous.

But what of all this rich and precious Crown, which was made up of so rare
Jewels, 7. His Holiness, in adva^ceing Gods glory.
if we find not engraven in it, HOLINESS TO THE LORD? This is the chief,
and the life of all the rest: and this in him was not wanting; yea, so
distinctly engraven, that thou might run and read. All these Perfections
he made to serve, both publicly, and privatelie, to the glory of GOD, who
gave them. Though it would have seemed, that he would have passed his life as a
Layman, yet GOD had sanctified him for Himself. His WORD and SPIRIT within
him, was a FIRE, which would needs burst out. Therefore, called to the holy
Ministry, he obeyed, and followed; and did holilie acquyte himself therein.
Being yet higher advanced to a more sublime Charge, all his endeavor was to
halowe the Holy and Reverende NAME of GOD. So he did by his holy and devout
Preaching, while health served: so did he by his holy care of the estate of
this CHVRCH; for which, both for the present time, and for the time to come,
he excellently provided.

No sooner had he undertaken this Charge, but he began with the Seminaries
of Learning; 8. In adv^^^ment of learning.
from which the weal of the CHVRCH, in all ages, most depends. This he did
seriously, remembering it was laid upon him particularly, As he would
answer to GOD in the GREAT DAY. And so happy was his care in this, that what
he found lateritia, and almost ruinated, he left marmorea; repared in the
Aedifices, restored in the Bibliotheke, revived in the Professions of
DIVINITY, PHYSIC, CANON LAW: whereunto he procured the adding of another
Profession of DIVINITY, to the great benefit of the CHVRCH, in all following
times; restoring also the decayed Honors due to Learning. To what purpose had
the Worthy and Heroicke Founders of that UNIVERSITIE left it, if it had
fallen? And fallen appearantlie it should have, if by him not vnder-propped.
This duly considered, that UNIVERSITIE may be justly called ANASTASIA, as
was that Temple of Nazianzen in Constantinople: for he has raised up in it
good Letters, almost fallen to the ground. Was not this HOLINESS?

The like care had he to plant good and worthy Pastors, for the present time:
9. In his care of planting Churches.
and such was the success of his care, that never any of the Worthy Prelates
that went before him, had such a Learned Clergy. Yea, while this Diocese
enjoyed him, and that other Worthy Prelate of blessed memory, for singular
Piety, and excellent Learning, Incomparable, (I mean, the late Bishop of
Edinburgh, not long since your Worthy Pastor) it needed not to have envyed
any part of this KINGDOM. None had more sagacitie to discern good spirits,
or care to promoue them. They might have said, while he lived, with the Poet,
of him, -- Sub test benigno
Claud,
Vivitur, egregios invitant praemia mores.
Hinc priscae redeunt arts, felicibus inde
Ingeniis aperitur iter, despectaque Musae
Colla levant.


10. His integrity. Plin. in praesat*
In all this public Administration, such was his integrity, that to him
belonged, that, as Pliny calls it, Nobilis suspiratio Ciceronis of Cato; O
te felicem a quo nemo rem improbam petere audet. None durst attempt to corrupt
him. All which being duly weighed, I am not afraid to say, He might have
been a Statesman, in the best State of EVROPE, and a Prelate, in the best
times of the CHVRCH. That which Pliny says of Cato, That he was thought to
have conjoined in himself, the three greatest things, Optimus Orator, Optimus
Senator, Optimus Imperator, might be not unfitly applied unto him, if ye
will put a Prelate, for a Commander.

In his private life and conversation, he was Holy: 11. His Holiness
inprivate life and death.
none more familiar with GOD. The sweet Fruits whereof, as he felt al his
life, in many sharp Conflictes and Crosses, which he encountered with, so
especially before his death: For GOD continued with him, contrary to the
nature of his disease, his Judgment, and Prudence, which was the Crown of his
Gray Hayres; and his Tongue, which was his Glory: and, which was most of all,
his Holiness. So that his Disease, though heavy, was but (...), the proof of
his Virtue; Naz. ep. 41.
he being more blessed in this, than others were in health. It abated nothing
of his care of the Glory of GOD, and welfare of His CHVRCH: he traveled no
less paynfullie now, than before, by his Prayers, sound Advyce, frequent,
wise, and powerful Letters. Amongst others, ye had a singular proof of his
Religious Care a little before his death; when your suit was, to have for your
Pastor, his Worthy, Devout, and Learned Son, ye know how willingly he
condescended to his Transplantation; notwithstanding he was the Manager of his
estate at that time; and, under GOD, the Stay of his old age, and the Solace
of his solitariness, and sickness: whence he professed that for his stay,
he would have tripled, what was to be obtained by his remouall, if it had
been lawful to look in that matter to wordlie respects. A great argument
this was, that he disesteemed both Estate, Health, and private Contentment, in
respect of GODS GLORY, and your Weal: which, knowing himself ready now to
depart, he thought he could no better promoue, than by leaving you in stead
of himself, the best Expression he had of himself; that ye beholding his
Virtues in him, as in a clear and bright glass, Nazianz. Epist. 37. (...).
might in effect have him even after his departure, as Nazianzen speaks of
Nyssen, in reference to his brother S. Basil-God also gave him, as an earnest
desire to be dissolved; so an undaunted cowrage against the fear of Death.
Some few days before his departure, having most devoutlie taken the holy
SACRAMENT, with us his Presbyters, and having most affectio^atelie blessed us,
he said most devoutly, (tears bursting out for joy) with SIMEON, LORD, now
let Thou Thy servant depart in peace, etc. And settling himself in his
former calmnesse, and tranquillity, did expect joyfullie his LORD: teaching
men ^ow to die, as he had taught them how to live: dying as one of the
Patriarchs, as Moses, Joshua, or David, in a good age; having the Crown of
Gray Hayrs, in the way of righteousness, (...), as Nazianzen says of
Athanasius, Orat. 23.

Therefore, I make no doubt, but that gracious GOD, 12. The conclusion.
who gave him the Crown of so many excellent Graces, and the Crown of
Priesthood, wherein His own finger did engraue Holiness, has now given him
the Crown of Glory. Let, therefore, his memory be blessed upon earth, as
his Soul is blessed in Heaven: and ye who were his people, and whose Pastor
he was, remember to follow him, as he did CHRIST. This was, and is, his most
earnest desire: So shall ye your selves be crowned with him, and shall be
his Crown, in that Great Day, 1 Thessalonians. ij.19. For what is our hope, or joye,
or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord JESUS

SPIRIT, be all Praise and Glory, for ever and ever: AMEN.

A CONSOLATORIE SERMON, Preached upon the death of the R. R. Father in GOD,
PATRICKE FORBES, Late BISHOP of ABERDENE;
By ALEXANDER ROSSE, Doctor of DIVINITY, and MINISTER of the EVANGELL in
ABERDENE, in Saynct NICOLAS Church there, Anno 1635. the xv of April.
DAN. xij.2. And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth, shall
awake: some to ever-lasting life, and some to shame, and ever-lasting contempt.


IT may, perhaps, seem strange, that the noise of my mourning, for the death
of our late Worthy Prelate, was not these days bypast, with the rest of my
Reverend Colleagues, heard in public. This duty had been performed ere
now, were not Death (fearing that my unappeased grief, through sense of my
great loss, should have made me to burst out into bitter and T^agicke
Invectiues against her; and so have brought you all in hatred with her, as with
that which the Philosopher says is omnium terribilium, terribilissimum; Of
all things that are terrible, the most terrible) did arrest me, by her
mighty Herald Sickness: to the end, that by near communing with her, I
might know, and impart the same unto you also; that she is not so indeed, as
her grisly looks do praetende: not an enemy to the Godly, as now in our
mourning she is holden to be, but a friend: and herefore, in your mourning,
you should be comforted. For by the death of CHRIST, her nature is changed:
Through death He has destroyed him that had the power of death; that is, the
Devil: and delivered them who through the fear of death, were all their life
time subject unto bondage, Hebr. ij.14.15. Death is no more death. I am (says
our Savior) the Resurrection, and the Life: he that believes in Me, though
he were dead, ye shall he live. And whosoever lives, and believes in Me,
shall never die, JOHN xj.25.26. By her the Godly are bound in the bundle of
Life. She is but the way that all flesh does go; to put an end to their
miseries: She loses them out of Prison, gathers them to their Fathers,
makes them lay down their tabernacle, and puts them into a sound sleep,
from whence they shall be awakened to ever-lasting Life.

But because it were endless, to show you all the good we now obtayn by
Death, I have bounded my self within the limits of this Text, wherein we have
a sweet Cordial, for the relief of the heart of Man, from two great evils;
to wit, The ignorance of the nature of Death it self, and the ectate of men
after death. Fear not to taste thereof; for it is praescrybed by the Greatest
DOCTOR in Heaven, or in earth, GOD Himself, the Soveraygne, and only
Physician, both of Soul and body. The Apothecarie by whose hand it was
delivered, was an Angel, who gave it for a strong Consolation unto Daniel; and
he who has left it unto us for that same use, was this same Daniel, Vir
desideriorum, A man greatly beloved of GOD; A Penman of holy Scripture; who
spoke and writ as he was inspired by the holy Ghost: And it is of an
immortal and never-fading Virtue, flowing from the immortal, and
all-sufficient Worth and Merit of the death and Resurrection of JESUS CHRIST.

That Death, by the ignorance of the true nature thereof, do not dismay you,
learn to know, That it is but a sleep. That the estate after death do not
dishearten you, learn, that it is but a wakening: and such a one, as is to
Life; and such a life, as shall have no death: an ever-lasting Life; a sweet
Cordial indeed: but the comfort contained in it, does not indifferently
concern all. All indeed shall sleep, all shall awake; but not all to
ever-lasting Life. The awakening of some, shall be to shame, and contempt; for
Qualis vita, finis ita: Like life, like end, like awakening: Who lives in the
LORD, shall die in the LORD; rest from their labors, and awake to
ever-lasting Life. And who lives in sin, their end is destruction, and
their awakening is to shame. For this Text has its own both Extent, and
Restraynt. Extent, all indeed shall sleep, all shall awake. Restraynt, Some
to ever-lasting Life, some to shame, and contempt.

There be some, I know, do not allow to it this just Extent; in regard it is
said only many that sleep in the dust. For they think, that all men shall
not suffer death, which by sleep is meant here. Grounding themselves upon the
words of the Apostle, 1. COR. xv.51. Behold, I show you a mystery: We
shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed. He distinguishes all men
unto those who shall be alive, and remain unto the coming of the LORD, and
those that shall be asleep. Which distinction imports, That those who then
shall be alive, shall not die, but shall immediately, or without any death
intenveaning, be caught up, with the rest of the Elect, to meet the LORD in
the air.

Time will not serve me, to speak of this mystery, as Paull calls it, at
such length as I would: only ye shall know, that the ancient Fathers of the
Church have been much divided in their judgeme^ts, concerning those whom the
LORD at His coming to Judgment shall find alive. Chrysostom writing upon
that place, and diverse Greek Fathers following him, have thought, that they
shall not die; but that they shall be changed, from the estate of Mortality,
unto the estate of Aeternitie. Of this opinion also were some of the Latin
Fathers; in special Tertullian and Jerome; and diverse modern Writers, both
Papists, as Cajetane, and some others, led by his authority; as also
Protestants, as Calvine, and some others, following him.

But many have been, and are yet, of another opinion: that is, they have
believed, or at least thought it more probable, That even those who shall be
alive at the LORD His second coming, shall truly and reallie die; that they
may undergo the common punishment of Man-kynde; and shall immediately
thereafter be raised up, or quickened, that they may compeare with the rest
unto Judgment. Of this opinion were diverse, both of the Greek Fathers, as
Dydimus, one of the Doctors of Alexandria, and Acacius, Bishop of Caesarea, (as
we may perceive by Jerome his Epistle to Minerius, and Alexander, EPIST. 152.
where the judgment of them both in this particular is related) and Oecumenius
in his Commentaries expounding this place: and also of the Latin Fathers, as
the Author of the Commentaries upon Paul's Epistles, attributed to Ambrose, in
These. Cap. 4. Augustine, in some places of his works, as Lib. 20. De Civitate
DEI, Cap. 20. although in other places he seem to incline to the former
opinion, as Quaest. 3. ad Dulcetium. (For he was ever doubtful of this matter,
even when he writ his work of Retractions, Lib. 2. Retract. Cap. 33.) I could
also for this opinion, cite diverse of the Ancientes, who will have the words
read, We shall all sleep, but we shall not all be changed.

But besides these two readinges of this place, (which both were to be found
in the Greek Editions of that age, as Jerome witnesses in the end of that
Epistle before cited) he likewise tells us, that there was a third most
frequent in the Latin Editions; but not at all to be found in the Greek
Copies: to wit, We shall all rise, but we shall not all be changed. Which
reading occurreth frequentlie in Augustine's works: and Ruffinus, before him,
followed it, in the exposition of the Creed, expounding the article of the
Resurrection.

I will not take upon me, to define, or determine peremptorily, this
question: For I think with Lombardus, Lib. 4. Sent. Did. 43. that horum quid
verius sit, non est humani judicii definire: which of these are most agreeable
to the truth, it is not for humane wit to determine. Nor yet will I take hold
of that other reading of the Apostle's speech, We shall all sleep, but we
shall not all be changed; although Acacius affirm, That it was in plurimis
Graecorum codicibus, to be found in many Greek Copies, as Jerome relates of
him: I will only declare two things unto you, concerning the Extent of my
Text, or the universality of Death, and Resurrection.

The first is; That from this speech of the Apostle, even taking it according
to the ordinary reading of it, as it is now in the Greek Copies, nothing can
be infalliblie concluded, to prove, that those whom the LORD shall find upon
the earth at His second coming, shall not taste of Death; properly and
truly so called. For whereas the Apostle says, We shall all sleep, it may
be very probably alleged, That by sleeping, he understands not Death it
self; but the continuance of Death: or, to use Oecumen. his phrase, that the
Apostle is speaking (...), of a long death, or of a death continued for so long
time, that the dead bodies may be altered, and dissolved into dust. This may,
out of all question, be, That they who then shall be living, shall not
sleep: for although they die, yet their death shall not be as a sleep, but
rather a sudden slumber; a wink, or nod, of one that would sleep.

Never-the-lesse, seeing many Interpreters, both ancient and modern, do
expound that speech of Saynct Paull otherwise; thinking, that he is there
speaking of Death it self; and, consequently, that his speech imports, That
some men, and in special those who shall be living at the day of Judgment,
shall not undergo, or suffer, Death. Therefore my second Assertion is, That
the universality of Death and Resurrection, is to be understood, with an
exemption of those whom GOD Himself, for some special or extraordinary
causes or respects, has exeemed from them. This Peter Martyr observes,
speaking of Henoch and Elias, who for extraordinary respects were exeemed by
GOD from Death; And such, says he, will be the condition of those whom GOD
shall find alive when He comes to judgment. Yet albeit of this
extraordinary exemption, it is the ordinary course of all Man-kynde, to die,
according to that of HEBR. ix.27. It is appointed for men, once to die.

The Jews, although they allow this just Extent of this Text, in this, That
all shall die, yet they deny, that all shall awake: R. D. ^imhi, on this place.
grounding themselves on the words PSALM. j.5. Therefore the ungodly shall not
rise in Judgment. But for answer to them, first, The reading of this place is
wrong: for the words are to be read thus, The ungodly shall not stand in
Judgment. Secondly, the Text it self here refuteth them; for it says, That
some, meaning the wicked, shall awake, to shame, and contempt. And our Savior,
JOHN v. 28.29. The hour is coming, when all that are in the graves, shall
hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the
Resurrection of Life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of
damnation.

That the Extent, then, may be full, the word many must be either taken
distributiuelie, referring it to both members, Many shall awake to life, and
many to shame; so that multi, is as much as multitudines duae; one company to
Life, another to shame: or the word is to be taken collectiuelie; not
exclusiuelie, but extensiuelie, and universally, as ROMANS v.18. By the offense
of one man, the fault came upon all unto condemnation. And in the next verse
following, Many were made sinners. Whereby it is evident, that many is taken
for all.

The Restraynt is, That some only shall awake to everlasting Life, and some to
shame, and contempt. Of this last part, I will speak nothing at this time; but
(as Daniel said in his exposition of Nebuchadnezar's dream) let it be to
them who by final impenitencie hate the LORD, and the interpretation only to
his enemies: We have only here to speak of this Text, so far as it
concerns the Godly. Their death is called a sleep; and their estate after
death, awakening to ever-lasting life.

Death in Scripture usually is so termed, Deuter. xxxj.16. the LORD speaking
to Moses of his death, says, Behold, thou shall sleep with thy fathers. And
our Savior, Matthew. ix.24. The maid is not dead, but sleeps. And John xj.11.
Our friend Lazarus sleeps: but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. And
the Apostle, 1 Thessalonians. iv.13.14. I would not have you ignorant, brethren,
concerning them that are asleep; that you sorrow not, even as others, which
have no hope. For if we believe that JESUS died, and rose again: so them also
which sleep in JESUS, will GOD bring with Him.

This sleep, do not think that it is of the soul, as some fondly dreamed,
that the souls separated from the bodies, were casten into a dead sleep, and
remain without all action, until the general Resurrection: or, that that
they do rest a space in the dust, with the bodies. Alace! these men are
truly injurious, to the souls of the Godly departed, that would either
deny them all fruition of GOD, or all action, while they are separated from
the body. I affirm not, that their happiness is such, or at such an hight,
as it shall be, when the time comes, of which Peter speaks, 1. PET. v.4.
that is, When the chief Shepherd shall appear, and they shall receive a
Crown of Glory, that fades not away. But that they enjoye GOD, and even
separated from the bodies, they laud and praise Him, is evident in that
vision, Rev. v. 11.12. where John says, he beheld, and heard the voice of
many Angels round about the Throne, and the Beasts, and the Elders: and the
number of them was ten thousand tyms ten thousand, and thousands of
thousands, saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to
receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory,
etc. And as The Apostle witnesses, 2. Cor. v.8. being absent from the body,
they are present with the LORD. And Phil. j.23. his desire was to depart, and
to be with CHRIST. And expresslie Augustine says, Lib. 13. de Civitate Dei,
Cap. 8. In requie enim sunt animae piorum a corpore separatae; impiorum autem
poenas luunt, donec istarum ad aeternam vitam, illarum ad aeternam mortem, quae
secunda dicitur corpora reviviscant. The souls of the Godly (says he)
being separated from the body, are at rest, and the souls of the wicked are
punished, until that time the bodies of the one be awakened to aeternall
life, and the bodies of the other to aeternall death; which is called The
second death.

The bodies then only of the Godly do sleep in the dust of the earth. The
souls of men may have, and have their* own actions, without commerce with the
bodies: For in that the death of man is called a sleep, it evidentlie
signifies, That the souls of men are not as the souls of other creatures, who
lose being with their bodies; their death being no other than a destruction of
both. But as when the body sleeps, the soul will be then thinking,
meditating, and discoursing; so when the body is lying asleep in the grave,
the soul then is exercysing its own heavenly and spiritual functions.

That now, then, we may know the nature of the death of the Godly, we have
to learn wherefore specially it is resembled to sleep. This appellation it
gets in Scripture, is to testify, what good, what happiness, the Godly
gain by Death. And, to omit many other resemblances betwixt them, I will show
it in this: Even as a man all the day long wearied with toil, and travel,
when the night comes, laying aside all traffic of the world, he
vncloatheth himself, goes to bed, willingly yielding to Nature; where the
senses being tied up by sleep, he rests from all his travels, and sense of
evil: by which rest, he is more enabled against his awakening, for better
exercyses, as the Poet says of it; Pectora duris,
Fessa ministeriis mulces, reparasque labori.
So the Godly, when the night of death comes, or when death approaches,
they lay aside all worldly things, and prepare themselves for it: with
Ezekiah they set their house in order; knowing, that they must die: they yield
to the God of Nature, saying unto them, Return, ye children of men, Psalm.
xc.3. They vncloathe their souls, and put off their earthly tabernacle. Then
their bodies are laid down in the dust, as in a sweet sleeping bed: and, as
Job says, as the waters fail frrom the sea, and the flood decays, and
dries up; So man lies down, and ryseth not: till the Heavens be no more,
they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep, Job xiv.11.12. Where
they are delivered from all cares, all toil, and sense of evil, whereunto
before they were subject: and therein they are fitted, and prepared, for all
Happiness.

By this resemblance, we may perceive, first, that the death of the Godly,
puts an end to all miseries: For by it we are delivered both a malo
culpae, and a malo poenae, from sin it self, and from the punishment of
sin. After death, the Godly do not sin any more. How great Happiness
this is, may be easily understood by that groaning petition uttered by the
Apostle, Romans vij.24. O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the
body of this death? By death they are delivered from it; for he that is dead,
is fred from sin, Romans 6.7. and delivered from the bondage of corruption, into
the glorious liberty of the sons of GOD, Romans viij.^1. Yea, from all
occasions and temptations to sin. Desiit peccare, desiit jactari, desiit
miser esse: He ceasseth to sin, or to be tossed with any wind of
temptation to sin. In a word; He ceasseth to be miserable: and therefore I
said also, that he is fred a malo poenae. In this life man that is borne of a
woman, is of few days, and full of trouble, Job xiv.1. And Solomon
acknowledges, That there is nothing under the sun, but trouble, and vexation
of spirit. The body of man is morborum seminarium, a seed-plot of all
diseases. No sooner, yea, before we begin to be borne, we begin to be
sick: Quis ille qui non aegrotat in hac vita? Quis non longum languorem
trahit? nasci hic in corpore mortali incipere, aegrotare est. Aug. in Psalm.
cij. ante med. Who is he (says he) that is not sick in this life? Who is
he that languisheth not? To begin to be borne in this mortal body, is to
be sick. The mind and soul of man is subject unto grief, and anguish;
which is an intolerable misery: David compares it to arrows, Psalm. xxxviij.
2. For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presses me sore.
Consonant whereunto is that of Job, Chap. xvj.13. His archers compass me round
about: he cleaves my reins asunder, and does not spare. And, A wounded
spirit, said Solomon, who can bear? The sense of it made CHRIST Himself say,
My Soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death, Matthew. xxvj.38. The estate
of man is subject to Poverty, and Want: a grievous punishment; for ridiculos
homines facit: the poor are the object of mockery. Solomon says, Prove.
xiv.20. The poor is hated, even of his own neighbor. And Prove. xix.7. All
the brethren of the poor do hate him; how much more do his friends go
far from him? He persueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him. The
name of man is subject to shame and contempt; which even evil men abhor more
than death. Saul did rather choose to fall on his own sword, than to be
matter of sport to his enemies. The wicked at the day of Judgment, ere they
endured the indignity of this evil, would rather that hills and mountayns
should fall upon them. Yea, besides to how many miseries daily is man
liable, to hunger, thirst, heat, cold, inaccommodation in dwelling, much
travel, vain hopes, etc. how many are his private crosses, his public
calamities, and evils, which we bring upon our selves, injuries done to us by
others? Yet when Death comes, it freeth us of all these. By Death we lie
still, and are quiet; we sleep, and are at rest, Job iij.13. And, Blessed are
the dead, that die in the LORD: they rest from their labors, Rev. xiv.13.
Before Death come, there can be no perfect freedom from these evils: for, as
Bernard speaks, Liberatio plena atque perfecta ante diem sepulturae esse non
poterit, quod maneat jugum grave super filios Adam, a die exitiu^ de ventre
matris ipsorum, vsque in diem sepulturae in matrem omnium. In hac ergo die
eripiam eum (nempe, justum) inquit, quando nihil jam vltra vel quod corpori,
vel quod animae faciat mundus habebit. Ber^. Sermon. 16. in Psalm. xc. A full and
a perfect freedom, before the day of our burial, there can not be: for there
is a heavy yoke laid upon the sons of Adam, even from the time they come
out of their mothers womb, until the day of their burial, when they are
received into the bowels of their common mother. Then (says the LORD) in that
day I will deliver the just man; when the world has nothing more to do,
either with his body, or with his soul. Whereunto consonant are the words of
Isidorus, cited by Bernard; O mors, quam dulcis es miseris! quam suavis es
amare viventibus! quam jucunda es tristibus, atque lugentibus! O Death, how
sweet art thou to them that are in misery! how pleasant to those who live in
bitterness! how delectable to the sad, and mournful! For truly of Death we
may say; Pon it finem omnibus malis in hac vita: dat terminum malis in hoc
saeculo; adimit omnem calamitatem. Mors prebet terminum hominibus, in
tribulationibus in hoc mundo. It puts (says he) an end to all evils in
this life, a period to all miseries that fall out in this time; it takes away
all calamity, and makes an end to all troubles which befall men in this
life. He does therefore heerevpon conclude, Sed heu exspectata mors tarde
venit! But alace, (says he) long looked for, and much desired Death, comes
slowly! No marvel a Christian said so, since Cicero, an Ethnicke, Lib. 1.
Tusc. quaest. could say, Pro dii immortales, quam illud vere jucundum hominibus
esse debet, quo confecto nulla reliqua cura, nulla solicitudo futura sit! That
is; O you immortal gods, how sweet and pleasant should that be to men, which
once being brought to pass, there shall be no more care, nor anxietie!

The next Happiness included in this, that it is called a sleep, is, That
hereby we are fitted and prepared for heavenly Happiness. By Death there is
a preparation made, for our change, to the enjoying of aeternall Felicity;
whence it is called by BERNARD, Ianua vitae, initium refrigerii, sancti montis
scala, and ingressus in locum tabernaculi admirabilis, quod fixit Dominus, and
non homo Bern. Sermon. on the 19 verse of the 5 chapter of JOB. The door of
life, the beginning of our refreshing, the ladder whereby we go up to the
holy mountain, an entry unto the place of that admirable Tabernacle which
the LORD Himself made, and not man.

What sleep, then, is like to this Sleep? and what Sleep more to be desired
than IT, were not the Bed wherein IT is enjoyed, seems to lessen all the
former happiness? For it is said by the Angel, They sleep in the dust of
the earth. The rememberance indeed of this Bed wherein man must take his last
sleep, deoth teach man Humility and Sobriety; since as he was made of the
dust, to dust he must return again. The Grave must be his House, and he must
make his bed in darkness. He must say to corruption, Thou art my father; to
the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister, JOB xvij.13.14. Yet it does
nothing derogate from the happiness of Death: For, first, albeit it seem
base, to lie in the dust of the earth; yet it is the common and only recept
appointed by GOD, to receive our bodies, in our passage to Heaven. Neither is
there any other place for our bodily rest allotted, until our final
awakening: Dust (says the LORD) thou art, and to dust thou shall return,
GENESIS iij.19. And therefore, Quis quaeri potest se in ea condition esse, in qua
nemo non est? SEN. Epist. 30. Who can complain of that estate, wherein all men
are alyke with him? Next; Of all Beds a man can lie down into, it is the most
kyndlie Bed: For the earth is matter omnium nostrum. And when we are laid
down in IT, we are but in the bosom of our common mother, who will bring us
forth again into another world: in regard whereof the Resurrection is
called (...), Regeneration, MATTHEW. xix.28. Thirdly; IT is of all Beds, the
only Bed of Rest, wherein man most securely sleeps. Of all other Beds,
every man, in some sort, may complain with IOS, When I say, My bed shall
comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaynt; then Thou scarrest me with
dreams, and terrifiest me through visions, JOB vij.13.14. For great travel
is created for every man, and an heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam, from
the day that they go out of their mothers womb, till the day that they
return to the mother of all things. ECCL. xl.1. No quiet any where in the
interveaning time; but then they shall enter into their peace: they shall rest
in their Beds, ISAI lvij.2.

Fourthlie, IT is a Bed perfumed with the most costly Perfume in the world.
We read PROVE. vij.17. that the harlot had perfumed her bed with myrrh,
aloes, and cynamom: but it was a bed of whoredom and wickedness. This Bed is
a Bed of Holiness, sanctified by the burial of CHRIST JESUS. For as He died
on the Cross for us, so likewise He would be buried; that by the touch of
his most holy Flesh, our burial might be sanctified. Fiftlie, IT is of all
sorts of Beds most honorable: herefore it is written of Cyrus, in Zenophon,
that he said to his sons, When I am dead, lay not my body in gold, nor
silver, or any thing else: but, with all haste, lay it down in the earth. For
what is more blessed, than to be mixed therewith; which not only breeds all
good and pleasant things, but also nowrisheth and cherishes the same?

And lastly; The second Comfort in this Text suddenly ensuing, takes away
all matter of disheartening: For they shall not lie in the dust for ever. For,
as one says well, Est somnus quidem diuturnior solito, non diutius tamen,
quam ad CHRISTI novissimum adventum duraturus: that is, It is a sleep longer
than other ordinary sleeps; yet not to last longer, than the second coming
of CHRIST JESUS. For they shall be awakened, to enjoye an happy estate, even
Ever-lasting Life.

The knowledge of this estate after death, and long sleep, wherein the bodies
do lie, it brings, without all mixture of sorrow, inexpressible comfort.
First, that man shall be awakened out of this long sleep; here is a singular
comfort: but to be awakened to everlasting life, it is the hight of all
Comfortes.

Shall awake to everlasting life: this is all one with this, their bodies shall
be raised again out of their graves; and after they are united with their
souls, shall obtain everlasting Life. This doctrine of the resurrectione of
bodies, is only revealed in the word of GOD. It is to all those who have not
learned it herefra, as it was to the Athenians, Mockery, Act. 17.32. And yet
it is the only ground of our comfort: For, if in this life only we had hope
in CHRIST, we were of all men most miserable 1. COR. 15.19. It is that which
gives us confidence and hope: For Resurrectio mortuorum, est fiducia
christianorum, says Tertul. de resur. carnis^ It is an special article of
our Faith, which we must hold undeniable against all such wicked Heretics,
who would deny the same; wickedlie thinking, that the bodies being resolved
into their first principles, shall lie without hope of restoreing to life. Or,
if there be any bodies at all glorified, they shall not be the same which were
laid in the grave, but some other made of the air, or such like thing. An
impious Heresy, most manifestly against infinite testimonies of Scripture,
whereof this is one most evident. Wherefore, Augustine, Lib. 20. de Civit. Dei
cap. 23. shows it to be the same with that of our Savior, John 5.28.29. For
those whom the Angel says, that they sleep in the dust, are said by our
Savior, to be in the graves. And what is to the Angel, They shall awake. It
is to Christ, They shall hear the voice of the Son of man, and come forth.
The Angel says, Some to everlasting life, some to shame, and eontempt. Our
Savior says, Who have done good, unto the resurrection of life, and who have
done evil unto the resurrection of damnation. So clearlie consonant, that our
Saviors words are a plain exposition of the Angels, Tertullian most
learnedlie in his book De resurrectione carnis, refuteth this Heresy: and the
learned after him have done it most fully.

As for that they object, That the body being a base, vile, contemptible, and
corrupted thing, how can it be awakened to glory? they should have
considered, That albeit in matter it be base, yet it is made wonderfully
honorable. By GOD Himself was man created to be immortal: and He made him
an Image of His own aeternitie. And CHRIST JESUS now incarnate, has honored
us with this, That we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His
bones. Ephesians. 5.30. And by the glorification of His body, our bodies, His
members, are already begun to be glorified. And that He might present us unto
Himself glorious, has cleansed our bodies by the washing of regeneration, and
made them temples of the holy Ghost: and we are fed by the body and blood of
JESUS CHRIST, to the certain hope of this Resurrection, according as our
Savior says John 6.54. Who so eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has
eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. And as that father well
marketh, Non possunt separari, in mercede quos opera conjungit. For who works
together in justice, should be rewarded together.

In this point I marvel much how they dare derogate from the power of GOD: for
He who made man first of nothing, what can hinder Him again now to make him
up of some thing? For He that calls things which are not, as though they
were, ROMANS 4.17. how easily may He call back those things that were, and
quicken the dead?

For what although the bodies be burnt in ashes, be devoured of beasts, eaten
of fowls or fishes? For Tertullian answering to this, says, Habet et car^
suos sinus interim, in aquis, in ignibus, in alitibus et bestiis. The flesh
also has her own receptacles in the mean time, in the waters, in the fire, in
the fowls and beasts. Cum in haec dissolvi videtur, velut in vasa diffunditur.
And when in these it is dissolved, it is powered in as it were in vessels. Si
etiam ipsa vasa defecerint, cum de illis quoque defluxerit in suam matricem
terram, quasi per ambages resorbetur, vt rursus ex illa repraesentetur. And if
(says he) these vessels fail, and it flow out thereof, by turning again,
it is drunken in into the earth, and out of it, it may be refounded again,
according to that which is written, Revel. 20.13. And the sea gave up the dead,
which were in it; and death and the grave delyvered up the dead that were in
them: and they were judged every man according to his works. Showing
whatsoever kind of death they died, they must all arise, and give presence, at
judgment. Knows not the LORD by His infinite wisdom, where the smallest
part of the dust, wherein their bodies are dissolved, lies? and by His
infinite power, is He not able to collect them altogether? Shall we deny Him
that skill a master of family has in his own house; or a goldsmiths in his
shop, who can readily bring every thing out of its own place, and as they
ought, in a perfect manner, put them together?

Dyverse ^f the An^ients, and in special Tertullian in his boo de Resurrectione
ea^ ^is, cap. 13. do bring the Phoenix, as an argument of the Resurrection:
either because they thought the story of the generation of this Foul, to be
vndoubtedli^ true; or else, because they knew that it was universally
believed; which wa^ sufficient for their purpose.
This power of GOD is evidentlie witnessed in the Phoenix, who albeit burnt in
ashes, returns to life: in the Flees and Worms, dead in Winter, reviving
again in Summer; in the day buried in the night, the nixt day returning.

And to affirm, that those bodies which shall be glorified with the soul,
shall not be the same bodies, which were laid asleep, it is to deny the
Resurrection. For who can call that a Resurrection? that is, a raising up of
that body which was fallen, a wakening of that which was asleep. It were
meerlie ridiculous, as the strength of the former arguments evidentlie
evinceth. Wherefore, we must undoubtedly hold with Tertullian, that Resurget
caro, and quidem omnis, and quidem ipsa, and quidem integra. In deposito est
ubicunque apud DEVM per fidelissimum sequestrem DEI and hominum, IESVM
CHRISTVM, qui and homini DEVM, and hominem DEO reddet, carni spiritum, and
spiritui carnem: that is, The flesh shall arise, and all flesh, that selfsame
flesh, whole, and in its integrity. For, where ever it be, it is in sure
keeping with GOD, through that faithful Mediator betwixt GOD and Man, CHRIST
JESUS; who will restore GOD to Man, and Man to GOD; the spirit to the flesh,
and the flesh to the spirit.

The same bodies, then, which were laid asleep in the grave, shall be
awakened, and that by the ministry indeed of the holy Angels, who are
ministering spirits, for the good of the Elect* but efficiently it shall be by
the voice of JESUS CHRIST, as He testifies of Himself; Verily, verily, I
say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the
voice of the Son of GOD; and they that hear it, shall live, JOHN. v.25. He
is their Head, and therefore will awake His own members, to the participation
of His own Glory. He is their King, and will therefore call on them, to
share of the Happiness of His Kingdom, and to give them a full and final
Evidence, That Death is swallowed up into victory. He will declare by His
voice, what virtue is in Him, to quicken them; and will possess them with
that, which is the end of their awakening, even everlasting life.

This is that happy Estate, which the Godly both in their souls and bodies
shall enjoy, at the last day. Happy, I say, because of Life; but more happy,
because Aeternall. The happiness of this Estate, the wit of man can not
conceive; no tongue can express it: for no eye of man has seen it, no ear
heard it, nor have entered into the heart of man, the things which GOD has
prepared for them that love Him, 1. Cor. 2.9. And Gregory speaking hereof,
says, Cum homo mortalis de aeterna gloria disserit, coecus de luce disputat:
that is, When as a mortal man reasons of aeternall Glory, it is as a blind
man discerning colors. Yet because such is the eagerness of man's desire, to
know somewhat of that Estate, and such unspeakable Contentment it brings to
the hearts of the Godly, which have the least glimpse of it; therefore the
Spirit of GOD in Scripture, has not left us in this comfortless; but is
content to express it, in some sort; that at least afar off we may see that
which one day we shall enjoye. He tells us, That that life, is a life of
all brightness, joye, felicity, and glory; That therein we shall get a
Kingdom, an Inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, that fades not away. 1.
Pet. j.4. A Crown of Righteousness, 2. Tim. iv.8. A Crown of Life, a Crown
of Glory, 1. Pet. v.4. An exceeding aeternall weight of Glory, 2. Cor. iv.17.
That there shall be Glory, Honor, and Peace, to every man that works
good, Romans 11.10. The bodies shall have their glory: For we look (says the
Apostle) for the LORD JESUS CHRIST, who shall change our vile body, that it
may be fashioned like unto His glorious body, according to the working;
whereby He is able to subdue all things to Himself, Phil. iij.21. That body
which was sown in corruption, shall be raised in incorruption: that which is
sown in dishonor, shall be raised in glory: and that which is sown in
weakness, shall be raised in power: and what is sown a natural body, shall
be raised a spiritual body, 1. Cor. xv.42.43.44. Whereupon it is, that the
Schoolmen gather four special Enduementes, wherewith the body, as with a
most gorgeous Robe, shall be glorified. It shall be impassible, glorious,
agile, and spiritual; suffering no corruption, shyning in brightness, as the
stars in the firmament, with all readiness and pleasure doing what the soul
shall command: free from all animal employmentes, as eating, drinking,
begetting of children: neither marrying, nor giving in marriage; but aequall
with the Angels of GOD, Luke xx.36. The souls again shall be in perfect
Happiness, in regard of their clear vision of GOD. Here we see Him but
darkly, as it were in a glass: but there we shall see Him face to face. Now
we know but in part, but there we shall know, even as we are known, 1. Cor.
xiij.12. And next, in regard of their fruition of GOD: For the Lamb which is
in the midst of the Throne, shall feed them, and lead them to the
fountaynes of living waters: and GOD shall wype away all tears from their
eyes, Revel. vij.17. And thirdly, in regard of their perfect love of GOD.
Yea, in a word, man in that estate enjoying GOD, shall participate of that same
Happiness, wherewith GOD Himself is happy. For as the Happiness of GOD
consists in the Vision, or Contemplation of His own Essence; So our
Happiness shall stand in the viewing of the Essence of GOD: or, which is all
one, in beholding of the glorious, and amiable Countenance of that LORD, in
whose presence there is fullness of joye, and at whose right Hand there are
pleasures for evermore. Wherefore I may say with BERNARD, Et quis non illic
habitare vehementer desideret, and propter pacem, and propter amoenitatem, and
propter aeternitatem, and propter DEI visionem? that is, And who will not
earnestly desire to dwell there, for the peace, the pleasure, the aeternitie,
and the sight of GOD there?

Having thus shortly run through this CONSOLATORIE Text, the doctrine whereof,
as it is at al times, so now most necessary, when your hearts are fraughted
with grief, for the death of our late Venerable Prelate; of whom albeit much
has been worthily spoken, yet it is impossible for us, (not being of
aequall worth with himself) to speak according to his worth: Vt enim de
pictore, sculptore, fictore, nisi artifex judicare, ita nisi sapiens, non
potest perspicere sapientem, Plin. Sec. Lib. 1. Epist. 10. Only a wise man
(says he) can fully observe a wise man: and he must be of aequall worth,
who can remarke in the Worthy, what is worthy to be observed. Therefore I
resolved to cover his praises with silence, and now only comfort you against
his death.

But fearing, if too suddenly I did stop the current of your grief, it should
rather overflow, nor cease; I can not but give you this vent, and with you
acknowledge, that great is the loss which both Church and Policy does
sustain, being deprived of him: For justly may that testimony of praise be
given him, which the wise man gives to David, Eccl. 47.2. As is the fat taken
away from the Peace-offring, so was David chosen out of the children of
Israel: For albeit all the Peace Offering amongst the Israelites, was by a
special law consecrated unto the LORD, yet only the fat would the LORD have
given unto Himself, as the special, chief, and best part. So albeit all the
people of Israel were holy unto the LORD, yet DAVID, in comparison with them,
was as the fat of the Sacrifice, above others chosen of GOD, and delectable
unto Him. So may I say of our worthy Prelate, As the fat taken away from the
Peace Offering; so he, a man full of fat, that is, of choice and excellent
gifts, was specially chosen out by GOD, to be consecrated to His glory, in
the good of His Church, and Commonwealth here.

For he testified, in all the acts of his life, that the grace of GOD had
appeared unto him, and taught him to deny all ungodliness, and worldly
lusts, and to live godly, righteouslie, and soberlie, in this present world:
still seeking for that blessed Hope, and glorious Apperance of our LORD and
SAVIOVR JESUS CHRIST.

And, in particular, in the acts of his Priestlie, or Ministerial Calling,
he did testify, that he was a chosen Vessel unto CHRIST, to carry His
Name. For he was a worke-man, who needed not to be ashamed* rightly he
could divide the Word of Truth, fled youthful lusts, and did follow
Righteousness, Faith, Charity, and Peace, with them that call on the LORD
with a pure heart, etc.

In the acts of his Prelacie, he kythed, that the LORD had separated him, for
this work, as a man fit to rule. For he was one that did rule his own
spirit: and so, in Salomon's esteem, better than one that takes a City,
Prove. xvj.32. In which Charge, as you have heard, he worthily did discharge
himself; provyding for Seminaries of Learning, and nowrishment for seed to
grow therein. In these Seminaries, the Youth, as pleasant Plants, did
abundantly spring up in his time: and he, after due trial of their worth,
planted them in the LORD'S Vineyarde: yea, after he had planted them, he
transplanted some of them from one part of it, to another. For, as a wise
master Gardner, sometimes he plucked fully up unprofitable trees, out of
their places, that they should not trouble the ground any more; sometimes,
according to the nature of the soil, and the worth of the Plants, he did
transplant them; that profitable trees, might have profitable rowmes. And,
above all, he had a care, that the pestilent weeds of Haeresie and Schism,
should neither abide, nor enter therein: that almost here, by his means, he
has plucked up Popish Superstition by the roots.

And in the acts of Policy, as a Statesman, he did evidentlie declare, that
our mighty Prince did choose him out, according to the wise counsel of Iethro
to Moses, for an able man, one that feared GOD, loved the Truth, and hated
covetousness, Exodus xviij.21. And so he discharged himself in all
Employmentes of that kind, that with JOB he might have said of himself,
that he was in such admiration amongst the Princes, and Nobles, that when he
spoke, they refrayned talking, and laid their hand on their mouth: they held
their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth, Job
xxix.9.10.

That such a man is taken away, it can not be denied, but that it praesageth
some heavy judgment upon this Land: and that the rather, as Esaias in the like
case complayneth, because the righteous perish, and no man lays it to heart;
and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken
away, from the evil to come. Esaias. lvij.1. Oh, if men would consider, how
that such men are both Lights and Pillars, where they live; and what respect
the LORD has unto them; and how from time to time He has wonderfully
spared others, for their sakes: how all Israll was spared, for one Moses: and
how he would have spared Sodom and Gomorrah, if there had been ten righteous
men therein, Genesis xviij. and how that the Angel could not do any thing
against them, until LOT did escape to the mountains: The consideration of
this, would make them to take to heart the death of the Righteous, and in time
by repentance praevent these judgementes, which seem to ensue.

This is the special use should be made of our Prelates death: and not, as we
are all doing, mourn or weep for him. For, knowing the happy estate wherein
he is, we have matter to rejoice, and be glad. His soul is convoyed to the
bosom of Abraham, wherein the glorious company of Angels, and blessed
Sayncts, he is praising the LORD. His body now resting from many toylesome
travelles, is laid in a sound sleep; out of which, one day, by the sweet
voice of his Savior CHRIST JESUS, it shall be awakened: and when He shall
come in Glory, He will then bring him both in soul and body to Glory with
Him: and then, with other wysemen, he shall shine as the brightness in the
firmament; and because he has turned many unto righteousness, as a far for
ever and ever, DAN. 12.

Wherefore should we then mourn for him? For as Bernard says, Pro defunctis
fidelibus, non de bemus plorare; sed DEO gratias agere, quia eos de miseria
hujus seculi dignatus est liberare, and eos ad loca refrigerii, lucis, and
pacis, sicut credimus, fecit transire: that is, we ought not to mourn for the
faithful that are dead, but give thanks to GOD for them, who has vouchsafed
to delyver them out of the miseries of this life, and as we are persuaded,
has made them to flit unto the places of refreshment, light,, and peace. And,
I am assured, if he were now speaking to you, he would tell you of his
Happiness; that he rests now from his labors, and that his works have
followed him. So that if we mourn now, we may hurt our selves, but not
profit him. Let those only carnally mourn for their friends, that are
ignorant of the nature of Death, and deny the Resurrection. But let us
rejoice, who know they are asleep, and shall be awakened, to everlasting
Life.

First, then, you worthy Citizens, cease now, and leave off your mourning for
your Reverende Prelate: be no more like Rachel, who wept for her children, and
would no be comforted; nor with Ioash, weeping over the face of Elisha, and
crying, O my father, my father; the chariot of Israel and the horsemen
thereof. Albeit I must yield this much to your grief, that being depryved of
him, you have these concurring judgementes: There is taken from you the Judge,
and the Prophet; the prudent, and the ancient; the honorable man, and the
counselor, the eloquent orator, ESAI. 3.2.3. Therefore I cannot better speak
unto you, than in the words of our Savior, to the women who followed him to
the place of his sufferinges, Weep not for me, but weep for your selves, O
ye daughters of Jerusalem. So you have no matter to weep for him, but only
for your selves. Weep, that when you had him, you made not a good use of him;
that you did not obey his doctrine, follow his counsels: and yet in this he
has not left you comfortless; for more carefully he has provided Pastores
for your instruction, nor ever any that went before him: whose doctrine if you
hearken unto and obey, when Death (which may be shortly) shall sease upon
you, and ye shall be gathered unto him; with comfort you shall see him, and
say, Here is he that turned us unto righteousness: and at the sight of you
joyfullie shall he say, LORD, lo, here am I, and the children which thou
have given me. HEB. 2.13.

Next, you my Reverend Colleagues, his much respected Presbyters, why continue
you your mourning, like Orphans destitute of a father? you are not ignorant,
as these who have not hope. Remember you not how careful he was, not to leave
you comfortless? what testimonies at his death had we of his love? did he not
shortly before his death communicate with us alone, in the holy Sacrament of
the blessed body and blood of CHRIST JESUS* which was the last testimony of
CHRIST his own love to his Disciples? when Elijah was to be rapt up into the
Heavens, being desired of Elisha, saying, I pray the let a double portion of
thy spirit be upon me; It seemed hard this petition to Elijah: yet how
gladly did our ELIjAH, when we Elisha-lyke, on bowed knees, did beg His
blessing, answer us, with his hand on every one of our heads, saying, The
LORD bless you, and double his grace, and love to you, that ever he granted
unto me. What can we but hope for Virtue from that hand, as Elisha received
Virtue from the Cloak of Elijah? Remember that story registrated by Ambrose,
de off. lib. 1. cap^ 41. of Sixtus Bishop of Rome, and Laurens his Deacon: who
seeing his Bishop going to Martyrdom, weeping, said, Quo progrederis sine
filio pater? Quo sacerdos sine diacono properas? nunquam sacrificium sine
ministro offerre consueveras? quid in me displicuit pater? number degenerem
probasti? experire certe vtrum idoneum ministrum elegeris, cui commisisti
Dominici sanguinis dispensationem, cui consummandorum consortium sacramentorum:
huic consortium sanguinis negas, etc. That is, Father, whither do thou go
without thy son? O thou my priest, whither hastenest thou without me thy
Deacon? it was not hitherto thy custom to offer sacrifice without thy helper?
what is there in me now has displeased thee? have thou found me faynte
hearted? essay me yet whether or no thou made choice of a fit helper for
thee, to whom thou did commit the dispensation of CHRIST'S blood, and whose
society thou refusedst not in performing the holy Sacraments; why will thou
deny his fellowship, in shedding of his blood with thee?

To whom Sixtus replied, Non ego te, fili, derelinquo aut desero, sed majora
tibi debentur certamina, nos quasi senes levioris pugnae cursum recepimus: te
quasi juvenem manet glori^sior de tyranno triumphus mox venies, flere desiste,
post triduum me sequeris: that is, O my son, I do not utterly forsake thee:
there are greater conflictes abiding thee: we as old men have undergone lesser
skirmisses: to thee, as to a young man, abides over this Tyrant a more
glorious triumph. Thou shall come shortly: cease therefore to weep. For
within three days thou shall follow me.

How often in like manner before his departure did he thus comfort us? yea, if
he were now speaking to you, would he not say? I do not leave you
succourlesse; but as I have foughten cowragiouslie my fight; so follow my
example: the time you have to abide behind me, is but short: your Victory
shall be great, and your triumph glorious: and where I am as a star in the
firmament, you also shall be there as brightness, shyning with me in Glory.

And as for you his Kinsmen and Friends, let the days of your mourning and
weeping have an end: Non amisistis, sed praemisistis, you have not lost him,
he is but gone before you. You had his travelles while he lived: let him now
enjoy his rest, the end of his travelles. I may say to you as Calvine, in a
case not unlike to this, said to a friend, Ideo DEVS sustulit, quia and illi e
mundo emigrare, and hac orbitate vel te humiliari, vel tuam patientiam probari
vtile erat. Epist. 19. GOD therefore took him away, because to him to flit out
of this world, and to you by lack of him, your parent either to humble you, or
to try your patience, it was always profitable. Neither has he left you
comfortless: for there be few of you, but enjoys some real testimonies of
his love and favor. For never was any parent more affectionate to his
children, than he to his respected friends. You have also in his place a son
worthy of such a father, in virtue and piety tracing his steps: whom if you
duly honor, his worth and affection shall supply much the loss of such a
father.

And lastly, let us all not only cease to mourn for him, but also cease to
fret at death, since such utility she brings to the godly, and let our
murmuring against death be turned to an endeavoring to live a godly life;
that living well, we may die well. For bona mors justi propter requiem, melior
propter novitatem, optima propter securitatem: the death of the just man is
good for his enjoyed rest; better for his newenesse of life; and best of all,
for that safety and security he is put into. The LORD then grant that we
all may live the life of the righteous, whereby we may die the death of the
righteous* that sleeping with them in the dust of the earth, with them also we
may be awakened to everlasting Life, through JESUS CHRIST. AMEN.

their Ordinary; as was well witnessed by their expression thereof at the last
vacancie of the said Sea. We have therefore made special choice of the said
PATRICKE, to be thereto preferred. Requyring you, for the more speedy and
solemn performance thereof, to cause form, and haste unto us, such Writs as
we are to sign for that effect; and in every other thing appertayning
thereunto, to proceed according to the Ordinance of the late Act made in our

Letter of the Archbishops and Bishops of SCOTLAND; To the Lord of CORSE.
To our very Reverend and loving Brother, the Lord of CORSE.
RIght Reverend and loving Brother, his Majesty having made choice of you,
before all others, to the Bishopric of Aberdene, and signified the same by
his Letters unto us, which you shall receive herewith enclosed, we could do no
less, than to impart it unto you, and witness the joy of our hearts, for this
his Majesty's resolution: Not so much for the favor and respect we perceive
carried by his M. to your self, though that both with you and us should be of
no little account, as that we foresee the great profit that is to redound to
the Church of GOD, by this your Advancement. Others do interpret, according to
their minds, that these Places are Places of Honor and ease, and for that
respect desired: But we, who have had the experience of so many years
service, know that the care and burden goes far beyond either Commodity or
Honor. And were it not for GOD'S Service, and the uphold of His Church
amongst us, we could have wished to live private Ministers, rather than in the
rowmes we are called unto. But in such Callinges, as you know better than
any of our selves, the burden and care of the Charge, must no more deter
us, than these outward shows of Honor and ease allure us. To seek Places of
this kind, may well be thought Ambition; but to refuse, and draw back, when
GOD calls, is Disobedience: and if it be done for the eschewing of vexations,
it is far from the Christian courage and resolution we should all have. Now,
we are assured, if any man did ever come to this Place by GOD'S calling, you
are he; whether we consider the instance made in the last Vacancie of that
Sea, by all the Ministers, and Gentlemen of the Country, which we perceive
his Majesty does not forget; or your own behavior in it, that by the moyen
of none, direct or indirect, has made suit to be preferred. And therefore, as
we from our hearts thank GOD, who has put it into his M. heart to go this
way, so we must in the Name of GOD, and by the love you bear to the
mayntaynance of His Truth, request and require you to accept the Calling,
assuring your self, that we for our parts, how long it pleases GOD to use
our service here, shall not be wanting, by His grace, in any thing that
becomes the Brethren of our Vocation toward you. And our certain hope is,
that notwithstanding all these fightes we endure with enemies without, and
those that should be friends within, our GOD shall give us strength to bear
out, and by His Blessing in the end justify to the world our proceedinges;
wherein having you to be a labourer and worker with us, we shall be so much
the more encouraged. As to the rest that should be done for your formal
entry, we remit the care thereof to him whom it concerns, and commit you at
this time, and ever, to the protection and blessing of Almighty GOD.

Letter of the Archbishop of Saynct-Andrewes, To Master Thomas Mitchell.
To my very loving Brother, Master THOMAS MICHELL, Minister of GOD'S Word.
BRother, I have received your Letter, and am glad you choosed rather to send a
bearer, than come your self at this time. My earand was chiefly to signify
unto you, that we have obtained his Majesty's consent, for placing the Lord
of CORSE at ABERDENE* which you and I much desired in the last Vacancie. And, I
trust in GOD, nothing shall prove more profitable to His Church, and a better
man to bear down the enemies of all within those parts, than this. I look
daily for his Majesty's Warrant to the Chapter, to conveane, and proceed in
that Election: and how soon it comes, will send to you the particular
instructions anent the proceeding: praying you to advertise me, whither to
send my Letters, as soon as you can. And so, to the next occasion, I rest

Letter of a most Reverende Father in GOD, JOHN SPOTSWOOD, Archbishop of
Saynct-Andrewes, To PATRICK FORBES, Lord of CORSE.
To my very loving Brother, The Lord of CORSSE. SIR,
AS I was closing the former Letter, a packet came to me from Court,
containing a License to the Deane and Chapter of Aberdene, to meet, and elect
a worthy person to that place which now vaketh, with a private recommendation
of his Majesty for your self. Of this I thought meet to give you
signification: Because how soon the License can pass the Seal, I will send
it, with such directions, as are fit for the orderly proceeding of matters:
Neither will I insist with you, not to declyne the Place, upon the scruples
mentioned in your Letter; seeing we have given you sufficient satisfaction
there-anent, and that now, thanks to GOD, we are in the expectation of a
good peace: Rather I will beseech you consider, what the state of this time,
and the Church of GOD in it, craveth at your hands. I shall not mention the
public enemy, or yet our Politickes; who, I am persuaded, did never hear of
any thing more to their coffeehouse, than your nomination for this Place.
Only be pleased to look unto our selves; and you shall see there was never
more need to keep a Church from disorder. As ye write of your self, GOD is
my witness, I could wish to be unknown in the world, and serve GOD in the
obscurest place, rather than where by His Providence I am casten. But we are
not at our own choice, and so must you think. Where GOD calls, To run
away, it is not Modesty, but Rebellion, and Disobedience. GOD give us in this
short time, to be wise, and faithful, and to despise all things in respect
of the Reward proposed: on which if we hold our eyes, we shall never be
discowraged by the malice of the wicked. I take my leave, and rest

Your assured Brother, SAINCT-ANDREWES.

Letter of the Lord of CORSSE, to Master THOMAS MITCHELL.
To the Right Worshipful, my dear Brother in CHRIST, Master Thomas Mitchell,
Minister of the Gospel, at Vdney.
RIght Worshipful and dear Brother, after hearty Salutation, the Letters
which together with yours are come to me from the South, lead me to think,
that you have guessed rightly at the purpose of the Archbishop's entreatie:
For even this same night I have received a Letter from all the Bishops in
Edinburgh, together with his Majesty's Letters to them, and to the lords of
his highness Secret Counsel; very playnlie and peremptorily appoynting me
for your Bishopric. Now his Majesty's Letter is both so free and
peremptory, as truly it has casten me into great anxietie of mind; so as
I stand much in need of your counsel and Prayers to GOD for direction. I have
sent you herewith the copy of his M. Letter, that you may so much the better
consider what difficulty of resolution I am put unto. The LORD be my
Counselor. Thus, referring the issue of all to GOD, and commending you
heartily to His Grace, I rest ever

Keith 13. Febr. 1618. Your assured loving Brother, P. FORBES of CORSE.

Another Letter of the Lord of CORSSE, To M. THOMAS MITCHELL.
To my Worshipful and dear Brother, Master Thomas Mitchell, Minister of the
Gospel at Vdney.
RIght Worshipful and dear Brother, after all heartlie salutation, I received
your Letter this thursday after noone, the xij of March. After the recept of
the Letters whereof I sent you a copy, I wrote back a long Letter to the
Bishops, whereby to excuse my self, and to lay off the burden they had moved
his Majesty to lay upon me. But against my expectation I have reported nothing
but a more vehement insisting, and that with certification, that by declyning
the Calling, I will incur his Majesty's bitter indignation, and the
imputation of contemning GOD'S Vocation, and the voice of His Church also. My
lord of Saynct-Andrewes wrote to me also, that a Warrant was come to him, to
be signed, and sent to the Chapter of Aberdene, for proceeding to the election;
and that he would send it north with diligence. So as I am casten in such
agony, as I can do nothing but attend the issue of GOD'S working. I would
with all my heart have fled that Charge in this so dangerous a time, and
dangerous course in time. But they have put me to too great a strayt, either
to accept, or to incur the king's indignation; which to a Subject is the
messenger of death. The LORD send all to a good end. The Grace of GOD be
with you.

Keith 12 March, 1618. Your assured loving Brother, P. FORBES of CORSE.

Letter of the Ministers of the Diocese of Aberdene, To Patricke Forbes, Lord
of Corse.
To the Right Reverend and Honorable, their loving Brother and Fellow-lobourer
in the Gospel, the Lord of CORSE.
RIght Honorable, and Reverende, our love and duty in our common Savior
remembered, please, at the last General Assembly holden in Aberdene, the
greatest part both of Preachers, and Professors of all degrees, cried, by a
Supplication subscrybed by them, to that Assembly, and by them to his
Majesty, to fill our Bishopric then vacant, with your self, as fittest of
all men for that Seat. His M. finding now that Seat vacant again, has
nominate you unto that rowme. The Chapter being conveaned this day, upon a
Warrant directed from his M. and with them Brethren of the Ministry,
Commissioners from all Presbyteries within the Diocese, have all in one
joyful voice made choice of you, and have sent unto you some of their number,
to acquaynt you with their Election, and to require, in the Name of GOD, not to
flee this His Calling by their voices, in a time of such evident necessity; to
whose credit remitting, we commend you for now, and ever, to the Grace of
GOD. By

Old Aberdene, the 24 of March, 1618. Your loving Brethren, and
Fellow Laborers in the Gospel, the Ministers members of the Chapter of the

Letter of a most Reverende Father in GOD, John Spotswood, Archbishop of
Saynct-Andrewes, To Master Thomas Mitchell.
To my very loving Brother, Master THOMAS MICHELL* Minister of GOD'S Word.
LOving brother, I received this Sunday only the 26 of April, the Packet, with
his Majesty's Royal Assent to the Election of ABERDENE, and a Mandate for
Consecration. The one must pass the Great Seal, and the other the Privy
Seal; for which there is time sufficient, as I have written to the Lord
himself. I have thought the seventeenth of May the fittest time, and have
given advertisement to the Bishops, to meet at the day. I will have the Lord
to dyne with me on the day of Consectation, as I told you. You will have care,
that he be accompanied with some grave Ministers, bebesides his own
Friends, which I know will attend him. No other thing comes to my mind to
advertise, but that his Majesty is exceeding well pleased with your procedure
in ABERDENE at the Election; and exspecteth good service, both to GOD, and
himself; whereof I am persuaded. You will see, that one be dispatched to
Edinburgh, for passing these through the Seals; and, that they may meet you
at your coming hither. What you would have done, or provided, on my part, I
pray you advertise me: And now commending you to GOD, I rest

Sainct-Andr. 16 April, 1681. Your assured Brother, SAYNCT-ANDREWES.

Letter of a most Reverende Father in GOD, John Spotswood, Archbishop of
Saynct-Andrewes, To Patrick Forbes of Corse, Bishop of Aberdene; in the time of
the said Patrick's sickness.
To my very Reverend good Lord, and Brother, My Lord, the Bishop of Aberdene.
My Reverend good Lord, and Brother.
I Never think of your Lordship, nor have occasion to write, but my grief
increases, for want of your L. assistance, and counsel, in these necessary
times, for our Church. But we must submit our selves to the will of GOD;
which, I pray, may be done by us patiently, and willingly. The Chancellar
came this morning to me in Leith, etc. I rest, with my Prayer to GOD for your L.

Letter of a most Reverend Father in GOD, and most honorable Lord, John
Spotswood, Archbishop of Saynct-Andrewes, Primate, and Lord high Chancellar of
Scotland; To Doctor John Forbes of Corse; upon the report of the Godly death
of his Father, Patrick Forbes of Corse, late Bishop of Aberdene.
To my Reverend and loving Brother, Doctor John Forbes of Corse. MOST DEAR
BROTHER,
IF it be true, which is commonly said, and I verily believe, that great
sorrows are lessened, when others partake of the same; then may your grief
be much eased, considering the numbers that bear a part with you in this
great loss. In so necessary a time, to be bereaved of such Counsel, and
Comfort, as GOD had furnished him with, I mean your worthy Father, for the
directing of some, and strengthening of others, I know not what it portendeth
to our Church. When Bishop Elphinstone, the Founder of your College, was laid
in Grave, the tradition is, that a voice was heard cry, Tecum, Gulielme, Mitra
sepelienda; and, that the Pastoral Staff brake in pieces. He was certaynlie
an excellent man; and I may truly say, since him, unto your Father, there
arose not the like in that Church. What say I, in that Church? Every man can
speak of that he has known, and seen: and for my self, I speak truth;
So wise, judicious; so grave and graceful a Pastor, I have not known in all
any time, in any Church. Not to speak of his learning in all sorts of
Divinity, of his prudencie in Church-governement, of his solid advysses in
matters of State, or of the many gracious conferences I have had with him in
private. I shall never forget the answer he gave to some Brethren, who
desired of us a Letter to his Majesty, for dispensing with their obedience to
the order praescribed in the ministration of the holy Sacrament, when all had
consented to write, as they desired. And Will you, said he, justify the
doctrine of these men, who have called the reverend gesture which we use,
Idolatry, and raised such a schism in our Church? Till they be brought
publicly to confess their Error, or Heresy rather, I shall never be
yielding for my part. It was before indifferent, now I esteem it necessary,
in regard of the false opinions they have dispersed, to retain constantly the
form we have received. With such a zeal, and courage, did he in that matter
express himself, as they that made the motion, were stricke^ dumb. Surely,
I my self, that never beheld him without reverence, did hear him that day
with wonder. To remember these things, it doubleth my sorrow: But he was come
to years; and this Age not worthy to enjoye him any longer. Let me say this
without flattrie; Our losses are some way recompensed in your self; GOD has
given you both Grace, and Learning; and the expectation is great, which the
Church has of you. Go on, therefore, and be comforted. Nothing in life, I
confess, has troubled my self so much, as the death of them I loved, and the
death of your worthy Father in particular. But we must yield to that Great
Ruler, and know, that He disposes most wyselie, both of persons, and of
things. He is gone from us, to a better Society; unto which I wish we may
all be gathered in GOD His good time. I rest

Dairsie, the 2. of April, 16^5. Your faithful and assured Brother,
SAYNCT-ANDREWES.

Letter of a right Reverende Father in GOD, John Guthrie, Bishop of Murray, to
John Forbes of Corse, in recordation of his Father Patrick Forbes of Corse,
late Bishop of Aberdene.
To my Reverend and dear Brother, John Forbes of Corse, Doctor in Divinity.
REVEREND AND DEAR BROTHER,
THE tydinges of the departure of your most Reverend Father, put a sore knell
to my heart; and doubtless that wound had gone deeper, if with Job, the thing
that I was afraid of, had not come unto me. At my last loosing from him,
which (ye remember) was few days, or rather hours, before his dissolution, I
had no small wrestling in my Breast, betwixt Joy and Grief. Grief, I say,
and no wonder, being to part from One, who was to me in place of many, and
see his face no more. Yet had I been unthankful to GOD, and undutiful to
him, with whose soul, my soul was so nearlie knit; if I had not rejoiced in
that grace of GOD, which I saw so abundantly in him, made manifest by the
gracious speeches, which at that time dropped from his lips. These two evils,
which have been accustomed, in extremities, to affect the strongest, moved him
not at all; not acerbitas doloris: Sleep had departed from his eyes; appetite
to meat or drink, was gone; thus nature had failed, and Medicine could no more
work yet all so patiently endured, yea, so kyndlie and graciously accepted,
as was wonderful. Neither did the fear of Death, which is omnium terribilium
terribilissimum, vex him. He was not at that time to begin his acquaintance
with It, as he at that instant professed, to our great comfort who heard him;
and thereupon called to mind a memorable story, which he deduced at length,
to our great admiration. Death was become familiar to him, and esteemed to be
in lucro. He was not as a tree hewn down by violence; but as a sheafe of corn
coming in due season into the barn. Having served his Master above 70 years,
he could say with Hilarion, Egredere anima mea, qu^modo mortem formidabo, quae
me meo creatori sit reddit^ra. What the renowned Archbishop of Canterbury,
Lanfranck, prayed often for, That he might die such a death, as hindered not
his speech, was granted to your most Reverend Father, and more; having his
speech articulate, and distinct, as ever, memory and judgment above all that
could have been expected. His last trust to me, which was his greatest care on
earth, concerning the filling of that Sea with a man furnished, as the
necessity both of time and place requires, has been in part already, and
shall yet more fully, (when occasion shall offer) by the grace of GOD, be
discharged by me. A great Prelate is fallen in our Israel. The hole wherein
that Cedar stood, argues his greatness, and will not be easily filled. The
Lord in His mercy provide.

In calling these things to mind, I may be readily thought a miserable
comforter; but having to do with a man of understanding, I am confident to
obtain leave, to fix my tabernacle here a little, and communicate with you,
what have been the thoughts of my heart, concerning him who was your Father,
and mine: the man on earth, I must acknowledge, whose counsel availed me most
in the manifold distresses which were common to us both. I had a reverend
estimation of him, while he was living, and know well how steadable he was both
in Church and Commonwealth: but now being dead, I know how it is that my
affection is more bended, than when he was living: Dulciora vide^tur omnia,
care^tibus, said Nicolas de Clama^gis, upon the death of his dear friend. They
who have been in their life profitable to others, and by whose life much more
good may be expected, no marvel, if they be still lamented. But he is gone*
Abiit, no^ obiit: we have somewhat of him that remains after death: the body
gone to the earth, there to rest, under the hope of that blessed Resurrection,
Illo mane: the spirit returned to Him who gave it: his good name, better than a
good ointment, remains with us: and what he was, and has done, shall be
spoken of throughout the world, for a rememberance of him, both for his
commendation, and incitation of others, who shall hear of him. His memory is
blessed. Those who truly fear GOD, speak of your most Reverend Father, with
all respect: they speak of him (to the great joy of my heart) what has been
observeable in him from his very first beginning: A Child of God; One who
early sought Him; and a Man of God, who being planted in the House of God, and
flowrishing in His Courts, has continued to bring forth fruit, even in his
old age. Ye will excuse me, if (falling on this subject) I enlarge my self a
little, and make faithful relation to you of that which I have received from
the mouths of those of best Note in the kingdom, and whereto I my self, in
the most part, have been privy.

That blessed Apostle S. Paul, served God from his Elders: from them he took
his being, from them his piety and Religion. Timothy, the first Bishop of
Ephesus, had the like from his grandmother Lois, and his mother Eunice. And
was not this a great mercy of God toward your most Reverend Father, that he
was the son of your Grandfather, whose name is great in the Church, for his
zeal toward God, and his Religion, his co^versation being answerable thereto*
His care in the education of his children* of whom God has given good store,
was not the least or last part of his commendation. Herefrae it came, that your
Rev. Father, who, as his firstborn, had right to the double portion, spent
not the most and greatest part of his younger years in trivialibus and
juvenilibus; which being the case of that great Basile, was frequentlie
deplored, and lamented by him. But I remember when I was yet of very tender
years, to have seen him at Saint-Andrews, following the study of Divinity,
with great approbation. Then was he laying a good foundation for the time to
come. God Almighty had shape^ him for another course of life, than he intended;
who loved always to be exercised in reading, writing, informing, and
instructing others, by declining all publik charge. That could not be. The
Church had need of him; therefore he could not be hid. Herefro^ came his
emploiments public, first at the Church of Keith; to the which he was in a
manner forced, by the earnest entreaties, yea, and obtestations of those of the
Ministry of most respect in the Diocese of Murray, where that Church lies;
and Aberdene, who had no small, either loss or gain by the plantation thereof.
His labor there in the Lord, was not in vain: Res ipsa loquitur, and the
posterity shall retain the momuments. But there might he not stay, howbeit as
unwilling to leave, as he was first to undergo that charge. He persued not
Honor, but Honor persued him, as Nazianz. said of S. Basil, or as Cyprian of
Cornelius, Bishop of Rome, Episcopa^u^ ipsum, nec postulavit, nec voluit, nec
vt caeteri quos arrogantiae and superbiae suae tumor inflat invasit, sed
quietus et modestus, and quales esse consueverunt, qui ad hunc locum divinitus
eligu^tur. And a little after; Ipse vim passus est, vt Episcopatum coactus
acciperet. The like is recorded of S. Cyprian himself, and others, who have
done most good in the Church of God. I think in his translation to Aberdene, I
see the worthy Emp. Theodos. taking Nazianz. from the strayt and little Church
wherein he taught, and putting him in a more large and famous, with these
words, Pater, tibi, and sudoribus tuis, DEVS per nos Ecclesiam tribuit. What
joye was to all honest minded men in his promotion? who thought no less of
him, than the great Constantine was accustomed to speak of Eusebius, Bishop of
Caesarea, Foelicem Eusebium, qui non vnius vrbis, sed orbis prope totius
Episcopatu dignus esset. In him was the viue vpset of the Ancient Renowned
Bishops Ambrose, Augustine, etc. No dumb dog, but endewed with the tongue of
the Learned. He could speak a word in season. And it was seen in him, what S.
August. observed of S. Ambr. In populo verbu^ veritatis recte tractante^ omni
die Dominico. Wherein your most Rev. father was so instant, that notwithstanding
of his great age* and multitude of effairs, for which scarcely any one man was
sufficient, yet could he not hearke^ to them, who pitying him, wished him to
forbear preaching, and pi^ie himself. Preaching was not all: he preached viva
voce; that is, vita et voce. The course of his life, and all his co^versatio^,
was such, as the devil himself speaking aganst him, shall be quickly detected.
With what wisdom, care, and authority he governed that Sea, there is none who
knows not. Bonis amabilis, improbis formidabilis, vtrisque admirabilis. It
must be truly said of him, as of that worthy Iehojada, He has done good in
Israel, and toward God, and His House. As there was no virtue requisite in an
accomplished Prelate, which was not in an eminent degree to be found in him;
So was there no state or person, within his reach, which did not partake of his
good. That Bishopric, which by injury of time, wickenesse of some, and
negligence of of his Praedecessours, was almost brought to the last cast, had
him a Restorer. Your worthy and famous University, founded by Bishop
Elphinstone, and Hospital by Bishop Dumbar, may vaunt of him, as of a second
Founder. Those Churches in that Diocese, which (I neither can nor will say,
were united, but) knit together in couples, to the destruction of many
thousand souls; and by his great wisdom and payns, have been sundered, and
severallie planted, may cry, Hosanna: Blessed, etc. The Prophets, and children
of the Prophets, to who^ he was alwais most affable, and who came to him, as a
Father, and Oracle, in all their doubts and distresses, may now cry, My father!
my father! the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof! The country people,
both Nobility, Gentry, and others, who had him a common arbiter, for settling
their questions and jarres, have good reason now to take heed to themselves,
and be more calm, and quiet: they know not where to find an odsman, and
composer of their effayrs, so wise, faithful, and paynfull, as he was. I will
not mention his beneficence to poor friends, and others in necessity. I have
both over-seene and overheard in my travells with him, when he has done with
the right hand, what he would not have the left hand the know. This is not all
yet. His good was not consumed in these bounties. The most eminent seats in the
kingdom found their loss in his fall. How modest and grave was his carriage?
what wisdom and soliditie was in his advysses? Such weight and authority was
in all his speeches, that I may truly say, When he spoke, the princes stayed
talk, and laid their hand on their mouth: after his words, they replied not;
and his talk dropped on them. One thing graced all his doings, at home, and
abroad; in public, and private; his sincerity, and Godly pureness. It may
be said most justly of him, that Nazianz. said of Basil, (...), He cared not
for the applause of men. The praise that Cicero gave to Brutus, and Marcelline
to Pratextatus, is more competent to him, who did nothing to please; but
whatsoever he did, pleased. My affection has drawn me farther than I intended.
Ye will pardon me. I must draw to that which has withdrawn him from us. That
peremptory question propounded by the Royal Prophet, What man lives, and shall
not see death? I acknowledge to be a triumphant Negative, and will give no
other answer than that of the great Apostle, STATUTUM est omnibus semel mori.
But I see under that, a singular providence of our God, in the death of His
secret ones, which He acknowledges to be precious in his sight. How many have
sought after the life of your most Reverende Father? laid their snares,
consulted together in heart, and made a league against him, and others with
him? not for his or their offense, but for righteousness sake; let this suffice
for you who knows the guyse. But God has not given him over to the will of
his adversaries: he is gone to his grave in peace, and in a full age, maugre
their hearts; and that same God has filled their faces with shame: they have
begun to fall, and shall surely fall: a part of them has been as stubble, and
the rest will be found in their months. This is the Lord's work, and is
marvelous in our eyes. He has foughten that good fight, finished his course,
kept the faith, and now enjoys the crown. His departure is alioru^ majore
damno quam suo. Most justly may I say of him, as that famous P. Martyr wrote
concerning the most learned Bucer, the two lights of those two glorious
Universities of Cambridge and Oxford, Nunc ille ad suum nostrumque Dominu^
Iesum Christum, in pace migravit: Magno omnium piorum luctu, and meo inter
caeteros maximo. And a little after, Illi optime consultum est, nos miseri and
infoelices habendi sumus, qui adhuc procelli^ calamitatum jactamur. The taking
away of the righteous, and men of merit, is a Prognostication of evil to come.
The Lord make us wise, to prevent it, and careful, every man in his station, to
prove faithful. Hereafter ( dear brother) you must be to me in stead of your
Father. And my wish, as my hope is, that this Church shall have a Rod out of
that Stock, a younger Greg. Naz. to fill the rowme of the Elder. In the mean
time, let me entreat you to make use of me, as one who reverencing the grace
of God in you, will study to approve himself

Your most affectionate loving Brother in CHRIST. IO: B. of MVRRAY.

Letter of a Right Reverende Father in GOD, Thomas Sinsarfe, then Bishop of
Brechin, (now Bishop of Galloway) to John Forbes of Corse; concerning the
decease of his father, Patrick Forbes of Corse, late Bishop of Aberdene.
To the Reverende, and his beloved Brother, Doctor Forbes* Lord of Corse.
REVEREND BROTHER,
THE loss which comes by the death of your worthy Father, is neither only,
nor most yours. Our Church has lost a Father with you; yea, the Churches loss
is greater than yours. Publik losses, in upright judgments, go before private,
and the Church her children, who are deprived of him, are both mo in number,
and so the more to be pitied; as lykwyse in a greater spiritual infancy, and
so had more need of a fatherly care. These thoghts made me to doubt, whether
you or I needed more comfort. Sure, we need both. In one thing I yield unto
you, that your loss is double; you being both his son by nature, and a child
of our Church by grace. For the common loss, let us both condole; and that so
much the more: that as one said, Learned men, when they die, should be more
lamented than kings; because kings have heyrs, and learned me^ have none. So
may we say, Our sorrow ought to be the greater, when such glorious stars are
darkened: for we are not sure of so bright to fill their place. As for your
particular, I can not deny, but ye have sufficient cause of sorrow; and
therefore I will not preasse on you a stoicall apathie, but only invite you
to a Christian moderation: first, from the Apostle, because your sorrow is with
hope of meeting again: next, from God's long lend of him unto you. God took not
your Father from you, till He made your self a Father: and, which I account
more of, till ye had by your father, in a long enjoied society, as full a
spiritual education ( so to speak) in your ryper years, as ye had natural in
your you^ger. And this is some way singular in him and you; that we have not in
our Land a Prelate who has left behind him a son of his own calling, so
advanced in age, and so ripe in gifts. Let me close these few lines, with two
words; one for my self, and another for you. For my self; I pray GOD, that
the viue representations of Virtue and Grace, which I ever saw in your Father,
and with the which, so often as I was in his company, I was wo^derfullie
affected, may have still force with me, to stir up in me the like. And for
you; seeing God has placed you as a Star in our Church, and that right
glorious* in your own Sphere; go on, I beseech you, more and more, to
approach to your Father's light: that the loss which our Church has sustained
by his removal, may be repared by you; and the setting of one Sun, may be
the rising of another. This shall be a part of the daily prayer of

Edinbr. the 5 of Apr. 1635. Your very loving Brother, TH. B. of BRECHIN.

Letter of a Right Reverend Father in GOD, John Maxuell, Bishop of Rosse, to
Io: Forbes of Corse; in recordation of his Father, Patricke Forbes of Corse,
late Bishop of Aberdene.
To the right worshipful, D. John Forbes, Preacher in Aberdene. WORTHY SIR,
HEaring of the happy death of your worthy Father, as I could not choose, but
bless God for it; yet can I not, but regrate the great loss I have by it.
With what a fatherly and tender affection did he embrace me, when first I
received holy Orders, and had a station near to his? How happy was I under
his government, when shortly after in God's mercy, for the good of His
Church, he was advanced to the Sea of Aberdene. In my difficult service at
Edinburgh, how often have I been refreshed with his pious and prudent
directions, and advice? And when lately GOD brought me again to serve in
these northern parts, when in my journeyes, Northward and Southward, I had the
happiness to enjoy him, at his own house; what encouragements have I had from
him, in these difficult times, to go on in God and the king's service? Next to
you, give me leave to say it, I have reason to bemoane the loss of a Father.
Yet non amisimus, sed praemisimus. And if any thing be to be regrated, it is
the loss the Church suffers, and chiefelie hoc temporis articulo; that
howsoever we have a pious and gracious king, whom I pray God Almighty to
bless with an happy and long Reygne; yet variis and acerbis casibus
concutitur. What might not be expected from him, who was Consulendo prudens,
eloquendo facundus, and agendo fortis?

He is dead; yet shall ever live in the minds and memories of good men. The
good order and peace established in his Diocese, the flowrishing Reformation
of the Universitie and Schools of Aberdene, the happiness of both City and
Town of Aberdene, in a pious, learned, and able Ministry, the peace settled
in the country, discutiendo humiliora negotia, his exemplar piety at home,
his fatherly authority in his Sea, his fidelity, wisdom, courage, and
piety, in acquyting himself as became a Prelate, Counselor, and Statesman,
will make his memory blessed, with all who fear GOD, to the worlds end.

Suffer me, a little, to solace both you and me, by remembering what he was,
although my expression be short of his worth.

Vir fuit vt natalibus, sic dignitate clarus; moribus vt scriptis politissimus:
qui ad doctrinae orthodoxiam, vitam priscae pietatis, and animum nihil praeter
charitatem, Ecclesiae emendationem, and vnitatem Spiritus in vinculo pacis
spirantem attulit.

In eo maximum pacis and quietis studium, summa contensionum and rixarum fuga,
vt nisi de necessariis contendendum minime putaret: qua animi moderatione et
aequitate vt partiariorum Theologorum iram and invidiam, ita vere Catholicorum
and optimorum amorem and benevolentiam meruit.

Episcopus fuit omnibus virtutum numeris absol^tus; In eo, Chrysostomi
profluentis orationis copiam, Hilarii Cothurnum, Basilii suaeviloquentiam,
Cypriani disciplinam, Hieronymi in Scripturis peritiam, Augustini in disputando
acumen, Ambrosii aculeos, Gregorii puram nulloque fuco vitiatam pietatem; in eo
denique tanquam in vna tabula, vividum Episcoporum Exemplar, videre fuit.

Gravis nec severus, facilis non contemptus, and, quod paucis datum, non minus
amabilis, quam venerandus.

Res Ecclesiae tam abstinenter quam alienas, tam diligenter quam suas, and tam
relligiose quam sacras administrabat.

Quid multis? dignum vita sortitus est exitum, and anima^ virtutibus, and
pietate onusta^ been de Repub. Christiana meritam DEO reddidit. DEVM veneror vt
omnes and singuli virtutum ejus vestigia prementes, eundem sortiarum vitae
exitum.

Sir, the many bonds whereby I was tied to the dead, have made me burst out
in this weak expression, of a strong affection, both to condole, and
congratulate with you. And yet when all accountes are made, blessed be GOD, we
have more true ground of true joy and content, than sorrow and discontent. So
praying GOD All-mightie, to bless you with many good days, I rest*

Letter of a right Reverend Father in GOD, Adam Ballendine, Bishop of Aberdene;
To Doctor John Forbes of Corse.
To his Reverend Brother, Doctor John Forbes of Corse. MY DEAR AND REVEREND
BROTHER,
HAVING now viewed and seen these parts, I glorify GOD, who has comforted
me in giving so happy Preachers to this Town. This, under GOD, was the work
of your happy Father, of blessed memory; to whom succeeding ages are
beholden for the same; and for the restitution of the College, wholly
ruinated, till it pleased GOD, to stir him up: as also in reviving the
Episcopal Revenewes, in a far better measure than he found them. These
works, beside the great gifts given unto him by GOD, speak yet for him,
after his death. I profess, next unto the conscience of my Calling, and the
Commandment of GOD, his praeceeding example, does move me to an holy
emulation, having succeeded to him in this Place. And I wish to GOD I had also
succeeded to his Virtues. In this, GOD has blessed you, qui es optimi patris,
non degener filius. Your Sermons, Disputes, and Conference, have refreshed me.
The LORD increase His Graces, and crown them with Perseverance. Exspect from
me, what in GOD I am able to perform. The Grace of GOD be with you.

Your Brother in the LORD, AD: ABERDENE.

Letter of a Right Reverend Father in GOD, David Lyndsay, Bishop of Edinburgh;
To Doctor John Forbes of Corse.
To the Right Worshipful, and my well-beloved Brother, Doctor John Forbes of
Corse. RIGHT WORSHIPFUL,
I Received your Letter: Ye shall assure your self, that what consists in my
power, I will do, to further your Right; both for your own worth, and for
your Father's sake of blessed Memory, a learned, wise, and a courageous
Prelate; who in his life was a mirror of Piety, Justice, and Sobriety:
expressing in his action, what he persuaded in his doctrine. I pray to GOD,
that as ye have begun, so ye may proceed, to walk in his foot-steppes: that
so the want of him, may be supplied, to the glory of GOD, the good of
CHRIST'S Church, and the joye of us, who had the happiness to be his Friends,
and Colleagues, while he lived; and hope after this life, to be gathered with
him, to possess the Inheritance that our blessed Savior, the LORD JESUS, has
promised, and purchased, by His Passion: To whose Grace, I have you heartily
commended, and shall ever remain

From Holie-Rood-House, the 3 of October, 1635. Your loving Brother, and
assured friend, DA: EDENBVRGENSIS.

Et quidem quotiescunque incomparabilem illam PATRICII Praesulis, in strenua
Provinciae susceptae functione dexteritatem animo penitius voluo, ilico
cogitationem subire videtur quod de Sylvano, Troadis Episcopo, Socrates ille
Scolasticus, aeternum commemorandum reliquit: qui sub ipsum statim in Troadem
ingressum, onerariam quandam Navim, ingentibus columnis transportandis recens
in littore fabricatam conspicatus, (quam ne universa and ad id negotii effusa
hominum multitudo, ingeniosissimis Machinis prot^ahere, and Oceano committere
potuisset) multum que a populo sollicitatus, ut ad locum in quo immota navis
detinebatur, ardentissimas DEO preces funderet, quo quidem subinde,
foelicissimus desuper successus insequeretur; modestissime de se ipso primum
praefatus, se peccatorem instar omnium unum, nec nisi ab integerrimo and
justissimo rem tanti momenti plene exequi potuisse: effusis tandem DEO
precibus, morigerum se, hac in re, populo praebuit, praehensoque fune, and
caeteris post strenue incumbentibus, facillimo negotio levissimoque tractu in
mare navigium sensim delabitur, ad stuporem non tantum, sed and tantae
multitudinis piam deinceps animorum conversionem. Ita PATRICIVS, Aberdonensis
Ecclesiae Navim, Applicati^.
immotam illam quidem and in littore uti aiunt mole sua hactenus laborantem,
(quam ne universa praecedentium, and ad id operis evocatorum Episcoporum
multitudo vel junctis viribus Oceano and Ventis committere potis erat)
ardentissimis suis Precibus, and ingenio vere Archimedae^ solus, ( Sylvano hac
in re celebrior) and rite potuit, and plene praestitit, ad immortalem Nominis
sui gloriam, sempiternum Aberdonensis Synodi solatium, and summam Antistitum
deinceps succedentium tranquillitatem.

adflictissima corporis valetudo consequatur, quidni ex ipsa necessitatis lege,
interr^penda studia, and injicienda laboribus tragula est. PATRICIVS,
praescriptos Mortalitatis humanae terminos pertingens, Septuagenarius licet,
animose tamen, and solita cum dexteritate, in munere suo Pastorali strenue
defungendo assiduus perstitit, Praesulis in praedicando et praesidendo mira in
senectute dexteritas et vigilantia.

sese adeo exhibuerit, ut nec illa presentis Grandaevitatis necessitas, nec ista
invalescentis morbi violentia, eundem ab officio suo vel tantillum dimovere
potuerint: gratabunda Dilectissimi sui Filii D. IOANNIS FORBES II, Patricius
praesentia and pietate filii sui D. Ioannis Forbesii, plurimum consolatus.
praesentia, auspiciis, and divinissimis ejusdem colloquiis, ut non parum
delectatus, ita plurimum roboratus: cui in votis unice semper, in amplexu
Genitoris sui placidissime recumbere, and ad expressissimam IOANNIS illius

Caeterum, nec illud silentio heic praetermittendum, quod Nobilissimis Amicis,
Collegis, Clericisque, languescentem subinde visitantibus, toties majestate
consueta fuderat: Emorbidi Prasulis familiari^ colloquiae de morbo suo.
Est quod DEO meo Gratias, (inquit) immortales, pro visitatione hac tam
placida, tamque optata, qui me usque adeo Grandaevum, ac tantum non Mundi
Vitaequeue pertaesum, extremae meae dissolutionis certiorem reddere ex
beneplacito suo ita voluerit: Gratias tibi, DEUS mi, quod per Foecialem tuum (
Paralysin hanc) sensim grassantem, and membra abjectissimi Servuli tui paulatim
pervadentem, extremae meae migrationis me commonefeceris: Hem quot, Praesul
gratias DEO suo pr^ visita^tone ^a^plaesdae.
and quot indies inopina Mors incauto jugulat? quot, qui vitam cum Morte in
momento, absque ulla prae via Mortis meditatione commutant, ut vix
recipiscendi, nedum respirandi occasio vel tantilla illis reliqua: Non ita
mecum, DEUS mi; Immensam erga me, hac in re, indulgentiam tuam, continua
Gratiarum cum action agnosco, and ad finem vsque (quantum in me) humillime
agnoscam: DOMINE DEVS mi, in manibus meis Mors mea: Imminet, accelerat, en ad
ostium, exspecto, desidero, quam cupio dimitti, and esse cum CHRISTO. Caeterum,
quaeritantibus subinde amicis, and diuturniorem ei apud nos moram exoptantibus,
respondebat Ambrosii utens verbis, (Non ita inter vos vixi, In vita Ambrosii, a
Paulin. presby^. ad August. scripta, page* 44. col. 2.
ut pudeat me vivere: nec timeo mori, quia DOMINVM bonum habemus) laudantibus
dicebat, det mihi DEVS consequi misericordiam in die illo. Ita vitam
Sanctissimus Patriarcha PATRICIUS, inter Compatriotas suos, strenue, and maxima
cum laud traduxit; and contemplatione prorsus Coelesti, Mortis crebra
medi^^^ie.
non sine summo perfruendae Patriae desiderio, residuum illud aevi, and
extremae senectutis suae heroice prout illi usque solitum transegit: assiduaque
emortualium Apothegmatu^ ejaculatione extrema^ sui dissolutionem cum Apostolo
expectando exspectabat: at nuncsub illa Patriarchae lucta (non dimittam te
DOMINE) nunc sub illa Grandaevi Simeonis cantilena (Nunc dimittis servum tuum,
DOMINE) nunc sub illa Sponsae (...) (etiam veni, DOMINE) interdiu noctuque
magnanimitate plusquam humana attollebat in aegrum se femur, constantissimam
divinae erga se clementiae fiduciam cunctis manifestam faciens. His ac talibus
innumeris supercoelestium meditationum ejaculationibus (quibus occupari
conveniebat animam evolaturam de custodia) in fide and sub spe Sanctissimus, ad
extremam usque Mortis periodum semetipsum exhibuit Antistes: Donec tandem
inevitabili mortis necessitate correptus, Mors Praeulis.
divinissimam DEO datori animam ardentissimo Patriae visendae and potiundae
desiderio laborantem, and promptissimo bonorum operum viatico instructissimam,

nulla beatior, nulla unquam sanctis vel extitit, vel extabit gloriosior.

Haec sunt illa (Audit.) praelustrium facinorum si non exquisitissima (prout

DEO excelso, nam conveniens visum est emanare inde Sacerdotium quia ipse erat
(...) Rex Iustitiae: sicut dictum est, Et ipse Sacerdos DEI excelsi. Verum
quoniam in benedictione sua praeposuit Abrahamum Deo excelso, Genes. 1.

dedit illud Abrahamo. Sicut dictum est, Tu Sacerdos in aternum, (...)

Abrahamo filio Ezrae (qui dici consuevit Aben Ezra) traditam, quam and Kimchius

per decretum aeternum de CHRISTI Mediatoris exaltatione: Etsi per revelationem
temporalem repraesentatur Pater loquens: sicut ad Iordanem, Hic est Filius meus
dilectus, Matthew. 3. and Psalm. 2. Tu es Filius meus. Non enim Trinitatis, sed
solius Patris est Filius: Neque sunt duo Filii, sed unus idemque Filius DEI,
and filius hominis, EMMANUEL. Sic missio CHRISTI hypostatice spectati a solo
Patre est, at secundum dispensationem (...) missio ejus est opus commune

Ubi audivit hoc David? Respondet Augustinus Comment. in hunc Psalmum; Vbi
audivit ^oc David?
Audivit in spiritu; ubi nos quando audivit, non audivimus; sed loquenti quod
audivit, and scribenti credidimus. Audivit ergo prorsus: audivit in quodam
secretario veritatis, in quodam mysterioru^ Sanctuario, ubi Prophetae in
occulto audiverunt, quod in aperto praedicaverunt. ^bi audivit David, qui cum
fiducia magna dixit, Dixit Dominus Domino meo, etc.

Dominus dixit; ergo certo and infallibiliter fiet. Vide Aug. in hunc Psalmum.

DOMINO MEO.] Aug. Et eo ipso quod earnem accepit CHRISTVS, quod in carne
mortuus est, Christus homo est l^^minus D^^vidis, and det ad de^tram DE^
quod in eadem carne resurrexit, quod in eadem ascendit in Coelum, and sedit ad
dextram Patris, and in eadem ipsa carne sic honorata, sic clarificata, sic in
Coelestem habitum commutata, and Filius est David, and Dominus est David.
CHRISTO secundum carnem resurgenti, ascendenti, donavit Nomen quod est supra
omne nomen, ut in Nomine JESUS omne genu flectatur, coelestium, terrestrium,
infernorum. Ubi erit David, and non ei sit Dominus? In Coelo sit, in terra sit,
in inferno sit, Dominus ejus erit, qui est Dominus Coelestium, terrestrium, and
infernorum. Haec Augustinus Commentario in hunc locum. Hieronymus etiam and
Theodoretus in Commentariis in hunc Psalmum huic expositioni favent. Et
Ambrosius Lib. 2. ad Gratianum Augustum.

Attamen ex hoc loco DOMINUS JESUS adstruit contra Pharisaeos suam Divinitatem,
Objectio^^ (...)sio ista (...)tatem pro^^sedentis: (...) homini (...) competo^.
(...). Ut monent Hilarious, and Hieronymus, and Chrysostomus, and
Theophylactus, Comment. in Matthew. 22. Et Chrysostomus, and Augustinus, and
Theodoretus, Comment. in hunc Psalm. Et Ambrosius Lib. 2. de Fide, ad Gratianum
Augustum. Et in Enarratione hujus Psalmi, and in Apologia David posteriore,
Cap. 4. ubi ait; Neque enim de Filio suo diceret, DIXIT DOMINUS DOMINO MEO,
SEDE AD DEXTRAM MEAM. Quomodo enim Filium suum Dominum nominaret? Lex prohibet*
repugnat Religio, abhorret Fides, vt ad dextram DEI Omnipotentis mortalem
hominem loces. Et diserte affirmat Hieronymus Comment. in Matthaeum, DOMINUM
Davidis vocari, non secundum id quod de eo natus est, sed juxta id quod natus
ex Patre semper fuit; praeveniens ipsum carnis suae Patrem.

Solutio; ne^pe Deitatem ^llius personae, nam simplici homini sessio ista non
competit.
Quem Ambrosius MORTALEM, Hieronymus in Matthew. clarius vocat SIMPLICEM hominem,
Chrysostomus ibidem (...). Atque hinc patet difficultatis enodatio: non enim
homo ille esset DOMINUS Davidis, neque sederet ad dextram DEI, nisi idem in
unitate ejusdem personae esset DEUS and Opifex Davidis, Patri consubstantialis
and aequalis, cui idcirco Throni ejusdem concessus jure competit: nec ob
assumptam carnem eo jure excidit; sed idem ille homo peracta obedientia, quia
etiam Deus est in illa carne, declaratur esse Deus, omniumque Dominus, ac
propter dignitatem personae Divinae, adeo que inaestimabilem personalis
obsequii in assumpta carne praestiti valorem, coronatur etiam secundum
humanitatem honor and gloria super omnes creaturas, and in Throno Iudiciario
collocatur. Huc accommodat Oecumenius in Cap. 1. ad Hebraeos, illam CHRISTI
orationem ad PATREM; Et nunc glorifica me tu Pater apud temet-ipsumea gloria
quam habui apud te priusquam mundus esset, IOANN. 17.5. Unde Ambrosius in
enarratione hujus Psalmi; Nec mirum (inquit) si unius sedis offertur filio
consessus a Patre, qui unius est substantiae and naturae cum Patre. Et
Augustinus etiam in hunc Psalm. respondens illi quaestioni DOMINI* Quomodo ergo
David in spiritu dicit ^um Dominum, etc. Quomodo ( inquit) nos diceremus nisi a
te disceremus? Nunc ergo, quia didicimus, dicimus. In principio eras Verbum,
and Verbum eras apud DEUM, and DEUS eras Verbum. Omnia per te facta sunt. Ecce
DOMINUS David. Sed nos propter infirmitatem nostram quia caro desperata
jacebamus, Verbum caro factus es, ut habitares in nobis. Ecce filius David.
Certe tu in forma DEI cum esses, non rapinam arbitratus es esse aequalis DEO,
ideo Dominus David: sed temetipsum exinanisti, formam servi accipiens, inde
filius David. Denique and in ipsa interrogatione tua, dicens, Quomodo filius
ejus est, non te filium ejus negasti, sed modum in quo id fieret inquisisti.
Ecce Virgo concipiet and pariet filium, and vocabunt nomen ejus EMMANUEL. Haec
August. De eadem disserens Dominica quaestione Ambrosius, in posteriore
Apologiae David, cap. 4. Una ( inquit) quaestione DOMINUS noster JESUS CHRISTUS
omnium Haereticorum ora sepsit, sacrilegia conclusit. Non solum enim Iudaeos,
sed and Photinianos, and Arianos, and Sabellianos hac redarguit quaestione, etc.

DOMINO MEO: Hoc quilibet fidelis sibi recte accommodat, and in illo suo DOMINO
gloriatur, Non propie^ solum David^m (...) scrip^a su^^.
qui fidelium suorum peculiari modo gratiosus est DOMINUS, ad quem etiam
clamant cum Thoma Apostolo, DOMINE mi and DEVS mi. Ioann. 20.2^*


Sede ad dextram meam, donec, etc. Describitur his verbis, 1. Sublimitas
exaltationis, Effati Dominici du^ partet.
Sede ad dextram meam: 2. Effectus dominationis, Donec ponam inimicos tuos
scabellum pedum tuorum.

In priore membro sunt, 1. Modus dicendi, Frioris partis subdivis^^
deinde res ipsa. Modus dicendi est quasi Imperativus, seu Mandativus.
Hieronymus hunc locum; DEVS non sedet, assumptio corporis sedet, huic ergo
pracipitur vt sedeat qui homo est, qui assu^ptus est. Haec ille. Audit quasi
"homo, Modus dic^ndi.

Sede.


Sede, sedet vero quasi DEI Filius, inquit Ambrosius, posteriore Apologia
David, Cap. 4. Non quod alius audiat, alius sedeat, sed quia homini honor datur
propter dignitatem personae Filii DEI. Qui (ut loquitur Ambrosius, Lib. 2. de
Fide) non ex praecepto, neque ex gratia, sed quasi dilectissimus Filius ad
dextram DEI sedet. Et paulo post ibidem Ambrosius ait; CHRISTVS vt sedeat, non
quasi jussus obsequitur, sed quasi Filius dilectissimus honoratur.

Chrysostomus, Sermon. 2. in Epistolam ad Hebraeos, in Cap. 1. verse. 3. (...): id
est, Non dixit, quod jusserit vel imperaverit, sed quod dixerit, SEDE. Et hoc
propter nihil aliud, nisi vt eum nequaquam existimes esse sine principio, and
sine autore Deum Patrem autorem and principium Peleo vocat Aug. Lib. 3. contra
Maximinum. Capitib. 14. and 17.
. Quod enim propter hoc sic loquutus sit, manifestum est ex loco sedis. Idem
repetit Oecumenius, Comment. in Cap. 1. ad Hebraeos, explicans illa verba, Sede
a dextris meis; ubi ait hoc manifestum esse ex loco sedis, qui honoris
aequalitatem (...) indicat. Et addit; Vel quia alio modo non poterat Prophata
significare consensum ac voluntatem Patris vt sederet, vsus est verbo SEDE.
Magnum (inquit) hoc est, nec tantum supra humanam naturam, verumetiam super
omnem creaturam* Attamen ob humanam quoque naturam hoc ei dictum est [(...)]
nam Filius quatenus DEVS est sempiternum habet Thronum: Thronus tuus, inquit,
DEVS in seculum seculi. Neque enim post ^rucein and Passionem hoc honor
donatus est DEVS: sed vt homo accepit quod jam habebat vt DEVS -- vt homo
igitur audit, SEDE A DEXTRIS MEIS; Nam vt DEVS aternum habet Imperium. Haec
Oecumenius.

DOMINVS Pater (inquit Ambrosius) DOMINO DEO CHRISTO FILIO Throni sui offert
sublimem consessum, honoris gratia ad dextram suam illum aeterna sede
constituit. Haec Ambros. in hunc Psalm.

Res ipsa, SEDE AD DEXTRAM MEAM. Quid hac (inquit Ambros. Poster. Apologia
David, Re^ ipsa*
Cap. 4.) potest dici praecellentius potestate, quae etiam carnem hominis ad
dexteram DEI collocavit? Et infirmum illud conditionis humanae, (postquam tamen
Verbum caro factam est) divinitati copulavit aeterna? Sede.
Idem in enarratione hujus Psalmi; Secundum co^suetudinem (inquit) nostram,
illi consessus offertur, qui aliquo opere perfecto victor adveniens, honoris
gratia promeretur vt sedea^. Ita ergo and homo JESUS CHRISTVS Passione suae
Diabolum superans, resurrectione sua inferna reserans, tanquam perfecto opere
ad Coelos victor adveniens, audit a DEO Patre; SEDE AD DEXTRAM MEAM. Nec miram
est si vnius sedis offertur Filio consessus a Patre, qui vnius est substantiae
and naturae cum Patre. Haec ille.

Idem ibidem: Quid sig^ ficet Christ sessio, quid ejusdem st^^tio ad dextram
Patri

Act. 7.


Videamus quae sit ratio quod idem DOMINVS a David sedens prophetatur, stans
vero a Stephano praedicatur: ECCE, VIDEO COELOS APERTOS, ET IESUM STANTEM AD
DEXTERAM DEI. Primo omnium DEVS qui incorporeus and invisibilis est, sedere aut
stare quomodo potest? Deinde autem quali subsectio sedeat DEVS qui infinitus
est and immensis, intra se ipse magis creaturam cunctam continens? Haec autem
propterea a sanctis viris dicta arbitror esse de DOMINO, non quo sint contraria
sibi, sed vt modo ejus POTENTIA, modo MISERICORDIA describatur. Nam vtique pro
potestate Regis sedere dicitur, pro bonitate intercessoris stare suggeritur. 1.
Joan. 2.
Ait enim beatus Apostolus; Quia Advocatum habemus apud Patrem, IESVM CHRISTVM.
IVDEX ergo est CHRISTVS, cum residet: ADVOCATVS est, cum assurgit. Iudex plane
Iudaeis, Advocatus Christianis. Hic enim stans apud Patrem, Christianorum licet
peccantium causas exorat: ibi residens cum Patre, Pharisaorum persequentium
peccata condemnat. Illis indignans vehementer vlciscitur, his interveniens
leniter miseretur. Hic stat, vt suscipiat Stephani Martyris spiritum: ibi
residet, vt condemnet Iudae Proditoris admissum. Haec ibi Ambrosius.

DEXTRA DEI, Non est corporis DEI pars; nam DEVS spiritus est incorporeus,
Dextra Dei
immensus, impartibilis, etc. Sed potentiam denotat and Majestatem CHRISTO
datam. Dextera DOMINI agit strenue, dextera DOMINI elata, PSALM. cxviij. Ubi
dextera potentiam denot^t. Et CHRISTUS de hac sua sessione dixit; Ab hoc
tempore videbitis filium hominis sedentem (...) ad dextram potentiae, MATTHEW.
xxvj.64. Et Apostolus de eadem ait; (...), HEBR. j.3. Sedit ad dexteram
Majestatis in excelsis. In quem locum Chrysostomus, (...): ^^ ratio, cur ad
dextram Christus, ut ostendatur aqualu Patri, quoad Deitatem.
id est, Dicens* AD DEXTRAM, non illi [Patri] figuram tribuit, sed eundem
ostendit honorem Filii and Patris. Idem in expositione hujus Psalmi; Vbi idem
est Thronus, ejusdem est Regni par honor, (...). Et paulo post; Quemadmodum nos
majorem Patre non dicimus, quia ad dextram habet sedem honoratissimam: sic
neque tu minorem dicito and inferiorem, (...): id est, Sed honor parem and
aequalem. Hoc enim communio sedis manifestum facit.

Sic Ambrosius in hunc Psalm. Ideo ad dextram sedit Filius, non quo praeferatur
Patri, sed ne inferior esse credatur.

Addit vero ibidem Ambrosius; Et ideo addextram Filius, quia secundum
Evangelium, ad dexteram oves, 2^ ratio, ut locum ovibus destinatum pastor
anticipet*
ad sinistram vero constituentur hoedi. Necesse es^ ergo vt ovium partem primus
Agnus obtineat, and sequuturo immaculato gregi locum Dux immaculatus anticipet:
sicut ait Ioannes in Apocalypsi, dicens, Hi sunt qui sequuntur agnum quocunque
vadit, Apocal, 1^.
qui se cum mulieribus non coinquinaverunt. Haec Ambrosius.

Eodem sensu Augustinus; Dicamus (inquit) quomodo id quod Altissimus suscepit
ex nobis in Coelu^ levaverit, ad dexteram. Patris collocaverit, ac fidei
nostrae certum pignus dederit, vt secura sint membra de tanto Capite,
fideliterque sperent ad ipsum se posse pervenire, quem jam credunt ad dextram
Patris sedere. 3^ ratio, (...) demonstretur eum accepisse potestatem
judicantis, secundum humanitatem.
Sessionem istam, dilectissimi, non accipiatis humanis membris positam, tanquam
Pater sedeat in sinistra, vt Filius sedeat ad dexteram, sed ipsam dexteram
intelligite Potestatem, quam accepit homo ille susceptus a DEO, vt veniat
judicaturus qui prius venerat judicandus. Lib. 2. de Symbolo ad Catechumenos,
Cap. 7. Et postea Lib. 3. Cap. 7. H^c (inquit) quod Filius dicitur sedere ad
dexeram Patris, demonstratur quod ipse homo quem suscepit CHRISTVS, potestatem
acceperit judicantis. Haec Augustinus.

Ambrosius Epist. 37. ad Irenaeum, explicans quomodo nos sedere fecerit DEUS in
coelestibus in CHRISTO, sicut docet Apostolus, Ephesians. 2. Quomodo nos viat^r^s
fideles in Christo sedeamus in coelestibus*
Non quo quisquam hominum (inquit) praerogativam sedendi meruerit in illa sede
DEI, de qua Pater soli Filio dixit, SEDE A DEXTRIS MEIS: sed quia in illa carne
CHRISTI per consortium ejusdem naturae, caro omnis humani generis honorata est.
Haec ibi. Sed addendum erat ex illo loco Apostoli, altiorem etiam, and solis
iis qui cum CHRISTO vivificati and suscitati sunt peculiarem, datam esse nobis
praerogativam and excellentiam sessionis in coelestibus in CHRISTO; qui ibi
sedet Caput nostrum, membris suis inde vigorem infundens, and locum aeternum
parans. Quem fide tenemus, and spe possidemus: quam spem velut Anima Anchoram
habemus tutam ac firmam, and ingredientem vsque in ea quae sunt intra velum:
quo praecursor pro nobis ingressus est JESUS. Hebr. 6.19.20. Benedixit nobis
DEVS omni benedictione spirituali in coelestibus in CHRISTO. Ephesians. 1.3.

Qui vicerit (inquit) dabo ei vt sedeat mecum in Throno meo; sicut and ego
vici, and sedi cum Patre meo in Throno ipsius. Quo se^su dicatur
compraehensores sedere in Throno Christi cum ipso,
Apocal. 3.21. Id quod intelligendum est de congrua quadam honoris
participatione, non autem de honoris aequalitate. Sicut alibi dixit; Ego
gloriam quam dedisti mihi, dedi iis, vt sint vnum, sicut and nos vnum sumus.
Ioann. 17.22. Ubi non idem est intelligendus unitatis modus inter CHRISTUM and
Fidele^, qui est inter DEUM Patrem and Filium: quamvis and hic and illic sit
beata quaeda^ unitas. Nempe inter Patrem and Filium substantialis, and inter
CHRISTUM and Ecclesiam Mystica ac Spiritualis, per qua^ effici dicimur divinae
consortes naturae. 2. Pet. 1.4.

Quando dicitur Filius sedere ad dexteram Patris, non separantur Pater and
Filius, Inseparabilis a Patre Filius.

Filius potentia Dei, de^tra Patris.


nam hi duo unum sunt; id est, unus indivisus DEUS. Ipse Filius est Potentia
DEI. 1. Cor. 1.24. Est effulgentia gloriae and character personae ipsius,
sustinens omnia verbo potentiae suae. Hebr. 1.3. Unde Ambrosius, Lib. 5. de
Fide, Cap. 1. ai^ Filium esse dexteram Patris.

Christi humanitas non est ubique.
Neque tamen existimandum est, quia Deitas ubique est, ideo CHRISTI humanitatem
jam ubique esse: nam pro^ectus est in Coelum. Act. 1.11. Ascendit in Coelos.
Ostenditur id testimoniis Sacr. (...).
Act. 2.34. Vel ut loquitur Paulus Apostolus, Supra omnes Coelos. Ephesians. 4.18.
Ibi sedet (...). Ephesians. 1.20. (...). Hebr. 1.3. (...). Hebr. 8.1. Coelum
Thronus DEI, Isai. 66.1. Habitaculum Sanctitatis, and gloriae ejus, Isai.

Justinius Martyr in Apolog. 2. pro Christianis; Quod vero (inquit) CHRISTVM
post resurrectionem a mortuis Pater omnium DEVS Coelo illaturus fuerit, Et
t^stim niis patru^
atque ibi tantisper detenturus [(...)] dum hostiliter adversantes ei daemones
percutiat, and eoru^ numerus qui boni atque probati esse ab eo praecogniti
sunt, expleatur; propter quos etiam nondum extremam rerum consummationem fecit:
Prophetae Davidis a^dite verba, quae sunt haec; DIXIT DOMINVS DOMINO MEO, SEDE
A DEXTRIS MEIS, DONEC PONAM INIMICOS TVOS SCABELLVM PEDVM TVORVM. Virgam
virtutis emittet, etc. Haec Justinius.

Ambrosius Tractatu in Symbolum Apostolorum, Cap. 6. Vnius locspatio
cont^^netur Chr^^^tus ratio^ corporis*
Sequentes (inquit) Filium DEI IESUM, qui penetravit Coelos, and in dextera DEI
sedens, and omni consistens loco, nihil suae prasentiae vacuum derelinquit:
licet eum vnius loci spatio contineri ratione corporis pro nostra salute
suscepti putemus, non tamen circumscriptam Divinitatis and Incorporalitatis
suae naturam. Et postea Cap. 22. Mane^ veri^tas carnis.
Haec (inquit) vera resurrectio, quae sic gloriam tribuit carni, vt non auferat
veritatem. Haec Ambrosius.

Noli itaque dubitare (inquit August. Epist. 57.) IBI nunc esse hominem
CHRISTVM IESVM, vnde venturus est, memoriterque recole, and fideliter tene
Christianam confessionem, quoniam resurrexit a mortuis, ascendit IN COELVM,
sedet ad dextram Patris, NEC ALIVNDE QVAM INDE venturus est ad vivos m^rtuosque
judicandos. Ibi manes ^adem forma, substan^ia, and naturae corporis.
Et sic venturus est illa Angelica voc^ testante, quemadmodum ire visus est in
Coelum; id est, in eadem corporis forma atque substantia, cui profecto
immortalitatem dedit, naturam non abstulit. Secundum hanc formam NON EST
PVTANDVS VBIQVE DIFFVSVS. Cavendum est enim, ne ita Divinitatem adstruamus
hominis, vt veritatem corporis auferamus. -- Vna enim persona DEUS and homo
est, and vtrumque est vnus CHRISTUS JESUS, vbique per id quod DEUS est, IN
COELO AVTEM PER ID QVOD HOMO. Haec August. Epist. 57. ad Dardanum, in solutione
quaest. 1. Idem etiam tractatu 50. in Evangelium Ioannis; Secundum carnem quam
Verbum assumpsit, impletur quod ab eo dictum est, non semper habebitis me
vobiscum. Non est hic, ibi est ad ^extram Patris.
Quare? Quoniam conversatudest secundum corporis praesentiam 40 diebus cum
discipulis suis, and eis deducentibus videndo, non sequendo, ascendit in
Coelum, ET NON EST HIC: IBI ENIM SEDET AD DEXTERAM Patris: and hic est* non
enim recessit praesentia Majestatis. Et Sermon. 146. de tempore; Ascendit in
Coelum, IBI EST AD DEXTRAM Patris, non est venturus nisi in vltimo seculo ad
judicandum vivos and m^rtuos. Hactenus August.

DONEC, (...)] monent Chrysostomu^ in hunc Psalmum, DONEC.
and Oecumenius in Cap. 1. ad Hebraeos, ex Photio and Gregorio Nazianzeno,
(...) non esse hic temporis terminum, ac si sedere desiturus esset post
debellationem hostium, sed eo tantum significari certudinem victoriae. Sic
Theodoretus in hunc Psalmum; Haec (inquit) particula, DONEC, non Tempus
significat, sed Sacrarum Literarum est Idioma: sic per vatem ait DEVS, and
donec seni^ confecti eritis, ego sum Esai. 46.4. simile est dictum illud
Apostolicum, ^portet enim ipsum regnare donec ponat omnes inimicos sub pedes
suos, 1. Cor. 15.25. Attamen, ut praedixit Daniel, and postea Gabriel, Regni
ejus non erit finis, and sancti cum eo aeternum regnabunt. Illam autem regni
traditionem DEO ac Patri, Quo sens^ dicatur CHRISTVS traditur^^ Regnum DEO and
Patri.
1. Cor. 15.24. Recte interpretatur Chrysostomus ibi, and in hunc Psalmum, non
abdicationem, sed (...); id est, perfectionem regni per plenariam subjugationem
omnis adversariae potestatis. Ut patet ex verbis Apost. eodem versu. Add
interpretationem illam Augustini; Quid est ergo (inquit) CVM TRADIDERIT REGNVM
DEO ET PATRI: Quasi modo non habeat Regnum DEVS and Pater? Sed quia omnes
justos, in quibus nunc regnat ex fide viventibus, Mediator Dei and hominum,
homo Christus Jesus perducturus est ad speciem, quam visionem dicit idem
Apostolus, facie and faciem: Ita dictum est, Cum tradiderit Regnum Deo and
Patri; ac si diceretur, cum perduxerit credentes ad contemplationem Dei and
Patris. Haec Augustinus, Lib. 1. de Trinitate, Cap. 8. Ubi evacuationem
Principatus omnis and Potestatis aliter interpretatur quam Chrysostomus, sic
enim Augustinus; Tunc revelabitur a Filio Pater, cum evacuaverit omnem
Principatum, and omnem Potestatem and virtutem; id est, vt necessaria non sit
dispensatio similitudinum per Angelicos principatus, and potestates and
virtutes. Haec ille. Simplicior tamen and tutior videtur illa Chrysostomi
interpretatio, de evacuatione potastatis Daemonum dominantium adhuc in tenebris
hujus seculi, and servis DEI bella moventium, Ephesians. 6. Quomodo etiam verba
haec interpretatus est author quaest. and Resp. ad Orthodoxos, quae Iustino
Martyri tribuuntur, ad qu. 81. and favet Justinius Apol. 2. verbis superius
citatis.

Eodem sensu legitur DONEC, ut certam operis perfectionem, non autem Temporis
limitationem designet, Genes. 28.15. Psalm. 112.8. Math. 1. ultimo.

PONAM] Quicquid facit Pater ad extra, id facit Filius, PONAM.
id facit Spiritus Sanctus. Ideo recte Augustinus; Nec quisquam (inquit) ita
existimet de Patre intelligendu^, quod subjecerit omnia Filio, vt ipsum Filiu^
sibi omnia subjecisse non putet. Quod Apostolus ad Philip. ostendit, Philip. 3.

Opera Trinitatis ad extra sunt ^ndivis^.


dicens, Nostr^ autem conversatio in Coelis est, vnde and Salvatorem expectamus
DOMINVM IESVM CHRISTVM, qui transfigurabit corpus humilitatis nostrae conform
vt fiat corpori gloriae suae, secundum operationem suam qua possit etiam sibi
subjicere omnia. Inseparabilis enim operatio est Patris and Filii, alioquin nec
ipse Pater sibi subjecit omnia, sed Filius ei subjecit, qui ei Regnum tradit,
and evacuat omnem principatum. Ipse enim subjicit, qui evacuat. Nec sic
arbitremu^ CHRISTVM traditurum Regnum DEO and Patri, vt adimat sibi, etc. Haec
August. Lib. 1. de Trinitate, Cap. 8.

Chrysostomus etiam in hunc Psalmum, ut oste^dat CHRISTVM sibi hosts
subjicere, adducit illud Pauli Apostoli testimonium, Oportet illum regnare
donec ponat inimicos sub pedes suos, 1. Cor. 15.25.

Christus (...) ad de^t^am DEI, tum ut Rex, tum ut Sac^^d^s.
Hic autem meminisse debemus, CHRISTVM hominem esse ad dexteram Potentiae and
Majestatis in Coelestibus, non solum ut omnium daeredem and Regem, Hebr. 1. Sed
etiam ut Sacerdotem, Romans 8. Hebr. 8. Qui non solum jure and autoritate Regali
praesi^ Coelo and terrae, sed etiam sacerdotali intercessione obtineat ut
quicquid fieri vult, id effectum reddat Divina Omnipotentia. Gaudete vos vere
Christiani. Nemo rapiet CHRISTI Oves de man^ ejus. Vae inimicis CHRISTI, nisi
ex inimicis fiant amici.

Scabellum pedibus tuis.
SCABELLVM PEDIBVS] Id est, sub pedibus, 1. Cor. 15.25. Ephesians. 1.22. Omnes
oportet substerni pedibus ejus: aut per gratiam, qua ex inimico fit humilis
Cultor ejus, aut per victoriam Regis ac Iudicis, ad poenam aeternam. Quaere
ergo quem locum habeas sub pedibus DEI tui; Nam necesse est haebeas, aut
gratiae, aut poenae? ait August. in hunc locum. Non solum terra dicitur
scabellum pedum DOMINI, Esai. 66.1. and terreni homines, seu inimici ejus hoc
loco; sed etiam Sanctuarium ejus in terris appellatur scabellum pedum ejus, seu
locus pedum ejus, Psalm. 99. and Esai. 60.13. Thre^. 2.1.

Qui inimici ponuntur scabellum pedum ejus? Respondet Augustinus in hunc
Psalmum: INIMICOS ^VOS.

Psalm. ^.


Quibus frementibus and inania meditantibus dicitur; quare fremu^r^nt Gentes,
and populi meditati sunt inania, etc. dixit DOMINVS. Fremant illi, meditentur
inania, perstrep^nt, numquid non implebitur? Haec ille.

Theodoretus in hunc locum; Inimici ejus potissimum Diabolus, and hujus
ministri D^mones, and qui ejus Divinis Praeconiis resistunt, nimirum Iudaei and
Graeci.

Augustinus Iudaeis and Paganis addit Haereticos, and falso fratres, in quorum
omnium medio CHRISTUS praedicitur dominaturus.

Latius and before existimo exponi posse inimicos hoc loco, quatuor ordinum.
Quatu^^ ordines inimic^ru^ Christ^.


1. Diabolus diserte appellatur (...), Matthew. 13.39. Cui adjunge (...); id est,
spiritus immundos, Luc. 10.19. Lucta nobis est adversus Principatus and
Potestates, adversus (...) mundipotentes tenebrarum seculi hujus, contra
spiritualia nequitiae, in coelestibus, Ephesians. 6.12.

2. Peccatum est inimicum DEO contra quem admittitur, and homini qui hoc veneno
a serpente perimitur, aut seipsum perimit: (...), nempe homini peccatori: item
(...) (...), etc. Romans 8. Hinc in viatoribus regenitis lucta illa inter carnem
and Spiritum, Romans 7. Gal. 5.

3. Mundus ingentem sub Diaboli vexillo ducit exercitum; tum hominum credere
Evangelio recusantium, credentes persequentium, doctrinam aut pacem Catholicam
turbantium; tum malarum tenrationum, a dextris and a sinistris irruentium.
(...), 1. Ioann. 5.19.

4. Denique mors inimicis CHRISTI membrorumque ejus accensetur, 1. Cor. 15.26.

Hos omnes inimicos vincit, debellat, and sibi subjicit CHRISTVS, eo rundemque
victores nos omnes facit quicunque in illo fiduciam puro cord habemus, Omnium
inimicorum nos facit victores. Colos. 3.1.
quicunque sapimus and quaerimus quae sunt sursum, ubi CHRISTVS est ad dexteram
DEI sedens, Coloss. 3.1.

1. Diabolum sub pedibus nostris conterit, Romans 16.20. 1. Dat nobis victoriam
de Diabolo.
Hebr. 2.14.15. Apocal. 12.11. Omnemque ejus hostilem potentiam, Luc. 10.19.
Clemens Alexandrinus, Lib. 4. Stromatum; Si quis (inquit) altercans dicat: and
quomodo fieri potest vt caro imbecilla resistat potestatibus and spiritibus
dominationum? Illud sciat, quod Omnipotenti and DOMINO freti in eoque habentes
fiduciam adversamur potestatibus tenebrarum and morti. [(...),] adhuc te
loquente, inquit, dicet, ecce adsum. Isai. 58. Invictus adjutor noster.
Vide adjutorem invictum, qui nos defendit, (...).

2. Peccatum opus Diaboli, ut solveret manifestatus est Filius DEI, 2. De
peccato.
1. Ioann. 3.8. Datur nobis tum contra reatum peccati, tum contra pestiferam
ejus luem victoria per sanguinem Agni, qui mundat nos ab omni peccato, 1. Joan.
1.7. Qui Agnus DEI tollit peccatum mundi, Joan. 1.29. Purgationem peccatorum
nostroru^ per se ipsum fecit, Hebr. 1.3. Lavit nos a peccatis nostris in
sanguine suo, Apocal. 1.5. In illo habemus redemptionem per sanguinem ipsius,
remissionem peccatorum, secundum divitias gratiae ipsius, Ephesians. 1.7. Eum
proposuit DEUS placamentum per fidem in sanguine ipsius, Romans 3.25. Hinc per
eum pacem habemus cum DEO, Romans 5.1. In illius mortem baptizati sumus, Romans
6.3. Perillum liberati a Lege, constituimur sub gratia, unde fit, ut non
dominetur nobis peccatum, Romans 6. and Cap. 8. Verse. 2.3.4. Qui sunt CHRISTI,
carnem crucifixerunt cum affectibus and cupiditatibus, Galat. 5.24. Ille nos
gratia sua sufficient semper efficaciter solatur and sustentat, 2. Cor. 12.9.

3. De mundo etiam ejusque omnigenis copiis victoriam nobis donat: Confidite,
ego vici mundum, 3. De mun^do.
Joan. 16. ultimo. Omne quod natum est ex DEO, vincit mundum; and haec est
victoria quae vincit mundum, fides nostra. Quis est ille qui vincit mundum,
nisi qui credit quod JESUS est Filius DEI? 1. Ioann. 5.4.5. Per illum mundus
nobis crucifixus est, and nos mundo, Galat. 6.14. Plusquam victores nos facit
ille qui dilexit nos, Romans 8.37. Qui nunquam nos deseret neque derelinquet,
adeo ut confidenti animo dicamus; DOMINVS est mihi adjutor, nec metuam quid
faciat mihi homo, Hebr. 13.5.6. Hinc omnia valemus per CHRISTVM qui nos
corroborat, Philip. 4.13. Scientes iis qui diligunt DEUM omnia cooperari in
bonum: and illum qui proprio filio non pepercit, sed pro nobis omnibus tradidit
eum, omnia etiam cum eo nobis gratificaturum, Romans 8.28.32.

4. Ultimus hostis aboletur mors, 1. Cor. 15.26. 4. De more


Mortis autem, per DEI gratiam in CHRISTO nobis datam, ^ictores ^o^tis (...) in
hac (...).
victores constituimur, tum in hac vita, tum in vita futura.

Nam in hac vita per CHRISTVM liberamur a metu mortis, Hebr. 2.15. Mortis,
inquam, TVM AETERNAE illius quae secunda mors dicitur: ^um aeternae ^ortis,
quae ^^cunda di^^tur.
Nullae enim condemnatio est iis qui sunt in CHRISTO IESV, Romans 8.1. Et
Spiritus ejus testatur una cum spiritu nostro, nos esse DEI filios, ibidem
verse. 16. Adeoque nullam esse nobis condemnationem. Hic spiritus non est
servitutis ad metum, sed adoptionis spiritus, per quem clamamus, Abba, Pater,
ibidem verse. 15. Et Servator noster ait; Amen, Amen, dic^ vobis, qui Sermonem
meum audit, and credit ei qui misit me, habet vitam aeternam: and in
condemnationem non veniet; sed transivit a morte in vitam, Ioann. 5.24. Qui ex
hoc pane vitae comederit, non morietur, sed vivet in aeternum, habet vitam
aeternam, Ioann. 6.50.51.54. TVM etiam TEMPORALIS mortis qua eorpus moritur
victores fimus, ^um tempo^alis mortis, ^ua moritur (...): cujus ^e^um vin^i^us.
in hac vita, vincendo mortis metum, tergemina eaque haud quaquam fallente
persuasione and confidentia.

1. Quia persuasi sumus neque morte^ neque vitam posse nos separare a charitate
DEI quae est in CHRISTO IESV DOMINO nostro, Romans 8.38.39.

2. Quia scimus si terrestris hujus domus nostrae tabernaculum dissolutum
fuerit, Secunda ^ertitudo p^r ^uam in ha^ ^ita mortem ^^rporis (...).
aedificium ex DEO habituros, domicilium videlicet, non manufactum, aeternum in
Coelis, 1. Cor. 5.1. Confidentes igitur semper, and scientes nos dum adsumus in
corpore, peregre abesse a DOMINO: (per fidem enim ambulamus, non per speciem)
confidente autem animo sumus, and gratius est nobis abesse potius ex corpore,
and adesse apud DOMINVM, ibidem versib. 6.7.8.

Cyprian.
Hinc Cyprianus; Quod interim (inquit) morimur, ad immortalitatem, morte
transgredimur: nec potest vita aeterna succedere, nisi hinc contigerit exire,
Non (...) sed transit^^.
NON EST EXITVS ISTE, SED TRANSITVS, and temporali itinere decurso, ad aeterna
transgressus. Quis non ad meliora festinet? Lib. de Mortalitate. Et supra eodem
Libro; Ejus est mortem timere, qui ad CHRISTVM nolit ire: ejus est ad CHRISTVM
nolle ire, qui se non credat CVM CHRISTO INCIPERE REGNARE. Scriptum est enim,
Iustum fide vivere. Tunc in^^piunt regn^^re cum Chr^^sto.
Si justus es, and fide vivis, si vere in DEVM credis, cur non, cum CHRISTO
futurus, and de DOMINI pollicitatione securus, quod ad CHRISTVM voceris,
amplecteris; and quod Diabolo careas? SIMEON loetus de morte jam proxima, and
de vicina accersitione securus, accepit in manus Puerum, and benedicens DEVM,
exclamavit, and dixit; Nunc dimittis servum tuum, DOMINE, secundum verbum tuum,
in pace; quoniam viderunt oculi mei Salutare tuum. Probans, scilicet, atque
contestans tunc esse servis DEI pacem, tunc liberam, Luc. 2. Tunc est pa^ Dei
servis quando hi^^ migraveri^
tunc tranquillam quietem, quando de istis mundi turbinibus extracti, sedis and
securitatis aternae portum petimus, quando expuncta hac morte ad immortalitatem
venimus. Illa est enim nostra pax, illa fida tranquillitas, illa stabilis and
firma and perpetua securitas. Et paulo post; DEVS tecum loquitur, and tu mente
incredula perfidus fluctuas? Hoc sine dubitatione credend^^.
DEVS de hoc mundo recedenti tibi immortalitatem pollicetur, and tu dubitas?
Hoc est DEVM omnino non nosse; hoc est, CHRISTVM credentium DOMINVM and
Magistrum peccato incredulitatis offendere; hoc est, in Ecclesia constitutum,
fidem in domo fidei non habere. Quantum prosit exire de seculo, CHRISTVS ipse
Salutis atque vtilitatis nostrae MAGISTER ostendit; qui cum Discipuli ejus
contristarentur, quod se jam diceret recessurum, locutus est ad eos, dicens;
Ioann. 14. (...)
Si me dilexissetis, gauderetis, quoniam vado ad Patrem: docens, scilicet, and
ostendens, cum chari, quos diligimus, de seculo exeunt, GAVDENDVM POTIVS QVAM
DOLENDVM: Lucrum maximum computat Apostolus pressuris exemptum ad laetitiam
salutis aeternae, ^rosiciscun^^^ ad l^ti^iam salutis ^tern^.
CHRISTO vocante, proficisci. Et postea; Mori plane timeat, sed qui ex aqua and
spiritu non renatus, gehennae ignibus mancipatur: Mori timeat, qui non CHRISTI
cruce and passione censetur: Mori timeat, qui ad secundam mortem de hac morte
transibit: Mori timeat, quem de seculo recedentem, perennibus poenis aeterna
flamma torquebit: Mori temeat, cui hoc mora longiore confertur vt cruciatus
ejus and gemitus interim differatur. Mortalitas ista vt Iudeis and Gentilibus
and CHRISTI hostibus pestis est, Saelutari^ ^xcessus.
ita DEI servis salutaris excessus est. Hoc quod sine vllo discrimine generis
humani, cum injustis moriunt^r and justi; no^ est quod putetis bonis and malis
interitu^ esse communem. AD REFRIGERIVM IVSTI VOCANTVR, Ad refrige^um.
ad supplicium rapiuntur injusti. Et inferius; Nobis praeceptum est, vt
contestarer assidue and public praedicarem, Non lugen^i, non a^ittuntur, ^ed
praemit^untur.
fratres nostros non esse lugendos accersitione DOMINICA de seculo liberatos;
cum sciamus non eos AMITTI, sed PRAEMITTI, recedentes praecedere, vt
proficiscentes, vt navigantes solent: DESIDERARI eos debere, Desiderari debent,
non ^langi.
non PLANGI: non accipiendas esse hic atras vestes, quando illi ibi indumenta
alba jam sumpserint: Occasionem dandam non esse Gentilibus, vt nos merito ac
jure reprehendant, quod quos vivere apud DEVM dicimus, vt extinctos and
perditos lugeamus. Vivunt apud DEVM.
Et postea; Potius, fratres dilectissimi, mente integra, fide firma, virtute
robusta, parati ad omnem voluntate^ Dei simus: Pavore mortis excluso,
immortalitate^ quae sequitur cogitemus. Hoc nos ostendamus esse quod credimus,
vt neque charorum lugeamus excessum: and cum accersitionis propriae dies
venerit, incunctanter and libenter ad DOMINVM ipso vocante veniamus. Et paulo
post; Amplectamur diem, Libenter moriamu^ qui^ ad Dominu^ imus: Paraedis^
restituimur (...) Regno Coelesti.
qui assignat singulos domicilio suo; qui nos istinc ereptos, and laqueis
secularibus exsolutos Paradiso restituit, and Regno Coelesti. Quis non peregre
constitutus properaret in Patriam regredi? Patriam nostram Paradisum
computamus, Parents Patriarchas habere jam caepimus; quid non properamus and
currimus, vt Patriam nostram videre, vt Parents salutare possimus? Patriae
nostra Pa^adisus.
Magnus illicinos charorum numerus expectat, Parentum, fratrum, filiorum
frequens nos and copiosa turba desiderat, jam de sua immortalitate secura, and
adhuc de nostra salute sollicita, ad horum conspectum and complexum venire,
quanta and illis and nobis in commune laetitia est? Qualis illic Coelestium
Regnorum voluptas sine timore moriendi, and cum ^ternitate vivendi? Quam summa
et perpetua foelicitas? Illic summ^ and perpetuae foelicitas, cum Apostolis,
and Prophetis, etc*
Illic Apostolorum gloriosus chorus: Illic Prophetarum exultantium numerus:
Illic Martyrum innumerabilis populus ob certaminis et passionis victoriam
coronatus: Triumphantes illic Virgins, quae concupiscentiam carnis et
corporis, continentiae robore subegerunt; Remunerati misericordes qui alimentis
et largitionibus pauperum justitiae opera fecerunt, qui DOMINICA Praecepta
servantes, ad Coelestes Thesauros terrena patrimonia transtulerunt. Ad hos,
fratres dilectissimi, avida cupiditate properemus; vt cum his cito esse, vt
cito ad CHRISTVM venire contingat, optemus. Haec omnia Cyprianus, Lib. de
Mortalitate.

Ex his patet quae fuerit Cypriani sententia, destatu animarum a corporibus
separataru^: nempe, Status omnium animarum, a corporibus separ^taru^* qua ad
secund^^ mortem non transeunt.
omnes fidelium animas, omnes hominu^ animas quae gehennae ignibus non
mancipantur ibique aeternis poenis torquentur, quaecunque ad secundam mortem
non transeunt; eas omnes, moriente corpore, ad CHRISTUM ire, cum CHRISTO
incipere regnare, pacem and liberam ac tranquillam quietem tunc consequi, sedis
and securitatis aeternae Portum petere, ad immortalitatem venire, and fidam
tranquillitatem, stabilemque and firmam ac perpetuam securitatem, ad laetitiam
salutis aeternae proficisci, ad refrigerium vocari, non amitti, sed praemitti:
Ad DOMINUM venire, Paradiso restitui and Regno Coelesti, in Patriam regredi;
ibique apud DEUM vivere, in summa and perpetua foelicit^^e esse, cum Apostolis
and Prophetis, and Martyribus. Unde colligit, cum chari, quos diligimus, de
seculo exeunt, gaudendum potius quam dolendum; desiderari eos debere, non
plangi, nec accipiendas esse hic atras vestes, quando illi ibi indumenta alba
jam sumpserint: and cum accersitionis propriae dies venerit, nos debere
incunctanter and libenter ad DOMINUM ipso vocante venire: amplecti diem qui nos
Paradiso restituit and Regno Coelesti.

Quae certe commentitios Purgatorii cruciatus prorfus evacuant. Excluditur
PVRGATORIVM e rerum natura.
Quod figmentum illa etiam ratio evidenter evertit, qua utitur Cyprianus ut
Christianis timorem mortis excutiat; quia videlicet, solis reprobis hoc mora
longiore confertur, ut cruciatus eorum and gemitus interim differatur. Quod
utique verum esse non posset, si alicui electo statim post mortem sustinendus
esset cruciatus Purgatorii, ut somniant Papistae: quos idcirco mirum non est
illibenter ac trepidantes mori, Mors Papistaru^ horroris plena.
moram semper longiorem optantes, qua cruciatus quem in Purgatorio sustinendum
sibi metuunt, interim differatur. Cyprianus autem manifest docuit, omnes
Fideles, omnes qui CHRISTI Cruce and Passione censentur, omnes qui ad secundam
mortem de hac morte non transeunt, quando de seculo exeunt eximi pressuris, and
ad laetitiam salutis aeternae CHRISTO vocante proficisci, and illo die quo hinc
exeunt exsolvi laqueis, Paradiso restitui, in Patriam regredi.

Iacobus Pamelius injusto glossemate patrocinium Purgatorii affingit Cypriano,
scribenti ad Antonianum, Epist. 52. Refe^^itu^ falsa glossa Pamol^^.
Aliud esse pro peccatis longo dolor cruciatum emendari, et purgari diu igni;
aliud peccata omnia passione purgasse. Neque enim illis verbis loquitur
Cyprianus de igne aliquo purgante post mortem corporalem, sed de dolor
poenitentium in hac vita, quo tanquam igne cruciati purgantur. Non enim
comparatio illic instituitur a Cypriano inter defunctos glorificatos, and
defunctos cruciatos; sed inter Martyrs qui alacriter pro CHRISTI Nomine vitam
suam ponunt, and lapsos, ad poenitentiam admissos. Quod sic probo, 1. Ex verbis
ipsius Cypriani eodem illo loco; Nec putes frater charissime, hinc aut virtutem
fratrum minui, aut martyriae deficere, quod lapsis laxata sit poenitentia, and
quod poenitentibus spes pacis oblata. Manet vere fidentium robur immobile, and
apud timentes ac diligentes cord toto DEVM stabilis and fortis perseverat
integritas. Nam and moechis a nobis poenitentiae tempus conceditur, and pax
datur, non tamen idcirco virginitas in Ecclesia deficit, aut continentiae
propositum gloriosum per aliena peccata languescit. Floret Ecclesia tot
virginibus coronata, and castitas ac pudicitia tenorem gloriae suae servat, nec
quia adultero poenitentia and venia laxatur, continentiae vigor frangitur.
Aliud est, ad veniam stare, aliud ad gloriam pervenire: Matthew. 5.
Aliud missum in carcerem non exire inde, donec solvat novissimum quadrantem;
1. Cor. 3.
aliud statim fidei and virtutis accipere mercedem: Aliud pro peccatis longo
dolor cruciatum emundari, and purgari diu igne; aliud peccata omnia passione
purgasse. Haec ibi. 2. Eodem modo accipit atque interpretatur ignem illum
(cujus mentio fit 1. COR. 3. Expositi^ ignis de quo, 1. Cor. 3.
) Augustinus in Enchiridio, Cap. 68. Nempe, ut ignis sit tentatio tribulationis
in hac vita, ustio autem sit dolor de amissione rerum temporalium quo uri
mavult poenitens, quam CHRISTO carere. Non autem intelligendum esse ignem illum
Purgatorii quem imaginantur Papistae, vel illa una ratio manifest evincit,
quam adfert Augustinus loco citato: Ignis (inquit) de quo loquutus est eo loco
Apostolus Paulus, talis debet intelligi, vt (...) per eum transeant, and qui
adificat aurum, and qui aedificat foenum: adjunxit enim; vniuscujusque opus
quale si^, ignis probabit, etc. Quo argumento etiam recedendum est ab
Expositione Chrysostomi, qui in Commentario illius loci, ignem illum
interpretatur ignem aeternum quo cruciantur damnati. 3. Perversam Pamelii
glossam destruit constans Cypriani doctrina de requie and laetitia in Paradiso,
quam omnibus animabus fidelium dari ait quando hinc exeunt. Hanc doctrinam
libro de Mortalitate, prolixe and perspicue tradidit. Et in eandem sententiam
scribit ad Demetrianum: Nec separari generi humano ab invicem datur, ^id^les,
and ser^o paenitenses sub ipsa morte Paradisus hospitium immortalitatis and
c^p^a Regn^ Coelestes excipit.
nisi istinc de seculo recedatur. Intra vnam domum boni and mali interim
continemur: quicquid intra domum evenerit, pari sort^ perpetimur; donec aevi
temporalis fine completo, ad aeternae vel mortis vel immortalitatis hospitia
dividamur. -- Quid hoc ad DEI Servos quos Paradisus invitat, quos gratia omnis
and copia regni Coelestis expectat? -- Qua^do istinc excessum fuerit, nullus
jam poenitentiae locus est, nullus satisfactionis effectus, hic vita aut
amittitur, aut tenetur; hic saluti aeternae cultu Dei, and fructu fidei
providetur. Nec quisquam aut peccatis retardetur aut annis, quo minus veniat ad
consequendam salutem. In isto adhuc mundo manenti poenitentia nulla sera est.
Patet ad indulgentia^ DEI aditus, and quaerentibus atque intelligentibus
veritate^ facilis accessus est. Tu sub ipso licet exitu and vit^ temporalis
occasu, pro delictis roges; and DEVM qui vnus and verus est, confessione and
fide agnitionis ejus implores: venia confitenti datur, and credenti indulgentia
salutaris de Divina pietate conceditur; and ad immortalitatem sub ipsa morte
transitur. Haec Cyprianus, prope finem Libri ad Demetrianum.

Manifestum est igitur Cyprianum constanter praedicasse transitum omniu^
animarum fidelium in Patriam Coelestem, seu Paradisum ipso die exitus e corpore.

Injustorum autem animae, in ipsius orci loca; per eo atque dictum est de

Similiter Hilarious, in fine Commentarii in Psalm. 2. Testes nobis sunt

Iudicii enim dies vel beatitudinis retributio est aeterna vel poenae. Tempus

Et Ambrosius; Primum Regnum Coelorum Sanctis propositum est in dissolutione

secundum Regnum Coelorum est post resurrectionem esse cum CHRISTO. Haec ille,
Comment. in Cap. 6. Lucae, in illa verba, Beati Pauperes, quia vestrum est
Regnum DEI. Idem, in fine Libri de Fide Resurrectionis, ait ex hoc vitae
anfractu discedentes Fidelium animas ad Concilia Superna contendere, and
Angelis sociari.

Chrysostomus, Homil. 3. de Lazaro, circa medium, ^hrysost.
omnes homines qui peccaverunt distinguit in tres ordines respectu poenarum,
quas propter peccata sua patiuntur: Alios dicit puniri hic duntaxat, and dat
exemplum in Lazaro, and tales ait hinc abire puros: Alios dicit nihil hic tale
pati, sed omnem vindictam illic recipere, and pro exemplo adducit Divitem
illum, ^uc. 16.
cui in flamma infernali ardenti negata est aquae guttula: Alios denique tum
hic, tum illic, puniri, and id probat exemplo Sodomitarum, Marc. 6.
quibus tolerabilius fore in die judicii quam contemptoribus Evangelii, docuit
DOMINVS noster. Unde etiam colligit Chrysostomus leviorem fore in inferno
poenam illorum damnatorum, qui hic aliquid supplicii pertulerunt. Ergo ex mente
Chrysostomi nulla poena, nullus cruciatus excipit quenquam electorum ex hac
vita egressum: soli enim reprobi post hanc vitam cruciantur; licet alii levius,
alii gravius. Idem Chrysostomus Homil. 5. in Genesin, ait Fideles illuc ire
(...), puros a peccatis: non enim possibile esse ut inveniat illic
consolationem aliquam qui in praesenti vita non fuerit ablutus a peccatis. Hoc
esse agonis and luctae tempus; illud coronarum and retributionum and praemiorum.

In requie (inquit) sunt animae piorum a corpore separatae: impiorum autem

Tertullianus ait Libro de resurrectione carnis, Patru^ ^^^rundam sententi^, de

Cap. 1. Fiducia Christianorum, resurrectio mortuorum.

Hoc est (inquit Augustinus) quod praecipue Christianos a Gentili errore
secernit -- hanc ipsam animam tunc habebimus quam modo habemus, August.
and in hoc ipso quo nunc induimur sumus corpore resuscitandi. -- Nemo ergo,
Fratres charissimi, de resurrectione desperet, in qua Christianorum spes tota
consistit. Haec Aug. Sermon. 34. de verbis Apostoli.

Epiphanius in Ancorato; Epiphan.
In carnis (inquit) resurrectione omnis thesaurus and fundamentum omnis
sapientis cogitationis, and omnis bonae operationis deposita. Item; Si non spes
fuisset resurrectionis, qualis esset ossium cura, vt de corruptibilibus ossibus
praeciperent justi? Sicut Joseph.

Irenaeus, Lib. 5. adversus Haereses, prolixe adstruit resurrectionem corporum
nostrorum, Irenaei.
ita ut non alia, sed haec ipsa quae gestamus corpora, quae Spiritus Sancti
Templa, and CHRISTI membra sunt, per DEI potentiam reviviscant. Id quod etiam
Athenagoras, Lib. de resurrectione mortuorum, Athenag. and Ambros.
and Ambrosius Lib. de fide resurrectionis, and Tertullianus ac Epiphanius
locis citatis, confirmant plurimis argumentis.

Hieronymus Epistola ad Pammachium, Hieronym.
adversus errores Ioannis Hierosolymitani* Procedent (inquit) demonumentis, ros
enim qui a DEO est, medulla est ossibus ipsorum. Tunc implebitur quod DOMINVS
loquitur per Prophetam: Populus meus intra in cellaria tua aliquantulum, donec
ira mea transeat. Isa* 26.
Cellaria sepulchra significant, de quibus hoc vtique profertur, quod conditum
fuerat: and exibunt de sepulchris suis veluti hinnuli de vinculis soluti, etc.
Plura ibi Lector inveniet.

Hinc AVGVSTINVS commendat curam and officiosam pietatem circa funera justorum,
propter fidem resurrectionis adstruendam, Cur^ Funeris.
Lib. 1. de Civitate DEI, Cap. 13. Etsi curatio funeris, conditio sepulturae,
and pompa exequiarum, magis sunt vivorum solatia, quam subsidia mortuorum.
Christianis autem, and ipsius carnis, and membrorum omnium reformatio, non
solum ex terra, Redintegratio corporum dispersorum.
verumetiam ex aliorum elementorum secretissim^ sinu, quo dilapsa cadavera
recesserunt, in temporis puncto reddenda and redintegranda promittitur. Ut
loquitur Augustinus eodem Libro, Cap. 12.

Non soli autem resurgent justi, sicut somniarunt nonnulli ex infidelibus
Iudaeis, qui dixerunt impiorum animas cum corporibus interire, Refe^^itur
Kimchii de^irtum.
and non esse iis resurrectionem; in quo errore fuit Rabbi David Kimchi,
Comment. in Psalm. 1. and in finem Psalm. 17. and in Psalm. 49. Nam dormientium in
pulvere terrae evigilabunt alii in vitam aeternam, and alii in opprobrium,
Daniel 12.2. Omnes qui in monumentis sunt, audient vocem Filii DEI, and
prodibunt, qui bona fecerunt, in resurrectionem vitae: qui vero mala egerunt,
Discrimen resurrectionis justorum and resurr. impiorum.
in resurrectionem condemnationis, Ioann. 5.28.29. Et Paulus Apostolus ait fore
resurrectionem mortuorum, tum justorum, tum injustorum, Act. 24.15. Non tamen
impii hac resurrectione victoriam ullam consequentur, sed tanquam rei e carcere
mortis prioris extracti, sistentur coram Iudice, ejusque sententia damnabuntur,
and tradentur morti secundae.

Quamvis autem Kimchius putaverit animas impiorum mori cum corporibus, Quida^
Rabbi^i^ agn^verunt impiorum resurr. and p^nam a^ernam.
neque fore impiis resurrectionem; alii tamen nonnulli ex Rabbinis Iudaeorum,
agnoverunt impiorum sempiternam poenam: Nam Rabbi Joseph Targumista, in sua
Chaldaea Paraphrasi in Psalm 1. dictum illud Prophetae (...) non resurgent impii
in judicium, interpretatur: (...) Id est, Non justificabuntur [vel non
invenientur innocentes] impii in die Magno. Et in Paraphrasi Psalmi 49. Vivet
(inquit) bonus in vitam aeternam, non videbit judicium gehennae: quia sapientes
videbunt impios in gehenna. Haec ille. Idem de gehenna, Gehenna.
quod sit locus in quo animae impiorum post corporis mortem puniuntur,
tradiderunt Elias Levita, and Rabbi Joseph Castiliensis, verbis illis quae ex
eorum Libris citantur a Guidone Fabricio, in suo Dictionario Syro-Chaldaico, in
radice (...) in apparatu Bibliorum Reg. Et veteres Pharisaeos credidisse
resurrectione^ impiorum, testatur Paulus Apost. Act. 24.15.

Impiorum etiam resurrectionem sustulerunt illi Haeretici, quos Philastrius
scribit dixisse, Error quorundam Haereticorum de animabu^ impiorum*
Animas impiorum transire in Daemones, ac pecudes, and bestias, ac serpents,
atque ita verti in aliam naturam. Quos refellit Philastrius, in Catalogo
Herese^n, quae sub Apostolis extiterunt, Haeresi 73.

Recte Irenaeus, Lib. 1. adversus Haereses Valentini and similium,
resurrectionem carnis negantium, Cap. 19. Qui quidem (inquit) resurgent carne,
Irenaeus.
licet nollent, vti agnoscant virtutem suscitantis eos a mortuis. Cum justis
autem non adnumerabuntur, propter incredulitatem suam. Haec Irenaeus.

Gregorius Magnus, Lib. 14. Moralium, prope finem Libri, disserens de
Resurrectione, Gregorius.
docet corpus resurrecturum subtle quidem per effectum spiritalis potentiae,
sed palpabile per veritatem naturae. Resurge^ corpus palpabile.
Et quod Apostolus dicit, quia caro and sanguis Regnum DEI possidere non
possunt, recte interpretatur, intelligi carnem secundum culpam, 1. Cor. 1^.50
non carnem secundum naturam.

Si quem moveat ipsa temporalis mors justorum, Quaestio, (...) moriuntur justi,
qui^^^ ^^missa sunt peccata?
ac si victoria nobis promissa de morte, immunitatem postulare videatur ab hac
temporali separatione animae and corporis: quo argumento Haeretici Pelagiani
perperam contendebant hominem moriturum fuisse, etiamsi non peccasset: negantes
enim originale peccatum, negabant peccato factum esse ut moreremur; dicebant
autem, si ex peccato mors ista, tunc credentes in CHRISTVM, jam remisso
peccato, mortem istam non obituros. (...) ^espondens Augustinus, Lib. 2. de
peccatorum meritis and remissione, Capitibus 30.31.32.33.34. ai^ victores nos
constitui tum superando metum hujus mortis in hac vita, tum post mortem istam
resurgendo ad immortalitatem. Poterat autem (inquit) etiam hoc donare
credentibus, Cap. 31.
vt nec istius experirentur corporis mortem: Resp. Ad certamen sive agonem and
gloriam fidei, quae mortis me^^^ vincit.
sed si hoc fecisset, carni quaedam foelicitas adderetur, minueretur autem
fidei fortitudo. Quid enim magnum erat videndo non mori eos qui crederent,
credere se non moriturum? Quanto est majus, quanto fortius, quanto laudabilius
ita credere vt se speret moriturus, sine fine victurum? Haec LAVS FIDEI non
esset nec omnino fides esset, si homines in credendo proemiae visibiliae
sequerentur; hoc est, si fidelibus merces immortalitatis in hoc seculo
redderetur. Quandoquidem fides ita definita est; Fides est sperandorum
substantia, and convictio rerum quae non videntur. Quod timorem mortis fideles
vincunt, AD AGONEM IPSIVS FIDEI pertinet, qui profecto defuisset, si mox esset
credentes immortalitas consequuta.

Cap. 33.
Quaedam res sunt quarum REATVM ne post hanc vitam obsint, DEVS solvit, tamen
eas AD CERTAMEN FIDEI sinit manner, Sic post peccat^ remissionem afflictiones
eve^unt, qua (...) sunt jam suppli^^a (...), sed certamina ex^^citati^nesque
justorum proficientium (...) agone jus^^^tia.
VT PER ILLAS ERVDIANTVR ET EXERCEANTVR PROFICIENTES IN AGONE IVSTITIAE. Sicut
illud quod propter peccatum dixit DEVS homini; in sudore vultus tuiedes panem
tuum, and spinas and tribulos pariet tibi terra. Item quod dictum est mulieri;
In gemitu paries.

Ante remissionem sunt ista SVPPLICIA peccatorum, POST REMISSIONEM AVTEM CERT
AMINA EXERCITATIONES QVE IVSTORVM. Itae and illis quos de morte corporis
similiter movet, Cap. 3^*
respondere debemus, vt eam and peccato accidisse fateamur, and post peccatorum
remissionem, vt magnus TIMOR ejus a proficientibus superetur, AD CERTAMEN nobis
relictam esse non dedignemur. Si enim parva virtus esset fidei, quae per
dilectionem operatur, mortis METVM vincere, non esset tanta Martyrum gloria:
nec DOMINVS diceret, Ioann. 15.
Majorem hac charitatem nemo habet, quam ut animam suam ponat pro amicis suis.
Mortis igitur, cujus magna multumque dura molestia est, timorem qui vincit ex
fide, magnam ipsius FIDEI comparat GLORIAM, justamque mercedem. Vnde mirandum
non est, 2. Sam. 1^* Nota been Contra erroneam d^ctrinam Pa^pistarum, (...)

52. and 54.
and mortem corporis non fuisse eventuram homini, nisi praecessisset peccatum,
cujus etiam talis poena consequeretur, and POST REMISSIONEM PECCATORVM eam
fidelibus evenire, vt in ejus TIMORE vince^do EXERCERETVR FORTITVDO IVSTITIAE.
Tale aliquid nobis insinuatum est de Patriarcha David, in libro Regnorum, ad
quem Propheta cum missus esset eique propter peccatum quod commiserat eventura
mala ex iracundia DEI comminaretur, confessione peccati veniam meruit,
respondente Propheta, quod illud ei flagitium facinusque remissum sit, and
tamen consequuta sunt quae DEVS fuerat comminatus, vt sic humiliaretur a filio.
Quare and hic non dicitur, si DEVS propter peccatum illud fuerat comminatus,
cur dimisso peccato quod erat minatus implevit, nisi quia rectissime, si sic
dictum fuerit, respondebitur, remissionem illam peccati factam, ne homo a
percipienda vita impediretur aeterna; subsequutum vero illius comminationis
effectum, vt PIETAS HOMINIS in illa humilitate EXERCERETVR ATQVE PROBARETVR?
Sic and mortem corporis propter hoc peccatum DEVS homini inflixit, and post
peccatorum remissionem PROPTER EXERCENDAM IVSTITIAM non ademit. Haec ibi.

Ad eandem quaestionem idem Augustinus, Lib. 13. de Civitate DEI, Cap. 4.
respondet in hunc modum; Ista quaestio in alio nostro opere tractata and soluta
est, vbi dictum est; Ad hoc relinqui animae experimentum separationis a
corpore, quamvis ablato jam criminis nexu, quoniam si regenerationis
Sacramentum continuo sequeretur immortalitas corporis, ipsa fides enervaretur,
quae tunc est fides, quando expectatur in spe, quod in re nondum videtur, etc.

Idem alibi: Est autem fides nostra maxim discreta ab omni fide Gentilium in
resurrectione mortuorum, Sermon. 33. de verbis Apostoli.

Atque haec de victoria illa dixisse sufficiat, qua per DOMINUM nostrum IESUM
CHRISTUM, suorum nostrorumque hostium domitorem ac triumphatorem, superamus
mortem in hac vita.

Mortem, post hanc vitam, vincimu^, tribus victoriae gradi^us.
Eandem post hanc vitam eodem DOMINO donante vincimus tribus victoriae gradibus:
Primo gradu victores constituimur mortis secundae quoad animam jam cum
coelitibus beatam: licet corpus sub morte prima adhuc jaceat. Secundo gradu
victoriam consequimur de morte corporis, per gloriosam resurrectionem; in qua
resurrectione iterum CHRITVS tanqua^ suo resurget in corpore: ut pulchre
loquitur Ambrosius, Comment. primo in Cap. 17. Lucae. Tertio gradu de utraque
morte aeternum triumphamus in Regno illo Coelesti, de quo DOMINUS noster in
illo ultimo die illam ineffabilis consolationis plenissimam proferet
sententiam, dicens ovibus suis ad dexteram suam constitutis; Adeste benedicti
Patris mei, possidete Regnum paratum vobis a jacto mundi fundamento, Matthew.
25.34. Tunc fiet illud quod scriptum est; Absorpta est mors ad victoriam. Vbi
tuus, o mors, stimulus? Vbi tua, o Sepulchru^ [vel o Inferne, (...)] victoria?
Stimulus aute^ mortis est peccatum, vis autem peccati, Lex. Sed DEO sit gratia,
qui dat nobis victoriam per DOMINVM nostrum IESVM CHRISTVM. 1. Cor.
15.54.55.56.57. Sicut praedixit DOMINUS per Prophetam Hoseam; E potestate
Inferni [(...)] redimam eos, a morte redimam eos. Ero mors tua, O mors: Ero
morsus tuus, Inferne. Poenitudo abscondetur ab oculis meis, Hoseae 13.14. Tunc
perfect implebitur quod praedixit Esaias Propheta; Perdet mortem in
sempiternum, and absterget DOMINVS IEHOVA lachrymam ab omni facie: and
opprobrium populi sui auferet ab universa terra, Esaiae 25.8.

Quid igitur dicemus ad haec? Respondet Apostolus; Si DEVS pro nobis, quis
contra nos? Si DEVS pro nobis, quis contra nos?
Qui quidem proprio filio non pepercit, sed pro nobis omnibus tradidit ^um,
quomodo non etiam cum eo omnia nobis gratificabitur? Quis intentabit crimina
adversus electos DEI? DEVS est qui justificat: Quis est qui condemnet? CHRISTVS
qui mortuus est, imo vero qui etiam suscitatus est: qui etiam est ad dextram
DEI: CHRISTVS est ad dextram DEI, interpellant pro nobis.
qui etiam interpellat pro nobis. Quis nos separabit a charitate CHRISTI? Number
afflictio, number angustia, number persecutio, number fames, number nuditas, number periculum,
number gladius? (sicut scriptum est, Tui causa occidimur totum diem: reputati
sumus velut oves destinatae mactationi) Imo in his omnibus amplius quam
victores sumus [(...)] per eum qui dilexit nos. Nam mihi persuasum est, neque
mortem, neque vitam, neque Angelos, neque Principatus, neque Potestates, neque
praesentia, neque futura, neque sublimitatem, neque profunditatem, neque vllam
rem aliam creatam, posse nos separare a charitate DEI, qua est in CHRISTO IESV,
Gloriatio triumphalis.
DOMINO nostro, ROMANS 8. Omnibus inimicis bellum indicit, nec ipso quidem
excepto peccato, quod nonnulli cavillantur posse nos separare ab hac charitate
DEI: nam praesupponit electionem, and inde manantem vocationem secundum
propositum, adeoque justificationem irrevocabilem, quam infallibiliter sequitur
glorificatio: vnde infert triumphalem hanc quaestionem; Quid igitur dicemus ad
haec? Et memoratam responsionem prorsus invictam and triumphalem.

O beatos illos, quibus datur fideli cord dicere; Dixit DOMINVS DOMINO meo,
Sede ad dextram meam, donec ponam inimicos tuos scabellum pedibus tuis.

fruitur beatae memoriae genitor meus PATRICIVS FORBESIVS A CORSE, Episcopus
ABERDONIENSIS, qui in mediis tentationum quarumcunque fluctibus, erecto cord
and sublatis in Coelum oculis ac manibus, hoc semper in ore solamen habebat, se
certo scire, firmiter per DEI gratiam credere: DOMINVN nostrum IESVM CHRISTVM
sedere ad dextram DEI, neque possibile esse eum de Throno illo detrahere,
quantumcunque fremat ac tumultuetur vniversa hostium multitudo: sed ibi
sessurum constanter and dominaturum, donec ponantur inimiciomnes scabellu^

bellorum; non hostium techna, aut copiae, aut victoriae terrent, neque
dejiciunt piorum afflictiones, neque conturbat immanis quae oculis se ingerit

PARS TERTIA, De officiis imperatis hoc versu 1. Psalm. Cx. and qualiter in eis
se per DEI gratiam gesserit memoratus PATRICIVS.
QUIBVS autem itineribus ad uberrimam hanc consolationem pervenerit, quibus
studiis ad tantam animi magnitudinem profecerit, quibus gradibus ad hanc
Christianae fiduciae sublimitatem ascenderit, quo facilius percipere, et iisdem
vestigiis ad idem subvehi fastigium valeamus; missis aliis innumeris quibus
radiabat virtutibus, ea sola Christiani hominis officia intueamur, quae hoc
ipso quem tractamus Psalmi hujus versiculo commendantur, and in illo eximie
reluxerunt.

Primum officium est ut quaecunque occurrant dubia, quibuscunque infestemur
periculis, 1m officium* Studium Verbi DEI.
quicunque nos rerum anfractus impediant; Ad Verbum DEI nos convertamus,
consulamus os DOMINI, anquiramus quid DOMINVS dixerit. Hoc fiduciae Davidis
fundamentum ponitur, DIXIT IEHOVA.

Hujus officii nunquam immemor genitor meus (...), Patritius Sacrarum
Scripturaru^ studio addictissimus.
lectione Sacrarum Scripturarum earundemque meditatione assidua, and de iisdem
sermocinatione mirifice delectabatur: and palam profitebatur unicum aerumnarum
omnium crebro ingruentium solatium, and adversus tentationes propugnaculum, in
Verbo DEI scripto, and invocatione Nominis Divini constanter se invenisse.
Potens fuit in Scripturis; Potens in eis.
and usque adeo assuetudine perpetua familiarem sibi reddidit Spiritus Sancti
in Scripturis loquentis dictionem, ut non solum in Concionibus publicis, and
libris in lucem editis, Scripturarum testimonia confertim, prout res
postulabat, accumularet, sed etiam in quotidianis Colloquiis, quae ille de
rebus Theologicis libenter habebat, Scripturas ex improviso loqueretur, ut
sermo illius, absque ulla affectatione, ex Sacrae Scripturae verbis ac
phrasibus magnam partem coagmentatus, in venerandam quandam concinnitatem
assurgeret. Consolationem haurie^at ex eis ^berrimam.
His seipsum, his alios saluberrimis aquis reficiebat. Et grates DEO debitas
semper persolvens, O quoties and quam pio in DEUM ardore haec and similia ex
Scripturis deprompta (...) recinebat? DOMINVS exaudiet cum clamavero ad eum,
Psalm. 4.4. DEVS, DEVS meus es, quaero te mane, sitit te anima mea, desiderat te
caro mea. Melior est misericordia tua, quam vita: Labia mea laudabunt te, Psalm.
63. In DEO laudabo Verbum ejus, in DOMINO laudabo Verbum. DEO fido, non timebo

tamen erga DEI Ecclesiam non tenent, cujus patiuntur velut quosdam artus
dividi, and membra lacerari. Etenim cum propter Ecclesiam CHRISTVS passus sit,
and CHRISTI Corpus Ecclesia sit, non videtur ab his exhiberi CHRISTO fides, a
quibus evacuatur ejus Passio, corpusque distrahitur. Haec Ambrosius, Lib. de
Obitu fratris sui Satyri, post medium libri. Sic olim circa Ann. DOMINI 850.
Ecclesia Lugdunensis, Lib. de tenenda veritate Scripturae, post medium; Qui non
tranquille and pacifice moderatur quod sentit, sed statim paratus est ad
contentiones, dissensiones, and scandala, etiamsi non habeat Haereticum sensum,
certissime habet Haereticum ^nimum, Bibl. Patr. tom. 4. part. 2. edit. 4.

Quam saepe gementem PATRICIVM vidimus, and flebiliter deplorantem audivimus
Ecclesiae nostrae Scoticanae intestina dissidia? Patricius pacis and veritatis
am^tor,
Saepenumero dicebat jucundum sibi fore, si ipsius sanguine restingui posset
infoelix istud incendium: tanto ille pacis atque unitatis amore flagrabat.
Memor interim charitatem non gaudere iniquitate, sed congaudere veritati, ut
docet Apostolus, 1. Cor. 13.6. Laudabat illud dictum Gregorii; Vtilius
permittitur nasci scandalum, Creg. homil. 7. super Ezecheelem.
quam veritas relinquatur: and illud Thomae Aquinatis; Propter nullum scandalum
quod sequi videatur, debet homo, praetermissa veritate, falsitatem docere. 2a
2ae quaest, 43* art. 7.
Et quod ab Hilario scriptum est initio libri contra Auxentium; Speciosum
quidem nomen est pacis, and pulcra est opinio vnitatis, sed quis ambigat eam
solam Ecclesiae atque Evangeliorum vnitam pacem esse, quae CHRISTI est?

TERTIVM OFFICIVM quod hoc versu Psalmi commendatur, 3m Offi^ium, Vt ^HR^STO
DOMINO ^pere servi^mus.
est, ut CHRISTO serviamus, ille sit noster DOMINVS, nos illius servi, and per
illum unicum Mediatorem viam ad Patrem affectemus: fiducia sit in illo solo; ut
laeti cantemus, DOMINVS DIXIT DOMINO MEO, etc. Nec fide exanimi ac Diabolica
nobis blandiamur, sed fidei nostrae veritatem, ac vitam comprobemus operatione
per charitatem; and CHRISTVM, in quem fide credimus, sequamur opere; Si quis
mihi serviat, sequatur me, inquit DOMINVS noster, Ioann. 12.26. Quam sedulus
fuerit in hac part officii Christiani sanctae memoriae genitor meus, Patricius
^^delis Chri^ti Servus.
testatur tum pastoralis fidelitas, tum omnis vita ejus, pie just, ac
temperanter acta, and adhuc in hominum memoria loquens, multo rumque consciorum
sermonibus celebrata. DEVS Bone! Quanta illi in omnibus vitae, tum privatae,
tum publicae partibus, prae omnibus aliis quibuscunque solicitudinibus, bonae,
intaminatae, atque inoffensae conscientiae cura fuit? Quam tenellum illi cor?
Quam timoratum pectus, ne DEI Spiritum contristaret, ne cuiquam scandalum
poneret, ne suavissimo Divini vultus lumine, vel ad quantulamcunque brevis
momenti particula^, animam suam privaret? Voluptatematque utilitate^ veram,
sincera^, atque Coelestem in illa DEI pace omnem mentem exsuperante, and cor
ejus atque cogitationes ejus in CHRISTO IESV custodiente, incomparabiliter
ampliorem judicans, quam in omnibus mundi hujus opibus, honoribus, amicitiis,
and quibuscunque oblectamentis.

4 m Officium, Vt caussa nobis contra eosdem ^imicos cum CHRISTO commun^
sitpunc;
QVARTVM OFFICIVM est, ut causa omnis nostra sit CHRISTI causa, ut dicere
possimus, convicia conviciantium tibi, indicerunt in me Psalm. 69. Romans 15. Suos
enim inimicos conculcabit CHRISTVS, ponentur scabellum pedibus ejus: si igitur
tibi cum CHRISTO sit causa communis, etiam victoriae eris particeps. In mundo
(inquit) afflictionem habebites: sed confidite, ego vici mundum, Ioann. 16.
ultimo. Et Petrus Apostolus ait; In eo quod consortes estis afflictionum
CHRISTI, gaudete: vt and cum revelabitur gloria ipsius, gaudentis exultantes,
etc. 1. Pet. 4. Et DOMINVS beatos pronunciat illos qui persecutionem patiuntur
propter justitiam: quoniam ipsorum est Regnum Coelorum, Matthew. 5.10. Propterea
voluptatem capio (inquit Apostolus) in infirmitatibus, in injuriis, in
necessitatibus, in persecutionibus, in angustiis pro CHRISTO* cum enim infirmus
sum* tunc potens sum, 2. Cor. 12.10. De hoc etiam officio nunquam deserendo
^emper cogitans piae recordationis Pater meus, Patricius ut CHRISTI caussam
tueretur nullas ^ominum inimicit^as formidabat.
nullam unquam habuit cum quoquam dissensionis causam, nisi quae CHRISTI fuit:
neque illi discordia cum aliquo intercessit, nisi quia nullis moveri
terriculis, nullis inescari illecebris, nulla portarum infernalium machinatione
fra^gi, neque ulla unquam ratione induci potuit, ut DEI caussam desereret,
officio suo de esset, quod in commune utile esse judicabat praevaricatrice
silentio suffocaret, vel ullo pacto* iniquitati aut mendacio consentiret.
Eximia qua praestabat rerum divinarum and humanarum scientia, admirabili qua
pollebat facundia, and expedita in rebus agendis solertia, tam libere ac
prudenter usus est, Prudens libortas.
quod juxta mecum nostrates omnes intelligunt, ut apud duos sapientissimos
Principes, IACOBVM august^ae memoriae, and qui nunc paterno BRITANNIARVM
imperio foeliciter potitur, Serenissimum Regem nostrum, CAROLVM, in magna
semper gratia fuerit; omnium ordinum benevolentiam meruerit, and ab ipsis
quoque hostibus ac invidis admirationem and reverentiam extorserit. Nec tam
apertas adversus illum gesserint inimicitias (terrente eos manifesta Numinis in
viro praesentia) quam occulta infoelices quidam odia foverint. Pia and
constans* fortitudo.
Quae ille sciens insuper habuit, and solo DEO fretus, justum ac tenacem
propositi virum se constanter exhibuit. Laudatum ab illo memini, quando CHRISTI
causa agitur, and ob eam causam offensio hominum incurritur, dictum illud
Hieronymi, ad Ruffinum, prope finem Apologiae illius, quae incipit, LECTIS
LITERIS; Si ista est causa discordiae, mori possum, tacere non possum.

Si quis afflictae conscientiae Christianus ex me quaerat; Objectio afflictae
conscientiae.
Quid igitur si ipse mihi peccato meo inimicitias procuraverim, and calamitates
accersiverim? Number propterea animum despondebo, quia non patior propter
justitiam, and propter CHRISTVM, sed propter meam injustiam?

Solutio consolatoria.
Respondeo: Non est quod animum despondeas; sed potius foelicem exitum and
certam victoriam per CHRISTVM tibi pollicearis, si serio resipiscas: nam
poenitendo jam in CHRISTI tutelam tranfis, qui venit vocare peccatores ad
poenitentiam, Matthew. 9.13. Qui peccantibus nobis ac recipiscentibus advocatum
se prebet, 1. Ioann. 2.1. Ego (inquit) quoscunque amo, arguo and castigo:
aemulare igitur ac resipisce, Apocal. 3.19. Fili mi, ne neglexeris
castigationem DOMINI, De afflictionibus peccato a^^ersit^^.
neque deficias animo, cum ab eo argueris, etc. Hebr. 12. quocirca dicit;
Invoca Me in die angustie, eruam te, and ^onorificabis Me, Psalm. 50.15. Audies
suavissimam illam DOMINI vocem, Confide, fili: remissa sunt tibi peccata tua,
Matthew. 9.2. Atque his and similibus de Divina erga peccatores afflictos, and
sub afflictione sincere resipiscentes, clementia and benignitate testimoniis
Pater meus in asperrimis suis quas expertus est conflictationibus se
sustentans, ineffabilem consolationem, Patricii humilis pieta^ and sincer^
humilitas.
atque invictam animi constantiam Divinitus sibi dari perpetuo animadvertit.
Quod multoties in privatis inter nos colloquiis, cum ardentissima Divinae
misericordiae celebratione, professus est. Quamvis enim aliis cum eo degentibus
hominibus innocens, inculpatus, and observantissimus aequi fuit, sibi tamen,
praesertim ad DEI Tribunal cum se sisteret, peccatis sordidus, elamabat cum
Publicano; Luc. 18.13
DEVS propitius esto mihi peccatori^ and cum Davide, Novi DOMINE quod aequitas
judicia tua, and in v^ritate afflixistime. Ps. 119. jod.
Sit quaeso misericordia tua ad conso^andum me, secundum eloquium tuum servo
tuo.

QVINTVM OFFICIVM, quod hic versiculus Psalmi, quem explicandum suscepimus, 5 m
Officium, Sursum corda.
a nobis postulat, est, ut sapiamus and quaeramus quae sursum sunt, Vbi
CHRISTVS sedet ad Dextram DEI, non sapiamus terrena, sicut monet Apost. ad
Colossens. 3. ut thesaurus noster and cor nostrum sit in Coelo, Math. 6.21. Ut
voti nostri summa, and laetitiae materia sit Regnum DEI, Victoria DEI, Gloria
DEI. Et Coelitu^ illud Carmen integremus; Apocal. 11.15.
Regna mundi facta sunt DOMINI nostri, and CHRISTI ejus, and regnabit in secula
seculorum. Ut gaudeamus, quod nomina nostra scripta sint in Coelis. Quod DEUS
and Pater Domini nostri JESUS CHRISTI, in CHRISTO et per CHRISTUM sit Pater
noster, et DEUS noster. Luc. 10.20. Joan. 20.17.
Quod CHRISTUS sit noster DOMINUS and SERVATOR, ac nos ejus Servi and Amici.

In hujus officii praestatione mirum quantum excelluit pientissimus PATER meus:
Patricius cor and thesauru^ suum in Coelo semper habeba^.
cujus animus semper coelestibus intentus, caduca omnia, quantamcunque inanis
gloriae vel fallacis securitatis speciem prae se ferrent, qualibuscunque
blandirentur lenociniis, pro nihilo reputabat; and omnia detrime^tum
existimabat, ac pro excrementis duceb^t, prae eminentia cognitionis CHRISTI
IESV DOMINI nostri. (...), Meus amor crucifixut est: scripsit olim in sua ad
Romanos Epistola beatus Martyr Ignatius, Ioannis Apostoli Discipulus,
Antiochiae Syriae Episcopus. Hoc ipsum and Patri me* divinitus concessum est,
Ignatii et Patricii amor CHRISTVS.
ut CHRISTVM noctu diuque in pectore gestaret, cogitaret, adoraret: in illo
fiduciam collocaret: ad illum sitienter anhelaret: in illo solo voluptatem
caperet: illum solum timeret: de illo solo gloriaretur: per illum de omnibus
hostibus palmam reportaret.

Metris Boethii, quae in ejus opere de Consolatione Philosophiae sparsim
inveniuntur, jam inde ab adolesce^tia delectatus, ea postea senex elocuplete
memoriae penu foeliciter depromebat: praesertim illa, quibus opum, voluptatum,
honorum and gloriae mundi hujus vanitas depingitur; and animus ad altiora,
veriora, ac duratura bona appetenda accenditur. Inprimis autem metrum illud quo
scriptor ille DEUM compellat, and in eo versus hosee, honesta cum animi sui
voluptate, Boeth. Lib. 3. de consol. Philosoph. metro 9.
and jucunda adstantium utilitate, frequenter usurpabat, Da Pater augustam
menti conscendere sedem,
Da Fontem lustrare boni, Da luce reperta
In te conspicuos animi defigere visus.
Et hos, Tu requies tranquilla piis: te cernere sinis,
Principium, Vector, Dux, semita, terminus idem.
Timor DEI, dilectio DEI, fiducia in DEO, imitatio CHRISTI, Patricii
conversatio Sanct^, C^lestis, Angelica.
in verbis ejus, in oculis, and in omnibus vitae partibus emicabat, and
constanter ac splendide refulgebat. Conversatio illius fuit Sancta, Coelestis,
Angelica. Sanctus moribus, Coelestis affectibus, Angelicus fuit indefessa
celebratione DEI, and Pastoralibus excubiis circa haeredes salutis.

Ut domi semper Sacrarum Scripturarum lectioni and meditationi affixus, nullis
unquam intercurrentibus negotiis animum suum passus est vel tantillum a Divinae
Gratiae contemplatione, Meditatio assidu^ Sacraru^ Scripturarum.
and incumbentis sibi muneris recotdatione dimoveri: ita etiam peregre agens,
sive certo loco interquiesceret, sive iter faceret, aliquam Sacrarum Literarum
(...) mente revolvebat: eamque apud se penitius intuens, ejusque sensum
secretiori quadam indagine investigans, and cum aliis Scripturae locis
collationem ejus instituens, assiduis interim ejuculationibus Coelum pulsans,
in promptu semper habebat, tum quo ipse animum suum in meditationibus aeternum
profuturis perpetuo detineret, and adversus inferorum portas munitus atque
invictus consisteret, tum quod ad DEI gloriam and audientium aedificationem,
pro concione, veluti ex tempore, in quacunque Ecclesia diceret. Eo factum vt
ubicunque eum dies DOMINICVS, Sedulitas in praedicando.
vel alius sacris publicis destinatus, depraehenderet, Coetus illius loci
Concione Sacra nunquam destitueretur. Nam absente, vel aegritudine aliqua
laborante, vel ob impedimenta quaelibet imparato, vel etiam auxilium ejus
implorante loci Pastore, vel sicubi Pastor nullus esset, incunctanter ad
concionandum ille, DEO fretus, se accingere, and tanquam scriba doctus in Regno
Coelorum, de thesauro cordis sui efferre nova and ve^era: quibus imperitos
erudiebat, satiscentes reficiebat, errantes in viam reducebat, pertinacibus
terrorem incutiebat, and sacrorum testimoniorum pondere os obstruebat. Quando
solabatur, aut ad officium hortabatur, melle dulcior ejus fluebat Oration, ut
(casto and sublimiori sensu quam de Xenophonte olim Rhetore dictum est) in
labris ejus Pitho sedisse, Facundia Pastoralis.
sermonem ejus Charites finxisse videantur. Nec facta dictis fidem derogabant,
nam hortamenta sua praeclaro vitae exemplo condecoravit, (...), jucundus
verbis; jucundior moribus: Nazianz. Orat* de laudibus Athanasit.
ut loquitur Gregorius Nazianzenus de magno Athanasio. Quando docebat, vel
abdita pandebat mysteria, tunc veluti introductis Solis radiis, lumen rebus
quae inaccessae putabantur, clarissimum inferebat, and veluti e puteo erutam
veritatem in apricum producebat, and propius intuendam omnium oculis
subjiciebat. Quando adversus hominum peccata ultionem divinam denunciabat, tum
vero ex ore ejus vibrabant fulmina illa, quae (...) DEI ipsius brachio contorta
ferebantur. Quod olim de beato Cypriano scripsit Lactantius Lib. 5. Divinarum
institutionum, Cap. 1. Id ipsum in PATRICIO auditores miraba^tur; Ingenio
fuisse facili, copioso, suavi, and (quae sermonis maxima est virtus) aperto, ut
discernere nequires, vtrumne ornatior in eloquendo, an facilior in explicando,
an potentior in persuadendo esset. Nec senex sibi pepercit, sed florens in
atriis DOMINI, Psalm* 92.
adhuc in senectute fructum ferebat. Memor illius obtestationis Apostolicae, ut
Episcopus praedicet verbum, instet tempestive, intempestive, arguat, objurget,
exhortetur cum omni lenitate and doctrina. 2. Tim. 4.
Et Apostolicis insistens vestigiis, sese erigebat ac solabatur jugi
meditatione and crebra repetitione verborum illorum quibus olim Apostolus
Paulus seipsum and alios ad piam fortitudinem and Christianam constantiam
animabat; Remigium animae in Coelum sese at^ollentis. ^. Cor. 4.16.17, 18.
Propterea non segnescimus; sed etiamsi externus homo noster corrumpitur,
internus tamen renovatur de die in diem. Nam ilico praeteriens levitas
afflictionis nostrae, excellenter excellentis gloriae pondus aeternum conficit
nobis: non spectantibus nobis ea quae videntur, sed ea quae non videntur: nam
quae videntur sunt temporaria, at quae non videntur sunt aeterna.

Propterea and ipsa correptus paralysi illa, quae mortem ei propinquam
portendebat, Perpes fidelitas, and invict^ constantia, etiam tempore morbi.
nihil remisit de pristino pietatis studio, sed quo magis appropinquare
sentiebat reddendae rationis diem, eo diligentius nervos omnes animae, and quos
poterat corporis, intendebat, ut DOMINVS qui gregis suae curam and domus suae
praefecturam ei demandaverat, eum inveniret (...), facientem sic. Conventus
aliquot Synodicos tempore illius morbi, cu^ symmystis egit, Math. 24.46
sella portatili, qua ad audiendas Conciones Sacras vectabatur, delatus in
Templum, conventibus illis pro officii sui ratione praefuit, and quod magis
omnes gratulabundi mirabamur, conciones item in eis habuit more consueto, cum
solita facundia, and pristinis orationis nervis, ac evidenti Numinis eum
potenter roborantis praesentia. Haec mecum sciunt, haec palam loquuntur, haec
dum vivent testabuntur, praeter alios auditores plurimos, centum Presbyteri
diocoeseos ABERDONIENSIS, cum quibus Synodos illas celebravit.

Postea ingravescente morbo, cum in cubiculo, Mitis patientia, and grata pieta^
perpetim detineretur, norunt adhuc superstites, tum Clerici, tum Laici, qui ad
eum invisendum certatim con^luebant, quanta ille animi mansuetudine, quanto
etiam interni hominis vigore, quam patienter, quam confidenter, qua humilitate,
qua pietate, illam divinitus sibi impositam afflictionem sustinuerit: quam
alacriter, quam libenter, quam constanter poculum illud biberit, quod a Patre
suo Coelesti sibi porrigi animadvertebat: quanta gratitudine immensam DEI,
illum tam benign visitantis, and eum quasi per parts mori jubentis,
clementiam depraedicaverit: quam in eo etiam ubertim experi^batur, Mansit e^
lingua and sensuum usu^.
quod artubus dextri lateris per paralysin labefactatis, praeter hujus morbi
indolem and consuetudinem, DEVS illi linguae and sensuum illibatum usum benign
conservaret.

Cum autem acerbis subinde doloribus urgeretur, adeo placide Divinae se
voluntati submisit, Qualis in^^sentibus.
ut nulla unquam impatientiae vox ex ejus ore audita sit. Interea quam suavis
and affabilis salutantibus, quam praesenti animo and hilari vultu omnes
exceperit, quam pastoraliter instruxerit, quam pattern consolatus sit; res ipsa
adeo in aprico est, and tam sonora voce clamitat, ut nostro non indigeat
testimonio. Omnium ordinum supersunt testes locupletissimi, qui haec viderunt
and audiverunt, and cum gaudio, and admiratione ad DEI laudem, aliis etiamnum
recitant.

Votum.
Saepe dicebat, sibi in voto quidam ardentissimo esse hinc protinus liberari and
esse cum CHRISTO, sed nec audere se nec velle DEO limits ponere, Pia
patientia. Fides.
aut tempora figere, aut Paternae ipsius providentiae per impatientiam obniti,
vel ingrato fastu obmurmurare: scire se cui crediderit, adhuc enim tantillum,
tantillum inquam, and venturum qui venie^, neque tardaturum. 2 Timothy 1.12 Hebr.
10.37


Accelerari dimissionis sui diem laetus persentiscens, Accepit (...).
and salutare Sacro-Sanctae Eucharistiae viaticum impense cupiens, illud sibi
da^i postulavit, quo una cum sex Presbyteris (quorum ego pars fui) summa cum
devotione, reverentia, and consolatione sumpto, interrogatus a me an non
vivificam Panis Vitae dulcedinem ubertim perciperet: Respondit, se jam DEO
canere illud senis SIMEONIS canticum; L^t^^ erupit in verba Semeonis, Luc.
2.29.30.
Nunc dimittis Servum tuum, DOMINE, secundum verbum tuum, in pace; quia
viderunt oculi mei Salutare tuum.

Tunc Symmystis illis, and suis liberis ac domesticis and amicis qui aderant,
Benedictionem impertivit symmystis and liberis, etc.
benedici ab illo enixe flagitantibus, manum quam habebat a paralysi immunem
singulorum capitibus imposuit, and per ardentissimam ad DEUM precatiunculam
Pastorali ac paterna eos benedictione sigillatim adgeniculantes impertivit. Ea
res nobis omnibus ingenti solatio fuit: and recurrente identidem suavissima
ejus recordatione oppido re^reamur.

Inter affiduas nostras collucutiones, quibus, Colloquia inter Patricium and

de rebus Divinis, de hominum miseria per peccatum, de DEI misericordia, and
foelicitate redemptorum per CHRISTUM, de seculi hujus vanitate, de vitae hujus
brevitate, de dulcissima illa invitatione and promissione Servatoris nostri;
Matthew. 11.^8.
Venite ad Me omnes qui laboratis and onerati estis, and Ego reficiam vos: de
justitia and pace and gaudio in Spiritu Sancto, de morte corporis, de
immortalitate animae, de carnis resurrectione, de haereditate nobis in Coelis
reposita, de visione beatifica, summa cum animorum voluptate disserebamus;
accidit ut paucis ante obitum diebus, acri infestatum dolor, and corporis
viribus nimium quanto defectum hortarer ad constantem in DEO fiduciam, quam
nullae piis afflictiones excutiunt, cum hominem in CHRISTI sanguine
justificatum, adeoque jam DEO Iudice justum, nulla calamitatum congeries
separare possit a charitate DEI quae est in CHRISTO JESUS DOMINO nostro. Ille
inconcussam suam fidem fortissima responsione testatam fecit: Patricii co^stans
in De^ fiduci^*
finem PSALMI quinti commemorans, ejusque verba illa ultima Hebraice repetens,
(...) id est, benevolentia veluti scuto coronabis (vel circundadabis) cum.
Atque ita DEI favore circundatum, munitum, and coronatum mox placida corporis
etiam quies complexa est. Vespertino istud tempore contigit quo somnum capere
cupiebat.

Cum ei referrem de consanguineo quodam nostro nuper defuncto, Dilectis Dei
servis datur ut non inviti, sed libentes moriantur.
quam dissimiliter animo affectus fuisset in isto morbo qui ei mortem intra
paucos dies attulit, ac in alio quodam morbo quem ante paucos annos minari sibi
interitum existimabat: nam in priore illo usque adeo consternatus timore mortis
aestuabat ac trepidabat, ut non sine lachrymis ac suspiriis de propinquo (ut
putabat) obitu suo loqueretur: Cum autem, DEI Beneficio, ex illo morbo
revaluisset, die mortis triennium circiter prolongato, and aegritudine
postmodu^ hac mortifera correptus decumberet, visenti mihi professus est ultro
sine ullo fletu aut gemitu, perjucundum sibi fore si quamprimum DEUS illum ex
hac vita ad se-ipsum transferret: Cujus voti intra paucos dies compos
foeliciter factus est. His auditis, subjecit PATER meus, tam clementer a DEO
haberi dilectos suos, vt invitos abripi non sinat, sed antequam hinc excedant,
dei animum obsequentem, vt volentes tabernacuculum hoc deponant, and ad meliora
transeant.

Vult autem mori Christianus, non quo nolit vivere, Quo sensu dicatur
Christianus velle more.
sed vt post mortem melius possit vivere: ut loquitur Augustinus, Libro 14. de
Civitate DEI. Cap. 25. Illud autem PATER meus non eo asserebat, ac si pari
omnes alacritate ad hanc terribilem cum morte conflictationem in arenam
descenderenti singulis enim concessa est haec pia fortitudo, Dispar fortitudo.
and Christiana fiducia, Secundum mensuram donationis CHRISTI, Ephesians. 4.7. Romans
12.3.
id est, prout CHRISTO libuerit eam admetiri: seu ut alibi Apostolus, prout
cuique DEUS partitus est mensuram fidei: dispariliter quidem, ita tamen vt quam
vis irrepraehensibili quadam conservandae inter corpus and animam copulae
appetentia, Sed in omnibus victtix.
amarum istud divortium homo naturaliter exhorrescat, nihilominus vnicuique
nostrum in DOMINO morienti detur sufficiens illa and insuperabilis gratia
CHRISTI, 2. Cor. 12.9.
qua virtus eius in nostra infirmitate perficitur; id est, per quam certam
consequimur victoriam. Qua gratia DOMINUS nos vt prius ad credendum, ita tandem
aliquando etiam ad moriendum, ex nolentibus facit volentes.

Ipsum vero dulcissimum PATREM meum, cum illa diceret, Qualiter affectu^
Patricius ad vivendum, aut moriendum, and migrandum.
and jam ante etiam a multis annis (quod inter alia testatur adhuc carmen ejus
Climactericum EVBVLO adjunctum) ita cerneres comparatum, vt neque vitae hujus
temporalis fastidio vel cupiditate duceretur, neque mortis imminentis formidine
angeretur, fed DOMINUM adeundi and supernis potiundi deliciis concepta coelitus
ineffabili spiritus flagrantia jugiter raperetur. Idcirco, cu^ omnes optarent
illi atque adprecarentur a DOMINO vivendi commeatum; id ille ubi rescivit,
respondebat, verbis illis vtens Ambrosii, quae in ejus vita ad Augustinum
conscripta a Paulino commemorantur; Non ita inter vos vixi, vt pudeat me
vivere: nec timeo mori, quia DOMINVM bonum habemus. Addebat autem, se vehementi
teneri desiderio cedendi de hoc seculo, and ad CHRISTVM proficiscendi.

Laudantibus vitam ejus anteactam, Patricii sincera pictas, and pia humilitas,
metuens sibi (...) laudantibus, e^ soli DEO gloriam tribuens.
dicere solebat; Sola DEI misericordia semper suffultum soli DEO se acceptam
refer quamcunque de tentationibus victoriam reportaverit: se in solo DEO
gloriari, qui hoc ei benign indulserit, attestante etiam sua conscientia, quod
cum simplicitate and sinceritate DEI, non cum sapientia carnali, sed cum
gratiae DEI conversatus fuisset in mundo. ^. Cor. 1.1^.
Attamen (inquiebat) non per hoc justificatus sum. 1. Cor. 4.4.
Det mihi DOMINVS vt inveniam misericordiam apud DOMINVM, 2. Tim. 1.8.
in illo die. Quod opto and spero. Sic olim beatus Martyr IGNATIUS, Epist. ad
TRALLENSES; In DOMINO gloriari bonum est* Quamquam enim roboratus sim in iis
quae DEI sunt [(...)] tamen plus mihi timendum est, Humilis pietas Ignatii
Episcopi Antiocha^i*
nes animus illis intendendus qui frustra me inflant (...), qui enim laudant,
flagellant me (...).

Patricii mortem pr^cipientis foelix persuasio.
Paulo ante vltimum vitae diem, me alloquens PATER meus, dixit, Perspicio,
IOANNES, brevi affore cursus mei terminum, and vitae hujus exitum, quem certo
persuasus sum foelicem futurum and consolationis plenum.

Immensa consolatio ex verbis Servatoris nostri postremis in cruce. Luc. 23.46.
Pridie quam moreretur (qui erat DOMINI nostri JESUS CHRISTI Passionis dies)
cogitantibus nobis de vivifica Servatoris nostri Passione in Cruce, suggerebam
illi Orationem illam CHRISTI ad PATREM, dicentis; Pater, in manus tuas commendo
spiritum meum: qua Oratione aiebam commendari PATRI a CHRISTO non solum
propriam ac DEITATI hypostatice vnitam suam animam, sed etiam omnem cujuscunque
Christiani fidelis animam e corpore migrantem: atque adeo illius Orationis
perpete virtute jam animam ipsius commendari DEO per CHRISTVM, qui est ad
Dexteram DEI, and intercedit pro nobis. Ille haec audiens, languentes vt
poterat attollens oculos; Haud dubie (inquit) haec vera est interpretatio, and
ipsissimus verborum DOMINI sensus, (...) 11.4^.
qui and orat pro nobis, and a PATRE semper exauditur.

Ad ista recte intelligenda conducit dictum illud Augustini, de CHRISTO PATREM
orante: and exaudito a PATRE, CHRIST^ orat ut (...) ut DEV^

Vespere ante obitum; Nunc, inquiebam, mi PATER, Matthew. 21.2^
accidunt ad aures animae tuae dulcissima illa Servatoris verba; Euge, serve

EIVSDEM IOANNIS FORBESII DISSERTATIO. DE VISIONE BEATIFICA. LECTORI S.
AGEBATVR solennis ACADEMIAE PANEGYRIS, in qua mihi ex officio de Themate
aliquo Theologico public^ dicendum erat, and eam celebritatem Pater meus (...),
non obstante illa qua premebatur paralysi, Charissimam Filiam suam
Vniversitatem Aberdoniensem (quam marcore longo extabescentem and situ informi
squalentem sanitati ac nitori pristino, instaurator foelix, restituerat)
extremum invisens, manibus gestantium in auditorium portatus, veneranda sua
praesentia condecoravit. Materiam igitur eam mihi deligendam existimavi quae
and illi Parentis mei conditioni maxim esset accommodata, and Theologo
imprimis digna, and auditorio vtilitatem juxta ac voluptatem long vberrimam
allatura videbatur. Praecipue vero vt hoc argumentum illo praesertim tempore
tractandum assumerem, vehemens animi impulit ardor, quo solandi atque
exhilarandi pientissimum illud ac mitissimum pectus Charissimi genitoris mei,
senio simul and morbo gravati, and accersitionem sui de hoc seculo in horas
praestolantis, flagrantissime rapiebar. Neque voto successus defuit, nam ille
attentas, vt solebat, aures praebens, ad primum Visionis Beatificae auditum,
vsque adeo per DEI gratiam exultavit spiritu, vt veluti novis collectis viribus
sese ad audiendum mira alacritate componeret. Et quam impense Beatificae
Visionis meditatione delectaretur, frequentibus postea inter nos colloquiis, ad
extremum vsque spiritum luculenter ostendit.

Vt autem Dissertationem hanc nunc publici juris facerem, his adductus sum
rationibus.

1. Hoc olim solamine Patriarcha David maerorem suum de filioli morte conceptum
leniebat, quod ad defunctum iturus esset. Et Ambrosius obitu fratris sui Satyri
contristatus se hac spe solabatur, quod cito ad fratrem suum venturus esset,
nec digressus inter illos longa essent futurae divortia, and ipse cum fratre
inter Angelorum consortia, propediem futurus. Hac ipsa Patrem meum apum
CHRISTVM videndi spe me recreo atque sustento. Quae certe ad amicos nostros
hinc translatos pr^fectio solatio esse non posset, nisi illos miseriis
exemptos, Coelestibus jam potiri gaudiis crederemus. Quae gaudia quo clarius
praevisa, and certius animo praecepta, and frequentius atque accuratius menti
repraesentata fuerint, eo mirabiliores sui amores in nobis excitabunt.

2. Ea etiam est praesentis seculi, vtcunque aerumnosi, illecebrosa fallacia,
and perniciosa blanditia, vt altioris remigio contemplationis opus sit, quo
mentes nostras coenosis degravatas affectibus humo revellere, and ad verae
beatitudinis domicilium altollere valeamus. Torporem igitur hunc and
exitiabilem inertiam quo facilius excutiamus, and ea quae DEI sunt, non autem
quae mundi hujus sunt, libenter and continenter sapiamus, haud exiguo per DEI
gratiam adjumento (vt hactenus mihi fuit) ita post hac tibi et mihi futuram
confido istam quam exhibemus Beatificae Visionis meditationem* Dicebat, memini,

securitas indiligentiam pariat, and vetus denuo hostis obrepat, qui semper
novas nobis non desinit nectere tendiculas, quamdiu adhuc in agone versantes,
ad aeternae tranquillitatis arcem nondum pervenimus. Omnibus igitur cujuscunque
aetatis viatoribus inde a pueritia ad extremum vsque senectutis terminum
necessarium est vt Apostolum imitati, Philip. ^.
cogitent se nondum metam appraehendisse, aut jam consummatos esse, sed
persequantur an ipsi quoque appraehendant, cujus etiam rei causa appraehensi
sunt a CHRISTO IESV. Vt ea quae a tergo sunt obliviscentes, ad ea vero quae a
front sunt contendentes, scopum versus ferantur, ad palmam ((...)) supernae
vocationis DEI in CHRISTO IESV. Quocirca junioribus pariter ac senioribus, and

Idcirco omnia in vnam congesta lancem (sequestrato DEI cultu qui altioris est

Collatio praesentis seculi and futuri.


hoc seculum ait esse stadium, futurum vero seculum vocat (...): and huic
quidem (...), (...), labores, and sudores, esse a DEO attributos; illi vero
(...), coronas, and praemia, and retributiones. Hoc breve esse, illud senectae
expers and immortale. Sic Clemens Romanus, vel quicunque Author fuit secundae
illius Epistolae quae Clementi Pauli Apostoli Discipulo tribuitur, Clem Romans
(...), Peregrinatio carnis hujus in hoc mundo parva est and exigui temporis:
promissio autem CHRISTI magna est and admirabilis, and requies futuri Regni,
and vitae aeternae. In eandem sententiam sanctus ille Antonius Aegyptius, in
sua ad Monachos ascetas paraenesi, dixit; Apud Ath^^nasium, in^vita S. An^tonii.
(...). Omnino enim vita humana, cum futuris seculis comparata, est omnium
brevissima, vt ad aeternitatem nihil sit omne nostrum tempus.

Ab hoc autem vitae hujus mome^to pendet aeternitas. A momen^ pende^ (...).
Et omnium Christianorum spes in futurum tempus extenditur, vt quod hic
servivimus DEO, alibi nos servisse laetemur. Et vitae hujus summa brevis spes
nos monet (dum tempus babemus) inchoare aeternas. Nam quae visibilia sunt
temporaria sunt, 2. Cor. 4. u^^timo.
at quae sunt invisibilia aeterna.

In hoc brevi stadio res quasdam pro tempore vtendas accepimus a supremo
Agonotheta DEO, Vti and fru^vide Aug Lib. 1. de doct. Christiaena, cap 4.5.2^.
Aug. Lib. Confess ca^ 1.
cujus solius aeterna fruitio nobis plena requies est, and vnica ac sempiterna
beatitas. Pulchre Augustinus, Quia (inquit) fecisti nos ad te, and inquietum
est cor nostrum donec requi^scat in te.

Utrum autem beatitudo nobis in Coelis reposita in actu intellectus an
voluntatis principalius consistat, In 4. Sent. Did. 49.
anxie inter Scholasticos Theologos disceptatum est. Nos missa nunc ea tanquam
hand quaquam necessaria controversia, de illa DEI visione, DEO ipso donante,
dicere instituimus, Visio Be^^tifica separabilis non est ab actu voluntatis.
quae ita beatifica est, vt cuicunque Deus eam in ^ulserit, is haud dubie etiam
flagrantissima summi illius and communis boni dilectione constanter ardeat. Nam
Deus est (...), intelligibilium supremum, and (...), omnium expetibilium
extremum seu vltimus terminus, in quo desiderium omne consistit ac defigitur,
^azianz. ^at. de ^idibus A^anasii, sub ^itium.
and plene conquiescit, vt monet Gregorius Nazianzenus.

Charissimi (inquit Ioannes Apost.) nunc Filii DEI sumus, sed non apparuit quod
erimus: scimus, quod cum ipse patefactus fuerit, similes ei erimus: quoniam
videbimus eum sicuti est. Ioann. 3.

^romissio (...) Be^ificae. ^atth. 5. (...) 14. (...) in via. ^bjectio. ^EVS non
(...) ^ Tim. 6. ^^ann. 1.
Quin etiam viatoribus multis Patriarchis and Prophetis conspectus esse
dicitur, vt Abrahamo, Iacobo, Moysi, Esaiae, Danieli, etc. cum tamen alibi
Scriptura Sacra DEUM praedicet invisibilem, lucis inaccessae habitatorem, quem
vidit nemo hominum neque videre potest: and Ioannes dicat, DEVM nemo vidit
vnquam.

De visionibus illis antiquis facilis est solutio, admota hac distinctione,
Resp. De ^^sionibus in (...).
DEUS juxta naturae suae proprietatem nulli corporali oculo visibilis est,
quando autem Patribus visus est, sicut Moysi, cum quo facie ad faciem

alicujus conspicabilis materiae dispotione assumpta, salva sua invisibilitate,
videri potuit. Sic respondent Gregorius Nazianzenus, and Hieronymus apud
Augustinum, Epist. 111. Et ipse ibidem ac sequente Epistola Augustinus, and
Ambrosius in Cap. 1. Evangelii Lucae, exponens eum locum vbi Angelus in Templo
apparuit Zachariae Sacerdoti; and Chrysostomus Hom. 15. in Evangelium Ioannis:
and omnis sanorum Theologorum Scholast. consentit adversus Haereticos (...).
Chrysostomus (loco citato) de veteribus visitionibus loquens quibus DEUM

condescensio erant, non ipsius nudae essentiae visio, nam si ipsam vidissent,
nulla ex part differentem vidissent, quippe quae simplex est, (...). Attribut.
quadam divina.
Augustinus Epist. 112. laudat illam Hieronymi sententiam; Res incorporalis
corporalibus oculis non videtur. Et illud Ambrosii; DEVM ea specie videri quam
voluntas elegerit; non natura formaverit. Et illa ejusdem Patris verba
identidem inculcat; Nec DEVS in loco videtur, sed mundo cord, nec corporalibus
oculis DEVS cernitur, nec circumscribitur visu, nec tactu tenetur, nec auditur
affatu, nec sentitur incessu.

Hic vero gravis and expeditu difficilis se ingerit quaestio, Qu^stio. Quo
sensio DEVS dicatur secundum natturae suae proprietatem visibilis aut
invisibilis me^ti creatae. Responsio. Hieronym.
An and quatenus and quomodo DEUS secundum naturae suae proprietatem se
conspiciendum praebeat oculis mentis creatae, and quo sensu etiam intellectui
humano vel Angelico invisibilis sit.

Hieronymi verba sunt (apud Augustinum Epist. 111.) Videre DEVM sicuti est in
natura sua, oculus hominis non potest. Non solum homo, nec Angeli, nec Throni,
nec Potestates, nec Dominationes, nec omne nomen quod nominatur: Neque enim
creatura potest aspicere Creatorem suum. Et alibi (in Cap. 1. Esaiae) Homo
igitur DEI faciem videre non potest. Matthew. 18.
Angeli autem etiam minimorum in Ecclesia semper vident faciem DEI. 1. Cor. 13.
Et nunc in speculo videmus and in aenigmate, tum autem facie ad faciem: quando
de hominibus in Angelos profecerimus, and potuerimus cum Apostolo dicere; Nos
autem omnes revelata facie gloriam DEI speculantes in eandem imaginem
transformamur a gloria in gloriam, 2. Cor. 3.
quasi a DOMINI Spiritu. Licet faciem DEI, juxta naturae su^e proprietatem,
nulla videat creatura: and tunc mente cernatur, quando invisibilis creditur.
Quae Hieronymi verba perpe^dens Augustinus Epist. 111. ad Fortunatianum; August.
In his (inquit) verbis hominis DEI multa consideranda sunt. PRIMVM, 1.
Quia secundum apertissimam DOMINI sententiam, etiam ipse sentit tunc nos
visuros faciem DEI, cum in Angelos profecerimus, id est, aequales Angelis facti
fuerimus, quod erit vtique in resurrectione mortuorum. DEINDE. Apostolico
testimonio satis apparuit, 2.
non exterioris, sed interioris hominis faciem intelligendam, cum videbimus
facie ad faciem. Dicit velamen super cor Iudaeorum positum esse, vt ostendat
cordis faciem nobis esse revelatam, velamine ablato. Quod autem dixit
Hieronymus faciem DEI juxta naturae Divinae proprietatem a nulla videri
creatura, Augustinianae expositio verborum Hieronymi.
id Augustinus refert ad corporales aspectus etiam Angelicos. Verum quia satis
durum est spiritibus illis Coelestibus oculos tribuere corporales, juvabit
audire hac de re disserentes Ambrosium, (in Cap. 1. Lucae) and Chrysostomum,
(homil. 15. in Evang. Ioannis) and ipsum alibi Augustinum (Epist. 112.)

Ambrosius dictum illud Ioannis Evangelistae, DEVM nemo vidit vnquam: Ambros.
ad ipsas etiam Coelestes virtutes and Potestates extendit, quod DEUM nunquam
viderint: idque in hunc modum explicat; Et ideo DEVM nemo vidit vnquam, quia
eam quae in DEO habitat plenitudinem Deitatis, nemo conspexit, nemo mente aut
oculis compraehendit. VIDIT ergo ad vtrumque referendum est. Denique cum
additur, Unigenitus Filius ipse enarravit, mentium magis quam oculorum visio
declaratur. Species enim videtur, virtus vero enarratur, illa oculis, haec
mente compraehenditur. Quae Ambrosii verba considerans Augustinus (Epist. 112.
Cap. 9.) Aliud est (inquit) videre, aliud est totum videndo compraehendere.
Quandoquidem id videtur quod praesens vtcunque sentitur. Totum autem
compraehenditur videndo quod ita videtur, vt nihil ejus lateat videntem, aut
eujus fines circumspici possunt. Posterior ista compraehensio DEI nulli est
possibilis creaturae, vt cap. 8. ejusdem Epist. docebat August. Distinctio.
Videtur DEI essentia sicuti est, sed plenitudo ejus non compraehenditur a mente
creata. Licet ipsa visio beatifica dicatur, and sit c^mpraehensio, secundum
medum creatura, quae hac visione impletur.
Visionem tamen DEI sicuti est, (quae etiam Apostolo compraehensio latiore
sensu dicitur, PHILIP. 1.) nobis promittit Sacra Scriptura, quando in Angelos
profecerimus. Proinde (inquit ibi Augustinus) narrante vnigenito qui est in
sinu Patris, narratione ineffabili, creatura rationalis munda and sancta
impletur visione DEI ineffabili, quam tum consequemur, cum aequales Angelis
facti fuerimus. Et cap. 15. Vnigenitus Filius qui est in sinu Patris,
Divinitatis naturam atque substantiam INSONABILITER NARRAT, and ideo dignis
idoneisque tanto conspectu oculis etiam INVISIBILITER MONSTRAT. Haec Augustinus.

Loquatur nunc os aureum, (...) id quod est DEUS, Chrysostom. homil. 15. in
Evang. Ioann.
non modo Prophetae non viderunt, sed neque Angeli, neque Archangeli. Et
subjungit eandem rationem qua vsus est Hieronymus, (...); ( omnis enim natura
creata quanam ratione videre poterit increatum? Matthew. 1^.
) Deinde proposito Servatoris dicto de Angelis semper videntibus faciem DEI,
and altero illo, Beati mundi cord, Matthew. 5.
quoniam ipsi DEVM videbunt. Posterius sic exponit, (...); id est, (...).
visionem dicit intellectualem nobis possibilem, and intellectio nem de DEO. Et
ad prius rediens, ait, (...). Subjicit deinde; Propterea CHRISTVS, nemo,
inquit, cognovit Patrem nisi Filius. Matthew. 11.
Quid inquam? Number omnes in ignorantia sumus? Absit. Sed nemo ita cognovit
Patrem vt Filius. ((...) (...)) sicut igitur videru^t eum multi (...). (Visione
ipsis congruente, seu pro suo captu.) (...). Haec Chrysostom. Summa est, DEUM non
nisi (...) vident creaturae rationales mundae, Summa responsionis ex
Chrysostomo, per distinctionem similem superiori.
attamen (...), non accurata illa Divinae essentiae contemplatione and
compraehensione, qua Pater Filium, and Filius novit Patrem, sed tantummodo pro
captu seu modulo creaturae, (...).

Augustinus hac de re antiquiorum Patrum, praesertim Athanasii, Grogorii
Nazianzeni, Ambrosii, and Hieronymi doctrinam, cui and ipse consentit,
proponens, Aug. Epist. 111.
ait, Epist. 111. Magni quidam viri and in Scripturis Sanctis doctissimi, qui
plurimum Ecclesiam and bona s^udia fidelium suis literis adjuverunt, vbi eis
occasio data est, dixerunt invisibilem DEUM INVISIBILITER VIDERI. DEVS videtur
invisibiliter.
Hoc est per eam naturam quae in nobis quoque invisibilis est, munda scilicet
mente vel cord. Idem Epist. 112. seu libro de videndo DEO, Aug. Epist. 112.
seu lib. de videndo DEO*
ad Paulinam, prolixe contendit nos in statu gloriae, Mentis purae oculis
intellectualibus nude and aperte visuros DEVM in sua natura, in forma DEI
sicuti est.

Et Augustinum sequuta fere vniversa Theologoru^ Schola concorditer docet
beatos videre immediate ipsam DEI essentiam, Visio facialis immediata.
seu videre DEVM in sua essentia, Communis sententiae Theologorum.
and non per medium eam representans vel adumbrans, sed per ipsam DEI
essentiam, quae immediate absque vllae similitudine conjungitur intellectui
beato, hac eum conjunctione seu visione (vt vocant) faciali beatificans. Ita
docent Thomas, and Scotus, and Durandus, and alii, 4. Seut. Did. 49.
in quartum sententiarum, did. 49. and rursum Thomas in summa part. 1. quaest.
12. Et authoritati Sacrae Scripturae, beatificam visionem DEI sicuti est, facie
ad faciem, Sanctis apertissime promittentis, adjiciunt hanc rationem: 1. Ratio
pro immediat^ visione DEI
Desiderium veraciter piorum (inquit August. Epist. 112. Cap. 8.) quo videre
DEVM cupiunt, and inhianter ardescunt, non in eam speciem contuenda^ flagrat,
qua vt vult apparet quod ipse non est, sed in eam substantiam qua ipse est quod
est. Exodus 33.
Hujus enim desiderii sui flammam sanctus Moses fidelis famulus ejus ostendit,
vbi ait DEO, cum quo ut amicus facie ad faciem loquebatur, Si inveni gratiam
apud te, ostende mihi temet ipsum. Quid ergo? Ille non erat ipse? Si non esset
ipse, non diceret, Ostende mihi temet ipsum, sed ostende mihi DEVM: and tamen
si ejus naturam substantiamque conspiceret, multominus diceret, Ostende mihi
temet ipsum. Ipse ergo erat in ea specie qua apparere voluerat, non autem ipse
apparebat in natura propria quam Moses videre cupiebat. Ea quippe promittitur
Sanctis in alia vita. Vnde quod responsum est Moysi, verum est, Quia nemo
potest faciem DEI videre, and vivere; id est, nemo potest eum in hac vita
vivens videre sicuti est. Et postea eodem libro, cap. 11. In illo (inquit)
Regno vbi eum videbunt Filii ejus sicuti est. Tum quippe satiabitur in bonis
desiderium eorum, quo desiderio flagrabat Moses, cui loqui ad DEVM facie ad
faciem non sufficiebat, and dicebat, Ostende mihi temet ipsum manifest, vt
videam te, tanquam diceret quod in Psalmo ex eodem desiderio canitur, Satiabor
cum manifestabitur gloria tua. Psalm. 17. Beatitudo.
Beatitudo (inquit Bonaventura in 4m Sent. Did. 49. Art. 1. Quaest. 1. in
resolutione) est sinis satians nostrum appetitum: Beatus
Beatus non est, (ait August. lib. 13. de Trinitate, cap. 5.) nisi qui and
habet omnia quae vult, and nihil vult male. Haec ille. Desiderium igitur
videndi DEI essentiam sicuti est, piis mentibus a DEO inditum, non erit inane,
sed satiabitur.

Alia ratio est, quam adferunt Thomas and Scotus. Thomae verba sunt (in 4.
Sent. Did. 49. Quaest. 2. Art. 1. 2. Ratio pro immediata Visione Dei.
) Si in perfectissima operatione intellectus, homo non perveniat ad videndam
essentiam Divinam, Thom.
^d aliquid aliud: opportebit dicere quod aliquid aliud est beatificans ipsum
hominem quam DEVS. Et cum vltima perfectio cujuslibet sit in conjunctione ad
suum principium, sequitur, vt aliquid aliud sit principium effectivum hominis,
quam DEVS, quod est absurdum.

Scotus (in 4. Sent. Did. 49. Quaest. 2.) similiter Philosophatur; Scot.
naturam scilicet intellectualem (cum sit suprema perfectibilis natura) non
habere vltimam suam perfectionem and beatitudinem nisi in supremo perfectivo
extrinseco, non essendo illud realiter, nec habendo illud formaliter sibi
inhaerens, sed attingendo illud, and sic habendo modo sibi possibili habendi.
Nullam perfectionem intrinsecam beatorum esse beatitudinem, nisi pro quanto
immediate conjungit perfectivo extrinseco, quod est objectum beatificum.

Quaestionis superius propositae duos jam expedivimus articulos, nempe DEUM in
sua essentia sicuti est videri oculis mentis creatae, Conclusio, quatenus DEI
essentia oculis mentis creatae videatur, and quatenus non compr^hendatur ejus
plenitud^.
visione nuda, aperta, immediata, manifesta, licet plenitudinem Deitatis nulla
creatura compraehendat compraehensione illa accurata, qua in Sanctissima
Trinitate Pater novit filium and filius Patrem, sed tantum pro modo suo eum
perfect attingant and teneant beatae mentes.

Tertia pars omnium difficillima est, de modo quo fit haec visio, pro cujus
investigatione, insignem illum librum de videndo DEO scripsit ad Paulinam
Augustinus, Proponi^^ quaestio a^modo quo h^c imm^^diata Vi^^ DEI.
and scholastici subtiliter exercentur. Neque de eo modeste inquirere,
sensumque adeo sacrae scripturae, hanc visionem describentis, sobria sedulitate
rimari, inutilis erit curiositas, and ventosa garrulitas, sed pars quaedam
conversationis illius Coelestis quam nobis commendant Sacrae Literae, qua
mentes nostrae ab omnibus carnis sensibus, Laudal^ and cond^^^bilis est ^^jus
mode^^ and pia in^stigatio.
quoad ejus fieri poterit, paulisper sevocatae, per hujusmodi Coelestia
progymnasmata a sordidis mundi curis ad sublimia erigantur, and beatificae
illius visionis suavis meditatio, ad eamque ardens anhelatio, and certa ejusdem
exspectatio cogitationes vanas a nobis abigat, mundanas cupiditates excutiat,
anxiam rerum fluxarum solicitudinem expectoret, ipsamque mortis, per quam ad
hanc beatitudinem transmittemur, formidinem absorbeat.

Paulo altius igitur rem cum Augustino repetamus. Aug. Ep^^ 112. and 13. de
^^nitate. (...) Visio (...) druplex. 1. VIS^ SYMBO^^^CA.
1. Videre dicimurea quae sensu corporis percipimus, vt corpora, per quorum
etiam imagines quas memoria tenemus, etiam absentia cogitamus. Talis DEI nulla
est visio in sua natura, sed tantum in assumpta creatura. Haec DEI VISIO
docendi causa dicatur SYMBOLICA.

2. Videmus illa mentis intuitu quae oculis mentis plane praesentia
conspicimus, 2. VI^^ INT^^^^VA.
licet corporeos sensus fugiant, nec aliorum de eis testimonio nitamur: sic
videt quisque vitam, voluntatem, cogitationem, memoriam, cognitionem,
intelligentiam, scientiam, fidem suam, and quicquid aliud mente conspicit,
atque ita esse non tantum credendo, sed plane videndo non dubitat, certa
scientia and clamante conscientia. Hoc modo viatores DEUM non videmus. Haec est
VISIO INTVITIVA.

3. Videmus and ea quae neque corporis sensibus, neque animi contuitu, Visio
RA^^OCINA^^VA.
in ejusdem rei quae cognoscenda est, evidentia, percipimus; sed ex iis quae
vidimus cogitatione vtcunque formamus, and memoriae commendamus, quo recurramus
cum voluerimus, vt illic ea, vel potius qualescunque eorum imagines quas ibi
fiximus, similiter recordatione cernamus. Hujusmodi Visione ratiocinativa DEUM
vident viatores ex intuitu operum divinorum, formantes de DEO veros licet
inadaequatos conceptus. Idque via triplici, (...) ratioci^^tivam vi^^em DEI
(...) triplex. Via caus^tatis. Via emi^^^tiae.
viz. Caussalitatis, Eminentiae, and Negationis seu remotionis. Nam invisibilia
DEI a creatione mundi per ea quae facta sunt conspiciuntur: aeterna scilicet
ejus tum potentia tum divinitas, vt monet Apostolus ad Romanos, cap. 1. verse,
20. Haec via est Caussalitatis, ab effectis ad causam. Altera est Eminentiae,
qua colligimus and cogitamus, quicquid entitatis, bonitatis, and perfectionis
est in creatura quacunque vel in omnibus creaturis, id totum esse eminentius in
DEO. Ne vero quicquam DEO nisi (...) tribuatur, ^ia nega^^^nis seu re^^tionis.
accedit Via Negationis seu remotionis, per quam ab illo removemus ea quae ei
non convenient: ad quam pertinet illud Damasceni, lib. 1. Orthod. Fidei. cap.
4. De DEO non possiumus scire quid est, sed solum quid non est: and quod site
scripsit Author operis de cardinalibus CHRISTI operibus (quod Cypriano
tribuitur) in praefatione; Affirmatio de DEI essentia in promptu haberi non
potest: neque' definibilis est Divinitas: sed verius sinceriusque remotio
indicat negando quid non sit, quam asserendo quid sit. Quoniam quicquid sensui
subjacet, illud esse non potest quod omnem superat intellectum. Quicquid audiri
vel videri vel sciri potest, non convenit majestati. Hebes est in hac
consideratione omnis acies sensuum, and caligat aspectus.

4. Est and visio fidei per fidem: 4. VISI^ FIDEI.
solo nixa testimonio Verbi DEI, cui de DEO, asserenti aliquid credimus. De qua
Hieronymus dixit, tunc mente cerni DEUM quando invisibilis creditur. Viatores
per fidem incedimus, non per aspectum (2. Cor. 5.7.) Non est de DEO (inquit
Hilarious) humanis judiciis sentiendum: neque enim nobis ea natura est, vt se in
coelestem cognitionem suis viribus efferat. A DEO discendum est, quid de DEO
intelligendum sit, quia non nisi se autore cognoscitur. Regula Fidei.
Adsit licet secularis doctrinae elaborata institutio, adsit vitae innocentia,
haec quidem proficient ad conscientiae gratulationem, non tamen cognitionem DEI
consequentur. Haec Hilarious Pictaviensis, lib. 5. de Trinit. Ubi mox subjicit,
Loquendum ergo non aliter de DEO est, quam vt ipse ad intelligentiam nostram de
se loquutus est.

BEATIFICA ILLA, quam expectamus, VISIO, Beatifica visio est intuitiva.
nec symbolica est, nec ratiocinativa, neque fidei, sed est INTUITIVA, seu
facie ad faciem; non specularis and aenigmatica, qualis est cognitio viatorum,
sed perfecta. Ex part enim cognoscimus, 1. Cor. 13.
and ex part prophetamus; cum autem venerit (...), quod perfectum est, tunc
(...) quod ex part est abolebitur.

Quaeritur jam quid sit illa i^tuitiva DEI visio. Quid sit DEI Visio intuitiva.
Aug. lib. 12. de Genesi ad literam. Cap. 27. Sic intelligendum arbitror quod
de Moyse scriptum est, concupiverat enim, vt in Exodus legimus, videre DEVM: non
vtique sicut viderat in money, Descriptio Augustiniana.
nec sicut videbat in tabernaculo, sed in ea substantia qua DEVS est, nulla
assumpta corporali creaturae, quae mortalis carnis sensibus praesentetur: neque
in spiritu figuratis similitudinibus corporum: sed per speciem suam quantum eam
capere creatura rationalis and intellectualis potest, sevocata ab omni corporis
sensu, and ab omni significativo aenigmate spiritus. Haec ille. Intuitiva DEI
visio est, sicut ex praemissis jam liquere arbitror, Intuitiv^ ^^sionis DEI
^mpendia^^a descrip^^o.
intellectualis, manifesta, and symbolis imaginibusque atque externis omnibus
testimoniis nuda, ipsius Divinae Effentiae immediata contemplatio.

Qua descriptione excluditur etiam intermedia species intelligibilis.
Exeluditur (...) hac* Vi^^one species ^ntelligibilis.
Quae licet sufficiat cognoscendae craturae; nulla tamen forma creata potest
esse idonea species seu similitudo repraesentans videnti DEI essentiam. Quia
sola essentia DEI est infinita, and est ipsum suum esse, neque potest nisi
admodum deficienter repraesentari per creatam speciem: nec tali specie indiget,
Vsus specie^um intelligibilium.
potens per se intellectum possibilem facere intellectum actu, qui est unicus
specierum intelligibilium vsus. Unde detegitur and aliud discrimen; nam species
intelligibiles informant intellectum actu intelligentem: Essentia Divinae non
informas intellectum sicut species intelligibilis.
DEITAS vero eis non egens, licet perfectius per modu^ objecti intelligibilis
seipsa conjungatur cum intellectu, vt ipsa sit id quod intelligitur, and quo
intelligitur; Non tamen est vera forma intellectus nostri, neque ex ea and
intellectu nostro efficitur vnum simpliciter, sicut in naturalibus ex forma and
materia naturali; sed proportio Essentiae Divinae ad intellectum nostrum est,
sicut proportio formae ad materiam, vt loquitur Thomas in 4. Sent. Did. 49.
Quaest. 2. Art. 1.

Si quaeras, quid in hac Visione intrinsecum habeat men's beata; Respondet
Thomas, (Part. 1. Quaest. 12. Art. 2. and in 3. Sent. Did. 14. Quaest. 1. Art.
3.) habet Lumen Divinae gloriae confortans and perficiens intellectum ad
videndum DEUM. Quid in hac Visione intrinsecum habeat men's ^eata.

Psalm. 36.


De quo dicitur in Psalmo; In lumine tuo videbimus lumen. Hoc lumen Bonaventura
(in 4. Sent. Did. 49. Art. 1. Quaest. 1.) vocat Influentiam DEI in animam,
Lumen gloriae, seu influe^tia DEI in animam, qua est ipsa Deiformitas, in quo
consistat,
quae est ipsa Deiformitas, and satietas. Haec tamen Deiformitas non in
similitudine DEI objectiva consistit, seu specie intelligibili DEVM
repraesentante, sed in ipsa operatione seu visione, qua men's DEVM videndo
attingit eique immediate conjungitur. Nam (vt monet Thomas in 3. Sent. Did.
14. Quaest. 1. Art. 3. and Quaest. 2. Art. 1.) omnis intellectus creatus qui
videt essentiam DEI, videt eam sine aliqua mediante similitudine: qui autem
cognoscit DEVM per similitudinem aliquam, sive impressam, sive a rebus
acceptam, non videt essentiam DEI: sed ad hoc quod videat DEVM oportet vt ipsa
DEI essentia conjungatur intellectui vt forma qua cognoscit determinate.

Innuere videtur Thomas, (ibi Quaest. 1. Art. 3.) lumen gloriae perficiens
intellectum possibilem ad cognoscendum DEI essentiam, Videtur (...) requ^ri
habitum luminis qui praecedat operationem mentis ad videndum Deum, sed
sufficere ipsius operationis lume^, quod DEVS menti donat per objecti beatifici
perpetuam praesentiam, remotis omnibus impedimentis*
esse Habitum quendam in intellectu. Si inesse intelligat per modum habitus,
quamvis habitus proprie dictus non sit, consentit cum Scoto, qui habitum ipsa
visione priorem, aut ab ipsa visione distinctum negans (in 3. Sent. Did. 14.
Quaest. 2. Number. 3. and 8.) sufficere docet ipsam mentis DEVM videntis
operationem seu visionis actum, qui est ita permanens in intellectu sicut
habitus, adeoque habet perfectionem actus primi and secundi, permanens semper
ex praesentia perpetua objecti beatifici, absque qua non permaneret vel actus
vel habitus. Non opus esse aliquo lumine intellectum ad videndum DEI essentiam
perficiente, tanquam forma absoluta alia a visione: tum quia ipsa visio est
lumen perfectum: tum quia essentia Divina est lux summa ex se, and de se
intelligibilis, and de se perfectissime motiva intellectus ad actum
intellectionis seu visionis, ita vt nullum lumen requirat cooperativum sibi.
Ideo alibi idem Scotus ait (in 4. Sent. Did. 49. Quaest. 2. Number. 9.) Essentia
Divina illabens potentiae intelligenti, perficit eam tanquam causa extrinseca,
vt objectum: and perficit eam formaliter, per formam causatam, quae est
OPERATIO attingens ipsam vt objectum. Et Number. 27. ibidem; Excepta relatione,
vltima perfectio intrinseca beati, and proxima objecto beatifico, seu
immediatissimum conjungens, est operatio. Haec Scotus.

Pro lumine gloriae, tanquam non necessario, Durandus (in 4. Sent. Did. 49.
Quaest. 2.) substituit remotionem duntaxat omnium impedimentoru^, Durand.
vt solam necessariam ad immediatam visionem DEI. Et Ioannes Major, in 3. Sent.
Did. 14. Quaest. 2. postquam dixit lumen gloriae ponendum esse in omni anima
beata, ^oann. Mae^^r.
nec posse intellectum creatum, de communi lege, videre DEVM sine aliquo
habitu, hoc est sine lumine gloriae: and id ipsum confirmavit ex Clementinis,
Tit. de Haereticis, Cap. Ad nostrum. Ubi Haereticum esse decernitur, Objectio
ex Clementinis, pro necessitate laminis gloriae.
si quis dixerit animam no^ indigere lumine gloriae ipsam elevante ad DEVM
videndum, and eo beat fruendum. Postquam, inquam, lumen gloriae asseruit
Major, mox ibidem subjicit, posse DEVM supplere causalitatem luminis gloriae
(si quam habeat) quod homo DEVM videat: partialiter illam visionem produce^do,
absque hoc quod lumen gloriae concurrat. Re^onsio ex Majore and ex ipsis
Clementinis.
Item, posse illam qualitatem quae est lumen gloriae stare in intellectu,
absque hoc quod illum habitum habens DEVM videat: posse enim prius stare sine
posteriore. Haec Major. Quod autem illam Clementis Papae quinti and Concilii
Viennensis determinationem attinet, patet ex loco citato Clementinarum, eam
opponi illorum duntaxat errori qui asserebant quamlibet intellectualem naturam
in seipsa naturaliter esse beatam: nec indigere action DEI, quo solo faciente
videri potest ipsius essentia: qui error evertitur sufficienter, etiamsi
teneatur doctrina Scoti and Durandi, habitum luminis gloriae alium ab ipsa
visione beatifica negantium: sufficit enim agnoscere actum seu operationem esse
DEI donum, qui operatur in nobis and velle and operari. Quod and ipse docet,
Philip. ^.
Scotus in 3. Sent. Did. 14. Quaest. 2. Number. 4. vbi docet Visionem Beatificam
no^ posse inesse humano intellectui ex naturalibus suis, vel ex causa naturali;
nec posse inesse, nisi a Deo causante istam visione^ immediate and
supernaturaliter. Et Durandus in 4. Sent. Did. 49. Quaest. 2.. 24. vbi
profitetur hanc immediatam visionem fieri non secundum ordinem naturae, sed
secundum ordinem Divinae gratiae. Et. 28. vbi hanc rationem reddit diversorum
graduum beatitudinis Coelestis, etiam absque illo habitu luminis gloriae, Ratio
diversitatis graduum beatitudinis, absque habit^^ luminis gloriae.
quamvis inter intellectus humanos non sit gradus majoris and minoris
perfectionis, and essentia Divina eodem modo and aeque immediate cuilibet
intellectui beato repraesentetur, atque adeo non sit differentia vel ex part
intellectus recipientis, vel ex part objecti praesentati: his, inquam, non
obstantibus, hanc diversorum graduum beatitudinis inter homines, and
aequationis hominum cum Angelis, rationem reddit Durandus, quia nihilominus
DEVS potest perfectiorem actum intelligendi influere vni quam alteri, and
homini quam Angelo, and sic poterit vnus homo esse beatior altero, and aeque
beatus cum Angelo, (quamvis habente naturaliter intellectum humano
praestantiorem) vel beatior ipso, secundum diversitatem perfectionis actus
intelligendi impressi huic vel illi.

Re convenit Durando cum Scoto: vterque enim ponit operationem, and haec
impedimentorum postulat remotionem. Nec dissentiunt Thomas and Bonaventura and
Clemens, Conciliatio responsionu^ quae a diversis adferuntur.
si lumen gloriae and influentiam and Deiformitatem exponas operationem mentis,
Divino munere datam, and instar habitus permanentem in mente intuente Divinam
essentiam, sese immediate repraesentantem and menti conjungentem: quae operatio
dici potest lumen and influentia and Deiformitas, quia est DEI donum, menti
intrinsecum, conjungens eam cum DEO immediate.

Scotus in 4. Sent. Did. 49. Quaest. 12. Arg. 5. objicit sibi, Quomodo
immediate videatur DEVS per actum fidei, Secundum. Scotum. In quo consistat
vltima beatit ^de hominis.
posse DEVM in vita mortali immediate cognosci per actum fidei. Et respondet,
posse quidem cognosci and diligi hic immediate; tamen in communi and confuse:
talem autem dilectionem and notitiam non esse vltimam beatitudinem possibilem
homini; sed hanc consistere in cognitione intuitiva clara, and dilectione
correspondente.

Haec pauca de modo hujus ineffabilis visionis suggessisse sufficiat.

Tandem superest, vt dicamus quo sensu etiam intellectui humano vel Angelico
invisibilis sit DEUS. Haec etiam pars breviter absolvenda est.

Quatuor tantum invisibilitatis hujus gradus strictim indicabo. Quatuor gradus
invisibilit^tis, quibus DEI essentia est invisibilis intellectui humano vel
Angelico.

1. Gradus. Immediatae visio essentiae Divinae non in via daetur, ex leg^^
communi, sed in patria.




Primus gradus est, Viatoribus ex lege communi non datur videre DEI essentiam,
sed Patriae haec visio reservatur, vt docent passim Sacrae Literae. Dixi, ex
lege communi, quia, vt nulla moveatur (certe nulla moveri debet) controversia
de DOMINO nostro JESUS CHRISTO, qui ipse totaque ejus vita ingens fuit
miraculum, (...), simul Viator and Compraehensor, vt recte observarunt Petrus
Lombardus, 3. Sent. Did. 16. and Bonaventura ibidem Art. 2. Quaest. 2. in
Resolutione. Et Thomas in 3. Sent. Did. 15. Quaest. 3. Art. 2. Et in Summa, 3.
Part. Quaest. 15. Art. 10. and alii: vt inquam conticescat omnis de CHRISTO
dubitatio; existimarunt quidam Veteres Patres, Christus s^^mul v^at^^ and
comprae^hensor.
eosque sequuti Scholastici Theologi, visam esse Mosi adhuc in itinere
constituto DEI essentiam, Visio Div^^na essentia^^ quibusdam in hac v^^posit^s
mi^^culose con^concessa: Mosi, and Paulo.
quia de eo dicit DOMINUS in repraehensione Aaronis and Mariae, Mosi autem per
speciem, non per aenigmata, and gloriam DOMINI videbit. Idem de Paulo sentiunt
in tertium Coelum rapto. Nempe, si eis tunc concessa est ea visio, miraculum
fuit. De quo ita disserit Augustinus, Lib. de videndo DEO, sive Epist. 112.
Cap. 13. Potest (inquit) movere, quomodo jam ipsa DEI substantia videri
potuerit a quibusdam in hac vita positis, propter illud quod dictum est ad
Moysen, Number. ^^
Nemo potest videre faciem meam, and vivere: 2. Cor. 1^
Nisi quia potest humana men's divinitus rapi ex hac vita ad Angelicam vitam,
Exodus 33
antequam per istam communem mortem carne solvatur. Sic enim raptus est qui
audivit illic ineffabilia verba quae non licet homini loqui: vbi vsque adeo
facta est ab hujus vitae sensibus quaedam intentionis aversio, vt sive in
corpore, sive extra corpus fuerit, id est, vtrum sicut solet in vehementiori
ecstasi, men's ab hac vita in illam vitam fuerit alienata, manente corporis
vinculo, an omnino resolutio facta fuerit qualis in plena morte contingit,
nescire se diceret. Ita fit vt and illud verum sit quod dictum est, Nemo potest
faciem meam videre, and vivere, quia necesse est abstrahi ab hac vita mentem,
quando in illius ineffabilitatem visionis assumitur; and non sit incredibile
quibusdam Sanctis nondum ita defunctis, vt sepelienda cadavera remanerent,
etiam istam excellentiam revelationis ^jus concessam fuisse. Haec Augustinus.

Ex ea revelationis hyperbole, Moysi and Paulo, in itinere, Vnde illa Mosis and
^auli inusi^itae vota. ^xod. 32.32. ^om. 9 3.
prae aliis meris hominibus viatoribus, concessa, exstitit illa zeli probe
oculati stupenda flagrantia, and charitatis alte volantis pernix sublimitas,
qua pro DEI gloria, and populi Israelitici salute, Moses de DEI libro deleri,
and Paulus anathema a CHRISTO esse, intrepide exoptarunt.

Secundus gradus est; Haec visio solis conceditur mundis cord, (...). Gradus,
^nmundo ^^rdi invisi (...) est ^EVS, Matthew. 5.
juxta illud, Beati mundi cord, quoniam ipsi DEVM videbunt. Ab hac igitur
visione Diabolus and omnes angeli ejus, and omnes cum eis impii sine vlla
nebula dubitationis exclusi sunt, quoniam mundo cord non sunt. Verba sunt
Augustini, Lib. de videndo DEO, Cap. 11. Unde etiam (vt idem monet Cap. vlt.)
sine vlla dubitatione perspicimus, ad videndum DEUM, per ejus auxilium cor
mundum nos debere praeparare. Pacem (inquit Apostolus) sectamini cum omnibus,
and sanctimoniam, sine qua nemo videbit DOMINVM. ^ebr. 12.14.


Tertius gradus est; DEUM non vident miseri, nam fugat omnem miseriam haec
beatifica visio, Gradus, (...) miser ^EVM viz.
juxta illud; Laetitia sempiterna super caput eorum: Gaudium and laetitiam
appraehendent, fugientque tristitia and gemitus. Item; (...). 35. vlt (...).
60.20.
Non occidet vltra Sol tuus, and Luna tua non deficiet: quia DOMINVS erit tibi
in lucem sempiternam, and completi erunt [seu finientur] dies luctus tui. Item;
Absterget DEVS omnem lachrymam ab oculis eorum: ^ocal. 7.17. (...) 21.4.
and mors non erit amplius, neque luctus, neque clamor, neque labor erit
amplius. Horum insignem quidem arrham and dulces primitias largitur DEUS
Ecclesiae peregrinanti: (sicut in illustri suo in Apocalypsin Co^mentario
Revere^dissimus Genitor meus luculenter docuit) gloriosa tamen plenitudo, seu
beatifica perfectio in Patria demum obtinetur.

Se de Mose and Paulo objiciatur, Objectio M^se and Pa^lo. Respons^o
quod non obsta^te illa visione quae ipsis co^cessa est, cum multis tame^
necesse habuerint conflictari miseriis: Respondeo; Durante illa visione, nullo
afficiebantur dolor, nam vires inferiores omnino a suis actibus abstrahebantur
in illo raptu Pauli, vt recte monet Thomas, in 3. Sent. Did. 15. Quaest. 2.
Art. 3. Et ex ipsis Apostoli verbis manifestum est. Id ipsum verisimile est and
Mosi contigisse. Durandus visionem illam Paulo concessam ait fuisse per modum
passionis transeuntis, Disc^^men visionis Mo^si and Paulo concesse, and
visisnis bea^torum.
non autem per modum habitus permanentis, quomodo se habet Visio Beatorum in
Coelis, in 3. Sent. Did. 16. Quaest. 2.. 7. Et Ioannes Major ait Mosen and
Paulum vidisse DEVM in vita raptim, in 3. Sent. Did. 14. Quaest. 1. Idcirco
Paulus profitetur se nondum compraehendisse, PHILIP. 3. Nempe, permanenter, vt
beati and perfecti.

At inquies, CHRISTVS habens Visionem Beatificam per modum habitus permanentis,
Objectio de CHRISTO.
multos interea sentiebat dolores, tempore suae mortalitatis.

Respondeo; Responsio. Singular miraculum fuit quod CHRISTVS simul viater
esset and compraehensor.
CHRISTVS solus simul Viator and Compraehensor, habuit simul bona viae quaedam,
vt gratiae plenitudinem; and bona Patriae, vt non posse peccare, and DEI
perfectam contemplationem; and quaedam etiam mala viae, vt afflictiones, and
mortalitatem: vt recte monet Petrus Lombardus, lib. 3. Sent. Did. 16. Verum
est (inquit ibi BONAVENTVRA) quod beatitudo miseriae opponitur secundum legem
communem, and non reperitur in aliquo simul gloria cum miseria. Et ratio hujus
est, quia vnusquisque est in vno statu, non in duplici: sed quoniam CHRISTVS in
duplici statu erat, vel quasi rationem tenebat duplicis personae; sicut in
CHRISTO status est compossibilis statui, sine repugnantia, sic beatitudo cum
miseria. Et paulo superius, ^olor Chri^^i non erat ^^m^rarius ^^audio
frui^^onis, nec ^^lud (...), aut ^^^nuebat.
ibidem dicit BONAVENTVRA; Fuisse in anima CHRISTI, secundum eandem potentiam,
and secundum eundem statum potentiae, dolorem and gaudium, ita vt nec dolor
superveniens discontinuaverit gaudium, sed simul fuerit; nec iterum (quod majus
est) dolor intensus valde, fecerit gaudium esse minus perfectum. Dolorem autem
illum, and gaudium in CHRISTO, non habuisse contrarietatem, sed vnum fuisse
materiale respectu alterius, and ideo simul eidem inesse potuisse, quia ex hoc
ipso CHRISTVS gaudebat in DOMINO, quo sentiebatse pati and dolor pro DOMINO.
Sicut etiam in vero poenitente videmus, quod simul doleat, and de dolor
gaudeat. Haec BONAVENTVRA, in 3. Sent. Did. 16. Art. 2. Quaest. 2. Sic THOMAS
de eodem CHRISTI dolor eodemque gaudio disserens; Qui tamen (inquit) dolor
erat quodam modo materia gaudii fruitionis, in quantum gaudium illud se
extendebat ad omnia illa quae appraehenduntur vt DEO placita. Et sic patet quod
dolor qui erat in anima CHRISTI nullo modo gaudium fruitionis impediebat, neque
per modum contrarietatis, neque per modum redundantiae, etc. Haec THOMAS, in 3.
Sent. Did. 15. Quaest. 2. Art. 3.

Fuit hoc in CHRISTO speciale miraculum quod gloria animae non statim
redundaverit in corpus, Miraculum impediens impassilitatem, qua alioqui fuisset
in primo instante unionis.
sed fuerit aliquamdiu mortale, and quod cum Visione Beatifica dolorem passa
sit ipsa ejus anima; vt recte observat SCOTVS, in 3. Sent. Did. 16. Quaest. 2.
Number. 5. Et Did. 18. Quaestione vnica, Number. 15. vbi ait; Gloria and
impassibilitas corporis and animae infuissent CHRISTO in primo instante
vnionis, nisi per miraculum fuissent prohibita. Et paulo post, ait CHRISTVM
affectione justitiae fuisse sum conjunctum fini, ita vt nullo modo posset
injuste velle vel peccare, attamen quoad affectionem commodi, Nota
distinctionem inter affectionem justitiae, and affectionem commodi.
nondum fuisse sum conjunctum, sed potuisse aliquid pati contra affectionem
commodi, and illud CHRISTUM potuisse ordinate velle, and acceptare, and ita
mereri: secus ac se habet in aliis beatis, quibus nullum occurrit in Patria
objectum, quod affectione commodi, tanquam sibi incommodum aversentur, and
affectione justitiae meritoria amplectantur, ideoque sunt jam prorsus extra
statum merendi. Non sic olim CHRISTUS qui secundum aliquid, Qui non est Vihtor*
non est in statu merendi.
fuit in statu Via^oris, and nondum omni modo in termino. Ideo passiones illas,
ob nullum ipsius peccatum ei debitas, a quibus per affectionem commodi
naturaliter atque irrepraehensibiliter abhorrebat, voluntary atque obedienter
suscipiendo per affectionem justitiae, vere merebatur; sicut recte docet
SCOTVS, Quaestione proxime citata. Nunc autem, postquam Viator esse desiit,
cessante miraculo illo quod corporis and animae impassibilitatem impediebat,
non est amplius in statu merendi; vt monet THOMAS, Part. 3. Quaest. 19. Art. 3.
ad primum.

Passiones illae CHRISTI temporariae non constituebant miserum, nam erant etiam
voluntariae, CHRISTVS in mediis miseriis non miser, sed beatus, licet
conflictans cum miseriis.
and meritoriae, and materia gaudii: ideoque Visionis Beatificae laetitiam non
impediebant, non minuebant: vnde stat assertio nostra, de tertio gradu
invisibilitatis; DEVM non vident miseri. Et quod diximus, Fugari visione hac
omnem miseriam, id intelligendum est, de lege communi, nisi beatitatis hujus
redundantia, quae omnem prorsus excluderet miseriam, per miraculum impediatur,
quemadmodum in CHRISTO ad tempus contigit.

Quartus denique gradus est, 4. Gradu Nulla m^n creata videndo assequitur
infinitam DEI perfectionem.
Quod (sicut superius Chrysostom. Ambr. and Aug. monebant) ne a puris quidem and
beatis mentibus ea quae in DEO habitat plenitudo perfect compraehenditur, id
est, (vt recte explicat THOMAS, in 3. Sent. Did. 14. Quest. 2.) Secundum totam
rationem suae cognoscibilitatis. Quamvis enim anima CHRISTI, and omnis beata
anima, videat totam essentiam DEI, quia tamen efficacia intellectus creati
videntis DEUM, non adaequatur objecto quod videtur, ideo etsi videt totam DEI
essentiam, (quippe quae impartibilis est) non tamen eam totaliter videt; Anima
CHRISTI, and omnis anima beata, videt totam DEI essentiam, sed non totalit^r.
id est, ita vt visibilitas objecti non excedat modum videntis, sed videns ita
perfect videat, sicut res perfect visibilis est. Nullus enim intellectus
creatus potest essentiam DEI totaliter videre: quia ejus efficacia non est
tanta in intelligendo, quanta est veritas sive claritas Divinae Essentiae
secundum quam visibilis est: Quod solius Divini est intellectus: and ideo ipse
solus seipsum totaliter cognoscit; vt accurate atque apposite argumentatur
THOMAS, loco citato.

Visionis beatisicae delectabilis plenitudo.
Beati plenitudinem Divinae Essentiae non compraehendunt secundum perfectionem
objecti quod videtur; DEUM tamen vident perfect in vltima perfectione
videntium. Nullus in viso terminus, nullus videnti defectus. Manet in nobis
gaudium DOMINI nostri, Ioann. 11.11
etiam in agone adhuc constitutis: quanto magis in statu gloriae permanebit in
nobis in secula feculorum? Matthew. 25.11.
Attamen non dicit DOMINUS servo bono and fideli, intret in te gaudium meum:
quamvis intimos animi recessus penetret ineffabilis illa laetitia: sed, Intra
in gaudium DOMINI tui. Nam sicut aves in aerem, and pisces in oceanum, ita in
aeternum illum gaudium intrant beati, eoque implentur, licet ejus immensitatem
non compraehendant, fed ab ea potius compraehendantur. 2a 2ae qu. 28. art. 3.
Unde recte THOMAS ait, gaudium beatorum esse perfect plenum, and etiam
superplenum, ex part ipsorum gaudentium, quia plus obtinebunt, quam desiderare
suffecerint sive valuerint: and hanc esse mensuram illam bonam and
supereffluentem, Lu^. 6.38.
quae danda promittitur in sinum eorum. At ex part rei, de qua gaudetur, cum
illud sit plenum gaudium quo de ea gaudetur pro dignitate ipsius rei, ita vt
rei dignitatem gaudium adaequet; hoc sensu solum DEI Ipsius gaudium esse plenum
de se ipso, quia solum gaudium DEI est infinitum, and infinitae bonitati DEI
aequale. Quia autem nulla creatura est capax gaudii de DEO ei condigni; inde
esse quod istud gaudium omnino plenum non capiatur in homine, sed potius homo
intret in ipsum; secundum illud MATTHEW. xxv. Intra in gaudium DOMINI tui. Haec
THOMAS, 2a 2ae Quaest. 28. Art. 3. in corpore articuli.

Nullum est visionis hujus taedium: sed perfecta atque indefessa delectatione
ac plenitudine in infinito inexhaustae beatitudinis oceano semper deliciantur
beati Spiritus. Vident semper, and videre desiderant, sine anxietate
desiderant, and sine fastidio satiantur.

Iuvat hic exclamare, beati mundicordes, quoniam ipsi DEUM videbunt. Quibus
negatur, ii sunt infoelicissimi.
Illa namque visio DEI (inquit AUGUST.) tantae pulchritudinis visio est, and
tanto amore dignissima, vt sine hac quibuslibet aliis bonis praeditum atque
abundantem non dubitet Plotinus infoelicissimum dicere. Haec AUGUST. Lib. 10.
de Civitate DEI, Cap. 16.

Duo sunt (inquit idem AUGUST. super magnificat) quae Angelorum and hominum
beati spiritus in illo font boni aeterna contemplatione hauriunt, Beati
Majestatem DEI venerantur, and ejus bonitatem amant.
incompraehen^ibilis scilicet Majestas DEI, and ineffabilis bonitas. Quarum
alterum castum timorem gerit, alterum dilectionem parit, pro Majestate
Venerantur DEVM, and pro bonitate amant: ne vel dilectio sine reverentia
dissoluta sit, vel reverentia sine dilectione poenalis.

Haec est illa visio facie ad faciem, quae summum praemium promittitur justis,
vt loquitur AVGVSTINVS, Lib. 1. de TRINIT. Cap. vlt. Haec mensura voti,
vigiliarum hic nostrarum finis, haec meta laborum est. Tunc experiendo
cognoscemus illam laetitiae plenitudinem, de qua PSALTES ait, (...). PSALM. xvj.
vlt. Et repetit PETRVS, ACT. ij.28. Tunc justi fulgebant sicut Sol in Regno
Patris eorum (MATTHEW. xiij.) Putas qualis tunc erit splendour animarum, quando
solis claritatem habebat lux corporum? AVG. SERMON. 35. de verbis Apostoli. Nec
solum firmamento, stellis, soli, sed etiam claritati Angelicae decor illius
pulchritudinis electorum comparatur: erunt enim (...). imo (...), DEO similes
per beatificam DEI visionem, 1. IOANN. 3.2.

In ea foelicitate (ait AVG. Lib. 13. de TRINIT. Cap. 7.) quicquid amabitur
aderit, Ineffabilis foelicitas.
nec desiderabitur quod non aderit: omne quod ibi erit, bonum erit, and summus
DEUS summum bonum erit, atque ad fruendum amantibus praesto erit, and quod est
omnino beatissimum, ita semper fore certum erit.

EPICEDIUM.
SI quid ab ingenio liceat sperare, vel vsus

Sollicitare queant crudeli vulnere mentem;
Sive quis Ausonio plectro, fidibusque canoris,

Sermones referat quos infans audiit orbis:
Hic sese accincti sistant; hoc carmine vires
Intendant mecum socias: moestaque cupresso
Praesulis incingant feralia busta: supremi

Liber agit curis, exoptatamque quietem
Attigit; haud tacitis hoc immedicabile damnum
Quaestibus, elapsum compresso transeat ore.
At non Castalios latices, Ephyraea fluenta

Flectere Pernassum gressus: hinc cuncta prophana
Arceo: sit mihi dux magno qui praesidet orbi;
Ille hominum pecudumque sator, sator ille volucru^,
Aeolii qui flabra noti, tumidasque procellas
Temperat, and rapidi sternit vada concita Nerei.
Grampiacis devexa jugis loca, frigida coelo,
Difficilique solo, septem subjecta trioni;
Unde vel Eridani nescit vel flamma Canopi
Conspicier, saevit campis vbi Caurus apertis,
Quis putet herois tanti natalibus omnem
Pone Caledoniam liquisse; hinc divite vena
Illuxisse orbi ingenium mirabile, cunas
Hos habuisse lares, surgens vbi proxima coelo
Marria, (robustis laudata and foeta colonis)
Piniferas aperit rupes; mitescere sensim
Incipiens, terras Cereri camposque relinquit,
Quam Dea praecingens, rapido petit aequora cursu,
Limpidus, illimis, puro liquidissimus amne.
Cardine sed Boreae foelicia rura pererrat
Dona, recurvatis ludens per gramina ripis.
Sic te Dalmatici montes Hieronyme; sic te,
Qui Buchanane feris sublimi sidera plectro,
Asperioris agri Levinia protulit; at nunc
Ausonios revocas dubia ad certamina vates.
Quid referam Thebas, Ascramque, and maxima famae
Nomina, quae propriis tantum debentur alumnis.
Iam si nobilitas placeat, si stemmata famae
In censum veniant, claris majoribus, illis
Haud indignum atavis, haud inferioribus ausis,
(Nil opus acciri falsae praeconia linguae)
FORBESIDUM domus hunc generosi sanguinis altrix
Edidit: hanc plebis sortem and communia vulgi
Iura supergressam factis audacibus, omni
Cum procerum coetu stupuit rex maximus, vnde
PATRICIVS collatus honos: nec nupera facta
Hoc peperere decus, longis annalibus ista
Credita sunt, secli veteris melioribus annis.
Sic neque degeneres sese ostendere nepotes,
Armatas acies campis immittere, ferro
Exercere manus ausi, civilibus armis

At postquam arctois fulsit regionibus astrum
Pacificum, cujus praesens reverentia bellum
Depulit, atque faces belli, Mars impius orb

Hoc fatis IACOBE tuis regum optime debet
Pacis hyperboreae vinclum, pax reddita nobis.
Sic posita feritate omnes mansuevimus, omnes
Diversis agimur studiis, sua cuique voluptas.
Pars Themidis streperique fori subsellia tentat:

Explorare poli: veteris pars dogmata Coi
Indagare senis, juvat ars ex art medendi:
Hi sua rura colunt, validisque ligonibus instant.
Oceanus placet his; per stagna immensa profundi

Et non exiguus populus, quem taedia vitae
Otiaque exagitanr, cupide nova praelia poscens
Exulat, atque aliis Martem vestigat in oris,
At non FORBESIO stadio decurrere tali

Ergo cupita sibi indicens certamina, nulla
Tempora, nil nimium procrastinat, incitus, ardens,
Legibus obsequitur quos dixerat ipse; profunda

Altius impellit pectus; natura ministrat
Et consuetudo duplici munimine vires.
Nil quod dedeceat factum: morum integer, aevi
Integer: innocuis vix laxat frena juventae
Deliciis, canus studiis lanugine prima:
Atque inclinati reparator plurimus aevi.
Rara quies, comis gravitas, tranquilla serenae
Temperies frontis, parcis dapibusque, profundo
Nunquam mersa mero sunt pocula, nulla prophanis
Gratia convivis, castus sermonibus, asper
Et castigator tristis peccantis amici.
Non animo indulsit sectari Heliconia serta:
Displicuitque comis necti Phoebeia laurus.
Et dedignatus Themidis fora, Paeonis arts,
Nec Chaldaeorum damnata scientia cordi est.
Sed vegetum ingenium regerens ad originis altae
Semina, coelestum vetera ad primordia rerum
Fert avidos passus, animoque oculisque salutis
Autorem agnoscens, coelo defixus inerrat.
Et labefacta gemens pietatis germina; laxis
Moribus indomito pereuntia secula luxu,
Hinc caligantes sensus, mentisque veternum,
Et libertatis quaesito nomine certum
Exitium, serpente malo, crescente ruina,
Indoluit miseris, sacrisque operarier infit.
Primaque cura fuit divini nectaris haustu
Perfudisse lares; mox proxima limina sacrae
Aedis inexhaustae senserunt fulmina linguae.
Ac veluti occulto quae fulvi vena metalli
Monte latet, vel quae nescitur clausa profundo
Gemma mari, nullos hominum poscuntur in vsus:
Eruta diversis ludunt, capiuntque figuris.
Talis erat, nondum curis immissus apertis,
Divitiis opulens tacitis, tectoque metallo.
Agnitus extractus placuit, penitusque probatum
Ambitiosus honos nulla ambitione peritus
Consequitur, sacer ordo premit, celsique fatigat
Imperii diadema tenens; communia vota
Contulit haud tacitum justa ad suffragia vulgus.
Infula sacra sacris manibus collata, decoram
Canitiem velat; sed non hic limes honorum
Constitit, ille arts atque haud vulgariter arts

Addidit augusti fastigia celsa senatus:
Arbitrium patuit rerum, penetralibus altis
Curia suscepitque lubens; arcanaque regni
Cum patribus consors consortibus ardua tractat.
Non tamen ingenium (tanta est constantia) cedit

Ignea vis animi, curis gravioribus impar.
Et quanquam illicibus certaret curia fallax
Obsequiis tentare gradus, non fulgor honorum
Emollit rigidum and non exorabile pectus.

Excubias agitare gregi, vigilantia semper
Lumina, custodes oculos praetendere: si quem
Devius error agat, reducem mox sistere; si quid
Collapsum offendat mox instaurare; labori

Iudicii trutinans examine; pellere segnes,
Emeritos donis meritisque ornare trophaeis.
At non illa meae pavidae constantia mentis,
Ut te digna canat, (magni haec sunt munia vatis,

Implicito curis gravioribus) aut mea vires
Sufficient in vora leves, vt grandia rerum
Exequar inculto versu; violare pudorem
Hoc erit, atque tuae maculas adspergere famae.

Pierios agitat numeros: tu solus inani
Nec strepitu crescis verbo^um, nec tibi livor
Pallidus emeriti decerpit culmen honoris.
Audax morte tua dissolvo vincula linguae
Libera, non calamo venali posco laborum
Praemia, non vocis pretium, pretiosius auro
Sit mihi vera loqui, poscunt tua funera verum.
At quae saepe meo volvi sub pectore, quaeque
Faucibus errabant dubiis, audita severo
Illa supercilio tibi fastidita, supremo
Fas cineri, fas exequiis, moestoque sepulchro
Promere, fas nato tanti solatia luctus
Quaerere, quo vivis redevivus, sospite nulla
Busti damna feres, nulla damnabere longi
Temporis invidia, seris memorabere seclis.
Aeternumque manent victura volumina, culti
Ingenii decus, and priscos referentia mores.
His commissa tuae quondam tot millia curae
Pascis adhuc dapibus, plenis laticesque ministras
Gurgitibus, nec sola tui provincia nostra
Sentit opes calami, sed Tethys quicquid amaris
Cingit aquis, gelidae porrecta per vltima Thules
Litora diversam Rutupini ad marginis oram.

EST latebrosa specus, densataque vimine multo,

Naturae genio, longum servata per aevum.
Cui superincumbunt rupes, praeruptaque saxa,
Subtus aquae dulces praeterlabuntur, vbi altum
Regulus extollit quadrata cuspide culmen.
Saepe domus moestis Pastorum nota querelis.
Huc se proripiunt Codrus, and Sarvistus, acerbis
Deflentes lachrymis mortem Coridonis, and aegro
Cord pias curas noctesque diesque revolvunt.
Heu Coridon Coridon, quae te fata improba nobis
Eripiunt? Falluntque preces and inania vota.
Sarv. Sed postquam exhaustae vires, animique, nec vltra
Sufficient lachry mis oculi, nec pectora planctum
Far valent: Sarvistus ait, quid denique Codre
Quid tantum insano juvat indulgere dolori?
Quid miseras miseri nos flendo perdimus horas*
Ingrati morimur. Moestis quin funeris vmbris
Inferias and justa damus? Quin carmine sacro
Placamus manes? Meritosque ex ordine honores
Solvimus? His saltem fas sit lenire dolorem.
Heu Coridon Coridon, quae te fata improba nobis
Eripiunt? Falluntque preces and inania vota.

Codr. Non equidem Sarviste tibi parere recuso.
Ergo alacreis, omnes ad quas sacravimus aras
Insontes castosque vocemus. Adeste frequentes
Dique hominesque sacris, semperque infausta cupressus
Serta dabit, pullis p^^eae intertexta racemis.
Ferte leves violas, calathis date lilia plenis,
Thus adolete pio cineri, vinoque recenti
Abluite; and bibulam perfundite rore favillam:
Tuque O magna tui Coridonis cura venito:
Iunge puer calamos, querulis and versibus apta.
Heu Coridon Coridon, quae te fata improba nobis
Eripiunt? Falluntque preces and inania vota.

Sarv. Dum Licidas formosus oves ad mulctra, capellas
Mopsus agit; tenuique intersero vimine juncos
Ut calathum faciam (calathi mihi plurimus vsus
Dum fortunato cineri, bustoque quotannis
Thura, rosas, violas, and agrestia munera pendo)
Alternare vices juvat, atque inducere Coelo
Carminibus; nam dignus erat quem Thracius Orpheu^
Quemque Linus, Nymphaeque omnes Musaeque canorae
Quem Pan, quem Charites, and quem cantaret Apollo.
Heu Coridon Coridon, quae te fata improba nobis
Eripiunt? Falluntque preces and inania vota.

Codr. Moesta veni Libitina, veni, sacrumque furorem
Incute pectoribus; ferales dicere cantus
Agredimur, magnique olim celebramus amici
Exequias: tu moesta modos, tu carmina manda,
Tu lachrymis decora meritis, meritoque dolori
Certet amor, dubio sic vt certamine crescant.
Heu Coridon Coridon, non te fata improba nobis
Eripiunt? falluntque preces, and inania vota.

Sarv. Illius Armeniae solitae mansuescere cantu
Tigrides, Hircanique ferocia corda Leones
Ponere, and insuetis submittere colla catenis.
Armatumque pedo aut funda, quam saepe furentes
Avertisse lupos stabulis; tunc vidimus ipsi,
Nunc meminisse juvat? Cum nos per amoena vireta
Pascere fecit oves posita formidine* Tanto
Vindice securas fallebant somnia noctes.
Heu Coridon Coridon, quae te fata improba nobis
Eripiunt? Falluntque preces and inania vota.

Codr. Ille levi calamo quondam, blandaque potentis
Virtute eloquii, diae and modulamine vocis
Palantes revocavit oves, oviumque magistros.
Cum procul a stabulis, cum per spelaea ferarum
Per loca senta situ, per inhospita tesqua, per vndas
Erravere greges variis ambagibus acti.
Scilicet incautas mentes oviumque ducumque
Libertatis amor demens, studiumque fefellit.
Heu Coridon Coridon, quae te fata improba nobis
Eripiunt? Falluntque preces and inania vota.

Sarv. Heu Coridon Coridon, pecoris fidissime custos,
Postquam te rapuit durae inclementia mortis,
Orbavitque tuis studiis, curaque paterna,
Incubuere ferae stabulis. Penitusque cruentis
Unguibus, and saevo foedarent omnia morsu;
Ni tua progenies, quondam spes magna tuorum,
Nunc decus, atque ingens pastorum gloria Daphni^
Irruat, and late populantes arceat, and ni
Provocet ipse alios, primusque in proelia tendat.
Heu Coridon Coridon, quae te fata improba nobis
Eripiunt? Falluntque preces and inania vota.

Codr. Tu ne etiam moreris longa dignissime vita
Tu ne etiam Coridon? Nec te fiducia divum,
Nec tua te virtus, nec opimi ruris honores,
Nec te noster amor, nec vota precesque tuorum,
Nec lachrymae valuere piae defendere contra
Fata trium (proh non vili exoranda) sororum?
Ergo vale, Venerande Senex, semperque tuorum
Sis memor; and si quid tangant mortalia manes,
Supplicibus tibi quae facinus nos annue votis.
Heu Coridon Coridon, quae te fata improba nobis
Eripiunt? Falluntque preces and inania vota.

Sarv. Sed quid Codre agimus? Quo nos malus abstuli terror
In diversa trahens animos? Nimiusque fefellit
Corda dolor? Vivit Coridon, regnoque potitur,
Sidereis long super aethera vecta quadrigis
Pars melior, solioque sedet sublimis eburno.
Ergo modum lachrymis, and finem Codre dolori
Pone tuo, and faustis celebremus gaudia votis.
Non Coridon Coridon, non te fata improba nobis
Eripiunt, falluntque preces and inania vota.

Codr. Credo equide^, nam vera refers, nec vanus haruspex,
Nec volucrum cursus, nec praepetis omina pennae
Praescia venturi nec viscera lenta ferarum
Praedixere mihi. Vidi vidi ipse volantem,
Scandentem nubes calcantemque aethera, and ipsos
Iam suoerare polos, and sidera, jamque tenebat
Regalesque domos, altique palatia Coeli.
Agnovi geniumque viri, faciemque decoram,
Sidereosque oculos, and celsae frontis honores.
Non Coridon Coridon, non te fata improba nobis
Eripiunt, falluntque preces, and inania vota.

Sarv. Vos superae mentes, vos celsae numinis alti
Participes animae, nec dis indigna secutae,
Coelorum facti cives, proceresque perennes,
Currite in amplexus atque oscula, jungite dextras,
Accipite ha^c animam, numero que adscribite vestro.
Spondeo non regno indecorem. Gratissimus astris
Hospes adest, sesponte fores and limina pandunt.
Non Coridon Coridon, non te fata improba nobis
Eripiunt, falluntque preces, and inania vota.

Codr. Vos Iovis aligeri comites, fidique ministri
Coelituum, vos militiae pars maxima divum,
Qui quondam patris imperium, quique arma secuti,
Horrendas furiarum acies, animasque superbas
Eumenidum, toto deturbavistis olympo.
Vos quibus est nostrae concredita cura salutis,
Corporaque, atque ipsas hominu^ defenditis vmbras,
Huc alacres properate, ignitos jungite currus,
Suscipite hanc animam, patrioque inducite Coelo.
Non Coridon Coridon, non te fata improba nobis
Eripiunt, falluntque preces, and inania vota.

Sarv. Tuque parens rerum, Rex Omnipotentis Olympi,
Praemia dans justis, scelerum certissime vindex,
Tuque DEI soboles, Patris Immortalis Imago,
Aequalisque DEUS, qui crimina nostra piasti,
Tuque sacrum Flamen, divini pignus amoris,
Foederis Arrha novi, Consolatorque piorum,
Sancta Trias, Veneranda Trias, DEUS vnus and idem,
Per fas, perque bonum, per foedera sancta precamur,
Promissamque fidem, per viscera tensa supremi
Regis, and immiti laniatum stipite corpus,
Suscipite hanc animam, vestroque inducite Coelo.
Non Coridon Coridon, non te fata improba nobis
Eripiunt, falluntque preces and inania vota.

Codr. Iamque vale, semperque vale, Dignissime Pastor,
Nam ruit, and tristi inficiens ferrugine Coelum
Horrida nox, densis involvit cuncta tenebris.
Et saturos ad castra gregres, tutosque recessus
Iam revocare monet, validisque obducere claustris.
Custodesque canes vigili superaddere curae.
Unde procul rabiem, teneraeque inhiantia praedae
Guttura despiciant; placidissima gaudia somni
Agniculi carpant, and loeta pace quiescant.
Non Coridon Coridon, non te fata improba nobis
Eripiunt; falluntque preces, and inania vota.

Est Sacer hic mystae Tumulus, venerabilis vrna,
Quam tegit; augustus, quem capit vrna, cinis.
Men's vivo sincera fuit, vox enthea, pectus

Ingenii vis acris erat, facundia mellis

Exemplar reliqui sobrietatis habent.
Omnibus acceptum fecit contemptus honorum,
Et sibi commissi cura paterna gregis.
Nullius in parts secedens, juris and aequi

Nata simul pietas, and pax fuit, vtraque virtu^

Occidit hoc ipso quo CHRISTUS tempore, miles

Cui Solomon exemplar erat, qui sacra caducis

Nam cum forte Viro fundus superesset avitus,
PATRICIOque satis vivere more daret:
Tempsit opes, titulosque leves, Pastorque vocari
Maluit, (o Proceres!) atque vocare sacris.
Tanto pavit oves studio, Babylonis vt inde
Terruerit rapidos cum meretrice lupos.
Non sic Inachiae centeno lumine vaccae

Flexanimo quoties hausit ab ore sonos,

Nec tacet illa dies sacro celebranda Lyceo
Qua reditus auxit Palladiumque chorum;
Progeniemque suam Iovis alitis obtulit instar,
Vis cui Phoebaeum sustinuisse jubar:
Non fuerat satis hoc, aris servire parentem,
Art sed and soboles erudienda pari:
Quis Phoebo Phaetonta parem, parilique rotatum
Axe, per Arctoas crederet isse plagas?
Occidit ille tamen! Virtus si nescia fari est,
Non conclamandus quam prius orbis erat.
Occidit! Est ea lex natis adnata, nec vlli
Fit Genitrix, cui non sit Libitina, Venus,
At quae fata negant, Superorum gratia praestat,
Et pompa instaurant funus inoccidua.
Spiritus ipse DEI supremas colligit auras,
Pollinctorque lavat FILIUS ipse DEI.
Iustitiaeque toga praetexit corpora pura,
Curat and efferri sic decorata domo.
Ante triumphata impietas, and Numinis error,
Prostrataeque acies cum duce tartareae.
It comes ambigua coelestis front caterva,

Iamque rogo positum and terrena mole carentem

ERgone ( Dii faveant) sine Rege and Remige, Puppis

Exposita innumeris Palinuro absente periclis?
Dii prohibete nefas: tuque invictissime Nere^

Hos hauri gemitus: has has Pater excipe nostras

Hei miseranda Ratis, queis nunc immersa periclis! Miserabile^^ Academiae
statum sub obitum Cancellarii sub allegoric^ describit.

Quo sine Rege ruis? quae te, quae tarda moratur
Vis Remorae, irati vastum per inane profundi
Tendentem, validisque aptantem Carbasa ventis?
Tene tulit rapidas Fortuna secunda per vndas
Hactenus indemnem? spoliisque beavit opimis
Improbus invicti labor, and pia cura Magistri?
Nuper an aurato radiabat Prora pyropo:
Celsaque Hyperboream tangebant vela Booten?
Nuper an Herculeis Nautae incubuere lacertis,
Dedaleaque vnctos sinuabant art Rudentes?
Transtra per and latebras, imasque in puppe cavernas
Quisque suum curabat opus? faustoque Magistri
Omine, concordi festiva Celeusmata voce
Nautarum exhilarata cohors geminabat? and aere
Aere ciere alios, Martemque accendere cantu?
Quo duce Finitimae non intumuere Carinae,
Sed sua seposito submisit Carbasa fastu
Obvia quaeque Ratis: visuque exterrita tanti
Praesidis, huic nostrae solvebat Sostra Carinae:
Quo duce foelici per tot vada caerula ductu
Vecta Ratis, (currente hilari per Transtra Iuventa)
Spreverat irati stridentia fulmina Coeli,
Spreverat oppositi Technasque minasque Liburni,
Spreverat and rigidi brumalia flamina Cori,
Spreverat vndarumque aestus, Coelique procellas
Diraque caeruleis latitantia monstra sub vndis.

Scilicet hoc quodcunque mali, praesagus in ipso
Viderat ingressu Palinurus, and agmine facto
Ocyus adflictae conscendit transtra Carinae,
Imgemuitque deditque has imo pectore voces:
Adspicis hoc Neptune nefas? Ut tarda moretur
Nescio quae Torpedo Ratem, quam provida primum
Cura ENPHINSTONII vestris commiserat vndis?
Scilicet ille olim Vestras, vesterque Sacerdos
Hoc construxit opus, vestroque dicavit honori:
Qualis Io, tum qualis erat, cum turgida primum
Vela dedit Pelago, placideque e littore solvens,
Tantara caeruleis ter bellica Buccina Divis
Edidit, atque imum sonitu tremefecit Avernum.
Nunc o nunc quantis immergitur ecce perielis;
Cassa Gubernaclo, patulas and hiulca Cavernas,
Orba solo, jactata salo, solique relicta
Ipsa sibi, and diris hominum spoliata rapinis?
Quare age vos vasti domitor Neptune profundi
Confer opem, dum spes superest: faxo omine fausto
Rite Ratis rabidi superet vada caerula Ponti
Si modo magnanimis faveant pia Numin^ caeptis.
Nec mora, Navigium pernix conscendit, and alta
De puppi, ingentem Scelerum speculatur Abyssum
Errorumque immane Chaos: sine Remige pinum
Nutantem, subitaque minantem clade ruinam,
Quique superfuerant somno torpente sepultos
Una omnes: Clavo dextra, Sceptroque sinistra
Arreptis, contendit ovans, puppimque ruentem
Erigit, and mediis sensim protrudit in vndis:
Post-modo letifero obductos captosque veterno
Suscitat, and dictis Nautas affatur amicis:
Sicne jaces moribunda Cohors? Molle^ excute fomnu^,
Ocyus evigila, and velis immitte Rudentes:
Nonne vides vt nunc maria vndique and vndique coelu^?
Nonne vides Helenam, proram puppimque tenentem
Assolet adflictis cladem quae infer Carinis?
Cernis vt immenso distet Terra intervallo,
Humidaque horrisono praeceps ruat Oceano nox!
Utque vndis impulsa, procul de littore puppis
Trudatur ruitura, epotoque ebria Nereo
Fluctuet: and nimio fundum petat aequoris haustu,
Passa trucis Borea rabiem; miserescite vestri
Si qua piis pietas, si qua est vel cura salutis:
Erige te secura cohors: timor omnis abesto:
Ductor erit Palinurus, erit dum spiritus artus
Hos reget, and portum incolumes immittet in ipsum,
Si modo Dii faveant; modo si mihi Castor amicam
Porgat opem Polluxque, aliis dabo carbasa ventis,
Regalemque Ratem propria statione reponam.

Ista eqnidem nos ista latent: nisi quod Pater olim

Scilicet hoc Palinure tuum sanctumque piumque
Primum opus, haec sacri fuerant primordia cultus:
Ter foelix purae qui relligionis Asylum

Interea incoeptis perstat foelicibus Heroes;

Caerula cui meritam plectit Galatea corollam
Ex hedera, lauruque, and purpureis hyacinthis:
Perfer, and incaeptum placide sic perfice pensum

Exhilaratque aegras dulci modula mine mentes:
Dat quartum, qui vel Cythara, vel voce canora
Concitet harmonicis coelestia Numina Rythmis:
Ilicet hic ille est redivivus Thracius Orpheus,
Carmine qui fluvios; vel Methymnaeus Arion,
Qui plectro mediis Delphinum flectere in vndis
Assolet: hic primus princepsque Choraula Carinae est
Coelica dulcisono celebrat qui Numina cantu.
D. Ioanni Lundaeo, amoeniorum literarum Professori annuos reditus reducit
Praesul. Per minores s^tios, quatuor Regentes in artibus subinnuit, quos quidem
singulos* Professores reddidit Praesul ad maximu^ Academia commodum.
Instat ovans: and opus solito dux perficit ausu,
Addit opes, and opem reliquis: validique Led^ni

Sacrilego quondam Glaucus quae vendidit astu
(Sollicito Gnaeti toties repetita rogatu)
Addit, and his propriam ditat, decoratque Carinam.
Quin etiam emerito Veteranos donat honor
Quotquot erant, Pileoque caput pelagique Corollis
Apparat, aequorea circundans Tempora vitta.
Haec Pater, haec nostrae, dum vixit, co^moda puppi,
Hanc requiem, hos reditus, hunc detulit vnus honore^:
Haec sunt haectanti monumenta aeterna laboris,
Gestaque magnanimi nunquam interitura Magistri.
Caetera non memero, immensa ne pagina mole
Turgeat, and nimio excrescat lasciva tumore.
Qui nunc qui vitreis aeternum obdormit in vndis
Torpidus, and saevi concussus arundine Lethi
Deserit humanae pereuntia gaudia vitae,
Et vasto immersos lachrymarum gurgite Nautas:
Spernit aquas, puppimque, and hyperboreos reboatus
Oceani, rumpitque moras, clavoque relicto,
Dulcia perpetuae meditatur gaudia vitae.

Ibimus vna omnes: capiet mora nulla sequentes:
Sit satis o, Natum, te solo Patre minorem
Nuper vicinae transisse in transtra Carinae
Aonidum imperio: quem non virtutis egentem
Abstulit oppositi dira inclementia fati:
Credimus haec miseri? Quo nunc quo nostra Carina
Tendet? Et emensi quae spes superesse laboris
Ulla potest? Hei nulla: vicis miserescito nostrae
Die Pater (si quis sensus:) reminiscere pacti
Foederis, and spretae moriens miserere Iuventae,
Quae peracerba sui recolit dum fata Magistri
Caeruleum per inane, exlexque exrexque pererrat,
Contristans querulo Pomonia marmora planctu:
Haud aliter, quam multifidis cum piscis in vndis
Qui labyrinthaeis obseptus retibus, illac

Hacque miser fugitans, per mill foramina, dulci
Tentat abire fuga, sed dum tamen omnia tentat,
Ducitur, and viridi vitam deponit in herba.
Heu pietas! quam nulla homini est sincera voluptas!
Querelae ad mortem Praesulis.
Nec bonitas, nec te potuit tua plurima Virtus
Incolumem servare tuis? nil vota piorum,
Nil castae valuere preces, gemitusque profusi?
Quin tecum nobis bona tot, bona tanta perirent?
Quid prius heic, quid posterius, quid denique dicam?
Quid, taceam, attonitusve querar? Crudelia dicam
Numina? Crudeles Parcas? Crudelia Coeli
Sidera? Crudeles parcas, crudelia dicam
Singula, quae tantum voluere extinguere lumen.
Ecqua soli facies? quid non lachrymabile restat?
Quid fletu vacuum? quis enim quis ferreus vdis
Temperet a Lachrymis? quis acerbo froena dolori
Injiciat, tanti truculenta in morte Magistri?
Adspicis vt ferrugineo velatus amictu
Tristior Eois Phoebus consurgat ab vndis? Miserabi^^ ^erum facies in morte
Praesulis.

Adspicis horrendis vt circumfusa tenebris
Moesta subobscuris Phoebe caput occulat vmbris
Pullatis invecta rotis? Utque anxia Coeli
Sidera, sollicito renuent sua lumina mundo?
Cernis vt oppositis carmen Lachrymabile ventis
Accinat indignis Pallas comitata Camoenis?
Utque Athamantaeo jampridem percitus oestro
Spumea arenoso Nereus ciet aequora fundo,
Adverso adversas conturbans vortice moles?
Adspicis vt nimio rumpantur Saxa boatu,
Horridaque indignas repetant vt monstra Cavernas?
Utque ad Hyperboreum torpens Balena Booten
Horrida continuo convolvat pectora planctu*
Epotas patulis efflans e naribus vndas?
Adspicis vt tremulis mortem prognosticet alis
Halcyonum lachrymosa cohors, vtque agmine facto
Imbrem, Hyememque ferant mundo, tristem que ruinam?
Utque impulsa gravi rerum Nattura dolor
Visa sit immensi reserare repagula Mundi?
Indigites salvete Vmbrae: Alloquitur pios Praesulis Manes.

Capripides tantum satyri, Faunique colebant,
Monstraque Pierio perniciosa Choro.
Antraque torpebant (fugeres penetralia somni)
Intus and informis squallor and horror erant.
Atria deformi squallebant turpia musco,
Et delubra DEVM, limina, Claustra, fores:
Unguibus and foedae volucres foedata trahebant
Omnia, nec quenquam Flumina laesa movent*
Sacraque portabant manibus direpta Deorum,
Nec quidquam quod non praeda petita fuit
Harpyisque avidis venduntur tecta: domosque

Quos lapis, aut lignum, quos succina Gutta ministrat,

Nayades interea tacit sua fata dolebant,
Usque per indignas imbre cadente genas.
Adspexit DEVS, and famulos miseratus egenos,
Misit opem miseris, FORBESIVMque dedit.

Advenit, huc pariter remeant Artesque, DEVSque,

Somnus abit, fugit and torpor; vigilantia, virtus,
Et labor, and pietas regia tecta tenent.
Thure calent arae passim, vigelesque Ministri
Ante aras Domino Carmina laeta canunt.
Harpyae in Strophadas fugiunt, foedaeque volucres:
Et reduces Musae, quod rapuere, ferunt.
Haec canit errantem Lunam, Solisque labores;

Haec pedibus plaudit, digitis haec tympana pulsat*

Haec decorata comas incedit fronde salicti:
Haec niveo pictam syrmate verrit humum.
Collibus ^aerentes varios legit illa colores:
Digerit haec lectos quot Dea Chloris habet.

Prisca renascuntur, remeant foelicia secla,
Et meliora quidem, si meliora forent.
Venimus ad summum fortunae: hinc vota, precesque

A caulis arcuisse lupos, avidosque leones

Denique, ne, quicquam desit, quod Praesule dignum

Auxit decore pristino*
Hic tibi marcentes catus instauravit honores,
Dudum prope inter mortuos.
Languentesque oculos jussit te attollere, Tequ^

Ergo age, quisquis amas nomen, famamque secundam

QUid BOREA moestum spiras furialibus antris?
Luctificoque sono murmura dira boas?
Insolitumque furens placidi maris aequora turbas?
Fluctibus and tumidis littora nostra quatis?
Vimque parans, doctis gratissima rumpere gestis
Otia; concutiens pectora moesta metu;
Flatibus vndiferis ne augusta Palatia Phoebi,
Sacraque Musarum diruta, lapsa cadant:
Numquid bella movens iterum pro conjuge saevis?
Herculeave dolens pignora caesa manu
Ingemis? Insano and juvat indulgere dolori?
Quaeque levet curas respuis aeger opem?
Iam nec acidalio flagrant mihi corda furore,
Saevave pro actaea conjuge bella paro:
Monstrido mave manu prolem indignatus ademptam
Prorumpo in fremitus, flamiua dira ciens:
Non antiqua queror dispendia; supprimit ista
Quae, mi intus stimulat pectora cura recens;
Nec quaecunque recens dedit hos mihi cura tumultus,
Aerumnis quanquam bis tria lustra premor.
Frendriacae jam parva domus mihi damna videntur,
Et Granti praedas arbitror esse nihil:
Et dictu durum quanquam and miserabile visu,
Gordoni^um fatum men's putat esse leve:
Grandius ecce nefas premit alto corda dolor,
Vixque sui est compos men's agitata malis,
Heu sacros inter Patres celeberrimus vnus
Nuper mitrati gloria magna chori,
Sedis ABREDONIAE decus, and mea summa voluptas
Eripitur gremio (proh dolor) ecce me^.
Quem gens clara animis atque artibus inclyta belli
De se prognatum FORBESIDVM alta domus
Iactat, and inde putat majores surgere lauds
Quam Mart insignes quod tulit ipsa duces:
An magis ipsa dolet tantorum facta virorum
Magna premi vnius laud sepulta viri?
Palladiasque domus, fanum qua Regulus altum
Ostentat populis, hunc tenuisse juvat:
Nobilis and quamvis proavos dimissa per altos
Iugera possedit plurima dives agri,
Non divam Sophiam, sacri aut praeconia verbi
Ortu aut fortunis inferiora putat.
Hinc reducem in Patrias seeds, qui altaria curant
Symmystam exoptant, dat rata vota DEUS.
Virtutum rectrix prudentia cuncta gubernans
Ordine, and ipsa gregem more decente regit.
Clara viri virtus, magnae constantia mentis,
Ingenium vivax eloquiumque potens,
Et niveus morum candor, vultusque severi
Majestas clemens fratribus anteferunt.
Tanta latere diu potuerunt munera? Nunquam:
Privato haec nimium commoda magna gregi.
Regis amor mandat, poscunt hunc publica vota,
Quam non ambibat Praesulis ad Cathedram.
Nescia men's fastus non affectabat honores,
Ast animo invictus munera nulla fugit.
Quae postquam subiit, magno moderamine Clerum
Dirigit imperiis consiliisque fovet.
Exemploque praeit, cuncti vt sua munera praestent,
Attente inspiciens, quod jubet ipse facit.
Hinc inter doctos mystas doctissimus alte
Eminet, inque bonis optimus ipse cluit.
Si quisquam doctae mentis monumenta relegit,
Non Augustini haec inferiora putet.
Dulcius aurifluo haud fundit Chrysostomus ore,
Suavi aut Bernardo mellea verba fluunt.
Ingentes animos cordata que pectora gessit,
Qualia Niliacus Praesul, and Ambrosius.
Quaeque prius sparsim variis clementia Coeli
Cesserat, hic vnus omnia dona tulit.
Praesulis eximii nec tantum Ecclesia sentit
Foelices curas auxiliumque pium,
Sed, tibi quod propius forsan praecordia tangit,
Hunc quoque senserunt docta Lycaea Patrem.
Praeteriti reparat secli dum damna benignus,
Et studiis ardor priscus, honosque redit.
An non dura nimis, nimis heu mihi justa dolendi
Causa datur? Numquid ingemere ipse vetes?
Singultire juvat, moesto suspiria cord
Tollam, nec luctus finiet vlla dies;
Magna tibi BOREA fateor nunc causa doloris
Orbarunt tanto quem fera fata Patre:
At fremitus compesce graves, absiste furori
Luctisico, and lachrymis ponere disce modum:
Nec tibi foelicis fortuna dolenda parentis,
Nec opus est casus ingemere vsque tuos:
Non illum claudunt ferratae limina mortis,
Coelestes animos nec libitina capit:
Spiritus aetherius Patrium remeavit Olympum,
Et fruitur laetus jam propiore DEO:
Atque tibi superest magni stirps maxima Patris,
Qui praesens luctus leniat vsque Tuos.

IN REVERENDI ET SANCTISSIMI PATRIS, PATRICII FORBESII, EPISCOPI ABREDONENSIS*
Et in summo Scotorum Senatu Consiliarii Obirum, EPITAPHIVM.
OCcidit Abredonum Praesul FORBESIVS, ecce
Parva tenet magni nominis vrna virum.
In quem non habet aut livor quod dicere possit,
Quanquam caelicolas misit in arma deas.
Namquefides, pietas, spes, quicquid denique tantum
Aut talem potuit condecorare virum,
Illius in niveo sibi sedem pectore legit:
Pectore Caucasea candidiore nive.
Labe carens vt vita fuit, nullique potestas
Noxia: sic visa est mors properata nimis.
Hunc gemet extinctum cuicunque ecclesia curae est,
Atque in solliciti part doloris erit.
MUSARUM IN DEFUNCTVM LACHRYMAE.

Visere Pierias vult Heliconis aquas.
Solicitansque lyram sic solabatur euntes
Visa sit vt longae non mora longa viae.
Propter aquas tandem viridi consedit in herba,
Et circumfusa est turba canora ducem.
Tunc Phoebus cantate deae queis carmina curae,
Et jam vernantes fallite voce dies.
Incipiunt jussae. C^nit haec, qua Jupiter olim
Laedam fluminea lusit adulter ave.
Illa canit Veneris Martisque nefaria furta,
Et Niobes lachrymas, and Phaetontis equos.
Dumque deae sic facta canunt, sic era mulcent,
Melpomene querulis fletibus ora riga^.
Et jam non potis hunc tantum superare dolorem
Ingemit, and lachrymans talia voce refert.
Occidit ABREDONVM Praesul FORBESIVS, hisque
Vocibus in mediis victa dolor silet.
Ingeminant musae lachrymas, and pectora plangunt,
Tuta nec a digitis ora fuere suis.
Quid vixisse juvat (clamant) quid libera fatis
Vita, quid aeternas proderit esse deas?
Non honor est, sed onus vita haec laesura ferentes:
Solamen miseris est potuisse mori.
Phoebus item querulis lachrymis testatur amorem,
Et penitus fletu vincitur ipse s^o.
Solatur miseras tamen, and Permissidis vnda
Amotis lachrymis, talia dicta dedit.
Scilicet infausto nobis processit Olympo,
Quae tantum terris abstulit hora virum.
Spes superest animosa tamen: nam splendida claris
Ingeniis non est orba relicta domus.
Vivit Natus adhuc, magni spes altera patris,
Solamenque mali vivat and opto diu.
Ponebat moerens ALEXANDER DOWNY, Philosophiae Studiosus.

IN OBITVM Reverendissimi and Charissimi Patris sui (...), PATRICII FORBESII,
EPISCOPI ABREDONIENSIS, etc. CARMEN FUNEBRE IOANNIS FORBESII FILII.
DUlce decus, genitor, vitali suavior aura*
Luminis usura cui mage charus eram:
Dum tua condecorant certatim funera quisquis
Numen amat, virtus and cui clara placet:
Aegra tui desiderio dum pectora tundunt
Pontifices, proceres, plebs, studiosa cohors:
FORBESIAE florem gentis cecidisse queruntur,
(Quo se jactabat sospite nostra domus:)
Regum consilium, magni occubuisse Senatus
Ingenium, Patriae deliciasque suae:
Orbatum Pastore gregem, moderamine mystas:
Fulmineum verbi conticuisse melos:
Instauratori lachrymas Academia pendit;
Singultim tragicis vociferata modis,
Iam Musis Phoebum, studiis jam deesse patronum:
Praesidum templis, pauperibusque patrem:
Pulpita, saepe tuis facundo ex ore sonora
Vocibus, atra gemunt: compita lessus obit:
Flammiferis auras vrbana tonitrua bombis
Accendunt: populi sidera pulsat amor.
Haec autem lamenta inter tot publica nemo est
Qui tibi, sed Patriae quisque sibique dolet:
(Te superis etenim concentibus aurea Coeli
Regia susceptum lucis in arce beat.)
Talia cernenti quae men's mihi? quis potis esse
Sensus? dum robur pectoris, ora, manus,
Doctrinae and morum nectar, pia vota recordor,
Mortemque heroam ceu Patriarcha fores:
Exanimesque oculos digitis componere nostris
Ut mihi, and exequiis solvere justa datum.
Quid moestae superest proli, charisque propinquis?
Quid faciant luctu pectora pressa gravi?
Nempe PATRIS summi praeconia praepete cantu
Vt celebrent, a quo tanta fuere bona.
Qui majora dabit, cum clangor ab aetheris axe
Eruet ex imis ossa sepulta locis;
Restituetque animae Corpus, totusque micabis
Aeternum aeterni Solis ab orb jubar.
Et pariles tentent gressus, quibus itur ad astra.
Haec nos sanctorum fata suprema docent.
Te DEVS ante dedit terris, nunc intulit astris:
Dicant terra, Polus; laus sine fine DEO.
Instabiles sub sole vices fugitivaque rerum
Gaudia: mansuras PATRIA donat opes:
PATRIA Coelestis, fundamine fulta superno
Urbs sancta, aetherii nobilis aula PATRIS.
Foelix cui cursum dat gratia, gloria metam.
Sic mihi contingat vivere, sic moriar.
SONNET.
REaders of sacred Histories attent,
Do find great Names in Monuments inrolde*
Of faithful Pastors, and their Virtues told,
For Praise to GOD, to make men diligent.
Sage Cyrils, Austin in Disputes potent*
Grave Gregory's, meek Melet, Ambrose bold,
Sweet Cyprian, John with his Mouth of Gold,
Star of his age Athanase permanent.
Theodoret in Learning eminent,
Well versde in Scriptures, Jerome, New and Old*
True Flavian, kind Paulin, manifold
Perfections of others excellent.
These graces PATRICK FORBES richly had,
Whereby GOD honored was, the Church made glad.
Upon the death of that Right Honorable, Right Reverend, and most worthy
Prelate, PATRICKE FORBES, Baron of Corse and Oneil, Late Bishop of ABERDENE.
COuld Man's excursiue thoughts get stayed to muse
Some unseen good there is found in baddest newse;
(Fear can beget of wit in selfe-born fools,
Prodigious Warnings train the Wise at Schools)
What Is this of Death we see? so much affecting
Of young of old propriety: thus projecting,
Man's total ruin (Nature being deaths pryse
The Victory ours, we conquering enemies.)
Belyke the shout of SION seems to roar,
Rackt with such grief not once heard of before.
Her Northern-Church imbellisht to our sight,
Was lately placed on top of SIONS hight:
Her Structure which the first Contract had made,
(whill tread-tramd Crafts-men scarce were to be had:
The Master Builder wanting to command,
Awlesse confusion winning th'vpperhand)
Those rude impolisht stones which kept not line,
She lately changed in jewels, gems divyne:
Old rowmes made void: replenisht to content,
Conscience the level of strict Government,
She howls to miss what very now she had:
And to our hearing sadly has she said;
My Mount does smoke, it is shak'd by IOVAH'S Hand,
( Moses and Aron fled) how can it stand?
Moses did watch true Sentinel without it:
Aron Circundat tarrasses about it.
Those being gone, who did so well surround me,
The burning wrath of GOD's near to confound me.
Is It so with SION? is she so dejected,
Who twyse a-yeare our drouping heads erected,
Against purest fears in gleaning Autumns Flowrs,
Against all distrustful hopes of Aesta's showers?
Dare not those green Trees at the axe repyne?
Then rotten stock how neare's that fall of thine?
Since clearest heads are drumled; then be sure
The mudled way-floods can have no thing pure.
Though in few Acts Man could abridge his plays:
In many schens divyded are his days.
Since then we see the Tapers do decay,
(Whent's dark) the candlestick may be a prey.

AARON'S OBSEQVIE.
WHen Titan ryseth from his bed,
He guildes our day, and lends us life:
But when abortiue Night does spread
Her sable mantle, wee're at strife,
Even with our selves, for sleep Deaths friend,
Whiffs in our face, and blows us blind.
When Spring enambles Vesta's lap,
Our Rose is sweet, our Damask's clean:
But if a frost, or thunder clap,
Pursue their buddes, straight what was green,
Is blasted, and their rotten Core,
Infoldes a canker-worme no more.
When Rivers from their private sourse,
Repay their Tribute to the Maine,
The rattling murmures of their course,
Proclaims their debt, and yet in vain,
For there, how soon they hyde their heads,
Their luster's gone, their Douceur fades.
When Brydegroomes from their chambers come,
To wed the Virgin Nymphs of May,
The Violet, and Prymrose bloome,
Len wreaths, and Laurels, to that play.
But if or he or she shall fall,
Their mirth's exchanged to a Madrigall.
So whilst our Aaron's burning Light,
In Vrim and in Thummim shynd,
Our Levits saw their Day, no Night,
For Atho's Shaddows still declynde.
But now in Ramah Aaron sleeps,
And Rachel for her Husband weeps.
So whilst our Aarons Priestlie Rod
Did bud, did blossom, and yield fruit,
Ieshuruns other stemmes abroad,
Proov'd withred sticks, and wanted root:
But now he sleeps, and against his Vine,
And Olive, Brambles now repyne.
So when our Aaron's boundless Ocean,
Lent secret life, to Sacred Springes,
Rephidims Rock by that commotion,
Did drench Vrania's scorched wings:
But whilst his deepes exhawled lie,
Cherith's exhaust, and Kedron's dry.
So whilst our pompous Aaron stood,
To wed the Bryde to her Brydegroome,
The Friends rejoiced, the Virgins bowde,
And both unto the Wedding come:
But now, the PARANYMPH is gone,
And all the marriage Children moan.
What then? have not Air, Earth, and Seas,
Spent tears at ARON'S funeral?
They have: But tears so dround their eyes,
That now their deepest griefs recall
Their sluices: and to times to come,
Say, Light cares speak, when deep grief's dumb.
Mr WILLIAM WISHART, Person of Restarick.

DEDICATED To the Never-dying Memory of The late Right Revend, Learned* and
Religious Prelate, my best Friend, And most worthy Macenas, PATRICKE, BY THE
MERCY OF GOD, BISHOP OF ABERDENE, etc.
WAlking alone, under a shade, near by a River side,
Beholding how swift silent streams into the Sea did slide,
The budding Grove, our youth, streams, times velocitie,
Floods falling in the Sea, declared all living flesh must die.
Whiles thus as in a trance, I viewed the welkin clear,
Unto my eyes and ears, at once od objects did appear.
I heard great tolling Bells, drums toucke, dead trumpets sounded,
Canons loud roaring, made such noise, Earth, Sea, and Air resou^ded.
But that which moved me most, I saw me near hand by,
Great multitudes of mourning men, full sadly seemed to cry:
Some said, Now JACOB'S gone, our PATRIARCH who bred us.
Some lik Aegiptia^s mourning, cried, Our Ioseph's faild, who fed us:
Some for myld Moses moand, eve^ those who most did grieve him;
Praying, if possibe it were, their vows might now revive him.
Some for their DAVID dool'd, most for the Temple great:
Some for JOSIAS shouted in the Valley of Iosaphat.
Their doole redoubled so, their cries became confusde,
That Natures works all round about was stupefied, and musde.
The tallest trembling Trees, whose stately tops vpryse,
And seemed through watrie voults of air, to cut the crystal Skies,
Did lowre and lout them low, as witness of those wrongs;
Elf-Echoe out of hollow Caves, resounds their sorrowing songs.
The Clouds did cease to drop, the wavering winds to blow;
The boughs on banks left off to bloome, the Seas to fall or flow:
The sweetest stirring streams, that run in DEE and DONE,
Shout to their equals, Stay your pace, and help us two to moan.
The birds with chirming cheer, that cut the azure Skies,
They cease to sing, the beasts to low, the fish to swim in Seas:
The Sun and Moon amazed, and Stars, all still they stand,
And all JOVE'S hudge and curious work, the sea, the air, the land,
Left off their kindly course, and cared with me to ken,
About a Tomb what moved to mourn so many modest men.
Thus whilst aghast we gazed, three out amongst the laue,
In doricke numbers sadly sounds these Songs about his Grave.
1. SONG.
Sweet Sheepherds Swanes, awake and weep,
Since he is gone, who made you sleep:
We want our gracious Governor,
Who watched us both in Field and Tower.
Now may we stray without a Guide;
In earth there is none such beside.
Great pains He took, to make us keep,
To feed, to fence, our wandering Sheep*
All our defects He cured and covered,
Which Dogs and Wolfes would have discovered.
And now, no doubt, we will go astray,
Since we Him want who led our way.
The crasde and creeple often He healed them;
The comfortless He never failde them.
Our EAGLE who us taught to fly;
Our PELICAN, our PHOENIX, hie;
Great IOVA Grant, since He is gone,
His ashes breed us such a One.
2. SONG.
Our Church has lost a Light, our State may now bemoane;
Our Commonwealth, her Atlas wants, Relligion a son,
His blood amongst the best, as borne so was He bred,
But what were those, if grace divine, had not Dame Nature clad?
If Learning joined with Wit, if Grace with Gravitie;
If prudent carriage be in price, if matchless Modesty,
Then, in a word, I vow, if Virtue lodged below,
He was the worthiest wight for one, my self did ever know:
Full forty years and five, his course of life I kende*
O let me live his holy life, and make his happy end.
3. SONG.
ST^rne Death, now do thy best or worst, and spare not;
For thee and all thy dreadful Darts I care not.
I stand not for thy fead, or friendship either,
Short since thou slew my Son, and now my Father,
And tho my self thou kill, thou wilt not devour me:
I hope to follow them who went before me.
Tho for a space thou soul and body sever,
In spyte of thee this Saint shall live for ever.
Whiles he was here, Nature and Grace contended;
Whose he should be, they both their forces bended.
His virtues live, and shall, do what thou may:
To his great glore, shall after Ages say,
Lo here entombed, this marble stone lies under,
Wits high Perfection, and our Ages wonder.
Mr THOMAS MICHELL, Person of Turreff.

Sacrat, To the Immortal Memory of that Reverend Father in GOD, PATRICKE
FORBES, By the Mercy of GOD, Bishop of Aberdene, Lord of his Majesty's Secret
Counsel, Chanceller and Restorer of the Universitie, Lord of Corse, and Baron
of Oneill.
Like as in May, the country Sheep-herdling,
Pulling the painted Beauties of the Spring,
Doubts with her self, whether to make her chose,
The Pansey, Lilly, Violet, or Rose;
The yealow, red; the purple, green, the blew*
Or thousand-thousands of some other hew:
Even so my Muse, when as her self she rayses,
And bends her self to point our Prelates Praises:
This Field such rare things offers to her view,
That mute she stands, and bids her Task Adieu,
His various Virtues muster in such store,
Abundance straynes her more, than Want before.
For neither Zeuxes, nor Apolles can
Paynt the perfections of so rare a Man.
His Majesty, his Port, his Court, his Grace,
Did lively portray forth his Worth, his Race.
As his Grandfathers, in our Civil Wars,
Were foremost: foremost eke in settling Iarres:
So he in both did beautify his Clan,
Foremost in Peace, in War a valiant Man.
As for his truth, in whyt let it be painted,
Which never time with spot or stayne once taynted,
His love to Learning, his delight in Arts,
Quickened the vigor of his natural parts.
Both humane things, and heavenly things, he knew:
All things were subject to his Soul her view.
Like as an other Prelate said of late;
He knew not what it could be to forget:
Even so from him was hid nothing at all,
Betwixt the moving and th'vnmoving Ball.
This knowledge of the things created, moved him
To love their Maker so (who so had loved him)
That ravished with His love, he preached His Name,
To his own Servants, much like Abraham:
Not like these Barons, whose commodity,
Makes up their own, their servants piety:
Who sheare their Flocks, who slay them: but to feed them,
Who scorn, who care not how their Pastors lead them,
To come, and hear his wisdom, me^ did strive,
Like Bees contesting for their honey hyue.
His House a College was of Piety,
A Compend of an Universitie:
Where sweet Ambrosia filde, and never cloyed,
And blessed all those, that this sweet food enjoyed.
Where who were given to virtuous contemplation,
Did find a world of happy contentation.
Whence sprung that spark (which now succeeds his Sire)
The brighest la^pe within the Scots Empire.
Such Virtue, Worth, such Wit, such Piety,
Made Court and Church his Suitors both to be.
For Court and Church admiring both his fame,
The Court his counsel craved; the Church the same.
Thus he who ruled his own House so of late,
Did rule his Lords, in the Cathedral Seat.
And who of late, gave counsel in small things,
Became the Counsels Counsel, Light of Kings.
The absence of this shyning Light has made
All faithful Workers in Christ's Vineyard sad:
And makes them all with watrie Eyes to pray,
That such a Light dispell their Clouds away.
The absence of this Light (as one reported,
A faithful man, who then in Court resorted)
Did move our Soveraygne so, that often he said,
I know no Worthy, worthy to succeed.
Through absence of this shyning Light, we see
Th'eclipses of this Universitie.
Her Sunne's gone down, and darkened is her Day,
Come Phosphor, come, come drive her clouds away.
Thus shortly with my country Sheep-herdling,
I pulled have some Beauties of the Spring:
But while I look upon the Ground alone,
Pulling this hour, me thinks I pulled none.
The Field's replenisht, as it was before,
And fragrant Odours wax aye more and more.

Who departed this present life upon the 28 of March, 1635. EPITAPH.
I.
Shiloah swim,
And dip in Dew Divine your candid Quills;
Which Great JEHOVAH, EL, and ELOHIM,
In Silver Showrs, and Lectean Streams, distills,
From Sacred Sion, and from Hermon Hills,
Lend me some lurid Lines, and woeful Verse,
To honor this most Honour-worthies Hearse.
Whose Concaue keeps, enclosed, and confynd,
The mortal Moold of a most matchless Man:
The Manor late of his immortal Mind,
With all great gifts, and Graces, garnisht then,
Now in a Sege Celestial inshrynd:
Whose wondrous Worthiness so plain appeared*
That Wisdom wondered, and the World admired.
What Part perexcellent did any Sperit,
Of his Condition, Quality, and Case,
Possess, express, here practice, and inherit,
But that this Great DIVINE, with wondrous Grace,
And Pow'r-perswading, proov'd in every Place*
Most evidentlie, exquisite, and wise;
Unparalleled here PRELATE PATRICK lies.
II.
OUr holy HELIE is inhumed here;
A pious Prelate, prudent, sans a Piere:
So soundly sage, so solid, and sublime,
That Pens unpolished never shall exprime,
So wyselie wise, wrought with the Word Divine,
That Faculties profound can not define.
Perfectly polisht in the precious parts,
Of all the humane, and the heavenly Arts;
That perfect did (if that Perfection can
Here be immured) in a mortal Man:
Who proov'd a Pattern to the Pastors all,
Conformlie that before the Altar fall,
And do divinelie worship (as the Word
Clearlie commands) the Ever-living LORD,
His Sentences so sage, so sweet, and calm,
Flowed from him flowantlie, like Floods of Balm.
His Proaves and his Pedigree, I pass,
That honorable, and ever worthy was.
Yet unto them, and unto all this Land,
His Life lent Light, and as a Star did stand*
Praeshyning still, and with so solemn Show,
That all the World his Christian carriage know.
Unto the poynct and period wherein
His Soul ascended from this Sink of Sin:
While softly breathing, from his Breast, his Breath,
He sleeped sweetly, as disdayning Death:
And with us left an Ever-living Fame;
A notable Renown, and Noble Name.
III.

And He the day before his course did close,
(To Attend the triumph of that Glorious Day,
That all the Righteous should remember aye)
His Soul ascending boue the crystal Coome,
While that its Relics in this terren Tomb
Here lies, it there, aye Haheluiah singes,
To magnify the Mighty KING of Kings;
And prostrate low, before the Mercies Throne,
Duly adores the TRINITIE-TRINE-ONE:
Enjoying, justified, the rich Reward,
To all the Pious promisd, and prepared.
A Guerdon Great, past Compass, and Compare,
For their blessed Works, that follow them up there;
Where Peace and Pleasure have no period,
But endless are, as th'Ever-living GOD:
And where with Heave^ly Hoasts of holy Saints,
He ever and ever there Haleluja chants.
Mr AL. GARDEN, ADVOCATE.

Upon the much-lamented death of the most Reverend Father in CHRIST, BISHOP
PATRICKE, Late Lord Bishop of ABERDENE, etc. EPITAPH.
WIthin this Casket is inshrynd,
Who now triumphs over Death's Assyze:
In whom, with Skill, Grace was combynde,
To make a Praelate of rich pryze.
A faithful Steward he was still,
Who sterved none through want of Food:
Dispensing all his Masters will,
Rejoicing in the peoples good.
In Church, or Civill-Policie,
Few could to him be parallel:
Day Star he was of the Clergy;
Nay, Pillar of the Common-weall.
Wealth was not his Petition;
With gift of Heritage content:
Honor, without Ambition,
His worth procured, and good Descent.
And, to be short, he nothing wanted,
To make him Mirror of this Age:
This truth by all men must be granted,
Few so victorious left the Stage.
Which makes us act, in mourning Verse,
Sad Interludes, now over his Hearse.
ANOTHER.

A witty Statesman, or without oppression
One bearing rule: nay, careless in conceat
Of Coin, to see a Churchman by Profession.
Lo, here entombed then does a Phoenix lie,
Who lived all three, and did unspotted dye.
Mr JAMES GORDON, Then Student, New Minister of GOD'S Word, at Kearne.

EPITAPH Upon the death of PATRICK FORBES Late Bishop of Aberdene.
OF all this All, the Universal frame,
The Beauty, BRITANE is, and ABERDENE:
Gives both a Grace, and Grandour to the same,
For all is singular that there is seen:
But eminent above these all is One,
The chief and highest honor of that Town,
Late Praelate PATRICK, glory of the Gown
BRITANE this All, and He graced ABERDONE,
And was an Ornament to all alone.
MISAKMOS Mr JAMES KEYTH.

A THRENODIE, Upon the Lamentable, and ever to be deplored death, of the most
Reverend Father in CHRIST, PATRICKE, Late Bishop of Aberdene, One of the Lords
of Privy Counsel, and Right Honorable Lord of Corse, and Baron of Oneill.

And all that followed these, and do not pry,
In these transplendent rays, of Virtues light,
Which looking to, may thee bereave of sight:
But in thy passing by, take once a glance,
And make that glance, his praises to advance.
First in his birth, which is but least of all,
But great indeed: but here to mind I call,
His vert'ous life, by all so still renowned,
That with it, as a Garland, Birth was crowned.
His godly life, with glistring Wings of Fame,
Does to all ages eternize his Name.
As in his mortal life, to CHRIST he lived,
So now with CHRIST, and unto CHRIST he died.
We do our Neighbor miss, but his has found,
CORNELIUS, we cause for to resound:
The hills and dales with sorrow, he with joy:
We for our Sheepherds loss, not he, for why?
His Sheepherd he has found, he now is crowned,
Which fills his heart with joy, makes ours to sound
With grief, away from us to PAUL has gone
Our TIMOTHY, his precepts every one
How he has kept to show, which makes our heart,
With joy, with grief, for him to burst, to smart
For us. Ah, ABERDENE! Ah ABERDONE!
Thy Light's eclyps'd, from thee thy joy is gone.
My Muse would speak, but it does blush for shame,
Not being worthy to sound out His Fame.
Mr ALEXANDER WHYT, Student in Divinity.

ON THE DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONORABLE AND REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, PATRICK
FORBES BISHOP OF ABERDENE.
WE need not be lugubrious,

Who now from us away is reft,
Unto that heavenly Throne.
For now he wears the Diadem
Of Glory Immortal;
For his good works in Heaven shine,
Like Stars celestial.
But to the LORD Omnipotent,
Who him has princely crowned,
Let us give thanks, and eke His praise,
With heart and voice resound.
A rarer Man could not be found,
As this, on earth to dwell:
For he in Virtues all, but most
In WISDOM did excel.
His vertuousnesse for to express,
It is but all in vain;
Because to all are manifest,
His Virtues without stayne.
A Godlier could not be found,
All mortal men among;
Who for his good and godly life,
Unto the Heavens is gone.
JOHN IOHNSTON, Student in Philosophy, In the King's College of Aberdene.

Raban's Regrate, For the present loss of his very good Lord, Patron, and
Master, PATRICK FORBES, Bishop of Aberdene, Baron of Corse and Oneill: Who,
most Peaceably and Godly, departed hence, to a Better life, upon Easter-Even,
about 3 aclocke in the morning; at his Palace in Old Aberdene, adjacent to
the Cathedral Church; in the 71 year of his Honorable Age, and the 17 year
of his Godly Governament. March 28. Anno 1635.
Behold! Alace! Here lies ONE,

A Learned Patron, Wise, and Grave.
A Consul good. What would you have?
Chief Orator of Scotlands North.
The World can not afford his VVorth.
A Prelate, and a Pastor good;
Who, in due time, gave Heavenly Food,
At Morn, at Noone, and Evening tide,
Unto His Flock, sweet JESUS Bryde.
The Poor, with Meat, He fed also,
None hungry from His House did go.
A CROSS into His Badge He bore,
And followed CHRIST, who went before,
But half a day, for to prepare
For CORSE, with HIM, an Heavenly Share.
Then, Death! Where is thy Sting? Let see.
And, grave! Where is thy Victory?
Your Honor in the Dust is spread:
PATRICRE now reygnes with CHRIST, His Head.
Death's but a Passage, to convoy
Such Sayncts into their Master's Joy.
The LORD prepare us, less, and more,
To follow Him: He Is gone before.
Good Sirs, I am bihind the rest,
I do confess, for want of Skill:
But not a whit behind the best,
To show the affection of good Will.
EDWARD RABAN, Master Printer, The first in Aberdene.
