EDINBVRGH ^^NTED BE ROBERT ^HARTERIS. 1603.

Ane godly Dream compylit in Scottish Meter be M. M. Gentelwoman in Culros, at
the requeist of her friends.
Upon ane day as I did mourn fall soir.
With sindrie things quhairwith my saull was gretlie
My grief mcreasit and grew moir and moir
My comfort fled and could not be releifit,
With heaviness my heart was sa mischeifit,
I loath it my life, I could not eit nor drink,
I micht not speik nor luik to nane that letfit,
Bot musit alone and diverse things did think.
The wretchit world did sa molest my mind,
I thocht upon this false and Iron age.
And how our hearts war sa to vice inclynde,
That Satan seimit may feirfullie to rage.
Nathing in earth my sorrow could assuage,
I felt my sin may stranglie to incres,
I greifit my Spreit that wont to be my pledge*
My saull was drownit into may deip distres
All merynes did aggrauate my pain,
And earthly joys did still incres my woe:
In compante I na ways could remain,
Bot fled resort and so alone did go.
My silly saull was tostit to and fro,
With sindrie thochts quhilk troublit me full soire
I preisit to pray, bot sichs ouerset me so,
I could do nocht bot sich and say no moir*
The twinkling (...)
My heart was easit quhen I had mournit my fill:
Than I b^gan my lamentatioun,
And said, O Lord, how lang is it thy will,
That thy puir Sancis sall be afflictit still?
Allace, how lang sall subtle Satan rage?
Make haist O Lord, thy promeis to fulfill,
Make haist to end our painful pilgraumge.
Thy silly Sancts ar tostit to and fro,
Awalk, O Lord, quhy sleipest thou sa lang?
We have na strenth agains our cruel fo,
In sichs and sobbis now chaingit is our sang.
The world preuails, our enemies ar strange,
The wickit rage, bot we ar puir and voaik:
O shaw thy self, with speid revenge our wrang,
Make short their days, even for thy chosens saik.
Lord Jesus cum and saif thy awin Elect,
For Satan seiks our sunpill saul's to slay:
The wickit world dois strainglie us infect,
Most monsterous sins increasses day be day.
Our luif grows called, our zeill is worn away,
Our faith is faillit, and we are like to fall:
The Lion roares to catch us as his pray,
Make haist, O Lord, befoir we perish all.
Their ar the days that thou sa lang foretald,
Sold cum befoir this wretchit world sold end
Now vice abounds and charity grows called,
And euin thine own most strongly dois offend.
The Devil preuaillis, his forces he dois bend,
Gifit could be to wraik thy children deir:
Bot we ar thine, thairfoir sum succor send,
Resaue our saullis, we irk to wander heir.
Quhat (...) cloggit ar with sin,
In filthy vice our sensles saules ar drownit:
Thocht we resolve we neuir can begin,
To mend our lyfes, bot sin dois still abound.
Quhen will thou cum? quhen sall thy trumpet sound?
Quhen sall we sie that grit and glorious day?
O save us Lord, out of this pit profound,
And reif us from this loathsum lump of clay.
Thou knawis our hearts, thou sies our hail desire,
Our secret thochts they are not hid fra thee:
Thocht we offend thou knawis we stranglie tire,
To beir this wecht our spreit wald feign be free.
Allace, O Lord, quhat pleasour can it be,
To leif in sin that sair dois press us down:
Oh, give us wings that we aloft may fly,
And end the fecht that we may weir the crown.
Befoir the Lord quhen I had thus complainit,
My mind grew calm, my heart was at great rest*
Thocht I was faint from fuid yet I refrainit,
And went to bed, because I thocht it best.
With heaviness my spreit was sa oppressed,
I fell on sleip, and sa again me thocht
I maid my moan, and than my grief increst,
And from the Lord with tears I succor socht.
Lord Jesus cum (said I) and end my grief.
My spreit is vexit, the captive wald be fry:
All vice abounds, O send us sum releif,
I loath to live, I wish desoluit to be.
My spreit dois lang and thristeth after thee,
As thristie ground requyris ane shoure of rain*
My heart is dry, as fruitles barren tree
I feill my self, how can I heir remain*
^
Into my dream I thocht their did appeir:
Ane sicht may sweit, quhilk maid me well content,
Ane Angel bricht with visage schyning cleir,
With luifing luiks and with ane smyling cheir:
He askit me, quhy art thou thus sa sad?
Quhy groans thou so? quhat dois thou duyning heir
With cairfull cries in this thy bailfull bed?
I heir thy sichs, I sie thy twinkling tears,
Thou seimes to be in sum perplexity:
Quhat means thy mones? quhat is the thing thou fears
Quhom wald thou have? in quhat place wald you be
Fainte not sa fast in thy adversity,
Mourn not sa sair, sen mourning may not mend:
Lift up thy heart, declair thy grief to me,
Perchance thy pain brings pleasure in the end.
I sicht again, and said allace for woe,
My grief is greit, I can it not declair:
Into this earth I wander to and fro,
Ane pilgrim puir consumit with siching sair.
My sins allace, increasses mair and mair,
I loath my life, I irk to wander heir:
I long for Heaven, my heritage is their,
I long to live with my Redimer deir
Is this the cause (said he) rise up anon,
And follow me and I sall be thy gydt:
And from thy sichs leif off thy heavy moan,
Refrain from tears and cast thy cair aside,
Trust in my strenth, and in my word confyde,
And thou sall have thy heavy hearts desire:
Rise up with speid, I may not lang abide,
Greit diligence this matter dois require.
My Saull rejoysit to heir his words sa sweit,
I luikit up and saw his face may fair:
His countenance reuiuit my weary Spreit,
Incontinent I cuist aside my cair.
With humbill heart I prayit him to declair
Quhat was his name? he answerit me again,
I am thy God for quhom thou sicht sa sair,
I now am cummit: thy tears are not in vain,
I am the way, I am the treuth and life.
I am thy spous that brings thee store of grace*
I am thy luif quhom thou wald feign embrace,
I am thy joy, I am thy rest and peace.
R^se up anon and follow after me,
I sall the leid into thy dwelling place:
The Land of rest thou langs sa sair to sie
I am thy Lord that sone sall end thy race.
With joyful beart I thankit him again,
Reddie am I (said I) and weill content
To follow thee, for heir I leiue in pain,
O wretch vnworth, my days ar vainlie spent.
Nocht ane is just bot all ar fearcelie bent,
To rin to vice, I have na force to stand:
My sins increase quhilk maks me sair lament,
Make haist, O Lord, I lang to sie that Land.
Thy haist is greit, he answerit me again,
Thou thinks thee their, thou art transportit so:
That pleasant place most purchaist be with pain,
The way is strait, and thou hes far to go.
Art thou content to wander to and fro,
Throw greit deserts throw water and throw fire*
Throw thorns and breirs and money dangers mo,
Quhat says thou now? Thy febill flesh will ty^e*
Allace said I, howbeit my flesh be walk,
My spreit is strange and willing for to fly:
O leif me nocht, bot for thy mercies saik,
Perform thy word, or else for duill I die.
I feir no pain, sense I sold walk with thee,
The way is lang, it bring me throw at last:
Thou answeirs weill, I am content said he,
To be thy guide, bot sie thou grip me fast.
Than up I raise and maid na mair delay,
My febill arm about his arm I cast:
He went befoir and still did guide the way,
Thocht I was waik, my spreit did follow fast.
Throw mos and myres, throw ditches deip we past,
Throw pricking thorns, throw water and throw fire:
Throw dreidfull dens quhilk maid my heart aghast,
He buir me up quhen I begouth to tire.
Sumtyme we clam on craigie Montanes hie,
And sumtymes slaid on ugly brayes of sand:
They war sa stay that wonder was to sie,
Bot quhen I feirit he held me be the hand.
Throw thick and thin, throw sea and eik be land,
Throw greit deserts we wanderit on our way:
Quhen I was walk and had no force to stand,
it with ane luik he did refresh me ay.
Throw waters greit we war compellit to weyd,
Quhilk warsa deip that I was like to drown:
Sumtyme I sank, bot it my gracious gyde,
Did draw me out half deid and in ane sown.
In wods may wyld and far fra any town,
We thristit throw, the breirs together stak:
I was sa waik their strenth did ding me down,
That I was forcit for feir to fly aback.
Curage said he, thou art mid gait and mair,
Thou may not tire nor turn aback again:
Hald fast thy grip, on me cast all thy cair,
Assay thy strenth, thou sall not fecht in vain,
I tauld thee first, that thou sold suffer pain,
The neirer heaven, the harder is the way:
Lift vy thy heart and let thy hope remain,
Sense I am guide thou sall not go astray.
Fordwart we past on narow brigs of try,
Over waters greit that hiddeouslie did roir:
Their lay belaw that feirfull was to sie,
May ugly beists, that gaipit to deuoir.
My heid grew licht and troublit wondrous foir,
My heart did feir, my feit began to slide?
Bot quhan I cryit, he heard me ever moir,
And held me up, O blissit be my guide.
Weary I was, and thocht to sit at rest,
Bot he said na: thou may not sit nor stand,
Hald on thy course and thou sall find it best,
Gif thou desyris to sie that pleasant Land.
Thocht I was waik, I raise at his command,
And held him fast: at lenth he leit me sie
That pleasant place, quhilk semit to be at hand,
Tak curage now, for thou art neir, said he.
I luikit up unto that Castle fair,
Glistring like gold, and schyning silver bricht:
The staitlie towers did mount above the air,
They blindit me, they cuist sa greit ane licht.
My heart was glaid to sie that joyful sicht,
My voyage than I thocht was not in vain.
I him besocht to guide me their aricht,
With many vows never to tire again,
Tocht thou ve neir, the way is wondrous hard,
Said he again, thairfoir thou mon be stout,
Fainte not for feir, for cowarts ar debard,
That hes na heart to go their voyage out.
Pluck up thy heart and grip me fast about,
Out throw on trance together we man go:
Gif this war past, we have not many mo.
I held him fast, as he did gif commund,
And throw that trance together than we went:
Quhairin the middis grit pricks of Iron did stand,
Quhairwith my feit was all betorne and rent.
Tak curage now said he, and be content,
To suffer this: the pleasour cuins at last:
I answerit nocht, bot ran incontinent,
Out over them all, and so the pain was past.
Quhen this was done my heart did dance for joy,
I was sa neir, I thocht my voyage endit:
I ran befoir, and socht not his conuoy,
Nor speirit the way, because I thocht I kend if:
On staitlie steps may stoutly I ascendit,
Without his help I thocht to enter their:
He followit fast and was richt sair offendit,
And haistelie did draw me down the stair,
Quhat haist said he, quhy ran thou so befoir?
Without my help, thinks thou to clim sa hie?
Cum down again, thou it mon suffer moir,
Gif thou desires that dwelling place to sie:
This staitlie stair it is not maid for thee,
Hald thou that course, thou sall be thrust aback:
Allace said I, lang wandering weiriet me,
Quhilk maid me rin the neirest way to tak.
Than he began to comfort me again,
And said my friend thou mon not enter their:
Lift up thy heart, thou it mon suffer pain,
The last assault perforce it mon be sair.
This godly way althocht it seime sa fair,
It is to hie thou cannot clim so stay:
Bot luik belaw beneath that staitlie stair,
And thou sall sie ane other kind of way.
I luikit down and saw ane pit most black,
Most full of smuke and flaming fire most fell:
That ugly sicht maid me to fly aback,
I feirit to heir so many shout and ell:
I him besocht that he the treuth wald tell,
Is this said I, the Papists purging place?
Quhair they affirm that silly saulles do dwell,
To purge their sin, befoir they rest in peace?
The brain of man may warlie did invent
That Purging place, he answerit me again:
For gredines together they consent,
To say that saulles in torment mon remain,
Till gold and gudes releif them of their pain,
O spytfull spreits that did the same begin:
O blindit beists our thochts ar all in vain,
My blude alone did saif thy saull from sin.
This Pit is Hell, quhairthrow thou now mon go.
Their is thy way that leids the to the land:
Now play the man thou neids not trimbill so,
For I sall help and hald thee be the hand.
Allace said I, I have na force to stand,
For feir I faint to sie that ugly sicht?
How con I cum among that bailfull hand,
Oh help me now, I have na force nor mucht.
Often have I heard, that they that (...)
In this greit golfe, sall never cum again:
Curage said he, have I not bocht thee deir,
My precious blude it was nocht shed in vain.
I saw this place, my saull did taist this pain,
Or ever I went into my fathers gloir:
Throw mon thou go, bot thou sall not remain,
Thou neids not feir, for I sall go befoit.
I am content to do thy haill command,
Said I again, and did him fast embrace:
Then lovingly he held me be the hand,
And in we went into that feirfull place.
Hald fast thy grip said he, in any care,
Let me not slip, quhat ever thou sall sie:
Dreid not the deith, bot stoutly forwart preis,
For Deith nor Hell sall never vanquish thee.
His words sa sweit did cheir my heavy hairt,
Incontinent I cuist my cair aside:
Curage said hee-play not ane cowarts pairt,
Thocht thou be waik, it in my strenth confyde.
I thocht me blist to have sa good ane guide,
Thocht I was waik, I knew that he was strange:
Under his wings I thocht me for to hyde,
Gif any their fould preis to do me wrang.
Into that Pit quhen I did enter in,
I saw ane sicht, quhilk maid my heart aghast:
Puir damnit saullis, tormentit sair for sin,
In flaming fire, war frying wouder fast:
And ugly spreits, and as we thocht them past,
My heart grew faint, and I begouth to tire:
Or I was war, ane gripit me at last,
And held me heich above ane flaming fire.
The tire was g^^^, the h^ did (...).
My faith grew waik, my grip was wondrous sin^l,
I trimbellit fast, my feir grew mair and mair,
My hands did shaik, that I him hold withal.
At lenth they lousit, than they begouth to fall,
I cryit O Lord, and caucht him fast again:
Lord Jesus cum, and red me out of thrall,
Curage said he, now thou art past the pain.
With this greit feir, I stackerit and awoke
Crying O Lord, Lord Jesus cum again*
Bot after this, no kind of rest I tuke,
I preisit to sleip, bot that was all in vain.
I wald have dreamit, of pleasour after pain,
Because I know, I sall it find at last:
God grant my guide may still with me remain,
It is to cum that I beleifit was past.
This is ane dream, and yet I thocht it best.
Towryte the same, and keip it still in mind:
Because I knew, their was na earthly rest,
Preparit for us, that hes our hearts inclynde
To seik the Lord, we mon be purgde and find,
Our dros is greit, the fire mon try us sair:
Bot yet our God is merciful and kind,
He sall remain and help us ever mair.
The way to heaven, I sie is wonderons hard,
My Dream declairs, that we have far to go:
We mon be stout, for cowards ar debarde,
Our flesh on force mon suffer pain and woe.
Their griuelie gaits, and many dangers mo
Awaits for us, we cannot leiue in rest:
Bot let us learn, sense we ar wairnit so,
To cleave to Christ, for he can help us hest.
(...) opp^^^^
That love the Lord and lang for Heaven sa his:
Chainge not our mind, for e have chesen the best,
Prepair our selves, for troblit mon e be.
Faint not for feir in our adversity,
Althocht that e lang luiking be for life:
Suffer ane quhyle and e sall shortly sie
The Land of rest, quhen endit is our strife.
In wilderness quhen e mon be tryit a quhyle,
it fordwart preis and never fly aback:
Like pilgrims puir and strangers in exyle,
Throw fair and foull our journay e mon tak.
The Devil, the world and all that they can make,
Will send their force to stop ow in our way:
our flesh will faint and sumtyme will grow slak,
it clim to Christ and he sall help ow ay.
The thornie cairs of this deceitful life,
Will rent our heart, and make our saull to bleid:
our flesh and spreit will be at deidlie strife,
our cruel fo will hald ow still in dreid.
And draw ow down, it rise again with speid,
And thocht e fall it ly not loytring still:
Bot call on Christ to help ow in our neid.
Quha will nocht faill his promeis to fulfill.
In floudes of woe quhen e ar like to drown,
it clim to Christ and grip him wonder fast.
And thocht e sink and in the deip fall down,
it cry aloud and he will heir at last.
Dreid nocht the death nor be not sair aghast,
Thocht all the eirth against ow sold conspyre:
Christ is our guide, and quhen our pain is past,
e sall have joy above ont hearts desire.
Thocht in this earth e sall exaltit be,
Feir salve left to humbill ow withal:
For gif e clim on tops of Montaines hie,
The heicher up the nearer is our fall.
our honey sweit sall mixit be with gall,
our short delight sall end with pain and greit:
it trust in God for his assistance call,
And he sall help and send ow sum releif.
Thocht waters greit do compass ow about,
Thocht Tirannes freat, thocht Lyouns rage and roir*
Defy them all and feir not to win out,
our guide is neir to help ow ever moir.
Thocht prick of Iron do prick ow wondrous soir,
As noysuin lusts that seik our saull to slay:
it cry on Christ and he sall go befoir,
The neirer Heaven, the harder is the way.
Rin out our race e mon not faint nor tire,
Nor sit nor stand, nor turn aback again:
Gif e desire to have our hearts desire,
Preis fordwart still althocht it be with pain.
Na rest for ow sa lang as e remain,
Ane pilgrim puir into thy loathsum life:
Fecht on our faucht it sall not be in vain,
our rich reward is worth ane gritter strife
Gif after teires e leif ane quhyle in joy,
And get ane taist of that Eternal gloir,
Be nocht secure nor slip nocht our conuoy,
For gif e do e sall repent it soir.
He knawes the way, and he mon go befoir,
Clim e alane e sall nocht mis ane fall:
our humblit flesh it mon be troublit moir.
Gif e forget upon our guide to call.
Gif Christ be gain, althocht e ^elint to ^is,
With golden wings above the firmament:
Come down again, e sall nocht better be.
That pride of ours e sall richt sair repent.
Than hald him fast with humbill heart ay bent,
To follow him, althocht throw Hell and Death:
He went befoir, his saull was torn and rent
For our deserts he felt his fathers wraith.
Thocht in the end e suffer torments fell,
Clim fast to him, that felt the same befoir:
The way to Heaven, mon be throw Death and Hell,
The last assault will troubill ow full soir.
The Lyoun than may cruelly will roir,
His time is short, his forces he will bend:
The gritter strife, the gritter is our gloir,
our pain is short, our joy sall never end.
Rejoice in God, let nocht our curage faill,
e chosin Sancts that are afflictit heir:
Thocht Satan rage, he never sall preuaill,
Fecht to the end and stoutly perseueir.
our God is true, our blude is to him deir,
Feir nocht the way sense Christ is our conuoy:
Quhen Clouds ar past the weather will grow cleir,
e saw in tears, bot e sal reap in joy.
Both deith and hell, hes lost their cruel sting,
our Captain Christ, hes maid them all to eild:
Lift up our hearts and praises to him sing,
Triumph for joy, our enemies ar keilde.
The Lord of Hostis that is our strenth and shield
The Serpents h^id h^s stoutly trampit down:
Trust in his strenth, pas fordwart in the field,
Ouercum in fecht and e sall wear the Crown.
