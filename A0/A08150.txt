NEWS FROM POLAND.
COncerning the greatness of the Empire of Turkey, and the warlike concussions
wherewith they have affrighted both Persia and Europe: you may consider it thus
in the general, that Mahomet, the author of their Religion and Alcaron,
enjoined the race of Othoman to two special things. First, The one was the
propagation of the Empire by some memorable attempt of war. Secondly, The
other, the glorification of their Religion, by some remarkable action of
peace, or stupendous structure of amazement.

Touching the first; It is too apparent, that their territories extend to the
Asian and Africane shores, from Trebizond, in the bottom of the black Sea, to
Argier, neighboring the Straites of Gibralter, very near six thousand
English miles, beside the possession of Greece, and her Islands, with his
intrusion into Hungary, and dilacerating the peace of many Nations: They have
likewise as an auxiliary friend, the great Tartar Chrim, from whole Ancestors
Tamberlaine proceeded, who though himself proved a great enemy to Turks, yet
does Tartar Chrim boast of affinity to the first Scythian Othoman, so that if
his direct line should fail, he challenges the proximity of Succession, and
inioying the prosperity of these large Territories of Asia and Europe, for
which purpose he keeps correspondency with the Turk, and at his appointment
sends 100000. Tartars to assist him in his enterprises, whereby the Turks
have many times great multitudes of men, and good success in their attempts:
For they have prevailed both against Jews and Christians, possessing at this
hour the Metropolitan City of Jerusalem in Asia, Grand Cairo in Africa, and
Constantinople in Europe, and are indeed transported with an insulting bravery,
that they are a people designed of God, to be the principal Nation of the
earth, and a scourge to whip the sinners of the world.

Touching the glorification of their Religion; who knows not, that either has
been conversant in Constantinople, or would be conversant with the stories of
former times, that the Almorata, Solimanna, Sophia, and diverse other Mosques,
be not only oftentous edifices and Churches of admiration, but works of
charity, and obseruant holiness: yea, as we call it, money laid out ad pios
vsus? I speak not of Jobs Tomb, nor many other sequestered places, wherein
these Princes, to demonstrate their opinion of a Deity, and care to maintain
Mahumetan constitutions, employed their time, and wealth, superstitiously
conceiting some merit in their obedience; and that the joys of Paradise should
be augmented, as they augmented their piety on earth: nay, you shall read in
that wonderful history of Soliman the Magnificent; and the fair, though
dangerous Roxalana, that she contrived her manumission, and so obtained to be
Empress, under a dissimuled sanctity, and holy addiction to the building of a
Church in honor of the Prophet, and glory of Religion. In a word, you shall
find, that by this occasion, the principal Mufty, with the Doctors of the Law,
have more access to the Emperor, and open a larger heart of secrets, then
either Viceer, or Bashaw. Yea the Emperor, be he never so warlike, or vicious,
stands more in awe of their prohibitions, then the reuolts or mutinies of the
tumultuary Ianisaries, by whom alone, as you read of Hercules and Atlas
supporting the heavens, this great frame of Monarchy is vpheld, and kept
secure, from any daring hands to dis-ioynt the same: and thus in general.

But if you would more particularly be acquainted with the motives, and active
terrifying the Kingdom of Poland, and other confederate Christian Provinces,
we must needs fetch the story a little from the beginning, and so draw it
down to these modern times, wherein the brave Sigismond and the hopeful
Prince his Son, have proved the sons of Mars, and registered their renownes
upon the record of honor, and filled up the tally of exployts with their
worthiness.

Know then, that while Sir Thomas Glouer was his Majesty's of Englands
Ambassador at Constantinople, there was resident in his house, one Gasparo
Gratiano, in the nature of a Drogaman, who was of Austria, and so a Subject to
Rodulphus, Emperor of Germany, but at last a servant to the Prince of Moldauia:
that Prince, I mean, that came into England, and had gracious intertainement
with the King and his Nobles: that Prince, who was dispossessed of his
inheritance through the power of Competitors: that Prince, whose Mother I
have seen poorly soliciting the Ambassador at Constantinople for relief:
that Prince, who was with the same Gasparo imprisoned in the seven Towers,
for complaining of the Viceer, who took part with his Competitor: that
Prince, who yet escaped, and was feign to flee for succor to all the Princes
of Europe: that Prince, who returned from England with sufficient revvard,
and credit for ten thousand Dollers among our Merchants. In a word, that
Prince, who covertly came from Venice to Constantinople, and so engaged Sir
Thomas Glouer, that he had reason to complain of the Viceers opposition, and
the neglect of his own fortune. For as it should seem, he had taken up so
much money to assist him, that he almost lost himself, and made a great virtue
vmbragious with the malignity of time.

Yet does that Prince adventure to Moldauia, determining to re-integrate his
fortune, by raising of factions. But it should seem still Nemesis in Tergo.
For his adversaries were so strengthened by the Viceers favor at
Constantinople, that there went out a strange Edict from the Grand signieur,
both to have a cessation of the war, and to establish the Usurper in the
possession. Thus fled the Prince once again into Poland, and was promised
relief, yea, so forvvard in returning home, that some companies of foot, and
troops of Horse were ready to march in his behalf.

While these things were thus acted on the stage of variety in Moldauia,
Signieur Gasparo Gratiano employed in Venice by Sir Thomas Glouer, returns to
Constantinople; but finding that the Ambassadors fortunes were, as it were
obscured with some cloud of disturbance, he went another way to work to wind
up the pullies of his own advancement, either by force, or policy, in which
resolution all things were so auspicious unto him, that he was suddenly sent
with letters to the Emperor of Germany from the Grand signieur, which was
somewhat wondered at in respect of his meannesse and former servile employment,
till it was publicly known that his own brother was a Renegado Chawse, and
in good account with the Viceer, yea, one of his sisters (as he told me
himself) was taken prisoner coming as a Pilgrim to Jerusalem, and so brought
to Constantinople, but whether reserved for the Turks use, or some Bashaw, he
could not tell.

In the mean while, Sir Thomas Glouer is recalled into England, and Master
Paul Pindar, who had been Consul at Petrasse and Aleppo, as many years
commorant in those parts, was confirmed his Majesty's Ambassador in
Constantinople, in whose time the former Gasparo Gratiano returns again to
the great City, and was employed into Moldauia by the Viceer, either as an
ouerseer of the actions of that Province, or as a new adversary to the
unfortunate Prince his Master, who at last was there mischieuously poisoned
amongst them, or as some will have it, absolute governor, till the true titles
might appear, and the controversies be determined.

How he behaved himself, I will not dispute, not constantly maintain, that he
dealt treacherously with the King of Poland, certifying under hand, that
contrary to the peace contracted with the Grand signieur, he supported the
pirates of the black Sea, and the inhabitants of Bugdonia, the intestine broils
of Moldauia, the incursions of many Cossacks, whereby the Turk was then much
exasperated against Poland, and a manifest cloud of mischief hung over all
those Countries apparently. But this I am sure of, that his Majesty's
Ambassador of Poland, Leigier at Constantinople, had neither so gracious
audience as he was wont, not such security as the privileges of Ambassadors
presumed on. For presently the Grand signieur exclaymed against them all in
fury and displeasure, and when there was forcible intimation indeed concerning
the business of Moldauia, and the many claymes to the Principality by factious
Lords, he not only gave commandment to overrun that Country, but to
teach Poland it self a new lesson of obedience, yt durst be auxiliary to a
petty Province, against so mighty a Monarke and greatest Prince in the world:
nor ended it thus in a kind of slender inuectiue, but the threatenings had
terms of ostentation, besides the exprobrating their perfidiousnesse, yea,
the letters had wonderful titles, and far-fetcht denominations, the Embassies,
mixture of profaneness, and presumption of ouer-running Europe; and all this
was done in the life of Achmate, though for the time the whole frame of this
conceived displeasure proved a Babylonish Tovver, and ended only in confusion
of Languages: For as yet more then the customary breaking out of the Cossacks
of Bogdonia, and the territories about the black Sea, there was no main Army
on foot, but only certain preparatiues to a follovving war. For as if he
would leave his rage hereditary, he commanded the principal Mufti and Doctors
of the Law to remember this charge to his Son, and put him in mind of the
prosecution: which accordingly with filial obedience he performed indeed, and
brought out the furies of his vengeance to act that part, which they have now
played in those Countries. But because many remarkable things happened in the
death of Achmate, before this young Phaeton came to guide and manage the Horses
of this Monarchies Chariot, give me leave to insist a little upon them, and
model out this relation to some form of pleasure and contentment.

Achmate coming to the Empire at 15. years old, remained in the same, till he
was almost thirty, in which time pleasure surfetted on ease, and ease had such
changes of wantonness, that he seemed weary with the continuance of delight:
for Sardanapalus came short of him for abundance of Concubines, and variety of
luxury: so that if it be true, that Voluptates commendat rarior vsus, it must
needs follow, that to play thus continually, proved as tedious to him as to
work; and to gurmandize thus without cessation, must needs raise rather a
lothsomenesse then satisfaction. In brief, he had so many wives and children,
that, in a manner, he forgot the the glory of his Family, and the prosecution of
glorious enterprises, giving himself over to the Sirens incantation of Lust
and lasciviousness: in the heat of which outrage, he determined to kill his
brother Mustapha, a Prince of great expectation, whom, as yet, some
supernatural providence had preserved from death: But now to color his
pretenses, such was the law, such was the custom, nay, such was the necessity
of preservation, that as Nature teaches all creatures the way of security; so
had Policy instructed these Princes by this one Machiauelia^ trick to prevent
mischiefs, insurrections, factions, competitions, murders, and all such
affrightings that make Princes unhappy, if they be once put in fear indeed.
This made Damocles that he could eat no meat, when he saw the sword ready to
fall upon him, that hung over his head by a horse hair. This made the Emperor
tell his flatterer, that if he knew what cares were the Companions of his
Crown, he would not take it up, though it lay in his way as a donation of
Fortune. This made Dionysius trust none but his daughter, to burn off his
hair with nutshels: and this made Achmate to continue the custom of his
Progenitors, by removing all the causes of terror and suspicion, though the
life of his brethren paid for it.

But what says the Poet? Multa cadunt inter calicem supremaque labra. So as
this jolly Prince was running away with the apprehension of his happiness,
setting down a determinate hour for the strangling of Prince Mustapha his
brother, the night before the period of his Catastrophe, a fearful Vision
diuerted him from the enterprise, and a fearful voice ecchoed in his ears,
that there could be no Religion in murder; and those sacrifices which the
Tyrants made in former times, of blood and humane flesh, were the causes of the
ruin and deuastation of their Monarchies; yea, utter loss of body and soul
to the Princes themselves.

Little thought the great Turk to have found a greater Greatness in his
sleep, and less did he suspect that there was such a God above to
countermand the gods on the earth. But so predominant was his ouer-ruling
Genius at this time, and so tractable his obedience, that the very ^ext day he
sent for the principal Mufty, some Doctors of the Law, and Scander Bashaw, who
was delegated General against the Polonians: To whom he imparted the
apparition, and of whom he received something sortable to the flattering of
Princes; but altogether unseasonable, because his soul was touched with some
rough hands, and he wisely considered there was more to be looked after, then
a present greatness, or flourishing tyranny: whereupon even in their presence
he sends for his brother, discharges his Mutes, who were the officers of
death, allows him a Guard of Capogies, appoynteth him a Caska, or
Banqueting House by himself, and at last prevails thus with his own great
heart, that he venteth out these speeches:

Brother, arise, (for you must know, that all men coming to tractate with the
Emperor, use a kind of slavish prostitution, till, out of his free
Princelinesse, he grace them with a new favor.) You are not, I am sure,
ignorant of this secret of State, this law of Mahomet, this policy of
government, this means of our security, that when we have children of our
own, no brothers must live to disquiet them, nor any blocks be cast in their
way to the race of Sovereignty, which may either startle us in our resolutions,
or be vmbragious to their tenderness by any attempt, or suspicion of treason:
therefore was I resolved to wrap you up into the Cypress chests of your
predecessors; not so much in imitation of custom, to which in a manner our
fathers chained their lives and actions, as confirmation of my own judgment,
not to commit such a sollecisme in my Sovereignty, as to leave a hand uncut
off, which might, by way of audaciousnesse, cast defiance in the face of an
Emperor, or sow the seeds of turbulency, to choke up the good corn of peace
and quietness: but sure, thou have found some friend, whom none can find, but
by the purity of life, and devotion of prayer: he has told me in thy behalf,
There is no Religion in blood. For as that stone-building cannot stand, which
is set up with untempered mortar: so cannot their lives prosper, who carowse
the receipts that are mingled with death, or revenge.

Therefore live, nay therefore reign, and when the thread of my life is spun,
which is now a winding on the wheel of Destiny, look you step into the chair
of control. Remember the Othoman glory, and let my abhorred course of life be
a warning unto thee, that surquedry and effeminatenesse be the only clogs to a
generous mind, and bar up the gates even in the inside, to keep Princes out
of the Palace of Honor and renown. Remember, that though Monarkes would live
without control; yet there are no such enemies to the flourishings of
Government, as to sport before them with the tripping Faeries of flattery, and
private respect, whereby they shall either look with ouer-big countenances,
or speak with ouer-big voices to the subject, or else give way to such
by-vvayes of authority, that if they may be brought back to look whereon
they have trod, they would stop their noses at the filthy ordure of mud and
ovvse, when yet they might have gone in the smooth and sweet tract of a more
pleasant and safer walk. Remember my children, that are Princes by blood, and
should have been thy Masters by birthright: but they are too young to rule
themselves, and too great to be ouer-ruled by others: nay, the Othoman glory
must not be shared amongst a troop of dependants, nor the Chariot wheels of
our Majesty be dashed with the daring approches of such horses, as must needs
be dirty us more then our own flingings or wantonness. Remember thy self,
that art, as it were pulled out of the jaws of death; and if it be a benefit
to live, or a blessing to live gloriously, let it be thy virtue to be
thankful, and my good Fortune, that I imparted this benefit to so worthy a
man. To conclude, remember our God, and let not policy, like Prometheus his
Vulture, gnaw upon the heart of religion; but when thou see any start aside
from honest obedience, be sure he is either an hypocrite, or factious. Keep
thy self therefore as close to purity as thou can, and neither neglect
public meetings, nor private sequestration, but take heed of serving of God
for private respects: For that God which does give us bread, will give us
stones, and turn our heaven into brass, and earth into iron, if we do not
serve him for love, and come to him with cheerfulness.

When he had made an end, he sent for the other Viceers and Bashawes, and
adjured them to the ratification of his will: so his brother was dismissed to
his Palace designed, and they discharged till they were recalled: but he never
troubled them more: for very shortly after, he yielded to the summons of the
great Commander of Princes, and gave way to the alteration that followed in the
State, yet for the time, with one general consent and unanimity they invested
the Princely Mustapha with the Diadem, in which he remained quietly a while, as
if they made a conscience of infringing the will of the dead, and were resolved
to admit of his virtue, that must needs add glory to the Empire.

But Scander Bashaw perceiving his own authority much diminished by this
translation, and proiecting another manner of greatness, if he might be
advanced to be Viceer under a younger Prince, intimated against the new
Emperor, that he was too much addicted to peace and sobriety, and his cool
spirit must needs draw on strange inconveniences upon the Empire; but in truth,
he watched all opportunity to converse with the children of Achmate, and found
the lively Osman, or Othoman, being eight or nine years old, so forward, and
sprightfull, that he durst ask him, to his amaze, if he were not his fathers
eldest son: yea, he interiected such strange questions and demands, that the
Bashawes were already afraid they had done something unjustifiable, and which
must be answered with no less then the loss of their lives.

Whereupon he resolved on an alteration, and so conferred with the Viceer and
principal Mufty, about the towardliness of the young Prince, and saw no
remedy for their security, but to depose Mustapha again, and make Osman
Emperor: to which, when none of that Council and faction durst oppose, they
presently gave the Ianisaries a donatiue in the name of young Osman, stored the
Hellespont with many Galleys, dismissed certain Tartarians, which were to go
into Bogdonia, and were not to be tolerated till the tumult was appeased, sent
for diverse Sansacks and Timatriots to attend the young Emperor, and under hand
filled the great City with soldiers, ere Mustapha could conjecture that they
intended so weighty a business, as the deposing of a Prince.

But when all things were ready, and all men prepared, that were acquainted
with the conspiracy, Scander Bashaw brought out the young Osman in public;
whose manly countenance, and Princely towardliness amazed them more, then if
they had seen some Meteor or portentous Comet: What should I insist on
circumstances? By a wonderful applause they gave him notice of their liking,
and a quick dispatch of his inuesture assurance of their approbation: so they
made no more ado, but proclaimed him Emperor, and allowed him all his
prerogatives, as if he had been of mature judgment to challenge their
prostitution indeed. The next work was the imprisoning of his Uncle, or, if
you will, sequestring him into the former Palace where his brother appointed
him to remain before his death, with a Guard of Capogies. Here he was confined,
well attended, and better observed: For such was his Fortune, that then Scander
Bashaw excused his deposure from the necessity of their own preservation, and
fear of the tumultuary Ianisaries, who still cried after the son of Achmate,
and ever after (as it still continues) the Viceers deal in no cause without
his priuity and advice; in so much, that when the ambitious Bashaw proposed the
war against Poland, as a continuation of some glorious action for the honor of
the Othoman Family, and renouation of Achmates charge to his son in revenge
of their darings to defend Moldauia: he interceded, urging, The former
contract was not determined between the Emperor Mathias, or the House of
Austria and his brother, and that the Princes of Europe were more warlike, and
better provided then in times past: to which again Scander Bashaw replied, as
much incensed against the Polonians, that there were many reasons to move the
war, and inferences of inforcement to set forward the enterprise.

First, the fleshing (as it were) of the young Emperor with noble beginnings in
a plentiful Country, and delightsome fields, where there would be neither
Anachims nor Giants to terrify them, nor asperity of weather or wants to
exanimate the soldier. Secondly, the Country consorted to their military
manner of fighting, as being a kind of Champion and vberant soil, whereby
their Archers might have the more room, and their carriages easiness of
travel. Thirdly, it would keep other Princes in awe, from assuming a liberty
to offend their great Lord, or presuming that any power on earth should be able
to withstand the Mahumetane Army. Fourthly, if Princes did not revenge
exasperating wrongs, they would be vilipended and quickly made a scorn to
inferiors. Fifthly, opportunity was not to be dallied withal, according to
the saying of Front capillata post est occasio calua: and now the Emperors of
Germany, Rodolphus and Mathias being dead, the Princes of Germany would repine
against the house of Austria, and bandy themselves to set the peace of Europe
in combustion. Last of all, their own Empire began to grow populous, and the
Provinces had need of exonerating their people, or else some plague and dearth
would devour them, without further good or profit to the Commonwealth, then
choking the air with the stench of their carcasses, or spoiling one another
with thefts and robberies.

To all these the noble Mustapha punctually answered: First, concerning the
leading the Emperor to the martial Theater, he being so young, and not
apprehensiue either of glory, or revenge; it would be imputed to the private
humor or covetousness of some private men. As for security in the war,
opinion might be deceived, and presumption abused: for the Masters of Pole
were as good horse as themselves: and though they had not such numbers, yet
were they better furnished and appointed; and though there were not so many
strong Cities to batter or surprise, yet had they learned the cunning of
trenches, with the use of great Ordnance and fortification, yea, they knew the
discipline of a Camp, and the effect of stratagems. Secondly, concerning the
commodiousnesse of the Country, to their Military discipline, what should
arrows do against strong Corslets, and Targets of defense? Besides, they had
Harquebuze on Horseback, as well as themselves, and what they wanted in
number, was supplied with discipline and armor: as for the valor of our
nation, and their obedience to their Commanders, who peradventure were
careless to lose such whom they were willing to spare, the times were altered,
and nature had taught all creatures the law of preservation. Thirdly,
concerning the terrifying of other Princes, they would be deceived. For Rota
fortuna in gyro, and the Turks had not success in a string; nay, what
Monarchy was ever so established, but came at last to a period, subject in the
same manner to diminution, as it began with augmentation? Not that I would
extenuate the glory of our Ianisaries, but from modest conjecture of
alteration, not to be too confident of our greatness: For by experience we
have found many interceptions both at Strigonium, Vienna, and Malta: we lost
the battle of Lepanto, hazarded Tauris and other Cities to the Persian, were
turmoyled with the rebels at Aleppo, and at this hour are affronted by the
Pirates and robberies of the black Sea. Fourthly, concerning reuenges,
whereunto the Empire was engaged for fear of being slighted by others, it was
questionless in many cases a worthy work, and a trick to deserve as much as
might be at Honors hands, but in this particular it was too too true, that
from the year 1608. to 1620. many usurpers had started up in Moldauia from the
supportation, I will not say corruption of the Viceers of Constantinople, and
therefore he saw no reason upon so slender motives, as the relieuing of one
another, either for religion, or neighborhood to raise so great a war
against Poland, or break the peace, which had been so long continued, though
the unruly Cossacks still remain refractary, both against us and their own
Lords. Fifthly, concerning the dissentions of the Europian Princes, the main
business lay remote from them, and if there should be such occasion as the
Triumuiri of Jerusalem served the Romans, the neighbor Princes would quickly
unite together against a public enemy; nay, what know we, if our forces be
this way gathered against Poland, whether those mighty Nauies of Europe would
not muster themselves and come into the Leuant, and then what could a few
Galleys do against so many goodly Ships? Last of all, concerning the loss of
men, what Prince could answer for the souls of his Subjects, except the cause
were warrantable, and the war allowable? Ambition was no plea in Paradise,
nor Revenge a justifiable excuse before their God. Again, if in the opposition
they found as many men, and as much as enraged, what would then be the issue
and final effect?

When Prince Mustapha had concluded, al was misconstred, and imputed rather to
pusillanimity then courage, or the resolution of an Heroicke spirit: wherefore
they resolved to dash out these incombrances, and suppress his allegations
from the knowledge of the Army, and indeed to take a clean contrary course, so
that by the consent of the Mufty, and the principal Doctors of the Law, the
war was determined, and Scander Bashaw prostituted himself before the young
Osman with humble intercession, that he would be revenged: who presently bade
him rise, and as if he thought it a pastime, cried out, To the war: and that
he would in person, though not twelve years old, go into the field:
whereupon the Tartars were sent for, the Cammels provided, the Artillery
appointed, the bridges prepared, the pioners mustered, the munition set out,
the Ianisaries rewarded, and all things ordered to the best purpose, that might
set forward the enterprise, and belonged to so great an Army, and formidable a
preparation.

But because I am willing to touch the praises of the Polonians, and in no sort
to obumbrate their glory, that have deserved so well, not only for their
valiant enterprises, and successful victories, but for their religious care
to retribute thanksgiving to God, that has given them such wonderful means
of preuayling: I will now tell you how others tell the story, or add as a
supplyment this, which is yet untold. About the year 1609. one Stephen living
with the Viceer at Constantinople, pretended a right to the Principate of
Moldauia, and either by favor or presents, had the assistance of 20000.
Turks, whereby he prevailed in the project: yet others impute the occasion of
sending these men to Mehemet Bashaw, who failing in gathering up the taxes and
tallages of the Country, so incensed the Viceer, that he mustered a great Army
against the Sons of the Prince of Moldauia, whom they barbarously defeated
and slew with their Uncle Simeon: and because the Sons of Jeremy were reputed
Bastards, the King of Poland, by a contract from the Turks, had the naming of
a successor amongst them, who chose Constantine the younger Son to be
Vaiuod: which so displeased Mehemet Bashaw, who was designed to rectify the
disorders of this Country, that by force of Arms he spoiled whom he list, and
as it should seem, in despite of the King of Poland, killed Constantine, and
set up one of his own faction; which indignity not to be endured amongst
Princes, caused the Polonians still to help and assist these distressed
people; so that incited by the laws of Christianity and neighborhood, besides
those high motives of princelinesse and royalty, they thought it meritorious
and a duty of renown, and so accordingly supplied their wants, and took up
arms in their defense.

These wars and contentions lasted till Sigismond King of Sweden was chosen
King of Poland, a warlike Prince, and one that had many contentions with the
Muscouites, and some Competitors of his own Nation: but taking upon him this
government, he also took upon him the protection of Moldauia, so that as you
have heard, about the year 1618. the youthful Osman, Emperor of Turks, by
the instigation of Siander Bashaw, and the Viceers, gave order for the mustring
up of a wonderful Army, consisting of many Tartars, the only enemy to the
Europae^ns, to whom were united the Countries of Dacia, Seruia, Bulgaria,
Illyria, Thracia, Epyrus, and the tributary Provinces of Christians themselves,
who durst not gainesay the Turks officers, for fear of slavery, bondage, and
ouer-running their Countries, upon the least drawing back or murmuring, to be
made instruments of their brethrens blood.

In this manner was a warlike body composed of 200000. who marched into the
fields of Dacia and Bulgaria, where the Polacks incountred them with some
auxiliaries out of Russia, and the borders of the black Sea, and although they
came not near them in numbers, yet God be thanked, they surpassed them in
valor, and noble performances: For to speak without ostentation, such was the
fortune of the noble Sigismond, and the bravery of the young Prince his son,
that they never came to any forcible encounter, but the Polonians went away
with a present success, and further hope of prevailing: for which, they ever
added thanksgiving to God, and solemn Procession for their victories: Yet you
must think, their fortune never grew to that height, of such numbers as is
reported to be slain on the Turks side, but that they received reciprocal
damages, and saw some of their own men made the stuffings of graves, and the
furniture of a slaughterhouse: only this is certain, that in the year 1620.
they gave the Tartars an overthrow, as they were transporting their men at the
nether rivers to pass into firmer ground, that their bodies stopped the
stream, and 20000. at least were slain at three several incounters, which so
enraged the young Emperor, that he swear to go in person into the field with
all his forces, and then it may be, there might have been pulled on more
fearful ruins on the heads of Christians, and their fields must needs have
been heaped up with many slaughtered carcasses.

But the God of mercy and compassion, one way took pity of these innocents
and Christian Soldiers, and another way put a hook in the nose of this
Leuiathan, or if you will, abated the strength of Behemoth, and that by mere
accident, as by these particulars may appear: while the youthful Osman full
of heat and rage, prepared to go in person into Bogdonia, and so resolved
without interception to pass into Poland: the first year he was intercepted
by a plague in the Army, and so they thought it unmeet to hazard his person to
such contagion and affrighting diseases. The next year they will have an
earthquake to be so formidable at Constantinople, that beside the shaking of
the ground, overthrow of houses, and deuastation of Churches; certain
fearful storms terrified them more the^ the handwriting, that knocked
Belshazzars knees together. At another time, the Emperor having diverse
Bashawes sons appointed to attend him, would needs, in a wanton iollity, go
sport himself in the Sacra porta at Constantinople, and out of his Gally threw
wildfire and squibs amongst the ships, which sure would have done much harm,
but that the sailors, acquainted with the same, by wetting their sails, and
other devices, prevented the mischief, offering no violence unto his own
Gally; yet did they return some stones and squibs into the rest: but passing
by a lime-boat, whose smoke hindered them from descrying, or discovering the
Emperor, they threw their hot stones amongst the Galleys, whereof one hit him
full on the breast to his ouer-turning, as he was laughing at the tacklings set
on fire, and the poor slaves stripping themselves for fear of burning.
Another time as he was riding on hawking, he received so sore a fall, that the
blood gushed out of his nose, and the company were amazed at his carelessness.
Another time sporting himself in the passage to the black sea, where the
river (as I call it) is a narrow stream of 20. miles in length, beset on each
side of the bank with Bashawes houses, like the pretty fabrics between Padoa
and Venice, he would needs attempt to throw a handsome stripling ouer-boord,
which he did with that violence, that he had like to have followed him into
the water, had not the Steers-man left the helm, and took hold of his crimson
satin skirts, and so stayed him; yet his Turband fell into the water, and the
youth swamme to another Galley.

These and some other detained him a while from his first speediness of going
in person into the field, or augmenting his army to such a greatness, as was
ever allowed to the presence of an Emperor. But neither these, nor any thing
else could cool the heat of his fury and displeasure, but that he must needs
send both defiance, and threatening into Poland, that though his reuenges were
procrastinated by diverse occasions, yet would he come upon them like a
whirlwind, and take a backward race, to run the more speedily forward: nor
was this message performed sportiuely, as a custom of unkindness and ill
conceived displeasure between Princes, but with protestation and vows,
inuocacation to Mahomet, and fearful execration and oaths to do something
memorable for the glory of the Othoman Family: whereupon, as an introduction to
a more and greater mischief, he sent Scander Bashaw before, with a new army
into Bogdonia of 200000. Turks and Tartars.

When Sigismond perceived it would be worse and worse, considering they
resolved to be revenged for their former losses, he acquainted all the Princes
of Europe with the peril he stood in, recalled some of his Cossacks out of
Hungary, placed them in the borders of Moldauia, fortified the frontiers, and
stopped the passages with new Ramparts and Barricados. Thus was an Ambassador
sent to Vienna to the Emperor, by way of intercession of a peace, or truce
between Bethlehem Gabor, and his Imperial Majesty, especially between the
Princes of Germany and him, that so their forces might be converted to the
assistance of Poland, and repelling this common enemy of Christendom. Thus was
the Lord George Ossolinski, Count Palatine of Sendomiria, sent as Ambassador
to the Majesty of Great Britain, and with him Sir Arthur Ashton Knight and
Colonel, an English man, dwelling in Poland, who had audience about the 11. of
May 1621. and gracious admission of his Embassy, delivered in the Latin
tongue, both in a high phrase, and so noble a demeanor, that the King with
extraordinary willingness accorded to afford him a certain sum of money for
the leuying of 2000. Volentiers for a Guard to the King of Poles body. And thus
were the Turks insolent letters published, and many Christian hearts opened
the doors of Charity, and not only offered themselves to so good a work, but
bewailed the troubles of Europe, that kept the Princes within the circle of
their own unkindness, from a better and more religious care for the general
prosperity of Europe.

But God be thanked, in the mean time, the noble Sigismond, with the hopeful
Prince his son, had so bravely demeaned themselves, that in four several
incounters they showed the Turks the effect of so strong an arm, that 40000.
at the least shrunk under the fury of a justifiable anger, and these Infidels
saw plainly, that the God of Christianity would propagate his Church and
Religion in despite of mis-beleeuers. Nor were these victories passed over so
slightly: but the King of Poland commanded general Procession by way of
thanksgiving through his Provinces: and by way of glory and well-deserued
triumphs, made the bonefires in Cracouia testify to the world, that the God of
battles had lighted them the way to success and victory: nor ended it so, but
a Captain was sent with letters to Vienna, to participate the good news to the
Emperor, who likewise dined with my Lord Digby (his Majesty's extraordinary
Ambassador to the Emperor) not two days (being about the third of September)
before he took his leave of Caesar to return toward England.

Since which time, rumor has had such unequal passage amongst us, that many
men have bin startled again with a strange amazement, that ever so glorious a
Prince, and well deserving an army should be ouer-clouded with a tempest of
formidable distress. For many men will have it, that upon the last prevailing
of the noble Prince, who was in person in the fields of Bogdonia, the Turks
were so exasperated, and the Tartars ashamed of some demissenesse imputed unto
them, that they made head again about the beginning of September, and were
again repulsed with an Heroike violence and success, in so much that a
greater computation of their numbers slain then ever before, rejoiced the
Polonians, that they grew ouer-presumptuous, and in a manner disranked
themselves with a carelessness, which was neither so effectually done, nor
covertly performed, but some valiant Ianisaries of the Turks, and certain
Spahies which are horsemen, and were here fresh, as not being in the former
battle, rallyed the discomfited Tartars, and out of their great numbers
brought a new battle in form, and so gave a fresh assault, with fearful
impetuosity, upon the ouer-confident Polonians, who, you must consider, for all
their former preuailings, had much diminished their troops, and weakened their
Batalions; in so much that they gave ground; and these Fry of Tartars, with
their accustomed outcry and clamours, took the advantage of their retreat, and
put them pitifully to rowt, if not to a lamentable flight, following them as
far as Podolia, with the terror and bloody effects of a strange execution,
which has raised stranger reports amongst us, as far as the slaughter of
30000. men, besides other cruelties and monstrous barbarousnesse.

In this estate stand these Eastern Countries at this hour, and fear and
mischief houer over them like a thickened cloud, ready to power down horrid
showers of deuastation and misery: But that God, I hope, which holds the
winds in his hands, and rolleth up the heavens like a scroll, which is so
glorious in his works and wonders for Israel, which sent his Angel to destroy
the Host of Sennacherib, and which will preserve the woman in the Wilderness,
in despite of the Dragons watching her, will auert his Judgments from
penitent sinners, and turn these threatenings into Balaams blessings, though he
came of purpose to curse the people of God: but if again the corrupt body of
our sins must needs have a purging, for the procuring of new health, and
saving of our souls in the day of vengeance: let us submit to his cunning for
the cure, who knows what is better for o^^ wounds then our selves, and (if
need be) can power in the balm of Gilead for our perfect recovery: otherwise,
if they be festered and rankled with wanton dalliance, surquedry, gurmundize,
covetousness, pleasure and ease, gentle Cataplasmes will not serve the turn,
but they must be cut, seared and cauterized: all which God grant we may
patiently endure, and put into the true Christians hearts and mouths, to
think and say, Neither life nor death, war nor peace, things present or to
come, threatenings, nor mischief, shall keep or detain us from the hope, and
future possession of eternal happiness.
