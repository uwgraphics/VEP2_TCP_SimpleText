THE DVTIFVLL ADVICE OF A LOVING SON TO HIS AGED FATER.
SIR,
I Humbly beseech you, both in respect of the honor of God, your duty to his
Church, and the comfort of you^ own soul, that you seriously consider in what
terms you stand; and weigh your self in a Christian Balance, taking for
your counterpoise the Judgments of God: Take heed in time tha^ the word
Tekall written of old against Balthazar, and interpreted by Daniell, be not
verified in you, whose exposition was, You have been poysed in the scale, and
found of too lightweight.

Remember, that you are now in the weining, and the date of your pilgrimage
well nigh expired, and now th^^ it behooves you ^^ look toward yo^^ Country,
your fo^^ces languisheth, yo^^ senses impair, yo^^ body droops, and (...)
every side the ^^^nous Cottage (...) your faint, and feebl^ flesh threatens
fall. And having many harbingers death to premoni^^^ you of your end, how can
you but prepare for so dreadful a stranger. The young man may die quickly, but
the old cannot live long: the young man's life by casualty may be abridged, but
the old man's by no Physic can be long adiourned, and therefore if green
years should sometimes think^ of the grave, the thoughts of old ag^ should
continually dwell in the same.

The prerogativ^ of Infancy is innocence; of Childehoode, reverence of
Manhood, maturitie; and of old age, wisdom.

And seeing then that the chiefest properties of wisdom are to be mindful
of things past, careful for things present, and provident for things to come;
Use you now the privilege of natures tallent to the benefit of your own soul,
and procure hereafter to be wise in weldoing, and watchful in the foresight of
future harm^ To serve the wo^^ you are now unabl^ and though y^^ were able, yet
y^^ have little cause (...) be willing, seei^^ that it never ga^^ you but an
unhapp^ welcome, a hurtf^^ entertainment, an^ now does abando^ you with an
unfo^^tunate farewell.

You have long sowed in a field of flint, which could bring you nothing forth
but a crop of cares, and afflictions of spirit; rewarding your labors with
remorse, and affording for your gain, eternal danger.

It is now more than a seasonable time to alter the course of so unth^^^ving a
husbandr^ and to enter into t^^ field of Gods chur^^ in which, sowi^^ the seed
of repenta^^^ sorrow, and wa^^^^ring them with (...) tears of humb^^
contrition, you man hereafter reap a more beneficial ha^^^vest, and gather the
fruits of everlasti^^ comfort.

Remember, I pray you, that your spring is spent, your summer overpast, you are
now arrived at the fall of the leaf, yea, and winter colors have long since
stained your hoarie head.

Be not careless, (says Saint Augustine) though our loving Lord bear long
with offenders; for (...) longer he stays, (...) finding ame^dmen^ the soarer
he (...) scourge when (...) comes to Iudg^^ment: And his p^^^tience in so long
fo^^bearing, is only (...) lend us respit to ^^^pent, and not a^^ wise to
enlarge ^^ leisure to sin.

He that is to(...) with variety of storms, and cannot come to his desired
port, makes not much way; but is much tormoyled; So he that has passed many
years, and purchased little profit, has had a long being, but a short life;
For, life is more to be measured by well doing, than by number of ye^^^ Seeing
that (...) men by many (...) do but procure ^^^ny deaths, and o(...) in short
space (...) to the life of inf(...) ages; what is (...) body without (...)
soul, but a co(...) carcass* And (...) is the soul with^^^ God, but a
sepul^^^^ of sin?

If God be the way, the life, and the truth; he that goes without him,
strayeth; and he that lives without him, dies; and he that is not taught by
him, erreth.

Well (says Saint Augustine) God is our true, and chiefest life, from whom to
revolt, is to fall; to whom to return to rise, and in wh^^^ to stay, is to
sta^^ sure.

God is he from whom to depart (...) to dye; to whom (...) repair, is to
reviv^ and in whom (...) dwell, is life for ever* Be not then of (...) number
of the^^ that begin not (...) live, till they be r^^^dy to dye: and then,
after a foes desert, come to crave of God a friends entertainment.

Some there be that think to snatch heaven in a moment, which the best can
scarce attain unto in the maintenance of many years, and when they have
glutted themselves with worldly ^^^lights, would j(...) from Dives diet, (...)
Lazarus Crown^^ from the service (...) Satan, to the sol(...) of a Saint.

But be you w^^^ assured, that God not (...) so penurions (...) friends, as to
h^^ himself and (...) kingdom scaleab^^ for the refuse a^^ ^eversions of
their ^ives, who have sa^rificed the princi^all thereof to his e^emies, and
their ^wne brutish lust; ^hen only ceasing (...) offend, when the ^bilitie of
offending (...) taken from them.

True it is, that a ^hiefe may be saved upon the cross, and mercy found at
the last gasp: But (...) (says Saint Aug(...) though it be p(...)ble, yet it
is sc(...) credible, that (...) death should (...) favor, whose w(...) life
deserved de^^^ and that the rep^^^tance should be ^^^cepted, that (...) for
fear of hell, (...) love of himself, (...) for the love of (...) and
loathsomeness of sin cries for mercy.

Wherefore, good Sir, make no longer delays; but being so near the breaking up
of your mortal house, take time before extremity, to pacify Gods anger.

Though you suffered the bud to be blasted, though you permitted the (...) to
be perished, (...) the leaves to dry (...) yea, though you (...) the boughs to
^^ther, and the bo(...) of your tree to gr^^ to decay; yet (ala(...) keep life
in the to(...) for fear lest (...) whole tree becom^ fuel for hell fire* For
surely where t^^ tree falls, there shall lie, whether toward the South, or
to the North, to heaven, or to hell; and such sap as it brings forth, such
fruit shall it ever bear.

Death has already filed from you the better part of your natural forces, and
left you now to the Lees and remissals of your we(...)ish and dying day*

The remain(...) whereof as it can(...) be long, so does warn you speed(...)
to ransom your fo^^mer losses; for wh^^ is age, but the (...)lends of death,
a^^ what import^^^ your present weak^^nesse, but a nearne(...) of your
approchi^^ dissolution, you are now embarked in your final voyage, and not
far from the stint and period of your course.

Be not therefore unprovided of such appurtenances as are behoovefull in so
perplexed and perilous a journey; death it self is very fearful, but much
more terrible in respect (...) the judgment i^ summoneth us un^to.

If you were no^ laid upon your departing bed, burdened with the heavi^ load
of your forme^ trespasses, and gore^ with the sting and prick of a festered
Conscience; if yo^ felt the crampe of death wresting your heart strings, and
ready to make the rufull divorce between body and soul: If you lay panting
for breath, and swimming in a cold and pale sweat wearied with struggling
against your deadly pangs, O what would you give for an hours repentance; at
w^^^ rate would you (...)lue a days contri^^^on: Then worcester(...) would be
woe(...)less in respect of little respite, a sh(...) truce would see(...) more
precious t^^^ the trersures of (...) Empire, nothi^^ would be so much esteemed
as a sh(...) trice of time, whi^^ now by days, and months; and years, is most
lavishly misspent.

Oh how deeply would it wound your woeful heart, when looking back into your
former life, you considered many heinous, and horrible offenses committed, many
pious works, and godly deeds omitted, (...) neither of both ^^^pented, your
ser(...) to God promis(...) and not perform(...)

Oh how un(...)solably were (...) case, your frie^^ being fled, your ^^^^ses
affrighted, y^^^ thoughts ama^^ yor memory d^^cayed, and y^^^ whole mind
ag(...) and no part able to perform what it should; but only your guilty
Conscience pestered with sin, that would continually upbraid you with many
bitter accusations.

Oh what would you think then, being stripped out of this mortal weed, and
turned out both of service, and h(...) room of this wic(...) world, you are
(...)ced to enter into ^^^couth and stra^^^ paths, and (...) unknown and
(...)ly company to (...) convented before most severe Iudg^ carrying in y^^^
conscience your ^^^ditement, writ^^^ in a perfect Regist^^ of all your
misdeeds, when you shall see him prepared to give sentence upon you, against
whom you have so often transgressed, and the same to be your Vmpire, whom by
so many offenses you have made your enemies, when not only the Devil, but even
the Angels would plead agai^^^ you, and your ow^^ self, in despite (...) your
self, be y^^^ own most shar^^ appeacher.

Oh what wou^^ you do in th^^ dreadful exige^^ when you saw (...) ghastly
Dragon, a^^ huge gulf of he^^ breaking out wi^^ most fearful flam^^ when you
heard the weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth; the rage of those hellish
monsters, the horror of the place, the terror of the company, and the eternity
of all those torments.

Would you then think them wise that should delay in so weighty matters, and
idly play a^^^ the time allotted, (...) prevent these into^lerable calamitie^^
Would you the^ c(...) it secure to nurse your bosoms many Serpents sins? and
to fo^^^^ in your souls so ^^^ny malicious ace^^sors, as mortal (...) horrible
offense* Would you (...) ^^^^ ^hant, whose traf^ique is toil, whose wealth is
trash, and whose gain is mi^erie: what interest have you reaped, that might
equal your detriment in grace and virtue? or what could you find in the vale
of tears, that was answerable to the favor of God, with loss whereof, you
(...) contented to (...) it.

You cannot (...) be inveigled (...) the passions of yo^^ which making
a(...)tialitie of things, (...) no distance betw^^^ counterfeit and ^^rant, for
these (...) now worn out(...) force, by tract (...) time are fallen i(...)
reproof by trial of their folly.

Oh let not the crazy cowardnesse of flesh and blood daunt the prowess of an
intelligent person, who by his wisdom cannot but discern how much more cause
there is, and how much more needful it is to serve God then this wic^^^ world.

But if it be (...) ungrounded ^^^^sumption of (...) mercy of God, (...) the
hope of his ^^^stance at the (...) plunge (which ^^^deede is the ordi^^^ry lure
of the div^^^ to reclaim sin^^^^ from the pursuit (...) Repentance. Al^^ that
is too palpable a collusion to mislead a sound and serviceable man, howsoever
it may prevail with sick and (...) affected judgments: who would rely upon
eternal affairs upon the gliding slippernesse, and running streams of our
uncertain life? who, but one of of distempered (...) would offer (...) to the
discipher(...) all thoughts; (...) whom dissembl(...) may to our cost(...) to
deceive him unpossible.

Shall we estee^ it cunning to r(...) the time from (...) and bestow it o(...)
enemies, who (...)peth tale of the (...) minutes, and will examine in the end
how every moment has been employed. It is a preposterous kind of policy in
any wise conceit to fight against God, till our weapons be blunted, our forces
consumed, our limbs impotent, and our best time spent; and then when we fall for
faintness^ and have fou^^ our selves alm^^^ dead to presume (...) his mercy.

Oh! no, no, (...) wounds of his m(...)sacred body so (...) rubbed, and ren^ed
by your sins, (...) every part and ^^^^cell of our bodies diverse, and sim^^^^
ways abused, (...) be then as so many wherstones and incentives to edge and
exasperate his most just revenge against us.

It is a strange piece of Art, and a very exorbitant course, when the ship is
sound, the Pylot well, the Mariners strong, the gale favorable, and the Sea
calm to lie idly at the road, burni^^ so seasonable w^^^ther; And when (...)
Ship leaketh, the ^^^lott sick, the ma^^^^ners faint, the sto(...) boisterous,
and (...) Seas a turmoyle(...) outrageous surg(...) then to launch (...) (hoise
up sail) (...) set out for a l^^^ voyage into a (...) Country.

Yet such is the skill of these evening Repenters, who though in the sou^dnesse
of their health, and perfect use of their reason; they cannot resolve to cut
the Cables, and weigh the Anchor that withholds the^ from God.

Nevertheles, they feed themselves with a strong perswas^^^ that when they
(...) astonished, their (...) distracted, the ^^^derstanding dus^^ and the bodies
(...) souls wracked, (...) tormented with (...) throbs, and grip^^ a mortal
sickn(...) then forsooth (...) will begin to thy(...) of their weigh(...)
matters, and bec^^^ sudden Saints, when they are scarce able to behave
themselves like reasonable creatures.

No, no if neither the Cannon, Civil, nor the Common Law will allow that man
(perished in judgment) should make any testament of his temporal substance,
(...)ow (...) he that is anima^^^ with inward (...) boyles of an u^^^led
Conscience, ^^^^strained with (...) ringing fits of (...) dying flesh, may(...)
in all his ability, (...) circled in on ev^^^ side with many (...) strange
incombar^^^ces be thought (...)due discretion to ^^^^spose of his chiefest
Jewel, which is his Soul, and to dispatch the whole manage of all eternity,
and of the treasures of heaven in so short a spurt.

No, no, they that will loyter in seedetime, and begin to sow when others
reap; they that will riot out their health, and begin to (...) their
accounts (...) they are scarce (...) to speak. They (...) will slumber (...)
the day, and (...) their journey w^^^^ the light does (...) them, let th^^
blame their o^^^ folly if they dye(...) debt and ete^^^^ beggars, and (...)
headlong into (...) lap of endless perdition.

Let such listen to Saint Cyprians lesson, Let, says he, the grievousnesse of
our sore be the measure of our sorrow; let a deep wound have a deep and
diligent cure; Let no man's contrition be less then his crime.

FINIS.
