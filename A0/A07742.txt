AMong all enormities reigning (in men of reasonable capacity) none makes
them more deformed then the monster Ingratitude? whose outrageous cruelty has
Methomorphosed, friendship into emnity, familiarity, into contempt, Love into
hatred: and generally all good into evil. The remembrance whereof, has often
stirred my senses to have your worship in remembrance, for diverse and many
courtesies, from you to my self and my friends often received: And that in
bounty so far extended, as my offer of requital can no way counteruaile. But
as mighty Alexander, for ten talents given to the relief of a poor crafts
man, was thankefully contented with the receipt of a simple root. So J heartily
entreat you, to accept these poor Canzonets, by me collected from diverse
excellent Jtalian Authors, for the honest recreation of your self and others:
Such as in my simple judgment are worthy the collecting, but much more worthy
having the Habit of so worthy a patron, in whose acceptance they shall be so
well entertained, as were their masters present to behold it, they would not
only think them happily bestowed, but also yield me thanks for choice of
their patronage. And thus craving your worthy acceptance, but resting still your
debtor, J take my leave as yours to command.

CANZONETS. OR LITTLE SHORT SONGS TO FOUR VOICES: CELECTED OVT OF the best and
approved Italian Authors. BY THOMAS MORLEY, Gent. of her Majesty's Chapel.

BASSVS.

Imprinted at London by Peter Short, dwelling on Bredstreet hill at the sign
of the Star and are there to be sold. 1597.

TO THE WORSHIPFVLL MASTER HENRY TAPSFIELD CITIZEN AND GROCER OF THE CITY
OF LONDON.
AMong all enormities reigning (in men of reasonable capacity) none makes
them more deformed then the monster Ingratitude? whose outrageous cruelty has
Methomorphosed, friendship into emnity, familiarity, into contempt, Love into
hatred: and generally all good into evil. The remembrance whereof, has often
stirred my senses to have your worship in remembrance, for diverse and many
courtesies, from you to my self and my friends often received: And that in
bounty so far extended, as my offer of requital can no way counteruaile. But
as mighty Alexander, for ten talents given to the relief of a poor crafts
man, was thankefully contented with the receipt of a simple root. So J heartily
entreat you, to accept these poor Canzonets, by me collected from diverse
excellent Jtalian Authors, for the honest recreation of your self and others:
Such as in my simple judgment are worthy the collecting, but much more worthy
having the Habit of so worthy a patron, in whose acceptance they shall be so
well entertained, as were their masters present to behold it, they would not
only think them happily bestowed, but also yield me thanks for choice of
their patronage. And thus craving your worthy acceptance, but resting still your
debtor, J take my leave as yours to command.
