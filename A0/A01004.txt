GOD AND THE KING.

OR A DIALOGVE Wherein is treated of Allegiance due to our most Gracious Lord,
King James, within his Dominions.

WHICH (by removing all Controversies, and causes of Dissentions and
Suspicions) binds Subjects, by an inviolable band of Love and Duty, to their
Sovereign.

Translated out of Latin into English.

Printed at Cullen. M. DC. XX.

To the Reader.
THE former Dialogue, set forth under thi^ same Title, GOD AND THE KING (the
persons of the same being Theodidactus and Philalethes, the first signifiyng
One taught of God, the other, A lover of Truth) did ^eed explication in diverse
points, as well in regard of the verity of the discourse, as also for the more
safty both of Kings and their Kingdoms. Wherefore it was thought good, that in
this present Dialogue two other persons should treat of the same subject,
Aristobulus, that is, A good Cou^sellour, and Philanax, A Lover of Kings: of
which the one wishes all good unto Kings; the other suggesteth what he
judges best for their State. And so in few words (gentle Reader) thou have
the scope of both Dialogues. Farewell.

GOD AND THE KING.
Philanax. You are well met Aristobulus: your countenance and gesture import,
that your thoughts are much busied. What may b^ the occasion of these
Meditations?


Aristobulus. I have lately perused a short Treatise entitled GOD AND THE
KING, the Author whereof undertakes to show the grounds and foundations of
royal Sovereignty, and of the Oath of Allegiance.


Philanax. Why should the perusal of the Treatise cause such admiration in
you? I am sure you, b^ing a Professor of the Gospel, are no^ of their
number, that seek to depresse Kingly power, or think much that Kings should
oblige their subjects to them by Oaths.


Aristobulus. My profession, and my deeds declare sufficiently my dutiful
affection to Kings, my high esteem of their authority, my detestatio^ of all
treason, hollownes, and insincerity toward them. I approve the doctrine of
this Dialogu^, Dial. God and the King page 2.
that under the pious and reverend appellations of Father and Mother, are
comprised, not only our natural Parents, but likewise all higher Powers, and
especially such as have sovereign authority, as Kings and Princes, who more
expressly, then any Governors, represent the person and majesty of one God,
ruling the whole world, and are his substitutes and lieutenants, every one
within his own Kingdom. Dial. p. 33. and 34.
The subject may not touch his sovereign with any hurtful touch, nor stretch
out his hand against his sacred person, nor a^fright, nor disgrace him by
cutting the lapp ^f his garment, not hurt him in word, no not ^o much as in
thought. He must discharge his ^anifold duties toward him, by payinge ^ribute
for his regal supporte: by fighting his ^attailes with Ioab: aduenturing his
life with David to vanquish his enemies: Revealing with ^eligions Mardochaeus
treasonable designe^ents against him: by pouring out pra^ers and supplications
for his welfare: by esteeming and ^onouring him from the heart, and out of
conscience, as the anointed o^ the Lord, Gods holy Ordinance and Minister, and
as a God upon earth. These doctrines I allow; and these duties toward Princes
whosoever infringeth, either by tumults or seditions against his state, or by
treacherous and violent attempts against his person, deserve as violators of
Gods will, contemners of natures ^aw, and enemies to the good of their
Country, to be punished and persecuted ^o death by sword and fire.


Philanax. Seeing then that the Treatise you ^peake of does so fully declare
the duty of Allegiance to the King: what ^roubleth you therein, that your
coun^enance discovers disl^ke?


Aristobulus. To commend allegiance in general terms, simply and plainly
conceived, is most alowable and necessary in these times. But bold, or rather
desperate Treatises, such as this is, that disclose the mysteries of Regal
Prerogative, which, ^peach in the Starchamber. 16.6.
as his Majesty well notes, ought not to be searched into: that ground the
authority of Kings so necessary for mankind, upon doubtful curios^ties: that
move questions about depositions, both disgraceful to Majesty, and odious to
the subjects: such Treatises (I say) do more harm then good: and without
doubt the first Authors of such conceits be secret enemies to Kingly
government, and by this stratageme would craftily undermine what hitherto in
vain they have assaulted openly.


Philanax. I am persuaded the Treatise you mention was not written by any
Papist: nor that any of that generation ^ad their hand in it. Who then may we
think be these underminers of Monarchy you speak of?


Aristobulus. I would to God it were hard to name them: or that every one could
not point with his finger at that profession which from her cradle has ever
been a mortal enemy (...) Kings. That the first planters of the Gospel in
this age rooted the same in rebellion and in hatred to Monarchy, neitheir we
nor any of their best friends can deny. Bancroft in the Dangerous po^itio^s p.
33.
Our late Archbishop excuses them, that their zeal was very great, the
light of the Gospel (says he) then first appearing unto them, so dazeled
their eyes, that they did not well consider what they did. Without doubt so it
was, and so it will ever be, where the pure light, as they call it, of this
Gospel shines, and zeal thereof fervently burns, there can be no assured
allegiance to the Prince. This (I confess) is no small blemis^ to the
Religion, which I would conceal, did not love to his Majesty force me to
speak. And the reason why it must needs be so is evident.

A true spirit zealous in Religion can never be quiet in the business of
s^luation, and in questions and Controversies of Faith, ^^ll he find some
ground infallible whereon he may rest. The Papist holds that the Popes
sentence, specially in general Councels, is the infallible decider of
Controversies, upon which he repo^^th his conscience. And by submitting every
one his private judgment to the sentence of a supreme Judge, they gain peace
and v^ity among themselves, and their Judge, still when he defines, being (as
they pretend) assisted by Gods spirit, they are secured from error. An easy
and sweet way to end Controversies had it pleased God to have appointed it,
Psalm. 84. v. 16.
wherein verity and charity m^et, Justice (doctrine I say just with Gods word)
kisseth with peace: 2. Thessal. ^.2. v. 10.
and Christians might have enjoyed what S. Paul so highly commends, charity
of ^^uth. But our Authors constantly affirm, that since the Apostles, God
gr^unted no such privilege to any Pastor, nor would bestow so great blessing on
his Church, as to have perpetually such a visible governor to decide her
doubts -- nimium vobis Romana propago
visa potens, superi, propria haec si dona fuissent.
W^erfore by the consent of the Churches which we call reformed, the spirit of
God deciding Controversies, which Papists tied to the Pope and his Counsels,
was given to every man that should attend to the spirit speaking in Scriptures.
A course which pleased much the common people in the beginning, persuading them
that they had been blinded and wronged by the Pope, taking from them, together
with the use of Scriptures, their authority to judge definitions of the Church
by Scriptures. The deuisers of this way seemed to have great zeal of the
truth, but were not careful to provide for peace. And so in practice this
devise begot a multitude of Sects and Religions, one against another, that
many, weary of all, began to think it were better men should be united in
error, then thus mortally divided in Truth.

A mean was devised to decide Controversies by national Synods, that are
confessed may err, but the Civil magistrate, as our chief Deuines teach, as
being President in them, is to compel his subjects by the sword to embrace
those doctrines that be determined (be they true or falls.) For this course (say
they) was appointed by God, Hooker Ecclesiast. pol. prefac. p. 28.
who thought it better in the eye of his understanding, that sometimes an
erroneous definitive sentence should prevail, then that strifes should have
respite to grow and not come speedily to some end. Here desire of peace and
concord may seem to have made these men less zealous of the Truth then
behooued them. So it opened a gappe (specially in England) to prophanes and
irreligiosity, which is to be just of the Kings Religion whatsoever it be, or
rather of none.

A salve for this sore has been inverted: that subjects ought to obey their
Princes Laws and definitions, Hooker ibid. p. 29.
when they have only probabilities against them, not when they have necessary
and demonstratiue reasons, which discharge the conscience and give liberty to
resist. This caveat and salve for Truth sets the wound of dissension again a
bleeding. Sects in the world are now almost infinite for number: amongst
which not one is found that pretends not clear and evident demonstration,
and proof from holy Scripture for their contrary and repugnant opinions. And
who shall judge in this contradiction and confusion whose reasons are necessary
and demonstratiue? The arguments which we think demonstrati^e, move Papists
nothing at all, and arguments which we judge of no force, Puritans (as
Archbishop Bancroft writes of them) take to be so urgent, that, Survey of the
holy ^iscipline. p. 93.
if every hair of their head were a several life, they would give them all in
the cause. This controversy therefore, whose reasons are demonstratiue and whose
are not, is the greatest of all others: nor is there any way to decide it in
our churches besides the sword of the temporal Prince. Princes therefore for
conservation of peace, must keep the spirit in awe, practicing power infallible
in deeds, which they dare not challenge in words. This is the cause of the
secret emnity between power of Kings, and fervor of our Gospel. The Prince
can never be assured of our Gospellers by the Principles of their Religion,
that their zeal to the Truth will not trouble the peace of his Kingdom: nor
Ghospellers of the Prince, that his love of temporal peace, will not compel
them to trust to his deceaueable definitions. Whence it is manifest, that so
long as the one shall be zealons and fervent, to follow, and preach what by
light of the spirit they conceive to be in Sc^ipture, occasions cannot be
wanting to the other that will force him to use his power to curb their
liberty. Which power, so long as he shall usurp (and so long as he will be
Prince and Protestant he must needs usurp) let him never expect that
Ghospellers can love his government, though they may flatter in outward show.

Those men had (no doubt) the Ba^il. Dor. p 40. and. 41.
pure spirit of our Gospel, who professed, that except they Knox. histor. of
the Church of Scot. p. 265. Dang. po^it. p. 11.

If kings without fear transgress Gods Laws, they ought no more to be taken

In which government these fiery Ghospellers, as hi^ Majesty calls them,
being com^monly men of sharp wits, and ready tongues, high minded, and of
working spirits might bear great sway, and every one rule as King and Pope in
his parish.

Since that time, these men have been in show both for doctrine and practice
more moderate, specially ^ince his Majesty's happy reign, and that some of
them have been advanced to dignities. Now they are become the forwardest in
show ^or defense of Allegiance: they speak most against the Papists that hold
Kings to be deposable in some cases: They extol Royal authority above the
skies. I can i^ Charity believe that some of them mean as they profess: yet
wisdom gives leave to fear rec^nciled emenies. Poison no where lurketh more
securely then in honey. Their present doctrine carries outwardly a show of
friendship to Kings, but ^o will ^ooke into the ground, shall find it
dangerous to them, and more pernicious then the former of Calvin, Goodman,
Beza, Knox Buchanan, and others their predecessors and Masters. The ^umme of
this their doctrine is con^eyned in the Treatise entitled God and ^he King.
Dial. p. 31. 32.33.88.
The Author whereof had ^o reason to term himself Theodi^act, that is,
Taught of God, seeing he spea^eth diverse things that the spirit of God could
not suggest unto him. He ^ndertaketh the proof of four pro^ositions. The
first is, That Kings have ^uthority immediately and only from God, the Church
and people not being any thing in the ^uist thereof. This is the fundamental
^^one, whereon is built the second: that Kings have no superior on earth to
cha^^ise and punish them. The third is. That neither Tyranny, nor Heresy, nor
Apostasy can release subjects of their Obedience. The fourth: That Kings may
neither be deposed nor resisted (but by tears and prayers) though they should
be so tyrannous and profane, as to endeavor to oppress the whole Church and
Commonwealth at once, and utterly to extinguish the light of Christian Religion.


Philanax. These speeches may be disgustfull to Subjects, and sound vncou^hly
in their ^ares: but doctrine that does so magnify Kings, I see not how it may
be thought pernicious to them.


Aristobulus. Kings are not to regard so much how great and glorious, as how
grounded be the titles that are bestowed on them: seeing incredible praises
given to men, do oftentimes abate the credit of their deserved commendation.
Some Ghospellers (as a judicious Protestant complains) attributing to the holy
Scripture more then it ca^ have, Hooker. Eccl. polit. l. 2. p. 129.
the incredibility of that has caused even those things which in deed it has
most abundantly, to be the less reverently esteemed. The same we may ^are
will happen to the authority of Kings. And the danger of such flat^ering
speculations as this Dialogist ^each^th, is so much the greater to the
Sovereign, whilst they extol him ^boue measure to the state of absolute Lord
and God upon earth, as it is hateful ^o the subject to see himself abased to
^eruile and abhorred ^^ptiuity, and put to ^ more miserable condition, then the
^ondage of slaves. For slaves (to speak nothing of humane laws that have
^ppointed limits to their miseries) ^aue some rightes and liberties by the ^aw
of nature inviolable, which (if ^hey be able) they may defend by force against
even their own Masters that shall violently and unjustly invade ^hem^ Such
liberty they have to marry and propagate humane kind, to enjoy ^ife so long as
they have done nothing worthy of death, but principally ^o worship God their
maker and su^reme Lord. But this new doctrine of Princely absolute Sovereignty
set ^owne in the Treatise mentioned, ^akes the Commonwealth so mise^able, and
the people such bondmen to their Prince, that they may not defen^^ their
national freedoms how just and necessary soever, nor the liberties an^
rightes that nature has bequea^^e^ even upon slaves. But that if the Prince
wanton in cruelty, should kee^ men by force from marrying, so to bring the
Commonwealth to utter de^olation in one age: ^r if not having pati^ence to
attend that lingering consump^tion of the state, he should daily sen^ me^ by
multitudes like herds of sheep or oxen to the slaughter; or if (out o^ a
desire his subjects may perish eternally) he should seek utterly to extinguish
the doctrine of salvation within his Realms: In these cases (I say) o^ the
like, of extremest necessity and most hostile invasion, according to the
doctrine of this Dialogist, they may not lift up so much as their finger
against his attempts, nor join with any power upon earth, that would relieve
them.


Philanax. I see plainly that this doctrine is very odious in it self: and you
set it forth to the uttermost.


Aristobulus. I say no more then his own wor^es import, nor have described
tyranny ^ore truly then he has done in his Dialogue. And I know so well there
is ^o cause to fear the practice of this ^octrine by his gracious Majesty,
that I would not have said thus much, but to show how odiously ^nemies of
Royalty may, and will exagitate this Conclu^ion, when such discourses shall be
for ^he advantage of popularity. Now ^hey write, and cause Treatises to be
^ublished by authority, which when ^ime shall serve, they may use to make ^is
Majesty hateful. By the like stra^ageme the Puritans of Scotland ouer^hrew his
Maiesti^s Mother. Camden. Eliz. p. 111.
When ^hey had barbarously slain the King ^er husband, they importunely urged
^e^ (alleging it was necessary for the maintenance of her state and life) to
marry with the Earl of Bothwell, ^oncealing from her that he had been ^heef
actor in the murder. The mar^iage was no sooner concluded, but ^hey diuulged
the hatefullnes therof^ thence seeking to persuade the world she had been
consenting to her husbands death. And so what with defa^matory libells abroad,
what wit^ their turbulent declamations at hom^ they made her odious, they took
from her the Crown^ they tossed her from mi^sery to misery, till finally they
brough^ her to lay her head on the block to b^ cut off by the common
Executioner. ^ hope his Majesty's happy raygne shall never see commotion in
this state: ye^ if any such tumult happen (and human things are uncertain) I do
not fear to be found a false Prophet in saying, tha^ this doctrine will be
bitterly exclaime^ against, and this Treatise I speak of^ produced to witness
what desperate allegiance Princes exact: and urged no^ only against his
Majesty, but as a caus^ sufficient to banish Kings out of the Land. The late
Lord of Canterbury complaynes, that in his days, ^ancrofe ^uruey of ^ol. dis.
c. 2.5.7
cantonin^ of Kingdoms was in many men's mouths: tha^ men did talk what a
notable thing it is to liu^ in Venice^ where every gentleman lives wit^ as
great liberty, as the Duke himself. Many who now have Kings and their
maiesti^s most frequent in their mouth, still ^arbor we may fear, the same
affecti^n in their hearts to be freed from the^. Yea some Puritanes of the last
Parliament in their discontented meetings, were bold to propose the changing of
the government of the Realm from Monarchy into Democracy. Nor may such men^
that have been once tayn^ed with this Con^storiall affection, be therefore
trusted, because they are content to take upon them the dignity of Bishops,
wherein they may dissemble by their own doctrine, retayning it not as a sacred
but as a temporal office from the Prince, and vs^ it to set up the discipline:
These covert enemies of Kings want not their Confederates in France whose
minds and desires Turquet a famous French Protestant expresses in his book
written in commendatio^ of Democracy above Monarchy; nor in Holland to which
^his French Democratist Turquet dedi^ated his aforesaid book, as to men
^llready made blessed by this kind of government, and fittest instruments ^o
bring the same into the rest of reformed Countries. Of these enemies o^
Monarchy so combined together, so neighboring upon us, so subtle as they lie
hidden under roche^s, and corner caps in the shape of Bishops and their
adherents, we have more need to take heed then of the Pope, who is further off,
his cause not popular, his party not like to prevail by force and his
followers rather ready to dye, then they will disse^ble their Religion, as these
others do.


Philanax. I perceive by your discourse that more treachery against Kings may
be couched in these plausible discourses then I could ever have imagined. The
Trojans were not wise that trusted the gifts of the Grecians, nor can I think
it policy to rest secure of the books or writings which those that once were
Puritans publish to flatter the state or the Prince, pretending affection to
sovereignty which their Religion does so mightily and so intrinsecally oppugn.
I fear that as within the Trojan horse armed enemies lurked, so under this new
devised allegiance ^^aytors lie hidden: who when they ^^e their time will show
themselves like ^o many firebrands, to incense the people against Kings, that
challenge ^uch infinite and hateful authority.


Aristobulus. You fear not without cause, if you ^onsider that by this devise
the authors ^herof who would ^ule themselves a^one, do nothing but practice the
Ma^hiauilian means to attayn thereunto. Divide and r^g^a.
. They seek to separate the King from those, whose love may stand him in most
steed. The four propositions before set down make him enter into o^ious
competency with four Aduer^aries. The first breeds him a quarrel with the
Common wealth, from whom he will not have his power de^iued. The second puts
him into con^ention with the Church, to whose ^irection and censures he will not
have ^is Crown subordinate. The third ^rings him into hatred of mankind, by
^hallenging an irresistible power to ^yranize upon man at his pleasure. The
^ourth conteynes an open ^trife with God for precedence, requiring of the
Common weal^h, in case they cannon enjoy both, that they be content t^ want
rather God then their King. An^ these quarrels are moved upon weak^ titles and
claymes, grounded on doctrines either uncertain or apparently false, and so
odious as were the^ true, yet were it not fit to discuss^ them in vulgar
Treatises.


Philanax. I see these doctrines are odious, an^ I nothing doubt but they are
likewis^ ungrounded: yet I desire that you wi^ severally show both these things
in every one of the four propositions, tha^ I may be better instructed to
discoue^ the treacherous entendments of these counterfeit friends of Majesty.


Aristobulus. I will do my endeavor to satisfy your request. First, I will
examine the four aforesaid Propositions, which done I mean to speak a word
concerning the Oath, which Theodidact builds upon them, as upon four
^^llers. And to begin with the first, ^^at the king has power from God only,
inde^endently of the Common wealth, because this is the ground of all his
di^course, and of the other three I will ^ore fully show the unsoundness
there^f, that the world may see, that Theodi^^ct, as either a most vnkillfull
Archi^ect that lays so weak a principle of ^he building he p^e^eds to raise
to the ^kye; or a subtle Arch-traytor pur^osely placing the Sovereignty of
Kings, which he desires may fall upon ^ most ruinous foundation.

Three be the ways, by the which ^en come to be Kings: popular electi^n:
lawful conquest; Gods personal ^ppointment sp^cially revealed. I say
^pecially revealed, for I nothing doubt ^ut Kings by the two other titles be
made by Gods special providence. The title of election depends on men's ^artes.
The title of Conquest upon ^attailes, which are two things most ^ncertaine, and
their success only in Gods hand, who bestows popular ^auour and victory in
war on whom ^e will. For this reason it is said that, Kings reign by him;
Proverb. 8.
that he places the^ in their throne; Job 36.
rules in the Kingdom of men; Daniel 4.
gives it to whom soever he please, not that h^ makes Monarchs without
seco^dary causes; but because these secondary causes work not, but by the
special direction of his hand^ Wherefore the titles of Election and Conquest
be spe^cially from God, though not only and immediately from him, as is the
third claim, when God by special revelation declares his will to have some
certain person King, as he did Saul and David,


Philanax. You omit Succession, which is a claim to the Crown.


Aristobulus. Succession in blood is not a prim^ and original title, but a
means to derive to posterity these three fornamed claymes from Ancestors that
first enjoyed them; none of which titles do sufficiently institute a person
King^ without the consent of commonwealth. When a King is made by ele^^ion the
case is clear; but the Con^ueror seems to come to the crown against the
Commonwealths will. In ^eed the right of Conqueror he may ^aue, will they nil
they; yet Royal ^uthority over them he cannot have without their grant. The
right of ^awfull Conquest binds the state con^uered to make the conqueror
their King upon just conditions which he ^ay prescribe heavy or hard according
^o the quantity of their offense. If ^hey refuse to yield, he has the right ^f
the sword to force them, not the ^ight of Prince to govern them, till ^hey
consent. This consent being ^ielded, then there begins a new So^iety and
Commonwealth compacted ^f ^onquerors and the people con^uered, and the Prince
of the conque^ing side becomes King to govern them both according to the
laws and ^onditions agreed upon: which condi^^ons if he neglect, he is no
less sub^^ct and corrigible by the Common^ealth, then Kings made by ele^tion.

When God personally appoints any one to be King, as he did Saul, and David,
neither then have Kings pow^er immediately, and only from God God is said to
have made Saul, an^ David Kings, because he eternall^ decreed they should be
Kings, in du^ time revealed this his will, gave com^maundment to his people,
and effectu^ally stirred up t^^ir hearts to mak^ them Kings. These are remote
title^ and a far of: but it can never be proved that in making Saul and Daui^
Kings, the peoples grant did no^ concur with Gods, yea the Scripture signifies
that it did, saying, 1. Reg. 11.25
all the people went to Galgala and made Saul King before the Lord. The elders
of Iudath and Israel annointe^ David King over them. 2. Reg. 5.



Philanax. Some say, Dial. p. 44
the people made Saul an^ David Kings, not by giving them Kingly power this was
from God only; but by manifestin^ that they were Kings, by approving them (...)
Kings made by God, by putting them into the possession of their Kingdoms to
exercise rega^ authority.


Aristobulus. I know that Theodidact answers (...) this sort, but proof of
his sayings (...) brings none. Does he think the ^^llar of Soueraignity
stands firm in^^gh upon his bare word? What if one ^^y, that the people did
likewise con^^r with God to make them Kings, ^^n Theodidact think you clearly
con^^te him? Verily this concourse of God ^^d people to make a King is
insinua^^d in Deuteronomy, Deuteronomy. 17.
Thou shall make him ^ing whom thy Lord God has chosen for thee, ^^gnifying
that God designed the per^^n, but the people made him King (...) bestowing
authority on him. And ^^ing God uses not to do things on^^ by himself when
secondary agents (...) present sufficient to work them; ^^y may we not think
that God ha^^ng designed the persons of Saul and ^^uid, left the making them
Kings to ^^e people of the Jews, who had no ^^^se power then other free
Common^^althes to constitute for themselves ^^uernours and Kings?

Here you may see in what danger to fall, regal supremacy is, which
Th^^odidact builds upon this discour^^ Saul and David had power only an^
immediately from God, therefore the same is to be believed of other Kings^ The
antecedent is uncertain, and ca^ never be proved, as has been sayd^ but much
more seely is the co^sequen^^ which extends Gods special f^^uours showed to
his people in the choice of their Kings, to the generali^^ of Kings and
Nations. God fed h^^ people in the des^rt with bread ma^^ by the hands of
Angels; may we the^^^ infer that men have no bread b^^ comes immediately
from heaven?

But (to omit these Kings that were by Gods express commission personall^
designed) that other Kings have pow^^ only from God, is a paradox which scar^
any Christian Divine houldes. C^^tholicks, Puritans, foreign Prot^^stants,
even our English Conform^^tants, derive regal authority from the Commonwealth.
Let the truth b^ tried by the testimony of two. Can ^ame any grauer Authors in
o^^ Church then Doctor Bilson late Bisho^ ^f Winchester and M. Hooker? The
first in ^is Trea^ise of Christian Subjection ^ebateth this question, The true
difference etc. p. 421.
and defines that Kings are not only creatures of ^he Commonwealth, but also
in some ^ases, may be deposed by the supreme ^urisdiction thereof. And that
Chilperick was justly deposed by his Nobles, and ^ipin chosen King in his
place. M. Hooker ^ath these words. l. 1. Eccles. polit. p. 72.
all public regiment (...) what kind soever seems evidently to have ^^sen
from deliberate advise, and consultation, and composition between men ordeyning
the ^^me, and yiedling themselves subject thereunto, without which consent
there were no reason ^a^ one man should take upon him to be Lord or judge over
others. And again: Ibid.
To Fathers ^^aith he) within their private ^amilies na^^re has given supreme

their consent upon whose persons they im^pose laws, it is no better then mere
tyranny^ Thus he writes, and thus our own Authors ouerthr^w Theodidacts new
pillar of Sovereignty, proclaymin^ those Princes plain tyra^ts that claym^
power derived from God and nature and not originally from the grau^^ and
consent of their subjects. For which their opinions reasons may be brough^ very
urgent. The practice of all Cou^^tryes that have tra^sferred the Crown^ from
family to family have restrayne^ and enlarged the bounds thereof b^ politic
laws. What reason, if we r^^spect only the law of God and nature why Spain
should be governed by a M^^narch, rather then Venice? That i^ England women may
succeed to the Crown, from which they are exclude^ in France? That in
Scotland the Crown^ descends to the nearest in bl^ud, a^^ (...) Poland the
King is made by the free ^^oice of States? Victor. relect. 3. d^ pot^st.

What is the reason ^^at by the law of nations the whole Commonwealth may be
punished and ^rought into bondage for the sins ^f their Prince? Why should the
Princes ^^ymes be imputed to them, if it were (...) their choice, neither at
the first to ^aue him, nor afterward to want him? without question ^he general
voice ^f h^mane kind is, that Common^ealthes have power to make Princes, and
upon just reason unmake them: and therefore they are accountable to ^^her
neighboring States, if they ad^it one to the Crown with their in^^ry, or
finding him incorrigible do ^ot remove him. Whence arises that ^^onge
inclination in subjects to fight ^^r their Prince, to wit from love, to ^^stify
their own doings and the States ^^blick judgment of their Princes ^orthines.


Philanax. It cannot be well denied but the ^^nsent of the Commonwealth either
^^e or enforced by Conquest, concur^eth to the making of the Prince, but
Theodidact says, that is, not the original and mediate fountain o^ this
authority^ Heat, moisture, cold, and our temper arising from them, are
preparations whereby our bodies are made fit receptacles for the soul, but the
Creator o^ our soul is God: so Princes have their claymes and ti^les by
election or conquest, but the prime Author of their power is God, and as they
receive their power only from God, s^ for the good or evil administration
thereof they are accountable only to God.


Aristobulus. This discourse of Theodidact groundeth Royal authority upon
another uncertainty, which Deuines debate i^ their schools: whether royal
power be produced by the Commonwealt^ when Kings are made, or being create^ by
God together with mankind from the b^ginning, is communicated b^ the
Commonwealth to their King^ Some say, Molin^ to. 1. de iure tract. 2. disp. 26.
Driedo de libert. l. 1. c. 15.
that the Commonweal^h making Kings, produces a new kin^ of power which
before was not whence they infer that the Commo^^wealth has a more eminent
authorit^ ^hen the King, as being able to give ^eing to his power: others,
whom ^ rather approve, teach that regal au^hority was created imediatly of God
together with man's nature, Victor? relect. de potest. civilly. n. 8. and Couarr.
de practicis quaest. c. 1. n. 6.
and is for^ally in every absolute and free state: which state when they choose
for the^^^lues a King, does not produce a new ^ind of power which was not
before, ^ut the royal Sovereignty which God ^reated and bestowed upon them,
they ^^ansferre from himselues to the per^^n elected, by which conjunction of
^^e Commonwealths power, with ^^s person, he is created King. In the ^^ke
manner parents produce children, ^^t by producing the soul which is (...) God
only, but by conioyuing the ^ule created of God to the body pre^^red and
de^igned by generation ^^erunto. True then is the saying of (...) Paul: Omnis
potestas a Deo est: All power is (...) God, and only imediatly f^o^ God: Romans
13.2.
(...) joined with particular persons, (...) without the mediation of man.
^ence, says Tertullian, cited by this ^^eatiser, Kings have their power whence
^^r spirit, Page 46.
both created by God only, but as the spirit is not infused into the body
without the concourse of Pa^rents, so neither is Royal power united with this
or that person, bu^ by the consent of their Country. Yo^ see that even in this
opinion Kings ar^ no less beholding to the Common^wealth for their authority,
then Chil^dren to their Parents for their souls, (...) whose being parents
concur, onl^ designing the matter, and making the same a fit receptacle for
their soule^ Vain then is Theodidacts subtil^y (...) make Kings beholding to
God onl^ and no less vain is his speculatio^ (...) prove their exemption from
men. Kin^ (says he) as they receive their power ^ro^ God only, so ^or the good
or evil administration th^^reof, they are accountable only to God. Who se^ not
the weakness of this infere^ce, thou^^ the antecedent were true? The soul (...)
men is of God only, yet for words (...) deeds proceeding from the same, m^^
are accountable to mor^al Superiou^^ The power of Father over his child^^^ the
power of husband over his w^^^ is of God only; yet for the administr^^tion
thereof they may be called to a^^^unt by the Commonwealth, yea ^^s authority
which God has given ^^em, when they tyranize over wife ^^d children, the
Commonwealth ^ay restrain, or utterly take from ^^em. To conclude, and sum
up ^is whole discourse in few words. that Saul or David, or any King had ^wer
only from God, is at the least (...) uncertainty, thence to infer the ^^^e of
al Kings is a mere vanity That (...) Kings have power from God only, ^^th no
probability. Grant all: yet ^^ueraignty cannot out of these prin^^^les be
concluded, seeing some ^wer only from God may be subor^^^ate to superiors on
earth. Theodida^^^^ did he not desire that royal Soue^^^gnty should fall, would
he (think (...)) strive so earnestly to have the (...) builded on this heap
of sand.


Philanax. Does not this doctrine, that ^^nces are made by the consent of the
^^^monwealth, impare the Maie^^ ^f Kings, and the reverence and ^^^ration due
thereunto?


A^istobulus. No: but rather increase the sam^ more then the contrary conceit.
For if men be made to the image and likeness of God, sons of God, and God on
earth, principally in respect of the sovereignty they have to rule themsel^ues
and other Creatures, when this di^uine Majesty of nature is wholly trans^ferred
from the Communalty to on^ person; how sacred and venerable man he be thought,
as in the beginning o^ the world, the waters that were vn^der the Heavens
gathering into on^ place, made this vast ocean we see; s^ the heavenly gift of
Sovereignty d^^ffused in every free and absolute state when they by common
consent em^^tying and exhausting themselves, d^^riue the same to one person,
b^^comes a fountain or rather a may^ sea of Majesty and power; which (...)
humane in regard of the person (...) which it is, and the manner it com^ unto
him: but divine, if we look (...) the spring whence it originally a^^
immediately flows. To which pu^^^ose the Poet sings not amiss -- Terrae
Dominos, pelagique futuros
^^menso decuit rer^m de Principe nasci.



Philanax. I am satisfied, and see plainly that his immediate receiving power
from God only, is but an empty title without substance, which his Majesty will
^ot regard, being ^^ll of true glory. ^lexander was not wise in his vain
am^ition to be thought Jupiters son, ^hereby he lost their hearts that had
^ost helped him to the Monarchy of ^he earth.


Aristobulus. The conceit is not only idle and ^mpty, but also may prejudice
Kings. As Hercules choked the giant by hol^ing him aloft in the air, whom by
^hrowing against the ground he could ^ot overcome: so the enemies of Kings
whom by their doctrine, that depre^sed them under the feet of common people,
they could not make way ^ith flattering subjects, they lift to ^he skies that
they may more dangerously fall. For such conceits by raising Kings beyond
measure above t^^ heads of their subjects, remove the^ much further from their
hearts, which are (whatsoever flatterers say) the im^^diate fountain of their
greatness, and the only seat of security they may tru^ unto. Such Monarchs as
though^ themselves sure, being feared, thoug^ they were also ha^^d, have left
behin^ them lamentable documents, tha^ they were deceived: and that the say^ing
of a prudent historian is most tru^ Nullum stabile regnum nis^ beneuolentia
muni^tum, AEmilius Probus in Dione.
No King can long reign who i^ not walled in and guarded about wit^ the Love
of his subjects. Man's lou^ with ease descendes to persons vnde^ him either by
natural descent which is the cause they love so deerly their Children, or by
voluntary subjection which is the reason we love them tha^ do freely deuote
them^elues to ou^ service. Neither did God in the trea^sure of his infinite
wisdom find any better means to win man's a^ffection then to descend both to
re^cea^e life and being from man, glory^^^g to be styled the son of man, and
af^^^ward to live as an humble servant (...) man, performing the greatest
ser^^ce of Charity, to dye for him. It ^^nnot be thought how lovely to man
^aiesty is, that professes to come of ^^s stock, and to be wholly consecra^^d
to his love: you may by this guess ^ow pernicious this new doctrine is, ^^at
dries up these two fountains, (...) peoples affection toward their ^rince,
by making him skorne to be ^^ought (though S. Peter so terms ^^m) the
creature of man, much less ^^eir servant, rather then absolute ^^ord that may
dispose of their lives and ^^uings at this will.

Contrary to this was the judgment ^f all the worthiest and best Roman ^mperors
that reigned happily and ^^ed quietly in their bedds. They did ^ost willingly
acknowledge the Em^ire to be the gift of the people and ^enate: they were much
more careful ^f their Subjects good, then of their ^wne, yea they seemed not
to regard ^easons against their persons that ^ere not joined with other
public d^triment. Amongst the^e, Traian i^ emine^t, who being chosen Emperou^
straight in the hands of the Consul^ swore allegiance and fealty to the
com^monwealth: Plinius in panegir.

Trai ^n. Dio in Traiano.


and when he made the Praetor to govern in his name according to the ceremony,
delivering the naked sword, said to him: Use this sword for me if I govern
justly, i^ otherwise use it against me. By which resignation both of state and
life, into the Commonwealthes hands, he more secured them both, then any
enforced Oath, that he held the Crown from God only, could have done.


Philanax. You have showed the first proposition of Theodidact to be neither a
solid ground of sovereignty, nor a doctrine apt to nourish in subjects minds,
affection to their Kings. I desire you would pass to the examination of the
second: that Kings have no Superior that may call him to account, or pun^sh
him, but God alone.


Aristobulus. Here Theodidact goes forward in building the sovereignty of
Kings ^ither upon manifest falsehood, or tot^ering vncertaineties. That the King
^ath no superior, but God alone, that ^ay punish him, all learned men
ge^erally, Papists, Puritans, Pro^estants ^eny.


Philanax. I do much wonder that you say Protestants ^each, that the King may
^e sentenced and punished by any man upon earth. I think you mean Puri^ans,
not our Protestants that pro^esse to follow the Religion established ^y
Parliament.


Aristobulus. I mean Protestants that are ene^ies of Puritans, and conformable
to ^he state: and to increase your wondering I add, that howsoever the word
Supreme Governor, and Head of the Church go current in England, yet in ^ense
our Deuines give our King no greater authority in causes Ecclesiastical then
Papists do. I desire not to be ^eleeued unless I make what I have ^ayd,
evident by the testimonies of them, that have lately written abo^^ this
argument.

First concerning the ver^ title, they say, the King has no any spiritual
Ecclesiastical power a^ a^l, Confut. p. 3. and 36.

Respons. pro Tortura

Torti. p. 239.

Tompson in elench. refut^ p. 51.


his power (says doctor Morton, no^ Bishop of Chester) is but corporal, and
ca^ go no ^urther then the body. He has (sayt^ M. Burhill) no jurisdiction in
the Church ey^ther ^or the inward o^ outward Court: his power is mere
temporal and laicall, nor in it sel^ spiritual, though the matter and object
there^^ be spiritual: such power, and no greater, sayt^ M. Richard Tomson,
then Jews, Infidel^ and Turks have over the Christian Church within their
dominions.

Secondly concerning Controversies of faith, the Deane of Lichfiel^ doctor
Tooker disclaymeth as an im^pudent slander, that the Church o^ England holds,
Duel. co^tra Becan. p. 3.
the King to be their prima^ or head, or judge of Controversies about fait^ and
Religion. To the Apostles Christ gave power to gather Counsels, and to define
solemnly the Churches doubts. Concord. Angl. p. 43.
The sentence of Council (says M. Richard Harris) has without the King the
force of an ecclesiastical law: Ibid.
the King adds thereunto corporal penalty. M. Morton ^^yth, that Imperial
and Kingly authority in ^^irituall causes, reaches no further, then as it
^^longeth to outward preservation, not to the ^ersonall administration of them,
neither does ^^e King challenge, nor subjects condescend unto ^ore. Barlow in
his answer to a namelesse Catholic p^ 171.
But most clearly M. Barlow late ^ishop of Lincoln^. The King (says he) in
^ontrouersies about faith, has not iu^icium definitium, sentence d^finitiue,
to ^^scerne what is sound in ^^^inity: but when the church has determined
matters of faith, he ^ath iudicium executiuum, sentence exe^utiue, to command
the professing thereof ^ithin his Kingdoms.

And is not this the very doctrine ^f Papists, Survey of the holy Discipl. p.
254.
and that doctrine which ^^rmerly our Archbishop Bancro^t re^ected with great
scorn, as disgrace^ull to Kings, making them, but Car^^fices Ecclesiae, the
executioners of the Churches will and pleasure? Tortura Torti. p. 151.


Thirdly concerning the offices of ^his power, they teach, Tooker Duel. p. 15.

Tomson ^lench. p. 83.


the King has no ^ower to use any censure, or to cast any out of ^he Church by
sentence, but his office is to punish them with corporal chastisement, on whom
Bishops have laid their censures. The King does ^ot make or unmake Bishops,
they are made by the Bishops of the Kingdone, as by them they a^^ desposed and
unmade. Took^r Duel. p. ^6
The King has right t^ name and present persons to benefices, as other lay men
of lower condition have, but benefices ei^ther with cure or without cure, great
or little, he neither does, nor ever did bestow, much less the ecclesiastical
dignities, as the Bishoprics and Arch-Bishopricks of his Kingdom. Answer to
a nameless. p. 172.


Fourthly, concerning the Kings sudordination to Bishops, Doctor Barlow highly
commends the saying of Ambrose: Duel. page 311.
Bishops (in matters concerning faith) are to judge of Emperors, not Emperors
of Bishops. Quod Ambrosio licuit in Theodosiu^, idem and alijs in Regem simili
de causa liceat. Burhill. ibid. 139.
The Deane of Lich^eild says, that, the King is, and with Valentinian Emperor
does acknowledge himself the son and p^pill of the Church, and the scholar
of the Bishops. What more do papists require? Can he then judge and teach his
Fathers, Judges and Masters in those things wherein he is their son,
pupil, and scholar? Finally M. Burhill says, Theodor. l. 9. Histor. c. 30.
Ruffin. l. 12. c. 18. Niceph. l. 12. c. 41.
that the King sup^eme governor of the Church may by his Bishops be cast out
of the Church, What Ambrose did lawfully to Theodosius, our Bishops may do
lawfully to the King ^or the like offense. And what did Ambrose to Theodosius?
He cast him by sentence out of the Church: he stood ready to keep him out by
force, and called him Ty^ant ^o his face: he forced him to e^act a temporal
law concerning the ^xecution of the sentence in matter of ^ife and death: he
commanded him out of the quire or the place of Priests, sent him into the body
of the Church to pray with laymen. And may the Bishop of Canterb^^y lay the
same punishments on his M^iesty? Tortur. Tort. p^ 15^ Survey of holy Disc. p.
254.
yea (says the Bishop of Ely) perchance the Pope may excommunicate the King,
and deprive him of the common goods of the Church.

Do you see to how many censures, Reges n^ nisi a Papa exco^municantur and
ce^suris ligantur. Emman. Saa, verb. Excomm. 15. Enriquez l. 1^. de ex^om. c.
14. Sayr. in Thesau. l. 1. c. 9. n. 7
Protestants make the King subject? Truly I see not how any Religion does or
can make Kings more absolute, and subject to fewer Superiors, then Papists do,
The Puritan will have them subject to the Pastor of every parish that has a
Consistory, as our Bishop Bancro^t says They banish one Pope and admit a
thousand. The Protestant makes them obnoxious to the censure of Bishops without
any restraynt, whereas the Romanists out of respect to the Majesty of Kings,
reserve the power of censuring them ^o the supreme Pastor.

But to return to Theodidact: you se^ he keeps his custom to ground
al^legiance due to Kings, upon do^ctrines either questionable, or (...) denied
of all sides; his second propo^sition, that the King is free from al^
punishment that man may inflict, being rather more uncertain, then hi^ first,
that Kings h^^e their power only from God.


Philanax. It seems by your discourse, tha^ Theodidact makes Kings more
absolu^^^ then other Protestants do, and teaches against them, that the King
may no^ be excommunicated, or cast out of the Church. For he says, that the
King i^ free from all punishment that man can inflict and excommunication
without doubt is a great punishment: Ministers with^out question, are men.


Aristobulus. It is hard to say, what Theodida^^ holds: this his ground of
Soueraignty^ The King has no superior but God alone, i^ ^lippery and
uncertain, that he dares not stand upon it himself. For elsewhere contradicting
this principle, he ^aith in plain terms, that, Page 58.
Kings that ^aue given their names unto Christ are sheep of ^is fold, Page 56.
and so are to obey their spiritual pastors ^auing oversight over them: that
they are to be ^bedient unto their spiritual Pastors, as Em^assadors from
Christ: Page 57.
th^t^ Kings and Bishops ^e mutually Pastors, and Superiors one to the ^ther.
If Bishops be overseers, Pastors, Superiors to the King, how is it true, that
the King has no superior but God alone? If nothing be more excellent, nothing
more sublime then a Bishop, as our Theodidact, De dignit^ sacer. c. 3.
approving S. Ambrose his ^aying, teaches, ^o wit in spiritual and
Ecclesiastical causes, which to ad^minister they are sent; Page 60.
how can a King ^e more excellent then a Bishop in those causes? Is it possible
that the same man should be superior and subject to ^he same persons in respect
of the same Court? I confess I cannot understand this divinity, that subjects
may judge their Superiors, even in those causes, wherein they are subordinate to
them. That, the King supreme Governor of the Church, may be sententially
summoned, arrai^gned, and cast out of the Church by a Bishop^ If sovereign
Princes may be iudge^ by their subjects in those causes wherein they are supreme
and independent what does their supremacy avail the^^ If supreme governors of
the Church may be cast out of the Church, by their Bishops that ar^ their
spiritual subjects; what solid reason can Theodidac^ assign why Sovereigns
may not like^wise be cast out of their Kingdom by their Barons and Peers,
thoug^ they be their vassalls?


Philanax. I could wish our Authors, concerning the Kings supremacy, spoke more
coherently, yet seeing this proposition the King has no superior but Go^
alone, does so much extol the Soue^raignty of Kings, I can not be brough^ to
forsake Theodidact herein, except b^ the confutation of his reasons I perceive
this pillar of Majesty to be uncertain, and unsound.


Aristobulus. Small reading and skill in Scri^ture is suffici^nt to show, that
Theodidacts arguments against Papists be not so conuincing as we may securely
ground the authority of Kings ther^pon. For either th^^ make nothing to the
purpose, or else prove what Papists do not deny, that the King is supreme in
temporalls.

His mayn^ ^round and principle is, that in the old Testament Priests were not
superior to Kings, but rather that Kings were their Judges: Could he have
assumed a doctrine more uncertain, or rather more false, then is this? l. 2.
contra Apionem.
A doctrine against the learned of the Jews. Josephus says, that to their
Priests not to Kings was committed the custody of the Law, and the charge of
greatest affairs: so that they were overseers of all, Judges of controversies,
and punisher of offenders. Philo De legate. sua ad Caiu^. qua^to Deus antestat
homini, ta^to pontificatus regno exce^lentior.
writes that Priestly dignity is preferred before royal, by the Jews, who
judge Priesthood by so much the more excellent then Royalty, by how much God
surpasses man. With whom^ agree the Chri^tian Fathers, namely S. Chrysostom,
auerring, Homil^ 4. super verb. Isa. vidi dominum.
that God would have Kings submit their heads to the hands of Priests, that men
might understand that Priest^ are more worthy Princes, and more venerable then
are Kings. Yea the word of God se^meth ^o distinguish the office of high
Priest, from the office of King, 4. Reg. c. 22.
assigning to the high Priest the care of things that pertayne to God, to the
King the ch^rge of temporal affairs. Deuteronomy. 17.12 Qui aute^ superbierit,
nolens obedire imp^rio, morietur homo.
And who (conversant in the old Testament) knows not, that to the high Pri^^^
was given the supreme and last power to decide all controversies about the law?
Whosoever shall be proud and refuse to obey the sentence of the Priest, let
that man dye the death.


Philanax. These testimony of the Fathers and Scriptures seem very urgent: But
has not Theodidact made some answer to them?


Aristobulus. No: nor brought any proof of his opinion, besides the bare
example of ^alomon, Dial. p. 48.
that deposed Abiathar the high Priest and placed Sadocke in his roome^ But
first be ^roues not that Solomon deposed Abia^har lawfully, that therein he
exceeded ^ot the bounds of his authority. The deeds of Kings be not ever
justifiable, ^or was Solomon such a Saint, that we may think all his actions
praise worthy without further proof. Secondly he proves not that Solomon
deposed Abia^har by the ordinary power of King. Papists say, Sand. l. 2. v fib.
Mon. c. 3.
Solomon did in that action proceed not as King, Stapleton. prin^. doct. l. 3.
c 3.
but as Prophet. Bell. l. de conc. 20. Dial. p. 49.
Which answer Theodidact does not confute, but misunderstand, as though they
me^nt that Solomon was therefore a Prophet, because he fulfilled what God had
foretold against the house of Heli, which he rejects with a jest, that so
Herod might be termed a Prophet in murdering the Innocents, because therein he
^ulfilled, what God by Jeremy had foretold. Act. 1. v. 14.
But the Papists be not so absurd as to say that whosoever fulfilleth a
prophecy, is a Prophet, nor that Judas in betraying his Master, and hanging
himself was a Prophet, though therein he fulfilled prophecies. They say that
God, to the end that what he had threatened a^gainst the house of Heli, might
come t^ pass, he gave to Solomon prophetical and extraordinary Commission to
depos^ Abi^thar high Priest of the stock of Hel^ Salomons royal authority not
being sufficie^^ for the lawful performanc^ thereof. Which doctrine is so
solid^ that Theodidact, not being able to ouer^throw it by argument, thought
goo^ to make it ridiculous by mistaking it^ Finally though we grant that
Salo^mon deposed Abiathar, and by Kingly authority; the most that may be thenc^
in^erred is, that Solomon was suprem^ in temporal affairs, and might pu^nish
Priests in case of Treason. Which notwithstanding in things pertaining t^ God,
Princes might be subject to the High Priest, and for spiritual crimes ten^ding
to the overthrow of Religion^ might be deposed.

And in my opinion it is want o^ judgment in them that would b^ thought friends
to Kings, to stir the stories of the old Testament, which, for one high Priest
desposed by a King witho^t clear approbation of the ^act, yields two
sovereign Princes deposed by the high Priest, and their deposition warranted
by the holy Ghost. 2. King. 11.
Did not Iehoida High Priest depose Athalia Queen, pronounce sentence of death
upon her, and in ^er room make Ioas King? 2. Chron. 26.
Did not Azarias High Priest cast King Ozias out of the Temple? deprive him of
government for his presu^ptuous usurping the Priestly office, to offer inc^n^e
to the Lord? What needed Theodidact to provoke Papists to bring forth these
examples for the Popes authority two for one, and such as he to answer the^
is driven to very hard shift^? What he says concerning Athalia, Dial. 53.
that she was not lawful Queen but an usurper, he neither proves, nor is it
very proba^ble. 2^ King. ^1. Inuasor fit legitimus Princeps, si successu
temporis populus consentiat and admittat talem. Suarez. de leg. l. 3 c. 4.
She came blodily and unjustly to the Crown, but this does not convince that
she was not afterward righful Queen. They who themselves, or whose ancestors
come to the Crown unjustly, be made Lawful Princs, when they are freely
admitted by the state without debatable contradiction, though perchance some
may survive, that in the sight of God has better right of blood. And no doubt
can be made, but Athalia was admitted with general consent for six years,
when Ioas lay hidden, none standing in open competency against her: That this
consent was not free but enforced, can neither be proved nor clearly confuted.
So Theodidacts solution is grounded upon vncertanity.

But his answer to the second instance about Ozias, Page 50 51.
that the High Priest did not cast him out of the Temple by force, but caused
him to depart by word and admonition only, is much more insufficient, and
hardly can it agree with the text of Scripture, which says that to hinder
Ozias from burning incense, there entered into the Temple together with Azarias
fourscore Priests, ^. Chron. 26.27.
viri fortissimi, stout and valiant men, signifying they went with resolution
to use force and to cast him out (says S. Chrysostom^ not as King but as a
fugitue and ungracious servant. They warned him to desist and to depart, Chry.
hom. 5. de verb. Isa. vidi Dominu^.
whose admonition when he contemned, God incontinently struck him with Leprosy.
His Leprosy the Priests perceived shining in his forehead, before he felt it
himself, and upon sight thereof began out of hand hastily to ^hrust him out:
though, when he ^elt Gods miraculous chastisement upon him, he was as willing
to go, as they to carry him away. So that in the beginning he was drawn, in
the end lead out of the Temple. -- Ducunt volentem fata nolentem trahunt.



Philanax. How might Papists cast him out by force, seeing Chrysostom cited by
Theodidact says, Dial. p. 51. Homil 4^ de verb. I^a. vidi Dominu^.
The office of a Priest is only to reprove, and only to admonish, not to move
arme^ not use buckelers, not to shake a lance, but only to argue, and freely to
admonish.


Aristobulus. The saying of Chrysostom (which Theodidact does so much magnify)
is properly verified, Exodus 3^.28.
not in the Leuiticall Priests who were warriers as other Tribes, Cruentas
refugit vltiones. Leo Ep. 91. and 23.9.8. Can. 1. and seq.
and were chosen to Priestly dignity, for their consecrating their hands to God
in the blood of sinners: But the saying is true of Christian Priesthood whereof
they were figures, which abhors bloody proceedings. But this makes not
against what has been said, that Ozia^ was cast out by force, because the same
Father allows that even Christian Priests, thru^t wicked Kings ou^ of the
Church with their hands, or keep them out forcibly by the interposition of
their body. So did he resist Endoxia Empress, Vita Chrysostom. per Simeon.
Me^aph. to. 1. p 152. Paulin. in ^ius vita and Theodor. l. 8 c. 19.
and S. Ambrose was ready to have used the lik^ force against Theodosius: yea
the same S. Chrysostom highly commends the famous Patriarch of Antioch and
Martyr Babilas for keeping a blo^dy Emperor out of the Church, impacta in
pectus dextera, giving him a thrust on the breast: whereby (says this Father) he
taught the world, Aduersus gentiles s^u ora^ione de ^. Babyla. tom. 5 page 888.
in what degree Priest^ood excels Royalty: he taught Kings to keep their
power within their ^ounds prescribed by God: he taught Priests in what sort
they were to rule and use authority over Kings.


Philanax. I see it can hardly be denied but the Priests cast the King by force
out of the Temple: Dialog. 51. 2. Reg. ^5.
but him (says Theodidact) they did not deprive of his Kingly authority, which
he held to his death: for he ^eigned 52. years: which cannot be true, excep^
the years of his leprosy be recko^ed as part of his reign.


Aristobulus. To this objection of Theodidact S. Chrysostom his ^hosen Patron,
Homil. 4. deverb. Isa. vidi Dominum.
makes answer even in that very homily by him cited, saying that Ozias was
deprived of Royal au^hority, Dialog. ^1. No^ eiecerunt eu^ ^ ciuitate diadema
illius regiamque dignitate^ reueriti, sed consedit in through no ru^su^ lege^
transgrediens.
yet he still retained the execution thereof: because the people out of respect
to his Diadem, and Royal dignity did not execute the sen^ence upon him, so
that he still remained in his house, and sat in the Throne transgressing the
Law. And that the people did grievously offend in not casting the King by
force, from government, the same Father ^estifieth in these words: This their
negligence (says he) provoked God to anger, stopped the course of prophesy:
that I say saw not the Lord, till Ozias was dead. Homil. 4. Irascens Deus
interrup it Iudaeis prophetia^.
And consider the mercy of God that did not for this overthrow the City nor
destroy the inhabitants, but as one friend expostulates with another, so did God
with his people, deserving greater punishment: Homil. 4. and 5.
My people do you fear to expel this impure King? Do you so reverence his
dignity, as to transgress my law? Will you not revenge my quarrel? Nor will
I speak with you. I could my self have cast him out of the City: but what
remained I le^t to be finished by you. I cast him out of my ^emple, he being a
King, you have not put him out of your City. I bound him fast in Leprosy, as
in a chain, and of a King made him a private man^ he being now a private man
you have not set upon him. Whom I condemned you had not courage to cast out.
Thus S. Chrysostom, most clearly teaching the lawful deposition of Princes,
and that subjects not only may but are bound to use force and execute that
sentence upon them, when they are leprous Hanc poena^ rege^ sicut aliu^ e plebe
pati oportebat. Chrysostom.
that is heretical, and for such declared by the Church. And this is peculiar
to ^eresy, which (specially being joined with persecution) is a Hic animi iam

sep^rate themselves from him, in respect of the danger. Which seems a
doctrine so received anciently amongst Christians, that even the Popes who

subject to the Church and deposeable in this case: neither did Henry the
fourth Emperor in his contention with Hidelbrand, or Gregory the seventh,
deny but for heresy he might be deposed. He ple^ded he was no heretic, and
that for other crimes the Pope could not depose him. Ep. ad Gregor. 7. apud
magdebu^. ^^t. 10. c. 8. de schismate. Dialog. 83.
The tradition of Fathers (says he) is that I am to be judged by God alone,
except I have declined from the Catholic faith, which God forbid.

This doctrine of the Papists seems to answer what Theodidact else where
objects, that even the Romanists themselves teach that excommunication not does
free the servant from obedience to his master. For though this be true in
excomunication for other crimes, yet heresy is a crime that ha^h peculiar force
by Christian institution to separate servants and sons from their heretical
Lords and Fathers. Clemens. l. 1. Constit. Apost. c. ^8.
One of the Apostolical ordinations related by S. Clement, is, that Bishops
ought to cast impenitent heretics out of the Church, and command the
faithful not to have any manner of conversation with them. So out of S.
Chrysostom they conclude that Christians may no more endure a Prince declared
heretic by their supreme Pastor, then ^he Jews might suffer a King declared
Leaper by their high Priest, whom they were bound under pain of g^uions sin
to expel as you heard this forsaid Father affirm.


Philanax. I see the old Testament specially according to S. Chrysostomes
exposition, does not very plausibly prove regal independency of Priesthood:
has not Theodidact better arguments out of the new?


Aristobulus. He alleges diverse testimonies, that every soul is to be
subject to the higher powers: Pag^ 55.
Rom 13.
and of Fathers auerring, that there is no state, nor man in the world equal
to the Emperor: Page 60.61
Which particulerly to relate were to wast paper, seeing these testimonies
prove no more; then what P^pists commonly grant. That Kings are Sovereign and
supreme in temporal affairs, within their Dominions, Bellar. l. ^. de Pontif.
c. 19. ^and. l. 2. vi^. mon. c. 4. Persons let. p. 16. n^ 26. and Discuss.
against Barl^ p. 31. Victor. relect. de potest.

Eccl^s sect^ 4. propofi^ 4.


That all men whatsoever, Prophets^ Evangelists, Apostles, Priests, Monks that
live within their states, are subject to their Government, and to the laws
which they make, for the good o^ the Common wealth. They prove that primitive
Ch^^stia^s both laymen and Priests, were bound to pay tribute to the Emperor,
and were in criminal causes answerable before the te^porall Magistrate. For
the dignity of Priestly state, and the special ordinance of Christ exempting
them, was not then sufficiently promulgated, nor accepted of by Princes, as
afterward it was in gratitude for the benefit of their conversion to
Christianity, by the preaching and labors of Priesthood.

The places then of Scriptures and Fathers show, that Priests even Apostles,
were subject to the Emperor in causes temporal: but can any man with reason
think that their testimonies import, that vnbelee^ing Emp^rours were in all
spiritual occurre^ces the soueraign^ Governors of the Christian Church. That
the supreme Pastorship to decide doubts of faith, gather Councels, or
excommunicate disobedient Christians, was committed to them. I think
Protestants will hardely grant this. Whence Papists infer, that had Kings
been ordained by Christ supreme Governors next himself in the Ec^^esiastical
hierarchy, he would have provided Christian Kings to furnish that place in the
first erecting of his Church. Which seeing he did not, they fu^ther deduce that
Kings cannot challenge by Christ's institution any place of government in
Church-affayres: Matt. 16.
that the keys of his Church, signifying supreme authority were by him
delivered not to Kings, but to Peter, by which gift he made him high steward of
his house. Whosoever will be of Christ's family, must yield themselves, their
swords, their Crownes^ subject to Peter's keys. Their souls you will say, but
not their bodies, not their swords, not their Crowns. But against this they
urge that, accessorium sequitur principale: What is accessory and consequent,
still follows and waits upon the principal. The King submitting his person to
the Church must needs likewise submit, together with his person, his Crown
and sword, that not only as men, sed in quantum Reges seruiant Christo, eue^ as
Kings they be servants to Christ. In acknowledgm^^t of which superiority
Constantine as S. Augustine writes) eminentissimum culmen Romani Imperij
diadema suum piscatori Petro subiecit, Epist. 62.
being the most emine^t Sovereign of the Romain Empire, submitted not only his
soul, but his scepter and diadem to the fisherman Peter: to the end that
Peter's keys might direct temporal power toward the consecution of eternal
life, and to restra^ne the same, if at any time the owner thereof should use it,
to the overthrow of Christianity.

They bring an history to this purpose out of Suidas^ concerning Constantius
the Arian, who seems the first that challenged this Supremacy in Church
affairs. As he was says Suidas, ^nce sitting in Council in the midst o^ many
Prelates, Judge of their Controversies, Leontius Suidas verbo Leontius.
the most holy Bishop of Tripolis reproved him openly, that being a secular and
lay man, he would meddle with Church-affaires: which saying made that profane
Emperor to conceive the indecency of the practice, that out of band for very
shame be desisted. If to the fauorits of Kings, ancient Fathers seem over
plain and bitter, who call them that will govern in the Church Antichrists:
so in my opinion we ought to take heed that our Church disgrace not herself,
by being base and servile in this point, laying her Keys under the feet of
Kings, which i^ another extreme. Dial p. 58. and 59.
What may we think of Theodidact who writes that the King saileth to heaven in
his own ship, guided by his own subjects, over whom he is Judge, and may
punish them with death, if he find them (in his opinion) to deliver their own
errors in steed of divine truth. S. Paul were he alive would preach, that the
Church (the ship to convey passengers to heaven) is not the Kings, but Christ's,
which he bought with his precious blood, Art. 20.28.
and the government thereof he committed not to Kings^ but to Bishops. The two
Orthodoxe Saints and Bishops Hosius and Ambrose did they now live, apud
Athan^sium. Apol. 2. Amb. ep^ 33
would say, Palaces belong to Emperors, Churches to Priests. The great
Gregory of Nazianzum were he now living, Naz. orat. ad princip^^ irascente^.
his doctrine would be, that Kings are subject to the tribunal of Bishops,
that Priests are the more eminent Governors, not Kings, subjects in Church
affairs, but as another Gregorye says, S. Greg. ep. ad Herm. Metens. habetur.
d. ^6. can. 9.
their Fathers, Masters and Judges: yea that it is miserable madness ^or Kings
to go about with their wicked laws to make them be at their command, to whom
they know that Christ together with the Keys gave power to bind in heaven and
in earth.

These and the like authorities of Fathers Papists heap together which I have
brought, not that I desire that any thing be detracted from royal authority,
but to the end that you may see, that it is not wisdom to ground Royal
Sovereignty upon this Kingly Church-primacy, which Pro^estants allow, Puritans
detest, Papists with the saying of Fathers shake and batter.


Philanax. Herein I agree with you, Page 63.
yet that the Roman Bishop has not this supremacy to depose Kings, I am moved
to believe, by that which Theodidact writes, Otho ^ri^ing. l. 6. c. 35.
that none of them exercised it before the time of Gregory the VII, otherwise
termed Hildebrand, who excommunicated and deposed Henry the Fo^^th Emperor,
about the year 1073^ more then a thousand years from Christ's ascension, as
Otho Frisingensis, liui^g near those times says: I read and read again the
gestes of the Roman, Kings and Emperors, and no where I find any of them, till
this man Henry the Fourth excommunicated or deposed by the Bishop of Rome.


Aristobulus I do not desire to prove that authority of the Pope, my drift is
to show that Kings Church-primacy is not aduisely brought and placed as the
pillar of their ragall Sovereignty. For, to that, which moves you so much,
behold the Papists how easily, and how many things they answer. First
deposition being an extraordinary remedy against the persecution of heretical
Princes, not to be used, but in cases of ext^emity; what wonder that practices
thereof upon Roman Emperors have not been many? Moreover for the first 300.
years after Christ there was no Christian Emperor on whom that power might be
used. In the other two hundred, the Empire was so mix^d of heathens and
Christians, that this power could not be conveniently exercised. And for other
three hundred years there was no Emperor of the west, but only of the ^ast
residing in Greec^, far from the sight of the Roman Bishops; so that to the
Gre^^an Patriarchs did the charge immediately belong, to proceed with censures,
when they were needful, against Emperors. And against some they proceeded,
though not against all; for some were good Princes deserving well of the
Church, and others that were bad reigned not long, or were not so violent and
incorrigible, as they urged the Church to use the last remedy of deposition.
Finally that some heretics and ^ersecutors, were not deposed, argues not want
of power in Popes, but shows that circumstances of time, and persons might be
such, as either in wisdom and clemency they would not use that power, or else
could not with probability of success, or without danger of greater
inconvenience.

Howbeit the saying of Otho makes as much against the power of excommunication,
as deposition, and is so strong, that I wonder how Theodidact, into his
fundamental discourse for sovereignty (if he meant in deed to make it
^undamentall) would transcribe so notorious an error in history as this is,
Dial. p. 63.
that no Roman Emperor was excommunicated before Henry the Fourth. For,
Eusebius. l. 6. c 25.
to omit what grave Authors write, that Philip a bloody Emperor was
excommunicated by Pope Fabian the first, ^ide Baro. Tom^ 3. anno Domini 357.
Nicephor. l. 3. c. 34. Symmac. Ap^log. ad Anas^as.
Constantius the Arian by Felix the second; who can deny that Arcadius and
Eudoxia Emperors were excommunicated by Innocent the first, for being
accessory to S. Chrysostoms banishment and death? That Anastasius the Eutychia^
Emperor was excommunicated by Pope Symmacus, in a Roman Council, as the said
Pope writing to the Emperor testifies in these words; You say, that the
Senate conspiring with me, I have excommunicated you^ I have done so in deed,
but therein I follow what has be^n done laudably by my ^redecessors before me.
Philippicus the Monothelite was excommunicated by Pope Constantine, who
commanded that the n^me of the Emperor should not be put in my writings
public or private, or set upon any coin, either of brass, silver, or lead.
Leo Isauricu^ was excomunicated by the Gregory's ^econd and third, Marian.
Scot. a. 712. Ado in chronico. Paulus Diaconu^ l. 21. Zonaras To. 3. in vita
Leonis^ Isauric^. Sigeber^ 7^7. Platina in Greg. 3.
and as some say deposed, whereby he lost the Empire of the west. Lotharius
King, and Brother to Lewi^ the second Emperor, was excommunicated by Nicholas
the first, as Otho Frisingensis relates, and praises the Pope for that fact,
calling him a religious Priest, and full of the zeal of God.

Your see how false the saying of Frisingensis is, which you stood so much
upon. What may be the drift of Theodidact who so carefully sets out the sayings
of Authors, which he knows to be most false, and then by force draws Royal
authority to rely upon them. This I leave to your consideration. Nor do I see
why his Majesty should make great account of this title of Supreme head, the
true ^ignification whereof, our authors, when Papists press them with their
arguments, renounce, and which was first usurped upon a known scandalous
occasion, and by ^King, whom not only Papists, but also we Protestants point
forth as a Monster, that (says a late Historian) if the memory of former
Tyrants, and of their cruelties were dead, hi^ reign alone might suffice to
bring them all again to life. Rawley in his story of the world. Preface.


Why should his gracious Majesty run the course of opposition began by this
King, whose name lies buried in disgrace and infamy, and his posterity turned
into rottenesse and dust? especially seeing this King Henry the Eight as he
parted from his noble Father Henry the seventh his affection toward the
Roman Bishop; so likewise ^e degenerated from the love that his said noble
Father bore to his Majesty's family. For it is well known that this first Head
of the English Church sought to cast the hou^e of ^cotland from succession in
the Crown of England, and to prevent the Blessed ^nion of both Kingdoms we
now ^nioy. Which blessing rooted in his Ma^estyes person that it may be
continued in the flourishing perpetuity of his Royal issue, my prayers are,
that they may not be driven by flatterers into needless contention with the
Church against which none ever opposed themselves, that did not either finally
yield, or utterly p^rish.


Philanax. Herein you have fully satisfied me. Now I desire you to come to the
third proposition, and the second pillar of sovereignty devised by Theodidact:
Dial. p. 67.
That Tyranny, Infidelity, Heresy, or apostasy be not sufficient causes to
release subjects o^ their obedience to their sovereigns.


Aristobulus. Had you not put me in mind, I should willingly have forgotten
this question. I cannot commend their wisdom that cause or permit Treatises
that plead for the impunity of tyrants, to be set forth by his Majesty's
special authority. Will any man think this impunity would be so eagerly
defended, were it not also loved and desired? or loved for mere speculations
sake, not for the use and ex^rcise thereof? It is enough for private men (as
said a prudent Liuia apud Dion in Augusto.
Emp^^sse to her husband) that they be innocent, but Princes seeing they govern
not brute beasts but men, must also procure not to be suspected: specially in
matter of Tyrany, wherein subjects are naturally jealous, and apt to think the
worst upon any light occasion. Sometimes weak denyalls be taken as graunts.
Kings that couldly detest tyranny, may soon be suspected to love it. Some kind
of sins may never be named, without great show of execration, some may not be
named at all, there being no words that can sufficiently express the horror,
that when they are named must wait upon them. Ne coram populo natos Medaea
trucidet.
Hence it is, that the rules of Tragedy command that bloody and barbarous
murders be not represented on the strage, nor related without tragical
declamations against them. Indignatur enim priuatis ac prope socco
Digni^ carminibus narrare scaena Thyesta.


This being the suspicious disposition of men; Dial^ p. 75.
what may we think of Treatises set forth by authority^ wherein the bloudiest
cruelties be related without horror; yea their Authors be named as worthy of
honor, not as monsters, dese^^ing banishment from the face of the earth, and
memory of mankind? What is this but to cast suspicions that his Majesty
secretly affects such courses, and could find in his heart that most merciles^e
tyranny might reign i^punely? Wherein the wrong done him is exceeding great,
his grations disposition being as far, from loving Tyranny, as his happy Reign
from the ex^rcise of it.


Philanax. His Majesty's known clemency, and inna^ed auersion from blood,
abundantly confirms what you say. Nor does he stand upon this total impunity
of Princes, that he would have true tyrants live uncontrolled: but because
Common People are so lightheaded and unstayed, that if they b^ permitted to
resist their Prince in any imaginable case of tyranny, they will when they are
displeased with him^ though without cause, straight imagine that then is the
cause of lawful resistance.


Aristobulus. We cannot deny, but this is the disposition of vulgar multitudes,
which shows the wonderful vncertanity of humane greatness, and the great
dependence that Kings have on God, in whose hands only are the hearts of the
people, so l^kewise the scepters of kings. God thought best to permit many
lamentable examples of Commonwealths cruelties against their Kings, partly to
terrify the ambition of mankind, over greedy of that honor, partly for the
punishment in this life of wicked governors, partly for the benefit of good
Kings, that they might be more frequently mindful of ^eath and of the judgment
conseque^t thereupon. As Kings have extraordinary license and incitements to
offend, so the divine wisdom to curb that liberty, has provided them
besides the dangers of common mortality, special reasons to fear death, and
to be ready for their final account. The remedy which The^didact has invented
against this mischief, to wit, that this doctrine be continually beaten into
Subjects ears, that they are bondmen to their Princes without any means of
redemption, or liberty to run from them, how c^uell soever they become
toward them: this remedy (I say^) cannot prevent, but may rather accelerate
the danger. Seneca writes that in his time there were such store of slaves in
Rome, Li^^ius de magnif. Romans l. 1. c^ 16.
that the Senate having made an edict that they should wear a certain mark,
whereby they might be discovered from freemen, ^hey were glad straight to recall
it, see^ng the danger that might ensue, if ^laues should begin to compare
their multitudes with the paucity of their Masters. Subjects being many in
^umber, it is not secure to sound still ^his lesson in their ears, that they
are slaves by the condition of their birth bound to endure any horrible
cruelties at the Princes pleasure. For first put case they be persuaded that
the commonwealth may not in such cases resist without sin, but are bound all
one after another to go quietly to the slaughter: yet the fear of offending
God will hardly be strong enough to restrain them from seeking liberty. For
seeing by the practice of former times it is known that liberty gotten
sinfully, being now gotten is continued rightfully; they will rather choose to
sin once then to be slaves ever. Secondly men are so strongely by nature
inclined to favor their own liberty^ that well may Conquerers compel them by
force of arms to endure, but never will Doctor by s^rength of argument
convince them to think that nature has created the^ for such ^lauery, that
by right of birth one family may tyranniz without co^trollement, a^ others
being borne to suf^er without releef, or without any lawful power to resist.
Wisdom would have such ha^efull. Doctrines kept from common people which do
rather stir passion then persuade patience. The dire^ull apprehension of the
miseries of such slavery, will be more potent to awake auersion from kings in
Subjects, then any preten^ed reasons from nature, scripture or history to allay
i^, though those reasons were clear and plentiful in this point. The best
course then is not to drive people into despair, and into desperate atte^pts
by utter denial of remedy against cruel and merciless tyrants, but ^o to
moderate matters, as to remove the life and state of Kings as much as may be,
from popular rashness.

And this course of moderation I know not any that do more exactly observe
then the Papists, whom Theodidact singled out to be his adversaries. I will
breefly declare what they hold in this point, not standing upon the truth of
their doctrine, but only how honorable to Kings it is, and with what wisdom
they have found out ^ safe and moderate course between Scilla and Charibdis,
without declyning to ^auour, in their doctrine, either the rashness of common
people, or the cruelty of tyrannons Princes. Mol. de iustit. and iure tom^ 1.
tract. 2. disp. 23.
First then they teach that the King is Superior over the whole Commonwealth,
not only over every particular subject and company. They disallow the Puritan
doctrine, that the people have the same power over Kings, that the King has
over every one person. Dangerous positions l. 1. c. 4. vide Richard. Ha^lum de
necessit. and dignit. vnius Regis. c. 6.
They say also that the King in the necessity of the Commonwealth, and the
state of the people so requiring, may do things contrary to the laws,
liberties and privileges: that he may impose extraordinary tributs, inflict
extraordinary punishments, not merely for his lust, but for the good of the
Commonwealth. Finally the King is to judge when the necessity of this
extraordinary proceeding occurreth, nor are bounds to be prescribed to hi^
royal privileges. This doctrine gives ample power to the King, whereby he may
both do many things very extraordinary justly, and teaches people that they
^asily condemn not their Prince of tyranny, though his dealing with them be
severe and rigorous

Secondly they teach that Kings are free from bonds of laws, Aquinas 1.2. q.
96. art. 5. ad 3. Suares de leg. l. 3. c. 37. and alij.
so as they may not be called to account nor punished, much less deposed for
ordinary and personal offenses, or for their deeds iniurio^s only to few. And
hereupon they detest this proposition of Puritans, Dangerous posit. l. 1. c. 1.
Judges ought by the law of God to summon Princes before them for their crimes,
and to proceed against them as against all other offenders: So that the
Commonwealth cannot by the doctrine of Papists remove the Prince from
government, but for crimes exorbitant which tend to the destruction of the
whole state, nor then neither^ except (all other remedies being first tried to
reclayme him) he be found obstinate and incorrigible in his tyranous course.

And this shows the sillines of Theodidacts discourse, Page 67.
who would prove that Kings may not in any case be deposed, because Saul being a
bloody tyra^t who murdered 800. Priests at once, 1. Sam. 22.18.19. 1. Sam.
24.12 and 2^.23. 1. Sam. 24^
and persecute David, was not killed by David nor deposed, when he fell into
his hands. But in this argument neither is the inference good, that no tyrant
can be deposed, because Saul, a tyrant was not deposed: nor is the instance
true, seeing Saul was not properly a tyran^. The cruelty that makes a tyrant,
must be both obstinate without hope of relenting, and universal tending to the
destruction of the whole state: which circumstances were in neither of these
deeds of Saul. His murdering so many innocent Priests, was indeed a public
calamity and cruelty, yet therein he was not obstinate, but soon relented, not
persecuting Priests in the rest of his reign. His malice towarde^ David was
mortal and invincible, bu^ that was not so general, being confined to one man
and his followers^ for the rest Saul was an administer of justice, and a
defender of the common good, for which he lost his life.

Thirdly they teach, Bourchier de iusta abdicatio^e. Less. de inst. l. 2. c. 9.
lub. 4.

Sess. 15^ Dang. posit. l. 2. c. 1.


that Princes^ thoug^ they be manifest and incorrigible tyrants, ye^ may not be
deposed, much less made away with out public sentence, and a inridicall
releasme^^ of his Subiect^ from their obedience. This their doctrine is defined
in the Council o^ Constance against the ancient Purita^nisme of John
VVicklif^e, renewed in thi^ age by John Calvin, and his followers, holding,
that a private man having some special inward motion, may kill a Tyrant.
Wherefore so long as the Commonwealth does endure the tyrant, Page 72.74.75.
and not deprive him by public sentence, so long private men must endure him,
must obey him willingly and for conscience sake. 1 P^t. 2.16.18.
Thus the Fathers cited by Theodidact persuaded Christians to ob^y the ancient
persecuting Emperors that were tyrants. Thus S. Peter, as also Theodidact
largely urges, commanded the believing Iewe^ to obey Claudius a bloody and
barbarous Emperor: which must be understood in things not against justice and
religion, and so long as the tyranous E^perour should be tolerated by the
Commonwealth. For who will think that S. Peter by that his exhortation meant,
that they should obey Claudius further then for the time he should be admitted
as lawful Prince? who can wi^h any probability im^gine that S. Peter by that
sentence decided the controversy between the Rom^n Emperor and the Senate,
about the right of making and deposing Emperors: and that he defined in
behalf of ^he Emperor that he might no^ be deposed by the Sen^te? and that in
case of deposition Christians were still to obey the deprived, not the new
erected magistrate? I cannot think S. Peter did desire, that Christians in
those times should busy their heads with these speculations, but simply for
conscience sake obey the present Prince they found allowed in the state wherein
^hey lived, so long as he was permitted to rule. It would go hard with Kings,
if their condition were like the Emperor; Apolog. pro reg. c. 4.
seeing the greatest patro^^ of Kings dare not deny what Emperors themselves
have acknowledged that they may be deposed by the Senate or Peers of the
Empire. Vestri iuris esse fatemur (o principes) imperatore^ creare, simul and
destituere Naucler. genesis 41. an. ^^12. in O^h. 4.
So that these exhortations of Apostles and Fathers to obey tyranous Princes
for the time they be tolerated by the Commonwealth, which Theodidact urges so
diffusely, come short of proving that Princes are in all cases indeposable.

Fourthly the Papists hold that the sentence of deposition must not only be
given by a public magistrate, but also by the whole magistracy and nobility
of the Commonwealth, or by the far greater part thereof. And for this cause
(they say) that neither Julian the Apostata, nor Constantius, nor Valens Arian
Emperors were deposed, which Theodidact exaggerateth as an argument of great
moment to prove that Christians ca^ use no forcible resista^ce against
persecuting Princes. But the cause why these heretical Em^erours were not
deposed, cannot be proved to have been want of authority in the Church, but
because there wa^ted at that time means to unite the whole Empire in the
business of deposing heretical Emperors. For from the time of Constantine to
the sack of Rome by Alaricus, heat^ens and infidells did abound through the
whole Roman Empire, many of them bearing chief offices even in the Senate, who
could not be brought nor commanded to concur against Emperors for their
heresy or apostasy: so that the attempts of Catholics to depose them could then
have had no other success, but faction and civil war. Nor could the
sentence of the supreme pastor unite them in that enterprise, seeing a great
part of the Empire were Infidells (as has been said) and so not the Popes
subi^cts.

But when the Commonwealth consists of only Christians, then heresy and
apostasy of the Prince joined with persecution ought to breed in them all, a
general dislike thereof: and the sentence of their spiritual Pastor
challenges like^ise universal obedi^nce; so that if factio^s grow amongst
them, the fault is not in the cause which is common to all, nor in the sentence
which b^ndeth them all, but in themselves that are neither zealou^ in their
Religion, nor obedient to the Church. He that shall consider wha^ orthodoxe
Fathers have written against Constantius the Arian, will soon^ perceive that
the Bishops of the primitive Church were sharp censurer^ of heretical
Princes. They rebuke Haec conspicis huiusmodi quae te iubent honorari
intelligis: quae vero sacrae littere iube^t te facere illa in quibus te mone^t
sacerdotibu^ obedire, fingis non n^sse. Lucifer. de no^ parcendo in Deu^
delinque^t. fol. ^97.
him for gathering together places o^ Scripture, that command that he b^
honored and obeyed, omitting other testimonies that give liberty to resist and
bind him to obey his spiritual Pastors. They tell him in playn^ terms
Lucifer vbi supra p. 255.
they might deal with him as the Machabees did with Antiochus who^ they
resisted, his armies they overthrew, cast him from the Kingdom of Jury. I tell
thee Constan^ius (says one of those Fathers) had thou been in the hands of
Ma^tathias that zealous priest, so wicked a persecutor as thou art he would
have killed thee: Thus bouldy writes that Bishop, which shows that the reason
why Aria^ Emperors in those days were not deposed, was not want of just desert
in the Princes, nor of power in the Church, but because the sentence would not
conioyne the whole Commonwealth being then mixed of heathens and Christians, in
the execution thereof, so that the sentence could not be lawfully executed
without the asistance of some absolute temporal Prince. And this assistance
the primitive Church in those days did not neglect Socrates l. 2. c. 18.

Theodor. l. 2. c. 8. Sozomen. l. 9. c. 1. Niceph l. 9. c^ 21.


to crave of Constantine the most pious and Christian Emperor who took upon
him the protection of Catholic Bishops that were banished by his Arian Brother
( Constantius) to whom he sent word, that unless he would restore them,
Hostem se illi fu^urum, nec quicquam nisi bellum expectandum: that he would
become his enemy, and that he should expect nothing from him but war. And as
for Julian the Apostata, I do fearfully relate what they write. For whereas by
some it had been given out that he was by a Christian soldier deprived both of
Empire and life, Theodoretus l. 3. Histor. c. 20. Nazian. orat. 2. in Iul.
Chrysostom. orat. in S. Babylam. Sozom. vbi supra.

Nicephor. l. 10. c. 34.


they magnify the stroke whosoever were the Author thereof. And some Christian
historia^s grant that, it is not incredible that some Christian souldyer
killed Julian, and defend the fact as most glorious, seeing (say they) not only
Pagans, but all men of what religion soever, eue^ to our age have allwaies
exalted them that have taken away tyrants, venturing their lives for the
liberty of their kindred and country: how much more glorious is it to do this
for God and Religion? These sayings and the like may be found in the writings
of the Ancients, which I do not bring as approving them; yea this last of
private undertaking against Emperors I utterly mislike. But this shows what
I pretend, that it were better wholly to relinquish the discussion of this
controversy, then to provoke men to produce these authorities, Mutatio regnorum
quae no^ interposito sedis Apostolicae iudicio fit, non legitime sed seditiose
fit. Sanderus de vi^ib. Monarch. page 406. Mol. de iure. to. 1. tra. 2. disp.

Sanderu^ vbi supra.


and that they be not wise, or not friends of the King that will needs be
stirring in this business.

Fifthly Papists teach that a Christian Commonwealth may not proceed against
their Christian Prince, though he be a tyrant, without the advice an^ consent
of the supreme Pa^stor of their souls. This they require not only in the case
o^ heresy and Apostasy, but also when subjects are moved against them for
tyranous oppression of their lives and temporal state. And their reason is
because deposition being an affair of singular moment^ ought to be done wi^h
the grea^est advise and deliberation that may be. Nor is it secure to commit
the cause to the sole Commonwealth, least the people out of passion, the Nobles
out of ambition, be ouerforward to proceed against Prince^. So that in my
opinion Papists take a most mature course, and remove the life of Kings from
the temerity of vulgar affections, one degree further then any other religion
whatsoever. And seeing mankind with universal consent seem to allow that some
means may be used for the commonwealths safety against incorrigible and
deplored tyrants: I do not see that humane wisdom could have invented a
proceeding more discreet and moderate then this of Papists, who, that a Prince
may be deposed lawfully, require: First cryme^ manifest, that can no ways be
excused: secondly crimes exorbitant, tending to the evident overthrow of the
whole Kingdom: thirdly cryme^ with malice, incorrigible, leaving no hope of
amendment: fourthly the public and vuiuersall agreement of magistrates and
Nobles of the Commonwealth. Fifthly that the case be proposed, and the
deposition approved by their supreme Pastor, and his Counsel abroad.

Finally, to prevent popular rashness, they further add, that the comonwealth in
the execution of the sentence, must proceed per modum defensionis, non per
modum punitionis, Molin. to^ ^. de iustit. tract. 2. dis. 23. number. 8.
by way of their own defense, not by way of punishing their Prince. And in
this their defense they must observe moderamen inculpatae tutelae, Dang. pofit.
l. 1. c. 4.
that is, they must do no more then is precisely necessary for their own
defense. Card. Perons Oration, Eng^^s^ ^. 108.109.
Wherefore they may not, having deposed their Prince, arraigne him, as Puritans
teach, that being needless for their own safety. The King deposed still
retaynes a certain remote right to the Crown, as it were a mark, or politic
character that discerns him from mere subjects: by reason whereof, if he
repent of his Apostasy, and give the Commonwealth good security that being
again restored to government, he will rule moderately, the Commonwealth may not
by taking way his life deprive him of his possibility.


Philanax. Your discourse gives me great content to see that Papists in their
doctrine, provide so carefully for the security of Princes. That a King be
deposed lawfully they require such a general consent both domestical and
foreign, that it seems scarce possible that so many should conspire in
passion, or that any Prince, by this doctrine, loose his Kingdom that is
either friended abroad or beloved at home. For if the motion to depose the
Prince arise from the Commonwealth, Executio no^ ad Po^tifice^ pertinet sed ad
alios. Be^l. aduersus Bark. 6.10^ Cardinal. Peron. ora. page 106.
the last decision thereof is referred to the Pope and his Counsel that are
forrayners, and not interessed in the Commonwealthes quarrel. If the treaty of
depo^ition begin from the Pope, the execution must pass through the hands of
the Peers of the Realm spiritual and temporal, whose love to their Prince
will resist the Popes sentence if they find the motive either openly unjust, as
grounded upon temporal pretenses, or not clearly and apparently just, as is
required in a point of so many consequences. Nor do there want examples of
Catholic Kingdoms that have stood for their Kings, when they thought that
Popes were moved with humane respects: yea I have noted in the histories I have
perused, and much wondered thereat. Protestants have been more forward and
heady to follow the sentence of some Ministers or consistory against their
Prince, then have Papists been in obeying the Popes censures for the
deposition of their King, that hardly can you name any sentence of deposition
that has been executed, and the Prince turned from his Crown by his Catholic
subjects. Which difference seeing it cannot spring from any greater reverence,
which Protestants b^a^e to their spiritual governors (for it is known they do
not so much esteem their Ministers, as the Papists do their Priests) it must
proceed from this cause, that Papists loyal love to their Prince does somewhat
allay their prompt obedience to the Pope, when between him and their Prince
contentions happen. But you have so discovered the weakness of Theodidacts
arguments, that I have more cause to fear treason then expect reason in his
discourses. I should have been glad if the doctrine that makes Kings in all
cases indeposable could have been proved by solid and invincible arguments.


Aristobulus. How solid and invincible Theodidacts arguments are, you may give
a guess, by this one which he urges very ^arnestly, that Christians may not
depose Tyrants though never so cruel enemies of their Religion, because Christ
commands the^ to love their enemies and per^^cutors. And verily I could
smile to see Theodidact seriously dilate upon the precept to love enemies: We
must (says be) love them with our hearts, bless and pray for them with our
tongues, and do good to them by our actions. If these duties be to be performed
twards private men that are our enemies: how much more to public persons and
Potentats of the earth. Thus he, and much more, showing great want of judgment
thus to trifle in so serious an argument. For the precept to love our enemies,
and to bestow benefits on them, urges the Commonwealth to depose tyrants
rather then to the contrary. For what greater benefit can Christian charity
bestow on tyrants that run headlong to everlasting perdition, then to remove
them from government, from the world, and occasions of sin. Without doubt the
precept of Charity would bind the Commonwea^th to ^tay the damnation of tyrants
by deposing the^, did Justice permit them that are not Superiors to bestow
benefits and deeds of charity upon others against their will. The truth is, that
this were against Justice, though not against Charity, to take by force the
scepter from a Prince, who abuses the same only to his own damnation, without
endaungering the Commonwealth. But if he commit synns that tend to the
destruction of the state; if (says the Chancellor of Paris) the great Patron
of royal imunity, if the Prince does manifestly, obstinatly, really, and
unjustly persecute his subjects, the^ that Principle of the law of nature taks
place, violence may be repelled with violence. Thus much Gerson, and much more
which I willingly pretermit: nor would I have said so much, but only to show
that it were best not to handle these questio^^, specially in vulgar Treatises:
and that you may see Theodidacts fraud, who loadeth on Kings many new titles,
that are not so glorious as odious, which do not so much adorn as oppress,
and weigh down Kings, by laying upon them the heavy burden of popular envy.
Such is his fourth proposition which remaynes to be examined, Page 88.
that there is no remedy besides tears and prayers, that may be law^ully used
for the defense of the Church against the King, though he should be so tyrannous
and profane as to oppress the whole Church, and utterly to extinguish the
light of Christian Religion.


Philanax. The very sound of this proposition offends a Christian ^are, nor
can I think it is grateful to his Majesty, who would (I dare say) wish
himself dead a thousand times, rather then such a case should really happen,
that he should extinguish the light of Religion, so little delight he takes that
men should adore his Royal Dignity vested in these imaginary impieties. Nor
does Theodidact bring any proof thereof besides the patience of the Jews, when
they were persecuted by Aman, who won Assuerus to send forth a decree to
destroy their whole nation both young and old, children and women in one day.
Here (says he) the whole visible Church which was only amongst the Jews, Page
8^.
by the barbarous designements of Assuerus seemed to be in the very jaws of
death, Esther. 4.
yet they take no arms, they consul^ not how to poison Assuerus, or Aman, they
animate no desperate person suddenly to stab them, but there was only great
sorrow am^ngest them, and fasting and weeping.


Aristobulus. It is not probable that Aman had grant to murder the whole
nation of the Jews, but only all those that were out of their Country
scattered in the Towns of the Persian Monarchy, whom Aman, Esth. c. 3.8.
speaking with Assuerus, terms a people dispersed through all the Provinces
of the Empire, and divided one from another, besides which there was a
flourishing Church in Jury. Secondly whereas Theodidact says, that amongst the
Jews in that extremity there was sorrow and fasting, and weeping only; that
only he adds of his own head against Gods express word, which besides these
means to appease Gods anger, sets down other secondary means they used
for their deliverance; for they better informed Assuerus, deceived by Amans
sinister suggestions, using as instrument the Qu^ene that was so gracious in
his sight: resolved also to use other helps had that failed them, as
Mardochaeus sent a message to Esther^ per aliam oc^asionem liberabu^tur Iudaei,
by some other way the Jews s^albe released. Neither may we doubt but the Jews
(had they been able) might and would have resisted Assuerus, had he invaded
their Country with intention to destroy them. For they might have done to him
what their Ancestors did to his Persian predecessor, as In ^hronico.
Eusebius l^ ^. de Ciuit. c. 26
S Augustine, l. ^ Sacrae histor.
Sulpitius, l. de sex aetatibus.
Beda and other Fathers hold, that Nabuch^d^noso^ was, that sent an army
against them under the conduct of Holofernes, whom they resisted, as it is well
known, with miraculous success. I do not examine the truth of their opinion^
whether Nabuchodonosor were in deed a Persian Emperor, but I note the judgment
of the learned Christian antiquity, that they held it lawful for the people of
the Jews to use forcible resistance against their tyrannous Sovereign:
neither does any Father or Doctor reprove their opinion in this respect. And in
what writings of Christian Fathers be not the Machabees renowned that valiantly
opposed themselves against Antiochus persecuting the^ for Religion, who was
their lawful Prince? whose ancestors had peaceably enjoyed Sovereignty over
Jury from the time of Seleucus, for the space of an hundred and forty years,
and were acknowledged by Priest and people as much as ever Persian or Roman
Emperors were?

And if we call to mind Christian histories, we shall find that as soon as
the te^porall sword was put into the hands of a Christian Monarch, the
Christian Church craved the assistance thereof against Licinius the persecuting
Emperor. Constantine went to succor the Christians of the East whom Licinius
persecuted. D^ vita Constant. l. 2. c. 3.
Being persuaded (says Eusebius) that it was a great deed of piety and
sanctity to relieve a great multitude of men, by deposing of one man from
government. In which enterprise God did miraculously concur to give him
victory, and Christian Bishops assisted him, which they would not have done had
they thought no means lawful of seeking liberty from persecution of tyrants,
besides tears and prayers. Clodou^us the first Christian King of France,
Paulus AEmil. l. 1. in Clodouaeo r^g^.

and slew their Prince in the battle with his own hand, having no other
quarrel then Religion against him. When Basiliscus the Nestorian Emperor went
about to compel Catholic Bishops to condemn the Council of Chaldedon,
Acatius Patriarch of Constantinople stirred up both people and monks against
him, went to the Emperor, freely reproved his impiety, that out of fear he
was glad to recall his Edict. Anastasius not many years after Emperor,
Nicephor. ^.26. cap. 26
friend of the Manichees and Arians, gathered a synod, and sought to constrayne
the Patriarch of Constantinople to condemn the Council of Chalcedon: The
people straight in troops came to the place o^ meeting crying^ Now is the time
of Martyrdom: Constant. Manas. p. 80.
Let no man depart from his Pastor: They reviled the Emperor, they called him
Manichee and unworthy to be Prince: so that frighted to see the whole multitude
re^use his government, he then gave over his enterprise. Ibid.
And when afterward relapsed again into his impiety, he sent soldiers to
Jerusalem to cast Catholic Bishops from their sea, the Bishop and the two
Abbots Sabbas and Theodo^ius (men most orthodoxe and of miraculous sanctity)
gathered forces, and in the hearing of the Emperors officer, excommunicated
Nestorius and Eu^iches and their adherents, they drove the soldiers by force
out of the Church, and their Captain to save his life was glad to run away.

Many the like examples might be laid together out of antiquity, Nicephor. l.
16. cap. 3^
which show that, though tears, serious repentance, and prayers to God be the
best the cheifest and readiest remedies, without which no other ordinarily
prevail;) yet the Fathers judged that some forcible means may with due
circumstances be lawfully used, rather then the light of Christian Religion
should be extinguished, or at least this is clear, that this practice may be
so confirmed by examples of Christian antiquity, that I cannot judge it wisdom
to make these questions the common subject of discourse to the vulgar
multitude. The only way to abate the estimation of things that by themselves
are exceeding precious, is to compare them with other that incomparably exceed
them in worth. Mortal life compared with eternity grows into contempt: stars
shine not in the presence of the sun: great rivers seem nothing in respect
of the ocean. The splendour of royal Majesty and power is as it were a sun
shining among his subjects, the readiest way to make the sun seem dymme in a
piou^ and religious sight, is that which Theodidact uses, to compare the King
and allegiance with God and religion, before whom even Angelical purity is
darkness, and all created greatness put together, no more then one drop of
morning dew in respect of the main sea. Canstant. Manasses in annalibus^ p. 80.
A learned Greci^n writes that a pious man cannot respect his Prince, when he
sees the cause of Religion in danger: then he neither regards person nor
dreadeth power how sovereign soever it be. Dangerous positions c. ^. p. 33.
Our writers think it an excuse of our first ^hospellers rebellion, that the
light of the Gospel ^hining in their eyes, made them not see the majesty and
greatness of Popish Princes whom they threw from their thrones. What wonder the^
if men that have zeal of Religion, do stagger at the allegiance we exact of
them, seeing we openly require them to profess that the light of Christianity
may be utterly extinguished, rather then the Prince resisted.


Philanax. You have showed that Theodidacts four propositions are ungrounded,
and odious, and no sure foundations of sincere and dutiful allegiance: But you
promised also to speak of the Oath of Allegiance, which Theodidact says,
stands upon these grounds, and what your opinion is concerning of rigorous
urging thereof.


Aristobulus. I cannot believe that the cheef inciters of his Majesty to the
violent exaction of this Oath, do so much respect the common good, as their
private interest, being men that live and triumph by the temporal miseries and
calamities of Papists. When the desperate rage and temerity of some few of that
profession had justly exasperated his Majesty, these their enemies that lay in
wait to do them a mischief, suggested this devise, which I cannot be persuaded
that his singular wisdom and judgment would ever have liked but in these
circumstan^s of perturbation^ I will not rashly precipitate my censure in a
matter of such consequence, and wherein his excellent Majesty is so much
engaged: only I will offer unto your serious cogitation five considerations,
which often present themselves unto me, and make me much doubt how this
rigorous course of urging the Oath of Allegiance can stand with conscience, or
with true policy, or with clemency, or with his Majesty's honor or safety.
First how can we with safe con^cience urge me^ to swear what eue^ according to
the principles of our Religion, is uncertain? Not only they that swear what
they know to be false commit perjury, but such also as swear wha^ they know
not to be certain: because in swearing a thing that may be false, they go in
danger to make God witness of falsehood. A truth so clear that it was known
to a profane Poet, who setts it down in verse, that might beseem a
Christian. -- Ambiguae si forte citabere testis
Incertae que rei, Phalaris licet imperet vt sis
Falsus, and admoto dictet periuria Tauro,
Summu^crede nefas anima^ prefer pudori.


The doctrines sworn in the Oath cannot be more certain then the principles
whence they are drawn: as the walls cannot be more firm then the foundation
whereon they stand. Now if you call to mind the pillars of the Oath laid by
Theodidact, you shall find they are at least doubtful propositions which not
only Papists, but our Doctors are divided about. Yea for the most part both
sides agree that they are false. Let Protestants then think how with safe
conscience they swear, and v^ge others to swear the things, which being
grounded upon principles uncertain, cannot be certain.


Philanax. I have heard that VVidderington and some other Papists think the
taking of the Oath lawful, because they judge the opinion, That the Pope may
not depose Kings, probable, and tolerable among Catholics: these men also
swear upon a probability.


Aristobulus. VVidderington and his adhere^ts seem to be Theodidacts
Cosen-germans, and with him secretly undermine the Oath of Allegiance, whereof
they would be thought great friends: For either they commit perjury in swering,
or else elude the drift of the Oath. If they swear the thing it self, that the
Pope wants that power, they that have but a probable persu^sion thereof be
forsworn; seeing they swear what they do not know certainly to be true. If
they say that they swear not the thing it self, but only that they have an
acknowledgment and belief thereof, and that this is true, seeing they feel a
pr^pable asse^t to the points of the Oath; this answer cleereth the^ from
pe^iury, but together takes from the Oath force to bind them. For if a man that
only probably believes that the Pope cannot depose King^ may take the Oath
without being forsworn; then the Oath in the swearer requires only a probable
persuasion of that point, and if only probable, then changeable upon better
advise: for liberty to change is necessarily implied in a probable assent,
seeing no law can exact that our speculatiue persuasion, be more certain and
immovable the^ reason and argument is able to make it. He that taks the Oath
as a point of faith if he swear truly, ca^ never alter his judgment therein
without being forsworn, because unlawfulness to change being inuolued in the
assent of faith, he that swears belief for the present, swears consequently
he will never afterward cha^g. But he that swears I acknowledge and believe the
Pope cannot depose the King, meaning no more then I probably believe, though
he swear truly ye^ he may within three days or sooner change his mind without
perjury: for neither did he swear expressly that he would never change, nor did
the nature of the assent he professed, implicitly bind him never to change.

And if this proposition, the Pope has no power to depose the King, which is
the foundation of all the other parts in the Oath, be sworn as probable, upon
better advise changeable, who sees not that the whole frame of Allegiance that
is built thereon, is left to the arbitrament of the swearer, and that by
VViddringtons doctrine the drift of the Oath, to make his Majesty secure, is
overthrown. I add hereunto that if the Oath be satisfied with a probable
persuasion that the Pope cannot depose the King; then the Oath leaves liberty
to the Papist that swears, to follow with safe conscience the contrary in
practice, seeing they may, by common consent of their Deuines, follow what
probable opinion they please: yea they may without sin follow that opinion
which they themselves think less probable. Which is to be understood when the
Authors that allow the speculation of a doctrine, do not themselves condemn
the practice thereof, as sometimes they do, because the doubtfullnes of the
speculation makes the practice clearly against Charity or Religion, or Justice,
as in the instances that VViddrington brings in his last reply. But no instance
can he give when both speculation and the practice is allowed as probable by
grave authors, that then Papists may not follow the same with a safe
conscience. And such is the doctrine, that the Pope may depose Kings, their
schools that allow the speculation, condemn not the practice. If then
VVidrington taking the oath of Allegiance may without breach of his Oath think
the contrary doctrine, that the Pope may depose Kings, probable, he may with
the Oaths good leave, by the principles of his Religion, also follow that
doctrine in practice: so that swearers upon probabilities b^ cunninger, but no
better subjects then other Catholics that refuse the Oath.

I conclude, that either we tender the new Oath to no purpose, or else we urge
men further then in conscience they can swear. If we require but a weak and
probable assent? what assurance does his Majesty gain when the swearer may
change his opinion at his pleasure, or retayning his opinion fo^low the
contrary in practice? If we require firm and immutable assent, how can that
assent be sure, the principles and means thereof being doubtful? ^ow ca^ we
with good conscience force men to swear that doctrine to be certain which we
know depends upon points, disputable in our Church?

The second thing I present unto you to be considered, concerns the politic
drift and intent of the Oath, which is to discover faithful subjects from
those that are disloyally minded: may we not in true policy fear the Oath
works the contrary effect? For may not loyal subjects refuse it upon
persuasion that some point of Religion is therein indirectly denied? May not
they that bear traiterous hearts take it, notwithstanding their intended
treasons, not fearing to commit perjury in Gods sight?


Philanax. You put me in mind of another doctrine of Theodidact, which seems
to me strange, that men though most ^rayterous, in taking an Oath will not
dissemble. Page 48.
God (says he) by his imediate ^inger does so straightly oblige with secret
terror, ^he most inmost conscience, that men obdurate ^o other grievous synns,
will be tender and sen^^ble of the violation of an Oath. Hence he ^eemeth to
infer, that eue^ the gunne-^owder traitors would not have taken ^^e Oath, but
rather have missed of ^^eir design, and that all who refuse (...), are of the
same mind and stamp ^^at they were.


Aristobulus. This divinity of ^heodidact, which seems the ground of urging
the Oath, is against the rules of true policy and wisdom. First it lays the
burden of infamons disloyalty on tender consciences, giving away the praise of
fidelity to m^n that may be void of Religion and dissembling swearers. Secondly
it goes about to blind his Majesty's eyes, and lull his Counsel a sleep
toward subtle and dangerous traitors, that go on the ground of that
reacherons Thebean, Children are to be deceived with apples, but men with
^athes.

Thirdly he goes against the consent of all well-ord^ed Commonwealths, which
in trial of life and death use not to put men to purge themselves by Oathe,
fearing they will swear untruly to save their lives, which fear were needles
did they believe that God in taking of an Oath did so perpetually constrayne
the inmost conscience of obdurate sinners t^ be tender in that point. De
menda^io ad Consent. c. 22.
S. Augustine i^ deed says, that some unchaste women whi^^ have not feared to
deceive their husbands by wantonness, have been afraid to use God unto them as
a witness of their chastity; but these were women perchance very few: and if
in those times so tender a conscience was incident to all, or most unchaste
wives; I dare say ^hey were more Godly and timorcus ^hen the adulteresses of
these days, amongst whom perchance very few may be found that will loose
their lives, rather then delude their husbands with an Oath. Howsoever, carnal
sin, the motive whereof is fleeting pleasure, does not so root out
conscience, and obdurate the heart, as treasons and conspiracies against King
and Country, which whosoever harbour^th in his heart, it is a miracle if he be
tender in violating of an Oath. And what Theodidact ^eigneth to make the
refusers of the Oath odious, that those phanaticall plotters would rather have
lost their lives, then have dissembled in an Oath, their best friends will
hardly believe they were worthy of so great praise. Wherefore men that are more
timorous of a false Oath, then of the loss of their life, should least of all
be suspected to have consciences capable of so vast treason as is the blowing
up Parlaments with powder. Anacharsis compared the Athenian laws to the
spiders web, wherein flies are caught, but greater beasts without difficulty
break through them: so the Oath of Allegiance catches some scrupulous women,
and t^^orous Papists, but great Traitors, that ca^ without scruple plot and
contriue bloody massacres and murders of Princes, these will easily blow away
so trifling a sin (I speak comparatively) as is equivocation in an Oath. If
amongst Papists there be any (as charity would have us judge there be none)
that nourish such bloody entendments, I make no doubt they be of that company
that take the Oath. If amongst Puritans there be any so traitorously disposed,
I dare acquit them that for conscience and fear of offe^ding God refuse the
Oath, and undergo the penalties thereof, as I understand some do. Those
Purita^s may be rather suspected that be deluder^ of piously inclined people,
that think^ they may lawfully lie for the glory of the Gospel, Ha^^ maximam

that have drawn auersion to his Majesty from the very spring of his being,
from the womb wherein most barbarously they went about to bury him before he
was borne. As for Papists they bear him affection grounded in the stock,
derived from mother to the son: these I say refusing to swear out of mere
co^scie^^e may, according to the rules of prudency and policy, most of all be
trusted, and deserve that the beams of his royal Clemency shine upon them.


Philanax. They that refuse the Oath, I see not why therefore they should be
numbered amongst loyal subjects: yea rather fearing perjury, they seem to
dissouer disl^yall affection, lurking in their hearts.


Aristobulus. Such as refuse to take the Oath in the prescribed form of
words, at the same time offer to swear that they will be loyal to his Majesty
in all occasions against domestical treasons or foreign invasions: either
they mea^t sincerly or not: if not, first where is Theodidacts divinity that
God so binds the inmost co^s^ience that obdurate sinners will not dissemble
in oaths? Secondly why would you trust them, if they should swear the oath
you prescribe, if they will dissemble in the Oath they offer to take
themselves? much more they will and may disse^ble in the Oath you force upon
them under grievous penalties, if they mean sincerely, then his Majesty may be
secure. What greater Loyalty can you desire? they will never yield to any
treason, nor second or conceal any forrayne invasion whatsoever. How can that
stand with the principles of their doctrine, that the Pope may depose the King?
Why should ^e be solicitous how they may do it with safe conscience? It is
enough that we have their sworn love and affection to do it. Leave that care
to them, when occasions fall, out particular circumstances will a^foard probable
reasons to do the duty of subjects, without blemish to their Religion. Love is
ingenious to find out reasons for excuse of the person we love: so we be
assured of their love to Prince and Country, we need no more. But we be not
sure thereof? How be we not sure when we see, those men that offer to swear
it, ready to die rather then swear an untruth? having the greatest assurance
they mean sincerely, that morality can a^foard, is it not pity that har^s so
du^ifull to their Prince should be plucked out of their breasts as traiterous,
because they be so awful to God, that they will be rather torn in pieces, then
swear an vncertanity?

Wherefore in my opinion, sworn duty of Papists were to be highly prized, yea
most of all the allegiance of them, that be readier to die then to take the new
oath. For their standing with such danger against an oath which they think
unjust, shows they will not for humane respects swear but what really they
believe to be true^ nor promise but what they truly mean to perform. It may
be justly supposed that these men, as they will rather dye, then swear
Allegiance which they think not due, so they will loose their lives sooner then
neglect the allegiance they have once sworn. And though they cannot frame their
consciences to swear the speculatiue denial of the Pop^s authority to depose
Princes in some circumstances imagin^^le, yet they are ready to swear that in
practice they will stand with the King against ^ll treasons, and in all
quarrels not openly and vnexcusably unjust. Such as persuade his Majesty to
neglect such loyal offer of love, I pray God their treacherous, flattery bring
him not into occasions that he may need the help of such trusty subjects.

This we see that already the flaterers have brought him to engage his Honor
for the overthrow of the Popes authority in this point, which is the fourth
consideration that I made promise to present unto you. For I cannot think the
success will be such as might become the enterprise of so great a Monarch.


Philanax. The power to depose Kings at his pleasure which the Pope
challenge^h, so sauoureth of presumption, and is so odious, that his Majesty
needs not fear the success of so plausible a quarrel.


Aristobulus. This authority has ^yn now many years together impugned, and
the abiuration thereof urged under gri^uous penalties. What have we gained? or
rather could this doctrine have more prevailed then by this opposition it has
done? Before this stir, I know some learned Papists denied that authority in
the Pope; many that held it, thought it not a point of Faith, but the more
probable opinion: and in France that opinion might scarce be spoken of. Now
find me a popish Priest that houlds it, or thinks that doctrine tolerable in
their Church? When the matter was urged in France to have a like oath enacted,
did not both Clergy and Nobility stand against it? When Cardinal Per^ns speech
for the Popes authority to depose K^nges was printed, what Papist durst p^t his
name to an answer? We know that that doctrine forsaken of the Papists of
France, was forced to fly for succor to his Maiestie^ pen. Some Papists
complain that we change the state of the question, of purpose to make their
doctrine odious; Which is, not that the Pope may depose Princes at his
pleasure, but in case of necessity. But this change of the question to me
seems not so disgraceful to the Pope, as to our ^hospell, that after so great
promises to burn Rome, and overthrow Popery, the heat of al our controversies
works upon this point, Whether Kings for their Crowns be the Popes tenants
at will. Would the Pope renounce his right in this point, for the rest we would
not greatly care to give over. When I consider the late quarrel begun by our
King Henry the 8. against the Pope, me thinks the success thereof has been
much like that of the Carthaginians under Haniball against the ancient Common
wealth of Rome. At the first the Carthaginians so far prevailed, as they got
most part of Italy from the Romans, and fought with them about the walls of
Rome. Within a while fortune so changed that the Carthaginians were driven
back into Afric; war was there maintained, that much ado they had to save
their own^ Carthage. Our Kings in the beginning strove with the Pope for
supremacy in spiri^ua^l things, many Papists and even Bishops stood with the
King, that the Pope was in danger to loose his Miter. The more that matters
were searched into, the more did the Popes cause daily prevail: so that not
only Papists be now clearly resolved in that point, as in a most notorious
truth, but also Puritans mislike Princes supremacy: and even Protestants, as
far as they da^e, go paring away pieces from it. And now the Pope secure of
supremacy in spiritual things, pretends right to dispose of Crowns, when the
necessity of Religion shall require it. And who sees not that even in this
controversy they daily win ground? Had not we s^t our s^lues to impugn this
authority: had not so many books, fr^ught with weak arguments, which Papists
conf^te with great show of truth on their side, been written against it: had
not Priests lost their lives, and lay Papists their livings for it, I am
persuaded it might have been buried in obliuio^, or at least within their
schools have been kept from common peoples ^ares. Now persecution has made
the question so famous, as it will hardly be forgotten: the blood shed for the
affirmative part thereof, has printed the same deep in many m^ns conceits,
yea the death of men so grave, learned, and pious has made some Protestants
that hated it before, cast upon it a more favorable look. -- Per arma per
caedes, abipso
Sumit opes, animumque serro.


And this is a very remarkable proceeding of Popery, different from the course
of our Gospel. The light of our Gospel shined exceeding bright at the
first: there was no division amongst our Ghospellers: it stirred up in men's
hearts wonderful zeale^ that (as one notes) out of pure light they did not
consider what they did, Dangerous positions p. 33.
and i^ their zeal their goods, lands, children, wives, and lives were not
greatly dear unto them. With time this light waxed dymmer and dymmer, the
doctrine less certain, they grew into factions and sects, and thereupon their
zeal b^came could, that now the greatest fear is (as oftentimes from one
extreme men are prone to fall into the clean opposite) least the supposed
clear shining of truth, make men uncertain and not greatly zealous of any
Religion at all. The Papists contrariwise, when controversies are first raised,
are very wary and circumspect, their censures be not absolute, there are
commonly diverse opinions amongst them, the more that Scriptures, Fathers,
Counsels, testimonies of antiquity, and reasons are examined, the more they
grow into consent, the more resolute and immovable they become in their
doctrine, m^re z^alous one day then another to give their lives for it. This
course they hold in the doctrine of the Popes power, which in the beginning was
taught neither so certainly, nor universally, nor zealously as now it is, and
will be every day more and more, except these controversies be removed from
vulgar examination, which cannot be so long as the oath is urged: seeing such
as are to swear, must (least they be forsworn) search into the certainty of
this Truth, and read books that treat of that argument. And when no other
inconvenience should ensue of this course; this alone might move the prudent
friends of Kings to labor the silencing of this controversy, that the words of
deposing and murdering Gods anointed, which should be buried in the depth of
amazement and horror, come by vulgar disputation to sound familiarly in every
ear. And without doubt by this their familiar acquaintance with the word, part
of the horror against the action is lost. Which may be the cause, Pudor rerum
pe^ verba dediscitur. Sen. ep. 77.
that where speech against the Pops authority for deposing of Kings has been
rifest, and most vulgar, those Countries for practice against the life of their
Kings have been most unfortunate: Whereas Spain has seen no such tragical
practice, nor any attempt thereon, but has enjoyed a long happy peace, where
the questions how to proceed with Tyrants are freely permitted to the
schools, without any popular declamations against Scholastical^ opinions in
this point.


Philanax. I must confess that I have been my self much deceived in my
expectation about the suc^esse of Papists in this controversy. When I
considered the circumstances of the contention, the doctrine impugned not
grateful to Princes, not so clearly decided in their Church, by some of their
writers denied, the person impugning by sword and pen a Monarch mighty,
learned, and beloved even of Popish Potentates, and this at a time of great
advantage upon the gunpowder treason, which was urged as a sequel of this
doctrine, that even the greatest favorers thereof seemed fearful. These
circumstances made me think that P^pery would receive a great blow, and that
his Majesty would draw the whole Church to be of his opinion. What the success
has been we see, and you have showed. I could wish the Controversy might not
have further progress, and be now buried in silence, that posterity may not
say, that Rome grew by his Majesty's opposition against it, that this point of
her authority was made renowned by victory over him, and what the Papists
before did doubtfully defend, the blood of their Martyrs suffering under King
James made certain, known, illustrious. And peace concluded about the
silencing of this controversy might be the beginning of an universal agreement
with that Sea, seeing other doctrinall controversies by discussion be brought
to that issue, that (as I have heard some learned and intelligent persons
auerre) a calm consultation void of private interest, and animosity might
soon end them.


Aristobulus. This peace were much to be wished nor is it safe to mantaine
strife with that Sea, but upon unavoidable occasions. And this is the fifth and
last thing which I wish you would seriously ponder, and not wonder that this
counsel should be suggested by me that am no Pa^^st.

The known bad success that Kings and Princes have still had in their
opposicions against the Roman Church may move sufficiently all faithful
Counsailors, though not of the Popes Religion, never (if they may choose) to
engage their So^craignes in such quarrelles. Judith. c. 2^
Arioch the Ammonite Prince could tell Holosernes out of experience, that his
power and force would not be able to subdue the Jews, that in the end he would
be repelled with disgrace, yet he was not a Jew in Religion. The like advise
Amon^ Counsailors that were heathens gaue^ him, Esther. c. ^.
to desist in his quarrel against Mardochaus the Jew: Thou can not (say
they) resist him, he being of the stock of the Jews, but shall fall before
him. It was noted that when Octau^a^ and Antony were youths, still in their
games Octauian had the best: whereupon a prudent friend gave Antony warning in
civil controversies never to encounter him. Plutarchus de fortu^^ Romano^u^
Thou art (said he) more noble then he, more eloquen^ and better qualified, yet
I see clearly his Genins is stronger the^ thine: if thou try the for^une of
war with him, he will doubtless be Conqueror. What the cause may be why it
should be so, who knows? but experience, now a thousand and six hundred years
old^ shows that this is the^ fate and felicity of that Sea, to conquer with
their patience and bring vnd^^ subjection, and into nothing, all the opponents
against their doctrine, or their authority. The Roman Emperors for 300^ years
together bloudily oppugned Christian R^lig^on, but principally the Roman Sea,
in so much as thirty Bishops thereof were martyred, Epist. 52.
and the persecuting Emperors (as S. Cy^rian says) were more grieved that a
new high Priest was placed in that Sea, then that a new Prince was chosen and
set up against them. What was the success? For those three Centuries of
years, scarce any Emperor that persecuted them, can be named, that derived
the Empire to a third heir, or dyed not an unfortunate death: and in the end
Constantine, their Successor, submitted the Empire to the obedience of the
Roman Bishop, wherein the Empe^ors that followed him continued.

Afterward so^e Christian Emperors began to quarrel with the Church about the
priuiledge^ and immunities of the Clergy, specially Valentinian the third, and
the succeeding Emperors of the West. Did they prevail? In their days the
western Empire began to decay; The Franks took to the^ France; the Saxons,
Britanny; and VVandalls Asrick; the Visigothes, Spain; the Goths, Italy^
which ^oone after were made Chri^^^ans and submitted their Kingdoms to the
Pope, and their Kings professed to receive their Crowns and authority from him.

Who knows not how pitifully the Eastern Emperors, and the Patriarchs of
Constantinople vexed the Pope for many ages, which their quarrel they never
would give over till finally they fell into the miserable bondage and sl^uery
of the Tu^ke, wherein at this present, without hope of remedy, they groan.

What success (to omit many other experiences) had the German Caesar's, that
strove with the Pope for the inuestiture of Bishops by staff and ringe? Henry
the 4. excommunicated and deposed by Gregory the 7. upon that cause, prospered
for a while, which this treatiser sets down to encourage Princes to follow his
example, but he concealeth how in the end (in punishment of his rebellion
against his spiritual Father, Sigon. de Regno ^^a^. l. 9. in Hen^. 4.
as Papists think) he was deposed by his own Son, put in prison, whence
escaping he gathered forces, was defeated, and brought to such want, as he sued
to be Sexton in a Churc^^ and serve Priests Mass, who had most cruelly vexed
the high Priest of Christians many years together. Not admitted to that
office, he turned himself to beg of laymen, in lamentable manner, crying,
Have mercy on me, at least you my friends, for the hand of the Lord has
touched me: and so full of misery, repentance, and anguish of mind, he pined
away to death. The news whereof was received with general joy of all
Christians. And his Son, though for a while he trod the steps of his Fathers
disobedience: yet finally he yielded up his right, in possession whereof the
Roman Bishop is at thi^ day. Wherein not only the success which Popes had
against so potent Adversaries, as was Henry the 4. who fought more battaile^
then ever did Julius Caesar, but their courage and confidence also was
admirable. Neither ought any discreet Protestant trust Theodidacts relation of
Hidelbra^ds fainting in the quarrel, taken out of Sigebert a partial Monk;
seeing Papists bring 50. Historians that contradict him. These whose fidelity
can with no rea(...) called in question, relate that he ended his life full of
co^stancy, using at his death these words: Because, I have loved Justice, and
hated wickedness, I now die in banishment. Vrbane that succeeded Gregory both in
office and in zeal against the Emperor, being driven out of Italy into
France, having so great need of the Kings assistance; yet was he so void of
humane respects, that at that very time he excommunicated Philip King of
France, for putting away his true wife, and living in open incest. Papyrius
Maslonius Annal. Franc. l. 3. in Philipp.
The King (says an impartial Historian) threatened, that except Vrbane would
restore him to the Church and Crown, he would depart with his whole Kingdom
from his obedience, and the obedience of the Roman Sea: yet this moved not that
most holy Bishop to relent. In fine Philip was feign to yield; not being able
to extort otherwise releasment from excommunication, and so religion and
conscience prevailed over the Scepter and the Diadem, and the invincible
Majesty and Name of King. So admirable for constancy were those Popes that used
their authority to depose wicked Emperors, and so free from love of the world,
that we may ius^ly think God favored their cause. H^^soeuer their perpetual
good success for so many ages against all adversaries, though the reason
thereof be hidden, may give just cause (in my opinion) for Kings to be wary, how
they adventure their Crowns upon prevailing against them; and how they devise
new oaths of Allegiance that wage war against the authority of their Sea.
And this is the last thing which I desire to leave to be seriously pondered by
you that love the King: and so I conclude, praying the Lord heartily, that as
hitherto he has defended Kingly authority in our great Britany from open
enemies: so now he will defend the same from secret plots and traiterous
Treatises, which by show of friendship seek the overthrow thereof.


Philanax. I am glad ( Aristobulus) that we fell into this discourse, in which
you have clearly discryed Theodidacts fraudulent undermining of Royal
Authority. The publishers of that book, besides their secret plotting against
(...) ^oueraignty of Princes, seem like^^^^ to have had an eye to their own
^uere in the di^ulging thereof. For there being a command, that this Book both
in public and private schools be read to Children of both sexes, and each
book sold for six pence which is hardly worth two pence; you must needs see a
great sum of money that hence is yearly made: a sum, I say, so great, as
does far surpass the custom of the Peter Pence, which in old time every
house paid to the Pope. Notwithstanding at this their enriching themselves by
this devise, I do not so much grieve: but I am heartily sorry that so many odious
and ungrounded positions co^cernin^ Royal Authority that may raise up horror
rather the^ love of Kings, be instilled into the tender minds of Children,
which afterward, when any occasion is given, may soon turn into hatred. But
thereof yo^ have spoken enough. Wherefore I likewise will end with your hearty
good wishes toward his Majesty, and our most gracious Prince Charles,
beseching the Almighty to defend them both, and to give them the spirit of
wised (...) whereby they may discover these ^^^^sons hidden with a show of
friendshipp.


The Printer to the Reader.
THIS Treatise (gentle Reader) may seem written by some English Protestant,
against some Puritans, enemies of Kingly Soueraignity; which by them in former
times openly impugned, they now seek to overthrow, by grou^ding the same upon
odious, and ^aungerous Positio^s touching the immunity of Tyrants. The Author
disputes the question of this weighty subject, in such moderate style and
manner, bringing (...)ns both solid, and not reg(...)ing with Catholic
doctrine, that he may be thought to be in opinion Catholic, though for
modesties sake, and to the end that this truth might be more pleasingly
accepted of Protestants; in this work he discourses as if he were Protestant.
And for this reason, some Catholic arguments he does pretermit; others he does
not urge to the uttermost, partly for breuityes sake, but chiefly because his
intent is no more then to show that the new Protestants principles from which
they deduce R^yall Authority be at the least doubtful and uncertain. And this
he does clearly demonstrate, and thence concludes. that it is against the rules
even of humane policy, to forsake the most sure grounds of Sovereign Power in
Kings, whereon Christian Kingdoms relying, have hitherto stood firm and
flourished vnd(...) Catholic discipline and just l(...) and to build the sacred
authority of Princes, whereon their peoples safety dependes, upon the new
ungrounded Doctrines, and Paralogismes of Scriptures, which seems to have been
the drift of the former Dialogue.

For this cause, I thought it would not be amiss, nor lost labor, to put the
same in print, renewed before hand and corrected.

The title, God and the King, I would not alter, because i^ two words, it does
fully put down^ the Catholic opinion concerning Princes Authority, and their
subjects Allegiance. For (as this trea^ise does i^sinuate) three opinions in
this point now are in England. The first of Purita^s, who will have God without
King, or else such a King that must depend on the peoples beck, (...) their
Consistoria^ Preachers, (...)ose perfidious audacity, his ^^^esty has had
sufficient experience. The second is of Politicians, who have no more
Christianity, then Parlamentary decrees breath into them: These will have King
without God, or at least King and God, that is, God so long, and no longer
then the King shall please, whom they will have still obeyed, though he go
openly about to extinguish the light of Christian Religion. The third opinion
is of Catholik^s, whose ^ote is, God and the King^ in the first place they
worship God; in the second the King, to whom they give all Allegiance and
subjection as far as Religion and conscience will permit. And this is to
give, what is Caesar's to Caesar, and what is Gods to God. Farewell.

FINIS.
