The Prologue
IN so much that it is necessary to all creatures of cry^^en relygyon / or of
false relygyon / or gentyles / and machomytes to know their prince / or
princes / that regne upon the^ and them to obey. So it is comodydus to know
their noble acts and deeds / and the cyrcu^stau^ce of their lives. Therefore in
the year of our lord. M.CCCC.lxxxiii. ye year of ye regne of king Edward ye
fourth at saint Aldons / so that all men may know ye acts namely of our noble
kings of England / is co^pyled together i^ this book / and moreover is
translated out of latin in to english / fro the beginning of the world ye
lygnage of Christ / from Adam till it be comen to Dauyd / and from Dauyd ye
kings of Israel and of Jews ye high bishops i^ their days with the Iuges
and prophets. The four pryncypall reames of ye world / that is to say of
Babylon. of Percees. of Greeks. and of Romans. And all the Emperors of Rome /
or Popes / by order / and their names. And many a notable fader with certain of
their acts As more plainly is declared in the chapter next after. And here
ben rehearsed the names of the Auctours / of whom these Chronicles ben translated
most namely. Galfridus Nunmoth monk in his book of Brute Saint Bid in ye
acts of England. I^ Bid in his book of times. Gyldas in ye acts of
Brytayne. wyllya^ Malmesbury monk in ye acts of kings of England and
bishops. Cassiderus of ye acts of Emperors and bishops. Saint Austyn de
cidei. Titus Liuius de gestis Romanorum. Martyn Penytencyary to ye pope in his
chronicles of Emperors and bishops. And namely Theobaldus Cartusien^ and
containing in his book ye progress of all notable faders from ye beginning
of the world unto our time with ye notable acts of the same. In this new
tra^slacyon are contained many notable and maruaylous things. And those ben
alleged by auctoryte of many famous clerks. And that every man may know how
these Chronicles ben ordered* ye shall understand / that this book is divided
in.vii. parts. Of the which ye first part contained from Adam till Bru^e
came in to Brytayne. The second part co^tayneth from Brute came first in to
England. unto the cite of Rome was builded by Romolus. The third part
conteyneth sith rome was b^ylded / unto C^yste was borne of over lady Mary. The
fourth from thens unto ye coming of Sa^dus in to England. The fy^^^ part
from thens unto the coming of the Danys. The syxte part from thene / unto ye
coming of ye Normans. The seventh part fro the Norma^s / unto our time.
which is under ye regne of Edward the fourth.xxiii. year / whoos noble
chronicles by custom may not (...) seen. And so in every part of these.vii.
parts ben showed ye most and necessary acts of all ye kings of England and
their names written above in ye margene / that every man may find them sone.
And before the king of Englondes acts ben written / there is written ye lygnage
of christ from Adam till that Christ was borne of our lady / with the hye
bishop and the Iu^e that were in that time / and certain of their acts
necessary / till it be common till christ was borne. And after that Christ was
borne / and Peter was Pope of rome / is showed by order the names of all the
popes and emperors of Rome / before / and after / with certeynt of their acts
breuyatly / and many other diverse things and merueyles in those men's days
falling. And it is showed every thing in his place / how many year it fell
after the beginning of ye world and how long before that Christ was borne. And
when that I come to Christ was borne then it is written / how long any thing
fell after the Natyuyte of Christ / And this is ye order of this book and the
things that been spoken of.

ANd as to men's desiring to have a very knowledge / of these chronicles or of
any other / it is necessary: to know.vi. things. The first is the states of
things / and those ben two One is fro the beginning of ye world unto Christ /
the which is called the state of Diuiacion. The secunde is from Christ to the
end of ye world / ye which is called ye state of Reconsiliacion. The second
thing is the diuisyon of times and those ben three. One is before the law of
moses / and an other is under ye law of Moses / an other is under ye law of
grace after christ dyed. The third is ye gouernynge of kingdoms. And as for
that ye must know: that al though there were four pryncypall kingdoms / that
is to say. Of Babylon / of Persces / of Grekis / and Romans. nevertheless: as
to the course of the world: and the order of holy scripture: ye first gouernyng
was under faders: from Adam unto moses. The second under Iuges from Moses
unto Saul. The third under kings: from Saul unto zorobabel. The fourth under
bishops from zorobabel unto Christ. The fourth is the dyuersyte of laws and
those were five. The first was the law of nature: and that was comen of all
men. The second is the law or the custom of gentyles: when that under king
Nyon ye people began to worship falls gods. The third is under the law
written: rose the law of Jews: wha^ ye Circu^cisyon divided ye Jews from
other people The fourth is under Christ / rose the law of christian men / when
faith and grace of the sacraments / informed ye life of men. The fyfth under
Machomete / rose the law of Sarrasyns and Turks. The fyfthe is / the
nobleness or vnnoblenesse in deeds And as to these / it is to know that.vii.
persons ben read of / whom the deeds many times are had in mind in
hystoryes. That is to wit / of a prince in his reame / of a knight in battle.
of a Judge in his place / of a bishop in the clergy / of a polytyk man in the
people of an husbonde man in the house / and of an abbot i^ his church. And of
these are written many times the lauds of good men / and the punyssheme^tes of
the cursyd men. The sixthe is ye true cou^tynge of the years and as to that it
is to be know / that there were.viii. manner of nombryng or cou^tynge of the
years. Three after the Hebrews. Three after the Grekis. One after ye Ramayns^
And one now after the christian men. The Hebrews three manner of wise begyn^eth
their year. After the Hebrews there is the year usual / beginning at January
/ the which they use i^ couenau^tes and barge^s making. And the year leyfull
beginning at March / ye which they use in their cerymonyes. And the year
Emergens from May beginning when they went from Egypt. they use in their
chronicles and calculacions. The Grekis nombreth their year three manner of wise.
First to ye glory and Joy of their victory / cou^teth their years from the
destruccyon of Troy The first / the second / the third / the fourth etc.
Then after the chyualry began at the hylle of Olympus / they notefyed ye
years after the same Olympyadu^. And what Olympyades is / ye shall know after
in ye book. The third / wha^ they began to have lordshyp of all ye world they
notefyed their years these manner of wise In ye year of the regne of Grekys
the.iiii. the.x. the: xv. etc. As it is open in ye book of Machabeorum Then^e
after the Romans gouernynge ye world / counted and nombred their years (ab vr
be condita) The last of all Christian men cou^teth their years from ye
Incarnacyon of christ And because we ben Christian men we use most to nombre /
from ye beginning of the world / unto christ was borne. And fro Christ was
borne unto our time. And this order is observed and kept in all the book / of
every thing in his place as it is said before.

Explicit Prologus.
Hic incipit Fructus temporum.
Because of this books made / to tell what time of any thing notable was.
Therefore the begynnyge of all times shortly shall be touched. For the which
after doctors it is to be known / that.iiii. things were made first / and
in one time: and of one aege. That is to wit / the heaven Imperyall / angels
nature: ye matere of ye four eleme^tes: and time. And that doctors call: the
work of the creacyon: the which was made before any day or night of the
mighty power of god. And was made of nothing. Then after follows the work
of the dyuysyon: the which was made in three of the first days in which is
showed the high wisdom of the maker. Then after follows the arayenge of
this work in the which is showed the goodness of the creature the which was
made.iii. of the next days following (Vt patz clare in te^^u gen^. primo) The
first day god made / and divided ye light from the darkness. The second day
god made: and ordained the fyrmament: and divided the water from the water. The
third day god made in the^ which he gadered ye waters in to one place: (...)
earth then appeared. The fourth day god made: in the which he ordained the
son: ye moan and the sterres and put them in the fyrmament. The fyfth day
god made: in the which he ordained fysshes and fowls: and great whales in ye
water. The sixte day god ordained: in the which he made be and man. The
seventh day god made: and in that day he rested of al works that he had
ordained / not as in werkynge being weary. But he ^eased to make mo new
creatures (Vide plura gen^.i.)

BE it known / that Adam ye first man / of whom it is written i^ this first age
next lowynge / lived.ix.C. year and.xxx. And he gate.xxxii. son^es / and as
many daughters.

Anno mundi.i. Et ante xp^i natiuitatem v.M.C.lxxxxix^ Here begins the
first aege during unto the floode of Noy Adam Eua

depiction of Adam and Eve, the Tree, and the Serpent IN the first year of the
world the syxte day / god made Adam in the field. Damasc^n^ and eua of one of
his rybbes / puttyng the^ in paradyse. And bad them to keep his commandment
yt they should not ete of ye fruit of life under ye pain of death. And ye same
day that they had sinned: anon he cast them out of paradyse in to ye land of
cursydnes that they should live there with swetynge and sorrow till they dyed
(Vide plura gen^.i.) This Adam was an holy man all the days of his life / and
great penance daily he did. And he commanded his children to live ryghtwysly.
And namely that they should avoid in all wise from the company of Cayn and his
children. Nor that they should not marye with none of the^. This man Ada^ was
our first fader. And for one syn^e he put us out of paradys. But through his
holy co^uersacyon and penance / he gave us ensample to come to the kingdom of
heaven. And he that will not follow his holy co^uersacyo^ and example / for one
syn^e ryghtwysly / he can not compain on him / as we do many. Seth sone to
Adam was borne after the beginning of ye world.C. and.xxx. years / and
lived.ix.C. and.xii. But Moses ouerskypped an hundredth of those / in the
which Abell wept in ye vale of Ploracyon nyghe Ebro^ This Seth for the oil of
mercy to be go^en / went to paradys. Delbora was sister to Abell Abell was
slain of cayn his brod. This Abell the first martyr began ye church of god.
This man after Austyn made the cytee of god / and he was ye first cytezyn of
that cite. And because that he was ryghtwyse our lord received his offering.
Calmana was sister and wife to Cayn. This Cayn was a cursed man / and he made ye
first erthely cite that ever i^ this world was in the which he put his people
for dread in so much as he vsyd caryn and vyole^ce. For he trusts such
thing to be done to him as he did to other / therefore he put him and his i^ to
a syker place. This man slew his brother Abell for envy / and he was
punysshed of god / and wandered about in a dyspayre. And after was slain of
Lamath a blind man.

LAmeth was of aege vii. ho^dred.lxxvii. This Lameth the first against nature
and good maneres ordained that a man might have two wives / in doing his
auowtry. And he was sore punysshed of them / for they gave him many a grype For
it is so that by what thing a man sen^eth / by the same he is punysshed. This
Lameth slew Cayn wylfully not. But when he was old and blind / he was ladde
of a child ye which trowed that he had see^ a wild best and said to his
master that he should shote and so he slew Cayn. wherefore he beat the child
so sore that the child also was deed And it is to be known that al crafts /
or scye^ces lyberal or hand crafts / or of physyke seruyng to the curyosyte
of man are read that they were fostden of ye childern of Lameth and for they
dradde the peril to come of the flood and of the fire therefore Tuball graued
ye same crafts i^ two pylers. The one was of Marbyll / the other of ^yle or
brycke. Tuball found first the craft to work gold and silver / and yren.
And was ye first grauer that ever was Iabe found first Te^^oria for

play upon an harp and organs and other musycall Instruments he vsid. Nocma
found first ye craft for to weue lynnen and woollen clothe / and to
drawathredes of wulle and flexe. And before that time / the people used the
skynnes of bestes for there clothes.

in sign of the promise that god made to man that there should never be such a

Here begins the second aege of the world during to Abram


depiction of Noah's ark THis Noe was a ryghtwys man and found grace against
god wha^ Noe was five ho^dred year of aege he had gote^ Cha^. Sem. and Iapheth
that time by ye commandment of god he began to make a ship. and he made it
parfyte in an.C. year. And the.C. year complete / our lord god appeared again
to him / and commanded him that he with his wife and his childern and ye wives
of them should enter the ship with all manner of bestes / and all manner of
fowls also. etc^. And anon the flood came / and stood above all hills xv.
cubyte (Vide plura gen^.viio) After the flood a great dronkenesse betyde unto
Noe. and through occasyo^ of that dro^kesse he blessed his two sons. Sem and
Iaphet / for the faders honor that they had to him and for ye honest shame
that they covered mekely there fader members when he was slepynge. and his sone
Cham / for his scornynge and his irreverence / he cursyd. And here after saint
Austyn is made / ye first mencyon of bou^dage / and of noblynesse contrary to
it^ For Noe said that Cha^ should be servant in bondage to Sem and Iaphet / for
his vnreuere^ce. Nevertheless ye shall not trow / that all that descended of
Cham were unnoble me^ and of no power. For they began first to be mighty men of
ye earth. As it is open of Nemroth and the king of Canaan and Ascorum. Nor all
of Sem and Iaphet were virtuous and noble and mighty me^ when almost euerche
one fell in to the crime of ydolatry / and were often times oppressed of other
men. But this blessing and this cursyng has a respect to virtue and vice /
for ye which a man is called truly a noble man or an unnoble man. For he that
is virtuous is a noble man and he that is vnuertuous is not noble. the same
manner of wise tho that follows ye faith of abraham rathar were called his
childern than ye Jews the which carnally descended from him. Nevertheless they
had a spyrytuall preuelege of god / for the faders merytes and his blessyng.
and these.iii sons oe Noe he being alive after thy story of Phil^i^s were
born.xxiiii.M. and.vii.C. me^ without wym^en and childern. And they had on the^
three princes Nemroth. Iactan. and Suphen.

of Salem / and now it is caled Jerusalem Cham his brother opteyned Affricam /
and gate sons tweyne. Chus and Mesrayam. And the two gate sons and daughters
/ and many a regyon was of them and many of them to us ben unknown. For they
enhabyte and have their mansyons in ye occydentall ynde. Iaphet was brother unto
Cham / and was blessed of his fader / and this Iaphet had.vii. sons. as Gomor.
magog. Maday. Ianam^ Tuball. Masog. and Iras. And these.vii. gate sons and
daughters / and of them came many a regyon (Vide p^^a Gen^.xv.) Arpharat sone
to s^m lived.CCCC. and.xxx. year. And gate Elam. Assure. Ludde / and Aram / and
they gate many a sone and daughter (vt pz gen^) This Assure / by cause he would
not rebel against god. in the edefyenge and building of ye toure of Babylon /
as Nemroth did therefore he was driven unto ye land of Sennaars land / which
was right strange to him and was not before enhabyted / The which was called
after his name Assuria. And there he edefyed and builded a cite afterward
named Niniue / ye which was Metropolon of all the kingdom of Assuriu^. Chus
sone to Cham was fader to Nemroth. This Nemroth was a gyaunt of.x. cubytes
long. and he began to be mighty in ye world and he is called a boystous
hunter before god This man began that wretched vice of coueytousnesse by hes
tyranny / with the which vice evermore after this world is fulfyled. And the
pryncypalest kingdom that he had was Babylon. and he had Archade. Edissa.
Selencia / and the land of Sennaar. Sale sone to Arpharat lived.cccc.
and.xxxiii. years. and of him in scripture is no thing wryte^ but that Moses
nombred him i^ the line that comes of christ. These Sale gate a sone that was
named Heber The which after ye Hebrews had the spyryte of prophecye. And of
this Heber ye Hebrews ben named. For the Hebrews tongue bode alone in his house
in the confusyon of the la^gage And that la^gage was called man's langage /
the which every man used before the toure of Babyloa was builded This Heber
had two sons / and one was called Iectan thrughe ensample of Nemroth
decensendynge from Cham took the Pryncehode upon the childern of Sem. And he
had.xiii. sons. But these people after Ierom are not known of us / for
fernesse of the country / or muta^yon and chaungynge of the people / or else
of some other manner cause.

PHaleg lived two.C. and.xxxix. years this phaleg was the younger sone of Heber
/ and i^ his days was made the confusyon of langages For in his hows abode the
old tongue al oule / and yt was Hebrewe. wherefore after Saint Austyn / in him
apered a great steadfastness of right wysnes For this house was free of that
pain / As not co^se^tynge to the building of the toure. (^t secundu^ Aug)
there was.lxxii. generaco^ns / and so there were.lxxii. langage. Iacta^ oder to
Phaleg Sem Nemroth prince of Cham Sulphen of Iaphet / these three princes with
there people gadred the^ to gyder in ye field of Sennaar / dredynge ye ^^ood to
come again said. Let us build a toure / of the which: ye hight shall reche to
heaven etc. Gen^. xii. Our lord saw the folysshnes of the people. Maruayllously
for ye pain of there sin / he confounded the tongue of the^. i^ so much that
none understood what an other said. And so they were disperpled and asondred by
all ye world. Of the malice of this Nemroth books ben written full And after
the co^fusyon of ye langage he went to the land of Pertees / and there he
enstrocte and taught them to doure and worship ye fire as god. And he left his
sone Belus in Babylon / the which Belus su^ceded him. And so from thens his
progenye opteyned ye kingdom / unto the time of many a year after. In this time
began many kyngdoms. and the most of those kyngdoms was the kingdom of
Scitarum. But there were so many rude and boystous people in it / that cite
was never had in worship. And it was a strong and a mighty regyon of
dystau^ce. And about this time began the kingdom of Egept / the which with
diverse and many alteracyons often times was chaunged^ also it is spoken of many
times in scripture Noblynesse or gentylmen about this said time began. And
this noblynesse or gentylmen was ordained for many causes. The first cause was
necessyte. For when makend drew sore and men were prompte and ready to do
evil. it was very necessary / to withstand the great malice of the cursyd
people / against good men There of a man is called a gentylma^ or a nobleman /
as before other in virtues notable. where of Ierom says. I see no thing else
in noblesse or i^ gentylmen bute that they are bounden in a creteyn necessyte /
that they shall not recede fro the virtue / and the gentylnesse of there noble
auncetours. The second was the diverse worshyppynge of the people. For no man
worshypt then / but as his natural reason gaaf. And they knew not
ryghtwysly what they should worship / all though they lived peasyble among
themself For they were so dull of wit / that they could pondre no great
thing / but ye was publysshed by the common people. wherefore it was expedyent
for there peace be kept that they should have princes of noble birth. The third
cause proceeds of some synguler strength. Many times the comynalte were grieved
through enmyes coming upon them. And then they said ye who someuer would
deffende and keep them from these peryles / he should have the right of
nobleness for him and his heyers for ever more and in this manner of wise many
are radde to be noble me^ The fourth cause of noblynesse / was great
haboundaunce of goods. Sometime the people we holde^ with great penury of mete
and drink. And then they took them and theyrs to some rich man / that through
that couenaunte / they s^old tempre the great straytnesse of there hungre / and
after that they should know him as their lord and a noble man. Also there be
found certain noble men by the prouysyon of god / though they were but few of
the which some abode in virtue / as Dauyd: and some failed anon: as Saull and
Jeroboam. Also it is radde: that many were noble men by tyranny and vyolence.
Of the which some were destroyed anon. And some abode in stablenesse / as
Paynymes might.

SAruk lynelly descended from our forn fader Adam to Abraham And Nachor was
sone / and he lived an houndred and.xlviii. year. And about this time ydolatry
began to encreace myghtely. And if ye reuolue and look the hystoryes / ye shall
find that three things pryncypally brought men to the sin of ydoly. That is
to understand. the affection which theg had to deed men. Dredde and
flaterynge against there princes. And the dylygence of artyfycers and crafty men
about scultures or grauynges. wicked fendes then entered in to ye ydollis /
and gave answers to the people And these wicked spyrytes confermed the error
of the people myghtely. In so much / that what some ever manner of person /
would not conform him to the reason / he should grievously suffer the pain of
death. Also there was added and put to these things the dysceyuynge laud and
praysynge of Poets / the which wretches and also dampened men in to heaven with
all their gaye aourned wrytynges exalted / And that same time / when
deuylles began for to speak / so fayrly and so mekely to man The good lord
of his great and abundaunt merry / sent his aungelles / That they should speak
to his elected men in vysybly / leest that all man kind should perysshe with
this myscheuous error.

BElus sone to Nemroth this time was king of Babylon. And he was ye first king
of this world / and this man was he whom the error of the people first trowed
/ should be a god / wherefore diverse people named him dyuersly. And some called
him Bell / some Baal some Baalim / some Beelphagor / and some Belsabub And this
unhappy error stood in man kind more than two.M. years. Ninus sone to Belus
the second king of Babylon of assurioru^ / reigned.liiii. years. And this
Ninus desired for to have lordshyp and worshype and to that intent that he
might be lord of all ye country about him / he gave battle to all that
dwelled nyghe about him. And by cause that time the people were rude and had
not the coming of yght ynge nor armor / anon he subdued unto him all Asiam.
And there was made the first Monarche in the eest party. And when his heart
was sorry for the death of his fader Belus / he made to be made to him for his
comfort an image of his fader. to whom he gaf so mighty reverence that what
someuer gylty man had fled to that image there should no man do unto him no
hurt / and he pardonned him of all his trespasse^ And through his ensample many
a man began to worship the deed image / of their dear friends. Then these
malycyous spyrites seeing the curyosyte of the people / hid them within them /
and gaaf answers unto the people / and said they were gods. And commanded
them to do reverence unto them as gods Thus that unhappy sin of ydolatry
was brought in / the which repugned myghtely to gods mageste. And in so
much this madness grew. that he should suffer the pain of death that said /
they were men but gods.

went from Vr of Calde / and passed in to Chartam with his childern and his

Nemroth reigned there the which was called an other name Amraphel the king of

said to be Nemroth but he is called here amraphel. And Abraham had many wives /
as Sara and Agar. and his childern and his brethern had many childern But for

noble faders (sed vide pla ^ine gen^) Melchisedech this time was king of Sale^.
This man was called a right wys king / for his exceeding holiness And he
offered bred and wine to Abraham in sign of a great mystery. He was also the
priest of the hye god. Semiramis ye third king of Babylon / he ordained an
army / and went into ynde and opteyned that country. And so by all Asya^ / the
kingdom of Assuriorum was dilated. and he multiplied ye cite of Babylon
myghtly. and made walls about it. This Semiramis had a wife and he forsook her
and it is wryte^ that she was slain of her sone Ninus / by cause she provoked
him to the unlawful co^cupysce^ce (sic di. Au. viii.dcci. dei.) and ye master
i^ hes stories says that she wedded her own sone and he gate a child on her
/ the which ordened babylon / to be ye heed of al his reame. Ninus the fourth
king of Babylon was sone to great Ninus. Of this man little is written but that
he slew his own mother as is said before Arrius was the fyfth king of Babylon.
And under him was borne ysaac.

BOcci was bishop in Israel then. Abimalech the.viii. Judge in Israel was
natural son^e to gedeon. and he was not called of god / but malycyously took
on him the pryncehode of Israel. And he slew lxx of his brethern / wherefore he
ended his life myscheuously (Vt pz iudicu^) Tola was ye.ix. Judge in Israel. And
this man guyded him after the old governance of Iuges / by the manner of
dyreccyon and counsel / more than by domynacyon Bocci was bishop about this
time / but of him little is written. Iayr the.x. Judge of Israel had.xxx. son^es
whom he made princes of.xxx. Cytees. And by cause they were good men and ruled
to the pleasure of god. Therefore in the days of these two men. Israel drew to
our lord. And therefore al thing came and was in prosperyte and welthe.

FAnus was the.iiii. king in ytaly and he was king of larentin both. Latinus
was king in ytaly after Fanus / and of this Latinus was called ye kingdom of
Latinorum. And Carmentes daughter of Euandri found first latin letters.
Tauranus about this time was king of Babylon or of Assiriorum / and under this
man Troy was dystroyed first. The occasyo^ of the batayl of Troy began for a
little thing In so much as Lamydon king of Troy received not Hercules and
Jason with due honor / as they should have received / and of so little a
trespaas / how many harms and hurtes grew. Sibilla delphica before the battle
of Troy prophe^yed / how a child should be borne of a vyrgyn without man's
seed. Lamydo^ king of Troy was slain / and his daughter Roxoma was taken in
to Grekys land. For ye which follows mighty battle and most ferdfull
myscheues (vide hystoria troianam) Hercules with Jason destroyed Iliu^ or Troy
ye which anon after was builded of Pryamus son^e to Lamydon. This Hercules
did many merueylous things and many mighty bataylles. And infynyte lesynges
ben feigned on him. At ye last when he had overcome much people / he was sore
hurt in war. And when he might not suffer the pain of his sore with the
which he was grieved. Himself he ran in to the fire / and when he was deed /
he was worshypped among the goods of ye Gentyles myghtely.

AFter the death of Iayr Judge of Israel the people of Israel added new sins
to their old. And our lord took them in to the power of Philistiens and to
the children of Amo^ xviii. year. And they were gretely oppressed / and then
they cried to our lord. Then^e Repte was espied with almighty god / and
faught against Amon and sedycyous people of the hylle of Effraym. And for an
vnprudent voys he s^ewe his own daughter folysshly / and did sacrefyse to god

was named other wise Boos ye which wedded Ruth. Abialon the xii^. Judge of
Israel was Judge.x. year. And under these times ye children of Israel were

ye.xiiii. Judge governed in Israel.viii. years. And about this time the
hystorye of Ruth was written. Authamanis this time was king of Asseri^ and
Priamus king of troy son^e to Lamido^ ye builded his cite again merueylously
strong. And began batayl with the Greeks unto his own hurt. And he had a

was faithful and wise and Incomparable of strength and noblenes. This Priamus
had an other son^e that was called paris ye which took away fro ye lord of
greeks helena wife to me nelaius ye king. Agamenon ye king brother to Menelaius
the leder of all the Greeks host faught against Troy / and at the last he
wanne the Cite falsely / and to the Greeks most shame and sclaunder that might
be. For certainly that might be called an unhappy battle where no man gives
loving to ye Greeks / but every man reports shame.

Eneas was king of ytaly three year. And this Eneas after Troy was destroyed
of the Greeks / that came i^to ytaly with.xx. ships and did mighty batayles
there. And this man had wedded Priamus daughter Elinsaram. And he was made a
god thrughe the error of the common people / and of this man came Julius cezar
and Octauianus augustus. Vlixes an eloquent man among all ye Greeks / after
many perils on the sea went home to his Penelopem. the most faithful and
the most chaste woman that is radde of. And the Greeks perysshed wretchedly
after that they had destroyed Troy / both on the water and on the land as
they went home ward again. And that was ye pryncypal date of their writing
after that victory. For they wrote their hystoryes and other wrytynges (sic
a^no primo. vel secu^do. etc^. post Troiam captam) And that was the third year
of abdon Judge of Israel.

Incipit regnu^ Britanie. nu^c dicitur Anglia. Here may ye se how London first
began at Albion Albion

Before that I will speak of Brute / it shall be showed how the land of
England was first named Albion / and by what encheson it was so named.

OF the noble land of Sirrie / there was a ryal king and mighty and a man of
great renown / that was called Dyoclesya^ that well and worthily him governed
and ruled through his noble cheualry. So that he conquered all the lands
about him / so that almoost all the kings of ye world to him were attendau^t.
It befell thus that this Dyoclesya^ spowsed a gentyl damoysell that was wonder
fair / that was his uncles daughter Labana. and she loved him as reason would
/ so that he gate upon her.xxxiii daughters / of the which ye eldest was
called. A bine. And these damoyselles wha^ they came unto aege became so fair
that it was wonder whereof Dyoclesyan anon let make a somonynge / and
commanded by his letters that all ye kings that held of him should come at a
certain day / as in his letters were contained to make a feast ryall. At
which day thither they came / and brought with them Admyralles princes and
dukes / and noble chyualry. The feast was ryally arrayed / and there they lived
in Joy and mirth enough / that it was wonder to wit. And it befell thus /
that Dyoclesyan thought to mary his daughters among al tho kings that were at
that solempnyte. And so they spoke and did / that Albine his eldest daughter
and al her systers rychely were married unto xxxiii. kings / that were lords
of great honor and of power at this solempnyte. And wha^ the solempnyte was
done / every king took his wife and ladde them in to their own country and
there made them queen's. And it befell thus afterward that this dame Albine
became so stout and so stern / that she told little price of her lord / and
of him had scorn and dyspyte and would not do his will / but she would have
her own will in diverse matters. And al her other systers every chone bare them
so evil against their lords that it was wonder to wit. And for as much that
the^ thought that their husbondes were not of so high parentage come as their
fad But those kings that were their lords / would have chastysen them with
fair manner upon al love and frendshyp that they should amend their
selfwylled condycyons. But all was for naught / for they did their own will in all thing that the^ lyked. and had of power. wherefore those.xxxiii. kings upon
a time and often times beat their wives. For they we^de that they would amend
their tatches. And their wickedness. But of such condycyons they were / that
for fair speech and warning / they did all ye wors / and for betynges often
times much the wors. Wherefore the king that had wedded Albine wrote the
tatches and condycyons of his wife Albine / and sent the lettre to Dyoclesyan
his fader. And when the other kings herd that Albines lord had sent a
lettre to Dyoclesyan. anon they sent letters sealed with their seals the
condycyons and tatches of their wives. when the king Dyoclesyan saw and herd
so many playntes of his daughters. He was sore ashamed ^ and became wonder
angry and wroth toward his daughters and thought. how he then^e might amend
it that they so mysdyde. And anon sent his letters unto the.xxxiii. kings
that they should come to him: and bring with them their wives euerychone at a
certain day. For he would there chastyse them of their wickedness / if he
might in any manner wise. So the kings came all at that time and day that then
was set between him and the kings. Dyoclesyan received them with much
honor / and made a solemn feast to all that were underneath his lordshyp.
And the third day after that solempnyte / the king Dyoclesyan sent after
his.xxxiii. daughters that they should come and speak with him in his chamber.
And when they were come / he spoke to them of their wyckednes and of their
cruelte and spytefully them repreued and blamed / and to them he said. That if
they would not be chastysed / they should his love lose for evermore. And when
the ladies herd all this / they became abashed and greatly ashamed. And to
their fader they said / that they would make al amends and so they departed
out of their faders chamber. And dame Albine that was the eldest sister ladde
them alto her chamber / and then made to void all that were therein so that no
person was among them but she and her systers together. Then said Albine. My
fair systers well we know that ye king our fader us has reproved shame and
despised / for because to make us obedyen^ unto our husbondes. But certes that
shall I never whiles that I live / sithe that I am come of a more higher kings
blood than mine husbonde. And when she had thus said / all her systers said
the same. And the^ said Albine well I wot fair systers that our husbondes
have co^playned unto our fader upon us wherefore he has us thus foul reproved
and despised wherefore sister my counsel is / that this night when our
husbondes ben a bid / all we with one assente for to kytte their throtes and
then we may be in peace of them And beter we now do this thing under our
faders power than other where else. And anon all the ladies consented and
granted to this counsel. And when night was comen / the lords and ladies
went to bed / And anon as their lords were a sleep / they kette all their
husbo^des throtes / and so they slew them all. when that Dyoclesyan their
fader herd of this thing / he became furyously wroth against his daughters /
And anon would them all have burnt. But all the barons and lords of Sirrie
cou^seyled not so for to do such streytnesse to his own daughters / but only
should void the land of them for ever more so that they never should come
again / and so he did. And Dyoclesyan that was their fader anon commanded
them to go in to a ship / and delivered to the^ vytaylles for half a yere^
And when this was done / all the systers went in to the ship and saylled
forth in the sea / and betoke all their friends to Apolin that was their god.
And so long they saylled in the sea / till at the last they came and arrived in
an isle / that was all wilderness. And when dame Albion was come to that land
and all her systers. This Albyne went first forth out of the ship / and said
to her other systers. For as much said she as I am the eldest sister of all
this company / and first this land has taken / and for as much as mine name
is Albine. I will that this land be called Albion / after mine own name. And
anon al her systers granted to her with a good will Tho went out all the
systers of the ship and took the land Albion as there sister called it. And
there they went up and down / and found neither manne woman / ne child /
but wild beestes of diverse kinds. And when the vytaylle were dyspended and
they failed / they fed them with herbs and fruits in the season of the year
/ and so they lived as they best might. And after that they took flesh of
diverse beestes and became wonder fat. And so they desired man's company /
and man's kind that the^ failed. And for hete they waxed wonder courageous of
kind / so that they desired more man's company than any other solace and
myrthe wha^ the devil that perceived went by diverse countrees and took a
body of ye air and liking natures shed of men / and came in to the land of
Albion / and lay by tho wym^en and shadde tho natures upon them and they
conceived / and after brought forth gyau^tes. Of ye which one was called
Gogmagog / and an other Longherigam And so they were named by diverse names /
and in this manner they came forth and were borne horrible gyau^tes in Albion
And they dwelled in caves and in hills at there will And had the land of
Albion as them lykyd / unto ye time that Brute arrived and came to Tornes that
was in the isle of Albion. And there this Brute conquered and dyscomfyted the
gyauntes abouesayde.

Explicit prima pars.
Here begins now how Brute was gotten / and how he slew first his mother /
and after his fader. And how he conquered Albion / that after he named Brytayne
after his own name that now is called England after ye name of Engyst of
Saxony. This Brute came in to Brytayne about the.xviii. year of Hely.
BE it known that in the noble cytee of great Troy / there was a noble knight
and a man of great power that was called Eneas. And when the cite of Troy was
lost and destroyed through them of Greece. This Eneas with all his meyne fled
the^s and came to Lombardy. That the^ was lord and gouernoure of ye land a
king that was called Latyne. And an other king there was that was called
Turocelyne / that strongely warred upon this king Latyne / that oftentimes
did him much harm And wha^ this king Latyne herd that Eneas was come / he
received him with much honor / and him with held for as much as he had
herd of him / and wist well that he was a noble knight and a worthy of his body
and of his deeds. This Eneas helped king Latyne i^ his war / And shortly for
to tell / so well and so worthily he did that he slew Turocelyne / and
discomfyted him and all his people. And when all this was done / king Latyne
gaaf all that land that was Turocelynes / to this noble man Eneas in marriage
with Lauyne his daughter ye most fairest creatue that any man wist. And so
they lived together in yoy^ and myrthe all the days of there lyftyme And after
Ascanius sone to Eneas wedded a wife / and upon her he gate a sone that was
called Silueyne. And this Silueyne when he could some reason of man / vnwetynge
his fader and aenst his will aqueyted him with a damoysell that was cosyn to
Lauyne that was king Latynes daughter ye queen that was Eneas wife / and
brought the damaysell with child. And when Ascanius his fader it wist / anon
let enqueyre of ye wysest masters and of ye grettest clerks / what child
the domoysell should bring forth / and they answerde and said / that she
should bring forth a sone that shalde kylle both his fader and also his
mother. And so he did. For his mother deyed in berynge of him. And when this
child was borne / his fader let call hi^ Brute And the masters said that he
should do much harm and sorrow in many diverse places / and after he should
come to great honor and worship. This king Ascanius deyed when god would / and
Silueyne his sone received the land / and made him wonderly well beloved
among his people. And so wha^ Brute that was Silueynes sone was.xv. year old
/ he went upon a day with his fader for to play and solace. And as Brute
should have shot unto an heart / his arowe myshappe and gla^ced / and so there
Brute slew his fader.

How Brute was dreuen out of the land / and how he held him in Greece.
ANd when this myschau^ce was befall all ye people of the land made sorrow
enough and were sore an angered. And for enche son there of they drove brute out
of the lord / and would not suffer him among them. And wha^ he saw that he
might not there abide / he we^ from thens in to Greece / and there he
found.vii. thousand men that were of the lygnage and kynred of Troy that were
come of great blood as the story tells / as of men and wymmen and chyldern /
the which were all hollde in thraldom and bondage of the king Pandras of
Greece / for the death of Achilles that was betrayed and slain at troy. This
brute was a wonder fair man and a strong and a huge of his age and of glad
there and semblaunt / and also worthy of body / and was well beloved among his
people. This king Pandras herd speak of his goodness and his conditions / and
anon made him dwell with him so that brute became wonder preuy and much
beloved with the king / so that long time brute dwelled with the king So at
the last they of Troy and brute spoke togyders of kynred and of lygnage and of
acquayntaunce / and there playned them unto Brute of there sorrow and of there
bondage / and of many other shames that the king Pandras had them done. And
unto brute they said upon a time. ye be a lord of our lygnage and a strong
man and a mighty ^ ye be our capytayne and lord / and gouernoure / and we will
become your men / and your commandments do in all manner of things / and
bring us out of this wretchedness and bondage / and we will fight with the
king for truth with ye grace of the great god / we shall him overcome and we
shall make you king of the land and to you do homage / and of you we shall
hold ever more. Brute had tho great pity of their bondage that they were
brought i^. And preu^ly went then from the kings court and tho them that
were of Troy / went and put them in to woods and in to mountains and them
there held. And sent unto king Pandras / that he should give them leave
sauely for to we^de out of the land / for they would no l^nger dwell in his
bondage. The king Pandras wexed tho sore anoyed and tho swore that he should
slay them euerychone / and ordained a great power and went to ward them all
for to fight. But Brute and his men ma^ly them defended and fyerfly fought and
slew all the kings men that none of them escaped / and took the king and
held him in prison / and ordained counsel bytwen them what they might done
And some said that he should be put to death / and some said that he should
be exiled out of ye land And some said / that he should be bre^te. And tho
spoke a wise kynght that was called Mempris / and said to Brute and to all tho
of Troy. if king Pandras would yield him and have his life. I counsel that he
give unto Brute that is our duke and our sovereign / his daughter Gennogen to a
wife / and in marriage with her an ho^dred ships well arrayed / and all his
tresoure of gold and silver of corn and of wine / and as much as we need to
have of ^o thing and other. and then^e go we out of this land / and ordained
us a land else where. For we neno^e of our kynred that come after us shall
never have peace in this land among them of Greece. For we have slain so many
of there knights and of other fre^des that ever more war and contake should
be among us Brute tho and all his folk consented well to that counseyll. And
this thing they told to king Pa^dras. And he for to have his life granted as
much as they axed / and anon gaf unto Brute Gennogen his daughter to wife /
and an hundred ships with asmoche / as them neded of all vytaylles / as before
was ordained Brute tho took his wife and all his men / that forsook the land
of Greece and went them unto the sea and had wind and weder at their will and
came ye third day in to an I Will that was called Lorgers. This Brute anon
sent of his men a land for to espy the manner of the country. And they
found an old cite all wasted and forlet that was there in another man ne woman
/ ne no thing dwelling / and in the mydeell of this cite they found an old
temple of a fair lady that was called Dyana the goddess. And they came again
unto Brute and told him what they had seen and found. And they counseled him
to goo and do sacrefyce unto dame Dyana / for she was wo^te to give answer of
what ever men prayed her and namely unto them that her honored with sacrefyce.
Brute went unto that yamge and said Dyana noble goddess that all thing haste
in thy might and power / wyndes / waters. woods / field / and all thing of
the world / and all manner of beestes that theryn ben. To you I make my prayer
/ that ye me counseyll and tell / where / and in what place: I shall have a
couenable dwelling for me and for my people and there I shall make in honor of
you a well fair temple and a noble / wherein ye shall always be honored / wha^
he had done his prayer. Dyana answered in this manner Brute said she go even
forth thy way over the sea in io France to ward the west / and there ye shall
find an isle that is called Albion / and that isle is be compassed all with the sea / and no man may come there in but it be by ships and in that land were
wont to dwell gyauntes / but now it is not so / but all wyldernes. And that
land is destenyed and ordained for you and for your people.

How Corin became Brutes man / and how king Goffar was dyscomfyted.
Then when Brute had this answer of Dyana the gods. Anon he let ye
ancres wind up and sailed in to the high see. And when he and his men had
saylled.xx. days and moo / they found fast besyed a cost of ye see a
thousand men of the lygnage and kynred of Troy. And there sovereign and there
master of all was called Corin^ And when Brute wyste whens they were / he tho
took them with much Joy in to his ships / and ladde them forth wiht him
These Corin there be came brutes man and to him did homage. And so long they
saylled forth in the sea till they came unto Gascoyne. And anon they arrived in
the haven of Lyegers and there they dwlled.viii. days them for to rest. and
there saylles to amend there that it was need. Tidings soon came to king
Goffar that was lord of that lord how that much people of strange land
were arrived in to his lord in ye haven of Lyegres wherefore he was sore
angreged and anoyed / that they came and arrived in his land without his
license and his leave. And anon ordened him a great power for to drive out brute
and to destroy him and all his people. But it was so that king Goffar was
dyscomfyted and all his people. And him self fled in to France / there for
help and socour. And in that time reigned in France ^xii. kings / and an.xi.
of them assembled a great power for to help Goffar and for to fight ayest
Brute. This Goffar dwelled with the^ of france half a year and more. And in
the mean time when Goffar was in France. Brute and his company destroyed all
the land of Gascoyne and let take all the tresour that king Goffar had / and
there let bring it all in to his ships And this Brute found in that land
a fayry place and couenable / and there brute made a fair castle and a
strong. when that this was done / king Goffar came from France and.xi. kings
with him and brought with him.xx.M. men for to fight with Brute and his
company and Brute had but.vii.M. and.CCC men. And nevertheless when the two
hosts met together. Brute folk thorugh help of himself: and of Turin his
cosen: and of Corin ye well and manly him defended: and fought so till that in
little time they had slain of the Frensshemen two thousand and mo. Anon
all that were alive fled away. And in this bataylle Turin Brutes cosyn was
slain. And Brute let entere him worthily when he had space and leyser in the
castle that he had made: and tho let call that same castle Toures: For by
cause of the name of Turin that there was entered. And yet unto this day there
is a noble cite that is called Toures. And king Goffar wyste that Turin was
deed he came again with his men: and after yaue a strong bataylle unto Brute.
But brute and his men were so weary for fighting: that they might no longer
endure: but to megre him and all his. And then Brute yede in to his castle
with his men: and made the gates fast for to save them: and for to take
counsel amoage them what were best for to do. Brute and Corin gaaf counsel
and ordained pryuely: that Corin should go out and busshe him i^ a wood till
on the morn so that in the morning when that Brute should fight with his
enemies: then Corin should come with his folk in the one side: and slay and
do all the harm that he might. And in a morning in the dawning of the day
Brute went out of the castle: and fyersely faughte with his enmyes: and they
manly deffended them. But within a little time Brute and his folk slew.viii.
hundred of king Goffars men. Then came Corin with ye busshement and smote to
ground he and his company all those that would stand or abide. So that the
king Goffar and his company were dysco^fyted: and fast they began to flee And
brute and Corin with there company fyersely them pursewed and slew mo of them
in ye fleing than they did in ye battle. And i^ this manner Brute had the
victory. and nevertheless brute made much sorrow for his cosyn Turi^ that there
was slain and other also that he haded lost of his men. That is to say. vii^
hundred and.xv. The which nobly he entered in the same castle of Toures /
there where he had entered Turin his cosyn.

How Brute arrived at Totnesse in the isle then called Albion / and of the
bataylle that was betwixt Corin and Gogmagog.
SO when all this was done Brute would no longer there dwell / for to fight /
nor for to lose no moo of his people. For king Goffars people might every
day encreace / mo and moo. And Brutes lossened. And therefore he took all his
men and went unto the sea and had wend and weder at their will. And the fyfth
day after they arrived in an haven at Totnesse / and came in to the isle of
Albion And there neither man nor woman as the story tells they found but
Gyau^tes. And they dwelled in hills and in caves. And Brute saw the land was
fair and at his liking. And was good also for him and for his people / as
Dyan a the goddess had him behyght. And therefore was Brute wonder glad and
let assembled upon a day all his ^ol^e to make a solemn sacrefyce and a
great feast in honor and reverence of Dyana the goddess of the which he
had counseyll first for to come in to this land. And then when that they
had there solempnyte done / as they upon a day sat at there meet / there

London.
depiction of London BRute and his men went forth / and saw about in diverse
places / where that they might find a good place and couenable that they might
make a Cite for him and his folk. And so at the last they came by a fair
River that is called Tamys and / there Brute began to build a fair cite / and
let call it new Troy / in mind and remembrance of the great Troy / from
the which place all there lygnage was comen. And this Brute let fell down
woods / and let eere and sow lands And also let mawe down meadows for
sustenaunce of him and of his people. And then he departed the land to them
/ so that euery^he of them had a part / and a certain place for to dwell
in. And then Brute let call this land Brytayne after his own name and
his folk he let call Brytons. And this Brute had gotten on his wife Gennogen
three sons / that were worthy of deeds. The first was called Lotrin / the
second Albanak and the third Cambar. And brute bare crown in the cytee of
Troy.xx. year after the time that the cytee was made. And there he made ye
laws that the Brytons hold / and this brute was wonderly well beloved among
all men. And Brutes sons also loved wonderly well togyder^ And when Brute had
sought all the land in length and also in bread he found a land that Joined
to Brytayne / that was in the north and that land Brute yaue to Albanak his
sone. And let call it Albanie after his name / that now is called Scotlonde.
And Brute found an other country toward the weste / and yaue that to Cambar
his other sone / and let call it Cambar after his name / and now is called
walys. And when Brute hadne reigned.xx. year as before is said / then^e he deyed
in the Cite of new Troy.

How Lotrin that was Brutes sone entered with much honor / and governed the
land well and worthily.
AFter Brute reigned Lotri^ hes sone / that was the second king in Brytayne.
The which began to regne the second year of Samuel. And this Lotrin was
crowned king with much solempnyte and glory of all the land of Brytayne.
And after when he was crowned king. Albanak and Cambar his two brethern went
again into their own country and there they lived with much honor / and
worship. And Lotri^ their brother reigned / and was king and governed it well
and wisely for he was a good man and wonderly well beloved of all his land.
And it befell so that Albanak dwelled in his own land with much honor and
worship. And then came king Humbar of Hunlonde with a grate power and aryued
in Albyne / and would have conquered the land / and began to war upon king
Albanak was slain / the people of that land fled unto Lotrin and told him
for he was king of brytayne / how that his brother was slain / and prayed him
of his help and of his socour for to avenge his brothers death. Lotrin there
anon let assemble all the Brytons of Kente / of Dover in to Dear went of
Norfolk and Southfolke / of Keftefen / and Lyndessey. And when they were
assembled they spedde them fast toward there enemies for to give them battle
And Lotrin had sent to Cambar his brother that he should come unto him with
all the power that he might make him for to help / and to he did with a good
will. And so they came togyders / and took there way pryuely for to go and seek
Humbar where they might him find. And so it befell that this Humbar was beside
a water that was a great River with his folk / him for to dysporte. And there
came Lotrin and Cambar his brother with all there people suddenly or that any of
that other wyste. And when Humber saw them come he was sore adradde / for as
much as his men wist it not before / and also they were unarmed. And anon
Humbar for dredde lepte in too the water / and drowned him self / and so he
deyed / and hes men were all slain so that none of the^ escaped. And therefore
is that water called Hu^bar / and ever more shall be for by cause that these king
Humbar therein was drowned. And after that Lotrin went to his ships and took
there gold and silver as much as he found unto him self. And all that other
pylfre he gaf unto other foke of the host. And they found in one of the
ships a fair damoysell / that was king Humbars daughter / and she was
called Estrylde^ And when Lotrin saw her / he took her with him for her
fayrnesse / And for her he was overtaken in love, and would have wedded her.
This tidings came to Corin / and anne thought to avenge him upon Lotrin. For
as much as Lotrin had made couenau^^ for to spowse Corins daughter / that was
called Guentolin. And Corin in haste went unto him unto new Troy / and thus
he said to Lotrin. Now certes said he / ye reward me full evil / for the
pains that I have suffered and had many times for Brute your fader. And
therefore sith it is so I will aue^ge me now upon you. And he drew his fawcon on
high and would have slain this Lotrin the king. But the damoysell went
between tho and made them to be accorded in this manner. That Lotrin should
wedde or spowse Guentolin that was Corins daughter / and so Lotrin did. And
netheles when that he had spowsed Guentolin Corins daughter / pryuely he came
to Estrylde / and brought her with child / and gate upon her a daughter / the
which was called Abram. And it be fell so that anon after Corin deyed / and
after when he was deed. Lotrin forsook Guentolin that was his wife / and made
Estrelde queen. And there Guentolin that was his wife went from thens all in
great ire and wrath unto Cornwayle / and there seized all the land in to her
own hand / for as much as she was her faders heir she vndetoke feautes and
homages of all the men of the land. And after ward assembled a great host
and a great power of men / for to be avenged upon Lotrin that was her lord /
and to him came and give him a strong battle and there was Lotrin her
husbonde slain and his men dyscomfyted in the v. year of his regne. Guentolin
let take Estrylde and Abram her daughter / and bound the^ bo^he hand and foot
/ and cast them both in to a water / and so they were drowned wherefore that
water was evermore after called. Abram / after the name of the da^moyseyll that
was Estryldes doughter^ And English men call that water Seuerne / And
walsshtmen call it Abram unto this day to. And when this was done Guentolin
let crown her queen of all the land / and governed the land full well and
wisely unto the time that Madan her sone that Lotrin had gotten upon her was
of.xx. year of aege that he might be king and so the queen regnd.xv. year.
And then let she crown her sone king / and he reigned and governed the
land well and worthily. And she went in to Cornewaylle / and there she
dwelled all her lives time.

How Madan reigned in peace all his life.

well and nobly. This king Leyr had three daughters. The first was called
Gonorill. The second Rigan. And the third Cordeill / and the youngest daughter
was fairest and best of condycyons. The king their fader became an old man /
and would that his daughters were married or that he dyed. But first he thought
to assaye which of them loved him most and best. For she that loved him best
should best be married And he axed of ye first daughter how well she loved him.
And she answerde and said / better than her own life. Now certes said her
fader / that is great love: Then he axed the second daughter: how much she
loved him. And she said more and passing all the creatures of the world. Per
ma foy said her fader I may no more axe. And tho axed he of the third daughter
how much she loved him Certes fader said she: my systers have told you
glosynge words: but I shall tell you the crouth for I love you as I ought to
love my fader. And for to bring you more in certain how I love you. I shall
tell you. As much as ye be wroth: so shall ye be loved The king her fader
we^de that she had scorned him and be came wonder wroth: and swore by heaven and
earth she should never have good of him but hes doughts that loved him so much
should be well auau^ced and married. And the first daughter he married to Mangles
king of Scotlonde. And the second he married to hanemos earl of Cornewayle and
they ordened and spoke between the^ that ye should depart the reame between
them two after the death of king Leyr their fader. So that Cordeill his
youngest daughter should nothing have of his land. But this Cordeill was
wonder fair and of good condicyons and manners That the king of France Agampe
herd of her fame / and sent to the king Leyr her fader for to have her unto
his wife / and prayed him thereof. And king Leyr her fader sent him word that
he had departed his land and given hit al unto his two daughters before said:
and he said he had no more lord wherewith her to marye. And when Agampe the
king of france herd this a^swere / he sent anon again to Leyr and said.
That he axed nothing with her but oonly her clothing and her body. And anon
king Leyr sent her over see to the king of france. And he received her with
much worship / and with solempnyte he spowsed her / and made her queen of
France.

How king Leyr was driven out of his lord through his folk. And how Cordeill
his youngest daughter help him in his need.
THus it befell afterward / that tho two eldest daughters would not abide till
Leyr their fader was deed. But warred upon him whiles that he was on live and
did him much sorrow and shame / wherefore they took from him holy ye realm /
and between them had ordained / that one of the^ should have king Leyr to
soiourne all his life time with.lx. knights and squyres / that he might
worshypfully ride and go whether that he would and in to what country that him
lyked to play and to solace. So that Maugles king of Scotlonde had king
Leyr with him in the manner as is above said And or the other half year were
passed. Gonoril that was his eldest dought and queen of Scotlonde / was so
anoyed of him and of his people that anon she and her lord spoke together
wherefore his knights half and his squyres fro him were gone / and no moo
left with him but oonly.xxx. And when this was done / Leyr began to make much
sorrow for because that his state was empeyred. And men had of him more scorn
and dyspyte than ever they had before. wherefore he wist not what to done. And
at the last he thought he would go in to Cornewayll to Rigan his other
daughter. And when he was come / the earl and his wife that was Leyrs daughter
him welcomed / and with him made much Joy. And there he dwelled with xxx.
knights and squyres. And he had not dwelled scarsly.xii. months there / that
his daughter was weary of him and his company. And her lord and she of him had
great scorn and despyte / so that from.xxx. knights they brought unto.x.
And afterward he had but five / and so they left him no moo. Then made he
sorrow enough. and said sore weeping. Alas that ever I came in to this land
and said. yet had ye be better to have dwelled with my first daughter. And
anon he went thens to his first daughter again / but anon as she saw him
come / she swore by god and by his holy name / and by as much as she might:
that he should have no moo with him but one knight \ if he would there abide.
Then began Leyr to weep. and made much sorrow: and said then. Alas now have
I to long lived / that this sorrow and myscheyf is to me now fallen. For now
I am poor: that sometime was rich. But now have I no friend ne kynne that to
me will do any good. But when I was rich all men me honored and worshyped and
now every man ^athe of me scorn and dyspyte. And now I well wot that Cordeill
my youngest daughter said me troth / when she said. As much as I had so
much should I be loved. And all ye while that I had good: so long was I loved
and honored for my riches. But my two daughters glosed me then: and now of me
they set little price. and soth told me Cordeil: but I would not believe it ne
understand. and therefore I let her goo from as a thing that I set little
price of: and now wot I never what for to do sith my two daughters have me
thus dysceyued: that I so much loved: and now must I needs seek her that is in
an other land: that lightly I let her go from me without any reward of
gifts. And she said / that she loved me as much as she ought to love her
fader by all manner of reason And then I should have a^ed her no more. And those
that me otherwise behoteth through their falls speech: now have me desceyued. In
this manner Leyr long time began to make his moon: and at ye last he shypped
him to ye see and passed over in to France: and axed and aspyed where ye queen
might be found. And men told him where she was* and when he came to ye cite
that she was in pryuely he sent his squyre unto the queen / for to tell her
that her fader was come to her for great need. And when the squyre came to the
queen / he told her every deal of her systers from the beginning unto the
end. Cordeil ye queen anon took gold and silver plenty / and took it to the
squyre in counsel that he should go and bear it to her fader / and that he
should go in to a certain cite / and him array and wasshe / and then come
again to her. And bring with him an honest company of knights.xl. at ye
leest with their meny. And then he should send to her lord ye king / and
feyne that he were come for to speak with his daughter / and him for to se and
so he did. And when the king and the queen herd that they came: with much
honor they him received. And ye king of france then let lend through al ye
realm / and commanded that al men should be as entendau^t to king Leyr the
queen's fader in all manner of things as it were unto himself. wha^ king leyr
had dwelled there a month and more / he told to the king and to the queen
his daughter / how his two eldest daughters had him served. Agampe anon let
ordeyne a great hooste of Frensshme^ and sent in to Brytayne with Leyr ye
queen's fader for to co^quere his lord again and his kingdom. And Cordeill
also came with her fader in to Brytayne / for to have ye realm after her
faders death. And anon they went to ship and passed the sea and came in to
Brytayne and fought with ye felons / and the^ dyscomfyted and slew / and then
had he his lord again / and after lived.iii. year and held his realm i^
peace and after ward dyed. and so Cordeill his daughter then let enter him

How Morgan and Conedag that were neuewes to Cordeill warred upon her. And put

NOw as king Leyr was deed Cordeil his youngest daughter reigned the.x. year of
Ozias king of Jury. And after her reigned Conedag the.xv. year of Ozias: and
Cordeil that was Leyrs youngest daughter after ye death of her fader had all the
land.v. year. And in ye mean time deyed her lord Agampe / hat was king of
France: and after his death she was wydowe. And there came Morgan and Conedag
that were Cordeils systers sons and to her had enuyte: for as much as their
aunte should have the land. So that between them they ordained a great power:
and upon her warred gretely. And never they rested till they had her taken and
put her unto death. And tho Morgan and Conedag seized all the land / and
departed it between them. And they held it.xii. years. And when that
those.xii. years were gone there began^e between them a great beatel / so that
they warred stro^gely togyders. And eueryche of them did other much disease.
For Morgan would have all the land from beyond Humbre that Conedag held /
But he came against him with a great power / so that Morgan durst not abide
but fled a way in to walys. And Conedag pursued him / and took him and slew
him. And tho came Conedag again and seized all the land in to his hand and
held it And reigned after.xxxiii^ year. And then he deyed and lyth at new
Troy.

And by cause the matere conteyneth most comodyously together of ye kings of
Brytayne / now called England / for ye time of them is not certainly known /
what time of ye wrolde the kings folowen reigned. Therefore they shall be
together / till it be comen unto Guentolen king of Brytayne now called England

How Reynolde that was Conedags sone reigned after his fader: and in his time it
rayned blood three days in to kenynge of great death.
ANd after this Conedag reigned Reynolde hes sone that was a wise knight and a
hardy and curteyes that well and nobly governed the land / and wonder well
made him beloved of all manner of folk. And in his time reigned blood that
lasted three days. As god would / and soon after there came a great death of
people / For hosts without nombre of people fought till that almighty god there
of took mercy and pity and tho ga^ it cesse. And this Reynolde reigned.xxii.
year and deyed and lies at york.

How Gorbodian regne in peace that was Reynoldes sone.
AFter this Reynolde that was Conedags sone / reigned Gorbodian that was this
Reynoldes sone ^xv. year / and then he deyed and lies at york.

How Gorbodian had.ii. sons and how that one slew the other for to have the
heritage / and how ydoyne there mother slew that other wherefore the land was
destroyed.
SO when this Gorbodian was deed / his two sons that he had be came stout and
proud and ever warred together for the land. And that one was called Ferres /
and that other Porres. And this Ferres would have all the land / but that
other would not suffer him. This Ferres had a felonous heart and thought through
treason to slay his brother. But pryuely he went in to France / and there
abode with the king Sywarde till upon a time when he came again / and fought
wych his brother Ferres / But full evil it happed tho / he was slain first.
when ydoyne there mother wist that Ports was deed / she made great sorrow / for
by cause that she loved him more than that other. And thought him for to slay
pryuely. And pryuely she came to her sone upon a night with two knyues and there
with kytte his throat / and ye body in to small pieces who herd ever such a
cursed mother / that slew with her own hondes her own sone And long time
after lasted the repreef and shame to the mother / that for by cause of ye one
sone she murdered the other / and so lost them both.

How four kings curtously held all Brytayne / and what were there names ye
shall here after.
AS the two brethern were deed they left not behind them another son ne
dougter / ne none other of the kynred that might have the heritage. And for as
much as the stro^gest me^ drove and descomfyted the febleit and took all there
lo^des so that i^ every country they had great ware and strife under them but
among all other thing / there were among them in the counther / that
overcame all the other / and though there might and strength they took all the
lands / and every of them took a certain country / and in his contree let
call him king / and one of the^ was called Scater / and he was king of
Soctlonde / and that other was called Dawalier / and he was king of Loegers /
and of al ye lord that was Lotris / that was Brutes sone / the third was
called Ruda^ / and he was ki^ge of walys / and the fourth was called Cloten /
and was called king of Cornewayle. But this Cloten should have had all the
land by reason for by cause that there was no man that wyste none so right an
heir as he was. But they that we strongest set little by them that were of
less estate / and therefore this Cloten had no more land among them but
Cornewaylle

Of king Donebant that was Clotens sone wanne the land.
THis Cloten had a sone that was called Donebant: that after the death of his
fader became an hardy man and a fair and a curteis so that he passed al ye
other kings of fayrenesse and of worthynesse and ano^e a he was knight he
wyste well that wha^ his fader lived he was most ryghtfull heir of all ye
land: and should have had by reason. But ye other kings that were of a much
more strength than he was: took from him his land. And after ward this
Donebant ordened him a great power and conquered first all the land of
Loegers and after he would have conquered all the land of Scotlo^de and walys.
And Scater came with his men and yaue him battle. And Rudac came again with his
walysshmen for to help him* but so it befell that Rudac was slain and also
scater in plain battle. And so Donebant had the victory: and conquered all
the land: and well mayntened it in peace and in quyete / that never before it
was so well mayntened.

How Donebant was the first king that ever bare crown of gold in Brytayne.
THis Donebant let make him a crown of gold / and wered the crown upon his
heed as never king did before / and he ordened a statute that and a man had
done never so much harm and mye come i^ to ye Temple / there should no man
him mysdo / but go there in sauete and in peace / and after go in to what land
or country that him pleased without any harm / and if any man set any ho^de
upon him He then^e should lose his life And this Doneba^t made the town of
Malmesbury / and ye town also of the Vyse. And when he had reigned well and
worthily.xl. year / then^e he deyed and lies at new Troy.

How Brenne and Belin departed between them the land after the death of
Donebant there fader. And of the war bewixt them.
ANd after that this Donebant was deed / his sons that he had departed the
land between them / as there fader had ordained so that Belin his eldest sone
had the all the land of brytayne / from Humber South ward. And his brother
Brenne had all the land from Humber unto Scotlond. But for as much that Belin
had the better part. Brenne therefore wexed wroth / and would have had more of
ye land / and belin his brother would grant him no more / wherefore co^take and
war arose among them two But Brenne the younger brother had no might ne
strength against Belin / and therefore Brenne rhrugh counsel of his folk went
from thens in to Norwaeye to ye king Olsynges / and prayed him of help and
socour for to conquer all the land upon Belin his brother upon that covenant
that he would have his daughter to wife and the king Olsynges him granted /
And Belin anon as his brod was gone to Norweye he seized in to his hand all
the land of Northoumberlonde / and took all the castelles and let them be
arrayed and kept the costs of the sea / that Brenne should not arryue in no
side / but that he were taken^ The king Olsynges let assembel a great host
/ and delivered his daughter to Brenne and all the people that he had
assembled. And this damoysell Samie had long time loved a king that was
called Gutlagh and to him she told all her counsel / how that Bren^e should
her have / and her led with him for ever more and so he should lose her but
that she might for sake Brenne. And when Gutlagh had herd this tidings / he
lay for to aspye Bren^e with as many ships as he might have. So the two
fletes met together and long time they faught / so that Brennes men turned
again were dyscomfyted. And king Gutlagh took Samie and put her in to his
ship. And Bre^ne shamefully fled thens as a man dyscomfyted. And this king
Gutlagh would have gone in to his owene country / but there came upon him such
a great tempest that five days lasted / so that thorugh that tempest he was
driven in to Brytayne with three ships and no moo / and tho that kept the
costs of the sea took Gutlagh and Samie and all his folk and them presented
to Belin And Belin put them in prison.

How Belin drove out of his land king Gutlagh of Denmerk and Samie.
IT was not long after that Brenne came again with a great navy / and sent to
his brother Belin / that he should yield again his land to his wife and his folk
/ and his castelles also. Or else he would destroy his land. Belin dradde
no thing his malice / and would no thing do after that he had said.
wherefore Brenne came with his folk and fought with Beline. And then Brenne
was discomfyted and his folk slain / and him self fled wi^h.xii. men in to
France. And this Belin that was Brenne brother went thenue to. york / and
took counsel what he should do with king Gutlagh. For king Gutlagh proferde
to become his man / and for to hold his land fo him yeldynge yearly.M.li. of
silver for evermore / and for surenesse of this couenaut to be kept Gutlagh
sho^de bring him good hostage / and to him should do homage and his folk /
and yet he should swear upon a book yt it should never be broke ne failed.
Belin tho by counseyll of his folk granted him his axenge / and so Gutlagh be
came his man and Belin undertook of him his homage by an oath and by writing
the same couenau^tes. And upon these couenau^tes king Gutlagh took Samie and
his folk and went thens / and turned again to Denmak. Ever more after were the
couenau^tes holden and the treuage paid till the time that Honelus was king of
Denmark and also of his land thorugh his wife Gildebu^h that he had spoused for
she was ryghe heir of his land. This Belin dwelled tho in peace / and worship
fully him held among his barons / and he made four ryall ways / one from
the eest in to the weest and that was called watlynge street / and an other
from the north unto the south / and that is callen Ikelme street. And two
other ways he made in bossynge through out ye lord that one is called fosse
and that other Fosse dyke. And he mayntened well the good laws that Donebant
his fader had made. and ordained in his time / as before is said.

How acordeme^t was made between Bre^ne and Belin thorugh Cornewen there mother.
BRenne that was Belins brother had long time dwelled in France / and there
had conquered a great lordshyp through marriage. For he was duke of Bourgoyne
through the dought of the duke fewyn that he had spoused that was right heir of
the land. And this Brenne ordened a great power of his folk / and also of
France / and came in to this land for to fight with Belin his brother. And
belin came ayenste him with a great power of Brytons / and would tho have yeuen
him battle. But there mother Cornewen that tho lived had that one brother would
have destroyed that other and went between her sons and them made acorde with
much pain So that at the last tho two brethern with much bliss went
together in to new Troy / that now is called London / and there they dwelled a
year. And after they took their counseyll for to goo and conquer all France.
And so they did / and burnt town and destroyed the land both in length and
in bread. And the king of France yaue them batayl with his power / but he was
overcome / and yaue trauge unto Belin and to his brother. And after that they
went forth unto Rome ^ conquered Rome and all Lombardy and Garmany / and took
humage and feaute of earls bacons and of all other. And after they came in to
this land of brytayne / and dwelled there with brytons in Joy and rest. And
tho made brenne the twone of brystowe / and after he went over to his own
lordshyp / and their dwelled he all his life And belin dwelled at new Troy and
there he made a fair gate that is called belynges gate after his own name.
And when this belin had reigned nobly.xi. year he deyed and lies at new Troy.

How king Cormbratus slew the king Cenmark / for by cause that he would not
pay his truage as he should
ANd after this belin reigned his sone Cormbratus a good man and a worthy. And
the king of Denmark would not pay to him his truage that is to say a thousand
pound as he had sworn by oath for to pay it / and also by writing record
to belin his fader. wherefore he was evil appayed and wroth / and assembled a
great host of bry^ons and went in to Denmark and slew the king Gutlagh /
and brought the land in subgec^ion all new. And took of the folk feautes and
homage / and after went ayene in to his own land. And as he came fothe by
Orkeney / he found.xxx. ships full of men and wymmen beside the cost of the sea. and the king ared what they were. And an Earl that was master of them
all curteysly answered unto the king and said. That they were exieled out of
Spane / and so that they had traueyled half an year and more in the sea / to
wit if they might find any king in any land that of them would have pity or
mercy to give them any lord in any country where in they might dwuell and
hauerest / and become his lyege men / and to him would do homage and feuate
while that he lived / and to his heyers after him / and of him and of his
heirs hold that land. And when ye king this herd / he had pity of him /
and yaue them an yel all wilderness / there that no man was dwelling sauf
oonly wild bestes. And the Earl thanked much the king and became his man and
did him homage and feaute and took all his folk and went in to the same isle.
And the Earl was called Irlamall / and therefore he let call the land Irlonde
after his own name. This king Cormbratus came again in to his land and
reigned.xxv. year / and after he deyed and lies at new Troy.

called.M. men of arms the which he named Milites (a numero mi^i^to) But these
were noble blod. Therefore as saint Austyn says (de ciuit^. dei) And also there
was long war betwixt the Sabyns and them. For Romulis took many wymmen of
the noble blood of Sabyns / and married them to that unnoble blood. Of this
Romulus Orosyus writes much evil (Vt patet in libro suo) About this time

this man / now good and now evil. And for by cause scripture concludes that
he ended his life in the loving of god / by the prayer of Danyell / and in the
knowledge of one very god / some doctors say. He is saved / and some say it

Of the governance of Rome till the Emperors began.
AFter this tyraunte was deed the Romans ordened that their sho^de never be
king more in Rome. But they would be governed fro that forth by Co^sules. So
wha^ tho kings had reigned.ii. hundred year and.xl. they made this statute that
two Consules should be chosen: and they should govern the cite and the people.
and for this cause these two were chosen that any of the^ would make any if
excess: the other should govern him. For their was no thing obeyed: but if
they consented both. Also they should not stand in there dygnyte passing one
year: for this cause. That for domynacyon of long time: they should not usurp
upon them more than was right In all this time the Empire of Rome was not
dylated possynge.xii. mile. The first Consules that were made: they called
Lucium and the other Brutu^ / and these two men did great things in their
time But yet ye people bare heavy of their domynacyon / wherefore they chose an
other man / the which should have more auctoryte than they / and they called
him Dictator In this same time their was a great dyscencyon betwixt the people
and the Senate werfore they chose Trybunas with their Iuges over the people /
and defended them fro wrong as says ysyder. For the Dictator when he was
chose he lasted.v. year / and the Trybunas were remeued every year. But ye
must understood that ye shall not have here after all ye Consules named that
governed Rome between ye sessynge of kings / and the beginning of
themperours. For it were to long to write / specially when every year were new
syn / that one man might be chosen so oftentimes as we read / and also for the
endurynge of there governance. For they were governors of Rome.v.C.
year.lxvii. So the most famous men of these shall be reherced / after the
form of Chronicles / and as they stand in the book was echeone after other.

have receded fro the very true faith / as they did before in the time of Jews

Bethuleem / and there was slain of Judith a woman / (vt pz Judith.ii.

king and bishop one year (Vide plaura li. Machabeorum) Publius Lucimius.
Lucius Emilius. Lucius Lucinius. Lucius Consorinus were Consules at Rome. In
whoos time the Cartagynes and the Romans warred strongely^ But the Romans
subdued them / entendynge to have destroyed ye Cartagynes utterly. But among
the Romans there was a notable wise man called Scipio Nauta. And among many
notable cou^seylers two he ga^ specially to be had i^ mind. The first that
Cartago should not be destroyed that through the occasyon of for and bataylles /
a In ward co^corde should abide among the Romans / and a perpetuell strength
for contynuell excercyse of battle. The second. That in no wise the other
should be builded in Rome. For he said that was the most enmye that might be
to ye people that used war For that place nourysshed sloth and provoked
lechery And how wisely this notable man gaaf counseyll / the times following
declares (vide plca in Aug. dei ciuite dei libro.iiii.) yet for all this
counseyll that noble cite of Carcago was destroyed of Cipio and the Senators.
And it burnt.xvii. days contynuelly Many men there were sold / and many men
ran in to the fire wylfully. Corinthus this same year was destroyde of the
Romans / the which was the rychest country of the world. Ptholomeus this
time reigned in Egypt / and was famylyer with the Romans. And so long he and
his predecessors reigned as they kept fydylyte to the Romans. And know every
man that there was none other cause that the power of ye Romans increased so
strongly abue other people / but virtue / the which habundanly rygned in them
/ and namely reght wysnesse which above all thing they used. And as long as
they kept mesures and loved right wysnesse / so long they were never overcome
And as soon as they were corrupted / it is radde / they were ouercome^. It is
had in a certain reuelacyon of god showed to saint Brygyte that our lord god
bears wetnesse to these old Romans. That none in this naturell life lived
more right wisely. And what lyghtes of faith they showed in the time of
Christian relygyon shall be showed after ward.

ARistobolus was the first king and priest in ye Jury this man reigned one
year alone / and took to him the Dyademe of the kingdom. And he held him not
content with that his fader gaaf him in his testamente. But he put his mother
in prison and his brethern. And therefore he perysshed wretchidly with his
brother Antigonus the which was of his counsel and helped him.) Vide
magystrum in historiis (Antigonus brother unto the king was slain through the
enuytee of the queen. lexander was bishop after Arstobolus / and he
stood.xxvii^ year. And he was al atyraunte / all though he appeared sobre in the
beginning. But he made it known what he was in his stomach / for he slew his
own brother. And in.xii. year he slew.l. thousand of the old sage faders of
great virtue / by cause they told him his mysgydyng. Then^e when he should
deye / he left two sons behind him Hircanu^ and Aristobolum. But certainly he
said his wife should regne / for she stood in the grace of the people. Seruius
Flaccus. Lucious. Fabius. Plubius this time were Senators at Rome This time
bataylles amonste them sif began^e. Of the which the first cause and the
beginning / was Graceus a myghhy man / well known with noble Romans / began
to seek a cause against them. And by cause that he might do no thing alone to
them / he meued the common people to them saying / That all the lands and
possessions should be divided equaly / and also the money. etc^. And for that
cause there was an Insurrreccyon / in the which Graccus was slain / and many
myscheues fell after (Vide Orosium) In ye time of these men / there was a
child borne at Rome / having four feet / four arms / two faces and four
eyes. The hylle of Ethna spetted out flammynge fire horrible / and destroyed
the places nyghe about it. And these men berynge rule. Cartago was commanded
to be restored. And it was fulfilled of the Romans people. And there was
mighty battle in the cite of Rome. Fabius with a little host overcame the
king of Armenye And there were drowned an honyred and four score thousa^de men
in the water of Rome. Ptholomeus Alexander was king in Egypt. In his time was
borne Lucerius a Poet / ye which afterward was mad for love of wym^en and
slew himself. Pthoiomeus sone to Cleopatre reigned after him / under whom
Salustius ye noble writer of hystoryes was borne. Ptholomeus Dionisius was
after this man And in his time virgyll and Oracius were borne.

Jacob naturell fader to Joseph of the line of crest is reherted in Luke and
Mathe and little of him is had in scripture. Alexandra wife to Alexander was
bishop in the Jury.ix. year / and showed much tyranny al if she was made
bishop by her feyned holy relygyon. And Hircanu^ her sone she provoked to the
bysshopryche / and she ordained that he should regne after. This woman in ye
line of the bishops is put fro the cou^tynge of ye years. Not as she used the
office of a bishop for it was not leyfull to her. Hircanus sone to Alexandra
reigned.xxxiii year. This Hircanus after the decesse of his mother succeeded in
the kingdom / in ye which he had little prosperyte for percyalte of the people.
For anon he was over comen / and after ward he was restored through the help
of the Arabees. And then he was made trybutary to the Romans. And so (...)
was in peace a little time. But not in ye name of king. At the last he did
wretchedly for he was begyled through the fraud Parthorum the which Antigonus
hired against him (vide plene magistru^ history) The heresye of ye Pharysees
about this time began. And among them were three sects in the Jury. Pharacey.
Saducey. and Essey. All these were divided from the common use of the Jews /
and were enfe^^e with mani errors for they said that they were holyer than
other men. For they lived streytlyer than other men did (Vide plus alias)
Virgyll the most excellent of Potes was magnefyed this time / and meruaylous
things he did. And among other when that Neopolis was vexed with deedly pain
of mighty worms. Virgyll cast a worm of gold in to a pound or a water /
and it lay a certain season there. And when it was take up in to the town /
all the cite was made full of worms. And till the worm of gold was put in to
the water again / they had In fyte worms. And when it was in the water all
the worms went a way. Also it is wreten in the chronicles of Rome / that
Virgyll by conning condesce^ded or thycked the air / so that he walled his
gardyne with the air. And he made a bridge of the air / by the which he
might pass every time that he list Also he asked Morcellu^ Neopolitanu^ /
neuewe unto the Emperor / if he would have a bird taught to kylle all birds
or a fly taught to drive all flies out of the cite. And this Marcellu^ told
this to the Emperor. And he desired to teache a fly to kylle all flies. For
the common people were sore anoyed with ^^yes. And many other maruales he did
(vide magistru^ Rodulfu^ Cesteru^) Oracius Flaccus / and Salustius Crispus
historicus were at this time. Quintus Cipio. Gaius Lucis this time were
Consules at Rome. Pompeius. Marcus Crassus and Julius Cezar this time were
Dictatours at Rome. For as it is said / before there were many dygnytees at Rome
/ of the which some dured one year / some two year. And among all the
dygnytees the Dictatours exceded / for it dured five year. But when the common
people and the lord shypes of Rome encreasynge were made three Dictatours. And
this time was pompeius. Julius and Marcus Crassus Dictatours. And by cause
Pompeius was of great honor and aeged / he bode at Rome to keep the common
people of Rome. Marcus Crassus was send to subdue and fight with the regyon of
Perthus. And through treason he was taken and slain Julius Cezar was send to
the weste part of the world to subdue them. And he has with him seven
legyons of people. And when that he had subdued Lomberdye and France his
five year were spended / the which were assygned to him and no longer. There
by his own auctoryte he took other five year upon him / in the which he
subdued Cassybolon king of Brytayne / and the Frenshme^ that rebelled against
him This same Julius after he had conquered the countrees / unto Rome he roode
again / for to be receued with certain worship as conquerours were before him
but it was denied him / and also the entree of the Cytee / by the Instygacyon
of a lord called Pompei. wherefore this Julius Cezar was annoyed / and with
force of might entered the Cite / and robbed the common treasoure and ladde it
with him / and departed it among the seven legyons that were his servants.
Then went he in to Spain to fight against this Pompei. For Pompei had
the governance of Cartago. But after that Iourneye in ytale Pompei and he
encountered together. In the which bataylle Pompei fled unto the king of
Egypt / and that same king for special love that he had unto this Julius
Cezar smote or Pompeus heed and sent it to Julius Cezar. yet for all the
enuyte that was betwixt them two Julius wept when that he saw this Pompeius
heed^ This Julius was exceeding in wit before other men / and he faught in
bataylle.lii. times. This man alone exceded Marcus Crassus: the which is said
to have foughten.xxxix. times. This man took first the Empire of Rome upon
him: when Pompei and other noble men of the Romans were slain. And at the
last the fyfthe year of his Empire: This Julius Cezar the ruler of all this
world was slain in the counsel house thrughe treason of his lords. Cathon
the most named philosopher: Seeing Julius Cezar have the victory: whom he
favored not: at a town called Vticam did slay him self (iuxta illud Mauult
cota mari: quam deroget vrbis honorari) But for that after Austyn he was not
excused of senne.

This time the Jury was trybutarye to the Romans for percyalyte of two
brethern Aristobolus and Ercanus both of them for envy of other cast them to
the Romans that they might regne. This time three sons appeared in heaven to
ward the eest part of the world: the which by little and lytelle were
broghte in to one body. A great sign it was that Africa. Asia: and Europa
should be brought i^ to one monarche and that ye lordshyp of Anthony the
Senatoure and Lucius Anthonii should turn in to one lordshyp. Marcus Cicerio
Tullius the most noble Rethorycen was Counsel of Rume this time.

How that the Brytons granted unto Cassybolon which then to fore that was
Luddes brother the land. In whoos time Julius Cezar came twyes for to conquer
the land of Brytayne.
AFter the death of king Lud reigned his brother Cassybolon and became a good
man and much beloved of his bryto^s so that for his goods and corteysy they
granted him the reame for ever more to him and to his heirs. and the king of
his goodness let nourysshe worthily both the sons that were Lud his brother.
And after made the eldest sone earl of Cornewayle / and the yngest sone he made
earl of London. And while this king Cassybolon reigned / came Julius Cezar that
was Emperor of Rome in to the land with a power of Romans / and would have
had this land thrughe strength / but Cassybolon over came him in battle
through help of the Brytons / and drove him out of this land. And he went
again to Rome and assembled a great power an other time / and came again in to
this land for to give battle to Cassybolon / but he was dyscomfyted through
strength of ye Brytons / and through help of the Earl of Cornewayle and the
Earl of London his brother / and through help of Gudian king of Scotlonde / and
Corbonde the king of Northwalys / and of Brytayl king of Southwalys. And in
this bataylle was slain Nennon that was Cassybolons brother / wherefore he made
much sorrow / And so went Julius Cezar out of this land with a few of
Romans that were left a live. And then Cassybolon went again to London and
made a feast to all folk that tho him had helped. And wha^ that this feast was
done / Then every man yede in to his own country.

Of the debate that was betwixt Cassybolon and the Earl of London / and of the
truage that was paid to Rome.
ANd after it befelle thus upon a day / that the gentylmen of the kings
household and the gentylmen of the Earls household of London after meet went
togyd for to play And thorugh debate that arose among them Enelin that was
the Earls cosyn of London slew Ire^glas that was ye kings cosyn. wherefore
swore that Enelyn should be hanged. But the Earl of London that was Enelins
lord would not suffer him / wherefore the king was gretely wroth and vexed
toward the Earl / and thought him destroy. And preuely the Earl sent letters
to Julius Cezar that he should come in to this land for to help him and him
avenge upon the king / and he would help him with all his might. And when
the emperor herd this tidings he was full glade / and ordained a strong power
/ and came again the third time in to this land / and the Earl of London
helped him with.viii. thousand men / and at the third time was Cassibolon
overcome and dyscomfyted and made peace to the Emperor for three thousand
pound of silver yeldi^ge by year for trauge for this land for evermore. And
then half a year after passed the Emperor Julius Cezar went again unto Rome
/ and the Earl of London which him. For he durst not abide in this land. And
after Cassybolon reigned.vii. year in peace / and tho he deyed the.xvii. year of
his regne and lies at york.

How that the lords of the land after the death of Cassybolon and for by cause
he had none heyer made Adragen king.
AFter the death of Cassybolon for as much as he had none heir of his (...)
body begote^ / the lords of land by ye comyns assente crowned Andragen earl
of Cornewayle and made him king. And he reigned well and worthily / and he was a
good man and will governed the land. And when he had reigned. v^ii. year then
he deyed / and lies at London

Circa annu^ mundi.v.M.C.lix. Et ante xp^i natiuitatem.i^.
Joseph of the line of Christ was about this time borne / and after was
husbonde unto our lady. Anthigonus was bishop this time in the Jury. This
Anthigonus was sone unto Aristoboly / and on every side he was false. For he
obeyed not to the Romans / and a great plage he brought unto the lord for to
destroy Hircanus his uncle that he might regne king / and so Hircanus was
expulsed / and Flaccus was slain / and Herod was exiled. But when Herod came
unto Rome and told the Senators all these thyngys / the Emperor cerated him
king sendynge with him an host / the which took Jerusalem. And Anthigonum
the bishop taken / led to Anthony the Senatoure / the which made him seker
/ and so was Herod confermed in to his kingdom. And he a stranger reigned on
the Jews / and so the kingdom of the Jews cessed as Jacob had said. Titus
Liuius historicus and Quidius were this time.

Incipiu^t imperatores augusti. et dictus est augustus quia augebat populum
OCtauian was Emperor of Rome.lvii. year.vi. mouths and.^. days. This
Octauyan neuewe to July wha^ he was a young man took the Empire upon him. His
flourysshynge youth he spended in war. Five thousand bataylles he did. And
shortly after many bataylles / he brought all the world in to one Monarche /
that man had no fellow And in his days peace was in all the world thrught the
prouysyon of the very god. That the temporal peace might glorifye the natyuyte
of our savior Christ Ihesu. This Octauyan was the fairest man that might be /
and high in wit / the most fortunate in all things. And he lacked not the
vice of his flesshely lust. This man made all the world to be mesured. And
in the.lii. year of his regne was our lord Ihesu Christ borne / the Sauyoure
of this world / the which grants eternal peace to his lovers. Hic nota
secundum Ieronimum) that Anna and Emeria were systers. And of Emeria was borne
Elyzabeth mother to Johan the Baptyste. And she was first wedded to Ioachim of
whom she took Mary mother of Christ. The second husbonde was Cleophe / and he
gate oon her Maria Cleophe / the which was wedded to Alphe of whom proceeded
James the less Simon Cananeus. Judas Tadeus / and Joseph the which is called
Barsabas / The third time Anna was wedded to Salome / of whom she took Mary
Salome the which was wedded to zebede and of them came James ye more / and
Johan the euangelyst The first Mary wedded Joseph brother to Cleophe before
said. This time Sibilla Tiburrina prophesied of Christ / and said to
themperoure August / that he should not trow that he was not god after the
folysshenes of the paynyms And there she showed him a fair virgyne in heaven
holdinde a child in her arms / and said to him / this child is greter than
thou / and therefore do him worship. The monarche of Rome about this time
myghtly encresed. And when it was so that by all the world in diverse prouynces
bataylles were raised suddenly all men merualynge / they were sessed and put
them holy to the prince of Rome that openly it might be showed that such an
universal peace came never by labor of bataylle / but of ye powere of the
very god / that in his natyuyte peace should regne in all the world. Herod
Ascolonira was king in the Jury.xxxv. year This Herod ydumeus was ye first
strange king that reigned on the Jews. The master in historiis says / he
was a noble man and faithful in the beginning / and in all thing he had him
nobly. He wys very ge^tyll unto the Romans and to the people that loved peas^
And in his old aege / when he would much please the Romans herd of the
birth of Christ: dredynge to be expulsed of his kingdom as a stranger:
wretchedly he fell and slew the Innocents and dyuer of his own children.
And at ye last was hateful to all people: and fell syke and deyed wretchedly.
Mary the mother of Christ was borne before the Natyuyte of christ.xv. year or
there about.

Of Kymbulyn that was Andragens sone reigned after his fader
AFter the death of Andrage^ reigned Kymbalyn his sone a good man and well
governed the land in much prosperyte and peace all his life time. And in his
time Ihesu Criste was borne of that sweet virgyne Mary. This king Kymbalyn had
two sons. Gynder and Armager good knights and worthy. And when this Kymbalyn
had reigned.xxii. year: he deyed and lies at London.

THat day our lord Ihesu Christ was borne / a well of oil beyond Tybre by
Rome spra^ge and ran all day. The goldy^ yamge fell yt which Romulus had
made: and put it in his palace saying. This image shall not fail vnre a maid
bear a child. when Herod disposid him to slay the chyldern of Israel: he was
commanded by the letter of the emperor to come to Rome to Answer to the
accusacyon of his chyldern Alexium. and Aristoboli: And there were three Herodes
grely spoken of for there ill deeds The first was called Ascolonita / and under
this man was borne christ / and the children of Israel were slain. The
second was called Antipas sone to ye first Herod / under whom John^ Baptyst
heeded / and christ suffered death. And the third was called Agrippa sone to
Aristoboli / sone to the first Herod / the which slew James and prysoned
Peter. The first Herod when he saw his sons Alexiu^ and Aristoboli through
the pretens of his letter by the Emperor send / strive for the succession of
his kingdom / he disposid and made Antipater that was his first begoten sone
to be before them: and when they were talking of the death of their fader he
cast them away: and they went to the emperor to complain of ye wrong of
therfader. And in the mean time the three kings of Coleyne came by Herod unto
Jerusalem: and when they came not again by him he thought that they were ashamed
for to come again by him for because that they were disceyued: and that they
found not the child as he denied: therefore in the mean season he cessed to
slay the chyldern of Israel and so wene unto Rome for the cytacion of
themperoure. And he took his way by the cite of Tarsum where he burnt the
ships in the which the three kings of Coleyne should have saylled in to there
own country. Then after a year and certain days: this Herod came from
Rome again: accorded with his sons And for the co^fyrmaco^n of his kingdom he
was made much holder: and then he slew all the chyldern of Bethleem that were
of two year of aege and under that had space of one night of aege: and among
these was there one of his own chylrden. And Aristoboli and Aleriu^ werre had
in suspeccion: in so much as they promised a harbor a great reward that he
should take and kitte there faders throat wha^ that he did him shave. and when
this Herod herd this he was grieved and there he slew both his sons. And
Herod Agrippa his sone he ordained to be kige. wherefore Antipater his oldest
sone was about to poison his foder: the which Herod Agrippa understood: and
prysoned there his brother that which the Emperor herd and said that he had
leuee be an hog of Herodes: than for to be one of his sons: for his hogs
he spares and his sons he sleeth. And when that Herod was.lxx. year of age
he was stryken with a great sykenesse in his hondes and in his feet and in his
members: that no lethe might come to him for stenche: and so he deyed. So
Antipater his sone in prison herd tell of this and Ioyed gretely: and
therefore that cause he was slain. Then strove Archelaus and Herodes for the
succession of the first Herod. The Emperor there through counsel of the
Senators: the half of the Jury and Idumea gaaf to Archelaus under name of
Tetrarche. And the other part he divided in two. Galylee he gaaf to Herod
Antippa. And Ituriam and Traconidem he gaafe to Philype Herodes brother. And
that same year Christ came from Egypt / And Archelaus was accused many times
of the Jews / and was exiled in to Vyennam in to france. And in that place
were set four Tetrarchees / to the repreuynge of the vnstablynesse of the
Jews. And that same year Octauyan ye Emperor deyed.

all. things at.xxx. year of aege and.iii. months deyed far his servants
Anninus Rufus was bishop in the Jury about this time. Valerius Geaceus was
after him.xi. year. This man openly sold the bysshopryche / and he that most
yaaf had it. And there was money in alytell while. Poncius Pylatus was Judge
and Proctour in the Jury under ye Emperor. And under this man John^ Baptyst
began for to preche. And our lode surffred death / the which was dampened to
death unright wysly for dread of the emperor. Tyrus a certain king gate a child
on Pyla a poor man's daughter / the which man hight Arus / and this child
of his moders name and his be^syre put togyds was called Pylatus / This Pylatus
ye fourth year of his aege was sent to his fader. The which king of his
lefull wife had gotten a child even of the aege with Pylate / and by cause this
lefull gote^ child as they proceeded in aege exceded this bastard Pylatus he
was full of envy and slew his brother the lefull gotten child. wherefore forth
with his fader se^te him to Rome for pledge for his trybute that he paid to
Rome / entendynge he would never redeem him. In the which time the kings sone
of France was pledge for his trybute / ye which exceded him in strength and
chyualry also he slew him. Therefore the Romans sent Pylate as a profitable
man for ye common well to the isle of Ponto to tame the cursyd people / the
which slew eueri Judge that came to them And he that cursid man governed that
vnhapy people what with thretynge and with promise / and with law and with
ieftes that no^e of them durst contrai do to his pleasure / wherefore he was
called Pylate of Ponto. Herodes Antipa young in his conuersacyons / with
yeftes^ and messages drew him to him and made him prince of the Jury under
him. And this time Pylate gadred much money / and Herod not knowing he
went to Rome that he might receive of the Emperor that Herod had given him.
Wherefore Hyrode and Pylate were enmyes together / unto ye passion of our lord /
when that pylate send Ihesus unto Herod clothed in a white clothe / then^e
they were made friends. Ouidius Naso in ponto above this time deyed the fourth
year of his exile. Tyburius this time was Emperor at Rome / and he reigned
xxiii. year / and he lived i^ the year that our lord Ihesu Christ deyed and
somewhat after. This man was in all his works greteli auysed that there should
be nothing suddenly done wise i^ wars studyous i^ books fair of speech fresshe
in wit / save he would of times feyne himself to do things that he would never
do of other. This Emperor understood and trusted in christ / and worshyped him
for god Some men say at the last he was cruel ayenste people but it was a
great reason of pity that he was ever gracious to his subgettes and poor men.
And he had peace all his days / and all the people that said against cryste^
folk with out oni mercy he destroyed: and he exyled pylate for ever Then he
decessed and a worse succeeded him. After Euseby it is written: our lord at.xxx.
year of his aege chose his.xii. apostles: the which made our Creed: that is
believe. and they made it after the Resurreccyon of christ: and after ye holy
ghost was send unto the^. when they had chose Mathia the apostle and each of
the^ made a part as it is showed hereafter. And this mathia was chose between
ye doye of the Ascencyon and wytsondaye in the place of Judas Scaryot the
traytoust / of ye which Judas in a history is read thus. There was a certain
man in Ieruslem that high Ruben / and after saint Ierom he was of ye trybe of
isacar. And his wife hight Cyborea the which one a certain night when he would
lustely know his wife / she dremed that she should bear a child of myschef and
ye child should be a traitor to his king and to al ye people of that regio^ and
wha^ that child was borne and called Judas his fader and his mod abhorred as
well to slay there child / as to nourysshe a traitor to the king and all his
people / there fore they put him in to a panyer / or a lepe in to the sea / and
he flowed to the isle of Scaryoth / where the ladi of that place had no child
by her husbonde and she feyned her to be with child / but she failed And after
i^ a little season ye same laid and queen conceived a chil of her husbonde and
when that he was of aege. Judas many times angerd him and caused him to weep /
the which the queen saw / and beat Judas many times / and after she knowleged
that judas was not ye kings snoe hers / wherefore Judas slew the kenges sone /
and he dradde the pain of ye law / and fled with certain exiles to
Jerusalem. And wha^ he came there: he gate hi^ in to Pylates court that was
Judge and by cause that o cursed man draws to a^ other: therefore he drew to
pylate and stood greatly in his favor. And upon a certain day wha^ Pylate looked
out of his palace in to an orcharde of a that man's was called rube^ that was
very fader to Judas. Pylate desired to have apples: and Judas went to gadre
apples: and Ruben ran to Judas for to let him because he took hes apples
whithaut any leave and wha^ they had chyd this Judas smote his fad on ye heed
with a stone and slew him: and Judas fled a way secretly aft that deed but it
was said that rube^ died suddenly. Then pylate gaf to Judas all ye goods that
Rube^ had and ciborea Rube^s wife that was mother to Judas. and he dealed not
curcesly with her as a ma^shold with hes wif and for that she wept and wailed
for she had put her so^e to ye see and that she was married against her well It
was perceived that Judas had slai^ hes owe fad and wedde hes own mod. Then^e
ciborea his mod and wife meuyd him to leave his sin / and then he followed
Christ: and he forgave him his syn^e and made him his procoure and apostle. And
howfals he was to Christ / it needs not to reherce. And ye same year Mathewe
was chose^ / and ye holy ghost was send in to them as it is said before. The
appostles or they were sparpied in to all ye world they gadred them cogyd in
to Jerusalem and made the Creed here folowinge that is our bileue.

power in heaven and in earth is given unto me. And goo ye thus in to all the
wrold and preche and teache unto every creature / and Ish all be with you unto
the end of the world. Here he chyse him.lxxii. discyples. and he had.xii.
apostles ye which he send in to all the world to preche. Ne it is not read
that there were more ordres among the discyples of Christ / of whom the
prestes and bishops in the church of god yet keep the form. For to the
appostles the bishops succeed / and to the dyscyple priests. To the which
two ordres / all the church is given as a goodly Ierarche (Vt patet in Decreto

Here begins the order of Popes of Rome / and contynneth as the line of
Christ did before. For in them god left his power. Anno domini.xxxiiii.
PEter a Jew the first pope was a blessed man and a glorious apostle of
Christ. He was heed of ye church.xxxvii. year. And he held his bysshopryche in
the eest.v. year and said mass he made our lord / and alone said the Pater
noster. Then after he came to Antiochiam and there he abode.vii. year
techynge the way of troth. And Simon Magus he confounded away. That season he
preched to the people that were circu^cysed / the which were in Ponto of
Galati. Capadocia. Asia. Bichinia. Then herd he that Simon Magus deluded the
Romans / through the love of the faith / he came to Rome in the fourth year of
Claudius ye Emperor. And there he preched the word of god / and showed the
falshede of Simon Magus and turned many a man to the faith / Then he send
his precher by diverse prouynces / by whom christian relygyon was myghtely
increased. He ordained the feast of Lenton before Eester / and Aduent and the
Emerynge days to be fasted of all cryste^ people / in to the myrrour of the
first and second coming of our lord Ihesu. Then^e when he had be pope at
Rome.xxv. year.vii. months and ^viii. days / He was slain of Nero (Eius pla
opera vide actibus aplorum) Baius this time was Emperor at Rome and
reigned.iii. year and.x. months. This Gaius was first vicyous in living / for
two of his own sesters he mysused / and on one of them he ga^e a daughter /
which child he set betwext the knees of Iupyter in the Temple / and feyned
after ward that Iupyter had gotten her. wherefore he did cry through the
country that all men should worship her as a goddess / This man also made
an image like himself and sent it to one Patronie Presydent at Jerusalem under
the Romans commaundynge him that he should compel the Jews to do worship
thereto. And fore these enormities and many other / our lord suffered him to be
slain at Rome in his own Palace.

Of king Gynder that was Kymbalyns sone / that would not pay the truage to
Rome for the land that Cassybolon had granted / and how he was slain of a
Romyne.
ANd after the death of this Kymbalyn reigned Gynder his sone a good man and a
worthy / and was of so high heart that he would not pay to Rome that trybute
that king Cassybolon had granted unto Julius Cezar wherefore the emperor that
was tho that was called Claudius Cezar was sore anoyed And ordained a great
power of Romans / and came in to this land for to conquer the tribute through
strength / and for to have it on the kynge^ But this king Gynder and Armager
his brother assembled and gadred a great host togyd of Brytons and yaue battle
to the Emperor Claudius / and slew of the Romans gerte plente. The Emperor
had after ward one that was called Hamon that saw the people there fast
slain / and pryuely cast a way his owe arms and took the arms of a deed
Bryton and armed him with his armor / and came in to the bataylle to the king
and said in this manner. Sir be of a good heart for gods love for the Romans
that been your enmyes anon shall be slain and dyscomfyted euerychone. And the
king gaf no keep to his words / ne to his speech forbi cause of the arms
that he hae upon him / and demyd that he had been a Bryton. But the traitor
ever held him next the king And pryuely under ye sholder of his arms he
smote the king / wherefore the king deyed and fell down to the earth when
Armager saw his brother so deed herast away his arasmes and took to him his
brothers arms / and come in to the batayl among the brytons and badde them
hertly for to fight / and fast lay a down the Romans. And for the arms they
wend it had be king Gynder that before was slain / yt they wist not. Then
began ye Brytons fyersly for to fygth / and slew ye Romans So at the last the
Emperor forsook the field and fled as fast as they might with his folkein to
wynchestre. And the false traitor Hamon that had slain the king / fast anon
began for to flee with all ye have that he might And Amager ye kings brother
pursued him full fyersly with a fyers heart / and drove him unto a water and
there he took him. And ano^e smote of both hand and feet and heed / and hewed
ye body all to peers / and then let cast him in to the water wherefore that
wat was called Hamons haven. And after there was made a fair town that yet
stondeth that is called Southampten. And after Armager went to wynchestre for
to seek Claudius Cezar the Emperor of Rome. And there Armager him took. And
Claudius the emperor thorugh counseyl of the Romans that were with him left a
live / made peace with Armager i^ this manner as ye shall here. That is to say.
How that Claudius the Emperor should give unto Armager Gennen his fair
daughter for to have unto his wife. So that this land from that time for ward
should he in the Emperors power of Rome upon such covenant / that never
after ward no Emperor of Rome should take none other trybute of this land /
but only feaute And they were accorded. And upon this covenant Claudius Cezar
sent to Rome for his daughter Gennen. And as she was come Claudius Cezar yaf
her unto Armager to wife. and Armager spowsed her at London with much
solempnyte and mirth. And then was Armager crowned and made king of Brytayne.

Of king Armager in whose time. saint Peter preched i^ Anthyoche with other
apostles in diverse countries.
THis Armager reigned well and worthily / and gourned the land right
worshypfully. And Claudius Cezar in remembrance of this accord / and for
reverence and honor of his daughter made in this land fair town and a
castle / and let call the town after his name Clauestren / ye which now is
called Gloucestre* and then^e wha^ all this was done the Emperor took his leave
and then^e went to Rome again. And Armager then was king / and governed the
land well and worthily all his lives time. And this Armager gate a seen on his
wife which was called westmer. And while that this Armager reigned saint Peter
preched in Anthioche And there he made a noble church. In the which he satte
first in his chair And there he dewelled.vii. year. and after he went to
Rome: and was made pope: tylle that Nero ye Emperor let martyr him And then
preched openly all the apostles in diverse lands the right faith. And when
Armager had reigned.xxxiiii. year: he dyed and lies at the auncyente cite of
London.

How king westmer gaaf to Berynger an ylonde forlet. And there this Berynger
made the town of Berwyke.
ANd after this Armager reigned his sone westmer: that was a good man and a
worthy of body: and well governed the land. It befell so that tidings came to
him upon a day: that the king Roderyk of Gascoyne was come in to this land
with an hughe host of people: and was dwelling in Scanys more. and wha^ king
westmer herd those tidings he let assemble an huge host of Brytons / and
came to the king Roderyk and yaue him battle. And king westmer slew king
Rodoryke with his own hondes in plain baytaylle. And when king Roderyks men
saw that there lord was slain / they yielded them all to king westmer / and
became his men for ever more. And he gaf them a country that was forlete^
wherein they might dwelled. And thither they went And dwell there all their
lives time / and.ix. hundred men there were of them and nomoo left at that
batayll^ Their governor and prince was called Berynger. And anon he began a
town that they might there in dwell and have resort and let call the town
Berwyk upon Twede. And there they enhabyte and becam rich. But they had no
wymmen among them / and the Brytons would not give there daughters to the
strangers. wherefore they went over see in to Irlonde / and brought with them
wymmen and there they them spo^wsed. But the men could not understood their
langage ne the speech of these wymmen / and therefore they spoke together as
Scotts. And after ward through chaunginge there langage in all France they were
called then^e Scotts and so should the folk of that country be called for
ever more.

How king westmer let arere a stone in the entering of westmerlo^de / there
that he slew Roderyk / and there he began first housynge.
ANd after this batayl that is above said when Roderyke was deed / king
westmer in remembrance of his victory let arere there beside the way a great
stone on high / and yet it stondeth and ever more shall stand. And he let
grave i^ ye stone let that thus said The king westmer of Brytayne slew in
this place Roderyk his enymye. And this westmer was the first that builded house
and town i^ westmerlo^de and at that stone begins westmerlo^de that westmer
let call after his own name. And when westmer had so done he dwelled all
his life time in that country of westmerlonde / for he loved that country more
than any other country / and when he had reigned.xxv. year / he deyed and lies
at Karleyll.

Of king Coill that was westmers sone that held his land in peace al his
lives time.
AFter this: his sone king Coill reigned a good man and a worthy: and of good
condycyons: and well governed his land. And of all men he had love and peace.
And in his time was never contake debate: nor war in Brytayne. And he reigned
and was king in peace all his lives tyme^ And wha^ he had reigned.xi. year he
deyed and lies at york.

Claudius was Emperor at Rome next after Gaius. And he reigned.xiiii. year /
and.viiii. days. This man came in to great Brytayne now called England / for
to challenge the trybute which they did deny unto the Romans. And after
great bataylles there was between the Emperor Claudius and Armager king of
Brytayne. And after accordement made / that this armager should wedde Claudius
daughter / and after they two should ever live in peace. In token werof / this
Claudius named the cite where they were wedded after him / and called it
Claudicestre / where we now it call Gloucestre. This Claudius had three wives.
And on Petiua the first wife he gate a daughter that hight Antonia / the first
wife decessed / and he wedded Messalinam / and gate a sone that hight Brytanicus
and Octauia a daughter. The third he wedded Agrippina having a sone that hight
Nero. Claudius wedded his daughter Octauia to Nero his wives sone. This
Claudius for love that he had to Agrippina his last wife / he slew Messalina
his first wife / leest she should have help Britanicus her sone and his to
Empire. yet Agrippina the last wife of Claudius dradde / leest her husbonde
would have proferred Brytanicus and h^^e deposed Nero her sone / therefore she
poisoned her husbonde Claudius / and Nero was promoted to the Empire. And this
same Nero ayue his mother such a reward again. For he poisoned Brytanicus and
slew his own mother and his wife Octauia. James ye more the apostle this time
was slain of Herod Agrippa / and Peter was prysoned (Vt pz act.xii. The body
of saint James was brought by miracle in Galeciam of Spyne.

Nero after Claudius was Emperor / and he reigned.xiii. year and.vii. months.
This Nero was a cursyd man / and made grethe waste in the Empire. He would not
fysshe but with nets of gold and ropes of sylke. A great part of ye lords
of Rome he slew He was enemy to no men but to good men. He slew his brother
and his wife his mother and his master. He slew also Peter and Poule / he would
never were one cloth two times. All his horse and his mules were shood with
silver / and at the last he did set a great part of Rome on fire / some
say the Romans complained the streets were to narowe. And as he had burnt a
great part of Rome. Nero said there is space to build the streets wyder.
Then the Senators with the common people came upon him to sleehim and he
fled by night in to the subarbes of ye cytee and hyde him / and he herd
karles and beggars saying. And they wist where the Empe^rour were he should
never escape them. Nero thought it should be great derogacyon to his name and
he were slain of karles. And on a great stake he ran him self to the heart
and deyed and there was buried. And deuylles kept his body many a day after /
and did great hurt to the people / till by a miracle of our lord the body was
found and taken away / and then ye deuylles voyded. Seneca was this time
master to Nero. Iuuenales pota. Lucanus poeta. James the less the appostle
bishop of Jerusalem was slain of the Jews ye.vi. year of Nero. Marcus the
euaungelyste was martred the first year of him.

Circa annu^ xp^i.lxxiiii.
LInus ytalicus was pope of Rome.x. year and.iii^ months and.xiii. days This
Linus and his successor Cletus / through their holy conuersacyon were made to
mynystre the tresoure of the church to the people Peter being a live. And
Peter attended to prayenge and prechynge. It is read of this Cletus / that he
wrote first in his letters (Salutem et apostolica^ benedictionem) Before this
time was many a dyscyple of Peter slain under Nero. Galba this time was
Emperor / and he reigned.vii. months. This man was made Emperor by the power
of Spain in the same land Nero living. And after the death of Nero brught to
Rome / and there was slain of a man that came with whete to Rome. He smote of
his heed and bare it to him that was Emperor next / seeing all his men and
none of them helping him. In this man's days came ye great Rethoricyen to
Rome fro Spain / and was the first that ever taught the science openly / his
nyme was Quintilian. Otho reigned after him / and he reigned but.iii. months.
For one Vitellus that was President of France challenged ye Empire. And in
ytalye betwixt these two were three great bataylles And in the fourth battle
Otho saw he should be overcome and in great dispeyre he slew himself.
Vitellus reigned after Otho and he reigned.viii. months / for he was follower of
Nero most special in glotony / and in singing of foul songs: and at festes
etynges out of mesure that he might not keep it. Vespasianus reigned next
after him.ix. year and.x. months and.xii. days. The well governed men of
Rome seeing the cursyd succession of Nero sent after this Vespasian unto
palestyn For there he was and his sone Titus which had besyeged Iherusalem.
And wha^ be herd that Nero was deed: by whom he was sent to Jerusalem: and
herd of these cursyd men regnynge. At the Instaunce of these men: not
wyllyngly: took upon him the Empire. And anon as he was come to Rome: he
overcame the tyraunte Vitellus and let him be draw thorugh Rome: and after in
to tybre till he was deed: and then^e let him sail without sepulture for this
ye people desired. This man was cured of waspis in his nose anon as he byleued
in our lord Ihesu: And yt was the cause which went to Jerusalem / to venge
Crystis death He fought.x^xii. times with his enemies and deyed the year of
grace.lxiix.

Anno diu^ lxxxiiii.
CLetus a martyr was pope.xi. year this Cletus was a Romayn and gretely beloved
pylgrymages to saints saying it was more profit to the health of man's
soul to visyte the place yt saint peter was in than ^or to fast two year. He
cursyd all tho men lettynge such pylgrymages / or counselors contrary
thereto. At the last he was martryd by Dami^^an the Emperor. Titus sone to
Vespasianus was Emperor this time and reigned three year. And he abode stylle at
Jerusalem after the eleccyon of his fader and destroyed the cytee. And slew
there as the storye says with battle and hungre.xi. hodred thousand Jews
And a hundred thousa^de he took and sold.xxx. for a penny. By cause they sold
Christ for.xxx. pens / and brought thens all thing that was precious / and put
them in his house at Rome which was called Te^plu^ pacis / But now is that
place fall down for ye most party / and all these great Iewelles ben
dystrybuted to certain chirches in Rome. This Titus was so full of virtue that
all men loved him / so set forth / that they called him the most delectable of
men. He was full lyberall to all me^ in so much that he said often times / ye
there should no man goo from an Emperor with an heavy heart / but he should some
what have of his petycyon. He would be sorry that day in the which he had
granted no man no benefyte. when that he was deed every man yt was in Rome
wept for him / as that they had lost their fader. Domician brother to Titus
reigned after him.xxiiii. year and.v. months. First he was ^asy / and after
ward full unreasonable For much of ye Senate was destroyed by his malice / and
also much of his kynred. He began the second persecuco^n after Nero against
christian men / in the which persecucion John^ the euangelyst was exiled in to
Pathius after the Emperor had put him in to a tonne of oil bre^nynge and
hurt him not. So this man was not the follower of his fader Vespasian / ne his
brother Titus / but rathur like Nero and his kyn read. And for these wicked
condicyo^s he was slain in his own palace at Rome in the.xxvii. year of his
aege^ Clemens a martyr was pope.ix. year and he succeeded Cletus. This Clemens
first of saint Peter was ordained to be successor to him. And for peril he
would Linus and Cletus should be popes and fore him / lest that through that
ensample prelates should ordeyne under the^ who some ever they would. This man
made ye life of martyrs to be written by regyons. And he made many books He
ordained that a child should be confermed as soon as it might / namely after
it was crystened. And at ye last he was martred under Traian. Nerua was
Emperor after Domician oo year and two months. And when he was chosen he
meued the Senate to make a law / that thing which Domician commanded to be
kept should be broken / By the which mean saint Johan the eua^gelyst was
losed out of his exyl: and suffrey to come again to Ephase. This man did an
other thing right comendable that he assigned so wise a man as Traian was to
govern the people after him. Nota. Traianus Hispanicus was Emperor.xxi. year.
This Traianus many man said. He was the best among all the Emperors: But in
one thing alone he was vicious In so much as he for the love of the false
gods was about to destroy ye christian faith. Iugyng in himself so most to
please god. Some men say not by himself but by other he pursewed the christian
faith: and in ye end of his life he did but few to death. And all his loving
Isette at naught. But at saint Gregory meued with pity weeping: and prayed unto
our lord for him: that he would have mercy upon him and by his prayer have him
out of hell: in to which place he was dampened. And now if that he be saud or
not: a great alteracyon is among doctors. And to us yt write Crony eles: it
is no part of our charge to determyn. But all the eest part of ye world.
Babylon. Selencia: the utter parts of the ynde. Germayne the second after
Alexander held under. In all these things so pyteous and so mekely he guyded
him to every man as a king. He was gentle: and to no man vnge^tyll: the
which is read of few: All his days he lived that men said he was the most
worthy man in all his Empire. And thought and said ever more: that no man was
more unworthy to be Emperor than he.

Anno dm^.C.iiii.
ANacletus a martyr was pope ^ix year And he. was a Greek. He monysshed an
cryste^ men: that priests should be worshypped above all other men. Saying:
that priests doing sacrifyce to god should be borne out and not vexed: but be
worshypped. And priests when they said mass the should have wyenesse with them
and namely bishops Also he decreed that clerks should were no berdes nor long
here. Also that a bishop should be consecrated of three: and diverse other
thing. At the last the.xii. year of Traianus he was martred and buried by the
body of saint Peter. Plinius the second Orator and phelosopher wrote much
things. This man meued Traianus that he should wythdrawe the sentence yeuen
ayeste christian folk: written to him that they should do no ylle but take heed
to the virtue: But that they should rise before day and worshoppe there god
secretly in the nyght^ Euaristus a Greek and a martyr was pope.x. year and.vii.
months after Anacletus. This man ordained that man and woman should be wedded
openly: and that they should be blessed openly of the priest and fader and
mother. And he was martred ye third year of Adrian and buried by saint Peter.
Alexander a Romayn was pope.viii. year and.v. months. This Alexander the
most part of the Senators he conuerterd unto our lord And he constytuted
and ordained / that holy water should be spynkled in to christian me^nes houses.
And he ordained that the bread that prestes use to sing with should be made of
pure and clean bread and that in a little quantyte. At the last he was martred
under Adryan that was the Emperor. And many of them he converted to the faith.
Sixtus a Romayn was pope.x. year and.iii. months. This man ordained (Sanctus
Sanctus Sanctus. etc^) Should be said in the mass. And that the holy things
of the church should not be touched but of mynysters of ye church. Also that
the corporax should not be made of sylke / but of pure lynnen clothe wouen /
and not dyed and that a woman should not touch the holy / vessel of the a
wter / ne the palle. Also he ordained / that yfony bishop were vacant / that
no bishop should be received in to his benefyce but with the popes letters.
Also that no mass should be said but upon an a wter / and at the last he was
martred. Adrianus was emperor.xxi. year This Adriani many things is co^me^
deed to christian men / other will he was gracious / and certain of them that
would not do sacryfyce to the false gods he slew. He was an universal man
all most in all science. Peace he had all his days / but with the Jews and
many a law he made. And then he commanded that christian men should not be
dampened to death but with due process. Jerusalem he subduded again / and
forbadde that no Jew should dwell therein by no wise. Criste^ me^ he suffered
there to dwell. Against his will he came to the Empire / But he governed him
very well. wha^ ye senators prayed him to call his sone Emperor after him /
He said / it is not ynoughte to me that against my will I have reigned which I
have not deserved. For ye emperourus of Rome should go by succession of blood /
but to such men as have deserved it through their merytes. Many times he reigned
vnuertuously that is a king borne / and virtue should come before his kingdom.
Eustachius other wise called Placidus and Therospita his wife / and two of there
sons / of whom merueyllous things ben read / were martred by the
commandment of Adrian. This Placidus was master of the Emperors knights
Jerusalem was restored by Adrian and made larger / so that the place where
Christ deyed was within the walls / the which was without before. And this is
the third buyl dynge again of that cite / for yt was thryes destroyed. Of the
Caldees in the time of zedethee / of Anthyocus in the time of Machabeorum / and
of Tytus in the time of Vespacian.

Anno dm^.C.xliiii.
THelesporus a Romayne was pope.xi. year this man ordained this angels ympne
to be song in the mass (Glorya in excelsis deo etc^) and the gospel to be
read before the sacrynge / and o^ Crystemasse day three masses to be song. And
he ordained there should no mass be song be fore three of the clock. And at
the last he was martred and buried at saint Peters^ Ignyus a Greek was pope
four year. This man ordained that a child should have a god fader and a god
mother at the time of baptysynge: and also one at confyrmaco^n. Also that no
Archebysshop / except the pope shalde condemn his Suffrygan but if the cause
were showed in the prouyncyal counsel of bishops. Then^e he was martred and
buried at saint Peter's. Anthonius Pius was Emperor.xxii. year with his sons
Aurolio and Lucio This man was myghtly wise and naturelly fair of speech / the
which lightly in oo man is not found Noto. Exceeding men in wysdom comynly
are not fair speched / nor peasfull namely of nature / ne contrayous.
Exceeding men in fair speech come^ly are less than wise. This man was meued
with both these proprytees. Therefore many kingdoms the which receded from
other Emperors wylfully to this man turned again. And to christian men was no ne
so gentle. He said thrught the ensample of Cipio. I had lever keep one
hereof a man / than slay an hundred of mine enmyes. And some martyrs were made
under him / but they were made under the co^moundemente of the Emperors before.
And the crygen people were so hateful unto the bishops and to the priests
of ye Temple of the false gods: that they provoked the princes always ayenste
them. For they supposed that the christian faith should destroy them Therefore
it was no merualle: all though the price was vnpleased: for they said All there
gods were deuyllesy^ lower Iuges pursued christian folk and mar^ed: them. This
time.x. thousand martyrs. were crucyfyed in Arminea / in an high hylle called
Arath. Pompeius trogus isto tempore historias a nino vsque ad octauianu^
deduxit.

Anno dm^.C.liiii.
PIus ytalicus was pope.xi. year. and.iiii. months and.xv. days / This man
ordained the feast of Eester ever more should be hallowed on the sunday. And
also an heretyke coming fro the sect of the Jews should be received and
baptized. Then he was martred and buried in saint Peter. Anicetus was pope
after Pius almoost.x. year / this man made many decrees of the Canon and for
bishops (vt in cause violatores. etc^. Galienus a leche gotten in Pergamo was in
great fame at Rome. The which not alonly expowned the books of ypocras but he
put many of them to his books. And of this man is said / for his discrete
abstynence the which he used / he lived an hundred and.xl. years. He never ete
nor drank his fylle. Nota abstinenciam. He never took raw fruytes. Always he
had a sweet brethe. He deyed all only through aege and no sykenesse. Marcus
Anthonius the true / and Lucius Comodus were Empyrours.xix. year. These took
the Empire after Anthony the meke / and then began two Emperors to regne /
but Lucius Comodus decessed. And Anthom was Emperous a lone / the which was a
victorious man and a noble / but that he made the fourth persecucion to kylle
cryste^ men. This Marcus was of so great sadness and steadfastness / ye for no
chance he lough never / ne changed no chere / another for gladness ne for
sorrow. And when he was a child / he was of such manhood / that on a certain
time wha^ he looked his tresour / and had not that which he might give his
knights and his men when he went to fight ayenste the Germayns / the Sclauous
/ and Sarmatus / he would hurt ne grieve no body / but had lever to selle his
wives golden vessel and her arayment / her beddynge / and all her ryall stuff
/ than take tax of the Sena^ours / or of his prouynce under him But he gate
the victory of his enmyes / and recovered all again / and released the
prouences or there trybutes. And those that would selle him his wives tresour
again he restored them there money / and those that would not / he never grieved
them. But the tables of there dettes betwixt him and them he brent openly in the
market place and thanked them / that they helped him in his necessyte.

How king Luie reigned after his fader / that was a good man / and after he
became christian.
AFter this king Coill reigned Lucie his sone: that was a good man to god and
to all the people. He sent to Rome to Eulentre yt then was pope: and said. He
would become a christian man and receive bap^ym in the name of god and torn to
the right faith and believe. Eulentre se^te two Legates / yt were called Pagan:
an other Elybam in to this land and baptized the king and all his meyne And
after went from town to town and baptized the people till all the land was
baptized. And this was in the year an hundred.lvi. after the Incarncyon of our
lord Ihesu christ. And this king Lucie made tho in this land two
Archibysshops: one at Caunterbury an other at york and other many bisshops
that yet be^ in this land And when these two Legates had baptized all this
land: they ordained prestes for to baptyse chyldern: and for to make the
sacrament: and after they went again to Rome. And the king dwelled in his
land: and reigned with much honor.xii. year: and after deyed and lies at
Gloucestre.

How this land was long without a king: and how Brytons chose a king.
THis king Lucie had none heir of his body begote^: that was after ward great
harm and sorrow to the land. For after this king Lucies death: none of the
great lords of the land would suffer an other to be king: but lived in war
and debate among them self.l. year without king. But it befell after ward
that a great prince came from Rome i^ to these land that was called Seuerie:
not for war but for to save the right of Rome. But never theles he had not
dwelled half a year in this land but that the Brytons slew him. And when
they of Rome wist that Seueri was so slain: they sent an other great lord in
to this land that was called Allec that was a strong man and a mighty of body
and dwelled in this land long time and did much sorrow to the Brytons. So
that after for pure malice: they chose a king among them that was called
Astelepades. And assembled a gr^aee host of Brytons: and went to London to
seek Allec: and there they found him and slew him and all his fellows. And
one that was called walon deffended him fyersly: and fought long with the
Brytons but at the last he was dyscomfyted and the Brytons took him and bond
his hondes and feet and cast him in to a water. wherefore that water was called
ever more walbroke. Tho reigned Astelepades in peace: till one of his Earls that
was called Coill made a fair town ayenste the kings will: and let call the
town Colchestre after his own name. wherefore the king was full wroth and
thought to destroy him And began to war upon him and brought great power of
men and yaf the Earl battle. And the Earl defended him fyersly with his power
and slew the king himself in that battle. And tho was Coill crowned and made
king of this land. This Coill reigned and gouerened the land well and nobly /
for he was a noble man and well be loved amonged the Brytons. when tho of Rome
herd that Astelepades was slain: they were wonder glad: and sent an other
great prince of the Romans yt was called Co^stance. And he came to ye king
Coill for to challenge the trybute that was wo^te to be paid to Rome. And ye
king answered well and wisely and said: that he would pay to Rome all that
right and reason would with good will. And so they accorded tho with good will
and without any co^take. And so both they dwelled togyd in love. King Coill
yaaf to him his daughter Eleyne for to have her to his spowse / that was both
fair and wise and good and well lettred. and this Co^stance spowsed her there
with much honor. And it befell soon after that this king Coill deyed in
the.xiii. year of his regne / and lies at Colchestre entyred

Of king Constance that was a Romayne that was chosen king after ye deeh of
Coill for as much that he had spwsed Eleyne that was king Coils daughter.
AFter this king Coill Constance was made king and crowned / for asmoche as
he had spowsed king Coils daughter that was heir of that land. The which
Co^stance reigned well and worthily governed ye land And he begat on his wife
Eleyne a son that was called Consta^tyne. And this king bare true faith. And
truly did unto them of Rome all his life. And when he had reigned.xv. year / he
deyed and lies at york.

How Co^sta^tine that was ki^ge Consta^ce sone / and the sone of Saint Eleyne
governed and ruled the land / and was Emperor of Rome.
AFter king Constance death reigned Constantyne his sone and the sone of saint
Eleyne that found the holy cross in the holy land. And how Constantyne be
came Emperor of Rome. It befell so in ye time there was an Emperor at Rome
that was a Sarrasy and a tyrant / yt was called Maxence / that put to death
all that byleued i^ god and destroyed holy church by all his power and
sleweall Christian mi^ that he might find And among all other he let martyr
Saint Katheryne. And many other christian people that had dread of death fled
and came in to this land to king Constantyne. And told him of the sorrow
that Maxence did to the Crystyanytee wherefore Constantyne had pity / and made
great sorrow / and assembled a great host and a great power and went over unto
Rome / and there took the cite and slew all that there was i^ that were of
mysbyleue that he might there ^ynde / And tho was he made Emperor and was a
good man and governed him so well that all ^ondes to him were attendaunt for to
be under his gouernaunce^ And this devil and ty^aun Maxence that time was in
the land of Gre^e / and herd these tydyngs / and suddenly became wood / and
suddenly he deyed and so he ended his life. when Constantyne went from this
land unto Rome: he took with him his mother Eleyne / for the much wisdom
that she could / and th^e other great lords that he much loved / ye one was
called Hoell an another was called Taberne / and the third Morhyn And took
alhys land to keep unto the Earl of Corn wayle that was called Octauyan. And
so anon as this Octauyan wyste that his lord dwelled at Rome. Inco^tynent he
seized all the land in to his hand / and therwyth did all his will among
high and low and they hellde him for king. when these tidings came to
Constantyne the Emperor: he was wonder worthee toward the Earl Octauyan And
sent Taberne with ^xii.M. men for to destroy the earl for his falsenesse. And
they arrayued at Por tesmouth. And when Octauyan wist that he assembled a great
power of Brytons and dyscomfyted Taberne and Taberne fled thens in to
Scotlonde. and ordained there a great power / and came ayne in to this land
another time to give battle to Octauian. when Octauian herd that / he
assembled a grate power and came to ward Taberne as much as he might / so
that those two hosts met togyders upon Stanesmore / and strongely smote
together / and tho was Octauian dysco^fyted / and fled thens unto Norwaye. And
Taberne seassed all the land in his hand / towns and castelles / and as
much as they there had. And syn Octauian came again from Norwaye with a great
power and seized all the land in his hand and drove out all the Romans ^ and
was tho made king and reigned.

How Marimian yt was the Emperors cosyn of rome spowsed Octauians daughter and
was made king of this land.
THis Octauian governed ye land well and nobly / but he had none heir save a
daughter that was a young child that he loved as much as his life And for as
much as he wered syke and was in point of det / and might no longer regne /
he would have made one of his neuewes to have be king / the which was a noble
knight and a strong man that was called Conan Mer^edok^ and he should have
kypte the kings daughter and have married her when time had been. But the lords
of the land would not suffer it / but yaaf her counsel to be married to some
high man of great honor and then might she have all her lust / and the
counsel of the Emperor Constantyne her lord. And at this counsel they
accorded / and chose tho Cador of Cornewaylle for to go to the emperor for to
do this message. And he took the way and went to Rome / and told the
Emperor this tidings well and wisely. And the Emperor sent in this land
with him his own cosyn that was his uncles sone a noble knight and a strong /
yt was called Maximian. And he spowsed Octauians daughter / and was crowned
king of this land.

How Maximian that was themperours cosyn / conquered the land of Armorycam /
and yaaf it to Conan Meriedok.
THis king Maximian became so ryall that he thougt to conquer the land of
armory came for the great richesse that he herd tell yt was in that land / so
that he ne life man that was of worthynes / knight / squere ne none other man /
that he ne took with him to the great damage to all the land. For he left at
home behind him no man to keep the land / but took them with him fro this
land.xxx. thousand knights that were doughty men's bodies / and went over
to the land of. Armorycam and there slew the king yt was called Imball / and
conquered all the land. and when he had so done / he called Conan and said.
For as much as king Octauian made you king of Brytayne / and through me ye
were let and dystroubled that ye were not king. I give you this land of
Armorycam / and you there of make king. And for as much as ye be a. Bryton. I
well that this land have the same name / and no more be called Armoricam / but
be called Brytayne. And the land from whens we be comen shall be called much
Brytayne And so shall men know that one Brytayne fro thae other. Conan
Meriedok thanked him greatly / and so was he made king of little Brytayne. And
when all this was done. Maximian went from thens unto Rome / and tho was made
Emperor after Constantyne. And Conan dwelled still in little Brytayne with
much honor / and there let ordeyne.ii. thousand ploughmen of the land for
to culture the land to harow it and for to sow it and feffed the^ rychely
after yt they were. and for asmoche as king Conan and none of his knights ne
no^e of his othere people would not take wives of ye nacio^ of france / he tho
sent in to great. Brytayne to the earl of Cornewayle that me^ called dionothe
that he should these thorugh out all this land.xi.M. of maidens. That is to
say.viii.M. for the mean people / and.iii^M. for the grettest lords that
should them spowse. And when Dyonoth understood this / he made a commandment
thorughout all the land of Brntayne. And as many as the nombre came to be
assembldy together of maidens / for there was no man that durst wythstande his
commandments / for as much that all the land was take him to ward and
keep / to do all thing that him good lyked. And when these maidens were
assembled / he let them come a fore him at London. And let ordeyne for them
ships hastily / and as much as them neded to that vyage. And took his own
daughter that was called Vrsula that was the fairest creature that any man
wist. And he would have sent her to konge Conan / that should have spowsed her
and made her queen of the land But she had made pryuely to god a vow of
chastyte / that her fader not wist / ne no^e other man else that was living
upon earth

How Vrsula and.xi. thousand maidens that were in her company went to ward
little Brytayne / and all they were martrde at Colayne.
This Vrsula chose unto her company.xi. thousand maidens / that of all other
she was lady and meystresse And all they went to ship at one time in the
water that is called Tamyse / and commanded her kynne and her friends to
almighty god / and saylled to ward little Brytayne. But when they were come in
to the high see / a strong tempest arose as it was gods will / and vrsula
with her ships and her compny were drive to Hundlonde through temstpe / and
arrived in the haven of the cite of Coleyne And the king of the land that was
called Gowan / was tho in the cytee^ And when he wist the tidings / that so
many fair maidens were there arrived: He took Elga his broher and other of his
household with him and went to the ships to see that fair company. And when
he saw them so fair: he and his company would have ouerlayne them and take
fro them there mayndehode. But Vrsula that good maid coumseylled: prayed:
warned: and taught them that were her fellows that they should defend them
with all their might: and rather suffer death tha^ suffer there body to be
defoyled. So that all tho maidens became so steadfast in god: that they
defended them thrughe his grace: so that none of them had power to do them
shame. wherefore the king Gowan was sore anon that he for wrath slew them
euerychone anon right: and so were all tho maidens martred for the love of
god: and lies at Coleyne.

How king Gowan came for to destroy this land and how a man of great power
that was called Gracian deifended the land.
AS all this was done king Gowan that was a Sarrasyn called his brother. Elga
and said to him: that he should go conquer the land that all those fair
maidens were borne in. And he ordened tho a great power of Pehites of denmark
of or^e^ay and of Norway^ And they came in to this land: and burnt towns and
slew folk: and cast a down chirches and houses / and ^obbed all the land in
length and bread and put to death all tho that would not forsake the right
believe and crystendome / for as much as there was no sovereign that might them
help. For the king Maximian had take with him all the worthy men when he went
to conquer little. Brytayne And in the same time ye ye here now tell was
saint Albon martryd through the wo^d tyr^^^ Dyoclesyan / in the same place where
is now^ an abbaye made of saint Albon whiles that he was a paynym. But he
converted him to god through the predicacyon of clerk and a wise man that was
called. An^^ble that was ^^rbourghed a night in his house. And this was after
thyn carnacyon of Ihesu Christ ^ii. hundred.xxvi. year. And men shall
understand that saint. Albon suffered his martyrdom before that saint Edmonde
was martryd and therefore is saint. Albon called the first martyr of England.
This Gowans brother and his folk that were sarrasyns went through the lord and
destroyed al thing that they found and no thing they spared^ when these
tidings came to rome how ye king Gowan had begone for to destroy this land /
ye Emperor of come sent a strong man and of great power that was called
Gracian with ^xxiiii.M. well fighting men for to cast out those sarrasyns of
this land. And all they arrived at Portsmouth. Maximian might not come himself
/ for as much. as he was chosen Emperor after the death of Constantyne that
was Saint Eleyns sone. when this Gracian was arrived with his host / he let
sapye preuely where king Gowan might be found. And he set upon them suddenly
as they lay in their beds / and disco^fyted him and slew them in there
beds euerychone / that none of them escaped / sauff Gowan that fled in to
his own country with much sorrow and great pain. Soon after it befelle
that Maximian was slain at Rome thrughe treason. And when Gracian wyste that
tydynge he let crown him king of this land.

How Gracian made him king when Maximian was slain / and after ward the
Brytons slew him for his wickedness.
THis Gracian when he began to regne he became so wicked and so stern / and
so much sorrow did to the Brytons yt they slew him among them. Tho when
king Gowan understood yt Gracian was slain and done to death he assembled a
great power and came again in to this land. And if he had first done harm tho
did he much more. For tho destroyed he all this land / and the christian people
that were in much Brytayne so that no man was so hardy for to name god / and
he that so did anon he was put to strange death. But ye bishop of London that
was that was called Gosselim escaped / and went thens to them of Rome to seek
socour / to help to dystroy the sarrasyns that had destryed this land. And
the Romans said / that they had been so often enoyed for there sendinge people
in to Brytayne all for to help the Bryto^s / and they would no more so do /
and so the Bishop Gosselin went thens without any socoure or help. And tho
went he to the king of little Brytane that was called Aldroye / and this was
ye third king after Gowan Meryedok / as before is said. The bishop prayed
this Aldroye of help and socoure / and the king had pity in his heart when he
herd how the bishop fled / and how that the christian men were so slain in
great. Brytayne through ye paynyms and sarrasyns / he granted him co^stantyne
his brother him for to help with power of folk. And then did arraye horse
armor and ships and al things that neded to that vyage. And wha^ al thing
was ready / he called ye bishop / and to him said I take you here Co^stantyne
my brother upon this couenau^^. That if god give him grace the paynems and that
sarrasins to destroy yt ye then make him king. And the bishop granted with
good will. Constantyne and the bishop took leave of ye king Aldroye and betoke
him to god and took men.xii. thousand and went to there ships and saylled to
ward great Brytayne and arrived at Totnesse. when the Brytons herd these
tidings that to the^ came socoure / they were strongely helped / and ordained
the^ an huge no^bre of people and came to them and received them with much
honor. Gowan anon as he wist of these tidings / he assembled all ye
Sarrasyns and came against them and yaue the^ battle. An^ Co^stantyne slew him
with his own ho^des. And all those other Sarrasyns were dyscomfyted and slain
that no^e of them escaped but those that were converted unto almighty god.

How Constantyne that was the kings brother of little Brytayne was crowned
king of great Brytayne / for his great virtue and his great worthynesse.
Anon after ye battle they went to London and crowned there Co^stantyne and
made him king of this lord. And ye bishop Gosselyn set the crown on his
heed and anointed him / as it befalls for a king to be. And tho began
crystendome again in this land / And anon this king Constantyne as he was
crowned. Anon after he spowsyd his wife through counsel of ye Bryto^s And he
begat three sons on her. The first was called Co^stance and that other
Aurilambros / and ye third Vter. This Co^stance the elder brother* when he came
to aege he made him a monk at wynchestre. This Constantyne their fader
through treason was slain For it befell on a time that a Pehite came to him upon
a day in message as yt were. And said that he would speak with ye king preuely
in counsel. The king let void his chamber of the men yt were there with in
/ and there abode no moo but yt king and the Pehite. and he made a cou^tenau^ce
as though he would have spoken with the king in his eere. And there he slew
him with a long knyf. And after that he went meruaylously out of the chamber
in to a another chamber so at ye last no man wist where he was become. when the
kings me^ wist that their lord was so deed they made then so much sorrow
that they wist not what to do. For as much as his two sons Aurilambros and
Vter were so young / that they might not be king / and the third was a monk
as is said before. But Vortiger that was Earl of westsex thought preuely in
his heart thrugt queyntaunce for to be king himself. And went to wynchestre /
where that Constance was monk / and said unto him. Constance said he / your
fader is deed and your two brethern that been with Gosselyn ye bishop of London
to nourysshe be so young / ye none of the^ may be king. wherefore I counsel you
/ yt ye forsake your habyte and come with me. And I shall make such a mean
unto ye Brytons / yt ye shall be made king.

Of Constance that was king Consta^tynes sone / that was a monk at wynchestre
and how he was made king after his faders death thorugh counseyll of Vortyger
that was Earl of westsex / for as much a Aurylmabros and Vter his two brethern
were but young of aege. And Vortyger let slay him for to be king himself.
This Vortyger cou^selled this Constance so much / till he forsook his abbot
and went with him. And anon after he was crowned king by thassent of the
Brytons. This king Constance when he was crowned and made king / he wist ne
knew but little of the world ne cude nothing what knyghthode axed^ And he
made vortiger his chyef master and cou^seyller / and gaf him all his power /
for to-ordeyne and do as much as to ye reame aperteyned. So that himself no
thing entermedled but only bare the name of king. when Vortiger saw that he
had all the land in his ward and gouernall / he thought a preuy treason to
slay Constance the king / that he might him self be crowned and made king and
regne. And let send after an ho^dred kynghtes of Pehites the worthyest of all
ye land / and them held with him for to dwell \ as to be kepers of his body
as he would goo thorugh the land to ordeyne things that apperteyned to a
king. And this Vortiger honored so much the hundred kynghtes and so much
yaue them of gold and silver and so rich Iewelles / robes horses and other
things plente / wherefore they held him more lord than they did the king.
And Vortyger told them / if he might be king / ye as it were through treason /
he would make them rychest of the land. So at the last through great gifts
that he had given largely they cried through the court that Vortyger were beter
worthy to be king than Constance. wherefore Vortiger made semblaunt as he had been wroth. And he departed thens from the court: and said he must goo else
were for things that he had to do. And so the traitor said for by cause
that they should slay him: that is to say Constance. when this Vortyger was
gone: yt befell soon after: yt tho hundred kynghtes of Pehyces brake the
doors of the kings chamber and there they him slew: and smote of his heed
and bare it to Vortiger there that he dwelled. And so when vortiger saw that
heed he wept full tenderly with his eyes: and never theles he was some deal
glad in his berte of his deth^ And anon this vortiger took those hundred
kenghtes of Pehytes: and badde his servants bind their hondes behind them:
and ladde them to London: and there they were dampened unto death as falls
traitors. And anon after all the Brytons of the land by the common assente
crowned vortiger and made him king of the land

SOther a martyr was pope after Anycetum.ix. year the which decreed that a
Nonne should not touch the pale of the awter: nor put in sense thereto. And

crystendome dured in Brytayne two ho^dred year: unto the time of Dyoclesyan the
Emperor when saint Albon was martred. Marcus Anthonius: and Lucius Comodus
were Emperors / but Marcus deyed anon / and Lucius Comodus reigned. Comodus
was called prouffytable of scorn / for he was to every man vnprouffytable. He
was yeuen utterly to lechery. Many Senators and Christian men he made to be
slain. He dampened his own wife to death for aege. He deyed a sodeyne death with
struglynge among maidens. Helius Pertinax after this man was Emperor.vi.

consecracyon of ye glorious blood was made in tree vessell^ And this time past
/ and the worship of the church grew / and glasen vessel were forbode (Vt
patet de conse. de pri. ca.) Origenes the noble clerk was this time / and he
wrote so much / that saint Jerome said I have read of Origenes works.iiii.
thousa^de volimes without pystles. He translated the Bible from Hebrwe in to
Greek / and did many other great things. And of this Origenes Sampson.
Solomon / and Traian / is a great question among doctors if yt they ben
dampened or saved. Therefore those things yt with out perell we ben not bound
to know nor the church is not certifyed of them. And therefore let them
alonly committed unto god. Calistus a martyr and a Romayne was pope after

nevertheless in this time the cursed officers of him made many martyrs.

Anno dm^.CC.xliiii.
VRbanus was pope after Calistus.viii. year / and old and young he was very
virtuous. And all the hallowed vessels of the church he made of gold or
silver. This man left his popehede and went to Agryppa and.xi. thousand

master the pope departed this tresour about Rome / the which was great cause
of his martyrdom (Vt quide^ dicunt) Decius was Emperor three year / and in all
things a tyrau^t. For he entered thempyre when he and the host had slain the
two Philyppes his lords and after that he was slain with his sone. Fabianus a
martyr and a Romayne was pope after Anteros.xii. year / this was a very holy
man. For when Christian men stood to abide the eleccyon of the pope / suddenly a
white douue or a culuour descended on his heed / saying unto him / thou shall
be pope of Rome. This man ordained every year ye Creme should be hallowed upon
Sherethursdaye. Also he divided regyons to deakens the which should write the

virtuous and manly in the beginning / but after was given to vice / and much
wrytchednesse. And so was his sone Galiene. This valerian went unto the land
of Perse. And therefore ye great blod of martyrs which he had shed was taken
of the king of Perse. And when he had take him he put out both his eyes and
kept him in great bondage. And to this entente he kept him / that when so ever
he should ride / this Veferian shall be lie down / and he should set his leet
upon his back when he would take his horse. This herd Galiene his sone yt was
left at Rome. And that caused him that he was not so cruel against Christian
men. And here was the.viii. persecucyon of the church made by the Emperor.
And made ye Romans to lose there kingdoms / the which were never recouerd

weste. The first thing that Dyoclesyan did: he burnt all ye christian men's
books that might be found. The two tyrauntes did more harm to Christian men
than ever did any other^ For.x. year lasted the persecucyon. And as we read.
with in ^xxx. days.xx. thousand men were slain for Crystis sake. And in
England all faith was almost destroyed in ye time of maximian Gaius was pope
after Euticianus / this man ordained that no man should accause a bishop or an
other clerk to any seculer Judge. And yt a pagon or an heretyke should not
accuse a Christian man. Also he ordained that he yt was worthy should ascend gree
by gree to his order / fyrsten Benet / than Colet / subdeacon / deacon / and
than priest. And at ye last he was martred under Dyoclesyan. Arcellinus a
martyr was pope after Gaius.xi. year and.iiii. months This man was persecuted
sore / for dread of death he of freed three corns of incense to the sacrefyce of
the ydolles. And after ward he openly repented / and suffered the pain of death
for the faith of the church of god. His body lay unburied three days for dred
of the curse of god. And after thorugh auysyon of saint peter and Marcell he
was buried at saint Peter's foot. Marcellus was pope after Marcellinus.v. year.
This man ordained that a general counseyl might not be ordained without the
auctorite of the pope (vt pz.xvii. di.c. sinodu^) Also he chose.xv. Cardynalles
in the cite to burye christian men. At the last when he had kept beestes long
time in a house closed in with them / by the commandment of Maximian / he
deyed for fault. Eusebius a martyr was after this man two months and certain
days. This man of a lay man was made pope / and he ordained that no lay
ma^sholde accuse his bishop but if he went fro his faith (vt pz.ii.ix.vii.c.
laicos) Nato. This time saint Albon was martred in Brytayne. This Albon when he
was a pagan / he lodged a certain man / the which converted him to the faith
and after was Iuged unto death. And much people he turned unto our lord /
that were nygh the water / the which he made dry through his prayer. And he
suffered death nygh ye cite of verelom (Vide plura in vita sancti Albani)
Melchiades a martyr succeeded Eusebius.iiii. year. This man forbode ye men
should fast on Sunday or on Thursdaye in so much as paganes fast on those
days. At the last he was martred as al his predecessors were. And
understand ye that there were.xxxiii. popes of Rome martred each one after
other. Peter was the first / and this melchiades was the last. And then^e it
was laudable after Gregory / a man to desire a bysshopryche. Galerius was
Emperor after Dyoclesyan two year / and an other with him called Consta^cius
So was the Empire in those days divided. This Consta^cius after he had
conquered all spain / he came in to great Brytayne / and there he wedded a
kings daughter an whom he gate great Constantyne. And this same Constancius
deyed in Brytayne / and lies at york / as Martyne says in his Chronicles /
and left on live Constantyne that was gotten on Eleyne and was king of Brytayne
and of France

Circa annu^ dm^.CCC.viii.
SIluester was pope after Melchiades. This was a glorious Confessor / and many
ways he worshipped ye church of god what in writing / what in miracles. He
recyued ye pratrymony of saint Peter. That is for to say the kingdom of ytalye
with the cite of Rome of Constantynople the Emperor / and to the worship of
the hole universal church of god he turned it. He baptized Eeleyne and the
Jews / and then he decessyd an holy Confessor Constantyne the mighty was
Emperor this time. This Constantyne was a glorious man and a victoryous in
bataylle. In gouernynge of the common people he was very wise And in the
necessyte of the believe he was with out compayre. Devout. His pity and his
holiness ben so written in the books of holy doctors / that without doubt / he
is to be nombred among Saints. And the Greeks say that in the end of his
life he was made a amo^ke. And more ey may here of him in the Chronicles of
England. For he was king in England. Helena the queen mother to Constantyne
repaired again the holy Cross this time. And she made.lxx. Colleges / and she
glorified the state of all holy church. Nicholas bishop of Myrree seete an
holy man was this time. Athanasius was this time bishop in Alexandre a
glorious doctoure / made the (symbalum Quicunque vult saluus esse. etc^. Marcus
was pope after Siluester two year and.viii. months / this man ordained the
Creed should be openly song in the church. And that the bishop of Hostience
should consecrate the pope / and that he should were a palle. Julius was pope
after Marcus.xi. year / under Constantyne the second. Constanus this man was
exiled.x. year and after suffered death under Constantyne the second.
Constantinus with his two brethern redned.xxiiii. year. And in his last end
he was perverted by the heresyet of the Arience by a bishop called Eusebe. And
he pursued ye church of god stro^gely. The end of this man was this. as he
should go to co^sta^tynople unto agret counseyll in ye which cou^cyl he thought
to have co^de^pned ye bishop and ye clerks of true believe / he went before
unto a chamber to avoid such things as nature required / and anon suddenly
his bowels fell from him / and thereby was deed as ye now here. Liberius was
pope after Julius.xix. year and.vii. months. Then was the second dyscorde
of the church between Liberyus and Felix / for the heresye of the Ariens ye
which favored Lyberyus. Then Constancyus the emperor called again Liberius
from his exyle / by cause he favored this heresye And the church deycede
Liberyus and took Felix for pope / and the other was expulsed as an heretyke of
the church. But Felyx obtained not / for the Emperor put in Lyberyus and
expulsed Felyx. Feilix was pope after the death of this Lyberyus. And he
declareed Constancyus the Emperor an heretyke and anon after he was martred.
And here was the first that ever ye church of Rome had an Infamed pope. For
all ye predecessors of this Liberyus were saints and yaue holy ensamples.
Iulymus Apostata was after Constancyus Empero ur two year and.viii. months /
He was called Apostata for he fleede this Constancius / which slew his
brother. And for fere of death was made a christian man and a monk. But after
ward by the counsel of Nygromancers / he asked ye devil whether he should
be Emperor or not. The devil said that he should be Emperor upon a
condycyon that he should forsake his christian faith and be utter enmye to
christian men And so he dode. For he yaue leave to the Jews that they should
build again the Temple in spyte of the christian men. And he took all the goods
that christian men had and destroyed many of them. Iomynyanus was Emperor after
him.viii. months. For when Iulyanus was deed the host chose him Emperor.
And he was a christian man. And he said it was not lestull to a christian man to be
lord over so many hethen people. They answered and said. Rather than he should
forsake ye Empire they would be crystened. And thus took he the dygnytee. But
soon he was deed / and in a meruayllous manner. For he was laid in a cholse
house after his Iourneye made all of stone newely whyted with lyme / in ye
which they made to his comfort as they thought a fire of charcoole^ And of
the air of these two in the morrow he was found deed. Valentinian with his
brother Valent was Emperor after Iominianus.xi. year For he departed the
Empire and gave his brother the eest / and keep himself the west part / This
Valentinian was a lord with Iulyanus Apostata. And it happed him on a time for
to goo in a Temple of false gods for to do satcrefyce. And mynystres stood
there with water hallowed after the gyse with the which they strynkled the
lords. This valentinian smote the mynyster that cast the water upon him and
said. He was rather defoyled by it than cleansed. For this Iulianus did exile
him. But our lord god for his open confession of his name rewarded him with
the Empire. His brother Valent fell in to the opinion of the Ariens and deyed
in that heresye. This same Valent lived four year after Vale^tinian with
Gracian the emperor. ^Thys time lived saint Ambrose.

Anno dm^.CCC.xliiii.
DAmacias was pope after. (...) lix.xviii. year and two mon^thes this was an
eloquent man in meter. And he wrote many stories of popes and martyrs^ He
ordained that. G^oria patri should be said in ye ends of the psalms. And that
was at the prayer of saint. Ierom. And through the mocyon of this pope. Jerome
translated the. Bible from Hebrewe in to Latin / and then he decessed a
confessor. Valence with Gracian and Valentinian were Emperors four year / In
this time were chirches opened again and christian men had leave to renew the
service of god that was defended before with Emperors enfected with heresye as
was Valens and other / wherefore the church had no lyberte when valens was on
live. A Synodus of a ho^dred and.l. bishops were gadred under Damasius pope at
Consta^tynople ayenste Macedoniu^ an heretyke / the which denied the holy
ghost to be very god. And then^e was the Creed made / that is song on holy
days in the church. Augustynus a Cartaginen^ of Africa was this time He was
as noble a Rethoricien as might ebe. And in. all phylosophye and poetrye in
comparable And all thing that any philosopher found in his yougth he
understood with little labor And about this time he was sent to Mediolanum
where he was turned anon of saint Ambrose and baptized. This man grew unto
anoble doctor of the church. And not long after that he was bishop of
yponen^. And there he lived.iiii. year / and much dyuynyte he wrote (vt patet
in librissu is) Siritus was pope ofter Damasius.xv. year / he dampened heretykes
and little else is written of him. Thodosyus sone to Gracian with vale^tyne his
uncle were Emperors.^xvii. year / This man was a christian man and gracyous /
and in governance like to Trayanus / soon wroth and anon reconsyled. This
man on a day when he would have gone to have herd mass / saint Ambrose
forbadde him the entree of ye church / till he had penance and made
satysfaccion for the sleenge of.xxx. knights the which he slew in anger at
Constantynople. wherefore they made a law that the sentence of a prince should
be deferred.xxx. days of those yt should do execusoon if they might fall in
the grace of the prince within the.xxx. days. About this time was a child
borne in the castle of Emons / from the nauyll and above divided in two bodies
/ having two heedes and two wits / so ye the one slepynge or etynge / the
other slept not neete not. And when they were two year of a ege / the one
decessyd and the other lived three days after. Claudius poeta was this time.
Arcadius and Honorius reigned.xxx. year. And in their time Rome was nere
destroyed by a king called Alaticus. Of the which destruccyon rose a great
blasphemye of the Romans. For they said they farde never well sythen Christ
came to Rome / and bereeued them there goods by the prechyng of Peter and Poul
And yet this Arcadyus subdued all his enmyes by the power of god / and shed
no blood. Ayenste this blasphemye saint Austyn made that solemn work / the
which they call (de cyuytate dei) Honorius was Emperor with Theodosius his
brothers sone.xv. year and he was a man of holy life. For two wives he had / and
yet with both he deyed mayden^ He loved specially the church and hated
heretykes. Ierom deyed this time at Bethleem the year of his aege.lxxxi.
Sanctus Heracides the which wrote Vitas patru^ to lapsn^ episcopu^ was this
time. Ioho^nes Crysostomus was exiled of Endochia the wife of Arcadius / and
through heete of the son he was deed. Anastasius was pope after Siritius three
year. This man or deyned that eueryman should stand at the redynge of ye holy
gospel. and that he that was a maimed man should not be priest. Innocencius
was pope after Anastasius / this man ordained ye syke men should be anointed
with holy oil. And at mass ye kiss of peace to be yeuen And he dampened
Pelagyen an heretyke and many other things did (vt patet.xxvi. q. i.)

Anno dm^.CCCC.xiiii.
zOzimus was pope after Innoce^cius two year and.viii. months / This man
ordained that clerks should be no tauerners ne selle no wine / and that a
bound man should be made no priest (...) the license of his lord. Bo^ (...)
Romayne was pope after zozimus four year. This man ordained that a woman
should not touch ye palle of the water ne should not wasse the awter.
Celestimus a Romayne was pope after Bonifacius.viii. year and.ix. days / the
which ordained the psalm before mass. (Iudica medeus. etc^.) And at the
beginning of the mass should be said a verse of a psalm / and at the Grayle
/ and that the Offertorye should be said before the sacrynge. This same man
sent saint Patryke to Irlonde to convert ye land and Palladius deaken of.
Rome to the. Scotts to be converted. And in the fourth year of this man there
was a general. Synody at Ephysima of three hundred bishops ayenste Nestorium
an heretyke. Theodosius the younger with valentinian his neue we reigned.xxvii.
year. In his time was the feast ordained / which is called Aduincula sancti
petri. And in his time deyed saint Austyn / in the year of his aege.lxxvi. And
this time was raised the.vii. slepers / ye which sleped two hundred years.
This man deyed at Constantynople and there was buried. This time the. Saxons
entered England / and anon by little and little they grew up myghtely. And
at the last they opteyned all the land. Sixtus a Romanyne was pope after
Celestinus.viii. year. This was a holy man and a meke And little of him is
written but ye he builded Sa^cta ma^ria mayor. Leo Tuscus a Confessor was pope
after Sixtus. This man was as holy as any man. Five times in a day or more he
would say mass. And on a time. After yt befell when a cretayne woman kyssed
his hand / he was tempted with her / And for the trespaas that he had done /
unto his penance he made his hode to be stryken of. And when the noise rose
upon him that he might not say mass as he was wont to do / then he was
right sorry. And all only betoke him in prayre to our lady to help him. And our
lady restored him his hand again and then he said mass as he was wont for
to do. And so that miracle was openly show to all people. And in the time of
this pope. Marcian the Emperor being there / was congregate at. Calcedony the
fourth universal. Synody of.vi. hundred and.xxx. bishops against. Eugicem the
abbot of. Constantynopolyton. and (Alexandrum episcopum. qui negauerunt in
chrysto veram carnem fuisse. et etiam negabant carnis nostre resurrectionem.)
And after he had made many notable sermons and epystles he decessed.
Marcianus and valentianus were Emperors this time.vii. year. In whose time was
the great. Synody before reherced / when Eusticem and Dyoscorus were condemned.

IN the time that Macianus was Emperor vortyger was king in Brytayne now
called. England. In whose time ye. Saxons came in to Brytoyne and made many
kings. That is to wit as is plain by the Cronyeles.vii And by cause it is
tedyous to man's reason to reherce many diverse names to gyder as.vii. kings
of England and in one time / the Emperors and Popes. Therefore the Chronicles
of England shall be set together tylle yt we shall treat of Alured. In whose
time the Danes came in to England. And ye Popes and ye. Emperors and other
kings deed the same time shall be se^^^ together.

Circa annu^ dm^.CCCC.xlix.
This time came ye. Saxons that were pagans first in to Brytane now called.
England under vortiger the which was crowned king of this land. This time
those yt had these two childern in kepinge ye which were Co^stantynes sons.
That is to say Aurilambros and vter / through ordynance of Gosselin that was
bishop of. London after the faders death that is to say. Constantyne durst not
dwell in this land with those childern / but conveyed them unto the king of
little Brytayne. For as much as he tho wist the treason of vortiger that tho
was made king. Thorugh who me. Constance the elder brother was slain /
wherefore the hundred knights of Pehites were put to death and bore all the
blame as that vortiger had not wist there of ne consented. And so the kepers
of those two chyldern dradde lest vortiger should put them to death through his
treason and falsenesse / As he had done the brother before. And therefore they
were ladde over in to little. Brytayn / and the king them received with much
honor and let them to nourysshe. And there they dwelled till they became
fair knights and strong and fyers. And thourght to be avenged upon
Constaunce their brother when they saw their time and so they did as ye
shall here tell after ward. It was not long after ward that ye tidings
came ouersee to ye kynred of the hundred knights of Pehites that were dampened
and put to death through Vortiger in this land / therefore they were wonderly
wroth and swore that they would be avenged of their kynnes men's death. And came
in to this land with a great power / and robbed in many places / and slew
and did all ye sorrow that they might. when Vortiger it wist / he made much
sorrow and was sore anoyed / And in an other place also tidings came to him
that Aurilambros and Vter his brother assembled a great host to came in to
much Brytayne / that is to say in to this land / for to be avenged upon
Constance their brothers death. So in that one half and in that other / he was
brougho in to so much sorrow that he ne wist whether to go.

How Engist and an.xi. thousand me^ came in to this land / to whom vortiger
yaue a place that is callde Thongcastell.
ANd soon after this sorrow / tydinges came to vortyger that a great navy of
strangers were arrived in ye country of Cent / he wist not whe^s they were ne
wherefore they were come in to this land. The king sent anon a messager
thither / that some of should come and speak with him / for to wit what folk
they were and what they axed / and in to what country they would. There were
two brethern masters and princes of that strong company / that one was called
Engist and that other Horn. Engist went to the king and told him the cause
wherefore / they were come in to this land and said. Syrewe ben of a country
that is called Saxonne / that is ye land of Germayne / wheryn is so much
sorrow / That of the people ben so many that the land may not them
susteynes. And the masters and princes that have ye land to govern and rule.
They made to come before them men and wymmen that boldest ben among them for
to fight / and that best may trauayll in to diverse lands. And so they
should them give horse and harnes / armor / and all thing that they needs.
And after they shall say to them / that they go in to an other country where
that they mowelyue / as their And cetrees did them before. And therefore sir
king / if ye have ought to do with our company: we ben comen in to your
land: And with good will you would serve your land keep help and defend
from your enmyes if that ye need. when vortyger herd these tidings: he said
gladly he would them with hold: upon such couenanuce: if they might
deliver his land of his enmyes: he would give them reasonable lo^des where
they should dwell for ever more. Engyst thanked him goodly: and in this manner
he and his company a.xi. thousand should dwell with the king vortiger. And
much they did through their boldness: they delivered his land of his enmyes
clean. Tho prayed Engyst the king of so much land that he might make to him
a Cite and for his meyne. The king answered / it was not to do without the
coancell of Brytons. Engist prayed him eftsoon of as much plyce as he might
compace with a thonge of a skyn^e whereupon he might make a. Mancer for him to
dwell in. And the king him granted freely.

Tho took Engist a bulls skin / and kytte it as sma^e as he might all in to
oo thonge all a round. And there with compaced he as much land as he might
then^e make upon a fair castle. And so when this castle was made / he let
call it Thongcastell for as much as ye place was marked with a thonge.

Of Ronowen that was Engistes douhter / and how the king Voreiger spowsed her
for her beauty.
SO when this castle was made / and full well arrayed. Engist pryuely did send
by letter i^ to ye country where he came fro / after an.C. ships filled with
men ye were strong and also well fighting in all bataylles / and ye they
should also bring with them. Ronowen his daughter that the fairest creture
that a man might see. And when those people were. come that he had sent
after / he took them in to the castle with much. Joy. And himself upon a
day went unto the king / and prayed him there worthily that he would come and
see his new maneer that he had made in the place yt he had compassed with the
thonge of the skin. The king anon granted him freely. And with him went
thither / and was well apayed with the castle and with the fair work and
together they ete and drank with much Joy. And when night came that the king-
Vortiger should go in to his chamber to take there his nyghtes rest. Ronowen
yt was Engistes daughter came with cup of gold in her hand / and kneled
before the king and said to him (wassaylle) And the king knew not what it
was for to mean ne what he should answer there upon / for as much as himself
/ ne none of all his Brytons could no English spese ne understand it / but
he spoke in the same langage that. Brytons done yet. Nevertheless a latiner
told it to the king the full understanding thereof (wassayll) and that other
should drink (hayll) And that was the first time that (wasshayll) and
(drynkhall) came up in this land. And from ye time unto this time / it is
well used in this land. The king Vortiger saw the fayrnesse of Ronowen / and
his arms laid about her neck / and thryes swetely kyssed her / and anon
right he was enamoured upon her yt he desired to have her to wife and asked of
Engist her fader. And Engist granted him upon this covenant / yt the king
should give him all the country of kent / that he there might dwell in and
his people. The king him granted pryuely with a good will. And anon he
spowsed ye damoysell / and that was much confusyon to himself. And therefore
all the. Brytons became so wroth / for by cause he spowsed a woman of
mysbyleue. wherefore they went all from him / and no thing to him took / ne
halpe him in thing that he had to done.

How Vortimer that was Vortigers sone was made king / and Engist driven out.
And how Vortimer was slain.
THis Engist went in to Kente and seized all ye land in to his hand for him
and for his men / and bycame with a little while of so great power and so
much people had / that men wyste not little time which were the kings men
and which were Engistes men. wherefore all the Brytons had of him dredde /
and said among them. But if that they ne took other counseyll between them
all the land should be bytrayed through Engist and his people. Vortiger the
king had begoten on his first wife three sons. The first was called vortimer.
The second Catagien / and the third Passent. The Brytons euerychont by one
assent chose vortimer to be their lod and sovereign / and counseyler in every
battle / and crowned him and made him king / and would not suffer vortiger no
longer to regne / for cause of the alyaunce betwixt Engist and him. The Brytons
ordained a great host to drive out Engist and his company of the land / and
yaue him three bataylles. The first was in Kente there he was lord / the
second was at. Tetforde / and the third in a shyre a this half Colchestre in
a more. And in this battle them met. Catagien and. Horn. Engistes brother
/ so that each of thym slew other^ but for as much as the country was yeuen
long before to horn through vortiger tho ^e spowsed his cosyn / there he made a
fair castle that is called Horn castle after his own name. And vortiger was
so anoyed for his brothers death / that anon he let fell down the castle to
the ground. And after he ne left night ne day till he had driven out. Engist
and his people of the land. And then^e Ronowen his daughter made sorrow ynogh.
And quen^ely spoke to them that were next the king vortimer and pryuyest with
him. And so much she gave him of gifts / that he was enpoysoned and deyed at
London the fourth year of his regne and there he lies

How the. Brytons chose an other time Vortiger to be their king / and. Engist
came in to this land / and how they fought togyders.
AFter vortimers death: the Brytons by their common asse^t eft sons made
vortiger their king upon this covenant: that he should never after suffer.
Engist ne none of his eft sons to come i^ to this land And wha^ all this was
done. Ronowen the queen pryuely sent by letter to. Engist that she had en.
poisoned vortimer: and that vortiger her lord bare again ye crown and reigned.
And that he should come again in to this land well arrayed with much people for
to avenge him upon the Brytons and for to win this land again. And when
Engist herd these tidings / he made great Joy. And appareylled him hastily
with.xv. thousand men / yt were deughty in every battle / and came in to this
land And when vortyger herd tell that. Engyst was come again with a great
power in to this land / he assembled his. Brytons / and tho went against Engyst
for to give him Battle and his folk. But Engist dradde him sore of the
Brytons for they had driven him before and discomfyted him with strength.
wherefore this Engist prayed him for a love day / and said he was not comen in
to this land for to fight / but for to have his land again if he might accord
with the. Brytons / and of them to have love and grace The king Vortiger
through counseyll of his Brytons granted him a love day. And thus it was
ordained through the Brytons / yt the same day should be holden fast beside
Salysbury upon a hylle. And Engyst should come thither with four hordred
kdnghtes without moo And the king with as many of the wysest men of his londe^
And at that day the king came with his counsel as it was ordained / but
Engist had warned his knights pryuely / and then conmaunded that every one of
them should put a long knyf in his hose. And when he said Fair syres now is
time to speak of love and peace every man Anon should draw out his kynue and
slay a Bryton. And so they slew. a M.lxi. knights / and with much sorrow
many of them escaped. And the king vortyger there himself tho was taken / and
ladde to Thongcastell and put in prison. And some of Engystes men would that
the king had be burnt all quycke And vortiger tho for to have his life /
granted them as much as they would are / and yaue up all the land towns /
castelles / cytees / and borughs to Engist and to his folk. And all the
Brytons fled these in to waiys / and there they held them still. And Engyst
went thorugh the land and seized all the land / with fraunchyles And in
every place let cast a down chyrches and houses of Relygyon / And wasted and
destroyed crystendome thrughout all this land And let ^aunge ye nam of this
land called brytayne: that no man of his were so hardy after that time to
call this lord Brytayne: but call Engist land. And then ne he departed all
the land to his men: and there made.vii. kings for to strength the land that
the Brytons should never after come therem. The first kingdom was Kent: there
that Engist himself reigned: and was lord and master over al ye other. The
other king had Southsex yt now is called chychestre The thyrdet king had
westsex. The fourth had Eestsex. The fyfth had Estangill: yt now is called
Northfolke Southfolke. Merchemeryk: that is to say therldome of Nycholl. The
sixth had Leycheter shyre. Northampton shyre. Herforde: and Huntyngdon. The
seventh had Ox enforde. Glouchestre. wynchestre. were wykeand Derbyshyre.

How that Vortyger went in to walys and began there castle yt would not
stand with out mortar tempred with blood.
AS Engist had departed all the land in this manner between his men: and in
lyuerde vortyger out of prison and suffered him freely to go whyther that he
would. And he took his way and went in to walys there that his Brytons
dwelled: for as much as ye land was strong and wicked to win. And Engyst
^neuer came therene never knew it before that land. Vortiger held him there
with his Bratons / and axed counseyll what him was best to do. And they yaue
him counseyll to make a strong castle that him might himself there in keep
and defend if need were. Ma^e sons in haste tho were fette / and began to
work upon ye hylle of Breigh / but certes thus it befell that all the work
that the masons made a day down it fell the night / and they wyste not what
it might be. There of the king was sore anoyed of that chance and wyste not
what to do. werfore he let send after the wysest clerks and also learned men
than were thorugh out walys that might be foude / for they should tell wherefore
ye fou^dament so failed under the work / and they should him tell what was
best for to do. And when these wise men long time had studied they said to
the king / that he should do seek a child borne of a woman that never had
with man to do And that child should be slain / and tempred with his blood
the mortar of the work. And so should the work ever endure withouten end.

How the king let seek. Merlyn thorugh out all walys / for to speak with him.
AS the king herd this he commanded his messagers anon to go through out
walys to seek that child if they might him find / and that they should him
bring forth with them unto him. And in record and in witness of this king
he had take them his letters that they ne were distroubled of no* man ne
let. And tho the messengers went thens / and spedde so fast that they came
in to a town that was called Carmardyne / and as they passed for the their
way they found two chyldern of.xxiiii^ year of aege thydynge together with
hasty words. And one of them said to that other Donebat said he ye do all
wrong to chyde or strive with me for ye have no wit ne no reason as I have.
Certes merlyn said he / of your wit ne your reason. I make no force. For men
tell comynly that ye have no thing of god all mighty sith ye had never fader
/ But every man knows who was your mother. The messengers of the king
vortiger when they herd the strive betwixt the two gromes they axed of them
that stood beside them whens that^ Marlyn was borne / and also whom him
nourysshed. And the folk them told / that a great gentle woman him bare in.
Carmadyne that was called Adhanr But never might noth man wit who was his
fader. when the kings messengers herd these tidings they went anon to him
that was wardeyne of the town and told him the kings will and showed him his
leter wherefore they were come thither.

Merlyn and his mother were fetched before the wardeyne of the town. And he
commanded them that they should go to the king as it was ordained by his
messagers. Merlyn and his mother went thens and came unto ye king and there
they were received with much honor. And the king axed of that lady if ye
child were her sone and whom him be gate. The lady answered full tenderly
weeping and said. She never had company of worldly man. But sir said she As
I was a young maiden in my faders chamber / and other of great lygnage were in
my company / that oftentimes went to place and solace. I belefte alone in my
chamber / would not goo ^orthe for bernnynge of the son. And on^ time there
came a fair bacheler and entered in my chamber there that I was alone. But how
he came in to me / and where. I wist it never \ ne yet know I not. For the
doors were fast barred and with me he did game of love For I ne had might ne
power / him to defen- from me. And often he came unto me in ye foresaid manner /
so that he begat this child. But never might I wit what he was.

Of the answer of Merlyn wherefore the king axed why his castle might not
stand that he had begone ne prove.
SO when Merlyn had herd all that his mother had said. He spoke to the
king in this manner. Sire how I was begoten axe ye no more For it be falls
not to you ne to none other to wit. But tell me the cause wherefore I am to
you brought and wherefore ye have sent after me. Truly said the king / my wise
couseyllers have done me to understood / yt ye mortar of a work that I have
begone / behouety to be thempred with your blood / or the foundament shall
fail for ever more. Sir said Merlyn. will ye slay me for my blood to tempre
with your mortar. ye said the king / or else my castle shall never stand as
my cou^seyllers do me to understand Tho- answered Merlyn to the king. Sir he
said he said / let them come before me those wise cou^seylles and I woll preu
they say not well ne truly. And when ye wise men were comen. Merlyn axed if
his blod were ye cause to make this work to sto^de and endure. All tho wise
men were abashed and could not answer. Merlyn tho said to the king. Sir I
shall tell you ye cause wherefore your work thus fails and may no^ stand.
There is under the mountain there yt ye have builded your toure a great ponde
of water and i^ ye botome of ye ponde under ye water there ben two dragons /
and ye one is white and ye other reed / ye fight togyd against your work do ye
mine deep eyll your men come to ye pond / and cause your men to take a way ye
water all out / and then ye shall see ye dragans as I have you told ye
together fight against your work and this is the cause wherefore your fou^dament
fails The king anon let dygge under that men came to the ponde / And let
do a way the water / and there they found two dragons as Merlyn had told
that egerly fought together The white dragon egerly assailed the reed and
lyadde on him so strongely that he might not endure / but withdrewe him and
rested in the same cave. And wha^ he had a while rested him / he went before
and assailed the reed dragon angerly / and held him so sore yt he might not
ayenste him endure / but withdrewe him and rested And after came again ye white
dragon and strongly fought with the reed dragon. and bote him evil and
overcame. that he fled from thens and no more came again.

Of the sygnycacyon of those two dragons that were in the botome of the ponde
that fought together
THis king vortyger and his men that saw this battle had great meruaysle and
prayed Merlyn to tell him what it might betoken. Sir quod Merlyn I shall tell
you. The reed dragon betokens yourselfe / and the white betokens the folk
of Saxon that first ye took and held in your land that fight against you /
and you have driven and enchaced. But Brytons of ynure lygnage overcame them
and drove them a way And sythen at ye coming again of the Saxons they
recovered this land and held it for ever more. And drove out the Brytons and
did with this land all they will / and destroyed cryste^dom through out this
land. ye had first great Joy with their coming / But now yt is turned to
you great damage and sorrow. For tho brethern of Constance that was king the
which ye let slay shall come before a qui^zeme passed with a great power from
little Brytayne / and shall avenge the death of their brother. And they shall
brenne you first with sorrow / and after they shall slay a great part of
Saxons / and shall drive out all the remenau^t of the land. And therefore abide
ye here no longer to make castle nor other work. But anon goo else where
your lives all for to save. To god I you betake / truth I have said to you
of things that shall befalle. And understand ye well that Aurilambros
shall be king But he shall be enpoysoned / and little time shall he regne

Of king Aurilambros how that he pursued vortiger and Engist and how they
deyed.
MErlyn and his mother departed from the king / and turned again to
Carmardyn. And soon after tidings came to ye Brytons that Aurilambros and
vter his brother were arrived at Totnesse with a great host / And anon the
Brytons assembled the^ and went to receive Aurylambros and Vter with great
noblesse. And had them unto London / and crowned Aurylambros and made him king
/ and did unto him homage. And anon he axed where. Vortyger that was king
might be found / for he would be avenged on his brothers death / and after he
would war upon paynems. And they told him that Vortyger was in walys / and
so they ladde him thither ward. Vortiger wyste well that tho brethern came
him to conquer / And fled thens in to a castle that was called. Gerneth
that stood upon an hight mountain / and there him held. Aurilambros and Vter
his brother and their folk had besyeged the castle full long time / for the
cagell was strong and well arrayed. So at the last they casted wild fire and
burnt howses and men and all their array: and as much as was within the
castle. So that Vortiger was burnt among all other: and so he deyde with
much sorrow. Tho was Engist in Kente and reigned there: ane herd this
tidings: and anon fled and would have gone in to Scotlonde for to have had
socoure. But Aurilambros and his men met with him in the north country and
yane him batayl. And Engist and his men defended whiles that they might. But
he and his folk were discomfyted and slain And Octa his sone fled unto
york. And Aurilambros him followed egerly. And. Octa a little while withstode
him: But after ward he put him to his mercy. And aurilambros received him: and
to him and to his men gaafthe country of Galewaye in. Scotlonde: and there
they dwelled. The king aurilambros went thorugh out the land: and put away
the name of. England: that. Engist after his name had called it befoere. Tho
let he it call again great. Brytayne: and let make again cherches: houses of
religyon: castelles: cytees and broughs. And towones that the. Saxons had
destroyed. And came to London: and let make the walls of the cite: which
Engist and his folk had castedowne. The Brytons ladde him unto the mount of.
Ambrian that sometime was an house of relygyon: that tho was destroyed thrughe
the paynems:

whereof a knight that was called Ambri sometime was founder of that house. And
therefore the same hylle was called the mount of. Ambrian. And after it was
called. Ambresbury. And shall be so for euermore^.

How Aurilambros did redress the land of great Brytayne / that which was
destroyed thorugh the Saxons before said.
HOw the king Aurilambros let amend and redress the house of Ambresbury /
and there in put monks. But now there ben Nonnes a little fro the place that
was called Salysbury / are that the Saxons slew the Brytons / where Engist and
they should have made a laue day. In the which time were slain a thousand
knights.lxi. through treason of Engist^ The king thereof had great pity and
thought to make in mind of them a monument of stone that might endure to the
worlds end. And of this thing they took there counseyll what thereof was best
for to do. Tho spoke to the king the bishop of London that was called
Ternekyn that he should require after. Merlyn. For he could best tell how this
thing might best be made. And merlyn after was sought and found and came to
the king. And the king told him his will of the monumente that he would have
made. Merlyn answered to the king and said. There ben great stones in Irlonde
and long upon the hylle of Kyan that men called. Gyauntes karoll. And if they
were in this place as they ben there / they would endure for eurer more in
remembrance of those knights that here be entyred. Per may foy said the king
as hard stone ben in my land as in Irlonde.

Soth said Merlyn. But in all your land ben none such. For gau^tes set
them for great good of themself. For at every time that they were wound or
in any manner hurt / they wysshe the stones with hot water / And then they
wysshe them there with and anon they were hoole.

How the Brytons went for to seek the great stones in Irlonde.
AS soon as the. Brytons had herd of this thing / they yede and swore among
them they would go seek those stones. And took with them. Vter the kings
brother to be thyef capytayne and.v. thousand men / and Merlyn counseled them
for to go unto Irlonde and so thye did / And when the king of Irlonde that
was culled Guillomer herd tell strangers were arrived in his land / he
assembled a great power and fought against them But he and his folk were
dyscomfyted. The Brytons went before till they came to the mount of Kyan / and
clymmed up unto the mount. But when they saw the stones and the manner how
they stood / they had great meruaylle and said between themself / that no man
should them remeue for no strength ne engyne so great they were and so
long. But. Merlyn through his craft he remeued them and brought them in to
their ships and came again in to this land. And Merlyn set the stones there
that the king would have them. And set them in the same manner that they
stood in Irlonde / and when ye king saw that it was made he thanked Merlyn /
And rychely him rewarded at his own will. And that place let call Stonhenge
for ever more.

How Passent that was Vortigers sone and the king Guillomer came in to this
land / and how a traitor that was called Cappa enpoysoned ye king
Aurilambros.
ANd men shall understand that Passent that was Vortigers sone lived ye same
time / and came in to this land with a great power / and arrived in the north
country and would be aue^ged of his faders death Vortiger and strongely trusted
upon the company that he had brought with him out of the land of Germayne /
and had conquered all the North country unto york. And when king Aurilambros
herd this he assemled a great power of Brytons and went for to fight with
passe^t and he dyscomfyted Passent and all his people. but Passent escaped thens
with some of his men / and fled thens in to Irlonde and come to king
Guillomer and prayed him of help and socour. The king granted him with good
will and said / that he would help him / upon that covenant that I my self
must go with you with all my power in to brytayne. And I would me aduenge upon
the Broytons the rather for they came in to my land and took the stones with
strength that is called Gyauntes karoll The king Guillomer let ordeyne his
ships and went to the sea with.xv. thousa^de men and arrived in walys and
began to rob / and much sorrow he did. It befell so that king Aurilambros
lay syke at wynchestre / and might not help him self. So that he sent in
his name Vter his brother with a power to help walys. And thither ward he
went as much as he might. The king of Irlonde and Passente herd tell that
Aurilambros was syke / and to him there came a Sarrasyn that was called Cappa
and said. Sire dwell ye here all in peace with your host and I behyght you
thorugh my quayntesye ye I shall slay the king Aurilambros that is syke.
Then said Passent / if ye do so I shall you rychely auaunce. The traitor
Cappa put upon him an habyte of relygyon / and let shave him a broad crown
and came unto the kings court / and said that he would help^ the king of
his malady. Tho said the traitor Cappa unto the king. Sir be of good comfort.
For I shall give you such a medicyne that ye shall sweet ano^e right and
list to sleep and have good rest. And the traitor yaaf him such poison to
sleep anon right / and deyed in his slepynge. And ye traitor said yt he
would go out to the field till he were awaked / and so escaped he away. For no
man had to him suspeccyon / for by cause of his habyte that he was clothed i^ /
and also for his broad shaven crown. But when the kings men wyste that he was
deed / they became wonder sorry / and fast sought the traytoure / but they
might not find hym^ For ye Cappa turned again unto the host frem whes yt he
came.

when Aurilambbros deyed a sterre in the morn was seen with a clear light /
and at the bought of the beeme was seen the heed of an horrible dragon
SO when the king Aurilambros was deed and enpoysoned at winchestre. On the
morn after he was deed about the time of Pryme there was seen a sterre great
and clear and the beeme of that sterre was brygheter tha^ ye son. And at the
bought of ye beeme apperyd a dragons heed / and out of his mouth came two huge
lyghtes / that were as bright as any fire brennynge. and that one beeme to
ward France and straight over the sea thither ward. And out of that beeme
came.vii. beemes full clear and long as it were the light fire. This ^^erre
was seen of many a man / But none of them wyste what it be tokened. Vter that
was the kings brother / that was in walys with his host of Brytons / saw
that sterre and the great light that it yaue / they wondered there of greatly what
it might betoken. And let call Merlyn and prayed him for to tell what yt it
myhght betoken.

Of the betokenynge of the sterre.
MErlyn saw ye sterre / and beheld yt a long time. And sythen he quoke and
wept tenderly. And sayde^ Alas alas that so noble a king and worthy is deed
And I do iou to vndersta^nde that Aurilambros your brotherds poisoned / and
that I see well in this sterre. And yourselfe is betokened the heed of the
dragon that is seen at the bought of the beeme that is your self that shall be
king and regne. And by the beeme that stondeth to ward the Eest is
understand that ye shall get a sone that shall conquer all France / and all
the lands that belongs to the crown of France / that shall be a wrothyer
king and of more honor than ever were any of his auncetours. And by the
beeme that stretched toward Irlonde is betokened that ye shall get a
daughter that shall be queen of Irlonde. And the seven beemes betoken that ye
shall have.vii. sons. And every one of them shall be king / and regne with
much honor. And abide ye no longer here / but goo and give battle to your
enmyes / and fight with them booldely for ye shall overcome them and have the
victory. Vter thanked hertely Merlyn and took his men and went to ward his
enmyes / and they fought together mortally / and so he dyscomfyted his enmyes
and them destroyed. And him self slew Passe^t that was vortigers sone And his
Brytons slew Guillomer that was king of Irlonde and all his men. And Vter
anon after that battle took his way to ward wynchestre / for to do entyere
Aurilambros king that was his brother. But tho was the body borne unto.
Stonhenge with much honor / that he had done make in remembrance of the
Brytons that there were slain through treason of Engist / that same day that
they should have been accorded. And in the same place they entyered. Aurelambros
the second year of his regne with all ye worship ye might belong to such a
king. On whoos soul god have mercy. Amen.

Of Vter Pendragon / and therefore he was called so ye shall here. And how he
was overtake with the love of Igreyne that was the Earl of Cornewaylles wife.
AFter the death of. Aurilambros. Vter his brother was crowned and reigned well
and worthily. And in remembrance of the dragon that he was lykened to / He
let make two dragons through counsel of his. Brytons And made that one for to
be borne before him wha^ he went in to battle / and ye other for to abide at
wynchestre in the bishop church. And for that cause he was called ever after
vter Pendragon. And Octa that was Engistes sone commended vter but little yt
was made new king. And ayenste him began to meue war. And ordained a great
power of his fre^des and of his kynne / and of. Ossa his brother \ and had
taken all the land from Humbre unto york / But those of york held strongely
against them / and would not suffer them to come in to the cytee / neither to
yield the cytee to them. And he besyeged the town anon right and yaue thereto
a strong assawte. But they of the cite them kept well and strongely. And when
vter herd thereof / he came thither with a great strong power for to help and
rescowe ye town and put a way the syege / and yaue a strong battle. And Octa
and his company them defended as well as they might. But at ye last they were
dysco^fyted and the most party of the^ slain. And. Octa and. Ossa were taken
and put in prison at London. And vter hymfelf dwelled a while at york / and
after he went to London. And at the Eester after he would vere crown and hold
a solemn feast. And let somone all his Earl and Barons / that they should
come to that feast. And all those that had wives should bring them also to
that feast. And all the seygnoury came at the kings commandment as they
were commanded. The feast was rychely arrayed and holden. And all worthily
set to meet after that they were of astate. So that the^ Earl Gorloys of
Cornewaylle and. Igreyne his wife sat next unto the king. And when the king
saw the fayrnesse of that lady and the beauty that she had. He was anon
rauysshed for her beauty and often he made to her nyce countenance in lokynge
and laughing. So at the last the Earl perceived the preuy lokynge and
laughing and the love between them. And roso up from the table in wrath / and
took his wife and called to him his knights and went thens wrath / without
taking leave of ye king. The king anon sent after him that he should come
again and goo not thens in dyspyte of him. And the earl would not come again
in no manner of wise. wherefore the king was wroth / and in wrath him defied
as his deedly enmye. And the earl went thens in to Cornewaylle with his wife
in the castle of Tyntagyll. And the king let ordeyne a great host and came
in to Cornewaylle / for to destroy the earl if that he might. But he had
put him in such a castle that was strong and well arrayed called. Tyntagyll
/ and wollde not yield him to the king. And the king anon besyeged the
called / and there dwelled.xv. days that never might speed / and ever he
thought upon Igreyne / and upon her laid so much love / That he wyste not
what to do. So at the last he called to him a knight that was called vlfin
that was preuy with him and told him all his counseyll / and axed him wha^ was
best for to done Sir said he / send after Merlyn anon / for he came tell
you the best counseyll of any man living Merlyn anon was sent after and
came to the king. And the king told him all his counseyll and his will. Sir
said Merlyn. I shall do so much through craft that I can / that I shall make
you come to night (...) the castle of. Tyntagyll / and shall have all yo^ will
of that lady.

How vter begat on Igreyne / that ^as the Earls wife of Cornewaylle Arthur.
MErlyn through craft yt he co^ (...) the kings figure in^ (...) of the Earl /
and Vlfin Garlois (...) in to the figure of Iorda^ (...) earls chambrelayne /
so that ec^ (...) transfygured in to others lyke^ (...) Merlyn had so done /
he said (...) Sir said he / now ye may goo^ (...) castle of Tyntagyll and axe
ene^ (...) your will. The king took pry^ (...) to govern and led to a knight
that he much loved / and took his way toward the castle / and with him
took Vlfin his Chambrelayne and Merlyn / and when they came thither the porter
demyd it had been his own lord. And when time came for to go to bed / the
king went to bed with Igreyne the earls wife and did with her all his will.
And begat upon her a sone that was called Arthur. And upon the more we the
king took his leave of the lady and went again to his host. And the same
night that the king lay by Igreyne in bed that was the earls wife the
kings men gaaf a great assawte unto the castle. And the earl and his men
manly them defended. But at the last it befell so / that in the same assawte
the earl him self was slain and the castle taken. And the king anon turned
again to Tyntagill and spowsed I greyne with much honor and made her queen
And soon after time came that she should be lyuered and bare a child a son
yt was called Arthur. and after gate on her a daughter that was called Amya* /
And when she came to aege / a noble. Baron that was lord of Lions weded her.
when Vter long time had reigned / there came upon him a great sykenesse as it
were a sorrow. And in ye mean time those that had to keep Octa yt was Engistes
sone and Ossa his brother / that then^e were in prison / they let them go for
great yeftes that they them yaue and went with the^. And when tho two brethern
were escaped and were in to their own country again / Then they ordeynede
them a great power of folk and began for to war again upon the king.

there that saint. Albon was martred. And after was the cytee destroyed with
paynems through warre^ and thither they had sent. Octauian and. Ossa and there
people. And entered in to the town / and let make sure ye yates / and there
they held them. And the king came and them besyeged / and made a strong
assawte / but the that were within manly them deffended / The king let
ordeyne his gunnes and his engynes for to break the walls / and the walls
were so strong that no man might them mysdo. Octa and his people had great
despyte / that a king lyenge in a letere had the ym besyeged. And they took
counseyll among them for to stand up in the morrow erly and come out and give
battle to the king / and so they did. And in that battle were both Octa
and Ossa slain / and all the other ye escaped a live fled in to Scotlonde /
and made Colegyn their chyeftayne. and the Saxons yt were a live and escaped
fro the battle / brougth again a great strength and among the^ they said that
if king Vt were deed they should well conquer the land and thought to
enpoysen the king / and ordained men for to do this deed / and yaue them of
yef it is great plente this thing to do. And they ordained them thyderwarde
there that ye king was dwelling / and clothed them in poor wede the better
all for to speed their falls purpose But nevertheless all their falsenes and
subtylte they might never come to nygh ye king. But so at the last they aspyed
that the king drank no other lycoure but only water of a clear well tha^ was
nyghe beside and ye falls traitors upon a day preuely went to the well and
put therein poison / so that all the water was enpoysoned. And anon after as
the king had drunk of that water / he began to swelle / and soon after he
deyed: and as many as drank of that water deyed also. And anon as this was
aspyed folk of the town let stop the well of evermore. when ye king was
deed his folk bare him to Stonhenge with great solempnyte of bishops and
barons that were there him to burye beside Aurilambros his bro^her. And after
turned again tho euerychone and sent after his sone: and they made him king of
the land with much reverence after his faders death: the.xvii. year of his
regne.

How king Arthur that was the sone of Vter was crowned after his faders death:
and how he drove Colegryn and the Saxons and Cheldri^ of A^mayne out of this
land
As Arthur was made king of the land / he was but young of aege of.xv. year /
but he was fair and bold and doughty of body. And to meke folk he was good
and curteys / and large of spendinge / and made him well beloved among them
there that yt was need / and when he began to regne heswore truly that ye.
Saxons never should have rest ne peace till that he had driven them out of ^he
land. And assembled a great host and fought with Colegryn the which after
ye time that Octa was deed the Saxons mayntened. And this Colegryn was
dyscomfyted and fled unto york and took the town / and there him held.
And the king besyeged him there but he might no thing speed for the cite was
so strong. And they within the town kept the cite well and orpedly. And in the
mean time Colegryn let the town to Bladulf and f^ledde himself to Cheldryk
yt was king of almayne / for to have of him socour. And the king assembled a
grette power and came and arrived in Scotlonde with.xv. hundred ships. And
wha^ Arthur wist of these tidings that he had not power and strength enough to
fight against. Cheldrik / he let be the syege and went to London / and sent
anon his letters to ye king of little Brytayne that wys called Howell his
neuewe his systers sone / that he should come to him with all the power that he
might. And he assembled a great host and arrived at Southampton. And when
king Arthur it wist he was glad enough and went ayenste them / and them
received with much honor. So that those two hosts met and assembled them
/ and took their way even unto. Nycholl that Cheldryk had besyeged / But it
was not taken. And they came upon cheldrik and his people or they wist where
that they were / and them egerly assaylled. The king Cheldrik and his men
defended him manly by their power. But king Arthur and his men slew so many
Saxons / hat never was seen such slaughter / and Cheldrik and his men that
were left alive fled a way. And king Arthur them pursewed and drove them
out in to a wood tha they might no ferder pass. Cheldrik and his me^ saw
well that they were brought in to much disease / and them yielded to king
Arthur in this manner wys. That he should take their horses their armor / and
all that they had / and they must only go on foot in to their ships. And so
they would goo home in to their own land / and never come again in to this
land. And upon assurance of this thing they yaue him good hostages. And
Arthur by counseyll of his men granted this thing: and received ye hostages:
and thereupon yt other went to their ships. And when they were in ye high
see the wynnde changed as the devil it would: and they turned their navy and
came again in to this land and arrived at Totnesse: and went out of the ships
and took the land: and clean robbed it: and much people slew: and took all
the armor that they might find. And so they went forth till they came
unto Bathe. But the men of the town shytte fast their yates / and would not
suffer them to come wy thinthe towne^ And they deffended the^ well and orpedly
against them

How Arthur yaue bataylle unto the Saxons when they came again in to this
land: and had besyeged the town of Bathe and them overcame.
Anon as. Artur herd this tidings he let hang ye hostages / and le^t
Howell of Brytayne his neuewe / for to keep the march to ward Scotlonde with
half his people and himself went to help and rescowe the town of. Bathe.
when he ^^me thither he yaue a strong battle to Cheldrik and slew almoost all
the people that he had^ For no man might him wythstonde ne endure under ye
stroke of his sword. And there both were slain Colegryn and Bladulf his
brother / and Cheldryk fled thens and would have gone to his ships But when
Arthur it wist / he took.x. thousand knights to Cador yt was earl of Corn
waylle for to let and stop his coming. And Arthur himself went toward
the march of Scotlonde. For messengers told him that ye Scotts had besyeged
Howell of. Brytoyne there that lay syke / and therefore he hasted him thither
ward. And Cador purse wed after Cheldryk / and took him er he might come to
his ships and slew Cheldrik and his people. And when Cador had done this
vyage / he hasted him again to ward. Arthur as fast as he might / and found
him in Scotlonde there that he had rescowed Howel of Brytayn but ye Scotts
were far wythyn Nounref / and there they held them a while. But Arthur them

Isles and great plente of birds / and great plente of Egles that were wont to
cry and fight togyders / and make great noise when folk came to rob that
land / and warn as much as they might / and so they did. For the Scotts
were to great rauenours / that they took all that they might find in the
land of Lymoygne without any sparynge / and there with charged again the folk

How king Arthur axed of Merlyn ye adventures of.vi. of the last kings that
were to regne in England / and how ye land should end
Sir said Merlyn. In the year of the Incarnacyon Ihesu Christ.M^CC.xv. shall
come a lamb out of wynchestre / shall have a white tongue and true lyppes / and
he shall have written in his heart holiness. This lamb shall make many gods
houses / and he shall have peace the most part of his life. And he shall make
one of the fairest places of ye wor^de / that in his time shall not fully ^e
made an end of. And in the end of his life wulf of a strange land shall do
him much harm and sorrow through war. But at the end the lamb shall be
master through help of a reed fox / that shall come out of the North west /
and him shall overcome / and the wulf shall dey^ in water. And after that time
the lamb shall live no while / but he shall deye. His heed shall be in a
strange land. And the land shall be without a governor a little time

ANd after this shall come a dragon meddled with mercy and also with woodnesse
And that shall have aberde as a got that shall give in England a shade we /
and shall kept the land fro cold and hete / and his own foo^ shall be set
in wyke and that other in London. And he shall enbrace Inhabitaunces. And he
shall open his mouth to ward walys. And the trembling of the hydour of his
mouth / his ^eres shall stretche to ward many habytacyons and countrees. And
his breath shall be full sweet in strange land. And in his time shall the
ryuers run blood and with brain. And he shall make i^ places of his land
walls that shall do much harm unto his seed after his time. And then shall
there come a people out of the North west during his regne that shall be ladde
thrughout a wicked hare / that the dragon shall do crown king / that
afterward shall flee over the sea with out coming again for dread of the
dragon. And in that time the son shall be as reed as an blood that see
thorughout all the world / that shall betoken great pestylence and death of
folk / thorugh dynt of sword. And that people shall be faderles / till the
time that the dragon deye through an hare: that shall meue against him war unto
the end of his life: that shall not fully be ended in his time This dragon
shall be hold in his time the best body of the world. and he shall deye
beside the marches of a strange land: and the land shall dwell faderles
without a good governor: and men shall weep for his death: from the isle of.
Shepey to the haven of Marcyll. wherefore Alas alas shall be their song of
faderles folk: that shall over live in his land destroyed.

ANd after this dragon shall come a got out of. Kar that shall have horns and
a berde of silver / and there shall come out of his nosethryll a dompe that
shall betoken hungre and sorrow and great death of the people. And much of his
land in the beginning of his regne shall be wasted. This got shall go over
unto France: and shall open the flower of his life and death. In his time there
shall arise an E^^e in Corn way^e that shall have feathers of go^e / that of
pride ^ha^ be without pere of the land. And he shall despy^e lords of blood.
And a^^er he shall flee shamefully by a beer at G^uer^e^h / and after shall be
made brydges of men upon the costs of the ^ee and stones shall fall from
castelles / and many other towns shall be made plain. In his time shall seem
that the beer shall brenne / and a battle shall be done upon the arms of the sea in a field ordained as a sheld And at that batayl shall deye many white
heedes / wherefore this battle shall be called the white battle. And the
foresaid beer shall do this got much harm / and it shall come out of the
South west and of his blood. Then shall the go^e lose much / and of his
land / till that the time that frenshyp shall him overcome. And then shall
he close him in a lions skin / and then shall he win that he had before
lost and more thereto. For a people shall come out of the North west yt shall
make the got so sore aferde thet he shall be in great perplexite. And he shall
aduenge him on his enmyes through counsel of two owls that first shall be in
peril for to be undone. But the old owl shall wend away a certain time /
and after he shall come again in to this land. These two owls shall do great
harm to many one / and so they shall counseyll the got to arere war against
the foresaid beer. And at ye last the go^e and the owls shall come at Burton
upon Trent / and shall go over / and for dread the beer shall ^^ee and a
swanne with him fro his company to Burton ward the north and there they shall
be with an hard shoure. And then shall the swanne be take and slain wi^h
sorrow and the beer taken heeded al there next his ^est / that shall stand upon
broken bridge / on whom the son shall cast his beemes. And many shall him
seek for virtue that from him shall come. In ye same shall deye for sorrow ^
^are ap^ple of his land / so that lands shall be upon him ye more bo^der
after ward. And those two owls shall do much sorrow to the foresaid flower
of life / and her shall led in to dystrestre / so that shall pass over the sea
into France / for to make peace between the got and ye flouredelyse / and
there she shall dwell till a time that her sede shall come and set^e her: ^
they shall be still till a time: that they shall them clothe with grache. And
they shall fethe the owls and shall put them to dyspytous death. And after
shall this got be brought to disease and great Anguysshe: and in sorrow he
shall live all his life

AFter this got shall come out of wyndesore a boore: that shall have an heed
o^ a white lynons heart: and pyteous lokynge His vysage shall be rest to like
men. His breeste shall be staunchynge of thyrste to tho that be thrysty: His
word shall be gospel. his herynge shall be meke as a lambe^ In the first
year of his regne he shall have great pain to Iustefye the^ that been untrue.
And in his time shall his land be multeplyed with alyauntes. And this boore
thorugh fyresnesse of his heart that he shall have: shall make wulues to become
lambs. and he shall be called thorugh out of ye world Boore of holiness /
fyers^esse of noblynesse and of meekness. And he shall mesurably all that he
shall do unto the brough of Jerusalem. And he shall whette his teeth upon the
yates of Pards: and upon four lands. Spain shall tremble for dread. Gascoyne
shall sweet. In France he shall put his wynge. His great tail shall rest in
England softly. Almayne shall quake for dread of him. This boore shall give
bantelles to two towns of England: and shall make the River run with blood
and brain. And he shall make many meadows reed: and he shall get as much
as his auncetours did. And er that he dyed / he shall bear three crowns / and
he shall put a land in great subiecyon / And after it shall be releued / but
not in his time. This boore after he is deed for his doughtynesse / shall be
entyred at Coleyne. And his lord shall be fulfilled of all good.

AFter this boore shall come a lamb: yt shall have f^et of leed: and an heed
of brass: and heart of loppe a swynes skin. And an hard. And in his time
his land shall be in peace: the first year of his regne he shall do make a
cytee that all the world shall speak there of. This lamb shall lose in his
time a great part of his land through an hydeous wulfe: but he shall recover
it: and give a lordshyp to an Egle of his land and this egle shall well
govern it till the time that pride shall him overcome. Alas the sorwe: For he
shall deye of his brothers sword. And after shall the land fall to the
foresaid lamb: that shall govern the land in peace all his lives time. And
after he shall deye / and the land be fulfilled of all manner of good.

AFter this lamb shall come a mold warpe / cursyd of gods mouth / a caytyf /

vengeance shall fall upon him for syn^e. In the first year of his regne he
shall have of all good great plente in his land and to ward him also / And in
his land he shall have great praysyge / till the time that he shall surffre his
people live in to much pride without chastysynge / wherefore god will be wrothe^
Then shall arise up a dragon of the North / that shall be full fyerse / and
shall meue war against the foresaid mold warpe / and shall give him battle upon
a stone. This dragon shall gadre again in to his company a wulfe / that shall

tremble the land that shall becalled England as an aspen leyf / And in that
time shall castelles be felled down upon Tamyse. And ye shall seem that Seuerne

How Arthur overcame Guillomer that was king of Irlonde. And how the Scotts
became his men
THen^e when Guillomer that was king of Irlonde herd tydyges ye king Arthur
was entered at Glastenbury: he ordained agrete pewer of Irysshmen and came to
the sea with his Irysshe people; and so came in to Scotlonde over the sea and
arrived fast there by that king. Arthur was with his host: and a none as he
wist thereof: he went to ward him and yaue him bataylle and overcame him anon
right. And Guillomer fled with his me^ again in to Irlond. And when this was
done and dyscomfyted him Arthur turned him again there that he was: in to the
place there that he had left the Scotts and would have them all slain. But
the bysshopes: abbottes and other folk of ye country and ladies open heeded
came before king. Arthur and cried him mercy and said. Sire gentle king and
mighty: have mercy and pity upon us. And as yourself be of the right law to
hold and mayntene Crystendome. For full great dyshoudur yt should be to slay
him that byleueth in almighty god as ye do. And for gods love have mercy and
pity on us and suffer us. For we have had much sorrow and pain. For the
Saxons have many times passed through our land. But that is not enough to you:
for often times they have done us sorrow and disease For our castelles they
have taken and our beestes slain and eten: and much harm they have us done
And if ye would us now slay: it were none honor to a king to slay them that
cry him mercy. For enough ye have done to us and have us overcome. And for ye
love of god yt ye will suffer us for to live: and have mercy on christian people
yt believe in Christ as ye do. wha^ king. Arthur herd this sorrow: he had pity
of them and yaue them life and lymme without any more harm. And they fell down
to his feet and thanked him and became his lyege men: and he took of them
homage. And after ye king Arthur turned again with his host the came unto
york: and made there his bydynge during that vyage. And tho gave he al Logrys
to Aloth that had spowsed his sister and other gifts great plente^ And tho was
Gawen his cosyn but of youge ^ege. And to all his other men that him had served

How king Arthur spowsed Gu^nor that was Gu^nors cosyn Earl of Corn wayle /
and after he conquered of Guillomer all Irlonde.


ANd when Arthur had broughth is land in peace and rest and in good state /
and all was well in every country. Tho took and wedded a wife that was called
Gu^nor and made her queen / a fair lady and a gentle that Cador the Earl of
Corn wayle had nourysshed i^ his chamber that was his cosyn. But never they
had childern together. And nevertheless king Arthur loved her wonder well and
deyrly And anon as winter was passed / he let assemble a great host / and all
his Barons and said that he would goo in to. Irlonde for to conquer the land.
And he trayed not long that he passed over in to Irlone. And Guillomer the
king let assemble a great host and yaue bataylle to king Arthur / but
Guyllomer was dyscomfyted and yielded him ot ye king and became his man / and
to him did fewte and homage and of him held all that land fro that time for
ward. And after peaskynge. Arthur ferthermore and conquered But land and
Islonde / and took homage of the folk and of the land / and there
dwelled.xii. year in peace and reigned with Joy and myrthe. And there warred no
man ne woman upon him. And he became so curtys and large and honorable / that
the Emperors court of Rome / ne none other through out all the world was not
accounted to king Arthurs / that any man wist of / ne none so well praysed^
And therefore the best knights of all manner a lands came unto him there for
to dwell. And he them received with good will and reverence. And all the
knygehtes were so good that no man knew the werste. And therefore king Arthur
made a round table that when they should sytte at there meet / all should be
ylyke high and euenly served at the table that no^e of them should make auau^t
that one of them were higher thanne an other. And king Arthur had at that

Lotherins / and of all the lands a this half the mount Goryt: and of his
land of Brytayne and of the great Corn wayle: of walys and of Irlonde: and of

How king Arthur yede into France and conquered that land of. Froll yt was a
Romayne: and how he slew him.


Sith it befell that through counsel of his barons and lords: king Arthur
would conquer all France that tho was called Galle through Romans that tho
held ye land in their power and in their gouernnu^ce. And the Romans had
taken that land to a noble knyt and a worthy of body: that was called Froll.
And when he wist that Arthur came: he ordeoned an host of a great power and
fought with the king. And he and his folk were dyscomfyted and fled unto
Paris and entered the cite: and closed the yates and there held them. when
Arthur wist that Froll was gone to Paris he pursued after and came thither: and
him besyeged. But the cite was so strong and well arrayed / and tho that were
therein deffended them well and manly. King Arthur dwelled there more than
amonethe. And there was so much people in the cite that they dyspended all
their vytayle that they had within. and so great hungre became among them /
that they deyed wenderly thycke within the cite for ho^gre. And came unto Froll
and prayed him to be accorded with king. Arthur for to have peace and they
would yield them unto him and the cite also. Froll saw yt he might no longer
hold the town against their will \ and trusted gretely upon his owe strenth /
and sent to ye king Arthur that he should come fight with him body for body /
and so should they depart France between them two. King Arthur ano^e
granted yt. And would not that none of his people undertook the battle for
him. And upon the morn both came well arrayed without Paris there that they
should fight. and anon they smote togyders so fyersly and so well they fough on
both sides that no man demed the better of them / and so it befell ye Froll
yaue Arthur such a stroke yt he kneled to the ground would he nolde he / And
as Froll wounded king Arthur in the forhede yt the blood fell down by his
eyes and his face. Arthur anon sterre up hertely when he felt him hurt as a
man yt seemed almoost wood. And he took taburne his good sword / and drew it
upon high and yaaf Froll such astroke that thyr with he claue his head down
to the sholders so that his helm might not be his warraunt / and so he fell
down deed in the place. And then tho of the city made great sorrow for
Froll. And euerychone yielded them to king. Arthur and the town also and
became his men / and did to him homage and feaute. And he received them and
took of them goodly hostages. And king Arthur after that went forth with
his host and conquered Augien and Angyers. Gascoyne. Pehito. Nauerne and
Burgoyne. Berry. Lotherne Turyn and Peythers / and all the other lands of
France he conquered all holy. when he had conquered and taken by homages and
feautes / he turned again to Paris and there he dwelled long time / and
ordained peace long time over all ye country / and through al France. And wha^
peace was made over all through his noble knyghthode that he had / and also for
his own worthynes. And no man were he never so great a lord durst not meue
war against him another to arise for to make the land of France inquyete. And
in peace he dwelled there.ix. year / and did many great wonders / and repreued
many proud men and evil tyrau^tes them chastysed after their demerytes

How king Arthur auaunced all his men that had trauaylled in his service.
ANd after ward yt befell thus at Ester there that he held a feast at. Paras /
and rychely he began auau^ce his knights for ye service that they had him helped
in his conquest. He yaue to his steward that was called. Kay Augien and
Angoers. And he yaue to Bed were his. Butler. Normandye / that tho was called

Dorell his cosyn he yaue Bolayne. And to Richard his enewe he yaue Pountyf /
and to all other he yaue large lands and fees after they were of estate / And

came again in to Brytayne his own land. And after at wytsontyde sewynge by
counseyll of his Barons / he would be crowned king of Glomergon / and held a

arthur had hold before / but never none such / ne so solemn / and that
lasted.xv. days with much honor and myrthe. Of the letter yt was sent fro
Rome to pride to king Arthur

THe third day as king Arthur satte at his meet among his knights and
among them that satte at the feste / before the^ came in ^xii. men of age
rychely arrayed / and curteusly they salewed the king / and said they came fro
Rome sent as massengers fro the Emperor. And took him a letter that thus
much was to vndersta^d^ Gretely us maruaylleth arthur / that thou art ones so
hardy with thyn eyes in thy heed to make open war or contake against us of
rome / that own all the world to redeem / For thou haste never yet before
this time proved ne assayed the strength of the Romans / and therefore though
it shall in a little time. For Iulyus Cezar conquered all the land of Brytayne
/ aid took thereof truage / and our folk have it long I had / and now
through thy pride thou with hold it. wherefore we of Rome command the that
thou yt yield again / and yet haste thou more folly done that thou haste slain
Froll that was our baron of France with wrong. And therefore all the comens of
Rome warns the and command the upon life and lymme that thou in haste be at
Rome amends for to make of thy misdeeds that thou haste done. And it so be
that thou come not we shall pass the hill of Joy with stre^gthe / and we
shall the seek where ever thowe may be found / and thou shall not have a foot
of land of thyn own / yt we ne shall dystroye it / and afterward with thy
body we shall do al our will. when this letter was read and all men it herd
they were anoyed all yt were at ye solemn feste. And the Brytons would have
slain ye messengers / but the king would not suffer them and said / that ye
messengers should have no harm / and may by reason none deserve But commanded
them to be worshypfully served And after meet he took counsel of kings /
earls and barons / what answer he might give again to the messengers and they
cou^seylled him atones / that he should assemble a great power of al ye lo^des
of which he had lordeshyp and ma^ly avenge him upon the Emperor of the
despyte that he had se^de him such a letter and they swore by god and by all
his holy name that they should him pursewe and bren^e as much as they might
And said that they would never fail king Arthur / and rather to be deed. And
they let write a letter to send to the Emperor by the same messengers in
this manner of wyse^ Of the bold answer that king Arthur se^te to the
Emperor of Rome and to the Romans

Understands among you of Rome that I am king Arthur of Brytayne and freely
it hold and shall hold. And at Rome hastily I will be / not to give you
truage / but for to axe truage. For Constantyne that was Eleyns sone that was
Emperor of Rome and of all the honor that there to belongs. And Maximian
king conquered all France and Almayne / and mount Joy passed and conquered
all Lombardy. And these two were mine auncetours / and that they held and had.
I shall have thorught gods will.

Of the reverence that king Arthur did to the Emperors messengers.
ANd when this letter was made and ensealed / king Arthur to these messe^gers
and gave grette yeftes / and after that the messengers took their leave and
went thens / and came to the court of Rome again. And told the Emperor how
worthily they were received And also of such a ryall company that he had him
for to serve / and how he was more ryally served than the Emperor of Rome or
any other king living in all the world. And when the Emperor had ouersene
the letter / and had hard what was therein and saw yt Arthur would not be
ruled after him. He let assemble and ordeyne a great host for to destroy
king Arthur if that he might. And king Arthur as touching his power and
party / ordained his power or knights of the table round.

How king arthur faught with a gyau^t i^ spain yt was called Dinabus yt slew
Eleyne that was king Howels cosyn of little Brytayne.
King Arthur had not dwelled in that country but a little time / yt men him
told that there was come a great gyaunt in to Spain / and had rauysshed
fair. Eleyne that was cosyn unto. Howell of little Brytayne. And had brought
her upon an hylle that is called the mount of saint Bernarde. And there was no
man in that country so bold ne so hardy that durst fight with him / ne come
nigh the place there yt the gyaunt dwelled tha^ was called Dinabus. And much
sorrow he did in the country. when king Arthur heed this tidings / he
called to him Kay and Bedwere and commanded them to go pryuely and espy where
the gyaunt might be found. And they came to the ryuage there that men should
go to the mount / that was all enclosed a boute with water and yet is / and
ever shall be. And they saw a brennyge fire upon the hylle. And there was also
an other hylle nigh that / and there was upon that an other fire brynnyge. Kay
and Bed were came to the next hylle / and found a wydowe open heeded sitting
besides a tomb sore weeping / and great sorrow made. and often she said Eleyne
eleyne. And Kay and Bed were axed what she was / and wherefore she made so much
sorrow and who lay in that tomb. O syyde she what sorrow and mysauenture
fair lorseke ye here. For if the. Gyaunt may you here find he will you slay
anon. Bestylle good wife said they thereof dysmaye you not but tell us the south
why that thou make so much sorrow and weeping. Syrs said she For a damosel
that I nourysshed with my breest yt was called Eleyne / yt was nece to. Howell
of Brytayne. And here lies the body in this tomb that to me was taken to
nourysshe. And so there came a devil a Gyaunt and rauysshed her and me also /
and ladde us both with him a way he would have for layne that maid that was
young and tender of aege but she might it not suffer so great and so huge as
the. Gyaunt was. And for certain if he come now as he is wo^te to do / he
will you both now slay and therefore go ye hens. Then bespake these two
messengers and said to her / wherefore goo ye not from hens. Certes said she
when that Eleyne deed the. Gyaunt made me to abide and hau^t his will / and I
must needs it suffer. And god it wot I do it not with my will / for I had
lever to be deed than with him to deal / so much pain and sorrow I have
when he me ^oclyeth. when Kay and. Bed were had all that this woman the^ told
/ they turned again and came to king Arthur and told him all that they had
seen and herd. Arthur anon took them both wit him and went pryuely by night
that none of his host wyste and came on the morrow erly to the. Gyaunt and
faught with him strongely / and at the last him slew And Arthur badde. Bed
were smite of his heed / and bring it to the host to show it for a wonder /
for it was so great and huge. when they came again to the host / they told
wherefore they had been out / and showed to them the heed / and every man was
glad and. Ioyefull of the worthy deed that king. Arthur had done that was
their lord. And Howell was full sorrowful for his nece yt was so lost. And
after ward when he had space / he let make a fair chapel of our lady over
Eleyns tomebe.

How king. Arthur yaue bataylle to the Emperperour / in the which bataylle
the Emperor himself was slain


ARthur and his people herd tidings that the. Emperor had assembled a great
power / as well of sarasyns as of paynyms and christian men. whereof the nombre
was.lxxx. thousand horse men with foot me^. Arthur and his people ordained
fast forth their way toward the. Emperor and passed. Normandy and. France
unto. Burgoyne / and would have gone unto the host. For men told him that
the. Emperors host would come to Lucie. The Emperor and his host in the
beginning of. August remeued from Rome / and came forth right the way ^o
ward the host Tho came king Arthur spies and said / if that. Arthur would he
should find the Emperor there fast by put they said. yt the Emperor had so
great power with him of kings of ye lord of Paynems and also christian people yt
it were but folyt to king Arthur to mete with the^ For ye spies told / yt the
emperor had five or six men against one of his. King Arthur was blody and hardy
/ and for no thing him nysmayed and sayede. Goo we boldly in gods name
ayenste the. Romans / that with them led. Sarrasyns and. Paynems / that no
manner trust they have in god / But only upon their strengh. Go we now and seek
them sharply in the name of almighty god and slay we the* Paynems and christian
men that been against us with the^ for to destroy. Cryste^ men. And god shall us
help the^ to overcome For we have the right ^penyon / and therefore have we
trust in god. And we so that the enmyes that be to crystendome and to god may
be destroyed and overcome / and that men may record ye worthynesse of knight
hode. when king Arthur had thus said / they cried all with an high voys.
God that is fader almighty worshypped be thy name without end. Amen. And
grant us grace well for to do and to destroy our enmyes that been against
crystendome. In the name of the fader / the sone / and holy ghost. Amen. And
god give him never grace ne worship in the world / ne mercy of him to have /
that this day shall faynte well for to smite and egerly. And so they rode
softly / and ordained his wings well and wisely. The Emperor herd tell that
king. Arthur and his folk were ready appaerylled for to fight with him and how
they were coming He let ordeyne hes wings i^ the best wise that he cowde And
more trusted upon his strenght than in god almighty / and that was seen
afterwarde^ For when the two hosts met / the. Emperor lost four of his
folk against one of Arthur. And so many were slain \ what on ye one party and
on that other / that it was great pity to wit and to be behold. In this
battle were slain through king. Arthurs five kings of the Paynems and of
other wonder much people / and king. Arthurs men fought so well / that the
Romans and paynems had no more strength to wythstonde them / than.xx. sheep
against five wulues. And so it befelle that in this battle in the shoure / that
was wonder hard and long during in that one side and in that other / the.
Emperor among them there was slain / but there was no man that wyste for very
so the who him slew.

How king Arthur let entyere his knights that he had lost there in battle /
and how he sent the. Emperors body to. Rome that there was slain in battle
SO when the. Romans wist that the Emperor was deed / they forsook the field
and the paynens also. And king. Arthur after them chaced till it was night /
and so many of them slew yt it was wonder to tell. And the turned king
Arthur again when it was night and thanked god of his victory. And on the
morrow he let look and search all the field for his knights that he there
lost. That is to say. Borell Earl of Maunt. Bed were / and Kay / and. Lyegiers
Earl of. Boleyne. Vortiger Earl of Baac. Aloth Earl of wynchestre. Cuisall Earl
of Chestre / and after Holden Earl of. Flaandres. These were the great lords
that king. Arthur lost in that battle / with other worthy knights them
among. And some he let entere in abbayes by the country / some he let to be
borne in to their own country. And the Emperors body he let take and put
upon a beyr and sent it to Rome. And said to ye Romans / that for Brytayne
and France which he held: other truage would hen one pay. And if they axe^
him any other truages: right such truage he would them pain. The king let
bear Kay to Kenen his own castle and there him entered. And Leygier was borne
to. Boleyne there he was lord. And Holden was borne to Flaunders: there he was
entered: And all the other he let entere with much honor in abbayes and in
houses of relyon in the country that they were slain. And Arthur himself
soiourned that same year in. Bourgoyne with his host and thought the same
year following to pass the mount. Joy: and have gone to. Rome also to have
taken the Cite and have put the Romoyns in subiecyon: but the wicked tyrant.
Mordred him let: as afterye shall here

How the traitor. Mordred: to whom king. Arthur took his land to keep and
his castelles: held them against him*
AS Arthur had taken to. Mordred his reame to keep: and gone against ye Emperor
of rome: and was passed ye see. Mordred ano^e took homages and feats of all
them yt were i^ this land: and would have had this land to his own use: and
took castelles about: and let the^ be arrayed. and after this falsenesse he
did an other great wrong: for against ye law of cryste^ te he took his own
emys wife as a traitor should: ordained him a great host against arthurs coming:
to hold ye land against him with stre^gthe for ever more: and to slay king
Arthur if he might and sent by ye see and by land: and let assemble paynems
and christian people. And he sent to Saxons and to Danys for to help him. and
also. Mordred sent to Cheldrik to send men to hy mour of. Saxon yt was a
worthy duke / and promised him if that he brought with him much people he
wild grant him. Inherytaunce for ever / all the land fro Humbre to
Scotlonde / and all the land that Engist had of. Vortigers ye^re / when that
he spowsed his daughter. And cheldrik came with a great strength and power of
people / and. Mordred had assembled also on his half / that they had.xl.
thousand of strong knights when that they had need.

How Arthur enchanced Mordred the traitor and how he was slain / and also
king Arthur wounded to the death.
AS this tidings came to king. Arthur there that he was in Bourgoyne he was
full sore anoyed / and took all France to Howell for to keep with the half
deal of his men. And prayed him that he would it keep till he came again. For
himself would pass in to Brytayne / and avenge him upon. Mordred that was his
traitor. And forth with Arthur went his way and came to wytsande / and made
his men to go in to ship and would have arrived at Sandwyche / and brought
with him a grace host of Fre^shemen also with his own land men / But or that
he might come to land with his people that were come out of his ships.
Mordred was come with all his power / and yaue a strong battle / so that
king Arthur lost many a man are that he might come to land. For there was.
Gawayne his neuewe slain / and Anguysshell that held Scotlonde / and many
other whereof king. Arthur was full sorry. But after they were come to land.
Mordred might not against them endure. But anon was dyscomfyted and flydde
thens the same night with his men / and upon the morn came to^ London. But tho
of the cite would not suffer him to come in. And from thens he fled to
wynchestre / and there he him held with his people yt came with him. King
Arthur let take the body of. Gawyne his cofyn / and the body of. Anguysshell /
and let ye one be borne in to Scotlonde / and the other to Dover and buried
Anon after king. Arthur took his way for to destroy mordred / and he fled
thens in to Cornewayle. And ye quen Gun^or yt was king Arthurs wife yt
thosoiourned (...) york / herd ye Mordred was fled thens and that he might
not endure against king Arthur she was fore aferde and had great doubt / and
wist not what was best of all for to done. For she understood well that her
lord king. Arthur would never of her for to have marcy for ye great shame
that she had done unto him / And took her a way pryuely with four men without
moo / and came to. Karlyon / and there she dwelled all there live / and never
after was seen among the folk her life during. King Arthur wist that Mordred
was fled in to Cornewayle / and let send after his men in to. Scotlonde and
Northomberlonde unto Humbre / and let assemble folk without nombre / and came
fro thens in to. Cornewayle to seek and pursewe after Mordred. And Mordred had
assembled to him all the folk of. Cornewayle and had people without nombre
(...) wist that Arthur was coming / and had lever to deye and take his chance
/ than longer flee and abode and yaue an hard battle to king. Arthur and to
his people so that much people was slain what of one side and what of that
other / that noman wist who had the better party. But so it befell at the last
that Mordred was slain and al his folk / and the good chyualry that king.
Arthur had gadred and nourysshed of dyuer lands and also the noble knights of
the round table / that so much were praised thorugh out all the world were
there slain / and king Arthur himself was wounded unto death. But he let him
to be borne to Auioun to be heeled of his wounds. And yet the. Brytons
supposed that he lived in an other land / and that he shall come yet and
conquer all Brytayne. But certes this is ye prophecye of Merlyn. He said
that his death shall be doubtous / and said sothe. For thereof yet men have
doubt / and shall have for ever more as men say. For me^ wot not wyther that
he is on live or deed. Arthur was borne at Auioun the.xxii. year of his regne
after the. Incarnacyon of our lord Ihesu Christ.v.C.xlvi. year.

How king Arthur delivered the reame unto Constantyne the sone of Cador his
neuewe
AS king Arthur wyste that he might no longer regne / he let come before
him Constantyne yt was Cadors sone Earl of Cornewayle his cosyn and to him
betoke all his reame and took him said / and bad him thereof to be king till
that he came again / for as much as he had none heeyre of his body begoten. And
great damage was it / that so noble a king and so doughty as he was / had
no child of his body begoten. But all thing that god woll have done must be
done / whose name be blessed without end

How king Constantyne was vexed of Mordred two sons.
THis Constantyne was a noble knight and a worthy of body. And tho two sons
that. Mordred had begoten had great envy of Consta^tyne that tho was crowned
king. And so it befell yt they meued war against him. And assembled a great
host of them that were before with Mordred / and had been driven a way / and
that did much sarowe and anguysshe thrughout all that land. That one brother
ordained / and purposed him toward the ancient Cite of London for to take ye
cite And that other went to wynchestre. But Constantyne came to London and
slew him yt was there. And after he went to wy^chestre and slew him yt was
there also. So yt both his enmyes were deed. And when Constantyne had reigned
well and worthily four year / he deyed and lies at London.

Of the kings Adelbryght and of Edell.
AFter king Constantynes death there were two kings in Brytayne / ye one was
called. Adelbryght yt was a danoys. And he held the country of. Norfolk and.
Southfolke. That other hight Edell and was a. Bryton \ and held Nicholl.
Lendeser / and all the land unto. Humbre. These two kings fast warred
together / but after accorded they were and loved together / as they had been
borne of oo body. The king Edell had a suster that was called Orewenne. And he
gaf her thrught great freodshyp to king. Adelbryght to wife. And he begat upon
her a daughter that was called. Argentyll. And in the third year after came
upon him a strange sykenesse that needs he must deye. And he sent to king.
Edell his brother in law that he should come and speak with him / and he came
to him with a good will. Tho prayed he the king and coniured him also in the
name of god / That after when he were deed / he should take his daughter
Argentyll and the land / and that he kept her well / and nourysshe her in
his chamber. And when she were of aege / she should be married to the strongest
and worthyest man that he might find / and then he should yield up her
land again. Edell it granted and by oath confermed his prayer. And when
Adelbryght was deed and enteryd / Edell took the damoysell. Argentyll / and
nourrsshed her in his chamber: and she became as fair as any might be.

How king Edell married that damoysell to a knave of his kechyne.
THis king Edell that was uncle to Argentyll: be thought how that he might
falsely have the land fro his nyce for ever more: and falsely aynst his oath
thought to dysceyue ye damoysell: and to marye her to a knave of his kechyne
that was called Curan: and he became ye worthyest and strongest man of body
that any man wist in any land that tho lived: and to him he thought her
shamfully have married for to have had her land afterward / but he was clean
dysceyued. For this Curan was Hauelockis sone that was king of. Kyrkelane in.
Denmark: and this. Curan conquered his wives land after ward and slew king
Edel that was h^ wives uncle and had al her land / as in an other place it
tells more openly: and he reigned but.iii. year for Saxons and. Danes hi^
slew and that was great harm to all Brytayn and Srytons bare him to.
Sto^henge and entyred him honorably.

Of king Conan that was Curans cosyn.
AFter this Curan reigned his cosyn Conan that was a wonder proud knight. And
reigned and could have no manner of love / but ever he was medlynge with his
people. And took his uncle with war and slew his two chyldern. The Saxons
warred against him oftentimes: but he them over came: and so he was in peace all
his life tyme^ And he reigned.xiiii. year: And after he deyed and lies at London.

Of king Cortyf and of Gurmonde that came thorugh the paynems in to Brytayne.
AFter this Conan reigned his cosyn cortyf that was behated of all his people and
no thing beloved. and this. Cortyf lost all Brytayne through war. And i^ his
time fell ye great myscheyf in Brytayn ye crystendom was destroyed and all ye
Brytons were dryue^ out of the land and the land lost with out any recover.
But after ward left the land to the Saxons as ye afterward shall here. For
in that time there was a paynem that was called Gormo^de / that was the kings
sone Daufrices of the panems folk that had the reame after his fader / and
was king / sauf he bequaue and yaue it to his brother. And said that he would
never be king / but if that he might get and conquer a reame in a strange
country. For he was bold and strong of body. And of him prophesied Merlyn
and said / that hesholde be a wulf of the sea. And he let assemble paynems
without nombre / and let appareylle ships / and went by many lands / and
took homages and feautees of many. And so he went by the sea and conquered
many diverse lands. So that he came in to Irlonde / and conquered that land /
that often times warred upon. Brytons / and Brytons upon them and often won and
often lost and yaue hostages to Brytons. And so they sent to Gurmonde there that
he was in Irlonde / that he should come in to Brytayne and help them against ye
Brytons / to help them to deliver that land of them / and they would him
hold gladly for their lord. For he was a paynem / and they were paynems and
the Brytons were crystened. well ought he them for to help / so as they were
all of one law. wha^ Gurmonde herd this prayer he hasted him as much as he
might and arrived in Scotlonde / and came in to Northomberlonde there that the
Saxons were dwelling and they confermed the couenau^tes between them that were
made by oaths and by hostages / for to bear him true fay / and hold him for
lord and pay to him truage by the year Tho began the. Saxons and ye.
Affricans to destroy rob and brenne towns / and destroy all theng^ in
asmoche as they might and spared neither man woman ne child learned ne lewd /
But all they slew / and cast down towns castles and chirches / and so put
they all the land in great destruccyon. And as soon as they might flee /
they fled thens as well poor as rich / bishops / abbottes / chanons / and
all other great and small / some in to little Brytayne / and some in to
Cornewayle / all tho ye ships myghht have.

How the king. Gurmonde drove king Cortyf to Chechestre / and slew the
Brytons / and through craft and engyne gate the same town.
COrtyf the king fled thens in to Chechestre that tho was strong / and there
held him.xx. days / and this Gurmonde came and it besyeged. But the cytee was
so strong that he might not get it by no manner of wise with engyne that they
might do. Tho bethought they upon a subtylte for to brenne the town. They
made engynes with glewe of nets / and took pecys of thunder and of fire and
bond it to sparowes feet and than let them flee and they ano^e flewe and
lodged the^ in ye town there yt their nestis were / and in stackes and
euesynges of houses / and ye fire began to kyndle and burnt all ye town / And
when the. Brytons saw that in every side they hyed them out and fought / but
anon they were slain and dyscomfyted / And while battle dured the king
pryuely hid him and stale away in to walys / and men wist never where he
became / and so was the town of Chechestre taken and destroyed. And after.
Gurmonde went and destroyed towns and cytees that never were after made again
/ as it is seen yet in many places of this land.

How this land was called England for the name of Engyst / and how many
kings were made after in this land.
SO when. Gurmonde had destroyed all the land through out: he yaue the land to
the Saxons: and anon they took it with good will / for the Saxons long time
had desired it. For asmoche as they wereof. Engistes kynred that first had all
the land of. Brytayne and let them be called. Englyssmen: for by cause of
Engistes name: and the land they let call England in their langage: and the
folk ben called Englyshmen: for asmoche as in this time it was called Engistes
land when he had conquered it of. Vortiger: that spoused his daughter But fro
the time yt Brute came first in to England: this land was called. Brytane:
and the folk Brytons. But sith the time yt this Gurmonde conquered it eftsoon
and yaue it unto the. Saxons: they anon right changed the name as before is
said. And when this was done. Gurmonde passed over in to France: and there
conquered many lands: and destroyed all christian people there that he came. And
the Saxons dwelled in this land and began fast to enhabyte it at there own
will. And they would have made new kyngis and lords: but they might never
assent to have only oo king for to be to them attendaunt / and therefore they
made many kings in diverse shyres: as it was in Engistes time. The first
kingdom was Kente: and that oath. Southsexe: and the third westsex / the
fourth Eestsex / and the fyfth Nothu^berlonde / and ye sixth Estangle that is
to say Northfolke / and Southfolke and the seventh Mercheryche / and that is
the Erldoste of Nycholl. Hu^tyngdon. Herforde. Gloucetre. wynlchestre. were wyke
and Derby / and so departed all England in to.vii. parties. And after that it
befell that tho kings warred often times together. And ever he that was strongest
took him that was feblest / and so it was long time yt they had no king
crowned among them / ne no christian man was tho among them / ne crystendome
nather. But were paynems till that saint Gregory was pope of: Rome / that had
seen childern of the nacyon of England in the cite of Rome / that were wonder
fair creatures / and had great will and desire them to behold. And axed of
ye merchants whens they were / and of what nacyon. And men told him that
they were of England / and Inglysshe they were called / but they and all the
people of England were paynems: and byleued not upon god. Alas said saint
Gregory: well may they be called English: for they have the vysages of
angels and therefore well ought they to be crystened. And for this cause saint
Gregory theresente saint. Austyn in to England and.xl. good me^ with him that
were of good life and holy men to preche and teache and to comuetre the English
people and them to torn to god: and that was in the.vi. year that saint
Gregory had be pope of Rome / that is to say / ofter thyn carnacyon of our
lord Ihesu Christ.v.C.lxxxv. years as the Cronycle tells.

How saint Austyn baptized and converted king Adelbryght and the bysshoppes
that he made his fellows.
AS saint Austyn came first in to. England / he arryuen in the isle of Tenet
and so passed forth and came unto Caunterbury and there soyourned. And king
Adelbryght of Kent that was the lygnage of Engist goodly received saint Austyn
and his fellows with much honor / and them found all that them neded. And
more over he yaue them a fair place / that now is called the abbay of. Shynt
Austyn / in which place he lyth him self shryned. This king Adelbryght was a
good man and with good will herd saint Austyns predycacyons / and yaue him
leave to preche thrughout all his land before said of Kente / to torn and
convert to him all ye people that he might. It befelle so after thorugh
gods grace / that in little time the king himself was converted to god / and
all his peop of his land were baptized. And in the mean while the people
turned them to god. Saint Austyn came to. Rochestre / and there he preched the
word of god. And the paynems therefore him scorned / and cast upon him reygh
taylles / so that all his mantell was hanged full of these reygh tails / and
for more dyspyte / they cast upon him the guts of reyghes and other fysshe.
wherefore the good man Saint Austyn was sore anoyed and grieved. And prayed to
god that all tho chyldern of that cite that should be borne after ward / that
is for to say in the of Rochestre / might have taylles and so they had And
when the kynger herd of this vengeance that was fall through saint Austyns
prayer. He let make an house in the honor of almighty god / wherein wymmen
should be delivered of their childern at the bryges end / In the which house
yet wymmen of the cite ben delyuerde of child. when that saint Gregory had
hrede tell how the English people were turned to god and comuerted he sent
unto saint. Austyn his pallyon by a b^sshop / that was called Paulin and made
him Prymate and Archebysshop of England And sent word that he should ordeyne
and make dysposynge the land. And anon Austyn had the pallyon of the dygnyte
of the Archebysshyp. He made two bishops of his fellows that came with him fro
Rome and one was called Mellite and he dwelled at London and that other was
called Justin that held the dygnyte at. Rochestre. And this bishop Mellite
tho went to preche in to Estsex and erystened the king of the country that
was called Sicwith that was king Adlebrytes cosyn his systers sone. This
Iustyn went to preche in Southse^ and turned much of the people to god. And
Saint Austyn himself preched thorugh out England.

How saint Austyn went in to waels there the Brytons were / and how they would
not beobedyent tothe. Archebysshop of Canterbury.
SO when all England was crystened and turned to god / saint Astuyn went in to
that land there that the Brytons were for to keep them from Englysshmen /
that is* to say in to ways. And there he found monks and abbayes and.vii.
bishops. For ye Brytons always destroyed the christian people that saint Austyn
had converted. And he said to the bishops that he was a Legate of Rome and
Prymate of all. England / and that they should by all reason to him be
obedyenc and they said they nolde / but to the. Archebysshop of Carlyon they
would. They would never for no manner thing be obedyent to the English men
For the Englysshemen they said ben our adversaries and our enmyes and have
driven us out of our country / and weben christian men and ever have be. And the
Englysshemen have ever be paynems / but now of late that they ben converted.
Saint Austyn of them might have none answer otherwise / but said pertly that
they would never them meke to him / ne to the pope of Rome. And saint Austyn
turned again tho to king Adelbryght yt was king of Kent and told him that his
folk would not be to no man obedyent / but to the. Archebysshop of Carlyon.
And when the king herd this / he was sore anoyed and said that he would them
destroy / and sent to Elfryde king of Northunberlonde that was his friend /
that he should come to him with all the power that he might and that he would
mete him at Leycetre / and fro thens they would go in to walys / and there
destroy the Archebysshop of Carlyon / and all tho that had refused saint Austyn

How king Adelbryght and the king Elfryde slew Brecinall that was a king of
Brytons that held the country of Leycetre.
IT be tell so that there was a king of Brytons that held the country of
Leycetre and all the country about / his name was Brecinall. And this Bryton
herd tell that tho two English kings would mete there at Leycetre for to
goo in to walys. He let ordeyne all the power that he had for to goo fight
with these two kings / but little it auayled him / for his folk that he had
were slain and himself fled / and lost his lands for ever more. And these
two kings Adelbryght and Elfryde dwelled a while at Leycetre / and departed
the land among them / and took homages and feautees of the folk of the
country And after they went to ward walys and thot of walys herd tell of
these comfyture that Breic^all had at Leycetre / and were wonder for adrad of
tho two kyngees. And took and those among them good men and holy of hemytes
monks and priests / and of other people great plentye that went bare foot
and wulwarde for ta have mercy of these two kings / but tho kings were so
stern and so wyked yt they would never speak to the^ but them slew euerychone
Alas for sorrow / for they ne spared them noomore than the wulfe does the
sheep / but smot of their heedes euerychone / and so they were all martrd that
to them came / that is to understand.v.C. and.xl. After they went fro thens
to Bangor for to slay all those that there might there find of the Brytons.
And when ye Brytouns herd that / they assembled and ordened all there power for
to fight with thyem. Two was there a baron in walys that was called. Bledrik of
Cornewayle that some time was lord of Deuenshyre but the king. Adelbright had
dreuen him out in to walys and after there he yaue them battle. And at that
battle was king Adelbright slain and Efrydesore wounded and forsook the
field / and the most party of his people slain. And Elfryde flede in to
Northumberlonde that was his own lo^de^ And after that the people of Leycetre
shyre made with strenght Cadewan yt was Brycinals sone king of Leceytre / And
he afterregned nobly and with great honor.

How Cade wan king of Leycetre and Elfryde king of Northumberlonde were
friends / and of the debate yt after was between Edwyn and Cad walyn that were
both their sons
ANd after that this bataylle was done yt Brytons assembled them and went
thens and came to Leycetre / and made there Caudewan that was Brecinals sone
king of Leycetre and of all the country. Aed he took homages and feautes of
all the folk of the country. And after that he assembled a great host and
said he would goo in to Northumberlonde / to destroy king Elfryde and sle him
if he might. And when he was come thither / friends went so between them that
they accord them in this manner / that Elfryde should hold all the land fro
Northumberlonde to Scotlonde. And Cadewan should have all the land a this side
Humbre to the Southe / and after they were good friends all their life / and
loved as they had been brethern. And this Elryde had a sone called Edwyn that
held all^ the land of Northu^berlonde after his fathers death as his fader
had hold all his life time And Cadewa^ had another sone called Cadwalyn that
held his faders land as he it held while he was alive / and these loved as
brethren. And ye love lasted betwyxt them but only two year / and after began
debat betwyxt them through a synple enuyous cosyn of Cadwalins. called Bryens
/ so yt they assembled a great host in both parties. And at the last it be
fell ye Cadwalin was dyscu^forted / and Edwen him pursued and drove him fro
place to place so at the last he fled in to Irelonde. And ye other destroyed
and pylled his land / and cast down castles and burnt his manners / and
departed all Cadwalins land among his friends. And long time after came
Cadwalen again fro Irlonde with a strong pour / and in plain battle slew
Edwyn and all his friends / and namely tho yt with held his lands by Edwyns
yefte.

How king Oswallde was slain though king Cadwalin and Peanda / and how
Oswy that was saint Oswaldes brother reigned after him and slew Peanda.
AS Edwyn was slain. Offris his sone undertook that war ayenste Cadwalin his
came / so yt this Offris deyed during ye war. And after ye death of this
Offris tho reigned a gentyl christian man that much loved god almighty yt had all
the land of Northumbrelonde by heritage / yt was called Oswalde and he was
king of all the land. But for as much as he was friend to Edwyn / and held
a great part of the land of Cadwalin. This same cadwalyn warred upon him and
drove him to ward Scotlond. And when Cadwalin saw that he would not abide.
Cadwalin would no longer him pursue / but took some of his folk to Peanda his
brother in law and prayed him to pursue after Oswalde / till that he were taken
and slain / and Cadwalin toruned home again. when Oswalde herd these tidings
that Cadwalin turned home again / he would no le^ger flee / but abode Peanda
and yaue him battle / and Peanda was dyscomfort^e and fled and came again to
Cadwalyn and said that he would never hold one foot of land of him / but if
so were that he would avenge him of Oswalde. Cadwalin let assemble a great
host for to fight with Oswalde so that he and Peanda came to Northumberlonde
and yaue battle unto Oswalde And in the same battle was Oswalde slain and
his heed smyten of / and after he was entered at the abbay of Berdenay in
which place god had wrought for him many a fair miracle / both there and
else where. And anon Oswy his brother seized all the land in to his hand
that was this Oswaldis And the folk of Northumberlonde loved him wonderly well
/ and held him for their lord. But he had men of his kynne worthy enough that
would have departed the land / and they warred togyed well. And for asmoche as
they were not strong enough / they came to Peanda and prayed him of help and
socour. And behyght him of ye lord largely upon this covenant that he would
them govern and help / and counseyl Peanda herd their prayer and so spoke
with Cadwalyn / that he should ordain a great host and fast ordained him in
to Northumberlonde for teyght with Oswy. And Oswy was a meke man / and much
loved peace and charity and prayed Peanda of love and peace and profe^ede him of
gold and silver great plentye. And this Peanda was so proud yt he nolde
grant him peace fo no manner thing but for all thing he would with him fight.
S^o at the last there was set a day of battle. And Oswy ever trusted upon
god and Peanda trusted tomoche upon pride and upon his host that he had. And
to gyder they smote egerly but Peanda was anon dyscomforted and slain. And
this was After the Incarnacyon of our lord Ihesu Christ.v.C.lv. year And this
Oswy reigned.xxviii. year And a king that was called Oswyne / that was Peandaes
cosyn warred upon him and together fought / But Oswy had the victory of
Oswyne. And Oswyn was dyscomforted and slalyne / and lies at Tynnemouth.

How king Cadwaldre that was Cadwalins sone reigned after his fader / and was
the last king of Brytons.
AFter the death of Cadwelin reigned his sone Cudwaldre well and nobly. And his
mother was ye sister of Peanda. And when he had reigned.xii. year / he fell in
to a great sykenesse / and then was there a great dyscorde between the
lords of the land / that every of them warred upon other. And yet in that
time there fell so great derth and scarsyte of corn and other viteylles in this
land / that a man might go.iii. or iiii. days fro town to town yt he
should not find to bye for gold ne silver bread / wine ne none other vitayle
where which a man might live. But only the people lived by rotis of herbs /
for other living had they none / so much was it faylled all about / Fysshes
/ wild bestes / and all other thing so that yet to this mysauenture / there
fell so great mortalyte and pestelens among the people by the corrupcyon of
the air that ye living people suffysed not to burye the deed bodies. For they
deyed so suddenly / both great and small lord and servant / in etynge
going and speaking they fell down and deyed / so that never was herd of more
sodeyne death among the people For he that went for to burye the deed body /
with the same deed body was buried. And so they that might flee fled and
forsook their lands and houhes / as well for the great hungre derth and
scarsyte of corn and other vitayll / as for the great mortalyte and pestylence
in the land / and went into other lands for to save their lives and left
the land all deserte and wast / so yt there was noman for to travail and
tylthe the land So that the land was barayne of corn and all other fruytes
for defawte of tyllyers / and this mysauenture dured.xi. year and more that
noman might ere ne sow

How Cadwaldre went out of this land in to little Brytayne.
CAdwaldre saw great hungre mortalyte and pestylence / and the land all poor
/ and faylynge corns and other vytaylles / and his folk perysshed / and saw
also the most party of his land all wasted and void of people. He
apparelled him and his folk that were left alive / and passede over in to
little Brytayne with a little navy unto king Alayne that he much loved / that
was his cosyn and that his fader had much loved in his time. And as they
sailed in the sea / he made much lamentacyon / and so did all tho that were
with him and said. (Dedisti nos domine tanquan^ oues escaru^. et in gentibus
dispersisti nos)

ANd then began Cadwaldre to complain him to his folk pyteously and sayd^
Alas said he / to us wretches and caytyues is sorrow for our great synnys / the
which we would not amend us while we had space / and now repentance is comen
upon us through my sauenture / which chaced us out of our reame and propre
soil. And out of the which sometime Romans. Becottes. Saxons / neither Danys
might not exyle us. But what auaylleth it now to us that before time / often
times have gotten many other lands / sith it is not the will of god that we
abide and dwell in our own land. God that is very Judge yat all things
knows before they ben done or made / he sees that we would not cesse of our
sins / and that our enmyes might not us ne our lygnage exyle fro / and out
of our reame He would that we amend us of our folyes and that we see our
propre defautes.

And therefore has showed to us wrath / and woll chastyse us of our misdeeds.
Syche that he does us with out battle / or strength of our enmyes / by grace
companyes / wretcchedly to leave our reame and propre land. Torn again ne ye
Romanys / torn again ye Scotts torn again ye Saxxons / torn again ye
Frau^soys. Now seweth to you Brytayne all deserte the which your power might
never make deserte / ne yet our power has not put us now in exyle But only
the power of the king allmyghty whom we have often offended by our folyes /
the which we would not leave until he chastyced us by dyuyne power Among the
worlds and lamentacyon that the king Cadwhldre made to his folk / they
arrived i^ little Brytayne / and came to king Alayne before said And the king
received him with great Joy / and made him to be seruede wonder nobly. And
there abode they long time after The Englesshe people that were left a live
and were escaped the great hungre and mortalyte / lived in the best wise that
they might. And much people sprange and came of them And they sent in to
Saxonye where that they were borne to there friends for men / wyemen / and
children / to restore the cytees with people and the towns that were all void
of people / and for to labor / traueyll and tylthe the earth. when the Saxons
herd these tidings / they came in to ye land wonder thyeke in great
companyes / and herborowed therselfe in the country all about where that they
would / for they found no man them for to let ne withstonde. And so they
waxed and multeplyed gretely. And used the manners and customs of the country
whereof they were come. And they used also the laws and the langages and speech
of their own land that they came fro. And also they changed all the names of
Cytyes / twones / castelles / and brought / and yaue them names and called as
they now ben called And they held the Counrees. Baronages and lordeshyps in
manner as the Brytons before time had compassed them / And among other great
companyes that came from Germayne in to this land / came the noble queen that
was called Se^burga with men and wymmen without nombre^ And arrayed in the
country of Northumberlonde / and took the land from Ilbion unto Cornewaylle
for her and for her folk. For there was none that might the^ let / for all
was desolace and void of people / but it were a few poor Brytons that were
left on mountayns and woddes until that time. And fro that time forth lost
the Brytons this reame for all their days. And the English people begane to
regne / and departed the lord between them. And they made many kings about
by diverse parties of the land as here ben dyuyded. The first of westesexe /
The second^ Merchenriche / The third Estangle / the fourth Kente / the fyfth
Southsex. All those reigned in this land after ye Cadwaldre was passed out of
this land / and dwelled in little Bryten with king Alayne his cosyn and true
friend. And when he had long dwellede there / and had knowing that the
mortalyte and pestelence was ouerpassed / and that the land was replenysshed /
again with people / he thought to torn again in to his land And prayed king
Alayne his cosyn of socour and help yt he might be restored again to his owoe
propre reame and first dygnyte / And king Aleyne granted him his asking.
Then did he appareylle him to take his wayt and vyage in to this land. And
prayed god allmyghty devoutly that he would make to him demonstracyon / if his
prayer to this land were too hyme plesaunt or none / for ayenste the will of
god allmyghty he would no thing do. wha^ he had thus devoutly made his prayer
/ avoys fro heaven to him said. And had him leave ye Iurney a way in to
England / and that he should goo to the pope of Rome for it was not the will
of almighty god yt the Brytons should regne more in Brytane / ne never
recovered it unto the time of the prophecye that Marlyn said before he
fu^fylled. And that should never be unto ye time were come / that the relyques
of his body shall be brought fro Rome and translated in to Brytayne / And when
the ralykes of other saints that have been hedde for ye persecucyon of the
paynem folk shall be found and openly showed / thenn shall they recover
their land again / the which they have so long time lost through their
deserts. whane Cadwaldre had herd this answer / he maruayled gretely and
told it to the king Aleyne Thene king Aleyne did send for the clergy of
his land / and made them to bring the stories and prophecyes that Merlyn and
Sybyll had said in their prophcyes. And when he knew that the prophycye that
Festom had prophesied of the Egle. And other prophecyes accorded to the dyuyne
answer that Caddewalldre had herd. He counseled him and right faithfully
desired him to leave his people and his navy / and submytte him to the
dyspocysyon of god / and do all that the angel had commanded him. Thenye
Cadwaldre called y^or his sone and ymori his cosyn that was his systers sone /
and said to them. Takes said he my folk and my navy that is here all ready /
and pass into walys and be ye lordees of Brytons that no dyshonoure come to
them by interrupcyon of the Paynem folk for defaute of lords. And thene
himself left his reame of Brytayne and his folk for ever more / and took
his way unto the pope of Rome Sergius the which worshypede him much / and so
he was confessed / and took penance for his sins. And he had not long
dwelled there that he ne deyed / the.xii. Kalendis in May ^ the year of
grace.v.C.lxxii.

How king Offa was sovereign above all the kings of England / and how every
king warred upon other.
IT befell so that all the kings in that time that were in you land. as they
of westsex. Marchenryche. Estangle / of kente / and of Southsex and of other
costs each warred upon other And he that most might took the land of him
that was most feblest. But there was a king among them that was called Offa
/ that was saint Oswaldes brother. This Offa conquered all the kings of ye
land / and reigned all above them all. And s^^ great was the yt war in every
there between greeks / that no man might wit how the land went. But abbottos
pryours / and men of Relygyon wrote yt lives and deeds of kings / and how
long every of them reigned and in what country and in what manner every king
deyed / and of bishops also. And thereof made great bokys and let call them
Chronicles. And the good king Alured had that book in his ward. And let
bring it unto wynchestre / and let it be fast tacked to a pylar that men
should it not remeue / ne bear it thens / so that every man should it see and
thereupon look For therein ben the lives of all the kings that ever were in
England.

How the king of Northumberlonde Osbryght forlaye the wife of Buerne Bocarde
through strength / and after this Buerne conquered the king with power and
strength.
ANd thus it befell in ye same time / that there was a king in Northumberlond
^e that was called Osbryght / and soyourned at york. And this king went
him upon a day in to a wood him for to / dysporte. And as he came again / he
went pryuely in to a good man's house / that was called Buerne / and the good
man of that place was gone that time to the sea. For oftentimes there he was
wont to spy thieves and robbers that oftentimes were wont to come in to the
land / to rob / brenne / and slay. The lady that was Buernes wife was a
wonder fair woman. And the king came unto her when that herhusbode was
absente / and she trusted none harm unto the king / and welcomed him with
much honor / and worthily him served in all thing. when the king had eten
/ he took the lady by the hand and ^adde her in to a chamber and said. He
would speak with her a counseyll. And all the folk he made void fro the
chamber / save only the lady and he. But the lady wist not wherefore he it did
/ till that he had done all his will. And when he had done this deed / He
turned again to york. And the lady he left there sore weeping for the deed
that the king to her had done. And when he^ lord was came home and saw her
weep and such sorrow and morning make / he axed of her what she had done /
and why she made such sorrow. Sire she said / subtylly and falsely the king
Osbryght^ has do me shame and vylanye ayeast my will. And told him all the
truth how the king had ^orlayne her with strength / wherefore she said she
had lever to be deed than tolyue. Fair love be stylle said he / for against
strength feblenesse is yltell worth / and therefore of me shalt thou
nevertheless beloved and namely for thou have told me the treuthe. And if
almighty god grant to me my life I shall the aueng. This Buerne was a great man
and a mighty lord / and was well beloved and great friends had. And let
send for the grettest lords of the land / and to them made hes complaynte of
the despyte / that the king to him had done and said / he would be avenged
how ever yt were. And all his friends counseylled him that he should goo unto
york there that the king was him to defye. And Buerne took his main and came
to the king. when the king him saw / he called him curtously Buerne by name.
And Buerne him answerred to him said. Sire I you defye / and yield up feautes
homages and lands / and as much as I have holden of you / and fro this time
for ward I will never of the nothing hold. And so he departed fro the king
without more speech or any abiding and took leave of his friends and went in
to Denmark / and playned to the king Godern / and told him of the despyte of
that the king Osbryght to him had done of his wife. And prayed him of
socour / and help him for to avenge. when king Godern of Denmark and the
danys had herd the complaynt of this Buerne / and the prayer that he badde /
they were right wonder glasde in their hertes / for as much as they might
find a cause for to goo in to England for to warree upon Englesshe men / and
for to aenge Buerne of the despyte that the king Osbryght had done unto his
wife. And for as much as Buerne was sybbe unto the king of Denmark / anon
they let ordeyne a great host of men and let ordeyne them ships / and
as much as them need for to have to that vyage. And when all the host was
ready / the king made his two brethern chyef capytayns / that were noble
knights of body and also bold. That one was called Hunga / and that other
Hubba.

How the Danys took york / and slew the king Osbrygt / and soon after
slew king Eelle.
Sall was ready yt two brethern took leave ofthe king Godren. and went toward
the sea for to passe^ over in to Inglonde as fast as they might speed Now is
Buerne so well comforted and fast hyed him with the Danys that they ben
arrived in the North country and comen through out Holdernes / and destroyed all
the country and brenned towns / and robbed folk / and slew all that they
might take till that they came unto york. And when king Osbryght saw them
come / He took all his people that he had with him and came out of the cytee
and faught with them / but no foyson he ne had against them / and much of
the people that there was were slain on both partyas. And king Osbryght him
self there was slain / and the cite anene was take and the Danys went in. And
there was also an other king in Northumberlonde / that Buernes friends had
those and held him for king / a man that was called Elle / for as much as
they would not to king Osbryght be attendan^t / for the despyte that he had
done unto Buerne their cosyn. It befell thus that the king Elle was gone in to
the wood him for to dyosporte and of the venyson some he had taken. And as he
sat in the wood at meet / to a knight he said. we ha^ well spedde and much
venyson taken. And with that word came in a man and to him said if yeso much
of venyson have won / an hodred times so much more there against have ye
lost. For all this country the Danys have gotten / and taken the Cytee of
york / and against you shall it hold / that never ye shalcome therein / and for
so much they have slain king Osbryght. when king Elle herd these words /
he let assemble all the folk of he country and ordained all the power that
he might have and would have gotten the town of york with strength. But the
Danys came out anon and yaue him a strong battle. And selwe the king Elle
and the most part of ye people yt he had brought with him. And the same place
there they were slain / shall ever more be called Elle crofte / and that
place is a little from york. And the rested the Danys never till that they
had conquered all Northumberlonde. And in that country they made wardeynes /
and went further in to the land / and took Notyngham. And there they abode
all ye winter / and dyed all the sorrow that they might And after when Somer
time came they remeued from Notyngham and came in to Nicholl and Lyndesey /
and to Holonde. For no man might them wythstande / so much power and
strength they had

How saint Edmo^de the king was Martyred
ANd so far had the Danys passed from / country to country. and ever
more brynnynge and robbynge and destroyenge all that they might tylle they came
unto / Tetstforede. and in that country they found a Christian king / that
much loved god and his works that was called Edmonde. And he was a king of
Norfolk and Southfolke This saint Edmonde king ordained as much folk as he
might / and fought with the Danys / but he and his folk were dyscomfyted /
And the king himself driven unto the castle of F^amelynham. And the Danys
him purshewed / and came unto ye same castle / And when king Edmonde saw
that the castle might not them withstand he came ayenste them / with whom
the Danys first did speak. And anon they a^ed of him where king Edmonde was.

How forsothe said he when I was in the castle / there was the hyng / and
when I went out of the castle he went out also / and whether he shall escape
or deye / at gods will must it all be. when saint Edmonde had named god
/ by that word wyste they well that it was him self And anon Hubba and
Hu^gar took him and said / that he should god forsake and all christian laws /
as many other had done him before^ And saint Edmonde said that he would never
/ but rather he would suffer death for gods love and his laws to.

Tho took they king Edmonde and bond him unto a tree / and made their archers
to shote at him with arowes / till that his body sty^ked as fulle of arowes as
an orchen is fulle of pryckes. But for all the pain that they him did he
would never god for sake. And in the same pain / and torment he deydd / and
betoke his soul unto almighty god. And when they saw that he was deed / they
smote of his heed. And of this manner as ye have herd was saint Edmonde
martred.

How Hubba and Hungar took the town of Redynge
SO when Saint Edmonde was martred. Hungar and Hubba yede thens with all the
Danys unto Redynge. and as they went thyderwarde they burnt towns and tyees
/ and slew all christian pele yt wolde^ opnote forsake hod / and cast down
church and came to Redynge and took the town and there held them till that
the king Edelf of westsex came thither with all his power for to take the
towns Tho came out the Danys for to give battle to Edelf / and at that
battle was slain an earl of the Danys that was called Sidrak. Upon the morrow
came king Eldred and his brother Alured with a strong power and a great
host. And the king Edelf came again that had foughten the day before to
that bataylle And the Danys tho came out for to fight with them / and the
bataylle was wonder strong For many a man was there slain and the Danys that
day had the vyctorye / and the king Eldred and his brother Alared that day
were dyscomfyted. But the fourth day after ward the Danys and the English
fought tohyder an other time upon Elkedene / and there was slain a king of
Denmark that was called Rafin and four earls of great power. And that day
had the Danys shame / for they were driven unto Engilfelde. And the.xv. day
after the Danys and the English men fought an ather time at Rafynge and there
were the Englysshemen dyscomfyted / and from thens a dane yt was called Roynt
went to redynge with his host and destroyed all that he might take. And king
Eldred faught with him / but he was wounded sore wherefore he deyed / and he
reigned but.v. year / and lies at womborn.

him self of his trespaas and prayed to god to withdraw his sentence. To whom
our lord apperyd in his sleep and said. will thou that I spare the now or i^
time to come. And he was a lover of wretches / and said / give me here my
reward. Then^e was he Emperor after many a deye And when he should have
corrected his knytes for the extorcyon that they did / they asked him why yt he
would not pay them their wages. And so they fell at varyaunce / and chose Foka
for to be Emperor and slew him and his three sons. This time saint Austyn
came in to England and ordained two Archebysshops that is to say of London /
and of york by the commandment of saint Gregory. And remember that many
times is made me^cyon of diverse regyons and countries / that of time they have
be turned to ye faith For always the faith abode not in them for diverse causes
So it is of England. France. Persia. Iewery. And in this thing Rome was
pryueleged / for the faith of Peter never failed. Focas was Emperoor after
Maurici his master / whom he and other slew. And by cause he began evil he
ended naught. For in his days the Romans faught strongely against the Persees
/ and the Romans were dysco^fyted and lost many a prouynce. And at the last
he was overcome and slain of Heraclius. For as he did unto other men / so he
was done unto.

the Incomparaple profit of all holy church / He was one of the pryncypall
doctors of all the four doctors of ye church / This man forsooth alone with
saint Fabyan after saint Peter / was chosen of god in all the ordres of the
popes of Rome / Many things he ordained in the church / as is showed in his
regystre (Deus in adyutoryu^) for to be before the begynnygge of ye hours he
commanded to be said. He renewed and made all ye officers of the church in a
fair and a more compendyous manner / the which abides yet unto this day /
and is called Gregorianu^. and shortly for to conclude on this holy man /
man's tongue cannot express lightly ye louynges of this man what in wrytynges
/ and also in example of virtuous deeds. and Saninianus was pope after Gregory
one year and.v months This man ordained tyngynge of belles at the hours of
the day / but this man bachyted saint Gregory for his lyberalyte that he had
to poor men and thought he spe saint Gregory rebuked him thryes for it. And
the four the time he lay in his bed / and thought saint Gregory smote him on
the heed / and he waked and deyed anoe This was the third pope among the
popes the which is noted to deye a dredefull death B^^facyus the third was
pope after Saniniamus.viii. months. He ordained yt none but white clothes
should be put upon the awter^ Bonifacius the fourth was pope four year and
^viii. months / this man purchased of the Emperor Focas the church of
saint Peter of Rome should be the heed of all the church in the world. For
before Constantynople was the heed church. Also he gate lyce^ce yt the church
called Panton the which was dedy^ate to the honor of Neptunus and other falls
gods / where christian men many times were slain of deuylles / might be
dedicate to ye worship of all saints in heaven. This man ordained that monks
might use the office of prethynge / crystenynge / and confessing.

Heraclius was Emperor after Focas.xiii. year. And in the third year of his
regne. Cosdras the king of Perse burnt Iherusalem and other worshypfull
places. zachary the patryarke with other much people he took in captyuyte The
part of the holy cross / the which Eleyne left there he took with him in
to his country. But the.xii. year of Heraclius. Cosdras was slain of
Heraclyus and the cross was brought again / the people were delivered. And when
Heraclius would have entered the cytee proudely / the yates of the cite by power
of god shytte therself / and the Emperor meked him to god above and the yates
opened. And then was the feste of the exaltacyon of the cross made. Deus
dedit was pope after Bonifacius three year / this was an holy man. For on a
certain day when he kyssed a lyppre / anon the leppre was hole. This time a
Cyteyzin of London through ye mocyon of Ethelbryghte builded a church of saint
Peter in the west part of London / in a place that was called Thorneye.

Circa annu^ dn^i.vi.C.xliiii.
BOnyfacyus the fyfthe was pope after Deus dedit five year. The which ordened
that noman should be taken out of the chiccheyarde. And little else of him is
wryteu.

Nota Machomitum.
Machomite the duke of Sarrasyns and Turks was this time. And he was ye
dysseyuer of all the world / a faulse profete / ye messenger of the devil.
The forgooer of antecryst ye fulfyller of herecye / and of all falls men the
meruayllest^ Of whom the dominacyon thus began^ There was a certain famous
clerk at Rome and / could not speed in his matters yt desired to have speed in.
Thene he recedde from Rome over the sea and procured many a man to have gone
with him. Among whom was this Machomyte a great man of wit. And this clerk
promised him to make him duke of the country if he would be gyded after him
There he nouryssed a douue / and put all the corn that ye douue ete in
Machom^ ee^e and so this douue had never no meet but in his eere The foresaid
clerk on a day called the people and meued the^ to these such a p^^nce as
the holy ghost would show to them in likeness of a douue. And anon this clerk
secretly let flee this douue / the which after his old custom that he
wont to / fell anon to ye sholdyr of Machomyte and put his bylle in his eere.
And the people saw this / anon he was chose^ duke of that people of Corosame
/ he said that he was the very prophet of god Then he made a book of his
law that was called Alkaron. But he did it by Informacyon of three of his
masters. To whom the devil minystred the autoryte and the conning. The
first master was a Jew a great Astronomyer and a Nygramancer. The second
was John^ de Anthiochia. The thurde was Sergius an herytyke. And these three
made an ungracious law and an unhappy. And what someuer was hard of believe
and noyous to do / they left that out of the law / and they put that thing
in the law / the which the worldly men were prove and ready to do. That is to
say. Glotony / Lethery / repyne / and such other. And also this Machomyte
ordained that a man should have as many wives as he might occupye and find /
and refuse them twyes or thryes / or four times / and take them agayye / and
many meruayllous and falls things ht made in his law / the which were to
long to reherce here But they be plain in his book of. Alkaron^ And ever he
wrote in his book / that our lord spoke to. Machomyte his prophet / saying
on this wise / or on this. Thus by his false means he dysceyued the people.
And when his masters and he had made this that was so delectable. He wrote it
in a book with letters of golden And also he nourysshed a mighty camel
secretly in a pryue place / and alonly with ye hondes of. Machomyte was always
fed / and there pryuely he tied this book of the law that he had made about
the camels neck \ and put this camel forth on a time in to the field before
day. And this camel Ioyed in his lyberte for he was never lose before. And he
would suffer no man to come and touch him. And so there was a great fame of
such a camel / and the people ran to see him. Among whom was this
Machomyte. But when the camel saw him that had fed him al way. Anon he
ran unto him. And he had taught this camel before time to fall down on his
knees and lycke his hondes. And so he did before all that people. The people
then cried and said / that there was a very ensample yt he was the true
prophet of god. Then they prayed Machomyte to open that holy book with his
holy hondes / the which was sent from heaven ever more to be kept. In ye
which book is showed how the people shail worship god. And Machomyte said /
this book was written with angels hand / So by these falls means / he turned
to his law all the land of. Perse / and all the Eest Imperyall against.
Heraclium the Emperour^ And he occupied unto the end of Ale^dndre and Egypt.
Libya. Arabya and Siria. Then after he enfected all Affrycam. And but the
grace of god wythstode him / He had enfected all Spain and France. And many
other things he did which were to much to write in this book.

COnstantyne the third / the sone of Heraclii was Empour.xxvii. year. This
Constantyne was a great tyrant and a cursyd man / and an heretyke. Falls /
subtle / and odyous to christian men. Ne he gaaf no place to pope. Mertyne / and
he raised a great host against the Lombardes. And there he lost the field /
and fled unto Rome. And honorably was received of the pope Viteliianus / and
other of the the cite. And he rewarded not them like after their merytes as a
prince should have done. But used forth tyranny and heresye. wherefore at the
last he was slain of his own knights in a bath / the which would no longer
suffer his tyraunye. And so he wretchedly lived / and deyed unhappily. Martinus
the first was pope after Theodorum.vi. year. This Martynus was a very holy man
/ and ^rongely strove for the faith of god And when ^e ^ge mass oon a certain
day a^ the (...) / there pursewed him to slay* him a man yt was called
Spataryus of Olymphe. And when he would have smyten him / he was blind
suddenly. This same man called a Synody in the Cite of Rome: and dampened Syrum.
Alexandrun Sergium. Pyrum: and Paulum heretykes. wherefore. Constantyne the
Emperor exyled him: and he deyed a saint. Eugemus a Romayne was pope after
Martyne almoost three year: and was an holy man: but of him little acts is
written. Vitellianus was pope after him.xiiii. year. This man made the song
that the. Romans use: And accorded it also with the orgayns. And he also had
the grace of the emperor: the which was worth with his predecessors.
Nevertheless after ward he stood not i^ his concord. Ne hitherto I could not
find that ever the church of Rome. had fully after the death of.
Constantyne the mighty lordshyp of the cite and of other the which he yaue to
the church.

Anno dm^.vi.C.xliiii.
ADeodatus a. Romayne was pope after Vitellianus four year / and in his days
was translated the body of saint Benedictus / with the body of saint Scolastica
his sister fro the hylle of Cassyn unto ye monusterye of Floriecens nyghe
Aurelian. Consta^tyne the fourth was Emperor after his fader Constantyne the
cursyd man. This Constantyne was a good man and hated heretyk ^ over all
thing. The church he repeyred / and grace he recounsyled again to the
church ^ come and he with ye pope gadred together the.vi. general Synodus in
ye which was granted to prestes of Greece / for to use their leyfull wives /
and to the priests of ye Eest for cause of great he^e / but not to those of
the west party by no means For they (...)ytted chastyte in ye time of saint
Gregory. And every man may auertyse and prondre how much the goodness of a
prince is wroth / to the quyete state of ye church / and to the promocyon of
the faith / and also the contrary / how much the malice of a prince hurts
that thing. These two Constanyns the fader and the sone showed openly. For in
the faders days the church never had rest and in ye sons time it was quyete.
yet nevertheless our lord suffered the Sarrasyns and the Bulgars to enter in this
land / that he them might not with stand / but that he made his peace with
them / and paid to them yearly a truage / so nyghtely preuaylled that cursyd
sect of Machomyte / and after he deyed blessydly. Nota. That there were.vi.
general Synodus / and most pryncypall of the which the auctoryte is equal
to ye gospel for ye truth of the gospel is declared by them against the.vi.
pryncypall heresies the which strongely trowbled the church for the subtyltee
of these heretykes to dysceyue simple men. This time deyed Saint Cedde of
Lytchefelde / the third year of his bysshopryche. Demus a Romayne was pope
after Adeodatus three year. Of this man little is written. Bonyfacyus was pope
after him / and little of him is written / but that he lived ly^e a priest.
Agatho was pope after him / and he was a very holy man. For on a day when he
kyssed a lepre / the lepre anon was made hoole. Iste et de consensu princypys
iussit celebrari sextu^ sinodum apud constantinopolin.CC.lxxx. ep^orum. in qua
asseret duas naturas et duas voluntates esse in xp^o. Leo the second was pope
after Agatho three year / this Leo was an holy man and suffycyently taught in
latin and greek / this man ordained that the pax should be yeuen after agnus
dei / and dyed a blessed man. Benedictus the second pope after Leo almost
three year. This man above all thing was vertous and his name accorded with his
dedys. And in his time was a great pestylence. Iustinianus the second was
Emperor this time / and he was a very good man / a prudent and a large / and
he encreaced ye Empire of Rome myghtely / But he charged the office of the
church over much. Many laws he made / and after was not good he intended to
have let the dycrees of the.vi. Synodus / wherefore the.x. year of his. Empire
he was taken of Leo the prince of patrici^ and Tyberio / and they cut of his
nose and his tongue and exyled him to Crysona^. There was then turbacyon in the
church for strive and heretykes. And know all men when varyaunce falls
betwixt great lords Then errors ben multeplyed / for there is no man
corrected them / therefore that is often time preued in the cyirche. Then
after fell a varyaunce betwixt Leo and Tyberio. And Tybereo preuaylled / and
he exyled Leo / and cut of his nose the third year of his regne / and reigned
for hym^ Iustinianus fled to the Sarrasyns and the Bulgars / the which
restored him again to his Empre / and slew Leo and Tyberio / ye which favored
heretykes. Then this same Iustinianus reformed himself to the church of god
/ and had great repentance But he venged him to cruelly on his adversaries /
so that he would have slain the ^r Innocent childern Therefore he was slain
with his sone / of Phylyp whom he exyled.

Anno dm^.vi.C.lxxxiiii.
Johannes the fyfth was pope after Benedyctus too year / he was a good man /
but he decessyd aone. zeno was pope after him. And he was a very holy man / for
he would not meddle with seculer matters. And i^ beauty he was an angel / quyete
in virtues / and meke in soul and very demure in langage of his relygyous life
/ this man was chosen at the last with one accord of the church and lay men.
But there was a great distruccyon / for ye clergy intended to have chose Perys
ye Archebysshop. And the host of lay men would have had Theodorum a priest.
But at the last the holy gooste turned the will of all this people in to this
holy man. Sergius was pope.ix. year. This man was virtuous and comendable i^
his life. And in his eleccyon a great dyscorde was / for one party of the
clergy chose Theodoru^ / and an other party Paschalem. But as our lord
would at the last they turned all to this man. This man translated the body of
saint Leo. He also found a great part of the holy cross by miracle. And he
crystened Cad waldre the last king of Brytayne. He commanded (Agnus dei) to
be said or song thryes at mass. And decessyd blessydly. Nota. Saint Beda the
worshypfull preeste was this time a great man of fame in England / the which
was take the.vii. year of his aege to Benedycte the abbot Gyrwyen^ monastery to
be taught. And then after to Colfrido the abbot after the death of benedict.
And at the.xix. year of his aege he was made Deaken of ye bishop of york.
And at.xxx. year he was made priest / in the which year he began to write So
he continued all the time of his life in that monastry / in gyuynge his labors
to writing and scripture to be expowned. He made.lxxviii^ books / the which
he nombreth in the end of his Edglysshe book. This man was ever in labor
other in prayer or in singing daily in the church / or to learn teache or
write. For which thing men may Judge by reason that he was never at Rome /
all though some say he went to Rome that he might see yt his books accords
with the doctrine of ye holy church. But it was certain that he was blind /
and went to preche / and had a servant that was not good / and made him to
preche to a mighty multitude of stones and said / that they were men. And when
all his sermon was done / the stones answered and said Ame^. But that he went
to Rome thryes / and found written three arres / three effes / and expowned them
/ it was never found in no book of auctoryte. There was after the talkyng of
the people such a writing on the yates of Rome (RRR. FFF) And such an
exposycyon (Regna Rome Ruent. Ferro Flama Fame) But it is certain that Beda
was desired to come to Rome by the writing of sergius the pope to Colfrido his
abbot. And this Beda translated the gospel of saint Johan in to English
tongue / and dyssessyd blessydly. The fame says that now he lies at Deuelyn
with Saint Curberte / and there is buried with him the knowledge of the deeds of
England almoost to ye conquest. Leo the second was Emperor / and little of
him is written. Liberius was Emperor after him.vii. year / he rose against Leo
and entered his kingdom / and kept him in prison as long as he reigned In this
time Iustinianus the second which in old time was exyled to Crysonam openly
said / he would recover his Empire again. wherefore the people of that country
/ for the love of Liberius / were about to slay that Iustinianus. wherefore he
fled to the prince of Thurcorum and wedded his sister. And thorugh help of
his brother and the Bulgars he recovered his Empire and slew Liberius and Leo
the vsuper of his reame And as many times almoost as he wyped any drope from
his nose / the which they kytte of / so many times he made one of his enmyes
to be slain Leo the third was pope after Sergius two year. This man was made
pope by the power of the Romans and was not put in the nombre of popes / for
the evil entered / but he did none evil. Johannes the.vi. was pope after him
a Greek. And he was a martyr / but of whom and wherefore the cause is not
found in hystoryes. It is said / yt it was of the dukes of Lambardy for they
were enmyes to the church myghtely. Johannes the.vii. a Romayne was pope after
him three year / but no thing of him is written. Iustinianas was Emperor again
with his sone Tyberius.vi. years. And this was he the which was reued the
Empire before by Leo / And when this man was restored again he took him to the
right faith / and worshypped the pope Constantyne. And certainly he destroyed
Creson the place where he was exyled unto / and all that dwelled in it / except
the chyldern he slew them / And he came again an other time to have slain the
Innocents. And the men of that country made them a capytayne / a certain man
that was called Philyp an outlawe / yt which anon went to him in battle /
and slew him for his outragyous cruelnesse against those chyldern. Sysinnius
was pope twenty days / and then was great strife / and he decessyd \ but
little of him is written. Constantine was pope after him vii. year. This man was
a very meke man and so blessed / that of all men he was beloved. He went over
the sea to Iustinianus the Emperor / and was received with great honor / and
deyed a blessed man. Philyp ye second was Emperor one year / the which
fled in to Scicilis for the host of the Romans And he was an heretyke / and
commanded all pyctures of saints for to be bestroyed. wherefore the Romans
cast a way his coin / ne would not receive no money that his name or image
were written upon Anastasius thseconde after he had slain Philyp was Emperor
three year. This man was a christian man / and helyued well. But by cause he put
out phylipis eyes / and slew him after ward. And therefore Theodosius faustht
against him and overcame him / And then he was made a priest / and lived so
quyetly.

Anno dm^.vii.C.xiiii.
GRegoryus the second was pope after Constantyne.xvii. year / this Gregoryus
was a chaste man and a noble man in scripture And about this time the popes
began to deal more temporally with the Emperors than they were wont for
their falsnesse and their he resye. And also for to remeue thempyre fro oo
people to an other as the time required / this man cursyd Leo ye Emprrour by
cause he bre^te the images of saints. This same Leo commanded / Gregorius the
pope yt he should brenne chirches and destroy them. And he set no thing of
his saying / but commanded the cou^trary manly. And so it is openly showed /
yt the destruccyon of the Empire of Rome / was the cause of heresy. For
certaynely faithful people with the prelates with one will / drew to the pope
and constrained the Emperors for to leave their tyranny and their heresye. And
this time in the eest part of ye world strongly faylled the very faith / for
that cursyd law of the false Machomete^ Theodosius was Emperor and reigned but
one year And he was a very christian man / and even as he did so was he done
unto. For Leo deposyd him and made him a priest. Leo ye third with Constantyne
his sone was Emperor.xxv. year this Leo when he was mighty he deposyd
Theodosyus and reigned for him / and was desceyned by a certain Apostata / the
which badde him yt he should take and brenne all the images of saints.
wherefore he was punysshed both in battle and in pestylence / and with other
Infortunes. And by cause he was accursyd of Gregoryus / and bode there in three
days / therefore the pope with ye common people took for him the best part of
his Empire / co^mau^dynge yt no man should obey him ne socour him / by cause he
lived like an heretyke. Holy men said against him. And many by him were marted
and exyled. And at ye last in his misbyleue he deyed wretchedly. and in this
manes days / but that Karolus Marcellus help the Christian faith / and faught
manly nyenst the Sarrasyns / and drove them backewarde in Spain the which
they had subdued else they had entered in to France. And Karolus slew three
hundred thousa^de Sarasyns and moo^ And of his people were slain but.xv.
thousand. Nota. This man for the contynuall battle took to lay men the
tresoure of the church. wherefore Saint Eucharius the bishop of Aurelian / as
he was in his prayers / saw that same Karolus in soul and body payned in
hell. And the angel that showed the bishop this man said. That yt was the
Judgment of all those that took a way the goods of the church / or of poor
men. And to fortifye that / that the bishop said and ^ue it / the abbote of
saint Deuys went to the sepulcre there that Karolus was burye^ (...) opened
the cheste that he lay in And there th^^ see a great dragon go out but he had
no (...) Gregorius the third a Romayne (...) pope after Gregoryus the second.
The (...) confermed the woorshyppes of the (...) saints / with ye counsel
almooste of a thou^^^de bishops. And he cursyd horrybly all the despyers of
these images. As the Emperor and other that were of ye condycyon. Constan^nus
the fyfth was Emperor a^te: his (...) Leo.xxxv. year He was a cursed man and a
p^^e heretyke / to yt he did sacrefyse to the deuylles He pursued the church.
And (...) is good of him is written. And so by ye ^ce of god the church was
trowbled long t^me. About this time were many maruayl^es and there were
merueyllous earth quakys. And certain cytees that were set on mountayns they
were remeued and borne away with ye hills in to the feldes.vi. mile thens as
they stood and the cytees were not broken ne hurt In the land of Mesopotanian
the earth was broken by the space of two mile / And also there was a mule that
spoke in a man's voys. Ashes fell fro heaven And in the sea of Poncico there
was yse for great froste that was.xxx. cubytes of thykenesse. And the sterres
fell fro heaven so myghtely that men trowed that ye end of the world had be
comen. All these betokened meruaylus things for to come.

Anno dm^.vii.C.xliiii.
Acharias was pope after Gregorius. x. year. This zacharis was a noble man and
arrayed with all virtue / with all men he was loved for his mekeneste. And he
deposyd the king of France Hydery / and put in his place Puppynus / for he
was more profitable. Here may ye see what power the thyrche had yt time / the
which translated that famous kingdom fro ye very heirs / to ye kingdom of
Pippinus / for a leyfull cause ( Vthab^t.xv. q. v. alius) Stephanus the second
a Romayne was pope after zacharyas.v. year. This man in all thing was
profitable unto the church / as well in word as in doctrine And he governed
the spyrytualtee and the temporaltee noble. He was the lover and the defender
of poor men. This man anointed Pyppynus the king of France / and sent him
against the Lombardes / that he should compel them to restore the church of
such goods as they had with hold from them long time vnryghtwys^y the
which he did. He also translated the Empire of the Greeks to ye Frensshemen.
Paalus a Romayne was pope after him.x. year. This was a very holy man / for he
did great alms to fadlesse chyldern and prisoners wydowes / and other poor
men / yt he might be a follower of saint Poule Constantyne a Romayne the second
was pope after Poul two year. This Constantyne was a lay man and suddenly was
made a priest / as a tyrant / and took on him the dygnytee of the pope. And
with a great slau^dre to the church was pope a little time. But the faithful
men put him out / and put out his eyes. And this was the fyfth Infamed pope /
among so many herd tofore. So the holy ghost ye holy apostels sete kepyin al
honor and holiness Infynyte martyrs were made this time by Constantyne ye
emperor for he was such an heretyke. And men trow that there was never
Emperor ne no pagon that slew so many martyrs^ And in his time the church
was trowbled full sore / and very precyously bought the worshyppynge of the
images of the holy saints / for the great shedynge of blood of martyrs. And
certainly ye cursyd Emperor was not unpunished. For when that he deyed he
cried with an horrible voys and said. I am taken to a fire / yt is unable for
to be destroyed. And so he yielded up the ghost to everlasting pain. The
Empire of rome was divided about this time For Stephanus the pope translated
ytaly and other unto Karolus a young man. And Constantyne held the land of
Greece with other lands over the sea with a great labor and many rebellynge.
This time Karolus magnus was a noble young man. And he began for to regne upon
France / and was the sone of Pippinus / and his mother was called Berta^
Stephanus the third was pope after Paulus three year. And he amended all the
errors of Constantyne. And he degarded all those the which Co^stantyne
ordained in a general Synodus.

Anno dm^.vii.C.lxxxiiii.
ADrianus a Romayne was pope after Stephanus.xxiiii. year. This man was
myghtely worshypped of the people / no man greter before him in honor / riches
/ and buyldyng. This man set two solemn Syno^is. The first of the three
hundred and fyfty faders The second in Rome with an hundred and fyfty faders
being present Charles the king of France / to whom it was granted the
lyberte of eleccyon of the popes and to ordeyne the appostles sete. Leo the
fourth reigned Emperor with the Greeks five year This Leo was a cursyd man /
but not so much as his fader was. And he was a covetous man / and he took a
way a certain crown of a church and put it upon his heed. And anon^ he was
corrupted with an axes and sore deseased. And he had a cursed wife / yt which
reigned after him with her sone. Constantyne was Emperor after Leo / and he
was a meke man / and put a way his mother fro the kingdom / that she might take heed unto her wymmens work. But she with a feigned rancour put out his eyes
after ward and his childern also / and reigned again three year. And at ye last
she was about for to have be wedded And when the Greeks perceived that she would
be wedded to great Karolus / they took her and shytte her up in a monastery /
and took Nychoferum to be their Emperor. The.v. vnyuershall study the which
in old time was translated from Anthenes unto Rome / about this time was
translated to Paris / by Karolus king of France. Nychoferus was Emperor
after Constantyne. He was a very nygon / and was exalted to his Empire by the
Grekys But he profyted not / for i^ his time all ye E^st Imperyall was brought
to naught. For the Romans put them under Karolus magnus Jerusalem about this
time was recovered by Karolus / with all the holy land. And the sect of the
Sarrasyns was destroyed strongly^ For the struccyon of wretches came then^e
Michael was Emperor two year / and he was a very christian man / and he was well
beloved / and also he was connyge in all scyences. And tho that Nychaferus had
hurt and drestressyd of their goods by his coueytousnesse / this Mychaell
restored them and made them rich again. Nota. Karolus. magnus the first saint
was Emperor after Michaell. And he was crowned Emperor by Leo the pope /
from the which time the Empire was translated from the Greeks to France and
Germane. And for the translacyon of that Empire / the Greeks always were
defectyue unto the Romans And the Greeks strove ever more with them. But it
was more with venomous words thanne with strenghthe / and more with craft
thanne with batayyll. For they had so great envy at the Romans / that they
would not obey ye church of Rome. For certainly when that the popes would
write unto them / for to obey the church of Rome / they wrote again and
said. ye have taken from our kynrede the Empire / and therefore we would not
obey / And we us take from you / And for this noble Emperor Rarolus it is to
be understand / this man when he was a young man / he was anointed king of
France by Stephanus ye pope. In the year of our lord Ihesu Christ.vii.
hundred.liiii. when his fader Pippinus lived. Under whom / and with whom he
reigned ^xv. year unto the death of his fader. Then after his fader under the
year our lord god vii. hundred.xlviii. This Karolus with his brother
Karolomannus reigned two year. And then his brother deseased in the second
year. And this Karolus there held all the hoole kingdom.xiiii. year / to the
year of our lord.vii. hundred.lxxxiiii. In ye which year he went to Rome /
that he might be crowned Emperor of the pope Adrianus. And he reigned
emperor.xvi. year / to the year of our lord.viii.C. when pope* Leo confermed
him again the Emperor. And after that he was Emperor xiiii. year. And he
dysseased in the year of his aege.lxxii. The which was the year of our
lord.viii.C. and.xiiii. if ye will see more of Karolus / goo to the book of
Turpinus and Libraminus his master / for they wrote his noble acts. Leo the
fourth was pope after Adrianus.xx. year / this man when he went on a certain
day with the Lentany to saint Peter's church on Saint Marks day / he was
taken with cursyd people / and both his eyes put out and his tongue cut of
But our lord merueylously restored him again his sight and his speech / so
that he spoke without tongue and saw by miracle. Afterward he went with
Karolus in France. And he came with him unto Rome / and venged the pope on his
enmye. And then he crowned Karolus. And he late before crowned / confermed him
again. Lodouicus the meke the first begoten sone of Karolus was Emperor
after his fader.xxvi. year / in whose time was put a way that clerks should
use no gyrdes with precious stones / ne strange arayment. This Ludouicus of
his first wife gate two childern and both had an evil end. In all thing that
went against him he was pacyent / and in the last end he ever over ca^e. For
against god he abode devout. And his childern followed him in co^dycyons / he
dyssessyd a blessed man. Stephanus the fourth was pope after Leo three year.
This Stephanus redeemed many captyue men / and crowned Lodouicus ye Emperor.
And then^e he dyssessyd and was buried at Rome. Paschall was pope after
Stephanus. This Paschall was a great dylygence to relyques of Saints. And he
took up Innumerable bodies of saints / and buried them worshypfully as in the
vysyon of saint Cecile he was commanded. Eugenius the fourth was pope after
Paschall / and he was a very holy man. And all those things that were for
christ he took head to. This man was crowned a martyr / and by the lay men of
Rome he was buried in saint Peter's chyrcheyerde.

Circa annu^ on^i.viii.C.xliiii.
VAlentinus was pope after Eugenius xl. days / and little of him is written.
Gregorius the fourth was pope after him xii. year / this Gregorius saw many
heavy times / for the plages among the common people And at this man's
petycyon. Lodouicus the Emperor / and Marcio the prince of Lombardy exyled al
ye Sarrasyns fro ytaly. And at the last he dyssessed after Innumerable good
deeds and works yt he had done at saint Peter's. Lotherius the first sone of
Ludouicus was Emperor.xv. year in ytaly and Rome and the parties of Germayne
next to the hills of. Alpy. This Lotherius rose against his brother Ludouicus
and. Karolus for the kingdom of Duchelonde / the which some time Pyppynus
their brother held. And they fought at a place called Fomanecu^ / where
Lotherius was dyscomfyted. And there was such slaughter made oon both the
sides / that they had no men for to resyste their adversaries. This understood
a falls christian man / and sent unto Soudan of the Sarrasyns yt he should come
anon. And he took Rome / and saint Peter's church was made a stable for their
horses. But Ludouycus with the Frenshemen and Lombardes all ye Infynyte nombred
destroyed / and that with great shedynge of christian blood. Sergius ye second
was pope after Gregorius two year. This man was called first. (os porci) in
English / hoggesmouth. where fore yt man and all the popes names are changed
when they are chosen And yt for three causes. The first for Christ changed the
names of those men yt which he made popes. The second / for as much as they
are changed in the name / should they be changed in perfectyon of life / The
third leest he which is chosen to an exceeding degree should he hurt in
name. Leo was pope after Sergius. viii year. This Leo was an holy man / and
also he was in prudence as sharp as a serpente / and in his deeds as meke as a
douue. And he was brought forth virtuously in a monastery And when that he was
made pope / he labored to repeyre his chirches again / the which false
Sarrasyns one after an other had destroyed. This man was a mighty writer and a
great precher / and myghtely labored in watch and prayer and so deyed / and
was buried and lies at saint Peter's. Benedictus a Romayne was pope after Leo
two year. This Benedictus had the name of ye thing. For in all thing he was
blessed. This man ordained ye clerks should go ordynatly and honesty. Ludouicus
the sone of Lotherius was Emperor this time / and anointed of Sergius the pope
/ and a while reigned with his fader / and after reigned.xxi. year alone. This
man had a sone ye high Karolus / in to whom the devil entered and vexed him a
fore his fader. And then^e he conspyred his faders death And in his time many a
meruaylle fell. Nota. Johannes Anglicus of the nacyon of Maguncin about this
time was pope / and she was a woman arrayed in man's garments. But she
profyted so in holy scripture that there was found none like her Then^e she
was chose^ pope / but after ward she was with child. And when she should have
gone openly in processyon / she traveled and decessyd. And this is the sixte
pope / the which to this time had the name of holiness / and were vycyous And
this person as other popes were was punyssed of god / ne she was not nombred
in the book of popes. Nicholaus a Romayne was pope after this woman.ix. year.
This Nicholaus was of great holiness / that there was no man comparable to him
after ^ Gregory ye pope. And when he was made. Ludouicus the Emperor was
present. And after he decessyd a very good man and was buried in saynte^
Peter's chyrcheyerde. Adrianus a Romay^ was pope after Nicholaus. This Adrianus
cursed Lotherius brother to the emperor ye king of Lotharynge for his aduoutry.
But wha^ he came to Rome to excuse him of his aduoutry / he said that he was
cursyd wrongfully. And he brought with him all the noble men of his regyon / and
all were deed within one year and the king deyed in the way when he came to
the ^yte of Placenciam.

Anno dm^.viii.C.lxxiii. Of king Alured / and how the Danys in his time prayed
him of mercy that they might goo out of the land. This time came the Danys in
to England.


AFter the death of this Eldred reigned his brother Alured that Dolfynes was
called. Tho went the Danys and assembled them / And went for the to seek
Alured yt tho was king new made of Southsex / and there they found him at
wylton with a little people / And nevertheless he faught with them / but at
the last he fled thens from the field / and went in to westsex and ordained
so much people of his own reame / and also of other till that he had a
strong host so that the Danys had no power against him to withstand. And
he came to London with his host / and there were the Danys soionrned. And
there he would have foughten with them. But ye Danys durst not with him fight
/ but prayed him of peace / and that they might goo again in to their own
country / and never to come in to England again / that is to say any harm
for to do And upon this covenant they should give him to pledge good hosta^es
and such as the Englysshmen would are.

How Hubba and Hungar were slain at Chyppenham / and how the Danys brought
their king to our king.
ANd the same day that the Danys departed from London / so fast they rode
both nyghe and day / and never took rest of going till that they came unto
Excestre / and took tho the town / and there held them. When king Alured
herd these rydynges / anon he let take the hostages / and went from thens
unto Excestre with all the power that he had / And when the Danys herd tell
of his coming / they went from thens unto westsix / and came unto Chyppenham
/ and there they did much harm in the country / they robbed folk / and
brough them in prison. The king Alured them pursewed and came upon them right
soon and fyersely them assailed. And there were slain both Hubba and Hu^gar
his brother / and Buerne Bocader. And in this bataylle were much folk slain
in that one and in that other. But the gre^ of that field bode with the Danys /
for as much as the king came with few folk. The king hasted him as much as
he might for to goo again. And when the Danys found Hubbaes body lyeng deed
they buried it / and laid upon it a great logge / and let call it Hubeslowe /
and so it is called unto this day. And that place is in Deuenshyre. The
Barons of Somerset^ wyltshyre and dorset herd tell how that their king was
dyscomfyted and ordained all the power that they might have and came to the
king there he was / and thanked god that they him yet found alive / for they
had wend that ye Danys had him slain. Tho took they a counseyll the king
and his barons / that would go and seek the Danys with them for to fight. And
so they rode all and night them for to seek and came on the morrow about
Pryme to Abyndon there that the Danys were. The king Alured and his barons to
assembled and there assaylled the Danys egerly / and there yaue them a stonge
battle. And the Danys put them a long time that no man wist whether part
more people were slain. But this it befell as god would that the king Alured
had the victory with much honor. For the Danys were so driven that ne wist
whyther for to torn. And.xv. days the ^yng them pursewed at his will / that
gladly and ^ayne they were for to speak of peace and accord / and took him good
hostage / and said they would never more upon him war ne no debate arere. And
more over they behyght unto the king Alured / that they would go and b^ynhe
their own king unto him and that their king and they all should be baptized.
And upon this condycyon king Alured grant them life and lymme. And said unto
them / that they should gone their king for to seek / and at a certain day
to come again yt to them was set. And so they went forth fast and came again
at a day that to them was assygned^ And all ye Danys brought their king with
them. The king Alured anon let them ^e baptized / and their names changed.
And so the king of Denmark was called Athelstone And.xxx. of his fellows
names were changed also / and the other were baptized to the right believe. And
all this was done at westmestre. And after that king Alured held with him
king Athelstone and all his Danys.xii days at soiourne with much solempnyte
/ and yaue th^^ great yeftes. And after that they were baptized and so
departed. Tho was king Alured all at ease / when he had his enmyes over
comen / and that they were turned to ye right by leave of god almighty.

How the Danys that came in to France with Gurmonde came again in to England
/ and of the death of king Alured.
ANd thus it befell after ward / that the Danys of Northumberlonde yt were
paynems came with a great strength and an huge host of France / that is to
understood \ with them that went in to France with Gurmonde of Affyke / when
he had conquered England and yaue it unto ye Saxons. And tho yt came fro
France arrived in Kent and sent in to Northumberlonde that they should come to
them / and when those two hosts were come and assembled / anon they yede to
destroy all the christian people of England from place to place / and did
much sorrow. It befelle thus as almighty god would an hard chance in to
England. For the good king alured yt was wont to abate ye Danys deyed ^n the
mean time. This king Alured reigned.xxx. year / and a good king had he and
well could chastyse his enmyes. And also he was a good clerk / and let make
many books and a book he made in English of adventures of kings / and of
bataylles that had been done in the land / and many other books of Gestes he
let them write that were of great wisdom and of good learning / through
which books many a man may him amend / that woll them read and upon them
look / Upon whose soul almighty god have marcy. And this king Alured lies at
wynchestre.

IOha^nes the.viii. was pope after Adryan.viii. year. This Johannes anointed
Karolus the Emperor. And he suffered great wrong of ye Romans for he favored
not ye said Emperor. And therefore he put the said pope in keeping. Also he
degarded the bishop of Portuense / the which was ye occasyon of all his
sorrow. Karolus ye second was Empour after Ludouicus. This Karolus had a
brother the which was called Ludouicus / and he was the king of Germayne / and
he ordained battle against his brother / but karolus or they faughte was
poysened. And he made many a monasterye. Martynus was pope after Ioha^nes one
year. This Martynus little profyted for he lived but little time. Adrianus ye
third was pope after him oo year. And of him is no thing wrynten. Stephanus
the fyfth was pope after him.vi. year. And no thing of him in written / but yt
he translated the body of saint Martyn. Karolus the third was Emperor after
the second.xii. year. This Karolus had in possessyon peassyble all France and
all Germayne / and was crowned Emperor of Ioha^nes the pope. And after this
glorious vyctory / he turned all Normandye to the faith of god almighty / and
he might no more recyste the Frenshemen but four year he reigned on them / He was
unprofitable to them / and therefore they put him a way. Arnulphus was emperor
after Karolus.xiii. year. This Arnulphus utterly constrained the Norma^s the
wyiche destroyed the Frenshemen.xl. year Then he was syke and had no
comfort of no leche / for he was i^ a meruayllous sykenesse / so that he was
consumed with life and was deed. Formosus was pope after Stephanus.v. year /
this man first was bishop of Portuensys. And pope John^ was depryued for his
Inobedyence / and was degrated to the lay fee. But by Martyn ye pope he was
restored. And against his oath / he came not aloonly to Rome but to offer him
the dygnyte of the pope / for yt which there was great alteracion. Bonfacius
the.vi. was pope.v. days. Stephanus the.vi. one year and three months.
Johannes three months and.xii. days. Iona also three months and twelve
days. Theodorus the second twenty days. Johannes the enleue^th was two year
and.xv. days. Benedictus the fourth a year and two months. Leo the fourth
was.xl. days. Xpristoforus the first.vii. months. All these.viii. popes
were but little time / and therefore we can not tell of them none notable
things / But if we should write sclau^dre of them that might be fon^de / for
ye vnharde strife and contencion in that holy appostles sete. For one strove
against an other / and repreued the deeds of an other. And for to tell how they
strove / it were no great honor to show for ye holy appostles sete.
Lodouicus the third was emperor after Arnulphus.vi year. This man had not ye
popes blessing / for the unstableness of them yt which reigned in ytaly^ And
he was constreyned to expulse Berynge. And this man was ye last Emperor of
all the kynred of Karolus king of france. This time the Empire was remeued
and translated and dyuyded. For the Frenshemen halpe not the church / the
which their faders had edifyed and fortefyed / but destroyed / ne halpe not ye
Romans against Lombardes / the which vexed the Romans right sore. Therefore by
the comyns assente they were excluded fro the Empire / and the ytalyens began
to be Emperor in ytaly / and the Almayns in Almayne / until Ottanen the
which reigned in both the places. The Frenshemen were constrained to abide in
their own country / and no more to be emperor for their mysheuous living.
Beringarius the first. Conradus and Beryngarius the second / and Hugo were
Emperors after Lodouicus But they are not nombred among the Emperors. For
some were but in Almayne / and some were in yralye.

Of king Edward that was king Alucedes sone.
ANd after this Alured reigned his sone Edward / and was a good man and a wise
/ that was called Edward / and was wonder curteys. The danys did much sorrow
in the land / and their power encreaced and began for to were from day to
day. For the Danys came often with their companyes in to this land. And when
the king saw that he might no better do / then he took peace with them
granted them this trewes. And nevertheless the trewes dured not long that
the Danys ne began strongly for to war upon the Englysshmen and did them
much sorrow. wherefore king Edward did assemble a great host for to fight
with them And then this king Edward deyed when god would. This king Edward
reigned.xxiiii. year / and lies at wynchestre beside his fader.

himself. And for to avenge and work his exyle / he took out the body of pope
Formosus where that he was buried. And arryed him in the popes arraymente and
caused him to be heeded and to be cast in the water of Tybre by Rome / Then
fysshers found him and brought him in to the church. And the holy images of

the time that Arthur was gone / and never was sythen king of his power. And
this Edgar was saint Edwardes fader. And when Edgars wife was deed yt was saint
Edwardes mother and entryd / he herd speak of the fayrnesse of Estrylde / that
was Orgarus daughter a baron of Deuenshyre that was so fair a woman / that all
men did speak of her. He called one of his knyhhtes that he much loved and
trusted upon and told him. Go^ said he to the noble baron Orgarus of
Deuenshyre / and see if that his daughter be fair as men speak of / and if it
be sothe I will have her unto my wife. This knight that was called Edelwolde
went forth his way as the king him had said / and came there that the lady

thereof spoke to Grgarus her fader. And her fader was an old man and no man
chyldern but oonly her / and saw yt Edelwode was a fair young knight with the
king / and thought his daughter should well be married and be set upon him /
and granted him his daughter if the good lord ye king would consent thereto.
And then this Edel would came again unto the king and cold him / that she
was fair enough upon to see / but she was wonder lothly. Tho answerede the

said the king. I consent thereto. Edel would tho thanked the king right

country he dwelled. And thus it befell upon a time / that he told his
counsel and all this thing unto his wife / how and in what manner he had
begyled his lord the king that would have had her to wife. And anon as she
it wist / she loved him never more after ward as she did before. This lady
conceived by him a sone. And when time wan that the child should be borne.
Edelwolde came to the king and prayed him to have a sone of his at the font
stone. The king him granted / And let call him Edgar after his own name.
And when this was done he thought that all was syker enough for the king /
that he would not take his wife for as much as his lord was a Ioly man and an
amerous.

How that king Edgar wedded Estrylde after the death of Edel wolde^
THus it befell that all men in king Edgars court then^e spoke and said / yt
Edel would was rychely auaunced / through the foresaid marriage of his wife. And
yet they said he was auaunced an hundred fold more^ For he had spowsed the
most fairest creature yt ever seen. And ye king herd speak so much of her
beauty / yt he thought he would have him dysceyued / and begyled. And thought
pryuely in his heart / that he would goo into Deuenshyre / as it were for to
hunte for the heart and for ye hynde and other wild beestes / and then^e he
should see there the lady or he departed thens. And this lady was dwelling at
manner place beside the forest / there that the king would hunte / And a^ that
manner he was her borrowed all night. And when time came that the king should
suppe / and the son shone / the king asked after his gossyppe and after his
godsone^ And Edelwolde made her to come before the king And nevertheless if
it other wise might have be she should not have come in his sight by his will.
The lady welcome^ the king and swetely him kyssed. And he took her by ye hand
/ and to next by him her sa^te / and so souped they together. And there was a
custom and an usage in this land that time. That so when on drake to an other

Drink hayll. And this did the king and the lady / and kyste many times. And
after supper when time was for to go to bed / the king went to bed / then

love / that him thought that he should deye / but if he had his will on her.
Upon the morrow the king aroos and in the foreest went him for to dysporte
with hearts and hyndes and all other wild beestes. and of the hertes great
plente he sense to ye lady. And thryes he went for to solace and to speak with
that lady the whiles he dwelled there in that country. And after that the king
remeued thens / and thought him how he might best deliver Edelwod fro his wife
/ as he had him first desceyued. And the king anon after.viii. days
ordained a parlyament at salysbury of all his baronage counseyll to have. And
for to ordeyne how the country of Northumberlonde should best he kept that
the Danys came not there / the land for to destroy. And this Edelwode came
unto the kings parlyament. And the king sent him to york / for to be keeper
of that country. And thus it befell that knew him not slew him by the way.
And anon as the king herd tell that he was deed / he let send after the
lady E^^^ylde that he should come unto the cite of London and there he wedded to
the king with great solempnyte and worship. And held a solemn feast. And he
ware a crown yt was of gold and the queen an other. And saint Dunstane on the

an^ the queen togyders. And sayn^ Dunstane axed the king who she was / And the
king answered and said / yt she was the queen E^^yllde. And the Archebyssop
saint Dunstance said that he did great wrong / and against gods will to
take a woman to wife whose child ye had take at font stone. And ye queen for
that word never loved saint Dunstance after. And the good man warned of that
folly to be left / but it auaylled but little / for the love between them was
so much. The king begat upon her a sone that was called Eldred^ when this
child was.vi. year old / the king his fader deyed. And about that time he
had reigned.xvii. year / and lies at Glastenbury.

an other king karolus for he was the defender of the church of god / and the
syngular promoter for the which he was worthy to be Emperor Many men of falls
believe he converted And he held with him pope Benedictus the usurper of the
popeherd in to Soxony. And there he decessyd in his exyle. And this Emperor
decessyd a rich man in virtue and goodness. Otto the second was Emperor after
his fader. And he was a noble man to the church as his fader was. And many a
battle he had against the false men of believe. And at the last he almoost lost
all his host in Kalabur / yet for sothe with all his mind besought saint
Peter to help. And meruellously saint Peter delivered him And his wife was the
daughter of ye Emperor of Constantynopolytan of the Romans blood And this man
was crowned of Benedictus the pope.

Of saint Edward the martyr how Escrylde his stepmoder let kylle him / for
to make Eldred her own sone king.
ANd after this Edgar reigned Edward his sone / that he begat upon his first
wife / that will and nobly governed the land. For he was full of all manner of
goodness and led a full holy life. And above all thing he loved god and holy
church. And the queen Escrylde that was his stepmoder let slay him by cause
to make her own sone Eldred king. And this on a day he was slain / as ye
shall here afterward. It befell thus upon a day that tha^ king Edward went
in to a wood for to play / in the southe country be side a town that is
called warham. In yt which foreste was great pleyntye of hearts and hyndes.
And when he had been while there him for to play he thought upon his brother
Eldrede that was with his mother the queen / for her place waste nygh the
foreste / and thought for to goo thither and vysyte and see his brother. And
took with him but a little meyne / and went him toward his stepmoders house /
that in that time soiourned in the castle of Corfe. And as he read in ye
thyckensse of a wood is speye his game / it befell that he went amysse and
lost his meyne that with him came. And at the last he came out of the wood.
And as he lo^d him about / he saw there there fast besides a ^e that his
stepmoder dwelled in / and thither ward he went alone And anon it was told
the queen / how that the king was comen alone with out any company. And
therefore she made Joy enough / and thought how that she might do that he were
slain as pryuely as she might / called to her one of her knights. To whom
she had told much of her counseyll between them. And both they came to the
king and curteysly him received. And the king told that he was come to
vysyte / and also for to speak with Eldred his brother The queen many times him
thankyd. and him prayed for for alyght / and her borugh with her al yt night
The king said / that he might not. But again he would goo unto his folk / if
he might them find. And when the queen saw that he would not abide / she
prayed him that he would ones drink / and he granted her. And anon as the
drink was come / the queen drank unto the king. And the king took the
cup and set it to his mouth. And in the mean while that he drank / the
false knight yt was with ye queen with a knyfe smote the king unto the heart.
and there he fell down deed unto the earth of his palfroy. The queen for this
deed gave the knight gold and silver great plente and of other riches enough
And the knight anon as this was done went him over the sea. And so escaped he
out of this land. When this king Edward was thus martred. It was in the year
of the Incarnacyon of our lord Ihesu Christ.ix.C.lxxx. And he had reigned.xii.
year and an half / and lies at Glastenbury.

Of the king Eldred / and how the king Swyne of Denmake held England. and
how Eldred that saint Edwardes brother was not beloved in his Realm / and
therefore he fled in to Normandye.
SO after this Edward reigned Eldred his brother. And saint Dunstane crowned
hym^ And this saint Dunstane deyed soon after that he had foryeuen the queen
her trespa^s / by cause that she was cause of king Edwardes death. And saint
Dunstane had her assoylled / and penance had her ^^oyned. And she lived
after a chaste life and a clean. This king Eldred wedded an English woman /
and on her begat Edmonde Irensyde and an other sone that was called Edwyne.
And after deyed the queen their mother. And in that time came Swyne in to
England that was king of Denmark / for to challenge and to conquer all that
his auncetrees had before that time. And so he conquered and had it all his
axyng. For the good earl Cuthberte of Lynd eseye and all the people of
Northumberlonde / and almoost all the greece of England held with Swyne that
was king of Denmark / for so much as they loved no^ king Eldred / for by
cause that his good brother Edward was slain for love of him. And therefore no
man set but little by him. wherefore king Swyne had all his will / and took
all the land. And Eldred the king fled the in to Normandye. And so spoke
to the duke Richard / that the duke yaue him his sister Emme to wife Upon the
which he gate two sons that one was called Alured and that other Edward. And
when Swyne had conquered all the land / he reigned nobly and lived.xv. year and
then he deyed and lies at york.

How king Eldred came aye^ from Normandy / and how knoght the Dane reigned /
and of the war betwixt him and Edmonde Irensyde.
THus after ye death of Swyne that was a Dane. Knoght his sone dwelled in
England / and would have been king. And tho came again Eldred out of
Normandye with much nombre of people / and with a strong meyne that Knoght
durst not abide / but fled thens in to Denmark. The king Eldred had again
his reame / and held so great worship / that he began for to destroy all tho
that halpe Swyne that was a Dane ayenste him. And afterward came again this
Knoghte from Denmark with a great power / so that king Eldred durst not with
him fight but fled from thens unto London / and there he held him. Tho came
Knoght and him besyeged so long / till that king Eldred deyed in the Cytee of
London / and lies at saint Poules. And he reigned.ix. year.

BOnu^ was pope after Benedictus one year. This man abode but a little time
Bonifacius was pope after him five months. Benedictus was pope after him.x.
year / This man crowned Otto the seedde / and made many Romans to be taken And
he gadred a counseyll against the king of France / where Gylbert the
Nygramancer was deposed. Johannes the ^xiiii. was pope after him.viii.
months. And he was put in the castle Angel / and was famyned to death.
Johannes the.xv. was pope after him four months. Johannes the.xvi. was pope
after him almoost.xi. year. This man was taught in arms / and made many books
/ and else little of him is written. Gregorius the.v. was pope after this man
almoost three year. And this Gregorius was made pope at the Instaunce of the
Emperor Otto third / for he was his consyn / And when he had be a little
while pope / and the Emperor receded from the cite of Rome. Placentinus was
put in by Crecensius a Counsul for money / And then was strife a few days.
But the Emperor came soon after / and took Crecensius the Consul / and
stroke of his heed / and put out the eyes of this man Placencius pope / ye
which put out his cosyn of the dignyte of the pope* And maimed him on other
members / his knights ne his dukes halpe him no thing. For he did that
thing that he should not have done. And he suffered that that he deserved.
Nota. This Gregorius with the Emperor Otto ordained the chesers of the Empire
/ the which from thens forth has a bode unto this day. For the Frensshmen
ne none other might not break that ordinance. And those the^ers of the Empire
by the pope and Otto were not made for any blame of the Saxons / but to eschew
the euylles to come. And their names ben written for learned men in latin in
these verses. (Maguntinensis Treuerensis Coloniensis Quilibe^ imperu fit
cancellarius horum. Et Palatinus da^ifer Dux Portitorensis. Marchio prepositus
camere. Pincerna Bohemus Hustatuunt dominum cuntis persecula summum. Palatinus
est comes ren^. Marcio est Brandebur gensis Dux saxorum et rex Bohemorum. veru^
vt quidam dicunt. Through this occasyon the Egle has lost many a feder. And
in the end he shall be made naked. Otto the third was Emperor.xviii. year.
This man was a worthy man all the days of his Empire. And after the wisdom
of his fader / he was a very holy faithful man to the church. And in many
bataylles he prosperyd by cause he was devout unto almighty god and his
saints. And yaue mighty worshyppynge to ye relykes of saints. And oftentimes
he vysyted holy places. This man was crowned by Gregorius his cosyn. And at
the last he decessyd at Rome.

Anno dm^.M.iiii.
SIluester the Second was pope after Gregorius four yere^ And he was made
pope by the help o^ the devil / to whom he did homage / for he should give
him all thing that he desired. And he was called Hylbecte^ And his enmye gate
him the grace of the king of France / and he made him the bishop of Remensis
/ but anon he was deposyd And after he gate the grace of the Emperor / and
was made the bishop of Rauennie / and after the pope / But he had an end
anon and so have all that put their hope in falls deuylles. yet men trust in
his salvation / for certain demonstracyon of his sepulcre / and for the great
penance that he did in his last end. For he made his hand and in his legs
to be curte of / and dysmembred in all his body and to be cast out at the
door to fowls / and then his body to be drawn with wild beestes and there
to be buried where someuer they rested as an hand. And they stood still at
saint Johan lateranensis / and there he was buried And that was sign of his
saluacon. Johannes the.xviii. was pope five months. Johannes the.xix. was
pope after him five year. And these two did little things. Henricus the
first was Emperor in Almayne.xx. year / This henricus was duke of Barry / and
all according he was chosen for his blessed fame and good name the which he
had. And it is read / that many of these dukes of Barry werre holy men / not
all only in absteydynge of flesshely dysyres / but also in virtuous living.
And this man had a sister that was as holy as he / the whom he yaue to wife
unto the king of Hu^gry And she brought all Hungry unto the right believe and
the christian faith. And his wives name was (sancta Konnogundis) with whom he
lived a vyrgyne all his lives days. And also he did many a battle / as well
in ytaly / as in Almayne against the rebellyous / and prosperyd right wysly.
At the last with a blessed end he decessyd. And in the life of saytn
Laure^ce he and his wife be put for ensamples. Benedictus was pope after
Ioha^nes.xi year. This man had great strife in his days / for he was put out
\ and a another put in. And this Benedictus after that he was deed was seen of
an holy man bishop in a wretchyd figure / and he had great pain. And this
figure said. He trusted no thing in the mercy of god. And no thing profyted
him yt was done for him / for it was gotten with extorcyon and unjustly. Then
this bishop left his bysshopryche for dred of this sight and went in to a
monastery and lived virtuously all his days. Ioha^nes the.x. was pope after
him ^xi. year / and little profyted.

Of king Knoght that was a Dane.
ANd after the death of Eldred Knoght that was a Dane began to regne. but
Edmonde Irensyde that was king Eldredes sone by his first wife / ordained a
great power of men / and began for to war on king Knoghte / And so he did
many times and often / And the war was so strong and hard / ye wonder it
was to wyte^ And the queen Emme that dwelled tho in westmestre / had great
dread of her two sons of the war Alured and Edward / lest they should be
defoyled and mysdone thorugh this war. wherefore she sent them over ye see
in to Normandy to ye duke Richard their uncle. And there they dwelled in
saufte and peace long time. This Edmonde Irensyde and Knoght the Dane warred
strongely to gyder. But at the last they were accorded in this manner / yt they
should depart ye reame betwixt them both / and so they did / and after they
became good friends. And so well loved to gyder as they had been brethern gotten
of one fader and of one mother borne.

How king Edmonde Irensyde traytoursly was slain thorugh a traitor / that
was ralled Eldred of Strotton.
ANd after tho reigned king Irensyde and Knoght the Dane. But thus it befell
afterward / that in the same year that they were accorded / and so much loved
to gyder. wherefore a falls traitor had enuytee to the love that was betwixt
them and frendshyp / whoos name was Edrith of Stratton / yt was a great lord /
that was Edmonde Irensydes man / and of him held all the land that he had.
And nevertheless he thought his lord to betray and make Knoght king of the
land / to the entente rychely to be auau^ced / and with him be well beloved /
wherefore he prayed his lord Edmonde Irensyde upon a day with him for to ete.
And the king him curteysly granted and to him came at his prayer And at the
mete ye king ryally was served with diverse meetees and drynkes. And when the
night came yt he should go unto bed. The king took his own meyne and went
unto the chamber there yt he should take his nyghtes rest. And as he looked him
about / he saw a fair ymyge and well made / and in semblau^t as it were an
Archer with a boowe / and in the boowe a fine arowe. King Edmonde went tho
nere for to behold it better what it might be. And anon the arowe smote him
thrughe the body and there slew the kynge^ For that engyne was made for to
slay his own lord traytoursly. And so when king Edmo^de was thus deed and
slain he had reigned but.x. year. And his people for him made much sorrow. And
his body they ba^e unto Glastenbury and there them him en^yred And this false
traitor Edrith anon went unto the queen / that was king Edmondes wife / that
wist not of her lords death. Anon he took from her tow sons that were fair
and young / that her lord had upon her gotten that one was called Edward / and
that other Edwyn And law them with him to Londen and took them unto king
Knoght / yt he should do with them what his will were. And told him how
subtylly he had slain king Edmonde / for by cause and love of him / so that
king Knoght all England in his power holy might have. O thou falls traytoure
/ haste thou my true brother that was so true thus slain for me / man I most
loved in ye world. Now by my heed I shall for thy traueyll well reward as thou
have deserved / and anon let him be take and bound hand and foot in manner
of a traitor / and let cast him there in to Tamyse / and in this manner the false traitor ended his life. The king took the two childern and put them unto
the abbot of westmestre to ward and to keep till that he wist was best with
them to do.

How king Knoght sent king Edmondes sons both in to De^marke to be slain /
and how they were saved.
SO it befell soon after that king Knoghte had all the land in his hand /
and spowsed the queen Emme thorughe consent of his baronage. For she was a
fair woman the which was Eldredes wife and the dukes sister of Normandye / and
they lived together with much love as reason would. The king axed upon a day
counseyll of the queen what was best to do with the sons that were Edmonde
Irensydes. Sire said she. they ben the right heirs of ye land / and if they
live they will do much sorrow with war / and therefore let send them in to
a strange land a far to some man that may them defoyle and destroy. The
king anon let call a dane that was called walgar / and commanded him that
he should led tho two childern / in Denmark / and so to do and ordeyne for
them / that he should never here more of them. Sir said this walgar / gladly
your commandment shall be done and anon tho two chyldern he took and ladde
them in to Denmark. And for as much as he saw that the chyldern were wonder
fair and also meke / he had of them great pity and ruthe / and would them slay
/ but ladde them to the king of Hungry for to noursshe / for this walgar was
well be known with the king and well beloved. Anon the king axed whens the
childern were / and walgar told him and said / that they were the right
heirs of England and therefore men would destroy them / And therefore sir unto
you they be come mercy and help for to seek. And for sothe if they may live /
your men they shall become / and of you they shall hold all their land. The
king of Hungry received them with much honor / and let them worthily be
kept. And thus it befell after ward that Edwyne ye younger brother deyed / and
Edward ye elder brother lived / a fair man and a strong / and a large of
body and gentle / and curteys of condycyons / so yt all men him loved / And
this Edward in the Chronicles is called among the Englysshmen Edward ye
outlawe. And when as he was made knight / the kings daughter of Hu^gry him
much loved for his goodness and his fayrnes / that she him called her derlyng.
The king that was her fader perceived well the love that was betwixt them two
/ and had no heir but only that daughter / and the king vowche sauf his
daughter to no man so well / as he did to him that she loved so well and he
her / and yaue her unto him with a good will / and Edward her spowsed with
much honor. The king of hungry sent after all his baronage and made a
solemn feast and a rich wedding. And made all me^ to understand / that
this Edward should be king of that land after the decesse of him. And of
that tidings they were all full glad. This Edward begat upon his lady a
sone / that was called Edgar Helynge / and afterward a daughter that was
called Margarete that afterward was queen of Scotlonde. And by the king of
Scotlonde yt was called Mancolin she had a daughter that was called Maude yt
was queen afterward of England / through king Henry that was the first sone
of the conqueror that her wedded And he begat on her a daughter that was
called Maude that afterward was Empress of Almayn. And of this Maude came ye
king of England that unto this day is called Henry the Empress sone. And
yet had this Edward an other daughter by his wife that was called Christian
and she was a Nonne.

How king Knoght that was proud man conquered Normandy / and how he became
afterward meke and mylde.
NOw have we herd of Edmonde Irensydes sons that king Knoght wend they had been slain as he had commanded walgar before^ And this king Knoght had in
his hand all the reame of England and denmark. And after that they went
unto Norwaye that land for to conquer. But the king of the land that was
called Elat came with his people / and wend his land to have well kept and
defended / and so there he faught with him till at the last he was slain in
that battle. And tho this Knoght took all the land in his hand. And when he
had conquered Norway and taken feaute and homages there / he came again into
England / and held him self so great a lord / that him thought in all the
world his pere no man was. And he came so proud and hauteyne that it was
great wonder. And so it befell upon a day as he had herd mass at westmestre
/ and would have gone in to his palace / the ways of the Tamyse so swyftely
against him came that almoost they touched his feet. Tho said the king with a
proud heart I command the water to torn again / or else I shall make the \
The wawes for his commandment would not spare / but flowed ever in heyght
more and more. The king was so proud of heart that he would not flee the
water and beat it with a rod that he had in his hand / and commanded the
water that it should go no ferder. But for all his commandment the water
would not cesse / but ever wexed more and more on high / so that the king was
all wete and stood deep in the water. And when he saw that he had abyden there
to long / and the water would no thing do his commandment tho soon he with
drew him / and tho stood he upon a stone and held his hondes on high and
said these words herynge all the people. This god that makes the sea thus
arise / is king of all kings / and of all myghtes most. And I am a catyf and
a man deedly / and he may never deye / and all thing does his commandment
/ and to him obedyent. To that god I pray / that he be my warraunt. For I
knowledge me a caytyf feeble / and of no power And therefore I will goo unto Rome
without any long lettynge / and my wickedness for to punysshe and me to
amend. For of god I claim my land for to hold / and of none other. And anon
made ready his heir and him self went to Rome without any lettynge. And by
the way did many alms deeds / and when he came to Rome also. And when he
had be there / for his sins do penance / he came again in to England /
and became a good man and a holy. And lived and left all manner pride and
stoutenes / lived an holy life after / and made two abbayes af saint Benet /
one in England and an other in Normandye / for as much as he loved saint
Benet more specially thanne other saints. And much he loved saint Edmonde the
king. And often he yaue great yeftes to the how se / wherefore it was made
rich. And when he had reigned.xx. year he deyed / and lies at wynchestre.

Anno dm^.M.xviii.
BEnedictus the.ix. was pope after Johannes / and he was a great lechour / and
therefore he was dampened / and he apperyd to a certain man under a meruaylous
figure and an horrible. His heed and his tail was like an ass / that other
part of his body like a bear. And he said to this man to whom he apperyd. Be
not aferde / for I was a man as ye now be but I apeyre now / for I lived
unhappily in old time like a be when I was pope. In this man's time there
was great dyuysyon and sclau^der to ye church for he was put out and in two
times. And here Tholomeus notes / that the pride of bishops had ever an
evil end. And it was ever the occasyon of much unrest and battle. Conradu^
ye first was Emperor after Henricus.xx. year. This man made many laws / and
commanded peace to be kept most straytly of any man. But the earl of Ludolf
was accused / and he fled from his land / and desired more to live like a
churl than like a gentle man / and yet meruayllously his sone was made
Emperor by the commandment of god against the will of Conradus. And at the
last they were accorded. And he took Corodis daughter to his wife.

Of king Harold that lever had goo on foot than ride on horse.
THis Knoght of whom we have spoken of before / had two sons by his wife Emme
/ and that one was called Hardyknoght / and that other Harold. And he was so
light of foot that men called him most comynly Harolde Hare foot. And this
Harold had no thing the condycyons and the manners of king ^noghte that was his
fader. For he set but little price of chyualrye / ne no curteyse another
worship / but only by his own will And he became so wicked that he exyled his
mother Emme. And she went out of ye lord in to Flau^dres / and there dwelled
with the earl / wherefore after there was never good love betwixt him and his
brother For his brother hated him deedly ^ and when he had reigned two year and
little more / he deyed and lies at westmestre.

Of king Kariknoght that was Haroldes brother.
AFter this Harold Hare foot / Reigned his brother Hardiknoght a noble knight
and a worthy man / and much loved chyualry / and all manner of goodness / And
when this Hardiknoght had reigned a little while / he let vncouere his brother
Harold and smote of his heed / that was his brother at westmestre / and let
cast the heed in to a gonge / and the body in to Tamyse. And after came
fysshers and took the body with their nets by night / and bare him to saint
Clementes church and there him carried. And in this manner avenged him
Hardiknoght of his brother for in none other manner he might be auengeb^ This
king Hardiknoght was so large a yeuer of meet and drink / that his tables
were sete every day three times full ryall meets and drynkes for his own
meyne / and for all that came unto / his court to be rychely served of ryall
meets. And this king Hardiknoght sent after Emme his mother / and made her
come again i^ to England / for she was driven out of England while that Harold
Hare f^ot reigned / through counseyll of the earl Godewin / yt tho was the
grettest lord of England next the king / and most might do through out all
England what he would his commandment / for as much as he had his spoused
daughter of ye good king Knoght / that was a Dane / which daughter he had by
his first wife. And when this queen was driven out of England / and come to
the Earl of Flaundres / that was called Balde wine her cosyn / he found her
there all thing that her neded / unto the time that she went again in to
England / that the king Hardiknoght had sent for her that was her sone and
made her come again with much honor. This king Hardyknoght when he had reigned
five year he deyed and lies at westmestre.

Of the vylany that the Dany^ did to ye Englysshmen. wherefore fro ye time
after was no Dane made king of this land.
ANd after the death of this king Hardyknoght / for as much as he had no
thing of his body begoten / The earls and barons assembled / and made a
counsel / that never more after no man ye was a Dane / though he were never
so great a man among them / he should never be king of England for the
despyte that the Danes had done to Englysshmen. For euermoore before and if
it were so that the Englysshmen and the Danys hapened for to mete upon a bridge
/ the Englysshmen should not be so hardy to meue ne styre a foot / but stand
still till the Dane were passed for the. And more over if ye Englysshmen had
not bowed down their heedes to do reverence unto the Danys / they should have been beten and defoylled. And such manner despytes and vylany did the Danys to
our Englysshmen. wherefore they were driven out of ye land after time that
king Hardyknoght was deed / for they had no lord ye them might mayntene. And
in this manner avoided the Danys England that never they came again. The earls
and barons by their common assent and by their counselles sent unto Normandy for
to seek those two brethern Alured and Edward yt were dwelling with the duke
Richharde that was their came in entente for to crown Alured the elder brother
/ and him make king of England. And of this king to make an end / the earls
and barons made their oath. But the Earl Godewin of westsex falsely and
traytoursly thought to slay the se two brethern anon as they should come in to
England / in intent / to make his sone Harolde king the which sone he had
begote up on his wife / the which was king Knoghtes daughter that was a Dane.
And so this Godewin pryuely him went to South hampton for to mete there the
two brethern when that they should come unto london. And thus it befell the
messengers that went in to Normandy / found but oonly Alured that was the
elder brother For Edward his brother was gone in to hu^gry for to speak with
his cosyn Edward the outlawe / yt was Edmonde sone with the Irensyde. The
messengers told and said Alured / how that earls and barons of England sent
after him / and that he boldly should come in to England and receive the
reame. For king Hardiknoght was deed and all the Danes driven out of the land.

How Godewin the false traitor took Alured upon Gyldesdowne when that he came
from Normandy to be king of England and how he caused him to be martyred in
the isle of Ely.
AS Alured herd these tidings he thanked god. And in ship went with all the
have yt he might and passed the sea / and arrived at Southhampton there Godewin
the false traitor was. And when this traitor saw that he was come / he
welcomed him and received him with much Joy and said / that he would led him
to London there ye all the barons of England him abode to make him king. And
so they went on their way to ward London / And when they came on Gyldesdowne
tho said the traitor Godewin unto Alured Take keep about you both on the left
side and right side / and of all ye shall be king / and of such and hundred
more Now forsothe said Alured. I behyght you and if I be king. I shall ordeyne
and make such laws / wherefore god and man shall (...) ^ell pleased. Now had
the traitor co^m^ (...) al his men yt were with him That wh(...)re come upon
Gyldesdowne that the(...)lee all that were Aluredes company / that ^^re with
him fro Normandy / and after that take Alured and led him in to the isle of ely
and after put out his eyes of his heed and afterward bring him to ye death /
and so they did. For they slew al ye company that there were / ye no^bre of
xii. gentylmen that were come with him fro Normandy / and after took they
Alured and in ye isle of Ely they put out his eyes and rent his womb and took
the chyef of his bowels / and put a steke in the ground / and an end of ye
bowels there to fastened / and with nedles eylesse of yren they prycked the good
child / and so made him to go about ye stake till yt al his bowels were drawn
out of his body / and so dyed Alured there through treason of the earl Godewin.
When the lords of England had herd and wist how Alured that should have be
their king was put to death through the false traitor Godewin they were wonder
wroth. And swore between god and the^ that he should deye a more wors death /
than did Edrith of Stratto^ / yt had betrayed his lord Edmonde Irensyde / and
they would have pute him to death / but ye theyf traitor fled thens in to
Denmark / and there held him four year and more / and lost all his land in
England.

SIluester the third was pope after Benedictus. This Siluester was chose / and
Benedictus was expulsyd. And after ward was he expulsyd / and Benedictus was
put up again. And after he was put out / and Gregorius was made pope. And he was
but a simple lettred man / and therefore he chose an other man for to be
consecrate with him And when many men were dyspleased with this godynge of two
popes / the third was brought in the which should occupye the place of both
the tow. And so they strove among themself. But Henry the Emperor came then
to Rome and deposyd them all and made Clement the second pope / whom he made
anon to crown him. And he said to the Romans / they should never chese pope
without his assente. And so five being popes / sixte was put in. And many men
say / this Gregorius was an holy man. Damasius the second was after
Clemente.xx. days. This man was an usurper of the popeheed / and so he deyed
suddenly. And anon the Romans asked to have a pope / and that the Almayns
should have none. For they were so hard herted / that they myhht not enclyne
to the entence of the Emperor / the which said. There should be no pope
chosen but if he would be of counseyl of the eleccyon. But for all that the put
in this holy man Leo / and after he had of that conscience and refused. And
anon he was chosyn by the common assent / this Leo put Christ in the form of
a Laser in his own bed / and in ye morrow he found no thing there.

Of saint Edward the confessor / that was Aluredes brother / and how he was
king of England.
ANd when this was done / all the barons of England sent an other time in to
Normandy / for that Edw^rde should come in to England with much honor. And
this Edward in his chyldehode loved almighty god and him dradde. And in
honest and clennesse had his life and hated sin as death. And when he was
crowned and anointed with a ryall power forgate not his good manners and
condycyons that he first used. And forgate not all good customs for no manner
of honor / ne for riches / ne no manner hyghnes. But evermore and more yaue
him to goodness and loved god and holy church passing all other manner
thing. And poor men also be loved / and them held as they had been his
own brethern. And to them often he yaue great alms with full good will.

Of the first special love that god she(...) to saint Edward living.
IT befell on a day / as he went from the church of westmestre. And had
herd mass of saint Johan the Euangelyst / for as much as he loved saint
John^ euangelyst more specially after god and hour lady than he did any other
saint. And so there came to him a pelgryme / and prayed him for the love of god
and our lady and saint Johan the euangelyst some good him for to give. And the
king pryuely took his ring of his fynder / that no man perceived it and yaue
it to the pelgryme / and he it received and went thens. This king Edward
made all the good lawas of England / that yet ben most used and holden. And
was so mercyable and so full of pity / that no man might be more.

How the earl Godewyn came again in to England and had again all his land / and
afterward saint Edward weded his daughter.
AS the Earl Godewin that was dwelling in Denmark had much herd of the
godnesse of king Edward / and yt he was so full of mercy and of pity. He
thought yt he would go again in to England / for to seek and to have grace of
the good king Edward that so mercy full was / that he might have again his
land in peace. And arrayed him as much as he might and put him to ward the sea
and came in to England to London there the king was that time and all the
lords of England / and held a parlyament. Godewin sent to him yt were his
friends / and were the most grettest lords of the land / and prayed them to
beseech the kings graet for him / and that he would his peace and his land
grant him. The lords led him before the king to seek his grade. And anon
as the king him saw / he apeled him of treason and of the death of Alured his
brother and these words unto him said. Traitor Godewin said the king I the
appele / yt thou have betrayed and slain my brother Alured. Certes sir said
Godewin. saving your grace and your peace and your lordshyp. I him never
betrayed / ne yet him slewe^ and therefore I put me in reward of ye court. Now
fair lords said the king. ye yt ben my lyeges / earls and barons of the land
that here be assembled / fulle well ye herd my appele / And the answer also
of Godewin / and therefore I woll that ye a ward and does right. The earls and
Barons tho gadred them all together for to do this a ward by themself / and so
they spoke dyuersely amu^ge them. For some said / there was never alyaunce by
homage seriment service ne by lordshyp between Godewin and Alured / for which
thing they might him draw. And at the last they deuysyd and demed / That he
should put him in ye kings mercy all together. Tho spoke ye earl Leuerik of
Couentree a good man to god and to all the world / and told his reason in
this manner and said. The earl Godewin is the best fended man of England after
the King / and well it might not be again said / ye without counsel of
Godwin Alured was never put to death / wherefore I a ward as towchynge my part
/ that himself and his sone and every of us.xii. earls that been his friends goo
before the king / charged with as much gold and silver as we may bear
betwyxt our hondes / praynge ye king to forgive his evil will to the earl
Godewin / and receive his homage / and his land yield again. And they accorded
unto that a ward / and came in this manner as is abouesayd every of them with
hold and silver as much as they might bear between her hondes before the
king / and there said the form and the manner of they accord and of their a
ward The king would not them again say / But as much as they ordained / he
granted and confermed And so was ye earl Godewin accorded with the king / and
so he had again all his land. And afterward he bare him so well and so wisely
/ that the king loved him wonder much / and with him he was fulle preuy. And
within a little time they loved so much / that there the king spowsed
Godewyns daughter / and made her queen. And nevertheless though the kyngge had
a wife / yet he lived ever in chastyce and cle^nesse of body without any
flesshely deed doing with his wife. And the queen also in her half ladde an
holy life two year / and deyed. And afterward the king lived all his life
without any wife. The king yaue the erledome of Oxenforde to Harolde that was
Godewyns sone / and made him earl. And so well they were beloved / both the
fader and he / and so pryue with the king / both the fader and the sone that
they might do by right what thing that they would For against right would he
nothing do for no manner man / so good and true he was of conscience. And
therefore our lord Ihesu Christ great special love unto him showed.

How king Edward saw Swyne king of Denmark drowned in the sea in the time of
the Sacrament as he stood and herd mass.
IT befelle upon wytsondaye as king Edward herd his mass in the great
church of westmestre nyghe at the leuacyon of Ihesu Crystis body / and as
all men were gadred in to the church. and came night the awter for to see the

Wherefore all that about him stood gretely ganne wonder. And after mass / they
axed why the kings laughter was fair lord said king Edward. I saw Swyne
the younger that was king of Denmark come in to the sea with his power for to
have come in to England upon us for to war. And I saw him and his folk
drowned in the sea / and all this I saw in the leuacyon of Crystis body
between ye priests hondes and I had therefore so great Joy that I might not my
laughter withholde. And the earl Leueryk beside him stood at the leuacyon / and
openly saw ye form of bread torn in the likeness of a young child / and
took up his right hand and blessed the king and after the earl and the earl
anon turned him to ward ye king for to make him see ye holy sight. And to
said ye king Sire Earl said he I see well yt ye see / thanked be god that I
have honored my god my sauoyour vysybly Ihesu Christ in form of man. whoos
name he blessed in all worlds.

How the ring that saint Edward had given to a poor pelgryme / for the love
of god and saint Johan Euangelyst came again to king Edward.
This noble man Saint Edward reigned.xiii. year. And thus it befelle upon a
time are he deyed / that two men of England were gone in to holy land / and
had done their pelgrymage / and were going again in to their own country
where they came fro And as they went in ye way / they met a pilgrim that
curtely them saluwed / and axed of them in what land and in what country
they were borne. And they said in England. Tho axed he who was king of
England. And they answered and said. the good king Edward. Fair friends said
tho the pelgryme / when yt ye come in to your countres again. I pray you yt ye
will go unto king Edward / and oftentimes great him in mine name and
oftentimes him thank of his great curteysy that he to me has done and namely
for the ring that ye have me when he had herd mass at westmestre for saint
Iohans love Euangelyst. And took it to ye pelgremes and said. I pray you go and
bear this ring and take it unto king Edward / and tell him that I send it him
and a full rich yefte I will him give. For upon the.x. day he shall come unto
me / and evermore dwell in bless without any end. Sir said ye pelgremes /
what me^ be ye / and in what country is your dwelling. Fair friends said he I
am John^ the Eua^gelyste / and I am dwelling with almighty god / and your
king Edward is my friend / and I love him i^ specyal for by chause that he
has evermore lived in clennesse and is a clean maid and I pray you my
message fulfill as I have you said. when ye saint Johan the euangelyst had them
thus charged suddenly he voyded out of their syghtes both / The pelgrymes tho
thanked almighty god and wene forth their way. And when they had gone two or
three mile. they began to wax weary and set them a down for to rest them /
and so they fell one sleep / And when they had slepte well one of them a woke
and life up his heed and looked about / and said to his fellow. Arise up and
walk we in our way. what said that one fellow unto that other / where be we
now. Certes said that other / it seems me yt this is not the same country
there we laid us down in for to rest and sleep. For we were from Jerusalem
but three mile. They took up their hondes and blessed them / and went forth in
their way And as they went in their way / they saw shep^ going with their
sheep ye spoke none other langage but english. Good friends said one of the
pelgrymes / what country is this and who is lord thereof. And one of the
sheperdes answered and said. this is ye country of kent in England / of the
which the good king Edward is lord of. The pelgrymes ^anked tho almighty god
and saint John^ Euangelyst and went forth in their way and came to
Caunterbury / and fro thens unto London / and there they found the king And
told him all from the beginning unto ye ending asmoche as saint John^ had
them charged and of al things how they hadsped by the way. And took the
ring to the king Edward / and he took it ^ and thanked almighty god and
saint John^ Euangelyst. And tho made him ready every day fro day to day to
depart out of this life / when god would for him send.

How saint Edward dyed ye Twelfth day.
ANd after it befell thus on Crystmasse even / as the holy man Edward was at
goods service Matyns for to hereof that high solemn feast. He became full
like and in the morrow endured with much pain the mass for to here. And
after mass he let him be ladde in to his chamber / There for to rest him.
But in his halle among his barons and his knights might he not come them for
to comfort and solace / as he was wont for to do at ye worthy feast. wherefore
all their mirth and comfort among all that were in the halle was turned in to
care and sorrow / by cause they dradde for to lose the good lord ye king. And
upon Saint John^ day Euangelyste that came next / the king received his
ryghtes of holy church / as yt befaylleth to every christian man and abode the
mercy and the will of god. And ye two pilgrims he let before him come and
yaue them rich yeftes and betoke them to god. Also the abbot of westemestre
he let before him come and took him that ring in the honor of god and
saint Mary / and of Saint Johan the euangelyst. And the abbot took it and put
it among other rekyles / so that it is at westmestre / and ever shall be so
lay the king syke till the twelfth eve. And tho deyed the good king Edward
at wehmestre / and there he lies. For whoos love god has showed many a
fair miracle. And this was in the year of the. Incarnacyon of our lord Ihesu

Conradus / and he was borne in wood / and twyes taken for to be slain when he
was a child / but god defended him evermore. when he was made Emperor / many

against him / and said he was an heretyke. And Gregorius cursyd him. And the
chesers of the Emperor they those the duke of Baxon for to be Emperor / whom

king of Naples drove him the^s and delivered the pope and his Cardynalles.
Nevertheless yet he was a man of great alms. and.iii. times he faught in

AS saint Edward was gone out of this world / and was passed to god and
worthily enteryd as to such a great lord ought / the barons of the land
would have had Edward Elygus. sone to Edward the outlawe that was Edmonde
Irensydes sone to be king / For as much as he was most kyndest kings blood
of the reame. But Harolde sone through the earl Godewyn / and ye strength of
his fader Godewyn / and through other great lords of the reame / yt were of his
kynne and unto him sybbe seized all England in to his hand / and anon let
crown him king after the enterement of Saint Edware. This Harolde that was
Godewynes sone the second year before that saint Edward was deed / would have
gone in to Flaundres / but he was driven through tempest in to the country of
Pountyse / and there he was taken brought to duke wyllyam And this Harolde
wend yt tho this duke wyllyam would have be avenged upon him for by cause yt
the Earl Godewyn yt was roldes fader / had let slay Alured that was saint
Edwardes brother / and pryncipally for by cause that Alured was queen Emmes
sone / ye was Rychardes mother duke of Normandy / that was ai^enll to the duke
wyllyam And nevertheless when the duke wyllyam had Harolde in prison and under
his power / for asmoche as this Harolde was a noble wise knight and a worthy of
body / and that his fader and he was accorded with good king Edward / and
therefore would not mysdo him. But all manner things that betwext them was
spoken and ordained. Harolde by his good will swore upon a book / and upon ^oly
saints that he should spouse and wedde duke wyllyams daughter after the death
of saint Edward / and that he should besely do his devour for to keep and
save the reame of England unto the profit and auantage of duke wyllyam. And
when Harolde had thus made his oath unto the duke wyllyam he let him goo /
and yaue him many a rich yeftes. And he tho went thens / and came in to
England / and anon did in this manner when Saint Edward was deed / and as
a man falsely for sworn / He let crown him king of England / and falsely
brake the coue name yt he had made before with duke wyllyam / wherefore he was
wonder wroth with him and swore / that he would upon him be avenged what some
ever him befell. And anon duke wyllyam let assemble a great host and came
in to England to aueng^ him upon Harolde / and to conquer the land if that
he might. And in the same year that Harolde was crowned. Haralde Herestynge
king of Denmark arrived in Scotlo^de and thought to have be king of England
and he came in England and robbed / and destroyed all that he might / till
that he came to york / and there he slew many men of arms a thousand and a
hundred priests. wha^ this tidings came to the king / He assembled a great
power / and went for to fight with Haralde of Denmark / and with his own
hondes de him slew / and the Danes were dyscomfyted / and tho that were left

departed / so that oonly with him abode no moo but his soldyurs. And upon a
day as he sat at meet / a messager came to him and said / that wyllyam
bastard the duke of Normandy was arrived in England with a great host / and

him of these three things / if that he would have his daughter to wife as he
made and swore his oath and behyght / or that he would hold the land of him
in truage / or he would determyne this thing in battle. This Harolde was a
proud man and a strong and trusted wonder much upon his strength and faught
with duke wyllyam and with his people. But Harolde and his men in this battle
were dysco^fyted / and himself there was slain / and this battle was ended

GRegorius the.vii. was pope after Alexander.xii. year / this man ordained in a
general Synodus / that no priest should have a wife ne should dwell with
wymmen / but tho that the holy Synodus of Micena and other decrees had suffered.
And then^e the priests set naught or little pondred his ordinance. This
pope commanded that no man should here mass of a priest that had a concubyne
And he on acertayne time when he was Cardynall and Legate in to France /
proceeded sharply against prelates and / that were symomers. And among other
was one bishop there that was gretely famed with symonye. And those that
accused him / pryuely hyered them to say the countraye. The which the Legate
conceived / and afor^ all the people he said. Let the Judgment of this men
cesse at this time / for it is dysceyuable / and let god dyspose for it. And
said / thus it is certain. That the dygnyte of a bishop is the yeuer of the
holy ghost. And whosomeuer byeth a bysshopryche / does against the holy ghost.
Then^e if thou bishop did not against the holy ghost say openly before all the
people (Glori^ petri et filio et speritui sancto) And many times he began to
say it / but he could never speak (spiritui sancto) Then he was deposyd of
his bysshopryche / and after he could speak it will enough. Victor the third
was pope after him oo year / and this man was poisoned with venym in the
chaly^. Vrbanus was pope after him two year. This man cursyd ye king of
France for his adu^^^erys. And he called a counseyll at Claurum in the which
he ordained / that matyns of our lady should be said every day / and on
Saturday her solemn mass. And it is said / that this was showed unto ye
freres of Cartusis. Also he called an other counseyll at Turan for the holy
land to be won aye^ / and pryuoked the people to that matere / and within a
little time after that matere / the holy land was recovered and the sepulcre
of our lord / and Anthioche with many other cytees taken fro the Sarrasyns.
And it is said and byleued that.CC.M. christian men went to that Iourny For
there went of states old men and young / and also rich and poor / and no
man compelled them. And this passage was made by the vysyon of our lady. And
the princes of this peaple were diverse One was Godfroy de Boloynt a full noble
man of all the world / and a virtuous man / and an other was Beemonde the Duke
of Neaples. And ye third was Hughe the kings brother of France / and many
other / the which / did full nobly for the faith of god. And it were to long
in this book to reherce the glorious acts that they did. Of king wyllyam
Rous that was king williams bastardes sone ye destroyed towns / and houses of
Relygyon for to make ye new forest.

ANd after this wyllyam bastard reigned his son wyllyam the Rous.
And this wyllyam was a wonder contraryous man to god and holy church / and
let amend and make the town of Cardies / that the Paynems had destroyed.
This king wyllyam destroyed holy church and their possessions in what part
he might them find. And their fore there was so much debate between him and
the Archebyssop of Caunterbury Ancelmus. For by cause that he repreuyd him of
his wickedness / that he destroyed holy church. And for that cause the king
bare to him great wrath. And so he exyled him out of this land / and the
Archebysshop went to the court of Rome / and there dwelled with the pope / And
this king made the new forest / and cast down and destroyed.xxvi. towns.
and.lxxx. houses of Relygyon / all for to make his forest longer and broder^
And became wonder glad and proud of his wood and of his forest. And
nourysshed ye wild beestes yt were within / that it was marvel for to wit /
so that men called him keeper of wodes and of pastures. And the more longer that
he lived / the more wicked he became both to god and to all holy church and to
all his me^ And this king let make the great halle of westmestre. So upon a
day in the wytsontyde he held therein his first feast / and he looked him
about and said / that the halle was to little by the half deal. And at the
last he became so contraryous / that al thing yt pleased god dyspleased him /
and all thing that god loved / he hated deedly. And so it befell that he
dremyd upon a night a little or that he deyed / that he was let blood / and
bledde a great quantyte of blood / and a streme of blood lepte on high to ward
heaven more than a hundred fadom and the clerenesse of the day was turned unto
night and derkenesse of the fyrmamente also And when that he a woke he had
great dread so that he not wist what for to do. And told his dreme to men of
his counseyll and said that he had great dread / and supposyd that to him was
some myscaunce to come. And the second night before a monk dremyd of ye
household / that the king went in to a church with much people / and he was
so proud that he despised all the people that were with him and that he took
ye image of the Crucefire and shamefully bote it with his teeth. And the
Crucefixe mekely suffered all that he did. But yer y^ king and as a wood man
rent of the arms of the Crucefixe / and cast it under his feet / and
defoylled it / and threw it all a broad / And ^ great fire came out of the
Crucefixe mouth. Of which dreme many a man had great meruaylle and wonder.
The good man that had dremyd this strange dreme / told it to a knight that
was most pryue with the king of all men / and the knight was called Hamondes
Soon the monk and he told the dremes to the king and said. That it should
betoken other thing than good / And nevertheless the king laughed there at twyes
or thryes / and little se^te thereby / and thought that he would go and hunte /
and play in the forest. And men counseylled him ye he should not go ye day for
no manner thing ne come in the wood / so that he abode at home before meet /
But oonly as he had eten no man him might let / but he would go unto the wood
for to have his dysporce. And so it befell that one of his knights that hight
walter Tyrell / would have shot to a harre / and his arowe glensyd upon a
branch / and thorughe mysauenture smote the king to the heart And so he
fell down deed to the ground with out any word speaking / and so ended his
life days. And it was no meruaylle / for the day yt he deyde he had let to
ferme the Archebisshop rich of Canterbury / and xabbayes also / and ever more
did great destruccyon to holy church / through wrongful taking and axenges /
for no man durst withstand that he would have done. And of his lewdenes he
would never withdraw / another to amend his life. And there fore god would
suffer him no longer to regne in his wyckednes. And he had be king.xiii. year
and.vi. wekes / and lies at westmestre.

Of king Henry Beauclerk that was william Rous brother / and of the debate
between him and Robert Curthos his brother.

Beauclerk was crowned king at London the fourth day after that his brother
was decessyd / that is to say / the fyfthe day of August. And anon as
ancelmus that was Archebysshop of Canterbury that was at the court of Rome
herd tell that wyllyam Rous was deed / he came again in to England and the
king Beauclerk welcomed him with much onour. And the first year that king
Henry reigned and was crowned. He spowsed maude ye was Margaretes daughter the
queen of Scotlonde. And the Archebysshop Ancelmus of Caunterbury wedded theme
And this king begat upon his wife two sons and a daughter / that is to say.
wyllyam and Richard and Maude. And this Maude was after ward the Empress of
Almayne. And in the second year of his regne / his brother Robert Curthos /
that was duke of Normandy came with an huge host in to England for to challenge
the land. But thrughe counseyle of wise men of the land / they were accorded
in this manner. That the king should give his brother the duke a thousand
pound every year. And which of them that lived lengest should be that others
heir and so between them should be no debate ne strife. And then when they
were thus accorded / ye duke went home again in to Normandye^ And when the
king had reigned four year. There a rose a great debate between him and the
Archebysshop of Caunterbury Ancelmus. For by cause that the Archebysshoh would
not grant to him for cale^ges of chyrches at his will. And the reforde
personse the Archebysshoppe Ancelmus went over the sea unto the court of Rome
and there he dwelled with the pope. And in the same year the duke of Normandy
came in to England to speak with his brether. And among all other things the
duke of Normandye. for yaue unto the king his brother the forsayde thousand
pound by year that should pay unto the duke. And with good love the king and
the duke departed / and there the duke went again in to Normundy. And when tho
two year were agone / Through the entycement of the devil and of simple me^ / a
great debate arose between the king and ye duke / so that through counseyll
the king went over the sea in to Normandy / and when the king of England
was come in to Normandy / all the great lords of Normandye turned unto the
king of England and held against the duke their own lord / and him forsook
/ and to the king them held / and all the good castelles and towns of
Normandy. And soon after was the duke taken and ladde with the king in to
England. And the king let put the duke in to prison / and this was the
vengeaun^e of god. For when the duke was in the holy land god yaue him such
might and grace that he was chosen for to have be king of Iherusalem / and he
forsook it and would not take it upon him / And therefore god sent him that
shame and dyspyte for to put in his brothers prison / Tho seized king Hery all
Normandye in to his hand / and held it all his life time. And in the same
year came the bishop Ancelmus for the court of Rome in to England again. And
the king and he were accorded. And in the next year coming after / there
began a great debare between the king Phylyppe of France and king Henry of
Englende / wherefore king Henry went in to Normandye / and there was strong
war between them two. And tho deye^ the king of France and lowys his sone
was mad king anon after his death. And tho went king Henry again into England /
and married Maude his daughter unto henry ye emperor of Almayne.

Of the debate that was betwixt king Lowys of France and king Hery of
Eenglonde / and how kynhe Henryes two snes were lost in the high se^.
AS king Henry had be king.xvii. year / a great debate arose betwixt king
Lowys of France and king Henry of England / for by cause that the king had
sent in to Normandy to his men / that they should be helping unto therle of
Bloys as much as they might in war against the king of France / And that
they should be as ready to hy^ as they were to their own lord / for by cause
that therle had spowsed his sister dame maude. And for this cause the king
of France did much sorrow to Normandy. wherefore ye king of England was
wonder wroth / and in have wen^e over the sea with a great power / and came in
to Norma^dye for to defend that land And the war between them lasted two
year / till at the last they two faught to geder. And the king of France was
dyscomfyted / and uneaths escaped away with much pain / and the most
party of his men were taken. And the king did with them what him best lyked
/ And some of them he let go freely / and some he let be put unto the death.
But afterward those two kings were accorded. And when king Henry had oonly
all the land of Normandy / and dysco^fyted his enmyes of France / he turned
again in to England with moche^ honor. And his two sons wyllyam and
Richard would have come after the fader and went to the sea with a great
company of people. But are that they might come to land / the ship came
against a roche and all were drowned that were there in / save oo man that was
in ye same ship that escaped. And this was upon saint Katheryns day / and
these were ye names of them that were drowned. Wyllyam and Richard the kings
sons / the Earl of Chestre Ottonell / his brotger Geffroy Rydell Walter
Emurci. Godefray Archedeken / the kings daughter / the countess of Perches
the kings nece the countess of Chestre / and many other. When king Henry and
other lords arrived in England / and herd these tidings / they made sorrow
enough / And all their myrthe and Joy was turned in to morning and sorrow.

How Maude the Empress came again in England / and how she afterward wedded
to Geffroy therle of Angoy.
ANd when that two year were agone yt the Earl had dwelled with the king / the
earl went from the king / and began to war upon him and did much harm in
the land of Normandy / and took there a strong castle and there he dwelled
all that year. And tho came to him tidings yt Henry the Emperor of Almayne yt
had spowsed Maude his daughter was deed / and that she dwelled no longer in
Almayne / and yt she would come again in to Normandy to her fader And wha^ that
she was come unto him / he took her tho to him and came again in to England /
and made the Englysshemen to do oath and feaute to the Empress And the first
man that made the oath was wyllyam ye Archebysshop of Canterbury And that
other David king of Scotlo^de / and after him all ye barons and earls of
England. Also after that ye noble man therle of Angoy yt was a worthy knight
/ sent unto ye king of England / yt he would grant him for to have his
daughter to spowse / that is to say Maude the Empress. And for by cause yt
her fader wist that he was a noble man / the king him granted and consented
there to. And tho took he his daughter and ladde her in to Normandy / and came
to the noble knight Geffroy / and there he spowsed the forsayde Maude with
much honor / and the Earl beg^te upon her a sone / yt was called Henry ye
Empress sone. And after when all this was done / king Henry dwelled all that
year in Normandy. and after ye long time a grievous sykenesse took him where
thorugh he deyed. And this king Henry reigned.xxxv. year and four months. And

in to England and enteryd at Redynge in the abboye / of ye which abbaye he
was begynner and founder.

This man put his own fader in prison / and there held him till he deyed. And
took pope Paschall with his Cardynalles / and present them as it is said
before. For the which cause as it is supposed he lacked issue. For he wedded
the kings daughter of England Maude. But after ward he came to grace / and
all the laws of ye church freely he resyned to Calixtus ye pope. And besought
him to give him in penance that he should never come again to his Empire / that
he might have remyssyon of his trespaas. And after ye oppynyon of many a man /
he was wylfully exyled and deyed and his wife both at Chestre in England.
Gelasius was pope after Paschall two year. And fled from Henry the Emperor
in to Bourgoyne and there decessyd. This Emperor those Benedyctus a Spanyarde
to be pope / the which strove with Calixtus. Calixtus was pope after him two
year and five months. This Calixtus was the sone of the duke of Bourgoyne and
was chosen in the place of Gelasius / And when he should come to Rome / he took
the for said Benedictus / and made him to ride before him shamefully. For he on
a mule turned his face to the tail of ye mule / and held the tail in his
hand as a brydell / till he came through the cite / and there he was put in
prison. And this pope made peace with the Emperor. Honorius was pope after him
two year / and little of him is written. Nota. Hary the fourth Emperor of
Almayne decessyd this time and was buried with his progenytours / after some
men with such an Epytaphe (Filius hic: pater hic Auus hic: proauus iacet
istis) But it is lykely to be truer that ye Geralde said (in Itinerario walk)
wherefore he says / that after he had prysoned his carnal fader / and his
sperytuell fader the pope with his Cardynalles / after he was reconsyled and
wylfully he was exyled. And he left Maude his wife the kings daughter of
England pryuely / and lived an heremytes life at Chestre.x. year where he might
live as no man knew him. And he called himself Godyscallus / the which
Godysson is called. So the Emperor secretly went away / and Maude his wife
the Empress there / she went unto her fader Henry in to Normandy. where anon
after she was wedded unto Geffroy Plantaginet the duke of Andegame upon whom he
begat Henry the second afterward king of England. Under whom saint Thomas
of Caunterbury reigned and deyed Lotharius was Emperor aftey Henry the
fourth.xii. year / And little of him is wrytem / but that he was manerely to
the church. And that he subdued Roger the usurper of the king of Cycyle. Hugo
de sancto Victory was a noble man this time at Paris / and a noble doctor /
of the nacyon of Saxons. The order of saint Johan Baptyst at Iherusalem began
this time / by the worshypfull man Reymonde myghtely dysposed unto the we^ke of
mercy. All this order make their way to serve poor men.

delivered for an Huge raunson / that is for to say / an hundred thousand
pound. And for the which raunson to be paid / each other chalyce of England
was molten and made in to money. And all the monks of the order of Cysteaux
yaue all their books through out all England / for to do them to selle /
and the raunson for to pay.

How king Richard came again from the holy land / and avenged him of his
enmyes.
SO as this king Richard was in prison / the king of France warred upon him
strongly in Norma^dye / and John^ his brother warred upon him in England. But
the bishops and the barons of England with stood him with all their power
that they might get / and took the castle of wyndesore and other castelles.
And the forsayde John^ saw yt he had no might ne power against the barons of
England for to fight But anon went him over the sea unto the king of
France. And when Richard came out of prison / and was delivered and came in
to England / anon after Candelmasse in great haste / he went unto Notyngham /
and the castle of Notyngham to him was yolden / and tho dyscomfyted he his
brother Johan and tho that with him held. And after he went unto the cite of
wynchestre / and there he let him crown king of England. And after he went
unto Normandy for to war upon the king of France And the king of France
came with.vi. hundred knyghtis to ward Gisors. And king Richard met him /
and tho would have yeuen him bataylle. But the king of France fled tho /
and hundred knights of his were taken and two hundred stedes that were trapped
with yren. And anon after went king Richard for to besyege the castle
Gaillarde ^ And as he rode upon a day by the castle for to take a uysemente
of the castle an arbarlaster somte him with a quarrel that was enuynymmed. And
the king drew out the shafte of the quarrel / but the quarrels heed abode still
in his heed. And it began for to rancle / that he ne might not help himself
/ ne meue his arms. And tho he wist that he had dethes wonde upon him / that
he might not be hoole for no manner of thing. He commanded ano^e sharply
all his men for to assoyle the castle. So that the castle was taken or he
deyed. And so manly his men did yt al ye people that were in the castle were
taken / and the king did with them what he would. And commanded his me^ that
they should bring before* him the man yt him so hurt and so wounded. And when
he came before ye king / the king axed him what was his name. And he said my
name is Bertham Gurdon wherefore said the king haste thou me slain / sith I
did the never none harm. Sir said he. Though ye did me never none harm / ye
your self with your own hand slew my fader and my brother. And therefore I have
quyte now your trauaylle. Tho said king Richard. He yt dyed upon ye cross /
to bring man's soul fro pain of hell / foryeue yt my death and I also
foryeue it the. Tho commanded he that no man should him mysdo. But for all ye
kings defending some of ye kings men him followed and pryuely him slew. And
the.vi. day after the king did shryue him / and sore repentance having of
his misdeeds / and was houseled and enoynted. Rud this king reigned but.ix. year
and.xxx. wekes / and deyed and lies beside his fader at Fontenerad.

HEnyicus ye fyfth was Emperor.viii. year This Henricus was sone to frederyk /
and he wedded Constaunce the kings daughter / of Cecyle / and though the
occasyon of her he subdued all the kingdom of Apulye / and he drove all the
people out ye enhabyte that land. Celestinus the third was pope after Clemens
almost three year. This man was crowned upon Eester day / and the day
following he crowned Henry the emperor. And he made a palace at saint Peter's /
and decessyd. Innocencius ye third was pope after him.viii. year and.v.
months. this man was well lettred and he made a book of the wretchydneste of
man's co^dico^n. and he made speculu^ miss and he mad many co^stytucyons.
This man dampened ye book of John^ Ioachim / yt which he made against master
Peyrs Lombarde / the maker of the Sentence. This time decessyd ye Emperor
Henry. And the princes of almayne discorded for some chose Otto / and some
chose Phylyppe brocher to Henry. Then Phylyppe was falsely slain / and Gtto
was crowned of Innocencius in France / yt which anon afught with the Romans
/ for they yaue him no dew honor. And for that cause / against ye popes will
he took the kingdom of Apulye from Frederyk / wherefore the pope cursyd him.
Then after the fourth year of his regne / the princes of Almayne made
Frederyk Emperor / and victoryously he subdued Otto. wyllyam of Paris this
time began the order of the freres Austyn / the which ben called (fratres
mendicantes) Franciscus an ytalyon a man of great perfeccyon and an ensample to
many a man / did many a miracle this time. And he ordained the friar Minors.
And the.vi. year of pope Innocencius the third / the order of the friar
prechers began under Domynyke / but it might not be confermed tylle the
first year Honorius.

Of king John^ / that in the first year of gis regne lost all Normandye.
AS king Richard was deed / by cause that he had none heir / another sone / ne
daughter / then^e his brother John^ was made king / and crowned at westmestre
of Hubert that tho was Archebysshop of Caunterbury. And when he began for to
regne / he became so meruaylous a man / and went over in to Normandye / and
warred upon the king of France. And so long they warred together / till at
the last king Johan lost all Normandy and Angoy / wherefore he was sore
anoyed / and it was no meruaylle. Tho let he assemble before him at London
Archebysshops / bishops / abbots / and pryours / Earls and Barons and held
there a great parlyament and axed there of the Clergy / the tenthe of every
church of England / for to conquer and get again Normandy and Angoy yt had
lost. They would not grant that thing / wherefore he was wonder wroth. And in
that same time deyed Hubert. The pryour and ye covent of Canterbury chose
against the kings will to be Archebysshop Stephen of Langton a good clerk /
that dwelled at the court of Rome / and sent to the pope their cleryon / and
the pope confermed it / and sacred him at Viterbi^ When the king wist these
tidings / he was wonder wroth / and drove ye pryour and the couente fro
Counterbury / and exyled out of England / and commanded that no letter that
come fro Rome / ne commandment / should be received ne pleryd in England.
When these tidings came to the pope / he sent king Johan his letter / and
prayed him with good will and good heart / that he would receive Stephen ye
Archebysshop of Caunterbury to his church / and suffer ye pryour and his
monks to come again to their own dwelling. But the king would not grant it
for no thing.

How king John^ would no thing do for the popes commandment. wherefore all
England was enterdyted and suspended.
ANd at the last the pope sent by his auctoryte / and enjoined to the bishops
of England / that if the king would not receive the pryour of Caunterbury and
his monks / that they should do general enterditinge through out all England.
And granted full power to four bishops to pronounce the enterdytynge / if he
it warned^ The first was bishop wyllyam of London / and that other bishop
Eustace of Ely / and the third was bishop Walter of wynchestre / and the
fourth was bishop Gyles of Hertforde. And these four bishops prayed the
king / knelynge on their knees / and sore werynge / that he would do ye popes
commandment. And showed him ye popes Bulls of the entertydynge / but for no
prayer that they might pray he would not consent thereto. And when ye bishops
saw this / they went fro the king. And in the morn after the Annunciacion of
our lady / they pronounced ye general enterdytynge thrughout all England so
that the church doors were shytte with keys and with other fastings and with
walls. And when the enterdytynge was pronounced / then the king began for
to wexe all out of mesure / and anon took in to his hand al ye possessions of
ye four bishops / and of all the clergy through out of all England / the
lord he took / and ordained men for to keep it / that the clerks might not
have their living. wherefore ye bishops cursyd all them / that put / or should
meddle with holy church goods / against the will of them that ought them. And
when the king would not of his malice cesse for no manner thing. These four
bishops before said went over the sea / and came to the bishop of Caunterbury
/ and told him all thing. And ye Archebysshop to them said / that they should
go again to Caunterbury / and he should come thither to them / or else he would
send unto them certain persons in his stead / that should do as much as of
he himself were there. And when the bishops herd this they turned again in
to England / and came unto Caunterbury. The tidings came to the king / that
the bishops were come again to Caunterbury / and himself might not come
thither that time he sent thither bishops Earls / and abbotes / for to create
with them / that the king should receive tharchebysshop Stephen / and the
pryour and all the monks of Caunterbury / that he should never after that time
no thing take of holy church against the will of them that owes ye goods.
And that the king should make full amends to them / of whom he had any goods
taken. And that holy church should have all fraunchyse / as ferforth as they
had in saint Edwardes time the holy Confessor.

How Stphen of Langton came again* in to England through the popes commandment
/ and how he went again.
SO when the form of accordemente thus was ordained. It was in a payer of
endentures / and their seals to that one par^e and they yt came in the kings
name put their seals to that other part of ye endentures. And four bishops
above said took that one part of the endentures to them. And that other part
of the endentures \ they bare with them to show to the king. When the king
saw the form and understood / he held him full well apayed of all manner
things as they had ordened / saving as touching / restytucyon of the goods
for to make again. To that thing would not accord / and so he sent word again
to the four bishops / that they should do out and put away that one point of
resty^ucyon. But they answered / that they would not do one word out. Tho
sent the king to the Archebysshop by the four bishops yt he should come to
Caunterbury for to speak with him there / and sent unto him saufcondyte under
pledges. that is to say / his Justices Gylbert Peyteum. Wyllyam de la Brener ^
and Johan fitz Hugh / that in their conduyte / sauely he should come and go
again at his own will And thus in this manner tharchebysshop Stephen came to
Caunterbury. when the Archebysshop was come / the king came to Chill^^ For he
would no nyghe Caynterbury at that time. But he sent by his Tresorer bishop
of wyncester yt he should do out of the endentures the clause of restytucyon /
for to make of ye goods And tharchebysshop made his oath that he would never
do out oo word thereof ne yet ^^ change of yt the bishops had spoken and
ordained. And tho the Archebyssop yede again to Rome without any more doing.
King Johan was wrother tha^ ever he was before and let make a common cry
through out all England / that all tho yt had holy church rentes / and went
over the sea / yt they should come again in to England at a certain day / or
else they should lose their rentes for ever more. And yt he commanded to every
Shyref through out all England / that they should inquire if any bishop abbot
or pryour / or any other Prelate of holy church / fro ye day afterward /
receive any commandment that comes fro the pope. That they should take the
body / and bring it before him / and that they should take in to the kings
hondes all their lands of holy church / that were give to any man / by the
Archebychop or by the pryour of Canterbury / from the time of eleccion of the
Archebysshop. And commanded that all the woods that were the Archebysshops
should be cast down unto the ground / and all sold.

How king John^ destroyed the order of Cesteaux.
ANd in the same year / the Irysshe men began to war upon king John / and
the king ordained him for to go in to Irlonde / and let arere an huge tax
thrughout al England / that is for to say.xxx. thousand mark. And thus he
sent through out all England unto monks of the order of Cisteaux that they
should help him of ^vi. thousand mark of silver. And they answered and said /
that they durst no thing do without their chyef abbot if Cisteaux. wherefore
king Johan when he came again from Irlonde / did them so much sorrow and care
/ that they wist not wheder to a bide / for he took so much raunson of every
house / and the sum amou^ted to.ix. thousand and.iiii. hundred mark / so
that they were clean lost and destroyed / and voyded cheyr houses and their
lands thrughout all England. And the abbot of wauersaye draded so much his
menace / that he forsook all the abbaye and went thens and pryuely ordained him
over the sea to ye house of Cisteaux. when the tidings came to the pope / that
the king has done so much malice / then he was to ward the king full wroth
And sent to Legates unto the king / that one was called Pandulf / and ye other
Duraunt / that they should warn the king in the popes name / that he should
cesse of his persecucion yt he did unto holy church / and amend the wrong
and the trespass / yt he had done to the Archebysshop of Caunterbury / and to
the pryour and unto the monks of Caunterbury / and to all the clergy of
England. And that he should rest ore all the goods again yt he had taken of
them against their will and else they should curse him by name / And to do this
thing / and to conferme the pope took them his letters in bulls patentes.
These two Legates came in to england / and came to the king to Northamton /
there yt he held his parlyamente / and full curteysly they him salewed and
said. Sir we come fro ye pope of Rome / the peace of the holy church and the
land to amend. And we admonest you first in the popes half / that ye make
full restytucyon of the goods yt ye have rauysshed and taken of holy church
and of the land. And that y^ receive Stephen Archebysshop of Caunterbury in to
his dygnytee / and the pryour of Caunterbury / and his monks. And that ye
yield again unto the Archebysshop all his lands and rentes / without any
withholdynge. And sir yet more over / yt ye shall make restytucyon / unto all
holy church / whereof they shall hold them well apayed. Tho answered the king
as touching the pryour and his monks of Caunterbury. All that ye have said I
will do gladly / and all thing yt ye will ordeyne. But as touching the
Archebysshop. I shall tell you in my heart as it lies. That the Archebysshop
leave his archebysshoppryche / and that ye pope then^e for him would pray / and
then^e upon adventure / me should like some other bysshopryche to give him in
England And upon this condicyon I will him accept and receive And nevertheless
as Archebysshop in England if he abide / he shall never have so goods
saufconduyte / but that he shall be take. Tho said Pandulf unto the king /
Sire holy church was wont never to dyscharge an Archebysshop without cause
reasonable. But ever it has be wont to chastyse princes / yt to god and holy
church were In obedyence. What how now said the king menace ye me. Nay said
Pandulf / But ye now openly have told / as it stands in your heart. And to
you we will tell what is the popes will. And thus it stands / yt he has you
holy enterdyted and accursyd / for the wrongs that ye have done to holy
church and to the clergy. And for as much as ye dwell / and beth in will to
abide in malice and in wretchedness / and will not come out thereof / ne to
amend ye shall understand / yt this time after ward the sentence is upon you
yeuen and holds stead and strength / and upon all tho that with you has
comuned before this time / whether they ben earls / barons / or knights / or
any other what so ever yt they be we them assoylle / saufly unto this day^ and
fro this time after ward of what condycyon someuer yt they ben we them accurse
/ yt with you comyne any word / and do wene sentence upon them openly and
specially And we assoyle clean / earls / barrns / knights / and all other me^
of their homages / seruyces and feautres / that they should unto you do / And
this tydynge to conferme / we give plain power / to the bishop of wynchestre
/ and the bishop of Norwhiche. And the same power we give in to Scotlo^de to
the bishop of Rochestre and of Salysbury. And in walys we give the same power
to the bishop of saint Dauyd and of Landaf and of saint Ass. And more over we
sent through out all Crystendom / that all the bishops beyond the sea / that
they do accurse all tho that help you / or any counseyl yeueth you in any
manner need that ye have to do in any part of the world. And we assoyle them
also all / by auctoryte of ye pope / and commau^de them also with you for to
fight / as with him that is enmye to all holy church. Tho answered ye king.
what may ye do more to me Tho answered Pandulf. we say to you in the word of
god / that ye ne no heyr that ye have / never after this day may be crowned.
Tho said ye kyne. By him that is almighty god / and I had wist this are that ye
came in to my land / that ye had brought me such tidings. I should have made
you ready all one year. Tho answered Pandulf / Full well wend we at our first
coming / that ye would have be obedyent to god and holy church / and have
fulfilled the popes commandment / and now we have showed unto you / and
pronounced the popes will / as we were charged therewith / And as now ye have
said / that if ye had wist the cause of our coming / that ye would have do us
to ride all an hole year. And as well ye might have said / that ye would have
taken an hoole year of respyte / by the popes leave. But for to suffer what death
ye could ordeyne / we shall not spare for to tell you holy all the popes
message and his will / that we were charged with.

How Pandulf delivered a clerk that had falsyd and counterfetyd the kings
money before the king himself.
ANd anon tho commanded the king the Syrefs and Baylyfs of Northampton /
that were in the kings presence / yt they should bring forth all ye prisoners
/ that they might be done to death before Pandulf / for by cause the king wened
that they would have gaynsayd their deeds / for cause of the death all thing
that they had spoken before When the prisoners were come before the king the
king commanded some to be hanged / and some to be drawn and some to draw
out their eyes out of their heed. And among all other / there was a clerk
that had falsyd ye kings money. And the king commanded that he shoyde be
hanged and drawed^ And when Pandulf herd this commandment of the king / he
sterte him up right quyckly / and anon axed a book and a candell / and would
have cursyd the king / and all them that would set upon ye clerk any
hand. And Pandulf him self went for to seek a cross. And the king followed
him / and delivered him the clerk by the ho^de that he should do with him
what he would. And thus was the clerk delivered and went thens. And Pandulf
and Duraunt his fellow went fro the king / and came again to the pope of Rome.
And told him that king Johan would not amended be. But ever abode so acrcusyd
And nevertheless the pope granted that year thorughout all England that
priests might sing mass in couenable chyrches / and consecrate our lords
body ^ and give it to syke men which were lykely to pass out of this world.
And also that men might christian chyldern over all the land. And when the pope
wist and saw that the king would not be under the rule of holy church for
no manner thing. The pope then^e sent to the king of France in remysseon of
his sins / that he should take with him all the power that he might / and go
in to England for to destroy the king Johan When these tydyges came to king
Johan / then was he sore anoyed and sore dradde lest he should lose his reame
and him self be done to the death. Then sent he to the pope messengers and
said. He would be Justified / and come to amendment in all things / and
would make satysfaccyon to all manner of men after the popes ordinance. Then^e
sent the pope again in to England Pandulf and other messenger / and came to
Caunterbury to the king and there abode^ And the.viii. day of May / the king
made another for to stand to the popes ordinance / before Pandulf ye Legate
in all manner of things in which he was accursyd. And that he should make full
restytucyon to all me^ of holy church and of relygyon / and of the goods that
he had taken of them against their will And all the great lords of England
swore upon the book and by their holydom / that if ye king would not hold his
oath / they said ye they would by strength make him hold it. Then put the
kymge him to the court of Rome / and then gaaf he up the reame of England
and of Irlonde for him and for his heyers for ever more that should come after
him / so that king Johan and his heyers should take the two reames of the
popes hondes And should every year pay ferme unto the court of Rome a
thousand mark of silver. And tho took ye king ye crown of his heed and sete
it upon his knees And these words said he in herynge of all ye great lords of
England. Here Iresygne up the crown and the reame of England in to the pope
Innocencius hondes the third / and put me holy in his mercy and in his
ordinance. Tho received Pandulf the crown of king John^ and kept it ^yue
days as fore ceasing / taking of two realms / of England and of Irlonde.
And co^fermed all manner things by his Chartre that follows afer.

Of the letetr oblygatorye ye king John^ made to the court of Rome / wherefore
the Peter's pens ben gadred thrughout al England.
TO all christian people throghout all the world dwelling. Johan by the grace

And for asmoche as we have need unto the mercy of our lord Ihesu christ. And
also we may no thing so worthy of^re / as competent satysfaccyon to make to

and so to all the popes that comes after him / in the same manner above said.
And in presence of the wise man Pandulf ye popes Subdeaken / we make lyeges

points against all manner men by our power through goods help.

How the clerks that were outlawed came again and how king Johan was
assoylled.
SO when this chartre was made and ensealed / the king received again his
crown of Pandulfus hand And sete anon unto the Archebysshop Stephen / and to
all his other clerks and lewede men / that he had exyled out of this land /
that they should come again in to England / and have again their lands and
allo their rentes. And that he would make restytucyon of the goods that he had
taken of theyrs against their will. The king himself tho and Pandulf and earls
and barons went unto wynchestre against the Archebysshop Stephen. And when he
was come the king went against him and fell adowne to his feet / and thus to
him said. Fair sire ye be welcome. And I cry you mercy by cause that I have
trespassed against you. The Archebysshop took him up tho in his arms / and
kyssyd him curteysly oftentimes / and after led him to ye door of saint
Swythunes church by the hand / and assoylled him of the sentence / and him
reconsyled to god and to holy thyrche. And that was on saint Margaretes day.
And the Archepysshop anon went for to sing mass. And the king offered at the
mass a mark of gold. And when the mass was done / all they went for to
receive their lands / without any manner gaynsayenge. And that day they made
all mirth and Joy enough. But yet was not the enterdytynge releaced / by cause
the pope had set that the enterdytynge should not be done / till the king
had made full restytucyon of the goods that he had taken of the holy church.
And that him self should do homage to the pope by a certain Legate / that he
should send in to England. And then took Pandulf his leave of the king and
the Archebysshop / and went again unto Rome. And the Archebysshop anon let
come before him prelates of holy church at Redynge / for to treat and
counseyll how much / and what they should axe of the king / for to make
restytucyon of the goods that he had taken of them. And they ordained and
said that the king should give to the Archebysshop three thousand mark for the
wrong that the king had done unto him. And also by procyons to other
clerks.xv. thousand mark. And the same time Nycolaus bishop of Tuscam
Cardynall Penytenciarius of Rome came in to England through the popes
conmaundement / the fyfth kalendas of Octobre and came to London / the fyfth
Nonas of Octobre / for by cause that king Johan and all the kings that came
after him / should ever more hold the reame of England and of Irlonde / of
god and of the pope / payenge to the pope by year as it is above said.

How the enterdytynge was undone in England / and of the debate that was
between king Johan and the barons of the reame.
AS king Johan had done his homage to the Legate that showed him the popes
letter / that he should pay to Iulyan and yelne again that was king Rychardes
wife the third part of the land of England and of Irlonde that he had
withholde sith that king Richard deyed. When king John^ herd this / he was
wonder wroth. For utterly yt enterdytynge might not be undone till yt he had
made gre^ and restytycyon to the foresaid Iulyan / of that she asked. The Legate
went then again to the pope after Crystmasse. And ye king sent over see to
Iulyan that was king Rychardes wife for to have a relate of that she axed of
him. And so it befell that Iulyan deyed anon after Eester. And in so much the
king was quyte of that thing that the axed. But then at the feast of saint
Johan that came next after / thorugh the popes commandment / the
enterdytynge was first releasyd thrughout all England (...) day of Iulii.
And.vii. year was the land ^terdyted. And on the morning m^n rough and said
mass thorugh out all London and so ^^ter thorugh out all Englonde^ And the
ne^^ year after there began a great debate between king Johan and the lords
of England ^or by cause that he would not grant the law^^ and hold / the
which saint Edward had ordeyn^d / and had been used and holden unto that time
that he had them broken. For he would hold no law / but did all thing that
him lyked / and dysheryted many men without consent of lords and perys of ye
land. And wo^ dysheryte the good earl Radulf of Chestre for by cause that he
undertook him of his wickedness / and for by cause that he did so much shame
and vylany to god and to holy church* And also for he held and haunted his
own brothers wife / and lay also by many wymmen great lords daughters. For
he spared no woman that him lyked for to have. wherefore all the lords of the
land were wroth / and took the cite of London. To cesse this debate the
Archebysshop and lords of the land assenbled before the feast of saint John^
Bap^yst in a medowe beside the town of Stanys / that is called Romney mede.
And the king made them there a chartre of fraunchyse / such as they would axe
/ and in such manner they we^e accorded / and that accordement lasted not full
long. For the king himself soon after dyed against the points of the same
chartre that he had made. wherefore the most part of the lords of the land
assembled and began to war upon him again / and brenned his towns / and
robbed his folk / and did all the sorrow that they might / and made them as
strong as they might with all the power they had / and thought to drive him
out of England / and make Lowys the kings sone of France king of England.
And king John^ sent tho over see and ordained so much people of Normans / and
of Pycardes / and of Flemynges / so that the land might not sustain them /
but with much sorrow. And among all this people ^ there was a man of
Normandye that was called Fawkis of Brent / and this Norma^ and his company
spared another chirches ne houses of relygyon / but they burnt and ^obbed it /
and bare a way a^l that they might take so that the land was all destroyed /
what one side and other. The barons and lords of Englonge ordained among
them the best spekers and wysest men / and sent them over the sea to king
Phylyp of France / and prayed him / that he would send Lowys his sone in to
England to be king of England / and to receive the crown.

How Lowys the knges sone of France came in to England with a strong power
of people ^ to be king of Englonde^
Anon as king Phylyp of France herd these tidings / he made certain
alyaunce between them by their comune eleccyon / that Lowys king Phylyps sone
of France should go with them in to England / and drive out king Johan of
the land. And all that were in presence of Lowes / made unto him homage / and
became his men. And the Barons of England held them still at London / and
abode Lowys the kings sone of France. And this was the next Saterdaye before
the Ascensyon of our lord / that Lowys came into England with a strong
power. And that time king John^ had taken all the castles of England in to
Alyens hondes / And tho came Lowwys / and besyeged Rochestre castle / and
took yt with strength. And the thursdaye in wytson weke let hang all the
Alyens that were therein / And ye Thursdaye next se wynge / he came to London /
and there he was received with much honur of the lords that abode him there /
and all to him made homage. And after ward on the Tewysdaye next after the.
Trynyte sunday he took the castle of Reigate. And on the morrow after the
castle of Gilforde / and the Frydaye next after the castle of Farneham. And
the Mondaye next after the cite of wynchestre to him was yolde / and the
morrow after Saint Iohans day the manner of wu^ueseye to him yelden* And the
Tewysdaye after the Vtas of saint Peter and Poule they took the castle of
Odyham. And the mondaye after saint / Margaretes day / he ordained him to ward
Bawmore / for to syege the castle / and there he dwelled.xv. days and might
not get the castle / and then went he thens and came to London and the
Toure to him was yolden.

How ye pope se^te in to England a legate yt was called Swalo and of ye death
of king Johan.
ANd in the same time the pope sent in to England a Legate / that was called
Swalo / and he was priest Cardynall of Rome / for to mayntene king Iohans
cause / against the barons of England. But the barons had so huge part and
help / thorugh lowys the kings sone of France / that king John^ wist not to
^orne ne go. And so it befell that he would have gone to Nycholl^ And as he
went thither ward / he came by the abbaye of Swynes head / and there he abode
two days And as he sat at mete / he axed a monk of ye house how much that a
loof was wroth that was set before him upon the table / And the monk said
that the loof was wroth but an half penny. O said the king tho. Here is great
chepe of bread. Now said he tho / and I may leave any while such a loof shall
be wroth.xx. shelynges or half a year be gone. And so when he said this word
/ much he thought / and often he syghed / and took and ete of the bread / and
said by god / ye word that I have spoken / it shall be sothe^ The monk that
stood before the king was for this word full sorry in his heart / and thought
rather he would him self suffer death / and thought if he might ordeyne therefore
some manner remedy. And anon the monk went unto his abbot and was shryuen of
him / and told the abbot all that the king had said. And prayed his abbot for
to assoyle him / for he would give the king such a drink that all England
should be glad thereof and Joyful Tho yede the monk in to a gardeine / and
found a great tode therein / and took her up and put her in a cup and prycked
the tode thorugh with a broche many times till that the venym came out of every
side in the cup And tho took the cup and fyllyed it with good ale / and
brought it before the king knelynge saying. Sir said he wassayll / for ever
the days of all your life drunk ye of so good a cup. Begyne monk said the
king. And the monk drank a great draught / and took the king the cup /
and ye king drank also a great draught / and set down the cup. The
monk anon right went in to farmere and there deyed anon / on whoos soul god
have mercy Amen. And five monks sing for his soul specially / and shall
while that the abbaye stands. The king rose up anon full evil at ease and
commanded to remeue the table / and axed after the monk. And men told him
that he was deed / for his womb was broken in sondre. When ye king herd this
/ he commanded for to trusse / but it was for naught / for is belly began to
swelle for the drink yt he had dronke / and within two days he deyed on ye
morrow after saint Lukys day / and had many fair chyldern of his body begaten
/ that is to say. Henry his sone yt was king after Johan his fader / and
Richard that was Earl of Cornewaylle / and ysabell that was Empress of Rome /
and Elenore that was queen of Scotlonde. And this king Johan when he had
reigned.xiiii. year and five months and five days / he deyed in the castle
of ne work. And his body was buried at wynchestre.

Anno dm^.M.CC.
FRedericus the second was Emperor xxx. year / This man was crowned of
Honorius the pope against Otto for by cause that he should fight with him / the
which he did / and expulsyd him. And first he nourysshed the church / and
afterward he dyspoyled it / as a stepmoder^ wherefore Honorius cursyd him / and
all tho that were contrary to his opinion the pope assoyled. And the same
sentence Gregorius the.ix. renewed And this same man put Henry his own sone in
to prison / and there murdered him. wherefore when this Emprerour an other season
was like / by an other sone of his own he was murdered / in the time of
Innocentius the fourth. Honorius the third was pope after Innocencius.x. year
/ and confermed the order of friar Prechers and Mynors^ And made certain
Decretalles.

Of king Henry the third that was crowned at Gloucetree
ANd after this king Johan reigned his sone Henry / and was crowned at
Gloucette when he was.ix. year old / on saint Symondes day and Iyde of Swalo
the Legate of Rome through counseyll of all the great lords that held with
king Johan his fader that is to say / the earl Radulf of Chestre. wyllyam
earl Marshall earl of Penbroke. Wyllyam ye Brener earl of Feries. Serle ye
manly baron. And all other great lords of England held with Lowys the kings
sone of France. And anon after when king Henry was crowned Swalo the Legate
held his counseyll at Brystowe at saint Martyns feast. And there were xi.
byssops of England and of walys / and of other prelates of holy church a
great nombre / and earls and barons / and many knights of England. And all
tho that were at that counseyll swore feawte unto Henry the king that was king
Iohn^s sone. And anon after the Legate enterdyted walys / for cause that they
held with the barons of England. Also all tho that help / or yaue any
counseyll to meue war against the new king Henry he accursyd them. And at
the beginning he put in the sentence the kings sone of France Lowys. And
nevertheless the same Lowys would not spare for all that. But went and took the
caastell of Barchamstede / and aleso ye castle of Hirtfo^ And from that day
afterward / the Barons did there so much harm thrughout all England. And
pryncypally ye frensshemen that were with king Lowys. wherefore the great
lords / and all the common people of England let them dress / for to drive
Lowys and his company out of England / but some of the barons and Frensshemen
were gone to the cite of Nycholl / and took the town and held it to king
Lowys profit. But thither came king Henryes men with a great power / that is
to say the earl Radulf of Chestre / and Wyllyam earl Marshall / and Wyllyam
the Brenererle of Feryers and many other lords with them / and yaue battle
unto Lowys men. And there was slain the earl of perchees and Lowys men were
foul dyscomfyted. And there was taken Serle earl of wynchestre / and
Humfroyde. Boune earl of Hertforde / and Robert the sone of walter / and many
other that began war against the king / there they were taken and ladde unto
king Henry / that was king Iohn^s sone. And when the tidings came to Lowys of
the dyscomfyture / yt was the kings sone of France. He remeued fro thens and
went unto London / and let shytte the yates fast of the cite. And anon
after the king sent to the Burgeys of London / that they should yield them
unto him / and the cite also. And he would them grant all their fraunchyses
that ever they were wont to have before. And would conferme them by his great
new chartre under his broad scale.

And in the same time a great lord that was called Eustace the monk came out
of France with a great company of Lords / and would have come in to England
/ for to have helped Lowys the kings sone of France. But Hubert of Brugh /
and ye five por^es with.viii. ships tho met with them in ye high see ^ and
assaylled them egerly / and over came them with strength / and smote of Eustace
the monks heed. And took also.x. great lords of France and put them in to
prison. And slew almoost all the men that came with them / and anon drowned
the ships in the sea.

How Lowys corned again in to France / and of ye confermacyon of king Iohans
hartre.
SO when Lowys herd these rydynges he dradde sore to be deed and lost. And
let or^^yne / and speak between the king and Lowys by the Legate Swalo And
through the Archebysshop of Caunterbury / and through other great lords that
all the prisoners on that one half and that other should be delyuerd and go
quyte. And Lowys him self should have for his costs a thousand pound of
silver. and should go out of England / and come neure more there in again. And
in this manner was ye accord made between king Henry and Lowys. And tho was
Lowys assoylled of the popes Legate / ye was called Swalo of the sentence that
he was in / and the Barons of England also. And after this king Henry and
Swalo the Legate and Lowys went to Merton and there was the peace co^fermed /
and between them ordained. And after Lowys went from thens unto London and
took his leave and was brought with much honor unto the sea with the
Archebysshop of Caunterbury and with other bishops / and also with earls and
barons / and so went in to France. And after ward the king and the
Archebysshop / and also earls and barons assembled them and came to the cite of
London at Myghelmas that next came tho sewynge and held there a great
parliament at London / And there were tho reuewed all the frau^chyse ye king
John^ had granted / at Romney mede \ and king Henry tho confermed by his
chartre / the which yet ben holden through out all England. And in that time
the king took of every plough lord.ii. shleynges / and Hubert of Brugh was
made tho cheyf Justice of England And this was in the fourth year of king
Henryes regne And in the same year was saint Thomas of Caunterbury translated
the.l. year after his martyrdom. And after it was ordained by all the lords
of England / that all Alyens sold go out of England / and come no more
therein. And king Henry took tho all the castelles in to his hand / ye king
Johan his fader had give and take to Alyens for to keep yt held with him. But
the proud Fawkys of Brytayn rychely let array his castle of Bedforde /
which he had of king Iohn^s yefte / and held that castle against king
Henryes will with might and strength. And the king came thither with a strong
power / and besyeged the castle. And the Archebysshop master Stephen of
Langton / with a fair company of knights came to the king him for to help.
And from the Ascensyon of our lord unto the Assumpcyon of our lady lasted the
syege. And tho was the castle won and take. And the kynhe let hang all tho
that went in to the castle with their good will. for to hold the castle.
That is for to say.lxxx. men. And tho after ward fawkys himself was found
and had in a church at Couentre / and there he forswore all England with
much shame / and went again in to his own country. And whiles that king
Henry reigned. Edmonde of Abyndon / that was ^relorer of Salysbury was
consecrated Archebysshop of Caunterbury. And this king Henry sent over the sea unto the earl of prouynce / that he should lend him his daughter in
England / that was called Ellenore / and he would spowse her. And tho she came
in to England after Crystmas. And on the morrow after saint Hylaryes day / ye
Archebysshop Edmonde spowsed them together at westmestre with great solempnyte.
And there was a sweet sight between them. That is to say Edward that was
next king after his fader / flower of curteysy and of largeness and
Margarete that was after quen of Scotlonde / and Beautrice that was after
countess of Brytayne / Katheryne that deyed maid in relygyon.

Of the quinzeme of goods that were granted for ye new chartre / and of the
purueaunce of Oxforde.
ANd thus it befell that ye lords of England would have some addycyous moo in
the chartre of Fraunchyse that they had of the king / and spoke thus between
them. And ye king granted them all their axenge. And made to them two
chartres / that one is called the great chartre of fraunchises / and that other
is callad the chartre of forest. And for the grant of these two chartres /
prelates / Earls and Barons / and all the comyns of England / yaue to the
king a thousand mark of silver. When king Henry had be king.xliii. year the
same year he and his lords / Earls and Barons of the reame went to Oxforde /
and ordained a law in amendment of the reame. And first swore the king
himself / and afterward all the lords of the land / that they would hold
that statute for evermore / and who that them brake should be deed. But the
second year after that ye ordinance / the king through counseyll of Edward
his sone / and of Richard his brother / that was earl of Cornwaylle / and also
of other repented him of that oath that he made for to hold that law and
ordynau^ce^ And sent to ye courtre of Rome to be assoylled of that oath. And
in the year next coming after / was the great darth of corn in England For a
quarter of whete was worth.xxiiii. shelynges. And the poor people ete netles
and other wedes for hu^gre. And deyed many a thousand for defawte of mete. And
in ye.xlviii. year of king Henryes regne began war and debate between him
and his lords / for by cause he had broken the couenauntes that were made
between them at Oxforde. And ye same year was the town of Northamton taken /
and folk slain that were within / For by cause that they had ordained wild
fire for to brenne the cite of London. And in the monethe of May that the next
after / upon saint Pancras day / was the Battle of jews / that is to say /
the wenesday before Saint Du^stans day. And there was taken king Henry him
self / and sir Edward his sone / and Richard his brother earl of Cornewaylle /
and many other lords. And in the same year nextse wynge sir Edward the kings
sone brake out of the ward of sire Symonde of Mountforth / earl of Leycetre at
Hertforde / and went unto the barons of the March / and they rceeyued him
with much honor. And the same time Gylbert of Claraunce earl of Glocetre that
was in the ward also of the foresaid Simon de thorugh the commandment of
king Henry / that went fro him with great heart / for cause that he said /
that ye foresaid Gylbert was a fool / and held him with king Henry And on the
Saterdaye next after the mids of August / sire Edward the kings sone
dyscomfyted sir Symonde de Mountforth ac Kelyngworth / but the great lords
that were there with him were taken / that is to say. Baldewyne wake. And
Wyllyam de Mouchentye and many other great lords. And the Tewysdaye next after
was ye battle done at Eusba^. And there was slain sir Symonde de Mou^tforth.
Hugh the Spenser / and Mountforth that was Raufe Bassectes fader of Drayton and
other many great lords / And when this battle was done / all the gentylmen
that had been with the earl Symonde were dyshery^ed / and ordained together and
did much harm to all the land. For they destroyed their enmyes in all that
they might.

Of the syege of Kenylworth and how ye ge^tylmen were dysheryted thorugh
counseyll of the lords of the reame of England and how they came again and
had their lands.
ANd the next year coming in May / the fourth day before the feast of saint
Dunstane / was the bataylle and scomfyture are Chestrefelde / of them that were
dysheryted / and there was many of them slayne^ And Robert Earl of Feriers
there was take / and also Baldewyne wake / and Johan delahay / with much
sorrow escaped thens. And oon saint Iohan^ the Baptyst tho sewynge / began the
syege of the castle Kenylworth / and the syege lasted to saint Thomas eve the
appostle. in which day sir Hugh Hastynge had the castle for to keep / yt
yielded up the castle unto the king in this manner / that himself and the
other yt were within the castle / should have their lives and lymme / and as
much thing as they had therein both horse and harneys / and four days of
repyte / for to deliver clenly the castle / of them self and of all other manner
thing / as they had within ye castle / and so they went fro the castle.
And sir Symonde Nou^tforth the younger / and the countess his mo^ were gone
over ye see in to France / and there held them as people yt were exyled out
of England for ever. And soon after it was ordained by the Legate Octobone /
and by other great lords / the wysest of England that all tho that had be
ayenste the king and were dysheryted / should have again their lands by
grievous rau^sons / after that it was ordained. And thus they were accorded with
the king and peace cried thorughout all England and thus the war was ended.
And when yt was done the Legate took his leave of the king and of the queen /
of ye great lords of England and went tho to Rome the.lv. year of king
Henryes regne ^ and Edward king Iohn^s sone of Brytayne Johan Vessi. Thomas
of Clare. Rogere of Clyfforde. Oaths of Grau^stone Robert le Brus. John^ of
Verdon / and many other lords of England / and of beyond the sea took their
way to ward the holy land. And the king Henry deyed in the same time at
westmestre / when he had reigned.lv. year and.xix. wekes / on saint Edmonds day
the Archebysshop of Caumterbury. And he was enteryd on saint Edmondes day the
king / in the year of the Incarnacyon of our lord Ihesu Christ.M.CC.lxxii.

Prophecye of Merlyn of the king Henry the the expowned that was king Iohans
sone.
ANd of this Henry prophesied Merlyn and said / that a lamb should come out of
wynchestre / in the year of ye Incarnacyon of our lord Ihesu criste.M.CC.
and.xvi. with true lyppes and holiness written in his heart / And he said sothe
/ for the good Henry the king was borne in wynchestre / in the year abouesayd
/ and he spoke good words and sweet / and was an holy man and of good
consyence. And Merlyn said / that this Henry should make the fairest place of
the word / that in his time should not be fully ended / and he said soth. For
he made the new work of the abbaye of saint Peter's church at westmestre / yt
is fayrer of sight than any other place yt any man knows thorugh out al
crystendom. But king Henry deyed are that work were fully at an end / and
that was great herme. And yet said Merlyn / yt this lamb should have peace the
most part of his regne And he said full soth / for he was never noyed thorugh
war / neither dyseased in no manner wise / a little before his death / and
Merlyn said in his prophecye more / and in ye regne and end of the foresaid
lamb / a wulf of a strange land shall do him much harm thorugh his war /
and that he should at ye last be master thorugh help of a reed fox / that
should come forth of the North west and should him overcome. And that he
should drive him out of the water / and ye prophecye full well was known. For
within a little time or ye king deyed Symonde of Mou^tforde Earl of Leycerre /
yt was borne in France / began ayenste him strong war / thorugh which
doing / many a good bacheler destroyed was and deyed / and dysheryted. And
when kyng^ Henry had the vyctory at Eusham / and Symonde the earl was slain
thorugh help and might of Gylbert of clare earl of Glocetre / that was in
keeping and ward of the forsayde Symonde / through ordinance of king Henry
that went again unto the king with much power. wherefore the foresaid Symonde
was destroyed and that was great harm to the comyns of England / that so good
a man was slain for the troth / and deyed in thar^y^e / and for the common
profit of the same folk / and therefore almighty god for him has syns showed
many a fair miracle to diverse men and wymmen of ye sykenesse and dyscease that
they have had for the love of him And Merlyon also said in his prophecye / that
afer that time / the lame should live no while / and then his seed should be
in strange land without any pasture / and he said sothe / for king Henry
lived no while after that Symonde Mounforde was slain / that king Henry ne
deyed anon after him. And in the mean time sire Edward his sone / that was
the best king of the world of honor / was tho in the holy land and gate
there. Acres. And in that country he begat there upon dame Elenore his wife
Johan of Acres his daughter / that afterward was countess of Glocetre / and
made such a vyage in the holy land / that all the world spoke of his
knyghthode / and every man dradde him hye and low thorughout all crystendome /
as the storye of him tells / as afterward ye shall here more openly. And
from the time yt king Henry deyed / till that sir Edward was crowned king /
all the great lords of England were as faderles childern without any socoure /
that them might mayntene and govern / and defend against their deedly enmyes.

GRegorius the.ix. was pope after Honorius / this man canonysed many saints /
and defended myghtely ye church against Frederyk / therefore the took many
prelates and two Cardynalles / the which went to counseyll against him This
pope was segyd in the cite of Rome by the Emperor / and he saw the Romayne

there was great strife many year. At the last decessyd Richard / and Alphonsus
came agaye before Gregorius the.ix. by the sign of peace ^ and utterly renou^ced
all this title of the Empire and he had any / for he was a very wytty man /
and a noble astronemer / and his tables ben very famous the which he made /
for they be compendyons Clemens the fourth was pope after Vrbanus.iii. year
and.ix^ months this Cleme^s was an holy man / and said through the spyryte of
prophecy / yt the enmyes of the church should perysshe as the smoke. And it is
to byleued that god cessyd the trybulacyons of the church thorugh his merytes.

counseyll of the Greeks and the Tartars were and there the Greeks promised to
be reformed by the unity of the church. And the Tartars were but a little
before baytysed / and promised the same. And there were gadred.vi.C. bishops
and.M. prelates / and therefore a certain man said Gregorius gadred together
all kind of people / and there was decreed / that all persons and vycaryes
should be called priests / and no prelates / and yt no man should assygne his
tithes to what church he would / and they dyed before. But they should be paid

them took at their own will / without any chalenge^r And after came sire
Edmonde king Edwardes brother a curteys knight and a gentle of renown / and
the earl of Corn wayllle / and the earl of Glocestre. And after then came

ladde in their hand an hundred knights gayly dysgysed in their arms. And
when they were alyghted of their horses / they let them go whether that they
welde / and who yt might them catch / them to have still without any challenge.
And when all this was done / king Edward did his dylygence and his might for
to amend and dress the wrongs in the best manner that he might to the
honor of god and holy church / and to mayntene his honor / and to amend
the noyannce of the common people.

How ydeyne that was Lewelyns daughter of walys / prince Aymer / that was ye
earls brother of Mou^forde were taken in the sea.
THe first afterward ye king Edward was crowned Lewelyn prince of wales
sent in to Faraunce to the earl Mou^forde / that thorough cou^seyl of his
friends / ye earl should wedde his daughter. And the earl tho auysed him upon
this thing / and sent unto Lewelyn and said. that he would send after his
daughter. and so he sent Aymer his brother after the damoysell. and Lewelyn
arrayed shyphes for his daughter and for Sire Aymer. and for her faare company
that should goo with her. And this Lewelyn did great wrong. for it was
couenau^ted that he should give his daughter to no manner man / without
counsel and consent of king Edward. And so it befell that a Burgeys of
Brystow came in the sea with wine laden. and met them and took them with
might and power. And anon the Burgeys sent them to the king. And when Lewely
herd this tidings he was very wroth / and also sorowfull^ and began to war
upon king Edward and did much harm unto Englysshmen / and beat down ye
kings castles / and began for to destroy king Edwardes land. And wha^
tidings came unto ye king of this thing he went in to walys and so much he
did thorough gods grace and his great power that he drofe Lewelyn unto great
myschyef / that he fled all manner of strength and came and yielded him unto
king Edward. and yaue him.l. mark of silver to have peace. And took the
damoysell and all his heritage. and made an oblygaco^n to king Edward to come
to his parlyamente two times of the year And in the second year after that
king Edward was crowned / he held a general parleamente at westmestre /
and there he made the statutes for defaute of law by the comune assent of all
his baronage / and at Ester next sewenge / the king sent by his letter unto
Lewelyn prince of wales that he should come to his parliament for his land /
and for his holding in wales / as the strenthe of his letter oblygatory
wytnessyd. Tho Lewelyn had scorn and dyspyte of the kings commandment / And
for pure wrache again began war upon king Edward. and destroyed his land.
And tho when king Edward herd of these tidings / he wexed wonder wroth unto
Lewelyn and in have assembled his people / and went him to ward wales. And
warred so upon Lewelyn the prince / till that he brought him in much sorrow
and disease. And Lewelyn saw that is defense might him not auaylle / and came
again / and yielded him to ye kings grace / and cried him mercy. and long time
kneled before the kings foot. The king had of him pity / and commanded him
for to arise. And for his mekenes foryaue him his wrath / and to him said /
that if he trespassed to him a another time that he would dystroye him for
evermore. David that was Lewelyns brother that same time dwelled with king
Edward / and was a fell man and a subtle and enuyous and also far casting
/ and much treason thoughte^ and evermore made good semblame / and semyd so
true that no man might perceive his falsnes.

How Lewelyn through eggynge of his brother Dauyd werryd again upon king Edward
IT was not long after that time ye king Edward yaaf to Dauyd Lewelyns
brother the lordshyppe of Frodesham. and made him a knight and so much honor
did he never after to man of walys by cause of him king Edward held his
parlemente at London when he had do in walys that he would and changed his
money / that was full ill kytte / wherefore the people playned sore. So that
the king enquered of the trespassours. And three houndred were atteynted of
such manner falsnes / wherefore some where hanged and sum drawn and after
hangyd. And afterward the king ordained / that the sterlynge halfpeny should
go thorugh out all his land / And commanded that no man fro that day
afterward yaue ne feoffed house of religyo^ with land / tenemente without
special leave of the king. And he yt did should be punysshed at the kings
will / and the yeft shall be for naught. And it was not long after ye Lewelyn
prince of walys through the tycemente of Dauyd his brother / and both their
consent / they thought to dysheryte king Edward / in asmoche as they might /
so that thorugh them both ye kings peace was broken. And when king Edward
herd of this / anon he sent his barons in to Northumberlonde and the Surreys
also / yt they should go and take their vyage upon ye traitors Lewelyn and
Dauyd. And wonder herd it was for to war tho / For it is winter i^ walys /
when in other cou^tres is Somer. And Lewelyn let ordeyne and well arrayed and
vytayll his good castle of Swandon. and was there in an huge nombre of people /
and plente of vytaylles so that king Edward wist not where for to enter And
when the kings men it perceyuer and also the strenth of walys they let come
in the sea bargees and botes. and great plankys as many as they might ordeyne
and have: for to go to the said castle of Swandon. with men on foot and also
on horse. But the walsshmen had so much people / and were so strong. that they
drove the Englysshmen again / so yt there was so much press of people at ye
tornynge again that ye charge and the burden of men made ye bargees and the
botes to synke and there was drowned many a good kynght / yt is to say. sir
Robert Clyfford sir wyllyam of Lyndeseye yt was^ sire Iohn^s sone Fitz Robert.
and sir Rychard Tanny and a^ huge nombre of other / and all was through there
own folly. For if they had had good espyes / they had not be harmyd. when king
Edward herd tell that his people were so drowned* He made sorrow enough. but
tho came sir Johan of Vessy from the king* Aragon. And brought with him much
people of bachelors and of Gascoynes / and were souldyurs. And dwelled with the
said John of Vessy and received of him wages and with him were witholde. and
noble men they were for to fight and burnt many towns / and slew much
people of walsshmen. All that they might take. And all tho with strenth and
might made assawte unto the castle of Swandon and gate the castle / And when
Dauyd the prence brother herd of this tidings he ordained him to flight and
Lewelyn the prince saw that his brother was fled / then he was sore abashed
for he had no power to his war for to mayntene. And so Lewelyn began for to
flee / and wind well for to have scapedde. But in a morrow sire Roger mortymer
met with him oonly with.x. knights. And set him round about. And to him
went / and smote of his heed / and presented ye same heed unto king Edward.
And in this manner Lewelyn the prince of walys was taken / and his heed smyten
of / and also all his heirs dysheryted for evermore through right full dome of
all the lords of the reame.

How Dauyd that was Lewelyns brother prince of walys was put to death.
David that was the princes brother of walys / through pride wend to have be
prince of walys / after his brothers death / and upon this he sent after
walsshemen to his parleament at Dynbygh and folysshely made walys to arise
against the king and began to meue war against king Edward and did all the
sorrow and disease that he might by his power. when king Edward herd of
this thing / he ordained men to pursewe upon him. And Dauyd fyersly him
defended / till ye he came to the towned of saint Morice / and there was Dauyd
take as he fled. and ladde to the king. And the king commanded that he
should be hangyd and drawn / and smite of his heed / and quarter him / and
send his head to London and the four quarters send to the four chyef towns
of walys. For they should take ensample thereof and beware. And afterward king
Edward let cry his peace through out all walls and seized all the land in to
his hand and all the great lords that were left alive came to do feaute and
homage to the king Edward as to their kind lord / And tho let king Edward
amend the laws of walys that were defectyue And he sent to all ye lords of
walys by letter patentes / that they should come all to parliament And when they
were come you king said to them full curteysly lordynges ye be welcome / and me
behooves your counseyll and your help for to go unto Gascoyne for to amend
the trespass yt to me was done when I was there And for to entreat of peace
between the king of Aragon and the prince of Morrey / and all ye kings lyege
men earls and barons consented and granted thereto. And tho made him king
Edward ready and went in to Gascoyne. and let amend all the trespasses yt him
was done in Gascoyne. And of the debate yt between the king of Aragon and the
prince of Morrey he sessyd and made them accorded. And while good king Edward
and Elynore his wife were in Gascoyne. The good earl of Cornewayll was made
wardeyn of England till that king Edward came again. And tho enquered he of
his traitors yt coniected falsenesse against him. And each of them all
received there dome after that they had deserve. But in the mean time that the
good king Edward was beyond the sea to do / them for to make amends that
against him had trespassyd there was a false the if / a traytoure that was called
Rysap Merydok / began for to make werre against king Edward. and yt was for
cause of sir pain Typtot. wrongfully grieved and dysceased the forsayde Rysap
meradok. And when king Edward herd all this matere and it well understood
anon he sent by his letter pryue seal to the foresaid Rebellyo^ Rysap Merydok
that he should begin in no manner wise for to make and reyse werre but yt he
should be in peace for his love / and when he came again in to England he would
under take the quarrel and amend al yt was mysdon. This foresaid Rysap Merydok
despised the kings commandment and spared not to do all the sorrow that he
might to the kings men of England But anon after he was take and ladde to
york / and there he was drawn and hangyd for his felonye.

Of dressyng that king Edward made of his Justices and of his clerks that
they had done for there falsnes and how he drove the Jews out of England for
there usury and mysbyleue.
AS king Edward had dwelled three year in Gascoyne a desire came to him for to
goo in to England again. And when he was come again he found so many playntes
made to him of his Justices and of his clerks that had done so many wrongs
and falsnesse yt wonder it was to here and for which falsnesse sire Thomas
waylond ye kings Justice / for swore England at the toure of London / for
falsnesse that me^ put upon him / wherefore he was atteynt / and proved fals^
And anon after when the king had done his will of the Justices tho let he
enquere and espy how the Jews dysceyued and begyled his people / thorugh the
sin of falsnesse and of usury. And let ordeyne a preuy parliament among his
lords. And they ordained among them / that all the Jews should void out of
England for their mysbyleue / and also for their falls usury that they did
unto christian men. And for to spedde and make an end of this thing / all the
common alte of England yaue unto the king the.xv. penny of all their goods
meuable / and so were the Jews driven out of England. And tho went the
Jews in to France. And there they dwelled / thorugh leave of king Phylyp that
tho. was king of France.

How king Edward was seized in all the land of Scotlonde through co^sente
and grant of all the lords of Scotlonde^
IT was not long after that Alexandre king of Scotlonde was deed / and Dauyd
the earl of Huntyngdon that was the kings brother of Scotlonde axed and
claymed the kingdom of Scotlond after his brother was deed for cause yt he was
ryghtfull heir / But many great lords said nay. Wherefore great debate arose
between them and there fre^des for asmoche as they would not consent to his
coronacyon / and the mean time the foresaid Dauyd deyed / and so it befell that
ye said Dauyd had three daughters yt worthyly were married / the first daughter
was married to Bayloll / the second to Brus / and the third to Hastynges. The
foresaid Bayloll and Brus challenged ye land of Scotlonde / and great debate
and stryf arose between them by cause each of them would have be kynge^ And
when the lords of Scotlonde saw the debate between them / came to king
Edward of England. and seized him in all the land of Scotlond as chyef lord.
and wha^ the king was seized of ye foresaid lords ye foresaid Baylol Brus and
Hastinges came to the kings court axyd of the king which of them should be
king of Scotlonde And king Edward ye full gentle and true / let inquire by
the Chronicles of Scotlonde / and of the gretest lords of Scotlonde / which of
them was of the eldest blood. And it was found that Baylol / was the eldest.
And that ye king of Scotlond should hold of the king of England / and do him
france and homage. And after this was done Baylol went in to Scotlo^de / and
there was crowyed king of Scotlonde. And ye same time was upon the sea great
war between the Englysshemen and the Normans But upon a time the Normans
arrived all at Dover. and there they martred an holy man that was called Thomas
of Dover / And afterward were the Norma^s slain. that there escaped not one
of the^ And so afterward king Edward should let the duchye of Gascoyne
through king phylyp of France through his false casting of the Dousepers of the
land / wherefore sir Edmond that was king Edwardes brother yaue up his damage
unto the king of France. And in the time the clerks of England granted to
king Edward half ^eale of holy church goods in helping to recover his
land again in gascoyne. And the king sent thither a noble company of his
bachelors. And himself would have gone to Portelmouth / but he was let thrughe
one maddok of walys yt had seized the castle of Swandon in to his hand and
for that cause the king turned to walys at Cristmasse / and by cause that the
noble lords of England yt were sent in to Gascoyne had no comforth of there
lord the king they were take of sir Charlys of France / yt is to say / sir
John^ of brytayne / sir Robert Tiptot / sir Raufe Tanny / sir Hugh Bardolfe /
and sir Adam of Cretynge / And yet at the assensyon was Maddok take in walys
and a another that was called Morgan And they were sent to the tour of London
and there they were byheded.

How Sire Johan Baylol king of Scotlonde with said his homage.
ANd when sire John^ Baylol king of Scotlonde understand ye king Edward was
werred in Gascoyne / to whom ye reame of Scotlond was delyuerd / Falsely tho
against his oath with said his homage through procuring of his folk and sent
unto ye court of Rome through a falls suggestyon to be assoylled of that oath yt
he swore unto the king of England and so he was by letter enbulled. Tho chose
they of Scotlonde dousepers / for to brnyge Edward of his right. And in ye time
came two Cardynalles from ye cource of Rome fro the pope Celestme / to trete of
acorde between ye king of England. and as tho cardinals spoke of accord.
Tha^ as turbeluyll was taken at Lions and made homage to the ward of Paris and
put his sons in hostage / and thought to go in to England aspye the country /
and tell them when he came to England that he had broken the kings prison of
France by right and said that he would do yt all Englysshmen and walshemen
should about the king for to bring to the end he swore / and upon this
covenant deeds were made between them / and that he should have by year a
thousand pou^des worth of land. to byrnge this thing to an end. This false
traitor took his leave / and went thens and came in to England unto the king
and said. that he was broke out of prison and yt he had put him in such
peril for his love wherefore the king cowde him much thank and full glad
was of his coming. And the false traytoure fro that day / aspyed all the
doing of the king and also his counselle / for the king loved him full well
and with him full preuy But clerk of England / that was in the kings hows of
France: herd of this treason / and of the falsnesse / and wrote to another
clerk / that tho was dwelling with Edward king of England. all how Thomas
Turbeluyll had done his false c^niectynge / and all the counselle of England
was write for to have send unto the king of France. And thoruhhe the
forsayde letter that the clerk had sent fro France it was found upon.
wherefore he was led to London and hangyd and draw there for his treason. And
his two sons that he had put in France for hostage. were then beheeded.

Of the Conquest of Berwyke.
SO when the two Cardynalles were gone again in to France for to trete of
the peace of cambroy the king sent thither of his earls and barons. This is to
say sir Edmonde his brother earl of Lancastre and of Lecetre / sir Henry Lacy
earl of Nychol / and Wyllyam Vessy Baron / and of other baronettes.

Edward took his vyage to Scotlonde / for to werre upon John^ Baylol king of
Scotlonde. And sir Robert Roos of Berwyk sledde fro ye Englysshmen / and went
to the Scotts. And king Edward went him toward Berwyk / and besegyd the

two of King Edwardes ships / and said in dyspyte and reprey^ of him (wenyth
king Edward with his long shankys / to have get Berewyk all our vnthankes
gas pykes him / and when he was done gas dykes him) when king Edward this
scorn / anon thorugh his myghtenesse / he passed over the dyches and
assaylled the town / and came to the yates / and gate and conquered the town
/ and thrughe his gracyous power slew.xxv. thousand and.vii. hundred scotts.
and King Edward lost no man of renoune saufe sir Richard of Cornewayle. and
him killed a Flemynge out of the red halle with a quarrel as the foresaid
Richard did of his helm. And commanded them for to yield them / and put
them in the kings grace. And ye Scotts would not wherefore that halle was
brent and cast down. And all tho that were therein were burnt and king
Edward lost no moo men at that vyage of simple estate but.xxvii.
Englysshemen. And the wardeyn of the castle yaue up the keys of ye castle
without any assawte And there was taken sire Wyllyam Douglas Symonde Frysell
and the earl patryk yielded them to the peace. But Ingham of Humbresmylle and
Robert the Brus that were with king Edward forsook king Edward and held

let kynhe Edward close in Berwyk with walls and with dyches / and after
Robert Rous went to Tyndale / and set wuyerbrydge a fire and Exham / and
Lamerstok and slew and robbyd the folk of the country. And after that he
went fro thens to Dunbarre. And the first wenesdaye of March the king sent
the earl of Garenne. sir Hugh Percy and sire Hugh Spenser with a fair company
for to besege the castle. But one that was called sire Richard Sywarde a
traytoure and a falls man ymagyned for to begyle the Englysshme^ / and sent to
the Englysshmen them for to deseeyue / and said / That he would yield to them

castle. and sir Richard sywarde saw him come yt was master of the counseyll
and keeper of the castle and said unto the Englyssgmen O said he. now I see a
fair company and well apparelled I will goo ayenste them / and with them to

ye treson^ And said to him O traitor take and prove your falsnesse shall not
auaylle you. And Hughe Spenser commanded anon to bind him. And all in have
went against there enmyes / and slew of Scotts.xxii. thousand. For the Scotts
had that time no man with them of honor saufe Patryke Graham that manly

wrenches un ware. Erly in a morning in an evil tymynge went ye fro Du^bare.
As tho that ware within the castle saw the scomfyture they yielded up the

king Edward. And so there were take in that castle three earls.vii. barons /
and.xxxviii. knights and xi. clerks / and.vii. Pycardys and all were
presentyd to king Edward And he sent the^ to the tower of London to be kept.

How king Edward of his great grace delivered again the Scotts out of
prison that were cheyftayns of that land and they drew them to the
Frensshemen through counseyll of Wyllyam waleys.
AS king Edward had made tho an end of ye werre. and taken the chey^^eyns of
Scotlonde. tho came sir Johan Baylol and yielded him unto king Edward and put
him in his grace and he was led to London and when king Edward was come
thither they were brough before him / And the king axed how they would make
amends of the trespaas and loss that they had done to him and they put them
in his mercy. Lordynges said the king I will not of your lands ne your
goods / but I will that ye make to me an oath upon goddys body to be true to
me and never after this time against me bear armies* And all they consentyd to
the kings will and swore upon goddys body. That is to say sir John^ of Common.
the earl of Scra^hron / the earl of Carryk / and also four bishops undertook
for all the clergy and so the king delivered the^ / and yaue them sauf
conduyce to go in to there own land. And it was not long afterward that they
ne arise against king Edward / for cause that they wist well that king
Edwardes folk was take / in Gascoyne / as before is said But sir John^ Bayloll
king of Scotlonde wyste well. that his land should have sorrow and shame /
for their falsnesse^ And in have went him over the sea to his own lands and
there he held him and came never again wherefore the Scotts chose unto their
king wyllyam waleys / a rybaude and an harlot comen up of naught / and much
harm did to Englysshmen and king Edward thought how he might have
delyueraunce of his people that were take in Gascoyne. And i^ have went him
over the sea in to Flaunders for to werre upon the king of France. And the
earl of Flaunders received him with much honor and grayntyd him all his
londys at his own will. And when the king of France herd tell the king of
England was aryued in Flaundres and came with a great power him for to
dystroye. He prayed him of trewes for two year / so that the English
merchants and also French might saufly go and come in both sides. The king
Edward granted ^^. so that he must have his men out of prison that were in
Gascoyne and the king of France anon granted and so they were delyuerd. And
in ye same time the Scotts sent by ye bishop of saint andrews in to France
to the king and to sir Charles his brother. ye sir Charles should come with
his power and they of Scotlo^de would come with their power / and so they
should go in to England / that loud to dystroye from Scotlonde unto they came
to ^ente. and the Scotts trustyd much upon the Fre^sshmen but of ye thing
they had no manner grant and nevertheless ye Scotts beg to rob and kylle in
Northu^berlond / and did much harm.

How wyllyam waleys let reyse ye land of Scotlonde as cheyf lord. And sir
Hugh of Cressynham and of the battle of Fonkyrke.
AS tidings was come to king Edward that wyllyam walys had ordained such a
strong power. And also that all Scotlonde to him was attendaunt and ready for
to slay Englysshmen and to dystroye the land he was sore anoyed / and sent
anon by letter to therle of Garrenne / to sir Henry Percy / and to wyllyam
Latomer / and to sir Hughe of Cressynham his tresoroer. that they should take
power / and go in to Northumberlonde. and so forth in to Scotlo^de. For to
keep the countres and when wyllyam waleys herd of their coming. He began to
flee and the Englysshmen him followed and dr^ue him till he came to Stryuelyn and
there he held him in the castle. And the walsshmen every day them escryed
and menacyed / and did all the dyspyte that they might so that Englysshmen
upon a time in a morning went out fro the castle / the mou^tenaunce of.x.
miles / and passed over a bridge and william waleys came with a strong power /
and drove them abak / for the Englysshmen had against him no power tho but
fled. and they that might take the bridge escaped. but sir hughe the kings
tresorer there was slain / and many other also / wherefore was made much
sorrow. Tho had king Edward sped all his matters in Flau^dres / and was come
again in to England / and in haste took his way in to Scotlonde / and came
theder at the Ascencyon tide. And all that he found he set a fire and burnt
/ But the poor people of Scotlonde came to him wonder thyck and prayed him for
goddys love / that he would on them have Mercy and pity tho the king commanded
yt no man should do them harm yt were yolden to him / ne to no man of order
ne to no house of relygyon / ne no manner church. but let espy all that he
might where yt he might find any of his enmyes tho came a spy unto the king
and told where that ye Scotts were assembled to abide bataylle. And on saint
Mary Mawdelyns day / ye king came to Fonkyrk and yaue bataylle to the Scotts
and at that bataylle were slain.xxx. thousand Scotts / and of
Englysshemen.xviii. and no mo. Of the which was a worthy knight slain yt was
a knight hospytelere that was called Frery bryan Iay. For when Wyllyam waleys
fled from the battle that same Frery bryan him pursewed fyersly / and as his
horse ran it stert in a mire of a marys up to the belly And Wyllyam waleys
turned tho again and there slew the forsayde bryan. and that was much harm.
And that while king Edward went thorugh Scotlonde / for to enquere if he
might find any of his enmyes. And in that land he dwelled / as long as him
lyked / And there was no enmye that durst him abide. And soon after King
Edward went to Southampton for he would not abide / in Scotlonde in winter
season / for esement of his people And when he came to London / he let amend
many mysdedys that were done against his peace and laws he being in Flaundres.

Of ye last marriage of king Edward / and how he went ye third time in to

within the first year he had enfamyned the land / so that he left not one

that well were vytaylled and stored for.vii. year.

How the castle of Estrefelyn was be seged and won.
King Edward came to ye castle of Estreuelyn with a huge power and beseged
the castle / but it little auaylled. for he myhht do the Scoctes no harm /
for the castle was so strong and well kept. and king Edward said ye and
bethought him upon a queyntesy^ and let make anon two payr of high galowes

all his male talent and there were all the great lords of Sfotlonde swore to
king Edward / that they should come to London to every parliament and shode

thereto Justices / and in this manner he recovered tresoure without nombre: And
his purpose was for to have goon in to the holy land / to have werred upon

Edward prysoned his own sone Edward / by cause that Walter of Lanton bishop
of Chestre / that was the kings tresorer had complained on him and said the
foresaid Edward thrughe counsel and entysynge of one Ganasto^ asquyre of
Gascoyne had broke the parkes of the foresaid bishop. And this Peers counselyd
and ladde the same Edward and for that cause the king e^yled his sone out of

Of Merlyns prophecyes that were declared of king Edward. That was king
Henrys sone.
OF this king Edward prophecyce Merlyn / and called him a dragon the second of
the.vi. kings that should regne in England and said / that he should be
meddled with mercy / and also with strenthe and fyernesse. That should keep
England from cold and hete. And that he should opene his mouth toward
walys and that he should set his foot in wyk and that he should close with
walwes / that should do much harm to his sede. And he said sothe. For the
good king Edward was meddled with mercy and with fyernesse / with mercy
against his enmyes of walys / and after of Scotlonde with fyernesse / when he
put them to death for there falsnesse / and traytourily as they had deserved.
And well keped he England from cold and heet / sithe he kept it from all
manner of enmyes that ran upon him to do him any wrong. And well he
opened his mouth to ward walys / and made it quake thrughe hydour of his
mouth / when he conqueryd it thruoghe dynte of sword. For the prince Lewelyn
and Dauyd his brother. Ris and Morgan. were put to death thrughe their
falsnesse and their folly / And he set his foot in to wyk / and conquered
Berwyk at the which conquest were slain.xxv. thousand and.vii. hundred / out
take such as were burnt in the red halle. And the walls yt he let make
shall be noyous / unto his sede. As men shall here after inthe life of sire
Edward of Carnaruan his sone. And yet said Merlyn that he should make ryuers
ren in blood and with brain. and ye semyd well in his wars there as he had
ye maystry And yet Merlyn said yt there should come a people out of ye nortwest
during the regne of the foresaid dragon yt should be ladde by an ill greyhou^de
/ yt should the dragon crown king. that afterward should fle over ye see for
dread of the dragon without coming again. and that was proved by sir John^
Baylol ye king Edward made to be king of Scotlonde. ye falsely aroyse against
him* and after he fled to his own lands of France / and never he came again
in to Scotlond for dread of king Edward: And yet said Merly: that people yt
should led ye said greyhou^d should be faderles unto a certain time soth he
said. For the people of Scotlonde greatly were dysesyd after sir Johan baylol was
fled. And merlyn said the sone should become in his time as red as any blood
in tokenynge of great mortalyte of people And that was know well wha^ the
Scotts were slain. And sith said Merlyn / ye same dragon should nouryshe a
Fox. that should meue great werre against him / yt should not in his time be
ended / and that seemed well by Robert the Brus. that king Edward nourysshed
in his chamber that sythen stale a way and meued grett werre against him /
which werre was not ended in his time And yet said merlyn that the dragon
should deye in ye march of an other land / and that his land should be long
without a good keeper. And that men should were for his death from the isle of
Shephey unto the isle of Mercyll / wherefore alas shall be there song among the
common people faderles in the land wastyd And that prophecy was know over all
full well. For the good King Edward deyed at Burgh up sandys / that is upon
the March of Scotlonde the englyssmen were dysc^mferced and sorowed in
Northumberlonde / For cause that king Edwardes sone sete by the Scotts no
force. for the riot of Peers of Ganaston / wherefore alas was the song through
out all England / for defawte of their good wardeyne from ye isle of Shephey
unto the isle of Mercyll / the people made much sorrow for good king Edwardes
/ death. For they wend that good king Edward should have gone in to the holy
land / For that was holy his purpoos. Upon whoos soul god for his high and
Inginyte grace have mercy

him that he said / he was lord of all the world. and many things he did with
his might and power^ the which failed wretchedly in the end / He yaue an

fat bysshopryches he deuydyd and he ordained many things aye^ste the
pluralytae of benefyces / and many herytykes he dampened / but whether he was
saved or not our lord would not show to those be louyd very well. Henry

war. and he coueyted to have peace by land and water. He was a glorious man

folly / that they had that myschaunce. For they passed the water of Swale. And
the Scotts set a fire the sta^kes of hey and the smote there of was so huge /
that ye Englysshmen might not se ye Scotts. And wha^ the englisshmen were gone
over the water tho came ye Scotts with their wynge in manner of a shield / and
came to ward the Englyssme^ in array. And the Englysshemen fled. For ^neth
they had any men of armies. For the king had them almoost lost at the syege
of Berwyk / and the Scotts hobylers went between the bridge and the
Englysshmen / And when the great host them met / the englysshemen fled between
the hobylers and the great host. And the Englysshmen almoost were there slain
/ and he that might go over the water were saved / But many were drowned. Alas
for there were slain / many men of relygyon / seculers priests and clerks /
with much sorrow tharchebysshop escaped. and therefore the Scotts called that
battle the white battle.

How king Edward did all manner thing that sir Hugh Spenser wolde^
NOw as king Edward herd this tidings he remeued his sege from Berwyk and
came again into England. But Sir Hugh Spenser that was the kings Chamberlayne.
kept so the kings chamber. that no man might speak with the king. But he had
made with him a fret for to do all his need. and that over mesure. And this
Hugh bare him so stowte that all men had of him scorn and dyspyte. and the
king himself would not be governed / ne ruled by no manner of man but only by
his fader and by him. And if any knight of england had wodes maneyrs or
lands that they would coueyte anon the King must give it them or else the
man that ought it. should be falsely endyted of forfeyt or felony. And through
such doing they dysheryted many a bachelere / and so much land he gate that
it was great wonder and when the lords of enlonde saw the great couetyse and
falsnesse of sir Hugh Spenser the fader and of sir Hugh the sone / they come to
the gentle earl of lancastre / and axyd him of counseyll of the dysese. that
was in the reame / though sir Hugh Spenser and his sone. and in have by one
assente they made pryue assemble. at shirburne^ Elmede and they made there an
oath for to break and dystouble ye doing between the king and sir Hugh
Spenser and his sone upon their power. And they went in to the march of walys.
and dystroyed the land of the foresaid sir hughes.

How sir hugh Spenser and his fader were exyled out of Englonde^
SO when king Edward saw ye great harm and dystruccyo^ that tho Barons of
England did unto sire hugh Spensers land. and to his sone in every place
that they came upon the king tho through his counseyl ill exyled sir Monbraye.
sir Roger Clyfforde and sir Gosselyn Dauyll. and many other lords yt were to
them consent / wherefore the barons did tho more harm than they did before
/ and wha^ the king saw that ye barons would not sesse of their cruelte / the
king was sore adradde lest they would dystroy him and his reame for his
mayntenau^ce / but if he assented to them. And so he sent for the^ by his
letters that they should come to London to his parliament at a certain day as
in his letters were contained and they came with three bataylles / well Armyd at
al points. and every batayl had cotarmours of great clothe. And thereof the
right quarter was yelowe. with white bendes / wherefore ye parlemente was called
the parliament of the white bend. And in ye company was sir Hunfrey de bohoune
earl of Herford and sire Roger Clyfforde. sir Johan Monbray. sir Glosselyn
Dauyll. sir Roger Mortymer uncle of sir Roger mortymer of wygmore. sir Henry of
Trays sir John^ Gyffarde and sire Barthylmewe of Badelessemore that was ye
kings steward. yt the king had sent to Shyrborne in Elmede to ye earl of
Lancaster / and to all yt with him were for to trete of accord / ye him alyed
to the barons / and came with that company. and sur Roger Dammory and sir Hugh
dandale yt had spousyd the kings neces sister. and sir Gylbert of clare earl
of Gloucetre yt was slain in Scotlonde as before is said. And tho two lords
had tho two parties of the erldom of Gloucerte. and sur Hugh Spenser had third
party in his wives half / the third sister and tho two lords went to the
barons with all their power against sir Hugh their brother in law. And so there
came with them sir Robert Clyfforde sir Johan Mo^bray. sir Goselyn Dauyll. sir
Roger Mortymer of werk. sir Roger Mortymer of wykmore his neuewe. sir Henry
Trays sire Ioha^ Gyffarde. sir Barthylmewe of Bardesmore. with all their
company. and many other / that to them were consent. all the great lords came
unto westmestre to ye kings parlemente. And so they spoke and did. that both
sir Hughe Spe^ser the fader and also the sone / were out lauwed of england for
evermore And so sire Hugh the fader went unto Dover and made much sorrow /
and fell down upon the ground by the sea bank. a cross with his arms / and
sore weeping said Now fair England and good England to almighty god I the
betake And thryes kyssed the ground and wenyd never to have come ayen^ And
weeping cursyd ye time that ever he begat sir Hugh his sone. and said for him
he had lost all England. And tho in presence of the^ all that were about him
yaue him his cursee and went over see to his lands But Hugh the sone would not
go out of England / but held him in the sea. and his company robbyd.ii.
dromedores beside Sandwyth and took and bare a way all the godoes that was in
them to the value of.lx.M.li.

How the King exyled earl Thomas of Lancastre and all that held with him and
how the Mortymer came and yielded him to the king / and of all the lords.
IT was not long after that the king made sir Hugh Spenser the fader / and
sir Hugh the sone / come again in to England ayenste the lords will of the
reame. And soon after the king with a strong power came and beseged the
castle of Ledys. and in the castle was ye laby of Bladelesmore for cause that
she would not grant that castle to the queen Isabel king Edwardes wife but
the pryncypall cause was / for sir Berthylmewe was against ye king / and held
with the lords of England. and nevertheless the king by help and socoure of
men of London / and also of help of Southeren men gate the castle maugre of
them all yt were with in / and took with them all that they might find. And
when the barons of England herd these tidings / sir Roger Mortymer and many
other lords took the town of Brugge wroth with strenth. wherefore the king was
wonder wroth / and let outlawe Thomas of Lancastre / and Vmfroy de Bohoune
earl of Herforde and all tho that were assenting to the same quarrel. And the
king assembled an huge host and came against the lords of England wherefore the
Mortymers put them in the kings grace. And anon they were sent to the toure
of London and there kept in prison. And wha^ the barons herd this thing they
came to poutfert there that ye earl Thomas soiourned and told him how that
Mortymers both had yield them to the king. and put them in his grace.

Of the syege of Tykhyll.
SO when Thomas Earl of Lancastre herd this he was wonder wroth and all that
were of there company and greatly they were dyscomfyted / and ordained there
power together. and besyeged the castle of Tykhyll / But tho that were with in
manly defended them / that the barnos might not get the castle. and when the
king herd yt his castle was beseged he swore by god and by his names. that
the lege should be remeued. and assembled an huge power of people / and went
theder ward to rescowe the castle. and his power encresyd fro day to day.
when the earl of Lancastre and the earl of Herforde and the barons of there
company herd of this thing they assembled all their power and went them to
Burton upon trent and kept the bridge that the king should not pass over* but
it befell so on the tenthe day of March in the year of grace.M.CCC.xxi. the
king and the Spensers sir Aymer Valaunce earl of Penbroke / and Johan earl of
Araundell and their power went over the water and dyscomfyted therle Thomas
and his company^ And they fled to the castle of Tetbury and from thens they
went to Pountfret. And in that ^yage deyed sir Roger Daumore in thabbay of
Thebury. And in that same time the earl thomas had a traitor with hyme yt was
called Robert Holonde knight. that the earl had brought up of naught / and had
nourysshed him i^ his butrye. and had give him a thousa^de mark of land by
year. And so much the earl louyd him that he might do in the earls court all
that him lyked both among them high and low / and so craftly the theyf bare
him ayenste his lord / that he trustyd more upon him than any man on live. and
the earl had ordained by his letters for to goo in to the erledome of Lancastre
/ to make men arise to keep him in that vyage / That is to say.v. hundred men
of armies. But the false traitor came not there: no manner men for to warn ne
for to make arayse to help his lord. And when that the false traitor herd
tell yt his lord was dycomfyted at Burton upon Trent. as a falls traitor theyf.
stele a way and robbyd in Raue^sdele his lords men that came fro the
scomfyture. And took of them horse and harneys / and all that they had and slew
of them all that they might take / and came and yeldyd him to the king. when
the good earl Thomas wyste that he was so bytrayed. He was so abashed / and
said to himself / O almighty good how might Robert Holonde find in his
herteme to betray / sithe that I louyd him so much O god well may now a man
se by him yt no man may dysceyue a another rathar than he yt he trustyth most
upon. He has full evil yielded me my goodness and the worship yt I have to him
done and through my kyndnesse have him auau^cyd and made him high where yt he
was low. And he makyth me go from high unto low / but yet shall he deye an
evil death.

Of the scomfyture of Brurbrygge.
THe good Earl Thomas of Lancaste. Humfroy de Bohoune ele of Herford and the
barons yt with them were took counsel between them at ye frre prechers in
Pou^tfret. tho thought Thomas upon the traitor Roberte Holonde. And said in
repreyf / Alas Robert Holonde has me betrayed / and is the red of some evil
shred. And by the common assent they should goo to the castle of Dunstanbrughe
/ the which perteyned to therldome of Lancastre / and yt they should abide
there till that the king had for give them his male talente. But when the good
earl Thomas this herd / he answered in this manner and said. Lords said he /
if we go to wade the North / the Northen men woll say that we go to ward ye
scotts / so we shall be holden traitors / for cause of dystau^ce that is
between king Edward and Robert ye Brus that made him king of Scotlonde. And
therefore I say as touching my self that I will not go no ferder into the North
/ than to mine own castle at Pou^tfret. And when sire Roger Clyfford herd
this he arose up anon in wrath. and draw his sword on hye / and swore by
god almighty and by his holy names / but if yt he would go with them / he
should him slay there. the noble and gentle earl Thomas of Lancastre was sore
a ferde and said. Fair* syres I will go with you whether some ever ye me bydde.
Tho went they together in to the North / and with them they had.vii.C. men of
armies came to Burbryg. And when sir Andrew of Herkela that was in the north
country through ordinance of the king. For to keep ye country of Scotlonde /
herd tell. how yt Thomas of Lancastre was scomfyted and his company at Burton
upon trent / he ordened him a strong power / and sir symonde ward also that
was the shyref of york / and met the barons at burburgge. and anon they
brake the bridge that was made of tree And when sir Thomas of Lancastre. herd
ye sir Andrewe of Herkela had brought with him such a power he was sore
adradde. and sent for sir Andrewe of herkela / with him spoke. and said to
him in this manner sir Andrewe said he. ye may well understood that our lord
ye king. is ladde and mysgouerned by much falls counsel through sir Hugh Spenser
the fader and sir Hughe is sone: sir Johan earl of Aru^del / and through master
Robert Baldok a falls pylled clerk. yt now is in the kings court dwelling
wherefore I pray you that ye will come with us with all your power that ye
have ordained / and help to dystroie the venym of England. and ye traitors
that been therein. and we will give unto you all the best part of five Erldoms /
that we have and hold. and we will make unto you an oath. that we will never
do thing without your counsel / and so ye shall be left as well with as ever
was Robert Holande Tho answered sir Andrew of Herkela and said sir Thomas yt
would not I do ne consent thereto for no manner thing without the will and
commandment of lord the king / for them should I be holden a traitor for
evermore. And when that ye noble earl Thomas of Lancaster saw that he would
not consent to him for no manner thing sir Andrew he said will ye not consent to
dystroy the venym of the reame as we be consent at one word sir Andrewe I tell
the that are this year begoo^ / that ye shall* be take and hold for a
traitor. and more than any of you hold us now / and in worse death ye shall
deye than ever did any knight of England. And understand well / that ye did
never thing That sorer ye shall you repent. And now go and do what you good
lykyth / and I will put me in to the mercy of god. And so went the false
traitor tyrau^ce a falls forsworn man For through the noble earl Thomas of
Lancastre he received the armies of Chyualrye / and thrughe him he was made a
knight. Tho might men se archers draw them in that one side and in that other
and knights also. And fought tho together wonder sore. And also among all
other Humfroy de Boughon Earl of Herforde a worthy knight of renoune through out
all crystendom stood a fought with his enmyes upon ye bridge. and as the noble
lord stood and fought upon the bridge a theyf rybaude sculkyd under the bridge
/ and fyersly with a spear. smote the noble knight in to ye fu^dement / so yt
his bowellys came out about his fete there. Alas for sorrow and pity. For there
was slain the flower of solace and of comforth / and also of curteysye. And
Sir Roger Clyfforde a noble and a worthy knight stood ever and fought / and
well and worthyly him defended as a noble baron. But at the last he was sore
woundyd in his heed / And sir Wyllyam of Sullaynde. and sir Roger of Benfeelde
were slain at that battle. when sir Andrewe of Herkela saw that sir thomas
me^ of Lancaster / lassed and slakyd. anon he and his company came unto the
gentle knight sir Thomas and laid unto him in an high voice yield the
traitor yield the. The gentle earl Thomas of Lancastre answered then and
said Nay lords traitors we ben none and to you we will never us yield while
that our lives last But lever we had to be slain in our thruth than yield us
unto you. And sire Andrewe ^en gardyd upon sir Thomas and his company /
yellynge and cryenge like a wode wulf yield you traitors taken yield you / and
said with an high voys Beware syres yt none of you be so hardy upon life and
lymme to mys do Thomas body of Lancaster / And with that word the good earl
Thomas yede into the castle / and said knelynge upon his knees and turned his
vysage to ward the cross and said almighty god to the I yield / and holy I
put me unto thy mercy. and with that the vylaynes and rybaudes lept about him
on every side as tyrau^tes and wood tormentours and dyspoyled him of his
armoure and clothed him in a ^obe of ray^ that was of his squyres lyuetay ^ and
forth ladde him unto york by water. Tho might men see much sorrow and care
For the gentyl knights sledde on every side and ye rybaudes and the vyllayns
egerly. them dyscryed / and cried on high yield traitors yield you. And when
they were yelden they were robbyd and bounden as theuys. Alas the shame and
dyspyte that the gentle orde of knyghthode had there at that battle. And the
land was tho without law For holy church had tho no more creuereence than it
had be a burdell house / And in that batyall was the fader against the sone ^ and
the uncle against the neuewe. For so much unkindness / was never seen before
in England / as that time among folks of one nacyon. For one kynred had no
more pity of that other. than an hungry wulf has of a sheep / And it was no
wonder. For the great lords of England were not all of one nacyon / But were
medlyd with other naco^ns / That is for to say some / Brytons / some Saxons /
some Danys / some Pehypes / some Frenssemen / some Normans / some Spanyerdes /
some Romans / some Henaude some Flemynges and other diverse nacyons the which
nacyons accordyd not to the kind blood of England. And if so great lords
had be oonly weddyd to English people. Then should peace have been and rest
among them without any envy. And at that battle was Roger Clyfforde take.
sir John^ Mombray sir wyllyam Tuchy^ Sir wyllyam fitz wyllyam / and many other
worthy knights there take at that battle and Sir Hugh Dandell net day
after was taken and put in to prison / and should have be done to death if he
had not spousyd the kings nece / that was Earl Gylbertes sister of
Gloucestre ^ and anon after was sir Berthylmewe of Badelesmore taken at Stow
park a maneyr of the bishop of Lyncoln that was his neuewe and many other
barons and baronetters. wherefore was made much sorrow.

How Thomas of Lancastre was heedyd at Pountfret / and.v. barons hangyd and
drawn there
ANd now I shall tell you of the noble earl Thomas of Lancastre. wha he was
take and brought to york / many of the cite were full glade and upon him cried
with an hight voys O sir traitor ye be welcome. blessed be god for now ye
shall have the reward / that long ye have deserved. And cast upon him many
snow balls / and many other repreues they did him. But the gentle earl all
suffered / and said another o word nor other. And at the same time ye king herd
of this sco^fyture / and was full glad and Joyous / and in great have came to
Pou^tfret. And sir Hugh Spenser. and sir Hugh his sone / and sir John^ earl of
Arundell and sir Edmonde of wodestoke ye kings brother earl of Kent. and sir
Aymer of valaunce earl of Penbroke and master Robert Baldoke. a falls pyllyd
clerk / that was pryue / and dwelled in the kings court / and all came theder
with the king. And the king entryd in to the castle and Sir Andrewe of Herkela
a falls tyraunte through the kings commandment. took with him the gentle
Earl. Thomas to Pountfret and there he was prysoned in his own castle that he
had new made that stood ayenste the abbaye of king Edward. And sir Hugh
Spenser the fader and the sone cast and thought how and in what manner the good
earl Thomas of Lancastre should be deed / without Judgment of his perys.
wherefore it was ordained through the kings Iusticus that the king should put
upon him points of treason. And so it befell that he was led to bar before
the kings Justices bare heed as a theyf / in a fair halle in his own castle
yt he had made there in many a fair feste. both to rich and to poor. And
these where is Justices sir Hugh Spe^ser the fader. and Aymer of Balaunce earl
of Pe^broke / sir Edmonde of wodstok earl of Kent / sir Johan of Brytayne earl
of Rychemonde / and sir Robert Malemethrop Justice and sire Roberte him a
couplyd in this manner. Thomas court excludes you of all manner answer Thomas
our lord the king / puttyth upon you* that ye have in his land ryden with
baner dysplayed against his peace. as a traitor. And with ye word the gentle
earl Thomas with an high voice said / Nay lords forsooth and by saint Thomas I
was never traytoure The Justice said again tho. Thomas our lord the king
puts upon you that ye have robbyd his folk / and murdered his people as a
theyf. Thomas also the king puttythe upon you that he dysco^fyted you and our
people with his folk / in his own reame / wherefore. ye went and fled to
the wood as an outlaw* and thomas as a traytoure ye shall be hangyd by reason.
but ye king has foryeuen you that Judgment / for love of queen Isabell. And
Thomas reason would yt ye should be hangyd / but ye king has foryue you that
Judgment for by cause and love of your lygnage. But for asmoche. Thomas as ye
were taken fleenge / and as an outlawe. the king: woll that your heed shall
be smyten of / Anon have him out of prees and bring him to his Judgment.
When the ge^tyll knight Thomas had herd all these words / with an high voice
he cried sore weeping and said alas saint Thomas fair fader. Alas shall I be
deed thus Grant me now blessydful* god answer. But all auayled him no thing
For the cursyd Gascoyns put him hither and thither / and on him cried with an
high voys. O king Arthur most terryble and dredefull / well known and
showed now is thyn open traitor. And an evil death shall thou right anon
deye. Haste thou not right well deserved it. And then these cruel folk
set upon the good knyhht Thomas for very scorn an old chaplet that was all
to rent / yt was not worth an half penny. And after that they set him upon a
white palfroy full unseemly / and also all bare / with an old brydell. And
with an horrible noise they drove him out of the castle to ward his death /
and they cast upon him many balls of snow in dyspyte. And as the traitors
lad him out of the castle tho said he these pyteous words. And his hondes
held up on high to ward heaven Now the king of heaven give us mercy for the
erthly king has us forsaken and a friar precher went with him out of the
castle till he came to the place that he ends his life. unto whom he shroue
him all his life. And the gentle earl held the friar wonder fast by the
clothes and said to him Fair fader abide with us till yt I be deed. for my
flesh quakyth for dread of death. And the sothe for to say / The gentle earl
set him upon his knees / and turned him to ward the eest: but a rybaude that
was called Hygone of mos^^on set hand upon the gentle Earl and said in
dyspyte of him Sir traitor torn the toward the Scotts / thy foul death to
receive / and turned to ward the Nosth. The noble earl Thomas answered tho
with a mylde voys and said now fair lords I shall do your will And with that
word ye friar went from him sore weeping. And anon a rybaude went to him /
and smote of his heed / the.xi. Kalendas of Auerell. In the year of
grace.M.CCC. and.xxi. Alas that ever such a gentle blood should be don to
death withouten cause and reason. And traytoursly the king was counseylled /
when he through the false counseyll of the Spenser suffered sir Thomas his uncles
sone to be put to such a death / and so he beheeded against all manner of reason
/ And great pity it was also / that such a noble king should be dysceyued and
mysgouerned through counsel of the false Spensers / the which tho he mayntened
thrughe loselry against his honor and also his proffyte. For after ward there
fell great vengaunce in England. for by cause of the forsayd^ Thomas death.
when the gentle earl of his life was passyd. ye pryour and the monkys of
Pounfret gate the body of sir Thomas of the king and buried it before the
high awter on the right side. That same day that this gentle knight was deed
/ were hangyd and drawn / for the same quarrel at Pou^tfret sir Wyllyam Tuchet.
Sir Wyllyam. Fitz Wyllyam. sir werreyn of Isell. Sir Henry Bradborn / and sir
Wyllyam Cheyne barons al / and John^ page esquyrer. and soon after at york
were drawn and hangyd sir Roger Clyfforde / sire Johan of Mambray barons. and
sir Goselyne Devil knight. And at Brystowe were drawn and hangyd / Sir Henry
of wemyngton / and sir Henry Moun^torde barons And at Gloucerre were drawn and
hangyd sir John^ Gaffarde and sir Wyllyam of Elmebrughe barons / and at London
were hangyd and drawn Sir henry Ties baron. And at wynchelse sir thomas
Clepepyr knight. And ferthermore to tell of this cruel occyon at wyndsore
was draw and hangyd sir Fraunc^s walde^ham baron / and at Caunterbury was
drawn and handyg sir Berthylmew Badelesmore and sir Berthylmew of Asshe
bourucham barons and at Cardyf in walys sir Wylyam Flemmynge baron.

How king Edward went into Scotlonde with an hundrde thousand me^ of armies
/ and might not speed.
SO when king Edward of England had brought the flower of cheua^* unto their
death. through counsel and con^ente of sir Hugh Spenser the fader / and sir
Hughe the sone he became as wood as any lion* and what so ever the Spensers
would have it was done So well the king louyd them yt they might do with him
all thing that them lyked wherefore the king gaaf unto sir Hughe Spenser the
fader ye erldom of wynchestre and unto sir Andrewe of Herkela the erldome of
Cardoyll^ in preiudyce and in harming of his crown. And king Edward tho
through counsel of the Spensers dysheryted all them that had be against him in
any quarrel with Thomas of L^castre. And many other were dysheryted also / by
cause that the Spensers coueyted for to have their lands. And so they had all
that they would desire with wrong / and against all reason. Tho made the king
Robert Baldok a fal^e pylled clerk Chaunceler of England. through counsel of
the forsayde Spensers. And he was a false rybaude / And a coueytouse. And so
they counseylled the king much / that the king let take to his own ward
all the gooddes of the lords that were put wrongfully to the death in to his
own hand. And as well they took the goods yt were within holy church / es
the goods yt were without / and let them be put in to his tresoury in London
/ and let them call his for feytes. And by there counsel ye king wrought
for ever more he dysheryted them that the gods ought / and through there
counsel let arer a talegge of all the goods of England / wherefore he was
the rychest king yt ever was in England. after wyllyam Bastard yt comquered
England. / And yet thrughe counsel of them him semyd yt he had not enough.
But made yet every town of England for to find a man of armies upon their
own costs / for to go and werre upon the Scotts yt were his enmyes /
wherefore the king went in to Scotlonde with an houndred thousand men of armies
at wytsontyde in the year of our lord Ihesu Crist.M.CCC.xxii. But the Scotts
went / and hyd them in mou^teyns and in wodes and carried the Englysshmen fro
day to day / that the king might for no manner thing find the^ in plain
field / wherefore many Englysshmen that had lytyl vytaylles deyed there for hungre
wonder fast an suddenly in going and coming and namely tho that had been
against Thomas of Lancastre and robbyd his men upon his lands. when king
Edward saw that vytaylles failed him / he was wonder sore dyscomfyted.
because also yt his men deyed. and for he might not speed of his enmyes. So at
the last he came again in to England / and anon after came James Douglas and
also Thomas Radulph with an huge hooste into England in to Northumberlonde /
and with them the Englysshmen that were driven out of England / and came and
robbed the country / and slew ye people / and also burnt the twone yt was
called Northallerton and many other twones to york. And when the king herd
this tidings he let so mane all manner men that might trauyllee. And so the
Englysshmen met the Scotts at ye abbay of Beyghelande the.xv. day after
Mygelmas. en the same year above said / and the Englysshmen were there
dysconfyted. And at that dyscomfyture was take sir Johan of Brytayne Earl of
Rychmonde that held the country and the erldome of Lancastre and after he
paid an huge raunsonne and was let goo. And after that he went in to France
and came never after again.

How sir Andrewe of Herkelay was take and put to death / that was Earl of
Cardoil.
THen at that time was sir Andrew of Herkela / ye new was made earl of Cardoil
/ for cause that he had taken the good earl Thomas of Lancastre. He had
ordained through the kings commandment of England. for to bring him all the
power yt he might for to help ayenste the Scotts as the abbaye of Beglonde.
And when ye falls traitor had gadred all the people that he might and should
have come to the king unto the abbaye of Beyghelande / ye falls traitor ladde
them by a another country thrughe Copelonde. And thrughe therldome of Lancastre
/ and went through ye country and robbed and slew the folk all yt he might.
And ferthermore the false traitor had take a great sum of gold and silver of
sir James Douglas for to be against the king of England. and to be helping and
holding with the Scotts / through whose treason the king of England was
scomfyted at Beyghelande or yt he came thither. wherefore the king was to ward
him wonder wroth. and let pryuely enquere by the country about how yt it
was. And some men enquered and aspeyed / so at the last the trough was found
and sought. And he atteynte and take as falls traitor / as ye good earl Thomas
of Lancastre him told of yt he was pute unto death at his ta^ynge at
Burbrugge. and to him said. Or ye that were done he should be take and hold a
traitor And so it was as the holy man said. wherefore the king sent pryuely to
sir Anthony of Lucy / a knight of the country of Cardoil that he should take
sir Andrew of Herkela and put him unto the death. And to bring this thing
unto the end. the king sent his Commyssion so that this same Andrewe was
take at Cardoill and ladde unto the bar in the manner of an earl worthyly
arrayed / and with aswerde gyrde about him / and hosyd and sporyd. Tho spoke
sir Anthoyn in this manner sir Andrewe said he the king puttyth upon the for
asmoche as thou have be orpyd i^ thy dedys / he did to the much honor / and
made the earl of Cardoil. and than as a traitor to thy lord laddest the
people of his countere that should have help him at the battle of Beyghel and
and thou laddest them away by the country of Copelande / and through the

so it was done all manner of thing in the last day of Octobre. in the year
of grace.M.iii.C.xxii. year. And the son turned in to blood as the people it

Of the miracles yt god wrought for saint Thomas of Lancastre / wherefore the
king let close in ye church doors of ye pryory of Pou^tfert / that no man
should come therein for to offer
ANd sone after that the good earl Thomas of Lancastre was martryd there was a
priest that long time had be blind / dremed in his sleep / that he should go
to ye hylle there the good Earl Thomas of Lancastre was done unto death / and he
should have his syghte again and so he dremed three nyghtes sewynge. and the
priest led him to the same hill and wha^ he came to ye place yt he was martryd
on deuowtly he made there his prayers / And prayed god and saint Thomas / that
he might have his sight again / And he was in his prayers he laid his right
ho^de upon the same that the good man was martryd on / and a drope of dry
blood and small sonde cleuyd on his hand / and there with stryketh his eyes.
And anon through the might of god and saint Thomas of Lancastre / he had his
sight again. And thankyd tho almighty god and saint Thomas. And when this
miracle was known among men / the people came thither on every side. and
knelyd and made their prayers at his tomb that is in the pryory of Pountfret
and prayed that holy martyr of socour and of help / and god herd there
prayer. Also there was a young child drowned in a well in the town of
Pountfret and was deed three day and three nyghtes. And men came and laid ye
deed child the said Thomas tomb the holy martyr / and the child arose from
death to life. as many a man it saw. And also much people were out of there
mind / and god sent them their mind again. thorough virtue of that holy man.
And god has give there also to cryppyls their going / and the crokyd their
ho^des and there feet / and two blind also their sight. and to many syke folk

was a rich man in Cou^dom in Gascoyne and such a malady he had that al his
right side rotyd and fell a way from him / that men might see his liver and his
heart and so he stanke / that uneath they might come nyghe him. wherefore his
friends were for him wonder sorry. But at the last as god would. they prayed to
saint Thomas of Lancastre / that he would pray almighty god for that prisoner
and behyght for to go to Pountfret for to do their pilgrimage / he thought
that the Martyr saint Thomas came to him. and anointed all his sike body / and
therewith the good man a woke and was all hole / and his flesh was restored

and his fre^des louyd god and saint Thomas evermore after. And this good man
came into England And took with him four fellows: and came to Pou^tfret to ye
holy martyr. and did their pilgrimage. and the good man that was syke came
thither all nakyd / saufe his preuye clothes. And when they had done. they
turned home again in to their own country. and told of the miracle where so
ever that they came. And also two men have been heelyd there of the mormale
through help of ye holy martyr / though that evil be hold in curable. And
when ye Spensers herd yt god did such miracles for this holy man they nolde
believe yt in no manner wyse^ / but said openly that it was great heresye /
such virtue of him to believe. and when sir Hugh Spenser the sone saw all this
doing / anon he sent his massager from Pountfret there that he dwelled to
king Edward yt tho was at Graven at scypton / for cause yt the king should
undo ye pilgrimage / And as the rybaude ye messager went to ward the king for
to do his message / he came by the hylle the^e the good martyr was done to
death. And in the same place he made his ordure / and when he had done. he

york / and tho he shed all his bowelles at his fu^dment. And wha^ sir Hugh
Spenser herd this tygynges / somdele he was adradde and thought for to undo
this pilgrimage if he might by any manner a way / and anon he went to the
king / and said that they should be in great sklaundre thrughe out all
crystendome / for the death of Thomas of Lancastre if yt he suffered ye people to
do there pilgrimage at Pou^tfret and so he counseled the king that he
commanded to shyt the church doors of Pountfret / in the wyche church ye
holy martyr was enteryd. and thus they did against all frau^chyses of holy
church so ye four year after might no pilgrim come to the holy body. and
because the monks suffered men to come and honor that holy body of saint
Thomas ye martyr. through counsel of sir Hughe Spenser the sone / and through
counsel of master Roberte Baldok the false pylled clerk. that was ye kings
chau^celes. the king consented yt they should be let to their wages / and
let make wardeyns over there own good long time / and through commandment
of the foresaid sir Hugh Spenser.xiiii. Gascoynes well armyd kept the hylle
there that the good man saint Thomas was don unto his death so that no pilgrim
might come by that way / Full well went he to have take crystis might and his
power and ye great boos of miracles / that he showed for his martyr saint

Baldok the false pylled clerk. through prayer of sir Hugh Spe^ser sone. was made
Chau^seler of England. And in ye same time was ye castle of walyngforde
holden against the king thrughe prisoners that weren within the castle for
saint Thomas love of Lancastre / wherefore the people of the country came and
took the castle of the prisoners wherefore sir John^ of Goldyngton knight and
sir Edmonde of Becche prisoners were taken and sent unto the king to Pountfrete
and there they were done in prison. and the foresaid Roger was sent unto york /
and there he was drawn and hangyd. And anon after sir Roger Mortymer of

of the tour. and they came and sowped with him / and wha^ they should take
there leave of him. and squyre yt was called Stephen* that was full preuy with
the foresaid Roger through his counsel. yaue them all such a drink that the
leest of them all slept two days and two nyghtes. and in the mean time he
escaped a way by water / by the thamys and went over the sea and held him in
France. wherefore the king was sore anoyed / and put the same Stephen out of
his Constabellary.

How the queen Isabell went in to France / for to treat of peace between her
lord ye king of England / and the king of France her brother.
THe king went tho unto London and there through counsel of sir Hugh Spenser
the fader. and of his sone and of master Robert Baldok a falls pylled clerk
his Chau^cheler. let sease to all the queen's lands into his hondes. and also
all ye lands that were sire Edwardes his sone. and were so put to their wagys
/ against all manner of reason. and that was through the falsnesse of the
Spensers. And when the king of france yt was queen Isabelles brother herd of
this falsnesse he was sore anoyed against the king of England and his false
counselors. wherefore he sent a letter to king Edward under his seale^ yt he
should come at a certain day to do his homage / and thereto he somoned him. and
else he should lose all Gascoyne. And so it was ordained in England through the
king and his counsel / that queen Isabel should go into France / for to treat
of peace between her lord and her brother. and that Olyuer of yngham should go
into Gascoyne / and have with him.vii.M. men armies and moo / to be Seneschall
and wardeyne of Gascoyne. and so it was ordained that queen Isabell / came into
France and with her went sir aymer of Valaunce earl of Penbroke that was
there murdered suddenly in apreuysege / but that was through gods vengau^ce for
he was one of the Iustycys that consented to saint thomas death of Lancastre and
would never after repent him of that wicked deed. And all that time sir Olyuer
of yngham went over into Gascoyne / and did much harm to ye king of
France and tho he gate again that king Edward had lost. and much more

with his mother / Isabel the queen / and his fader the king grauntyd him with a
good will / and said to him go my fair sone in goddys blyssynge and mine / and
think for to come again as hastily as thou may / And he went over the sea in
to France and the king of France his uncle received him with much honor /
and said unto him / Fair son ye be welcome / and for by cause that your father
come not to his homage. for ye duchye of Guyon / as his auncetours were wont
for to do. I give you that lordshyp hold it of me in heritage as all
manerauncetours did before you wherefore he was called duke of Guyon.

How the king exyled his queen ysabell and Edward her eldest sone.
AS king Edward of England herd tell how the king of France had give the
ducye of Guyon unto sir Edward his sone / without consent and will of him and
that is sone had received the duchye he became wonder wroth. and sent to his
sone by letter / yt they should come again in to England in all ye haste that
they might / And the queen Isabel and sir Edward her sone were wonder sore a
dradde of the kings menaced. and of his wrath / pryncypally for the falsnesse
of the Spensers / both of the fader / and also the sone. and at his
commandment they would not come wherefore king Edward was full sore anoyed /
and let make a cry at London / that if queen Isabell and Edward his eldest
sone / came not in England that they should be hold as our enmyes / both to
the reame and also to the crown of England and for that they nolde come into
england / but both were exyled the mother and her sone. When the quen herd

conyectynge of the Spensers / and went with ye knights that were exyled out
of England / for saint Thomas cause of Lancaster that is to say sir Roger of
wigmore. sir wyllyam Trusell sir Johan Cromwell and many other good knights
wherefore they took their counsel and ordained among them / for to make a
marriage between ye duke of Guyhenne ye kings sone of England and ye earls
daughter of Henaude / that was a noble knight of name. and doughty in his time.
and if that thing might be brought a bowte then^e stood they trowynge with the
help of god and with his help to recover their heritage in England / wherefore
they were put out through the false cocnectynge of the Spensers.

How king Edward through counsel of the Spensers sent to the Douzephers of
France. yt they should help that ye queen Isabell and her sone sir Edward
were exyled out of France.
AS king Edward and the Spensers herd how that queen Isabell and sir Edward
her sone* had alyed them to the Earl of Henaude / and to them that were exyled
out of england for cause of thomas of Lancastre they were so sorry that they
wist not what for to do / wherefore sir Hugh Spenser the sone said to sir Hugh
the fader in this manner wise. Fader cursyd by the time and the counsel that
ever ye consented that the queen Isabell should goo in to France / for to
treat of accord between the king of England and her brother the king of
france for that was your counsel. for at that time for soch your wytt failed
/ for I dread me sore / leest through her and her sone we shall be dystroyed.
But if we take the better counseylle. Now fair syres understand / how
merueylous felony and falshede the Spensers ymagyned and cast. For pryuely they
let fill five barelles ferrours with silver / the so^me amou^tyd.v.M. pound.

Arnold of Spain / that was a broker of London That he should go to the
Douzepers of France / that they should procure / and speak to the king of
France / that queen Isabell and her sone Edward were driven and exyled out of
France. And among all other things. That there were braught to ye death as
pryuely as they might but almighty god would not so / for when this Arnold was
in the high see / he was take wi^h Selanders that met him in the high see
and took him and ladde him to the earl of Henaude their lord and much Joy
was made for that taking. And at the last this Arnold pryuely stele a way
from thens. And came to London And of this taking and of other thyn^^s the
earl of Henaude said to the queen Isabell. Dame make you merry and be of good

full of silver. that were s^^te to the Dourpers of France for to slay you and
your sone Edward. and think you hastily for to goo in to England / and take
with you Sire Johan of Henaude my brother / and.v. hou^dred men of armies. For
many of them of France in whom ye have had great trust done you for to
scorn. and almighty god grant you that grace your enmyes to overcome. The
queen Isabell sent tho through Henaude and Flaundres / for her souldyours / and
ordened her every day for to go in to England again / and so she had in her
company sir Edmonde of wodstok. that was earl of Kent. that was sir Edwardes

man might bring sir Rogeres mortymer heed of wygmore. should have an hundred
pound of money for his trauall. And ferthermore he ordened by his patrent and
commanded to make. a fire upon every hill / beside the ryuers and in low
countrees. for to make high bekenesse of rymbre. That if it so were that the
alyuntes came unto land by night time that then^e the Inhabycauntys there

halle and said / that the queen Isabell was come to land at Herewhiche. and
has brought in her company sir Johan of Henande and with him me^ of arms
without nombre. And with that word sir Hugh Spenser ye fader spoke / and thus
unto the king said. My most worshypfull lord and king of England now make

men of armies. And with that word sir Hughe Spenser the fader cried with an
high voice and said / Alas alas we ben all betrays. Fortes with so little
power she had never come to land / but if folk of this lord were unto her
concente. And therefore after there mete they took counsel. and went to ward
walys for to arere the walsshmen against the queen Isabell and Edward her sone
/ all for to right and so they were in purpose every chone.

How master water Stapylton bishop of Excetre that was ye kings tresorer was
heedyd at London
ANd in the same time king Edward was sore adradde. leest that men of london
would yield them unto the queen Isabell And to her sone Edward / wherefore he
set master walter Stapylton his tresorer for to be wardeyne / and keeper of
the cite of London / with the Mayre / And so came to the Gyldeha^^e of London:
and axed the keys of the yates of the Cite / thrughe virtue and strength of his
commyssyon and would have had the keeping of the cite And ye comuners answered:
and said that they would keep the cite to the honor of king Edward and of
Isabell the queen / and of ye duke the kings sone without any more. the
bishop tho was sore onoyed / and swore oaths / they all should abye it anon
as the king Edward were come out of walyes. And ye comuners all anon of the
cite took ye bishop and lad him anon amyddes of the Chepe / and there they
smote of his heed / and set his heed in his right hand And forth with the same
comyns of the cite of London by heedyd two of his squyres yt held with the
bishop / and one of them was called wylliam of wayle / yt was the bishops
neuew And that other was called John^ of Padynto^. And also they took a burgeys
of London yt was called John^ Mershall. that was sir Hugh spe^ser espy the
fader and smote of his heed also: and in that same time ye bishop had in
London a fair toure in making in his close / upon the river Temse yt was
without temple bar / and he failed stone to make thereof an end and he
commanded his men to go the friar Carmes / and there they took stone to make
there with the toure / and much sonde and mortar and old robous that was left.
And for the dyspyte the bishop had done unto holy church / he and his two
squyres were buried in that sonde. As though they had been hounds / and there
they lay.xi. wekes till that the queen Isabell sent her letters to the
comuners / and prayed them that they would suffer and grant. that the bishop
might be take out of that place / and be buried at Excetre at his own church
And so he was / and his two squyres were buried at saint Clementes church
without temple bar. And it ^ was no wonder though that bishop deyed an
evil death. For he was a coueytous man and had with him no mercy / and evil
counseylled the king. And soon after was Arnold of Spain take. that asse^tye
to lead the.v.M.li. of silver in five barelles feryers unto ye douzepers of

time that he was take. would never eete no more meet ne drink no manner drink
/ for he wyste to have no mercy / sauf only to be deed. And the queen and her
counsel had ordained / that he should have be done to death at London. But he
was so feeble for his much fasting yt he was nygh deed and therefore it was
ordained. yt he should have his Judgment at her forde. and at a place of the
toure his heed was take from his body and also fro Robert Baldok yt was a falls

sir Hugh spensers counselers. And anon after was sir Hughe Spenser fader
hangyd and drawn / and heedyd at Brystow / and after hangyd aye^ by the armies
with two strong ropes. and the fourth day after he was hewn all to pecys /
and hounds ete him. And because that ye king had yeuen him ye erldom of
wynchestre his heed was sent thither and put upon a spear / And the false Baldok
was sent to London and there he deyed in prison among thieves / for men did him
no more reverence / than they would do unto an hounde. And so deyed the
traitors of England blessed be almighty god. And it was no wonder. for thrughe

your own lyege men as a king should. And therefore thrughe al ye comyns
assente / and all the lords of England / I tell unto you these words * ye
shal^e understood sir / that ye barons of England at one assente / will that
ye be no more king of England but utterly have put you out of your ryalte
for ever more / And the bishop of Ely said tho to the king sir Edward I
yield up feaute and homage for all the Archebisshops and bishops of England
and for all the clergy Tho said sir Johan earl of Garenne sir Edward I yield
up here unto you feaute and homage for me and for all the earls of England.
And sir Henry Percy yaue up also his homage for him and for all the barons of
England. And tho said sir wyllyam Cruscell / I yield up now unto you mine
homage for me and also for all the knights of England and for all them that
hold by seryau^tre. or by any other thing of you so that from this day after
ye shall not be clamyd king / another for king be hold for a synguler man of
all the people. And so they went thens to London that the lords of England
them abode / and sire Edward abode in prison in good keeping / And this was on
the day of the Conuersyon of saint Poule in the.xx. year of his regne.

Of the prophecye of Merlyn declared of king Edward the sone of king Edward
the first.
OF this king Edward prophesied merlyn and said that there should come a got
^t of Carre that should have horns of silver and aberde as white as snow. And
a drope should come out of his nosethrylles / yt should betoken much harm
Hungre / and death of people and great loss of his land / And that in the
beginning of his reyge should be hau^ted much lechery. And he said sothe.
alas ye time For king Edward yt was king Edward sone was borne at
Carnaryuane in walys for sothe he horns of silver: and a berde as white as
snow when he was made prince of walys to much he yaue him to riot. and to
folly And so much Merlyn in his prohhecye yt there should come out of his nose
a drope. For in his time was great hungre among the poor people / and strong
death among the rich / yt deyed in strange land with much sorrow / and in
were in Soctlonde. And after he lost Scotlonde and Gascoyne / and while that
himself was king there was much lechery hau^tyd. And also Merlyn told and
said that this got should seek the flower of life and of death and he said sothe.
For he spowsyd Isabell the kings sister of France And in his time Merlyn said
/ that there should be made brydges of folk upon dyches of ye see / and that
was well seen at Bannockysborne in Scotlonde when he was dysco^fyted there of
the Scotts / And Merlyn told also that stones should fall from castles. and
many towns should be made plain. And he said sothe / For when that king
Edward was dysco^fyted in Scotlonde and came tho south ward / ye Scotts
besegyd the castles / and did them much harm and brent towns in to the
herd earth And after ward Merlyn told that an Egle should come of Corn wayle
/ that should have feders of gold / yt of pride should have no pere and he
shield despise lords of blod and after he should dey through a beer at
Gauersych and that prophecye was full well know and funde sothe For by the
egle understand sir Pers of ganaston that tho was earl of Corn wayle yt was a
wonder proud man that despised ye baronage of England. but after ward he was
heeded act Gauersich thrughe the earl of Lancastre and through therle of warwyk.
And merlyn told / that in his time it should seem that the beer should brenne
and that battle should be upon an arm of the sea in an field / arrayed like a
shield where should deye many white hedes. And he said sothe. For by the
brynnynge of the beer yt betokenyd great dread through kyttyng of swerdes at
that bataylle of Myton / for there came the Scotts in manner of a s^elde / in
manner of a wynge and slew men of relegyon prestes and seculers / wherefore the
Scotts called that battle in dyspyce of the Englyssmen / the which battle.
And after Merlyn said the forsayde beer should do the got much harm. and
that should be upon the south west. and also upon his blood / And said also /
that the got should lose much deal of his land. till the time ye shame
should him over come / and them he should clothe hm in a lions skyn^e should
win again that he had lost and more through people that should come out of the
Northwest / that should make him to be a ferde. And him avenge upon his enmyes
through counsel of two owls / ye first should be in pa^yll to be undone. And
that tho two owls should go over see in to strange land. And there they should
dwell unto a certain time. and then they should come in to England again /
And tho owls should do much harm unto many one. And that they should
counsel the got to meue war against the foresaid beer. And the got and the
owls. should to an arm of the sea at Burton trente / and should go over / and
that for dread the beer should flee with a swanne in company to Bury toward
the. North. through an unkind outpulter / and that the swanne then^e shall be
slain with sorrow / and the beer should be slain full nyghe his own nest.
that should stand upon pounfret / upon whom the son shall shede his beemes.
And many folk him shall seek for virtue. And he said sothe. For the good earl
Thomas of Lancastre was borne in ye Northwest And cosyn to the king. and his
uncles sone. and by law he made the king lose much land / the which he had
purchacyd wylfully. till at the last the king took thereof shame / and him self
slew with cruelte And after he gate again that he had lost / and much more
through folk that he ^ette assemble out of ye Northwest / tha^ made him to be
adradde. And auengyd him on his barons / through counsel of sir Hugh Spenser
the fader / and of sir Hugh the sone that before were outlawed for their
wyckydnesse^ But afterward they came again in to England / sir ^e wer^^ upon
Thomas of Lancast^^. So yt the king and the Spensers and the earl of Arundell
and their power met with Thomas of Lancastre (...) Burton upon trente / and
him there dyscomfyted and sir Vmfroy earl of her forde was in his company. And
after fled ye foresaid Thomas and Humfroy with their company to burbrugge
metinge with sir Andrew of Herkela / that is called the unkind outpulter / and
also sir* Symonde ward earl of york came and met with Thomas of Lancastre
with an huge power / and the^ dyscomfyted and in that scomfyture the earl of
Herforde was slain upon the bridge cowardly with spear in the foundement. and
the earl Thomas was take and ladde unto Pou^fret. and tho was heedyd beside his
own castle. But afterward many him sought for miracles that god did for
him. And in that time Merlyn said. for sorrow and harm should deye a people of
his land / wherefore many lands should be upon him the more bolder / and he
said sothe for because of his barons that were done to death for saint Thomas
quarrel of Lancastre. people of many lands became the bolder / for to meue
werre upon the king / for their blood was turned to many nacyons. And
afterward Merlyn told and said that the foresaid owls should do much harm
unto the flour of life and death / and they should bring her to much / dysese.
So that she should go over see into France. for to make peace to the flower
delight. and there should abide till a time her sede should come and fetch her
/ and tho they should abide both till the time that they should clothe them
with grace / and tho two owls she should seek. And put the^ to pyteuous death.
And that prophecy was full well know. and was full sothe / for sir Hugh
Spenser the fader. and sir Hugh the sone / did much sorrow and persecucyon
unto ye queen Isabel through their procurement to her lord the king / So they
ordained among them. that she was wagys. That is to say.xx. shelynges in the
day wherefore ye king of France her brother was sore anoyed. and sent into
England by his letters unto king Edward to come unto his parliament to Paris
in France. But king Edward was sore adradde to come there / for he wend to
have be arestyd till yt he had made amends for the trespase ye sir Hugh
Spenser the fader and the sone had done and for ye harm that they had done
unto queen Isabell h^^ sister / wherefore thrughe his ordinance and consent of
the. Spensers. the queen Isabell went over see in to France for to make
accord between king Edward and the king of France her brother. And there
dwelled she in France till Edward her Eldest sone came her for to seek / and
so they dwelled there both till that alyaunce was made between the^ and the
gentle earl of Henaude / that if they with there virtue might dystroye and
overcome the venym and the falsnesse of the Spenser / that sir Edward should
spowse dome Phylyp the worshypfull lady / and the earls daughter of Henaude /
wherefore the queen Isabel and Edward her sone / and sir Edward of wodstok the
kings brother of England / and sir John^ of Henaude / and sir Roger Mortymer
of wygmore / and sir Thomas Rocelyn and sir Johan of Cromwell and sir wyllyam
Trussell / and many other of the alyaunce of the gentle earl Thomas of
Lancastre / that were exyled out of England for his quarrel / and were
dysheryted of their lands / ordained / them a great power / and arrived at
Here with in South folk / And soon after they pursewed ye Spense^s till that
they were taken and put pyteuous death as before is said. and their company
also for the great falsnes yt they did to king Edward to his people. And
Merlyn said also more that the got should be put in great distress and in
great angusshe and in grte sorrow he should be led his life / and he said sothe
For after the time that king Edward was take he was put into ward till that
the Spensers were put to death / and also because that he would not come unto
his parliament at. London as he had ordained and assygned himself unto his
baronage / and also would not govern. and rule his people / ne his reame as a
king should do. Wherefore some of the barons of England came and yield up
there homages unto him / for them and all the other of the reame. in the day of
the co^uersyon of saint Poule in the year of his regne.xx. And they put him out
of his ryaltee for evermore / And ever lived afterward in much sorrow and
anguysshe.

LOdowicus was Emperor after Henry four^ year. this Lodowicus was duke of
Banare and he despised the coronacio^ of ye pope wherefore ye pope hy^ / and
much labor and deposyd many perils he had aft. and he trowbled greatly the
unity of holy church. And the^ was chosyn against him Frederyk ye duke of
Ostryche. and he over came the duke and abode a rebelyon to his end. and in
great peril to his soul / And at the last Karolus was chosyn against him / the
which preuaylled / and suddenly Lodowic fell down of his horse and dyscessyd.
John^ Mandeuyll a douctour of physyk and a knight borne was in England abowte
this time. And he made a merueyllous pilgrimage. For he went almoost abowte all
the world And he wrote his dedys in three langages. and decessyd^ and was
buried at Saint Albons. Benedictus the.xxii. was pope after John^.vii. years
and more / this man was a monk / and in all his ynogthe he was of good
conuersacyon / and a doctor of dyuinite. And when he was made pope he
reformed thorder of saint Benet in that thing yt was nescessary / and he was
a hard man to grant benefyces / lest he had grau^tyd it to an vncunnynge man
/ he made a decretall / the which began (Benedictus deus in donis suis) And he
was very cruel in faith / and for that of sommen little louyd / he was so
stout a man that almoost he would not know his own cosyns.

Anno dm^.M.CCC.xxii. Of king Edward the third after the Conqueste.
ANd after this king Edward Carnariuan reigned sir Edward of wyndsore his sone
/ the which was crowned king / and anointed at westmestre / through counsel
and consent of all the great lords of ye reame. the Sunday in Candelmasse
eve. in the year of grace. M.CCC.xxvi. that was of aege at that time but.xv.
year. And for cause yt his fader was in ward in the castle of Kenilworth and
also was put down of his ryaltee / the reame of England was without king from
ye feast of saint Katheryn from the year above said to the feast of
Candelmasse. And tho were all manner plees of the kings bynche astente. And
tho was commanded to all the Shyrefs of England thrughe writ to warn the
parties to defendau^tys / through somnynge again. And also ferthermore / that all
prisoners yt were in the kings gayolles / that were attachid through Shyrefs
should be let go quyte. The king Edward after his coronacyon / at the prayer
/ and besechynge of his lyege of ye reame grau^tyd them a chartre of steadfast
peace to all them that would it axe / And sir Iohnn of Henaude. and his company
took his leave of the king and of the lords of the reame. and tornyd home to
their own country again. And each of them hade full rich yeftes. every men as
he was of value and estate. And tho was England in rest and peace / and great
love between the king and his lords. And comynly englysshmen said among them
that the devil was deed but the innumerable / tresour of the king his fader /
and the tresour of the Spensers / both of the fader and of the sone / and of
the earl of Arundell / and of master Robert Baldok that was the kings
chau^celer was departed after the queen Isabelles ordinance and sir Roger
Mortymers of wygmore / so that the king had no thing thereof. but at her
will and her delyuerrau^ce / ne of their lo^des as afterward ye shall here.
How king Edward went unto sta^thop for to mete ye scotts.

ANd yet in the same time was the King in the castle of kenilworth under the
keeping of sir Henry / yt was earl Thomas of Lancastres brother. that tho was
earl of Leycetre. And the king grau^tyd him ye erldome of Lancastre / that ye
king his fader had seasyd in to his hand and put out Thomas of Lancasters
brother. and so was he earl of Lancastre and of Leycetre / and also Stywarde of
England as his brother was in his time But sir Edward that was king Edwardes
fader made sorrow without end / by cause he might not speak with his wife. ne
with his sone / wherefore he was in much myscheyf / For though it was so that
he was led and ruled by falls counseyll / yet he was king Edward^ sone called
Edward with the long shankys / and came out of the worthyest blood of the
world. and they to whom he was wont to give great yeftes and large. were most
pryue with the king his own sone / and they were his enmyes both night and
day / and procured to make debate and contake between him and his sone / and
Isabell his wife But the friar prechers were to him good fre^des ever more and
cast both by night and by day. how they might bring him out of prison. And
among their company that ye freres had privily brought / there was a friar yt
was called / Dunhened ^ and he had ordained and gadryd a great company of folk
to keep at that need / but ye friar was taken and put in (...) of Pountfret /
and there he deyed in prison / and sir Henry earl of Lancastre / that had ye
kings fader in keeping / through co^mau^deme^te of the king. delivered Edward
ye kings fader by ende^ture of sir Thomas of Berkelay. And so sir John^
Matreuas and they ladde him from ye castle of kenylworth to the castle of
Berkelay / and kept him there saufly. And at Ester next after his coronacyon:
the king ordained a great huge host / for to fight against the Scotts And sir
John^ the earls brother of Henaue came from beyond the sea / for to help
king Edward / and brought with him.vii.C. men of armies and arrived at Dover
/ and they had leave for to go forth till they came to york There the king
them abode / and the Scotts came thither to ye king / for to make peace and
accord / but the accordement lasted not between them bat a little time And at
that time ye Englysshmen were clothed al in cotes and hodes painted with
letters and with flowers full semely with long berdes and therefore the Scotts
made a byl that was fastenyd upon ye church doors of Saint Petyr toward
stangate. and thus said ye scripture in dyspyte of Englysshemen Long berdes
hertles / prynted hodes wytles gay cotes graceles / makyth England thryftles

SO in the Trinyte day next after began the contak in the cite of york
between the Englysshmen and ye Henaudes: and in ye debate were slain of ye
erldom of Nicholl and murdered lxxx. men. and after they were buried in saint
clementis church in Folgate. and for cause that the Henaudes came to help the
king. there peace was ^ryed upon pain of life and lymme. in that other half it
was found by an enquest of the city that the Englysshmen began the debate.

How the Englysshme^ stoppyd the Scotts in the park of Stanope and how they
turned again into Scotlonde.
This time the Scotts had assembled all their power and came into England and
slew and robbyd all yt they might take and brent and dystroyed all the North
country through out / till that they came unto the park of S^a^hope in
weridale / and there ye Scotts held them in a bussment / but wha^ ye king
had hard thorou spies where ye Scotts were anon right host desegyd them
within the foresaid park so that ye scotts wist not where to go out but only
unto there harms. And they abode in the park.xv. days / and vytaylles faylled
them in every side. so that they were greatly peyred of bodies and sith that
Bruce came first into Brytayne unto this time / there was never seen so fair
an host / what of Englysshmen / and of alya^ces and of men of foot / the
which ordained them for to fight with ye Scotts / through eggynge of sir
Henry of Lancastre and of sir Johan Henaude. yt would have gone over the water
of with for to have fought with the ^ Scotts. But sir Roger Mortymer co^sentyd
not thereto / for he had pryuely taken mede of the Scotts them to help that
they might go away into their own country. And this same Mortymer counseylled
somoche Thomas of brotherton ye earl Marshall that was king Edwardes uncle.
that ye foresaid Thomas should not assemble at ye time unto the Scotts. And he
assentyd. but wyste not the doing between the Scotts and the foresaid Mortymer
/ And by cause yt he was Marshall of England / as to him perteyned ever after
ward. he sent hastily to the earl of Lancastre / and to sir John^ of Henaude /
yt they should not fight with the Scotts / in preiudyce and harming of him
and his fee / and if they did that they should stand to their own paryll.
And the foresaid earl Marshall was all arrayed with his battle. at the reredoos
of the earl of Lancastre / for to have fought with him and with his folk if he
had go to fight with the Scotts / and in this manner he was deceived and wyste
no thing of the treason And thus was the king pryncypally dysceyued. And when
it was night Mortymer / yt had the watch for to keep of ye host / that night
distrobled ye watch yt no thing might be done. And in the mean while the
Scotts stele by night to ward their own country as fast as they might. And so
was the king fasly betrayed that wenyd that all ye traitors of land had been
brought to an end as it was said before. Now here you lords how tratoursly
king Edward was dysceyued. and how meruayllously. and boldly the scotts did
of werre / For James douglas with two hundred men of armies rode thrught out all
the host of king Edward / the same night the Scotts escaped toward their
own country as is above said / till that they came to ye kings pauylyon / and
slew there many men in their beds / and cried Naward naward / and another time
a Douglas a Douglas wherefore the king that was in his pauylyon and much other
^^lke were wonder sore a frayed / But blyssyd be almighty god ye king was not
taken / and in greto peril was tho the reame of England. and that night the moon shone full clear / and bryghte. And for all the kings men the Scotts
scapyd harmeles. And oon the morrow when the king wyste that the Scotts were
escapyd in to their own country he was wonder sorry / and fulle hertely wept
with his young eyne / and yet wyste he not who had him done that treason^
But that falls treasone was fulle well I known a good while after as the
storye makyth mencyon. Tho king Edward came again unto york full sorrowful And
his host departed / and every man went in to his own country with full heavy
chere and morning semblaunt / And the Henaudes took their leave and went in to
their own country. And the king for their trauayll / hugely reward them.
And for because of that vyage / the king had dyspended much of his tresoure
and wastyd. And in that time were seen two moons in the fyrmament / ye one was
clear / and that other was derke* / as men might see through the world. And a
great debate was that same time against pope Johan the.xxii. after saint Petyr.
and the emperor of Almayn tho made him emperor against ye popys will that tho
held his see at Auinyon. werfore the emperor made his cry at Rome and
ordained a another pope / ye hight Nycholas / yt was a friar Mynor / and that
was ayeng the right of holy church. wherefore he was cursyd. and the power of
that other pope soon laid. And for cause that such merueylles were seen /
men said that the world was nygh at an end.

Of the death of king Edward of Carnaryuan.
ANd now go we again / to sir Edward of Carnaryuan yt was king Edwardes fader
sometime king of England. and put down of his dygnyte. Alas for his
trybulacyon and sorrow that him befell through falls counsel. yt he louyd and
trustyd upon to much. yt after ward were dystroyed thrughe their falsnesse as
god would. And this Edward of Carnariuan / was in the castle of Berkelay under
ye ward and keeping of sir Moryce of Herkelay / and also of sir John^ Matreues
and to them he made his complaynte of his sorrow and of his dysesee. and often
times axyed of his wardeyns. what he had trespassyd against dame Isabell his wife
and sir Edward his sone. yt was made new king / that they would not vysyte
him. And tho answerde one of his wardeyns and said. My worthy lord dyspleyse
you not yt I shall tell you the cause is for it is done them to understand /
that if my lady your wife came any thing nyghe you^ that ye would her
strangle and slay / and also that ye walde do to my lord your sone in the
same wise. Tho answerde he with simple there Alas alas am not I in prison / and
all at your own will / now god yt wot I thought yt never / and now I would
that I were deed / so would god that I were. For then were all my sorrow
passyd. It was not long after that ye king through counsel of Roger Mortymer
/ grau^tyd the ward and keeping of sir Edward his fader unto sir thomas
Toioursy and to the foresaid sir Johan Matreuers through the kings letter / and
put out holy the foresaid sir Moryce of the ward of the king. And they took
and ladde the king unto the castle of Corf. the which castle the king
hatyd as any death. And they kept him there tylle it came unto saint / Mathewes
day in Septembre in the year of grace.M.CCC.xxvii. that the forsayde sir Roger
Mortymer sent the manner of the death / how and in what wise should be done to
death. And anon as the foresaid Thomas and Johan had see the letter / and
commandment / they made king edward Carnariuan good there: and good solace
/ as they might at that soupere / and nothing the king wist of the traytory.
And when time was for to go to bed the king went to his bed and lay and
slepte fast. And as the king lay and slepte the trautours falls forsworn
against their homage and feaute came pryuely into the kings chamber / and their
company with them / and laid an huge take upon his womb / and with men
pressyd / and held fast down the four corners of the table on his body /
wherwyth the good mane a woke / and was wonder sore adradde to be deed and
there slain / and turned his body up tho so down. Tho took the false
traitors / and tynauntes an horn. And put it in to his foundemente as deep as
they might / and a spyt of copre brennynge / and put it thrughe the horn in
to his body and so they slew their lord / that no thing was perceived /
And after he was enteryd at Gloucetree.

How king Edward spowsyd Phylyp ye earls daughter of Henaude at york.
ANd after Crystmasse tho next sewynge sir Johan of henaude brought with him
Phylyp his brothers daughter / yt was earl of Henaude his nece in to England /
and the king spowsyd her at york. with much honor. And sir Johan of
Bothum bishop of Ely / and sir wyllyam of Melton Archebysshop of york / sange
the mass the Sunday on the even of the Conuersyon of saint Poule / In the
year of grace.M.CCC.xxvii. But because that the king was but young and tender
of aege when he was crowned full many wornges were done while that his fader
lived / because that he trowed / the counserllers that were falls about hy^ /
that cou^syelled him to do other wise tha^ reason would wherefore great harm
was do to ye reame and to ye king / and all me^ dyrected it the kings deed /
and it was not so almighty god it wot / wherefore it was ordained at the
kings crownynge. that ye king for his tender aege / should be governed
by.xii. of the grettest lords of England / without whom no thing should be
done. That is to say tharchebysshop of Caunterbury / tarchebysshop of york /
the bishop of wynchestre / and the bishop of Herforde / the earl of Lancastre
/ therle Marchall / and the earl of kent / that were ye kings uncles. and the
earl of Garenne / sir Thomas wake. Sir Henry Percy. sir Olyuer yngham and Johan
Rous barons / all these were sworn truly for to counseyll the king. And they
should answer every year in parliament / of that that should be done in the time
of their gouernall / but that ordinance was sone undone / and that was much
harm to all England / For the king and all ye lords that should govern him
were governed and ruled after the queen his mother dame Isabell. and by sir
Roger Mortymer: and as they would all thing was done / both among high and
low. And they took unto them castles towns lands / and rentes in great
harm. And loss to the crown. and of the estate out of all mesure.

How the peace was made between the Englyssheme^ and the Scotts and also of
Iustyfyenge of Troylesbaston.
King Edward at wytsontyde in the second year of this regne thrughe the
counsel of his mother / and sir Roger Mortymer / ordained a parliament at
Northampton. and at that parliament ye king thrughe his counsel / and none
other of ye land / within aege grauntyd to be accordyd with ye scotts in this
manner. that all ye f^autees and homages. that ye scotts should do to the
crown of England / foryaue them for evermore / by his chartre ensealed. And
ferder more an endenture was made of the Scotts unto king Edward / that was
king He^ries sone / which endenture they call it regman. In ye which were
contained all the homages and feautees / First of the king of Scotlond and of
the prelates / earls barons of ye reame of Scotlonde with their seals set
thereon and other chartres and reme^brau^cis that king Edward and his barons
had of their right in ye foresaid reame of Scotlonde / it was foryeue again holy
church / and also with the blake cross of Scotlond ye which the good king
Edward conquered in Scotlo^de and brought it out of ye abbay of scone that is
a full precious relyque / and also ferthermore / he relacyd and fully forgave
the land that the noble barons had before that ty^e in ye ream of Scotlond /
by old conquest. And ferthermore yt this peace for to be holden and co^tynuelly
last the Scotts were bound unto ye king in xxx. thousand pound of silver
to be paid within three year / that is every year.x.M. pound by eue^ procyons.
And ferthermore above all this they spoke between the parties above said. ye
Dauyd Drytonautyer that was king Roberte Brus sone / ye falls tyrant* and falls
forsworn against his oath yt arose against his leyge lord ye noble and good
king Edward. and falsely made him king of Scotlonde / yt was of aege.v. year.
And so this cursyd counsel David spoused at Berewyk dame John^ of ye Toure /
that was king Edwardes sister / as the gestes tellyth upon Mary Mawdeleyns
day. in the year of grace. M.CCC.xxviii. to great harm and empayrynge of all
the kings blood whereof that gentle lady came. alas the time / For wonder
much ye fayer da^oysell dysperagyd / sith that she was married against all the
comyns will and assent of England. And from the time that Brute had conquered
Albyon^ and named the land after his own name. Brytayne: that now is called
England after the name of Engyst And so the reame of Scotlonde was hold of
the reame of England / and of ye crown by feaute and homgae. For Brute
conquered that land and yaue it to Albanak / yt was his second sone / And he
called ye land Albayn after his own name / so that his heirs yt came after
him. should hold of Brute and of his heirs / yt is to say of the kings of
Brytayn / by feaute and homage: And from that time unto this time of king
Edward / the tame of Scotlond was hold of the reame of England by feaute and
service / as above is said in the Chronicles of England and of Scotlonde and
berythe witness more plainly. And accursyd be ye time that this parliament was
holden at Northampton For there by falls councyll. the king was there falsely
dysheryted and yet he was with in aege. And yet when that king Edward was put
out of his ryalte of England yet men put not out of the feautes and seruyse
Scotlonde. Ne of the fraunchyses dysheryted him for ever more. And nevertheless
the great lords of england were against to conferme the peace and the ^rwes
abouesayd / sa^f only queen Isabell / yt tho was the kings mother Edward / and
the bishop of Ely / and the lord Mortimer. But reason and law would not that
a fynalle peace should be made between them without the common assente of
England.

Of the debate that was between queen Isabell and sir Henry earl of Lancastre
and of Leycetre / and of the riding of Bedforde.
THen as the for said Dauyd had spowsyd dame Iohan^e of the toure in ye town
of Berwyk as before is said / The Scotts in dyspyte of ye Englysshmen called
dame Iohanne the countess make peace / for the cowardly peace yt tho was
ordained. But ye kings person bare all the wit and blame with wrong of
making of the accord / And all was done through the queen / and Roger
Mortymer. And it was not long after that the queen Isabell ne took in to her
hondes all the lordshyp of Pountfret almost all the lands that were of any
value that apperteyned to the crown of England / So the king had not to
dyspendede / but of his uses and of his escheker / For the queen Isabell and
the Mortymer had great main of the retenewe yt followed ye kings court ever
more and went and took the kings pryces for her penny worthes at good ch^pe /
wherefore the country that they came in were / fullsore addrade / and almoost
dystroyed of them. Tho began the comyna^te of England for to have envy to
Isabell the queen. yt somoche louyd her before when she came again for to pursue
ye falls traitors ye Spensers fro France. And in that same time the false
traitor Roberte of Holonde / that bytrayed his lord sir Thomas of Lancastre.
was tho delyuerde and out of prison / and was wonder preuy witth the queen
Isabell / and also with Roger Mortymer. But that auaylld him but little For he
was taken at Myghelmasse yt tho came next after / as he rode to ward queen
Isabell to London / and sir Thomas whyther smote of his heed besides the town
of saint Albons And this sir Thomas dwelled with sir Henry earl of Lancastre /
and he put him aside for dread of the queen / For the queen loved him wonder
much. And prayed unto the king for him that ye same Thomas might be exyled out
of England. And the noble earl sir Henry of Lancastre had often times herd
the common claymore of ye Enghysshmen / of ye disease that were done in England
/ and also for diverse wro^ges that were done to the common people. of the which
the king bare the blame with wrong For he was but fulle young and tender of
aege. and thought as a good man / for to do away / and slake the sklau^der of
ye kings person / if that he might in any manner a wise / so as the king was
thereof nothing gylty / wherefore he was inperyll of life and lymme^ And so he
assembled all his retenuwe and went and spoke with them of the kings honor
/ and also for to amend his estate. And sir Thomas Brotherton earl of Marchall
/ and sir Edmond wodstok / that were the kings uncles / and also men of London
made their oath him fo. to mayntene in ye same quarrel. And their cause was
this / that the king should hold his house and his meyne / as a king ought
for to do / and have all his ryalt^e^ And that the queen Isabell should deliver
out of her hondes in to the kings hand all manner of lordshyps rentys /
towns and castles that apperteyneth unto the crown of England as other
queen's have done here before / and meddle with none other thing. And also that
sir Roger Mortymer should abide and dwell upon his own^ lands / For much
people / In so much that the common people were dystroyed and gretely domaged /
thoroughe such wrongfulle taking. And also the enquere how and by whom that
the king was betrayed and falsely dysceyued at Stanhope / and thrughe whose
counseyll that the Scotts went away by night from the king / And also how
and through whoos counseyll the ordinance that were made at the kings
coronacyon / was put down. That is to say / that the king for amendment and
helping of his reame / and in honor of him should be governed and ruled
by.xii. of the grettest and wysest lords of the reame / and without them
Should no thing be grauntyd ne done / as before is said / which couenauntes
were malicyously put down fro the king / where many harms. shamys and
repreues have fall to the king and his reame / and that is to understand for
asmoche as Edward king of England some time / was ordained by assent in
plain parliament for to be under ward and governance of Henry earl of
Lancastre his cosyn / for salvation of his dody he was take out of the castle
of Kenilworth / there that he was in ward. and through color of queen Isabell
/ and of the Mortymer without consent of any parliament they took and ladde him
there that never after none of his kynred / might with him speak ne see. and
after tratorursly took and morored him for whose death arose a sklau^dre through
all crystendom when it was done. And also the tresore ye sire Edward of
Kernaruian left in many places in England and in walys was wastyd and borne
away / without the will of king Edward his sone / in dystruccyo^ of him and
of al his folk. Also thrughe whose counseyll / that ye king yaue up the
kingdom of Scotlond / for the which reame / the kings au^cetours had full
sore traueiled / and so did many a noble man for their right / and was
delivered unto dauyd that was Robert brus sone all ye right / yt no right had
to the reame. as all the world it wist. And also by whom the chartres and
reme^braunces yt they had of the right Scotlond were take out of the tresory /
taken to the Scotts the kings enmyes / to dysheritynge of him and of his
successors / and to great harm of his lyeges / and great repreef to all
Englysshemen for ever more. Also wherefore dame Johan of the toure the kings
sister Edward / was dysperagyd and married unto Dauyd that was Robertbrus sone.
that was a traitor and enmye unto England. and through whoos counseyl she was
take into our enmyes hondes out of England. And in this mean while. ye good
earl Henry of Lancaster and his company took counseyl how those points above
said might be amended to the worship of the king and to his profit and to the
profit of his leyges / and the queen Isabel thrughe coniectynge and also of
the Mortymers let ordeyne a parliament at Salysburye. And at ye same parliament
/ the Mortymer was made earl of March against all the barons will of England
in preiudyce of ye king and of his crown And sir Johan of Eltham the kings
brother was gyrde with a sword of Corn waylle. and tho was called earl of
Corn waylle. and ever more queen Isabell procuryd so much against her sone ye
king / that she had the ward of ye forsayde sir Edward and of his lo^des. And
at that parlemente the earl of Lancastre would not come / But ordained all his
power against queen Isabel and the Mortymer / And men of London ordained them
with five hundred men of armies. When queen Isabel wist of the doing (...)
swore by god and by his names full angerly / that in an evil time he thought
upon tho points / Tho sent the queen Isabell and the Mortymer after their
retenwe and after the kyngys retenewe / so that they had ordained among them
an huge host. And they counseylled the king / so that upon a night ^ they
rode.xxiii. miles to Bedford / there the earl of Lancastre was with his company
/ and thought to have him dystroyed / and that night she rode beside the king
her sone as a knight for dread of death. And it was done the king to understand
/ that the earl Henry of Lancastre and his company would have dystroyed the
king and his counseylle for ever more / wherefore the king was somdele to
wards him heavy and anoye^ When the earl Marshall and therle of Kente the
kings brother herd of this tidings / they rode so in message between them
/ that the king grauntyd him his peace to therle Henry of Lancastre / for a
certain raunsomme of an leven thousand pound / But that was never paid
afterward. And these were the lords that held with Sir Henry of Lancastre.
Sir Beaumont / sir Fouk fytz waren sir Thomas Rocelyn / Sir wyllyam Trusdr^^
^ynghtes moo that were to him consented / and all those were exyled thrughe
counseylle of the queen Isabell and of Mortymer. For ye Mortymer waited to have
their lo^des if that he might through any manner coniectynge / For he was to
coueytous and had to much his will and that was great pity.

How king Edward went over the sea for to do his homage unto the king of
France / for the duchye of Guyhenne.
IT was not long after that the king of France / through counseyll of his
Donzepers / sent to king Edward of Englode that he should come to Paris and
do his homage as reason it would / for the duchye of Guyon / and so thrughe
counsel of the lords of England king Edward went over see. And at the
Ascyon tide / he came unto Paris / the third year of his regne / for to do his
homage unto the king of france. and the king received his homage / and made of
him much Joy and worship / but when king Edward had done his homage hastyly
he was sent for in to England through the quen Isabell his mother and anon
hastyly he came again in to England / upon wytsonday without any taking leave
of ye king of France. wherefore he was wonder wroth.

How sir Roger Mortymer bare him proudely and so high.
ANd now shall ye here of sir roger mortymer of wygmore that desired and
coueted to be at an high astate / so that the king grauntyd him to be called
earl of March thorughe out all his lordshyp. And he became so proud and
hauteyn / yt he would lose and forsake the name yt his elders had ever be fore
/ and for ye cause he let him call earl of march. And none of the comnyns of
England durst call him by other name / for he was called so by ye kyngys
cry. that men should call him earl of March And mortymer bare him so hauteyn
and so proud that wonder it was for to wit. and also dysguysed him with
wo^nder rich clothes out of al manner of reason / both of shapynge and of
werynge. where of the Englysshmen had great wonder / how / and in what manner he
might contryue or find such manner pride. and they s^yd among them comynly /
yt his pride should not long endure. And the same time sir Gyffray Mortymer
the young / that was mortymers sone. let call him king of folly / and so it
befell after ward in deed / for he was so full of pride and of wretchydnesse
/ that he held a round table in walys / to all men that the der came / and
cou^terfeted the doing and the manner of king Arthurs table / but openly he
failed / for the noble king Arthur was ye most noble lord of renomme / that
was in all the world in his time and yet came never none such after / For all
ye noble knights i^ all cryste^dom of dedys of armies assayed / dwelled with
king Arthur / and held him for there lord and sovereign / And that was well
seen / for he conquered in a bataylle a Romayne yt was called Froll. And gate
of him the reame of France and slew him with his own hondes / and also he
faught with a gyaunt that was called Dynabus / and slew him that had rauysshed
fair Elayne that was king Howels ne^e / king of little Brytayn and after he
slew in bataylle the Emperor of rome / yt was called Lucye / that had
assembled against Arthur / for to fight with him so much people of Romans and
Pebytes and sarasyns / that no man cowde nombre them / and he dyscomfyted them
all as the story tellyth And in that same thyme common voice spronge in England
through coniectynge and ordinance of the friar prechers / that sir Edward of
Carnariuan / that was king Edwardes fader of whom the geste tellyth / said
that he was alive in the castle of Corf / whereof all the comyns of England
almoost were i^ sorrow and dread / whether that it were so or not / For they
wist not how traytoursly Mortymer had him done murthred.

How Edmonde of wodstok that was earl of Kente and the kings brother Edward
of Carnaryuan / was heedyd at wynchestre.
ANd upon a time it befell so / that sir Edmonde of wodstok earl of Kent
spoke unto pope Johan the.xxii. at Auinion / and said that almighty god had
often times done for Thomas love of Lancastre many great miracles to many men
and wymmen / yt were thrughe diverse maladyes undone. As unto the world / and
thrughe his prayer they were brought unto there health. and so sir Edmonde
prayed the pope hertely that he would grant him grace / the forsayde Thomas
might be traunslatyd. But the pope said nay that he should not be
traunslatyd / unto the time that he were better certyfyed of the clergy of
England and seen by their obedyence what thing god had done for the love of
saint Thomas of Lancaster after the suggestio^ that the foresaid earl of Kent
had unto him made And when this Edmonde saw that he might not speed of his
purpos: as touching the traunslacion He prayed hy^ of counsel. as touching
sir Edward of Carnariuan his brother / and said. that not long agon he was
king of England / what thing might best be done as touching his
delyuerau^ce / sithe yt a comune fame was through England yt he is alive. hole
and sauf wha^ ye pope herd hy^ tell yt sir Edward was alive. He commanded ye
earl upon his blyssynge. that he should help with all the power that he might
/ that he were delivered out of prison / and save his body in all manner that
he might. And to bring this thing to an end he assoyled him and his company
a pena et culpa) and all that to his delyuerau^ce. Tho took Edmond of wodstok
his leave of ye pope and came again into England / and wha^ sir Edmonde was come
/ some of ye friar prechers came and said that sir Edward his brother yet was
alive in ye castle of Corf / under ye keeping of sir Thomas Gurnay. tho sped
hy^ the foresaid Edmonde as fast as he might / till he came to ye castle of Corf
/ and acquaynted him and spoke so fair to John^ Dauerel / that was conestable
of the same castle / and yaue him rich yeftes for to have acquayntaunce of
him and to know of his counsel. And thus it befell that the foresaid Edmonde
prayed specially to tell him pryuely of his lord his brother sir Edward / if
that he lived or were deed / and if he were alive he prayed him ones to have a
sight of him. And this sir John^ Daueryl was a high herted man and full of
courage / and answerde shortly to sir Edmond and said / that sir Edward his
brother was in health. and under his keeping. and durst not show him unto no
man sith it was defended him in the kyngys half Edward / yt was Edwardes sone
of Carnuariuan and also by the commandment of queen Isabel ye kings mother /
and of sir Roger Mortymer / that he should show his body to no man of the
world sauf only to the^ upon life and lym^e and disherytynge of his heirs for
ever more. But the false traitor falsely lied. For he was not in his ward / but
was take the^s and lad to the castle of Berkeley by sir Thomas of gurney by
the co^mau^demente of Mortymer till he was deed as before is said / But sir
Edmonde of wodstok wist no thing that sir edward his brother was deed /
whereupon he took a letter unto king Edward his brother as to his worthy lord
and received ye letter of him and behyght him right faithful to do his message
without fayll. And with that sir Edmonde took leave of the foresaid John^ / and
yede into his own country and lordshyp in kent that he had there. Anon as
this same Johan wist. that sir Edmonde was gone into Kent his own lordshyp.
anon he went in all ye have that he might fro the Castle of Corf and came
unto sir Roger Mortymer and took him the letter that sir Edmond of wodstok earl
of Kent had taken him closyd and ensealed with his own seal / And when sir
Roger Mortymer had received the letter / he unclosed it / and saw that was
contained therein / and began it to read. whereof the beginning was this.
Worshyppes and reverence with brother alyegaunce and subieccyon / sir knyt
worshypfull and dear brother ^ if it you please I pray you hertely that ye be
in good co^forthe / for I shall so ordeyn for you yt ye shall come out of
pryso^ and be delivered of that dysese that ye ben in / and vnderstondyth of
your great lordshyp / that I have to mine assenting all most all the great
lords of England with all their apperyll / that is to say with armor with
tresour without nombre / for to mayntene your quarrel so ferforth / that ye
shall be king again as ye were before / and that they have sworn to me upon a
book / and as well prelates as earls and barons. When sir Roger Mortymer saw and
understood / the might and the strenth of the letter anon his heart for wrath
began to boll and evil heart bare to ward sir Edmo^de of wodstok that was earl
of kent. and with all the have that he might / he went unto dame Isabell the
queen / that was ye was the kings mother / and showed her sir Edmonds letter /
his will and his purpose and how that he had coniected and ordained to put
down king Edward of wyndsore her sone. of his ryalte and of his kingdom /
Now certes sir Roger said she has sir Edmonde done so now by my faders soul
said she / I will be thereof avenged / if that god grant me life / and that in
a short time. And with that queen Isabell went unto king Edward her sone /
there he was at the parlemente at wynchestre. to have amend the wrongys and
the trespasses that were done among the people of his reame / and tho she took
and showed him the letter that sir Edmond of wodstok had made / and ensealed
with his own seal and badde him upon her blessing. that he should be auengyd
upon sir edmond as upon his dedely enmye. Tho was the queen sore wroth to
ward sir Edmonde earl of Kente. And sessyd never to pray until her sone /
till that he had sent in all the have after him. And upon that the king sent
by his letters after sir Edmoode of wodstok / that he should come and speak
with him at wynchestre all manner thing left. And when sir edmond saw that
the king sent after him with his letters ensealed / ye hastyd him in all yt
he might tylle that he came to wynchestre. But when the queen wist that sir
Edmonde was come to wynchestre tho anon she prayed and so fast wend unto
king edward her sone / that the good earl was arested anon / and ladde unto
the bar before Robert of Hamonde that was Coroner of the kings household.
And he assocyed unto him sir Roger Mortymer. And tho spoke the for said Roger
and said sir edmonde earl of Kent / ye shall understood that it is done us to
wit / and pryncypally unto our lyege lord the king edward of england
almighty god him save and keep / that ye be his deedly enmye / and a traytoure
/ and also a comune enmye to the reame and that ye have been about many a day.
For to make pryue delyueraunce of sir edward sometime king of england your
brother / the which sometime was put down of his ryaltee by ye common assent of
the lords of england / in peasynge of our lord the kings estate / and also
of his reame. Tho answered the good man and said / For soth sir understand well
that I was never traytoure to my king / ne to the reame / and that I do me on
god / and on all the world / and therefore by my kings leave. I shall it preue
and defend as a man ought for to do. Tho said Mortymer. sir Edmonde. it is so
ferfor the know that it may not be well gaynsayd / and that in presence of all
that here been. it shall be well prouyd. Now had this false mortymer the same
letter that sir edmonde had take to Sir Johan Daueryll in the castle of Corf
for to take to king edward his brother that sir Edmonde wist not of ne
supposed no thing that sir John^ Daueryll had be so falls to deliver his letter
in such wise unto Mortymer. And thought no manner of thing of that letter.
Then Mortymer said to sir edmonde / and showed a letter sealed. and axed him
if that he knew ye letter and ye seal. This sir edmonde lokyd thereon / and
auysed him long time on the prynte of the seal / for he might not see the
letter with in. and wist well that it was his seal / and thought that it had
be sum letter that had bore no great charge / and thought no thing of that
other letter. And said openly in herynge of them all / ye for soth this is my
seal. and I will it not for sake. Lo said the Mortymer / syres ye here al
what he has said / and that he knowlegyth him that this is his letter and his
seal. And now ye shall here what is contained therein / and then Mortymer
opened the letter that he had fold tofore together. and read it openly word
by word in herynge of them all / and when the letter was read / he said /
Loo syres ye have herd all ye herin is wryte^ / and that he has knowlegyth
that this is his letter and his seal. and he may not go therfro / And then
they cried and yaue dome / that he should be hangyd and drawn / and his heed
smyten of in a manner of a traitor and he and his heirs dysheryted for ever
more / and so he was ladde forth and put in to prison. and when this was done.
and the queen wist that he was dampened by way of law / both of life and of
lym^e / and his heirs dysheryted for evermore. through open knowlegynge in
playncourt / where them thought that it were good / that the foresaid sir Edmond
were hastyly slain / without wyttynge of the king / or else the king would
lightly foryeue him his death / and then it shode torn them so much sorrow
/ so as he was empechyd / And anon the queen through counseyll of the Mortymer
/ and with out any other counsel sent in have to the Baylyfe of wynchestre
that they should smite of Sir Edmondes heed Earl of Kente without any manner
abiding or respyte upon pain of life and lymme. And that he should have none
other execusyon / By cause of caryenge not withstanding the Judgment. Tho took
the Baylyes sir edmonde out of prison / and ladde him beside the castle of
wynchestre / and there they made a gonfermer smite of his heed / for none other
durst it do / and so he deyed there / alas the while. That is to say the
tenth day of Octobre / the third year of king Edward regne. And when the
king wist thereof / he was wonder sorry / and let entyere him at the friar
Mynors at wynchestre.

Of the death of sir Roger Mortymer Earl of March.
ANd so it befell at that time that sir Roger Mortymer earl of ye March / was
so proud and so hauteyne that he held no lord of the reame his pere. And tho
became he so coueytous / that he followed dame Isabell the queen's court that
was king Edwards mother and beset his penny worth with the officers of the
queen's house hold in the same manner that the kings officers did. And so he
made his taking / as touching of vytayle and also of caryages / and all he
did for because of expencys / and to gadre tresoure / And so he did without
nombre in all that he might. Tho had he made him wonder preuy with the queen
Isabell / And so much lordshyppe and rete we had / that all the great lords
of England of him were adrad wherefore the king and his counseylle / to ward
him were agreued / And ordained among them to undo him thoroughe pure reason
and law for cause that king Edward that was ye ky^ges fader traytoursly
through him was murdered in the castle of Corf as before is said more plainly in
some part of his book / of his death. And some that were of the kings
counseyll louyd Mortymer / and told him in preuyte / how that ye king and
counsel were about from day to day / him for to dystroye and undo wherefore
Mortymer was sore anoyed and angry as the devil against them of the kings
counseyll / and say he would of them be avenged / how so ever he took on. It
was not long afterward / that king Edward and dame Phylyp his wife / and dame
Isabell the kings mother. and sir Roger Mortymer / ne went unto Notyngham
there for to soiurne / And so it befell that queen Isabel through counsel of
Mortymer / took to her the keys of the yates of the castle of Notyngham. So
that no man might come another in ne out but through commandment of Mortymer /
ne the king / ne none his cou^seylle. And that time it fell. that the Mortymer
as a devil for wrath bolled / and also for wrath that he had against the
kings men Edward / and pryncypally against them that had him accusyd to the
king / of the death of sir Edward his fader. And pryuely a counsel was take
between queen Isabell and the Mortymer and the bishop of Lyncoln and sire
Symo^de of Bedford / and sir Hugh of Trompyngton / and other preuy of their
counseyll / for to undo them all that the Mortymer had accusyd unto the king
of his faders death / of treason and of felonye. Wherefore all tho that were of
the kings counsel / when they wist of the Mortymers casting: pryuely came
to king Edward and said / that Mortymer would them dystroye / because that
they had him accusyd of king Edwardes death. his fader \ And prayed him that
he would mayntene them in their right. And these were the lords that pursued
this quarrel / Sir wyllyam of Mountagu / sir wyllyam de Bohum / Sir wyllyam his
brother / sir Rauf Stafforde / sir Robert of Herforde / sir wyllyam of Clynton /
sir Johan Neuell of Hornby and many other of their consent. And all these swore
upon a book to mayntene the quarrel / in as much as they might. And it befell
so after^ that sir wyllyam Mountagu ne none of the kings friends must not be
herberowed in the castle for the Mortyme^ but went and took their herberowe in
diverse place of the twone of Nothyngham. And tho were they sore a ferde /
leest that mortymer should them dystroye. And in haste they came unto king
Edward sir wyllyam of Mauntagu and other that were in the castle. And pryuely
him told / that he ne none of his company. should not take the Mortymer.
without counseyll and help of wyllyam of Elande. constable of the same
castle. Now truly said the king I love you well^ and therefore I counseyl
you that ye go to the foresaid conestable / and commau^de him in my name / that
he be your friend and your help / for to take the mortymer / al thing yleft
upon peril of life and lym^e. Tho said Mountagu Sir my lord grant mercy Tho
went forth the foresaid Mountagu / and came to the Conestable of the castle /
and told him the kings will. And he answerde and sayde^ The kings will
should be done in as much as he might. and that he would not spare for no
manner of death / And that he swore and made his oath. Tho said sir wyllyam of
Mou^tagu to the constable / in herynge of them all. that were helping to the
same quarrel. Now certes dear friend / us behouyth to work and do by your
aduys for to take the Mortymer / sith that ye be keeper of the castle. and has
the keys in your ward. Sir said the Constable / will ye understand / that
the castle yates ben lockyd with the keys that dame Isabell sent hither. and
by night she has the keys there of and lays them under the lursell of the
bed unto the morrow. and so ye may not come in to the castle by the yates /
by no manner of wise / But I know an aleye that stretchythoute of the ward
under the earth in to the for said castle / that gothe in to the weste.
which aleye dame Isabel the queen / ne none of her men ne the Mortymer / ne
none of his company knowith it not. And so I shall led you through ye aley /
and so ye shall come in to the castle without aspyenge of any man yt are your
enmyes. And the same nyghe sir wyllyam Mountagu / and all the lords of his
quarrel / and the same Constable also went them to horse / and made semblau^t
as it were for to go out of Mortymers sight But anon as Mortymer hard this
tidings / he wend yt they would have gone over see for fere of him. And anon
right he and his company took a counsel among them for to let their
passage / and snetelletters anon to the porters so that none of the great
lords should go home to their owned countries / but if they were arested and
take. And among other things wyllyam Elande Conestable of the for said
castle. pryuely ladde sire wyllyam of Mountagu and his company by the for said
way under the earth / till they came in to the castle and went up in to the
toure that Mortymer was in. But sir Hughe of Trompynton them ascryed hydously
and said a traitors it is all for naught. that ye ben common in to this castle
ye shall deye yet an evil death euerychone. And anon one of them that was in
Mountages company up with a mace / and smote the same Hugh upon the heed / that
the brain braste out and fell on the ground / and so was he deed of an evil
death. Tho took they mortymer as he armyd him at the toures door / when he herd
the noise of them for dread. And when the queen Isablell saw that the
Mortymer was taken she made much sorrow in heart / and these words unto them
she said / Now fair syres / I pray you that ye do no harm to his body a
thy knight our well-beloved friend and our dear cosyn. Tho went they thens / and
came and brought Mortymer / and presentyd him unto king Edward / and he
commanded to bring him in save ward. But anon as they that were consenting
unto mortymers doing / herd tell that he was taken they went and hid them
/ and pryuely by night went out of the town each one his way / with heavy
heart and morning chere and lived upon their lands as well as they might.
And that same year that Mortymer was take. He had.ix. score knights without
quyres and sergau^tes of armies / and footmen / And then^e was mortymer ladde
to London / and sir Edmonde of Bedforde was ladde with him / and was taken to
ye constable of the toure to keep. But after ward was the Mortymers life
examyned at westmestre before the king / and before all the geate lords of
England / for peril that might fall to the reame / And to enquer^ also
which were consenting to sir Edwardes death the kings fader / and also
through whom the Scotts escaped fro Stanhope in scotlonde / without leave of
king Edward. And also how ye chartre of ragman was delivered unto the Scotts
them the homages and feautees of the lords of Scotlo^de were contained that
the Scotts should do ever more to the English king for the reame of
Scotlond / wherefore he was Iugyd to be drawn and hangyd for his treason / And
this myscheyf came unto him on saint Andrews even. In the year of the
Incarnacyon of our lord Ihesu christ.M.CCC.xxx.

How king Edward gate again unto him gracyously the homages and feautees of
Scotlonde / whereof he was put out thrughe ye false counseyll of the queen
Isabell his mother and sire Roger Mortymer. that was newely made Earl of Match.
NOw have ye herd how Johan Bayllol in the time of peace was chosen to be king
of Scotlonde for cause that he came of the eldest daughter of the Earl Dauyd of
Huntyngton / that was king Alysanders brother of Scotlond / that deyed without
heir of his body begoten / And how this Johan made his feaute and homage to
king Edward / Henryes sone the third. for his lands of Scotlonde / And how
he afterward with said his homage / through counseyll of the Scotts / in the
year of our lord ^M.CC.lxxiiii. and sent unto the pope through. a falls
suggestyo^ that he made his oath unto the foresaid king Edward over his estate
and his will / of the which oath the pope him assoyled thrughe his bullys to
him ysent. And anon as king Edward wist thereof / he ordeyne anon his barons
and came unto Berwyk / and conquered the town. at the which conquest there
were slain.xxv. thousand and.vii. hundred. and Bayllol that was king of
Scotlond came and yeldyd him to good king Edward / and ye king delivered him
out of the toure of London. and all the great lords with him yt tho were taken
at Berwyk and yaue them saufconduyte / to goo into Scotlonde. And the Scotts
sithe through their falsnesse / warred upon the good king Edward. And when sir
Johan Bayloll king of Scotlonde saw all this / he went over see unto Dunpier
and lived there upon his lands as well as he might. till that ye Scotts would
amend them of their mysdedys and trespaas / and ladde with him sir Edward
his sone. wherefore the Scotts in dyspyte of him called him sir Johan
Turnlabard / for because that he would not ne offend ne trespaas against the
good king Edward of England. And so he for soke his reame of Scotlonde /
and set thereof but little price. And this sir Johan dwelled long time in
France / till that he deyed there and sir Edward his sone received his
heritage / and did homage to the king of France / for his lands of Dunpier
/ And so it befell afterward / that Edward that was Johan Bayllols sone / had
with him a squyre of England yt was in york shyre / that was called Johan of
Barnaby / and this Edward Bayllol louyd him much / and was nyghe him / and
full preuy. And so this John^ of Barnaby was in debate with a French man in
the town of Dunpier / and so he slew him and went his way in all the haste
that he might in to the castle. For to have socoure and help of his lord.
And anon came officers of the town. to take John^ of Barnaby as a felon. and
sir Edward his lord help him / and rescowed him / and by night made him go
out of the castle / and so he went his way and came in to England without
any harm. And when the king of france saw that sir Edward had rescowed his
felon. He became wonder wroth against sir Edward. and anon let him arestyd
and took into his hondes all his lands. Tho dwelled sir ^ Edward in prison /
unto the time that sir Henry of Beaumount came into france / the which Henry
sometime was earl of Anguysshe in Scotlonde and was put out thereof when
chacordement was between England and Scotlond through the queen Isabell and sir
Roger Mortymer and their company for ye moryage that she made between Dauyd /
that was Roberte Brus sone and dame Iohanne of Tour king Edwards sister of
England / and well understand this / that at the end he should come to his
right / but if it were sire Edward Baylloll / that was right heir of the
reame of Scotlonde. And the king of france Lowys louyd much this sir Henry.
And he was with him full preuy / and thought for to make a delyueraunce of sir
Edward Baylloll / if he might in any manner of wise. Tho prayed he the king
that he would of his grace gau^t him sire Edward Bayllols body / unto the
next parliament. that he might live with his own rentes in the mean time /
and that he might stand to be Iugyd with his perys at the parliament. And the
king grauntyd him his prayer / and made the forsayde Edward to be delivered
out of prison / in the manner above said And anon as he was out of prison sir
Henry took him forth with him and ladde him in to england / and made him
dwell pryuely at the manner of Sandhall upon Ouse in york shyre with the
lady Vescy. And so he ordained him there an huge retenewe of Englysshmen and
also of alyuntes / for to conquer again his heritage / and so he yaue much
silver unto ye souldyours and alyauntes for to help him ^ And they behyght for
to help him in that they might / but they faylled him at his most need. And
at that time Dauyd earl of Moryf herd tell how that sir Edward Bayloll was
pryuely come into england. And came to him and made with him gerte Joy of his
coming and said unto him and behyght him that all the great lords of
England / should be to him entendaunte / and should him hold for king as
right heir of Scotlo^de / and did to him feaute^ Tho came sir Henry of
Beaumonte to king edward of England. And prayed him in the way of charity /
that he would grant of his great unto sir Edward Baylloll that he might
sau^ly goo by land from Sandhall / unto Scotlonde / to conquer his right and
herytaunce in Scotlond. The king answerde and said / if that I suffer
Bayllol. go through my land in to Scotlonde. then the people would say / yt
I should be assenting unto the company. Now sir I pray you yt ye would give
him leave to take with him souldyours of Englysshmen that they might saufly led
him through your land to Scotlonde / And sir vpno this couenaunte that if it so
befall / as god it for bydde that he dyscomfyted in bytayll through the Scotts
/ that I and also all the lords that hold with Bayllol / ben for ever more out
of our rentes that we have in england. And there the king upon this
couenaunte / grauntyd their bone / as towchynge him / and tho that were of the
same quarrel the which claymed for to have lands and rentes in the reame of
England And these were the names of tho lords that pursued this for said
matere and quarrel. That is to say / sir Edward Bayllol / the which
chalengyd the reame of Scotlonde. sir Henry Beaumonte earl of Angusshe / sir
Dauyd of Stroboly earl of a theles / sir Geffray of Mombraye / walter Common and
many other that were put out of their heritage in Sctlonde when the peace was
made between England and Scotlonde as before is said / And ye shall
understand that these lords took with them five houndred men of arms. and
two thousand Archers and of footmen. and tho went in to ship at Raven.
pore / and sailed by the sea / tylle that they came unto Scotlond. and came to
land at Kynkehorne.xii. mile fro saint Johannes town / And anon sent out
there ships again / for that they should not be hurt / ne empeyred / neither
taht no man should go in to the ships again though that they had need / but
abybe all perils and not flee but stand / and rather suffer death than flee
for to mayntene their true quarrel. when the earl of Fyffe. a fyers man and a
stern / hard that Bayllol was come / for to taste the land of Scotlond / he
came in have to Kynke horn / with ^iii. thousand Scotts / for to dystroye him
/ that he should not come to land / But sir Edward Bayllol and his company
there him dyscomfyted / at the which dyscomfyture sir Alysa^der Seton was
there slain / and many other. The Earl of Fyffe / was the sore and full evil
ashamyd / that so little a company had him dyscomfyted / and shamefully put him
and all his company that were alive for to flee. Tho came sir Edward Bayllol
and took the coo^ tree all about him. till he came unto the abbay of
Du^fermlin. and there he found vytaylles for him and for his folk / and among
all other thing he found in a chamber about five houndred of great staves of
^ fine oak with long prykes of yren. and of stele And he took them and
delyuerd them to the most stro^gest men of his company. And anon after he
yede fro thens. And lodged him in a field.ii. miles from saint Ioha^nes town.
And when the burgeys of the town herd how the earl of Fyffe was dyscomfyted
thrughe Baylloll. brake ye brydges that they had made over the water of Erne.
so that Bayllol might not go over / wherefore he lodged him there all that night
/ but little head he took of rest. and said unto his people / Now dear lords
ye know full well. that been now lodged between our enmyes / and they may us
hampre / there is no bote but death. wherefore if we abide stylle all this
nyght^ I wene it shall torn us to much harm. For the power of Scotlonde may
every wexe and encrece and we may not so do. And we ben but lytylle people
ayenste them wherefore I pray you for the love of almighty god make we us
bold and hardy and that we may myghtely take the Scotts this night / and
boldly werre upon them. and let us pursue them this night. And if they be
trauaylled thorugh us. and see our hardynesse. other Scotts that see them so
traueylled and wery^ the sorer woll they be adradde with us to fight and
fyersly then shall we fight with them. And on them pursue. So that thrughe
the grace of god / all the world shall speak of the doughtynes of our
chyualry. And syres understands well that all the company that came with sir
Robert Baylloll / granted well unto that counseyll / and were thereof right
glad. and anon pursued upon the Scotts. that they became wonder weary. And
Baylloll and his company sore followed them / and did them much harm and
sorrow / through there assente. so that thy might not for feblynesse them help
and for lytyl people. But tho said the Scotts among them / what is now
befall that so little a people as Baylloll has in wynge does us so much
traueyll and sorrow Now certes it semyth us that he werketh by grace / for he
is wonder gracyous in his quarrel and we certes shall be deed or that we may
come to him us for to yield Since that his fader sete of us no price. And among
all his other things Baylloll and his people passed the water of Erne so that
Robert Swynerton the sone was fyers and angrye / and went forth and they saw
people of armies full well arrayed. and forth they went unto them and with them
faught And slew and took as many as would abide: And nevertheless at that
assewte they wend it had be the great host of Scotlond. And when it came to
the morrow. they gadred them together / and restyd them a whyle^ And while the
Englysshemen rested them / the noble baron Thomas Vescy / and the noble baron /
Stafforde / pryckyd their horse up and down by the hills / for to keep the
estrees of the country / and as they pryckyd up and down. they saw a great
host of good array ordained in their wynge with helmes and sheldes shynynge
coming upon them. and then^e came tho two barons again unto Bayllols folk /
and said. Now for the love of god almighty be of good co^forth for ye shall
have battle an one right. And tho spoke sir fouk the sone of Garenne^ a baran
of great renown and of dedys of armies / Syres understand what I will say /
I have seen many diverse wings / as well among sarasyns and Jews / as among
the Scotts / and yet saw I never the fourth part of the wynge fight. and
therefore if ye will abide our enmyes / we ben enough for them. but if we be not
of good heart and of good courage we been but lost. And therefore for the love
of god. take to us good heart / and let us be bold / ad think we never of
our wives ne of our children / but only to co^quere our enmyes in battle. And
through the help of our lord we shall them overcome And with that came the
host of the Scotts to ward them full serely / and against sir Edward
Baylloll in three bataylles well arrayed in armoure. And wonder fyersly they came
to ward the Bayllols company / But when sir Donald earl of Marcell that was
with the Scotts / saw all this / he said unto Roberte Brus the sone of Robert
the Brus these words / Sir Robert said he full fore me for thynkyth at my
heart / that these people that Baylloll has brought with him should deye with
dy^te of Scotts swerdes / sithe that they ben christian men as we ben. And
therefore me thynkyth that it were great charity for to send unto them / for
to yield them / unto our mercy / and raunsomme them unto grievous raunsomme /
for as much as they have taken our lands and done ill. Now certes said sir
Roberte the Brus / I have well rerceyued / that thou art an enmye and a
traitor unto Scotlonde / sithe that thou will consent to save our dedely
enmyes / that have done us much sorrow and shame and now it semyth well that ye
be of their assente Now certes Robert said sir donald / falsely ye lie. I am
not of their company ne of their consent / and yt hastyly ye shall se for I
will fyz^e with them rather than any of this company / and certes sir Robert
said he I shall in mauger of thy head assayll they or thou And with yt they
pryckyd their stedys fye^sly upon Gaskemore. and their wynge them followed on a
reng. and tho came they and met with Baylloll and his company at an hanging
bough of the more i^ a strayte passage and so fast they hastyd the^ unto ye
Englysshmen ye thousand / fell unto the ground echone over upon other into an
hepe horse and man bayllol and his men myghtyly stood against them / and fast
slew the Scotts to the ground / and many they wounded / so long / till
that they stood upon them and foyned them with their swerdes and speres
thrughe their bodies / and fulle sore they were trauaylled upon them / tylle
that they became wonder weary / and wyste not what for too do. And the Scotts
that were let alive fled away / for to save them self in the best manner
that they might. And tho pursued them sire Edward baylloll and his men / and
slew of them till it was night. And fro the^s they went to Saint Johannes
town / and took it. and held them there and vytaylled them self at there own
will / for they found enough wherewith to make merry. Tho made Baylloll his men
yt were wonded goo to ship / to sayll in to England / to hele there wounds.
and in ye time there was a fle^mynge in the sea. a stonge theyf And a robber
that was called crab and this fle^mi^ge was driven out of Flaundres for his
wyckydnesse and therefore he came into Scotlond to hold with the scotts / and
did as much harm to the Englysshmen as he might do. And this Crabbe met
Bayllols men in ye see that were wounded before in battle yt were sent again
into England. for to hele their wounds. and this crabbe yaaf to them a get
assawte. and would have slain them every chone. But the Englysshmen defended
them well and manly and dyscomfyte Crabbe and his company and tho began he fle
into Scotlond. And as he came toward saint Ioha^nes town / he found a great
conpany of scotts / yt were come again together after the dyscomfyture at
Gaskemore. the which byseyged Bayllol and his men i^ the same town of saint
Iohan^ And anon told told the Scotts how that he was dyscomfyted of the
Englysshmen / yt were woundyd at Gaskemore / that went toward England / forts
hele their wounds / And said to the Scotts / yt they should have another power
ne might ne grace against Edward Bayllol / by cause that he scomfyted / and
empeyred all the chyualry of Scotlond with a handfall of men as to ^o^pte
against the Scotts that were slain. wherefore he cou^seylled to remeue the sege
from saint Johannes town / and keep them in the best manner that they might.
The Scotts understood that crabbe said sothe / for soke the sege and went
thens by night. when this thing was know thrughe Scotlonde how that the
lords and knights were dyscomfyted at Gaskemore of Scotlonde thrughe sire
Edward Bayllol / ye shall understand yt the lords and ladies / and the
gentyls of Scotlond came wonder fast to saint Johannes town / and yeldyd
them unto Bayllol. and to him did homage and feaute for their sondes and yield
them to his peace and he them received freely / And fro thens he went to the
abbay of Scone. and there he was crowned king of Scotlond / and after he let
cry his peace thrughe out all the land. And at that same time it befell that
king Edward held his parliament among his leyges at the new castle upon
Tyne for to amend the trespaces and the wrongs that had been done in his
land. And sir Edward Bayllol king of Scotlonde came to him thither / and
did to him homage and feautee / for the reame of Scotlond And in this manner
king Edward of England gadred again his homages and feautees of Scotlonde /
where of he was put out / thrughe counseyll and assent of dame Isabell his mother
/ and of sir Roger Mortymer earl of March / Tho took Bayllol king of Scotlond
his leave of king Edward of England / and went thens in to his own land of
Scotlonde and set but little by such as had counseylled him / and helped him
in his quarrel / wherefore they went from him and went and lived by their own
lands and renttes in Scotlond. And so it befell after ward not long / that
that the king of Scotlonde ne remeued and came to the toure of Anande and
there took his dwelling / and thither came to him a company of knights
strong men and worthy / and yielded them unto the king. And bare them so fair
in deed and in cou^tenau^ce / so that he trustyd much upon them And anon as
the traitors saw that he trustyd much upon them / they ordened among them
fyfty in a company / and would have slain their lord the king / But through
the grace of almighty god / he brake through a wall an hole in his chamber /
and as god would scapyd their treachery / and all his men were slain / and he
escaped with much dred unto the town of Cardoyll / And there he held him
sore anoyed. And this befell upon our ladies even ye co^cepcyon. Tho sent king
Edward Baylloll to king Edward of. England / how falsely and tratoursly he
was in little time / put to shame and sorrow thrughe his lyege men / upon whom
he trustyd wonder much. And prayed him for ye love of god that he would
mayntene him and help him against his enmyes. the king of england had of him
great pity / and behight to help him and socour him. and sent him word that
he should hold him in peace still in ye forsayde cite of Cardoyll / till yt he
had gadred his power. Tho ordained king Edward of England a counseyll at
London / and let gadre his men in diverse shyres of England. and when he was
all ready / he went toward the town of Berwyk upon Twede / and theder came
to him king Edward Baylloll of scotlond with his powere / and beseged the town
/ And made without the town a fair town of pauylyons and dyched them all
abowte / so that they had no dread of the* Scotts / and made many assawte
with ^onnes and with other engynnes to ye town. wherwyth they dystroyed many
fair houses / and chyrches also were beten down to ye earth with great stones
/ the spitously came out of gonnes and other engynes. And nevertheless ye
Scotts kept right well the town / yt tho two kings might not come therein
long time. and n^theles the kings abode there so long / till tho that were
within ye town failed vytaylles and also they were so weary of waking. that
they wist not what for to do. And ye shall vnderstende that tho scotts yt were
within ye town of Berwyk / through common counseyl and their assent. let cry
upon ye wallys of the twone. that they might have peace of the Englysshme^ and
thereof they prayed the king of his grace and mercy and prayed gym of trwes
for.viii. days upon this couenaunte / yt if they were not rescowed in that
side of the town toward Scotlond of ye Scotts within.viii. days yt they
would yield them unto ye king and the town also / And to hold this covenant
/ they prouffred to the king.xii. hostages out of the town of Berwyk. When
the hostages were delyuerde / unto ye king / anon tho of the town sent unto
ye scotts / and told them of their sorrow and myscheyf / And the Scotts tho
came pryuely over the water of Twede to ye bought of the abbaye. and sir
wyllya^ Dyket that was tho Steward of scotlonde. and many other that came with
him / put them their in great peril of themself at that time and of there life
/ For they came over a bridge yt was to broke and ye stones away / and many of
their company were there drowned / But the foresaid wyllyam went over / and
other of company / and came by the ships of England / and slew in a barge of
Hull.xvi^ me^ and after they went into the town of Berwyk by the water side /
wherefore the Scotts held tho the town rescowed / and asked their hostages
again of the king of England / and the king sent them word aye^ that they
axyd their hostages with wrong sith thath they came into the town of Enlonde
side / for covenant was between them that the town should be rescowed by the
half of Scotlonde and anon tho commanded king Edward to yield the town /
or he would have the hostages and the Scotts said the town was rescowed well
enough and thereto they would them hold / when king Edward saw the Scotts
break their couenauntes that they made / he was wonder wroth. and anon let
sir Thomas. Fytz wyllyam and sir Alysa^der of Feton warden of Berewyk the
which Thomas was person of Dunbarre. and let the^ be take first before that
other hostages for cause that Sir Alysanders fader was keeper of the town. And
tho commanded every day two hostages of the town / till that they were all
do to death. But if they yielded the town / and so he should teache them for to
break their couenauntes. And when they of the town herd these tidings they
became wonder sorry and sent to the king that he would grant them other.viii.
days of respyte. So that between two hundre men of armies and.xx. men of arms
might by strenthe go between them to ye town of Berwyk them for to vytaylle /
that the town must be hold for rescowed. And if so were that.xxi. or.xxii.
or more were slain of tho two hundred before said. that the towsholde not be
hold for rescowed. And this couenaunte to be hold. they sent to him
other.xii. of the foresaid town in hostage / the king of England grauntyd
them their prayer and took the hostages. on saint Margaretes eve. in the year
of grace.M^CCC.xxxiii. the Scotts came fyersly well arrayed in four wings for
to mete king Edward of England. and Edward the king of Scotlonde / with
their power / and came fast and sharply against euensonge time / And the same
time was flood at Berwyk in the water of Twede / that no man might goo over
on his horse / nor on foot ^ and the water was between tho two kings and ye
reame of England. And that time abode the Scotts in that other side for cause
that the englyssgmen should have be drowned.

fight on foot against the Scotts their enmyes. And the Englys the mynstrels
blewe their trumpetes and the. yr claryons / and hydously ascryed the Scotts.
And tho had every English battle two wings of price archers. The which at
that battle shot arowes so fast and so sore: that the Scotts might not
help themsefle. And they smote the Scotts thousands unto the ground. And
they began for to flee fro the englysshmen for to save their lives: And when
the Scotts knaves saw the scomfyture and the Scotts fall fast to the ground

pages took the pylfre of the Scotts that were slain / every man that he might
take. without any chalengynge of any man. And so after this gracyous victory.
the king turned him again unto the same syege of Berewyk. And when they be
syeged saw and herd how king Edward had speed / they yielded to him the
town with the castle / on the morrow after saint Margaretes day. And then
the king did ordeyne sir Edward Baylloll / with other noble and worshypfull

which clerks call stella Cometa and that sterre was seen in diverse parts of
ye fyrmament. Where after anon there followed in England good chepe and

How king Edward made a duchye of the Erldome of Cornewayle and also of six
other Earls that were new made / and of the first challenge of ye kyngdodome

ye.xiiii. year of his regne when all ye lords of his reame and other that
oughten to be at his parliament were called and assembled together in ye same
parliament holden at London after the feast of saint Hylarye / The kings needs
were put forth and promothed as touching the kingdom of France. For which

England and the wulles and the.ix. sheep of every corn / And all the lords
of every town where such things should be taxed and gadryd should answer to
the king thereof / and had it and held it at his own lust and will wherefore if
I should knowleche the very troth / the ynner love of the people was turned in
to hate And the common prayers in to cursinge / for cause that the comune people
were so strongely grieved. Also the for said Phylyp Valoys of France had
gadred unto him a great host and destroyed in his parties and kingdom / many
of the kings friends of England with towns and castles many other of their
lordhypoes and many harms shamys and dystytes did unto the queen / where fore

neded to have / he went over see again. Of whose cominge ye queen and all his
friends were wonder glad and made much Joy And all that were his enmyes and
held against him made as much sorrow. In the same time the king thrughe
counseyll of his true lyeges and counsel of his lords that there we
represent with him write the kynhe of Frau^ces name / and took and meddled the
kings arms of France quartred with tharmes of England and commanded forth

How king Edward came unto the scuys and dyscomfyted all the power of
France in the haven.
ANd in the next year after / that is to say the.xv. year of his regne he
commanded and let write in his chartres wryttes and other letters the date of
the regne of france the first And while that he was thus doing and
trauayllynge in france thrughe his counseyll he wrote to all the prelates dukes
earls and barons and the noble lords of the country / and also to diverse of
the comune people diverse letters and maundementes berynge date at Gandaue the
viii. day of February. And anon after within a little time he came again in to
england with the queen and her children. And in the same year on mydsomer even
he began to saylle to ward France again / and manly and fyersly he fell upon
Phylyp of Valoys the which long time lay and had gadryd to him a full long
and boystous meny of diverse nations in the haven of Sceuys / and there they
foughten together the king of france and he with their hosts fro myddaye to
three of the clock in the morn / in the which battle were slain.xxx.
thousand men of the kings company of france / and many ships and cogges
were taken And so through gods help he had there the vyctorye. and bear
thens a glorious chyualry And in the same year abowte saint James tide without

his regne following in the winter time the king stylle upon the foresaid seyge
and sent of time into england unto his tresorer and other purueyours for gold
and money that should be se^te unto hy^ there i^ his need but his proctours
and messyngers cursedly and full slouly served him at his need and deceived him
/ on whoos defaute and latches the king took trewes between him and the king
of france / And then king Edward full of shame and sorrow in his heart
with drew him fro the sege and come into Brytayne and there was so great
strive of battle that he lost many of his people. And when he had done there
that he come for he dressyd him over see in to England ward. And as he saylled
to ward England in the high see the most myshappes storms and tempests
thondre and lyghtnynge fell to him in ye see / the which was said that it
was done and yraysyd through evil spirytes made by sore ery and nygro mancye of
them of france / wherefore the kings heart was full of sorrow / and a^guysshe
welllynge and syghynge and said unto our lady in this wyse^ O blessed lady
Saint Mary what is the cause that ever more going into france al things and
wethers fallen to me Joyful and liking and as I would have them / but always
tornynge into England ward all things fallen unprofitable and very harmfull
nevertheless he scapyd all perelles of the sea as god would / and came to the
tour of London by night. And the same year the king held his Crystmas at
Meneres and sent word to the Scotts by his messagers that he was ready and
would do fight with them. but the Scotts would not abide that but fled
over ye Scotts see and hyd them a well as they might. And in the.xvii. year of
his regne about the feast of the Co^uersyon of saint poull king Edward when
he had been in Scotlond and saw that ye scotts were fled tho he come again
into England. And a little before lent was the turnement at Dunstable / tho the
which tourmente come all the young bachelary and chyualry of England with
many other earls and lords. At the which turnemente king Edward himself was
there present And ye next year following in the.xviii. year of his regne at his
parlemente holden at westmynster the auyzeme of paske king Edward the third
made Edward his first sone prince of walys. And in the.xix. year of his regne
anon after in Ianyuer before lent the same king Edward let make full noble
Iustes and great feestes in the place of his birth at wyndsore that there was
never none such seen there before. At which feast and ryalte were two kings
and two queen's the prince of walys the duke of Cornewayle.x. Earls.ix.
Countesses barons and many burgeys the which might not lightly be no^bred /
and of diverse lands beyond the sea weren many strangers. And at the same
time when the Iustes were done. king Edward made a great souper in ye which
he ordened and began his round table and ordened and stedfasted the day of
the round table to be holden there at wyndesore in the wytsone weke never
more yearly. and this time Englyssh men so much haunted and cleuyd to the
woodnes and folly of the strangers / that from time of coming of
Henaudes.xviii. year passed they ordained and changed them every year diverse
shappes and dysguysynge of clothing of long large and wide clothes dystytute
and dyserte frem all old honest and good usage. And an other time short
clothes and strayte wastyd gagged and kyt and on every side slatered and
botoned with sleues and tapytis of surcotes and hodes over long and ouermoche
hanging / that if I the sothe shall say they were more like to tormentours
and deuyls in their clothing and shokynge and other array than to men and the
wymen more nycely yet passed the men in array and euouslyer / for they were so
strayte clothed that they lefe hang fore tails sewyd byneth within there
clothes for to feel and hyde their arsers / the which dysguysynges and pride
parauenture / afterward brought fourth and caused many myshappes and
myschyef in ye reame of England. The.x^. year of king Edward he went over

cauelacyons and dysquatter

How king Edward saylled in to Normandy and arrived at hogs with a great
host.
IN the.xxi. year of his regne king Edward through counseyll of all the great
lords of England called and gadred together in his parlemente at westmestre
before Ester ordained him for to pass over the sea again for to disease and
dystrobled the rebels of France. And when his Nauye was come together and
made ready he went with a great host the.xii. day of Iulii. and saylled in to
Normandye and arrived at hogs. And when he had rested him there.vi. days for
by cause of trauaylyng of the sea and for to have out all his men with all
their necessaryes out of their ships / he went toward Cadomun brenuynge
wastinge and destroyenge all the towns that he found in his way. And
the.xxvi. days of July at the bridge of Cadony manly and nobly stre^gthed and
defended with Normans he had there a strong battle and a long during /
through which a great multitude of people were slain / And there were taken of
prisoners the earl of Ewe / the lord of Thonkeruyll / and an hundred of other
knights and men of arms / and.vi. hundred of foot men nombred and the town
and the subbarbes / unto the bare wall / and of all things that they might
bear and caryen out was robbyd and dyspoyled. After the king passed forth by
ye country about the bread of.xx. mile he wastyd all manner thing yt he found
when Phylyp of Valoys perceived this / all thought he were fast by him with a
strong host yet he would not come nygh him but break all the brydges beyond
ye water of Seyn fro Royn to Paris / and himself fled unto the same cite of
Paris with all the have that he might. For sothe noble king Edward when he
came to Paris bridge and found it broken / within two days he let make it
again / And in the morrow after the Assumpco^n of our lady king Edward
passed over ye water of Seyn goyege to ward Crescy and dystroyed by the way
towns with the people dwelling there in / and in the feast of saint
Bartholomewe he passed over the water of so^me unhurt with all his host there
as never before fond any manner way ne passage. where.ii.M. were slain of
them that let their passage. over. Therefore the.xxvi. day of Auguste /
king Edward in field fast by Frescy having three batayls of Englysshmen en
cou^tred and met with Phylyp of Valoys haui^ge with him.iiii. batayls of
which the leest passed greatly the nombre of english people. And when these
two hosts met together / there fell upon him the kyngh of Beme / the duke of
Loreyn. and earls also of Flaunders / Dalau^son / bloys harecourt / Aumarle and
Neuors / and many other Earls barons lords and knights and men of arms ye
nombre of a.M.v.C.xlii. without foot men and other men armed that were no
thing rekened. And for all this the vngloryous Philyp with drew him with the
resydue of his people. wherefore it was said in common among his own people.
Nere^ be all soy retreyt. that is to say our fair with draws him. Than
king Edward and our Englysshme^ thankyd almighty god for such a vyctory after
there great labor take to them all thing needful to their sustynaunce / and
saving of their lives and for dread of their enmyes rested them there. And
full erly in the morning after ye Frensshmen with a great passing host come
again for to give battle and fight with the Englysshmen / with whom met and
encountered the earl of warwyke Northampton and Norfolk with their company and
slew.ii. M. and took many prisoners of the gentyls of them. And the remenaunt
of ye same host fled three mile thens. And the third day after ye battle ye
king went to Calays ward destroyenge all ye towns as he rode thither / wha^
that he come^ that is to say ye third day of Septe^bre he began to besege ye
town with ye castle and continued his sege fro the foresaid third day of
Septembre to ye third day of August ye next year after. And in the same year
during ye syege of Calays the king of Scotlo^de with a great multitude of
scotts came in to England to Neuyles cross / about saint Lucas day the
Eua^gelyst hoping and trusting for to have found all ye land void of
people for as much as the king of England was beyond the sea / sauf oonly
prestes and men of holy church and women and children / and plowmen and such
other laborers / and there they come and robbyd and did much preuy sorrow.
But yet found they enough that them withstode by ye grace of almighty god /
and so a day of battle was as sygned between them and certain lords and me^
of holy church yt were of ye country with other comune people fast by the
cite of Duresme. at which day through the grace and help of god almighty the
Scotts were ouercomen and yet were there three times so many of the^ as of
englysshemen^ And there was slain all the chyualry and knyghthode of the reame
of Scotlond. And there was taken as they would have fled thens Dauyd of king
of Scotlonde himself and the earl of mentyf Sir wyllyam Douglas and many other
great men of Scotland. And after that our Englysshemen when they had rested
them a few days and had ordained their kepers of the North country. they
came to London and brought with them sire Dauyd the king of Scotlonde and all
the other lords that were taken prisoners unto the toure of London with all
the haste that they might. and left them there in sauf keeping unto the kings
coming and went home again in to their own country. And after ward was the
king raunson of Scotlond taxed to an hundred thousand mark of silver to be
paid within.x. year / that is to say every year.x. thousand mark.

How king Edward besyeged Calays and how it was won and yolden unto him.
IN the.xxii^ year of king Edwardes regne went over see in the winter time /
and lay al ye winter at the sege of Calays / the which year while the syege
lasted and endured Phylyp the king of france cast and purposed traytoursly
and with fraud to put away the syege and came the ^xxvii. day of Iuyll in
the same year with a great host and strong power and neyghed to the sege of
Calays. The which Phylyp the last day of Iulii. sent to the king Edward
word that he would give him plain battle ye third day after ye about
Eue^songe time if he durst come fro the sege and abide. And wha^ king Edward
herd that any without long taryenge or long auysentente accept gladly ye
day and hour of battle yt Philyp had assygned And when the king of France
herd that / ye next night after he set his tentys a fire and remeued and went
his way thens cowardly. Then they that were in ye town and in the castle
besyeged saw all this that they had none other help ne socour of ye king of
France ne of his men And also that their vytayls within them were spended and
wastyd and for fault of vytayls and of refresshynge they eten horses hounds
cattes and myse for to keep their troth as long as they might And wha^ they
saw and was found among them at the last that they had no thing among them
for to ete ne live by ne no socour ne rescowe of the frenssheme^ / of that
other side they wist well that they must needs deye for defaute or else yield
the town / and anon they went and took down ye baners and the arms of
france on every side that were hange^ out and went on ye walls of ye foresaid
town on diverse places as naked as ever they were borne sauf only their
shertes and their pryue clothes. and held their swerdes naked and the point
donward in their hondes / and putte^ ropes and halters about their necks and
yielded up the keys of the town and of the castle to king Edward of England
with great fere and dread of their lives and goods and dread of heart / And
king Edward saw all this as / a mercyable king and lord receyyed them to
grace / and few of the grettest prisoners of estate and governance of the
town he sent into England there for to abide their raunson and the kings
grace. And all the comynallte of the town the king let goo weder they would
in peace and with out any harm / and let them bear with the^ all their things
yt they might bear and carye away keeping ye twone and the castle to hymself^
Then through meditacyon of Cardynales that were sent from the pope / trewes
was take there by twene France and england for.ix. months than next
following. And about Myghelmas king Edward come again into Enlond with a
glorious vyctory. And in the.xxiii. year of his regne. in the Eest parties of
the world there arose and began a pestylence and death of Sarasyns and Paynyms
that so great a death was never herd of a fore / that wasted away the people so
that uneath the tenth person was left alive. And the same year about the such
countrees and also in the west countrees there fell so much rain and so great
waters that from Crystmas to myd somer there was uneaths no day ne night but
that it rayned some what / through which waters the pestylence was so enfected
and so habu^daunte in all countres. and namely about the court of Rome. and
other places and see costs that there were left living folk for too bury
they^ that were deed honestly But made great dyches and pyttes that were
wonder broad and deep and therein buried them / and made a renge of deed bodies
and cast a little earth to feel them above / and than cast in a another renge
of deed bodies / and an other renge above them / and thus were they buried and
none other wise / but if it were so that they were men of great estate so yt
they were buried as honestly as they might. And after all this in the.xxiiii.
year of king Edwardes regne it was done him to wete and understand of a
treason that was begone at Calays and ordained for to sell that town for a
great so^me of Florens unto king Phylyp of France thrughe the falsnesse and
or dynau^ce of a knight that was called sire Geffrey of Cherney was wonder
preny with king Phylyp of France And when king Edward herd this he took
with him the noblest and gentyllest lords and many other worythy men of arms
that were there present with him for the solempnyte of that high feast. And
well wisely in all the have that he myghe / and as pryuely as he might he went
over see to ward Calays. And that same year the good king edward held his
crystmas at Hauerynge. And the morn after new yers day the king was in the
castle of Calays with his men of arms that none of the alyens wist there of.
And that fais conspiratour and traitor Geffrey of Cherney sith that he might
not openly have his purpose of the castle / pryuely and stelyngly he come in
and held ye town with a great host. And wha^ he with his men were comen in /
he paid the for said sum of floreyns as couenaunte was to a Geneweye in the
town that was keeper of the castle and consentinge to the same Geffrey in all
his falsnesse and trechorye and bounden the English mynstrels and servants
that were in the castle yt they might not helep themself ne let them of
their purpos. And than wenyng that they had been sure enough / then they spaken
al their wickydnesse and falnesse openly on high yt all men might here. and now
shall ye here how they were deceived / for they came in by a preuy posterne
over a little bridge of tree / and wha^ they were comen in subtyly and pryuely
the bridge was drawn up and kept that no^e of them that came in might go out
ne no moo might come to them / and anon our Englysshmen went out at preuy
holes and wyndowes and over ye walls of the town and of the castle and went
and faught manly with the frensshmen that were without and had the better of
them / the which when they were occupied by them self on their side / the
king that was within the town having scarsely but.xxx. men of arms drew out
his sword and with a loud voys he creyed on high. Osaynt Edward. Osaynt
George. And when the people herd that / they come rennynge to him and gaaf
there to their enmyes so great assawte that there were moo than two hundred
men of arms and many mo other slain and many fled a way. And so by grace of
god almighty the vyctory fell unto the Englysshmen. Then the king took with
him this Geffrey that was fynder of this trechory And also many other Frenssh
prisoners / and then within a while after he come again in to England. And
in this same year and in the year before and also in ye year next following was
so great a pestylence of men from the eest in to ye west and namely through
botches that tho that sykened / as on this day deyed on the third day after
/ to the which men that so deyed in this pestylence had but little respyte of
lyssynge. The pope Clemente of his goodness and grace gaf them full remyssyon
and forgyuenesse of all their sins that they were shryuen of / and this
pestyle^ce lasted in London fro Myghelmas unto August. next following almoost
an hole year. And these days was death without sorrow / weddynges without
frendshyp / wylfull penance / and derth without scarsyte. And fleing without
refute or socour. for many fled from place to place by cause of pestylence. But
they were enfected and might not escape the death / after that the prophet
Isay sith who that flees fro the face of dread he shall fall into the dyche.
And he that wyndeth him out of the dyche he shall be hold and eyed with a
grenne / but when this pestyle^ce was cessyd as god would uneaths ye tenth
part of the people was left on live. And in ye same year began a wonder thing
that all that ever were borne after that pestylence had two cheketh in their
heed less than they had before.

How king Edward had a great battle with Spanyardes in ye see fast by
wynchelse.
ANd in the.xxv. year of his regne about saint Iohans day in harvest in the sea fast by wynchelse king Edward had a great battle with men of Spain
where yt their ships and nauye lay chayned together / that other they must
fight or be drenched. And so when all other worthy me^ and of the sea costs
fast by wynchelse and romeny were gadred together / and our nauye and ships al
ready to the war / the Englysshemen met manly and strongly with their enmyes
coming fyersly against them. And when the Spayns vessels and nauye were closed
all about / there men might se strong battle on both sides and long during
in ye which bataylle was but few that faught but they were rytously hurt.
And after the battle there were.xxiii. ships taken and so the Englysshemen
had the better. And in the next year following of his regne. that is to say
the xxvi. year the king through his counseyll let ordeyne and make his new
money / that is to say the penny the grote value of.iiii. pens and the half
great of.ii. pens. But it was of less weight than ye old sterlynge was be.v.
shells. in the pound. And in the.xxvii. year of his regne was the great derth
of vytayls yt which was called the dear somer. And the.xxviii. year of his
regne in the parliament holden at westmestre after Ester. sir Henry earl of
Lancastre was made duke of Lancastre and in this year was so great a drought
that from the monethe of March to the Monethe of Iuyll there fell no rain on
therth / wherefore all fruytes seeds and herbs / for the most part were lost
in defaute wherefore come so great disease of men and beestes and derth of
vytayls in England that this land that ever before had been plenteuous had
need that time to seek vitayls and refresshynge at other out yles and countres.
And the.xxix. year of king Edward it was accorded granted and sworn between
the king of France and king Edward of England that he shode have again all
his lands and lordshyppes that lo^ged to ye duchye of guyhen of old time the
which had be^ withdrawn and wrongfully occupied by diverse kings of France
before hand to have and to hold to king Edward and to his heirs and
successors for evermore. freely pesybly and in good quyete upon this covenant
that ye king of England should leave of and releasen all his right and claim
that he had claymed of the kingdom of france and of the title that he took
thereof / upon which speech and couenauntes it was sent to the court of Rome
on both sides of the kings. that ye foresaid covenant should de enbulled. but
god ordained better for the kings worship of England. for what through fraud
and dysceyte of the frensshme^ and what through lettynge of the pope and of the
court of Rome the foresaid couenau^tes were dysquate and left of. And in the
same year the king revoked by his wise and dyscrete counsel / the staple of
wulles out of flaundres into England with all ye lybertees fraunches and fre
customs that longed thereto and ordained it in England in diverse places /
that is for to say at westmestre / Caunterbury. Chychestre. Brystowe.
Lyncoln. And Hulle with all the foresaid things that longen thereto. And that
this thing that should thus be done the king swore himself thereto / and prince
Edward his sone with other many great witnesses that there where present. And
the xxx^ year of his regne anon after wytsontyde in the parlemente ordained
at westmenstre it was told and certefyed to the king that Phylyp that held
the kingdom of France was deed. And that Johan his sone was crowned king.
And that this Johan had given Karoll his sone the duchye of Guyhen. of the
which thing king Edward when he wist thereof he had great Indygnacyon unto
him and was wonder wroth and strongly meued. And therefore before all the
wrothy lords that there were assembled at that parliament called Edward his
sone unto him / to whom ye duchye of Guyhen by right heritage should long to
and gave it him there bidding and strenthynge him that he should ordeyne him
for to defend him and avenge him upon his enmyes and save and mayntene his
right. And afterward king Edward himself / and his eldest sone Edward went
to diverse places and saints in England on pilgrimage for to have the more
help and grace of god and of his saints. And ye.ii. kal of Iuyll. when all
thing was ready to that vyage and battle and all his retenue and power
assembled and his navy also ready he took with him ye earl of warwyk the earl of
Suffolk the earl of Salysbury and the earl of Oxforde and a thousand men of
arms and as many archers / and in the Natyuyte of our lady / took their
ships at plu^mouth and began to sayll. And when he come and was arrived in
Guyon / he was there worshypfully taken and recyued of the most noblest men
and lords of that country. And anon after king Edward took with him his
two sons. that is to say. sir Lyonell earl of Vlton and sir John^ his brother
earl of Rychemonde and sir Henry duke of Lancastre with many earls and lords
and men of arms and two thousand Archers and saylled toward France and
rested him a while at Calays and after the king went with his host aforsayd

half ye lordshyp of Melayne but after that they were solemply wedded and about
ye Natyuyte of our lady the same duke of Melayne deyed. And in the same year /
frensshmen brake the peace and the trewes riding on ye kings ground and
lordshyp of England in the shyre and country of Puu^tyfe / and token and held
castle and towns / and bear the Englysshmen on hand falsely and subtle that
they were cause of brekynge of trewes. and in this same year deyed the duches
of Lancaster and is buried worshypfully in saint Poules church. The.xliiii.
year of king Edwardes regne was the gretest pestylence of men and of great
bestes and by the great falling of waters yt fell at that time / there fell
great hyndrynge and destroyenge of corn in so much that ye next year after a
busshell of whete was sold for.xl.d. And in this same year about the last
end of May king Edward held tho his parliament at westmyster in which
parliament was treated and spoken of the oath and trewes that was broken between
him and the king of / france and how he might be avenged upon his wrong In
this same year in the Assumpcyo^ of our lady deyed queen Phylyp of England a
fulle noble and good lady and at westmyster full worship fully is buried and
entered And about mydsomer ye duke of Lancastre and the earl of Herforde with
a great company of knights went into france where as they gate them but
little wroshyp and name / for there was a great host of the frensshenmen upon
Calkhull bridge / and an other host of Englyssemen fast by the same bridge
that long time had lived there And many worthy and great men of England
ordained and yaf counseyll for to fight and yaf battle to the frensshemen but
the foresaid lords would not consent thereto for no manner thing. And anon
after it happened that ye earl of warwyke come thyderwarde for to war / and
when the frensshmen herd of his coming of that he came fully to land they
left their tents and pauylyous with all their vytayls and fled and went a
way pryuely. And when the earl was come^ to land with his men he went in all
have toward Normandy and destroyed the isle of Caux with strenthe of sword and
through fire But alas in his retornynge to England ward home again at Calys he
was taken with sykenes of pestylence and deyed not leuynge behind him after
his days so noble a knight of arms. In which time reigned and warred ye
noble knight sir John^ Hawkewod yt was an Englysshman borne / having with him
at his governance the white company that is a forsayde. yt which o time
against holy church and an other time ayenste lords warred and ordained great
batayls and there i^ that same country he did many merueyllous things. And
about the co^uercyon of saint Poule the king when he had ended and done the
entering and exequyes with great costs and ryaltes about ye sepulture of and
buryeng of queen Phylyp his wife he held a parliament at westmyster in which
parliament was axed or ye clergy a three years dyme / that is for to say a
great dyme to paid three year during / and the clargye put it of and would not
grant it unto Ester next coming / and than they granted well that in three
year by certain terms that dyme should be paid and also of the lay fee was
a three year.xv. granted to the king.

How sir Robert Knolles with other certain lords of the reame went over see
in to france and of their governance.
ANd in the.xlv. year of king Edward in the beginning king Edward with
unwise counseyll and indiscreet borrowed a great so^me of gold of the prelates
merchants and other rich men of his reame saying that it should despended in
defendyn he of holy church and of his reame netheles it profyted no thing /
wherefore about mydsomer after he made a great host of the worthyest men of his
reame Among whom were some lords yt is to say the lord Fytzwater and the
lord graunson and other worthy knights of which knights the king ordained
sir Robert Knolles a proud kny^t and a well assayd in deeds of arms for too
be gouerneur / and that through his counseyl and governance all thing should be
governed and dressed And when they come into / france as long as they dwelled
and held them hole together yt frenshemen durst not fall upon them. And at
the last about ye beginning of winter for envy and couetyse that was among
them / and also dyscorde they sondred and parted them into diverse co^panyes
unwisely and folesly. But sir Robert Knolles and his men went and keped thym
saufe within a castle in Brytayne. And when the frensshmen saw yt our men and
felaushyp were diuyded into diverse companyes and places not holding ne
strengthynge thym togyders as they out for to do / they fell fyersly on our
men / and for the most party took them or slew the^. and tho that they might
take led with them prisoners. And in ye same year pope Vrban^ came fro rome
to Auynyon for this cause that he should accord and made peace between ye king
of France and the king of England for ever more. But alas or he began his
treates he deyed with ye sickness the.xxi day of Decembre / and was buried as
for the time in the cathedral church of Auynyon fast by the high awter. and
the next year after when he had lain so his bones were taken out of the earth
and buried new in the abbay of saint vyctorye fast by Marcylle / of the which
abbaye he was sometime abbot himself. And in both places that he was baryed in
there he many great myrcales done and wrough through the grace of almighty god
to many man's help and to the worship of god almghty. And after whom followed
next and was made pope Gregorye Cardynalle Deken that before was called Pyers
Roger. In the same year Lymoge rebelled and faught against the prince as other
cytes did in Guyhem for great taxes cossages and raunsons yt they were put and
sete to by prince Edward / which charges were importable / wherefore they
turned fro him and fellen to the king of France. And when prince Edward this
he was sore chafed and agreued / and in his tornynge home ward again in to
England with sore scar musshes and fytynge and great sautes fought with them
and took the foresaid cytee and destroyed it almoost to the ground and slew
all that he found in the cite. And than for to say the sothe for diverse
sekenes and maladyes that he had and also for defaute of money yt he might not
with stand ne tarry on his enmyes he hyed him again in to England with his wife
and menye leuynge behind in Gascoyne the duke of Lancastre and sir Edmond earl
of Cambrydge with other worthy and noble men of arms. In the.xlvi. year of
king Edward at the ordinance and sengynge of king Edward / the king of
Nauerne come to him to Claryngdon to treat with him of certain things
touching his war in Normandye where king / Edward had left certain syeges
in his stead till he come again. But king Edward might not speed of that that
he seked him. And so the king of Nauerne with great worship and great gifts
to his leave and went home again. And abowte beginning of March when the
parlemente at westmyster was begone the king asked of the clergy a subsydye
of.l.M. pound the which by a good auysement and by a general co^uocao^n of
the clergy it was granted and ordained that it should be paid and raised of
the lay fee. And in this parliament at the request asking of the lords in
hatred of men of holy church. the Chaunceler and the tresourer that were
bishops and the clerk of the pryue sale. were remeued and put out of office
and in their stead were seculer men put in. And while this parliament lasted
there come somlepne embassatours fro the pope to treat with the king of peace
and said that the pope desired to fulfill his predecessors will but for all
their coming they sped not.

Of the besygynge of Rochell and how the earl of Penbroke and his company was
taken in ye haven with spanyerdes and all his ships brent.
THe.ix. day of June king Edward in the.xlvii. year of his regne held his
parlemente at whynchestre and it lasted but.viii. days / to the which
parliament were sompned by write of men of holy church.iiii. bishops and.v.
abbottes without any moo. This parliament was holden for merchants of London
of Norwhiche and of other diverse places in diverse things and points of
trason that they were defamed of / that is to say that they were rebel and
would arise against the king this same year the duke of Lancastre and the earl
of Cambrydge his brother come out of Gascoyne into Enlonde and took and wedded
to their wives peter's daughter sometime king of Spain Of which two daughters
the duke had the elder and the earl ye younger. and that same time there were
sent two Cardynals fro the pope / that is to say an English Cardynall and a
Cardynal of Paris to treat of peace between these two reames / yt which when
they had been both long each in his prouynce and countreees fast by treating
of the foresaid peace / at the last they took with them the lettes of
procuracye and went again to Rome without any effect of their purpose. In this
year was there a strong Battle in the sea between Englysshmen and flemynges
and ye Englysshmen had the victory and took.xxv. ships with salt and sleynge
and drenchynge all ye me^ that were therein vnwetynge they they were of that
country. And much harm should have fallen thereof had not peace and accord
sone be made between them. And in this same year the frensshmen besyeged the
town of Rochell wherefore the earl Penbroke was sent into gascoyne with a great
company of men of arms for to dystroye the syege / which passed the sea and
came sauf to the haven of Rochell / and when they were there at the haue^ mouth
or that they might enter / suddenly come upon them a strong nauye of
Spanyardes ye which overcame the Englysshmen in much blemysshynge hurtinge
and sleynge of many people for as much as the Englysshmen were than not ready
for to fight ne were ware of them. And as the Spanyerdes came upon them all the
Englysshmen other they were taken or slain / and.x. of them were sore wounded
to the death and all their ships burnt / and there they took the earl with a
great tresour of the reame of England and many other noble me^ also on
mydsomer even the which is saint Edeldredes day and led them with them into
Spain. And of this myscheyf was no great wonder for this earl was a full ylle
liver as an open lechoure And also in a certain parlemente he stood and was
against the ryghtes and fraunchyse of holy church And also he counseylled the
king and counseyll that he should axe mo of men of holy church than other
persons of the lay me^. And for the king and other men of his counseyll
accepted and took rather ylle opynyons and causes ayenste men of holy church
than he did for to defend and mayntene the right of holy church / it was
after seen many times for lack of fortune and grace they had not ne bare away
so great vyctory ne power against their enmyes as they did before. This same
year the king with a great host entered the sea to remeue the syege of Rochell /
but the wind was ever contrary unto him and suffered him not long time to go
fer fro the land / wherefore he abode a certain time upon the sea costs
abiding after a good wind for the^ and yet come in not So at ye last he come
thens with his me^ to land ward again. and anon as he was a land yt wind
began to torn and was in an other cost than he was before.

How the duke of Lancastre with a great host went into / flaundres and passyd
by Paris through Burgon and through all france till he come unto Burdeux.
Soon after in the.xlviii. year of the regne of king Edward the duke of
Lancastre with a great power went into / flaundres and passed by Paris through
Burgon and thrughe all / france till he came unto Burdeux without any manner
wythstandynge of the / frensshemen \ and he did them but little harm saufe he
took and raunsoned many places and towns and many men and let them go after
freely. The same year the king sent certain embassatours to ye pope prayenge
him that he should leave of and meddle not in his court of the kepi^ge and
reseruacyo^s of benefyces in England. And that tho that were chose^ to
bysshoppes sees and dignetees freely and with full might Joy and have and be
confermed to the same of their metropolytans and Archebysshops as they were
wont to be of old time Of these points and of other touching the king and
his reame / when they had their answer of the pope / the pope enjoined them
that they should certefy him again by their letter of ye kings will and of his
reame or they determined ought of the foresaid artycles In this same year deyed
Johan the Archebysshop of york / Johan bishop of Ely / wyllyam byssop of
worcestre. In whoos stedes followed and were made bishops by auctoryte of pope.
master. Alexander Neuyll to the Archebysshop of york. Thomas of Aru^dell to
the bysshopryche of Ely. and sir Henry wakfelde to the bysshopryche of
worcestre. In the which time it was ordened in ye parliament that all
Cathedral chyrches should Joy and have their elecco^ns hole and yt the king fro
that time afterward should not writ against the^ that were chosen / but rather
help them by his letters to their confyrmacyon and this statute did much
profit. And in this parliament was grau^tyd to the king a dyme of the clergy
and a.xv. of lay fee. In the.xlix. of the regne of king Edward deyed Master
wyllyam wytlesey Archebysshop of Caunterbury and the monks of the same church
asked and desired a cardynall of England to be Archebysshop. and therefore the
king was agreued and meant and purposed to have exyled the monks of the same.
and they spended much good or they might have ye kings grace again and his
love but yet would the king not consent ne grant to their elecco^n of ye
Cardynall ne of the pope also ne his Cardynalles. And at the begynnyge of
August it was treated and spoken at Bruges of certain points / and artycles
hanging between the pope and the king of England / this treates lasted
almoost too year. And at the last it was accorded between them that the pope
fro that time forth should not use ne dele with the reseruacyons of benefytes
in England / and that the king should not grant ne let no benefyces by his
writ yt is called (Quare impedyt) But as touching the eleccion abouesayd
there was no thing touched ne done. And that was wyted and put upon certain
clerks the which rather supposed and hoped to be auau^ced and promoted to
bysshhpryches which they desired and coueyted by the court of Rome rather than
by any other eleccyons / This same year about Candelmasse there met together
at Bruges many noble and worthy men of both sides and reames to trete of peace
bitwene tho two kings. And this tretes lasted two year with great costs and
large expensens of both parties. And at the last they went and departed thens
without any accord or effect. The next year after the.l. year of king Edward
ye.iiii. Non^ of May being yet void and vacaunt the Archebysshopryche of
Caunterbury master Symonde sudbery bishop of London was made Archebysshop
and master wyllyam courteney that was bishop of Herforde was than made
bishop of London / and the bishop of Bangor was made bishop of Herforde. And
this same time in a certain treates and speaking of peace trewes was taken
between them of France and England fro mydsomer to mydsomer come again an hole
year and about the beginning of Aprell ye duke of brytayne with many earls
barons and worthy lords and men of England went over see in to Brytayn where
he has had all his lust desire and purpose ne had the for said trewes be so
soon taken the which let them. This same time the isle of Constantyne where
that the castle of saint Saueour is in. that long time was foughten at and
besyeged of the Frensshmen than yield to the Frensshmen with all the
apportenau^tes in to great harm and hyndrynge of ye reame of England And this
same year there were so great and so passing hetes and there with all a great
pestylence in England and in other diverse parties of ^he world yt it
destroyed and slew vyolently and strongly both men and wymen without nombre.
This same year deyed sir Edward ye lord spencer a worthy knight and a bold
and in the mynster of Teukesbury worshipfully is buried. And lasting this
pestilence the pope at the instaunce and prayer of an English Cardynale
granted to all people that deyed in England that were sorry and repentau^t for
their sins and also shryue^ full remyssyon by two bulls under led.vi.
months than next to last. In this same year the earl of Penbroke was taken
and rau^soned by Bartram Clayken between Paris and Calays as he come toward
England upon saint Atheldredes day yt which saint as it was said the earl
oftentimes had affe^ded / and within a little while after he deyed. And in
Nouembre next after there met at Bruges the duke of Lancastre and the duke of
Angoy with many other lords and prelates of both reames for to treat of peace.

Of the death of prince Edward and of the lord Latymer and dame Alyce peers
thrughe whom and her maynteners ye Reame many a day was mysgouerned.
NOt long after the.li. year of King Edwardes regne he let ordeyne and hold
at westmynster the grettest parliament yt was seen many a year before. In the
which parlemente he asked of the comynaltee of the reame as he had done before
a great subsydye to be granted to him for defe^dynge of him and of his reame
but ye comunes answered that they were so often day by day grieved and charged
with so mani talag^s and subsydyes yt they might no le^ger suffer no such
burtho^s and charges and that they knew and wist well enough that the king
had enough for saving of him and of his reame if the reame were well and
truly governed / But that it had be so long evil governed by ylle officers
/ that the reame might another be plenteuous of chaffre and marchaundyse ne also
with richesse. And in these things they profyred themself if the King would
certainly to preue it and stand by. and if it were founde^ and proved
afterward that the King had need they would gladly every man after his power
and state him help and lene. And after this were publysshed and showed in the
parlemente many playntes and defautes of diverse officers of ye reame and namely
of the Lord Latymer the kings chamberlayne both to the King and eke to the
reame. And also at the last there was spoken and treated of dame Alyce Pers
for the great wrongs and evil governance yt was done by her counseyl in the
reame The which dame Alyce pers that ye king had holden long time to his
lemman wherefore it was the last wonder though through the frealter of the
woman's excytynge and her steringe he consented to her lewdness and evil
cou^seyl the which dame Alyce and also the lord Latymer and other such ye
meued the king to evil governance against his profit and the reame also /
all the comynalte asked and desired that they should be remeued and put away
and in their stedes wise me^ and worthy that were true and well assaied and
proved and of good governance. should be put in their stedes. So among al
other there was one among the comunes that a wise knight and a true / and an
eloquent man whoos name was Pers delamare. And this same pers was chosen to be
speker for the comunes in the parleament And for this same Pers told and
publysshed the truth and rehearsed ye wrongs ayenste the foresaid dame Alyce
and other certain persons of the kings counseyll as he was bydde by the
comyns. And also trusting much to be supported and mayntened in this matter by
help and favor of the. prince anon as the prince was deed at the instaunce
and request of the foresaid dame Alyce / this Pers de amare was Iugyd to
perpetual prison in the castle of Notyngham. And in the.vi. kal. of Iule
lasting ye same parlemente deyed prince Edward king Edwardes first sone /
that is to say in trynyte sunday in worship of which feste he was wo^te every
year where that ever he were i^ ye world to hold and made the most
sole^pnyte that he might. whose name and fortune of knyghthode but if it had be
of an other Ector all men both christian and hethen while that he lived and was
in good point wo^dred much and dradde him wonder soore / whoos body is
worshypfully buried in Crychyrche at Caunterbury. And in this same year the me^
and the earls tenauntes of warwyk arose malycyously against ye abbot and covent
of Euesham and their tenauntes. and destroyed thabbaye. and the town and
wounded and beat their men and slew many of them / and went to their manners
and places and did much harm / and brake down there parkes and closes and
slew their wild bestes and chaced them brekynge their fysshe pounds and
hedes and let the water of their pondes stews and ryuers run out and took
the fysshe and bare it with them. and did them all the sorrow that they
might. in so ferforthe that forsooth they had destroyed perpetual that abbay
with all their members and apportenaunces but if the king the sooner had not
helped it and taken head thereto. and therefore the king sent his letters to ye
earl of warwyk chargyng him and co^mau^dynge him that he should stynt redress
and amend tho evil doers and brekers of his peace. and so by means of lords
and other friends the peace was made bitwene them. and for this hurtynge as it
is said ye king would not be governed as that time by his lords that there
were in ye parliament. but he took and made his sone the duke of Lancastre his
gouerneur of the reame / the which stood so still as governor till ye time
that he dyed. The same year after. ca^delmasse or the parliament was done / the
King asked a subsidye of the clargy and of the lay fee and it was grau^tyd hy^
/ that is to say that he should have of every person of ye lay fee both man
and woman that passed fourtene year of aege four pe^s out taken pore beggars
that were known openly for need pore beggars. And that he should have of every
man of the holy church that was benefyced or promoted twelve pens and all
other that were not promoted iiii. pens out taken the.iiii. ordres of the friar
beggars This same year after Myghelmasse Richard prince Edwardes sone was made
prince of wales to whom the king gaf ye duchy of cornewayle with ye erldom of
chestre. And about this time ye Cardynale of England ye.iiii. day before mary
Mawdalenes day after dinner suddenly was smite with the paslye and lost his
speech / and on mary Mawdalen^s day deyed.

Of ye death of King Edward and how sir Johan Monster warch knight. was
drawn and hanged for his falsnesse.
Right anon after in the.lii. year of King Edward in the beginning of
Octobre pope Gregorye the.ix. brought and remeued his court with him from
Auy^yon to come. And the.xii. day of Apryl. Johan Monsterwarthe. Knight at
London was drawn and hangyd and than quartred and sent to four cheyf towns of
England and his heed smyten of and sete upon londen bridge / for this same
John^ was full untrue to the king and to ye reame and coueytous and unstable
/ for he took oftymes great so^mes of money of the king and his counsel for
men of arms wages that he should have paed them and took it to his own use /
and he dradde that at the last he should be shent and accused for the same
cause and fled pryuely to the king of France and was sworn to him and become
his man and behyghte him a great nauye out of Spain in to confucyon and
destroynge of England / But the ryghtfull god to whom no preuyte is unknown
suffered him first to beshente and spylt or that he so traytoursly and falsely
betrayed his lyege lord the king of England and his people in his reame in
the which ground this same John^ was borne and wyckydly thrughe battle
destroyed or he brought about his cursed purpose. In the feast of Saint George
tho next king Edward gaaf to Rychard of Burdeux his heyr yt was prince
Edwardes sone at wyndsore thordre of knughthode and made him knight the which
king Edward when he had reigned.li. year the.xi. kal of June he deyde at Shene
and is buried worshypfully at westmyster on whose soul god have mercy. This
king Edward was for soth of a passing godenes and full gracyous among all
the worthy men of the world for he passed and shone by virtue of grace gauen
to him from god above all his predecessors yt were noble men and worthy and he
was a well hearted man and an hardy / for he drade never no myshappes ne harms
ne evil fortune yt might fall a noble warryoure and a fortunate / for both on
land and see and in all batayls and assembles with a passinge glory and Joy he
had the vyctory he was meke and benygne homely sobre and soft to all me^ as
well to strangers as to his own subgettes and to other yt were under his
gouenau^ce. He was devout and holy both to god and holy church / for he
worshypped help and mayntened holy church and their mynystres with all manner
reverence / he was treatable and well auysed in temporal and worldly needs
wise in counseylle and dyscrete and meke to speak with / in his deeds and
manners gentle and well taught / having pity of them that were in dyseace /
plecteuous in geuynge of been faytes and almoses besy and curyous in bayldynge
/ and lightly he bare and suffered wrongs and harms and when he was given to
any occupacyon he left all other thing for the time and tended there to semely
of body and a meyne stature / having al way to high and to low a good
chere. And here spronge and shone so much grace of him that what man had
behold his face or had dremed of him he roged that day that all thing should
hap to him Joyful and lysynge. And he governed his kingdom gloryously unto
his aege / he was large in geuynge and wys in spentes / he was fulfilled with
all his honest of good manners and virtues / under whom to live it was as for
to regne. wherefore his fader and his loos spronge so far that it came in to
hethenes and Barbary showing and telling his worthynes and manhood in all
lands / and that no land under heaven had brought forth so noble a king so
gentle and so blessed or might reyse such an other when he was deed
Nevertheless lechery and meuynge of his flesh hauntyd him in his aege /
wherefore the rather as it is to suppose for unmeasurable fulfyllynge of his
lust his life shorted the sooner. And hereof take good hedelyke as his dedys
bears wymesse for as in his beginning all things were Joyful and liking
to him / and to all people. And in his myddel aege he passed all people in
high Joy worship and blyssydnes. Right so when he drew in to aege drawing
donwarde thrughe lechery and other sins little and little all tho Joyful
and blessed things and prosperity decreasyd and mysshcaped and unfortunate
things and unprofitable harms with many euyls began for to spring and the
more harm is yt continued long time after.

CLemens the.vi. was pope after Benedict.x. year / this man in name and deed
was virtuous / and many things that Benedict was rygous in / he made easy /
and certain that he depryued he restored / and the rygousenes of the faith of
Benedict was laudable ^ But much more laudable was the meekness of Clement.
This man was a noble prechour and many sermons he gadred / and let no man
pass from him but he gaaf him good counseyll / and decessyd a blessed man.
Karolus the.iiii. was Emperor after Lodewyk.xxxi. year. Chis man was king of
Beme a wise man and a mighty. And this man was chosen Emperor by the
commandment of Clemens Lodewyk being a live in his contemacy / and because
he asked mekely the poopes blessing and too be crowned of him as other good
kings did. therefore he was protected of god and preueyled over all his
enmyes. And many favorable laws he made spyrytuall men / the which yet are
called Karolma / at the last he decessed a rich man in virtue and gooddes^
Innocentius the.vi. was pope after Cleme^te.x. year / and he was a great lover
of relygous men and he founded a monestery in France of the order of
Cartusyens. and was a great canonyst. Vrbanus the.v. was pope after Innocent.
this man was abbot of Myssolens of the order of Saint Benet a doctor and is
taken for a saint. he made the cross too be preched against the Turks / and he
made a passage to the Turks / And to him saint Brygt was sent from Christ
for the confyrmacyon of their rule and thanne he was poysened and decessyd.
Gregory the.ix. was pope after him.viii. year This Gregory did little. And
after him followed the trybulacyon the which our lord showed to saint Brygyt
for the sin of the clargye Venselaus sone to Karolus a foresaid was
Emperor.xiiii. year. And he was a child and was chosen when his fader was on
live / but he took no keep of them pyre / and when he was warned many times
for to take heed unto it and would not. He was deposed / For he gaaf all his
delight and lust to lechery / and his end was without honor for he went
greatly from the manners and the virtues of his noble fader. And he was crowned
with themperyall dyademe. and the wisdom of his fader passed into Sygysmonde
his brother as after it shall appyre. Trbanus was pope after Gregory.vi. year /
this Urban was chosen in the cytee of Rome by the strenth of ye Romans but the
Cardynals did yt fo. dread and not wyllyngly / Wherefore they fled unto the
Cite of Foundoru^ And they said yt he was not pope / and chose in his place
sir. Robert of Gebennys the same year the which was called Clement the.vii^
Nota. And here began ye.xii. strife in the church. And it was more worse than
ever was any other before / for it was so subtle / that ye wysest me^ that
were and ye best of conscience could not deserve with whom it was best to
say and to hold. And this strife dured xl. year with a great sclaunder unto
the clergy and great peril unto mennys souls for heresies and other evil
things the which were brought in than. In so much that there was no doctrine
in the church for mysdoynge and therefore from this day Vrbane the.vi. unto
Martyne I know not who was pope. The feast of the vysytaco^n of our lady was
ordained by Vrbane the.vi. after the form of the sacrament of the awter for
a peace and an unity to be had among them through the merytees of our blessyn
lady. Bonefacias the ^ix. was pope after Vrbane.xv year. This Boneface was
chosen at Rome in the stead of Vrbane / and the strife continued For Benedictys
was chosen in Auynyon in the place of clement and was called Petrus de luna and

to serve them all. And thus this worthy marriage was sole^ply done and ended
with all ryalte. And than these two worthy dukes of Fraun^e with their people
token their leave of the king and of the queen and went again unto Grauenynge
water. And there the Frensshe lords / that is to say the two dukes and all

dukes / and every chone took leave at other and so they departed / and our
lords camen again unto calays / and the Frensshe lords went over the water and
so home in to France again. And anon after the king made him ready with the

kings commandment of England. And ye time therle Marchall was Capytayne of
Calays. And anon after by commandment of the king and by his false counseyl

the good duke in keeping took their counseyl how that they should put him unto
death. And this was their appoyntemente that they should comen upon him when he
were in his bed and a sleep on a fetheren bed / and anon they bound hand

token two small towelles and made on them two riding knottes and cast the
towelles about his neck. And than they took the fetheren bed that lay
under him and cast it about him and than they drew their to wells each ways
and some lay upon ye fetheren bed upon him unto the time that he was deed
because that he should make no noys and thus they strangled this worthy duke
unto the death / upon whose soul god for his high pity have mercy. Amen. And
when the king had rested thus this worthy duke and his uncle and sent him
to Calays he came again to London in all the haste with a wonder great people.
And as soon as he was comen he sent for the earl of Aurundell / and for the
good earl of warwyk and anon as they came he arested them himself. And sir
Johan Cobham and sir John^ Chyne knights he arested them in the same. manner
till he made his parliament. and anon they were put into hold / but the earl

they might get in maintenynge and in the strengthyng of the king against them

the which yemen and archers the king took to his own court and gaate them
bowge of court and good wages to be kepers of his own body both by night and
by day above all other persons and most loved and best trust / the which

him were made and ordained blanke chertres and made them to be enseled of all
manner rich men thrughout the reame. In so much that they compelled diverse
people to set their seases therto^ And this was done for great couetyse
wherefore all good hertes of the reame were clean turned away fro the king for
ever after. And that was utterly his dystruccyon and end to him that was so
high and so excellent prince and king and through covetous and falls counseyll
falsely betrayed. Alas for pity that such a king might not se. And than king
Richard set his kingdom and his ryall land of England to ferme unto four
persons / the which were these. Sire wyllyam strop earl of wyltshyre and
tresourer of England / and sir Johan Busshe / and Henry grieve / and sir Johan
Bagot knights that which / turned them to myscheyf and death within a little

down to the king and yolde them to him both body and goods all at his own
will / and swore unto him to be his lyege men / and there did to him homage
and feaute and good seruyse and thus he conquered the most part of Irlonde in
alytyll time And while that king Richard was thus in Irlonde / sir Henry of
Bolyngbroke earl of Derby that the king had made before duke of Herforde / the
which duke the king had exyled out of this land was comen again into Enlonde

left his ordinance in Irlonde and come into England ward in all the haste
that he might and come the castle of Flynte and there he abode to take his

Percy earl of worchestre that was the kings steward wist and knew all this /
anon he came into the halle among all the people / and he brake the yerde of
the ryall kings household / and anon every man was dysparple and went his
way and forsook their master and sovereign lord and left him allone. And
thus King Richard brought down and destroyed and stood himself allone
without comforth or socoure or if any good counseyll of any man / alas for pity
of this ryall king. And anon came word that sire Henry of Bolyngbroke was up
with a strong power of people and that all the squyres of England reyson up

Slack dene of ye kings chapel of westmynster taken and brought to London /
and put in prison in Ludgate. And Johan Bagot was taken in Irlonde and so
brought to London and put in prison in Newgate there to be kept and abide his

and put him in the toure under sure keeping as a prisoner. And than came the
lords of the reame with all their counseyll unto the Toure to king Richard
and said to him of his mysgouernaun^e and extorcyon that he had done made and
ordained to opresse all the comyne people and also to all the reame. wherefore

Circa Annu^ dm^. M.CCCC.xxi. Of king Henry the fyfte that was king Henryes
sone.
ANd after the death of king Henry the fourth reigned king Henry his sone that
was borne at Monmouthe in wales that was a worthy king and a gracyous man and
a great conqueror. And in the first year of his regne for great love and
goodness he sent to the ferres of Langley there as his fader had do burye
king Rychard the second and let take his body out of the earth again and did
bring it to westmynster in a ryal chare covered with black velvet and baners
of diverse arms about and all the horse drawing the chare were trapped in
black and beten with diverse arms / and many a torche brennynge by all the
way till he came to westmynster / and there he let make for him a ryall and
solemn enteremente and buried him by queen Anne his wife as his own desire
was on ferther side of saint Edwardes shryne in the abbaye of saint Peter's in
westmynster on whose soul god have mercy Amen And in this same year were a
certain of lollers taken and falls herytykes that had purposed through falls
treason for to have slain our king / and for to have destroyed all the
clargye of the reame and they might have had their falls purpose. But our lord
god would not suffer it / for in haste our king had warning thereof and of
all their falls ordinance and werkinge and came suddenly with his power to
Saint Iohans without smythfelde and anon they took a certanye of the Lollers
and falls herytykes and brought them to the kings presence / and there they
told all there falls purpose and ordinance how they would have do and
wrought if they might have reigned and had their will / and there they told
which were their Capytayens and governors and than ye king commanded them
to the Tower of London / and thanne took moo them both within the City and
without and sent them too Newgate and to both / counteers. And thanne they
were brought in examycyon before the clergy and the kings Justices and there
they were conuycted for their falls heresy and dampened before the Justice for
their falls treason. And this was their Judgment that they should be drawn
from the Towr of London to Saint Gelys field and there to be hanged and burnt
on the galowes. And there was taken sir Roger Acton knight for heresye and eke
for treason ayenste the king and the Reame / and he came before the clergy and
was conuy^te for his heresye and dampened before the Justice too be drawn from
the Tower of London thrughe the Cite to Saint Gelys and to be hanged and
burnt. And in the second year of King Henryes regne the fyfthe he held a
counseylle of all the lords of the reame at westmynster and there he put
him this demand and prayed and besought them of their goodness and of their
good counseyll and will to show him as touching the title of the right that
he had to Normande Gascoyne and Guyhen the which the king of France
wythelde wrongfully and vntyghte fully / the which his auncestrees before him
had by true title of conquest and right heretage / the which Normandye
Gascoyn and Guyhen the good King Edward of wyndesore and his auncestres
before him had holden all their lives time. And his lords gaaf him counseyl
to sendde enbassatours unto the king of France and his counseyll that he
should give up unto him his right heritage / that is to say Normandye Gascoyne
Guyhen the which his predecessors had holden before him or else he would it
wyn^e with strength of sword in short time with the help of almighty god.
And thanne the Dolphyn of France answered to our enbassatours and said in
this manner that the King was over young and to terder of aege for comak any
war as ayenste him and not like yet to be a good warroure to do and make
such aconqueste there upon him. And somewhat in scorn and dyspyte he sent to
him a tonne fulle of tenes balls because he would have some what for to play
with all for him and for his lords / for that would be come him better then
for to^ mayntene any war. And then anon our Lords that werre
enbassatours took their leave and came in to England again and told the king
and his counseyll of the ungoodly answer that they had of the Dolphyn / and of
the present ye which he had sent to our king. And when the king had herd
their words and the answer of the Dolphyn he was wonder sore agreued and
right evil apayed toward the Frensshemen and toward the king and the Dolphyn
/ and thought to avenge him on them as soon as god would send him grace and
might / and ano^e let make tenes balls for the Dolphyn in all the have that
might be / and they were great gonstones for ye Dolphin to play with all / And
than anon ye king sent for all his lords and held a great counseyll at
westmynster and told unto them the answer yt they had of the Dolphyn and of
the worthy prese^te that he sent to him and to his lords to play with all.
And there the king and his lords were accorded yt they should be ready in arms
with there power in the best array that might be done and get men of arms and
archers yt might be gotten and all other stuff that longed to war and to be
ready with all their retenue to mete at Southampton by Lammasse next following
without any delay. wherefore the king ordained his nauye of ships was with
all manre stuff and vytayll ye longed to such a warryoure of all manner of
ordinance in the haue^ of Southampton in to the nombere of.CCC. and.xx.
saylles. And than fell there a great disease and a foul myschef for there
were.iii. lords which that the king trusted much on / and through falls
couetyse they had purposed and ymagyned the kings death and thought to have
slain him and all his brethren or he had taken ye see the which three lords
were named thus sire Richard earl of Chambrydge brother to the duke of york /
the second was she lord Scrop tresourer of England / the third was sir
Thomas Gray knight of the North country. And these three lords before said for
lucre of money had made a promise unto the Frensshmen for to have slain
king Henry the fyfte and all his brethern by a falls train suddenly or they
had be ware. But god almighty held his holy hand over them and saved them
from these peryllous menye. And for to have done this they received of the
Frensshemen a Myllyon of gold / and that was there openly known / and for
their falls treason they were al three Iuged unto the death / and this was the
Judgment that they should be laadde thrughe Hampton and without Northgate
there to be heded / and thus they ended their lives for thyr false couetyse and
treason / And anon as this was done the king and all his men ye made them
ready and went to ships and saylled forth with fyften hundred ships and
aryued with in Seyn at Kydecause upon our ladies even the Assumpcyon in
Normandy with all his ordinance. And so went him forth to Harflet and he
besyeged the town all about by land and eke by water and sent to the
Capytayne of the town and charged him to deliver town. And Capytayne said yt
he would deliver him none he would him yield / but bad him do his best. And
than our king laid his ordinance unto the twone / that is to say Gonnes
Engynnes and trypgettes and shotten and cast at the walls and eke unto the
town / and cast down both towers and town and laid them unto the earth /
and there he played at the tenes with his hard gone stones. And they that were
within the town when they should play their songs was well away and Alas
that ever such tenes balls were made / and cursyd all tho that war began
and the time that ever they were borne. And on the morn the king did cry at
every gate of the town that every man should be ready on the morn erly to make
assaute unto ye towe. and wyllyam Boucher and Johan Grant with.xii. other
burgeys worthy men came to the king and besought him of his ryall pryncehode
and power to wythdrawe his malice and destruccyon that he did to them and
besought him of.viii. days of respyce and trewes if any rescowe might come to
them / and else to yield up the town unto him with all their goods And than
the king sent forth the Capytayne and kept the remenaunt still with him and ye
lord Gaucort that was Capytayn of the town went forth to Royn in all the have
unto the Dolphyn for help and socour but there was none ne no man of rescowe /
for the Dolphyn would not abide. And thus this Capytayne come again unto the
king and yielded up the town and delivered him the keys and bad him go and put
out all the Frensshmen both men women and children and stuff his town of
Har^et with English people. And than the king sent in to England and did
cry in every good town of England that what crafty man would come thydes and
enhabyte him there in that town he should have house and household to him and
to his heirs for ever more. And so tho went many diverse merchants and
crafty men and enhabyte them there to strength the town and were welcome. And
when the king saw that this town was well stuffed both of vytayls and of me^
this worthy prince took his leave and went to Calays ward by land / and the
Frensshme^ herd of his coming they thought for to have stopped him his way that
he should not pass that way and in all the have that they might braken all
the brydges where that as any passage was for horse and man in so much that
there might no man pass over the River another on horse ne on foot but if he
should have be drowned. And therefore our king with all his people went and
sought this way far up to Paris ward and there was all the ryall power of
France assembled and ready to give him battle and for to dystroye all his
people. But almyghte god was his guide and saved him and al his menye and
defended him of his enmyes power and purpose thanked be god that saved so his
own knight and king in his ryghtfull title. And than our king be holding
and seyenge the great multitude and nombre of his enmyes to wythstande his way
and give him battle / than the king with a meke heart and a good spyryte lift
up his hondes to almighty god and be souhht him of his help and socoure and
that day to save his true servants. And than our king gadred all his
lords and other people about and bad them all to be of good there / for they
should have a fair day and a gracyous vyctorye and the better of all their
enemies / and prayed the^ all to make them ready unto the battle. For he would
rather be deed that day in the field. than to be taken of his enmyes for he
would never put the reame of England to raumsome for his person.

An the duke of york fell on his knees and besought ye king of above that he
would grant him that day the auauntwarde in his battle / and the King
grauntyd him his asking and said / gramercy cosyn of york and prayed him to
make him ready. And than he had every man to ordeyne him a stake of tree and
sharp both ends that ye stake might be pyght in the earth a slope that their
enemies should not overcome them on horsback for that was there falls purpose
and arrayed the^ for to over ride our enmye suddenly at the first coming on
of them at the first brunte. And all the night before the battle the /
frensshmen made many great fyers and much reuyll with howtynge ^ showtynge and
played our king and his lords at the dyse. And archer always for a blanke of
their money / for they we^de yt all had be^ theyrs the morn arose the day
ganne spynge. And the king by good auyse let array his battle and his wings
and charged every me^ to keep the^ hoole together and prayed them all to be of
good there. And when they were ready he asked what time of the day it was and
they said pryme Than said our king now it is good time for all England prayed
for us / and therefore be of good chere and let us goo to our Journey. And
than he said with high voys in the name of almighty god and saint George
auaunce Baner and saint George this day thyn help. And than this Frensshemen
came pryckynge down as they would have over ryden all our meny. but god and
our archers made the^ right sone to stomble / for our archers shote never
arowe amysse but it perysshed and brought unto ye ground both horse and man /
for they shote that day for a wager. And our stakes made them top over terue
each one over other that they lay onhepes two hepes lenth of high. And our
king with his menye and with his men of arms and archers that sthacked on
them so thycke with arowes and laid on with staves and our king with his
ho^des fought ma^ly that day. And thus god almighty and saint George brought
our enmyes to ground and gaf us that day the vyctory. There werre slain of
Frensshmen ye day in the field of Agyngcourt moo than.xi. thousand with our
prisoners that were taken and there were nombred that day of Frensshme^ in the
field moo than sir score thousand. But god that day faughte for us. And after
came there tidings to our King that there was a new battle of Frensshmen
ordained ready for to stele on him and came toward him. And anon our King
let cry that every man should do slay his prisoners that he had taken /
and anon to make them again ready for to fight with the Frensshe men / And
when they saw that our men killed down their prisoners than they did
wythdrawe / them and brake their battle and all their array. and thus our
king was a worthy conqueror had that day the vyctory in the field of
Agyngcourte in Pycardye / And than our king return again there that the

al they should encountre with our menye. And each of the Capytayns ladde five
thousand / men of arms and some moo. And of the first coming of our King
their were nombred by Heroudes in to three hundred thousand of me^ and women
and children what young and old / and among all these was many a man full man
of his hondes and so the preued them when they issued out of the cytee both on

or four gates and atte^ every gate two or three thousand of good mennys bodies
armed and manfully encou^tred with our Englyssme^ and much people slain
diverse times with gonnes quarelles and other ordinance. And this syege dured
^xx. wekes and every they of the town trusted to have be rescowed but there
came none / so at the last they kept town so lange that there deyed many a
thousa^des within the town for defaute of mete of men and children / for they
had eten their horses dogs and cattes that were in the town. And often times
the men of arms drofe out the pore people out at the gates of the town for
spending of vytaylles / and anon our Englysshmen drofe them into the town
again So at the last the Capytayne of the town saw the myschyef and that
they were not rescowed and also the scarsyte of vytaylle and that the people
deyed so for defaute of meet every day many thousands / And also saw young
children lie and souke their moders pappes and were deed. Than anon they sent

king entered in to the town and rested him in the castle till of ye wne was
set in rule and in governance.

defending of his reame and subgettes And for as much as his fader had deposed
by his labor the good king Richard and pyteously made him to deye / and for
the offense done to him against his legaunce he had sent to rome for to be
assoyled thereof For which offense our holy fader ye pope enyoyned him to make
him to be prayed for perpetually. and like as he had done to be taken from him
his natural life therefore he should do fyside four tapers to bre^ne perpetually
about his body that for the extyncco^n of his bodily life his soul may ever be
remembered and life in heaven in spyrytual life. And also that he should every
weke on ye day as come aaboute of his death have a solemn mass of requie^
and on ye eue^ before dyryge with.ix. lessons and a doole to poor people always
on that day of a xi. shellynges and.vii. pens to be deled penny mele / and ones
in the year at his annyuersary his terme^te to be holden in ye most honest wise
/ and ^ bedeled ye day.xx. pound in pens to poor people And to every
monk.xx. shellynge which all these thynhes performed this noble king for
his fader for king Henry the fourth / his fader performed it not during his
life of whom as it is said that god did touch him and was lepreor that he
deyed. And also this noble prince let do call all ye abbottes and pryours of
saint Benets order in England and had all them into the chapter house of
westmynster for the reformacyon of their order wherein he had comunycacyon / and
also with bishops and me^ of the spyrytualte / in so far forth that they
doubted sore as that he would have had the temporaltes out of their hondes /
wherefore by the advise labors and procuring of the spyrytuallyte encouraged
the king for to challenge Normandye and his right in France / to that entente
to set him a warke there that he should not seek none occasyons for to enter
into such matters And than all his life time afterward he labored and was besy
in the war and in conquerynge a great part of the reame of / france. and so
afterward yt by the grement of the King Charles he had the governance and
the rule of the reame of / france and he was proclaimed regnet and heir of /
france. And so notwithstanding for all this great war that he had /
nevertheless yet he remembered his soul and also thought that he was mortal and
needs must deye / for which cause he ordained by his life time the place of
his sepulture where as he is buried / and has every day three masses
perpetually songen in a chapel our his sepultur of the which ye myddyll mass
and the first and the last mass shall be as it is assygned by him as it
apperyeth by these verses following.

And yet the noble King Henry the fyfte founded two houses of relygyon on is
called Syon beside Braynforde of ye order of Saint Brygf^te both of me^ and
women and on that other side of the River Tamyse an hows of monks of
Chartrehous / in which two places he is contynually prayed for night and day
/ For ever when they of Syon resten than they of the Chaptre house do their
service and in like wise when they of the Chartre house resten the other gooth
to / and by ryngynge of the belles of either place each knows when they have
ended their seruyte which be nobly endowed / and do daily there great alms
deeds / as in Charter house certain children be found to scole. and at Syon
certain alms given daily. And yet beside all this he found a recluse the
which shall be always a priest to pray for him by the said Chartre house which
priest is suffycyently endowed for him and a servant Lo here may all princes
take ensample by this noble prince that reigned so little time not fully.x. year
and did so many noble acts as well for his soul to be perpetually remembered
and prayed for / as in his conquestes and he being in his most lusty aege
dysposyd to eschew sin and was a great Iusticer^ in so much yt all the
princes of crystendome dradde him and also of hethenes / and he had determined
in himself if god would have spared him to have warred on the Sarasyns and for
to know the aid of other princes and all the passages in ye Iourneye he
sent a knight of Henaude named Hugh de lanoye unto Iherusalem / but or he
returned he deyed at Boys de vencence in the.xxxvi. year of his aege. on whose
soul god have mercy Amen.

FElyx the.v. was pope wha^ Eugenyus was deposed.ix. year. This man Felyx was
duke of Sauoyen deuonte prince an old man. and he saw his ckyldes child This
man when he lived a holy life was chosen pope of the counsel of Basyle. and
eugeny was deposed. and there was strife long time. And he had no great
obedience for the deposycyo^ of eugenye: And at the last Eugenye decessed. and
than felyx ^esygned to Nycholas for favor of puas to be had and he was made
legate of France and Cardynal of Sabyanus This was the xxiii. strife bytwyxt
Eugeny and felyx and it dured.xvi^ year and this was a new cause and never seen
before for the counseill of Basyle deposed Eugeny they vere pope and there was
no mo for he obeyed not the decrees of the cou^seyl of Constantinople as they
said ne he charged not to obey the counsyel of basyle: but he said rather the
countrary should be done than as they decreed. wherefore there arose a great
alteracyon in ye matter / for some said one way and some an other and could
not accord to this day for that one party said that cou^^eyll was above the
pope. and an other party said the contrary ye the pope was about the
counsel. But they left it vndetermyned. And therefore god must dyspose for
the best. Albert was Emperor after Syghysmonde one year. this Albert was the
duke of Austre and neuewe to Sygysmonde / and therefore he was king of Beme and
of Vngray for his daughter for other heir he left none. This man was chosen
Emperor of almayne but anon he was poysened and dyed / and he was in althynge
a virtuous man yt all men said he was a presydent to all kings. Fredericus
the third was Emperor after him. this Frederyk was the duke of Osteryk and
chosen Emperor of Almayne but it was long or he was crowned of the pope for
deuysyon. And at the last there was made an unity / and he was crowned with a
great honor of the pope in ye cite and was a peasyble man and a quyete and of
a synguler pity and he hated not the clergy (he wedded the kings daughter of
Portyngale / and in his time whiles that heregned he made a great cu^uocacion
of princes in Ratyspona for the Incours of the Turks / and showed unto them yt
now within this ^xx. year crystendom was made less by two hundred mile. and
he warned them yt they should be ready to resyst him. And the Imperyal cite of
Constantynople was take at ye same time of the mysbyleuynge Turks and betrayed
by a Ianue^s whom for his labor the Turk made a king as he promised him. and
the fourth day he called him to him and did hang him for his dysceyte to
his master. And there was great sorrow and weeping among the christian people
for loss of ye noble Cite / formany a Christian man was slain and innumer able
were sold: and the emperor was slain and for envy the Turk caused his heed
to be smyten of when he was deed^ And almoost all the faith in ye land of
Greek failed. Nycholaus the.v. a Ianueus was pohe after Felyx.viii. year. This
Nycholas was chosen at Rome in the place of Eugenye^ and yet the strife hen
gestyll / by a little and a little they obeyed him and all men merueyled that a
man of so poor a nacyon should obtain against the duke of Sauoy the which was
cosyn and alyed all most to all the princes of crystendoome and euerychone
left him. Than in the year after there was a peace made / felyx resygned for yt
pleased our lord his name to be gloryfyed by an obiecte of the world as that
Ianuens was in comparyson of the duke the pope. This Nycholas was a master
indiuynyte and an actyue man and a rich man in conseytes and many things yt
were fallen he buyldyd again / and al ye walls of Rome he renewed for dred of
the Turk And there was a verse made of this unity and publysshed in the cite.
Lux fulsit mu^do: cessit felix Nychalao. And that in ye year of our lord. M
CCCC.xlix. The year of grace with a great devotion was confermed and
Innumerable people went to the appostels setes.

them lay with a comune woman the night before / and he told to her their
counsel / and she on the morn told it to the Lyuerenaunce which for the

How king Henry wedded queen Margarete. and of her coronacyon.
THis year king henry married at Suthwyk queen Margarete. and she came to

her worshypfully in diverse places. And i^ especial duke of Gloucestre. and on
the Black heth the Mayre with all the alderme^. and all the crafts in blewe
gowns broudred with the deuyse of his craft. yt they might be known met with
her with read hodes and brought her to london. where were diverse page^ris and
countenance of diverse hystoryes showed in diverse places of the City costely.
And the xxx. day of May. the foresaid queen was crowned at westminster and there was
Iustes three days during within the Sayntwary before ye abbaye This year the
pryour of Kylmain apeled therle of Vrmonde of treason. which had a day to
them assygued for to fight in Smythfelde. And the lystes were made and the
field dressed But wha^ it came to point. ye king commanded that they should
not fight. but took the quarrel in to his hand. And this was done at ye
Insta^ce and labors of certain prechers and doctors of london. as master
Gylbert worthyngton person of saint Andrews in Holbron. and other. Also this
year came a great embassate in to England out of france. for to have
concluded a perpetual peace. but in co^clusyon it turned in to trewes for a year
About this time dyed saint Bernardyne a gray friar which began the new
reformacyo^ of the order in many places in so much. yt they. that were
reformed. be^ called Obseruau^tes* which obseruauntes been greatly encreaced in
Italy and in almayn. this Bernardyn was canonysed by pope Nycholas the.v. in
the year of our lord.MCCCC.l. Ioha^nes de Capristrano was his dysciple which
profyted much to the reformacion of that order for god has showed many a
fair miracle. Also here is to be noted. that from this time forward. king
Henry never profyted ne went forward. but fortune began to torn from him on
all sides. as well in france Normandye. Guyon. as in England. so^ men holden
oppynyon that king Henry gave commyssyon preuarly to Sir Edward Hull sir
Robert Roos / Deane of Saint Senerynes and other / to conclude a marriage for
him. with the Earl of Armynakes sister. which was promised as it was said and
concluded / and after broken / and he wedded queen Margarete as before is said
/ and a full dear marriage for the reame of England / for it was know verily /
that for to have her delyuerde was ye duchy of Angeo and the erldom of Mayn
which was the keye of Normandye for the frenssme^ to enter / And about this
the said Markys of Suffolk axed in plain parlement^ a fyftene and an half /
for to fetch her out of france. Loo what a marriage was this as to the
comparyso^ of that other marriage. For there should have be delyuerde. so many
castles and Towns in Guyon / and so much gold should have be yeuen with her
/ that all England should have be thereby enriched / but contrary wise fell
wherefore every great prince ought to keep his promise / For because of brekynge
of this promise / and for marriage of queen Margarete. what loss has the reame
of England had / by lesynge of Norma^dye and Guyon / by dyuysyon in the reame /
ye rebellynge of comyns against there prince and lords / what dyuysyon amoge ye
lords what murdre and sleynge of them / what feldes fought and made / in
conclusyon so many yt many a man has lost his life / and in conclusyon the
king deposed. and the queen with her soon feign to fle into Scotlo^de / and
from thens in to France. and so to Loreyne / the place that she came first
fro. many me^ deem that the brekyngege of the kings promise to the systyr of
the earl of Armynack / was cause of his great loss and aduersy^e.

ye.xxiii. scysme between Eugeny and Felyx. and dured.xvi. year. The cause was
this. the general counseyll of Basyle deposed Eugeny / which was oonly pope
and Indubytyte. for asmoche as he observed not and kept the decrees and
statutes of the counseyll of Constance as it is said before. Nether he rought
not to give obedyence to the gener all counseyll in no manner wise wherefore
arose a great alteracyon among writers of these matere (pro et contra) which
can not accord unto this day / one party says / that the counseyll is above

THis year of our lord. M^cccc. and.l. was the great grace of the Iubyle at

he made a byl of pe^ycyons to the king and his counseyll and showed what
Iniuryes oppressyons the poor comyns suffren and vnd coleur. for to come to

Capytayne with his felshyp and met with them. and fought against them. and in

saying plainly / that they would go unto the Capytayne of kente. to assyste

tresourer of England. and the bishop of Salysbury. and the baron of Dubby. ye
abbot of Gloucestre. Drnyel. and treuilo^. and many mo were traitors. and
worthy to be deed wherefore for to plese the lords meny and also some of the
kings house: ye lord Say was arested and sent to the toure of london. and
then the king he ryuge tidings of the death and over throwenge of the
Staffordes he wythdrew him to london and from thens to kelyng worth / For the
king ne the lords durst not trust the town housholdemen. Then after yt the
capytayne had had this vyctorye upon the Staffordes / anon he took sir

also At which robbyng diverse men of London of their neighbors were at^ and
took part with them / For this robbyng the peples hertes fell from hym^ And
every thryfty men was a ferde / for to be served in like wise. For there was
many a man in London. that a waited and would fayn have seen a common robbery
which almighty god forbid. For it is to suppose if he had not robbyd he
might have goon far / or he had be wythstonde. for the king and all the
lords of the reame of England were departed except the lord. Scalys that
kept the toure of London And the fyfte day of In^ he did do smite of a ma^nys
head in south work. And the night after the mayre of London with the Aldermen

or deed. should have a thousa^de pound. And after this one Alexander yde^ a
squire of kent took him in a garden in suthsex And in taken John^ Cade

horsbacke the which was never vsyd after. For syn that time they have ever
goon by water in botes and barges. ye have well understand before how that
contrary to the promise of the king and also the conclusyons take between the
king and ye duke of york at Brentheth the duke of Somerset went not to ward
but abode about the king / and had great rule / And anon after he was made
Capytayne of Calays. and ruled the king and his reame as he would / wherefore
the great lords of the reame / and also ye comyns were not pleased: For which
cause the duke of york / the earl of warwyke / the earl of Salysbury with many
knights and squyres and much other people came to remeue ye said duke of
Somerset and other fro the king / And the king herynge of their coming /
thought by his counsel for to have gone westwarde and not for to have met
with them. And had with him the duke of Somerset ye duke of Bokyngham the earl
of Stafforde the earl of Northumberlonde \ the lord Clyfforde / and many
other. And what time that the duke of york and his felyshyppe understand /
that the king was departed with the lords from London / anon he changed his
way / and costed the country and came to saint Albons the.xxiii. day of May.
and there met with the king to whom the king sent certain lords / and
desired them to keep the peace / and depart: But in conclusyon why^e they
treated on that one side / the earl of warwyk with the March men and other
entered in to the twone on that other side / and fought against the king and his
party / and so began the battle and fyghtinge which endured a great while /
But in conclusyon the duke of york obtained. and had the vyctory of ye
Iourneye / In which was slain the duke of Somerset / the earl of

made protector of England / and the earl of warwyk Capytayne of Calays / the
earl of Salysbury Chaunceler of England. And all such persons as had the
rule before about the king were set a part / and might not rule as they did
before. And this same year deyed pope Nycholas ye fyfte. and after him was
Calixt the third. This Calixt was a Catalane / and the acts of him shall be
showed here after folowynge^ In this same year fell a great affraye in London
against the Lu^bardes. the cause began / because a young man took a dager from

howses and were in purpoos to have rongen the comyne belle / which is called
bow belle but they let by side men / which came to ye knowledge of the duke
of Bokyngham and other lords. And in contynente they arose / for they durst
no longer abide / for they dowted that the hole Cite should have risen against

the great princes of the land were not called to counseyl but set a part. and
not only so / but it was said through the reame tho said lords should be
dystroyed as it openly was showed at Blorehethe by them yt would have slain

And when they were thus assembled and made their field. the king sent out
commyssyons and preuy seals unto all the lords of his reame to come and wait

him all the soudyours that departed fro the field and made hy^ ready in all the

came he found therle of warwyk therein as Capytayne and the earls of March and
of Salysbury also / and then^e he londed by Scalys and went to gyues and there
he was received / And it fortuned that some of tho ships that came over with

The names of this ylonde. Ca. primo
First as Galfrydus says this land was called Albyne the oldeste daughter
of Dyoclesyan and had.xxxii. systers. And they were first enhabyted this
land. And because she was the oldest sister she named this land Albion after
her own name as ye Cronycle rether seth. Other say that this Land was named
Albion as it were the white land of white rocks about the clyues of the sea
that were sen fro far. After ward Brute conquered this land and called it
Brytayn after his own name. And then Saxons or Englysshmen conquerde this
land and caled yt Anglia that is England Or it is called Anglia of a queen
that owed this land / that was named Angla and was a noble dukes daughter of
the Saxons. Or as ysad scyth Ethy.xv. anglia has that name as it were an
angle and a corner of the world. Or else as Beda says lii.: Saint Gregory
saw English children to sell at Rome and he accorded to the name of the
land. And said they ben southely Angles / for her face chyned as angels / for
the noblyte of the land shone in the childrens faces. Alfre. The Bryteysshe
Anglia is called the other world / and for great plente of all good the
great Charles called in his own Chamber. Solinus The edge of Frensshee clyfe
should be the end of the world / if the ylonde of Brytayne ne were not /
which is worthy to have the name of an other world. Alfry this ylonde is
called insula for yt is in salo / that is the sea / And is beten of with
diverse course of waters with stremes and with wawes of the sea.

Of the setting boundynge lenthe and bread of this land.
THis Brytayne is accounted a noble land both in our stories and also in ye
stories of Greeks. and is set ayenste Germania. Gallia. France and Spain
between the north and the west and the sea between. This land is fyfty mile
from the clyf of the men that be called morini gessiorico. Bedali.i. And for
this ylonde lies under the north head of the world. And it has light and
bright nights in ye somer time. So that of tentyme at mydnyght men have
quastyons and doubt whether it be enyntyte or dawynge / yt is for the time of
ye year that the son goes not far under the earth by night but passes by
the north side and comes soon in to the eest again. And therefore in ye somer
ben their days full long of.xviii. hours and the nyghtes of.vi. hours. And
after in the winter ben long nyghtes of.xviii. hours and short days of.vi.
houres^ Also in Armenia. Macedonia. Italya and in other lands of the same line
the lengest day and lengest night also is of.xv. hours. and the shortest day
or night is of.^x. hours. Plinius in meroe. That ylonde is chyef of black men
/ there is ye lengest day.xii. hours. In Alexandre i^ Egypt of.xiii^ ours in
ytalya of.xv^ hours. In brytayne of.xviii^ hours. In the ylonde named Tyle
all the.vi somer months is day and all the.vi. winter months in night.
Isyd li.xiii. Brytayn is set within Occian as yt were without the world /
and is set against France and Spain. Giraldus. Brytayne in endlonge and
larger in the myddell than in the ends. Orosius. Brytayne stretches in lenth
out of the south in to the north and in the south est it has France / in the
south Spain the north / Nowaye. and in the west Hybernia / that Is yrlonde.
when shyppemen passen the next clyf of that land they se a cite that heet
Rupty mouth. Beda.li.i^ That cite is now called shortly of Englyshmen
Reptacestre / Solinus / Brytayne is.viii. hondreth mile of lenthe and it be
moten fro ye clyf of Totenesse to the angle of Colydon. Alfre That is from
penwith street.xv. mile be yonde Mychels stowe in Cornwayle unto catenesse that
is beyond Scotlo^de and brytayn is more tha^ ^ii.C. mile broad from Meneuia
that is ye vtermest place in wales unto yarmoth in nothfolke. Beda Only out
take the lengest out sherynge of diverse for lands with the which Brytayne is
all about.xlviii. sithe.lxx. thousand paas.

Of ye worthynesse and perogacions. ca. iii.
AS France passes Brytayne so Brytayne passes Irlonde in fair weder and
noblyte but not in health. Beda.li. For this ylonde is best. to bring fort
threes and fruit Rutherne and bestes And wine grows therein in some place.
The land has plente of fowls and of beestes of diverse manner of kind The
land is ple^teuous and the sea also. The land is noble copyous and rich of
noble wells and Ryuers with plente of fysthe. There is great ple^te of small
fysshe of samon and of eeles. wilhel. de. pon.li.iii. So yt the people in some
place feed their swyne with fysshe. Beda li.i. there ben of tentymes taken
Dolphyns. See calves / and Balayne great fysshes / as whales kind. And
diverse manner shelfysshe among the which / shelfysshe been muskles That
within them have Margery peerles of all manner of color and hew of rody and
read purpure and of blewe / and specially and most of white there with fine
read / the rednes there of is wonder fair \ and stable / and stayneth never
with c^ode ne with heet* with wete ne with dry but ever the older the color
is the fayrer ^ There ben also salt wells and hot wells / there of rennynge
stremes of hot bathes departed in to diverse places according. For man and
woman of all manner age old or young. Basilius says. That the water that
renneth and passes by veins of certain metal takes in his course great
hete. This ylonde is plenteuous of veins of metalles^ Bras of iron of leede of
tyn / and of silver also. Plinius li.vi. ca. vi. In this ylo^de under the curfe
of the land is found good merle the thryfty of the fatnes dries him self
therein / So that ever the thycker ye field in merled the better corn it will
bear / There is also a another manner white merle / that the lord is the better
fourscore year that therewith is merled. Solinus In this ylonde grows a stone
that is called Gagates / if ye will know his fayrnesse / it is black as
ge^mes ben / if ye will know his kind / It brenneth water and quenches in
oil and as to his might / if the stone befroted and chaffed It holds what
him negheth as succu^^ a stone yt is so named. ysydorus.li.xv. There was sheep
that beren good wule There ben many hertes and wild beestes and few wulues.
therefore sheep ben the surer without kekynge left in the field. R. In this
ylonde also ben many cytees and towns fair and noble and rich. many great
Ryuers and stremes with great plente of fyshe / many fair wodes and great.
with right many beestes tame and wild. The earth of that land is copyous of
metal oor / And of salt wells of quareyes of Marbyll of diverse manner
stones / of reed of white of soft and of hard / chalk and of white lyme.
There is also white claye and read for to make pottes. crockes / stenes / and
other vessel and brent tyle to cover the houses and chyrches as it were in the
other samya yt is named samos also. Flanddres loves well the wull of this
land. And hollande the skynnes and felles of all manner of beestes. Guyan the
iron and the leed. Irlonde the oor and the salt. Al Europe loves and desires
the whete metal of this land / Alfredus Brytayn has enough of matter that
there needs to bye and sell or is nedelull to man's use / there lacks
neither salt ne iron / Therefore a versefyour in his meter prayseth this land
in to this manner / England is a good land fruytfull of wu^. but it is a
corner England is full of play free men well worthy to play / fre men / free
tongues. free hertes / and free ben all their things. their hand is more free.
and better than their tongue. Also England is beauteous of land flower of
lands all about / that land is full payede with fruit and good of his own.
that land reueleth strange men that has need thereto / And when honger
greueth other loondes that land fedeth them. That land bears fruit and
corn great plente enough / That land is well at ease as long as men live in
peace eeste and west in each land ben known well the hauenes of England / Her
ships foundes and often helps many lands Their mete and money men hather
more common always And for to learn men gladly give gyftos / In land and strong
wide speak men of England. Land honey milk these this ylonde thereof shall
bear the price. This ylonde has no need of other lands. all londos must seek
help at this alone / Of the liking of their woun / might wonder king Salomo^
The riches that there is an. would desire octauyan /

Of the meruayles and wondered ca. iiii.
IN Brytayne ben hot wells well arrayed and adressed to the use of manhood /
masters of thylke wells is the great spyrite minerua In her house the fire
endures always that never changes into asshen / but there the fire slaketh.
it changes into stone clothes^ Alfre. In Brytayn ben many wondres Nevertheless
four ben most wonderful / the first is at Peton there blows so strong
wind out of the chynes of the earth yt it casts up again ^lothes that me^
cast therein. The second is at Stonhenge besides Salesbury there ben great
stones and wonder huge. and ben teten on high as it were yates set upon
other yates Nevertheless it is not konwen clearly ne apperceyued how and
wherefore they be^ so arered and so wonderful honged. The third is at
Cherdboke there is a great holownes under the earth often many me^ have seen^
Ryuers and stremes But no where can they find none end The fourth is that
rayn is seen raised upon hills and none yspronge about in the feldes. Also
there is a great pound that contained.lx. ylondes couenable for men to dwell
in that ponde is beclypped about with syx score Roches and upon every roche an
egles neste and th^e score Ryuers rennen into that ponde. And none of them all
run into the sea but one / There is a ponde closed about with wall of tyle
and of stone. In that ponde men wasshe and bathe right often. and every man
feleth the water hoote or cold right as he will him self. There be^ salt
wells far from the sea and been salt all the weke long unto saterdaye at
none unto monday The water of these wells when it is soden torneth into small
salt fair and white Aso there is a ponde the water there of has wonder
werkynge. For though all an hooste stood by the ponde and turned their face
thither ward the water would draw him vyole^tly toward the ponde and wete
all their clothes / So should horse be drawn in the same wise. And if the
facebe turned a way fro the water the water noyeth not. There is a well that
no streme renneth fro ne neither thereto and yet four manner of fysshe be taken
there in. ye well is but xx. foot long and xx. foot broad And bears no
great depte but to the knee / And closes with high banks on every side. In
the country about wynchestre is a den or a cave / out of ye cave blows al
way a strong wind / so that no man may endure to stand to fore yt. den or
cave. There also is a ponde yt torneth tree in to iron if it be there in a year.
And so trees ben shapen in to whestones. Also there is in the top of an
hylle buryels every man that comes and meteth that buryell / he shall find it
even of his own lenth and mesure^ And if a pilgrim knele thereto anonr he
shall be all fresshe and feel no gryef of werynes. Git in^ top. Fast be the
mynstre of wynburney that is not far fro bathe is a wood that bears much
fruit / if the trees of that wood fall in to water or ground yt is nyghe and
lie there all a year. the trees tornen i^ to stones. Giritenere. Under the Cite
of Chestre renneth ye Ryuet Dee^ now departs England and wales. That River
changed every month his lords as men of the country tellen and leueth often
the channel / but whether the water draw more to ward England or to ward
wales to what side yt it be. that year men of yt side have the worst end and
over set. And men of ye other side shall have better end and be at their
above when the water so changes his course yt bodeth such happes. This River
Dee renneth and comes out of a lake yt heet. Pymblemere. in this River is
great plente of samon / nevertheless in the lake is never samon founden. will
held re le ii. Take heed how great light and bryghtnesse has been showed upon
Englysshme^ sithe they first turned to right believe. So that of no men in any
prouynce ben founden so many hole bodies of men after her death in sykenes of
euerlastyngnes yt shall be after the day of dome / as it well seems in these
holy Saints as Edeldrede / Edmonde / the king Elphege: Edgar Cutberde and
saint Edward and many other I trow yt it bedoo by a special grace of god
almighty for ye nacyon that is set as it were without the world take heed to
burye^ge of bodies without corrupcyo^ and rotynge / and ben the more bold and
steadfast for to trust on the fynall arysynge of deed dodyes for to last
evermore after the day of dome.

Of the chyef parties of ye same land. ca. v.
AFter the first Brutes time the ylonde of Brytayne began for to have the
pryncypall parties / that been Loegria Cambria that is that wales. And Albania
yt is now Scotlonde Loegria has that name of Locrinus that was Brutes oldest
sone / and heet / loegria as it were. Locrinus land / but now Loegrin is
called England. The bounds and Marks were there of sometime the Frensshe see
boothe by eest and by southe. Beda.li.i. ca. ii. And by north two arms of the sea that breketh far in to the land either against other But they reche not
together / The eest arm of thylke tweyne begins about a two little mile fro
the mynstre of Ebburcurynge. In the weste side of Penulton in that arm is a
town / that is called Guydy. the west arm of thylke tweyne has in the right
side a strong Cite that heet Alclyued which in their la^gage is called Clint
stone and stondeth upon a river yt is called Clynt also. R. Some men would mean
that Loegria ends at Humbre and stretches no ferther north ward. The
second party of Brytayne is caleo Albinia that is Scotlonde and has that
name of Albinactus Brutes sone and stretches fro the foresaid two arms of the sea north ward unto these of Norwaye. Nevertheless the south parties of
Albania where as pyetes dwelled sometime that lies from the water of twede
unto the Scottesshe see. All yt longed sometime to the kyngedome of
Northumberlonde Brenycorne the north sade of Northumberlonde fro the first time
of English king to that time when Kynadius king of Scotlonde that was
Alpinus sone did a way the Pyctes and so Joined that country to the kingdom of
Scotlonde. The^ third party of Brytayne is wales walia that heet Cambria also
/ and has that name Cambria of Cambre Brutes sone / for he was prince of
wales. In the eest side Seurnee departed some time between England and wales.
But in the north side the River of Dee atchestre and in the southe ye River
that is named Vaga at ye castle of Srygelyn departs England and wales. All
so king Offa for to have a dystynccyon for evermore between the kings of
England and of wales made a long dyche that dretched for the out of the
southe side by Brystowe under the hills of wales Seuerne and Dee almost to
the heedes and unto the mouth of the River of Dee beyond Chestre fast by the
castle it reenneth between Colehyll and the mynstre of Basyngwercke into the sea. This dytthe is yet in many places seen In saint Edwardes time walsshmen
should not pass that was at Earl Haroldes procuring as it shall be said
here after. but now in either sides both ayonde half and a this half the dyche
and specially in the shyres of Chestre of Shrowesbury and of Herforde in many
places been Englysshemen and walsshmen meddled togyders.

Of the ylondes that been thereto adjacent. Capitulo. vi.
BRytayne has three ylondes that been night and longing thereto all without the
ylondes Orcades / as it were answering to the three chyef partys of Brytayne.
For the isle of wyghte longs and lies to Leogrya that is England. The ylonde
Mon that is called Angleseya also longs to wales / and the ylonde Enbonia
that has two other names and is called Meneuia and Man also which longs to
Scotlonde. And all these three ylondes wight Mon and Man ben almoost alyke much
and the quantyte / of the which three all arowe follows our speech. Beda.li.i.
ca. iii^ Claudius sent Vespasianus. and Vespasianus wa^ne wight / And wight
stretches out of the eest in to ye west.xxx. mile long. And out of the south
in to the north.xii. mile / and is in the eest side.vi. mile fro the south
clyfe of Brytayne. And three mile fro the west side. Beda.li.iiii ca. v. The
mesure of this ylonde as Englysshmen guess is a thousand heusholders and two
hundred. Gir. in itinere. mon that is called. Angleseya also his departed from
north wales by a short arm of the sea as it were two mile broad. In Mon ben
three hundred towns.lx.iii. And ben accounted for Ca^dredes that been.iii.
hondredes. The ylonde is as it were.xxx. my^e long and.xii. mile broad
Candredus is so much land as conteyneth an hundred towns / that name
candredus is made out of two langages of Brytysshe and of Irysshe In praysynge
of this ylonde walsshmen were wont to say a proverb and an old saw. Mon
Mankembri / that is to say in English that land is so good that it seems
that it would find corn enough for all the men of wales. Therefore Virglys
verses may be according thereto / as much as guawes / bestes long Inneth
dawes So much efte brings cold dew in a night In that arm of the sea
that departed this land and north wales / is a swolowe that that draws
ships to it that sayleth by and swoloweth them in ryyght as does. Cylla and
Carybdis that been two peryllous places in the sea of myddel earth. Therefore men
may not sayll by this swalowe but slyly at full see. R. Of the merueylles and
wondres of the ylonde of Mon thou shall find in the chapter of wales. Gir. in
itinere. The third ylonde that is called both Eubonia and Meneuia that is
Manstondeth in the myddell between the Irysshe vlstere and the Scottesshe galle
way as it were in the navel of the sea. Beda.iiii. ca. ix. This ylondes. The
first is southe ward the more condtree. And the better corn land and
conteyneth.ix. hundred and.^x. housholdes^ The secon^e conteyneth the space
of.CCC. and moo as Englysshmen guess. Gir. in ^op: Sometime was stryf whether
this ylonde Man should long to Brytayne or to Irlonde and for as much as
venomous worms that were brought thither ly^ed there / It was Iuged that the
ylonde of Man should long to Brytayne. R. In that ylonde is ^ortylege and
which craft used. Fer women there selle to shypme^ wind as it were closed
under three knottes of threde. So that more wind he will have the moo knottes
he must undo. Chere often by day time men of that land seen men that be^
deed to fore hand byheded or hoole and what death they deyed. Alyens set
their fete upon feeet of the men of that land for to see such syghtes as the
men of that land done. Beda.li.ii. Scotts dwelled first in this ylonde
Thanatos that is Tenet and is an ylonde besides Kente o and has that name
Thanatos of death of serpe^tes for there be^ none. And ye earth thereof sleeth
serpe^tes yborn in other lo^des. There is noble corn lord and fruyt^u^. It is
supposed that this ylonde was hallowed and blessed of saint Austen the first
doctoure of Englysshmen for there he arrived fryste.

Of the kenges hye ways and streets. ca. vii.
MOlyuncyus king of Brytons^ was the / xiii. of them and the first that ga^
them law. He ordained that plowmen folowes / goods laws and high ways
that let den men to Cytees and towns should have the fredom of color so yt
every man that went to any of them for socour or for trespaas that he has
should be saufe for poursute of all his enemies. But afterward for the ways
were uncertain and stryf was had^ Therefore Belinus the king that was the
forfayd Moliuncius sone for to put a way all strife and doubt / made four
high kings ways preuyleged with all preueylege and fredome And the ways
stretche thrughe the ylonde. The first and gretest of all the four ways is
called Fosse and stretches out of the south in to the north and begins
from the corner of Cornewayle and passes forth by Deuenshyre by Somersete
and forth be sides Tetbury upon Cotteswolde beside Couentre unto Leycestre /
and so forth by wild playnes toward Newarke and ends at Lyncoln. The
second chyfe kings high way is named watlyngstrete and stretches thwarte
over Fosse out of the southeest in to ye norwest and begins at Dover and
passes by the myddell of Kente over Temse beside London by westmestre and so
forth by saint Albon in the west side by donstaple by Scratforde by Towcetre
by wedo^ by southe Lylleborn by Atheryston unto gylbertes hylle that now is
called wrekene and forth by Seuarne and passes besides wrokcestre / and
then^e forth to Stratton and so forth ay the myddell of wales unto Cardyka^
and ends at Irysshe see. The third way is called Erynnugestrete and
stretches out of the west nor weste in to the eest southeest / and begins
in Meneuia that is saint Dauyds land in west wales and stretches forth unto
Southampton: The fourth is called. Rykenylstrete and stretches forth by
worochestre by wycombe and by Brymyngeham by Lechefelde by Derby by
Chestrefelde by york and forth unto Tynmouthe.

Of the famous Ryuers and stremes. ca. viii.
THere ben three famous Ryuers renayn^e through Brytayne by ye which three
Ryuers merchants of beyond ye see coumen in ships into Brytayn wellnygh
out of all manner of nacyons and lo^des. These three Ryuers ben Temse. Seuarne
and Humbre The sea ebbeth and flows at these three Ryuers and departs the
prouynces of the ylonde as it were the three kyngdoms asondre. The three parties
ben Loegria. Cambria / and Northumbri^ That been myddel England: wales. and
Northumberlonde. R. These name Temse seems made one name of two names of two
ryuers that been Tame and yse for the River of T^me renneth besides Dorchestre
and falls in yse / therefore all the River fro the first heed unto the eest
see is named Tamyse or Temse begins besides Tetbury that is three mile by
north Malmesbury. There the Temse spryngeth of a well that renneth eest ward
and passes the Fosse and departs Glocestre shyre and wylshyre / and draws
with him many other wells and stremes and wexeth great at grecestre and
passes forth than toward Hampto^ and so forth by Oxenforde by wallynforde by
Riding and by London. Wilhelmus de pon. ca. ii. At haven of Sandwhyche it
fas^eth in to ye eest see / and holds his name.xl. mile beyond London / and
departs in some place Kente and Essex westsex and Mercia that is as it were a
great dele of myddell England. R. Seuarne is A River of Brytayne and is called
Habern in brytons / and has that name Habern of Habern that was Estryldes
daughter Guendolon the queen drenched this Habern therein / therefore the Brytons
called the River Habern after the woman that was drowned therein / by corrupt
latin it is called Sabria Seuarne in English. Seuarne begins in the
myddell of wales and passes first to ward the eest unto Shrowesbury / and
then^e turned south ward unto Bryggenorthe wyrcestre and Gloucestre and
falls in to the west see besides Brystow and departs i^ some place England
and wales. wilhel de pon.li.iii. Sauerne is swyft of streme / fysshe carft is
therein / wodenes of the swolowyng and of ye whyrlynge water casts up and
gadre to hepe great hepes of grauel Seuarne often aryseth and ouerfloweth the
ba^kes R: Hu^bre has ye name of Hu^bre king of. hunes. for he was drownde there
in. and ren^eth first a croke out of ye southsyde of york / and then it
departed ye prouynce of Lyndese ye ye longed sometime to ye merces from ye other
contre northu^berlonde Trente and Ous rennen in to Hu^bre and make^ the River

Of ancient cytees and towns. ca. ix.
THe kingdom of Brytayne was sometime made fair with.xxviii. noble cytees
without right many castles that were walled with toures with yates and with
bars strongely builded. After these were the names of the cyteis. Caerlud
that is London Caerbra^k that is york / Caerkent that is Caunterbury
Taergoraukon that is worchestre. Caerlyryon that is / leycestre. Caerclon that
is Gloucestre Caercolde^ that is Colcestre Carray that is / chichestre. Saxons
called it sometime Cyssoncestre: carcery that is Cyrcerre / caergunt that is
wynchestre. Caergraunt that is / cambrygge caerleyll that is / lugibalia and
Karlylle. Caerporis that is Porchestre. caerdrom that is Dorchestre.
Caerludcoyt that is / lyncoln and. Lyndecolyn. Caermarthyn that is Merlyns Cite
/ cersege^t that is Sicestre and his upon te^se not fer from redynge leon that
is / caerlegeon also and hyghte first Legecestre and now is named Chestre
Caerbathon that is bathe. and hight sometime Athamanus Cite Caerpaladour that is
Septon that now hight Shaftesbury. R. Other cytees ben found in Chronicles for
understanding of stories / of whom it shall follow. Will de pon. London is a
ryal and a rich Cite upon. Tamyse. of burgeysses of riches of merchants of
cha^^are and of marchaundyse. Therefore it is that some time when derth of
vytayls is in all England comuly at London it is best chepe because of the
buyers and selles that been at London. Gaufre Brute the first kyynge of Brytons
build and edefyted this cite of London the first cite of London the fyryste
cite in remembrance of the cite of Troy that was distroyed and called it
Troy newich and triuantum that is new Troy After ward king Lud called it
Caerlud after his own name. Therefore the Brytons had indygnacyon as Gyldas /
tells Afterward Englysshemen called the cite London / and yet after ye
Normans called it Londers and is named in latin lo^donia Rudhudybras king /
leyles sone. was the.viii. king of Brytons / and he builded Canterbury ye
chyefeyte of Kent called it Caerkent. Afterward Englysshemen called it
Dorobernia / but yt is not Dover that stondeth upon ye clyf of ye Frensshe see
and from shis dover.xxii. English mile. After ward this Dorobernia was and
is called Caunterbury. The same king. Rudhudibrys builded wynchestre. and
called it Caergue^t and after Englysshme^ called it went and wynchestre after
ye name of one an English man that was bishop there All westsaxo^ was subget
to him ye same king builded paladour that is Septo^ that now is called
Shaftesbury Brytons telle^ that an Egle prophesied there sometime. Bladud.
Leyles sone a Nygramancer was the.ix. king of Bryto^s / he builded Bathe and
called it Caerbathon. Englyssmen called it after Athamannus cite. But at the
last men called it Bathonia that is Bath. Wilhell. depon.li.ii. in this cite
welleth up and spryngeth hot Bathes and me^ wene that Julius Cezar made there
such bathes. R. But Gaufre ^ monute^sis i^ his Brytons book / says that
Bladud made thylke bathes because wyllyam has not seen that brytysshe book
wrote so by telli^ge of other me^ / or by his own gessynge as he wrote other
things not best auysedly. Therefore it seems more sothely that Bladud made not
ye hot bathes Ne Julius Cezar did such a deed though bladud builded and made
the Cite. but it accords better to kyndely reason that ye water re^ne the in
ye earth by veins of brymstone and sulphur and so it is kyndely made hoot in
that course and spryngeth up in diverse places of ye cite. And so there be^
hoote bathes that wassheth of ^e^es soores skabbes / Treuisa. Though men might
by craft make hoote bathe for to endure long enough / this accords well to
reason and to philosophy that treats of hot wells and bathes that be^ in
diverse lo^des though ye water of this bathe be more trobly and soruer of
savor and of smell tha^ other hot bathes been that I have seen at Akon in
Almayne. And eyges in Sauoye / which ben fair and clear as any well streme I
have be^ bathed therein and assayed them. R. Claudius / cezar married his
daughter to Aruiragus king of Brytons. This Claudyus Cezar builded Gloucestre
in the wedding of his doughter^ Brytons called this cite frist after Claudius
name but afterward it was called Gloucestre after one gloria which was duke
of ye country and stondeth upon Seuarne in the march of England and wales.
Shrowesbury a cite upon Sauarne in the march of England and wales set upon
the top of an hylle / and it is called / Shrowesburye of shrobbes and fruit
that grew there sometime on ye hylle / Brytons called it sometime Pengre wene yt
is ye head of a fair tree Shrowesbury was sometime the head of powesye ^
stretches forth thwarde over ye mydell of wales unto ye Irysshe see Notyngam
stondeth upon Trence and sometime heet Notyngham yt is the won^ynge of den^es /
for ye Danes dwelled there sometime and dygged dens and caves under hard
stones and rokes and dwelled there. R. Lyncolyn is cheyf of the prouynce of
Lyndeseye and was called sometime Caerlud coit and after ward Lyndecoln. It is
uncertain who builded first this cite but if yt were king Lud / and so it
seems by menynge of the name / for the Caer is brytysshe and is to say a cite
and a coit is a wood and so it seems ye Caerlud coit is to say Luddes wode
town King leyr^ was Bladuddes son and builded Leybestre / as it were in ye
myddell of England upon the River Sos and upon Fosse the kings bye wyye.

wylhel. de pon.li.iii.
York is a street cite in either side of the water of Ouse yt seemed as fair as
Rome unto ye tgme yt the king wy^liam had with bre^nynge and fire defoulde it
and ye coo^tre about. So yt a pilgrim would now weep and h^ saw it / if he
had known it tofore. Gaufre. Ebraneus ye.v. king of brytons builded york and
called it after his own name Caerbranck he baylded also two other cytees one
in scotlond and is called Edinburgh and an other toward Scotlond in thend of
England and called Edinburgh / and an other toward Scotlond in thend of
England and is called Alcliud. R. Edenburth is a cytee in ye land of Pictes
between ye River of Twede and the scottesshe see and hee^ sometime the castle
of Maidens and was called afterward Edinburgh of Edan king of Pictes ye reigned
there in eg^ridus time king of Northu^ber^ond. Alcliud was sometime a noble cite
/ and is now well nygh unknow to all Englysshmen. for under ye Brytons and
pyctes and Englysshmen it was a noble cite to ye coming of ye Danes. But after
ward about the year of our lord ^viii.c.lxx. it was destroyed when ye danes
destryed ye countries of Northu^berlo^d. but i^ what place of Brytayn ye cite
Alcliud was builded. Ductours telle^ dyuersely Beda.li.i. says yt it was
builded by west ye arm of ye see yt departed between the Bryto^s and the
Pyctes sometime there Souerus ^amous wall ends westward / and so it seems by
him that it is not fer from Caerleyl for ye cite is set at ye end of that
wall. Other writers of stories written yt the cite of Alcliud is ye cite that
now is caled Alo^burgh / yt is to say an old town / and stands upon ye
River Ous not fer fro barghbrydge / yt is.xv. mile westward out of york / and
it seems yt he preueth that by Gaufride in his book of deeds of Brytons / he
writes yt Elidurus king of bryto^s was lodged at ye cite Alcliud because of
solace and hu^tynge / and found his brode^ Argalon maskynge in a wode nygh
there beside that hight Calatery / but that wood Calatery which is caltres i^
english recheth almost to york and stretches toward ye north by Aldburgh
in length by space of.xx. mile / ye most dele of that wode is now drawn down
and ye lord ytylled other me^ would suppose that Alcliud was ye cite that now
is called Burgham in the north country of westmerlonde fast by Comberlond / and
stadeth upon the River Eden / the cite is there wonderly seen. Deem ye now
where it is builded. Treuysa. It is not hard to assoyle if men take heed / ye
many towns bear one name / as Cartage / in Africa and Cartago in spayn. new
port in wales and Newporte in the parysshe of Barkeleye / wottonne under /
egg and wotton passes / wyk warwyk pain. and wyk in the parysshe of
Barkelye. And two shyre town eythere is called Hampton / as Southampton and
Northehampto^ so it seems by ye stories ye one Alcliud was in yorkshyre / an
other i^ westmerlonde / and one fast by ye right side of ye west arm of the sea yt departs England and Scotlonde / but ye Alcliud was a right strong
cite as Beda says. and ye cite stands fast by a River yt is called Cliud.
and there is no such River i^ yorkshyre in westmer land as of the country tell
me. Some men say yt the River Cliud is now named sulwach. Sulwa^che is but.v.
mile fro Caerleyl which is a cite in the country of nor^h Enlonde toward ye
north west and has an other name which is Luguball. Leyil ye.vii. king of
bryto^s builded caerleyll. R. In this cite is so^what of ye famous wall yt
passes northu^berlo^de. wilhel. de pon. in this cite is yet a the^ chambred
house made of vawt stones yt never might be destroyed with tempeste of weder ne
with brennynge of fire / also in the country fast by westmerlo^de in the
front of a three chanbre place is written in this manner / Marii. victory /
what this writtinge is to say I doubt somewhat but if it were some of the
Combres lay here some time when the counseyll Marius had put him out of ytalye
/ But it seems better yt it is written in mind of Marius king of brytons that
was Aruiragus sone / This marius overcome in that place Roderyke king of
pyctes So says Gaufre in his brytysshe book / Wyllyam malmesbury saw never
that book At Hagustaldes church is a place.lxxx. mile / out of york Nor
westewarde the place is as. were dystroyed / so says wylhel / li.iii. de pony.
That place longed sometime to the bysshopryche of york / there were sometime
houses with vice arches and voutes in the manner of Rome / Now that place is
called Hestoldeshame and heglesham also / Beda.li.iii. ca. i. says Than that
place is fast by the long wall of the work of Rome in the north half / R /
There is dyfference between the pryuynce of Lyndeffare and the church
Lyndefarne / For the prouynce of Lyndeffare and Lyndeseye is all one / and
lyethe by eest lyncolne and lyncolne is the head thereof / of the which says
Beda.li.iiii. ca. xi. that Sex wulfus was first bishop there / but
Beda.li.iiii. ca. xiii says / That lyndeffar church is an ylonde that is
called holy ylonde in the river of Twede next Barwyke And so it is gadred of
Bedaes sawes that twede renneth in to the famous arm of the sea yt now
departed Englysshme^ and Scotts in ye eest half and in that arm be^ three
ylondes. that one is Maylros that now is called menros / Then^e about toward
the west is Lyndeffarn church that is called holy ylonde / Then the church
is above upward and his the Ilondefarn and is called also ferny ylonde. Then
up ward about that two mile is a ryall Cite upon the brynke of twede / that
sometime hight Bebanburgh that is Bobbes cite and now is called Bamburgh and
has a right strong castle. Gir. initenere / two cytees there ben either is
called Charlegyon and caerleon also one is Demycia in south wales that is named
caeruske / also there the River of Vske falyeth into Seuerne fast by glamorgan
Bellynus king of Brytons sometime buyled the city and was sometime the chyef
cite of Demecya in south wales. Afterward in Claudius cezar^ time it was
called the cite Legyons when at prayer of Genius the queen Vespiciauus and
Aruiragus were accorded and / legyons of Rome were sent in to Irlonde. tho was
Caerleon a noble cite and a great auctoryte / and by the Romans ryally builded
and walled about with walls of brent tyle. Great nobley that was there in
old time is there yet in many places seen as the great palayses gyauntes
toures noble bathes / releef of the temples places high and ryall to stand
and syte in / and to behold about the places were ryally closed with ryall
walls that yet somdele stondeth right nyghe cloos / And within the walls and
without is great building under earth / water conduytes and ways under earth
and stews Also thou shall see wonderly made. with strayte side ways of
brethynge that wonderly cast up heete. In this City were sometime three noble
chyrches. one was of saint Julius the martyr and therein a great company of
vyrgynes that other was of saint Aaron that was of the order of black Chanon
that church was right nobly adourned / The third church was the chyf mother
church of all wales and the chyef se. But afterward the chyef see was turned
out of the cite into meneuya that is saint Dauyds land in west wales. In this
Caerleon was amphybalus born thaught saint Albon There the messagers of Rome
come to great Arthurs court. if it is leefull to trow. Treuisa. if Giraldus
was in doubt whether it were leefull for to trow or not ^ yt were a wonder
showing as men would went for too have evermore in mind and ever be in
doubt if all his books were such what lord were therein and namely while he
makes none euydence for in neither side he tells what meueth him so to R.
There is another cite of Legyons there his Chronicles were by trauaylled as it
is clerly known by the first chapter of this book Treuysa. That is to
understanding in ye latin wryttynge. For he yt made it in latin turned it not
into English ne it was turned into Englisshe in the same place yt it was
first in latyn^ The understanding of him yt made this Chronicles is thus the
begnnyng of this book. Presentem cronicam compliauit frater Ranulphus
Cestre^sis monachus. That is to say in English. Brother Ranuiphe monk of
Chestre conpyled and made this Book of the Chronicles / R. The of Legyons that
is chestre stondeth in ye march of England toward wales between two arms of
the sea yt been namedde and Mersee \ This City in time of Brytons was heed and
cheyf cite of all Venedocia / that is North wales The fou^der of this cite is
vnknowen^ For who that sees the fou^dementes of the great stones would rather
wene that it were Romans work or wercke off Gyauntes / than it were set by
werkynge of Brytons. This cite sometime in brytysshe speech heet Caerthleon
Legecestria in latin And Chestre in Englisshe and the cite of Legyons also /
Forther delay a winter the legyons of knyghten that Julius Cezar sent for to win Irlonde. And after Claudius cezar sent legyons out of that cite for to win the ylonde that be called Orcades / what ever wyllyam Malmeshury by
telling of other men mente of this cite. This cite has plente of lyuelode of
corn of flesh of fysshe / and specially of price of samon / This city
receives much marchaundyse and sends out also. Also nyghe this cite ben
salt wells. metell and oor / Nor thumbres dystroyed this cite sometime / But
after ward Elfleda lady of Marcia builded it again and made it much more. In
this same cite ben ways under the earth with vowtes and stone work wonderly

fyftene North and Eest shyres were sometime governed and ruled by the law
called Mercia in latin and marchene in English It is to wit that york shyre
stretches from the River of Humbre unto the River of Teyse / And yet in york
shyre ben.xxii. hondredis. hundred and candredes is all one. Candrede is one
word made of walsshe and Irysshe / and is to menynge a country that
conteyneth an hundred towns And also in English called wepentake. For
sometime in the coming of a new lord tenauntes were wont to yield up their
wepen instede of homage. Duram shyre stretches from the River of Teyse unto
the River of Tyne. And for to speak proprely of Northumberlonde it stretches
fro the River of Tyne unto you River of Twede. That is in the beginning of
Scotlonde. Then if the country of Northumberlonde that was sometime from
Humbre unto Twede be now a counted for one ^hyre and one Erledome as it was
sometime. Then^e ben in England but.xxxii. shyres. but if the country of

De legibus legu^que vocabilis:
DVnwallo that hyghte Molliuncius also made first laws in Brytayne the which
laws were called Moleuncius laws and were solempnely observed unto wyllyam
Conquerours time. Moliuncius ordained among his laws that Cytees Temples and
ways that leden men thereto / and plowe men solowes should have preuelege and
fredome for to save all men that fle thereto for socoure and refuge. Then
afterwade Mercia queen of Brytons that was Gwytelynus wife of her ye prouynce
had the name of Mercia as some man suppose. She made a law fulle of wit
and of reason / and was called Merchene law. Gildas that wrote the Chronicles
and hystores. of the Brytons turned these two laws out of Bryton speech in to
latin. And afterward king Aluredus turned all out of latin in to Saxons
speech / and was called marchene law also the king Aluredus wrote in
English and put to an other law that hight westsaxon law Then afterward
Danes were lords in this land / and so came forth the third law that heet
Dane law. Of these three laws saint Edward the third made one commune law
yt yet is called saint Edwardes law. I hold it well done to write here and
expowne. many terms of these laws Myndebrugh hurtynge of honor and worship.

Of kingdoms of bounds and marks between them. ca. xii.
THe kingdom of Brytayne stood without departing hoole and all one kingdom
to the Brytous from the first Brute unto Julius Cezars time / and fro Julius
Cezars time unto seuerus time this land was under trybute to the Romans.
Nevertheless kings they had of the same land from Seuerus unto the last
prince Gracyan successors of Brytayne failed and Romans reigned in Brytayne
Afterward the Romans left of their regnynge in Brytayne by cause it was
far from Rome / and for great business that they had in other side /
Then^e Scotts and Py^tes by mysledynge of Maximus the tyraunte pursewed
Brytayne and warred there with great strength of men of arms long time unto
the time that the Saxons come at the prayenge of the Bretons against the Pyctes
and put out Gurmonde the Irysshe king with his Pyctes and the Brytons also
with herus king that hyet Careticus and drose hem out of England in to wales
/ and so the Saxons were vyctours and every prouynce after his strength made
him a king. And so departed England in seven kingdoms. Netheles afterward
these seven kingdoms euerychone after other came all in to one kingdom. All
hole under the prince Adelstone Netheles the Danes pursewed this land fro
Adelwolfys time that was Aluredes fader unto the third saint Edwardes time
about a hundred.lxx. year that reigned contynuelly therein.xxiii. year and a
little more. and after him Haralde held the kyngedome.ix. months. And after
him Normans have reigned unto this time. But how long they shall regne he
woote to whom no thing is unknown. R. Of the foresaid seven kingdom and her
marks mares and bounds when they began and how long they endured here shall
I some what shortly tell. Alfre. The first kingdom was the kingdom of Kent.
that stretches fro the Eest Occyan unto the River of Tamyse. There reigned the
first Hengistis and began to regne by the acomptynge of Dyonyse ye year of our
lord a hundred.lv that kingdom dured three hundred and.lviii. year.iv. kings
unto the time that Baldred was put out and Egbert king west Saxon Joined ye
kingdom to his own the second kingdom was at soutsaxon that had in the Eest
side Kent. in the south the sea and the yele of wight / in the weste Hampshyre
/ and in the Northsothery there Ella reigned first with his three sons / and
began to regne the year after the coming of the Angles even.xxx. but that
kingdom within short time passed into the other kingdoms. The third
kingdom was of Eestsaxon / and had in ye eest side the sea / in the weste the
country of London / in the southe Temse and in the North southfolke. The kings
of this country of westsaxon fro the first. Sebertes time unto the time of
the Danes were.x. kings yt which were subgect somdele to other kings.
Nevertheless of te^^e and lengeste they were under the Kings of Mercia and unto
that time that Egberte the king of westsaxon Joined that kyngedome to his
own. The fourth kingdom was of Eest Angels and conteyneth Northfolke and
Southfolke / and had in the eest side / and in ye North side the sea / and in
the Northwest Cambrygeshyre / in the weste saint Edmondes dyche and
Herfordshyre / and in the south Estsex And this kingdom dured under twelve
kynhes unto the time that king Edmonde was slain. And then the Danes took
wrongfully both the kingdoms of eest Angels and of eestsaxon Afterward the
Danes were put out and driven away or made subget. And then the elder king
Edward Joined both the kyngdoms to his own. The fyfte kingdom was of
westsaxon and dured lengest of all the kingdoms / and had in the Eestsyde
southsaxon / in the north Tamyse / in the south and in the west yt see occean.
In ye kingdom reigned Serdryd with his sone Kenryk. and began to regne the year
of our lord five hundred and.xx. And then after ye coming of Angels.lxxi. so
says Denis the other kyngdoms passed in to this kingdom. The syxt kingdom
was of Mercia and was grettest of all. The marks and the meres thereof were in
the west side of the River Dear fast by Chestre and Seuarne fast by
Shrowesbury unto bristowe. in the eest ye eest see in the south Tamyse unto
london / in the north the River of Humber. and so westwarde and downwarde unto
the River Merse unto the corner off wyrhall. there Humbre falls into the west
see Penda wybbes sone reigned fyste in this kyngedome in the year of our lord
Ihesu Christ.vi. houndred.xxvi. so says Denis and fro the coming of Angels an
ho^dred.lxxv. year. This kingdom dured under.xviii. kings about two
hundred.lxiii. year. unto the last Colwulf the Danes betoke that kingdom to
keep wha^ burdred the king was put out. But the elder Edward the king put
out the danes and ^oyned the kingdom of Mercia to his own kyngedome. Netheles
at the beginning this kingdom of mercia was departed into three / in the west
mercia. in myddell mercia. and eest Mercia. The.vii. kingdom was Northamhym
broru^. that is the kingdom of Northumberlo^de. the meres and Marks thereof
were by west. and by eest the sea of Occian. by southe the Ryuere of Humbre and
so downwarde to ward the weste by the end of the shyres of Notyngha^ and of
Derby unto the River of merce and by north the Scotts see. that heet forth in
Scottesshe see in English. This kingdom of northumberlonde was first deled
in two prouynces. That one was the southe side and heet / Deyra and that other
was the North side and heet Brenycia / as it were two kingdoms and the River
departed these two kingdoms that time. for the kingdom of Deyra was from the
Ryuere of humbre unto the River of tyne The kingdom of Brenycia was fro Tyne
to the Scottysshe see. And when Pyctes dwelled there as Beda says.li.iii. cap.
ii. That Nynya^ that holy man converted men of the south side Ida the king
reigned there first and began to regne the year of our lord five hundred.xlvii.
so says Dyonyse. In Deyra reigned king elle the year of our lord five
hundred.xlix. These two kingdoms were other while as it is said departed
between two kings and sometime all hoole under one king. and dured as it
were.xx. English kings.ccc.xxi. year / At last Osbertus and Elle were
slain in the.ix. year of her kingdom the Danes slew them and
Northumberlonde was void without king.viii. year / Then afterward the danes
reigned in Northumberlonde.xxxvi. year unto the oonynge of the kingdom
Adelstone. he made subgecte the kings Danes Scottesshe and walshe and reigned
first allone in England and held the kingdom of England all hole and one
kingdom that was the year of our lord viii.C.xxviii. That River of Merse was
sometime the mark and were between the kingdom of Northumberlonde / that may be
showed in two manners first by this properte of this merse / is as much to say
as a see that is abound and a mere for it departed one kingdom from an otheri
Also it is written in Chronicles of Henry and Alfrede that king Edward ye
elder fastened a Castle at Mamcestre in Northumberlonde / but that City
mamcestre is from ye River of merse scarsely three mile.

Of bysshpryches and their sees. ca. xiii.
LVcius was the first king crystened of the Brytons. in his time were three
Archebysshops sees in Brytayne. one was at London / an other at york / And
the third at Caerusk the cite of / legeons in Glamorgan / that cite is now
called Caerleon / To these Archebysshoppes sees were called Flammes To the
Archebysshops see of / london was subget Corn wayle and all myddel England
unto humbre / To york all Northumberlonde from the bow of Humbre with all
Scotlonde to Caerbeon all wales. there were in wayles.vii. Bishops / and now
be^ but foure^ Tho Seuarne departed England and wales. Wihel. de pan. li.i.
But in the Saxons time though Saint Gregori. had granted / london the
preuylege of tharchebysshops see Netheles saint Austen yt was sent in to
England by saint Gregory turned tharchebysshop see out of / london into
Caunterbury. After saint Gregoryes days at the prayer of king Ethelbryght and
C^ and burgeyses of Caunterbury there tharchebysshops see has dured unto now
save yt in ye mean time of a king of mercia was wrought with men of
Caunterbury / and benam them that worship / and worshypped Adulphe bishop of /
lychfelde with the Archebysshops pally by assent of Adryan the pope upon Caas
(...) yeftes sent / Netheles under Kenulph the king it was restored to
Caunterbury again. The worship of the sea of york has dured there always and
yet dured though Scotlonde be withdraw fro his subieccyon by passing of time.
Gir intinere.li.i. the Archebysshoppes see was turned out of Caerleon into
Meneuia that is in the weste side of Demecya upon the Irysshe see in Saint
Dauyds time under king Arthur. From saint Dauyds time unto Sampsons time were
in Meneuya.xxiii. Archebysshops. Afterward fell a pestyle^ce in all wales of
the yelowe evil / that is called the Iau^dis. And then Sampson the
Archebysshop took with him the palle and went in to Brytayne Armonica the
less Brytayne and was there bishop of Dolensin. from that time unto the
first Henryes time king of England were at Meneuia which is called saint
Dauyds.xxi. bishops all without palle / whether it were for uncunning or for
pouerte. Nevertheless always fro that time ye bishops of wales were sacryd of
the bishop of Meneuia of saint Dauyds / and the bishop of Meneuia was sacred
of the bishops of wales as of his suffrigans and made no professyon ne
subjection to none other church. Other bishops that come after ward were
sacred at Caunterbury compellynge and heest of the king / in token of that
sacrynge and subieccyon^ Boneface Archebysshop of Caunterbury that was legate
of the Cross song in every Catheralle church of wales solempnely. Amas he
was ye first Archebysshop of Caunterbury that so did in wales / and yt was
dene in the second He^ryes time. R. But now ben but two primates in all
England of Canterbury and of york. To the prymate of Caunterbury ben
subgette.xiii. bishops in England and.iiii^ in wales. The premate of york
has but two suffrygans in England that been the bishop of Caerleyll and of
Durham: Of all these sees and chaungynge of other places I shall show you
here folwynge. Take heed in the begyngnynge of holy church in England
bishops ordained their sees in low places and simple that were couenable for
co^templacyon for prayers and devotion. But in william conquerours time by done
of law: Canon it was ordained that bysshoppes should come out of small towns
in to great cytees. Therefore was the sea of Dorchestre changed to Lyncoln:
Lychefelde to Chestre. Tetforde to Norwyche Shyrbron to Salysbury. wells to
Bathe. Conewayles to exestre / and Seleseye to Chichestre. The bysshopp of
Rochestre has no parysshe but he is the Archebysshops chapelayn of
Canterbury. Sith the sea of Caunterbury was first ordained by saint Austen /
it caunged yet never his place. Chychestre has under him oonly South sex and
the isle of wight / and had his see first in the time of the Archebysshop
Theodore / and the sea dured there.CCC.xxxiiii. year under.xx. bishops fro the
first wylfryede unto the last Sith and at the commandment of king wyllyam
conqueror changed the sea fro Seleseye to Chychestre.

De episcopis occidentalibbus wilhelmus.
Have mind that all the prouynce of west saxon had always one bishop fro
the beginning unto Theodorus time / by grant of king Islo king of
westsaxon the first Birrynus ordained a see at Dorchestre that is a simple
town by southe Oxenforde beside walyngforde between the metynge together of
Temse and Tame when Birinus was deed. Ke^walcus the king ordained a see at
wynchestre as his fader had purposed / there agylbert a Frenssheman was first
bishop of all the prouynce of westsaxon. For yt time the cite and ye see of
Dorchestre perceived and longed to ye prouynce of Meria / that cite stands
with in Temse. and the Temse departs between Mercia and westsaxon. And after
that Agylbert was pute out of wynchestre that tho hight winton then was there
an English bishop that was called wine. / Some men suppose yt this cite has
the name of this wine / and is called wynchestre as it were wine cite. At the
last he was put out and after him come Leutherius the foresaid Agelbertes
neuewe. After Leutherius hedda awhyle was bishop there. when he was deed.
Theodorus the Archebysshop ordained two bishops to the prouynce of westsaxon.
Danyell at wynchestre to him were subgette two cou^tres / Sothery and
southampshyre / and to him were subget syx countrees. Barkshyre wyltshyre
Somersete Dorseteshyre Deuenshyre and Corn walyle. Treuysa. It seems by this
yt westsaxon conteyted. Sotherye Southampeshyre Dorseteshyre Deuenshyre Corn
wayle Wilhell. After ward in elder Edwardes time to these two sees were
ordained by commandment of Formosus the pope three other sees. At wells for
Somersete. At Kyrton for Deue^shyre. and. At saint Germayn for Cornewayle. Not
long after ward the syxt see was set At Rammesbury for wyltshyre. At the
last by commandment of king wyllyam conqueroure all these sees save
wynchestre were turned and changed out of samlle Town in to great Cytees for
Shyrborn and Rummesbury were turned in to Salysbury. Now to that see is
subgette Barkshyre wyltshyre and Dorsete. The sea of wells was turned to Bathe
/ thereto is now subget all Somersete. The sees of kyrton and of Cornewale were
changed to Exestre thereto is subget Deue^shyre and Cornwale.

De orientalibus episcopis.
IT is known that the Eest Saxons always fro the beginning to now were
subgette to the bishop of London But the prouynce of the eest Angels that
conteyneth Norffolke and Souffolk had one bishop at Donwyk / the bishop heet
Felix and was a Bourgon and was bishop.xvii. year / after him Thomas was
bishop.v. year after him. boneface.xvii. year. Then Bysy afterward was
ordained by Theodorus and ruled the prouynce while he might endure by himself
allone / After him unto Egbertes time king of westsaxon an ho^dred.xliii.
bishops ruled that prouynce oone at donwyk and an other of Elyngham.
Nevertheless after Ludecans time king of Mercia left and was only one see at
Elyngham unto the.v. year of wyllyam conqueroure / when Herfastus the.xxiii.
bishop of the estrene changed his see to Tetforde / and his successor
Herbertus changed these fro Tetforde to Norwhiche by leave of king wyllyam the
reed. The sea of Ely that is night thereto the first king Henry ordained
the.ix. year of his regne / and made subgect thereto Cambrydgeshyre that was
tofore a part of the bysshopryche of Lyncoln / and for quytynge thereof / he
gaafte to the bishop of Lyncoln a good town called Spaldynge.

De episcopis Merciorum wilhelmus.
HEre take heed that as the Kingdom of Mercia was always greteste for the
time / so it was dealed in mo bysshopryches and specially by great hyrte by
king Offa. which was.xl year king of Mercia / he changed the Archebysshops
see fro Caunterbury to Lychfelde by assent of Adryan the pope. Then the
prouynce of Mercia and of Lyndeffar in ye first beginning of her crystendom in
king wulfrans time had one bishop at Lytchefeld the first bishop yt was
there heet Dwyna the second heet Celath and were both Scotts / after them the
third Trumphere / the fourth Iarmuanus / the fyfte Chedde But in Edelfydes
time that was wulfrans brother when Chedde was deed / Theodorus tharchebysshop
ordained there wynfrede Cheddes deken. Netheles apud Hyndon after that for he
was vnbuxum in some point / he ordained there Sexwulf abbot of Meda^stede that
is named burgh. but after Sexwulfus fourth year Theodorus tharchebysshop
ordained five bishops in the prouynce of Mer^ia. And so he ordained Bosell at
wyrcestre / Cudwyn at Lychfelde / the foresaid Sexwulf at Chestre. Edelwyn at
Lyndeseye at cite. Sydenia / and he took Eata monk of the abbaye of Hylde at
whyt by and made him bishop of Dorchestre beside Oxenforde. Tho this
Dorchestre heet Dorkynge / and so the sea of that longs to westsaxon in Saint
Byrynes time longed to Mercia from Theodorus the Archebysshops time Ethelred
king of Mercia had destroyed Kente / this bishop Sexwulf took Pyctas
bishop of Rochestre that come out of Kente and made him first bishop of
Herdforde at last when Se^fulf was deed Hedda was bishop of Lychefelde after
him and wylfryd flemed out of Northumberlonde was bishop of Chestre. Netheles
after two year Alfred king of Northumberlo^de deyed and wylfrede turned again
to his own se hagustalden / and so Hedda held both the bysshopryches
Lychfelde and of Chestre. after him come Albyn that heet worcester also and after him
come three bishops. Torta at chestre wytta at Lychfelde / And Eata was yet at
Dorchestre. After his death bishops of Lyndesey held his see.iii.
hundred.liiii. year unto ^emygius changed the sea to Lyncoln by leave of the

De episcopis Northumbran Wilhel. de pon. li. ca. xi.
AT york was one see for all the prouynce of Northu^berlonde paulinus held
first the sea and was ordained of the bishop of Canterbury / and held ye
see at york.vii. year Afterward wha^ king Edwyn was slain and things were
dystroubled. Poulinus went thens by water away into Kent from whens he come
first and took with him the pall. Wilhel. li^iiii. And so the bysshopryche of
york ceased.xxx. year / and the use of the palle ceased there an hundred.xxv.
year unto that Egbart the bishop that was the kings brooder of the land
recovered it by auctoryte of the pope. R. when saint Oswolde reigned Aydanus a
Scot was bishop in bernica that is ye north side of Northumberlonde / after
him Finianus after him Salmanus. wylhel: vby. s. At last he went in to
Scotlo^de with great in dygnacyon / for wylfre under took him for he held
unlawfully Besterdaye.xxx. year after ye Paulinus was gone from thens wilfred
was made bishop of york. Beda li.iiii. But while he dwelled long in France
about his sacrynge at excytynge of quartadecimonorum / that were they yt held
Eesterdaye the.xiiii. day of ye moan. Chedde was ytake out of his abbay of
Lynstynge and wrongfully put out i^ to ye see of yorkesby assent of king Oswy.
but three year after ward. Theodorus tharche bishop did him a way and
assygned him to the prouynce of Mercia and restored wilfred to the sea of
york. But after by cause of wrath yt was between him and the king Egfryde was
put out of the sea by Theodorus help. tharchebysshop that was corrupt with
some manner mede this was done after ye wilfred had been bishop of york / and
Cumbert at Hagustalde church / and Eata at Lyndeffar church yt now is called
holy ylonde in ye River of Twede. Aydanus found first the sea. And Theodorus
made Eadhedus bishop of Ropoune that was comen again out of Lyndeseye.
wilfred had be abbot of Repune. Theodorus sent Trunwynus to ye land of Pyetes
in thendes of England fast by Scotlond in a place yt heet Candida casa. and
whiterne also. there saint Ninian a Bryton was first fou^der and doctor. But
all these sees out take york failed little and little for the sea of Candida
casa that is Galle way that tho longed to \ England and dured many years
under.x. bishops unto that it had no power by destroyenge of the Pyctes. The
sees of Hagalde and of Lyndeffar was sometime all one under.lx. bishops about
four score year and ten and dured unto the coming of ye Danes. In that time
under Hyngar and Hubba ardufe the bishop yede long about with saint Cuberts
body unto king Aluredes time king of west Saxon / and the sea of Lydeffar was
set at Kunegestre that is called Kunyngysburgh also / ye place is called now
Vbbesforde upon Twede At the last the.xvii. year of king Egbere king Edgars
sone / ye se was changed to Durham / and saint Cutber^tes body was brought
thither by the doing of Edmonde ye bishop / and fro that time forward the sea
of that Hagustalde and of lyndeffar failed utterly. The first king Henry in
the.ix. year of his regne made the new seat Caerleyll. The archebysshop of
Caunterbury has under him.xiii. bishops in England. and.iiii. in wales he
has Rochostre under him / and that se has under him a part in Kent alone
London has under him Estsex Myddelsex and half Herdforthshyre. Chychestre has
under him Southsex and the isle of wight. wynchestre has under him Hampshyre
and Southery. Salesbury has under him Barkshyre wyldshyre D^rsete. Exetre has
under him Deuenshyre and Cornewayle. bathe has under him Somerseteshyre alone
/ wyrcestre has under him Gloucestreshyre wyrcestreshyre and half warwykshyre
Herdforde has under him Herfordshyre Chestre is bishop of Couentree and of
Lychefelde and has under him Cherstreshyre Staffordshyre Derbyshyre half
warwykshyre and some of Shropshyre and some of Lancastreshyre fro the River of
Mersee unto the River Rypylle. Lyncoln has under him ye prouynces that been
between Temse and humbre that been the shyres of Lyncoln of Leycestre of
Norhampton of Huntyngdon of Bedforde of Bockyngham of Oxenforde and half
Herdefordeshyre. Ely has under him Cambrygeshyre outake Merlonde. Norwyche
has under him Merlonde Norfolk and Suffolk. Also tharchebysshop of
Caunterbury has four suffreygans in wales that been Landaf Saint Dauyes
Bangor and saint assaph. The Archebysshop of york has now but two bishops
under him that been Durham and Caerleyll. R. And so ben but two prymates in
England what of hem shall do^ to the other and in what manner point he shall be
obedyent and under him. It is fully contained within about the year of our
lord Ihesu christ a thousand.lxxii. tofore the first king wylliam and the
bishops of England be commandment of the pope. the cause was handled and
treated between the foresaid prymates and ordained and demed that ye prymate of
york shall be subgette to the prymate of Canterbury in things yt longen to
the worship of god and to the believe of holy church that in what place ever it
be in England that the prymate of Cau^therbury wylhote and constreyne togader
a counseyll of clergy the prymate of york is holden with his suffrygans for to
be there and for to be obedyent to the ordinance yt there shall be lawfully
ordained when the prymate of york shall come to Caunterbury and with other
bishops he shall sacre him that is chosen / and so with other bishops he
shall sacre his own prymate / if the prymate of york be deed / his successor
shall come unto ye bishop of Caunterbury and he shall take his ordinance of
him and take his oath with prosessyon and lawful obedyence. After about the
year of our lord.xi.C.lxxxxv. in the time of king Richard ben resons set for
the party for either prymate and what one prymate did to that other in time of
Thurstinus of Thomas and of other bishops of york from the conqueste unto
king Henryes time the third. Also there it is said how each of them starte
from other. This place is but a forspekynge and not a full treates thereof
Therefore it were noyfulle to charge this place with all thylke reasons.

Of how many manner people have dwelled therein. ca. xiiii.
BRytous dwelled first in this ylonde the xviii. year of Hely the prophet /
the.xi. year of Solinus postumus king of Latyns.xliii. after the taking of
Troy / tofore the buildynge of Rome.CCC.xxxii. year. Beda. li.i. They come
hyder and took her course from armonyk that now is that other brytayn they
held long time the south countres of ye ylond It befell afterward in
Vespasianus time duke of Rome. That the Pyctes shypped out of Scycya into
Occean / and were driven about with the wind and entered in to the North
costs of Irlonde and found there Scotts and prayed to have a place to dwell
Inn and might none get. For Irlonde as Scotts said might not sustain both
people Scotts sent Pyctes to the north side of England and behyght them
help ayenste the Brytons that were their enemies if they would arise / and
took them wives of their daughters / upon such condycyon if doubt fylle /
whoo should have right to be king they should rathar chese him of the mother
side than of the fader side of the women kyn rathar than of the men kind
Gaufre. In Vaspasyan the Emperous time when Marius Aruiragus sone was king of
Brytons One Rodryk king of Pyctes came out of Scycya and ganne to destroyed
Scotlonde / Marius the king slew this Rodryk and gave the north party of
Scotlonde that heet Cathenesia to the me^ that were came with Rodryk and were
overcome by him / for to dwell Inn. But these men had no wives ne none might
have of the nacyon of brytons there for they sailled into Irlonde and took to
their wives Irysshemens daughters by that couenaunte that the mother blood
should be put tofore in succession of heritage. Gir. ca. xvii. Netheles Sirinus
super Vyrgilium says that Pyctes agatyrses that had some dwelling plyce
about the waters of Scycya and they ben called Pyctes of Peyntynge and
smiting of wounds / therefore they are called Pyctes as painted men. These men
and these goths ben all one people. For when Ma^imus the tyrant was went out
of Brytayne into France f^r to occupye thempyre. Then Gratianus and
Valentianus that were brethern and folowes of thempyre brought these goths out
of ^cya with great gifts with flaterynge and ^re behestes into the north
country of Bryta^ne. For they were stalworth and strong m^ of arms and so
these thieves and bryborus were made men of land and of country and dwelled in
the north countrees. And held there cytees and towns. Gaufre. Carancius the
tyrant slew Bassyanus ^ and gafe the Py^^e^ a dwelling place in. Albania
that is Scotlond / there they dwelled long time afterward and meddled with
Brytons. R. Then sithe that Pyctes occupied first the (...) side of
Scotlond. It seems that the dwge place that this Carancius gaat them is the
southe side of Scotlonde that stretchethe from thawrte over wall of Romans
work to the Scottesshe see. and conteyneth Galleway and Lodouia that is
Lodewaye. Th^rfore Beda.li.iii. ca. ii. speaks in this manner. Ninian the
holy man converted the southe Pyttes. Afterward the Saxons come and made that
Country long to Brenicia the North party of Northumberlonde unto the time
that Kynadius Alpinus sone king of Scotlo^de put out of the Pyctes and made
that country that lies between Twede and the Scottesshe see long to his
kingdom. Beda.li^ ca. i. Afterward long time the Scotts were led by duke
Renda and came out of Irlonde that is propre country Scotts and with love or
with strenthe made him a place fast by the Pyctes in the North side of that
arm of the sea / that breketh in to the land in the weste side that departed
in old time between Brytons and Pyctes. Of this Duke Renda the Scotts had
the name and were caled Darlendinas as it were Rendaes part / for in her
speech a part is called dall. Girp^. The pyctes might have no wives of
Brytons bute they took hem wives of Irysshe Scotts and promised hem fair for
to dwell with them And granted him a land by the sea side / there the sea is
now That land is called now. Galleway Marianus Irysshe Scottesshe lord
datte Argall that is Scotten clyfe for Scotts londed there for to do tharme
to the Brytons or for that place is next to Irlonde for to come a land in
Brytayne. Beda. And so the Scotts after Brytons and Pryctes made the third
people dwelling in Brytayne. R. Then after that come Saxons at prayenge of
the Brytons to help them against the Scotts and Pyctes. And the Brytons were
soon put out in to ways. And Suxons occupied the Land little and little. And
efte more to the Scottysshe see. And so Saxoas made the fourth manner of men
in the ylonde of Brytayne. Beda li.v. ca. ix. For Saxons and Angels came out
of Germania / yet some Brytons that dwelled nyghe callen hem shortly Germans.
R. Netheles abowte the year of our lord.viii. hundred Egbartus king of
westsaxon commanded and badde all men call the men of the land Englysshmen.
Alfre. Then after that the Canes pursued the land. Abowte two hundred year /
that is for to say fro the for said Egbarteus time unto saint Edwardes time /
and made the fyfte manner of people in the land / Bute they faylde after
ward. At last come Normans unto duke wyllyam and subdued Englysshemen / and
yet keep they the land and they made the ^y^the people in the ylonde. But in
the first king Henryes time come many Flemynges and received a dwellynege
place for a time be side Maylros in the weste side of Enlonde / and made the
seventh people in the ylonde. Netheles by commandment of the same king they
were put thens and driven to Hauer fordes side in the west side of wales. R.
And so now in Brytayne Danes and Pyctes fayllen all out / and five nacyons
dwellen there in that been Scotts in Albania / that is Scotlond. Brytayne in
Chambrya that is wales. but that Flemynges dwell in that is west wales. And
normans and Englysshmen ben meddled in all the ylond / for is now doubt in
stories how and in what manner they were put a way and dystroyed out of
Brytayne. Now it is to declare how the Pyctes were dystroyed and sailed. Girp^.
ca. vii. Brytayn was sometime occupied with Saxons / and peace was made and
stablysshed with the Pyctes / then the Scotts that came with the Pyctes saw
that the Pyctes were nobler of deeds and better me^ of arms though they were
less in nombre than the scotts Then^e the Scotts having thereof envy turned
to their natural treason yt they have often used for in treason they pass other
me^ and ben traitors as it were by kind. For they prayed all the Pyctes and
specially the great of them to a feast. and waited her time when the Pyctes
were merry and had well drunk they drew up nails that held up holowe be^ches
under the pyctes and the pyctes unware suddenly fill in over the hammes into a
wonderful pytfull. Then the Scotts fell on the Pyctes and slew the^ and left
none alive. And so of two manner people ye better warryours were holy destroyed.
but the other yt ben the Scotes which ben traitors all unlike to the pyctes
took prouffyte by that falls treason / for they took all that land and hold
it yet unto this time and it. Scotlonde after her own name / In king Edgars
time Kynadin Alpinus sone was duke and leder of the Scotts and warred in Pycte
land / and destryyed the Pyctes. He warred syx sythes in Saxon and took all
the land that is between Twede and the Scottysshe see with wrong and with
strength.

Of the langages of manners and vsuge of the people of that land. ca. xv^
AS it is known how many manner of people ben in this ylonde there been also
so many langages and tongues. Netheles walsshe and scotts that been not meddled
with other nacyons keep yet their langage and speech but yet the Scotts that
were sometime co^federate and dwelled with Pyctes draw somewhat after their
speech / But the Flemynges that dwell in the west side of wales have left her
strange speech and speken like to Saxons / also Englysshemen though they had
fro the beginning three manner of speches. Southern Northern and myddell
speech in the myddell of the land as they come of three manner of people.
Germania. Netheles by commixyon and mydlynge first with Danes and afterward
with Normans in many things the country langage is appared / for some use
strange wlaffynge chyterynge harrynge gartynge and grysbytynge. This apparynge
of the langage comes of two things / one because that children that gone to
scole learn to speak first English / and than ben compelled to constre his
lesso^s in Frensshe and that have been used syn the Normans come into England.
Also gentylmens children be learned and taught from their youth to speak
Frensshe / and up londesshmen will counterfete and lyken himself to ge^tylmen
and are besy to speak / frensshe for to be more set by / wherefore it is said
by a common proverb. Jack would be a gentylme^ if he could speak frensshe.
Treuisa. This was much used to fore great death. but sith it is somdele
changed / for sir Johan Cornwayle a master of gramer changed ye techynge of
gramer scole and construccyon of / frensshe into English. And other scole
masters use ye same way now in the year of our lord. a.M.CCC.lxxxv. the.ix.
year of king Richard the second / and leave all / frensshe in scoles and use
all co^struccyon in English wherein they have advantage one way that is yt
they learn ye sooner their gramer / and in a another dysauauntage. for now they
learn no Frensshe nor can none. which is hurt for them yt shall pass thee
see. And also gentylmen have much left to teache their chyldred to speak /
frensshe. R. It seems a great wonder ye Englysshmen have so great dyuersyte in
their own langage in sown and in speaking of it which is all in one ylonde.
And the langage of Normandye is comen out of an other land and has one manner
sown among all the^ that speak it in England / for a man of Kente southern
western and northern men speken / frenshe all like in sown and speech but they
can not speak their English so. Treuysa. Netheles there ben as many diverse
manner of / frenshe in the reame of / france / as diverse English in the
reame of England. R. Also of the foresaid tongue which is departed in three is
great wonder / for men of the eest with men of the west accord better in
sownynge of the speech / than men of the north with men of the southe Therefore
it is ye men of mercii that been of myddell England as it were partynes with
the ends / understand better the side langages northern and southern than
northern and southern understand either other. Wilhel. de pon.li.iii. All the
langahes of the northu^bres and special at york is so sharp shyttynge
frottynge and vnshap / yt we southern men may uneath vnverstonde that langage^
I suppose ye cause be yt they be night to the alyens that speak straungely. And
also by cause the kings of England abide and dwell more in the southe
counteree than in the north country. The cause why they abide moore the south
country than in the north country / is by cause that there is better corn
land more people moo noble cytees and mo profitable havens in the southe
country than in the north country.

De gentis huius moribus. Gir. in (...)*
FOr the manners and doing of walsshemen and of scotts ben to fore somewhat
declared. Now I purpose to tell and declare the condycyons of the meddled
people of England. But the Flemynges that been in the west side of wales ben
now all turned as they were Englysshmen by cause they company with
Englysshmen. And they be mighty and strong to fight / and ben the most
enemies that walsshemen have / and use marchaundyse and clothing and ben full
ready to put themself in auentures and to peril in the sea and land because
of great winning and be^ ready sometime to the plowe and sometime to deeds of
arms when time and place areth. It seems of these men a great wonder that in
a boon of a wethers right sholder when the flesse is soden away and not roasted
they know what have be done / is done / and shall be done as it were by
spyryte of prophecye and a wonderful craft. They tell what is done in far
cou^tres towenes of peace or of war / the state of the royame sleynge of men
and spousebreche such things they declare certain of tokenes and signs that
is in such a sholder bone. R. But the Englysshemen that dwell in England ben
meddled in the ylonde and ben far fro the places that they spronge of first
tornenne to the contrary deeds lyghtelye without entysynge of any other men
by her own assent. And vnesy also impatient of peace / enemies of besynes / and
full of sloth. Wilhel. de pon.li.iii. says That when they have destroyed
their enemies all to the ground / then^e they fyghten with theymself and
sleeth each other / as void and an empty stomak werketh in it self. R.
Netheles men of the southe ben esyer and moree mylde than men of the North. For
they ben more unstable and more cruel and more vnesy. The myddell men ben
parteners with both. Also they use them to glotony more than other men and ben
more costlewe in mete and clothing Men suppose that that they took that vice
of king Herceknot yt was a Dane. For he here set forth twyes double mess
at Dinner and at souper alsoo. These men ben spedefulle on horse and a foot.
Able and ready to all manner dedys of arms / and be wont to have vyctorye and
maystrye in every fight where no treason is walking / and been curyous and
can well tell dedys and wonders that they have seen. Also they gone in diverse
lands uneath ben any men rich in her own land or more gracyous in far
and in strange land / they can better win and get new than keep thyr own
heritage / Therefore it is yt they be sprade so wide and wene that every land
be own. The men be able to all manner sleyght and wit / but to fore the deed
blonderynge and hasty. And more wise after the deed than tofore. an leven of
lightly what they have begone. Solinus li.vi. Therefore Eugenius the pope said
that Englysshmen were able to do what ever they would / and to be sete and put
tofore all other ne were that light wytletteth. And as Hanyball said that ye
Romans might not be over comee but in there own country so: Englysshme^ may
not be over come in strange lands but in there own country they be lyghty
overcome R. These men despysen her own and praise other men's. and uneath be
pleased nor apayd with their own estate what befalleeh and becomes other men
/ they will gladly take to them self. Therefore it is that a yeman arayeth him
as a squyre: a squyre as a knight a knight as a duke / a duke as a king / yet
some go abote and will be like to all manner state and ben in no state. For
they take every degree that be of no degree for in derynge out ward they be
myntrals and herowdes. In talknynge great spekers In etynge and drinking
glotons / In gaderyng of catell hucksters and tauerners. In array tormentours.
In wnynynge argry. In travail tantaly. In taking head dedaly. In beds
Sardanapaly / In chyrches mawmetes. In courts tho^dre only in preuylege of
clergy and in prebendes they knowle^he themself clerks. Treuysa As touching
the terms of latin as argi / tantali / dedali / serdanapali / ye must
understand them as ye poctes feyned of them. Argus was an hard and kept
bestes he had an ho^dred even. and Argus was also a ship / a ship man and a
chapman / and so argus might se before and behind and on every side. Therefore
he yt is wise and ware and can se that he be not deceived may be called Argus.
And so the Cronycle says in plurell nombre yt Englysshmen ben argy. that is to
say they se about where as winning is That other word tantaly / the poet
feyneth that Tantalus slew his own sone wherefore he is dampened to perpetual
penance / and he stands always in water up to the neither lyppe and has
always ripe apples and noble fruit hanging down to the ouerlyppe. But the
fruit ne the water may not come within his moute. He is so hold and
stands between mete and drink and may neither eete ne drink / and is ever
an hongred and a thyrste that woo is him alive by this manner likeness of
Tantalus they that do right naught there is much is to do in euere side ben
called tantaly It seems that it is to say in trauaylle they be tantaly / for
they do right naught thereto. The third word is deda^e / take heed that
Dedalus was a subtle and a slye man. And therefore by lykenes they that been
subtle and slye they becalled dedaly. And the fourth word is sardanapaly / ye
shall understand that Sardanapalus was king of Assyryens and was fulle
unchaste / and used him for to lie soft. And by a manner of lykenys of him they
yt live unchastly ben called sardanapaly. R. But among all Englysshmen meddled
togyders is so great a chaungynge and dyuersyte of clothing and of a raye and
so many manners and dyuerseshappes that well nyghe is there any man known by
his clothing and his array of whate some ever degree that he be There of
prephecyed an holy Anchor in king Egelfredes time in this manner. Henry li.vi.
Englysshmen for as much as they use them to drynkel^wn^es / to treason and to
rechelesnes of gods house / first by Danes and then by Normans / and at the
third time by the Scotts yt they hold the most wretches and lest worth of
all other they shall be overcome. Then the world shall be so unstable and so
diverse and varyable that the unstableness of thoughts shall be bytokeneth by
many manner dyuersytees of clothing.

Here follows the dyscrecyon of the land of wales. ca. xvi.
Now this book takes on hand.
Wales after England ^
So take I my tales
And wend into wales
To that noble blood.
Of Pryamus blood
Knowleche for to win ^
Of great Iupyters kynne.
For to have in mind
Dardanus kind.
In these four tytles I fond
To tell the state of that land. ^
Cause of the man I shall tell
And then praise the land and well
Then I shall write with my pen.
All the manners of the men
Then I shall fond ^
To tell meruaylles of the land
Of the name and wherefore is named wales. ca. xvii.
WAles now is called wallia.
And sometime it heet Cambria
For Camber Brutes sone
Was prince and there did wone
Then wallia was to mean.
For Gwalaes the queen
King Ebrancus child
Was wedded theder mylde
And of that lord Gwalon
With draws of the sonn^
And put to.l.i. a. ^
And thou shalt find wallia.
And though this land
Be much less than England
As good glebe is one as other
In the daughter in the mother
Of the co^modytes of the land of wales. Capitulo. xviii.
THough that land be luy^.
It is full of corn and of fruit
And has great plente ywys
Of flesh and eke of fysshe
Of beestes tame and wild
Of horse sheep^ oxen mylde ^
Good land for all seeds ^
For corn gras and herbs that spredes
There ben woods and medes
Herbs and flowers there spredes.
There ben Ryuers and wells
Valeyes and also hills
Valeyes bring forth flood.
And hills metals good ^
Cooll grows under land
And gras above at hand
There lyme is copyous
And slates for house ^
Honey and milk white
There is deynte and not lyte
Of braket meet and ale.
Is great plente in that vale
And all that ends to the live
That land brings forth ryue ^
But of great riches to be draw
And close many in short saw
It is a corner small ^
As though god first of all
Made that land so feel
To be selere of all hele. ^
Wales is deled by
A water that heet Twy
North wales from the south
Twy deleth in places full couch ^
The south heet Demicia
And the other Venedocia
The first shoteth and arowes deres
That other deleth all with spear ^
In wales how it be
Were sometime courts three
At Carmerthyn was that one.
And that other was in Moan ^
The third was in Powysy
In Pegwern that now is Shrowesbury
There were bishops seven
And now ben four even
Under Saxons all at home
Sometime under princes of that land
Of the manners and rytes of the walsshmen. ca. xix.
THe manner living of that land.
Is well diverse from England
In mete and drink and clothing
And many other doing
They be clothed wonder well
In a shyrte and in a mantell
A cryspe brethe well sayn^ ^
Does in wind and in rain
In this clothing they by bold ^
Though the weder be right cold
without shetes always.
Evermore in this array
They go fight plye and lepe
Stand sytte lie and sleep
without surto^ gown cote and kyrtyll
without ^open tabarde clok or bell ^
without lace and chaplet that her lappes
without hode hatte or cappes
Thus arayd gone the segges
And always with base legs
They keep none other going
Though they mete with the king ^
with arowes and short speres
They fight with them that them deres
They fight better if they neden
When they go than when they ^yden
Instead of castle and coure
They take wood and mareys for socour
when they seen it is to do.
In fighting they would be a go ^
Gyldas says they ben varyable
In peace and not stable.
if men a^e why it be
It is no wonder for to se
Though men put out of land
To put out other would fond ^
But all for naught at this stand
For all many woods ben at gronde
And put the sea among
^en castles builded strong
The men may dure long vnete
And love well conume mete ^
They can ete and ben mury
without great cury
They ete bread cold and hot
Of ^arly and of ote
Broad cakes round and thynne ^
As well seems so great kynne
Selde they ete bread of whete
And selde they done one ete
They have gruell to p^tage
And lekes kind to com panage ^
Also butter milk and chese
y shapeend land and corner wise
Such messes they ete snell
And that makes hem drink well
Me^e ^d ale that has might
Thereon they spend day and night ^
Ever the redder is the wine. ^
They hold it the more fine
When they drink at ale
They till many lewd tale
For when drink is in handlynge
They ben full of Jangling
At meet and after eke. ^
Her solace is salt and leke
The husbonde in his wise
Tells that a great price
To give a gaudron with growele
To hem that sytten on his mele
He deleth his meet at meele ^
And gives every man his dele
And all the over pluse
He keeps to his own use.
Therefore they have woo
And myshappes also
They eten hot samon alway^
All though physyk say nay ^
Her houses ben low with all
And made of yerdes small
Not as in cytees nyghe
But f^rre a sonder and not to hygh^
When all his eten at home.
Then to their neighbors will they run
And ete what they may find and se
And then torn home again ^
The life is ydele that they ledes
In brennynge slepynge and such deeds
Wallshmen use with her might
To wesshe their ghestes fete a night
if he wesshe her fete all and sum.
Then they know that they be welcome
They live so esely in a route
That field they bear purs about. ^
At her breche out and home
They honge their money and comb.
It is wonder they beso hende
And hate crak at nether end
And without any core ^
Make their wardrope at the door.
They have in great mangery
Harp tabour and pype for mynstralsy
They bear corpse with sorywes great
And blow land hoenes of gheet^
They praise fast Troyau blood. ^
For there of come all her broad.
Nygh kyn they will be
Though they pass a hundred degree
Above other men they will him dyght. ^
And worship priest with her might
As angels of heaven right
They worship servants of god almyght.
Often gyled was this broad
And yerned battle all for wood
For Merlyns prophecye
And often for sortelegye
Best in manners of Brytons
For company of Saxons
Ben turned to better right
That is known as clear as light
They tyllen gardyns field and downs
And draw him to good towns
They ride armed as woll god
And go yhosed and yshoode
And sytten fair at her mele
And sleep in beds fair and in feel.
So they seem now in mind
More Englysshmen than walsshe kind.
if men axe why they now do so
More than they wont to do
They lyuen in more peace
Because of their riches.
For their catell should slake ^
if they used often warke
Dread of loss of her good
Make them now still of mode ^
All in one it is brought.
Have no thing and dread naught
The poet says a saw of preef
The foot man syngeth to fore the thief
And is bolder on the way.
Than the horse man rich and gaye
Of the meruayls and wondres of wales.
THere is a pole at Brechnok
Therein of fysshe is many a floke.
Often he changes his hew on cop
And bears above a gardyn crop
Often time how it be ^
Shape of house there shall thouse
When the pole is frore it is wonder
Of the noise that is there under
if the prince of the land hot
Birds sing well merry not ^
As merely as they can.
And syngyn for none other man
Besides Caerleon
Two mile fro the town
Is a roche well bright of leem
Right against the son beem. ^
Goldclyf that roche hight
For it shyneth as god full bright ^
Such a flour in stoon is naught.
Without fruit if it were sought
if men could by craft undo
The veins of thetth and come thereto ^
Many benyfece of kind
Ben now hyd fro man's mind
And ben unknow yet ^
For defaute of man's wit
Great tresour is hyd in ground
And after this it shall be found
By great study and besynes ^
Of them that comen after us
That old men had by great need
We have by besy deed Treuisa.
In books ye may read
That kind fails not at need
When no man had craft in mind. ^
Then of craft halpe god and kind
When no techer was in land
Men of craft by gods hand
They that had craft so then.
Taught forth craft to other men
Some craft that yet come not in place
Some man shall have by gods grace
R. An ylonde is with noise and strife
In west wales at Kerdyf
Fast by Sauerne stronde.
Barry hight that ylonde ^
In that hither side in a chene
Shall thou here wonder dene
And diverse noys also ^

Noys of leaves and of wind
Noys of metals thou shall find
Frotynge of iron and westones thou shall her^

Merlyn was ergo no gobelyn
And other Merlyn of Albyn land

And he had names two
Syluestris and Calidonius also ^
Of that wood Calidonie

Of the descrypcyon of Scotlonde sometime named Albania. ca. xxi.
IT is a common saw that the country which is now named Scotlonde is an out
stretchynge of the north side of Brytayn and is departed in the south side
from Brytayne with arms of the sea / and in the other side yt is be clypped
with the sea. This land hete some time Albania and had that name of
Albanactus that was king Brutes sone Albanactus dwelled first therein / or of
the prouynce Albania that is country of Scycia and nygh to amazona therefore
Scoctea ben called as ye were scyttes for they come out of Scicia. After ward
that land heet Pyctauya for ye Pyctes reigned there in a thousand.CCC.lx^ year.
And at last heet. Hibernia as Irlonde hight Gir. in top. For many skylles /
one is for affinite and alye that was between them and Irysshmen for they took
their wives of Irlonde and that is openly seen in her believe / in clothing /
in langage and in speech / in weyyn and in maneres. An other skyll is for
Irysshemen dwelied there sometime. Beda.li.i. Out of Irlonde that is the propre
country of Scotts come Irysshmen with her duke that was called Rendar. And
with love and with strenth made hem chyef sees and Cytees besides the Pyctes in
the North side. Gir. Now the land is shortly called Scotlonde of Scotts
that come out of Irlonde and reigned there in CCC.xv. year unto reed wyllyams
time that was Malcolyn brother. R. Manyeuydences we have of this Scotlonde that
it is often called and byghte Hibernia as Irlonde does. Therefore Beda.li.ii. ca.
xi. says that Laurence Archebysshoppe of Dunbar was Archebysshop of Scotts
that dwelled in an ylonde that heet Hibernia and is next to Brytayne.
Beda.li.iii. ca. xxvii. Says Pestilence of moreyn bare down Hibernia.
Also.li.iii. ca. ii. says that the Scotts that dwelled in the south side of
Hibernia. Also: li.iiii. ca. iii. he says that Cladde was a yonglynge and
learned the rule of monks in Hibernia. Also.li.iiii. ca. xxii. Egfridus king
of Northeumberlonde destroyed Hibernia: Also.li.iiii. ca. xv. the most dele of
Scotts in Hibernia and in the same chapter be called Hibernia proprely named
/ ye weste ylonde is an hundred mile from eueryche / Brytayne and departed with
the sea between and called Hibernia that country that now is called Scotlond
/ there he tells that Adamua abbot of this ylonde sailed to Hibernia for to
tethe Irysshmen the lawful Esterdaye And at last come again in to Scotlonde.
ysy. ethi. li.xiiii^ Man of this Scotlonde ben named Scotts in their own
langage and Pyctes also. For sometime her body was peynted in this manner / they
would some time with a sharp egged tole prycke end kerue there own bodies and
make thereon diverse fygures and shappes and peynt hem with ynke or with other
peynture or color / and because they were so peyntede they were called picti
that is to say peynted. Erodotus Scotts ben light of heart and wind enough
/ but by medlynge of Englysshmen they ben much amended / they ben cruel upon
their enmyes and hates bondage most of any thing and hold for a foul
sloth if a man deye in his bed and great worship if he deye in the field.
They ben lytyl of mete and mow fast long / and eten selde when the son is
up / and eten flysshe fysshe milk and fruit more than bread and though they be
fair of chappe they ben defoulde and made unseemly enough with their own cloth
thing They praise fast ye vsages of their own for faders and dyspysen other
me^nes doing her land is fraytful enough in pasture gardyns and feldes. Gir.
de. p^. ca: xviii. The princes of Scotts as the king of Spain be^ not wont
to be enoynted ne crowed. In this Scotlond is sole^pne and great mind of saint
Andrewe thapostle: For saint Andrewe we had the north parties of ye world
Scites and Pyctes to his lot for to preche and convert the people to crystes
believe. And at last he was martred in Achaia in grecia in a cite yt was named
Patras and his bones were kept.CC.lxii. year unto year unto Co^sta^tynus
the^perours time. And then they were translated in to Constantynople and
kept there.C.x. year unto Theodosyus the^perours time and then Vngus king
of Pyctes in Scotlond destroyed a great part in Brytayne and was besette with
a great host of Brytons in a field called Mark. End he herd saint Andrew
speak to him in this manner. Vngus vngus here thou me Crystes appostle. I
promise the help and socour when thou haste ouercomen thyn enmyes by my help
/ thou shall give the third deele of thyn heritage in alms to god almighty
/ in the worship of saint Andrewe / and the sign of the cross were tofore his
host and the third day he had the vyctory and so turned home again and
deled his heritage as he was baden. And for he was uncertain what Cytee he
should deal for saint Andrewe he fasted three day / he and his men prayed
Saint Andrewe that he would show him whate place he should chese. And one of
the wardeyns that kept the body of saint Andrewe in Constantynople was warned
in his slepte that he should goo into a place whyder an angel would led him
and so he come in to Scotlonde with.vii. ^elowes to the top of an hylle
named Ragmonde. The same our light of heaven beshone and beclypped the king of
Pyctes that was coming with his hooste to a place called Carceuan. There anon
were held many seek men. There met with the king Regulus the monk of
Constantynople with the relyques of Saint Andrewe. There is founded a church
in worship of Saint Andrewe that is heed of all chyrches in the land of
Pyctes. Too this church comen pylgrymmes out of all londes^ There was
Regulus first abbote and gadred monks. And so all the (...) lord that the
King had assygne^ him he departed it in diverse places among abbayes.

Of the descrypcyon of Irlonde. Capitulo. xxii.
HAbernia that is Irlonde. and was of old time In corperate in to ye lordshyp
of Brytayne so says Gir. in sua pop^. where he decryueth it at fulle. yet it
is worthy and semely to praise that land with large praysynge for to come to
citt^ and fulle knowledge of that land these tytles yt follow open the way.
Therefore I shall tell of the place and stead of ye land how great and what
man^^^ land it is / whereof that land has ple^te and whereof it has defaute
/ also of whate me^ have dwelled therein first. Of manners of me^ of that land.
Of the wonders of that lord / and of worthynes of halowes and saints of that
land.

Of the boundynge of Irlonde Capitulo xxiii.
IRlonde is the last of all the weste ylo^dos and high Hybernia of one
Hyberus of Spain that was Hermonius brother / for these two brethern gate and
wanne that land by conquest. Or it is called Hybernia of that River Hyderus
that is the weste end of Spayn / and that land hyghte Scotlonde also / for
Scotts dwelled there sometime er they came into that other Scotlonde that
longed to Brytayne / therefore it is written in the Martyloge Such a day in
Scotlond saint Bryde was borne / and that was in Irlonde. This land has in
the southeest side Spain three days sayllynge thens aside half / and has in
the eest side the more Brytayn thens a days sayllynge / in the west side the
endless Occean and in the North side. yselonde three days sayllynge thens.
Solynus. but the sea that is between and Irlonde is all the year full of great
wawes and vnesy that men may selde ^ayle sekerly between that see is a.C. mile
broad.

Of the greenes and qualyte of that land. ca. xxiii.
IRlonde is an ylonde grettest after Brytayne / and stretched north ward from
Brendas hills unto the land Columbyna and conteyneth.viii. days Journey
every journey.xi. mile and from Deuelyn to Patryks hills and to the sea in
that side in broad.iiii. de^ thanne in the ends / all other wise thanne
Brytayne / is as Irlonde is shorter north ward than Brytayne / so is it longer
south ward the land is not plain but full of mountayns of hills of woods
of maryes and of moors the land is soft rayny wind and low by the sea side
and within hylly and sondye. Solinus. There is great plente of noble pasture
and of leese / therefore the beestes must be often driven out of their pasture
lest they eete over much for they should shend him self if theye might ete
at their will. Gir. Men of that land have communely their health. And
strangers have often a perylous flue by cause of the moisture of the mete. The
flesh of kyen is there wholesome / and swynes flesh vnholsome^ Men of that
land have no fever but oonly the fever ague and that right selde. Therefore
the holsomnes of that land and the clennes out of venyme is wroth all the
boste and richesse of trees herbs of spycery of rich clothes and of precious
stone of the Eest lands. The cause of the health and holsomnes of that land
is attemperate heete and cold that is therein. In quibus rebus sufficit. In
this land ben moo kyen thanne oxen / more pasture thanne corn / more gras
thanne seed / there is plente of Samon / of lamprays / of eeles and of see
fysshe. Of Egles / of carnes / of pecockes / of curlewes of sparouhaukes of
goshoukes / and of gentle fawcons. Of wulues and right shrewed myse there ben
attercoppes / blood souke^s eeftes that done none harm / there ben fayres
little of body and full hardy and strong / there ben barnacles fowls like to
wild ghees which grown wonderly upon trees / as it were nature wroughte
against kind. Men of relygyon ette the barnacles upon fastyngdayes by cause
they ben not engendered with flesh. wherein as men thinks they err for
reason is against that. For if a man had eten of Adams leg he had eten
flesh / and yet Adam was not engendered of fader nor mother / but that flesh
come wonderly of the tree. In this land is plente of honey and of milk of vine
and of veynerdes. Solinus and ysyder. written that Irlonde has no bees
Netheles it were better written that Irlonde had bees and no vyneyerdes. Beda
says that there is great hunting to roobuckes / and it is known that there
ben none. It is no wonder of Beda for he saw never that land but some man
told him such tales. Also there grows that stone Saxagonus. And is called
Iris also as it were the rayn bow if that stone be hold against the son^^
anon it shall shape a raynbowe / there is also a stone that is called Gagates
and white margery perles.

Of the defautes of the londe^ Capitulo xxv.
WHere corns ben there full small vnne the yclenced with man's hand /
reserved men / all bestes ben smaller there thanne in other lands. There lackth
well nyghe all manner fysshe fresshe water that is not gendred in the sea
there lacken unkind faucons grefacons / per tryche fesauate / nyghtyngales /
and pyes / There lacken also Roo and bucke / and Ilesypyles wontes and other
venomous beestes. Therefore some men feynen and that favorably that Saint
Patryk cleansed that land of worms and of venomous beestes but it is more
probable and more skylfull that this land was from the beginning always
without suceh worms / for venomous beestes and wermes deyen there anon if
men bring them thither out of other lands. And also venym and poison
brought thither out of other lands lesen their malice as soon as it passes
the myddell of the sea. Also poudre and earth of that land cast and sown in
other lands driven away worms so ferfor that if a turfe of that land be put
aboutt a worm it sleeth him or makes him thryll that earth for tescape a way
In that land cocks crow bute little to fore day / so that the first
crowynge of cocks in that land and the third in other lands ben like far
totore the day.

Of them that first enhabyted Irlonde. ca. xxvi.
GIradus says that Casera Noes nece dradde the floode and fled with three
men and fyfty wymmen in to that ylonde and dwelled there in first the last year
tofore Noes floode. But after ward Bartholanus Seres sone that came of Iaphet
Noes sone came the there with his three sons by hap or craft.CCC. year after
Noers floode and dwelled there and encreaced to the nombre of.ix.M. men and
after ward for stenche of kareyns of gyauntes that they had kylde they
deyeden also save one Ruanus that lived a.M.v.C. year. unto saint Patryks time
/ and informed the holy man of the foresaid man and of all the doings and
deeds. Then the third time come thither Nymeth out of Scicia with his.iiii
sons and dwelled there.CC.xvi. year. and at last of his of spring by diverse
myshappes of wars and of morenyge they were clean destroyed and the land
left void.CC. year after they fourth time five dukes that were brethern
Gandius Genandus Sagandus Ruthe regus Slauius of the said Nymethes successors
come out of Greece and occupied that land and deled it in five parties / and
every party co^teyneth.xxii. ca^dredes. a Candrede is a country that
conteyneth a.C. towns and they set a stone in the myddel of ye lord as it
were in the navel and begynnyge of five king domes. At the last Saluius was
made king of all the land.

The fyfth time when this nacyon was xxx. year. together they wexe feeble.
Four noble men that were Millesius the kings sons come out of Spain with
many other in a navy of.xl. ships and two of ye worthyest of these iiii
brethern that heet Hyberus and Hermon deled the land between the^ tweyne / but
after ward covenant was broken between them both and Hiberus was slain Then
Hermon was king of all that land. And from his time to the first Patryks
time were kings of that nacyon.C.xxxi. And so fro the coming of Hybernensis ^
unto ye first Patryk were.M.viii.C. year. They had that name Hibernensys and
Hibernia of the for said Hiberus / or else of Hyberus a River of Spain. They
were called alsoo gatels and Scotts of one Gaytelus yt was Phenis neuewe.

This Gatelus could speak many langages / after the langages that were made
at Nemproths tower / And wedded one Scotra Pharoes daughter. Of these dukes
come the Hibernensis Men say that this Gatelus made the Irysshe langage and
called it Gaytelaf as it were a langage gagred of all langages and tongues. At
the last Belinus king of Brytayne had a sone and hight Gurguncius come out of
Donnemarke at ylondes Orcades He found men that were called Balclensis / and
were come theder out of spain / these me^ prayed and besught to have a place
to dwell in And the king sent them to Irlonde that was tho void and waste.
And ordained and sent with them duke and capytayns of his own and so it
seems that Irlonde should long to Brytayne by right of old time. From the
first saint Patryk unto Fedliundius the kings time.CCCC. year reigned.xxxiii.
kings eueryche after other in Irlonde^ In this Fedliundius time Turgesius duke
and capytayne of Norwayes brought theder men of Norwaye and occupied that land
and made in many places deep dyches and castles sengle double and tryble and
many wards strongly walled and many thereof stand yet all hole but Irysshmen
reche not of Castles / for they take woddes for castles and marayes and moors
for castle dyches but at ye last Turgesius deyed by gylefulles of women / and
Englysshmen said that Gurmundus wanne Irlonde and made thylke dyches / and made
no mencyon of Turgesius / and Irysshmen speak of Turgesius and know not of
Gurmu^das. Therefore it is write what gurmundus had won Brytayne and dwelled
therein / and sent Turgesius with great strenth in to Irlonde for to win that
land / and because Turgesius was Capytayne and leder of that vyage and Iurney
and seen among the^ therefore Irysshemen speak much of him as a noble man that
was seen in that land and known at the last when Gurmundus was slain in
France Turgesius loved the kings daughter of Irlonde and her fader behyghte
Turgesius that her world send her him to the low largeryn with.xv^ maidens
and Turgesius promised to mete there with.xv. of the nobleste men that he had /
and held couenaunte and brought no gyle but there came.xv. young berdeles me^
clothed like women with short swerdes under their clothes / and fill oon
Turgesius and slew him right there / and so he was traytoursly slain after he
had reigned.xxx. year Not long after.iii. brethren Almelanus Siracus and
Iuorus came into Irlonde with there men out of Norwaye as it had been for love of
peace and of marchaundyse and dwelled by these sides by assent of Irysshe men
that were always idle as Poules knights / and the Norwayes builded three cytees
Deueyn waterfore and Lymeryche and increased and after wexed rebel against men
of that land and brought first sparthes in to Irelonde So fro Turgesius
time unto roderykes time king of Connacia that was king of all the land
were.xvii. kings in Irlonde and so the kynnes that reigned in Irelonde from
the Hermons time unto the last time Roderyks were in all.C.lxxxi. kings that
were not crowned neither enoynted ne by law of heritage butte by night
maystrye and strenthe of arms The second Henry king of England made this
Roderyk subget ye year of king Henryes aege xl. and of his regne.xviii. the

Of the condycyons and manners of Irlonde. ca. xxvii.
SGlinus says that men of this land ben strange of nacyon houseles and great
fyghters / and acount right and wrong all one thing / and ben syngle of
clothing / scarce of mete / cruel of heart / angry or speech and drynketh
first blod of deed men that been slain and then wesshen their vysages therwyth
and holden them paid with flesh and fruit instead of mete and with milk instead of dr^nke and vsen much plain and ydlenes and hunting and trauaylle
butte little. In their child hode they ben hard nourysshed and ^erde fed and
they be unseemly of manners and of clothing and have brechee and hosen all ne
of wolle and strayte hodes that stre^cheth a cubyte over thesholders behind
and foldynges instead of mantels and of clokes. Also they use no sadels boots
ne spores wha^ they ride. but they drive their horses with a chambred yerede in
ye over end. Instead of byttes with trenches of brydels of reest / they use
brydels that let not their horse to ete there mete / they fight unarmed naked in
body / netheles with two darts and speres / And with broad spar^den they
fight with one hand.

These men forsaken tyllynge of Land and kepen pasture for beestes.
They use long berdes and locks hanging down behind there hedes ^ they use
no craft of flax / of wolle / of metal / ne of marchaundyse but give hem to
ydelnes and slouthe / and reken reest for liking and for fredome for riches /
And though Scotlonde the daughter of Irlonde use harp tymbre and to boure.
Netheles Irysshe men beconnynge in two manner Instruments musyke / in harp
and tymbre that is armed with were and strenges of bras In which Instruments
though^ (...) play hastily and swyftly they make ryhgt (...) ^onye and melodys
with thycke tewnes ^erbles and notes and begin from be mo^^ and playen
secretly under dyme sown in the great strenges and torn again unto the same /
so that the grettest party of craft hydeth the craft as it welde seem as
though the craft so should be ashamed if it were take These men ben of evil
maneres in there living they pay no tythynges the wedde lawfally / they spare
not their alyes / But brother wedde the broththers wife / they besye to betraye
her neighbors and other they bear sperthes in their hondes instead of staves
and fight ayenste them that trust most to them / these men ben variable
and unsteadfast threchours and gylefull whoo that deals with them needs more
to be ware of gyle thanne of craft of peace than of brennynge brondes / of honey
than of kynghthode / they have such maneres that they ben not strong in war
and in bataylle ne true in peace they become gossyps to them that they will
falsely betraye in the gossybrede and holy kynred Eueryche drynketh others
blood when it is shed / they love somd^l^ her nouryce and her playfers
which that souke the same milk that they souked while they were children. And
they pursewe there brethern their cosyns and their other kyne / and despysen
their kyne whiles they live / and avenge their death when they ben slain.
So long has the usage of evil custom endured among them that it has
gotenne the maystrye over them and torneth treason in to kind so ferforthe
that they ben traitors by nature. And alyens and men of strange lands that
dwell among them following their manners that vaunteh there is none but he is
be smetted with their treason aslo. Among them many men pyssen syttyge and
wymmen standing.

There ben many men in that land foul shapen in lymmes and in body / For in
their lymmes they lack the benefyce of kind So that no where ben better
shapen thanne they that been there well shapen and none worse shape^ than they
that been evil shapen. And skylfully nature hurt / and defouled by wyckednes
of living bring the such gromes and euylle ^penne of hem that with
vnlawfulle delyn^ ^yth foul manner and evil living so wyckedly defouled
kind and nature. In this land and wales old wives and wymme^ were wo^re and
been yet as me^ say often to escape the^s^^^ in lykees of hates for to milk
there neyghb^rs ^ine and stole her milk and often gr^y hou^des ren^ after the^
and pursewen the^ and weuen that they be hares Also some by craft of
Nygrama^cye (...) ^^tte swyne for to be reed of color and self the^ in
markettes and fayres But as soon as these swyne pass any water they torn
into their own kind whether it be straw hey gras of ^ues. But these swyne
may not be kept by no craft for te^dure in lykenes of swynes over three days
Among these wonders and other take heed that in the vttermest end of the
world falls new meruaylles and wonders. As though kind played with large
love secretly and far in thendes than openly and nygh in the myddeell.
therefore in this ylo^de be^ many gresely wonders and meruaylles.

Of the meruaylles and wonders of Irlonde. ca. xxviii.
MAny men tellen that in the north side of Irlonde is the land of life. In
that ylonde no man may deye but when they ben old and vexed with great
sykenes / they ben borne out in to the next land and deye there. There is an
other ylonde in Irlonde that no womman there in may bear a child / but yet she
may conceive. Also there is an ylonde in which no deed body may roten. In
vltonia that is Vlstre is an ylonde in a lake wo^derly departed in twene In
that one part is great dysturbaunce and dyscomforth of friends and in that
other party great lykyng and comforth of holy angels There is also saint
Patryks purgatory that was showed at his prayer to conferme his prechynge and
his lore when he preched to mysbyleued men of sorrow and pain that evil me^
sho^ suffer for there evil works. And of Joy and of bliss ye good men shall
receive for there holy deeds he tells that who that suffers the pains of
purgatory / if it be enjoined him for penance he shall never suffer the pains
of hell / but he deye finally withon repentance of sin / as the ensample. is
set more full at this chapter end. Treuisa. But truly noman may be saved
but if he be very repentance what someuer penance he do / and every man that
is very repentaunt as his lives end shall be sekerly saved / though^ he never
here of saint Patryks purgatory. There is an ylond in cona^te Sale / that is
in ye see of Conaccia hallowed by saint Brandon yt has no myse there deed
bodies ben not buried but be^ kept out of the earth and roten not. In Mamonia is
a well who yt wassheth him with that water of ye well he shall wax / hoar on
his heed There is an other well in Vltonia who someuer is wasshe^ therein he
shall never wexe hoar after ward / There is a well in Mounstre or Mamonia \
if any man touch that well anon shall fall great rain in all the prouy^ce
/ and that rain shall never cesse / till a priest that is a clean maiden
sing a mass in a chapel that is fast by and bless the water / and with
milk of a cow yt is of one her besprynge the well. and so reconcyle the
well in this staunge manner. At Glyndal can about the oratory of Saint Keywyn
wyches beryth apples as it were apple trees and ben moore wholesome than sauery.
That holy saint brought forth these apples by prayers for to hele his shylde
that was seek. There is a lake in Vlstre and much fysshe therein / which
is.xxx. mile in length and. in bread. The River Ban renneth out of that lake
into the north Occean and me^ say that this lake began^e in this manner.
There were men in that country that were of evil living coeuntes cu^brutis.
And there was a well in that land in great reverence of old time / And all
way covered / if it were left uncovered the well would rise and drowned all
the land. And so it happed that a wooman went to that well for to fetch
water and hyed her fast to her child yt wept in the cradell / and left the
well uncovered / then the well sprange so fast that is drowned the woman
and her child and made all the country a lake and a fysshe ponde. for to
preue that this is so there it is great argument / that when the weder is
clear / fysshers of that water see in the round under the water round toures
and high shapen as steples and chyrches of that land. In the north side of
Irlonde in the country of Ossyyryens every.vii. year at the prayer of an holy Abbot / tweyne that been wedded a man and a woman must needs be exyled and
forshapen in to lyknes of wolves and abide out.vii. year. And at end of.vii.
year. if they live they come home again / And take again their own shappe /
And than shall other tweyne goo forth in their stead and so forshapen for
other.vii. year. There is a lake in this land if a poole of tree pyghte and
stycked therein that part of the shafte or poole. That is in the earth shall
torn in to iron / And that par^e that abides in the water shall torn into
stone / And the part that abides above shall be tree in his own kind. Also
there is a lake that tornethe hasell in to asshe and asshe in to hasell if it
be done therein. Also in Irlonde ben three Samon lepes there as samons lepe
ayenste a Roche of long speres lenthe. Also in Leginia is a pound there ben
seen colmans birds. The berdes been called certelles and come homely to man's
hand but if men do him wrong or harm. They gone a way and come notte again
/ and the water there shall be bitter and stynke / and he that did the wrong
shall not a stert without wretch and myschyef but if he do amends. R. As
touching Patryks purgatory. ye shall understand Saint Patyrk that was
abbote and not bishop while he preached in Irlonde labored and studied for to
torn thylke wicked men that lived as beestes out other evil life for dread of
pains of hell / and for to conferme hem to good life and they said they
would not torn but some of them might know some what of the great pains and
also of the bless that he spoke of. Then saint Patryk prayed to god almighty
therefore / over lord Ihesu Christ appyered to saint Patryk and took him a
staff and ladde hy^ in to a wild place and showed him there a round pytte
that was derke within and said / that if a man were very repentance and
stable in believe and went into this pytte and walkede therein a day and a
night he should see the lorowes and the pains of evil men / and the Joy and
bliss of good men. Then Christ vanysshed out of patryks sight ^ and saint
Patryk arered and builded there a church and put therein chanons reguler and
^se the pytte about with a wall / and (...) in the church yerde at the eest
end (...) church and fast shette with a strong (...). For no man should
nycely goo in without (...) of the bishop or the poyour of the place. any
men went in and come out again in Patryks time and told of pains and Joy
th^^ they had seen / and the meruaylles that they saw been there yet written
/ and by cause there of many men turned and were converted to right believe. And
also many men went in ^ come never again. In king stephens time ^ynge of
England a kynght yt hight Owayne (...) saint Patryks purgatory and come again
and dwelled ever aft during his life i^ needs of thabbaye of Lude^sis yt is of
thordre Chystews and told many wo^dres yt he had see^ in Patryks
purgatory. That place is called Patryks purgatory / and ye church is named
Reglis No man is enjoined for to goo into ye purgatory. But cou^seylled yt he
should not come therein butte take upon him other penance And if a man have
auowed and bestale and will needs goo therein He shall first go to ye bishop
and then he shall be se^te with letters to the pryoure of the place and they
both shall cou^ceylle him to leave and if he will needs go thereto he shall be
in prayers and in fasting xv. days and after xv. days he shall be how seld
and led to ye door of the purgatory with processyon and letany and yet he
shall be cou^seylled to leave it / and if he be stedefaste and will enter / the
door shall be opened and he blessed and goo in a gods name and hold forth
his way / and the door shall be shytte tylle ye next day / and wha^ the time
is the pryoure shall come and opene ye door. and if the man be come^ he
ledethe him in to ye church with processyo^ and there he shall be fyftene
days in prayers and fasting.

Of the meruaylles of saints of Irlonde. ca. xxix.
HEre Gyraldus makes mind yt as me^ of this nacyon be^ more angrye / than
other me^ and more hasty for to take wretch whiles they be^ alive / so saints
and halowes of this land ben more wretchefull than saints of other lands
Clerks of this lord be^ chaste and saye^ many prays and done great
abstyne^ce a day / and drynketh all night so is afou^ted for a miracle / ye
lechery regneth not there as wine regneth / and ben chosen out of abbayes into
the clergy / and done as monks should / whate they yt be^ evil of the^ be^
worste of al other. So good me^ among them though they be^ but few been
good at ye best / prelates of that country be^ full slow in correccyo^ of
trespass / and besy in contemplacyn and notte in prechynge of gods word
Therefore it is yt all the Saints of ye land been co^fessours and no martyrs
among the^ / and no wonder / for all ye prelates of this land clerks and
prelates should do as to the^ unknown. Therefore wha^ it was put aye^ste ye
bishop of Cassyl how it might be yt so many saints be^ in Irlonde and
never a martyr among them all sythen that ye me^ ben so shrewed and so angry
/ and the prelates so rycheles and sl^we in correccyons of trespass. The bishop
answered frowardely enough and said our men be^ shrewed and angry enough to
themself but to gods servants they leye never hand but do he^ great
reverence and worship But Englyssh me^ come into this land that ca^ make
martyrs and were wont to use ye craft. R. The bishop said so because ye king
Henry ye second was to new come^ into Irlonde frensshly after ye martyrdom
of saint Thomas of canterbury Gir. In this lord in wales and in Scotlond. be^
belles and staves with crooked hedes and other such things for relyques in
great reverence and worship / So ye me^ of this lord dreden more for to
swear upon one of thylke belles and gold staves tha^ upon ye gospel. the
chyfe of all such relyques is holde^ Ihu^s staff yt is at Deuelyn. with yt
which staff they say yt the first saint Patryke drofe ye worms out of
Irlo^de Augus. de. ci^ dei. ca. vii. if me^ axe how it may be that diverse
manner of beestes and of diverse kind that be kyndly gote^ bitwene mayl and
female come and be^ in ylo^des after Noes flode Me^ suppose^ that such bestes
swa^me into ylo^des about and first to the next and so for forth into
other. Or else me^ sayllynge into ylondes brought with he^ such beestes for
love of hu^tynge / or angels that god almyghtes commandment brought such
bestes into ylo^des about or ye earth brought the^ for ye first and fulfilled
tho gods co^mau^deme^te \ ye co^maun: ded ye earth to bring forth gras and
quick bestes

Here ends ye descrypcyo^ of Brytayne / the which contained England wales
and Scotlonde And also because Irlo^de is vnd ye rule of England and of old
time it has so co^tynued Therefore I have set ye descrypcyo^ of the same aft
ye said Brytayne. which I have taken out of Poly cronycon. and also enprynted
by one sometime sco^e master of saint / Albons upon whose soul god have mercy
Amen.
