A Spectaclc for Pe^iu^e^s*
Deus Videt

27. Die Nouemb. 1589.
John Jones of the Parrish of S. Sepulchers in London Gentleman, aged forty
years and above, made oath that he was present about two years past, at the
sign of the George in York, when M. Christopher Crosbitt Gentleman, did lend
unto M. Rochard Swale Doctor of the Civil Law, the Sum of two hundredth pounds
in Angels* with which money the said M. Swale did then say he would buy
certain Lands in Yorkshire, of the value of twenty pounds. And he then heard M.
Swale promise the said M. Crosbitt, that the same land should be assured to him
and his Heirs, until the said money repaid him. And where in effect this
deponent now remembers not touching that matter, ^auing that he thinks in
his conscience, that the said M. Crosbitt had neither the said land assured
him, nor the said money paid him back again.

The Original hereof remains with M. Doctor Swale: being wilfully f^lse in all
points. Thus subscribed. I. I.
NOte, that (through the like wilful perjury of this Jones and Bolton the
Cutpurse) Eulwood and Doughtie were before that time condemned in the
Star Chamber (as it strangely happened) of conspiracy, at the suit of
Brok^smoth, otherwise called Rougecrosse Painter, only for that they (amongst
others) were the means that the same Broksmoth was justly condemde, and burnde
in the hand at Newgate for two notable fellonies. By which like periuries, any
man may be condemned in any cause whatsoever.

God amend that is amiss,
Better make a new world, then amend this.
Fly Falsehood. quod. Fulwood.
