The prologue.
IN so much yt it is necessary to all creatures of christen relygion / or of
falls religyon or gen tyles and machomytes to know their prince or pryces yt
regne upon them / and them to obey. So it is co^modyous to know their noble
acts and deeds / and the circu^stau^ce of their lives. Therefore in ye year of
our lord. M.cccc.lxxxiij. the.xxij. year of ye regne of king Edward the
fourth at saint Albons / so that all men may know ye acts namely of our noble
kings of england / is com pyled together this book / and more over is
translated out of latin in to english / fro the begy^nynge of ye world / the
lignage of Christ from Ada^ till it be comen to Da uid / and fro David / the
kings of israel and of jews / ye hye bys;shops in their days with ye judges
and prophets. The.iiij. princypall realines of the world / yt is to say
Babylon / Perce / Greece / and Rome / and all ye emperors of Rome and popes by
order / and their names: and many a notable fader: with certain of their acts /
as more plainly ensues. And here ben rehearsed ye names of ye auctours yt
translated these chronicles specially. Geffray Nu^moth mon ke in his book of
Brute / saint Bid in ye acts of england. Also Bid in his book of times.
Gyldas in ye acts of Britayn. Willyam Malinesbury monk in ye acts of kings
of england and bishops. Cassiderus of ye acts of emperors and bishops Saint
Austin de ci. dei. Citus Liuius de gestis romanorum. Martyn penitency ary to ye
pope in his chronicles of emperors and bishops / and namely Theobaldus
cartusiensis co^teynynge in his book ye progress of all notable faders / fro
ye beginning of ye world unto our time / with the notable acts of ye same. In
this new tra^slacyon are contained many notable and meruaylous things / and
those ben alleged by auctoryte of many famous ^^^^kes. And yt every man may
know how these chronicles be^ ordered / ye shall understand yt this book is
divided in to.vij. parts. Of ye which the first part con teyneth from Adam
till Brute came in to Britayne. The second part co^teyneth from Brute came
first in to england unto the cite of Rome was builded by Romulus. The third
part co^teyneth sith Rome was builded unto Christ was borne of our lady virgyn
Marye. The fourth part from thens unto ye coming of ye saxons in to england:
The.v. part from thens unto the coming of danes. The.vj. part from thens unto
ye coming of ye normans. The.v. part fro ye normans unto our time / which is
under ye regne of king Edward ye fourth. (...). year / whose noble chronicles
by custom may not be seen. And so in every part of these.vij. parties be
showed ye most and necessary acts of all the kings of england / and their
names written above in ye margent / yt every man may find them soon. And before
ye kings of englondes acts ben written / there is wry-ten ye lignage of Christ
from Adam till y^ christ was borne of our lady with the hye bishops and judges
yt were in ye time and certain of their acts necessary till it be comen where
Christ was borne and after that christ was borne and Peter was pope of Rome /
is showed by order ye names of all ye popes and emperors of Rome before and
after / with certain of their acts breuyately / and many other dyuets things
and meruayles in those men's days falling. And it is showed every thing in
his place / how many year it fei after ye beginning of ye world / and how
long before y^ Christ was borne / and when y^ I come to Christ was borne / tha^
it is wryte^ how long any thing fell after ye Natyuite of Christ. And this is
ye order of this book / and of things spoken of.

ANd as to men desyryng to have a very knowledge of these chronicles or of any
other / it is necessary to know.vj. things. The first is ye states of things
/ and those be^ two. One is fro ye beginning of ye world unto Christ / ye
which is called the state of deuiacyon. The second is from Christ to ye end
of ye world / the which is called the state of reconstliacyon. The second
thing is the diuysyon of times / and those ben three. One is before the law of
Moses / and an other is under the law of Moses / an other is under the law
of grace after Christ dyed. The third is ye gouernyng of kingdoms. And as for
that ye must know / yt though there were four pry^cipal kingdoms / that is
to say / of Babylon / of Persees / of Greeks / and of Romans. Nevertheless
as to ye course of the world / and ye order of holy scripture / ye first
gouernyng was under faders / from Adam unto Moses. The second under judges /
from Moses unto Saul. The third under ky^ges from Saul unto zo^robabel. The
fourth under bisshops / from zorobabel unto Christ. The fourth is ye dyuersite
of laws / and those were five. The first was ye law of nature / and that was
common to all men. The second is ye law or custom of gentyles / when yt under
king Nyno began ye people to worship false gods. The third is under the
law written rose the law of jews / when circu^cysyon divided ye jews from
other people. The fourth is under christ rose ye law of christen men / when
faith and grace of ye sacraments informed ye life of men. The fyfth is under
Machomet rose the law of sarasyns and turks. The fyfth is the nobleness or
vnnoblenes in deeds. And as to these / it is to know that.vij. persons ben
read / of whom the deeds many times are had in mind in hystoryes. That is to
wit of a prince in his realm / of a knight in battle / of a judge in his
place / of a bishop in the clergy / of a polytyke man in the people / of an
husbond man in the house / and of an abbot in his church. And of these are
written many times / the lauds of good men / and the punysshementes of the
cursed men. The syxth is the true countynge of the years. And to that / it is
to be known yt there were viij. manner of nombrynge or countynge of the years.
Three after the Hebrews. Three after the Greeks. One of the Romans. And one now
is after the christen men. The Hebrews three manner of wise begins their
year. After the Hebrews there is the year usual beginning at January / ye
which they use in couenauntes and bargeyns making. And the year leyfull
beginning at March / the which they use in their cerymonyes. And the year
Emergens from May beginning / when they went from Egypt / they use in their
chronicles and calculacyons. The Greeks no^breth their years three manner of wise.

destruccyon of Troy. The first / y^ second / the third / and the fourth. etc.
Than after the chyualry began at the hill of Olympus they notyfyed ye years
after the same Olimpiadu^. And what Olimpiades is / ye shall know after in the
book. The third when they began to have lordshyp of all the world they
notifyed their years these manner of wise. In the year of the regne of Greeks /
the fourth / the.x. the.xv. etc. as it is open in the book of Machabeorum. Than
after the Romans gouernynge the world / counted and no^bred their years (ab
vrbe con dita). The last of all chryste^ men cou^teth their years from ye
Incarnacyon of Christ. And because we be^ chryste^ men we use most to nombre /
from ye beginning of the world unto Christ was borne. And fro Christ was
borne unto our time. And this order is observed and kept in all the book / of
every thing in his place / as is said before.

Explicit prologus.
Hic incipit fructus temporum.
Because of these books made to tell what time of any thing notable was.
Therefore ye begy^nynge of al times shortly shall be touched. For the which
after doctors it is to be known / that four things were made first / and in
one time and of one age / that is to wit / the heaven imperyall / angels
nature / the matere of the four eleme^tes / and time. And that doctors call
work of the creacion / the which was made (before any day or night) of ye
mighty power of god / and was made of nothing. Than after follows ye work of
diuysyon / the which was made in three of ye first days / in which is showed
ye high wisdom of the maker. Than after follows ye arayenge of this work /
in ye which is showed the goodness of the creator / the which was made three
of ye next day following. Vt patet clare in textu gen^.j. The first day god
made and divided the light from the derknes. The second day god made and
ordained the firmament / and diuyded the water from the water. The third day
god made in the which he gadered the waters in to one place / and the earth tho
appeared. The fourth day god made / in ye which day he ordained ye son /
the moon and the sterres / and put them in ye fyrmament. The fyfth day god
made / in the which he ordained fysshes and fowls / and great whales in ye
water. The syxth day god ordained / in the which he made be and man.
The.vij. day god made / and in yt day he rested of all works that he had
ordained / not as in werkyng being weary / but he ceased to make mo new
creatures. Vide pl'a ge^.j.

Understand ye that Adam the first man / of whom it is written in this first
age next following lived.ix. hundred year and.xxx. And gate xxxij. sons / and
as many daughters.

Anno mundi primo. Et ante Christi natiuitatem.v. M.C.lxxxxix.
Here begins the first age during unto the flode of Noe. Adam Eua.

IN the first year of ye world the syxth day god made and formed Adam in the
field da mastene / and Eua of his tybbes / puttyng them in paradyse / and bade
them to keep his commandment / that they should not ete of ye fruit of life
under the pain of death. And ye same day yt they had sinned / anon he cast
them out of paradyse in to ye lord of cursednes that they should live there with
swerynge and sorrow till they dyed. Vide pl'a ge^. (...). This Adam was an holy
man all y^ days of his life / great penan^ce daily he did. And he commanded
his children to live ryghtwylly / and namely that they should avoid in all
wise from the company of Cayn and his children. Nor that they should not mary
with none of them This man Adam was our first fader and for one sin put us
out of paradyse. But through his holy co^uersacion and penance / he gave us
ensample to come to the kingdom of heaven. And he yt will not follow his holy
co^uersacion and example for one sin / ryghtwysly he can not complain on him
/ as we do many. Seth sone to Adam was borne after the beginning of ye
world.C. and. xxx years / and lived.ix.C. and.xij. But Moses ouerskypped an
hundred of those / in the which Abel wept in ye vale of ploracion nygh Ebron.
This Seth for the oil of mercy to be gotten went to paradyse. Delbora was
sister to Abell. Abell was slain of Cayn his brother. This Abell the first
martyr began the church of god. This man after Austyn made ye cite of god /
and he was ye first citezyn of yt cite. And because he was right wise / our
lord received his offrynge. Calmana was wife to Cayn. This Cayn was a cursed
man / and he made the first erthly cite that ever in this world was / in yt
which he put his people for dread / in so much as he used rauyne and
violence. For he trusted such thing to be done to him as he did to other /
therefore he put him and his in to a sure place. This man slew his brother Abel
for envy / and he was punysshed of god / and wandered about in despair. And
was slain of Lameth a blind man.

Anno mu^di. iiij.C.xxxv. Et ante xp^i natiuitatem.iiij. M.ix.C. lxxiiij.
ENos of the line of Christ lived ix.C. year and.v. And began to call the name
of our lord. It might hap he found some words of prayer / or made some
images for god to be worshypped as now is in the church. Chanam lived
after.ix.C. year and.x.

Anno muudi. vij.C.lxxxxv. Et ante Christi natiuitate^.iiij. M. iiij.C.iiij.
MAlaleel of the line of Christ lived. viij.C. and.lxxxxv. year. Iareth of ye
line lived.ix.C. lxij. Enoch of ye same line lived. iij.C. year.lxv. and was a
ryghtwyse man and pleased god. And for his great holiness our lord translated
him in to paradyse / where he lives with Hely in great rest of body and soul
till the coming of Antechryst. Than they shall go forth for the co^fortacyon
of good men. And they shall be crowned with the crown of martyrdom.

MAtusale of Christ's line lived ix.C.lxix. year. And was ye oldest man yt ever
any scripture has my^de of. For when he had lived nygh.v.C. year our lord
said to hy^. Build ye an house and thou wylt / for yet thou shall live five
hundred year. And he answered and said. For so little a time as.v. hundred year
I will build no house. But rested under trees and hedges / and there slepte /
as he was wont to do for a time.

Anno mundi. M. iiij.C.liiij. Et ante Christi natiuitate^.iij. M. vij.C.xlv.
LAmeth was of the age of.vii. C lxxvij. year. This Lameth was the first
against nature and good manners that ordained yt a man might have two wives in
doing his auoutry. And he was sore punisshed of the^ / for they gave hy^ many
a strype. For it is so yt by what thing a man sinned / by the same he is
punysshed. This Lameth slew Cayn not wylfully. But when he was old and blind
he was ladde of achylde ye which trowed yt he had seen a wild be / and
said to his master yt he should shote / and so he slew Cayn / wherefore for
anger he slew the child also. And it is to be known that all crafts or
scyences lyberal / or hand crafts / or of phisyke serving to ye curiosite of
man / are read yt they were fou^den in the children of Lameth. And for they
dradde the peril to come of the flode and of the fire. Therefore Tuball graued
the same crafts in two pyllers / the one was of marble / and that other of
tyle or brycke. Tubal found first the craft to work gold and silver and
yren. And was the first grauer yt ever was. Iabe found first te^toria for
shepeherdes / and pauylyons for other men. Iubal found first ye craft to
play upon an harp and organs / and other musycal instruments he used. Noema
found first the craft for to weue lynnen and woollen cloth / and to draw
threde of woll and flax. And before that time the people used the skynnes of
beestes for their clothes.

Anno mundi. M. vj.C.xlij. Et ante Christi natiuitatem.iij. M.v.C. lvij.
Here begins the second age of the world during to Abraham. Noe.

THe ship of Noe had in length iij.C. cubytes / in bread.l. in altytude.xxx.
Vide pl'a gen^.vj. Know ye after doctors / that a co^uenyent pain this time
was ordained to the world. For than lechery habou^ded the which defouled
men's bodies. And there by water ye earth was washed and cleansed / in sign of
ye promise yt god made to man that there should never be such a flode again.
And the Raynbowe has two pry^cypal colors / the which represent the two
judgments. The water color represents ye flode that is passed. The fire
color betokens the judgment to come / and fire the which we certainly
abide in the end of this world because couetyse shall habou^de / by fire it
shall be burnt / as gold and silver by the fire is wont to be cleansed.

THis Noe was a rightwyse man and found grace an^nst god. When Noe was.v.c.
year of age he had gotten Cham / Sem and Iaphet. That time by ye commandment
of god he began to make a ship / and he made it perfyte in an.C. year / and
the.C. year co^plete our lord appeared again to him and commanded yt he with
his wife and his children and ye wives of them should enter ye ship with all
manner of beestes and al manner of fowls also. etc. And anon ye flode came and
stood above all hills. ^v. cubytes. Vide plura gen^.vij. After the flode came
great dronkennes ^e^yd unto Noe. And through the occasion of that dronke^nes he
blyssed his two sons Sem and Iaphet / for ye faders honor that they had to
him / and for the honest shame that they covered mekely their faders members
when he was slepynge. And his sone Cham for his scornynge and his irreverence
he cursed. And here after saint Austyn is made ye first mencyon of bondage /
and of noblenes contrary to it. For Noe said that Cham should be servant in
bondage to Sem and Iaphet for his ^ureuerence. Nevertheless ye shall not trow
that all that descended of Cham were unnoble men / and of no power. For they
began first to be mighty men of ye earth. As it is open of Nemroth and the king
of Chanaan and Astorum. Nor all of Sem and Iaphet were virtuous and noble and
mighty men / when almoost euerychone fell unto ye crime of ydolatrye / and were
oftentimes oppressed of other men. But this blessing and this cursynge has a
respect to virtue and vice / for yt which a man is called truly a noble man
or an vnnobleman. For he that is virtuous is a noble man / and he that is
vnuertuous is not noble. The same manner of wise those that follows the faith
of Abraham rather were called his children than the Jews / the which carnally
descended from him. Nevertheless they had a spirytuall preuylege of god for the
faders merytes and his blessing. And of these three sons of Noe he being
alive (after the hystory of Philoms) were borne.xxiiij. M. and an.C. men /
without women and children. And they had on them three princes / Nemroth /
Iectan / and Sulphen.

SEm sone to Noe the second year after the flode gate Arphaxat / and
otherwhyle he is called Melchisedech / the which first after ye flode made the
cite of Salem / and now is called Iherusalem. Cham his brother obtained
Afffrica^ / and gate two sons / Chus and Mesraym / and these two gate sons
and daughters / and many a regyon they enhabyted unknown to us in occidentall
ynde. Iaphet was brother unto Cham / and was blyssed of his fader. And this
Iaphet had seven sons / as Gomor / Magog / Maday / Ianam / Tubal / Mosog / and
Iras. And these.vij. gate sons and daughters / and of them came many a regyon.
Vide plura genesis.xv. Arphaxat soneto Sem lived.CCC. and xxx. year / and gate
Elam / Assure / Lude / and Aram / and they gate many children. Vt patet gene.
This Assure because he would not rebel against god in the edyfyenge of the
toure of Babylon / as Nemroth did / therefore he was driven unto the land of
Sennaar land / which was right strange to him / and was not before enhabyted
/ the which was called after his name Assuria / and there he edyfyed a cite
afterward named Ni niue / the which was the metropolytane of all the kingdom
of Assurioru^. Chus sone unto Cham was fader to Nemroth / this Nemroth was a
gyau^t of.x. cubytes long / and he began to be mighty in ye world / and he is
called a boystous hunter before god. This man began that wretched vice of
covetousness by his tyranny / with yt which vice evermore after this world is
fulfilled. And ye pryncypallest kingdom that he had was Babylon / and he had
Archade / Edyssa / Selencia / and the land of Sennaar. Sale sone to Arphaxat
lived CCCC. and.xxxiij. year / and of him in scripture is nothing written / but
that Moses nombred him in the line that comes of Christ. This Sale ga^e a
sone that was named Heber / the which after the Hebrews had the spirit of
prophecye. And of this Heber the Hebrews ben named. For the Hebrews tongue
abode alone in his house in ye confusyon of the language. And that language was
called man's language / the which every man used before the toure of Babylon
was builded. This Heber had two sons / and one was called Iectan / and that
other Phaleg. This Iectan through ensample of Nemroth descendynge fro Cham took
the pryncehode upon the children of Sem. And he had.xiij. sons. But these
people after Jerome are not known of us for fernes of the country / or
mutacyon and chaungynge of ye people / or else of some other manner cause.

Turris Babilonis.


Two hundred and.xxxix. year lived Phaleg. This Phaleg was the younger sone of
Heber / and in his days was made the confusyon of languages. For in his house
abode the old tongue alone and that was hebrewe. Wherefore after saint Austyn /
in him appeared a great steadfastness of ryghtwysnesse / for this house was free
of that pain / as not co^sentynge to the building of the toure. Et sco^m Aug.
there was.lxxij. generacyons / and so there were.lxxij. languages Iectan brother
to Phaleg of Sem / Nemroth prince of Cham / Sulphen of Iaphet / these three
princes with their people gadered them together in ye field of Sennaar /
dredynge the flode to come again said. Let us build a toure that shall reche
to heaven. etc. Gene.xj. Our lord seeing the folysshenes of ye people
co^fou^ded their tongues for their sins In so much yt none understood other
/ and so they were disperpled through all the world. Of ye malice of this
Nemroth books ben written full. And after ye confusyon of ye language he went to
ye land of Perce / and there he taught them to adoure the fire as god. He
left his sone Belus in Babylon / which succeeded after him. And so his
progenye obtained that realm after many years. In this time began many
kingdoms / and the most of all those kingdoms was the kingdom of Scitaru^.
But there were so many rude people in it yt the cite was no worshipped / yet
was it a mighty regyon of dystau^ce. And about this time began ye kingdom of
Egypt the which was changed many times with diverse alteracyons / and also it
is spoken of many times i^ scripture. Noblenes or gentylmen began about this
said time And this noblenes or gentylmen was ordained for many causes. The
first cause was necessite / for wha^ mankind grew sore / and men were prompte
and ready to do hurt and damage to other / it was very necessary to wtstande ye
great malice of ye cursed and wicked people against good and ryghtwyse men.
Thereof a man is called gentylman or a noble man as before other in virtues
notable. whereof saint Ierom says. I se nothing else in noblenes / or in
gentylmen / but yt they are bounden in a certain necessite yt they shall not
recede fro the virtue / and the gen tylnes of their noble au^cetours. The
second was ye diverse worshyppyng of the people / for no man worshypped tha^
but as his natural reason gave / and they knew not verily what they should
worship / for they were so dull of wit that they could pondre no great thing
/ but that was publysshed by the common people. Wherefore it was expedient for
their peace to be kept that they should have princes of noble birth. The
third cause proceeds of some singular strength Many times ye comynaltees were
grieved through enemies coming upon them and than they said yt who someuer
wo^lde defend them fro those perils / he should have the right of noblenes
for hy^m and for his heirs for evermore. And in this manner of wise many are
read to be noble men. The fourth cause of noblenes was haboundau^ce of goods.
Sometime ye people were holden with great penury of meet and drink / and than
they took them and theyrs to some rich man / that through that covenant they
should tempre ye great straytnes of their honger / and after that they should
know him as their lord and a noble man. Also there be found certain noble
men by the prouysyon of god / though they were but few / of yt which some
abode i^ virtue as Dauyd / and some failed anon / as Saul and Jeroboam. And it
is read yt many were noble men by tyranny / of yt which some were destroyed
anon / and some abode in stablenes / as paynyms might.

Anno mundi.ij. M.ix. C.v. Et ante Christi natiuitate^.ij. M. ij.C.lxxxxiiij.
S^ruch lynially descended from our fore fader Adam to Abraham. And Nachor was
his sone / and he lived an.C. and.xlviij. year. And about this time ydolatry
began myghtely. And if ye re uolue and look ye hystoryes / ye shall find that
three things princypally brought men to ydolatry / that is to wyt^ / the
affection that they had to deed men. Dread and flaterynge anenst their princes.
And the dylygence of crafty men about sculptures or grauynges. Wicked spirytes
than entered in to ydolles and gave answers unto the people / and these wicked
spirytes confermed the error of the people myghtely. In so much that who
someuer would not conferme him to their reason / he should grievously suffer the
pain of death. Also there was added and put to these things / the deceyuynge
laud and praysynge of poets / the which wretches and dampened men in to heaven
with their gaye wrytynges exalted. And that same time when deuylles began to
speak so fayrly and so mekely to man / the good lord of his great mercy sent
his aungelles / that they should speak unto his elect men in vysyble manner /
le^st that all mankind should perysshe with that myscheuous error. Belus sone
to Nemroth this time was king of Babylon / and he was the first king of this
world. And this man was he whom the error of the people first byleued
should be a god. Wherefore diverse people named him dyuersly / and some called
him Bell / some Baall / some Baalun / some Beelphagor / and some Beelsabub. And
this unhappy error stood in mankind more than two thousand year. Ninus sone
to Belus the second king of Babylon or of Assuriorum reigned.liiij. year. And
this Ninus desired to have lordshyp and worship / and to that intent that he
might be lord of all the country about him / he gave battle to all that
dwelled nigh about hy^. And because that time the people were rude / and had
not the co^nynge of fyghtyng nor armure / anon he subdued unto him all As^am.
And there was made the first Monarchye in ye eest part ye. And wha^ his heart
was sorry for ye death of his fader Belus / he made to be made to him for his
comfort an image of his fader / unto whom he gave so mighty reverence / yt
what someuer gylty man had fled to that image / there should no man do him no
hurt / and he pardoned him of al his trespace. And through his ensample many a
man began to worship the deed image of their dear friends. Than these malycyous
spirytes seeing the curiosite of the people / hid them within them / and gave
answers unto ye people and said they were gods. And commanded them to do
reverence to them as unto gods. Thus that un happy sin of ydolatry was
brought in / the which repugned myghtely to gods mageste. And in so much
this madness grew / that he should suffer the pain of death that said they were
men but gods.

^Hare sone to Nachor lived. ij.C. and.v. year. This Their after the death of
Aram went from Vr of Calde and passed in to Charram with his children and his
neuewes. And it is said / because he would not worship the fire as Nemroth had
taught / he was banysshed the country. And ye common opinion of the Hebrews
is. Nemroth reigned there the which was called an other name / Amraphel ye king
of Sennaar / whom long time after this Abraham overcame. Vt dici^

Here begynnth the third age of the World during to Dauyd. Abraham.

THe devout and holy story begins here of holy partyarkes yt which
worshipped ye very god and in their worshyppyng they taught it. Vide pl'a
genesisxij. (...) ad fine^. This Abraham a faithful lover of god was borne
the.xliij. year of Ninus king of Babylon. And know ye that the.lxxxv. year of
Abraham by gods goodness ye word of mercy descended on mankind / for than
began to appear ye oraculus of ye promise of god. Vide aug.xxj. de (...). Ite^

Nachor were Abraham's brethren / and Aram gate Loath a rightwyse man and an
holy. And he deserved to be v^sited with angels as his uncle Abraham was. And
for this Loath Ibraha^ smo^e iiij. ky^ges / for they took Loath. Genesis xiiij.
Of whom one was said to be N^roth / but here he is called Amraphel. This
Abraham had many wives / as Sara and Agar. And his children and his brethren
had many children. But for us ye write crony^ies / (...) is not necessary to
speak of all men but of the noble faders. Sed vide pl'a i^ fine ge^^.
Me^chisedech this time was king of Salem. This man was called a right wise
king / for his exceeding holiness. And he offered breed and wine to Abraham / in
sign of a mystery. He was in like wise the priest of ye hye god. Semiramis the
third king of Babylon ordained an army and went in to ynde / and obtained the
country. And so by all Asyam and the kingdom of Assuriorum was dylated And he
multyplyed the cite of Babylon myghtely / and made walls about it. This
Semiramis had a wife / and he for soke her. And it is written that she was
slain of her sone Ninus / because she provoked him to ye v^leful concupiscence
Sic di. Aug.xviij. de ci. dei. And ye master i^ his stories says yt she
wedded her own sone / and he gate a child on her / the which ordained
Babylon to be ye heed of all this realm. Ninus the fourth king of Babylon was
sone to great Ni nus. Of this man little is wryte^ / but yt he slew his own
mother / as is said before. Arrius was ye fyfth king of Babylon. And under him
was borne Ysaac.

ALso Ysaac sone of Abraham of ye line of Christ lived.C.lxxx. year. This ysaac
had a wife called Rebecca / and on her he gate two sons Esau and Jacob. This
Esau sold his enherytau^ce to his brother Jacob. And he was the fader of
Idumeoru^ / and he had in possessyon the hill of Seyr / and put first mares to
asses / whereof was engendered mules. About this time.xxx. lordshyps and Gomorra
for their horrible sin were overthrown. The wife of Loath lokynge backwarde /
turned in to a salt stone / she weth that no man in the way of delyberacyon
should desire things past. Hec Aug. de ciuitate dei.

year of his faders age and he lived.C. (...). year. This time zerses was king
of Babylon / under whom was borne Jacob / and he was ye seventh king of
Babylon. Armaui^tre was king after him. And after saint Austin in ye man's
days our lord appeared to Ysaac promising him those things yt which he
promised to his fader. Belocus the.ix. king of Babylon was after this man. And
under Belocus or in his time our lord spoke with Jacob / promysyng him yt he had
promised to his fader the which were two. The possession of the land of
promyssyon and Chanaam / and ye benediccyon of all ye people in his seed / yt
which is our lord Jesus christ. Abraham about this time decesed / and was
buried in Nebron. Inachus the first king that ever was in Greece was this time /
for than the kingdom began. Phoromius was king after him / and he ordained
laws to the Greeks. etc.

Phares Esron / and of these men little is had in scripture: but Matthew reherseth
them. Belus in this Phares days was king of Assuriorum / or of Babylon / and
he was ye.x. king / under whom Ysaac decesed. Athlas ye great astronomer was
this time / yt which is lykened to bear up heaven on his sholders / because of
his knowing in sterres. Sarapis was the third king of Arguiorum / or of
Grecoru^ / and this Sarapis was otherwise called Apis / and he came in to Egypt
with a mighty navy / and there decesed / and was made of ye blind gentyles ye
egypcyens the gretest god among them. And yt time began a meruaylous
supstycyon in ydolatry of a calfe of two colors / which they called Apem /
and ye calfe dyed / the deuylles procured a like calfe to yt for to be made /
yt they might deceive ye rude people. And after yt the children of israel did
so in like wise (vt patz) And what thing could be more wretched or folisshe in
man having reason. Argus was ye fourth king of Greeks / after whom ye noble
cite of Argus took his name. Cicrophes edyfyed Athenes in Greece / and this cite
was ye nouryssher of liberal science and of many philosophers / yet they were
deceived by devils / and great supsticiosite in ye cite was made (vide Augus.
and mirabile^ fabula^ reperies) Omogires was ye first man yt put oxen to ye
plough. Belus this time was king of Babylon / and he was the.x. king of yt

Joseph / and exalted him for thinterpretacyon of his dremes (vide sci^am

about this time was borne. Dafrus was the. (...). king of Babylon / and Moses
was borne under him in Egypt. C^crops was the first king of Athenes. And
after saint Austyn the Greeks wrote many lesynges in their stories that time /

there was the university of Greeks.

the first judge of Israel ye ever was / and he was judge.xl. year. This Moses
was ye most excellent prophet that ever god made / and the most notable
writer of stories / and of his loving heaven and earth speaks. For he saw our

the apostle. Aaron ye first bishop lived an C.xxiij. year. This Aaron was
called of god in to ye dignite of ye hye priest / or of a bishop / and was
ordained ye eternal testa meant to himself and them yt came after him for ye
great power of preesthode. When he was an.C.xxiij. year of age he dyed and was
buried in ye hill of Hor. And his sone Heleazarus succeeded in ye bysshopryche.
Pharao Boccaris this time was king of Egypt / and this Pharao would not here

punysshed with.x. plages. Vt pz oxod. And after he with all his host were
drowned in the reed see. Nason sone to Amynadab was prince of ye trybe of Judah
in ye deserte. And about this time ye law of god was given in ye hill of Synay
/ and ye book of Leuitici was written / and an other book was called Nu meru^ /
and the tabernacle was ordained. The book of deuteronomiu^ was made. Balaam was
prophet and was slain.

SAlmon of the line of Christ was about this time / and had a wife that hight
Reab. Moses about this time decesed / ye water of flome Jordan was dry /
Ierico was taken / the son stood in ye firmament vnmeuable (Historia li.
Iosue incipit: et Iudicu^) Iosue ye second Judge of Israel was a mighty man in
battle / and the first in deserte / he overcame Amalech / and after Moses he
was ordained of god judge of Israel / of whom ye batayles / the works / and
ye religyous life / ye may se in ye book of Iosue written. Eleazar was the
second bishop / and he and Iosue divided the loud of promyssyon to the
children of Israel. Of hy^ descended almoost all ye bishops unto Christ.
Othonyel of ye trybe of Judah was ye third judge / and this man delivered ye
children of israel by battle from ye realm of Mesopotamye. This man took Axam
to his wife / ye which asked ye vale lands / above and bynethe of her fader
Caleph. Vt pz iudic.j. Aoth was the fourth judge of Israel. This man subdued
Eglon ye king of Moab / and delivered the children of Israel. This was a mighty
man in battle / and he used the one as well as ye other for his right hand.
About this time ye king of ytalye began / and many times their names be
changed / of yt which progenye ye Romans show more clearly. Ianas was ye
first king in ytalye / and afterward of ye rude gentyles he was worshypped as
god / faynynge hy^ to have two faces For they worshypped his feast in ye
begy^nynge of ye year: as he were ye end of the last year / and ye beginning
of ye first. And of him ye month of January has his name. Amictus was
ye.viij. king of Babylon / under whom Iosue decesed.

BOos sone to Salmon of ye line of Christ was this time / but of hy^ is little
written / save ye Mathewe nombreth him in ye genealogye. As doctors say /
there was made skyppynge of na mes between Boos and Obeth. For at the lest
between them were. ij.C.lxxij. year The which time to one man may not be
referred / and therefore here many things is spoken or I come again to ye line
of Christ. Nicolaus delyra (...) su^t tres Boos vnus post aliu^. Sangar was ye
v. judge of israel / but he lived no years. Delbora was ye.vj. judge. This Del
bora was a woman / and for ye grace of her prophecy was given to her honor yt
she judged israel. She by ye commandment of god called Baruch yt he should go
fight with ye enemies of Israel / and ye children of Israel gate ye victory
against Iabyn king of Chanaan and Cizaram ye prince of his chiualry / and he
destroyed them. Vt pz iudicu^.iiij. Phenies was bishop And this Phenies yet a
young man for gods sake slew many lecherous men and therefore our lord was
pleased with him. Saturnus this time was king in ytalye / and he was ye second
king there / this Saturnus is said to come from ye land of Cretens into ytaly
/ whom by ydolatry through a meruaylous blyndnes they said he was no man but a
god And yet they said that he reigned upon them as their king / and he taught
men to dong their feldes. And of Saturnus the Romans were called Saturniam.
Picus was sone to Saturnus / and or he was king in ytalye he was king in
Laurentyn / and after his decesse of the gentyles was worshypped for a god.

GEdeon the.vij. judge of Israel was this time / this Gedeon sub dued.iiij.
kings. Oreb / zebee / zeb / and Salmana. And he subdued Madean to Israel. Vide
pl'a Iudicu^.vj. vij. et.viij. Bocci was bishop in Israel than. Abimelech
the.viij. judge in Israel was natural sone to Gedeon / and he was not called
of god / but malycyously took on him the pryncehode of Israel. And he
slew.lxx. of his brethren / wherefore he ended his life myscheuously. Vt pez
iudicu^.ix. Tola was the.ix. judge of Israel / and this man guyded him after ye
old governance of judges by ye manner of direccion and counsel / more than by
domi nacio^. Bocci was bishop about this time / but of hy^ is little written.
Iayr the.x. judge of Israel had.xxx. sons / whom he made princes of.xxx.
cytees And because there were good men and ru led to ye pleasure of god.
Therefore in the days of those two men / Israel drew to our lord / and
therefore all thing came and was in prosperity and weith. Fannus was the.iiij.
king of ytalye / and he was king of Laure^tyn also. Latinus was king in
ytalye after Fannus / and of this Latinus was ye ky^gdom called Latino^. And
Carme^tis daughter to Euand^^ found first latin lettres. Thauranus about this
time was king of Babylon or of Assurior / and under this man Troy was
destroyed first. The occasyon of ye battle of Troy began for a little thing in
so much as Lamydon king of Troy teceyued not Hercules and Jason with due honor
as they should have be^ received and of so little a trespace how many harms
and hurtes grew. Sibilla delphis ca before ye battle of Troy prophesied how a
child should be borne of a virgyn without manues seed. Lamydon king of Troy was
slain and his daughter Eriona was taken in to Greeks land. For yt which
followed mighty battle and most ferefull myscheues. Vide historiam troiana^.
Hercules with Jason destroyed Iliu^ or Troy / the which anon after was
builded of Priamus sone to Lamydon. This Hercules did many meruaylous things /
and many mighty batayles / and infynyte lesynges ben feigned on him. It y^ last
wha^ he had ouertome^ much people he was betrayed by a sherte y^ Deyanira his
wife sent him enuenymed / and wha^ he might not suffer the pain / he ran in
to a fire and burnt himself / and when he was deed he was worshypped of the
gentyles for a god.

AFter the death of Iayr Judge of Israel / the people of Israel added new
sins to their old / and our lord took them in to the power of ye
philistiens / and to the children of Amon.xviij. year / and they were greatly
oppressed: and tha^ they cried to our lord. Tha^ Iepte was enspyred with
almighty god / and faught against Amon and the sedycyous people of ye hill of
Effraym. And for an vnprudent voice he slew his own daughter folyshly / and
did sacriif^ce to god with her Iudic.xi. et.xij. Ozy this time was bishop in
Israel / and he was of ye seed of Aron by ye line of Eleazari / the which deed
/ through ye prouysyon of god ye bysshopryche turned to ye line of Ythamar
an.C. and.xx. year / in yt which line Hely was the first high bishop / and
Abiathar was the last. Ebessam was judge in Israel.vij. year / and he was
the.xij. judge and he was named otherwise Boos / the which wedded Ruth.
Abialon ye. xiij judge of Israel was judge.x. year. And under these times ye
children of Israel were quyete / and therefore no notable things were done in
these days. Abdon the.xiiij. judge governed in Israel.viij. year. And about
this time ye hystory of Ruth was written. Authamis this time was king of
Assuriorum. And Priamus king of Troy sone to Laomedon builded his cite again
meruaylously strong / and began battle with the Greeks to his own hurt / and
he had a sone was called Hector a leyfull gotten sone by his wife Eccuba. This
man was faithful and wise / and incomparable of strength and noblenes. This
Priamus had an other sone that was called Paris / the which took away fro ye
lord of Greeks Helena wife to Menelaus ye king. Agamenon the king brother to
Menelaus ye leder of al ye Greeks host faught against Troy / and at the last he
wanne ye cite falsely / and to ye gre kes most shame and sclau^dre yt might be.
For certainly yt might be called an unhappy battle where no man gives lo uyng
to ye Greeks / but every man repor teth shame. Eneas was king in yta lie.iij.
year. And this Eneas after that Troy was destroyed of ye Greeks came in to
ytalye with.xx. ships / and did mighty batayles there. And this man had
wedded Priamus daughter Elinsuram. And he was made a god through the error of
the common people / and of this man came Julius cezar and Octauianus Augustus.
Vlixes an eloquent man among all the Greeks after many perils on the sea /
went home to his Penelopem the most faithful and the most chaste woman that
is read of. And the Greeks perisshed wretchedly after that they had destroyed
Troy both on the water and on the land as they went homewarde again. And
that was the pryncypall date of their writing after that vyctory. For they
wrote their hystoryes and other wrytynges thus. Anno primo v^ secu^do. etc.

But of him many times is made mencyon in holy scripture. For of him descended
Christ our savior. This time Hely was judge and bishop in israel the which
had.ij. sons / Ophni and Phi nees / and for he corrected them not sufficiently
/ he and they were punisshed both of our lord / for they were slain of ye
Philistie^s / and Hely fell of his sete and brake his neck. This Hely was

holy man / and borne of a barayn mother many a day / and he mynystred before our
lord from a child to his age / and was not high bishop / but he judged
Israel all ye days of his life / and was ye very pro phete of god. Two kings

AScanius the.vij. king of ytaly was sone to Eneas / and builded ye cite of

the.viij. king of ytaly / the which Siluius was fader unto Brute king of
Brytayn / now called England. And I leave of the kings of ytalye for they did
but little noble things till it be co men to Romulus and Remus ye builded Rome
/ and than shall those kings come again. And now to proceed to ye chronicles of
England / for yt which namely this book is made. Venys and Padua were builded
about this time of ye resydue of the Troyans. Homere ye great poet about this
time was / yt which wrote and feigned gloryously many a lesynge.

Incipit regnum Britannie / nunc dicitur Anglia.
Here may ye se how England first began at Albion. Albion.

Before that I will speak of Brute it shall be showed how the land of england
was first named ^byon and for what cause it was so named.
IN the noble land of Sirrie there was a noble king and mighty and a man of
great renome yt was called Dioclesyan that well and worthily hy^ governed and
ruled through his noble chyualry So yt he conquered all the lands about him /
so that almoost all ye kings of the world to hy^ were attendau^t. It befell
thus yt this Dioclesian spoused a ge^tyll damoysel yt was wonders fair / yt
was his uncles daughter Labana / and she loved him as reason would / so yt he
gate on her.xxxiij. daughters / of yt which ye eldest was called Albyne / and
these damoyselles when they came unto age be came so fair yt it was wonder /
whereof Dioclesian anon let make a somnynge and commanded by his lettres that
all the kings yt held of him should come at a certain day as in his lettres
were contained to make a feast royal. At which day thither they came / and
brought with them admyrats / princes / dukes and noble ch^ualry. The feast was
royally arrayed and there they lived in joy and mirth enough yt it was wonder
to wit. And it befell thus ye Dyoclesyan thought to mary his daughters among
all those kings yt were at ye solempnite. And so they spoke and did that
Albyne his eldest daughter and all her systers rychely were married to.xxxiij.
kings yt were lords of great honor at this solempnite. And when this was
done every king took his wife and ladde them in to their own country / and
there made them queen's. And it befell thus afterward yt this dame Albine became
so stout and so stern that she told little price of her lord / and of hyy^
had scorn and despyte / and would not do his will but she would have her own
will in diverse matters. And all her other systers euerychone bare them so evil
against their lords yt it was wonder to wit. And for as much yt them thought
that their husbondes were not of so hye parentage come^ as their fader. But
those kings yt were their lords would have chastysed them with fair manner
upon al love and frendshyp yt they should amend their evil condicyons. But all
was for naught / for they did their own will in all thing yt them lyked and
had of power Wherefore those.xxxiij. kings upon a time and often times bette
their wives For they wend that they would haueamended them and their tatches
and wyckednes. But of such conditions they were that for fair speech and
warning they did all ye worse / and for betynges eftsoon much the worse.
Wherefore the king yt had wedded Albyne wrote the tatches and condicyons of his
wife Albyne / and the lettre sent to Dyoclesyan her fader. And when the other
kings herd that Albynes lord had sent a lettre to Dioclesyan / anon they
sent lettres sealed with their seals the condicyons and tatches of their
wives. When the king Dioclesyan saw and herd so many complayntes of his
daughters / he was sore ashamed and became wonderssy angry and wroth toward his
daughters / and thought how he might amend it that they so mysoyd / and anon
sent his lettres to the.xxxiij. kings yt they should come to him / and bring
with them their wives euerychone at a certain day / for he would there chastyse
them of their wyckednes if he might i^ any manner wise. So that ye kings came
all at ye time and day that tho was set between him and the kings. Dioclesyan
received them with much honor / and made a solem^e feast unto all that were
underneath his lordshyp. And the third day after that solempnite ye king
Dioclesyan sent after his.xxxiij. daughters yt they should come and speak with
him in his chamber. And wha^ they were come / he spoke to them of their
wyckednes and of their cruelte / and angerly them reproved and blamed and said
to them. That if they would not be chastysed / they should lose his love for
evermore. And when ye ladies herd all this they became abashed and greatly
ashamed and said to their fader yt they would make all ame^des. And so they
departed out of their faders chamber. And Albyne that was ye eldest sister
ladde them all to her chamber / and tho made to void al yt were therein / so yt
no psone was among them but she and her systers together. Tha^sayd this Albyne.
My fair systers / well we know yt the king our fader us has reproved /
shamed and despised / for because to make us obedyent to our husbondes but
certainly yt shall I never whiles ye Ilyue / sith that I am come of a more hyer
kings blood than mine husbonde is. And when she had thus said / all her systers
said ye same. And than said Albyne. Well I wot fair systers / yt our
husbondes have co^playned unto our fader upon us / wherefore he has us thus
foul reproved and despised / wherefore systers my counsel is yt this night
when our husbo^des ben a bed / all we with one assent to kytte their throtes /
and than we may be^ peace of them / and better we may do this under our faders
power tha^ any where else. And anon all ye ladies consented and granted to
this counseyle. And wha^nyght was comen / the lords and ladies went to bed.
And anon as their lords were a^^ept / they kytte all their husbo^des throtes
/ and so they show them all. When Dioclesian their fader herd of this thing
/ he became wroth right furyously against his daughters / and anon he wole
them all have brent. But all the harons and lords of S^rrye counseyled not so
for to do such straytnes to his own daughters / but should boyde ye land of
them for evermore / so that they never should come again / and so he did. And
Dioclesyan yt was their fader anon commanded them to go in to a ship / and
delivered to them ^itayles for half a year. And when this was done / all the
systers went in to the ship and sailed forth in ye see / and betoke all
their friends to Appolyn yt was their god and so long they sailed in the sea
^yll at the last they came and arrived in an isle yt was all wyldernes. And when
dame ^^yne was come to ye land and all her systers this ^^byne went first
forth out of ye ship and said to her other systers. For as much as I am ye
eldest sister of all this company / and first this land have take / and for as
much as my name is Alb^ne / I will ^ this land be called Albion after my^^
own name. And anon all her systers granted to her with a good will. Than
went out of ye ship all ye systers and took the land Albion as their sister
called it and there they went up and down and found neither man ne woman ne
child but wild beestes of diverse kinds. And when their ^ttayles were
dispruded and sailed / they fed them with herbs and fruytes in season of yt
year / and so they ^^ued as they best might / and after yt they took flesh of
diverse beestes and bera^^ wonders fa^^e / and so they desired man's company /
and man's kind them fay^ed. And for here they wexed wonders couragyous of
kind / so that they desired more man's company than any other solace or
mirth. When the devil yt per^^yued went by diverse countries and took a body of
ye air / and lykyng natures sh^^ of men / and came in to ye land of Albion /
and lay by those women and shad tho natures upon them / and they conceived and
brought forth gyau^tes. Of which one was called Gogmagog / and another
Langerigan And so they were named by diverse names / and in this manner they came
forth and were borne horrible gyau^tes in Albion And they dwelled in caves and
in hills at their will / and had the land of Albion as them lyked / unto ye
time that Brute arrived and came to Totnes yt was in the isle of Albion / and
there this Brute conquered and disco^fyted ye gyau^tes above said.

Explicit prima pars.
Here begy^neth now how Brute was gotten / and how he slew first his mother /
and after his fader. And how he conquered Albion / that after he named Brytayne
after his own name / that now is called England / after the name of Engyst of
Saxonye. This Brute came in to Brytayne about the.xviij. year of Hely.
BE it known that in ye noble cite of great Troy there was a noble knight and
a man of great power that was called Eneas. And when ye cite of Troy was lost
and destroyed through them of Greece. This Eneas with all his meyny fled thens
and came in to Lombardy. And tho was lord and governor of that land a king
that hight Latyne. And another king there was ye hight Turocelyne that
strongly warred upon this king Latyne / ye oftentimes did him much harm. And
when this king Latyne herd yt Eneas was come / he received him with much
honor / and him with held for as much as he had herd of hy^ and wist well yt
he was a noble knight and a worthy of his body and of his deeds This Eneas
helped king Latyne in his wa^^^ / and shortly for to tell / so well and so
worthily he did / that he slew Turocelyne / and dyscomfyted him and all his
people. And when all this was done / king Latyne gave all ye land that was
Turocelynes to this noble man Eneas i^ marriage with Lauyne his daughter the
most fairest creature that any man wist. And so they lived together in joy and
mirth all the days of their lives. And after Ascanius sone to Eneas wedded a
wife / and upon her he gate a sone that was called Siluine. And this Siluyne
when he could some reason of man vnwytyng his fader and against his will
acqueynted him with a damoysel that was cosyn to Lauyne that was king Latynes
daughter ye queen that was Eneas wife / and brought the damoysell with child.
And when Ascanius his fader it wist / anon let inquire of the wysest masters
and of the gretest clerks what child the damoysell should bring forth. And
they answered and said / that she should bring forth a sone that should kill
both his fader and his mother. And so he did. For his mother dyed in berynge of
him. And when this child was borne his fader let call him Brute. And ye
masters said that he should do much harm and sorrow in many diverse places /
and after he should come to great honor and worship. This king Ascanius dyed
when god would / and Siluyne his sone received the land / and made him
wonder^ly well beloved among his people. And so wha^ Brute that was Siluynes
sone was.xv. year old he went upon a day with his fader for to play and
solace. And as Brute should have shot unto an heart his arowe myshapped and
glanced / and so there Brute slew his fader.

How Brute was driven out of the land / and how he held him in Greece.
ANd when this mischau^ce was befallen / all ye people of the land made great
sorrow / and were sore dyspleased. And because thereof they drove Brute out of
ye land / and would not suffer him among them. And when he saw that he might
not abide there / he went from thens in to Greece / and there he found vij.
thousand men that were of ye kynrede of Troy / and were comen of great blood
as the story tells / as of men and women and children / the which were all
holden in thraldom and bondage of king Pandras of Greece / for ye death of
Achylles that was betrayed and slain at Troy This Brute was a wonders fair
man and a strong and huge of his age / and of glad chere and semblau^t / and
also worthy of body / and was well beloved among his people. This king Pandras
herd speak of his goodness and condicyons / and anon made him to dwell with
him. So that Brute became wonders preuy and much beloved with ye king / and
dwelled long time with the king. So at ye last they of Troy and Brute spoke
together of kynrede and lygnage and of acqueyntau^ce / and there complained them
unto Brute of their sorrow and of their bondage / and of many other shames ye
king Pandras had done to them / and to Brute they said upon a time. Ye be a
lord of our lignage and a strong man and a mighty / be ye our capytayne and
governor / and we will become your men / and fulfill al your co^mau^ dementes
/ and bring us out of this wret chednes and bondage / and we will fight with the
king for troth / with the grace of ye great god we shall overcome him and we
shall make you king of this land / and to you do homage / and of you we shall
hold for evermore. Brute had tho great pity of their bondage yt they were
brought in / and pryuely went fro ye kings court / and tho that were of Troy
went and put them in to woods and in to mountains / and held them there /
and sent unto king Pandras that he should give them license for to depart
safely out of his lord and kingdom / for they would no longer dwell in his
bondage. When king Pandras herd this / he was sore vexed and anoyed / and tho
swear that he would ^e them euerychone / and ordained a great power / and went
toward them for to fight with them. But Brute and his men manly them defended
and fyersly fought / and slew all the kings men that none of them escaped /
and took ye king and put him in prison / and ordained a counsel among them
self what they might do with the king. And some said that he should be put to
death / and some said that he should be exyled out of the land / and some said
yt he should be brent. And than spoke a wise knight yt was called Mempris and
said to Brute and to all them of Troy. If king Pandras would yield him and have
his life / I counsel yt he give unto Brute (that is our duke and our
souerayn) his daughter Ge^^og^^ to wife / and in marriage with her an hundred
ships well arrayed / and all his treasour of gold and silver / of corn and
of wine and as much as we need of one thing and other / and than go we out of
this land and ordeyne us a lord else where / for we nor none of our kynrede yt
come after us shall never have peace in this land among them of Greece / for we
have ^^ayne so many of their knights and of other friends that evermore war
and dyscord shall be among us. Brute tho and all his folk consented gladly to
ye counsel / and this thing they told to king Pandras And he for to have
his life / granted as much as they demanded / and anon gave unto Brute the
fair lady Gennogen his daughter to wife / and an hundred ships with as much
as them (...) of all vytayles / as before was ordained. Tha^ Brute took his wife
and all his men that forsook the land of Great and went to the sea / and had
wind and weder at their will / and came the third day in to an isle that was
called Logres. This Brute anon sent of his men to land for to espy ye manner
of ye cou^trce. And they found an old cite all wasted and forlet / so that
there was neither man nor woman therein dwelling. And in the myddle of this
cite they found an old temple of a fair lady that was called Diane the
goddess. And they came again unto Brute and told him what they had seen and
found / and they cou^seyled him to go and do sacrifyce unto dame Diane / for
she was wont to give answer of what thing that me^ asked her / and namely
unto them that honor her with sacryfyce. Brute went unto yt image and said.
Diane noble goddess that all thing have in thy might / wyndes / waters /
woods / feldes / and all things of ye world / and all manner of beestes that been therein / unto you I make my prayer / that ye counsel me and tell / where
and in what pla^ce I shall have a co^uenyent place to dwell in with my folk.
And there I shall make in the honor of the a fair temple and a noble / wherein
ye shall always be honored. When he had done his prayer / Diane answered in
this manner. Brute said she go even forth thy way ouet the sea in to france
toward the west / and there ye shall find an isle that is called Albion / and
that isle is becompassed all with the sea / and no man may come therein but it be
by ships / and in that land were wont to dwell gyauntes / but now it is not
so / but all wyldernes / and that land is destenyed and ordained for you and
for your people.

How Coryn became Brutes man / and how king Goffar was discomfyted.
ANd when Brute had this answer of Diane the goddess / anon he let wy^de up
the ancres and sailed in to the hye see. And wha^ he and his men had sailed.xx.
days and more / they found fall beside a coost of the sea a. M. men of the
kynrede of Troy / and their sovereign master was called Coryn. And when Brute
wist whens they were / he took them with much joy in to his ships / and so he
ladde them forth with him. This Coryn there became Brutes man / and to hy^ did
homage. And so long they sailed forth in the sea till they came in to Gascoyne
/ and anon they arrived in ye haven of Lyegers / and there they dwelled.viij.
days for to rest them / and to amend their sails there as they had need. Ty
dynges soon came to king Goffar that was lord of that land how that much
people of strange land were arrived in to his land in the haven of Lyegers
wherefore he was sore angered and anoyed that they came and arrived in his land
without his license and his leave. And anon ordained him a great power for to
drive out Brute and to destroy him and all his people. But it was so ye king
Goffar was dyscomfyted and all his people / and himself fled in to france
for to have help and socour. And in yt time reigned in france.xij. kings /
and.xj. of them assembled a great power for to belpe Goffar / and for to fight
against Brute. This Goffar dwelled with the kings of france half a year and
more. And in the mean time that Goffar was in france / Brute and his company
destroyed all the land of Gascoyne / and let take all the treasour that king
Goffar had / and made it to be brought in to his ships. And this Brute found
in that land a fair place and a conueny ent / and there he let make a fair
castle and a strong. When this was all done / king Goffar came from france
and.xj. kings with him / and brought with him.xx. M. men for to fight with Brute
and his company. And Brute had but.vij. M. and.iij. C. men / and never theles
when ye two hoostes met together / Brutes folk through help of him self and
of Turyn his cosyn and of Coryn / y^ well and manly him defended / so y^ within
a while they had slain of y^ frenshmen moo than two. M. Anon all tho y^ were
alive fled away. And in this battle Turin Brutes cosyn was slain / and
Brute let bury him worthily when he had space in ye castle yt he had made /
and tho let call yt same castle Tours / for because of the name of Turin yt
there was buried And yet unto this day there is a noble cite yt is called
Tours. And when king Goffar wist yt Turyn was deed / he came again with his men
and gave a strong battle to Brute. But Brute and his men were so weary for
fighty^ge yt they might no longer endure / and than went in to his castle with
all his men: and made y^ gates fast for to save them / and took counsel
among them what they should do. Brute and Coryn gave counsel and ordained
pryuely y^ Coryn should go out and busshe him in a wode till on y^ morrow / so
yt in the morning when Brute should fight with his enemies / Coryn should come with
his folk on ye one side and slay and do all ye harm yt he might. And on the
morrow at the dawning of y^ day Brute went out of the castle and fought
fyersly with his enemies / and they manly defended them. But within a little time
Bru^te and his men slew. viij hundred of king Goffers men / and than came
Corin with the bussheme^t / and he and his company smote to the ground all those
y^ would stand or abide / so ye king Goffar and his company were discomfyted
/ and fast they began to flec. And Brute and Coryn with their company fyersly
them pursued / and slew moo of them in the fleing than they did in y^
battle. And in this manner Brute had y^ victory / nevertheless Brute made much
sorrow for his cosyn Turyn that there was slain and other also that he had lost
of his men / that is to say.vij. hundred and.xv. the which nobly he buried in
the same castle of Tours / there where that he had buried Turyn his cosyn.

How Brute arrived at Totnes in the isle than called Albion / and of the
wrastlyng that was between Coryn and Gogmagog.


ANd wha^ all this was done Brute would no longer dwell there for to fight and
lose his men. For king Goffers people might every day increase moo and moo /
and Brutes men lessed / and therefore he took all his men and went unto the sea
/ and had wind and weder at their will. And the fyfth day after they arrived
in an haven at Corns / and came in to this realm yt than was called Albion /
where they found neither man nor woman / save great gyauntes / and they
dwelled in mountains and in cauernes. And Brute saw the land was fair and
at his ly king / and was good also for him and for all his people / as Diane
ye goddess had behyght him. And thereof was Brute wonders glad / and let
assemble upon a day all his folk to make a solemn sacrifyce and a great
feast in ye honor and reverence of Diane the goddess / which had cou^seyled
hy^ first to come in to this land. And wha^ they had done their sole^ pnite /
as they sat at their meet upon a day there came in upon them.xxx. gyauntes /
and slew.xxx. of Brutes men. Brute and his me^ anon stert up and fought with
the gyauntes / and slew them euerychone / save one yt was called Gogmagog /
and he was master of all y^ gyau^tes and he was stronger and hyer than any of
the other / and Brute kept him for to wrestle with Corin his man / for he was
greter and hyer than any of Brutes men from the gyrdelstede upward. Gogmagog
and Corin undertook there for to wrestle / and so together they went / and
wrastled a long time / but at the last Gogmagog held Coryn so fast yt he
brake two rybbes in his side / wherefore Coryn was sore angry / and there he
took Gogmagog between his arms and cast him down upon a roche / so that
Gogmagog brake all to pieces / and so he dyed an evil death / and therefore the
place is called yet unto this day the saute of Gogmagog. And tha^ after Brute
gave all that country unto Corin And than Corin called it after his name
Cornewayle / and his men ben called Cornewayles / and so should men of that
country be called for evermore. And in that country dwelled Corin and his men
/ and they made towns and houses / and euhabyted that land by their own will.

How Brute builded London / and called this land Brytayn / and Scotlonde
Albanye / and Wales Cambar.
London.


BRute and his men went forth and saw about in diverse places where yt they
might find a good place and couenable that they might build and make a cite
on / for him and for his folk. And so at the last they came by a fair river /
which now is called Temmes / and there Brute began to build a fair cite /
and called it new Troy / in remembrance of great Troy / from the which
place all their lygnage was comen. And this Brute let fell down wodes / and
let ere and sow lands / and let mawe down meadows for ye sustenau^ce of hy^
and his people. And tha^ he departed ye land to them / so yt each of them had
a part and place to dwell in. And tha^ Brute let call all this land Brytayne
after his name and his folk Brytons. And this Brute had gote^ on his wife
Gennogen.iij. sons yt were worthy of deeds / ye first was called Lotryn / ye
second Albanak / and the third Cambar / and Brute bare crown in the cite of
new Troy.xx. year after y^ time that ye cite was made. And there he made the
laws yt the Britons hold And this Brute was wondersly well be ioued among
all his people. And Brutes sons also loved wondersly well together. And when
Brute had sought all the land in length and bread / he found a land yt
joined to Brytayne in the north And that land Brute gave to Albanak his sone /
and let call it Albanye after his name / yt now is called Scotlonde. And Brute
found an other country to ward the west / and gave that to Cambar his other
sone / and let call it Cambar after his name / and now it is called Wales. And
when Brute had reigned.xx. year / than he dyed in the cite of new Troy.

How Lotryn that was Brutes sone entered with much honor / and governed the
land well and worthily.
AFter Brute reigned Lotryn his sone / that was ye second king in Brytayn. And
he began to regne the second year of Samuel. This Lotryn was crowned king with
great solempnite of all Brytayne: And after wha^ he was crowned king / Albanak
and Cambar his brethren departed in to their own countries / and there they
lived with much honor and worship. And Lotryn reigned well and wisely / and
was much beloved of his people. And it befell so yt as Albanak dwelled in his
his own land with much honor and worship / there came king Hum bar of
Hunlonde with a great power / and ^^ryued in Albanye / and would have co^que^^^
the land / and began to war upon Albanak / slow hy^ in battle. When
Albanak was deed / the people of ye lord fled unto Lotryn and told him
because he was king of Brytayne how yt his brother was slain / and prayed him
of his help and socour for to avenge his broders death. Lotryn tha^ anon let
assemble all the Brytons of Kent / of Dover unto derewent / of Norfolk and
Suffolk / of Keft fen and Lyndessey. And when they were assembled / they sped
them fast toward their enemies for to give them battle And Lotryn had sent
to Cambar his brother yt he should come unto him with all ye power that he might
make / for to help him to avenge his broders death. And so he did with a good
will. When they came togider they took their way pryuely for to go seek king
Humbar where they might find him. And so it befell that this king Humbar was
beside a water that was a great river with his folk for to dysporte him. And
there came Lotryn and Cambar his brother with all their folk suddenly or that
any of their enemies wist. And when Humbar saw them come / he was sore adrad /
for as much as his men wist (...) not before / and also they were unarmed. And
anon Humbar for dread (...) in to the water and drowned himself / and so he
dyed / and his men were all flayne in so much that there escaped not one away
on live. And therefore is that water called Humbar / and evermore shall be as
long as the world stands / for because that this king Humbar was drowned
therein. And after that Locryn went to his ships and took there gold and
silver as much as he found unto himself / and all that other pylfre be gave
unto other folk of his host. And they found in one of the ships a fair
damoyfell which was king Humbars daughter / and she was called Estrylde. And
when king Lotryn saw her / he took her with him because of the great beauty
and fayrnes that he saw in her And for her he was overtaken in love / and
would have wedded her. These tidings came to Corin: and anon thought to
avenge him on Lotryn / for as much as Lotryn had promised him to wedde
Guentolyn his daughter. And Corin in haste took his way to new Troy unto him
/ and said thus to Lotryn. Certes ye reward me full evil for ye pains that I
have had for your fader Brute / where fore sith it is so I will avenge me now on
the. And with yt drew his sword and would have slain Lotryn ye king. But the
damoysel went between them / and made them to be accorded in this manner that
Lotryn should take Guentolyn Corins daughter to wife. And so Lotryn did.
Nevertheless after he was married he went pryuely to Estrylde and gate on her a
daughter that was called Abram And it befell so yt anon after Corin dyed and
after when he was deed / Lotryn forsook Guentolyn that was his wife / and made
Es(...) queen. And than Guentolyn dep(...) from the^s (...) great wrath in to
Cori(...)e / and there seized all the land in to her own ha^ors / for as
much as she was her faders heir / and took homage of all y^ men of y^ land.
And afterward she assembled a great host and a mighty of men for to be
avenged upon Lottyn y^ was her lord / and gave him a strong but a isle / where
Lotryn her husbonde was slain / and his men disco^fyted in the.v. year of his
regne. Gue^tolyn let take Estrylde and Abram her daughter / and bound them
both hands and fete and cast them both in to a water / and so they were
dro^^^ed / wherefore y^ water was evermore after called Abram / after y^ name of
y^ damoysell y^ was Est^yldes daughter / and english men call that water
Seuerine / and walshmen call it Abram yet un to this day. And when this was
done Gu(...)ol in let crown her queen of all y^ land. And she governed the
land well and wisely unto th^ty me that (...) her sone that Lotryn had gotten
(...) was.xx. year of age / that he might be king. And so the queen reg^^d.xv.
year And than let she crown her sone king / and he reigned and governed the
(...) well and worthtly. And his mother went in to Cornewayle / and there she
dwelled all the days of her life.

How Madan reg^ed in peace all his life.
THis Madan sone to Lotryn reigned on the Brytons.xl. year / the which began to
regne the.xv. year of Saul. And this Madan lived in peace all his days / and
gate two sons / Mempris and Maulyn. Than he dyed / and lies at new Troy.

Of king Leyr sone to Bladud / and of the answer of his youngest daughter /
that gracyously was married unto the king of france.
AFter king Bladud reigned Leyr his sone / and this Leyr made y^ town of
Leycestre / and he let call y^ town after his name / and he governed y^ town
well and nobly. This king Leyr had three daughters / y^ first was called
Gonorill / the second Rigan / and y^ third Cordeill / and the youngest
daughter was fairest and best of co^dicyons. The king their fader became an
old man / and would yt his daughters were married or y^ he dyed / but first he
thought to assay which of them loved him most and best / for she y^ loved him
best should best be married. And he axed of y^ first daughter how well she loved
hy^. And she answered and said / better than her own life. Now certes said her
fader / y^ is a great love. Tha^ he axed the second daughter / how much she
loved him. And she said more and passing all y^ creatures of y^ world. Per ma
foy said her fader / I may no more axe. And than he axed of y^ third daughter
how much she loved him. Certes fader said she / my systers have told you
glosyng words / but I shall tell you troth / for I love you as I ought to
love my fader And for to bring you more in certain how I love you I shall you
tell / as much as ye be worth / so much shall ye be loved. The king her fader
wend y^ she had scorned him / and became wonders wroth / and swear by heaven
and earth she should never have good of him / but his daughters y^ loved him so
much should be well auau^ced and married. And y^ first daughter he married to
Maugles king of Scotlonde / and the second he married to Hauemos earl of
Cornewayle / and so they ordained and spoke between them y^ they should depart
y^ realm between them two after y^ death of king Leyr their fader / so y^
Cordeill his youngest daughter should no thing have of his land. But this
Cordeill was wonders fair and of good co^dicyons and manners / that y^ king of
france Aga^pe herd of her fame / and sent to king Leyr her fader for to have
her unto his wife / and prayed him thereof. And king Leyr her fader sent him
word y^ he had departed his land and given all to his two daughters before
said / and said he had no more land wherewith her to mary. And when Agampe y^
king of france herd this answer / he sent anon again to Leyr and said y^
he asked no thing with her but only her clothinge and her body. And anon king
Leyr sent her over y^ see to y^ king of france. And he received her with much
worship / and with solempnite he spoused her / and made her queen of france.

How king Leyr was driven out of his land through his folk. And how Cordeill
his youngest daughter helped him at his need.
THus it befell afterward y^ these two eldest daughters would not abide till
Leyr their fader was deed / but warred upon him whiles that he was on live /
and did him much sorrow and shame / wherefore they took from him all ye realm /
and between them had ordained yt one of them should have king Leyr to soiourne
all his life time with.lx. knights and squyers / yt he might worshypfully go and
ride wheder yt he would / and in to what country yt him lyked to play and to
solace. So yt Maugles king of Scotlond had king Leyr with him in ye manner as is
above said / and or a year was passed Gonoril yt was his eldest daughter and
queen of Scotlond was so anoyed of him and of his people / yt anon she and her
lord spoke together / wherefore half his knights and his squyers went from him
/ and no more were left with him but.xxx. And when this was done Leyr began for
to make much sorrow for because that his estate was empayred / and men had of
him more scorn and despyte than ever they had before / wherefore he wist not
what to do. And at y^ last thought y^ he would go in to Corn wayle to Rigan his
other daughter. And wha^ he was come y^ earl and his wife that was Leyrs
daughter welcomed him / and with him made much joy / and there he dwelled
with.xxx. knights and squyers. And he had not scarsly dwelled there a year but
yt his daughter of him and of his company was weary / and her lord and she of
him had great scorn and despyte / so that from.xxx. knights they brought
unto.x. and afterward had he but.v. and so they left him no moo. Than made he
great sorrow / and said sore weeping. Alas that ever I came in to this land and
said yet had it ben better to have dwelled with my first daughter. And anon he
went thens to his first daughter again / but anon as she saw him come she
swear by god and by his holy name / and by as much as she might that he should
have no more with him but one knight if he would there abide. Than began Leyr
again to weep and made much sorrow and said Alas now to long have I lived yt
this sorrow and myschefe is to me now fallen. For now am I poor yt sometime was
rich / but now have I no friend ne kyn that to me will do any good. But wha^ I
was rich all me^ me honored and worshypped / and now every man has of me
scorn and despite / and now I wot well that Cordeil my yo^gest daughter said
troth wha^ she said / as much as I had so much should I be loved / and all
y^ while yt I had good / so long was I loved and honored for my richesse /
but my two daughters glosed me tho / and now of me they set little price / and
sothe told me Cordeil but I would not believe it ne under stand and therefore I
let her go fro me as a thing that I set little price of / and now wot I not
what to do sith my two daughters have me thus deceived yt I so much loved /
and now must I needs seek her yt is in an other land yt lightly I let go ^^o
me without any reward or gifts and s^e said that she loved me as much as she
ought to love her fader by all manner of reason / and tha^ I should have a^^d
her no more / and those yt me other wise beb^ght through their falls speech now
have me deceived. In this manner Leyr (...) time began to make his mo^e. And at
the last he shope him to ye see / and passed over into france / and asked and
espied where the queen might be found. And men told him where she was. And

When that king Leyr was deed Cordeill his youngest daughter reigned y^.x. year
of Ozias king of the Iewry. And after her reigned Conedag / the.xv. year of
Ozias. And Cordeill that was Leyrs youngest daughter after the death of her fader
had al y^ land five year / and in the mean time dyed her lord Agampe y^ was
king of france. And after his death there came Morgan and Conedag that were
Cordeyls systers sons and to her had enemite for as much as their aunt had y^
land / so y^ between them they ordained a great power / and strongly warred on
her / and never rested till they had taken her and put her to death And than
Morgan and Conedag seized all the land and departed it between them / and they
held it.xij. year / and when y^.xij. year were gone there began between them a
great debate / so y^ they warred strongly together / and did to each other much
disease / for Morgan would have all y^ land fro beyond Humber y^ Conedag
held. But he came against him with a strong power: so y^ Morgan durst not abide
but fled away in to Wales / and Conedag pursued him / and took him and slew
him. And than Conedag came and seized all the land in to his hands and held
it / and reigned after.xxxiij. year / and than he dyed / and lies at new Troy.

And because y^ matter co^teyneth most co^modiously together of y^ kings of
Britayn now called England / for y^ time of them is not certainly known what
time of y^ world these kings following reigned / therefore they shall be
together till it be comen unto Euentolyn king of Brytayne now called England.

How Reynolde that was Conedags sone reigned after his fader / and in his time
it rayned blood three days / in tokenynge of great death.
AFter this Conedag reigned Reynold his sone y^ was a wise and an hardy knight
and curteys / y^ well and nobly ruled y^ land / and was well beloved of all
folk. And in his time it rayned blood y^ lasted three days as god would / and
soon after there came a great death of people / for hoostes without no^bre of
people fought till y^ god thereof took pite / and than it cesed And this
Reynolde reigned.xxij. year / and than dyed / and lies at York.

How Gorbodian reigned in peace that was Reynoldes sone.
AFter this Reynolde reigned Gorbodian his sone.xv. year / and than dyed / and
lies at York.

How Gorbodian had.ij. sons / and how the one slew y^ other for to have y^
land / and how ydoyne their mother slew y^ other wherefore the land was
destroyed.
When this Gorbodian was deed his two sons y^ he had became stout and proud
/ and ever warred together for the land / and y^ one was called Ferres and y^
other Porres. And this Ferres would have all y^ land / but that other would not
suffer him. This Ferres had a felonous heart: and thought through treason to
slay his brother / but pryuely he went in to france / and there abode with the
king Syward / till upon a time when he came again to fight with his brother
Ferres but full evil it happed him / for he was slain first. When ydoyne their
mother wist that Porres was deed she made great sorrow / for because y^ she
loved hy^ more than y^ other / and thought for to slay him pryuely. And pryuely
she came to her sone upon a night with two knyues and therwt cut his throat / and
y^ body also in to small pieces. Who herd ever of such a mother / y^ slew with
her own hands her own sone. And long time after lasted y^ reprefe and shame
to y^ mother / that for because of that one sone / she murdered that other / and
so lost them both.

How four kings curteysly held all Brytayne / and what be their names ye
shall here after.


When the two brethern were deed they ne had left behind them neither sone ne
daughter ne none other of the kynrede yt might enheryte y^ land And for as
much as the strongest men drove and discomfyted the feblest and took all their
lands / so yt in every country they had great war and strife under them But
among all other things there were four in the country that overcame all y^
other / and through their might and strength they took all the lands / and
every of them took a certain country / and in his country let call him king
/ and one of them was called Scater / and he was called king of Scotlonde /
and that other was called Da walier / and he was king of Logres / and of all
the land that was Lotryns yt was Brutes sone. The third was called Ru dac /
and he was king of Wales. And the fourth was called Cloten / and he was king
of Cornewayle. But this Cloten should have had all the land by right / because
there was no man y^ wist none so right heir as he was. But they that were
strongest set little by them y^ were of less estate / and therefore this Clote^
had no more land among them but Cornewayle.

Of king Donebant that was Clotens sone / and how he wanne the land.
THis Cloten had a sone that was called Doneba^t / y^ after the death of his
fader became an hardy man and a fair and a curteys / so y^ he passed all the
other ky^ges of fayrnes and of worthynes. And anon as he was knight he wist
well that when his fader lived he was most ryghtfull heir of all y^ land /
and should have had it by right / but y^ other kings y^ were of much more
strength than he took from him y^ land. Wherefore this Donebant ordained him a
great power / and conquered first the land of Logres / and after he went to
conquer all the land of Scotlonde and Wales. And Scater came with his men and
gave him battle / and Rudac came also with his walshe men for to help hy^ / but
so it befell y^ Rudac was slain and Scater also in plain battle. And so
Doneba^t had y^ vyctory and conquered all the land / and well mayntayned it in
peace and in quyete / that never before it was so well mayntayned.

How Doneba^t was the first king y^ ever bare crown of gold in Brytayne.
THis Donebant let make him a crown of gold / and ware ye crown upon his heed
as never king did before and he ordained a statute / yt yfa man had done never
so much harm and might come in to the Temple / there should no man him mysdo
/ but go there in safete and in peace / and after go in to what land or
country that him pleased / without any harm / and if any man had set any
hand upon him / he than should lose his life. And this Donebant made y^ town
of Malmesbury / and y^ town also of y^ vise And wha^ he had reigned well and
worthily.xl. year he dyed and lies at new Troy.

How Brenne and Belyn departed between them the land after the death of
Donebant their fader. And of the war between them.
ANd after y^ this Donebant was deed his sons departed y^ land between them
as their fader had ordained / so y^ Belyn his eldest sone had all y^ land of
Brytayn from Humbar southwarde / and his brother Brenne had all the land from
Humbar to Scotlonde. But for as much as Belin had y^ better part Brenne
therefore waxed wroth and would have had more of the land: and Belyn his brother
would grant hy^ no more / wherefore strife and war arose between them two.
But Brenne y^ yo^ger brother had no might ne strength against Belyn / and
therefore Brenne through counsel of his folk went fro thens in to Norwey to
y^ king Olsynges / and prayed him of help and so^our for to conquer all y^
land upon Belyn his brother / upon y^ covenant yt he would have his daughter
to wife. And king Olsynges hy^ granted. And Belin anon as his brother was gone
to Norwey he seized in to his hands all y^ land of Northumberlond / and took
all y^ castles and let them be arrayed / and kept y^ coostes of the sea y^
Brenne should not arryue on no side but y^ he were taken. King Olsynges let
assemble a great host / and delivered his daughter to Bre^ne and all y^ people
that he had ordained. This damoysell Samye had long time loved a king y^ was
called Gutlagh / and to him she told all her counsel / and how y^ Brenne
should have her and led her with him for evermore / and so he should lose her
but that she might forsake Brenne. And wha^ Gutlagh had herd these tidings /
he lay for to espy Brenne with as many ships as he might make and have. So
the two fletes met together / and long time they fought / so that Brenne and
his men were dyscomfyted. And king Gutlagh took Samye and put her in to his
ship. And Brenne shamefully fled thens as a man discomfyted. And this king
Gutlagh would have gone in to his own tou^^tre but there came upon hy^ so
great a (...)st that lasted.v. days / so y^ through y^ (...) pest he was
driven in to Brytayn with three ships and no moo. And tho y^ kept the coostes
of y^ see took Gutlagh and Samye and all his folk / and them presented to
Belyn. And Belyn put them in prison.

How Belyn let depart out of his land king Gutlagh of Denmark and Samye.
(...) I was not long after y^ Brenne came again with a great navy and sent
to his brother Belyn that he should yield again his land to his wife and his
folk / and his castles also / or else be word destroy his land. Belyn drad
noth^ge his malice / and would no thing do (...) that he had said. Wherefore
Brenne came with his folk and fought with B(...) and Brenne was discomfyted and
his folk slain / and himself fled with. (...). men in to france. And this
Belyn that was Brennes brother went than to York / and took counsel what he
might do with king Gutlagh / for king Gutlagh proffered to become his man / and
to hold his land of him / yeldynge yearly a thousand pound of silver for
evermore / and for sykernes of this covenant to be hol den / Gutlagh should
bring him good hostages / and to him should do homage and all his folk / and
yet he should swear upon a book y^ it should never be broken ne failed. Belyn
tho by counsel of his folk granted him his askyng / and so Gutlagh became
his man. And Belyn took of hy^ his homage by an oath / and by writing the same
couenauntes. And upon these couenau^tes king Guthlagh took Samie and his folk
and went thens and returned again to Denmark. Evermore after were the
couenau^tes holden and y^ truage paid / till the time that Hon^lus was king of
Denmark and also of this land through his wife Gildeburgh y^ he had spoused /
for she was right heir of this land. This Belyn dwelled tho in peace and
worshypfully him held among his barons. And he made four ryall ways one
from y^ eest unto y^ west / and that was called watlyng street / and an other
from y^ north unto the south / and that was called Ikelme street / and two
other ways he made in bossyng through out y^ land / y^ one is called Fosse /
and that other Fosse dyke. And he maynteyned well y^ good laws y^ Doneba^t his
fader had made and ordained in his time / as before is said.

How accordme^t was made between Brenne and Belyn through Cornewen that was
their mother.
BRenne that was Belyns brother had long time dwelled in france and there had
conquered a great lordshyp through marriage. For he was duke of Burgoyne through
y^ daughter of duke Fewyn y^ he had spoused / which was right heir of y^
land. And this Brenne ordained a great power of his folk and also of france
/ and came in to this land for to fight with Belyn his brother. And Belyn came
against him with a great power of brytons / and would have given him battle. But
wha^ their mother Cornewen that tha^ lived had herd that y^ one brother would
have destroyed that other / she went between her sons / and made them accord
with much pain. So y^ at the last the two brethren with much bliss went
together in to new Troy / y^ now is called London / where they dwelled a year /
and after they took their counseyle for to go and co^quere all france / and so
they did / and brent towns and destroyed the land in length and bread / and
the king of france gave them battle with his power / but he was over comen /
and gave truage to Belyn and to his brother. And after y^ they went forth unto
Rome / and conquered it and all Lombardy and Germany / and took homage of all
the chief lords and barons. And after they came in to this land of Brytayn /
and dwelled with their bryto^s in joy and rest. And than made Brenne y^ town
of Brystow and after he went over to his own lord ship / and there dwelled he
all his life. And Belyn dwelled at new Troy / and there he made a fair gate
that is called Belynges gate after his own name. And when this Belyn had
reigned nobly. x^. year he dyed / and lies at new Troy.

How king Cormbatrus slew the king of Denmark / for because that he would
not pay to him his truage.


ANd after this Belyn reigned his sone Cormbatrus a good man and a worthy. And
the king of Denmark would not pay to him his truage / y^ is to say / a. M.
pound as he had sworn by oath for to pay it / and also by writing record to
Belyn his fader / wherefore he was euylapayed and wroth / and assembled a great
host of brytons and went in to Denmark / and slew y^ king Gutlagh / and
brought y^ land in subieccyo^ all new / and took of y^ folk feaute and
homage / and after went again in to his own land / and as he came forth by
Orkeney he found. xxx ships full of men and women beside the coost of y^ see
/ and y^ king asked what they were. And an earl that was master of them all
curteysly answered to y^ king and said yt they were exiled out of spain / and
so yt they had trauayled half a year and more in the sea / to wit if they
might find any king in any land y^ of them would have pite or mercy to give
them any land in any country / wherein they might dwell and have rest / and
become his lyege men / and to him would do homage and feaute while they lived
and to his heirs after him / and of hy^ and of his heirs hold that land.
And when y^ king herd this he had pite on them / and gave them an isle all
wyldernes / where no man was dwelling / save only wild beestes. And y^ earl
thanked much y^ king and became his man / and did him homage and feaute / and
took all his folk and went in to the same isle And y^ earl was called Irlamal /
and therefore he let call y^ land Irlonde after his name. This king Cormbatrus
came again in to his land and reigned.xxv. year / and after dyed / and lies at
new Troy.

Tulius the.vj. king of Rome was of a bond condycyon on the moders side / for
she was a captyue maiden / but she was of the noble blood This man had great
loving / and nobly he bare him in every place. Three hills to ye cite he put /
and dyched ye walls round about. Regusar Sabusardach and Balthazar were
brethren / the which reigned one after an other and were kings in Babylon.
And Balthazar was the last king of Babylon / ye which was slain of Darius and
Cyrus. Vide pl'a Dani.v.

Incipit Monarchia Persarum.
Darius uncle to Cyro fellow in ye kingdom with Cyro / occupied the kingdom of
Babylon. Darius translated the kingdom of Babylons Caldees in to ye kingdom of
Persaru^ and Medoru^. Cyrus was emperor.xxx. year. This Cyrus held ye monarchy
hole at Perses Of this man prophesied ysaias / and he destroyed Babylon / and
flewe Balthazar king of Babylon / and he worshipped greatly Daniel. The Jews he
sent home again that they should build ye temple of god. Vt pz Esore.j.
Babylon ye strong castle was destroyed and his power was taken fro him / as
it was proph^^ped. This was ye first cite and the gretest of all the world /
of yt which incredyble things are wryte^ / and this yt was so strong in one
night was destroyed / that it might be showed to ye power of god / to yt which
power all other ben but a sperke and dust. For it is said for soth yt it was
incredible to be made with man's hand / or to be destroyed with man's strength /
whereof all ye world might take an ensample / and it would or might be
informed. Tarquinus superbus was the.vij. king of Rome and he reigned xxxv.
year. This man found first all these turmentes which are ordained for
malefactors: as er^e p^son wells and galowes / fetters and many^^es chains
and collers and such other. And for his great pride and cruelnesse god suffered
hy^ to myscheue / and in what manner wise it shall be showed. He had a sone of ye
same name / yt which sone defouled a worthy man's wife / they called hy^
Co^^aryn and his wife was called Lucres. This Tarquinus yt was this seventh
kings sone aforesaid came to this ladies house (absent her husbo^de) to souper
and to lodging. And when all were a sleep he rose with a sword in his hand
and with strength and ^^re he rauisshed ye woman. And wha^ he was gone she sent
unto her fader and her husbo^de / for she was of great kynne / and thus she
said to them. The kings sone came hither as a friend / of whom I had no
mistrust / and thus he has defiled my ^hastite / and lost my name for
evermore. Wha^ her friends saw her weep and pyteously complain / they
comforted her as well as they could / and said it was no vylany unto her / for
it was against her will. She answered and said. Yet shall there never woman
excuse herby Lucres: for though she consented not to this deed / yet shall she
not dye without pain for yt deed. And with that word she had a knyfe ready under
her mantell / with which she smote her self to the heart. And for this
cruelnes and this pyteous death the people of Rome arose and exiled this king
and all his progeny for evermore. And thus ceased these kings of Rome / and
never was none after.

Of the governance of Rome till the Emperors began.
AFter wha^ this tyrau^t was deed the Romans ordained yt there should never be
king more in Rome. But they would be governed fro thens forth by consules. So
wha^ those kings had reigned.CC. year and.xl. they made this statute / that two
consules should be chosen / and they should govern the Cite and the people /
and for this cause these two were chosen / that if one of them would make any
excess / yt other should govern him For there was no thing obeyed but if
they consented both. Also they should not stand in their dignite passing one
year for this cause. That for dominacyon of long time they should not usurp
more upon them than was ryghtfull. In all this time y^ Empire of Rome was not
dilated passing.xij. mile / ne had no lord ship passing.xij. mile. The first
co^sules that were made y^ one was called Luciu^ and that other Brutu^ / and
these two men did great things in their time. But yet y^ people bare heavy of
their dominacyon / wherefore they chase an other man / which should have more
auctorite tha^ they and they called him Dictator. In this same time there was a
great discencyo^ between the people and the senate / wherefore they chase
Tribunas which were Judges over y^ people / and defended them from wrong / as
says ysyder. For the Dictator when he was chosen he lasted five year / and y^
Tribunas were remeued every year. But ye must understand that ye shall not have
here after all y^ consules names y^ governed Rome betwixt the seasyng of y^
kings and y^ begynynge of the emperors / for it were to long to write /
specially wha^ they were every year new / sith that one man might be chosen so
often times as we read. And also for y^ enduring of their governance For they
were governors of Rome.v.C. year and.lxvij. So the most famous men of these
shall be rehearsed after the form of Chronicles / and as they stand in the book
each one after other.

Cleopatra reigned in egypt.xxxv. year. This king yet a child noble Anthiocus
greatly oppressed with many deceytes. But y^ Romans sent legates y^ which
commanded Anthiocus y^ he should cesse of his tyranny against him. And Marcus
Publius made a cercle about Anthiocus saying thus. The senators of rome and
y^ people command y^ that y^ go not out of this cercle till y^ have answered
to this matter. This Anthiocus seeing y^ he might not continue his tyranny said.
If it be thus commanded me of the senators and Romans / I must needs turn
again and so wood angry he was y^ he lost y^ syege of Alexa^dre / and turned to
y^ poor releues of the Jews / ve^gyng hy^ on them because he might not venge
him on no myghtyer people. Vt pz. in lib. macha.j. et.ij.

/ and from his youth until his age was ever of good conuersacyon / evermore
virtuous. And at the last he was slain of his brother Elay. Vt pz.i. macha.
Ioha^nes Hyrcanus sone to Simon was after his fa der.xxix. year / a noble man
as all ye kynrede was before him. This man after his decesse left his wife a
very wise woman and his five sons to govern the Iewry / of whom the eldest
was called Aristobolus an impatient man and an unhappy. His own mother with
three of his yo^ger brethern he prysoned / and slew them through honger / and
so alone he lived king and bishop one year. Vide p^a libro machabeorum.
Publius Lucinius Lucius Emilius / Lucius Lucinius / and Lucius Censorinus were
consulles at Rome / in whose time the Cartagyens and the Romans warred
strongly together / but the Romans subdued them / intendyng to have destroyed
the Cartagyens utterly. But among ye Romans there was a notable wise man
called Scipio Nauta / and among many notable cou^seyles / two he gave
specially to be had in my^de. The first that Cartago should not be destroyed /
that through ye occasyon of forehande batayles / an inward concord and peace
should abide among the Romans / and a perpetual strength for contynuall
exercise of battle. The second / that in no wise the teathur should be
buyided in Rome / for he said that was the most enemy that might be unto the
people which used war / for that place nourysshed sloth and provoked
lechery. And how wisely this notable man gave cosiseyle / the times following
declare. Vide p^a in Au gu. deciui. dei. et Oro. lib.iiij. Yet for all this
counsel the noble cite of Cartagye was destroyed of Scipio and ye senators
And it brent.xvii. days co^tynually / many men there were sold / and many men
ran in to ye fire wylfully. Corinthus this same year was destroyed of the To
mayns / which was the rychest country of the world. Ptholomeus this time
reigned in Egypt / and was famylyer with the Romans. And so long he and his
pre decessours reigned as they kept fidelite to the Romans. And know every
man that there was none other cause that ye power of ye Romans increased so
strong ly above other people / but virtue yt which habou^dau^tly reigned in
them / and namely ryghtwysnes / yt which above all thing they used. And as
long as they kept mesurenes and loved ryghtwysnes so long they were never
ouercomen / and as soon as they were corrupted / it is read they were
ouercome^. It is had in a certain reuelacyon of god showed to saint Brigit /
that our lord god bears wytnes to these old Romay^s / ye none in this world
of pure natural reason lived more ryghtwysly. And what lyghtes of faith they
showed in ye time of christen religyon shall be showed afterward.

ARistobolus was the first king and priest in the Iewry. This man reigned one
year alone / and took to him the dyademe of ye kingdom. And he held hy^ not
content with that ye his fader gave him in his testament. But he put his mother
in prison and his brethren / and therefore he perysshed wretchedly with his
brother Antigonus / the which was of his counsel and helped him. Vide magr^m
in historiis. Antigonus brother to ye king was slain through ye envy of ye
queen. Alexander was bishop after Airstovolus / and he stood.xxvii. year / and
he was a tyrau^t / all though he appeared sobre in the begy^nynge. But he made
it known what he was in his stomach. For he slew his own brethren / and
in.xii. year he slew.l. M. of the old sage faders of great virtue / because
they cold hy^ his mysguydynge. Than wha^ he should dre he left two sons
behind him / ^i^^anu^ and Aristobolu^. But certainly he said his wife should
regne / for she stood in ye grace of ye people. Seruius Flaccus / Lucius Celius
/ Fabius Publius / this time were senators at Rome. This time batayles among
themself began Of the which ye first cause and the begin nynge was Gracius a
mighty man and well known with noble Romans began to seek a cause against
them. And because yt he might do no thing alone to them / he meued the common
people to them saying / that all ye lands and possessions should be divided
equally / and also ye money. and ^. And for yt cause there was an insurreccyon
/ in yt which Gracius was slain / and many nuscheues fell after. Vide
Orostu^. In the time of these men there was a child borne at Rome
having.iiij. feet.iiij. arms. i^. faces and iiij. eyes. The hill of Ethna
spytted out flamynge fire horrybly / and destroyed the places nigh about it. And
these me^ verynge rule Cartago was commanded to be restored / and it was
fulfilled of ye To main people. And there was mighty battle in ye cite of
Rome. Fab^us with a little host overcame the king of ^rmenye / and there were
drowned an hon dred and.lxxx. Nus. men in the water of Reme. P^holomeus
Alexander was king in Egypt. In his time was borne Luretius a poet / yt which
afterward was mad for love of women and slew himself. Ptholomeus some to
Cleopatre reigned after him / under whom Salustius the noble writer of
hystoryes was borne. Ptholomeus Dionysius was after this man. And in his time
Virgyli and Dracius were borne.

Jacob natural fader to Joseph of the line of Christ is rehearsed in Luke and
Mathewe / and little of him is had in scripture. Alexandra wife to Alexa^ der
was bishop in the Jury.ix. year / and she did much tyranny / all if she was
made bysihop by her feyned holy relygyon. And Nircanu^ her sone promoted to the
bysshopryche / and she ordained yt he should regne after her. This woman in the
line of ye by sshops is put for ye con^ tynge of ye years. Not that she used ye
office of a vysshop / for it was not lefull to her. Hircanus sone to Alexander
reigned xxxiij. year. This Hircanus after the de cesse of his mother succeeded in
the kingdom / in yt which he had little prosperity for parcialite of the
people. For anon he was ouercomen / and afterward he was restored through the
help of ye Arabees And than he was made tributary to the Romans / and so he
was in peace a little time / but not in ye name of king. At the last he dyed
wretchedly / for he was begiled through ye fraud of Parthorum / the which
Antigonus hired against him. Vide plene magr^m histo. The heresy of the
pharisees about this time began and among them were.iij. sects in ye Iu ry /
Pharisei / Saducei / and Essei / all these were divided fro the common use of
the Jews / and were infecte with many errors for they said yt they were holyer
than other men / for they lived straytlyer tha^ other men did. Vide plus alias.
Virgyll the most famous and excellent of poets was magnifyed this time / and
mernaylous things he did / and among other when than Neopolis was vexed with
deedly pain of mighty worms Virgyl cast a worm of gold in to a pond or a
water / and it lay there a cetayn season. And when it was taken up in to the
town / all ye cite was made full of worms / and till the worm of gold was
put in to the water again / they had infynyte worms / and when it was in ye
water all the worms went away. Also it is written in the chronicles of Rome / ye
Virgyll by co^nynge co^densed or thycked the air / so yt he walled his gardyn
with the air / and he made a bridge of the air by the which he might pass
every time that he list. Also he asked Marcellu^ Neopolitanu^ neue we unto ye
emperor if he would have a bird taught to kill all birds / or a fly taught
to drive all flies out of the cite. And this Marcellu^ told this to the
emperor. And he desired to teache a fly to kill all flies / for the common
people were sore anoyed with flies And many other meruayles he did. Vide magr^m
Rodulfum Cestern^. Dracius Flaccus / and Salustius Crispus historicus were this
time. Quintus Cipio / Gaius Lucius this time were consules at Rome. Pompeius /
Marcus Crassus / and Julius Caesar this time were Dictatours at Rome. For as it
is said before there were many dignytees at Rome / of the which some dured one
year / and some two year. And among all the dignytees the Dictatours exceded /
for it dured five year contynually. But when ye common people and the lordships
of Rome encreasyng were made.iij. Dicta tours. And this time were Pompeius
Julius / and Marcus crassus dictatours / and because Po^peius was of great
honor and aged / he abode at Rome to keep the common people of Rome. Marcus
Crassus was sent to subdue and fight with ye regyon of Perthus / and through
treason he was taken and slain. Julius Caesar was sent to ye west part of ye
world to subdue them. And he had with him. vi^. le gyons of people. And when he
had subdued Lombardye and France / his.v. year were spended yt which were
assygned to him and no longer. There by his own auctorite he took other.v.
year on him / in yt which he subdued Cassibalon king of Brytayn / and the
frenshmen that rebelled against him. This Julius after he had conquered these
countries unto Rome he rode again for to be received with certain worship as
co^querours were before him / but it was denied him / and also the enter of ye
cite / by instigacyon of a lord called Pompey. Wherefore this Iultus Caesar was
anoyed / and with force of might entered the cite / and robbed the common treasour
/ and led it with him / and departed it among the.v. legyons yt were his
servants. Than went he in to Spain to fight against this Pompey / for Pompey
had ye governance of Cartago. But after that journey in ytalye Pompey and he
encou^tred together / in which battle Pompey fled unto the king of Egypt. And
that same king for special love yt he had unto this Julius Caesar / smo^e of
Pompeys heed / and sent it to Julius Caesar. Yet for all ye enemyte yt was
betwixt these two / Julius wept when that he same this Pompeys heed. This
Julius was excedyng in wit before other men and he fought in battle.lij.
times. This man alone exceded Marcus Crassus / the which is said to have
foughten.xxxix. times. This man took first the empire of Rome upon him when
Pompey and other noble men of the Romans were clayne. And at ye last the fyfth
year of his empire this Julius Caesar ye ruler of all the world was slain in ye
counsel house through treason of his lords. Cathon the most named philosopher
leyng Iu lius caesar have ye victory / whom he favored not / at a town called
Vtica^ slew hymselselfe. Iuxta illud. Mauult Cato mori / qua^ deroget vrbis
honori. But for that (after Austyn) he was not excused of sin. This time ye
Jury was tributary to the Romans for parcialite of two brethren / Aristobolus
/ and Erranus both of them for envy of other kest them to ye Romans that they
might regne. This time three sons appeared i heaven toward the eest part of ye
world the which by little and little were brought in to one body. A great sign
it was that Africa / asia and Europa should be brought in to one monarchy / and
that ye lordshyp of Anthony the senator and Lucus Anton^^ should turn in to
one lordshyp. Marcus Cicero Tulius ye most excellent ^ethoricien was co^sul of
Rome this time.

How that the Britons granted unto Cassibalon that was Luddes brother ye land
/ in whose time Julius Caesar came twyes for to conquer Brytayne.
AFter ye death of king Lud reigned his brother Cassibalon and became a good man
and much beloved of his Bry tons / so that for his goodness and curteysy they
granted him the realm for ever more to him and to his heirs. And the king of
his goodness let nourysshe worthily both the sons yt were Luds his brother /
and after made the eldest sone earl of Cornewayle / and the youngest sone he
made earl of London. And whiles this Cassibalon reigned came Julius caesar yt was
emperor of Rome in to this ^o^de with a power of romans / and would have bad
this land through strength / but Cassybalon overcame him in battle through
help of y^ bryto^s / and drove him out of this land. And he went again to
Rome and assembled a great power an other time / and came again in to this
land for to give battle to Cassibalon / but he was disco^fyted through
strength of the brytons / and through help of y^ earl of Cornewayle and the
earl of London his brother / and through help of Gudyan king of scotlonde /
and Corbond king of north wales / and of Bretayll king of south wales. And in
this battle was slain Nemyon that was Cassybalons brother / wherefore he made
much sorrow And so went Julius Caesar out of this land with a few of Romans
y^ were left alive. And than Cassybalon went again to London / and made a
feast to all his folk y^ had helped him. And when that this feast was all done
/ than every man went home to his own country.

Of the debate that was between Cassybalon and the earl of London / and of the
truage that was paid to Rome.
ANd after it befell upon a day y^ the gentylmen of y^ ky^ges household / and
the gentylmen of y^ earls household of London after meet went together for to
play / and through debate that arose among them / Enelin that was y^ earls
cosyn of London slew Irenglas that was the kings cosyn / wherefore y^ king
swear y^ Enelyn should be hanged But the earl of London y^ was Enelyns lord
would not suffer him / wherefore y^ king was greatly vexed and worth to war death
earl / and thought to destroy him / and pryuely y^ earl sent lettres to Julius
Caesar / that he should come in to this land for to help him / and him avenge
upon y^ king / and he would help him with all his might. And when the emperor
herd these tidings / he was full glad / and ordained a strong power / and
came again the third time in to this land / and y^ earl of London help him
with.vij. M. men And at y^ third time was Cassybalon ouercomen and dyscomfyted
/ and made peace with the emperor for there thousand pound of silver yeldynge
by year for truage for this land for evermore. And than within half a year
after Julius Caesar the emperor went unto Rome / and the earl of London with
him. For he durst not abide in this land. And after Cassibalon reigned.xvij.
year in peace and than he dyed the.xvij. year of his regne / and lies at York.

How the lords of the land after the death of Cassybalon / and for because he
had none heir / made Andragen king.
AFter the death of Cassybalon for as much as he had none heir of his body
lefully begoten / the lords of the land by the comyns assent crowned Andragen
earl of Cornewayle / and made him king. And he reigned well and wor^ thely /
and he was a good man / and well governed the land. And when he had
reigned.viij. year than he dyed / and lies at London.

was expulsed / and Falelus was slain / and Herod was exiled. But when Herod

him king / sendyng with him an host / the w^^the took Jerusalem / and
Antigonu^ the bishop was taken and led to Anthony y^ senator / the which

Octauian neuewe to July when he was a youge man took the empire (...) him. His
floury sshynge youth he spended in war. Five. M. batayles he did And shortly
after many batayles ^^^he world he brought in to one monarchy. This man had no
fellow / and in his days peace was in all the world through the prouisyon of
the very god / that y^ tempo rall peace might gloryfye the Natiuite of our

in wit / the most fortunate in all things / and he lacked nor the vice of
his fleshly lust. This man made all y^ world to be mesured. And in the.lij.
year of his regne was borne the savior of all the world Christ Jesus / the
which grasifeth eternal peace to his lovers. Her no ^a sedz Ieronymsi. that
Anna and Emeria were systers and of Emeria was borne Elizabeth ^^der to John

about this time increased myghtely. And when it was so that by all y^ world in

sessed and put them holy to y^ prince of Rome y^ openly it might be showed that
such an universal peace came never by labor of battle / but of y^ power of y^
very god / that in his natyuite peace should regne in the world. Herod
Ascolonita was king in the Jury.xxxvij. year. This Perede ydumeus was the first
strange king that reigned on y^ Jews. The master in hystoryes says he was a
noble man and faithful in the begy^uynge and in all thing he had him nobly.
He was very gentle unto the Romans and to y^ people that loved peace. And in
his old age when he would over much please y^ To mayns / and herd of y^ birth
of Christ dredyng to be expulsed of his kingdom as a stranger / wretchedly
fell and slew y^ Innocents and diverse of his own children. And at y^ last

Rome / and ran all the day. The golden image fell the which Romulus had made

When Herod dysposed him to slay y^ children of Israel / he was commanded by
the lettre of y^ emperor to come to rome to answer to y^ accusacyo^ of his
children Alexiu^ and Aristoboli. And there were.iij. Herodes greatly spoken of
for their ill d^ des. The first was called Ascolonita / and under this man was
Christ borne / and the children of Israel were slain. The second was called
Antipas / sone to y^ first Herod / under whom John baptist was heded / and
Christ suffered death. And the third was called Agrippa / sone to Aristoboli /
sone to y^ first Herod / y^ which slew James and prisoned Peter. The first
Herod wha^ he saw his sons Alexiu^ and Aristoboli through y^ pretense of his
lettre by the emperor sent / strove for y^ succes syon of his kingdom / he
disposed and made Antipater y^ was his first begote^ sone to be before them /
and when they were tal king of y^ death of their fader / he kest the^ away / and
they went to y^ emperor to compain of y^ wrong of their fader / and in y^
mean time y^ three kings of Coleyn came by Herod to Jerusalem / and when they
came not again by hy^ / he thought they were ashamed to come again by hy^ / for
because they were deceived / and that they found not y^ child as he demed /
therefore in y^ mean season he cessed to slay y^ children of Israel / and than
he went to Rome for y^ citacyon of the emperor / and he took his way by y^
cite of Tarsum / where he brent y^ ships in which the three kings of Coleyne
should have sailed in to their own countries. Than after a year and certain
days this Herod came fr^ Rome again accorded with his sons / and for the
confyrmacyon of his kingdom he was made much bolder / and tha^ he slew all
y^ children of Bethleem y^ were of two year of age and under / that had space
of one night of age / and among these was there one of his own children. And
Ari stobolus and Alexiu^ were had suspected / in so much as they promised a
harbor a great reward for to cut their faders throat when he did shave hy^.
And wha^ this Herod herd this / he was grieved and there he slew both his
sons. And Herod Agrippa his sone he ordained to be king. Wherefore Antipater
his eldest sone was about to poison his fader / the which Herod Agrippa
understood / and prisoned there his brother / the which y^ emperor herd / and
said y^ he had rather be an hog of Herodes than to be one of his sons / for
his hogs he spares / and his sons he sleeth. And when Herod was.lxx. year
of age / he was stryken with a great sekenes in his hands and in his feet and in
his members / y^ no leche might come to him for stynke / and so dyed. When
Antipater his sone y^ was in prison herd tell of this / he ioyed greatly / and
there for y^ cause he was slain. Than Archelaus and Herod strove for the
succession of y^ first Herod before y^ emperor. The emperor there through
counsel of y^ senators y^ half of y^ Jury and ydumea gave to Archelaus
under name of a tetrarche The other part he divided in to two. Galile he gave
to Herod Antipas / and Ituriam and Traconitide^ he gave to Philyp Herodes
brother. And y^ same year Christ came from Egypt. And Archelaus was accused
many times of the Jews / and was exiled in to Vienna^ in to France. And in y^
place were set.iiij. Tetrarches to y^ repreuynge of y^ unstableness of y^ Jews.
And that same year Octauian the emperor dyed.

Crux Christi.


Jesus Christ the lord of all lords at. xxxiij year of age and three months
dyed for his servants. Innius Rufus was bishop in the Jury about this time.
Valerius Gracius was after him xj. year. This man openly sold the bysshopryche
/ and he that gave most had it. And so there was many in a little while Poncius
Pylatus was judge and proctour in the Jury under y^ emperor. And under this
man saint John baptyst began to preche. And our lord Jesus Christ suffered death /
whom Pylate condemned to death wrongfully for dread of y^ emperor. Tyrus a
certain king gate a ^hysde on Pyla a poor man's daughter named Atus / and
this child of his med^rs name and his belsyre put together was called Pylatus.
This Pylatus the.iiij. year of his age was sent to his fader y^ which king on
his wise lefully had gotten a child even of the age of Pylate. And because this
lefull gotten child as they proceeded in age exceded this bastard Pylatus / he
was full of envy / and slew his brother the lefull gotten child. Wherefore his
fader forth with sent him to Rome for pledge for his tribute y^ he paid to rome
entendyng he would never redeem him In the which time the kings sone of
France was pledge for his trybute / the which exceded him in strength and
chyualry also he slew him. Therefore y^ Romans sent Pylate as a profitable man
for the common well to the isle of Ponto / to tame ye cursed people y^ which
slew every Judge that came to them. And he that cursed man governed that
unhappy people / what with thretenynge and with promise / and with law / and
with gifts / that none of them durst do contrary to his pleasure / wherefore he
was called Pylate of Ponto. Herod Antipa young in his co^uersacions / with
gifts and messengers drew him to him and made him prince of ye Jury under
him. And this time Pylate gadred much money / and Herod not knowing he went
to Rome that he might receive of the emperor that Herod had given him.
Wherefore Herod and Pylate were enemies together unto ye passion of our lord /
when y^ Pylate sent Jesus Christ unto Herod clothed in a white clothe than they
were made friends. Ouidius Naso in Ponto about this time dyed the fourth year
of his exile. Tiberius this time was emperor at Rome / and he reigned.xxiij.
year / and he lived in ye year that our lord Jesus Christ dyed / and somewhat
after. This man was in all his works greatly auysed / yt there should be
nothing suddenly done / wise in wars / studyous in books / fair of speech /
fresshe in wit / save he would oftentimes feyne himself to do things that
he would not were done of other. This emperor understood and trusted in Christ
/ and worshypped him for god. Some men say at ye last he was cruel against
the people / but it was a great reason of pity yt he was ever gracyous to his
subjects and poor men. And he had peace al his days / and all people that
said against christian folk / without any mercy he destroyed. And he exiled
Pylate for ever. Than he decessed and a worse succeeded him. After Eusebe it is
written / that our lord at.xxx. year of his age chose his.xij. apostles / the
which made our Creed / that is our believe / and they made it after the
resurreccyon of Christ and after the holy ghoost was sent unto them / when they
had chosen Mathia ye apostle / and each of them made a part / as it is showed
here after. And this Mathia was chosen between the day of ye Ascencyon and
whytsondaye / in the place of Judas scaryot ye traitor / of whom in an
hystorye is read thus. There was a certain man in Jerusalem that hight Ruben /
and after saint Jerome he was of the trybe of ysachar / and his wife hight
Ciborea / y^ which on a certain night wha^ he would lustely know his wife /
she dremed that she should here a child of myschefe / and that child should
be a traitor to his king and to all the people of that regyon. And when that
child was borne and called Judas / his fader and his mother abhorred as well to
slay their child / as to nourysshe a traitor to the king and all his people
/ therefore they put him in to a panyer or leep in to the sea. And he flowed to
the isle of Scaryoth / where the lady of that place had no children by her
husbonde / and she feyned her to be with child / but she failed And after a
little season the same lady and queen conceived a child of her husbonde And
when he was of age Judas many times angered him / and caused him to weep / the
which ye queen saw / and bette Judas many times / and after she knowleged
that Judas was not the kings sone nor hers / wherefore Judas slew y^ kings
sone / and he dradde the pain of the law / and fled with certain exiles to
Jerusalem. And when he came there / he gate him to Pylates court that was
judge. And because that one cursed man draws to another / therefore he drew
to Pylate / and stood gretely in his favor. And upon a certain day when
Pylate looked out of his palace in to an orcharde of a man's that was called
Ruben the which was very fader to Judas / Pylate desired to have apples / and
Judas went to gader apples and Ruben ran to Judas for to let hy^ because he
took his apples without any leave. And after yt they had chydden this Judas
smote his fader on the heed with a stone and slew him / and Judas fled away
secretly after y^ deed / but it was said y^ Ruben died suddenly. Tha^ Pilate
gave Judas all Rubens goods and his wife Ciborea yt was his mother. And he
delte not curteysly with her as a man should do with his wife / wherefore she wept
because she had put her sone in y^ see / and yt she was married against her
will. It was perreyued y^ Judas had slain his fader and wedded his own mother.
Than Ciborea his mother and wife styred hy^ to leave his sin which he did and
followed Christ / and he for gave him his sins / and made him his proctour and
apostle / and how false he was to Christ it needs not to rehearse. And ye same
year Mathewe was chosen / and the holy ghoost was sent unto them as is said
before. The apostles or they were sparpled in to all ye world / they gadered
them together in Jerusalem / and made the Credo our believe here following.

PEter a Jew ye first pope was a blyssed man and a glorious apostle of Christ.
He was heed of ye church after Ierom.xxxvij. year. And he held his
bysshopryche in y^ cest.v. year and said ma(...) made our lord / and alone
said y^ Patt(...)oster. Than after he came to Antioch^^m / and there he
abode.vij. year techynge y^ way of troth / and Symo^ Magus he co^fou^ded and
overcame. That season he preched to y^ people y^ were circu^cysed which were
in Ponto of Galati / Capadocia / Asia / Bithinia. Than herd he that Simon Magus
deluded y^ Romans through the love of y^ faith / he came to Rome in y^ fourth
year of Claudius the emperor / and there he preched the word of god / and
showed the falshede of Simon Magus / and turned many a man to y^ faith. Than he
sent his prechers by diverse prouynces / by whom christen religyon was myghtely
increased. He ordained the feast of lentyn afore^ester / and the aduent / and
the (...)yng days to be fasted of all christen people / in to the myrrour of
y^ first and second coming of our lord. Than when he had been pope at
Rome.xxv. year.vij. months and.viij. days he was slain of Nero. Eius p^a
opera vide act. ap^orum. Gaius this time was emperor at Rome / and reigned.iij.
year and.x. months. This Gaius was full vicyous in living / for two of his
own systers he mysused / and on one of them he gate a daughter / which child
he set betwyxt ye knees of Jupiter in the temple / and feyned afterward ye
Jupiter had gotten her / wherefore he did d^trye through ye country ye all men
should worship her as a goddess. This man also made an image like himself /
and sent it to one Patronie president at Ierusale under the Romans /
co^mau^dyng him that he should compel ye jews to do worship thereto. And for
these enormities and many other / our lord suffered him to be slain at Rome in
his own palace.

Of king Gynder that was Kymbalyns sone / that would not pay the truage to
Rome for the land yt Cassibalon had granted / and how he was slain of a
Romayne.
ANd after the death of this Kymbalyn reigned Gynder his sone a good man and a
worthy / and was of so high heart that he would not pay to Rome the trybute
that king Cassybalon had granted unto Julius Caesar / wherefore the emperor
that was than that was Claudius Caesar / was sore anoyed and grieved / and
ordained a great power of Romans / and came in to this land for to conquer
y^ trybute through might and strength / and for to have it on the king. But
this king Gynder and Armager his brother assembled and gadered a great host
together of Brito^s and gave battle to ye emperor Claudius / and slew of y^
Romans great plente. The emperor had afterward one y^ was called Hamon y^
saw their people were there fast slain / and pryuely cast away his own
arms / and took y^ arms of a deed bryton and armed him therewith and came in
to the battle to ye king / and thus he said. Sir be of a good heart for
gods love / for the Romans your enemies anon shall be slain and
disco^fyted. And the king gave no keep to his words / for because of ye arms
that he had upon him / and wend it had been a Bryton But the traitor ever held
him next the king / and pryuely under ye sholder of his arm he smote the
king / wherefore the king dyed and fell down to the earth. Wha^ Armager saw
his brother so deed he cast away his arms and took to him his broders arms /
and came in to the battle among ye brytons / and badde them hertely for to
fight and fast lay down the Romans. And for ye arms they wend it had been
king Gynder that before was slain yt they wist not. Than began the Brytons
fyersly to fight / and slew the Romans. So at ye last ye emperor for soke
the field and fled as fast as he might with his folk in to Wynchestre. And the false traitor Hamon yt had slain the king fast anon began to flee with all ye
haste that he might. And Armager ye kings brother pursued him full fyersly with
a fyers heart / and drove him unto a water and there he took him / and anon
smote of both hands and feet and heed / and hewed the body all to pieces / and
than let cast him in to the water / wherefore that water was called Hamons
haven. And afterward there was made a fair town that yet stands yt is
called Southamton. And afterward Armager went to Wynchester to seek Claudius ye
Emperor / and there took him. And Claudius ye emperor through counsel of
his Romans that were left alive made peace with Armager in this manner following /
that is to say / that Claudius should give unto Armager Gennen his daughter to
wife and that this land fro that time forward should be in ye emperors power
of Rome taking none other tribute but homage. And they were accorded. And upon
this covenant Claudius caesar sent to Rome for his daughter Gennen. And wha^
she was come^ Claudius gave her to Armager to wife. And Armager spoused her at
London with great solem^nite. And tha^ he was crowned king of Brytayne.

Of king Armager in whose time saint Peter preched in Antioche with other
apostles in diverse countries.
THis Armager reigned well and worthily and governed well ye lord And Claudius
caesar in remembrance of this accord / and for reverence and honor of his
daughter made in this land a fa^^e town and castle / and let call the town
after his name Claucestren / ye new is called Glocestre. And wha^ this was all
done ye emperor took his l^ue and went to Be^^^. And Armager gate a sone on
his wife yt was called Westmer. And while (...) Armager reigned saint Peter
preched in Antioche / and there he made a noble church / in ye which he sat
first in his chair / and there he dwelled.vij. year. And after he went to Rome
and was made pope till yt Nero ye emperor let martyr him And than preched
openly all y^ apostles in diverse lands the true faith. And when Armager had
reigned.xxiiij. year he dyed / and lies at London.

How king Westmer gave to Berynger an ylonde forlet / and there this Berynger
made the town of Berwyk.
ANd after this A(...)ager reigned his sone Westmer / that was a good man and a
worthy of body / and well governed the land. It befell so that tidings came
to him on a day that the king Roderyk of Gascoyne was come in to this land
with an huge host of people / and was dwelling in Stanesmore. And when king
Westmer herd those tidings / he let assemble an huge host of Brytons / and
came to king Roderyk and gave him battle. And king Westmer slew Roderik with
his own hands in plain battle. And when king Roderykes men saw that their
lord was slain / they yielded them all to king Westmer / and became his men
for evermore. And he gave them a country yt was forlet wherein they might dwell
/ and thither they went / and dwelled there all their life time / and.ix.C. men
there were of them / and no moo left at that battle. Their governor and
prince was called Beringer / and anon he began a town yt they might therein
dwell and have resort and let call ye town Berwyk upon Twede And there they
enhabyted and became rich. But they had no women among them / and the Brytons
would not give their daughters to ye strangers / wherefore they went over see
in to Irlonde / and brought with them women / and there they them spoused. But
the men could not understand their language ne speech of these women / and
therefore they spoke together as scotts. And afterward through chaungynge their
languages in all France they were than called scotts / and so should the
folk of that country be called for evermore.

How king Westmer let arere a stone in ye entering of Westmerlo^de there as he
slew Roderyk / and there he began first housynge.


ANd after this battle that is above said / when Roderyk was slain / king
Westmer in remembrance of his vyctory let arere there besides y^ way a great
stone on high / and yet it stands / and evermore shall stand / and he let
grave in the said stone lettres that thus said. The king Westmer of Brytayne
slew in this place Roderyk his enemy. And this Westmer was ye first that
builded house and town in Westmerlonde / and at that stone begins
Westmerlonde / that Westmer let call after his own name. And wha^ Westmer had
so done / he dwelled all his life time in that country of Westmerlonde / for he
loved that country above all other countrees. And when he had reigned.xxv. year
he dyed / and lies at Karleyll.

Of king Coyll that was king Westmers sone / that held his land in peace all
his life time.
COyll Westmers sone was crowned king after his fader / and he was a good man
and a worthy / and of good co^dityons / and well governed his land / and of
all men he had love and peace. And in his time was never contacke / debate / nor
war in Brytayne. And he reigned in peace all his life. And when he had
reigned.xi. year he dyed and lies at York.

Claudius was emperor at Rome next after Gayus / and he reigned xiiij. year
and.viij. days. This man came in to great Britayn now called England for to
challenge the trybute which they did deny to y^ Romans. And after great
batayles there was between the emperor Claudius and Armager king of Britayn.
And after accordement made that this Armager should wedde Claudius daughter /
and after they two should ever live in peace / in token whereof this Claudius
named ye cite where they were married after him and called it Claudicestre / we
call it now Glocestre. This Claudius had.iij. wives / and on Petiua ye first
wife he gate a daughter that hight Antonia The first wife decessed and he
wedded Messalina^ and gate a sone y^ hight Britanicus / and Octauia a daughter.
The third he wedded Agrippina / having a sone that hight Nero. Claudius
wedded his daughter Octauia to Nero his wives sone. This Claudius for love yt
he had to Agrippina his last wife he slew Messalina his second wife / lest she
should have help Britanicus her sone and his to ye empire. yet Agrippina ye
last wife of Claudius drad lest her husbonde would have proferred Britanicus
and have deposed Nero her sone / therefore she poisoned her husbonde Claudius /
and Nero was promoted to ye empire. And this same Nero gave his mother such a
reward again / for he poisoned Britanicus and slew his own (...)oder and his
wife Octauia. James the more y^ apostle this time was slain of Herod Agrippa
/ and Peter was pryso(...)d. vt pz act.xij. The body of saint James was brought
by myr(...) in to Ga(...) of Spain. Nero after Claudius (...)s emperor / and
he regne^.xiij. year and vij. months. This Nero was a cursed man / and made
great waste in y^ empire He would not fysshe but with nets of gold and ropes
of sylke. A great part of ye lords of Rome he slew. He was enemy to good
men. He slew his brother and his wife / his mother and his master. He slew
also Peter and Paul. He would never were one cloth two times. His horses and
his mules were shod with silver. And at the last he did set a great part of
Rome on fire / some say to se how Troy brent / and some say the Romans
co^playned ye streets were to narowe. And wha^ he had brent a great part of
Rome / Nero said there was space to build y^ streets wyder. Than ye senators
with the common people came upon him to (...)e him And he fled by night in to ye
subbarbes of y^ cite / and hyd him among ye vynes / and he herd karles and
beggars come by him that said / and they wist where the emperor were / he
should never escape them. Nero thought it should be great derogacion to his name
and he were slain of karles / and on a great stake he ^an himself to ye heart
and dyed / and there was buried / and deuyls kept his body many a day after /
and did great hurt to ye people / till by a miracle of our lord ye body was
found and taken away / and than the deuylles voyded. Seneca was this time
master to Nero. Iuuenalis poeta. Lucanus poeta. James ye less y^ apostle
bishop of Jerusalem was slain of ye Jews the vj. year of Nero. Marcus ye
eua^gelyst was martyred the first year of him.

^Anus ytalicus was pope of Rome.x. year and.iij. months and. xi(...) days.
This Linus and his successor Cl^tus through their holy co^uersacio^ were made
to mynyster ye treasour of the th(...) the to the people / Peter being
alive(...) Peter attended to prayer and prechynge. It is read of this Cletus
that he wrote first in his lettres Salute^ et apostolica^ vn^dictione^. Before
this time was many a dyscyple of Peter slain under Nero. Galba this time was
emperor / and he reigned seven months. This man was made emperor by the
power of spain in the same land / Nero living And after the death of Nero
brought to Rome / and there was slain of a man that came with whete to Rome.
He smote of his heed and bare it to him that was emperor next / seeing all
his meu / and none of them helpyng him. In this man's days came the great
Rethorycyen to Rome fro Spain / and was the first ye ever taught ye seyence
openly / his name was Quintilian. Ottho reigned after him / and he reigned but
three months for one Vitellus that was presydent of France challenged the
empire / and in Ytalye between these two were three great batayles / and in the
fourth battle Ottha saw he should be ouercomen / and in great despair he
slew himself. Vitellus reigned after this Ottho.viij. months for he was a
follower of Nero / most specially in glotony / and in singing of foul songs
/ and at feestes etyng out of mesure that he might not keep it. Vaspasianus
reigned next after him.ix. year.x. months and.xij. days. The well governed
men of Rome seeing the cursed succession of Nero / sent after this Vaspasyan
unto Palestyn / for there he was and his sone Titus / which had besyeged
Jerusalem. And when he herd yt Nero was deed / by whom he was sent to
Jerusalem / and herd of these cursed men regnynge / at the instau^ce of these
wise men of Rome / and not wylfully took upon him the empire. And anon as he
was comen to Rome / he overcame the tyrau^t Vitellus / and let him be drawn
through Rome / and after in Tyber till he was died and than let him sail without
sepulture for this the people desired. This man was cured of waspes in his nose
anon as he byleued in our lord Jesus / and that was the cause why he went to
Jerusalem to venge Christ's death. He fought xxxij. times with his enemies. And
he dyed the year of grace.lxxix.

Anno domini.lxxxiiij.
^Letus a martyr was pope.xi. year This Cletus was a Romayne / and greatly he
loved pilgrimages to saints saying it was more profit to ye health of man's
soul to visyte the place ye saint Peter was in / than to fast two year. He
cursed all those men lettynge such pylgrimages or cou^seylers contrary thereto.
At ye last was martyred by Damacian ye emperor. Titus soue to Vaspasyan was
emperor this time / and reigned.iij. year / and he abode still at Jerusalem
after the electyon of his fader / and destroyed the cite / and slew there (as
the story says) with battle and hungre.xi. ho^dred thousand jews / and an
hundred thousand he took / and sold.xxx. for a penny / because they sold our
lord Jesus Christ for.xxx. pens / and brought theus all thing that was precious
/ and put them in his house at Rome / whithe was called Te^plu^ pa cis. But now
is ye place fallen down for the most party. And all these precious iewelles
be distrybuted to certain chirches in Rome. This Citus was so full of virtue
that all men loved him / so fe^ forth that they called him the most delectable
of men. He was full lyberall to all men / in so much that he said often times
/ that there should no manner man goo front an Emperor with an heavy heart /
but he should no somewhat of his pe^icyon. He would be sorry that day in the
which he had granted no man no benefyte. When he was deed / every man yt was
in Rome wept for him / as that they had lost their fader. Domician brother to
Titus reigned after him xiiij. year and.v. months. First he was easy / and
afterward full unreasonable. For much of ye senate was destroyed by his
malice / and also much of his kynrede He began the second persecucyon after
Nero against christen men. In yt which persecucyon John ye eua^gelyst was
exiled in to Pathmos after ye emperor had put hy^ in to a tonne of bre^nyng
oil and hurt him not. So this man was not the follower of his fader Vaspasyan
/ ne his brother Titus / but rather like Nero and his kynrede. And for his
wicked ^o^dicyons he was slain in his own palace at Rome in the.xxvij. year of
his age. Cleme^s a martyr was pope.ix. year / and he succeeded Cletus. This
Clemens first of saint Peter (as it is said) was ordained to be successor to
him. And for peril he would Linu^ and Cletu^ should be popes before hy^ / lest
yt through ye ensample prelates should ordeyne under them who someuer they
would. This man made ye life of martyrs to be written by regyons / and he made
many books. He ordained yt a child should be co^fyrmed as soon as it might
manerly after it was chrystened. And at ye last he was martyred under Traian.
Nerua was emperor after Domician one year and two months. And wha^ he was
chosen he meued ye senate to make a law / yt all thing which Domician
commanded to be kept should be broken. By which mean saint John ye euangelyst
was losed out of his exile and suffered to come again to Ephese. This man did an
other thing right commendable / that he assygned so wise a man as Traian was
to govern ye people after him. Nota. Traianus hyspa uicus was Emperor.xix.
year. This Traianus many men said he was ye best among all the Emperors / but
in one thing alone he was vicyous / in so much as he for ye love of ye ^als
gods was about to destroy ye christen faith / judging in himself so most
to please god. Some men say not by himself / but by other he pursued ye
christen faith / and in ye end of his life he did but few to death. And all
his loving I set at naught. But at saint Gregory meued with pite weeping and
prayed to our lord for him yt he would have mercy upon him / and by his prayer
have him out of hell / in to which place he was dampened. And now if he be
saved or not / a great alteracyon is among doctors. And to us yt write
Cron^ties it is no part of our charge to determyn. But all ye eest part of ye
world / Babyl^ Selencia / the veter parts of the y^de. Germayne the second
after Alexander he held under. In all these things so pyteous and so mekely
he guyded him to every man as a king. He was gentle and to no man ungentle /
the which is red of few. All the days be lived men said he was the most
worthy man in all his empire. And he thought and said evermore yt no man was
more unworthy to be emperor than he.

Anno domini.C.iiij.
ANacletus a martyr was pope. i^. year / and he was a Greek. He monysshed all
christian men ye priests should be worshipped above all other men say enge ye
priests doing sacrefyce to god should be borne out / and not v^red but be
worshypped. And when priests said mass they should have wytnes with them and
namely bishops. Also he decreed ye clerks should were no ^erdes nor long
here. Also yt a bishop should be consecrated of three / and diverse other
things. At the last the.xij. year of Traian he was mar tired / and buried by
the body of saint Peter. Plinius ye second orator and philosopher wrote great
things. This man meued Traian that he should withdraw the sentence given
against christen folk / writing to him that they did none ill / but that they
as virtuous folk rose before day and worshypped Jesus Christ their god secretly
in the night. Euaristus a greek and a martyr was.x. year and.vij. months pope
after Anacletus. This man ordained that man and woman should be wedded openly /
and that they should be blyssed openly of the priest and fader and mother. And
he was martyred the third year of Adrian / and buried by saint Peter. Alexander
a Romayn was pope.viij. year and.v. months. This man the most part of ye
senators he converted to our lord. And he ordained ye holy water should be
kest in christen men's houses / and that breed to sing with should be made of
clear breed / and that in little quantite. At the last he was martyred under
Adrian that was emperor / and many he converted to ye faith of Christ. Sixtus
a Romayn was pope.x. year and.iij. months. This man ordained Sanctus sanctus
sanctus. etc. should be said in ye mass / and that the holy things of the
church should not be touched but of mynystres of the church. Also that ye
corporas should not be made of sylke / but of pure lynnen cloth wouen and not
dyed / and that a woman should not touch the holy vessel of the awter / ne
the pall. Also he ordained / that if any bysshopryke were vacau^t / that no
bishop should be received in to his benefyce but with the popes lettres. Also
that no mass should be said but upon an awter / and at the last he was
martyred. Adrian was emperor.xxi. year. This Adrian in many things is
commended / to christen men otherwhyle he was gracyous / and certain of them
that would not do sacrifyce to the false gods he slew. He was an universal
man almoost in all scyences. Peace he had all his days but with the Jews / and
many a law he made. And than he commanded that christen men should not be
dampened to death but with due process. Jerusalem he subdued again / and
forbade that no Jewe should dwell therein by no wise. Christen men he suffered
there to dwell. Against his will he came to the empire / but he governed him
very well. When the senators prayed him to call his sone emperor after him /
he said. It is enough to me yt against my will I have reigned which I have not
deserved. For ye empire of Rome should not go by succession of blood / but to
such men as deserve it through their merytes. Many times he regneth
vnuertuously that is a king borne / and virtue should come before his kingdom.
Eustachius otherwise called Placidus and Therospita his wife and two of their
sons / of whom meruaylous things ben read / were martyred by the
commandment of Adrian. This Placidus was master of the emperors knights.
Jerusalem was restored by Adrian and made larger / so that the place where
Christ dyed was within ye walls / yt which was without before. And this is
the third building again of that cite. For it was thryes destroyed / that is
to say / of Call dees in the time of zedechie / of Anthiocus in the time of
Machabeorum / and of Titus in the time of Vaspasian.

^Elesphorus a Romayn was pope.xi. year. This man ordained this au^gelles ympne
to be songen in the mass Gloria in excelsis deo. etc. and the gospel to be
read before ye sakeryng / and on Chrystmas day.iij. masses to be songen And he
ordained there should no mass be said before.iij. of ye last he was martyred /
and buried at saint Peter's Ignius a greek was pope.iiij. year. This man
ordained that a child should have a godfader and a godmoder at baptym and
co^fyrmacyon. Also that no archebysshop (excepted the pope) should condemn
his suffrygan but if that the cause were showed in ye prouyncyall cou^ seyle of
bishops. Than he was martyred / and buried at saint Peter's. Anthonius Pius was
emperor.xxij. year with his sons Aurolio and Lucio. This man was myghtely wise
/ and naturally fair of speech / the which lightly in one man is not found.
Nota. Exceeding men in wysdom comynly are not fair speched nor peasfull namely
of nature. Nor contrarywyse. Exceeding men in fair speech comynly are less
than wise. This man was meued with both these propertees Therefore many kingdoms
the which receded from other emperors / wylfully to this man returned again.
And to christen men was none so gentle. He said through the ensample of Cipio.
I had lever keep one here of a man than slay an hundred of mine enemies. And
some martyrs were made under him / but they were made under ye command meant
of ye emperors before. And ye chryste^ people were so hateful to ye bishops
and to ye priests of ye temple of ye falls gods that they provoked the
princes always against them. For they supposed that ye chryste^ faith should
destroy them. There fore it was no marvel (all though the prince was ill
pleased / for they said all their gods were deuyls) if lower judges pursued
christian folk and martired the^ This time.x. M. martyrs were crucified in

he made the fourth persecucyon to slay christen men. This Marcus was of so
great sad nes and stedfastnes / that for no chance he never laughed / ne
changed no there / neither for gladness ne for sorrow. And when he was a child
he was of such manhood / yt on a certain time wha^ he looked his tresour / and
had not yt which he might give his knights and his men / when he went to
fight against ye Germayns / the Sciauo^s and Sarmatas / he would hurt ne grieve
no body / but had lever to sell his wives golden vessel / and her arayment /
her beddyng and all her ryall stuff / than take tax of ye senators or of his
prouynce under him. But he gate ye victory of his enemies and recovered all
again / and releaced ye prouynces of their tributes. And those y^ would sell hy^
his wives tresour again / he restored them their money / and those y^ would
not he never grieved them. But ye tables of their dettes betwixt hy^ and them he
brent openly in ye market place: and thanked them that they helped him in his
necessite.

How king Lucie reigned after his fader / which was a good man / and after he
became christen.
AFter king Coyll reigned Lucie his sone / that was a good man to god and to
all the people. He sent to Rome to Eleuther that than was pope and said that
he would become a christen man / and receive baptym in the name of god / and
turn to the right faith and believe. Eleuther sent two legates / yt one was
called Pagan / and that other Elibayn and came in to this land and baptized
the king and all his meyny. And after went from town to town and baptized
the people / till all the land was baptized. And this was in the year an.C.
and. lvj after the incarnacyon of our lord Jesus Christ. And than this king
Lucie made in this land two archebysshops / one at Canterbury / and an other
at york / and many other bishops that yet be in this land. And when these
two legates had baptized all this land / they ordained priests for to baptyse
children / and for to make the sacrament. And after they went again to Rome.
And the king dwelled in this land and reigned with much honor.xij. year /
and after dyed and lies at Glocestre.

How this land was long without a king / and how ye brytons chose a king.
THis king Lucie had none heir of his body begoten yt was after ward great
harm and sorrow to ye land. For after this king Lucies death / none of the
great lords of ye land would suffer an other to be king / but lived in war
and debate among themself.l. year without king. But it befell afterward y^ a
great prince came fro Rome in to this land y^ was called Seuerye / not for to
war / but for to save ye right of Rome. But nevertheless he had not dwelled
half a year in this land but yt the brytons slew him. And when ye Romans
wist that Seuerye was so slain / they sent an other great lord in to this
land yt was called Allec that was a strong man and a mighty of body / and
dwelled in this land long time / and did much sorrow to ye brytons / so that
after for pure malice they chose them a king among them that was called
Asclepades / and assembled a great host of Brytons / and went to London to
seek Allec / and there they found him and slew him and all his felawes / and
one y^ was called walon defended him fyersly and fought long with ye Brytons /
but at the last he was disco^fyted / and ye Brytons took him and bound him
hands and feet / and cast him in to a water / wherefore y^ water was called for
evermore Walbroke. Than reigned Asclepades in peace / till one of his earls yt
was called Coyl made a fair town against ye kings will / and let call y^
town Colchestre after his name / wherefore the king was wroth / and thought to
destroy him / and began to war upon hy^ / and brought great power of men /
and gave ye earl battle / and the earl defended him fyersly with his power /
and slew ye king himself in that battle. And tha^ was Coyll crowned and
made king of this land. This Coyll reigned nobly / and was well beloved of ye
brytons. When y^ Romans herd y^ Asclepades was slain / they were wonders
glad / and sent an other great pry^ce of y^ Romans that was called Constance /
and he came to king Coyll for to challenge y^ trybute of Rome / which he
granted him full gladly. So they accorded y^ king Coyll gave to him his
daughter Eleyne to wife / y^ was both fair and wise and well lettred / and
dwelled together in love. And soon after this king Coyll dyed in the.xiij. year
of his regne / and lies at Colchestre.

How Constance a Romayn that had spoused Eleyne king Coyls daughter was chosen
king after king Coyll.
AFter this king Coyll Co^stance was made king and crowned for as much as he
had spoused king Coyls daughter that was heir of the land / the which
Constance reigned / and well and worthily governed the lord. And he begat on
his wife Eleyne a sone yt was called Co^stantyne. And this king bare true faith
/ and truly did to them of Rome all his life. And wha^ he had reigned.xv. year
he dyed / and lies at york.

How Constantyne that was king Constances sone and sone to saint Eleyne
governed and ruled the land / and after was emperor of Rome.
AFter king Constance death reigned Constantyne his sone and sone to saint
Eleyne that found y^ holy cross in the holy land / and how Co^stantyne
became emperor of Rome. It befell that in that time there was an emperor at
Rome yt was a sarasyn and a tyrau^t yt was called Maxence / which put to death
al y^ byleued in god / and destroyed holy church by all his power / and slew
all chryste^ men that he might find / and among all other he let martyr saint
Katheryne / and many other christen people yt had dread of death fled and came
in to this land to king Constantyne / and told him of y^ sorrow that Maxence
did to chryste^ folk / wherefore Co^stantyn had pite / and made great sorrow and
assembled a great host and a great power and went over unto Rome / and there
took the cite / and slew all y^ was therein of mys believe. And than was he made
emperor / and was a good man / and governed him so well / y^ all lands were
to hy^ attendau^t for to be under his governance. And this devil and tyrau^t
Ma(...) y^ time was in the land of Greece and herd these tydy^ges / and
suddenly became wood and dyed suddenly. When Constantyne went from this land
to Rome he took with hy^ his mother Eleyne for her great prudence / and three
other great lords y^ (...) most loved / the one was called Howell and y^
other Taberne / and ye third Mo(...). And took all his land to keep to ye
earl of Cornewayle that was called Octauian And anon as this Octauian wist
that his lord dwelled at Rome incontinent he cesed all the land into his
hands and therewith did all his will among (...) and low / and they held him
for king. When these tidings came to Co^stantyne the emperor / he was wonders
wroth toward the earl Octauyan and sent Taberne with.xij. M. men against him
and they arrived at Portesmouth. When Octauian wist that he let assembled a
great power of Brytons and dyscomfyted him. And Taberne fled in to Scotlonde
/ and ordained there a great power / and came again in to this land another
time for to give battle to Octauyan. And when Octauyan understood that / he
assembled a great power / and came toward Taberne as fast as he might / so
that those two hoostes met together on Stanesmore / and strongly smote
together. And than was Octauyan dysco^fyted / and fled thens unto Norway. And
Taberne seized all ye land in to his hands both towns and castelles. But
Octauyan came again fro Norway with a great power / and drove out al ye
Romans and than he was made king of this land.

How Maximian that was the emperors cosyn of Rome spoused Octauyans daughter /
and after was made king of this land.


THis Octauian governed ye land well and nobly / but he had none heir / save
a daughter that was a yo^ge child / that he loved as much as his life. And for
as much as he waxed seek and was in point of death and might no longer regne /
he would have made one of his neuewes to be king / which was a noble knight and
a strong man yt was called Conan Meriedok: and he should have kept the kings
daughter / and have married her when time had been. But the lords of ye land
would not suffer it / but gave her counsel to be married to some high man of
great honor / and tha^ might she have al her lust / and the counsel of her
lord Co^sta^tyne ye emperor. And at this counsel they accorded / and chose
Cador of Cornewayle for to go to ye emperor on this message / and he took ye
way and went to Rome / and told the emperor these tidings well and wisely.
And ye emperor sent in to this land with him his own cosyn that was his
uncles sone a noble knight and a strong yt was called Maximyan / and he
spoused Octauyans daughter / and was crowned king of this land.

How Maximian that was the emperors cosyn conquered ye land of Amorican / and
gave it to Conan Meriedok.
THis king Maximian became so ryall yt he thought to conquer ye land of
Amorican for ye great richesse yt he herd tell that was in y^ land / so yt he
ne left no man of worthynes / knight ne squire / ne none other man yt he ne
took with him / to ye great damage of all ye lord. For he left at home no man
to keep ye land / for he had with him.xxx. M. knights of good men's bodies /
and went over in to the land of Amorican / and there slew the king that was
called Imball / and conquered all the land. And when he had so done / he
called Conan and said. For as much as king Octauyan would have made you king
of Brytayn / and through me ye were let and dystroubled y^ ye were not king / I
give you this lord of Amorican / and make you king thereof. And for as much as
ye be a bryton / I will that this lord have the same name / and that it be no
more called Amorican / but shall be called little Brytayne / and the land fro
whens we be comen / shall be called fro hens forth great Brytayne. And so shall
men know that one Brytayne fro that other. Tha^ this Conan Meriedok thanked
hy^ curteysly / and so was he made king of little Brytayn. And when all this
was done Maximyan went from thens unto Rome / and was than made emperor after
Constantyne. And Conan Meriedok dwelled in little Britayn with much honor /
and there let ordeyne two. M. plowmen of the land for to ere the land / to
harowe and sow it / and feffed them rychely after yt they were. And for as
much as king Conan and none of his knights / ne none of his other people
would not take wives of the nacyon of france / he sent in to great Brytayne to
ye earl of Cornewayle that men called Dio nothe / that he should chose through
out all this lord.xj. M. maidens / that is to say.viij. M. for the mean
people / and.iij. M. for ye gretest lords that should them spouse. And wha^
Dionothe understood this / he made a commandment through out all the land of
Brytayn / and as many as the nombre came to he assembled together of mayde^s /
for there was no man that durst withstand his commandment because he was
protector. And when these maidens were assembled / he let them come before him
at London / and let ordeyne ships for them hastily / with all that thereto
belonged. And took his own daughter that was called Vrsula / that was ye
fairest creature y^ any man wist And he would have sent her to king Conan yt
should have spoused her and made her queen of ye land. But she had made pryuely
to god a vow of chastity yt her fader wist not / ne none other man living.

How Vrsula and.xj. M. maidens that were in her company went toward little
Brytayne / and all they were martyred at Coleyne.
THis Vrsula those unto her company.xj. M. maidens that of all other she was
lady and maystresse / and all they took shyppynge at one time in the water that
is called Tamyse / and commanded her kyn and friends to almighty god and
sailed toward little Brytayn. But when they were comen in to ye high see a
strong tempest arose as it was gods will / and Vrsula with her ships and
her company were dryue^ to Hunlo^de through tempest / and arrived in y^ haven
of the cite of Coleyne. And the king of the land that was called Gowan was
than in y^ cite / and when he wist the tidings that so many fair maidens were
there arrived / he took Elga his brother and other of his household with him and
went to the ships to se that fair company. And when he saw them so fair /
he and his company would have ouer^ayen them and have taken fro them their
virgy(...)te. But Vrsula that good virgyn counseyled / prayed / warned / and
taught then: that were her felawes / that they shol^^ defend them with all
their might / and rather suffer death than suffer their bodies to be defouled.
So that all the virgyns became so steadfast in god that they defended them
through his grace that none of them had power to do them shame. Wherefore king
Gowan was sort anoyed / that he for wrath slew them euerychone anon right.
And so were all those virgyns martyred for the ^our of god / and they lie at
Coleyn.

How king Gowan came for to destroy this land / and how a man of great power
that was called Gracian defended the land.
When all this was done / king Gowan which was a sarasyn called to him his
brother Elga and said to him that he should go and conquer the land that all
those fair maidens were borne in. And tha^ he ordained a great power of
Pehites of denmark / of Orkeney / and of Norway. And they came in to this
land and brent towns / and slew folk / and cast down chirches and houses of
religyon / and robbed the land in length and bread / and put to death all those
that would not forsake ye right believe and chryste^dom. For as much as there
was no sovereign yt might help them. For the king Maximian had taken with him
all ye worthy men when he went to conquer little Brytayn. And in ye same time
was saint Albon martyred through the wode tyrau^t Dioclesyan / in ye same place
where is now an abbey made of saint Albons / whiles yt he was a paynym. But he
was converted unto god through the predycacyon of a clerk and a wise man that
was called Ancibel that was herborowed a night in his house. And this was after
ye incarnacion of Jesus Christ.CC.xxvj. year. And it is to be understand that
saint Albon suffered his martyrdom before saint Edmond. And therefore is saint
Albon called ye first martyr of England. This Gowans brother and his folk that
were sarasyns went through out the land and destroyed all thing yt they
found and no thing they spared. When these tidings came to Rome how ye king
Gowan had begone for to destroy this land / the emperor and the Romans sent
a strong man and of great power yt was called Gracien with xxiiij. M.
fighting men / for to cast out of this land all those sarasyns. And all they
arrived at Portesmouth. Maximian might not come himself because he was chosen
emperor after the death of Co^stantyne yt was saint Eleyns sone When this
Gracian was arrived with his host / he let espy pryuely where ye king Gowan
might be found / and he set upon them suddenly as they lay in their beds /
and disco^fyted them and slew them in their beds euerichone / that none of
them escaped: save Gowan yt fled in to his own country with great sorrow.
Soon after it befell ye Maximyan was slain at Rome through treason. And when
Gracian wist of those tidings / he let crown himself king of this land.

How Gracian made him king when Maximyan was slain / and afterward ye Britons
slew him for his wyckednes.
THis Gracian when he began to regne / he became so wicked and so stern / and
so much sorrow did to the Brytons that they slew him among them. When king
Gowan understood that Gracian was slain / he assembled a great power and came
again in to this land / and if he had first done harm than did he much
more. For he than destroyed all this land and the christen people that were
therein / so that no man was so hardy to name god / and if they did they were
put to strange death. But the bishop of London yt was tho which was called
Gosselyn escaped and went thens to them of Rome to seek socour to help to
destroy the sarasyns that had destroyed this land. And the Romans said yt
they had been so often anoyed for their sendyng of folk in to Britayne all for
to help the Britons / and they would no more so do. And so the bishop Gosselyn
went thens without any socour or help. And than went he to ye king of little
Brytayne yt was called Aldroie / and this was ye third king after Gowan
Meriedok / as before is said. The bishop prayed this king Aldroie of help
and socour. And ye king had pite in his heart when he herd how ye bishop
fled / and how the christen men were so slain in great Brytayne through ye
paynyms and sarasyns / he granted him Co^stantyne his bro^er for to help him
with power of folk. And cha^ did array horse / harneys and ships and all
thing yt neded to that vyage. And when all thing was ready / he called ye
bishop and said to him. I take you here Co^stantyne my brother upon this
covenant / yt if god give him grace to disco^fyte ye infydele^s / that than ye
shall make him king. And ye bishop granted it with a good will. Co^stantyne and
the bishop took leave of ye king Aldroie / and betoke him to god / and
took.xij. M^inen and went to their ships / and sailed toward great Britayn /
and arrived at Totnes. When ye Britons herdethese tidings that socour came /
they were glad / and ordained them an huge no^^re of people / and went and
received them with much honor Gowan anon as he wist of these ty dynges / he
assembled all his farasyns and came against them and gave the^ battle. And
Co^stantyn slew him with his own hands / and all the other sarasyns were
dyscomfyted and slain yt none escaped / except those that were couerted to
god.

How Constantyne that was the kings brother of little Britayn was crowned king
of great Brytayne for his worthynes.
Anon after ye battle they went to London and crowned there Constantyne king
of this land / and ye bishop Gosselin set the crown on his heed / and
a^oynted hy^ as it belongs for a king. And tha^ began christe^dom in this
land again. And anon after wha^ this king Constantyn was crowned he spoused a
wife through rou^seyle of ye Brytons / and begat on herthre sons. The first
was called Co^stance / ye second Aurilambros and the third Vter. This
Constance yt elder brother wha^ he came to o^^ he (...) him a monk at
Wynchestre. And Consta^tyne their fader was slain through treason. For it
befell upon a time that a Pehyte came to him upon a day as it were on a
message / and said that he would speak with the king pryuely in counsel. The
king let ^oyde his chamber of the men that were there within / and there abode
no moo but the king and the Pehite / and he made a countenance as though he
would have spoken with the king in his eere. And there he show him with a
long knyfe. And after that he went meruaylously out of that chamber in to an
other chamber / so that at the last no man wist where he was b^romen. When the
kings men wist that their lord was so deed / they made than so much sorrow /
yt they wist not what for to do. For as much as his two sons Aurilambros and
Vter were so young / that none of them might be king and the third brother was
a monk at ^^^ chestre as is said before. But ^o^nger that was earl of Westler
thought pryuely in his heart through some subry^e for to be king himself. And
went to Wynchestre where as Constance was monk / and said to him. Co^stance
qued be your fader is deed / and your two brethern that been with Gosselyn the
bishop of London to nourysshe / be so young that neue of them may be king
wherefore I counsel you that ye forsake your habyte and come with me / and I
shall make such a mean unto the Brytons that ye shall be made king of this
land.

Of Constance that was king Constantynes sone / which was a monk at
Wynchestre / and how he was made king after his faders death / through
counseyle of ^o^^ger that was ^^^e of Westser for as much as Aurilambros and
(...) his two brethren were but young of age. And Vortiger let she ^ya^ for
to be king himself.
THis Vortiger cou^seyled this Co^s^a^ce so much till he forsook his ab^ot and
went with him. And anon after he was crowned king by ye assent of the Brytons.
This king Constance when he was crowned and made king he will ne knew but
little of ye world nor could no thing what knyghthode axed. And he made
Vortyger his chief master and cou^seyler / and gave him all his power for to
ordeyn and to do as much as to ye realm aperteyned. So yt himself no thing
entermedled / but only bare the name of king. Wha^ Vortiger saw that he had
all ye lord in his ward and governance at his own will / he thought by
preuy treason to slay Co^stance ye king that he might himself be crowned and
made king and regne / and let send after an hundred knights of Pehytes / ye
worthyest of all ye land / and them held with him for to dwell / as to be
kepers of his body / as he would go through the land to ordeyne things yt
appertayned to a king. And this Vortiger honored so much ye hundred knights
and so much gave them of gold and silver and of rich iewelles / robes horses
and other things plente / wherefore they held him more lord than they did the
king. And Vortiger told them: if he might be king / ye as it were through
treason / he would make them rychest of ye land. So at ye last through great
gifts that he had given largely / they cried through ye court yt Vortiger were
better worthy to be king tha^ Co^stance. Wherefore Vortiger made semblau^t as he
had been wroth / and he departed thens from ye court / and said he must go
else where for things that he had to do. And so the traitor said because yt
they should slay king Constance. When this Vortiger was gone / it befell soon
easter (...) those hundred knights of Pe^ites wiche the doors of ye kings
chamber / and there they slew hy^ / and smote of his heed and ba^e it to
Vortiger there as he dwelled. And wha^ Vortiger saw ye heed / he wept full
tenderly with his eyes / and nevertheless he was somdele glad in his heart of
his death. And anon Vortiger let take those hundred knights of Pehites / and
had his servants bind their haudes behind them and led them to London /
and there they were dampened to death as falls traitors. And anon after all ye
Brytons of the land by the common assent crowned Vortiger and made him king of
ye land.

SOther a martyr was pope after Anicetu^.ix. year / the which decreed that a
No^ne should not touch the pall of the awter / nor put in sense thereto And yt
she should were a wymple about her heed. And many peryls he saw about
matrymony / therefore he ordained that no woman should be called a lefu^^ wife /
but if she were blissed of ye priest. Eleutherus a martyr was pope after
Sother.xv. year / the which ordained that christen men should refuse no meet
reasonable that was man's meet Nota. Also that no man vnaccused in a crime
should be put from his dignite or his degree till he were co^uicted / through
ensample of Christ / yt which kept still Judas Scaryoth not accused / and
Christ knew hy^ gylty. And what someuer he did among the apostles for ye
dignite of his service abode fyrme and stable. This pope sent also legates unto
Lucye king of Britayn / the which baptized him and his people. And Fagus and
Domianus legates the which ye pope sent first ^rechc^ in England. And this
Chrystendom endured in Brytayne two hundred year unto ye time of Dioclesian ye
emperor / wha^ saint Albon was martyred. Marcus Antonius and Lucius Comodus
were emperors / but Marcus dyed anon / and Lucius Comodus reigned. Comodus was
called profitable in scorn / for he was to every man unprofitable / he was
given utterly to lechery / many senators and christen men he made for to be
slain. He dampened his own wife to death for age / he dyed a sodeyn death with
strouglyng among maidens. Helius pertinax after this man was emperor vj.
months / and was a man of great discrecyon / whom Julian ye great lawyer
slew / and he entered ye empire / and was slain the.vij. month of Seuerus.
Victor a martyr was pope after Eleutheriu^.x. year / and for the discord of ye
pascall time he called a counsel in Alexander / where he was present ye time
/ and many other / where he decreed ye eester day should be kept on ye sunday
/ but he must keep the change of ye moan of Apryll / and that was to dyffre
fro Jews / for many bishops of the eest abode ye time the same day ye jews
did halowe that feast. Also he ordained yt in time of need children might be
chrystened in every place / and in every water. zepherinus a martyr and a
Romayne was pope after Victor.ix. year. This man ordained that chryste^ people
of.xij. year of age and above should receive his god on eester day ones in a
year. Also he ordained that all the vessel of the awter should be glass or
tynne / and not tree as in old time the co^secracyon of ye glorious blood was
made in treue vessel. And this time passed / and the worship of the church
grew / and glasen vessel were forbode. vt pz de co^se. di. pri. ca. Origines
ye noble clarke was this time / and he wrote so much that saint Jerome said
himself to have read of Origenes wer^es.iiij. M. volumes without pystles. He
translated the bible from hebrewe in to greek / and did many other great
things. And of this Origene / Samson / Solomon and Traian is a great questyon
among doctors / if yt they be dampened or saved. Therefore those things that
without peril we be not bounden to know nor the church is not certyfyed of
them / and therefore let them be all only committed unto god. Calistus a martyr
and a Romayn was pope after zepherinus.v. year and he ordained ye c^^^tery (in
via apia) where many a. M. martyrs be buried. Also he ordained the fast of ye
emerynge days to be kept. Antonius Aurelius was emperor.iij. year. And this
man lacked no kind of lechery / and at ye last he was slain among a great
multitude of people for his myscheuous living. Antonius Marcus reigned after
him vij. year. This man lived obstynatly and therefore he was slain as was his
predecessor. Alexander was emperor after Antomus / and reigned.xiij. year.
This man at the instau^ce of his mother a christen woman / and the techynge of
Origene the which came to Rome to convert her was made so good unto christen
men yt he suffered them to have their cou^seyles and their prayers by themself
/ but nevertheless in this time the cursed officers of him made many martyrs.

Anno domini.CC.xliiii.
VRbanus was pope after Calist viij. year / and old and young he was very
virtuous. And all the hallowed vessel of the church he made of gold or of
silver. This man left his poperyche and went to Agrippam / and.xi. M. virgins
with him. And the clargye said he left not his dignite for holiness / but for
appe tyte of those virgyns / and wrote him not in the book of popes. And there
he a virgyn was martyred with these virgyns Poncianus a martyr succeeded Vrbanus
/ and he ordained that psalms should be said day and night in ye church of
god And that a priest should say Confiteor before ye mass. Anteros a martyr
was pope after this man. This man ordained that a bishop might be remeued from
one to an other / and he made ye life of martyrs to be written / and he was
slain and buried in the Cimitery of saint Calixte. Maximianus was chosen
emperor at Maguncia of ye host / and not by ye senators / and reigned three
year / and destroyed ye church myghtely / and was slain for Origene. Gordian
reigned after him.vj. year / and of him is little written / but he was slain.

after Gordian / and this Philyp chose to him Philyp his sone / and they
reigned.vij. year. And they were ye first Emperors yt were chrystened / and
after slain of the host. They bequethed all their tresour at their death yt it
should be dysposed to poor men. And saint Laurence at ye assygnacyon of his
master ye pope departed this tresour about Rome the which was great cause of
his martyrdom. vt qide^ dicu^t. Dec^us was emperor.iij. year / and in all
things a tyrau^t For he entered the empire when he and the host had slain ye
two Philyps his lords / and after yt he was slain with his sone. Fabianus a
martyr and a Romayn was pope after Anteros.xij. year. This was a very holy man
/ for when chryste^ men stood to abide ye eleccio^ of ye pope / suddenly a
white dove or a culuer descended on his heed / saying to him / thou shall be
pope of Rome. This man ordained that creme every year should be hallowed upon
sherthursday. Also he divided regyons to dekens the which should write ye life
of martyrs. And at ye last Decius slew him. Cornelius a martyr and Romayn was
pope after Fabianus.iii. year. This man took up ye bodies of Peter and Paul
and with great honor put them in worshypfull places with ^ta^ Lucina. Lucius was
pope after Cornelius.iij. year / and of him little is wryte^. Gallus with his sone
Volusianus were emperors two year / and they fought with Emilianus / and were
slain And Emilianus the third month was slain. Valerian was emperor with his
sone Galyene.xv. year. This man was virtuous and manly in ye beginning / but
after he was given to vice and much wretchedness / and so was his sone Galyene.
This Valerian went to ye land of Perse and there for ye blood shedynge of
martyrs he was taken of ye king of Perse. And when he had taken hy^ he put out
both his eyes / and kept him in great bondage and to this intent he kept him
/ yt when so ever he should ride / this Valerian should lie down / and he should
set his feet upon his back wha^ he would take his horse. This herd Galiene his
sone yt was left at Rome / and that caused him yt he was not so cruel against
christen men. And here was the.viij. persecucyon of the church made by this
emperor / and made the Romans to lose their kingdoms / ye which were never

corn and benes should be blyssed on ye awter. And he buried. iij.C. and.
xliiij martyrs with his own hands. Aurelius was emperor after Claudius.v.
year. This Aurelius first to christian men was gentle / wherefore he had the
vyctory in every place gloryously / and when he was deceived by cursed men /
and pursued christen men myghtely / and namely in france / for there he abode
/ and after that he had never good fortune / but was slain. And this was
the.ix. persecucyon of ye christen faith. Tacitus was emperor after this man /
and he reigned but.iii. months and was slain in Ponto. Probus was Emperor
after him.v. year and.iiij. months. This man recovered France again / the
which was occupied with barbary men. And he gave them and Pannonias license to

Knights within a little time shall not be necessary. And anon after he was
slain at Syrmiu^. Carus and his two sons Carmus and Numerianus were emperors
after Probus but soon they dyed / and their fader was drowned / and the two
sons were slain. All these reigned but.ij. year. Dioclesian and Maximyan came
after these three emperors / the one reigned in the eest / and the other reigned
in the west. The first thing that Dioclesian did / he brent all the christen
men's books that might be found. These two tyrau^tes did more harm to
christian men than ever did any other. For.x. year lasted their persecucyon And
as we read / wtin.xxx. days.xx. M. men were slain for christ's cause. And in
England all the faith was almoost destroyed in the time of Maximyan.

Gaius was pope after Euticianus. This man ordained that no man should accuse a
bishop or an other clerk to any seculer judge. And yt a pagan or an heretyke
should not accuse a christian man. Also he ordained that he that was worthy should

Marcell(...)us a martyr was pope after Gaius.xi. year and.iiij. months. This
man was sore persecuted / and for dread of death he offered. (...). (...)nes of
encense to ye sacrifyce of ye ydolles. And afterward he openly repented and

dread of the curse of god. And after through a visyon of saint Peter and
Marcell he was buried at saint Peter's fo^e. Marcellus was pope after
Marcell(...)us.v. year. This man ordained that a general counsel might not
be ordained without ye auctorite of ye pope. vt pz.xvij. d^. (...). sinodu^.

when he had kept beestes long time in a house closed in with them by ye
commandment of Maximian he dyed for fault. Eusebius a martyr was after this
man two months and certain days. This man of a lay man was made pope / and
he ordained that no lay man should accuse his bishop / but if he went from his

in brytayn. This Albon wha^ he was a pagan he lodged a certain man the which
converted him to the faith / and after was judged unto death / and much people
he turned unto our lord yt were nygh ye water / the which he made dry through
his prayer. And he suffered death nygh the cite of Ve^elom. Vide plura in vita
scti^ Albani. Melchiades a martyr succeeded Eusebius four year. This man
forbode ye men should fast on sondays and on thursdays / in so much as pagans
fast on those days. At the last he was martyred as al his predecessors were.
And know ye that there were. xxxiij popes of Rome martyred each one after
other. Peter was the first / and this Melchiades was the last. And than it was
laudable (after Gregory) a man to desire a bysshopryche. Galerius was emperor
after Dioclesian two year / and an other with him called Constancius / so was
ye empire in those days divided. This Constancius after he had conquered all
Spain / he came in to great Britayn / and there he wedded a ky^ges daughter /
on whom he gate great Co^stantyne And this same Co^stancius dyed in Brytayn /
and lies at York / as Martin says in his chronicles / and left on live
Co^stantyne that was gotten on Eleyne / and was king of Brytayne and of France.

Anno Christi.CCC.viij.
SIluester was pope after Melchiades. This was a glorious confessor / and many
ways he worshypped ye church of god / what in writing and what in miracles.
He received the patrimony of saint Peter / that is for to say / the kingdom
of Ytalye with the cite of Rome of Constantyne the emperor / and to the
worship of the church of god he turned it. He baptized Eleyne and the Jews /
and than he decessed a confessor. Constantyne ye mighty was emperor this
time. This Co^stantyne was a glorious man and a victoryous in battle. In
gouernyng of the common people he was very wise. And in ye necessite of ye
believe he was without comparison devout. His pite and his holiness be so written
in ye books of holy doctors that without doubt he is to be no^bred among
saints. And the Greeks say that in the end of his life he was made a monk.
And more ye may here of him in the chronicles of england / for he was king of
England. Helena the quent mother to Constantyne repaired again the holy cross
this time / and she made lxx. colleges / and she gloryfyed the state of all
holy church. Nycholas the bishop of Myrre cite an holy man was this time.
Athanasius was this time bishop in Alexandria a glorious doctor / and made
the cymbalu^ Q uicu^que vult saluus esse. etc. Marcus was pope after Siluester
two year and.viij. months. This man ordained that ye Creed should be openly
songen in the church / and that the bishop of Hostiense should consecrate the
pope / and that he should were a pall. Julius was pope after Marcus.xj. year.
This man was exiled x. year / and after suffered death under Constantyne the
second. Co^stantinus with his two brethren reigned.xxiiij. year / and in his
last end he was perverted by the heresy of ye arryens / by a bishop called
Eusebi / and he pursued the church of god strongly. The end of this man was
this As he should go to Constantynople to a great counsel / in the which
counseyle he thought to have condemned the bishop and the clerks of true
believe / he went before unto a chamber to avoid such things as nature
requires / and anon suddenly his bowelles fell from him and so dyed. Libersus
was pope after Julius.xix. year and.vij. months. Than was ye second dyscorde
of ye church between Liberius and Felix for ye heresy of the arryens the
which favored Liberius. Than Constancius ye emperor called again Liberius
from his exyle because he favored this heresy. And ye church dejected
Liberius / and took Felix for pope / and the other was expulsed as an heretyke
of the church. But Felix obtained not / for ye emperor put in Liberius and
expulsed Felix. Felix was pope after the death of this Liberius / and he
declared Co^stancius ye emperor an heretyke / and anon after he was martyred.
And here was the first that ever the church of Rome had an infamed pope. For
all ye predecessors of this Liberius were saints / and gave holy ensamples.
Iulianus apostata was after Constancius emperor.ij. year and.viij. months.
He was called apostata because he fled this Co^stantius which slew his
brother / and for fere of death was made a christen man and a monk. But
afterward by ye counseyle of a nygromancer he asked the devil wheder he
should be emperor or not. The devil said that he should be emperor upon a
co^dycyon that he should forsake his chryste^ faith / and be utter enemy to
chryste^ men. And so he did / for he gave leave to the Jews that they should
build again ye temple in spyte of ye christen men. And took all ye goods ye
christen men had / and destroyed many of them. Iouinianus was emperor after
him.viij. months. For when Julian was deed the host chose him emperor / and
he was a christian man And he said it was not lefull to a christian man to be
lord over so many hethen people. They answered and said. Rather than he should
forsake the empire they would be thrystened. And thus took he ye dignite. But
soon he was deed / and in meruaylous manner. For he was laid in a close house
(after his journey) made all of stone / newly whyted with lyme / in ye which
they made to his comfort as they thought a fire of charcole / and of ye air of
these two on the morrow he was found deed. Valentinian with his brother Valent
was emperor after Iouinianus. x^. year / for he departed the empire / and gave
his brother the eest / and kept himself the west part. This Vale^tinian was a
lord with Julian apostata / and it happed him on a time for to go in to a
temple of false gods for to do sacryfyce / and mynystres stood there with
water hallowed after their guyse / with ye which they spryncled the lords.
This Vale^tinian smote the mynystre that kest the water upon him / and said he
was rather defouled thereby than cleansed. Because of this Julian did exile him.
But our lord god for his open confession of his name rewarded him with ye
empire. His brother Valent fell in to the opinyon of the a^^yans and dyed in
that heresy. This same Valent lived four year after Valentinian with Gracian
the emperor. This time lived saint Ambrose.

Anno domini.CCC.lxiiij.
DAmasus was pope after Felix xviij. year and.ij. months. This was an
eloquent man in meter / and he wrote many stories of popes and martyrs. He
ordained that (...) patri should be said in the end of the psalms / and that
was at the prayer of saint Ierom. And through ye mocyon of this pope Ierom
translated the bible from hebrewe in to latin / and than he decessed a
confessor Valent with Gracian and Valentinian were emperors four year. In
this time were chirches opened again / and christen men had leave to renew the
service of god y^ was defended before with emperors infected with heresy / as was
Valens and other / wherefore y^ church had no liberte when Valens was on live.
A synodus of an.C. and.l. bishops were gadred under Damase pope at
Constantinople against Macedoniu^ an heretic the which denied y^ holy ghost
to be very god. And than was the Credo made that is song on holy days in y^
church Augustinus a Cartaginen^ of Africa was this time / he was as noble a
retho ricyen as might be / and in all philosophy and poetry incomparable / and
all thing that any philosopher found in his youth / he understood with little
labor. And about this time he was sent to Milan where he was turned anon of
saint Ambrose and baptized. This man grew unto a noble doctor of y^ church.
And not long after that he was bishop of Yponen^. and there he lived.liij.
year / and much divinity he wrote. vt pz in libris suis. Siritius was pope
after Damasus.xv. year He dampened heretykes / and little else is written of
him. Theodosius sone to Gracian with Vale^tyne his uncle was emperor.xxvij.
year. This man was a christen man and a gracyous / and in governance like to
Traian / soon wroth / and anon reconsyled. This man on a day when he would
have gone to here mass saint Ambrose forbade him the enter of the church till
he had done penance / and made satisfaccyon for y^ sleynge of y^. xxx knights
/ which he slew in anger at Constantinople. Wherefore they made a law that y^
sentence of a prince should be deferred.xxx. days of those that should do
execucyon if they might fall in y^ grace of y^ prince with in the.xxx. days.
About this time was a child borne in y^ castle of Emons from y^ nauyll and
above divided in to two bodies / having.ij. hedes and two wits / so that the
one (...)epyng or erynge / that other slepte nor ete not / and wha^ they were
two year of age / the one decessed / and that other lived three days after.
Claudius poeta was this time. Arcadius and Honorius reigned.xxx. year And in
their time Rome was almoost destroyed by a king called Alaticus / of the
which destruccyon rose a great blas phemy of the Romans. For they said they
fared never well sythen Christ came to Rome / and bereued the^ their gods by
the prechynge of Peter and Paul. And yet this Archadius subdued all his
enemies by y^ power of god / and shed no blood Against this blasphemy saint
Austyn made y^ solemn work y^ which they call. de ciuitate dei. Honorius
was emperor with Theodosius his broders sone xv. year / and he was a man of holy
life / for two wives he had / and with both yet he dyed maiden. He loved
specially the church / and hated heretykes. Ierom dyed this time at Bethleem
the year of his age.lxxxxj. Sanctus Herachydes that wrote Vitas patru^ to
Lansum ep^m was this time. Ioh^es Crisostomus was exiled of Eudochia ye wife of
Arcadij / and through hete of the son he dyed. Anastasius was pope after
Siritius three year. This man ordained that every man should stand at ye redyng
of ye holy gospel / and that he that was a maimed man should not be priest.
Innoce^tius was pope after Anastasius. This man ordained that seek men should
be enoynted with holy oil. And at mass ye kiss of peace to be given. He
dampened Pelagien an heretyke. And many other things he did. vt patet.xxvj. q.j.

Anno Christi.CCCC.xiiij.
AFter Innoce^tius zozimus was pope two year and.viij. months. This man
ordained that clerks should be no tauerners / ne sell no wine / and that a
bond man should not be made priest without y^ license of his lord. Bonifa cius
a Romayn was pope after zozimus four year. This man ordained y^ a woman should
not touch y^ pall of y^ awter ne should not wasshe y^ awter. Celestinus a
Romayn was pope after Bonifacius.viij. year and.ix. days / y^ which ordained
the psalm before mass Iudica me deus. etc. And at the begy^nynge of y^ mass
should be said a verse of a psalm and that y^ Grayle and the offertory should
be said before the sakerynge. This man sent saint Patryk in to Irlonde to
convert that land. And Palladius a deken of Rome to the Scotts to be
converted. And in the fourth year of this man there was a general Synody at
Ephisina of CCC. bishops against Nestorium an heretyke. Theodosius y^ younger
with Valentinian his neuewe reigned.xxvij. year. In his time was y^ leest
ordained which is called Adui^cula sancti Petri. And in his time dyed saint
Austyn / in y^ year of his age.lxxvj. And this time were the.vij. slepers
raised / the which slepte.CC. year. This man dyed at Co^stantynople / and
there was buried. This time the saxons entered in to England / and anon by
little and little they grew up mightily / and at the last they obtained all
the land. Sixtus a Romain was pope after Celestinus.viij. year. This was a
holy man and a meke. And little of him is written / but y^ he builded sancta
Maria mayor. Leo Tuscus a confessor was pope after Sixtus. This man was as
holy as any man. Five times on a day or more he would say mass. And on a time
after it befell when a certain woman kyssed his hand he was tempted with her /
and for the trespace that he had done / to his penance he made his hand to be
stryken of. And when y^ noise ^ose upon him that he might not say mass as he
was wont to do / he was right sorry / and all only betoke him in prayer to our
lady to help him. And our lady restored him his hand again / and than he
said mass as he was wont to do / and so that miracle was openly showed to all
people. And in y^ time of this pope Marcyan the Emperor being there was
congregate at Calcedony y^ fourth universal synody of. vj.C. and.xxx. bishops

negauerunt in Christo vera^ carne^ fuisse^et etia^ negabant carnis nr^e
resurrectione^. And after he had made many notable sermons and epystles he
decessed. Marcianus and Vale^tinianus were emperors this time.vij. year / in
whose time was the great Synody before rehearsed when Eustice^ and Dioscorus were
co^demp^rd.

IN the time that Marcianus was emperor of Rome Vortiger was king of Britayn
now called England in whose time y^ saxons came in to Bry tayn and made many
kings / y^ is to say as is plain by the Chronicles.vij. And because it is
tedyous to man's reason to rehearse many diverse names together as.vij. kings of
England / and in one time / the emperors and popes. Therefore the chronicles of
England shall be set together / till it be comen unto Alured / in whose time
the Danes came in to England. And the popes and y^ emperors and other things
in the same time shall be set together.

Circa annu^ d(...).CCCC.xlix.
How the wardeyns that had y^ chysdren to keep y^ were king Co^stantynes sons
ladde them to little Brytayne / for the treason and fals^es of Vortiger.

Here begins the fyfth part during to the coming of the Danes. Engist.

THis time came the saxons that were pagans first in to Britayn now called
England / under Vortiger y^ which was crowned king of this land. This time
those that had these two children in keeping the which were Co^stantynes sons /
that is to say / Aurilambros and Vter through ordinance of Gosselyn that was
bishop of London / after their faders death / that is to say Co^stantyne /
durst not dwell in this land with those children / but conuayed them unto the
king of little Brytayn / for as much as he knew the treason of Vortiger that
than was made king / through whom Constance their elder brother was slain /
wherefore y^ hundred knights of Pehytes were put to death and bare all the blame
/ as that Vortiger had not wist thereof / ne thereto consented. And so the kepers
of those two children dred lest Vortiger would put the^ to death through his
treason and falsnes as he had done their brother before / and therefore they were
ladde over in to little Brytayne / and the king them received with much honor
/ and put them to nourysshe / and there they dwelled till they became fair and
strong knights / and thought to be avenged of the death of Co^stance their
brother when they saw their time / and so they did as ye shall here tell
afterward. It was not long after that the tidings came over see to the
kynrede of the hundred knights of Pehytes y^ they were dampened and put to death
through Vortiger in this land / wherefore they were wondersly wroth / and swore
that they would be avenged of the death of their kynnesmen / and came in to
this land with a great power / and robbed and slew in many places / and did
all the sorrow that they might. When Vortiger it wist / he ma de much sorrow /
and was sore anoyed. And in another place also tydnges came to him that
Aurilambros and Vter his brother ordained and assembled a great host for to
come in to great Britayn / for to be avenged upon Vortiger for y^ death of their
brother Constance. So that on y^ one side and on the other he was brought in to
so much sorrow that he ne wist wheder to go.

How Engyst and.xj. thousand men came in to this lord / to whom Vortiger gave
a place y^ is called Thonge castle.
ANd soon after this sorrow tidings came to Vortiger that a great nauye of
strangers were arrived in y^ country of Kent / and wist not whens they were /
ne wherefore they were come^ in to this land. The king sent anon a messenger
thither / that some of them should come and speak with him for to know what folk
they were / and what they asked / and in to what country they would go. There
were two brethren masters and princes of that strong company / y^ one was
called Engist / and that other Horn. Engist went to the king and told him the
cause wherefore they were comen in to this land / and said. Sir we be of a cou^
tree y^ is called Saxony / that is y^ land of Germayne / wherein is so much
sorrow that of the people be so many that the land may not them sustain. And
y^ princes and masters of the land make to come before them men and women of
y^ bold^st y^ may best travail in to diverse lon des / and give them horse and
harneys / and al y^ them needs / and tha^ they bid them go in to an other to
(...)e where they may live as their au^ceters did before them. And therefore sir
king / if ye will have our service we will help you against your enemies.
When Vortiger herd this / he said gladly he would wtholde them upon such
covenant y^ if they might deliver his land of his enemies / he would give them
reasonable lo^des for to dwell in for ever. Engist thanked him goodly / and in
this manner he and his company.xj. M. were retained with king Vortiger / and at
the last delivered clean y^ land of his enemies. Than prayed Engist the king
of so much lord y^ he might make for him and his folk a cite. The king
answered / it was not to do without counsel of his brytons. Engist prayed him
again of as much place as he might compass with a thonge of a skyn / whereon he
might make a manner for hy^ to dwell in. And y^ king granted him freely. Than
Engist cut a bulls skyn as small as he might in to a tho^ge and therwt
compassed as much land as he might build on a fair castle / and was called
Thong castle.

How Vortiger loved Ronewen Engistes daughter / and how he spoused her.


When this castle was made and well arayd / Engist pryuely sent by lettre in
to the country where he came fro for an hundred ships filled with men that
were strong and bold and also well fyghtyng in all batayles / and that they
should also bring with them Ronewen his daughter / which was the fairest
creature that any man might se. And when those people were comen that he had
sent for / he took and ladde them in to the castle with much Joy. And
himself upon a day went unto the king / and prayed him there full worthily
that he would come and se his new manoyr that he had made in the place that he
had compassed with the thonge of the skin. The king anon freely granted him
/ and went with him thither / and was full well pleased with the castle and
with the fair week And together there they ete and drank with much joy. And
when night came that king Vortiger should go in to his chamber to take there
his nyghtes rest / Ronewen y^ was Engistes daughter came with a cup of gold in
her hand and kneled before the king and said to him wassayll. And the king
wist no^ what it was to mean ^e what he should answer thereto / for as much as
him self nor none of his brytons could speak none English nor understand it
/ but spoke in y^ same language that Britons do yet. Nevertheless a latiner
told the king the full understanding of wa^sayll / and that other should
answer drink hayll. And that was the first time that wassayll and drink
hayll came up in this land / and from that time unto this time it is well used
in all this realm of England. And when king Vortiger beheld y^ great beauty
of this fair lady Ronewen that kneled before him / he took her up and laid
both his arms about her neck / and thryes swetely kyssed her / and anon
right he was enamoured upon her / so that he desired to have her to wife / and
asked her of Engist her fader. And Engist granted him upon this covenant /
that the king should give him all ye country of Kent / that he and his people
might dwell therein. The king granted him pryuely with a good will And anon
after he spoused ye damoysell and that was much confusyon to him self. And
therefore all ye brytons became wroth because he spoused a woman of mysbyleue /
wherefore they went all from hy^ / and would do no thing yt he had to do.

How Vortimer that was Vortigers sone was made king / and Engyst driven out /
and how Vortimer was poisoned.
THis Engist went in to Kent and seized all ye land in to his hands for him
and for his men / and became within a little while of so great power / and had
so much people / that men wist not in litel time which were ye ky^ges men and
which were Engystes / wherefore the Brytons had of him dread / and said among
them / but if they ne took other counsel between them / all the land should
be destroyed through Engist and his people. Vortiger ye king had begote^ on his
first wife three sons / ye first was called Vortimer / the second Catagren /
and ye third Passent. The bryto^s by one assent chose Vortimer to be their
lord and sovereign / and crowned him king / and would not suffer Vortiger no
longer to regne / because of the alyau^ce between Engist and him. The brytons
ordained a great host for to drive out Engist and his company of ye land /
and gave him three batayles / the first was in Kent where he was lord / the
second was at Tetford / and ye third was in a shyre on this side Colchestre
in a moor. And in this battle met them Catagren and Horn Engystes brother /
so that each of them slew other. But for as much as ye country was given
long before to Horn through Vortiger wha^ he spoused his cosyn / there he
made a fair castle that is called Horn castle after his own name. Vortimer
was so sore anoyed for his broders death / that anon he let cast down ye
castle to ye earth. And after he stynted not night nor day till he had driven
out Engyst and all his people of the land. And than Ronewen his daughter made
great sorrow / and craftily spoke to them that were next to the king Vortimer
/ and pryuely entreated them / and so many gifts she gave them / that the
king was empoysoned and dyed at London the fourth year of his regne / and
there he lies.

How the britons chose an other time Vortiger to be their king / and Engist
came in to this land again / and how they fought together.
AFter Vortimers death the Brytons by their common assent made Vortiger again
their king upon this covenant / that he should never after suffer Engist nor
none of his to come again in to this land. And when all this was done /
Ronewen the queen pryuely sent by lettre to Engist that she had empoysoned
Vortimer / and that Vortiger her lord bare again the crown and reigned / and
that he should come again in to this land well arrayed with much people for to
avenge him upon the brytons / and to win this land again by might and
strength. And when Engist herd these tidings / he made great joy / and
apparayled him hastily with xv. thousand men that were boughty in every
battle / and came in to this land. And when Vortiger herd tell that Engist
was comen again with a great power in to this land / he assembled his brytons
and went to mete Engist for to give him battle. But Engist dredyng ye brytons
sore / for they had dysco^fyted hy^ before / prayed Vortiger of a love day /
and said he was not comen in to this land for to fight / but for to have his
land again / if he might accord with the bryto^s. King Vortiger through
counsel of his brytons granted him a love day. And it was ordained by the
brytons yt the love day should be holden beside Salysbury on an hill / and
Engyst should come thither with. iiij.C. knights and no moo. And ye king with as
many of ye wysest men of his land. And at yt day ye king came with his
counsel as it was ordained. But Engist had warned his knights pryuely that
each of them should put a long knyfe in his hose / and when he said fair syrs
it is time to speak of love and peace / every man anon should draw out his
knyfe and slay a bryton. And so they slew a. M. and.lxj. knights / and with
much sorrow many o^ them escaped. And ye king Vortiger there was taken and
led to Thongcastel and put in prison. And some of Engistes men would that the
king had been brent all quycke. And Vortiger than for to have his life granted
them as much as they would ask / and gave up all the land towns / castelles
/ cytees and bourghes to Engyst and his folk. And all the brytons fled thens
in to Wales / and there held them still. And Engist went through ye land and
seized all the land with frau^chises and in every place let cast down chirches
and houses of religyon / and destroyed ye chryste^ faith through out all this
land / and let change the name of ye land / yt no man of his were so hardy
after that time to call this lord Britayn / but call it Engist lord And tha^
he departed ye land to his men and made.vij. kings for to strength ye land
/ that ye brytons should never after come therein. The first kingdom was Kent /
where Engist himself reigned / and was lord and master over all the other.
The.ij. was Southsex / yt now is called Chichestre. The.iij. Westsex. The.iiij.
Eestsex. The.v. Estangyl / yt now is called Norfolk / Suffolk / Mercheme^k / yt
is to say ye erledom of Nicholl. The. v^. had Leycestre shyre / Northamton
shyre Herforde / and Huntyngdon. The.vij. had Oxforde / Glocestre / Wynchestre
/ Warwyk / and Derby shyre.

How Vortiger went in to Wales / and began there a castle yt would not stand
without mortar tempred with blood.
When Engist had departed all the land in this manner to his men / and
delivered Vortiger out of prison to go where he would / and he took his way in
to wales where his brytons dwelled / for yt land was strong and ill to win
/ and Engist never came there ^e never knew (...). Vortiger held him there with
his bryto^s and asked counsel what was best to do(...) and they gave hy^
counsel to make a strong castle / yt he might keep and defend hy^self
therein if need were. Masons in haste were fette / and began ye work upon ye
hill of Breigh. But certes thus it befel^ all ye work yt the masons made a
day ^t fe^l down ye night / and they wist not what it might be / and thereof
ye king was sore anoyed of yt chance / and wist not what to do Wherefore he
let send after ye wysest clerks and learned men that were through out wales yt
might be found / for they should him tell wherefore ye fou^dame^t so failed
under the work / and that they should him tell what was best to do. And wha^
these wise men long time had studied / they said to ye king yt he should do
seek a child borne of a woman yt never had to do with man / and that child he
should do slay / and tempre with his blood the mortar of the work / and so
should the work ever endure without end.

How ye king let seek Merlin through out all Wales for to speak with him.


When the king herd this / he commanded his messengers anon to go through
out all Wales to seek that child / if they might find him / and that they
should bring him forth with them unto him. And in record and in wytnes of
this thing he had taken them his lettres / that they ne were destroubled of no
man ne let. And than ye messengers went thens and spedde so fast / that they
came in to a town that was called Karmardyne / and as they passed forth their
way / they found two children of.xxiiij. year of age chiding together with
hasty words / and one of them said to that other. Donebat quod he / ye do all
wrong to strive with me / for ye have no wit ne no reason as I have. Certes
Merlyn quod he / of your wit ne your reason I make no forte / for men tell
comynly yt ye have no thing of god almighty / sith ye had never fader / but
every man knows well who was your mother. The messengers of king Vortiger
when they herd this strife between ye two gromes / they asked of them yt stood
beside them whens that Merlyn was borne / and also who nourysshed him. And they
told them yt a great gentylwoman of Karmardyne called Adhan was his mother /
but none knew who was his fader. When the kings messengers herd these
tydy^ges they went anon to him that was wardeyne of ye town and told him ye
kings will / and showed him his lettre / and wherefore they were comen thither.
Merlyn and his mother anon were fetched before the wardeyn of ye town / and he
commanded the^ that they should go to ye king with his messengers. Merlyn and
his mother went thens and came unto ye king / and there they were received with
much honor. And ye king asked of the lady if yt child were her sone / and
who him begat. The lady answered full tenderly weeping and said she never had
company of man worldly But sir said she / when I was a young maiden in my
faders chamber / with other of great lignage in my company / that often times
went to sport them / I left alone in my chamber and would not go forth for
bre^nynge of ye son / there came on a time a fair bacheler and entered i^ my
chamber where I was alone / but how he came in / and where / I wist it never /
ne yet know I not / for ye doors were fast barred / and with me he did game of
love. For I had no might nor power to defend me from hy^. And often he came to
me in ye fore said manner / so yt he begat this child / but never might I wit
what he was.

Of the answer of Merlyn upon the kings castle that would not stand.
When Merlyn had herd all that his mother had said / he spoke to the king in
this manner. Sir how I was begoten ask ye no more / for it falls not to you
nor to none other to know / but tell me ye cause wherefore I am brought to you
/ and wherefore ye have sent for me. Certes quod the king / my wise cou^seylers
have done me to understand / that ye mortar of a work that I have begone
behooves to be te^pred with your blood / or the fou^dament shall fail for
evermore. Sir said Merlin / will ye slay me for my blood to tempre with your
mortar. Ye quod the king / or else shall never my castle stand / as my
cou^seylers tell me. Than answered Merlyn to the king. Sir said he / let them
come before me those wise cou^seylers / and I will preue that they say not
well ne truly. And when the wise men were comen / Merlyn asked if his blood
were the cause to make ye work stand and endure. All those wise men were
abashed and could not answer. Than said Merlyn to ye king Sir I shall tell
you the cause wherefore your work thus falls and may not stand. There is
under the mou^tayn where ye build your toure a great pond of water / and in
the bottom of ye ponde under the water there is two dragons / that one is white
and that other reed / that fight together against your work. Do ye deep mine
till your men come to the pond / and do your men take away ye water all out and
than ye shall se the dragons as I have told you / yt fight together against your
work. And this is the cause wherefore the fou^dament falls. The king anon
let dygge under till ye men came to that ponde / and let do away all ye water /
and there they found two dragons as Merlin had told them that egerly f^ught
together. The white dragon egerly assailed the reed / and laid on him so
strongly that he might not endure / but withdrewe him (...) rested in the same
cave. And when he had a while rested him / he went before the reed dragon and
assailed him angerly and held him so sore / that he might not endure against
him / but with drew him and rested. And after came again ye white dragon and
strongly fought with the reed dragon / and bote him evil and overcame him ye he
fled from thens and no more came again.

Of the significacyon of these two dragons that were in the bottom of the ponde
that fought together.
^His king Vortiger and his men ye saw this bataile had great marvel / and
prayed Merlyn to tell hy^ what it might betoken. Sir said Merlyn / I shall tell
you. The reed dragon betokens your self / and the white betokens the folk
of Saxony that first ye took and held in your land / that fought against you
/ and have driven and chaced you away But Britons of your lignage overcame
them and drove them away. And sythen at the coming again of the Sarons they
recovered this land / and held it for evermore / and drove out the bryto^s /
and did with this lord al their will and destroyed chrystendom through out
this land. Ye had first joy with their coming / but now it is turned to your
great damage and sorrow. For the two brethren of Co^stance that was king /
which ye let see shall come before a quinzeme passed with a great power from
little Brytayn / and shall avenge the death of their brother / and they shall
brenne you first with sorrow / and afterward they shall slay a great part of
saxons / and shall drive out all ye ^emenau^t of the land / and therefore abide
ye here no longer to make castle ne none other w^rke / but anon go else where
to save your life. To god I you betake / troth I have said to you of things
yt shall be fall. And understand ye well that Aurilam bros shall be king /
but he shall be poisoned / and little time shall he regne.

Of king Aurilambros / and how he pursued Vortiger and Eugist / and how they
dyed.
MErlyn and his mother departed from the king / and returned again to
Karmardyne. And soon after tidings came to the Brytons that Aurilam bros and
Vter his brother were arrived at Totnes with a great host. And anon the Brytons
assembled them and went to receive Aurilambros and Vter with great noblenes /
and brought them to London / and crowned Aurilambros and made him king / and
did unto him homage. And anon he asked where as Vortiger might be found that
was king / for he would be avenged of his broders death / and after he would
war upon ye paynyms. And they told him that Vortiger was in wales / and so
they ladde him thither ward. Vortiger wist well that those brethren came to
conquer him / and fled thens into a castle that was called Gerneth / that
stood upon an hye mountain / and there held him. Aurilambros and Vter his
brother and their folk had besyeged the castle full long time / for the
castle was strong and well arrayed. So at the last they kest wild fire and
burnt houses and men and all their array and as much as was within the
castle. So that Vortiger was brent among all other / and so he dyed with
much sorrow. Than was Engist in Kent and reigned there / and herd these
tidings / anon he fled and would have gone in to Scotlonde for to have had
socoure. But Aurilambros and his folk met with him in the north country /
and gave him battle. And Engist and his men defended them whiles yt they might
/ but he and his folk were dyscomfited and slain. And Otta his sone fled
unto york. And Aurilambros followed him egerly. And Otta with stood him a
little while / but afterward he put him to his mercy. And Aurilabros received
him / and to him and to his men gave the country of Galeway in Scotlonde / and
there they dwelled. After that the king Aurilambros went through out the land
/ and put away the name of Engyst land / that Engyst after his name had
called it before. Than he let call it again great Brytayne / and let make
again chirches and houses of relygyon / castelles / cytees / and borowes and
towns that the Saxous had destroyed / and came to London / and did do make the
walls of the cite / which Engist and his folk had cast down. The Brytons
ladde him to the mount of Ambrian where sometime was an house of relygyon which
than was destroyed through ye paynyms / whereof a knight that was called Ambry
that sometime was fou^der of that house / and therefore the hill was called the
mount of Ambryan. And after it was called Ambesbury / and shall be so for
evermore.

How Aurilambros did redress the land of great Brytayne / which was
destroyed through the Saxons.
HOw the king Aurilambros let amend and redress the house of Ambesbury / and
put there in monks / but now there be Nonnes / alytell from the place that was
called Salysbury / or where as the Saxons slew the Britons / where as Engist
and the Britons should have made a love day / in yt which time there were
slain a thousand and.lxj. knights through treason of Engist. The king
thereof had great pity / and thought to make in mind of them a monument of
stone that might endure to the worlds end. And of this thing they took their
counseyle what thereof was best to do. Than spoke to ye king the bishop of
London that was called Ternekyn yt he should inquire after Mer lyn / for he
could best tell how this thing might best be made. And Merlyn after was sought
and found / and came to ye king. And the king told him his will of the
monument yt he would have made. Merlyn answered to ye king and said. There ben
great stones in Irlond and long upon the hill of Kian yt ben called gyau^tes
ka roll / and if they were in this place as they be there / they would endure
for evermore in remembrance of those knights that here be buried. Perma foy
said ye king as hard stones ben in my lord as in Ir lord. Soth said Merlyn /
but in all your land there be none such. For gyauntes set them for great good
of themself. For at every time yt they were wounded or in any manner hurt /
they washed ye stones with hot water / and tha^ they washed them therewith /
and anon they were hole.

How the Brytons went for to seek the great stones in Irlonde.
ANd wha^ these Brito^s had herd of this thing they went and swore among them
that they would goo seek those stones / and took with them Vter the ky^ges
brother to be their chief capitayn and.v. M. me^ / and Merlin cou^seyled them
for to go unto Irlonde / and so they did. And when the king of Irlonde yt was
called Guillomer herd tell ye strangers were arrived in his land / he
assembled a great power / and fought against them / but he and his folk were
disco^fyted. The Brytons went before till they came to the mount of Kylian /
and clymmed up unto the mount. But when they saw the stones / and the manner
how they stood / they had great marvel / and said between themself that no
man should them remeue for no strength ne engyne so great they were and so
long. But Merlin through his craft he remeued them / and brought them in to
their ships and came again in to this land. And Merlin set ye stones where
the king would have them / and set them in the same manner that they stood in
Irlonde. And when ye king saw yt it was made / he thanked Merlin and rich ly
him rewarded at his own will / and let call ye place Stonehenge for evermore.

How Passent yt was Vortigers sone and king Guillomer came in to this land and
how a traitor that was called Cappa empoysoned ye king Aurilambros.
ANd men shall understand ye Passent yt was Vortigers sone lived the same time
/ and came in to this land with a great power / and arrived in ye north country /
and would be aue^ged of his faders death Vortiger / and strongly trusted upon ye
com pany that he had brought with him out of the land of Germany / and had
conquered all ye North country unto York. And wha^ king Aurilambros herd this
he assem bled a great power of britons and went for to fight with Passent / and
he discomfyted Passent and al his people. But Passent escaped thens with some
of his men and fled thens in to Irlo^de and came to king Guillomer / and
prayed him of help and socour. The king granted him with good will / and said
yt he would help him upon that covenant that I my self must go with you with
all my power in to Brytayne / and I would me avenge upon the Brytons the rather
/ for they came in to my land / and took ye stones with strength that is
called gyau^tes karoll. The king Guillomer let ordeyne his ships and went to
the sea with.xv. (...). men / and arrived in wales / and began to rob and did
much sorrow. It befell so that king Aurilambros lay feke at Wynchestre / and
might not help himself. So that he sent in his name Vter his brother with a
power to help wales / and thyderwarde he went as much as he might. The king
of Irlonde and Passent had herd tell that Aurilambros was seek / and to them
there came a sarasyn yt was called Coppa / and said. Sir dwell ye here all in
peace with your host / and I behyght you through my queyntyse yt I shall slay the
king Aurilambros that is seek. Than said Passent / if ye do so I shall rychely
aua^i^e you. This traitor Coppa put upon him an habyte of relygyon / and let
shave him a broad crown / and came unto the kings court / and said that he
would help ye king of his malady. Than said the traitor Coppa unto ye king.
Sir be of good conforte / for I shall give you such a medycyne yt ye shall
sweet anon right and list to sleep and have good rest. And ye traitor gave
him such poison to sleep / that anon right in his slepyng he dyed / and the
traitor said yt he would go out in to ye field till he were awaked And so
escaped he away / for no man had to him suspeccyon for because of his ha byte
that he was clothed in / and also for his broad shaven crown. But when the
kings men wist yt he was deed / they became wonders sorry / and fast sought the
traitor / but they might not find hy^. For that traitor returned again unto
the host fro whens he came.

When Aurilambros was deed / a sterre on ye morrow was seen with a clear light /
and at yt bought of the beme was seen the heed of an horrible dragon.
When the king Aurila^bros was thus deed and empoisoned at wyn chestre / on ye
morrow after that he was deed about the time of pryme there was seen a sterre
great and clear / and ye beme of ye sterre was bryghter than the soune / and at
the bought of the beme appe red a dragons heed / and out of his mouth came two
huge lyghtes that were as bright as any fire brennynge / and the one beme
toward france and straight over the sea thyderwarde / and out of ye beme came
vij. bemes full clear and long as it were ye light fire. This sterre was seen
of many a man / but none of them wist what it betokened. Vter that was king
Auri lambros brother yt was in Wales with his host of Brytons saw that sterre
/ and the great light that it gave / he wondered thereof greatly what it might
betoken / and let call Merlyn / and prayed him for to tell what it might
betoken.

Of the betokenynge of the sterre.
MErlyn saw that sterre and beheld it long time / and sythen he quoke and
wept tenderly / and said. Alas alas that so noble a king and so worthy is
deed. And I do you to understand that Aurila^bros your brother is empoysoned
and that I se well in this sterre / and your self is betokened by the heed of
the dragon that is seen at the bought of ye beme that is your self that shall
be king and regne. And by ye beme yt stands toward the eest is understand
that ye shall get a sone that shall conquer all France / and all the lands
yt belongs to the crown of france / that shall be a worthyer king and of
more honor than ever was any of his aunceters. And by the beme that stretches
toward Irlonde is betokened that ye shall have a daughter that shall be queen
of Irlonde. And the.vij. bemes betoken that ye shall have.vij. sons / and
every one of them shall be king / and shall regne with much honor. And abide
ye no longer here / but go and give battle to your enemies / and fight with them
boldly / for ye shall overcome them and have ye victo ry. Vter thanked Merlyn
hertely / and took his men and went toward his enemies / and they fought
together mortally / and so he discomfyted his enemies and destroyed them / and
himself slew Passent yt was Vortigers sone. And his Britons slew Guillomer
that was king of Irlonde and all his men. And Vter anon after ye battle took
his way toward Wynthestre for to do bury king Aurila^bros that was his
brother. But tha^ was the body borne to Stonehenge with much honor / that he
had do make in remem brau^ce of the Brytons that there were slain through
treason of Engyst / that same day that they should have been accorded / and in
ye same place they buried Aurylambros / the second year of his regne with all
the worship that might belong unto such a king. On Whose soul god have
mercy. Amen.

Of Vter pendragon / and wherefore he was called so ye shall here. And how he
was overtaken with the love of Igreyne yt was the earls wife of Cornewayle.
AFter the death of Aurilambros Vter his brother was crowned and reigned
worthily. And i remembrance of the dragon that he was likened to / he let make
two dragons through counsel of his Britons / and made that one for to be
borne before him wha^ he went in to ba tail / and that other for to abide at
Wynchestre in the bishops church. And for that cause he was called ever after
Vter pendragon. And Otta yt was Engistes sone commended Vter but little that
was made new king / and against him began to move war / and ordained a great
company of his friends / and of his kynne / and of Ossa his brother / and had
taken all ye land from Humber unto York. But those of York held strongly
against them / and would not suffer them to come in to ye cite neither to yield
ye cite to them / and he besyeged the town anon right / and gave thereto a
strong assaute / but they of yt cite kept them well and strongly. And when
Vter herd thereof / he came thither with a great power for to help and rescow the
cite / and put away the syege and gave a strong battle / and Otta and his
company defended them as well as they might. But at ye last they were
disco^fyted / and the most part of them slain / and Otta and Ossa were taken
and put in prison at Lon don. And Vter himself dwelled a while at York / and
after he went to Land. And at Eester after he would bear crown / and hold a
solem^ne feast / and let somon all his earls and barons / that they should come
to that feast / and all those that had wives should bring them also to ye
^eest. And all came at the kings commandment as they were commanded. The
feast was rychely arrayed and holden / and all worthily set to meet after that
they were of estate So yt the earl Gorloys of Corn wayle and Igreyne his wife
sat next to ye king And when the king saw the fayrnes of that lady that
she had / anon he was rauysshed for her beauty / and ofre he made to her nyce
countenance in lokynge and laughing. So at the last the earl perceived the
preuy lokynge and laughing and the love between them / and rose up from ye
table in wrath / and took his wife / and called to him his knights / and went
thens all in wrath without taking leave of the king. The king anon sent after
him that he should come again and go not thens in despyte of hy^. And ye earl
would not come again in no manner of wise. Wherefore the king was full wroth /
and in wrath him defied as his deedly cu^my. And ye earl went thens in to
Cornewayle with his wife in to the castle of Tyntagell. And the king let
ordeyne a great host and came in to Cornewayle for to destroy the earl if he
might. But he had put him in y^ strong castle of Tyn tagell yt was well
arrayed / and would not yield him to ye king. And ye king anon besyeged the
castle / and there dwelled.xv. days and might not speed / and ever thought
upon Igreyne / and upon her laid so much love / that he wist not what to do.
So at y^ last he called to him a knight yt was called Vlfin that was preuy with
him / and told hy^ all his counsel / and asked of him what was best to do.
Sir said he / send after Merlyn anon / for he can tell you the best counsel
of any man living. Merlyn anon was sent after and came to ye king. And the
king told him all his counsel and his will. Sir said Merlyn / I shall do so
much through ye craft that I can / that I shall make you come to night in ye
castle of Tyntagell / and shall have all your will of that lady.

How king Vter begat on Igreyne that was the earls wife of Cornewayle Arthur
king.
MErlyn through craft yt he could changed y^ kings figure in to the lykenes
of the earl / and Vlfin Garloys his chamberleyn in to ye figure of Jordan that
was y^ earls chamberleyn / so y^ each of them was tra^sfigured to others
lykenes. And when Merlin had so done he said to the king. Sir said he / now
may ye go suddenly to ye castle of Tyntagell / and ask enter there and have
your will. The king took pryuely all ye host to govern and led to a knight
that he much loved / and took his way toward the castle / and with him took
Vlfyn his chamberlayne and Merlyn. And when they came thither / y^ porter wend
it had been his own lord. And wha^ time came for to go to bed / y^ king went
to bed with Igreyne the earls wife / and did with her all his will / and
begat upon her a sone which was called Arthur. And on the morrow ye king took
his leave of ye lady and went again to his host. And the same night that the
king lay by Igreyne in bed yt was the earls wife the kings men gave a
great assaute to the castle. And the earl and his men manly defended them. But
at the last it befell so that in the same assaute the earl himself was slain
and the castle taken. And the king anon returned again to Tyntagell and
spoused Igreyne with much honor and made her queen. And soon after that the
time came y^ she should be delivered and had a sone which was called Arthur.
And after that gate on her a daughter that was called Amya. And when she was of
age a noble baron that was called Aloth y^ was lord of Leons wedded her. When
Vter long time had reigned there came upon hy^ a great sekenes as it were a
sorrow. And in the mean time those that had in keeping Otta that was Engistes
sone and Ossa his brother that than were in prison / they let them goo for great
gifts that they gave / and went with them. And when these two brethren were
escaped and came again in to their own country they ordained a great power
of folk / and began to war again upon the king.

How king Vter chose Aloth to keep the land of Brytayne while yt he was seek
/ for as much as he might not for his sekenes.
ANd for as much as king Vter was seek and might not help hy^ self / he
ordained Aloth sone of Eleyne that than was chosen for to be wardeyn and
^heftayne of all his folk. And so he anon and his Brytons assembled a great
host / and gave battle to Otta and to his folk / but Otta at the last was
discomfyted. It be fell thus after ward that these brytons had indignacyon of
Aloth and would not be to him attendau^t / where fore y^ king was wonders fore
anoyed and let put him in a lyttet is the host among his folk. And they
ladde him to Vero^oin that than was a fair cite / where as saint Albon was
martyred / and after was that cite destroyed with paynyms and through war /
and thither they had sent Otta and Ossa and their people and entered in to ye
town and let make fast the gates / and there they held them. And the king
came and besyeged them / and made a strong assaute. But they y^ were win manly
defended them. The king let ordeyn his go^nes and his engynes for to break y^
walls / and y^ walls were so strong y^ no thing might misdo the^. Otta and
his people had great despite y^ a king lyenge in a lytter had besteged them /
and took cou^ seyle to come out on ye morrow and give battle to ye king / and
in that battle Otta and Ossa were slain / and al ye other alive fled in to
Scotlonde / and made Colegrin their cheftayne. And ye saxons y^ were escaped
brought again a great strength / and said among them / if king Vter were deed
they should well co^quere ye lo^d / and thought to poison hy^ / and ordained men
to do this deed: gyuyng them great gifts / and they went thyderward in poor
me^nes wede to accomplysshe their falls purpose / but it auayled not / for they
might not come nygh y^ king. Till at ye last they espied that ye king dra^ke
none other ly^our but water of a clear well y^ was nigh beside and these
traitors on a day privily went to ye well and put therein poison so yt all the
water was poisoned / and anon after a^ the king had dronken of y^ water / he
began to swell / and soon after dyed / and as many as drank of y^ water dyed
also. And anon as this was espied / folk of the town let stop y^ well for
evermore. Wha^ the king was deed / his folk bare hy^ to Stonehenge with great
solempnite of bishops and barons y^ were there to bury hy^ beside Aurilambros
his brother / and after returned again euerythone / and sent after Arthur his
sone: and they made him king of the land with much reverence after his faders
death.xvij. year of his regne.

How Arthur yt was the sone of Vte^ was crowned after his faders death / and
how he drove out of this land Coleg(...) and the saxons / and Cheldrik of
Aimayne.


When Arthur was made king of the land he was but young of.xv. year of age /
but he was fair and bold and doughty of body / and to meke folk he was good
and curteys and large of spending / and made him wondersly well beloved among
all men where it was need. And wha^ he began to regne he swear that the saxons
never show have peace ne test till he had driven them out of the land / and
assembled a great host and fought with Colegrin / the which after the time y^
Otta was deed the saxons maynteyned. And this Colegrin was disco^fyted and
fled unto york and took the cite / and there held him. And ye king
besyeged him there / but he gate no thing / it was so strong / and y^ cite
defended it manly. In y^ mean time Cole grin left y^ cite to Bladud and fled
himself to Cheldrik that was king of Almayne for to have socour of him. And he
assembled a great power and arrived in scotlond with.v.C. ships. And when
Arthur wist of these tidings / and saw he had not folk enough to fight with
Cheldrik / he left ye syege and went to London / and sent anon lettres to
Howell of little Brytayn his neuewe his systers sone / yt he should come to him
with all ye power yt he might. And he assembled a great host and arrived at
southampton / where king Arthur received him Ioyously with much honor. And
those two hosts met and assembled them / and took their way to Nichol that
Cheldrik had besyeged / but it was not taken. And they came upon Cheldrik and
his people or they wist where that they were / and assailed the^ egerly. King
Cheldrik and his men defended them manly to their power. But king Arthur and
his men slew so many saxons y^ never was seen such slaughter. And Cheldrik and
his men yt were left alive fled away / and king Arthur pursued them and drove
the^ out in to a wode yt they might no ferder pass. Cheldrik and his me^ saw
well that they were brought in to great disease / and yielded them to king
Arthur in this manner wise / that he should take their horses and harneys and all
yt they had / and they would only go on foot in to their ships / and so they
would go home in to their own lord and never come again in to this land. And
upon assurau^ce of this thing they gave him good host ages. And Arthur by
counseyle of his men granted this thing / and received the hostages / and
thereupon ye saxons went to their ships. And when they were in the hye see the
wind changed as ye devil it would and they turned their navy and came again
in to this land and arrived at Cotnes / and went out of the shypp(...) and
took the loud / and clean robbed it / and slew much people / and took all
the armure that they might find / and so they went forth till they came unto
Bathe. But the men of y^ town shette fast their gates / and would not suffer
them to come within the town / and they defended them well and manly against
them.

How king Arthur gave battle unto the sarons when they came again in to this
land / and had besyeged the town of Bathe / and overcame them.
When king Arthur herd these tidings / he anon let hang the hostages / and
left Howell of Brytayn his neuewe for to keep the march to ward Scotlond
with half his people / and himself went to help and rescowe ye town of
Bathe. When he came thither he gave a strong battle to Cheldrik / and slew
almoost all ye people yt he had. For no man might wtstande him ne endure under
ye stroke of his sword / and there were slain both Colegrin and Bladud his
brother / and Cheldrik fled thens and would have gone to his ships. But when
king Arthur wist it / he took.x. M. knights to Cador that was earl of
Cornewayle for to let and stop his passage. And Arthur himself went toward y^
march of scot land / for messengers told him that the scotts had besyeged
Howell of Britayn there as he^ay seek / and therefore he hasted him thyderwarde.
And Cador pursued after Cheldrik / and took him or he might come to his ships
/ and slew him and his people. When Cador had done this viage / he hasted him
again toward Arthur as fast as he might / and found him in Scotlonde / where
he had rescowed Howell of Brytayne. But the Scotts were far within Mountef /
and there they held them a while / but Arthur pursued them / and they fled
thens in to Limoigne / there were in that country.lx. yles / and great plente
of birds and Egles y^ were wont to cry and fight together and make great noise
when folk came to rob that land / and warn as much as they might / and so
they did / for the Scotts were so great rauenours / that they took all that
they might find in the land of Limoigne without any sparynge / and therewith
charged again the folk for to go in to Scotlonde.

How king Arthur asked of Merlyn the adventures of.vj. of the last kings that
were to regne in England / and how the land should end.
SIr said Merlyn / in y^ year of the incarnacyon of Jesus Christ. M.CC.xv. shall
come a lamb out of Wynthestre that shall have a white tongue and true lyppes /
and he shall have written in his heart holiness. This lamb shall make many gods
houses / and he shall have peace ye most part of his life / and he shall make
one of ye fairest places of ye world that in his time shall not fully be made
an end of. And in the end of his life a wolf of a strange land shall do
hy^ much harm and sorrow through war / but at ye la^be shall be master
through help of a reed fox that shall come out of the north west / and shall
overcome him / and the wolf shall dye in water. And after that time the lamb
shall live no while but shall dye. His seed shall be in a strange land. And the
land shall be without a governor a little time.

ANd after this time shall come a dragon meddled with mercy and also with
woodnes / and he shall have a berde as a got / that shall give in England a
shadow / and shall kep^ the land from cold and hete / and his one foot shall
be set in wyke / and that other in London / and he shall embrace in habytacyons
And he shall open his mouth toward wales / and the trembling of the hydour of
his mouth his eeres shall stretche toward many haby^acyons and countrees and
his breath shall be full sweet in strange land. And in his time shall the
ryuers run blood and with brain. And he shall make in places of his land
walls that shall do much harm unto his seed after his time. And than shall
there come a people out of the Northwest during his regne / that shall be
ladde through a wicked hare / that the dragon shall do crown king / that
afterward shall flee over the sea / without coming again for dread of ye
dragon. And in that time the son shall be as reed as blood that men shall se
through out all the world / that shall betoken great pestylence and death of
folk / through dynt of sword and that people shall be faderles till y^ time
that ye dragon dye through an hare that shall m^ue war against him unto the
end of his life / that shall not fully be ended in his time. This dragon shall
behold in his time the best body of the world / and he shall dye beside the
marches of a strange land / and the land shall dwell faderles without a good
governor / and men shall weep for his death from the isle of Shepey unto the
haven of Mar^yl / wherefore alas shall be their song of faderlesse folk / that
shall over live in his land destroyed.

ANd after this dragon shall come a got out of Kar that shall have horns and
a berde of silver / and there shall come out of his nosethrilles a domp that
shall betoken hungre and sorrow and great death of the people. And much of his
land in y^ beginning of his regne shall be wasted. This got shall go over in
to France / and shall open y^ flower of his life and death. In his time there
shall arise an Egle in Cornewayle that shall have feathers of gold / that of
pride shall be with out pere of the land / and he shall despise lords of blood.
And after he shall flee shamefully by a bear at Gauerscch. And after shall be
made brydges of men upon y^ costs of the sea / and stones shall fall from
castelles / and many other towns shall be made plain. In this time shall seem
yt the bear shall brenne / and a battle shall be done upon y^ arms of y^ see
in a field ordained as a shield / and at that battle shall dye many white hedes
/ wherefore this battle shall be called y^ white battle. And the foresaid bear
shall do this got much harm / and it shall come out of the south west and of
his blood. Than shall the got lose much of his land / till y^ time that
shendshyp shall overcome hy^. And than shall he clothe him in a lions skyn and
than shall he win that he had lost and more thereto. For a people shall come
out of the northwest y^ shall make the got so sore aferde yt he shall be in
great perplexite And he shall avenge hy^ on his enemies by the counseyle of two
owls that first shall be in peril for to be undone. But y^ old owl shall go
away a certain time and after he shall come again in to this lord. These two
owls shall do great harm to many one / and so they shall counsel y^ got to
arere war against y^ foresaid bear. And at the last the got and y^ owls
shall come at Burton upon Trent / and shall go over / and for dread the bear
shall flee and a swan with him fro his company to Burton toward y^ north / and
there they shall be with an hard shoure / and tha^ shall the swanne be taken and
slain with sorrow / and y^ bear taken and heded next unto his nest y^ shall
stand upon a broken bridge / on whom the son shall cast his bemes / and many
shall him seek for virtue that shall come from him. In the same shall dye for
sorrow and care a people of his land / so that many lands shall be upon him
y^ more bolder afterward. And those two owls shall do much harm to y^
soresayd flower of life / and shall led her in to dystresse / so that she
shall pass over the sea in to france for to make peace between y^ got and the
flourdelyce / and there she shall dwell till a time that her seed shall come
and seche her / and they shall be still till a time that they shall clothe them
with grace / and they shall seche y^ owls and put them to despytous death. And
after shall this got be brought to disease and anguysshe / and in sorrow shall
he live all his life.

AFter this got shall come out of wyndsore a bore that shall have an heed of a
white lions heart / and piteous lokynge. His vysage shall be rest to seek men.
His breast shall be stau^chy^g of thurst to y^ thursty. his word shall be gospel.
his herynge shall be meke as a lamb. In y^ first year of his regne he shall
have great pain to iustyfye them that be untrue. And in his time shall his
lord be multyplyed with aliau^tes. And this bore through fyersnes of his heart /
shall make wolves to become lambs. And he shall be called through out the
world / the bore of holiness / of fyersnes / of noblenes / and of mekenes. And
he shall do mesurably all that he shall do unto y^ bourgh of Jerusalem And he
shall whette his tethe upon the gates of Paris / and upon four lands Spayn
shall tremble for dread. Gascoyn shall sweet. In France he shall put his
wynge. His great tail shall rest in England softly. Almayne shall quake for
dread of him. This bore shall give mantels to two towns of England / and shall
make the river ren with blood and brain / and he shall make many meadows reed /
and shall get as much as his auncesters did / and or he dye he shall bear
three crowns / and he shall put a land in to great subieccyon / and after it
shall be recovered / but not in his time. This bore after he is deed for his
dough tynes shall be buried at Coleyn / and his land shall than be replete of
all good.

AFter this bore shall come a lamb having feet of leed / and an heed of brass
and a heart of a loppe / a swynes skyn and an hard. And in his time his land
shall be in peace ye first year of his regne He shall do make a cite yt all ye
world shall speak of. This lamb shall lose through a wolf a great part of his
land / but he shall recover it / and give a lordshyp to an egle of his land /
and this egle shall well govern it till pride shall overcome him / alas y^
sorrow / for he shall dye of his broders sword. And after shall ye land fall
to the foresaid lamb / yt shall rule ye lord in peace all his life / and after
he shall dye / and the land shall be fulfilled with all goods.

AFter this la^be shall come a mold warpe / cursed of gods mouth / a caytyf / a
coward / an hare. He shall have an elderly skyn as a got / and vengeance shall
fall upon him for sin. The first year of his regne he shall have of al good
great plente in his land / and shall have great praysyng in his land till y^
time y^ he shall suffer his people live i^to much pride without chastysynge /
wherefore god will be wroth. Tha^ shall arise up a dragon of the north that shall
be full fyers / and shall meue war against y^ moldwarpe gyuynge him battle on
a stone. This dragon shall gadre in his company a wolf coming out of the west
to meue war against the moldwarp in his syege / and so shall y^ dragon and he
bind their tails to gyder. Than shall come a lion out of It land yt shall
fall in company with them / and than shall tremble ye land yt shall be called
england as an aspen lefe / and in y^ time shall castles be kest down upon
Tamyse And it shall seem y^ Seuerne shall be dry for the deed bodies that shall
fall therein The.iiij. chief flodes in England shall ren in blood / and great
dread shall be and anguysshe yt shall arise. After ye moldwarp shall flee and ye
dragon. The lion and ye wolf shall drive them away / and the land shall be
without them. And the moldwarp shall have no manner of power / save only a ship
whereto he may go. And after yt he shall give ye third part of his land to
have the fourth part in rest and peace / and after he shall live in sorrow all
his life time. And in his time ye hot baths shall become cold. And after yt
shall the moldwarp dye auenturously and sodemly / alas for sorrow / for he
shall be drowned in a flode of the sea. His seed shall become faderles in
stran^ge lands for evermore and than shall the land be departed in to three
parts / yt is to say / to the wolf / to ye dragon / and to ye lion. And so
shall it be for ever more. And than shall this land be called the land of
conquest. And so shall ye tyght heirs of England end. This same time that
Merlin told to king Arthur of those kings / Guillomer of Irlonde ordained a
great power of Irysshmen and arrived in Scotlonde fast by where as king Arthur
lay with his host.

How king Arthur fought with Guillomer and overcame him. And how ye scotts
became his men.


When Guillomer that was king of Irlonde herd tydinges that king Arthur was
entered at Glastenbury / he ordained a great power of Irysshmen and came to y^
see with them / and so came in to scotlond over y^ see / and arrived fast by
there as king Arthur was with his host. And anon as he wist thereof / he went
toward him and gave hy^ battle and overcame him. And Guillomer fled with his
men again in to Irlonde. And wha^ this was done / Arthur returned again in to
y^ place where he had left y^ scotts and would have slain them all. But y^
bishops / abbots and other folk of y^ country and ladies open heded come
before king Arthur and cried hy^ mercy / saying. Gentyl king as ye are a
mayntayner of christe^dom / have pite on us your even chryste^ / for by our
death ye get no worship / as to slay chryste^ folk / and therefore have mercy
on us / for we have had much sorrow by the Saxons y^ have passed through our
country / but y^ is not enough to you / for they have taken our castles and
slain out beestes and eten / and much harm have done us / and if ye slay us
cryenge you mercy / it should be great dishonor to you. For ye have done
enough to us / and have ouercome^ us / and for gods love suffer us to live
and have mercy on chryste^ people y^ believe in Christ as ye do. When king
Arthur herd this sorrow / he had pite on them / and gave them life and lymme
without any more harm / and they fell down to his feet and thanked him / and
became his lyege men / and he took of them homage. And after y^ king Arthur
turned again with his host and came to york / and there abode during y^ vyage.
And than gave he al Logres to Aloth yt had spoused his sister / and plente of
other gifts. Tha^ was Gawen his cosyn but yo^ge of age. To al his men y^ had
served him in his war he gave rich gifts thanking them of their good
service.

How king Arthur spoused Gueneuer y^ earls cosyn of Cornewayle / and after he
conquered all Irlonde.
When king Arthur had brought his land in peace and rest and in good state /
and all was well in every country. Tha^ took he and wedded a wife y^ was
called Gueneuer / and made her queen / a fair lady and a gentyl / y^ Cador y^
earl of Cornewayle had nourysshed in his chamber yt was his cosyn. But never
they had children together / and nevertheless king Arthur loved her full well.
And anon as winter was past / he let assemble a great host and all his barons
/ and said that he would go in to Irlonde for to conquer y^ land. And he
tarried not long y^ he ne passed over in to Irlo^de. And Guillomer y^ king let
assemble a great host / and gave battle to king Arthur. But Guillomer was
disco^fyted and yielded him to the king and became his man / and to him did
feaute and homage / and of him held all that land fro that time forward. And
after passed king Arthur ferthermore and conquered Gutlonde and Islonde / and
took homage of y^ folk of the land / and there dwelled.xij. year in peace /
and reigned with joy and mirth / and there warred no man nor woman upon him.
And he became so curteys and large and honorable / that the emperors court
of Rome / ne none other through out all y^ world was not accounted to king
Arthur y^ any man wist of / nor none so well praised. And therefore y^ best
knights of all manner lands came unto him there for to dwell. And he received
them with good will and reverence. And all the knights were so good that no man
knew the werst. And therefore king Arthur made a round table / that when they
should sit at their meet / all should be like hye and euenly served at the
table / yt none of them should make vaunt that one were hyer than an other. And
king Arthur had at that table brytons and frenshmen / norma^s and flemynges /
bur gonyons / mausers and lotherins / and of all the lands on this half the
mount Gorye and of his land of great Brytayne / and of Cornewayle / of Wales /
and of Irlonde / and of Scotlond / and shortly to tell of all the lands that
would worship cheualrye such came to king Arthurs court.

How king Arthur went in to france and conquered the land of Froll that was a
Romayne / and how he slew him.
Since it befell that king Arthur through counsel of his barons and lords
would go to conquer all France that than was called Galle through Romans
that than held y^ land in their power and in their governance. And y^
Romans had taken that land to a noble knight and a worthy of body that was
called Froll. And when he wist y^ king Arthur came / he ordained an host of a
great power / and fought with the king / And he and his folk were dyscomfyted
/ and fled unto Paris and entered the cite / and closed the gates / and there
held him. Wha^ Arthur wist that Froll was gone to Paris / he pursued after and
came thither and besyeged him. But the cite was strong and well arrayed / and
they that were therein defended them well and manly. King Arthur dwelled there
more than a month / and there was so much people in the cite y^ they
dispended all their vytayles y^ they had wtin: and so great hunger became
among them y^ they dyed wonders thycke within y^ cite for hunger / and came
unto Froll / and prayed him to be accorded with king Arthur for to have peace and
they would yield them unto him and the cite also. Froll saw that he might no
longer hold the cite against their will and trusted greatly upon his own
strength and sent to king Arthur y^ he should come fight with him body for body
/ and so should they depart france between them two. King Arthur anon
granted it / and (...) not that none of his people undertook y^ battle for
him. And on y^ ^^orow both came well arrayed without Paris / where as they should
fight. And anon together they smote so fyersly / and so well they fought on
both sides / y^ no man could deem the better of them. And so it befell that
Froll gave Arthur such a stroke y^ he kneled to the ground wheder he would or
not / and as Froll withdrewe his (...)erde he wounded king Arthur in the
foreheed that y^ blood fell down by his eyes and his face. Arthur anon sterte
up egerly wha^ he felt himself hurt as a man y^ seemed almoost wood / and he
took Tabourne his good sword and drew it up on high / and gave Froll such a
stroke y^ therewith he claue his heed down to y^ sholders / so y^ his heline
might not be his warent / and so he fell down deed in ye place. And than they
of ye cite made great sorrow for Froll And euerychone yielded them unto king
Arthur / and the town also / and became his men / and did to hy^ homage and
feaute. And he received them / and took of them good hostages. And king Arthur
after that went forth with his host and co^^uered Angeo and Angiers / Gascoin /
Poytou / Nauerne and Burgoyn / Berry / Lotherin / Turin / and Poytiers / and
all ye other lands of france he conquered holly. And wha^ he had all
conquered and taken homage and feaute / he ^^turned again to Paris / and there
dwelled he long time / and ordained peace long time over all ye country and
through out all france. And when peace was made over all through his noble
knyghthode yt he had / and also for his own worthynes. And no man were he never
so great a lord durst not meue war against him neither to arise to make the
land of france vnquyete. And in peace he dwelled there ix. year / and did many
great wonders / and re proved many proud men and ill tyrau^tes (...) chastised
them after their deseruyng.

How king Arthur auaunted all his men that had trauayled in his service.
And afterward it befell thus at eester there as he held a feast at Paris /
and rychely he began to auau^ce his knights for their service that they had
helped him in his conquest. He gave to his steward yt was called Kay Angeo and
Ang^ers / and to Bedeler his butler he gave Normandy that was called Neustrie
And to Holdyn his chamberlayn he gave Flaundres and Mance / and to Dorell his
cosyn he gave Boloyne / and to Rychard his neuewe he gave Pountyf / and to all
other he gave large lands and fees after they were of estate. And when Arthur
had thus feffed his knights / at Apryl next after following he came again in
to Britayn his own land / and after at whytsontyde next following by
counseyle of his barons he wol^ be crowned king of Glomergon / and hel^e a
solemn feast / and let somon knights / earls / and barons / that they should
come thither euerychone / and there was Scater king of scotlo^de / Cadwere king
of southwales Guillomer king of Northwales / Maded king of Irlonde / Malgamus
king of Gutlonde / Achilles king of Islonde / Aloth king of Denmark / Gonewas
king of Norway / and Hell his cosyn king of Dorkeney / Cador king of little
Brytayne / Morwith earl of Cornewayle / Mauran earl of Glocestre / Guerdon earl
of winchestre / Bo^l earl of Harford / Vrtegy earl of oxford / Cursal earl of
Bathe Jonas earl of Chestre / Enerall earl of Dorchestre / Kymare earl of
Salysbury Waloth earl of Caunterbury / Iugerne earl of Chichestre / Arall earl
of Leicestre and ye earl of Warwyk / and many other moo rich lords. Brytons
there came moo / that is to say Dippon / Donaud / Ge^nes and many other yt be
not named here were at that feast / and many a fair feast king Arthur had
holde^ before / but never none such / ne none so solemn / and that lasted
xv. days with much honor and mirth.

Of the lettre that was sent from Rome for pride to king Arthur.
THe third day as king Arthur sat at his meet among his kings / and among
them that sat at ye fee^^ before them came in.xij. men of age rychely arrayed /
and curteysly they salewed the king / and said they came from Rome sent as
messengers fro the emperor / and took to him a lettre yt thus much was to
understand. Gretely us meruayleth Arthur that y^ art ones so hardy with the
eyes in thy heed to make open war and contake against us of Rome / yt owe all
ye world to deem / for y^ have never yet before this time proved ne assayed
the strength of ye Romans / and therefore thou it shall in a little time. For
Julius caesar conquered all ye land of Brytayn / and took thereof truage / and
our folk have it long had / and now through thy pride y^ withholdest it /
wherefore we of Rome command ye that y^ yield it again. And yet have thou
done more folly / that y^ have slain Froll yt was our baron of France with
wrong / and therefore all ye comyns of Rome warns the and commands the
upon life and lym^e / that y^ in haste be at Rome for to make amends of thy
misdeeds that thou have done. And it be so that y^ come not / we shall pass ye
hill of Joy with strength / and we shall seek ye where ever y^ may be found
/ and thou shalt not have a foot of land of thyn own / yt we ne shall
destroy it / and afterward with thy body we shall do our will. When this lettre
was red / and al men it herd / they were anoyed all yt were at yt solemn
feast / and the Brytons would have slain the messengers / but ye king would not
suffer them / and said that ye messengers should have no harm and may by reason
none deserve / but commanded them to be worshipfully served. And after meet
took counsel of ky^ges / earls and barons what answer he might give again to
the messengers. And they cou^seyled him yt he should assemble a great power of
all the lands of which he had lordship / and manly avenge hy^ on ye emperor
of ye despyte yt he had sent hy^ such a lettre / and they swore by god and by
his na^es yt they should pursue him and brenne as much as they might / and
said ye they would neu^^ fail king Arthur / and had rather to be deed. And
they let write a lettre to send to the emperor by ye same messengers in this
manner of wise.

Of the bold answer that king Arthur sent to the emperor of Rome and to the
Romans.
^Nderstande among you of Rome that I am king Arthur of Brytayne / and freely
it hold and shall hold / And at Rome hastily I will be / not to give truage /
but for to ask truage. For Co^stantyne that was Eleyns sone that was emperor
of Rome / and of all the honor that thereto belongs. And Ma^imyan king
conquered all France and Almayne / and passed mount Joy / and conquered all
Lombardy / and these two were mine au^cesters / and that they held and had I
shall have through gods will.

Of the reverence that king Arthur did to the emperors messengers.
When this lettre was made and (...)sealed / king Arthur unto th^se messengers
gave great gifts / And after that ye messengers took their leave and went^
thens and came to the cour^^ of Rome again / and told the emperor how
worthily they were received and also of the ryal company that he had for to
serve him / and how he was more ^y ally served than the emperor of Rome or any
other king living in ye world. And when the emperor had ouers^en the lettre
/ and had herd what was therein and saw that Arthur would not be ^uled after
him / he let assemble and ordeyne a great host for to destroy king Arthur if
that he might. And king Arthur as touching his power and party ordained his
power and knights of the round table.

Of the kings and lords that came for to help king Arthur against the
emperor.
^He king of Scotlond / of Irlond of Gutlonde / of Denmark / and of Almayne /
each of them had.x. M. me^ / the duke of Normandy / Gascoyn / Flau^dres /
Poytou / and of Boloyne / each had four thousand. Gerin of Chartres had x.
thousand. Howell of brytayn had.xij. thousand / and himself of his own land
xij. thousand. And of arbalastres and of archers and of other folk on foot /
that no man could nombre them. And when all were ready for to go / king Arthur
took his land and Gueneuer his wife to keep to one of his neuewes that was a
wise knight and a hardy which was called Mordred / but he was not all true /
as ye shall here afterward. King Arthur took all his realm to this Mordred /
save only the crown. And after yt king Arthur took his host and went to
South hamton where that the ships were brought and the folk assembled / and
they went unto the sea / and had wind and weder at will. And as soon as they
might they arrived at Ha^^^et / and as shortly as they could they went a land
out of their ships / and spradde over all the country.

How king Arthur fought with a gyau^t in Spain that was called Dinabus yt slew
Eleyue that was king Howels cosyn of little Brytayne.
BYnge Arthur had not dwelled in the country but a little time that men told
him that there was comen a great gyaunte in to Spain / and had rauysshed fair
Eleyne that was cosyn unto Howell of little Brytayn / and had brought her upon
an hill that is called the mount of saint Bernarde / and there was no man in
that country so bold nor so hardy that durst fight with him / ne come nigh the
place where as the gyau^t dwelled that was called Dinabus / and much sorrow he
did in that country. When king Arthur herd these tidings / he called to him
Kay and Bedewere and commanded them for to go pryuely and espy where the
gyaunt might be found. And they came to ye ryuage there as men should go to
the mount that was all enclosed about with water / and yet is and ever shall
be. And they saw a brennynge fire upon ye hill. And there was also an other
hill nigh that / and there was upon that an other fire bre^nynge. Kay and
Bedewere came to the next hill / and found a wydowe open heded / sitting
beside a tomb sore weeping / and made great sorrow / and often she said Eleyn
Eleyn And Kay and Bedewere asked what she was / and wherefore she made so much
sorrow / and who lay in that tomb. O said she / what sorrow and mysauenture
fair lords seek ye here / for if ye gyaunt may find you here / he will slay
you anon. Be still good wife said they / thereof dismay you not / but tell us
the sothe why that thou make so much sorrow and weeping. Syrs said she / for
a damoysell that I nourysshed with my breasts that was called Eleyn / that was
cosyn to Howell of Brytayn. And here lies ye body in this tomb which to me
was taken to nourysshe. And so there came a devil a gyaunt and rauysshed her /
and me also / and ladde us both with him away. And he would have forlayn that
maid that was so young and tender of age / but she might not suffer it / so
great and so huge as the gyau^t was. And for certain if he come now as he is
wont to do / he will you now both ^lee / and there fore go ye hens. Than spoke
these two messengers and said to her / wherefore go ye not from hens. Certes
syrs said she when that Eleyn was deed / the gya^^ made me to abide to do and
haunte his will / (...) I must it (...) suffer / and god it w^teth I do it not
with my will / for I had ^euer to be deed than to deal with him so much pain
and sorrow I have when he me forlyeth. When Kay and Bedewere had herd all yt
this woman told them they returned again and came to king Arthur / and told
him all yt they had seen and herd. Arthur anon took them both with him and
went pryuely by night that none of his host wist / and came on ye morrow erly
to ye gyau^t and faught with him strongly / and at ye last slew him. And Arthur
^ad Bedewere to smite of his heed and bring it in to the host to show it for
a wonder / for it was so great and huge. When they came again to ye host /
they told wherefore they had be^ out / and showed to them the heed. And every
man was glad and joyful of the worthy deed yt king Arthur had done that was
their lord. And Howell was full sorrowful for his cosyn that was so lost. And
after ward when he had space he let make a fair chapel of our lady over
Eleyns tomb.

How king Arthur gave battle to the emperor / in ye which battle the
emperor was slain.
ARthur and his people had tidings that ye emperor had assembled a great
power / as well of sarasyns as of paynyms and christen men / whereof the no^bre
was.lxxx. M. horse men / with footmen. Arthur and his people ordained fast
forth in their way toward ye empe rour and passed Normandy and France unto
Burgoyn / and would have gone to ye host For men told him that the emperors
host would come to Lucie. The emperor and his host in ye beginning of
August remeued from Rome / and came forth right the way toward ye host. Than
came king Arthurs espyes and said / if yt Arthur would he should find the
emperor there fast by / but they said that ye emperor had so great power with
him of kings of the land of paynyms / and also christen people / that it were
but folly to king Arthur to mete with them. For ye spies told that the emperor
had five or six men against one of his. King Arthur was bold and hardy / and
for no thing him dysmayed and said. Go we boldly in gods name against the
Romans that with them led sarasyns and paynyms / that have no manner trust in
god / but only upon their strength. Go we now and seek them sharply in ye name
of almighty god / and slay we ye paynyms and christen men yt be against us with
them for to destroy christen men / and god shall help us to overcome them /
for we have the right opinion / and therefore have we trust in god / and do we
so that ye enemies that be to chrystendom and to god may be destroyed and
ouercomen / and that men may record the worthynes of knyghthode. Wha^ king
Arthur had thus said / they cried all with an hye voice. God yt is fader almighty
worshypped be thy name without end. ame^. And grant us grace well for to do /
and to destroy our enemies that be against chrystendome. In the name of ye
fader / the sone / and ye holy ghost. ame^. And god give him never grace n^
worship in the world / ne mercy of him to have / that this day shall feynt
well for to smite and egerly. And so they rode softly and ordained their wings
well and wisely The emperor herd t^ll that king Arthur and his folk were ready
apparaylled for to fight with him / and how they were coming / he let ordeyue
his wings in the best manner yt he coud / and more trusted in his strength than
in almighty god / and that was seen afterward. For when ye two hosts met /
the emperor lost. iiij of his men against ou^ of Arthurs / and so many were
slain what on ye one party and what on that other / that it was great pity to
wit and behold. In this battle were slain through king Arthurs.v. kings of
the paynyms and of other wonders much people. And king Arthurs men fought so
well that the Romans and paynyms had no more strength to with stand them
than.xx. sheep against.v. wolves. And so it befell yt in this battle in the
shoure that was wonders hard and long during on that one side and on that
other / the emperor among them there was slain / but there was no man that
wist for very sothe who him slew.

How king Arthur let bury his lords and knights that he had lost in ye
battle and how he sent the emperors body to Rome that there was slain in
battle.
When the romans wist that the emperor was deed / they for soke the field /
and the paynyms also And king Arthur chaced after them till it was night / and
so many of them slew that it was wonder to tell. And wha^ it was night king
Arthur turned again and thanked god of his victory. And on the morrow he let
look and search all the field for his knights yt he there lost / that is to
say Borel earl of maunt / Bedewer and kay / and Ligiers earl of Boloyn /
Vrgety earl of Baar / Aloth earl of Wynchestre / Cursael earl of Chestre / and
Holden earl of Flau^dres. These were ye great lords that king Arthur lost in
yt battle with other worthy knights among them. And some he let bury in
abbays by the country / some he let be borne into their own country. And the
emperors body he let take and put upon a bear / and sent it to Rome / and sent
to say the Romans that for Brytayn and France which he held / other truage
would he none pay. And if they asked him any other truages / right such
truage he would tham pay king Arthur let here kay to kenen his own castle /
and there buried him. And Ligier was borne to Boloyn where he was lord. And
Holden was borne in to Flau^dres / and there was buried. And all the other he
let bury with much honor in abbays and in houses of relygyon in the country
there they were slain. And king Arthur himself soiourned that same year in
Burgoyne with his host / and thought yt same year folowyuge to pass the mount
of Joy / and to have gone to Rome for to take the cite / and to have put the
Romans in subieccyon / but the wicked tyrant Mordred let him / as after ye
shall here.

How the traitor Mordred to whom king Arthur took his lord to kept and his
castles / and he held them against him.
When king Arthur had taken to Mordred his realm to keep / and was gone
against the emperor of Rome / and was passed ye see / Mordred anon took
homage and feaute of all them yt were in this land / and would have had the
lord to his own use / and took castles all about and let them be arrayed. And
after this faisnes he did an other great wrong / for against the law of
thrystendom he took his own uncles wife as a traitor and ordained him a great
host agayust king Arthurs coming / to hold ye land against him with strength
for evermore / and to slay king Arthur if he might / and sent by see and by
land / and let assemble paynyms and christen people. And he sent to saxons and
to danes for to help him And also Mordred sent to Cheldrik to do men come to
hy^ out of saxon / that was a worthy duke / and promised him if that he brought
with him much people he would gra^^^e him in heritage for ever more all the
land from beyond Humber to scotlonde / and all the land that Engist had of
Vortygers gyste when that he spoused his doughtcr. And Cheldrik came with a great
strength and power of people And Mordred had assembled also on his half / that
they had.xl. M. of strong knights when that they had need.

How king Arthur chaced yt traitor Mordred / and how he was slain / and king
Arthur Wounded to death.
THese tidings came to king Arthur where as he was in Burguyn / and was thereof
sore anoyed / and took all France to Howell for to keep with half of his men /
and prayed him to keep it till he came again / for he hyselfe would go into
Britayn / and avenge him on the false traitor Mordred / and went his way and
came to whytsand / and took shyppyng with his men / and a great host of
frenshmen / and arrived at Sandwyche. But or that he might come to land with his
people / Mordred was come with all his power / and gave a strong battle / so yt
king Arthur lost many a man or he might come to land For there was Gawayne his
neuewe slain and Augnissell yt held Scotlonde / and many other / whereof king
Arthur was full sorry. But after yt they were comen to lord / Mordred might not
against them endure / but was disco^fyted and fled thens the same night with his
men / and on the morrow came to London / but men of ye cite would not let hy^
enter / and from thens fled to wynehestre / and there held him with his people.
King Arthur let take ye body of Gawayn his cosyn / and ye body of Augnissel /
and let yt one be borne to scotlond / and that other to Pouer and buried. And
after king Arthur took his way to destroy Mordred / and he fled thens into
Corn Wayle. And the queen Gueneuer yt was king Arthurs wife yt tha^ soiourned
at york herd that Mordred was fled thens / and yt he might not endure against
king Arthur / she was sore aferde and had great doubt / and wist not what was
best to do For she wist well yt her lord king Arthur would never of her have
mercy for the great shame yt she had done hy^ / and took her way pryuely
with.iiij. men and no mo / and came to Karlyon / and there she dwelled all her
life / and was never seen among folk. King Arthur wist that Mordred was
fled in to Cornewayle / and let send after his men in to Scotlond and
Northu^berlonde unto Number / and let assemble folk without nombre and went unto
Cornewayle to seek Mordred. And Mordred had assembled to hy^ all yt folk of
Cornewayle without no^bre / and wist yt Arthur was coming / and had lever to
dye and take his chance than longer to flee / and abode and gave an hard
battle to king Arthur and his people: so yt there escaped none away on live
save king Arthur and other that were wounded to death / for Mordred was slain
and all his people / and all king Arthurs noble knights of ye round table /
whereof it was great pity. And king Arthurs made him to be borne in a lytter to
Auyon to be heled of his wounds. And yet ye Brytons suppose yt he lives in an
other land / and that he shall come yet and conquer all Brytayn. But cer^es
this is ye prophecy of Merlyn. He said his death should be doubtous / and he
said troth. For thereof yet men have doubt / and shall have for evermore as men
say. For me^ wot not whether that he is on live or deed. Arthur was borne to
Auyon the. xxii year of his regne / after the incarnacyon of our lord Jesu
Christ.v. C.xlvi. year.

How king Arthur delivered the realm unto Constantyne the sone of Cador his
neuewe.


When king Arthur wist that he might regne no longer / he let come before hy^
Co^stantyne that was Cadors sone earl of Cornewayl his cosyn / and to him
betoke all his realm bidding him to be king thereof till that he came again
/ for as much as he had none heir begoten of his body / and great harm it
was / that so noble a king and so doughty as he was had no child of his body
begote^. But all thing that god will have done / must be done / whose name be
blyssed without end. ame^.

How Constantyne slew Mordreds two sons that warred upon him.
THis Constantyne was a noble and a worthy knight of body. And yt two sons
that Mordred had begoten had great envy unto Constantyne that than was crowned
king. And so it befell yt they began to meue war against him / and assembled
a great host of them that were before with Mordred / and had been driven away
/ which did much sorrow through out all the land. That one brother ordained
hy^ to go to London for to take the cite / and that other went to wynchestre.
But Constantyne came to London and slew him that was there And after he went
to wynch estre^ and sleme him that was there also. And so was he quyte of both
his enemies. When Co^stantyne had regued well and worthily four year he dyed /
and lies at London.

Of king Adclbryghe and of king Edell.
AFter king Constantynes death there were two kings in Brytayne / that one was
called Adtlbryght that was a Dane / and he held the country of Norfolk and
Suffolk. That other hight Edell and was a bryton / and he held Nicholl /
Lyndesey / and all the land unto Number. These two kings fast warred together
/ but they were after accorded / and loved together as they had been borne of one
body. The king Edell had a sister that was called Orewenne / and he gave her
through great frendshyp to king Adelbryght to wife. And king Adelbryght
begat upon her a daughter that was called Argentyl. And yt third year after
came upon him a strange sekenes that needs he must dye. And he sent to king
Edell his brother in law that he should come and speak with him / and he came
to him with a good will. Than prayed he the king and coniured him also in the
name of god / that after when he were deed / he should take his daughter
Argentyll and the land / and keep and nourysshe her in his chamber. And when
she were of age that he should mary her to the strongest and worthyest man that
he might find / and than he should yield up her land again. King Edell
granted it / and by oath confermed his prayer. And wha^ Adelbright was deed
and buried / Edell took yt damoysell Argentyll / and nourysshen her in his
chamber / and she became as fair as any might be.

How king Edell married the damoysell to a knave of his kerhym.
THis king Edell that was uncle to Argent yet / bet hought how he might falsely
have ye land from his nece / and falsely against his oath to deceive ye
damoysell / and to mary her to a knave of his kechin yt was called Curan / and
he became the worthyest and strongest man of body yt any man wist in any land
living / and to him he thought shamefully to have married her for to have had
her land afterward / but he was deceived. For this Curan was Haueloks sone yt
was king of kyrklane in De^marke / and this Curan to^quered his wives land
afterward / and slew king Edel yt was his wives uncle and had all her land /
as in an other place it tells more openly: and he reigned but three year / for
saxons and danes slew him / and yt was great harm to all Brytayn / and the
brytons bare him to Stonehenge / and there buried him honorably.

Of king Conan yt was Curans cousin.
AFter this Curan reigned Conan his cosyn / a proud knight / and he reigned
without love / and ever was medlyng with his people / and took his uncle with war
sleynge his two children. The Saxons warred against hy^ oftentimes / but he
overcame them / and so he was in peace all his lyftyme / and he reigned.xiiij.
year / and after he dyed and lies at London.

Of king Cortyf and Gurmond yt came through the paynyms in to Brytayne.
AFter this Conan reigned his cosyn Cortyf / yt was behated of all his people /
and this Cortyf lost all britayn through war / and in his time fell yt great
myschefe in brytayn yt thryste^dom was destroyed / and all ye brytons were
wyuen out of ye land / but afterward left (...) to the saxons / as afterward
ye shall here For in that time there was a paynym that was called Gurmond ye
ky^ges sone Daufrikes of ye paynyms folk / and should have been king after his
fader / but he gave it to his brother / and said he would be no king till he had
conquered a realm in a strange country. And of him prophe cyed Merlyn /
calling him a wolf of ye see. And he let assemble paynyms without nomrbe and
ships. And going by ye see he conquered diverse lands / taking he mage of
many. And he came in Irionde and conquered it / that ofte^tymes warred upon
brytons / and brytons upon them / and often won and often lost / and gave
hostages to brytons. And so they sent to Gurmond there as he was in Irlonde /
yt he should come and help them against yt brytons / and they would gladly make
him their lord. For he was a paynim / and they were paynyms / and the brytons
were christen. When Gurmond herd this / he hasted him and arrived in scotlonde
/ and came in to Northumberlond where as the saxons were dwelling / and they
co^fermed yt couenau^tes between them made by oaths and hostages / for to bear
him true faith / and hold him forlorde / and pay to hy^ truage by year. Than
began yt saxons and the affricans to destroy / rob and brenne to wnes / and
destroyed all manner thing / sparyng neither man / woman / ne child / learned
nelewde / but slew all / and kest down towns / castles and chirches / and so
put yt land to great destruceyon. And as soon as they might flee they fled
thens as well poor as rich / bishops and men of religyon / great and small /
some in to little Britayn / and some in to Cornewayle / and all those that
might have ships.

How king Gurmonde drove king Cortif to chuhestre / and slew the britons and
through subtylte gate the town.


COrtyf the king fled thens in to Chichestre that than was a good cite and a
strong / and there held him.xx. days. And this Gurmond came and be syeged
it. But y^ cite was so strong y^ he might not get it by no manner of wise /
wherefore they thought by subtylte to brenne the town / they made engynes with
glewe of nets / and took pieces of tunder and fire and bound it to sparowes
feet and afterward let them flee / and they anon right flewe in to the town
there as their nestes were / in thackes and in euyssynges of houses / and the
fire began to kyndle and brent all the town. When y^ brytons saw that / they
hyed them out and fought / but anon they were slain and discomfyted / and
while the battle duted the king all in despair pryuely went in to wales / so
y^ men wist not where he became. And so was the town of Chichestre taken and
destroyed. And after Gurmond went and destroyed towns and citees that never
after were made again / as it is seen yet in this lord in many places.

How this land was called England for the name of Engist / and how many
kings were made after in this land.
When Gurmond had destroyed all the land through out / he gave y^ land to the
saxons / and anon they took it with good will. For y^ saxons long time had
desired it / for as much as they were of Engistes kynrede / that first had all
y^ land of Brytayn / and let them be called englyshmen / for because of
Engistes name. And y^ land they let call England in their language / and the
folk ben called Englyshmen / for as much as in his time it was called Engist
land when he had conquered it of Vortiger. But fro the time y^ Brute came
first in to this land it was called Britayn / and y^ folk brytons But sith y^
time y^ Gurmond conquered this land y^ saxons named it England as before is
said. And when this was done / Gurmo^d passed over in to france and there
conquered many lo^des / and destroyed all christen people where as he came. And
the saxons dwelled in this land / and began fast to enhabyte it at their own
will / and they would have made new kyn ges and lords / but they could never
assent to have only one king for to be to them attendau^t / and therefore they
made many kings in diverse shyres / as it was in Engistes time. The first
kingdom was Kent / and that other Southsex / and y^ third westsex / the fourth
Estsex / and the fyfth Northumberlo^de / the syxth Estangle / y^ is to say
Norfolk and Suffolk / and the.vij. Merchenrich / and that is y^ erledom of Ni
choll / Huntyngdon / Harford / Glo^estre / wynchestre / warwyk and Derby / and
so departed all England in to.vij. parts. And after that it befell y^ tho
kings warred often times together. And ever he y^ was strongest took him y^ was
feblest / and so it was long time that they had no king crowned among them /
nor no christen man was than among them ne christian dom neither. But were
paynyms till y^ saint Gregory was pope of Rome / that had seen children of y^
nation of England in y^ cite of Rome y^ were wonders fair creatures / and had
great will and desire to behold them / and asked of y^ merchants of whens
they were and of what nacyon. And men told him they were of England / and
english they were called / but they and all y^ people of england were paynyms
/ and byleued not on god. Alas said saint Gregory / well may they be called
english / for they have y^ visages of au^ gels / and therefore well ought they
to be christen. And for this cause saint Grego ry sent saint Austin in to
england / and.xl. good men with him that were of good life and holy men to
preche and teache / and to co^uerte the english people / and turn the^ to god
/ and y^ was in the.vj. year y^ saint Gregory had been pope of Rome / y^ is to
say / after the incarnacyon of our lord Jesus Christ v.C.lxxxv. year as y^
chronicles tells.

How saint Austyn baptized and converted king Adelbryght / and the bishops
that he made his felawes.
When saint Austin came first in to england / he arrived in the isle of Tenet /
and so passed forth and came to Caun terbury / and there soiourned. And king
Adelbryght of Kent y^ was of y^ lignage of Engist goodly received saint Austyn
and his felawes with much honor / and found them all y^ them neded. And more
over he gave them a fair place / y^ now is call led the abbey of saint Austin /
in which place helyeth himself shryned. This king Adelbryght was a good man /
and with good will herd saint Austyns pre dicacyons / and gave him leave to
preche through out al his lord of Kent to turn and co^uerte to him all y^
people that he might. It befell so afterward through gods grace / y^ in a
little time y^ king himself was converted to god / and all the people of his
land was baptized. And in y^ mean while y^ people turned them to god / saint
Austyn came to Rochestre and there preched the word of god / and the paynyms
scorned him therefore / and cast upon him reygh tails / so that all his mantell
was hanged full of those reygn tails / and for more despite they cast on hy^
the guts of reyghes and other fysshe. Wherefore y^ good man saint Austin was
sore anoyed and grieved / and prayed to god y^ all those children of y^ cite
that should be borne afterward / y^ is to say / in the cite of Rochestre might
have tails / and so they had. When the king herd of this vengeance y^ was
fallen through saint Austins prayer / he let make a house in y^ honor of
almighty god / wherein women should be delivered of their children at the brydges
end / in the which bous yet women of the cite ben delivered of child. When
saint Gregory had herd tell how the english people were turned to god and
converted / he sent unto saint Austyn his pallyon by a bishop y^ was called
Paulyn / and made him prymate and archebysshop of England and sent word that
he should ordeyne and make bysshoppes in the land. And anon as saint Austyn
had the pallyon of the dignite of the archebysshop / he made two bysshoppes of
his felawes the which came with him from Rome / of whom that one was called
Mellyte / and he held his dignite at London / and that other was called
Iustyne / and he held his dignite at Rochestre. And this bishop Mellyte than
went to preche the word of god in Essex / and there baptized the king of y^
country which was called Sicwith y^ was king Adelbryghtes to syn his systers
sone. This Iustyn went to preche in Southsex / and turned much of the people
to god / and saint Austin him self preched through out all England.

How saint Austyn went in to wales where as the Brytons were / and how they
would not be obedyent to the arche bishop of Caunterbury.
When all England was baptized and turned to god / saint Austin went in to y^
land where as the brytons were to keep them from englyssh men / that is to
say in wales / and there he found monks and abbeys / and.vij. bisshops For
the brytons destroyed always y^ chry sten people y^ saint Austyn had converted
And he said to the bisshops that he was a legate of Rome / and prymate of all
England / and that they should by all reason to him be obedyent. And they said
y^ they would not / but to y^ archebysshop of Car lion they would / they would
never for no manner thing be obedyent to y^ englyssh men. For they said /
englysshmen be our adversaries / and have driven us out of our country / and
we ben christen men and ever have been / and the englysshmen have ever be^
paynyms / save now of late that they be converted. Saint Austyn might of them
have none other answer / but said pertly that they would never meke them to
him ne to the pope of Rome. Wherefore saint Austin returned again to king
Adelbryght y^ was king of Kent and told him y^ his folk would not be to no man
obedyent / but to y^ archebysshop of Carlyon. When the king herd this / he was
sore anoyed / and said that he would destroy them / and sent to Elfryde king
of Northumberlonde y^ was his friend / y^ he should come to him with all y^ power
that he might / and he would mete him at Leycestre / and fro thens they would go
in to wales / and there destroy y^ archebysshop of Carlyon / and all those
that had refused saint Austyn.

How king Adelbryght and king Elfry de slew Brecynall y^ was a king of bry
tons that held y^ country of Leycestre.
IT befell so that there was a king of brytons that held the country of
Leycestre / and all the country about / his name was Brecynall. And this
bryton herd tell y^ those two english kings would mete there at Leycestre
for to go in to wales / he let ordeyne all the power that he had for to go
fight with these two ky^ges / but little it auayled him / for his folk were all
slain / and himself fled / and lost his lands for evermore. And these two
ky^ges Adelbryght and Elfryde dwell led a while at Leycestre / and departed the
land among them / and took homage and feaute of the folk of y^ country. And
af ter they went toward wales. And they of wales herd tell of y^ disco^fyture
that Brecmal had at Leycestre / and were won ders sore adrad of those two
kings / and took and chose among them good men and ho ly / of heremytes /
monks and priests / and of other people great plente / y^ went bare foot and
wolwarde for to have mercy of those two kings. But y^ kings were so stern
and so wicked y^ they would never speak with them / but slew them all. Alas for
sorrow / for they ne spared them no more than the wolf does the sheep / but
smote of their hedes euerichone. And so they were all martyred y^ to them came
that is to understand.v.C. and.xl. And after they went fro thens to Bangore
for to slay all those y^ they might find there of y^ brytons. And when y^
britons herd that / they assembled and ordained all their power for to fight
with them. Than was there a baron of wales whi che was called Bledrik of
Cornewayle that sometime was lord of Deenshyre / but king Adelbright had driven
hy^ out in to wales / and after there he gave them battle / and at y^ battle
was king Adelbryght slain / and Elfryde sore wounded / and forsook y^ field /
and the most part of his people slain. And king Elfryd fled in to
Northumberlond y^ was his own lord And after the people of Leycestreshyre
made with strength Cadewan y^ was Brecinals sone king of Leycestre / and he after
reigned nobly / and with great honor.

How Cadewan king of Leycestre and Elfryde king of Northumberlond were
friends. And of the debate y^ after was between Edwyn and Cadwalyn that were
both their sons.
AFter that this bataile was done the britons assembled them and went thens and
came to Leicestre / and made there Cadewan y^ was Br^^ynals sone king of
Leycestre and of all y^ country. And he took homage and feaute of all y^ folk
of the country. And after that he assembled a great host / and said he would
go in to Northumberlonde to destroy king Elfryde and slec him if he might. And
wha^ he was comen thither / friends went so between them that they accorded them
in this manner. That Elfryde should hold all y^ land from Humber unto scotlonde
and Cadewan should have all y^ land on this side Humber to y^ south. And after
that they were good friends all their life / and loved together as they had been
bre therne. And this Elfryde had a sone called Edwyn y^ held all y^ ^ond of
North^berlonde after his faders death as his fa der had hold al his life time.
And Cade wan had another sone called Cadwa^^ that held his faders land as he
(...) wha^ he was alive / and these loved as bre therne / and the love insted
between them but only two year / and after began debate between them through an
evil enuyous cosyn of Cadwalyns called Bryens / so y^ they assembled a great
host on both par ties. And at y^ last it befell y^ Cadwalyn was disco^fyted /
and Edwyn pursued him and drove him from place to place / so y^ at the lasthe
fled in to Irlo^de. And Edwyn destroyed his land / and cast down castles and
brent his manners / and departed all Cad walyns land among his friends. And
long time after came Cadwalyn again from Irlonde with a strong power / and in
plain battle slew Edwyn and all his friends / and namely them that withhelde
his lands by Edwyns gift.

How king Oswalde was slain by king Cadwalyn and Peanda. And how Oswy that
was saint Oswaldes brother reigned after him / and slew Peanda.
When Edwyn was slain Offris his sone undertook the war against Cadwalin his
uncle / so that this Offris dyed during y^ war. And after the death of Offris
reigned a gentyl christen man that much lo^ued god almygh ty / that had all y^
land of Northumberlonde by heritage y^ was called O^^ald and he was king of
all y^ land. But for as much as he was friend to Edwin and held a great
part of y^ land of Cadwa lyn. This Cadwalyn warred upon him and drove him
toward scotlonde. And when Cadwalyn saw that he would not abide / he would no
longer pursue him / but took some of his folk to Peanda his brother in law /
and prayed him to pursue after Oswald till that he were taken or slain. And
Cadwalyn returned home again. When Oswald herd y^ ^ydy^ges that Cadwalin turned
home again / he would no longer flee / but abode Peanda and gave him battle /
and Peanda was dis comfyted and fled and came again to Cadwa lyn / and said y^
would never hold a foot of land of him / but if so were y^ he would avenge
him on Oswald. Cadwalyn let assemble a great host for to fight with Oswald /
so that he and Peanda came to Northumberlonde and gave battle unto Oswald /
and in y^ same battle was Oswald slain and his heed smyttenof / and after he
was buried in y^ abbey of Bardeney / in which place god has wrought for him
many a fair miracle / both there and else where. And anon Oswy his brother
seized all the land in to his hands y^ was this Oswaldes. And the folk of
Northu^berlond loved him won ders well / and held him for their lord: But he
had men of his kynne worthy enough y^ would have departed y^ land and they
warred long together. And for as much as they were not strong enough they
came to Pcanda and prayed him of help and socour / and pmysed him of y^ land
largely upon this covenant / y^ he would govern them and help and counsel.
Peauda herd their prayer / and so spoke with king Cadwalyn / that he should
ordeyn a great host / and fast ordeyn him in to Northum berlonde for to fight
with Oswy. And Oswy was a mekeman and much loved peace and charity / and prayed
Peanda of love and peace / and profred him of gold and silver great plente. And
this Peanda was so proud y^ he would not grant him peace for no manner thing
/ but for all thing he would fight with him. So at y^ last there was set a day
of battle / and Oswy ever had trust upon god / and Peanda trusted to much
upon his pride and upon his host that he had / and together they smote egerly.
But Peanda was anon discomfyted and flayne. And this was after the incarnacion
of our savior ^esu Christ. vj.C. and.lv. year. And this Oswy reigned.xxviij.
year / and a king that was called Oswyne that was Peandaes cosyn warred upon
him / and together they fought / but Oswy had the victory of Oswyne / and was
discomfyted and slain / and lies at Cynmouth.

How king Cadwaldre y^ was Cadwalins sone reigned after his fader / and was the
last king of Brytons.
AFter y^ death of Cadwalin reigned his sone Cadwaldre well and nobly / and his
mother was y^ sister of Peanda And wha^ he had reigned.xij. year he fell in to a
great sekenes / and than was there a great discord between the lords of y^
land / that each warred upon other. And yet in that time there fell so great
derth and scarcete of corn and other vytayles in this land y^ a man might
go.iij. or.iiij. days fro town to town that he should not find to bye for
gold ne silver breed wine / ne none other vytayle / wherwt a man might live.
But only the people lived by rotes of herbs / for other living had they none
/ so much was it failed all about / fysshes / wild beestes and all other
thing / so y^ yet to this mysauenture there fell so great mortalyte and
pestilence among the people by the corrupcyon of y^ deed bodies. For they dyed
so sodeinly / both great and small lord and servant in etynge / going and
spe king / they fell down and dyed / so y^ never was herd of more sodeyn death
among the people. For he y^ went for to bury the deed body / with y^ same deed
body was buried. And so they y^ might flee fled and forsook their lands and
houses / as well for the great hunger / derth / and scarcete of corn and other
vytayle / as for y^ great mor talite and pestylence in the land / and went in
to other lands for to save theyrlyues / and left y^ land all deserte and

y^ loud was ^a^ayne of corn and all other fruytes for define of tillers / and
this misaue^ture duted.xj. year and more / y^ no man might ere ne sow.

How Cadwaldre went out of this land in to little Brytayne.
CAdwaldre saw great hunger / mortalite and pestilence / and the land all
poor / and faylynge corns and other vytayles / and his folk perisshed / and
saw also the most party of his land all wasted and void of people / he
apparayled hy^ and his folk y^ were left alive / and passed over in to little
Brytayn with a little navy unto king Aleyn y^ he much loved that was his cosyn
/ and that his fader had much loved in his time. And as they sailed in the sea
he made much lame^tacyon / and so did all those that were with him / and said.
Dedisti nos dite tanquam oues estaru^ et in gentibus dispersisti nos.

And than began Cadwaldre to complain him to his tolke pyteously / and said.
Alas said he / to us wretches and caytyues is sorrow for our great sins of
the which we would not amend us while we had space / and now repentance is
comen upon us through mysaue^ture which chaceth us out of our own realm and
propre soil / out of the which sometime Romans / Scotts / Saxons nor Danes
might not exple us. But what avails it now to us that before time diverse
times have gotten many other lands / sith it is not y^ will of god that we
abide and dwell in our own lode God that is very judge that all things
knows before they be done or made / he sees that we would not cese of our
sins / and that our enemies might not us nor our lygnage exyle fro and out of
our realm / he would that we amended us of our folyes / and that we should se
our propre defautes / and therefore has showed to us wrath / and will chastyse
us of our misdedes / sith that he does us without battle or strength of our
enemies by great co^panyes wretchedly to leave our realm and propre land.
Turn again ye Romans / turn again ye Scotts / turn again ye Saxons /
turn again ye frensshmen / now shows to you Britayn all deserte / the which
your power might never make deserte / ne yet your power has not put us now in
exde / but only the power of the king almighty whom we have often offended by
our folyes / the which we would not leave until he chastised us by his divine
power Among the words and lament acyons y^ king Calwaldre made to his folk
they arrived in little Gritayn and came to king Aleyn. And y^ king received him
with great joy / and made him to be served won ders nobly / and there he
dwelled long time after. The english people that were left alive and were
escaped y^ great hunger and mortalite lived in y^ best wife that they might:
and much people sprang and came of them. And they sent in to saxony where
they were borne to their friends for men / women / and children to restore the
citees with people and the towns that were all boyde of people / and for to
labor / travail and till the e^th. When the Saxons had herd these tidings /
they came in to this land won ders thycke in great co^panyes / and lodged
themself in the country all about where that they would / for they found no
man to with stand them ne let. And so they wexed and multyplyed greatly / and
used the customs of y^ country whereof they were comen / and the laws and the
language of their own land. And they changed y^ names of citees / towns /
castelles / and boutghes / and gave them names / and called them as they now be
called. And they held the cou^tets / the batonages / and the lordshyppes and
countrees in manner as y^ Brytons before ryme had compassed them. And among
other great companyes that came from Germayn in to this land came y^ noble
queen that was called Sexburga with men and women without nombre / and arrived
in the country of Northumberlonde / and took the land from Albion unto
Cornewayle / for her and for her folk. For there was none that might them let
/ for all was desolate and void of people / but it were a few poor Brytons
that were left on mountains and wodes vutyll that time. And fro that time
forth lost the Britons this realm for all their days / and the English
people began to regne / and departed the land between them / and they made
many kings about by diverse parts of the land as here ben devised. The first
of Westsex / the second Merchenrych / the third Estangle / the fourth kent /
and the fyfthe Southsex. All those reigned in this land after that Cadwaldre
was passed out of this land and dwelled in little Brytayn with king Aleyn his
cosyn and true friend. And when he had long dwelled there / and had knowledge
that the mortalite and pestylence was ouerpassed / and that the land was
replenysshed with alyen people / he thought to come again in to this land /
and prayed king Aleyn his cosyn of socour and help that he might be restored
again to his own propre realm and first dignite. And king Aleyn granted him
his askyng. Than did he apparayle him to take his way and vyage in to this
land. And prayed god almighty devoutly that he would make to him demonstracyon
/ if his prayer in to this land were to him pleasant or not. For against the
will of god almighty he would no thing do. When he had thus devoutly made his
prayer / a voice from heaven said to him and badde him leave that journey away in
to England / and that he should go to the pope of Rome / for it was not y^
will of almighty god that y^ Brycons should regne any more in Brytayne / nor
never recover the land unto the time that the pphecy that Merlyn said before be
fulfilled. And that should never be unto the time were comen that y^ relykes of
his body shall be brought fro Rome and translated in to Brytayne. And when the
relikes of other saints y^ have been hid for the persecucyon of the paynym
folk shall be found and openly showed / than shall they recover their lord
again / the which they have so long time lost through their deseruynge.
When Cadwaldre had herd this answer / he mer uayled greatly / and told it to
king Aleyn. Thanking Aleyn sent for the clergy of his land / and made them
to bring the stories and prophecyes that Merliu and Sybyll had said in their
prophecyes. And when he knew that the prophecy that Festom had prophesied of
the Egle and other prophecyes accorded to the divine answer y^ Cadwaldre had
herdehe cou^seyled him and right faithfully desired him to leave his people and
his navy and submytte him to the disposicyon of god / and do all that the
angel had commanded him. Than Cadwaldre called ynor his sone and yuory his
cosyn that was his systers sone / and said to them. Take said he my folk and
my navy that is here all ready / and pass in to wales / and be ye lords of
Brytons y^ no dishonor come to them by interrupeyon of y^ paynyms folk for
defaute of lords. And than he himself left his realm of Brytayne and his
folk for evermore / and took his way unto the pope of Rome Sergius / the
which worshypped him much / and so he was confessed / and took penance for
his sins. And he had not long dwelled there that he ne dyed the.xij. kalend
of May / the year of grace. b.C.lxxix.

How king Osfa was sovereign above all the kings of England / and how every
king warred upon other.
IT befell so that all the kings in that time that were in the land / as they
of Westsex / Merchenrych / Estangle / of Kent / and of Southsex / and of other
costs each warred upon other / and he y^ was most mighty took the land of
him y^ was most feblest. But there was a king among them that was called
Offa / that was saint Oswaldes brother. This Offa conquered all y^ kings of the
land / and reigned above them all. And so great was the war in every country
between kings that no man might wit how the land went. But abbottes /
pryours / and men of religyon wrote the lives and deeds of kings / how long
every of them reigned / and in what country / and in what manner every king dyed
/ and of bishops also. And thereof made great books / and let call them cro
nycles. And the good king Alured had that book in his ward. And let bring it
unto Wynchestre / and let it be fast tached to a pyller that men should it not
remeue ne bear thens / so that every man might se it and thereupon look. For
therein ben contained the lives of all y^ kings that ever were in England.

How the king of Northumberlonde Osbryght forlaye the wife of Buerne Bocard
through strength / and afterward this Buerne conquered the king with power and
strength.
ANd thus it befell in y^ same time that there was a king in Northu^ berlonde
that was called Osbryght / and soiourned at York / and this king went upon a
day in to a wode for to dysporte hy^. And when he came again / he went pryuely
in to a good man's house that was called Bucrne / and the good man of that
place was gone that time to y^ see. For oftentimes he went there to espy
thieves and robbers that ofte^tymes were wont to come in to the land to rob /
brenne / and slay. The lady that was Buer nes wife was a wonders fair woman
And the king came unto her when her husbonde was absent. Ad so she trusted none
harm unto the king / and welcomed him with much honor / and worthily served
him of all things. When the king had eten / he coke the lady by the hand and
ladde her in to a chamber and said that he would speak with her in counsel.
And made all y^ folk vor de out of the chamber / save only the lady and he.
But the lady wist not wherefore he did it / till y^ he had done all his will.
And when he had done this deed / he returned again to York / and left the
lady there sore weeping for the deed that the king had done to her. And when
he lord was comen home and saw her weep and make such sorrow and mourning /
he asked of her what she had done / and why she made such sorrow. Sir she said
/ subtylly and falsely the king Osbryght has done me shame and vylany against
my will / and told him the troth how y^ king had forlayne her with strength
/ wherefore she said she had lever be deed than live. Fair love be still said
he / for against strength feebleness is little worth / and therefore of me shall
thou never the less be loved / and namely for thou have told me y^ troth.
And yfalmyghty god grant me my life / I shall well avenge the. This Buerne
was a great man and a mighty lord / and was well belo ued / and had great
friends / and let send for the gretest lords of the land / and to them made
his complaynt of ye despyte that ye king had done to hy^ / and said y^ he
would be avenged how so ever it were. And all his friends cou^seyled him yt he
should go to york where as the king was to defye him. And Buerne ^eke his meyny
and came to the king. And when the king saw him / he called hy^ curteysly by
his name. And Buerne answered him / and to him said. Sir I you defye / and
yield up feautees / homages and lands / and as mothe as I have holden of you /
and from this time forward I will never of the no thing hold. And so he
departed fro the king without more speech or any abiding / and took leave of
his friends and went in to Denmark / and complained to the king Godryne / and
told him of the despyte that king Osbryght had done to him of his wife / and
prayed him of socour and help for to avenge him. When king Godryne of
Denmark and the Danes had herd the complaynt of this Buerne / and of the
prayer that he bad / they were wonders glad in their hertes / for as much as
they might find a cause for to go in to England for to war upon Englysshmen
/ and also for to avenge Buerne of the despyte that yt king Osbryght had done
to his wife. And for as much as Buerne was sibbe unto the king of Denmark /
they let ordeyne anon a great host of men / and let ordeyne ships for them
/ and as much as them neded to have to that viage And when all the host was
ready / the king made his two brethren chief capytaynes / that were noble
knights of body and also bold / that one was called Hungar / and that other
Hubba.

How the Danes took york / and slew king Osbryght / and soon after slew
king Elle.
ANd when all thing was ready the two brethern took leave of the king Godryne /
and went to ward the sea for to pass over into England as fast as they might
speed. Now is Buerne so well comforted / and so fast hyed him with y^ Danes /
that they be arrived in y^ north country / and came through out Holdernes and
destroyed all the coutre^ / and brent towns / and robbed folk / and slew all
that might be taken till that they came unto york. And when king Osbryght
saw them come / he took all his people that he had with him and came out of
the cite and faught with them / but no foyson he ne had against them / and much
of y^ people there were slain on both parties / and king Osbryght himself
there was slain / and the cite anon was taken and the Danes went in. And
there was also an other king in Northumberlond that Buernes friends had chosen
/ and held him for king / a man y^ was called Elle for as much as they would
not to king Osbryght be attendau^t / for the despyte that he had done to Buerne
their cosyn. It bef(...) thus y^ king Elle was gone to the wode for to dysporte
^ym / and of venysou some he had taken. And as he sat in the wode at meet he
said to a knight. We have well sped and much venyson taken. And with y^ word
came in a man and said to him. if ye so much of venyson have won / an
hundred times more ye have lost / for all this country the Danes have gotten /
and taken y^ cite of york / and against you shall it hold / y^ never ye shall
come therein / and for so much they have slain king Os^right. When king Elle
herd these words / he let assemble all y^ folk of the country / and
ordained all the power that he might have / and would have gotten the cite of
york with strength. But the Danes came out anon and gane him a strong battle
/ and slew king Elle and the most part of the people that he had brought
with him. And the same place there they were slain shall evermore be called
Elle crofte / and that place is a little from york. And than y^ Danes never
rested till they had conquered all Northumbetlonde / and in that country they
made wardryns / and went ferther in to y^ land and took Notyngham and there
they abode all y^ wyuter / doing all the sorrow that they might. And after
when somet time came / they reineued from Notyngham / and came to Nicholl and
Lyndefey / and to Holand. For no man might them withstand / so much power and
sttength they had.

How saint Edmund the king was martyred.
ANd so far had the Danes passed from country to country / and evermore
brennynge and robbynge / and destroyed all y^ they might till they came to
Tetford / and in that country they found a christen king that much loved god
and his works / that was called Edmund / and he was king of Northfolke and
South folk. This king saint Edmund ordained as much folk as he might / and
fought with the Danes / but he and his folk were discomfyted / and the king
himself was driven unto the castle of Framelyngham / and the Danes pursued
him and tame unto the same castle. And when king Edmund saw y^ the castle
might not withstand them / he came against them / with whom y^ Danes first
spoke / and anon they asked of him where king Edmund was. Now forsothe said he
/ when I was in y^ castle there was the king / and when I went out of the
castle / he went out also / and whether he shall escape or dye / at gods
will must it be. When saint Edmund had named god / by that they wist well that
it was himself. And anon Hubba and Hungat took him and said that he should
forsake god and all christen laws / as many other had done before him. And
saint Edmund said that he would not / but ta there he would suffer death for
gods love and his laws also. Than took they king Edmund and bound him to a
tree / and made their archers shote at him with arowes till y^ his body stycked
as full of arowes as an vrchen full of pryckes. But for all the pain that they
did him / he would never forsake god. And in the same turment and pain he dyed
/ and betoke his soul to almighty god. And when they saw that he was deed /
they smote of his heed. And in this manner as ye have herd was saint Edmund
martyred.

How* Hubba and Hungar took the towane of Redynge.
When saint Edmund was marry red / Hungar and Hubba departed thens with all
their Danes to Redyng And as they went thither ward they destroyed and brent
to w^^es and cyters and slew all christen people that would not forsake god /
and kest down chirches and came to Redynge and took the cownr and there held
them till that king Ed^lf of Westsex came thider with at his power for to take
y^ to wne. Than came out the Danes to give battle to king Edrif / and at that
battle was slain an ^^le of the Danes that was called Eidrak. Upon the morrow
came king Eldred and his brother Alured with a strong power and a great host.
And the King Edelf came again (that had fo(...) the day before) to that
battle. And the Danes than came out for to fight with them / and y^ battle
was wonders st^^ge For many a man was there slain / and the Danes that day
had the victory / and the king Eldred and his brother Alured y^ day were
discomfyted. But the fourth day after y^ Danes and the Englyshmen fought
together an other time upon Ekel dene / and there was slain a king of Deu mark
that was called Ra^ing / and four earls of great power. And that day the
Danes had shame / for they were driven to Engilfelde. And the.xv. day after the
Danes and the Englyshmen fought together at Rafyng / and there were y^ Englysh
men dysco^fyted. And from thens a Dane that was called Roynt went to Redyng
with his host / and destroyed all that he might take. And king Eldred fought
with him / but he was so wounded that he dyed. And he reigned but.v. year / and
lies at Womburne.

Circa annu^ dn^i. iiij.C.xlix.
LEo the first was emperor after Marcianus.xvij. year. In his time were y^
Rogacyon days ordained before y^ ascencyon of saint Mamert bishop of Vienne.
The pope of Rome at y^ time hight Leo a noble clerk / and with him had many
clerks. Hilarious was pope after Leo.vij. year. This man ordained y^ no bishop
should ordeyne his successory. Vt pz.viij. ^x. (...). Simplicius was pope after
him. He ordained that no clerk should take no garment to be clo thed in / after
the sect or manner of a lay man / through the reason of his office or of his
benefyce. zeno was emperor after Leo.xv. year / and this man was an heretyke
and cruel against christen men. And in this man's days y^ bodies of saint
Matthew y^ evangelist / and saint Bar nabe y^ apostle were found / and with
them the gospel that saint Mathewe wrote. About this time there was a certain
common woman bart.vij. children at one birth / of y^ which one was after made
king of Lombardy. Felix the third was pope after Simplicius three year and
viij. months. This man ordained y^ respyte should be given to a man that was
accused / that he might auyse him how he should auswere. And y^ the judges and
y^ accusers should be such / and y^ they should take all suspeccion and
spotte. Gelasius a Romayn was pope after Felix.v. year This man ordained y^
canon of y^ mass with the preface / ympnes / tractes / oreysons as saint Ambrose
made them / and y^ ordres should be given four times in the year Anastasius
was emperor after zeno xxvij. year / and he was a curfed man and an heretyke /
and hateful to god and man / and he was slain with lyghtnynge. And in his time
dyed saint Patryk y^ first bishop of Irlond / in the.C. and.xxij. year of his
age / and his felawe was the abbot of Columba and saint Brigida / whom saint
Patryk made a nonne / and they were butyed in one tomb / and at diverse times /
And this is their Epytaphe. Hij tres in gelido / tumulo tumulant in vno /
Brigida / Patricius / atque Columba pius. Anastasius a Romayn was pope after
Gelasius two year and three months. He ordained that no priest for wrath ne
hate should leave of to say his divine ser uyce in the church / except the
mass / and he cursed the emperor Anastasius / for he was an heretyke. And it
is written of him / that afterward he turned for dread to the opinion of the
emperor. And he is called the second ill famed pope that is in Catholico
po^tificu^. And before him was Liberius famed in heresy.

Anno domini. iiij.C.ixxxxiiij.
SImachus was pope after hy^.xv. year / and with hy^ was ordained an other pope
y^ was called Laurencius / and between them was a great disce^cyon / and they
both put them to y^ Judgment of Theoboria y^ king. And he judged that he that
was first ordained / and that most men of the church held with / should be
pope. And Simachus preuayles / the which loved the clergy and poor men / and
for Pascalius the deken cardynall held against Simachus with the part of Lau
rence to his death / therefore he was put to the pains of purgatory to keep y^
baths after his death / as Gregory says in his book of Dialogues. This man
ordained that Gs^a mexcelsis should be said every sunday and feestes of
martyrs.

Nota That England was long time christen France.
CLodouius the first chryste^ king of France was this time baptized of saint
Remigio / and he had a christen woman to his wife / and she meued him many
times to y^ faith / and said he should be fortunable if he would turn / and so
he was / and never before. Hornusoa was pope after Simachus.ix. year. This man
was of great mercy and great alms unto pooremen / and he gave many orname^tes
to chirches. And he reconsyled y^ greeks y^ were cursed for their heresy.
Justinius was emperor after Anastasius.ix. year / and was a very chryste^ man.
And all that ever the emperor Anastasius had done against the church / he
revoked / and obeyed the pope Hornusoa / and calle^ again the bishops that
were exiled by his predecessors. Priscianus gra^matieus was this time. And
this year the which is the.lxxi. fro the coming of y^ saxons / began y^
kingdom of westsaxon and Cerdico was king. Johannes was pope after Hornusoa
three year and ix. months. And Theodoricus y^ king of ytaly an heretyke took
the pope with other senators / and sent them to the emperor Iustinyan /
determining that and he would not let the heretykes be in peace / he should
(...) all the christen folk in ytaly. And after he ^oke pope John and Simachu^
/ Patricisi / and Boicium the senators / and slew them in prison. But Bois
defended him by the reason of the aurtorite of y^ senators / and he sent him
to the cite of Papy for perpetual exyle / where he made the book De ^solatione
philosophy. And at the last in the country of Mediolanensis he caused Bois
throat to becutte / and so he dyed. Felix pope succeeded John.iiij. year. This
man commanded that seek men should be an^led before their death / but Christ
ordained it first. Iustinianus was Emperor xxxviij. year. This man drew the
law of the Romans / or of Ciuyll / out of almoost.ij. M. books / and.ccc. M.
verses over long and ill according in to one volum of.xij. books / and called
it Iustinyan. He made also the digestes / and divided them in to three books.
Bonifacius the second was pope after Felix two year. And little of hy^ is
written. Ioha^nes the second was pope after Bonifacius And this man had a great
strife with Justinian y^ emperor / wheder y^ Christ was of two natures or one.
The pope said he had two natures / one of god / an other of man. The emperor
said / either consent to us / or y^ shalt go to perpetual exyle. The pope
answered. I desired to come to Iustinyan the most christen emperor / but as
me seems I have found Dioclesyan y^ pursewer of christen men but certainly I
dread not thy malice / ne I ^ere not thy thretenynges. Than the empetour meked
himself and fell down to the ground / and asked mercy and absolucion.

Anno d^i.v.C. xxxiiij.
AGapitus a confess^ur was pope after John two year. This Agapitus turned
Iustinyan sully from the error of the Euticetes. This man ordained that
processyons should be done on sondayes / and than he dyed at Constan tynople.
Siluerius a martyr was pope after this man three year. He was exiled fro
christen faith / and slain by the proctour of Theodory / for he would not
restore the bishop of Athenes an heretyke to his benefyce again. Virgilius was
pope after him.xvij. year. And he entered ill in to his benefyce / but he
governed him well / and he suffered his perse cucyon pacyently / and he was
exiled fro Rome. And at y^ last after great passions of Theodora in
Constantynople dyed. Sinodus quarta Co^sta^tinopolitana contra Theodoru^ et
oe^s hereticos alios fuit isto te^pore. Ista sinodus dampnauit heresim
Theodori. qui dixit aliu^ esse deu^ veru^. et aliu^ Christu^. Et quam beata
virgo non sit dei genitrix. sed hominis tantu^. Pelagius was pope after
Virgilius four year and.x. months. This man ordained that heretykes /
scysmatykes and renegates should be punysshed by the seculer power. Johannes
the third was pope after this man.xiij. year. Of this man little is wryte^ /
but that he restored y^ chircheyerde of y^ apostles Philip and Jacob. Justinius
the second after Justinian was Emperor.xj. year. This man despised poor men
/ he robbed the senators / he was given to all covetousness / so that he made
chestes of yren for to keep his money in. Than anon he fell in to heresye /
and wexed out of his mind. And than was chosen Tyberius a good man for to
govern the co mine people. Tyberius y^ second was emperor after Justinius.vij.
year. This man was a virtuous man. He gave innumerable good to poor men / in
so much that his wife often chydde with him / and said that he kest away the
goods of the empire as stones. And he answered again and said. I trust in god
that our chestes shall never lack of money / and we put treasure in to heaven.
And upon a certain day when he went by his palace at Constantynople / he saw
in the marble paueme^t a cross graven / and thought it should not be trodden
upon / and commanded to take it up. For the cross ought to be put in the
hertes of faithful men / and there he found inestymable treasour of gold.
This man subdued Harsas / and dyed blissedly. Benedictus was pope after
John.iiij. year. This man suffered great persecucyon of hunger / pestylence and
enemies. This man brought many a thousand quarters of where from Egypt / when
Rome was besyeged by king Albanak / and almoost lost for vitayle wherefore they
wrote on his grave this epytaphe. Magnatuis monume^ta pater Benedicte reliqis:
virtutu^ titulus et de^us atque dolor. Pelagius was pope after Benedictus.v.
year. In his time Rome was besyeged by y^ loinbardes / and little he did in his
days. Mauricius was emperor after Tyberius.xxj. year. This was a very
christen man / and subdued Persas and Armenias / and in y^ latter end of his
days he dyscorded with saint Gregory / and intended to have slain hy^. And than
there appeared a man in Rome clothed in a religyous habyte holdyng a naked
sword in his hand / and cried about y^ cite in this wise. The emperor shall
be destroyed / the which the emperor herd / and he correcked himself of his
trespace / and prayed to god to withdraw his sentence from him. To whom our
lord appeared in his sleep and said. Will thou that I spare the now / or in
time to come. And he was alouer of wretches and said. Give me here my reward.
Tha^ he was emperor after many a day. And wha^ he should have correcked his
knighttes for their extorcyon y^ they did / they asked him why that he would
not pay them their wages. And so they fell at varyaunce / and chose Foca for
to be emperor / and slew hy^ and his.iij. sons. This time saint Austin came
in to England and ordained two archebysshops / that is to say / of London /
and of york / by the commandment of saint Gregory. And remember y^ many
times is made mencyon of diverse regyons and countries / that often times they
have been turned to y^ faith. For always the faith abode not in them for diverse
causes. So it is of England France / Persia / Iewry / and in this thing Rome
was preuileged / for there y^ faith of Peter never failed. Focas was emperor
after Maurici his master / whom he and other slew / and because he began ill
/ he ended naught. For in his days y^ Romans fought strongly against the
Perses / and the Romans were discomfy ted and lost many a prouynce / and at
the last he was slain of Heraclius. For as he did to other men / so was he
done to.

Anno domini.v.C. lxxxiiij.
GRegory the first a Romayn and a monk was pope after Pelagius xiij. year.
This man was called Gregorius magnus for many things that he exceded in. he
passed other men in power in riches / in virtue / in noblenes / in wysdom / in
holiness / in fame and in experience And under this man the ill things of
cursednes passed and seced / and many a noble book he wrote to y^ incomparable
profit of all holy church. He was one of y^ pryncypal doctors of all
the.iiij. doctors of the church. This man forsothe alone with sayiit Fabian
after saint Peter was chosen of god in all the ordres of y^ popes of Rome /
many things he ordained in y^ church / as is showed in his regystre. Deus in
abiutoriu^. for to be before y^ beginning of y^ hours he commanded to be
said. He renewed and made all the offices of the church in a fayrer and a more
co^ pendyous manner / the which abides yet unto this day / and it is called
Gregorianu^. And shortly to conclude on this holy man / man's tongue can not
express lightly the louynges of this man / what in wrytynges and also in
examples of virtuous deeds. Saumianus was pope after Gregory one year and.v.
months. This man ordained y^ ringyng of belles at the hours of the day. But
this man backbyted saint Gregory for his liberalite that he had to poor men /
and thought he saw saint Gregory rebuke hy^ thryse for it / and the fourth
time he lay in his bed and thought saint Gregory smote him on the heed / and he
waked and dyed anon. This was the third pope among all y^ popes y^ which is
noted to dye a dredefull death. Bonifacius y^ third was pope after
Sauimanus.viij. months He ordained y^ none but white clothes should be put on
y^ awter. Bonifacius the fourth was pope.iiij. year and.viij. months. This
man purchased of the emperor Foca that the church of saint Peter of Rome
should be y^ heed of all the chirches in y^ world. For before Constantinople was
y^ heed church. Also he ga^e license y^ the church called Panton the which
was dedycate to the honor of Neptunus and other falls gods / where christen
men many times were slain of deuyls / might be dedycate to y^ worship of all
saints in heaven. This man ordained y^ monks might use y^ office of prechynge
/ chrystenynge and co^fessyon. Heraclius was emperor after Foca xiij. year.
And in the third year of his regne / Co^^ras y^ king of Perses brent Jerusalem
and other worshypfull places. ^achary the patriarch with much other people he
took and put in captyuice. The part of the holy cross the which Cleyn left
there he took with him in to his country. But the.xij. year of Herachus Cosoras
was slain of Heraclius / and the cross was brought again / and the people
were delivered. And when Heraclius would have entered y^ cite proudly / the gates
of y^ cite by y^ power of god shette by themself / and the emperor meked hy^
to god above / and the gates opened. And tha^ was the feast of y^ exaltacyon of
y^ cross made. Deus dedit was pope after Boniface three year. This was an holy
man For on a certain day when he kyssed a lepre / anon the lepre was hole.
This time a citezin of London through y^ mocyon of Ethelbryght builded a
church of saint Peter in the west part of London / in a place y^ was called
Thorney.

Circa annu^ dn^i. vj.C.xliiij.
BOnifacius the fyfthe was pope after Deus dedit five year / the which
ordained that no man should be taken out of the chircheyerde. And little else
of him is written.

Nota Machomitum.
MAchomyte the duke of sarasyns and turks was this time. And he was the
deceyuer of all the world / a false prophet / the messenger of the devil /
the foregoer of Antechryst / the fulfyller of heresy / and of all false men the
meruaylest / of whom the dominacyon thus began. There was a certain famous
clerk at Rome and could not speed in his matters that he desired to have spedde
in / than he receded from Rome over the sea / and procured many a man to go
with him / among whom was this false Machomyte a great man of wit. And this
clerk promised him to make him duke of his country / if he would be guyded
after him. There he nourysshed a dove / and put all y^ corn that the dove ete
in to Machomytes ere / and so this dove had never no meet but in his ere. The
foresaid clerk on a day called the people and meued them to chose such a
prince as the holy ghost would show to them in form of a dove. And anon
this clerk secretly let this dove flee / the which after his old custom
came to Machomyte / and put his byll in his eere. And when the people saw this
/ anon he was chosen duke of that people. And when he was made duke of this
people of Corosame / he said y^ he was the very prophet of god. Tha^ he made a
book of his law y^ was called Alcaron. But he did it by the informacyon of
three of his masters / to whom y^ devil mynistred the auctorite and the
conning. The first master was a jew a great astronomer and a nygromancer /
the second was John de Antiochia / the third was Sergius an heretyke. And
these three made an un gracyous law and an unhappy / and what someuer was hard
of believe and tedyous to do / they left y^ out of the law / and they put that
thing in their law y^ worldly men were prone and ready to do / that is to say
/ glotony / lechery / rapyne / and such other. And also this Machomyte
ordained y^ a man should have as many wives as he might occupy and find / and
refuse them twyse or thryse or.iiij. times / and take them again. And many
meruaylous and falls things he made in his law / the which were to long to
rehearse here / but they be plain in his book of Alcaron / and ever he wrote i
his book y^ our lord spoke to Machomyte his prophet / saying on this wise or
on this. Thus by his false means he deceived y^ people. And wha^ his masters
and he had made this y^ was so delectable / he wrote it in a book with lettres
of gold / and nourysshed a camel secretly in a pryuy place / and all only with
the hands of Machomyte was always fed And there pryuely he tied this book of
the law y^ he had made about y^ camels neck / and put this camel forth on a
time in to a field a fore day / and this camel ioyed in his lyberte / for he
was never lose before. And he would suffer no man to come and touch him. And so
there was a great fame of such a camel / and all the people ran to se him /
among whom was this Machomyte. But when the camel saw him that always had
fed him / anon he ran unto him. And he had taught this camel before time to
fall down on his knees and lycke his hands And so he did before all the people.
The people tha^ cried and said / that there was a very ensample that he was the
true prophet of god. Than they prayed Machomyte to open y^ holy book with his
holy hands / the which was sent from heaven evermore to be kept. In y^ which
book is showed how the people shall worship god. And Machomyte said. This book
was written with angels hands. So by these false means he turned to his law
all the land of Perse / and all the eest imperyall against Heraclius the
emperor. And he occupied unto the end of Alexandre and Egypt / Libia /
Arabia / and Siria. Than after he enfected all Africa / and but that the grace
of god with stood him he had enfected all spain and france And many other
things he did / that were to much to write in this book.

COnstantyne the third / the sone of Heracli^ was emperor.xxvij. year. This
Constantyne was a cursed man / a great tyrant / and an heretyke false /
subtle and obyous to christen men / nor he gave no place to pope Martyn / and
he raised a great host against the Lombarbes / and there he lost the field and
fled to Rome. And honorably was received of the pope Vitellianus / and other
of the cite. And he rewarded them not like after their merytes as a prince
should have done / but used forth tyranny and heresye / wherefore at y^ last he
was slain of his own knights in a bath / y^ which would no longer suffer
his tyranny. And so he wretchedly lived / and dyed unhappily. Martinus the
first was pope after Theodoru^.vj. year. This Martinus was a very holy man /
and strongly strove for the faith of god. And when he said mass on a certain
day at the awter / there pursued him to slay him a man which was called
Spa^arius of Olymphe / and when he would have ^nytten him he was blind
suddenly. This same man called a Sinody in the cite of Rome / and he dampened
Syrum / Alexandru^ / Sergiu^ / Pyrum / and Paulu^ heretykes. Wherefore
Constantyne the emperor exiled him / and he dyed a saint Eugenius a Romayn was
pope after Martyn almoost three year / and was an holy man / but of him little
acts ben written. Vitellianus was pope after him.xiiij. year. This man made y^
song that the Romans uses / and accorded it also with y^ organes. And he
also had the grace of the emperor / the which was wroth with his
predecessors / nevertheless afterward he stood not in his co^corde. Ne
hitherto I could not find that ever the church of Rome had fully after the
death of Co^stantyne y^ mighty / the lordshyp of the cite and of other the
which he gave to the church.

Anno dn^i. vj.C. x^^iij.
Adeodatus a Romain was pope after Vi(...)s.iiij. year / and in his days was
translated the body of saint Benedicti with the body of saint Scolastice his
sister fro y^ hill of cally^ to the monastery of (...) nygh (...)relyan.
Constaneyneth fourth was emperor after his fader Constantyne the cursed man.
This Co^stantyne was a good man / and he hated heretics above all thing / the
church he repaired / and grace he reconsyled again to ye church of Rome /
and he with ye pope gadred together the syxth general sinody / in y^ which was
granted to priests of Greece to use their lefull wives / and to the priests
of the eest / for cause of great heet / but not to those of the west party by
no means for they amytted chastity in the time of saint Gregory. And every man
may aduertyse and pondre how much ye goodness of a prince is worth to the
quyete state of the church / and to the promocyon of the faith. And also the
contrary / how much the malice of a prince hurts / ye thing these two
Constantynes the fader and the sone showed openly. For in the faders days the
church never had rest / and in the sons time it was quyete. Yet nevertheless
our lord suffered the sarasyns and the vulgars to enter in this emperors land
/ yt he might not withstand them but that he made his peace with them / and
paid yearly to them a truage / so myghtely prevailed that cursed sect of
Machomyte / and after he dyed blyssedly. Nota. that there were six general
synodyes and most pryncypall / of ye which the auctorite is equal to the
gospel for the treuth of the gospel is declared by them / against ye six
pryncypall heresies / the which strongly troubled ye church / for the
subtylte of those heretykes to deceive simple men. About this time dyed saint
Cedde of Lychfel(...) the third year of his bysshopryche. Demus a Romayn was
pope after Adeodatus three year / of this man little is written. Bonifacius was
pope after him / and little of him is written / but that he lived like a priest.
Agatho ^as pope after him / and he was a very holy man. For on a day when he
kyssed a lepre / the lepre a none was made hole. Iste et de consensu principis
iussit celebrari sexta^ synodu^ apud Co^stantinopoli^ CC.lxxx. ^p^oru^ / in qua
assere^ duas naturas et duas volu^tates esse in Christo. Leo the second was
pope after Agatho.iij. year. This Leo was an holy man and suffycyently taught
in latin and greek. This man ordained that the pax should be given after Agnus
dei / and dyed a blyssed man. Benedictus the second was pope after Leo almoost
three year. This man about all things was virtuous: and his name accorded with
his deeds And in his time was a great pestyle^ce. Iustinianus the second was
emperor this time / and he was a very good man / a prudent and a large / and
he increased the empire of Rome myghtely / but he charged y^ office of ye
church ouermoche Many laws he made / and afterward he wexed not good / for
he intended to have let ye decrees of ye vj. sinody / wherefore the.x. year
of his empire he was taken of Leo the prince of Patricio and Tyberio / and they
cut of his nose and his tongue and exiled hy^ to Crisona^. Than was a great
turbacyon in ye church for strife and heretykes. And know all me^ wha^
variau^ce falls between great lords / than errors ben multiplied: for there
is no man correcketh them / therefore yt is often time preued in ye church. Than
after fell a varyau^ce between Leo and Tiberio / and Tiberio prevailed / and he
exiled Leo / and cut of his nose the third year of his regne: and reigned for
hy^ Iustinyan fled to ye sarasyns and the bulgars / y^ which restored him
again to his empire / and slew Leo and Tyberio / the which favored
heretics. Than this same Iustinyan reformed himself to ye church of god /
and had great repentance / but he venged him to cruelly on his adversaries /
so that he would have slain their Innocent children. Therefore he was slain
with his sone / of Phylyp whom he exiled.

Anno dn^i. vj.C.lxxxiiij.
IOha^nes the fyfth was pope after Benedictus one year. He was a good man / but
he decessed anon. zeno was pope after him / and he was a very holy man / for
he would not meddle with seculer matters / and in beauty he was as an angel /
quyete in virtues / and meke in soul / and very demure in language of his
religyous life. This man was chosen at the last with one accord of ye church
and lay men / but there was a great distinccyon / for ye clergy intended to
have chosen Pyers the archebisshop / and the host of lay men would have had
Theodoru^ a priest. But at ye last ye holy ghoost turned the will of all this
people unto this holy man. Sergius was pope.ix. year. This man was virtuous and
commendable in his life / and in his eleccyon was a great discord / for one
party of ye clergy chose Theodorum / and an other party Pascalem. But as our
lord would at the last they turned all to this man. This man translated the
body of saint Leo. He also found a great part of the holy cross by miracle.
And he baptized Cadwalidus the last king of Brytayn. He commanded Agnus dei
to be said or song thryse at mass / and decessed blyssedly. Nota. Saint Bid
the worshypfull priest was this time a man of great fame in England / y^
which was taken the.vij. year of his age to Benedict the abbot of Gyrwyensis
monastery to be taught / and than after to Colfrido the abbot after ye death of
Benedict. And at.xix. year of his age he was made deken of the bishop of
York. And at.xxx. year he was made priest / in the which year he began to
write. So he continued all the time of his life in that monastery / in gyuynge
his labors to writing / and for scripture to be expowned he made.lxxviij.
books the which he nombreth in y^ end of his english book. This man was
ever in labor / either in prayer or in singing daily in ye church / or to
learn / or to ^^che or to write. For the which thing men may judge by reason
that he was never at Rome / all though some say he went to Rome / yt he might
se yt his books accorded with the doctrine of ye church. But it was certain
that he was blind / and went to preche / and had a servant yt was not good /
and made hy^ to preche to a great multitude of stones / and said that they were
men / and when all his sermon was done / the stones answered and said amen. But
yt he went to Rome thryse / and found written three arres and three effes and
expowned them / it was never found in no book of auctorite. There was after ye
talking of the people such a writing on the gates of Rome RRR. FFF. And such
an exposicyon. Regna Rome Ru(...). Ferro Fla^ma et Fame. But it is certain
that Bid was desired to come to Rome by the writing of Sergius the pope unto
Colfrido his abbot. And this Bid translated the gospel of saint John in to
English tongue / and decessed blyssedly. The fame says y^ now he lies at
Deuelyn with saint Cuthberto / and there is buried with him the knowledge of the
deeds of England almoost to ye conquest. Leo the second was emperor and
little of him is written. Liberius was emperor after him. vi^. year / the
which arose against Leo and entered his kingdom / and kept him in prison as
long as he reigned. In his time Iustinyan the second y^ which in old time
was exiled to Crisona^ / openly said he would recover his empire again.
Wherefore the people of that country for ye love of Liberius were about to slay
that Iustinyan / wherefore he fled to the prince of Turcorum / and wedded his
sister / and through the help of his brother and the Bulgars he recovered his
empire / and slew Liberius and Leo the usurper of his realm. And as many
times almoost as he wyped any drop from his nose the which they kyt of / so
many times he made one of his enemies to be slain. Leo the third was pope
after Sergius two year. This man was made pope by the power of ye Romans / and
was not put in ye nombre of popes / for he ill entered / but he did none ill.
Ioha^nes the syxth a Greek was pope after him. And he was a martyr / but of
whom and wherefore y^ cause is not found in hystoryes. It is said y^ it was of
ye dukes of Lombardy / for they were enemies to ye church myghtely. Ioha^nes
the.vij. a Romayn was pope after him three year / but no thing of him is
written. Iustinianus the second was emperor again with his sone Tiberius.vj.
year. And this was he which was reued of ye empire before by Leo And wha^ this
man was restored again he took him to the right faith / and worshypped the pope
Co^stantyn / and certainly he destroyed Creson the place where he was exiled to
/ and all that dwelled in it (except children) he slew them. And he came
again an other time to have slain the Innocents / and the men of country
made them a capytayn a certain man that was called Philip an outlawe / the
which anon went to him in battle and slew him for his cruelnes against
those children. Sysinnius was pope xx. days / and than was great strife / and
he decessed / but little of him is written. Constantyn was pope after him. vij
year. This man was a very meke man and so blyssed / that of all men he was
beloved. He went over the sea to Iustinyan the emperor / and was received with
great honor / and dyed a blyssed man. Philip the second was emperor one year
/ the which fled in to Scisilia for ye host of ye Romans. And he was an
heretyke / and commanded all pictures of saints to be destroyed. Wherefore the
Romans kest away his coin / nor would not receive no money y^ had his image
or his name written upon it. Anastasius ye second after he had slain Philyp was
emperor three year. This man was a christian man / and lived well. But because
he put out Philips eyes and slew hy^ afterward / therefore Theodosius fought
against hy^ and overcame him / and than he was made a priest / and so lived
quyetly.

Anno domini. vij.C.xiiij.
O Regorius ye second was pope after Constantyn.xvij. year. This Gregory was a
chaste man / and a noble man in scripture. And about this time the popes began
to dele more temporally with ye emperors tha^ they were wont for their falsnes
and their heresy / and also for to remeue the empire fro one place to an other
as the time required. This man cursed Leo the emperor because he brent the
images of saints. This same Leo commanded Gregory the pope that he should
brenne chirches and destroy them. And the pope set no thing of his saying /
but manly commanded the contrary. And so it is openly showed / that ye
destruction of the empire of Rome was the cause of heresy. For certainly
faithful people with their prelates with one will drew unto the pope / and
constrained the emperors for to leave their tyranny and their heresies. And
this time in the eest parties of the world strongly failed the very true faith
/ for that cursed law of false Machomyte. Theodostus was emperor / and reigned
but one year / and he was a very christen man / and even as he did / so was he
done unto. For Leo deposed him and made him a priest. Leo the third with
Co^stantyn his sone was emperor.xxv. year. This Leo when he was mighty he
deposed Theodosius / and reigned for him / and was deceived by a certain
apostata / y^ which bad him that he should take and brenne all the images of
saints / wherefore he was punysshed both in battle and in pestyle^ce / and
with other infortunes. And because he was accursed of Gregory / and abode
therein three days / therefore ye pope with the common people took from him all ye
west part of his empire / co^maundynge that no man should obey him / ne socour
him / because he lived like an heretyke. Holy men said against him / and many
by him were martyred and exiled. And at the last in his mysbyleue he dyed
wretchedly. And in this man's days but that Karolus Marcellus help the
christen faith and fought manly against the sarasyns / and drove them backward
in to Spain y^ which they had subdued / else they had entered in to france And
Karolus slew three hundred thousand sarasyns and more / and of his people were
slain but.xv. thousand. Nota This man for ye contynual battle took to lay men
the treasour of the church / wherefore saint Euchery the bishop of Aurilian as
he was in his prayers saw that same Karolus in soul and body payned in hell.
And the angel that showed the bishop this man / said that y^ was the
judgment of all those yt took away the goods of ye church / or of poor
men. And to fortyfye that ye the bishop said and to prove it / the abbot of
saint Denis went to the sepulture where that Karolus was buried / and opened
the chest that he lay in / and there they saw a dragon go out / but he had no
body. Gregory the third a Romayne was pope after Gregory the second / the
which confermed the worshyppynge of the images of saints / with the counsel
almoost of a thousand bishops. And he horrybly cursed all the despysers of
these images as the emperor and other that were of that condition.
Constantinus y^ fyfth was emperor after his fader Leo. xxxv year. He was a
cursed man and a pure heretyke / so that he did sacrifyce to deuyls / he
pursued the church / and noth(...)ge that is good of him is written. And so by
the suffrau^ce of god the church was troubled long time. About this time were
many meruayles / and there were meruaylous earth quakes. And certain cytees that
were set upon mountains / they were remeued and borne away with the hills
into the feldes. v^. mile thens as they stood / and the cytees were not broken
nor hurt. In the land of Mesopotanyan the earth was broken by the space of
two mile. And also there was a mule which spoke in a man's voice. Ashes fell
from heaven. And in the sea of Pontico there was yse for great frost y^ was.xxx.
cubytes of thycknes. And sterres fell from heaven so myghtely that men trowed
that the end of the world had been comen. All these betokened meruaylous
things to come.

Anno domini. vij.C.xliiij.
AFter Gregori zacharias was pope.x. year. This zachary was a noble man / and
arrayed with all virtues / with all men he was loved for his mekenes. And he
deposed the king of France Hydery / and put in his place Pippinu^ / for he was
more profitable. Here ye may se what power y^ church had that time the which
translated that famous kingdom from the very heirs to the kingdom of Pippyn /
for a lefull cause. Vt habetur. xv. q.v. alius. Stephanus the second a Romayn
was pope after zacha ry.v. year. This man in all thing was profitable unto the
church / as well in word as in doctrine. And he governed the spirytualte and
the temporalte nobly. He was the lover and the defender of poor men. This man
anointed Pippinu^ the king of France / and sent him against the Lombardes /
that he should compel them to restore the church of such goods as they had
withholden from them long time vnryghtwysly / the which he did He also
translated the empire of the Greeks to the frenssh men. Paulus a Romayn was
pope after hy^.x. year. This was a very holy man / for he did great alms to
faderles children and prisoners / wydowes and other poor men / that he might
be a follower of saint Paul. Constantyn y^ second a Romayn was pope after Paul
two year. This Constantyn was a lay man / and suddenly was made a priest as a
tyrau^t / and took on him the dignite of the pope / and with a great sclau^dre
to the church was pope a little time. But the faithful men put him out / and
put out his eyes. And this was y^ fyfthe infamed pope among so many hitherto /
so the holy ghoost that holy apostles seet kept in all honor and holy nes.
Infynyte martyrs were made this time by Constantyn the emperor for he was
such an heretyke. And men trow that there was never emperor nor no paynym
that sleme so many martyrs. And this time y^ church was troubled full sore /
and very precyously bought the worshyppyng of y^ images of saints / for y^
great shedynge of blood of martyrs. And certainly that cursed emperor was not
unpunished. For when he dyed he cried with an horrible voice and said. I am
taken to a fire that is unable to be destroyed / and so he yielded up the ghost
to everlasting pain. The empire of Rome was divided about this time. For
Stephen y^ pope translated ytaly and other to Karolus yet a young man. And
Constantyn held the land of Greece with other lands over y^ see with a great
labor / and many rebellynge. This time Karolus magnus was a noble young man /
and he began for to regne upon France / and was the sone of Pippinus / and his
mother was called Berta. Stephanus the third was pope after Paulus three year /
and he amended all the errors of Constantyne. And he degraded all those the
which Constantyn ordained in a gouernall synody.

Anno domini. vij.C.lxxxiiij.
ADrianus a Romayn was pope after Steven.xxiiij. year. This man was myghtely
worshypped of the people / no man greter before him in honor / richesse and
building. This man set two solemn synodyes. The first of iij.C. and l.
faders. The second in Rome with an hundred and fyfty faders / being present
Charles the king of France / to whom it was granted the lyberte of eleccyon
of the pope / and to ordeyne y^ apostles seet. Leo the fourth reigned emperor
with y^ Greeks.v. year. This Leo was a cursed man / but not so much as his
fader was / and he was a covetous man / and he took away a certain crown of a
church / and put it upon his heed / and anon he was corrupted with an axes
and so decessed. And he had a cursed wife the which reigned after him with her
sone. Constantyn was emperor after Leo / and he was a meke man / and put away
his mother fro y^ kingdom / that she might take heed unto her women's work. But
she with a feigned rancour put out his eyes afterward / and his children also /
and reigned again three year. And at the last she was about to have been wedded.
And when the Greeks perceived that she would be wedded to great Karolus / they
took her and shette her up in a monastery / and took Nichoferu^ to be their
emperor. The.v. universal study y^ which in old time was translated from
Athenes to Rome about this time was translated to Paris by Karolus king of
France. Nichoferus was emperor after Co^stantyn. He was a very nygon / and
was exalted to his empire by the Greeks / but he profyted not / for in his time
all the eest Imperyall was brought to naught. For the Romans put them under
Karolus magnus. Jerusalem about this time was recovered by Karolus / with all
the holy land. And the sect of sarasyns was destroyed strongly. For the
destruccyon of wretches came than. Mychaell was emperor two year. And he was a
very chryst^ man / and was well beloved / and was also conuynge in all scyences.
And those that Nichoferus had hurt and distressed of their goods by his
covetousness / this Michaell restored the^ their goods again. Nota. Karolus
magnus the first saint was emperor after Michaell / and he was crowned
emperor by Leo the pope. From y^ which time the empire was translated fro the
Greeks to France and Germany. And for the translacyon of y^ empire / the
Greeks always were defectyue unto y^ Romans and the Greeks strove evermore with
them / but it was more with venymous words than with strength / and more with craft
than with battle. For they had so great envy at y^ Romans that they would not
obey the church of Rome. For certainly when y^ the popes would write unto them
for to obey the church of Rome / they wrote again and said. Ye have taken from
our kynrede the empire / and therefore we will you not obey / and we us take
from you And as touching this noble emperor Karolus / it is to be understand
/ this man wha^ he was a young man he was anointed king in France by Stephen
the pope / in the year of our lord Jesus Christ. vij.C. and.liiij. when his
tader Pippinus lived / under whom / and with whom he reigned.xv. year / to the
death of his fader. Than after the death of his fader in the year of our lord
god. vij.C.lxviij. this Karolus with his brother Karolo manna reigned two year.
Than his brother decessed in the second year. And this Karolus than held all
y^ hole king dome.xiiij. year / to the year of our lord vij. hundred.lxxxiiii.
in the which year he went unto Rome that he might be crowned emperor of the
pope Adryan. And there he reigned emperor. rvi. year / to the year of our lord
god.viii.C. when pope Leo confermed him again to be emperor. And after that he
was emperor.xiiij. year. And this Karolus magnus decessed in the year of his
age lxxij. the which was the year of our lord god.viij. hundred and. riiii.
If (...) will se more of this Karolus go to the book of the bishop Turpinus
and (...)braminus his master / for they wrote his noble acts euerychone. ^^o
the fourth was pope after Adrian. (...). year. This man when he went on a
cet^ayn day with the Letany to saint Peter's church on saint Marks day / he
was taken with cursed people / the which put out both his eyes / and his
tongue was cut of. But our lord meruaylously restored him again his sight
and his speech / so that he spoke without tongue and saw by miracle. And
afterward he went to Karolus in to France. And he came with him to Rome / and
there venged the pope of his enemies. And than he crowned Karolus / and he late
before crowned / confermed him again. Ludouicus y^ meke / the first begoten
sone of Karolus was emperor after his fader.xxvi. year / in whose time was put
away that clerks should use no gyrdels with precious stones / ne strange
arayment. This Ludouicus on his first wife gate two children / and both had an
ill end In all thing y^ went against him he was pacyent / and in the last
end ever he overcame it / for toward god he abode devout / and his children
followed his condicyons / and he decessed a blyssed man. Stephanus the fourth
was pope after Leo.iij. year. This Stephanus redeemed many captyue men / and
crowned Lodewyke the emperor / and than he decessed / and was buried at Rome.
Paschall was pope after Stephanus. This Paschall gave great dilyge^ce to
relykes of saints / and he took up innumerable bodies of saints / and buried
them worshipfully / as in the visyon of saint Cecile he was commanded.
Eugenius y^ fourth was pope after Paschall / and he was a very holy man / and
those things that were for Christ he took head to. This man was crowned a
martyr / and by y^ lay men of Rome he was buried in saint Peter's church yerde.

Circa annu^ du^i. viij.C.xliiij.
TAlentinus was pope after Eugeny.xl. days / and little of him is written.
Gregory y^ fourth was pope after him.xij. year. This Gregory saw many heavy
times for y^ plages among the common people. And at this man's peticion
Lodewyke y^ emperor / and Marchio the prince of Lombardy exyled all sarasyns
from ytaly / and at the last he decessed after innumerable good deeds and
works y^ he had done at saint Peter's. Lotherius the first sone of Lodewyke was
emperor.xv. year in Ytaly and in Rome and in the parts of Germayn next to
the hills of Alpy. This Lothertus rose against his brother Lodewike and Karolus
for the kingdom of Duchelonde / the which sometime Pippinus their brother held
/ and they fought at a place called Fontanetu^ / where Lothery was disco^fyted
/ and there was such slaughter made on both sides / that they had no men to
resist their adversaries. This understood a falls christen man / and sent unto
y^ Sowdan of the sarasyns that he should come anon. And he took Rome / and
saint Peter's church was made a stable for their horses. But Lodewyke with the
frenshmen and lombardes all that infynyte multitude destroyed / and that with
great shedynge of chryste^ blood. Sergius y^ second was pope after Gregory two
year. This man was first called Os porci / in englisshe hogs mouth / wherefore
that man and after all y^ popes names are changed when they be chosen. And
that for three causes. The first for Christ changed y^ names of those men
which he made popes. The second for as much as they are changed in name / so
should they be changed in pfeccyon of life. The third leest he which is
chosen to an exceeding degree should be hurt in name. Leo was pope after
Sergius.viij. year. This Leo was an holy man / and also he was in prudence as
sharp as a serpent / and in his deeds as meke as a dove. And he was brought
forth virtuously in a monastery. And when that he was made pope / he labored
to repair his chirches again / the which the false sarasyns one after an other
had destroyed This man was a mighty writer and a great precher / and a mighty
labourer in watch and prayer / and so dyed / and was buried and lies at saint
Peter's. Been dictus a Romayn was pope after Leo two year. This Benedictus had
the name of the thing / for in all thing was he blyssed. And he ordained that
clerks should go ordynatly and honestly. Ludouicus y^ sone of Lothery was
emperor this time / and anointed of Sergio y^ pope and a while reigned with his
fader / and after he reigned.xxi. year alone. This man had a sone y^ hight
Karolus / in to whom a devil entered / and vexed hy^ before his fader / and tha^
he conspyred his faders death / and in his time fell many meruayles. Nota.
Ioha^nes Anglicus of y^ nacyo^ of Maguntyn about this time was pope / and she
was a woman arrayed in man's garments. But she profyted much in holy
scripture. Tha^ she was chosen pope / but she was afterward with child / and
going openly in procession she travailed and decessed. And this is y^.vj. pope
yt to this time had y^ name of holiness / and were vicious / and this person as
other cursed popes were was punisshed of god / nor she was not no^bred in y^
book of popes. Nicolaus a Romayn was pope after this woman.ix. year. This man
exceded all other in holiness / save saint Gregory / and after decessed / and
lies in saint peter's chirch yerd. Adrian a Romayn was pope after Nicolas. This
man cursed Lothery y^ emperors brother king of Lothering for his aduoutry. But
when he came with his noble men to Rome to excuse hy^ for his auoutry / he said
he was cursed wrongfully / and all dyed in one year and y^ king dyed going to
y^ cite of Place^cia^

This time came the Danes in to England. Alured.

Anno dn^i. viij.C.lxxiij.
Of king Alured / and how the Danes in his time prayed him of mercy / that
they might go out of the land.
AFter y^ death of Eldred reigned his brother Alured y^ Dolfynes was called. Than
went y^ Danes and assembled them / and went forth to seek Alured y^ tho was
newly made king of Southsex / and there they found him at Wylton with a little
power / and nevertheless he fought with them / but at y^ last he fled thens
from the field and went in to westser and ordained of his own realm and of
other y^ he had a strong power / so y^ the Danes could not withstand hy^. And
he came to London with his host where y^ Danes soiourned / and would have fought
with them. But the Danes durst not / but prayed hy^ of peace and that they might
go again in to their own country / and never more to come in to england again
any harm to do / gyuyng him hostages such as he would ask.

How Hubba and Hungar were slain at Chyppenham / and how the Danes brought
their king unto our king.
ANd the same day y^ the Danes departed fro London they rode so fast both
night and day / and never rested till that they came unto Excestre / and took
the town / and there held them. When king Alured herd these tidings anon
he let take the hostages / and went from thens unto Excestre with all y^ power
that he had. And when y^ Danes herd tell of his coming / they went from thens
unto Westsex / and came to Chippenham / and there they did much harm in the
country / they robbed folk / and brught them in to prison. The king Alured
pursued them and came upon them with all his people and fyersly them assailed
And there were slain both Hubba and Hungar his brother / and Buerne Bocard.
And in this battle was much people slain on that one part and on that
other. But the gree of that field abode with y^ Danes / for as much as the
king came with little company. The king hasted hy^ as much as he might to go
again. And when y^ Danes found Hubbaes body lyenge deed / they buried it / and
made upon it a great lodge / and let call it Hubbe^ low / and so it is called
unto this day / and yt place is in Deuenshyre. The barons of Somerset /
Wyltshyre / and Dorset herd tell how their king was discomfyted / and ordained
all y^ power that they might / and came to the king where as he was / and
thanked god that they found him alive for they had wend y^ Danes had slain
him. Than the king and his barons concluded to go seek the Danes and to fight
with them. And so they rode all y^ night and on the morrow about pryme came to
Abyngdon where as y^ Danes were. Thankkyng Alured and his barons assem bled
them / and egerly assailed the Danes and there gave them a strong battle /
and the Danes long time put them of / that no man wist whether part lost most
folk. But thus it befell as god would yt the king Alured had the victory with
much honor. For the Danes were so driven / that they ne wist whether to turn
And.xv. days the king them pursued at his will / that glad and feign they were
for to speak of peace / and took to him good hostage / and said they would never
war more upon hy^. And more over they promised king Alured that they would go
and bring their own king unto him / and that their king and they all should be
baptized. And upon this co^dicyon king Alured granted them life and lymme /
and said to them that they should go seek their king and at a certain day that
was set to come again to him. And so they went forth fast / and came again at
their day that was assigned / and y^ Danes brought their king with them.
King Alured anon let them be baptized / and their names were changed / so
that the king of Denmark was called Athelstone / and xxx. of his felawes
names were changed also / and the other were baptized to y^ right believe. And
all this was done at Westmynster / and after that king Alured held with him
king Athelston and all his Danes.xij. days at soiourne with great solempnite /
and gave them great gifts. After that they took their leave and departed. Than
was king Alured well at ease when he had ouercomen his enemies / and that they
were turned to the right believe of almighty god.

How y^ Danes y^ went in to France with Gurmond / came again in to England. And
of the death of king Alured.


ANd thus it befell afterward that the Danes of Northumberlond that were paynyms
came with a great strength and an huge host of france / that is to be
understand / with them y^ went into France with Gurmond of Affryke when he
had conquered England and gave it to the saxons. And those that came fro
france arrived in Kent / and sent in to Northumberlonde that they should come
to them. And when those two hosts were comen and assembled / anon they went
to destroy all y^ christen people of england from place to place / and did
much sorrow In this time dyed king Alured that was wont to abbate the Danes /
and.xxx. year he reigned / and had been a good king / and well could chastyse his
enemies / and also he was a good clerk / and let make many books / and a book
he made in english of auentures of kings and of batayles that had been done
in y^ loud / and many other books he let write of great wisdom and good
learning / on whose soul god have mercy / and lies at Wynchestre.

IOha^nes the.viij. was pope after Adryan.viii. year. This John anointed
Karolus y^ emperor / and he suffered great wrong of y^ Romans / for he
favored not the said emperor / and therefore he put y^ said pope in keeping.
Also he degraded y^ bishop of Portuense that was y^ cause of al his sorrow.
Karolus y^ second was emperor after Ludouicus This Karolus had a brother y^ was
called Lodwyke / and he was king of Germayn and he ordained a battle against
his brother / but Karolus or they fought was poisoned / and he made many a
monastery. Martinus was pope after John one year. This Martyn little profyted /
for he lived but little time. Adrianus y^ third was pope after hy^ one year /
and of hy^ is nothy^ge written. Stephanus the.v. was pope after hy^.vi. year /
and no thing of hy^ is written / but y^ he translated y^ body of saint Martyn.
Karolus y^ third was emperor after y^ second.xij. year. This Karolus peasybly
had in possessyon all france and Germayn / and was crowned emperor of John y^
pope. And after his glorious victory he turned all Normandy to y^ faith. And he
might no more resyst the frensshme^ but.iiij. year he reigned on them / and he
was unprofitable to them / and therefore they put him away. Arnulphus was
emperor after Karolus. ^ij year. This man utterly constrained the Normans y^
destroyed y^ frensshmen. rl. year. Than he sekened and had no comfort of no
leche / for he was in a meruaylous sekenes / so y^ he was consumed with life /
and was deed. Formosus was pope after Stephen.v. year. This man first was
bishop of Portuensis / and of pope John was depryued for his inobedie^ce / and
was degraded to y^ lay fe / but by Martyn the pope he was restored / and

days. Benedictus the.iiij. was.iii. year and two months. Leo y^.iiij. was.xl.
days. Xp^oforus the first.vij. months. These.viii. popes were but little time
/ and therefore we can not tell of them no notable things / but if we should
write sclau^dre of them y^ might be found / for the vnherd strife and
co^tencyon in yt holy apostles seet / for one strove against another /
repreuing each others deeds: and for to tell how they strove it were no great
honor to show / for y^ holy apostles seet. Ludouicus y^ third was emperor
after Arnulphus.vi. year This man had not y^ popes blessing / for y^
unstableness of them y^ reigned in Ytaly / and he was constrained to expulse
Bering. And this man was the last emperor of all y^ kynrede of Karolus king of
france. This time the Empire was remeued / translated / and divided. For the
Frensshmen helped not the church / the which their faders had edyfyed and
fortefyed / but destroyed them / nor helped not the Romans against the
Lombardes / which vexed the Romans right sore. Therefore by y^ comyns assent
they were excluded from the Empire / and the ytalyens began to be emperors in
yta lie / and the Almayns in Almayne / until Octauien which reigned in both
y^ places. The frensshmen were constrained to abide in their own country / and
no more to be emperors for their myscheuous living. Beringarius the first.
Contadus and Beringarius the second / and Hugo were emperors after Lodewyke
but they are not nombred among the Emperors. For some were but in Almayne /
and some in Ytalye.

came often with their companyes in to this land. When the king saw that he
might no better do / than he made peace with them / and granted them his
trewse. And nevertheless the trewse dured not long y^ the Danes ne began to
war strongly upon y^ englysshmen / and did them much sorrow / wherefore king

wretchedly was slain by G(...)does knights for they put on his mouth a pyllow
and stopped his breath. And after hy^ was another put in / but anon he was put
out / and therefore he is not named a pope. Henricus the duke of Saxonye was
emperor of Almayn.xviij. year. This Henry was a noble man / but he is not
nombred among the emperors: for he reigned but al only in Almayn / and he had
a very holy woman unto his wife / and her name was Matilda / on whom he gate

preched. And this Eldred reigned.xj. year / and lies at Wynchestre.

Of king Edwyn.
ANd after this Eldred reigned Edwyn the sone of Edmund / and he was an
vncouenable man toward god and the people. For he hated folk of his own
land / and loved and honored strange men / and set little by holy church /
and he took of holy church all the treasour that he might have / that was
great shame and vylany to himself / and peril to his soul. And therefore god
would not that he should regne no longer than.iiii. year and dyed / and lies

of Agapitus they should those Octauianu^ his sone pope. And so it was done /
and was named John / and he was a hunter and a lecherous man / so that openly
he kept women. Wherefore certain cardynalles wrote to Ottonem the emperor of
Almayn / that he should come to Rome for to help to destroy the sclaundre of
the church. This the pope perceived / and the hand that wrote that pystle he
made to be cut of. And many times he was warned by ye Emperor and the clergy
that he should correct him self. But he would not for no thing. Than he was
deposed / and Leo was put in to his place. Wherefore the emperor was anoyed /
and came again and besyeged Rome so long / till they took Benedicte to him
and restored Leo.

Of king Edgar that reigned above the kings of Scotlonde and of Wales And how
he was begyled through the taking of his wife.
ANd after this Edwyne reigned Edgar his brother / a man that much loved god and
peace / and holy church also / and was a worthy man and a great lord of blood
and mighty / and maynteyned well this lord in peace. And this Edgar was lord
and king above all the kings of Scotlond and of Wales / from the time that
Arthur was gone was never sith king of his power. And this Edgar was saint
Edwardes fader. And wha^ Edgars wife was deed that was sayt Edwardes mother and
buried / he herd speak of the fayrnes of Estrylde / yt was Orgarus daughter a
baron of Deuenshyre that was so fair a woman / that all men spoke of her. He
called one of his knights that he much loved and trusted upon / and said to
him. Go said he to the noble baron Orgarus of Deuenshyre and se if that his
daughter be so fair as men speak of / and if it be soth I will have her to my
wife. This knight that was called Edelwolde went forth his way as the king
him had said / and came where as the lady was. And wha^ he saw her so fair /
he thought to have her himself to his wife / and thereof spoke to Orgarus her
fader / and her fader was an old man and had no moo children but her only /
and saw that Edelwolde was a fair young knight and worthy and rich / and was
well beloved with the king / and thought his daughter should well be married and
beset upon him / and granted him his daughter if the good lord the king would
consent thereto. And tha^ this Edelwold came again to ye king and told him that
she was fair enough to se upon / but she was wonders lothly. Than answered the
king and said that he took but little charge. Sir said Edelwold / she is her
faders heir / and I am not rich of lands / and if ye would consent and
grant that I might have her / than should I be rich enough. In gods name
said ye king / I consent thereto. Edelwold than thanked the king much / and
went again in to Deuenshyre and spoused the damoysell / and in that country he
dwelled. And thus it befell upon a time that he told his counseyle and all
this thing unto his wife / how and in what manner he had ^egyled his lord the
king yt would have had her to wife. And anon as she it wist / she loved him
never more after ward as she did before. This lady conceived by him a sone.
And when time was that ye child should be borne / Edelwold came to the king and
prayed him to heue a sone of his at the fontstone. The king him granted and
let call him Edgar after his own name. And when this was done / he thought
that al was syker enough for the king / that he would not take his wife / for
as much as his lord was a ioly man and an amerous.

How king Edgar wedded Estrylde after the death of Edelwolde.
^Hus it befell that all men in king Edgars court than spoke and said that
Edelwolde was rychely auaunced through the marriage of his wife / and yet they
said he was auaunced an hundred fold more / for he had spoused the fairest
woman that ever was seen. And when the king herd speak so much of her beauty
/ he thought yt Edelwold had him deceived and begyled / and thought pryuely in
his heart that he would go in to Deuenshyre as it were for to hunt for the
heart and for the hynde and other wild beestes / and than he should se there
ye lady or he departed the^s. And this lady was dwelling at a manner place
beside ye forest where that the king would hunt / and at that manner he was
herborowed all night. And when time came that the king should soupe and the
son shone / the king asked after his gossyp and after his godsone. And
Edelwold made her to come before the king / and nevertheless if it otherwise
might have been / she should not have come^ in his sight by his will. The lady
welcomed the king and swetely him kyssed. And he took her by ye hand and next
by him her set / and so souped they together. And there was a custom and an
usage in this land yt time / that when one drunk to an other / the drynker
should say wassayle / and that other should answer and say / drink hay^e /
And thus did the king and the lady many times and also kyssed. And after
souper when time was to go to bed ye king went to bed thynkyng hertely on
the fayrnes of that lady / and than was ouercomen for her love / that him
thought ye he should dye / but if he had his will on her. Upon the morrow the
king arose and went in ye forest for to dysporte him with hearts and hyndes
and all other wild beestes / and of ye hearts great plente he sent to that
lady. And thryes he went to solace and speak with that lady wh^^es he dwelled
there in that country. And after that the king remeued th(...)s / and
bethought him how he might best deliver Edelwolde from his wife as he had him
first deceived. And the king anon after.viij. days let ordeyn a parlyament
at Salysbury of all his baronage to have counseyle and for to ordeyne how the
country of Northumberlonde should best be kept that the danes came not there
to destroy the land. And this Edelwolde came unto the kings parlyament. And
the king sent him unto york for to be keeper of that country. And thus it
befell that men that knew him not slew him by the way. And anon as the king
herd tell that Edelwolde was deed / he let send after the fair lady Estrylde
that she should come to the cite of London / and there be wedded to the king
with great solempnite and worship. And when he was come to London soon after
he held a sole^pne feast / and he ware a crown that was of gold / and the
queen an other. And saint Dunstan on the morrow came to ye king in his chamber
/ and found the king and the queen in bed together. And saint Dunstan asked
the king who she was. And the king answered and said. This is the queen
Estrylde. And the archebysshop saint Dunstan said that he did great wrong and
against gods will to take a woman to wife whose child he had holden at ye
fontstone. And the queen for that word never loved saint Dunstan after. And
nevertheless ye good man warned of that folly to be left / but it auayled but
little / for ye love between them was so much. The king begat upon her a
sone that was called Eldred. Wha^ this child was.vj. year old ye king his
fader dyed / and about that time he had reigned xvij. year / and lies at
Glastenbury.

^Eringarius the third was emperor after Henry.vij. year. this Beringarius
was emperor in Ytaly / in whose time was great dyuysyon. And Henry ye emperor
decessed / and Otto began to regne in Almayne. Lotherius reigned after him two
year / and decessed when Otto reigned in Almayn / and had a wife yt hight
Dalnidam / which after wedded Otto. Beringarius ye fourth was after hy^. This
man with great tyranny subdued Ytaly / wherefore the pope and other Romans called
Otto yt he might deliver them / which he did / and he took Beringary by
strength / and twyes he outlawed him / and he took Lotherius wife which ye
tyrau^t had prysoned. Leo ye viij. was pope after Benedictus one year and four
months. This man was chosen with the common voice / and John was deposed. This
Leo ordained yt no pope should be made without consent of ye emperor / for the
malice of the Romans the which oppressed them. This man granted all the
gifts to Otto and his successors / the which were given by Iustinyan and
Karolus to the church / that he might defend Ytaly from ye rebellions.
Ioha^nes the.xij. was pope after him almost.viij. year. This John suffered great
wrong of the Romans / for he was taken and exiled / but Otto bare this
heuyly. For he slew the noble men of Rome / and certain of them exiled for
evermore. Benedictus the sixth was pope after him.vj. year. This man was taken
/ and in the castle Angel was strangled. Nota. The empire this time was
translated to the Almayns. And the same cause is here as was before / for the
vicyous living. Ne these unhappy men could not be informed / yt they could
eschew yt one vice / through ye which they saw so many noble men perysshed.
Otto was emperor after Beringarius.xij. year. This Otto was the first emperor
of Almayne / and he was all virtuous as an other king Karolus / for he was the
defender of ye church of god / and the synguler promoter / for the which he
was worthy to be emperor. Many men of falls believe he converted. And he held
with him pope Benedictus the usurper of the popehede in to Saxony / and there he
decessed in his exile And after this Otto the emperor decessed a rich man in
virtue and goods. Otto the second was emperor after his fader. And he was a
noble man to ye church as his fader was. And many a battle he had against
falls men of believe. And at ye last he had almoost lost all his host in
Kalabre. Yet he for sothe with all his mind besought saint Peter to help. And
meruaylously saint Peter delivered him. And his wife was the daughter of ye
emperor of Constantinople of ye Romans blood / and this man was crowned of
Benedictus the pope.

Of saint Edward the martyr / and how Estrilde his stepmoder let s^ee him for
to make Eldred her own sone king.
AFter this Edgar reigned Edward his sone that he begat upon his first wife /
that well and nobly governed the land. For he was full of all manner of goodness
/ and ladde a full holy life / and above all thing he loved god and holy
church. And the queen Estrylde that was his stepmoder let slay him because to
make her own sone Eldred king / and thus on a day he was slain as ye shall
here afterward. It befell thus upon a day that the king Edward went in to a
wode for to play in ye south country beside a town that is called Warham in
which forest was great plente of hearts and hyndes. And wha^ he had been a
while there for to sport hy^ / he thought upon his brother Eldred that was with
his mother the queen / for her place was nygh the forest / and thought for to go
thither and vysyte and se his brother. And took with him but a little meyny / and
went toward his stepmoders house / yt in that time soiourned in the castle of
Corfe. And as he rode in the thycknes of the wode to espy his game / it befell
that he went amysse and lost his meyny that came with him. And at the last he
came out of ye wode / and as he looked about him he saw there fast besides a
manner that his stepmoder dwelled in / and thyderwarde he went alone. And anon
it was told the queen / how that the king was comen alone without any company.
And therefore she made Joy enough / and thought how she might do that he were
slain as pryuely as she might / and she called to her one of her knights / to
whom she had told much of her counsel between them. And both they came to
the king and curteysly received him. And the king said that he was comen to
visyte her / and also for to speak with Eldred his brother. The queen many times
thanked him / and bade him to alyght and harborowe with her all that night. The
king said that he might not / but again he would go unto his folk / if he
might find them. And when the queen saw that he would not abide / she prayed
him yt he would ones drink. And he granted her. And anon as ye drink was
come / the que^e drank unto the king. And the king took the cup and set it
to his mouth / and in the mean while that he drank / the false knight that
was with the queen with a knyfe smote the king unto the heart / and there he
fell down deed from his palfrey unto the earth. The queen for this deed gave
the knight gold and silver great plente and of other richesse enough. And ye
knight anon as this was done went him over the sea / and so escaped he out of
this land. When this king Edward was thus martyred it was (...) ye year of ye
incarnacyon of our lord. ^x.C.lxxx. and he had reigned.xij. year and an half /
and lies at Glastenbury.

Of king Eldred and how the king Swyne of Denmark held England and how Eldred
that was saint Edwardes brother was not beloved in his realm and therefore he
fled in to Normandy.
AFter this king Edward reigned Eldred his brother / and saint Dunstan crowned
him. And this saint Dunstan dyed soon after yt he had forgyuen Estrilde the
queen her trespace because that she was cause of king Edwardes death / and saint
Dunstan had her alloyled and enjoined her penance / and she lived after a
chaste life and a clean. This king Eldred wedded an English woman / and on
her he begat Edmund Iren side / and an other sone that was called Edwyne. And
after dyed ye queen their mother. And in that time came Swyne in to England
that was king of Denmark / for to challenge and conquer all that his
auncestres had before ye time / And so he conquered and had it all at his
asking. For the good earl Cuthbert of Lyndesey and all the people of
Northumlonde and almoost all the gretest men of England held with Swyne that
was king of De^marke / for as much as they loved not king Eldred / because
that his good brother Edward was falsely slain for the love of him / and
therefore no man set but little by him. Wherefore king Swyne had all his will /
and took all the land. And Eldred the king than fled in to Normandy / and so
spoke to ye duke Richard / that the duke gave him his sister Emme to wife /
upon the which he gate two sons / that one was called Alured / and that other
Edward. And when king Swyne had conquered all ye land he reigned nobly / and
lived.xv. year / and than he dyed / and lies at york.

How king Eldred came again from Normandy / and how Knoght the Dane reigned /
and of the war between him and Edmunde Irensyde.
AFter the death of Swyne yt was a Dane / Knoght his sone dwelled in England /
and would have been king And tha^ came again Eldred out of Nor mandy with a
great nombre of people and a strong army / that Knoght durst not abide / but
fled thens in to Denmark. The king Eldred had again his realm / and held
so great lordshyp that he began to destroy all those that helped Swyne that
was a Dane against hy^. And afterward this Knoght came again from Denmark with
a great power so that king Eldred durst not fight with him / but fled from
thens unto London / and there held him. Than came Knoght and besyeged him so
long till that king Eldred dyed in ye cite of London / and lies in saint
Paul's church. And he reigned.ix. year.

BOnus was pope after Benedict one year. This man abode but a little time.
Bonifacius was pope after him five months. Benedictus was pope after him.x.
year. This man crowned Otto the second / and made many Romans to be taken /
and he gadered a counsel against the king of France / where Gylbert the
nygromancer was deposed. Ioha^nes the.xiiij. was pope after him.viij. months
/ and he was put in the castle Angel / and was famysshed to death. Ioha^nes
yt.xv. was pope after him.iiij. months. Ioha^nes the.xvj. was pope after hy^
almoost xj. year. This man was taught in arms / and made many books / and
else little of him is written. Gregorius the.v. was pope after this man almoost
three year. This Gregory was made pope at the instaunce of the emperor Otto the
third / for he was his cousin. And when he had been a little while pope / and
the emperor receded from the cite of Rome Place^tinus was put in by
Crescencius a consul / for money / and than was strife a few days. But the
emperor came soon after again / and took Crescencius ye consul and stroke of
his heed / and put out the eyes of this man that put out his cosyn of the
dignite of the poperyche / and maimed him in other members / and his dukes ne
his knights helped hy^ no thing For he did that thing that he should not have
done / and he suffered that that he deserved. Nota. This Gregory with the
emperor Otto ordained there the chosers of the empire / the which from thens
forth has abyden unto this day. For ye frensshmen nor none other might not
break ye ordinance. And those chosers of the Empire by the pope and Otto were
not made for any blame of the saxons / but to eschew the petylles to come And
their names ben written in latin for learned men in these verses. Magun ^inensis.
Treuerensis. Coloniensis. quilibet imperij fit cancellarius horum. Et Palatinus

Through this occasyon the Egle has lost many a fether / and in the end he
shall be made naked. Otto ye third was emperor.xviij. year. This man was a
worthy man all the days of his empire. And after the wisdom of his fader he
was a very faithful man to the church. And in many batayles he prospered
because he was devout to almighty god and his saints And gave mighty
worshyppyng unto the relykes of saints. And oftentimes he visyted holy places.
This man was crowned by Gregory his cosyn. And at the last he decessed at Rome.

Anno domini. M.iiij. Nota.
SIluester the second was pope after Gregory.iiij. year / and he was made pope
by the help of the devil / to whom he did homage / for he should give him
all thing that he desired / and he was called Gylbert. And his enemy gate him
the grace of ye king of france and he made him bishop of Remensis but anon
he was deposed. And after he gate the grace of the Emperor / and was made
bishop of Rauennie / and after pope but he had an end anon / and so have all
that put their hope in falls deuyls. Yet men trust in his salvation for certain
demonstracions of his sepulture / and for ye great penance yt he did in his
last end. For he made his hands and legs to be cut of / and disme^bred all
his body / and made them to be cast out at the door to fowls / and than his
body to be drawn with wild beestes / and there to be buried where so ever they
rested as an hou^de. And they stood still at saint John de Latrans / and there
he was buried / and that was sign of his salvation. Ioha^nes the.xviij. was
pope.v. months. Johannes the.xix. was pope after him five year. And these two
did little things. Henricus ye first was emperor in Almayn xx. year. This
Henry was duke of Barry / and all according he was chosen for his blyssed fame
and good name the which he had. And it is read that many of these dukes of
Barry were holy men / not all only in absteynynge them from flesshly desires /
but also in virtuous living. And this Henry had a sister that was as holy as he
/ whom he gave to wife unto the king of Hungary. And she brought all Hungary
unto the right believe and christen faith. And his wives name was San^^a
Ro^^ogundis with whom he lived a virgyn all the days of his life. And he made
many a battle / as well in ytaly as in Almayn agayust them that rebelled and
prospered right wysly evermore on them. At the last with a blyssed end he
decessed. And in the life of saint Laurence he and his wife be put for ensamples
because of their holy and virtuous living. Benedictus was pope after John.xi.
year. This man had great strife in his days. For he was put out / and an other
was put in. And this Benedictus after that he was deed / was seen of an holy
bishop in a wretched figure / and he had great pain. And this figure said he
trusted no thing in the mercy of god / and no thing profyted him that was
done for him / for it was gotten by extorcyon and unjustly. Tha^ this bishop
left his bysshopryche for dread of this sight / and went in to a monastery and
lived virtuously all his days. Ioha^nes ye.xx. was pope after him.xi. year /
and little profyted.

Of king Knoght that was a Dane.
ANd after the death of this Eldred Knoght that was a Daue began to regne. But
Edmund Irensyde yt was king Eldredes sone by his first wife ordained a great
power of men / and began to war on king Knoght. And so he did many times and
often / and the war was so strong and hard ye wonder it was to wit And the
queen Emme yt than dwelled at westmynster had great dread of her two sons
Alured and Edward / lest they should be destroyed through ye war / wherefore
she sent them over see in to Normandy to the duke Richard their uncle / and
there they dwelled in safete and peace long time. This Edmund Irensyde and
Knoght the Dane warred fyersly together. But at ye last they were accorded in
this manner / that they should depart the realm between them / and so they did
/ and loved together like two brethren.

How king Edmund Irensyde was slain through treason by a traitor yt was
called Edryth of Stratton.
ANd than after reigned king Edmu^d Irensyde and Knoght ye dane But thus it
befell afterward yt in ye same year that they were accorded and so much loved
together / wherefore a falls traitor had envy at the love that was between them /
whose name was Edrith of stra^to^ / that was a great lord yt was Edmunde
Irensydes man / and of him held all the land that he had / and nevertheless
he thought to betraye his lord / and make Knoght king of all the land / to
the intent rychely to be auau^ced / and with him to be well beloved. Wherefore
he prayed his lord Edmunde Irensyde on a day with him for to ete. And the
king him curteysly granted / and to him came at his prayer. And at meet the
king was ryally served with diverse metes and drynkes. And when night came that
he should go to bed / the king took his own meyny and went to the chamber
where as he should take his nyghtes rest And as he looked about him he saw a
fair image and a well made in semblau^t as it were an archer with a bow bent
in his hand / and in ye bow a fine arowe. King Edmund went nere to behold
it better. And when he was by it / anon ye arowe smote him through the body /
and there slew the king / for ye engyn was made to slay his own lord
traytoursly. And when king Edmund was thus deed and slain / he had reigned
but.x. year And his people made much sorrow for him / and his body they bare
to Glastenbury / and there buried him. And this false traitor Edrith anon went
to ye queen that was king Edmundes wife that wist not of her lords death / and
took from her two sons that were fair and young that her lord had gotten on
her / that one was called Edward / and that other Edwyne / and ladde them with
him to London / and took them to king Knoght yt he should do with them what his
will were. And told hy^ how subtylly he had slain king Edmund because ye Knoght
should have all the land of England. O thou falls traytoure / have you slain
my true brother that was so true because of me / a man that I most loved in the
world. Now by my heed I shall for thy travail the well reward as thou have
deserved / and anon let him be taken / and bound him hands and feet in manner
of a traitor / and let cast him in to the river of Tamyse. And in this manner
the false traitor ended his life. The king took ye two children and put them
unto the abbot of West mynster to ward and to keep till he wist what was best
with them for to do.

How king Knoght sent both king Edmondes sons in to Denmark for to be
slain / and how they were saved.
ANd it befell soon afterward that king Knoght had all the land in his
hands: and spoused ye queen Emme through consent of al his barons / for she
was a fair woman / the which was Eldredes wife / and the dukes sister of
Normandy / and they lived together with much love as reason would. The king
asked upon a day counsel of the queen what was best to do with Edmond
Irensydes sons. Sir said she / they be the right heirs of the land / and if
they live they will do you much sorrow with war / and therefore let send them
in to a strange land aferre / to some man that may destroy them. The king
anon let call a Dane that was called Walgar / and commanded him that he
should led those two children in to Denmark / and so to do and ordeyne for
them that he should never more here of them. Sir said this Walgar / your
commandment gladly shall be done. And anon he took the two children and
led them in to Denmark. And for as much as he saw that the children were
wonders fair and m^ke / he had of them great pite and ruth / and would not slay
them / but led them to ye king of Hungary for to nourysshe. For this Walgar
was well beknowen with the king and well beloved. Anon the king asked fro
whens the children were. And Walgar told him and said yt they were ye right
heirs of England / and therefore men would destroy them / and therefore sir
unto you they be comen to seek mercy and help / and for soth if they may live
your men they shall become / and of you they shall hold all their land. The
king of Hungary received the^ with much honor / and let them worthily be
kept. And thus it befell afterward that Edwyne ye younger brother dyed / and
Edward the elder brother lived / a fair man and a strong / and a large of
body / and gentle and curteys of condicyons / so yt all men loved him. And
this Edward in ye chronicles is called among Englysshmen Edward the outlawe.
And when he was made knight / the kings daughter of Hungary loved him much
for his goodness and his fayrnes / so that she called him her derlynge. The
king that was her fader perceived well the love that was between them two /
and he had none heyr but only that daughter. And the king vouchedsafe his
daughter to no man so well as he did to him that she loved so well / and he her
again and gave her unto him with a good will. And Edward her spoused with
much honor. The king of Hungary sent after all his barons and made a solemp^e
feast and a rich wedding / and made all men to understand yt this Edward
should be king after his decesse of all the land of Hungary. Of the which
tidings they were all right glad. And this Edward begat upon this lady a
sone the which was called Edgar Helyng / and afterward a daughter that was
called Margarete / that afterward was queen of Scotlonde. And by the king of
scotlond that was called Mancolin she had a daughter that was called Maud that
was queen afterward of England through king Henry y^ was the first sone of
the conqueror that her wedded / and he begat on her a daughter that was
called Maud / that afterward was empress of Almayne. And of this Maud came the
king of England that unto this day is called Henry the empress sone / and
yet had this Edward an other daughter by his wife yt was called Christian /
and she was a nonne.

How king Knoght yt was a proud man conquered Nor way / and how he became
afterward meke and mylde.
NOw have ye herd of Edmunde Irensydes sons yt king Knoght wend they had been
slain as he had co^ mau^ded Walgar before. And this king Knoght had in his
hands all y^ realm of England and Denmark. And after that they went unto
Norway for to co^quere that land. But the king of the land yt was called
Elaf came with his people / and wend to have well kept and defended his land
/ and so there he faught with him / till at y^ last he was slain in yt battle.
And tha^ this Knoght took all y^ land in to his hands. And wha^ he had
conquered Norway / and taken feaute and homage there he came again in to
England / and held himself so great a lord / yt him thought in all the
world was not his pere / and became so proud and hauteyne that it was great
wonder. And so it befell upon a day as he had herd mass at west mynster / and
would have gone in to his palace the wawes of the Tamyse so swyftely came
against him y^ almoost they touched his feet. Than said y^ king with a proud
heart. I command the water to turn again / or else I shall make the. The
wawes for his commandment would not spare / but flowed in heyght more and
more. The king was so proud of heart that he would not flee y^ water but abode
still in y^ water / and bette it with a yerde y^ he had in his hand / and
commanded ye water yt it should go no ferder. But for all his commandment y^
water would not cese / but increased more and more / so that the king was all
wete / and stood deep in the water And when he saw the water would not do his
commandment / he wtdrewe him and stood upon a stone / holdyng up his hands
on hye / and said herynge all y^ people. This god yt makes y^ see thus arise
on hye is king of all kings / and of all mygh tes most / and I am a caytyf
and a deedly man / and he may never dye / and all thing does his commandment
and him obeys. To yt god I pray yt he be my warrau^t / for I knowledge me a
caytyf feeble and of no power / and therefore I will go unto Rome without any
long lettyng / my wicked nes to punysshe / and me to amend. For of god I clay
me my land for to hold / and of none other. And anon made ready his heir /
and himself went to Rome without any lettynge. And by y^ way did many alms
deeds / and at Rome also. And wha^ he had been there and done penance for his
sins / he came again in to England / and became a good man and an holy /
leuyng all manner pride / and lived an holy life / and made two abbeys of saint
Benet / one in England / and another in Norway / by cause he loved saint Benet
more specially than any other saint / and he loved much also saint Edmund the
king / and often he gave great gifts to the house / and made it rich. And when
he had reigned.xx. year he dyed / and lies at Wynchestre.

Anno dn^i. M.xviij.
BEnedictus the.ix. was pope after Johannes / and he was a great lethour / and
therefore he was dampened / and he appeared to a certain man under a meruaylous
figure and an horrible. His heed and his tail was like an ass / that other
part of his body like a beer. And he said to this man to whom he appeared. Be
not aferde / for I was a man as ye be now / but for my beestly living wha^ I
was pope I appear now like a be. In this man's time was great diuisyon and
sclau^dre to y^ church / for he was put out and in two times. And here
Ptholomeus notes yt the pride of bishops had ever an evil end / and it was
ever y^ occasyon of much unrest and battle. Co^radus the first was emperor
after Henry.xx. year This man made many laws / and commanded peace to be kept
most straytly of any man. But y^ earl of Ludolf was accused and he fled from
his land / and desired more to live like a chorle than like a gentylman / and
yet meruaylously his sone was made emperor by y^ commandment of god against
the will of Conradus. And at the last they were accorded / and he took Conradus
daughter to his wife.

Of king Harold that had lever go on foot than ride on horsbacke.
THis Knoght of whom we have spoken of before had two sons by his wife Emme /
yt one was called Hardiknoght / and yt other Harold / and he was so light on
foot yt men called him comynly Harold hare foot. And this Harold was no thing
manerd after Knoght his fader / for he set not by cheualry / curteysy / ne
worship / but only by his own will. And he became so wicked yt he exiled his
mother Emme. And she went in to Flau^dres / and there dwelled with y^ earl /
wherefore he and his brother hated echeother deedly. And when he had reigned ij.
year and more hedyed / and lies at West mynster.

Of king Hardiknoght that was Haroldes brother.
AFter this Harold hare foot reigned his brother Hardyknoght / a noble knight and
a worthy / and much loved cheualry and all manner of goodness. And when this
Hardiknoght had reigned a little while / he let uncover his brother Harold / and
smote of his heed / and made it to be cast in to a gonge / and the body in to
Ta myse. And after came fysshers and took y^ bedy with their nets by night /
and bare him to saint Cleme^tes church / and there buried him. Thus avenged
him Hardiknoght on his brother. Thus king Har diknoght was so large a gyuer of
meet and drink / that his tables were set every day three times full with
ryall metes and drynkes for his meyny and for them that came to his court. And
this king Hardiknoght sent after Emme his mother and made her to come again /
for his brother Harold hare foot had driven her out of y^ land through counsel
of y^ earl Godwyn that than was the gretest lord in England next the king /
and that had most rule / because he had spoused the daughter of king Knoght
begoten on his first wife. And when this queen was driven out of England and
came to the earl of Flaundres that was called Baldewyne his cosyn found her
there all thing that her neded / unto the time that she went again in to
England / that the king Hardiknoght had sent for her that was her sone / and
made her to come again with much honor. This king Hardiknoght when he had
reigned.v. year he dyed / and lies at West mynster.

Of the vylany that the Danes' did to the englysshmen / wherefore fro that time
after was no Dane made king of this land.
AFter the death of this king Hardiknoght for as much as he ne had no child of
his body begoten / the ^^les and barons asseinbled and made a cou^seyl / that
never more after no man yt was a Dane / though he were never so great a man
among them / he should never be king of England for y^ despyte yt they had
done to englysshmen. For ever more before / if the englyshmen and the da nes
happened to mete upon a bridge / the englyshmen should not be so hardy to mean a
foot / but stand still till the danes were passed forth. And more over if the
englyshmen had not bowed down their heedes to do reverence unto the danes /
they should have been beten and defouled / and such despytes and vylany did the
danes to our englysshme^ / wherefore they were driven out of y^ land after
Hardiknoghtes death. For they had no lord y^ might maintain them. And in this
manner avoided the danes England / that they never came again. The earls and
barons by their common assent and counseyle sent unto Normandy for to seek
those two brethren Alured and Edward that were dwelling with the duke Richard
y^ was their uncle / in intent for to crown Alured the elder brother / and make
him king of England / and of this thing to make an end. The earls and barons
made their oath / but the earl Godwyn of Westsex falsely and traytoursly thought
to slay these two brethren anon as they should come in to England / in intent
to make Harold his sone king / the which sone he had begoten on his wife king
Hardiknogh tes daughter y^ was a dane. And so this Godwyn went pryuely to
southhamton for to mete there with the two brethren at their landynge. And
thus it befell yt the messengers yt went in to Normandy found not but only
Alured that was y^ eldest brother. For Edward his brother was gone to Hungary
for to speak with his cosyn Edward the outlawe y^ was Edmund Irensydes sone.
The messengers said to Aluted how y^ the earls and ba rons of England sent for
hy^ / and y^ he should boldly come in to England and receive the realm: for
king Hardiknoght was deed and all the danes driven out of the land.

How Godwyn the false traitor took Alured upon Gildesdown when that he came
from Normandye to be king of England / and how he caused him to be martyred
in the isle of Ely.


When Alured herd these tydy^ges he thanked god / and took shyppyng with all y^
haste that he might and passed the sea and arrived at south hamton there Godwyn
y^ falls traitor was. And when this traitor saw y^ he was comen / he welcomed
him and received him with much joy / and said yt he would led him to London
where as all the barons of England him abode to make him their king. And so
they went on their way toward London. And when they came on Gyldesdowne tho
said y^ traitor Godwyn unto Alured. Take hepe about you both on the left
side and on the right side / and of all ye shall be king / and of such an
hundred mod Now forsothe said Alured / I behyght you and if I be king / I shall
ordeyne and make such laws / whereof god and man shall be well apayed. Now had
the tray tour commanded all his men that were with him / that when they were
comen upon Gyldesdown that they should slay all that were in Aluredes company /
that came with him from Normandy / and after that take Alured and led him in
to y^ isle of Ely and after put out both his eyes of his heed / and afterward
bring him to death. And so they did / for they slew all y^ company that were
there / the nombre of. xij gentylmen y^ were comen with Alured from Normandy /
and after they took Alured and in the isle of Ely they put out his eyes and rent
his womb / and took y^ chief of his bowels / and put a stake in to the ground
/ and an end of the bowels fastened thereto / and with nedyls of yren they
pricked y^ good thylde / and so made him to go about the stake till yt all his
bowels were drawn out of his body / and so dyed Alured there through treason
of the earl Godwyne. When the lords of England had herd and wist how Alured
that should have been their king was put to death through the false traitor
Godwyne / they were wonders wroth / and swore between them god and his holy
name / that he should dye a worse death tha^ did Edryth of stration y^ had
betrayed his lord Edmund Iren side / and they would have put him to death but
the traitor fled thens in to Denmark / and there held him.iiij. year and
more / and lost all his land in England.

SIluester the third was pope after Benedictus. This Siluester was chosen /
and Benedict was expulsed. And afterward was Siluester expulsed and Benedict
was put up again. And after he was put out / and Gregory was made pope / and he
was but simple lettred man / and therefore he chose an other pope to be
consecrate with him. And when many men were dyspleased with this guydyng of two
popes / the third was brought in / the which should occupy y^ place of both
y^ two. And so they strove among them self. But Henry the emperor than came
to Rome and deposed them all / and made Clement the second pope / whom he made
anon to crown him. And he said to the Romans they should never without his
assent chose pope And so.v. being popes / the syxth was put in. But many men
say this Grego ry was an holy man. Damasus the second was after Clement.xxiij.
days. This man was an usurper of y^ popery che / and he dyed suddenly. And
anon the Romans asked to have a pope / and that the Almayns should have none
/ for they were so hard herted that they might not enclyne to the intent of y^
emperout the which said there should be no pope chosen but if he would be of
counseyle of the eleccyon. But for all that they put in this holy man Leo / and
after he had of that conscience / and refused it. And anon he was chosen by y^
common assent. This Leo put Christ in the form of a lasar in to his own bed
/ and on the morrow he found no thing there.

Of saint Edward the confessor that was Aluredes brother / and how he was
king of England.
ANd wha^ this was done / all the barons of england sent another time in to
Normandy y^ Edward should come in to england with much ^onout. And this
Edward in his chyldhode loved (...) hey god and him dradde / and in honest
and clennes ladde his life / and hated sin as death. And when he was crow ned
and anointed with a ryall power / he forgate not his good manners and condicyons
that he first used / and forgate not all good customs for no manner honor / ne
for no richesse / ne for no manner hygnes. But ever more and more gave him to
goodness and well loved god and holy church passing all other manner thing. And
poor men also he loved / and held them as they had been his own brethren /
and to them often he gave great alms with full good will.

Of the first special love that god showed to saint Edward living.
IT befell on a day as he went from the church of westmynster / and had herd
mass of saint John ye euangelyst for as much as he loved saint John the
evangelist more specially after god and our lady / than he did any other saint.
And so there came to him a pilgrim / and prayed him for ye love of god and our
lady and saint John the euangelyst some good for to give him. And the king
pryuely took his ring of his finger / yt no man perceived it / and gave it to
the pilgrym / and he it received and went thens. This king Edward made all ye
good laws of England / that yet ben most used and holden. And he was so
mercyable and so full of pity / that no man might be more.

How the earl Godwyn came again in to England / and had again all his land
/ and afterward saint Edward wedded his daughter.
When the earl Godwyn that was dwelling in Denmark had much herd of the
goodness of king Edward / and that he was full of mercy and pity / he thought
yt he would go again in to England for to seek and to have grace of the good
king Edward that so mercy full was that he might have again his land in peace.
And arrayed him as much as he might and put him toward the sea and came in to
England to London where ye king was that time and all the lords of England
and held a parlyame^t Godwyn sent to them yt were his friends / and were ye
most gretest lords of the lord / and prayed them to beseech ye kings grace
for him / and that he would grant him his peace and his lord. The lords lad
hy^ before ye king to seek his grace. And anon as ye king saw him / he
appeled him of treason / and of the death of Alured his brother / and these
words to him said Traitor Godwyn I the appele that thou have betrayed and
slain my brother Alured. Certes sir said Godwyn save your grace and your peace
and your lordshyp I never betrayed him / ^e yet lewe hy^. And therefore I put me
in reward of the caurte. Now fair lords said ye king / ye that be my lyeges
/ earls and barons of the land yt here ben assembled / full well ye herd mine
appele / and the answer also of Godwyn / and therefore I will that ye awarde
and do right. The earls and barons than gadred them all together to do this
awarde by themself / and so they spoke die uersly among them / for some said
there was never alyau^ce by homage serment service / nor by lordshyp between
Godwyn and Alured / for which thing they might him draw. And at the last
they devised and demed / that he should put him in ye kings mercy all together.
Tha^ sna ke the earl Leuerike of Couentre a good man to god and to all the
world / and told his reason in this manner and said. The earl Godwyn is ye best
frended man of England after ye king / and well might it not be gaynsayd /
that without course isle of Godwyn Alured was never put to death wherefore I
awarde as touching my part / that himself and his sone and every of us.xii.
earls that been his friends go before the king / charged with as much gold
and silver as we may bear between our hands / prayenge the king to forgive
his evil will to the earl Godwyn and receive his homage / and yield again his
land. And they accorded unto that awarde / and came every of them with gold
and silver as much as they might bear between their hands before the king /
and there said the form and the manner of their accord and of their awarde.
The king would not them gaynsaye but as much as they had ordained he granted
and co^fermed. And so was the earl Godwyn accorded with the king / and had
again all his lands. And afterward he bare him so well and so wisely / that
the king loved him wonders much / and with him he was full preuy. And within
a little time they loved so much that ye king spoused Godwyns daughter / and
made her queen. And nevertheless though the king had a wife yet he lived ever in
chastity and clennes of body without any flesshely deed doing with his wife. And
ye queen also in her half ladde an holy life two year / and dyed And
afterward the king lived all his life without any wife. The king gave the
erledome of Oxford to Harolde that was Godwyns sone / and made him earl. And so
well they were beloved / both ye fader and he / and were so preuy with the
king / yt they might do by right what thing they would. For against right
would he no thing do for no manner man so good and true he was of conscience.
And therefore our lord Jesus Christ special love showed to him.

How king Edward saw ^^wyne king of Denmark drowned in the sea in the time
of the leuacyon of the sacrament as he stood and herd mass.
IT befell upon a whytsondaye as king Edward herd his mass in the great
church of Westmynster at the leuacion of Jesus Christ's body: and as all men
were gadred in the church / and came nigh the awter for to se ye sacrynge the
king lift up his hands on high / and took up a great laughter / wherefore all
yt stood about him began greatly to wonder. And after mass they asked why the
ky^ges laughter was. Fair lords said king Edward / I saw Swyne ye younger
that was king of Denmark come in to the sea with all his power for to have comen
in to England to war upon us / and I saw him and all his folk drowned in
the sea / and all this I saw in the leuacyon of Christ's body between the
priests hands / and I had thereof so great wye that I might not my laughter
withholde. And the earl Leuerich stood beside him at the leuacion / and openly
saw the form of breed turn in to ye lykenes of a young child / and took up
his right hand and blyssed the king / and afterward ye earl / and the earl
anon turned him toward ye king for to make him se that holy sight. And than
said the king. Sir earl I so well that ye se / thanked be god that I have
honored my god and savior vysybly Jesus Christ in form of man / whose na me
be blyssed in all worlds. Amen.

How the ring that saint Edward had given to a poor pilgrim for ye love of
god and saint John the euangelyst came again to king Edward.
THis noble man saint Edward reigned.xiii. year. And thus it be fell upon a
time or he dyed / ye two men of England were gone in to ye holy land and had
done their pilgrymage / and were going again in to their own country where
they came fro. And as they went in the way / they met a pilgrym that
curteysly salewed them / and asked of them in what land and in what country
they were borne. And they said in England Than asked he who was king of
England. And they answered and said / the good king Edward. Fair friends said
the pilgrim / when that ye come in to your country again / I pray you that
ye will go unto king Edward / and greet him oftentimes in my name / and
oftenty mes him thank of his great curteysy yt he to me has done / and namely
for ye ryng yt he gave me when he had herd mass at Westmynster for saint
John's love ye eua^gelyst. And than took ye ring and took it to the pylgryms
and said. I pray you go and bear this ryng / and take it unto king Edward /
and tell him that I send it him and a full rich gift I will give him For
upon the.xij. day he shall come to me and evermore dwell in bliss wtouten
end. Sir said ye pilgryms / what man be ye and in what country is your
dwelling. Fair friends said he / I am John the euangelyst / and I am
dwelling with almighty god / and your king Edward is my friend / and I love
him in special for because that he has evermore lived in clennes and is a
clean maid / and I pray you my message to fulfill as I have said. When saint
John ye eua^gelyst had thus charged them / suddenly he voyded out of both
their sightes. Than thanked ye pylgryms almighty god and went forth their way.
And when they had gone two or three mile they began to ware weary / and set them
down for to rest them / and so they fell on sleep. And when they had well
slepte / one of them awoke and lift up his heed and looked about and said to
his fellow. Arise up and go we in our way. What said that our fellow to that
other where be we now. Certes said ye other / it seems me yt this is not ye
same country that we laid us ^owne in for to rest and sleep. For we were from
Jerusalem but three miles. They took up their hands and blyssed them / and went
forth on their way / and as they went they saw shepes herdes going with their
sheep that spoke none other language but englisshe. Good friends said one of ye
pylgryms / what country is this / and who is lord thereof. And anon the
shepeherdes answered and said This is the country of Kent in England of the
which the good king Edward is lord of. Than the pilgryms thanked almighty
god and saint John ye euangelyst / and went forth on their way and came to
Caunterbury / and from thens to London / and there they found the king. And
told him all from ye beginning to the ending / as much as saint John had
charged them / and of all things how they had spe^dde by ye way / and took ye
ring to king Edward / and he received it / and thanked almighty god and saint
John ye euan gelyst. And than made him ready every day from day to day to
depart out of this life when god would send for him.

How saint Edward dyed on the.xij. day.
ANd after it befell thus on Christ mass even as the holy man Edward was at
gods service for to here matyns of ye high feast / he became full seek / and
on the morrow endured with much pain for to here ye mass / and after mass he
let him to be ladde in to his chamber there for to rest him. But in his hall
among his barons and knights might he not come for to comfort them and
solace as he was wont to do at that worthy feast. Wherefore all their mirth and
comfort among all that were in the hall was turned in to care and sorrow /
because they drad to lose their good lord ye king And upon saint John's day ye
euangelyst that came next the king received his ryghtes of holy church / as
it befalls to every christen man / and abode the mercy and the will of god.
And ye two pylgryms he let come before him / and gave them rich gifts and
betoke them to god And also ye abbot of Westmynster he let come before him /
and took him that ryng in the honor of god and saint Mary and of saint John
the euangelyst. And the abbot took and put it among other relykes / so that it
is at Westmynster and ever shall be. And so lay ye king seek till the.xij.
even / and than dyed the good king Edward at Westmynster / and there he lies.
For whose love god has showed many a fair miracle. And this was in ye year of
ye incarnacyon of our lord Christ Jesus. M.lxv. And after he was translated and
put in to the shryne by ye noble martyr saint Thomas of Caunterbury.

^Ictor the second was pope after Leo / and little of hy^ is written. Henry the
second was emperor after the first Henry.xvij. year. This man was cosyn to
Conrade / and he was borne in a wode / and twyes taken to be slain wha^ he was
a child / but god defended hy^ evermore. When he was made emperor he made a
monastery in ye same place in the wode where he was borne. This man was a
vicyous man / and he entered in to Ytaly / and there he took Pandulphus ye
prince of Campany. Ste phanus the.ix. was pope after Victor.ix. months.
Benedictus was after hy^ and he took the dignite of ye pope Stephen by
strength / and kept it.ix. months / and than decessed. Henry the third was
emperor after Henry the second. This Henry was an vnquyete man / and many
times troubled the holy man Gregory the.vij. And first he asked forgyuenes and
was assoyled / but he perseuered not / but brought in an other pope against him
/ and said he was an heretyke. And Gregory cursed him. And the chosers of the
emperor chose the duke of Saxon for to be emperor / whom this Henry in
battle overcame. And than he came to Rome with his pope / and pursued pope
Gregory and the cardynals also. And than anon Robert ye king of Naples drove
him thens / and delivered the pope and his cardynals. Nevertheless yet he was
a man of great alms / and.xij. times he fought in battle. And at ye last he
dyed wretchedly. For he was put down by his own sone. For so as he did to
other men / so was he done to. Nycolas the second was pope after Benedicte two
year. This Nycolas called a counsel against the archedeken of Turonosens
which was an heretyke / and he taught against the faith. For he erred in the
sa crament / and after he was converted and was an holy man / but he could
never co^uerte his discyples. Nota. Alexander the second was pope after
hy^.xij. year. This Alexander was an holy man / and he ordained that under
pain of cursynge that no man should here a priests mass whom they knew had
a ^^man. Vt p^ xxxij. did. preter hoc. He had strife with one Codulo / but he
expulsed hy^ as an usurper / and put him out as a symoner.

How Harolde that was Godwyns sone was made king / and how he escaped fro the
duke of Normandy.
When ^ay^t Edward was gone out of this world / and was passed to god / and
worthily buried as it apperteyned to such a great lord for to be. The barons
of the land would have had Edward Helingus / sone to Edward y^ outlawe that
was Edmu^d Irensydes sone to be kyngr / because he was of y^ most kyndest
kings blood of y^ realm. But Harold through the earl Godwyn his fader and
through other great lords of y^ realm that were of his kynne / seized all
England in to his hands / and anon let crown him king after the buryenge of
saint Edward. This Hatold y^ was Godwyns sone two year before saint Edward dyed
he would have gone in to Flau^dres / but he was driven by tempest in to the
country of Pountyf / and there he was taken and brought to duke Willyam. And
this Harold wend that duke Willyam would have been avenged on hy^ / because
that Haroldes fader had let slay Alured saint Edwardes brother / and pryncypally
because Alured was sone to queen Emma that was Rychardes mother duke of Normandy
y^ was grandfader to duke Willyam. Nevertheless he did not so / for as much
as Harold was a noble and a wise knight / and that his fader and he were
accorded with saint Edward / therefore he would not mysdo him / but allowed all
thing ordained between them. Harold by his good will swear upon a book and
upon holy saints that he should spouse and wedde duke Wyllyams daughter after
the death of saint Edward / and y^ he should do his besy cure to save and keep
y^ realm of England unto y^ profit and auau^tage of duke William. And wha^
Harold had thus made his oath unto duke William he let him go free out of
prison / and gave hy^ many rich gifts. And than he departed thens and came in
to England / and anon did in this manner wha^ saint Edward was deed as a falls
forsworn man let crown himself king of England and falsely brake the
covenant y^ he had made before with duke Willyam / wherefore he was wonders
wroth with him and swore that he would be avenged upon him what someuer him
befell. And anon duke Willyam let assemble a great host and came in to
England to avenge him upon Harold / and to conquer y^ land if that he might.
And in y^ same year that Harold was crowned Harald Hare strenge king of
Denmark arrived in Scotlonde / and thought to have been king of England / and
he came in to England and robbed and slew all y^ he might / till y^ he came to
York / and there he slew a. M. men of arms / and an hundred priests. When
these tidings came to y^ king he assembled a great power / and went for to
fight with Haralde of Denmark / and with his own hands he slew him / and
the danes were discomfyted. And those that were left alive with much sorrow
fled to their ships. And thus king Harold of England slew king Harald of
Denmark.

Here came the Normans and expulsed Harold a Saxon. Wilhelums conquestor.

Anno dn^i. M.lxvj.
How Willyam bastard duke of Normandy came in to England and slew king
Harolde.
ANd wha^ this battle was done Harolde became so proud that he would no
thing part with his people of any thing y^ he had gotten / but held it all to
himself / wherefore y^ most part of his people were wroth and departed from
him / so that only were left with him but his soudyours. And upon a day as he
sat at meet / a messenger came to him and said that William bastard duke of
Normandy was arrived in England with a great host / and had taken all the
land about Hastynges / and also mined the castle. When y^ king had herd
these tidings / he went thither with a small power in all the haste y^ he might
for there was but few people left with him. And when he was comen thither he
ordained to give battle to the duke Wyllyam. But y^ duke asked hy^ of these
three things / if that he would have his daughter to wife as he had promised and
sworn his oath / or that he would hold the land of him in truage / or that
he would determyne this thing in battle This Harold was a proud man and a
strong / and trusted much in his strength and fought with ye duke Willyam and
his people. But Harolde and his men were discomfyted in that battle / and
himself there was slain. And this battle was ended at Toubrydge in the
second year of his regne / upon saint Calixtes day / and so he was buried at
waltham.

Of king Willyam bastard / and how he governed him well and wisely / and of
the war between him and the king of France.
When Wyllyam bastard duke of Normandy had conquered all y^ land of England /
upon Chrystmasse day next following he let him to be crowned king at
westmynster / and was a worthy king / and gave to englyssh men lands largely /
and to his knights. And afterward he went over the sea and came in to
Normandy / and there dwelled a while. And in the second year of his regne he
came again in to England / and brought with him Maude his wife / and let crown
her queen of England on whyt sunday. And than anon after y^ king of Scotlond
that was called Mancolyn began to strive and war with the king William. And
he ordained him toward Scotlond with his men both by land and by see for to
destroy king Mancolyn. But they were accorded / and the king of Scotlonde
became his man / and held all his land of him. And king William received of
him his homage and came again in to England. And when king William had
reigned.xvij. year / Maude the queen dyed / on whom king Wyllyam had begoten
many fair children / that is to say / Robert Curtoys / William Rous /
Richard also that dyed / Henry Beauclerk / and Maude also that was the earls
wife of Bleynes / and other four fair daughters. And after his wives death
there began great debate between him and Philyp the king of France. But at the
last they were accorded. And than dwelled y^ king of England in Normandy / and
no man him warred / and he no man long time. And the king of France said upon
a day in scorn of king William / y^ he had long time lain in chyldbed / and
long time had rested him there. And this word came to y^ king of England
where as he lay in Normandy at Roen. And for this word was he evil appayed
and also wonders wroth toward the king of France and swore by god that when he
were arysen fro chyldbedde he would light a thousand candels to the king of
France. And anon let assemble a great host of Normans and of Englyssh men.
And in the beginning of heruest he came in to France / and brent all the
towns that he came by through all the ^on^tree / and robbed and did all the
sorrow that he might through out al France / and at the last he brent the cite
of Mandos / and commanded his people to bear wode and brenne as much as they
might / and him self help thereto all y^ he might with a good will. And there was
great hete what of fire that was so great and of the son / y^ it was wonders
hot / and stuffed hy^ so y^ he became and fell in to a great sekenes. And when
he saw y^ he was so sore seek / he assygned all Normandy to Robert Curtoys his
sone / and all England to William Rous / and bequethed to Henry Beauclerk all
his tresour. And when he had thus done / he received all the sacraments of
holy church / and dyed the.xxij. year of his regne / and lies at Cane in
Normandy.

Anno domini. M.lxvj.
O Regory the.vii. was pope after Alexander.xij. year. This man ordained a
general sinody / that no priest should have a wife / ne should dwell with women
/ but those that y^ synody of Nicena and other decrees have suffered. And than
the priests set little or naught by his ordinance. This man commanded y^ no
man should here mass of a priest y^ had a co^cubyne. And he on a certain time
as he was cardynall and legate of France proceeded sharply against prelates and
priests y^ were symoners. And among other there was one bishop that was
greatly famed with symony / and those y^ accused him he hired pryuely to say y^
contrary / the which y^ legate conceived / and before all y^ people he said.
Let the judgment of this man cease at this time / for it is deceyuable / and
let god dispose for it / and said thus. It is certain that y^ dignite of a
bishop is the gyuer of y^ holy ghost And who someuer byeth a bisshopryche does
against the holy ghoost. Than if thou bishop did not against the holy ghoost /
say openly before all the people Gloria patri et filio / et spiritui saucto.
And many times he began to say it / but he could never speak spiritui sancto
Than he was deposed of his bysshopryche. And after he could speak it well
enough. Victor the third was pope after him one year. And this man was
poisoned with venym in y^ chalyce. Vrbanus was pope after him two year. This man
cursed the king of France for his aduoutry. And he called a counseyle at
Claru^ / in y^ which he ordained that matyns of our lady should be said every
day / and on Saterdaye her solemn mass. And it is said that this was showed
unto the monks of Charterhous. Also he called another couuseyle at Turam / for
the holy land to be won again / and provoked the people to that thing. And
within a little time after that / the holy land was recovered and the glorious
sepulere of our lord Jesus Christ / and Anthiochia with many other noble cytees
were taken from y^ hands of y^ sarasyns. And it is said and men byle ued
that.CC. M. chryste^ men went to y^ Journey. For there went of states old men
and young / rich and poor / and no man co^ pelled them. And this passage was
made by y^ visyon of our lady. And y^ pry^ces of this people were diverse. One
was Godfrey of Bollyon y^ noblest man of all the world / and a virtuous man.
And an other was Bemond y^ duke of Naples. The third was Hugh the kings
brother of France / and many other the which did full nobly for the faith of
god. And it were to long in this book to recherse the glorious acts that they
did.

Of king Willyam Rous that was king Wyllyam bastardes sone / that destroyed
towns and houses of relygyon for to make the new forest.
ANd after this Willyam bastard reigned his sone Willyam Rous This Willyam was a
wonders co^tratyous man to god and holy church / and let amend and make y^
town of Cardeis / that the paynyms had destroyed. This king Willyam destroyed
holy church and their possessions in what part he might fyn be them. And
therefore there was so much debate between him and the archebysshop of
Caunterbury Ancelme / because he cepreued hy^ of his wyckednes that he
destroyed holy chitche. And for y^ cause y^ king bare to him great wrath and
therefore exiled him out of this lord And the archebysshop than went to the
court of Rome / and there dwelled with y^ pope. And this king made the new
forest / and kest down and destroyed.xxvj. towns / and.lxxx. houses of
religion / all for to make his forest longet and brother / and became wonders
proud and glad of his wode and forest / and of y^ wild beestes that were
within it / that it was manuayle to wit / so that men called him kepet of
wodes and pastors. And the longer that helyued / the more wicked he became /
both to god and to all holy church / and to all his nien. And this king let
make the great hall of Westmynster. So upon a day at whytsontyde he held
therein his first feast / and he looked about him and said that y^ hall was to
little by y^ halfedele. And at the last he became so co^traryous that all
thing y^ pleased god displeased him / and all thing y^ god loved he hated
de^dly. And so it befell that he dremed upon a night alytel or y^ he dyed /
that he was let blood / and b^^dde a great quantite of blood / and a streme of
it ^epte ^n hye toward hellen more than (...) ^^deed fadom / and the clerenes
of the day was (...) ned unto ^yght and derknes / and the (...)ament also. And
when he awoke he had great dread / so that he wist not what to do / and told
his dreme to men of his coun seyle / and said that he had great dread / and
supposed that to him was some myschaunce to come. And y^ second night before a
monk dremed of the household that the king went in to a church with much
people / and he was so proud / that he despised all y^ people that were with
him / and that he took the image of the crucyfyxe and shamefully bote it with
his tethe. And the crucifyxe mekely suffered all that he did. But the king as a
wood man rent of the arms of the crucyfyxe / and kest it under his feet and
defouled it / and threw it all abroad. And a great flame of fire came out of
the crucyfyxe mouth. Of the which dreme many men had great marvel and
wonder. The good man that had dremed this strange dreme told it to a knight
that was most preuy with the king of all men / and the knight was called
Hanumdes. Soon the monk and he told the dreme unto the king / and said that
it should betoken other thing than good. And nevertheless y^ king laughed
therac twyes or thryes / and little set thereby / and thought that he would go
and hunte and play in the forest. And men counseyled him that he should not go
that day for no manner thing / ne come in y^ wode / so that he abode at home
before meet. But anon as he had eten / no man might let him but that he would
go unto y^ wode for to have his dysporte. And so it befell that one of his
knights that hyghte Walter Tyrell would have short to a great heart / and his
arowe glansed upon a branch / and through mysauenture smote the king unto
the heart. And so he fell down deed to the ground without any word speaking
/ and so ended his life days. And it was no mecuayle for the day that he dyed
he had let to ^erme the archebysshopryche of Caunterbury / and.xij. abbeys also
/ and ever more did great destruccyon to holy church through wrongful taking
and askyng. For no man durst withsta^de that he would have done / and of his
^ewdnes he would never wtdrawe / neither amend his life. And therefore god
would suffer him no longer to regne in his wyckednes. And he had been king.xiij.
year and vj. wekes / and lies at Westmynster.

PAscall was pope after Vrbanus xviij. year and.v. months / the which
the.xiij. year of his bysshoprych with his cardynais was put in prison by the
emperor Henry the fourth. And they might not be delivered till ye pope had
sworn yt he should keep peace with him / and that he should never curse him.
And on that promise the pope gave the emperor a preuylege. And ye year after
the pope dampened that preuplege / and said on this wise. Let us comprehend all
holy scripture the old testament and the new / the laws and the prophets /
the gospel and the canons of apostles / and all the decrees of the popes of
Rome / that ye they held I hold / and that that they dampened I dampne / and
most specially that preuy lege granted to Henry the emperor / the which
rather is granted to venge his malice / than to multyply his pacyence in
virtue / for evermore I dampne that same preuylege.

Of king Henry beauclerke yt was Willyam Rous brother / and of ye debate between
him and Robert Curtoys his brother.
ANd when this Willyam Rous was deed / Henry beauclerk his brother was made
king / because that William Rous had no child (...) of his body / and this
Henry Beauclerk was crowned king at London ye fourth day after that his brother
was deed / that is is say / the fyfth day of August. And anon as Ancelme yt
was archebysshop of Caunterbury being at the court of Rome herd tell yt
Wyllyam Rous was deed / he came again in to England / and king Henry
Beauclerk welcomed him honorably. And ye first year yt he reigned he spoused
Maude yt was Margaretes daughter the queen of Scotlo^de / and the archebysshop
Ancelme of Caunterbury wedded them. And this king begat upon his wife two
sons and a daughter / that is to say / Willyam and Rychard and Maude. And
this Maude was afterward the empress of Almayn. And in the second year of
his regne / his brother Robert Curtoys duke of Normandy came with an huge host in
to England for ^^ challenge ye land. But through counsel of the wise men of
the land / they were accorded in this manner. That the king should gyVe his
brother ye duke a. M. pound every year / and which of them lived longest should
be others heir / and so between them should be no debate nor strife. And when
they were thus accorded / ye duke went home again in to Normandy. And when the
king had reigned four year there arose a great debate between him and ye
archebysshop of Canterbury Ancelme. For because that ye archebysshop would not
grau^^e him to take talage of chirches at his will / and therefore the
archebysshop Ancelme went again over the sea unto the court of Rome / and
there he dwelled with the pope. And in the same year the duke of Normandy came in
to England to speak with his brother. And among all other things ye duke of
Nor mandy forgave unto ye king his brother the foresaid. M. pound yt he should
pay unto the duke. And with good love the king and the duke departed / and
than the duke went again in to Normandy. And when two year were gone / through
the entycement of the devil and of lewd men a great debate arose between the
king and the duke / so that through counseyle the king went over the sea in
to Normandy. And wha^ the king was comen in to Normandy / all the great lords
of Normandy turned unto ye king of England / and held against the duke their
own lord / and forsook hy^ / yeldyng them unto the king / with all the good
castles and towns of Normandy. And soon after was the duke taken and led with
the king in to England / and the king let put the duke in to prison. And this
was ye vengeance of god. For when the duke was in the holy land / god gave
him such might and grace / that he was chosen for to have been king of
Jerusalem / and he forsook it / and would not take it upon him And therefore god
sent him that shame and despyte for to be put in to his broders prison. Tha^
ceased king Henry all Normandy in to his hands / and held it all his life
time. And in the same year came ye bishop Ancelme from ye court of Rome in to
England again. And the king and he were accorded. And in ye year next
coming after there began a great debate between king Philyp of France and
king Henry of England. Wherefore king Henry went in to Normandy / and there was
^ro^ge war between them two. And than dyed the king of France and Lowys his
sone was made king anon after his death. And than went king Henry again in
to England / and married ^a^de his daughter to Henry the emperor of Almayne.

Of the debate yt was between king Lowys of France and king Henry of England
/ and how king Henryes two sons were drowned in the hy^ se^.
When king Henry had been king xvij. year / a great debate arose between king
Lowys of France and king Henry of England / because the king had sent in
to Normandy to his men that they should be helping un to the earl of Bloyes as
much as they might in war against the king of France / and that they
should be as ready to him as they were to their own lord / for because that ye
earl had spoused his sister dame Maude. And for this cause the king of France
did much sorrow to Normandy. Wherefore ye king of England was wonders wroth
/ and in ha(...) went over the sea with a great power / and came in to Normandy
for to defend that land. And ye war between them lasted two year / till at
the last they two fought together / and the king of France was dyscomfyted /
and escaped away with much pain / and the most part of his men were
discomfyted and taken And the king did with them his pleasure / and some of
them he let go freely / and some he let put to death. But afterward the two
kings were accorded. When king Henry had hoolly all the lord of Normandy and
discomfyted his enemies of France / he returned again in to England with
much honor. And his two sons Willyam and Rychard would have comen after
their fader and went to the sea with a great company of people. But or yt they
might come to lord ye ship stroke against a roche and brake in pieces / and
were all drowned yt were therein / save one m^ yt was in ye same ship y^

kings daughter / ye countess of perches / ye ky^ges nece / ye countess of

Joy was turned in to mourning and sorrow.

How Maude ye empress came again in to england / and how she was afterward
wedded to Geffrey the earl of Angeo.
ANd when two year were gone that the earl had dwelled with ye king / the earl
went from ye king and began to war upon him / and did much harm in the
land of Normandy / and took there a strong castle / and there he dwelled all
ye year. And than came to him tidings that Henry the emperor of Almayne yt
had spoused Maude his daughter was deed / and that she dwelled no longer in
Almayn / and that she would come again in to Normandy to her fader. And wha^
she was comen unto him / he took her than to him and came again in to England
/ and made ye englysshmen to do oath and feaute unto the empress. And ye first
man that made the oath was Wylliam the arche bishop of Canterbury / and that
other David king of Scotlonde / and after him all the lords and barons of
England. Also after that the noble earl of Angeo a worthy knight sent unto the
king of England yt he would grant hy^ to have his daughter Maud ye empress
to wife And because yt her fader wist yt he was a noble man / the king
granted him / and consented thereto. And than took he his daughter and ladde
her in to Normandy / and came to ye noble knight Geffrey / and there he spoused
ye foresaid Maude with much honor. And the earl begat upon her a sone yt was
called Henry ye empress sone And after wha^ all this was done / king Henry
dwelled all ye year in Normandy. And after that a long time a grievous sekenes
took hy^ where through he dyed And this king Henry reigned.xxxv. year and.iiij.
months. His heart was buried in the great church of our lady in Roen. And
his body was brought with much honor in to England / and buried in the abbey
of Redynge / of yt which he was founder.

HEnricus ye fourth was emperor in Almayn after Henry the third xv. year. This
man put his own fader in prison / and there held him till he dyed He took
pope Pascall with his cardynalles and prysoned them / as is said before / for the
which cause (as it is supposed) he lacked issue. For he wedded the kings
daughter of England Maude. But afterward he came to grace / and all the laws
of the church he resygned freely to Calixte the pope / and be^ought him to give
him in penance that he should never come again to his empire / that he might
have remyssyon of his trespace. And after the opinion of many a man / he was
wylfully exiled / and both he and his wife dyed at Chestre in England.
Gelasius was pope after Pascall two year / and fled from Henry the emperor
in to Burgoyn / and there decessed. This emperor chose Benedicte a Spanyarde
to be pope / the which strove with Calixtus. Calixtus was pope after him two
year and five months. This Calixtus was the sone of the duke of Burgoyne /
and was chosen in the place of Gelasius. And when he should come to Rome / he
took ye foresaid Benedictus / and made him to ride before him shamefully. For he
on a mule turned his face to the tail of ye mule / and held the tail in his
hand as a bry^^^ till he came through the cite / and than he was put in
prison. And the pope made peace with the emperor. Honorius was pope after him
two year / and little of him is written. Nora. Henry the fourth Emperor of
Ann^yne decessed this time / and was buried with his proge^ytours after some
men with such an epi^aphe. Filius hic / pater hic / auus hic / proauus ^acer
istis. But it is lykely to be truer that ye Gerald says in Itinerario wallie.
where he says / that after he had prysoned his carnal fader and his
spirytuall fader the pope with his cardynals / after he was reconsyled / and
wylfully he was exiled. And he left Maude his wife the kings daughter of
England pryuely / and lived an heremytes life at Chestre.x. year / where he
might live as no man knew him / and he called himself Godiscallus / the
which godson is called. So the emperor went secretly away / and Maude his
wife the empress went to her fader Henry in to Normandy / where anon after
she was wedded unto Geffrey plantagines the duke of Andega^me / upon whom he
begat Henry the second that afterward was king of England / under whom
saint Thomas of Canterbury reigned and dyed. Lotharius was emperor after Henry
the fourth.xij. year. And little of him is written / but that he was manerly to
the church / and that he subdued Roger the usurper of the kingdom of Cycyle.
^ag^ de sancto Victore was a noble man this time at Paris and a noble doctor
of ye nacyon of Saxons. The order of saint John baptyst at Jerusalem began this
time by ye worshypfull man Raymond / myghtely disposed unto the works of
mercy. All this order made their way to serve poor men.

Anno domini. M.C.xxxiiij.
INnocencius was pope aftre Honorius.xiiij. year and.vij. months This man was
a very devout man / and with such men he copanyed him. And he had strife.vij.
year against Pyers of Lion / yt which named him Anoc^e^u^ / and by strength he
took the poperyche / the which Innocent saw / and with two galeys fled in to
France / and was worshipfully received of saint Bernard / the which that time
had all the kings and princes in his hands / and he provoked them for to
bring this pope Innocent in to his dignite again. At ye last all thing was
cessed / and his enemies were destroyed through the judgment of god / and he
was pope again / and lived profytably / and was buried at saint John de Latran.

and besyeged the empress ye than was at Oxford. And the syege endured fro
Myghelmasse unto saint Andrews time. And ye empress than let clothe her all
in white l^nen cloth / for because she would not be know(...). For in the same
time was much ^^owe and so she escaped by the Tamyse from her enemies. And
from thens she went to Walyngforde / and there held her. And the king would
have besyeged her / but he had so much to do with the earl Randulf of Chestre

taken. And when this was done / ye earl Robert and all the kings enemies went
unto Faringdon / and began there to make a strong castle. But ye king came
thither with a strong power and drove him thens. And in ye same year the earl

Theobalde and other worthy lords of England / upon this co^dicyon / that they
should depart the realm of England between them / so that Henry the empress
sone should holly have the half of all ye land of England. And thus they

archebysshop upon Chrystmasse day as he sat at his meet and these words said.
That if he had any good knights with him / he had been many a day passed avenged
upon ye archebysshop Thomas. And anon sir Willya^ Breton / sir Hugh Moruyle /

in to the holy land / and rested not till that he came forth in his way unto
Cipers / and took it with great force. And after that king Rychard went forth
toward the holy land / and gate there as much as the christen men had lost
before / and conquered the land again through great might / save only the
holy cross. And when king Richard came to the cite of Acres for to get the
cite / there arose a great debate between him and the king of France / so

enemies.
Whiles this king Richard was in prison / the king of France warred upon hy^
strongly in Nor mandy. And John his brother warred upon him in England. But ye
bishops and barons of England withstode him with all ye power that they might
get and took the castle of Wyndsore and other castelles. And the foresaid
John saw that he had no might ne power against the barons of England for to
fight but anon went him over the sea unto the king of France. And when
king Richard came out of prison and was delivered and came in to England
anon after Candelmasse in great haste he went unto Notyngham / and the castle
of Notingham to him was yielded. And than discomfyted he his brother John and all
those that held with him. And after he went unto the cite of Wynchestre and
there he let him to be crowned king of England. And after he went unto Nor
mandy for to war upon the king of France. And when the king of France
herd that / he came with fyur hundred knights toward Gysors. And king
Richard met him and would have given him battle. But the king of France
anon fled / and an hundred of his knights were taken and two hondre horses
that were trapped with y^en And anon after went king Rychard for to besyege
the castle Gayllard. And upon a day as he rode by the castle for to take
auysement of the castle one of the arbalastres smore him with a quarrel that
was enuenymed. And king Richard drew out the shafte of the quarrel but the
quarelles heed abode still in his heed / and it began for to rankle / that he
might not help himself ne meue his arms. And when he wist that he had dethes
wound upon him / and that he might not be hole for no manner thing he
commanded anon all his men sharply to assail the castle / so ye the castle
was taken or ye he dyed / and so ma^ly his men did that all were taken ye were
wtin. And the king did with them his will / and commanded his men to bry^ge
before hy^ the man ye so had wounded him. And when he came before him the king
asked him what was his name. And he said my name is Bertra^ gurdon. Wherefore
(said ye king) have ye slain me / sith I did ye never no harm. Sir said he /
though ye did me never none harm / ye your self with your hands slew my fader
and my brother / and I therefore have quytte you now your travail. Than said
king Rychard / he ye dyed upon ye cross to bry^ge man's soul fro ye pains
of hell / forgive ye my death / and I also forgive it the. Than he co^mau^ ded
ye no man should mysdo him. But for all ye kings defending / some of his men
followed him / and privily slew him. And the.vj. day after ye king did shryue
hy^ and sore repented him of his misdeeds / and was houseled and anointed / and
had reigned but.ix. year and.xxxix. wekes / and dyed and lies beside his fader

the which he made against master Pyers Lombard the maker of the sentence.
This time decessed the emperor Henry / and the princes of Almayn dyscorded /
for some chose Otto / and some chose Philip brother to Henry. Tha^ Philyp was
falsely slain / and Otto was crowned of Innocent in France / ye which anon
gave battle to the Romans because they gave him no due honor. And for ye
cause against the popes will he took ye kingdom of Apulie from Frederyk /
wherefore the pope cursed him. Than after the fourth year of his regne the
princes of Almayn made Frederyk emperor / and victoryously he subdued Otto.
Wyllyam of Paris this time began the order of ye freres Austyns / the which

the freres prechours began under Dominik / but it might not be co^fermed till
the first year of Honorius.

Of king John that in the first year of his regne lost all Normandy.
Because king Rychard had none heir sone ne daughter after his death: they made
John his brother king / and crowned hy^ at Westmynster by Hubert the
archebysshop of Caunterbury. And when he began to regne / he became so
meruaylous a man ye he went over in to Normandy / and warred upon ye king of
France. And so long they warred togy der till at ye last king John lost all
Normandy and Angeo / wherefore he was sore anoyed: and it was no marvel. Than
let he assemble before hy^ at London archebysshops / bisshops / abbottes and
pryours earls and barons / and held there a great par lyament / and asked
there of the clergy the tenth of every church of England for to conquer
Normandy and Angeo again that he had lost. They would not grant that thing /
wherefore he was wonders wroth. In ye same time dyed Hubert Than the pryour and
the covent of Caunterbury chose against the kings will to be archebysshop
master Stephen of Langton a good clerk / that dwelled at the court of Rome /
and sent to the pope their eletcyon. And the pope confermed it / and sacred him
at Viterbi. When the king wist of these tidings / he was wonders wroth / and
drove the pryour and the coue^t fro Canterbury / and exiled them out of the
land / and commanded ye no lettre nor commandment that came fro Rome should
be received ne pleted in England. When ye pope herd this / he sent to king
John his lettres / and prayed hy^ louyngly to receive Stephen the archebisshop
of Canterbury to his church / and suffer the pryour and his monks to come
again to their own dwelling. But the king would not grant it for no
thing.

How king John would no thing do for ye popes commandment / wherefore all
England was enterdyted and suspended.
ANd at the last ye pope sent by his auctorite / and enjoined to the bishops
of England / ye if the king would not receive the pryour of Canterbury and
his monks / that they should do general enterdytyng through out all England
and granted full power to four bishops to pronounce the enterdytynge if it
were need. The first was bishop Wyllyam of London / and that other bishop
Eustace of Ely / the third was bishop Walter of Wynchestre / and ye fourth
was bishop Gyles of Herford / and these.iiij. bishops prayed ye king knelynge
on their knees and sore weeping that he would do ye popes commandment / and
showed him the popes bulls of ye enterd^^y^g. But for no prayer ye they might
pray he would not consent thereto. wherefore ye bisshops seeing this departed
thens / and on ye morrow of ye Annu^ciacyon of our lady they pronouced ye
general enterdytyng through all England / so ye the church doors were
shette. When ye enterdytyng was pronounced ye king for anger took the four
bishops lands in to his hands / and all ye clergy of england / and ordained
men to keep it / ye the clerks might not have their living. Wherefore ye
bishops cursed all them ye should meddle with the goods of holy church against
ye will of ye owners. Than the iiij. bishops seeing ye malice of ye king went
over ye see to Rome and came to ye archebysshop of Canterbury / and told hy^
all thing. And ye archebysshop bad them return again to Canterbury / and he
would either come or send to them in his stead ye should do as much as if he
hy^self were there. And when ye bishops herd this they returned again in to
England / and came to Canterbury. The tidings came to ye king ye the
bishops were come again to Canterbury / and himself might not come thither ye
time / he sent thither bishops / earls and abbots for to treat with them ye the
king should receive ye archebysshop Stephen / and the pryour and all the monks
of Canterbury / and ye he should never after ye time no thing take of holy
church against ye will of them ye owes the goods / and ye the king should
make full amends to them / of whom he had any goods taken / and ye holy
church should have all frau^chyse / as ferforth as they had in saint Edwardes
time the confessor.

How Stephen of Langton came again in to England through ye popes commandment
/ and how he went again.


When the form of accordement was thus ordained / it was in a pair of
endentures / and they put their seals to y^ one part / and they y^ came in the
kings name put their seals to that other part of the endentures / and four
bishops a fore said took that one part of the endentures to them / and that
other part they bare with them to show to the king. When the king saw ye
form and understood it / he held him full well apayed of al manner things as
they had ordained / saving as touching to make restitucyon again of the
goods to that thing he would not accord / and so he sent word again to the
four vysshops y^ they should put out y^ one point of restitucion. But they
answered yt they would not put out one word. Than sent the king to ye
archebysshop by the four bisshops yt he should come to Canterbury for to speak
with him there / and sent to him safeconduyt under pledges / y^ is to say his
justices Gilbert Poiteuin / William de la Brener / and John fitz Hugh / that in
their co^duyt safely he should come / and go again at his own will. And in this
ma ner the archebysshop Stephen came to Caunterbury. When the archebysshop was
comen / the king came to Chilham for he would come no nere Canterbury at y^
time. But he sent by his tresourer bishop of Wynchestre that he should do out
of the endentures the clause of restitucyon for to make of ye goods. And the
archebysshop made his oath y^ he would not do out one word thereof / ne yet
chau^ ge of that the bishops had spoken and ordained. And than ye archebysshop
went again to Rome without any more doing. King John was than more angryer than
ever he was before / and let make a common cry through out all England that
all those yt had holy chirches rentes and went over ye see / that they should
come again in to England at a certain day or else they should lose all their
rentes for ever more / and that he commanded to every sheryue through out all
England / that they should inquire if any bishop / abbot / pryour / or any
other prelate of holy church / from that day afterward receive any
commandment that comes fro the pope / that they should take ye body and
bring it before him / and that they should take in the kings hands all their
lo^des of holy church that were given to any man by the archebysshop Stephen
or by ye pryour of Canterbury from ye time of ye eleccyon of ye archebysshop.
And commanded that all ye wodes yt were the archebysshops should be casten
down to the ground / and all sold.

How king John destroyed the order of Cisteaux.
ANd in the same year the Irysshe men began to war upon king John / and king
John ordained him for to go in to Irlonde / and let arere an huge tax through
out all England / that is to say.xxxv. thousand mark. And thus he sent
through out all England unto the monks of the order of Cisteaux that they
should help hy o^.vj. M. mark of silver. And they answered and said yt they
durst no thing do without their chief abbot of Cisteaux. Wherefore king John
when he came again from Irlond did them so much sorrow and care yt they wist
not where to abide / for he took so much rau^som of every house of them / that
the sum amou^ted to.ix. M. iij.C. mark / so that they were clean lost and
destroyed / and voyded their houses and their lands through out all England.
And ye abbot of Wauersay drad so much his menace that he forsook ye abbey and
went thens / and pryuely ordained him over ye see to the house of Cisteaux. When
the tidings came to the pope that ye king had done so much malice / than was
he toward the king full wroth / and sent two legates unto ye king / that one
was called Pandulf / and that other Durant / yt they should warn the king in
y^ popes name / that he should cesse of his persecucyon that he did unto holy
church / and amend the wrong and the trespace that he had done to the
archebysshop of Canterbury / and to the pryour and to the monks of
Caunterbury / and to all the clergy of England / and that he should restore
all the goods again yt he had taken of them against their will / or else they
should curse him by name. And to do this thing and to con ferme / the pope
took them his lettres in bulls patentes. These two legates came in to England
/ and came to the king to Northamton / where as he held his parlyame^t / and
full curteysly they him sa lewed and said. Sir we come fro ye pope of Rome /
the peace of holy church and the land to amend. And we admonest you first in
the popes behalf / that y^ make full restitucyon of the goods y^ ye have
rauysshed and taken of holy church and of the land / and that ye receive
Stephen archebysshop of Canterbury in to his dignite and the pryour of
Canterbury and his monks / and that ye yield again unto y^ archebysshop all
his lands and rentes without any with holdyng. And sir yet more over / that ye
shall make rest(...)yo^ unto all holy church / whereof they shall hold them
well apayed. Than answered the king as touching y^ pryour and his monks of
Canterbury / all y^ ye have said I will do gladly / and all thing that ye
will ordeyne. But as touching the archebysshop I shall tell you as it lies in
my heart. That the archebysshop leave his archebysshopryche / and that the pope
than for him would pray / and than upon adventure me should like some other
bysshopryche to give hy^ in England. And upon this co^dicyon I will him
accept and receive. And nevertheless in England as archebysshop if he abide
/ he shall never have so good safeco^du^te but that he shall be taken. Than
said Pandulf unto the king. Sir holy church was never wont to discharge an
archebysshop without cause reasonable. But ever it has be wont to chastyse
princes that to god and holy church were inobedyent. What how now quod the
king / menace ye me. Nay said Pandulf / but ye now openly have told as it
stands in your heart. And to you we will tell what is the popes will. And
thus it stands that he has you holly enterdyted and accursed / for the
wrongs that ye have done to holy church and to ye clergy. And for as much as
ye dwell and be in will to abide in malice and in wretchedues / and will not
come out thereof / (...) to none amendeme^t. ye shall understa^de that this time
afterward ye sentence is upon you given and holds stead and strength and
upon all tho that with you have comoned before this time / whether they be
(...)es barons or knights / or any other what so ever yt they be / we them
assoyle safely unto this day. And fro this time afterward of what condicyon
someuer that they be / we them accurse that with you common any word / and we do
sentence upon them openly and specially. And we assoyle clean earls / barons /
knights / and all other men of their homages / service / and feautees that
they should unto you do. And this thing to co^ferme we give plain power to
the bishop of Wynchestre and to the bishop of Norwyche. And the same power we
give in to Scotlonde to ye bishops of Rochestre and of Salysoury. And in Wales
we give the same power to ye bishops of saint David and of Landaf and of saint
Ass. And more over we send through out all chrystendom / that all ye bishops
beyond the sea / that they do accurse all those that help you or yt any
counsel gives you in any manner need that ye have to do in any part of the
world. And we assoyle all them also by the auctorite of the pope / and
command them also with you to fight as with him that is enemy to all holy
church. Than answered the king / what may ye do more to me. Than answered
Pandulf / we say to you in the word of god / that ye nor none heir that ye
have / never after this day may be crowned. Tha^ said the king / by him that
is almighty and I had wist this before or that ye came in to my land that ye
had brought me such tidings / I should have made you tide all one year. Than
said Pandulf / full well wend we at our first coming that ye would have been
obedyent to god and holy church / and have fulfilled ye popes commandment /
and now we have showed unto you and pronounced the popes will as we were
charged therewith. And as now ye have said / that if ye had wist the cause of
our coming / that ye would have made us ride all an hole year / and as well ye
might have said yt ye would have taken an hole year of respyte by the popes
leave. But for to suffer what death ye could ordeyn / we shall not spare for to
tell you holly all y^ popes message and his will / that we were charged with.

How Pandulf delivered a clerk that had falsed and cou^terfeyted the kings
money before the king himself.
ANd anon the king commanded the sheriues and baylyes of North hamton that
were in ye kings presence that they should bring forth all the prisoners /
that they might be done to death before Pandulf / because ye king wend that
they would have gaynsayd their deeds for cause of death all thing that he had
spoken before. When ye prisoners were comen before the king / the king
commanded some to be hanged / and some to be drawn / and some to draw out
their eyes of their heed. And among all other there was a clerk that had
falsed the kings money. And the king commanded that he should be hanged and
drawn. And when Pandulf herd this commandment of the king / he sterte him
up right quyckly / and anon asked a book and a candell / and would have cursed
the king / and all them that would set upon the clerk any hand. And Paudulf
him self went for to seek a cross. And ye king followed him / and delivered him
ye clerk by ye hand / that he should do with him what he would. And thus was
ye clerk delivered and went thens. And Pandulf and Durant his fellow went from
the king / and came again to the pope of Rome / and told him that king John
would not be amended / but ever abode so accursed. And nevertheless the pope
grasited y^ year through out all England that priests might sing masses in
co uenable chirches / and consecrate our lords body / and give it to seek me^
which were lykely to pass out of this world / and also that men might
thrysten children over all ye land. And when the pope wist and saw yt the
king would not be under the rule of holy church for no manner thing the pope
than sent to the king of france in remissyon of his sins yt he should take with
him all ye power that he might / and go in to England for to destroy king
John. When these tidings came to king John / than was he sore anoyed and sore
drad lest he should lose his realm / and himself be done to death. Than sent
he to the pope messengers / and said he would be iustyfyed / and come to
amendme^t in all things / and would make satisfaccyon to all manner men after
ye popes ordyuau^ce Than sent ye pope again in to england Pandulf and other
messengers / and came to Canterbury to the king / and there abode. And
the.xiij. day of May ye king made an other for to stand to ye popes ordynau^
^e before Pandulf the legate / in all manner of things in which he was accur
sed / and that he should make full restitucion to all men of holy church and of
religyon and of the goods that he had taken of them against their will. And
all ye great lords of england swear upon the book and by the holydome / that
if ye king would not hold his oath / they would make hy^ by strength to hold
it. Than the king put him to ye court of Rome and to ye pope and than gave he
up ye realm of england and of Irlonde for him and for his heirs for evermore
that should come after him / so that king John and his heirs should take those
two realms of the popes hands And should every year pay ferme unto the
court of Rome a thousand mark of silver. And than took the king the crown
of his heed and set hy^ on his knees and these words he said in herynge of all
the great lords of england. Here I resygne up the crown and the realm of
england in to the hands of pope Inno cent the third / and put me holy in to
his mercy and in his ordinance. Pandulf than received y^ crown of king John /
and kept it.v. days as for a ceasing taking of two realms of England and
Irlonde And confermed all manner things by his chartre that follows after.

Of the lettre oblygatory that king John made unto the court of Rome /
wherefore the Peter pens ben gadered through out all England.
TO all christian people throu^h out all the world dwelling. John by the grace
of god king of England gretynge to your university. And be it known that for
as much as we have grieved and offended god and our mother church of Rome. And
for as much as we have need unto ye mercy of our lord Jesus Christ / and also
we may no thing so worthy offer as competent sa(...) to make to god and to
holy church but (...) it were our own body as with ^ur realms of England
and of Irlonde. Than by ye grace of god we desire to meke us for the love of
him y^ meked him to the death upon the cross / through counseyle of the noble
earls and barons we offer and freely grant to god and to y^ apostles saint
Peter and saint Paul / and to our mother church of Rome / and to our holy
fader the pope Innocent the third / and to all y^ popes y^ come after him /
all the realms and patronages of chirches of England and of Irlonde with
their appertenau^tes / for remyssyon of our sins / and for help and health of
our kynne souls and all christen souls. So y^ from this day afterward we will
receive and hold of our mother thirche of Rome as fee farm / doing feaute to
our holy fader pope Innocent the third / and so to all the popes that comes
after him in y^ same manner above said. And in y^ presence of the wise man
Pandulf the popes subdeken we make lyege homage / as it were in the popes
presence and before him were / and shall do all manner things above said / and
thereto we bind us / and all that comes after us and our heirs for evermore /
without any gaynsayenge to the pope / and eke y^ ward of church vacau^tes.
And in toke^ of this thing evermore for to last / we will con ferme and ordeyn
/ that our special rentes of y^ foresaid realm / saving saint Peter's pens in
all thing to y^ mother church of Rome payenge by year a thousan de mark of
silver at two terms of the year for all manner customs y^ we should do for y^
foresaid realms / that is to say at Myghelmasse / and at Eester / that is to
say. vij.C. mark for England / and three hundred mark for Irlond / saving to
us and to our heirs our Justices / and our other fraunchyses / and other
ryaltees that perteyneth unto the crown. And these things that before ben
said / we will that it be ferme and stable without end. And to that oblygacyon
we and our successors and our heirs in this manner be bound / that if we or
any of our heirs through any presumpcyon fall in any point against any of
these things above said / and he be warned and will not right amend him / he
shall than lose the foresaid realms for evermore. And that this chartre of
oblygacyon and our warrau^t for evermore be ferme and stable without any
gaynsay enge / we shall fro this day afterward be true to god and to the
mother church of Rome / and to the pope Innocent the third / and to all them
that comes after him / and the realms of England and of Irlonde we shall
trewly maintain in all manner points against all manner men by our power
through gods help.

How the clerks that were outlawed of England came again / and how king John
was assoyled.
When this chartre was made and ensealed / the king received again his crown
of Pandulfs hand / and sent anon unto the archebysshop Stephen / and to all
his other clerks and lewd men that he had exyled out of this land / that they
should come again in to England and have again their lands and also their
rentes / and that he would make restytucyon of the goods that he had taken of
theyrs against their will The king himself than and Pandulf / and the earls
and barons went to wynchestre against y^ archebysshop Stephen. And when he was
comen the king went against him / and fell down to his feet / and thus to
him said. Fair sir ye be welcome / and I cry you mercy because that I have
trespaced against you. The archebysshop took hy^ up tho in his arms and kyssed
him curteysly ofte^tymes / and after ladde him to the door of saint Swythynes
church by the hand / and assoyled him of y^ sentence / and him reco^cyled to
god and to holy church. And that was on saint Margaretes day. And the arche
bishop anon went for to sing mass. And y^ king offered at the mass a mark
of gold. And when y^ mass was done / all they went to receive al their lands
without any manner gaynsayenge. And that day they made all mirth and joy
enough. But yet was not y^ enterdytynge releaced / because y^ pope had set that
the enterdytynge should not be done till the king had made full restitucyon of
y^ goods that he had take of holy church And y^ himself should do homage to
the pope by a tertayne legate that he should send into england. And tha^ took
Pandulf his leave of y^ king and the archebysshop / and went again to Rome.
And the archebysshop anon let come before him prelates of holy church at
Redynge for to treat and counsel how much and what they should ask of y^
king for to make restytucyon of y^ goods y^ he had taken of them. And they
ordained and said / that the king should give to y^ archebysshop three thousand
mark for the wrong y^ the king had done unto him. And also by porcions to
other clerks.xv. M. mark. And this same time Nicolas bishop of Tuscan
cardynall penytencer of Rome came in to England through the popes
commandment / the.v. kalende of October / and came to London y^.v. nonas of
October / for because that king John and all the kings y^ came after him should
evermore hold y^ realm of England and of Irlonde of god and of the pope /
payenge to the pope by year as is above said.

How y^ enterdytynge was undone in england / and of y^ debate y^ was between
king John and the barons of the realm
When king John had done his homage to y^ legate y^ showed hy^ the popes
lettre y^ he should pay to Iulyan / and yield again that was king Rychardes
wife y^ third part of the land of England and of Irlonde y^ he had with
holden sith that king Richard dyed. When king John herd this / he was
wonders wroth. For utterly y^ enterditynge might not be undone till that he had
made gree and resticucyon to the foresaid Iulyan of that she asked The legate
than went again to y^ pope after Chrystmasse. And the king than sent
messengers outr see to Julian that was king Rychard wife for to have a relese
of y^ she axed of him. And so it befell y^ Iulyan dyed anon after ^^ster. And
in so much the king was quyte of that thing that she asked. But than at the
feast of saint John that came next after through the popes commandment y^
enterdityng was first released through out all England the.vij. day of July.
And.vij. year was the land enterdited. And on the morrow men ronge and said
mass through out all London / and so after through out all England. And y^
next year after there began a great debate between king John and the lords of
England / for because he would not grant the laws and hold / the which
saint Edward had ordained / and had been v^ed and holden unto that time that he
had them broken. For he would hold no law but did all thing that him lyked
and dysheryted many men without consent of lords and peers of the land. And
would dysheryte y^ good earl Radulf of hestre for because that he undertook hy^
of his wyckednes / and for cause that he did so much shame and vylany to god
and to holy church. And also for he held and haunred his own broders wife /
and lay also by manner other women great lords daughters / for he spared no
woman that him lyked for to have. Wherefore all y^ fordes of the land were
wroth / and took the cite of London. To cease this debate the archebysshop and
lords of the land assembled before the feast of saint John baptyst in a meadow
beside y^ town of Stanes / that is called Romney mede. And the king made them
there a chartre of fraunchyse / such as they would ask / and in such manner
they were accorded And that accordement lasted not long. For the king
himself soon after did against the poynces of y^ same chartre that he had
made. Wherefore the most part of the lords of the land assembled them / and
began to war vyon hy^ again and brent his towns and robbed his folk and did
all thesorowe that they might and made themself as strong as they might with
all their power / and thought to drive him out of England / and make Lowys y^
kings sone of France king of England. And than king John sent over see /
and ordained so much people or normans and of pyecardes and of flemmynges /
so that the land might not sustain them but with much sorrow. And among
all this people there was a man of Normandye that was called Faukes of Brent /
and this Norman and his company spared neither church ne house of religyon but
they brent and robbed it and bare away all that they might take so that y^
land was all destroyed / what on one side and what on another. The barons and
lords of England ordained among them the best spekers and wysest men / and
sent them over the sea unto king Philyp of France / and prayed him y^ he
would send Lowys his sone in to England to be king of England and to
receive the crown.

How Lowys y^ kings sone of france came in to England with a strong power of
people to be king of England.
When king Philip of France herd these tidings / he made certain aliaunce
between them by their common eleccyon y^ Lowys king Philyps sone of France
should go with them in to Eng land and drive out king John of the land. And
all that were in the presence of Lowys made unto him homage and became his men.
And the barons of eng land held them still at London / and abode Lowys y^
kings sone of france. And this was the next batardaye brfore the Astention
of our lord y^ Lowys came into England with a strong power. And that time
king John had taken all the castelles of England in to alyens hands. And
than came Lowys and besyeged ^ochesters castle / and took it with streugthe.
And the thursdaye in whytson weke let hang all the alyens that were therein.
And the thursdaye after he came to London / and there he was received with
much honor of the lords that abode him there / and all to him made homage.
And afterward on the tewesdaye next after Trynite sunday he took the castle
of Reigate / and on the morrow after the castle of Gylforde / and the frydaye
next after the castle of Farneham. And the mondaye next after the cite of
wynchestre unto him was yolden. And on the morrow after saint Iohans day the
manoyre of woluesey to him was yolden. And the tewesdaye after the vtas of
saint Peter and saint Paul they took the castle of Odiham. And the mondaye
after saint Margaretes day / he ordained him toward Bawmore for to syege the
castle / and there he dwelled.xv. days and might not get the castle / and
than went he thens and came to London / and the toure to him was yolden.

How the pope sent in to England a legate that was called Swalo / and of the
death of king John.
ANd in y^ same time y^ pope sent in to england a legate y^ was called Swalo
/ and he was priest Cardynall of Rome for to mayntayn king John's cause against
the barons of England. But the barons had so huge party and help through
Lowys y^ kings sone of France that king John wist not wheder to turn ne go.
And so it befell that he would have gone to Nycholl / and as he went
thyderwarde he came by ye abbey of Swynestede / and there he abode two days.
And as he sat at meet he asked a monk of the house how much a lofe was worth
yt was set before him upon the table. And the monk said that the lofe was
worth but an halfpeny. O said the king tho / here is great chepe of bread. Now
quod the king / and I may live such a lofe shall be worth.xx. shylly^ges or
half a year be gone. And wha^ he had said these words / much he thought and
often he syghed / and took and ete of the breed and said / by god ye words that
I have spoken it shall be soth. The monk that stood before ye king was for
these words full sorry in his heart / and thought rather he would himself
suffer death / and thought how he might ordeyn therefore some manner remedy. And
the monk anon went to his abbot / and was shryuen of him / and told the
abbot all that the king had said / and prayed his abbot for to assoyle him /
for he would give the king such a drink that all England should be glad
thereof and joyful. Than went the monk in to a gardeyn and found a great tode
therein / and took her up and put her in a cup / and prycked the tode through
with a broche many times till that the venym came out on every side in the cup
/ and than took the cup and filled it with good ale / and brought it before
the king and knelynge said. Sir quod he wassayle / for never the days of your
life drank ye of so good a cup. Begin monk quod the king. And the monk
drank a great draught / and after took the king the cup / and the king also
drank a great draught and set down the cup. The monk anon right went in to
the farmery and there dyed anon / on whose soul god have mercy Amen. And.v.
monks sing for his soul specially / and shall whiles the abbey stands. The
king arose up anon full evil at ease / and commanded to remeue the table /
and asked after the monk. And men told him that he was deed / and that his
womb was broken in sonder. When the king herd this / he commanded to trusse
/ but it was all for naught / for his belly began to swell of the drink that he
had dronken / and within two days he dyed / on ye morrow after saint Lukes
day. And this king John had many fair children of his body begoten / that is
to say / Henry his sone that was king after his fader / and Richard that was
earl of Cornewayle / and Isabel that was empress of Rome / and Elenour that
was queen of Scotlonde. And this king John when he had reigned.xvij. year
and.v. months and.v. days he dyed in the castle of Newarke / and his body
was buried at Worcetter.

Anno domini. M.CC.
FRedericus the second was emperor.xxxiij. year. This man was crowned of
Honorius the pope against Otto / because y^ he should fight with him / the
which he did / and expulsed him. And first he nourysshed ye church / and
after he spoiled it as a stepmoder. Wherefore Honorius cursed him / and all that
were contrary to his opinion the pope assoyled. And the same sentence Gregorye
the.ix. renewed. And this same man put Henry his own sone in prison / and
there murdered him. Wherefore wha^ this emperor another season was seek / by
another sone of his own he was murdered / in the time of Innocent the fourth.
Honorius the third was pope after Innocent.x. year / and confermed ye order of
freres prechours and minours / and made certain de^r^^alles.

Of king Henry the third that was crowned at Glocestre.
ANd after this king John reigned his sone Henry and was crowned at Glocestre
when he was.ix. year old / on saint Symons day and Jude of Swalo y^ legate of
Rome / through counsel of all the great lords y^ held with king John his
fader / that is to say / the earl Radulfe of Chestre / Wyllyam earl Marshall
earl of Penbroke / Willyam y^ Brener earl of Feriers. Serle y^ manly baron and
all the other great lords of England held with Lowys the kings sone of
France. And anon after wha^ king Henry was crowned / Swalo the legate held
his counsel at Brystow at saint Martyns feast / and there were.xj. bishops
of England and of Wales / and of other prelates of holy church a great nombre
/ and earls and barons and many knights of England / and all those that were
at that counsel swear feaute unto Henry the king that was king John's sone.
And anon after y^ legate enterdyted Wales / because they held with the brons of
England / also all those that help or gave counseyle to meue war against y^
new king he accursed them And at y^ begy^nyng he put in y^ sentence the kings
sone of France Lowys. And nevertheless y^ same Lowys would not spare for all
that / but went and took the castle of Barcamstede / and also the castle of
Herford. And from y^ day afterward y^ barons did there much harm through out
all England / and pryncypally y^ frensh men that were with Lowys / wherefore
the great lords and all y^ common people of England let dress them for to
drive out of England Lowys and his company But some of the barons and of the
frensshe men were gone to the cite of Nycholl / and took y^ town and held it
to king Lowys profit. But thither came king Henryes men with a great power /
that is to say / the earl Radulfe of Chestre / and Wylliam earl Marshall / and
Wyllyam the brener earl of Feriers / and many other lords with them / and gave
battle unto Lowys men. And there was slain the earl of Perches / and Lowys
men were there foul discomfyted. And there was taken Serle earl of Wynchestre
/ and Vmfrey de Bowne earl of Herford / and Robert the sone of walter / and
many other that began war against the king / there they were taken and ladde
unto king Henry y^ was king John's sone. And when the tidings came to Lowys of
y^ disco^ fyture y^ was the kings sone of france he remeued from thens and
went unto London / and let shette fast the gates of the cite. And anon after
king Henry sent to the burgeyses of London y^ they should yield them to him /
and the cite also and he would grant to them all their fraunchyses that ever
they were wont to have before / and would co^ferme them by his great new
chartre under his broad seal. And in the same time a great lord that was
called Eustace y^ monk came out of France with a great company of lords /
and would have comen in to England for to have helped Lowys the kings sone of
France. But Hubert of Burgh and the.v. ports with.viii. ships tho met
with them in y^ high see / and assailed them egerly / and overcame them with
strength / and smote of the heed of Eustace the monk / and took also.x. great
lords of france and put them in prison / and slew almoost all the men that
came with them / and anon drowned the ships in the sea.

How Lowys returned again in to France / and of the confyrmacyon of king
Iohans chartre.
When Lowys herd these tydyn ges he drad sore to be deed and lost and let
ordeyn and speak between the king and Lowys by y^ legate Swalo And through y^
archebysshop of Canterbury and other great lords all y^ prisoners on that one
part and on that other should be delivered and go quyte / and Lowys himself
should have for his costs a. M. pound of silver / and should go out of
England / and never come again therein. And in this manner was the accord made
between king Henry and Lowys. And than was Lowys assoyled of y^ popes legate
that was called Swalo of y^ sentence that he was in / and the barons of
England also. And after this king Henry and Swalo y^ legate and Lowys went to
Merton / and there was y^ peace co^fermed and between them ordained. And after
Lowys went fro thens to London / and took his leave / and was brought with much
honor to y^ see with y^ archebysshop of Caunterbury and with other bisshops
and earls and barons / and so went Lowys in to France. And afterward the
king and the archebysshop and earls and barons assembled them at London / and
at Mighelmas next following held there a great parlyament / and there were
than renewed all the frau^chyses that king John had granted at Romney mede /
and king Henry than co^fermed by his chartre / the which yet ben holden
through out all England. And in y^ time y^ king took of every plough land two
shyllynges. And Hubert of Burgh was than made chief justice of england And
this was in y^ fourth year of king Henryes regne. And in y^ same year was
saint Thomas of Canterbury translated / the.l. year after his martyrdom. And
after it was ordained by all the lords of England y^ all alyens should go out
of England and come no more therein. And king Henry took than all y^ castles in
to his hands y^ king John his fader had given and taken to alyens for to keep
that held with him. But y^ proud Faukes of Brent rychely let array his castle
of Bedford / which he had of king John's gift / and he held that castle
against king Henryes will with might and strength And the king came thither with a
strong power and besyeged the castle. And the archebysshop master Stephen of
lang ton with a fair company of knights came to the king for to help him.
And from the Ascencyon of our lord unto the Assumpcyon of our lady lasted y^
syege / and than was the castle won and taken. And the king let hang all
those that were gone in to y^ castle which the^: good will for to hold the
castle against him / that is to say.lxxx. men. And than afterward Faukes
himself was found in a church of Couentre / and there i^ forsware all
England with much shame and than went again in to his own country. And
whiles that king Henry reigned / Edmonde of Abyndon that was tresourer of
Salysbury was consecrate archebysshop of Caunterbury. And this king Henry
sent over see unto the earl of Prouance that he should send him his daughter
in to Englende that was called El^nore / and he would spouse her. And so she
came in to England after Chrystmas / and on the morrow after saint Hylaryes
day the archebysshop Edmonde spoused them together at Westmynster with great
solempnite. And there was a fair sight between them / that is for to say /
Edward that was next king after his fader flower of curteysy and of largess
/ and Margarete that was afterward queen of Scotlonde / and Beatryne that was
afterward duchess of Brytayne And Katheryne that dyed a maid in relygyon.

Of the quinzeme of goods that were granted for the new chartre / and of the
purucyaunce of Oxford.
ANd thus it befell y^ the lords of England would have some addicyons moo in
the chartre of frau^chyse y^ they had of the king / and spoke thus between
them. And y^ king granted them all their asking / and made to them two
chartres / y^ one is called y^ great chartre of frau^chyses / and that other is
called the chartre of forest. And for y^ grant of these two chartres /
prelates / earls and barons / and all the comyns of England gave to y^ king
a. M. mark of silver. When king Henry had been king.xiiij. year / the same
year he and his lords / earls and barons of the realm went to Oxford / and
ordained a law in amendment of y^ realm. And first swear y^ king himself
and afterward all the lords of y^ land that they would hold y^ statute for
ever more / and who that them brake should be deed. But the second year after
that ordinance / the king through counsel of sir Edward his sone and of
Rychard his brother that was earl of Cornewayle / and also of other / repented
him of that oath that he had made for to hold that law and ordinance / and
sent to y^ court of Rome to be assoyled of that oath. And in the year next
coming after was the great derth of corn in england / for a quarter of whete
was worth.xxiiij. shyllynges And the poor people ete nettyls and other wedes
for great honger / and many a. M. dyed for defaute of meet. And in the xlviij.
year of king Henryes regne began war and debate between him and his lords /
for because that he had broken y^ couenau^tes y^ were made between them at
Oxford. And in the same year was the town of Northamton taken and folk slain
that were within / for because y^ they had made and ordained wild fire for to
brenne the cite of London. And in the month of May that came next after upon
saint Pancras day / was y^ battle of Jews / which was y^ wednesdaye before
saint Dunstans day / and there was taken king Henry himself and sir Edward
his sone / and Rychard his brother earl of Cornewayl / and many other lords.
And in the same year next following sir Edward the kings sone brake out of
the ward of sir Simon of Mou^tford earl of Leycestre at Herford / and went
unto the barons of y^ March and they received him with much honor. And the
same time Gylbert of Clarence earl of Glocestre that was in y^ ward also of y^
foresaid Symo^ / through the commandment of king Henry / that went from him
with a great heart / for because he said y^ the foresaid Gylbert was a fool in
his counsel / wherefore he ordained hy^ afterward so / and held hy^ with king
Henry. And on y^ saterdaye next after y^ mids of August sir Edward y^ kings
sone discomfited sir Simon of Mou^tford at Kelinworth / but the great lords y^
were there with hy^ were taken / y^ is to say Baldewyn wake / and William de
Mou^chensie / and many other great lords And y^ tewesdaye next after was y^
battle done at Eusham / and there was slain sir Simon of Mou^tford / Hugh
spenser / and Mou^tford that was Rafe Bassets fader of Draiton / and many other
great lords. And wha^ this battle was done all y^ gentylmen that had been with
the earl Simon were disheryted / and they ordained together and did much harm
to all y^ land. For they destroyed their enemies in all that they might.

Of the syege of Kelynworth / and how the gentylmen were disherited through
counseyle of the lords of the realm of England / and how they came again
and had their ^^^des.
ANd the next year coming in May / the fourth day before y^ teest of saint
Dunstan was the battle and dyscomfyture at Chest erfelde of them that were
disheryted / and there was many of them slain. And Robert earl of Fe riers
there was taken / and also Baldewyn and John de la hay with much sorrow
escaped thens. And on saint John baptystes eve than next following began the
syege of the castle of Kenilworth / and the syege lasted to said Thomas eve
y^ apostle / on which day sir Hugh Hastynge had y^ castle for to keep / that
yielded up the castle unto the king in this manner / that himself and the other
y^ were within the castle should have their lives and ly^mes / and all that
they had therein / both horse and harneys / and four days of respyte for to
deliver clenely y^ castle of themself and of all other manner thing as they
had within the castle. And so they went from the castle. And sir Simon de
Mou^tford y^ younger and the countess his mother were fled over seem to
France and there held them as people that were exiled out of England for
evermore. And soon after it was ordained by y^ legate Dctobone and by other
great lords y^ wysest of England / that all those y^ had been against the king
and were disheryted should have again their lands by grievous rau^sons after
y^ it was ordained. And thus they were accorded with the king / and peace was
cried through out England / and thus y^ war was ended. And when this was
done y^ legate took his leave of y^ king and of the queen and of all the great
lords of england / and tho went to Rome the.lv. year of king Henryes regne.
And Edward king John's sone of Brytayne / John Vesst / Thomas of clare / Roger
of Clifford / Oaths of grau^ston / Robert le Brus / John of verdon / and many
other lords of England and of beyond the sea took their way toward the
holy land. And king Henry dyed y^ same time at Westminster wha^ he had been
king.lv. year and.xix. wekes / on saint Edmondes day y^ archebysshop of
Canterbury. And he was buried at Westmynster on saint Edmo^des day y^ king in
the year of our lord. M.CC.lxxij.

Prophecy of Merlyn of king Henry the first expowned that was king John's sone.
ANd of this Henry prophesied Merlyn and said that a ^a^^be should come out of
Wynchestre in y^ year of our lord. M.CC. and.xvj. with true lyppes and holiness
written in his heart. And he said soth / for y^ good Henry y^ king was borne i^
wynchestre in y^ year above said and he spoke good words and sweet / and was
an holy man and of good conscience. And Merlyn said y^ this Henry should make
the fairest place of y^ world / y^ in his time should not be fully ended. And
he said soth. For he made y^ new work of y^ abbey of saint Peter's church at
Westmynster / y^ is fayrer of sight than any other place y^ any man knows
through out all chrystendom. But king Henry dyed or y^ work was fully at an
end / and that was great harm. And yet said Merlyn that this lamb should have
peace y^ most part of his regne. And he said soch. For he was never noyed
through war ne dyseased in no manner wise / till a little before his death. And
Merlyn said in his prophecy more / y^ in the end of y^ regne of y^ foresaid
lamb / a wolf of a strange lord should do hy^ much harm through his war /
and y^ he should at y^ last be master through help of a reed fore / that
should come out of the Northwest and should outr come him / and that he should
drive him out of the water. And that prophecy full well was known. For within
a little time or the king dyed / Symonde of Mountforde earl of Leycestre that
was borne in France began strong war against him / through which doing
many a good bacheler was destroyed. And when king Henry had y^ vyctory at
Eusham and Simon y^ earl was slain through help of Gylberte of Clare earl of
Glocestre / that was in keeping of the foresaid Simon / through ordinance of
king Henry / which went again to the king with much power. Wherefore the
soresayd Symo^ was destroyed and that was great harm to y^ comyns of England
that so noble a man was slain for the troth / and dyed in charity and for the
common profit of the same folk. And therefore almighty god for hy^ has sythen
showed many a fair miracle to diverse men and women seek for his love. And
Merlyn also told and said in his prophecy / that after that time y^ lamb
should live no while / and than his seed should be in strange land without
any pasture. And he said sothe. For king Henry lived no while after when that
Simon Mou^tford was deed / but dyed anon after him. And in y^ mean time sir
Edward his sone that was the best king of y^ world of honor was than in y^
holy land / and gate there Acres. And in y^ country he begat on dame Elenour
his wife Ihone of Acres his daughter that afterward was countess of
Glocestre. And made such a vyage in y^ holy land that all the world spoke of
his knyghthode / and every man dradde him hye and low through out all
chrystendome / as the story of him tells / as afterward ye shall here more
openly. And from the time y^ king Henry dyed / till that sir G^warde was
crowned king all the great lords of england were as faderles children
without any socoure that them might maintain / govern and defend against
their enemies.

GRegorye the.ix. was pope after Honory. This man canonysed many saints / and
defended myghtely the church against Frederyc / therefore took he many prelates
and two cardynalles the which went to counseyle against him. This pope was
besyeged in y^ cite of Rome by the emperor / and he saw the Romans were
corrupt by the money of the emperor. Than he took in his hand the hedes of
the apostles Peter and Paul / and went with processyon fro the church of
saint John Latrane^ce to saint Peter's church. And so gate he the hertes of y^
Romans. And than the emperor went away fro the cite. This pope made friar
Iaymonde to compyle the five books of the decretals of many pystles and
decrees. And after with many tribulacyons of this tyrau^t and other he decessed
and went to heaven Celestinus y^ fourth was pope after Gregory almoost a month
/ and he was in his life and in his connnynge laudable / and he was an old man
and a feeble and decessed / and there was no pope after him almoost a.xij.
month. Innocentius y^ fourth was pope after hy^.xj. year and.vj. months.
This man canonysed many saints / and he deposed y^ emperor Frederye and
cursed as an enemy to god and y^ church in y^ third year y^ he was made pope
/ and he was helped by the Ianuens. And than was Henry y^ syxth chosen and
Wylliam by y^ popes commandment against Frederye one after an other. But they
prevailed not to overcome his tyranny for he was over mighty / ne these were
not crowned / for they decessed anon. Thomas de aquino. Albertus magnus.
Eustacius and Bonaue^ture were this time holy men / which destroyed much
heresy infected by y^ emperor. Alexander was pope after Innocent.vij. year /
and little of hy^ is written. Vrbanus was pope after him.iij. year and.iij.
months This man drove away an host of sara zyns by men marked with the cross
/ that Maufred had sent against the church. The pope gave y^ kingdom of Cicyle
to the kings brother of france / y^ he should fight with Maufred / and than
decessed. And Maufred after lost his life and his kingdom by Karolus. Alphonsus
king of Castil and Rychard brother to y^ king of england were chosen emperors
/ but Richard dyed / and Alphonsus renou^ced his title of the empire before
Gregory the.ix. for he was a wytty man and a noble astronomer / and his tables
be very famous. Cleme^s the.iiij. was pope after Urban.iij. year and.ix.
months. This Cleme^s was an holy man / and said by spirit of prophecy y^ the
enemies of y^ church should perysshe as y^ smoke. And it is to be byleued that
god cessed y^ tribulacyons of his church through his merits. He had before a
wife and children / and was a priest after and bishop and legate / and being
in england unknown to hy^ was chosen pope / and after for his virtuous life
decessed blyssedly. Gregory y^.x. was pope after hy^.iiij. year. He assembled a
co^cyle at Loduu^ in france for y^ great desire y^ he had to vysyte personally
y^ holy land / in y^ which concyle y^ Greeks and the Tartares were / and
there y^ Greeks promised to be reformed by y^ unite of y^ church. And y^
Tartares newly baptized promised y^ same And there were gadered. vj.C. bisshops
and a. M. prelates. And therefore a certain man said. Gregory gadereth together
all ky^des of people. And there was decreed y^ all persons and vycayres should
be called priests / and no prelates / and y^ no man should assygne his tithes
to what church he would / as they did before / but they should be paid to his
mother church. And he dampened y^ pluralite of bn^fyces / and dyed a blyssed
man. Innocent the.v. was after him.v. months / and little did. Adrian was
after him one month / and did less. John the.xxj. was after hy^ viij.
months / and he was i diverse seyences a famous man / but in manners a fool and
decessed anon. Nycolas y^.iij. was pope after John.j. year. This man was in
his days a noble man in buyldyng / and well governed y^ ci^e all his days and
y^. ^j year he dyed. Rodulphus was emperor.xviij. year. This man was cr^^ of
Hauesburgh / a wise man in arms noble and victoryous / and was chosen at
bastle and he took y^ cross on him for y^ holy land The imperyall blessyng he
had not but the pope allowed y^ eleccyon for favor of the holy land.

Anno dn^i. M.CC.lxxiiij.
MArtyn y^ fourth was pope after Nycholas.iiij. year. This man was a great
lover of relygyous men / and greatly attendyng to virtuous works. He cursed y^
emperor of ^o^sta^tynople in so much as he promised to turn to y^ faith in
the general concyle and did not / for y^ which he suffered many passions and
all holy church. Also he cursed y^ king of Aragon for he expulsed y^ king of
Cicyle fro his kingdom. And after he had done many batayles against me^ of
misbyleue / and had suffered many tribulacyo^s he decessed and did many
miracles. Ni colas de lira a noble doctor of dyuinite was this time at Paris
this man was a jew / and was converted / and myghtely profyted in y^ order of
friar minors / and he wrote over all the bible. Or else he was in the year of
our lord. M.ccc.xxx. And some men say he was of Braband / and y^ his fader
and mother were christen / but for pouerte he visyted y^ scoles of the jews And
so he learned the jews language / or else this Nycolas was enfourmed of y^ jews
in his young age. Honorius y^ fourth was pope after Martyn.ij. year and little
of him is wryte^ / but y^ he was a te^perate man and a discrete. Nicolaus y^
fourth was pope after him four year. this man was a friar minor / and al
though he was a good man in hy^self / yet many unhappy things fell in his time
to the church / for many a battle was in y^ cite through his occasyon / for
he drew to much to y^ one part / and after hy^ there was no pope two year
and.vj. months.

Of king Edward that was king Henryes sone. And of his ryalte.


ANd after this king Henry reigned Edward his sone / the worthyest knight of all
y^ world in honor For gods grace was in hy^ / for he had y^ victory of his
enemies. And as soon as his fader was deed he came to London with a fair
company of prelates and of earls and barons / and all manner men did him much
honor. For in every place y^ this noble Edward rode in London the streets were
covered over his heed with rich clothes of sylke / of tapysserye and with
rich couerynges. And for joy of his coming the burgeyses of the cite cast
out at their wyndowes gold and silver hands full / in tokenynge of love and
worship / service and reverence. And out of y^ condyth of chepe ran white wine
and reed as stremes of water / and every man drank thereof that would at their
own will. And this king Edward was crowned and anointed as right heir of
England with much honor. And after mass y^ king went in to his palace for
to hold a ryall feast among them y^ did him honor. And wha^ he was set to
mete / king Alexander of Scotlonde came for to do him honor and reverence
with a queyntyse / and an.C. knights with him well horsed and arrayed. And when
they were alighted they let their stedes go wheder they would / and who y^
might take them / had them still without any chalengynge. And after came sir
Edmonde king Edwardes brother a curteys and a gentle knight / and y^ earl of
Cornewayle and y^ earl of Glocestre / and after them came the earl of Penbroke
/ and y^ earl of Gare^ne. And each of them by themself ladde in their hand
an.C. knights gayly disguysed in their arms. And when they were alyghted of
their horses / they let them go wheder they would / and who that might them
catch / them to have still without any challenge. And when all this was done /
king Edward did his dylygence and his might for to amend and redress y^
wrongs in the best manner y^ he might / to the honor of god and holy church /
and to maintain his honor / and to amend the noyau^ce of y^ common people.

How Ydeyne that was Lewelyns daughter of Wales / and Aymer that was the earls
brother of Mountforde were taken on the sea.
THe first year after that king Edward was crowned / Lewlyn prince of Wales
sent in to France to the earl Mountford / that through counsel of his
friends the earl should wedde his daughter. And the earl tha^ auysed him upon
this thing / and sent unto Lewlyn and said that he would send after his
daughter. And so he sent Aymer his brother after the damoysell. And Lewlyn
arrayed ships for his daughter and for sir Aymer / and for her fair company
y^ should go with her. And this Lewlyn did great wrong / for it was a covenant
that he should give his daughter to no manner man without counsel and consent
of king Edward. And so it befell that a Burgeys of Brystowe came in the sea
laden with wine / and met them / and took them with might and power. And
anon the Burgeys sent them to the king. When Lewlyn herd these tidings he
was wonders wroth and also sorrowful / and began to war upon king Edward /
and did much harm to English men / and bette down the kings castles / and
began fast for to destroy king Edwardes lands. And when the tidings came
unto the king of this thing / he went in to Wales / and so much he did
through gods grace and his great power that he drove Lewlin to great myschefe
/ that he fled all manner strength and came and yielded him unto king Edward /
and gave him.l. M. mark of silver to have peace / and took the damoysell and
all his heritage / and made an obly gacyon to king Edward to come to his
parlyament two times in the year. And in the second year after y^ king Edward
was crowned / he held a general parlyame^t at Westmynster / and there he made
the statutes for defaute of law by the common assent of all his baronage. And
at eester next after the king sent by his lettre unto Lewlyn prince of Wales
that he should come to his parlyame^t for his land / and for his holding of
Wales as the strength of the lettre oblygatory wytnessed. Than Lewlyn had
scorn and despyte of y^ kings commandment. And for pure wrath again began
war upon king Edward / and destroyed his lands. And when king Edward herd
of these tydy^ges / he waxed wonders wroth unto Lewlyn / and in haste assembled
a great power of people and went toward Wales and warred so upon Lewlyn the
prince till y^ he brought him in much sorrow and disease. And Lewlyn saw that
his defense might not avail him / and came again and yielded him to y^ kings
grace / and cried him mercy / and long time kn^led before y^ kings feet. The
king ^ad of him pity / and commanded him to a^^se / and for his mekenes
forgave hy^ his wrath and to him said / that if he trespaced against hy^ an
other time / that he would destroy hy^ for evermore. David y^ was Lewlins
brother y^ same time dwelled with king Edward / and was a fell man and a subtle /
and enuyous / and also far casting and much treason thought / and evermore
made good semblaunt / and seemed so (...) y^ no man might perceive his falsnes.

How Lewlyn through ^gg^nge of his brother David warred again upon king Edward.
IT was not long time that time that king Edward gave to David Lewlyns brother
the lordship of ^rodesham / and made him knight. And so much honor did he
never after to no man of Wales because of him. King Edward held his parlyament
at London when he had done in Wales all that he would / and changed his money
y^ was foul kyt and rou^ded / wherefore the people co^playned sore / so y^ the
king let inquire of ye trespassours. And.ccc. were atteynted of such manner of
falsnes / wherefore some were hanged / and some drawn and hanged. And afterward
the king ordey ned / that ye sterling halfpeny and ferthyng should go through
out all his land. And commanded yt no man fro that day afterward gave ne
^eoffed house of religyon with land or teneme^t / without special leave of ye
king / and he yt did / should be punysshed at the kings will / and the gift
should be for naught. And it was not long after that Lewlyn prince of Wales
through ye entycement of David his brother / and by both their consent they
thought to dysheryte king Edward in as much as they might / so yt through
them both ye kings peace was broken And when king Edward herd of this anon
he sent his barons in to Northum berlonde and the surreys also / yt they should
go and take their usage upon ye traitors Lewlyn and Dauyd / and wonders hard
it was for to war than. For it is winter in Wales / when in other countries
it is somer. And Lewlyn let ordeyne and well array and vitayle his good castle
of Swandon / and therein was an huge nombre of people and plente of vitayles /
so that king Edward wist not where to enter. And when ye kings men it
perceived / and also ye strength of Wales / they let come in to ye see barges
and botes and great plankes as many as they might ordeyne and have for to go to
the foresaid castle of Swandon with men on foot and also on horse. But ye
Walshmen had so much people and were so strong / yt they drove ye Englysshmen
back / so yt there was so much prees of people at the turnynge again / that
the charge and the burden of men made ye barges and botes to synke / and there
was drowned many a good knight / yt is to say / sir Roger Clifford / sir
William of Lindsey that was sir John's sone fitz Robert / and sir Rychard Tanny
/ and an huge nombre of other / and all was through their own folly / for if
they had had good spies they had not ben harmed. When king Edward herd tell
that his people were so drowned / he made sorrow enough. But than came sir John
of Vessye from the king of Aragon / and brought with him much people of
bachelors and of Gascoyns and were soudyours and dwelling with John of Vessye /
and of him received wages / and of him were holden / and were noble men for to
fight / and brent many towns / and slew all ye walshmen that they might take.
And all those with strength and might made assaute unto the castle of Swandon /
and gate the castle. And wha^ David herd of these tidings / he ordained hy^
to flight. Wha^ Lewlyn ye prince knew that his brother was fled / tha^ was he
sore abashed / for he had no power his war to maynteyn. And so Lewlyn began
to flee / and wend well to have escaped But in a morning sir Roger Mortimer
met with him only with.x. knights / and set him round about / and to him
went and smote of his heed / and presented it to king Edward. And in this manner
Lewlyn ye prince of Wales was taken / and his heed smytten of / and also all
his heirs dysheryted for evermore / through ryghtfull dome of all the lords
of the realm.

How David yt was Lewlyns brother prince of Wales was put to death.
David ye princes brother of Wales through pride wend to have be^ prince of
Wales after his broders death / And upon this he sent after walshmen to his
patlyament at Dinbigh / and folysshly made Wales to arise against ye king / and
began to meue war against king Edward / and did all ye sorrow and disease
that he might by his power. When king Edward herd of this thing / he ordey
ned men to pursue upon him. And David fyer^y him defended / till yt he came to
ye town of saint Morite / and there was David taken as he fled / and ladde
to the king. And the king commanded that he should be hanged and drawn / and
smite of his heed / and quarter hy^ / and send his heed to London / and the
four quarters to the four chief towns of Wales / for they should take
ensample thereof and be ware. And afterward king Edward let cry his peace
though out al wales / and seized all ye land into his hands / and all ye
great lords that were left alive came to do feaute and homage to king Edward
/ as to their kind lord. And than let king Edward amend the laws of Wales
yt were defectyue. And after he sent to al ye lords of Wales by his lettres
patentes yt they should come all to his parlyame^t. And when they were comen
the king said to them full curteysly. Lords ye be welcome / and me behooves
your counsel and your help for to go in to Gascoyn / for to amend ye
trespace that to me was done when I was there / and for to entreat of peace
between ye king of Aragon and the pry^ce of Morrey. And all ye kings liege
men earls and barons consented and granted thereto. And than king Edward made
him ready and went in to Gascoyn / and let amend all ye trespaces yt was done
hy^ in Gascoyn. And of ye debate that was between ye king of Aragon and the
prince of Morrey he cessed and accorded them. And while king Edward and queen
Elenore his wife were in Gascoyn / the good earl of Cornewayle was made wardeyn
of England till that king Edward came again. And tha^ inquired he of his tray
tours yt coniected falsnes against him. And each of the^ all received their
dome after that they had deserved. But in the mean time while that king Edward
was beyond yt see to do them for to make amends yt had trespaced against hy^
there was a falls traitor yt was called ^isap Meridoc began to make war
against king Edward / and that was for cause of sir Pain Tiptot ye wrongfully
grieved and diseased ye foresaid Bisap Meridoc. And when king Edward herd all
this / he sent by his lettres to Bisap Meridoc that he should make no war
but that he should be in peace for his love and when he came again in to
England he would undertake ye quarrel and amend all that was mysdone. This
foresaid Risap Meridoc despised the kings commandment / and spared not to do
all the sorrow that he might to ye kings men of England. But anon after he
was taken and ladde to york / and there he was drawn and hanged for his
felony.

Of the redressyng that king Edward made of his Justices and of his clerks
that they had done for their falsnes / and how he drove ye Jews out of
England for their usury and mysbyieue.
When king Edward had dwelled three year in Gascoyn / a desire came to hy^ for
to go in to England again And when he was comen again there were so many
co^playntes made to him of his Justices and of his clerks that had done so
many wrongs and falsnes / that wonder it was to here. For which falsnes sir
Thomas weylonde the kings Justice forswore England at ye Toure of London /
for falsnes that men put upon him / whereof he was atteynt and proved falls. And
anon after when the king had done his will of the Justices than let he
inquire and espy how the Jews deceived and begyled his people through their
sin of falsnes and of usury / and let ordeyn a preuy parliament among his
lords. And they ordained among them that all ye Jews should void out of Eng
lord for their misbyleue and also for their false usury that they did unto
christen men. And for to speed and make an end of this thing / all the
comynalte of England gave unto the king the.xv. penny of al their goods
mouable. And so were the jews driven out of England. And than went ye jews
in to France / and there they dwelled through leave of king Philyp that than
was king of France.

How king Edward was seized in all ye land of Scotlonde / through consent
and grant of all ye lords of Scotlonde.
IT was not long after ye Alexander king of Scotlonde was deed and David the
earl of Huntingdon that was the kings brother of Scotlond asked and claymed ye
kingdom of Scotlonde after that his brother was deed / because that he was
rightful heir. But many great lords said nay / wherefore great debate arose
between them and their fren des / for as much as they would not con sent to
his crownacyon. And the mean time the foresaid David dyed. And so it befell yt
the said David had three dough ters that worthily were married. The first
daughter was married to Bayloll / the second to Brus / and the third to
Hastynges. The foresaid Bayloll and Brus challenged ye land of Scotlonde / and
great debate and strife arose between them three because each of them would have been king. And when ye lords of Scotlonde saw ye debate between them / they
came to king Edward of England / and seized him in all ye land of Scotlonde
as chief lord. And when the king was seized of the foresaid lords of Scotlonde
/ ye foresaid Bayloll / Brus / and Hastynges came to the kings court / and
asked of ye king which of them should be king of Scotlonde. And king Edward
that was full gentle and true / let inquire by the chronicles of Scotlonde /
and of the gretest lords of Scotlonde / which of them was of ye eldest blood.
And it was found yt Bayloll was the eldest / and that the king of Scotlonde
should hold of ye king of England and do him feaute and homage. And after this
was done Bayloll went in to Scotlonde / and there was crowned king of
Scotlond. And ye same time was upon the sea great war between ye englyssh men
and the Normans. But upon a time the Norma^s arrived at Dover / and there they
martyred an holy man yt was called Thomas of Dover. And afterward were the
Normans slain / yt there escaped not one of them. And soon after king Edward
should lose the duchy of Gascoyn through king Philip of France / through his false castyng of ye Dou^e peers of the land / wherefore sir Edmond that was king
Edwardes brother gave up his homage unto ye king of France. And in yt time ye
clerks of England granted to king Edward half dele of holy church goods
/ in helping to recover his land again in Gascoyn. And the king sent thither
a noble company of his bachelors. And himself would have gone to Portesinouth
/ but he was let through one Maddok of Wales yt had seized the castle of
Swandon in to his hands / and for that cause ye king turned to Wales at
Chrystmasse. And because that the noble lords of England yt were sent in to
Gascoyn had no comfort of their lord the king they were taken of sir Charles
of France / that is to say / sir John of Brytayne / sir Robert Typtot / sir
Raufe Tanny / sir Hugh Bardulf / and sir Adam of Cretynge. And yet at ye
Ascencyon was Maddok taken in Wales and another which was called Morgan / and
they were sent to the toure of London / and there they were byheded.

How sir John Bailoll king of Scotlonde withsayd his homage.
ANd wha^ sir John Bailoll king of Scotlonde understood yt king Edward was
warred in Gascoyne (to whom ye realm of Scotlonde was delivered) falsely than
against his oath wtsayd his homage through procuryng of his folk / and sent
unto the court of Rome through a falls suggestion to be assoyled of the oath yt
he swore unto the king of England. And so he was by lettre embulled. Than
chose they of Scotlonde Douspers for to take from Edward his right. And in yt
time came two cardynals from Rome fro ye pope Celestyne to treat of accord
between the king of France and the king of England. And as those cardynals
spoke of accord / Thomas Turbeluyl was taken at Lions and made feaute and
homage to the warden of Paris / and to him put his two sons in hostage / and
thought to go in to England for to espy the country / and tell them when he
came in to England yt he had broken the kings prison of France by night /
and said that he would do yt all englysshmen and walshmen should be about ye
king of France. And this thing to bring to an end he swore / and upon this
covenant deeds were made between them / and that he should have by year a. M.
pou^des worth of land to bry^ge this thing to an end. This false traitor
took his leave and went thens and came in to England unto ye king and said yt
he was broken out of prison / and that he had put hy^ in such peril for his
love / wherefore ye king could hy^ much thank / and full glad was of his
coming And the false traitor fro yt day espied all the doing of ye king and
also his counsel / for the king loved him well / and was with him full preuy.
But a clerk of England yt was in the kings house of France herd of this
treason and falsnes / and wrote to an other clerk that than was dwelling with
king Edward of England all how Thomas Turbeluyll had done his false
conife^tynge / and all the counsel of England was written for to have sent
unto ye king of France. And through the foresaid lettre that ye clerk had
sent fro France / it was found upon him where fore he was / ladde to London
and there hanged and drawn for his treason. And his two sons that he had put
in Frau^^^ for hostage were than byheded.

Of the conquest of Barwyk.
ANd when the two cardynalles were gone again in to France for to treat of
the peace of Cambrey the king sent thither of his earls and barons that is to
say / sir Edmonde his brod^^ earl of Lancastre and of Leycestre (...) ^en ry
Lacy earl of Nycholl / and W^^ya^ ^^ss^ a baron / and of other baronettes
about xiiii. of the best and wysest of England. And in ye same time king
Edward took his viage to Scotlo^de for to war upon John Bayloll king of
Scotlonde. And sir Robert Roos of Batwyk dedde fro ye englysshmen and went to
the Scotts. And king Edward went toward Barwyk and besyeged the town. And
they yt were within ma^ly defended them and set a fire and brent two of king
Edwardes ships / and said in despyte and repre^e of him. Weneth king Edward
with his long shankes to have get Barwik all our vnthankes / gas pykes hy^ /
and when he has done gas dikes hy^. When king Edward had herd this s^orne /
anon through his might he passed over the dyches and assailed the town / and
came to the gates and gate and conquered the town / and through his gracyous
power slew.xxv. M. and. vij.C. Scotts. And king Edward lost no man of renome
/ save sir Richard of Cornewayle / and him slew a flemynge out of ye reed hall
with a quarrel as ye foresaid Richard did of his helm and commanded them for
to yield them and put them in the kings grace / and the Scotts would not /
wherefore ye hall was brent and cast down / and all those that were therein were
brent. And king Edward lost no moo men at that vyage of simple estate
but.xxvij. Englysshmen. And the wardeyn of the castle gave up the keys of the
castle without any assaute / and there was taken sir William Douglas and sir
Symond Ft^sell and the earl Patrik yielded them to the peace. But Ingham of
Humsremyll and Robert the Brus that were with king Edward / forsook king Edward
and held with the Scotts / and afterward they were taken and put in to
prison. And than let king Edward close in Barwik with walls and with dyches
And afterward Robert Rous went to Tyndale / and set waybrygge a fire and Exham
and Lamerstok / and slew and robbed the folk of yt country. And after that he
went fro thens to Dunbar. And ye first wednesdaye of March ye king sent ye
earl of Garenne / sir Hugh Percy / and sir Hugh Spenser with a fair company for
to besiege the castle. But one yt was called sir Rychard Syward a traitor and
a falls man ymagyned for to begyle ye englysshmen and sent to ye englysshmen for
to deceive them / and said that he would yield to them the castle / if they
would grant him. viij days of respyte / that he might send and tell to sir
John Bayloll that was king of Scotlonde / how his men fared that were within ye
castle / and sent him word but if he would remeue the syege of the
englysshmen / that they would yield the castle to the englysshmen. The
messenger than came unto sir John Bailoll (ye than was king of Scotlonde)
where as he was with his host / and the messenger told him all the case. And
than sir John Bayloll took his host and came on the morrow erly toward the
castle. And sir Rychard Sywarde saw him come that was master of the
counsel and keeper of ye castle / and said unto the Englysshemen. O quod he /
now I se a fair company and well apparayled / I will goo against them and mete
with them / and assail them. And sir Hugh Spenser saw the falsnes of him and
the treason / and said to him. O traitor taken and proved / your falsnes shall
not avail you. And sir Hugh Spenser commanded anon for to bind him / and in
all haste went against their enemies / and slew of the Scotts the nombre of
xxij. M. For the Scotts had that time no man with them of honor / save sir
Patryk Graham that manly fought and long / and at the last he was slain. And
than said the englysshmen in reprefe of the Scotts. These scaterand Scotts
hold I for sottes of wrenches unware. Erly in a morning in an evil tymyng
went ye fro Dunbare. When those yt were in the castle saw the dysco^fyture
they yielded up the castle to ye english men / and bound their bodies lands
and castles to king Edward. And so there were taken in ye castle three
earls.vij. ba rons / and.xxviij. knights / and.xj. clerks / and.vij. Pycardes
/ and all were presented to king Edward / and he sent them to ye toure of
London to be kept there.

How king Edward of his great grace delivered again the Scotts out of prison
that were chefetaynes of the land / and they drew them to the Frensshmen
through the counsel of Wyllyam Waleys.
THan when king Edward had made an end of the war and taken the chefetaynes
of Scotlond. Than came sir John Bayloll with other and yielded them unto king
Edward and put them in his grace / and were ladde to London. And wha^ king
Edward was comen thither they were brought before hy^ / and ye king asked of
them how they would make amends of the trespace and loss yt they had done him
/ and they put them in his mercy Lords said the king / I will not your lands
ne your goods / but I will yt ye make to me an oath upon gods body to be
true to me / and never after this time against me bear arms. And they all
consented to the kings will / and swore upon gods body / yt is to say / sir
John of Common / ye earl of Strathorne / ye earl of Ca^yk / and also.iiij.
bisshops undertook for all the clergy / and so ye king delivered them and gave
them safeconduytes to go in to their own country. And it was not long
afterward but that they arose against king Edward / because that they wist
well that king Edwardes folk were taken in Gascoyn / as before is said / but
sir Johan Bayloll king of Scotlonde wist well that his land should have
sorrow enough and shame for their falsnes / and in haste went him over ye see
to his own lands / and there held him / and never came again. Wherefore ye
Scotts chose unto their king Willyam Waleys a rybaud and an harlot / comen up
of naught / and to englysshmen did much harm. And king Edward thought how he
might best deliver his people that were taken in Gascoyne / and in haste went
him over the sea in to Flaundres for to war upon the king of France. And the
earl of Flau^dres received him with much honor / and granted him all his
lands at his own will. And when the king of France herd tell yt the king of
England was arrived in Flau^dres and came with an huge power to destroy him he
prayed hy^ of trewse for two year / so ye english merchants and also
frensshe might safely go and come on both sides. King Edward granted it /
so yt he had his men out of prison yt were in Gascoyn And ye king of France
granted anon / and so they were delivered. In the same time the Scotts sent
by the bishop of saint Andrews in to France to ye king and to sir Charles
his brother yt sir Charles should come with his power and they of Scotlond would
come with their power and so they should go in to England ye lond^ to destroy
from Scotlond unto ^en^ and the scotts trusted much upon ye frenssh men. But
of yt thing they had no manner grant. Yet nevertheless ye Scotts began to
rob and slay in Northumberlonde and did much harm.

How Willyam Waleys let slay sir Hugh of Cressingham / and of the battle of
Fonkirke.
When the tidings came to king Edward that Wyllyam Waleys had ordained such a
strong power and also that all Scotlonde to him was attendaunt and ready for to
slay Englysshmen and to destroy the land he was sore anoyed / and sent anon
by lettre to ye earl of Garren / and to sir Henry Percy and to sir Willyam
Latomer / and to sir Hugh of Cressyngham his tresourer that they should take
power and go in to Northumberlonde / and so forth in to Scotlond for to keep
the countries. And when Willyam Waleys herd of their coming / he began for to
flee / and ye englysshmen followed him / and drove him till he came to S^ry
uelyn / and there he held him in ye castle. And the walshmen every day them
escryed and thretened / and did all the despyte that they might / so yt the
Englysshmen upon a time in a morning went out from the castle the mountenau^ce
of.x. mile / and passed over a bridge. And William Waleys came with a strong
power and drove them back / for the englysshmen had no power against him but
fled / and they yt might take the bridge escaped. But sir Hugh the kings
tresourer there was slain and many other also / wherefore was made much sorrow.
Than had king Edward spedde all his matters in Flau^dres and was comen again in
to England and hastily took his way in to Scotlonde and came thither at ye
Ascencyon tide / and all that he found he set a fire and brent. But ye poor
people of Scotlonde came to him wonders thycke / and prayed him for gods love
to have mercy on them. Wherefore the king commanded yt no man should do them
harm yt were yolde^ to him / ne to no man of order / nor no house of religion
ne no manner church / but let espy where yt he might find any of his enemies.
Than came a spy to ye king and told hy^ where the Scotts were assembled for
to abide battle. And so on saint Mary Magdaleyns day ye king came to Fonkirk
and gave battle to ye Scotts / and at ye battle were slain.xxxiij. M.
scotts / and of englyshmen.xxviij. and no mo / of yt which was a worthy
knight slain an hospytaler yt was called Friar Brian Iay. For when William
Waleys fled from ye battle / that same Brian him pursued fyersly / and as his
horse ran he start in to a mire of a marys up to ye belly / and Willya^ Waleys
than turned again / and there slew sir Bryan / and yt was great harm. And
that while king Edward went through Scotlonde for to inquire if he might
find any of his enemies / and in ye land he dwelled as long as him lyked and
there was none enemy that durst him abide. And soon after yt king Edward went
to Southamton / for he would not abide in Scotlond in winter season for esement
of his people. And when he came to London / he let amend many my^ deeds that
were done against his peace and his laws while he was in Flau^dres

Of the last marriage of king Edward / and how he went the third time in to
Scotlonde.
ANd afterward it was ordained through the court of Rome / that king Edward
should wedde dame Mar garete that was king Philips sister of France. And the
archebysshop Robert of wynchelse spoused the^ togider / through which marriage
there was made peace between king Edward of England and king Philyp of
France. King Edward went than the third time in to Scotlond. And than wtin
ye first year he famysshed the land / so yt he left not one but that al came
to his mercy / save they that were in ye castle of Estreuelyn / that well was
vitayled and stored for.vij. year.

How the castle of Estreuelyn was besyeged and won.
BYnge Edward came to the castle of Estreuelyn with an huge power and besyeged
the castle / but it little auayled For he might do the Scotts no harm the
castle was so strong and well kept. When king Edward saw that / he
bethought him on a queyntyse / and caused anon to make two payr of hye galowes
before the toure of ye castle / and made his oath / that as many as were
within the castle (were he earl or baron) and he were taken with strength
(but if he would the rather yield him) he should be hanged upon ye same payr of
galowes. And when they that were within the castle herd this / they came and
yielded them all to the kings grace and mercy. And the king forgave them all
his ill will. And there were all ye great lords of scotlonde sworn to king
Edward / yt they should come to London to every parlyament / and should stand
to his ordinance.

How Troylebaston was first ordained.
BYng Edward went thens to London / and wend for to have had rest and peace of
his war / in yt which war he was occupied.xx. year / that is to say in
Wales / in Gastoyn and in Scotlonde / and thought how he might recover his
tresour yt he had spended about his war And let inquire through ye realm of
all the time yt he had been out of his realm that men called Troylebaston / and
ordained thereto Justices. And in this manner he recovered tresour without nombre.
And his purpose was for to have gone in to the holy land for to have warred
upon gods enemies / because he was crossed long time before. And nevertheless
the law yt he had ordained did much good through out all England to them
that were mysbode. For those yt trespaced were well chastysed / and afterward
were much more meker and better / and the poor comyns were in rest and peace.
And ye same time king Edward prisoned his own sone Edward / because ye
bishop of Chestre ye kings tresourer had complained on hy^ / saying yt he
through counsel of one Pyers of Ganaston a squire of Gascoyn had broken his
parkes. And this Pyers cou^seyled and ladde this same Edward. And for this
cause king Edward exiled this Pyers out of England.

Of the death of Willyam Waleys the false traitor.
ANd when this king Edward had ouercomen his enemies in Wales / Gascoyn and
Scotlonde / and had destroyed all his traitors / save only ye rybaud Willya^
Waleys / ye never would yield him to ye king / and at ye last he was taken in
the town of saint Dominyk / the.xxxiij. year of king Edwardes regne and was
presented to king Edward. But the king would not se him / and sent him to
London to receive his judgment / and upon saint Barthylmewes even he was
hanged and drawn / and his heed smytten of and his bowelles taken out of his
body and brent / and his body quartred and sent to four of the best towns of
Scotlonde / and his heed put upon a spear and set upon London bridge / in
ensample yt the Scotts should have in mind for to do amysse against their
lyege lord again.

How the Scotts came to king Edward for to amend their trespace that they had
done against him.
ANd at Michelmas next coming king Edward held his parlyament at Westmynster /
and thither came ye Scotts / that is to say / the bishop of saint Andrews /
Robert the Brus earl of Carik / Symond the Frisell / John ye earl of Athell.
And they were accorded with ye king and bound / and by oath swore that if any
of them afterward mysbare them against the king / they should be disheryted
for evermore. And wha^ their peace was thus made / they took their leave and went
home unto their country.

How Robert the Brus challenged Scotlonde.
ANd after this Robert the Brus earl of ^aryk sent by his lettres unto the
earls and barons of Scotlonde that they should come to him to Sconne on the
morrow after the Coucepcyon of our lady for the great needs of the land. And
the lords came at ye day assygned. And the same day sir Robert the Brus
said. Fair lords full well ye know yt in my person dwells the right of
the realm of Scotlonde / and as ye well wot I am ryghtfull heir / sith yt
sir John Baylon that was our king has forsaken us and left his land. And
though it so be that king Edward of England with wrongful power has made me
assent to him against my will / if yt ye will grant yt I may be king of
Scotlonde I shall keep you against king Edward of England / and against all
manner men. And with yt word the abbot of Sconne arose up and before them all
said yt it was reason for to help him and defend ye land and said he would
give him a. M. pound for to maynteyn ye land. And all ye other granted him
the land / and with their power him for to help / and defied king Edward of
England / and said yt Robert the Brus should be king of Scotlonde.

How sir John of Common gaynsayd the crownynge of sir Robert the Brus.
Ordynges said sir John of Common / think on ye troth and oath that ye made to
king Edward of england and as touching my self I will not break mine oath for
no man / and so he went from them / wherefore Robert ye Brus and all tho that
consented to him were ill content with sir John of Common. Tha^ ordained they
another counsel at Domfris / to which came ye foresaid sir John of Common /
for he dwelled but two mile from Domfris there he was wont to soiourne and
abide.

How sir John of Common was traytoursly slain.
ANd wha^ Robert the Brus wist that all the great lords of Scot lord were
come to Sco^ne / save sir John of Common that than abode nygh Sco^ne he sent
specially for the said sir John of Common to come and speak with him. And upon
that he came and spoke with him at the gray freres in Domfris / and that was the
thursday after Candelmasse day / and sir John granted to go with him. And when
he had herd mass / he took a soppe and drank / and afterward he bestrode his
pa^ frey and rode to Domfris. When Robert the Brus saw him come at a wynow as
he was in his chamber / he made toye enough / and came against him / and colled
him about the neck / and made to him good semblau^t. And when all the earls
and barons of Scotlond were there present / Robert ye Brus sayn / syrs ye wot
well the cause of this coming / and where fore it is / if ye will grant that
I may be king of Scotlonde as right heir of the land. And all ye lords yt
were there said with one voice yt he should be crowned king of Scotlond / and yt
they would help hy^ and maynteyn against all men living and dye for him yfnede
were. The gentyl knight John of Common answered. Cet tes never for me: ne for to
have as much help of me as ye value of a button / for ye oath yt I have made
to king Edward of England I shall hold while yt my life lasts. And with ye
word be went from the company and would have lepte upon his plafrey. And Robert
the Brus pursued him with a drawn sword and perced him through the body / and
sir John Common fell down to the earth. But when Roger yt was sir John Comyns
brother saw ye falsues / he stert to Robert ye Brus and smote him with a knyfe /
but ye traitor was armed under / so yt the stroke might do him no harm / and
so much help came about Robert ye Brus / yt Roger Common was there slain and
hewn to pieces And Robert ye Brus turned again where as sir John Comyu the
noble baron lay wounded and drew toward his death besides the hye awter in ye
church of the gray freres / and said unto sir John Common. O traitor thou
shalt be deed and shall never let mine auauncement and shoke his sword at
the hye awter and smote him on the heed yt the brain fell down upon the
ground / and the blood stert on high upon the walls. And yet unto this day
is that blood seen there / and no water may wasshe it away / and so dyed that
noble knight in holy church.

When this traitor Robert ye Brus saw yt no man would let his crownacio^ he
commanded all ye barons to be at saint John's town at his crownacion. And on
the Annu^ciacion of our lady ye bishop of Glaston and ye bishop of saint
Andrews crowned him king. And anon after he drove all the Englysshmen out of
Scotlonde. And they fled and came and complained them unto king Edward how
that Robert the Brus had driven them out of the land and dysheryted them.

How that king Edward dubbed at Westmynster.xxiiij. score knights.
ANd when king Edward herd of this myschete / he swore yt he should be aue^ged
thereof / and hang and draw all the traitors of Scotlonde without rau^som.
Than king Edward sent for all the bachelars of England / that they should come
to London at whytsontyde / and he dubbed at Westmynster.xxiiij. score knights.
Than ordained he to go in to Scotlonde against Robert the Brus / and sent
before hy^ in to Scotlond sir Aymer the valyau^t earl of Pe^broke / and sir
Henry Percy baron with a fair company / yt pursued ye Scotts and brent towns
and castlels And afterward came ye king himself with earls and barons a fair
company.

How Robert the Brus was dyscomfyted in battle / and how Symond Frisell was
slain.
THe frydaye next before the Assumpcyon of our sady king Edward met with
Robert ye Brus and his company beside saint John's to ^^ne in Scotlonde / of yt
which company king Edward slew.vii. M. When Robert the Brus saw this
myschefe / he began to flee and hyd hy^ secretiy / but sir Symod Frisell was
fore pursued / so yt he turned again and abode battle / for he was a worcester thy
knight / but our englysshman show his horse and took him and led him to king
Edward / but or he came to hy^ he began to flatre his takers / pmysyng them.

Theobald of Peuenes that was ye kings arther. Now so god me help it is for
naught yt thou spekest / for all ye gold in englend I would not let the go wout
commandment of king Edward. And king Edward would not se him / but
commanded to lead him to London to have his dome. And on our ladies eve the
Not(...) he was hanged and drawn / and his herd smytten of and hanged again
with chains of ^ren upon the galowes / and his herd was set upon London bridge
on a spear and against Chrystmasse ye body was brent / because that the men
that kept ye body by night saw so many deuylles aboure him / turmentynge him
with yren crokes hortybly upon ye galowes and many that saw them anon after
dyed for dread / and some waxed mad / or fore seek. And in yt battle was taken
ye bishop of Baston and ye bishop of saint Andrews and ye abbot of Sconne
all armed as falls traitors and falls prelates against their oath. And they were
brought to ye king. And the king sent them unto the pope of Rome that he
should do with them his will.

How John earl of Atheles was taken and put to death.
ANd at yt battle fled sir John earl of Atheles / and went in to a church /
and there hyd him for dread / but he might have there no refute / because that
ye church was enterdyted through a general sentence / and in ye same church
he was taken. And this sir John wend well to have escaped fro ye death / because
yt he claymed kynrede of king Edward. And ye king would no longer be betrayed
of his traitors / but sent hy^ to London in haste / and there was hanged and
his heed smytten of / and his body brent. But at the prayer of the queen
Margarete because yt he claymed kynrede of king Edward his drawing was
forgyuen him.

their falsnes and treason / John that was Willyam Waleys brother was taken and
done to death / as sir John earl of Atheles was.

How Robert the Brus fled from Scotlonde to Norway.
ANd at that same time was Roberte the Brus much hated among the people of
Scotlonde / so that he wist not what was best to do / and for to hyde him he
went in to Norway to ye king yt had spoused his sister / and there held hy^

king Edward than let cry his peace through out all the land / and his laws

How king Edward dyed.


ANd when king Edward had abated the pride of his enemies he returned again
south ward / and a malady took him at Burgh upon saudes in the march of
Scotlonde / and he wist well that his death was full nygh / and called to him
sir Henry Lacy earl of Nichol sir Guy earl of warwik / sir Aymer Valence earl
of Penbroke / and sir Robert of Clifford baron / and prayed them upon the faith
yt they ought him / that they should make Edward of Carnaruan king of England
as shortly as they might / and yt they should not suffer Piers of Ganaston come
again in to England for to make his sone to riot. And they granted him with a
good will. Than ye king took ye sacraments of holy church as a good christen
man should / and dyed in very repen tau^ce when he had reigned.xxxv. year / and
was buried at westmynster with great solempnite / on whose god have mercy.

Of Merlyns prophecyes that were declared of king Edward that was king
Henryes sone.
OF this king Edward pphecyed Merlyn / and called him a dragon the second of
the. us. kings that should tegne in England / and said yt he should be meddled
with mercy and also with strength and sternes / that should keep England from
cold and hete. And that he should open his mouth toward Wales / and that he
should set his foot in Wyke / and that he should close with walls yt should do
much harm to his sede. And he said sothe / for the good king Edward was
meddled with mercy and with fyersnes / with mercy against his enemies of Wales /
and after of Scotlo^de with fyersnes wha^ he put them to death for their falsnes
and traytory / as they had deserved it. And well kept he England from cold
and hete / sith he kept it from all manner of enemies that came upon him to do
him any wrong. And well he opened his mouth toward Wales / and made it quake
through ye hidour of his mouth when he conquered it through dynt of sword. For
ye prince Lewlyn and Dauyd his brother / Rys and Morgan were put to death through
their falsnes and their folly. And he set his foot in wike / and conquered
Barwyke / at the which conquest were slain.xxv. M. and. vij.C. out take them
that were brent in the reed hall. And the walls that he let make shall be
noyous unto his sede / as men shall here after se in the life of sir Edward of
Carnaruan his sone. And yet said Merlyn that he should make ryuers ren in blood
and with brayn / and that seemed well in his wars where as he had the maystry.
And yet Merlin said yt there should come a people out of the north west during
the regne of the foresaid dragon / yt should be ladde by an ill greyhou^de / yt
the dragon should crown king / that afterward should flee over ye see for
dread of ye dragon without coming again / and yt was proved by sir John
Bayloll ye king Edward made to be king of Scotlonde / that falsely arose
against him / and after he fled to his own lands of France / and never came
again in to Scotlonde for dread of king Edward. And yet said Meriyn the
people that should led the foresaid greyhou^de should be faderles unto a
certain time / and he said sothe / for ye people of Scotlonde gretely were
dyseased / sith yt sir John Bayloll their kung was fled. And yet laid Merlin
yt the son should become in his time as reed as blood / in tokenynge of great
mortalite of people / and that was well known when ye scotts were ^ay^. And
Merlyn said yt same dragon should nourysshe a fox that should meue great war
against him yt should in his time be ended / and that seemed well by Robert ye
Brus that king Edward noursshed in his chamber / that sythen stale aware and
meued great war against him wh^ the war was not ended in his time. And
afterward Merlyn told yt this dra gone should be holden ye best body of all the
world / and he said sothe for ye good king Edward was ye worthyest knight of
all ye world in his time. And yet said mer lyn yt the dragon should dye in ye
march of an other land / and yt his land should be long without a good keeper
/ and yt men should weep for his death from ye isle of Shepey unto ye isle of
Mercill: wherefore alas shall be their song among ye ^^myn people faderles in
ye land wasted. And ye p^h^ cy was known over all full well. For ye good king
Edward dyed at Burgh upon sands / yt is in the march of Scotlonde wherefore ye
englysshme^ were disco^f^ed and sorowed in Northumberiend because ye king
Edwardes sone set by ye Scotts no force for ye tyot of Pyers of Ganaston
wherefore alas was ye song through out all England for defaute of their good
wardeyn / from ye isle of Shepey unto ye isle of Mareyll ye people made much
sorrow for good king Edwardes death. For they wend yt king Edward should have
gone in to the holy land / for yt was holly his purpose. Upon whose soul god
for his high grace have mercy.

Anno d^^i. M.CC. lxxxiii^.
CElestinus was pope after Nicolas.v. months / and no thing noble of him is
written / but yt he was a virtuous man. Bonifacius the. vii^. was pope after
hy^.viij. year. This Boniface was a man in those things that apperteyneth to
court / for he was very e^pert in such matters. And because he had no pere /
he put no mesure to his prudence / and took so great pride upon him / yt he
said he was lord of all ye world. And many things he did with his might that
failed wretchedly in the end. He gave an ensample to all prelates yt they
should not be proud / but under the form of a very shepeherde of god they
should more study to be loved of their subjects than to be drad. This man is
he of whom it is said yt he entered as a fox / he lived as a lion / and dyed as
a dog. This time the year of grace was ordained from an C. year to an.C. year
/ and the first Jubilee was in ye year of our lord god. M.CCC. Benedictus
the.xj. was pope after Boniface.xi. months. This man was an holy man of ye
order of ye friar prechours and little while lived / but decessed anon.
Adulphus was Emperor.vj. year. This man was ye earl of Anoxone / and was not
crowned by ye pope / for he was slain in battle. Albertus was emperor after
hy^.x. year. This man was ye duke of Austrie / and first was repreued of the
pope / and after was confermed by ye same pope for the malice of the king of
France which was an enemy unto the church. And to that Albert ye same pope
gave the kingdom of france / as he did other kingdoms / but it profyted not /
for at the last he was slain of his neuewe. Cleme^s was pope after Benedictus
almoost.ix. year. This man was a great buylder of castles and other things.
And he dampened ye order of Templers. And he ordained the.vij. book of
decretalles the which be called y^ questyons of Clementyns. And anon after in
a counsel the which he held at Vienna he revoked that same book / the
which his successor John called again / and incorpored it and publysshed it.
This Clement first of al popes translated the popes seet from Rome to Aumyon.
And whyder it was done by the mocyon of god / or by ye boldness of man / diverse
men meruaylleth. John the.xxij. was pope after him xviij. year. This man was
all glorious as for those things that were to be used through the actyfe life.
And he publysshed the Constytucyons of the Clementynes / and sent them to all
ye vniuersitees. And many saints he canonysed. And ye fat bysshopryches he
divided. And he ordained many things against ye plu ralite of benefices / and
many heretykes he dampened / but whyder he was saved or not / our lord god
would not show to those that he loved very well. Henry the.vij. was emperor
after Albert.v. year. This Henry was a noble man in war / and he coueyted to
have peace by land and water. He was a glorious man in battle / and was never
overcome with enemies. And at the last he was poisoned of a friar when that he
houseled him by receyuynge of the sacrament.

Of king Edward that was king Edwardes sone.
ANd after this king Edward reigned Edward his sone / that was borne at
Carnaruan. And this Edward went in to France and there he spoused Isabell ye
kings daughter of France the.xxv. day of January at ye church of our lady
at Boloyn in the year of our lord Jesus Christ a. M.CCC.vij. And the.xx. day
of Feueryer the next year y^ came after he was crowned solemply at Westmynster
of ye archebysshop of Canterbury and of ye archebisshop of winchelse And there
was so great prees of people yt sir John Bakwel was deed and murdered And anon
as the good king Edward was deed / sir Edward his sone king of England sent
after Pyers of Ganaston into Gascoyn / and so much he loved him yt he called
him brother. And anon after he gave him ye lordshyp of Walyngford / and after
yt he gave him ye erledom of Cornewayle against all ye lords will of England.
And tha^ brought he sir Walter of Langton bishop of Chestre to ye tour of
London in prison with two knaves al only to serve him. For ye king was wroth with
hy^ / because yt sir Walter made co^playnt on hy^ to his fader / wherefore he
was put in prison in ye time of Troile baston. And the fore said Piers of
Ganaston made so great maystryes yt he went in to ye kings tresoury in ye
abbey of westmynster and took y^ table of gold with the trestyls of ye same /
and many other rich jewels yt sometime were king Arthurs / and took them to a
merchant yt was called Aymery of (...)and / for he should bear them ouersee in
to Gascoyne / and so he went thens and never came again after / which was a
great loss to this land. And when this Pyers was so rychely auau^ced / he
beca me wonders proud / wherefore al ye great lords of ye realm had hy^ in
despyte for his great berynge / wherefore sir Henry La^y (...) of Nichol / and
sir Guy earl of wa(...) / the which good lords ye good king Edward sir
Edwardes fader king of England charged y^ Pyers of Ganaston should not come in
to England for to bring his sone Edward in to riot. And all y^ lords of
England assembled them on a certain day at y^ ^^eres prechours at London /
and there they spoke of ye dishonor that king Edward did to his realm and to
his crown. And so they assented all both earls and barons and all the comyns
yt the foresaid Pyers of Ganaston should be exiled out of England for ever
more. And so it was done: for he forswore England and went in to Irlonde / and
there ye king made him chefetayn and governor of the land by his co^myssion.
And there this Pyers was chefetayn of all ye land and did there all that him
lyked and had power to do what he would. And yt time were ye temple^s exiled
through all th^^ stendom / because ye men put upon them that they should do
things against the faith and good byl(...). King Edward loved Piers of
Ganaston so much that he might not forbere his company and so much ye king
gave and behyght ye people of England that ye er^lyng of ye foresaid Pyers
should be revoked at Stamford through them yt had e^^led him. Wherefore Pyers of
Ganaston came again in to England. And when he was come^ again in to this
land / he despised ye gretest lords of this land / and called sir ^^bert of
Clare earl of Gloucester (...) and the earl of Nycholl sir Henry La^y
b^rstenbely / and sir Guy earl of warwyk the black hou^de of Arderne and also
be called ye noble earl Thomas of Lancastre churl / and many other scorns and
shames them said / and many other great lords of England* wherefore they were
toward him full angry and wro^^ and tyght ^ore anoyed. And in ye same time dyed
ye earl of Nycholl / but he charged or yt he dyed Thomas earl of Lancaster that
was his sone (...)e that he should maynteyne his quarrel against this same
Pyers of Ganaston upon his blessing. And so it befell through help of the earl
Thomas of Lancastre and also of ye earl of Warwyk that the foresaid Pyers was
heded at Gauersythe beside Warwyk / the.xix. day of June / in the year of
grace a. M.ccc.xij. Wherefore the king was sore anoyed / and prayed god yt he
might se ye day to be avenged upon ye death of ye foresaid Pyers. And so it
befell afterward as ye shall here. Alas the time / for ye foresaid earl of
Lancastre and many other great ba rons were put to pyteous death and marty red
because of the foresaid quarrel. The king was than at London and held a
parliament / and ordained the laws of sir Symond Mounford / wherefore the earl
of Lancastre and the other earls and all ye clergy of England made made an
oath through counseyle of Robert of Wynchelse for to maynteyn tho ordinances
for evermore.

How Robert the Brus came again in to Scotlonde / and gadred a great power of
men for to war upon king Edward.
ANd when sir Robert the Brus that made hy^ king of Scotlond that before was
fled in to Norway for dread of death of ye good king Edward / and also he herd
of the debate yt than was in England between ye king and his lords he
ordained an host and came in to England in to Northumberlond / and clean
destroyed ye country. And when king Edward herd these tidings he let
assemble his host and met ye Scotts at Estre uelyn on the day of ye
Natiuite of saint John Baptyst / in the third year of his regne / and in the
year of grace.M.ccc.xiiij. Alas ye sorrow and loss yt there was done. For
there was slain the noble earl Gylbert of Clare / sir Robert Clifford baron
and there king Edward was disco^fited / and Edmond of Maule the kings steward
for dread went and drowned himself in a fresshe river yt is called
Bannokesborne Wherefore they said in reprofe of king Edward for as much as he
loved to go by water / and also for he was discomfyted at Bannokesborne /
therefore ye maidens made a song thereof in ye country of king Edward / and in
this manner they song. Maidens of england sore may ye morn
for tyt have lost your lemmans at Bannokesborne /
with heuelogh /
what weneth the king of England to have gotten Scotlonde
with rombilogh.
When king Edward was discomfited wonders fast he fled with his folk yt were
left alive / and went to Barwyk / and there held hy^. And after he took
hostages / yt is to say / two children of ye rychest of the town / and the
king went to London / and took counsel of things yt were needful unto ye
realm of England. In this time it befell that than was in England a rybaud
yt was called John Tanner / and he said yt he was the good king Edwardes sone /
and let call him Edward of Carnaruan / and therefore he was taken at Oxford /
and there he challenged the friar Carmes church ye king Edward had given them
/ the which church sometime was the kings hall. And afterward was this John
ladde to Northamton / and drawn and hanged for his falsnes / and or that he
was deed he confessed and said before al those that were there that the devil
behyght him yt he should be king of England / and that he had served the
devil three year.

How the town of Barwyk was taken through treason / and how two cardynals were
robbed in England.
ON mydlent sunday in the year of our lord Jesus Christ. M.ccc.xvj. Barwyk was
lost through falls treason of one Pyers of Spaldyng / the which Pyers king
Edward had put there for to keep the same town with many burgeyses of the
same town. Wherefore the children that were put in hostage through the
burgeyses of Barwyk followed ye kings marchalse many days fettred in strong
yrens. And after that time there came two cardynals in to England / which ye
pope had sent for to make peace between England and Scotlonde. And as they went
toward Durham for to have sacred master Lowys of Beaumont bishop of Durham /
they were taken and ^obbed upon the more of Wynglesoown. Of which robbery sir
Gylbert of Middelton was atteynt and taken / and drawn and hanged at London /
and his heed smytten of and put upon a spear / and set upon new gate / and the
four quarters sent to four citees of England And that same time befell many
myscheues in England / for the poor people dyed for hunger / and so much and
so fast dyed that uneath men might them bury. For a quarter of whete was worth
xl. shyllynges / and two year and an half a quarter of whete was worth.x.
mark. And often times the poor people stale children and ete them / and ete
also all the hou^des that they might take / and also horses and cattes. And
after there fell a great moreyn among beestes in diverse countrees of England
during king Edwardes life time.

How the Scotts robbed Northumberlonde.
ANd in the same time came the Scotts again in to England and destroyed
Northumberlonde / and brent and robbed that land / and slew men and women /
and children that lay in their cradels / and brent also chirches and destroyed
chrystendom / and took and bare English me^nes goods as they had be^
sarasyns or paynyms / and of the wyckednes yt they did all chrystendom spoke of
it.

How the Scotts would not amend their trespace / and therefore Scotlonde was
enterdyted.
ANd wha^ pope John the.xxij. after saint Peter herd of ye great sorrow and
myschefe yt the scotts wrought he was wonders sorry that christendom was so
destroyed through the Scotts / and namely yt they destroyed so chirches
wherefore ye pope sent a general sentence under his bulls of leed unto the
archebysshop of Caunterbury and to the archebysshop of york / that if Robert
ye Brus of Scotlonde would not be justified and make amends unto ye king of
England Edward their lord / and make amends of his harms yt they had done /
and also to restore the goods yt they had taken of holy church / that ye
sentence should be pronounced through out all England. And when ye Scotts
herd this / they would not leave their malice for the popes commau^deme^t /
wherefore Robert the Brus James Douglas / and Thomas Randulf earl of Moref / and
all those that with them comoned or help them in word or deed were accursed in
every church through out all England every day at mass.iii. times / and no
mass should be song in holy church through out all Scotlonde but if ye
Scotts would make restitucyon of the harms yt they had made unto holy church
/ wherefore many a good priest and holy men therefore were slain through the
realm of Scotlonde / because they would not sing mass against ye popes
commandment and against his will and to do and fulfill the tyrauntes will.

How sir Hugh Spensers sone was made the kings chamberlayne / and of the
battle of Mitone.
ANd it was not long afterward that ye king ne ordeyued a parliament at york
/ and there was sir Hugh Spensers sone made chamberlain. And the mean time
while the war lasted the king went again in to Scotlonde yt it was wonder to
wit / and besyeged the town of Barwyk / but ye Scotts went over ye water of
Solewath yt was three mile from ye kings host / and pryuely they stale away by
night and came in to england and robbed and destroyed all yt they might / and
spared no manner thing till yt they came to york. And when ye englysshmen that
were left at home herd these tidings all tho yt might travail as well monks
priests / freres / thano^s and seculers came and met with the scotts at Miton
vpswale the.xij. day of October. Alas ye sorrow / for the englisshe husbondmen
that could no thing of war there were slain and drow ned in an arm of ye
see. And ye chefetaynes sir William of Melton archebisshop of york: and ye
abbot of selby with their stedes fled and came to york / and yt was their own
folly yt they had yt mischau^ce / for they pas sed ye water of swale / and ye
scotts set a fire the stackes of hey: and ye smoke thereof was so huge yt the
englysshmen might not se the scotts. And when ye Englysshmen were gone over ye
water / than came the Scotts with their wynge in manner of a shield and came
toward ye englysshmen in array / and the englysshmen fled / for uneath they
had any men of arms / for the king had them almoost lost at ye syege of Barwyk
/ and the scotts hoblers went between the bridge and the englysshmen. And when
ye great host them met / the englysshmen fled between ye hoblers and ye
great host / and the Englysshmen almoost were there slain / and they yt might
go over the water were saved / but many were drowned. Alas for there were
slain many men of relygyon / seculers / priests and clerks: and with much
sorrow ye archebisshop escaped: and therefore ye Scotts called that battle the
white battle.

How king Edward did all manner thing that sir Hugh Spenser would.
ANd when king Edward herd these tidings / he remeued his syege from Barwik
and came again in to England. But sir Hugh Spenser the sone that was ye kings
chamberlayne kept so the kings chamber / yt no man might speak with ye king.
But he had made with him a f^ette for to do all his need / and yt over mesure.
And this Hugh bare him so stout / that all men had of him scorn and despyte.
And the king himself would not be governed ne ruled by no manner man but only
by his fader and by him. And if any knight of England had wodes / manners or
lo^des / that they would coueyte / anon ye king must give it them / or else the
man that ought it should be falsely endyted of forfayte or felouy. And through
such doing they disheryted many a bacheler / and so much loud he gate that
it was great wonder. And when ye lords of England saw ye great couetyse and
the falsnes of sir Hugh Spenser the fader and sir Hugh the sone / they came to
ye gentle earl of Lancastre and asked him of counsel of the disease that was
in ye realm through sir Hugh Spenser and his sone. And in haste by one assent
they made a preuy assemble at Shyrburne in Elmede / and they made there an oath
for to break and dystrouble ye doing between ye king and sir Hugh spen ser and
his sone upon their power. And they went in to ye march of wales and destroyed
the land of the foresaid sir Hughes.

How sir Hugh Spenser and his fader were exiled out of England.
When king Edward saw ye great harm and destruccyon that the barons of
England did to sir Hugh Spen sers land and to his sons in every place yt they
came upon / the king than through his counsel exiled sir John Mombray / sir
Roger Clifford / and sir Gosselin Dauil and many other lords yt were
co^sentynge to them / wherefore the barons did than more harm than they did
before. And when ye king saw ye the barons would not cease of their cruelte /
the king was sore adrad lest they would destroy him and his realm for his
mayntenau^ce / but if he assented to them / and so he sent for them by lettres
yt they should come to London to his parliament at a certain day as in his
lettres were contained. And they came with three batayles well armed at all
points / and every battle had cote armures of grene cloth / and thereof the
right quarter was yelowe with white bendes / wherefore that parliament was called
ye parlyament of the white bend. And in that company was sir Vmfrey of Bohoune
earl of Herford / and sir Roger Clifford / sir John Mombray / sir Gosselyn
Dauyll / sir Roger Mortimer of Wygmore / sir Henry of Trais / sir John Gif fard
/ and sir Barthilme we of Badelsmore that was the kings steward / that the
king had sent to Shyrbur^ein Elmede to ye earl of Lancastre / and to all that
were with him for to treat of accord / yt him alyed to the barons / and came
with that company. And sir Roger Dammorie / and sir Hugh Dandale ye had spoused
ye kings neces sister / and sir Gylbert of Clare earl of Glocestre yt was
slain in Scotlonde as before is said. And those two lords had than two
parties of the erledome of Glocestre / and sir Hugh Spenser the sone had ye
third part in his wives half the third sister / and those two lords went to
ye barons with all their power against sir Hugh their brother (...) law / and so
there came with them sir Roger Clifford / sir John Mombray / sir Gosselyn
Dauyll / sir Roger Mortymer of Wygmore his neuew / sir Henry Trais / sir John
Giffard / sir Barthylmewe of Badelsmore with all their company and many other
y^ to them were consentyng. All the great lords came to Westmynster to the
kings parliament / and so they spoke and did ye both sir Hugh Spenser the
fader and also the sone were outlawed of England for evermore. And so sir Hugh
the fader went to Dover and made much sorrow / and fell down upon y^ ground
by ye see bank acrosse with his arms / and sore weeping said. Now fair
England and good Eng land to almighty god I the betake / and thryes kyssed ye
ground / and wend never to have comen again / and weeping cursed the time yt
ever he begat sir Hugh his sone / and said for hy^ he had lost all england
and in presence of all gave him his curse and went over the sea to his lands.
But (...) Hugh the sone would not go out of England / but held him on ye see
and he and his company robbed two Dromondes beside Sandwyche / and took and
bare away all ye was in them / the value of.xl. M. pound.

How the king exiled ye earl Thomas of Lancastre / and all that held with him
and how Mortimer came and yielded him to the king / and of the lords.
IT was not long after ye the king ne made sir Hugh Spenser the ^a der and sir
Hugh the sone come again in to England against the lords will of the realm.
And soon after the king with a strong power came and besyeged the castle of
Ledes / and in the castle was the lady of Badelsmore because ye she would not
grant that castle to the queen I sabell king Edwardes wife. But ye
princypall cause was because ye sir Barthilmewe was against the king and held
with the lords of England / and nevertheless the king by help and socour of
men of London / and also of help of southeren men gate the castle maugre of
them all that were within / and took with them all that they might find. And
when the barons of England herd these tidings / sir Roger Mor^^mer and many
other lords took the town of Burgworth with strength / wherefore the king was
wonders wroth / and let outlawe Thomas of Lancaster / and Vmfrey de Bohoune
earl of Herford / and all those that were assentyng to the same quarrel. And
the king assembled an huge host / and came against the lords of England /
wherefore the Mortimers put them in the kings mercy and grace. And anon they
were sent to the toure of London / and there kept in prison. And when ye
barons herd this thing they came to Pou^tfret castle / where as the earl
Thomas soiourned / and told him how that ye Mortimers both had yielded them to
ye king / and put them i his grace.

Of the syege of Tykhyll.
When Thomas earl of Lancastre herd this / he was wonders wroth and all yt were
of his company / and greatly they were disco^forted / and ordained their power
together / and besyeged the castle of Tykhyll. But those that were within manly
defended them / that the barons could not get the castle. And when the king
herd yt his castle was besyeged he swore by god and by his names / that ye
syege should be remeued / and assembled an huge power of people and went
thyderward to rescowe the castle / and his power increased from day to day.
When the earl of Lancastre / and the earl of Herford / and the barons of their
company herd of this thing / they assembled all their power and went to
Burton upon Trent and kept ye bridge yt the king should not pass over. But it
befell so on the.x. day of March in the year of grace. M.ccc.xxj. the king
and the Spensers / sir Aymer of Valau^ce earl of Penbroke / and Ioh^erle of
Aru^dell and their power went over the water and discom^yted the earl Thomas
and his com pany. And they fled to the castle of Tutbery / and from thens to
Pou^tfret. And in ye vyage dyed sir Roget Danmore in the abbey of Tuthery. And
that same time the earl Thomas had a traitor with him that was called Robert
Holand a knight that ye earl had brought up of naught / and had nourysshed him
in his buttry / and had given him a. M. mark of land by year / and so much
the earl loved him yt he might do in ye earls court all yt him lyked with hye
and low / and so craftily the thief bare him / yt his lord trusted him more
than any man on live. And the earl had ordained him by his lettres for to go in
to the erledom of Lancaster to make men arise to help him in yt viage / that
is to say.v.C. men of arms. But the false traitor came not there no manner
men for to warn ne reyse to help his lord. And when the false traitor herd
tell yt his lord was disco^fited at Burton upon Trent / as a falls traitor
thief stale away and robbed in Rauensdele his lords men yt came from the
disco^fyture / and took of them horse and harneys and all yt they had and slew
of them all that he might take / and came and yielded him to the king. When the
good earl Thomas wist yt he was so betrayed / he was sore abashed / and said
to himself. O almighty god how might Robert Holand find in his heart me to
betraye / sith I loved him so much. O god well may now a man se by hy^ / yt no
man may deceive an other rather than he that he trusts most upon / he has
full evil yielded me ye goodness and ye worship yt I have done to him / and
through my kyndnes have auau^ced him and made him hye where that he was low /
and he makes me go from high unto low / but yet shall he dye an evil death.

Of the discomfyture of Burbrygge.
^He good earl sir Thomas of Lancastre / Vmfrey de Bohoune earl of Herford /
and the barons that were with them took counsel between them at the freres
prechours in Pou^fret / Thomas of Lancastre than thought upon ye treason of
Robert Holand / and said in reprefe. Alas Robert Holand has me betrayed / aye
is the reed of some evil shreed. And by the common assent they should go to the
castle of Dunstanburgh / ye which apperteined to the erledom of Lancastre /
and that they should abide there till that the king had forgyuen them his
maletale^t. But when the good earl Thomas herd this / he answered in this
manner and said. Lords said he / if we go toward ye north the northeren men
will say that we go toward the Scotts / and so we shall be holden traitors
/ for cause of distau^ce yt is between king Edward and Robert the Brus that
made him king of Scotlond and therefore I say as touching my self I will not
go no ferther in to the north than to mine own castle of Pountfret. And when
sir Roger Clifford herd this he arose up anon in wrath and drew his sword on
high / and swore by almighty god and by his holy names / but if that he would
go with them / he should there slay hy^. The noble and gentle earl Thomas was
sore adrad and said. Fair syrs I will go with you whether so ever ye me bydde.
Than went they togider in to ye north / and with them they had. vij.C. men of
arms / and came to Burbrygge. When sir Andrewe of Herkela yt was in the north
country through ordinance of the king for to keep ye country of Scotlonde
herd tell how ye Thomas of Lancastre was dyscomfyted and his company at Burton
upon Trent / he ordained him a strong power / and sir Symond Ward also / that
than was shyref of york / and me^te the barons at Burbrygge / and anon they
brake ye bridge that was made of tree. And when ye earl Thomas of Lancastre
herd that sir Andrewe of Herk^^a had brought with him such a power / he was
sore adrad / and sent for sir Andrewe of Herkela / and with him spoke / and
said to him in this manner. Sir Andrewe said he / ye may well understand how yt
out lord the king is ladde and mysgouerned by much false cou^sey^e through
sir Hugh Spenser the fader and sir Hugh his sone / and sir John earl of
Arundell / and through master Robert Baldok a false pylled clerk / that now
is dwelling in ye kings court. Wherefore I pray you that ye will come with us
with all the power that ye have ordained and help to destroy ye venym of
England, and the traitors that been therein / and we will give unto you all ye
best part of.v. (...)domes that we have and hold / and we will make unto you
an oath yt we will never do thing without your counseyle / and so ye shall be
eft as well with us as ever was Robert Holand. Than answered sir Andrewe of
Herkela and said. Sir Thomas that would I not do no consent thereto for no manner
thing ye might me give without the will and commandment of our lord the king
/ for than should I be holden a traitor for evermore. And when yt the noble
earl Thomas of Lancastre saw yt he would not consent to him for no manner
thing / he said. Sir Andrew will ye not consent to destroy ye ve(...) of the
realm as we be / consent at one word / sir Andrewe I tell the that or this
year be passed that ye shall be taken and holden for a traitor / and more than
any of you hold us now / and of a worse death ye shall dye than ever did knight
in England / and understand well yt ye did never thing yt sorer shall repent
you / and now go and do what you good lyketh / and I will put me in to the
mercy of god. And so went the false traitor tyrau^t and as a falls forsworn
man. For through ye noble earl Thomas of Lancastre he received the arms of
chyualry / and of him was made knight. Than might men searchers draw the^ on
that one side and on yt other / and knights also / and tha^ fought together
wonders sore And also among all other sir Humfrey de Boughon earl of Herforde
a worthy knight of renome through all chrystendom stood and fought with his
enemies upon the bridge / and as ye noble lord stood and fought upon ye bridge
/ a thief rybaud skulked under the bridge and fyersly with a spear smote the
noble knight in to the fou^dament / so ye his bowelles fell about his feet.
Alas for sorrow / for there was slain the flower of solace and comfort and
also of curteysy. And sir Roger of Clifford a noble knight stood ever and
fought / and well and worthily him defended / but at ye last he was sore
wounded in his heed / and sir Willyam of S^llay and sir Roger of Bernefelde
were slayue at yt battle. When sir Andrewe of Herkela saw yt sir Thomas men
of Lancastre lessed and slaked / anon he and his company came unto ye gentle
^ayght / and said unto him with an hye voice. Yield the traitor yield the. The
gentle earl Thomas than answered and said. Nay lords / traitors be we none
and to you we will us never yield while that our lives lasts / but rather
will we dye^^ our treuth than yield us unto you. And sir Andrewe again beheld
sir Thomas and his company yellynge and cryenge as a wood wolf and said. Yield
you traitors taken yield you / saying with an hye voice / beware syrs yt none
of you be so hardy upon life and ly^^ (...)e to mis^o Thomas body of Lancastre.
And with that word the good earl Thomas went into the cha^e^^ and said k^elyng
upon his knees / and turned his vysage toward the cross and said. Almighty
god unto the I yield me / and holly I put me unto thy mercy. And with that the
vylayns and rybaudes lepte about him on every side as tyrauntes and wood
turmentours / and despoyled him of his ar mure / and clothed him in a robe of
raye that was of his squyers lyuerey / and forth ladde him unto York by water.
Than might men se much sorrow and care. For the gentle knights fled on every
side and ye rybaudes and vylayns egerly them descryed / and cried on high /
yield you traitors yield you. And when they were yolden / they were robbed and
bound as thieves. Alas the shame and despyte that ye gentle order of
knyghthode had there at that battle. And the land was than without law / for
holy church had than no more reverence tha^ if it had been a brodell house. And
in that battle was the fader against the sone / and the uncle against the
neuewe. For so much unkindness there was never seen before in England as was
that time among folks of one nacyon. For one kynrede had no more ^yte on that
other / than an ho(...)gry wolf has of a sheep, and it was no wonder. For the
great lords of England were not all borne of o^^ ^a^yon / but were (...)edled
with other na(...)s / that is for to say / some were Brytons some Sa^o^s /
some ^^nes / some Pehytes / some Fren(...) / some Norma^s / Spanya^des /
Romans / Heno^ers / (...) F^em^^ges / with m^^y other ^^oyons the which
nacyons ac(...)ed not to the kind blood of England. And if so gret^ lords ha^
be^ only ^^dded ^o ^nglysshe people / than should rest and pe^s have been
a(...)ge them without o^y en^^y. And at ye battle were taken prisoners sir
Roger E(...)ord / sir John M(...)bray sir Wyllyam Tuchit / sir Willyam ^itz
Willyam / and many other worthy knygh tes there were taken at that battle. And
sir Hugh Dandell the next day after was taken and put in to prison / and
should have be^ done to death if he had not spoused the kings nece that was
earl Gylbertes sister of Glocestre. And anon after was sir Barth^^mew of
Badelsmere taken at Stowe park / a manoyr of the bishop of Lyncolnes / that
was his neuewe / and many other barons and baronets wherefore was made much
sorrow.

How sir Thomas of Lancastre was byheded at Pountfret / and.v. barons and a
knight drawn and hanged there.
NOw I shall tell you of the noble earl sir Thomas of Lancastre. When he was
taken and brought to york many of the cite were full glad / and upon him cried
with an high voice. O sir traitor ye be welcome / blyssed be god / for now ye
shall have the reward that long time ye have deserved. And cast upon him many
snow balls / and many other reproues they did him. But the gentle earl
suffered all and said not one word again. And at ye same time the king herd
of this disco^fyture / and was full glad / and in haste came to Pou^tfret and
sir Hugh Spenser and sir Hugh his sone / and sir John earl of Arundel / and sir
Edmond of wodstok the kings brother earl of Kent / sir Aymer of Valau^ce earl
of Penbroke / and master Robert Baldok a falls pylled clerk / that was preuy
and dwelled in the kings court / and all came thither with the king. And the
king entered in to the castle. And sir Andrewe of Herkela a falls tyrau^t
through ye kings commandment took with him the gentle earl Thomas to
Pountfret / and there he was prysoned in his own castle that he had new made
/ that stood against the abbey of king Edward. And sir Hugh Spenser the fader
and his sone cast in their thoughts how and in what manner the good earl Thomas
of Lancastre should be put to death without any judgment of his peers. Wherefore
it was ordained through ye kings Justices that the king should put upon him
points of treason. And so it befell that he was led to bar before the
kings Justices bare heded as a thief in a fair hall in his own castle where
as he had made many a great feast to rich and poor. And these were his
Justices sir Hugh Spenser the fader / and Aymer of ^a^a^^e earl of Penbroke /
sir Edmond of wodstok earl of Kent / sir John of Brytayn earl of Rychmond / and
sir Robert Mal^m(...) Justice / and this sir Robert him acou^ped in this manner.
Thomas at the first our lord ye king and this court excludes y^u of all
manner answer. Thomas our l^^d the king puts upon you yt ye have (...) his
lo^d ryden with baner displayed against his peace as a traitor. And with that
word yt gentle earl Thomas with an (...) voice said. Nay lords forsooth and by
^a^^ Thomas I was never traitor. The Justice said again. Thomas our lord the
king puts upon you yt ye have robbed his folk and murdered his people as a
thief. Thomas also ye king puts (...) you yt he disco^fyted you and your
people with his folk in his own realm wherefore ye went and ^^ed to ye wode as
an (...). And Thomas as a traitor ye ought to be hanged by reason but the king
has forgyuen you that Judgment for ^^ue of queen Isabell. And Thomas reason
would that ye should be hanged but the king has forgyuen you yt judgment for
love of your lygnage. But Thomas for as much as ye were taken fleing and as
an ou^lawe ye king will yt your heed be smytten of as ye have well deserved
Anoue have him out of pr^es and bring him to his judgment. When ye gentle
knight Thomas had herd al these worcester des / with an hye voice he cried sore
weeping and said. Alas saint Thomas fair fader / alas shall I be deed thus.
Grant me now blissedfull god answer. But all auayled him ^o thing. For the
cursed Gascoyns put him hyder and thither / and on him cried with an hye voice. O
king Arthur most terryble and dredefull / well known is now thyn open
traytory / an evil death shall thou anon dye / as thou have well deserved it.
And than they set upon his heed in scorn an old chapelet that was all to rent
that was not worth an halfpeny. And after that they set hy^ upon a l^ne white
palfrey full unseemly / and also all bare / and with an old brydell and with
an horrible noise they drove him out of the castle toward his death / and they
cast upon him many balls of snow in despyte. And as the traitors ladde him
out of the castle he said these pyteous words / holding up his hands toward
heaven. Now the king of heaven give us mercy / for ye erthly king has us
forsaken. And a friar prechour went with him out of the castle till he came to
the place that he ended his life / unto whom he shroue hy^ of all his life. And
the gentle earl held the friar wonders fast by the clothes and said to him.
Fair fader abide with us till that I be deed / for my flesh quaketh for
dread of death. And the sothe to say / the gentyl earl set him upon his knees
and turned him toward ye eest. But a rybaud that was called Higone of Moston
set hand upon the gentyl earl / and said in despyte of him. Sir traitor turn
the toward ye Scotts thy foul death to receive / and turned him toward the
north. The noble earl Thomas answered than with a mylde voice and said. Now
fair lords I shall do your will. And with ye word the friar went from him
sore weeping And anon a rybaud went to him and smote of his heed the.xi. Kal.
of Apryll / in the year of grace. M.CCC. and.xxi. Alas yt ever such a gentle
blood should be put to death without cause and reason. And traytoursly was the
king counseyled when he through the false counsel of ye Spensers suffered sir
Thomas his uncles sone to be put to such a death and so by heded against all
reason. And great pite it was also yt such a noble king should be deceived
and mysgouerned through counsel of ye falls Spensers the which he maynteyned
through loselry against his honor and also profit. For afterward there fell
great vengeance in England because of the foresaid Thomas death. When the
gentle earl of his life was passed / the pryour and ye monks of Pou^tfret gate
the body of sir Thomas of the king / and they buried it before the hye awter on
ye right side. That same day that this ge^tyl knight was deed / there were
hanged and drawn for ye same quarrel at Pou^tfret / sir Wyllyam Tuchet / sir
William fitz William / sir Warreyn of ysell / sir Henry of Bradborne / and sir
Wyllyam Chayny / barons all / and John Page squire. And soon after at York
were drawn and hanged sir Roger Clifford sir John of Mambray barons / and sir
Goselyn Dauyll knight. And at Brystowe were drawn and hanged / sir Henry of
wemyngton / and sir Henry Mounford barons. And at Glocestre were drawn and
hanged sir John Geffard / and sir Willyam of Elmebrugge barons. And at London
were drawn and hanged / sir Henry Ties baron. And at Wynchelse sir Thomas
Colepeper knight. And at Wyndsore was drawn and hanged sir Frau^ceys of
waldenham baron. And at Canterbury was drawn and hanged sir Barthylmewe
Badelsmore / and sir Barthylmewe of Asshebourneham barons / And at Cardyfe in
Wales sir Willyam Flemmynge baron.

How king Edward went in to Scotlonde with an hundred thousand men of arms /
and might not speed.
ANd wha^ king Edward of England had brought the flower of chyualry unto their
death through coun seyle and consent of sir Hugh Spenser the fader / and sir
Hugh the sone / he became as wood as any lion. And what so ever the Spensers
would have / it was done / so well the king loved them that they might do with
him all thing yt them lyked / wherefore ye king gave to sir Hugh Spenser the
fader the erledom of Wynchestre / and to sir Andrewe of Herkela the erledom of
Cardoyll in preiudyce and in harming of his crown. And king Edward than
through counsel of ye Spensers disheryted all them that had been against hy^
in any quarrel with Thomas of Lancastre / and many other were disheryted also /
because yt the Spensers coueyted to have their lo^des / and so they had all
that they would desire with wrong and against all reason. Than made ye king
Robert Baldok a falls pylled clerk chau^ celer of England / through counsel
of ye foresaid Spensers / and he was a falls rybaude and a covetous. And so they
cou^seyled the king much that the king let take to his own ward all ye goods
of ye lords yt were put wrongfully to death in to his own hands. And as well
they took the goods yt were wtin holy church as ye goods yt were without / and
let them be put in to his tresoury in London / and let them call his forfeytes.
And by their counsel the king wrought / for evermore he disheryted them yt
ought the goods. And through their cou^se^le let arere a tallage of all ye
goods of England / wherefore he was ye richest kyg ye ever was in england after
Willyam bas^ard of Norman^y ye conquered England. And yet through counseyle of
them hy seemed ye he had not enough / but made yet every town of England for
to find a man of arms upon their own costs / for to go and war upon the
Scotts yt were his enemies / wherefore ye king went in to scotlonde with an.C. M.
men of arms at whitsontyde in ye year of our lord. M.CCC.xxij. But the scotts
went and hyd them in wodes and in mountains and tarried ye englysshmen fro day
to day / yt the king might for no manner thing find them in playn^ (...)
wherefore many englisshmen ye had (...) vytayles dyed there for honger wonders
fast / and sod^ynly in going and coming and namely those that had been against
Thomas of Lancaster and robbed his men upon his lo^des. When king Edward saw
yt vytayles failed him / he was wonders sore dysco^forted / because also yt his
men dyed: and for he might not speed of his enemies. So at ye last he came
aga(...) to England. And anon after came James douglas and also Thomas (...)
huge host into Northumberlonde and with them ye englysshmen yt were driven out
of England / and came and robbed ye (...) and slew the people and also br^nt
a ^owne that was called Northall(...) and many other towns to York. And when
the king herd these tidings he let ^^m^n all manner of men that might
travail. And so the Englysshmen met y^ Scotts at the abbey of ^eyghlonde
the.xv. day after Myghelmasse in y^ sam^ year above said and the Englysshmen
were discomfyted. And at that dyscomfytu^^ was taken sir John of Brytayn earl
of Rychemond that held the cou^tre^ and the erledome of Lancastre and after he
paid an huge raunsom and was let go And after that he went in to France / and
came never afterward again.

How sir Andrewe of Herkela was taken and put to death y^ was earl of Cardoyll.
THan at y^ time was sir Andrew of Herkela that new was made earl of Cardoyll
/ because y^ he had taken the good earl Thomas of Lancastre. He had ordained
through y^ kings co^mau^ deme^t of England for to bring him all the power y^
he might for to help hy^ against y^ Scotts at y^ abbey of Beyghlonde. And
when the false traitor had gadred all y^ people y^ he might and should have
come^ to y^ king to y^ abbey of Beighlond / the false traitor ladde them by an
other country through Copelonde / and through y^ erledom of Lancastre / and
went through y^ country and robbed and slew folk all y^ he might. And
ferthermore y^ falls traitor had taken a great so^me of gold and silver of sir
James Douglas for to be against y^ king of England / and to be helpyng and
holdyng with the scotts / through whose treason y^ king of England was
discomfyted at Beighlonde or y^ he came thither. Wherefore y^ king was toward
him wonders wroth / and let pryuely inquire by y^ country about how y^ it was.
And so men inquired and espied / that at y^ last the troth was found and
sought / and he atteynt and taken as a falls traitor / as the good earl Thomas
of Lancaster him told / or that he was put to death at his taking at
Burbrydge / and to him said / or that year were done he should be taken and
holden a traitor. And so it was as y^ holy man said. Wherefore the king sent
privily to sir Anthony of Lucy a knight of the country of Cardoyll that he
should take sir Andrewe of Herkela and put him to death. And to bring this
thing to an end / the king sent his co^myssyon / so that this same Andrewe
was taken at Cardoyll and led to the bar in y^ manner of an earl worthily
arrayed / and with a sword gyrde about him / and boted and sporred. Tha^ spoke
sir Anthony in this manner / sir Andrewe said he / the king puts upon the
for as much as y^ have benorped in thy deeds he did to the much honor / and
made the earl of Cardoyll and thou as a traitor to thy lord laddest the
people of his country y^ should have help him at y^ battle of Beighlond /
and thou laddest them away by y^ country of Copelonde and through y^ erledom
of Lancastre / wherefore our lord y^ king was disco^fyted there of the Scotts
through thy treason and falsnes / and if thou had comen betymes he had had
the battle / And treason y^ dydest for y^ great sum of gold and silver that
thou received of James Douglas a Scotte the kings enemy. And our lord y^ king
will that the order of knyghthode by the which y^ received all thine honor
and worship upon thy body / be all brought to naught and thine estate undone /
y^ other knights of lower degree may after be ware / the which lord has
hugely auaunced the in diverse countries of England / and that all may take
ensample by y^ / their lord afterward truly for to serve. Than commanded he a
knave anoue to hew of his sporres on his heles. And after he let break the
sword over his heed / the which the king gave him for to keep and defend his
land therewith when he had made him earl of Cardoyl. And after he let hy^ be
unclothed of his furred tabard and of his hode / and of his furred cotes / and
of his gyrdell. And wha^ this was done sir Anthony said than to him. Andrew
said he / now art thou no knight / but a knave / and for thy treason the king
will that y^ shalt be hanged and drawn / and thy heed smytten of / and thy
bowelles taken out of thy body and brent before the and thy body quartred / and
thy heed sent to London / and there it shall stand upon London bridge / and
the four quarters shall be sent to four towns of England / that all other
may be ware and chastised by the And as sir Anthony said / so it was done all
manner thing on y^ last day of October / in the year of grace. M.CCC.xxij. And
y^ son turned in to blood as y^ people it saw / and that dured from y^
morrow till it was.xj. of the clock of the day.

Of y^ miracles that god wrought for saint Thomas of Lancastre / wherefore the
king let close in the church doors of the pryory of Pountfret / that no man
should come therein for to offer.
ANd soon after that y^ good earl Thomas of Lancaster was martyred / there was
a priest that long time had been blind / dremed in his sleep y^ he should go
to y^ hill there y^ good earl Thomas of Lancastre was put to death / and he
should have his sight again / and so he dremed three nyghtes suynge / and y^
priest let led him to y^ same hill / and when he came to the place y^ he was
martyred on / full devoutly he made there his prayers / and prayed god and
saint Thomas y^ he might have his sight again / and as he was in his prayers /
he laid his right hand upon y^ same place y^ the good man was martyred on /
and a drop of dry blood and small sand cleued on his hand / and therewith
stryked his eyes / and anon through the might of god and saint Thomas he had
his sight again / and thanked than almighty god and saint Thomas. And wha^
this miracle was known among men / y^ people came thither on every side and
kneled and made their prayers at his tomb that is in y^ pryory of Pou^tfret /
and prayed y^ holy martyr of socour and help / and god herd their prayers.
Also there was a young child drowned in a well in y^ town of Pou^tfret / and
was deed three days and three nyghtes / and men came and laid y^ deed chilo^
upon saint Thomas tomb y^ holy martyr / and the child arose from death to life
/ as many a man it saw. Also much people were out of their mind / and god
sent them their mind again / through virtue of y^ holy martyr. Also god has
given there to exepyls their going / and to crooked their hands and their feet
/ and to blind also their fight and to many seek folk their health of byuers
dyseases / for y^ love of this martyr. Also there was a rich man in Co^^ dom
in Gascoyn / and such a malady he had that all his right side ro^^ed and fell
away from him y^ men might se his ^^uer and his heart / and so he stanke y^
uneath men might come nigh hy^ / wherefore his friends were for him wonders sorry
/ but at the last as god would they prayed to saint Thomas of Lancastre y^ he
would pray to god for that prisoner / and behyght to go to Pou^tfret for to do
their pilgrimage he thought y^ the martyr sam^ Thomas came to him and anou^ted
over all his seek body / and therewith the good man aweke and was all hole / and
his flesh was restored again y^ before was torred and fallen away For which
miracle the good man and his friends loved god and saint Thomas ever more
after. And this good man came in to England / and took with him four selowes
and came to Pou^tfret to the holy martyr / and did their pilgrimage / and the
good man that was seek came thither al naked / save his preuy clothes. And wha^
they had done / they turned home again in to their own rou^tree / and told of
the miracle where so ever that they came. And also two men have be^ heled there
of the mormale / through help of y^ holy martyr / though that evil be holden
incurable. And when y^ Spensers herd that god did such miracles for this holy
man / they would not believe it in no manner wise / but said openly y^ it was
great heresy such virtue of hy^ to believe. And when sir Hugh Spenser the sone
saw all this doing / anon he sent his messenger from Pou^tfret where as he
dweled to king Edward / that than was at Graven at Scipton / because y^ the
king should undo y^ pilgrimage. And as y^ ry baud messenger went to ward the
king for to do his message / he came by the hill where as the good martyr was
done to death / and in the same place he made his ordure / and wha^ he had done
he rode toward the king / and a strong flyxe came upon hy^ or that he came to
York / and tha^ he shed all his bowels at his foundament. And when sir Hugh
Spenser herd these ty dynges / somdele he was adradde / and thought for to
undo y^ pilgrymage if he might by any manner way. And anon he went to the king
and said y^ they should be in great sclau^dre through out all chry stendom for
the death of Thomas of Lancastre / if that he suffered the people to do^ their
pilgrimage at Pountfret / and so he cou^seyled y^ king y^ he commanded to
close the church doors of Pou^tfret / in y^ which y^ holy martyr was buried /
and thus they did against all frau^chyses of holy church / so y^ four year
after might no pilgrim come to y^ holy body / and because that the monks
suffered men to come and honor y^ holy body of saint Thomas y^ martyr / through
counseyle of sir Hugh Spenser the sone / and through counsel of master
Robert Baldok the false pylled clerk the kings chaunceler / the king
consented that they should be set to their wages: and let make wardeyns over
their own good long time / and through co^mau^ dement of y^ foresaid sir Hugh
Spenser xiiij. gascoyns well armed kept the hill where as the good man saint
Thomas was done to death / so that no pilgrim might come by y^ way. Full well
wend he to have taken Christ's might and his power and the great boos of
miracles that he showed for his martyr saint Thomas through all christendom.
And that same time the king made Robert Baldok the false pylled clerk through
prayer of sir Hugh Spensers sone chau^celer of England. And in y^ same time
was y^ castle of Walyngford holden against y^ king through y^ prisoners that
were wtin the castle for saint Thomas quarrel of Lancastre. Wherefore the
people of y^ country came and took the castle upon y^ prisoners. Wherefore sir
John Goldington knight and sir Edmond of Beche prisoners / and a squire yt was
Roger of Walton were taken and sent to y^ king to Pou^tfret / and there they
were put in prison / and y^ foresaid Roger was sent to york / and there he was
drawn and hanged. And anon after sir Roger Mortimer of wigmore brake out of
the Toure of London in this manner. The foresaid Roger herd yt he should be
drawn and hanged at London on the morrow after saint Laurence day / and on y^
day before he held a fair feast in the toure of London / and there was sir
Stephen Segraue constable of y^ toure and many great men with them / and wha^
they should soupe / y^ foresaid Stephen sent for all y^ officers of y^ toure /
and they came and souped with him / and wha^ they should take their leave of hy^
/ a squire yt hight Stephen yt was full preuy with the foresaid Roger through
his counsel gave them such a dry^ke y^ the lest of them al slept.ij. days
and ij. nyghtes / and in the mean time he escaped away by y^ river of Tamys /
and went over y^ see and held him in France. Wherefore the king was sore
anoyed / and put the same Stephen out of his Co^stablery.

How queen. Isabell went in to France for to treat of peace between her lord
the king of England and the king of France her brother.
THe king went than to London and there through counsel of sir Hugh Spenser
the fader and of his sone and of master Robert Baldok a falls pylled clerk his
chaunceler / let sease than all the queen's lands in to his hands / and also
all the lands y^ were sir Edwardes his sone / and were so put to their wages
against all manner of reason / and that was through y^ falsnes of the Spensers.
And when the king of France yt was queen Isabelles brother herd of this
falsnes / he was sore anoyed against y^ king of England and his false
cou^seylers. Wherefore he sent a lettre to king Edward under his seal / yt he
should come in to France at a certain day for to do his homage and thereto he
somoned him / and else he should lose all Gascoyn. And so it was ordained in
England through the king and his counsel that queen Isabell should go in to
France for to treat of peace between her lord and her brother. And that Olyuer
of yngham should go in to Gascoyn / and have with him.vij. M. men of arms and
more / to be senesshall and wardeyn of Gascoyn. And so it was ordained that
queen Isabell went in to France / and with her went sir Aymer of Valau^ce earl
of Pen broke / that was there murdered suddenly in a preuy syege / but yt was
through gods vengeance / for he was one of the Justices y^ consented to
saint Thomas death of Lancastre / and would never after tepent him of that
wicked deed. And at that time sir Olyuer of yngham went over in to Gascoyn /
and did much harm to the king of France / and than he gate again that king
Edward had lost / and much more thereto.

How king Edward sent sir Edward his sone the eldest in to France.
THe queen Isabell had but a quarter of a year dwelled in France when sir
Edward her eldest sone as^^d leave for to go in to France for to speak with his
mother Isabell y^ queen. And his fader y^ king granted him with a good will and
said to hy^ / go my fair sone in gods blessyng and mine / and think for to
come again as hastily as ye may. And he went over see in to France / and y^
king of France his uncle received hy^ with much honor and said to him. Fair
sone ye be welcome and for because yt your fader came nor to do his homage for
y^ duchy of Guy^nne as his auncesters were wont to do^ I give you y^ lordship
to hold it of me i^ herytege as all manner auncestres did before you wherefore he
was called duke of Guyen.

How the king exiled his queen Isabell and Edward his eldest sone.
When king Edward of England herd tell how y^ king of France had given y^
duchy of Guyen to sir Edward his sone / without consent and will of hy^ and that
his sone had received y^ duchy (...) became wonders wroth: and sent to his sone
by lettre and to his wife also y^ they sh^ld come again in to England in all
haste. And the queen Isabel and sir Edward her sone were wonders sore adrad of
y^ kings menaces and of his wrath / and pryncypally for y^ falsnes of y^
Spensers / both of the fader and also of the sone and at his commandment
they would not come. Wherefore king Edward was full sore anoyed and let make a
cry at London / that if the queen Isabell and Edward his eldest sone came not
in to England yt they should be holden as enemies / both to ye realm and also
to the crown of England. And for yt they would not come in to England / but
both were exiled the mother and her sone. When ye queen herd these tidings /
she was sore adrad to be destroyed through the false coniectynge of the Spensers
/ and went with the knights yt were exiled out of England for saint Thomas
cause of Lancastre / that is to say / sir Roger of wigmore / sir William
Trussell / sir John of Tromwell / and many other good knights / wherefore they
took their counsel and ordained among them for to make a marriage between ye
duke of Guyen ye kings sone of England and ye earls daughter of Henaud / yt
was a noble knight of name and a doughty in his time / and if yt thing might
be brought about / than stood they trowynge with ye help of god and with his help
to recover their heritage in England / whereof they were put out through the false coniectynge of the Spensers.

How king Edward through counseyle of the Spensers sent to the douze pers of
France that they should help that the queen Isabell and her sone sir Edward
were exiled out of France.
When king Edward and the Spensers herd how yt queen Isabell and sir Edward
her sone had alyed them to the earl of Henaud / and to them that were exiled
out of England for cause of Thomas of Lancaster / they were so sorry that they
wist not what to do. Wherefore sir Hugh Spenser ye sone said to sir Hugh his
fader in this manner wise. Fader cursed be ye time and the counsel that ever
ye consented that queen Isabell should go in to France for to treat of accord
between the king of England and her brother the king of France / for that was
your counsel / for at yt time forsothe your wit failed / for I dread me
sore leest through her and her sone we shall be destroyed / but if we take the
better counsel. Now fair syrs understand how meruaylous felony and falshede
the Spensers ymagyned and cast. For pryuely they let fill.v. barels ferrours with
silver / the sum amou^ted to.v. M. pound / and they sent those barels over
see pryuely by an alyen yt was called Arnolde of Spain / that was a broker of
London / that he should go to ye douzepers of France / that they should
procure and speak to the king of France that queen Isabell and her sone
Edward were driven and exiled out of France / and among all other things
that they were brought to the death as pryuely as they might. But almighty god
would not so For wha^ this Arnold was in ye high see he was taken with Selanders
yt met him in the high see / and took him and ladde him to the earl of Henaud
their lord / and much joy was made for that taking. And at the last this
Arnold pryuely stale away fro thens and came to London. And of this taking and
of other things the earl of Henaud said to the queen Isabell Dame make you
merry and be of good chere / for ye be richer than ye wend to have (...)n / and
take these.v. barels full of silver yt were sent to the douzepers of France
for to slay you and your sone Edward / and think hastily for to go in to
England / and take ye with you sir John of Henaud my brother and.v.C. men of
arms / for many of them of France in whom ye have had great trust / do but
scorn you. And almighty god grant you grace your enemies to overcome. Than
sent the queen Isabell through Henaud and Flau^dres for her soudyours / and
ordained her every day for to goo in to England again. And so she had in her
company sir Edmonde of Woodstocke / that was earl of Kent / and was also sir
Edwardes brother of England.

How king Edward let keep ye costs by the sea / and let try all the price men
of arms and footmen through England.
And when king Edward herd tell that queen Isabel and Edward her sone would
come in to England with a great power of alyens / and with them that were
outlawed out of England for their rebellyousnes / he was sore adrad to be put
down / and for to lose his kingdom / wherefore he ordained to keep his castles
in Wales as well as in England with vytayles and their apparayle / and let keep
his rivers and also ye see costs / where of the.v. ports took to keep them and
also the sea. And at the feast of Decollacion of saint John baptist / the
citezyns of London sent to the king to Porchestre an.C. men of arms. And also
he commanded by his lettres ordained / yt every hundred and wepentake of
England / to try as well men of arms as me^ on foot / and that they should
be put in.xx. sum / and in an hundred sum / and commanded yt al those men
were ready when any oyes or cry were made / for to pursue and take ye alyens
that came in to England for to take the land from him and put hy^ out of his
kingdom And more over he let cry through his patent in every feyre and in
every market of England / yt the queen Isabel and sir Edward his eldest sone
and the earl of Kent / yt they were taken and safely kept wout any manner of
harm unto them doing / and al other manner people yt came with them anon
smite of their hedes without any manner of rau^som taking of them. And what man
might bry^ge sir Roger Mortimers heed of wygmore / should have an C. pound of
money for his travail. And ferthermore he ordained by his patent and
co^manuded to make a fire upon every hill / beside ye ryuers and in low
countries for to make hye bekens of tymbre / that if it so were that the alyens
came to the loud by night / that men should kyndle the bekens / that the
country might be warned and come and mete their enemies. And in that time dyed
sir Roger Mortimer his uncle in the ^ou^e of London.

How the queen Isabell and sir Edward duke of Guyenne her so^e came to land at
Herewich / and how they did.
And when queen Isabel and sir Edward her sone duke of Guyenne / sir Edmonde of
Wodstocke earl of Kent / and sir John the ^ri^s (...) of Henaud and their
company d^adde (...) the threteuynges of king Edward (...) of his traitors /
for they trusted a(...) gods grace / and came unto (...) in Suffolk the.
xxii^j. day of September / and in the year of our lord Jesus Christ M.CCC.
xxv^. And the queen and (...) Edward her sone sent lettres to the May^^ and
comynalte of London / r(...)ge them that they would be helpyng in the quarrel
and cause that they had beg(...) that is to say / to destroy the ^ray^ou^s of
the realm. But none answer was sent again / wherefore ye queen and sir Edward
her sone sent another pa(...) (...) under their seals / the (...) of wh^che
lettre here follows in this manner. Isabell by the grace of god queen of
England / lady of Irlonde and cou^cesse of Pountyf / and we Edward the eldest
sone of the king of England duke of Guyenne / earl of Chestre / of Pounty^
and of Moustroyll / to the Mayre and ^o all the comynalce of the cite of London

lettres how we be come in to ^his land in good array and in good manner / for
the honor and profit of holy church and of our right dear lord ye king and

good folk of the foresaid realm are holden to do. And upon yt we pray you
that ye will be helpyng to us in as much as ye may in this quarrel that is for
the common profyce of ye foresaid realm. And we have had to this ^yme none
answer to the foresaid lettres / ne know not your mind in that party.
Wherefore we send to you again and pray and charge you that ye bear you so
against us that we have no cause to grieve you / but that ye be unto us helpyng
by all the ways that ye may / or may know. For wit ye well in certain that we
and all yt be comen with us in to this realm / think not to do any thing /
but yt thing yt shall be to the common profit of all ye realm / and only to
destroy Hugh Spenser our enemy / and enemy to al ye realm / as ye it well
know Wherefore we pray you and charge you in the faith yt ye owe to our lyege
lord the king and to us / and upon all yt ye shall mow forfayte against us /
yt if the said Hugh spe^ser our enemy come wtin your power that ye do hy^
hastily to be taken and safely keep until we have ordained of hy^ our will /
and yt ye leave it not in no manner wise as ye desire honor and profit of us
all and of all the realm. Understand ye well that if ye do this our prayer
and commandment / we will the more be holden un to you. And also ye shall
get you worship and pryfyte if ye send us hastily answer of all your will
again at Baldok / the syxth day of October. Which lettre erly in the dawning
of the day of saint Denis was tacked upon ye new cross in chepe / and many
copyes of ye same lettre were tacked upon windows and doors and upon other
places in the cite of London / yt all men passing by the way might them se and
read. And in the same time king Edward was at London in the toure at his meet /
and a messenger came in to the hall and said that the queen Isabell was come^
to land at Herewich and has brought in her company sir John of Henaude / and
with him men of arms without nombre. And with that word sir Hugh Spenser ye
fader spoke and thus said unto ye king. My most worshypfull lord and king of
England / now make we good chere / for certainly they ben all ours. The king
herd this word comfortable / yet was he full sorrowful and pen syfe in his
heart. And the king had not fully eten / but there came in to ye hall an other
messenger / and said yt the queen Isabell was arrived at Herewich beside
Ipswyche in Suffolk. Sir Hugh spenser the fader spoke to ye messenger and said
Tell soth in good faith my fair friend is she come^ with a great strength. Now
certes sir the soth for to say / she ne has in her company but.vij. hundred
men of arms. And with yt word sir Hugh spenser the fader cried with an high
voice and said. Alas alas we ben al betrayed for certes with so little power she
had never comen to land but if ye folk of this land were unto her
consentyng. And therefore after meet they took their counseyle and went toward
Wales for to arere ye Walshmen against the queen Isabell and Edward her sone /
all for to fight / and so they were in purpose euerychone.

How master Walter Stapylton bishop of Excestre ye was the kings tresourer
was heded at London.
And in the same time king Edward was sore adrad lest yt men of London would
yield them to ye queen Isabel and to her sone Edward. Wherefore he set master
Walter Stapylton his tresourer for to be wardeyn and keeper of ye cite of London
with the Mayre / and so came to the ^ylde hall of London / and asked the keys of
the gates of the Cite / through virtue and strength of his co^myssyon / and
would have had ye keeping of ye cite. And the comuners answered and said that
they would keep the cite to the honor of king Edward and of Isabell the
queen and of the duke ye kings sone without any moo. Than was ye bishop sore
anoyed / and swore oaths yt they all should abye it anon as king Edward were
comen out of Wales. And all the comuners of the Cite anon took the bishop and
ladde him amyddes of the Chepe / and there they smote of his heed / and set his
heed in his right hand. And after they heded two of his squyers that held
with the bishop / and one of them was called Wyllyam of Wayle / that was the
bishops neuewe / and that other was called John of Padington. And also they
took a burgeys of London that was called John Marshall / that was sir Hugh
spensers spy the fader / and smote of his heed also. In the same time yt
bishop had at London a fair toure in making in his close upon the river of
Tamys / yt was without temple bar / and stone failed to make an end thereof /
wherefore he commanded his men to go to the freres Carmes / and there they took
stone to make therwt the toure and much sand and mortar and old robous yt
was left. And for the despyte yt the bishop had done unto holy church: he
and his two squyers were buried in ye sand / as though they had been hou^des /
and there they lay.xj. wekes / till that the queen Isabell sent her lettres to
the comuners and prayed them that they would suffer and grant / that the
bishop might be taken out of ye place and be buried at Excestre in his own
church / and so he was / and his two squyers were buried at saint Cleme^tes
church without temple bar. And it was no wonder though that bishop dyed an
evil death / for he was a covetous man / and had with him no mercy / and evil
cou^seylled the king. And soon after was Arnold of Spain taken / that
assented to have ladde.v. M. pound of silver in.v. barels ferryers unto ye
douze^ers of France / for to help and haste the queen Isabell to her death /
and Edward her sone also. And this Arnold was put to death without the cite.

How king Edward and sir Hugh spenser and the earl of Arundell were taken.
When king Edward had sent master Walter Stap^lton his tresourer to London
/ for to keep the cite unto him against ye queen Isabell his wife / and against
Edward his sone / anon himself took with him sir Hugh Spenser ye seen / and
sir John o^ Arundell / and master Robert Ba^dok his chaunceler a falls pylled
prcest / and took their way toward Brystowe / and there ye king abode a
little time / and made sir Hugh Spenser the fader as Constable and keeper of ye
castle. And ye king and that other spenser went to ship and sailed toward
Wales / and took no leave of ye steward n^ of none of ye kings household and
w(...) ever in to Wales for to arere the W(...) against dame Isabel the queen
and the duke her sone / and the earl of Kent and sir John of Henaud. And they
went and pursued after the^ / and their power increased daily. So at ye last
the king was taken upon an hill in Wales and sir Hugh spenser ye sone on ye
other side of ye same ^yll / and the false pylled clerk master Robert Baldok
there fast besides them / and they were brought again in to England as
almighty god would. And ye king him self was put in safe keeping in ye castle
of Kelynworth / and him kept sir Henry that was saint Thomas brother of
Lancastre. And sir Hugh ye fader came and put him in the queen's grace and sir
Edward her sone duke of Guy(...). But sir Hugh Spenser after the time y^ he
was taken he would neither ete nor drink / for he wist well he should have no
mercy / save only to be deed. And the queen and her cou^ seyle had ordained
that he should have been done to death at London / but he was so feeble for his
much fasting y^ he was nygh deed / and therefore it was ordained y^ he should
have his judgment at Herford And at a place of y^ toure his hode was taken
from his heed / and also from Robert Bal dok yt falls pylled clerk and y^
kings chau^ celer / and me^ set upon their hedes chaplets of sharp nettyls /
and two squyers blewe in their eres with two great bugles horns upon the two
prisouers / that one might here their blowynge more than a mile. And one Symond
of Redyng y^ kings marshall bare before them upon a spear their arms
reuersed: in token that they should be undone for evermore. And on y^ morrow
was sir Hugh Spenser y^ sone dampened to death / and was drawn and hanged and
heded / and his bowelles taken out of his body and brent / and after yt he was
quartred / and his.iiij. quarters were sent to. iiij towns of England / and
his heed sent to London bridge. And this Symond for cause that he despised
queen Isabell he was drawn and hanged on a stage made amyddes y^ foresaid sir
Hughs galowes And y^ same day a little from thens was sir John of Arundell
byheded / because he was one of sir Hugh Spenses counseylers. And anon after
was sir Hugh Spenser y^ fader drawn and hanged and heded at Brystowe / and
after hanged again by the arms with two strong ropes: and the fourth day after
he was hewn all to pe ces / and hou^des ete him. And because the king had
given him y^ erledom of wyn chestre his heed was put upon a spear and sent
thither. And the false Baldok was sent to London / and there he dyed in prison
among thieves / for men did hy^ no more reverence than they would do to a dog.
And so dyed y^ traitors of England blissed be god. And it was no wonder / for
through their counsel y^ good earl Tho mas of Lancaster was done to death /
and all that held with Thomas of Lancastre through the traitors were undone /
and all their heirs disheryted.

How king Edward was put down and his dignite taken from him.
ANd anon after as all this was done / queen Isabell and Edward her sone duke
of Guyenne / and all the great lords of England at one assent sent to king
Edward to y^ castle of Kenilworth where as he was in keeping under the ward
of sir John Hachim that was y^ bysihop of Ely / and of sir John of Percy a
baron / for because that he should ordeyn his parlyament at a certain place in
England / for to redress and amend the estate of the realm. And king Edward
them answered and said. Lords said he ye se full well how it is / lo have here
my seal / and I give you all my power for to ordeyne a parlyament where that
ye will. And than they took their leave of him and came again to y^ barons of
England. And when they had the kings patent of this thing / they showed it
to the lords. And than was ordained that the parliament should be at
westmynster at the vtas of saint Hylary. And all the great lords of England
let ordeyne for them there against that time that the parlyament should be. At
which day that y^ parlyament was / the king would not come there for no manner
thing as he had set himself and assygned. And nevertheless the barons sent
unto him one time and other. And he swore by gods soul that he would not
come there one foot. Wherefore it was ordained by all the great Lords of
England that he should no longer be king / but be depo sed / and said they
would crown Edward his sone y^ elder yt was duke of Guyenne And sent tidings
unto the king there as he was in ward under sir John earl of Garen / and sir
John of Bothun yt was bishop of Ely / and sir Henry Percy a baron / and sir
Willyam Trussell a knight y^ was with y^ earl Thomas of Lancastre for to yield
up their homages unto him for all them of England. And sir Wyllyam Trussell
said these words. Sir Edward / because that ye have betrayed your people of
England / and have undone many great lords or England without any cause / ye
shall be deposed / and now ye be withstand thanked be god. And also because
that ye would not come to y^ parliament as ye ordained at Westmynster as in your
own lettre patent is contained / for to treat with your lyege men as a king
should. And therefore through all y^ comyns assent and of all the lords of
England I tell unto you these words. Ye shall understand sir that the barons
of England at one assent will that ye be no more king of England / but utterly
have put you out of your ryalte for evermore. And the bishop of Ely than said
to the king. Sir Edward here I yield up feaute and homage for all y^
archebisshops and bishops of England and for all y^ clergy. Than said sir John
earl of Garen. Sir Edward I yield up here unto you feau te and homage for me
and for all y^ earls of England. And sir Henry Percy gave up also there his
homage for him and for all y^ barons of England. And than said sir William
Trussell. I yield up now unto you sir mine homage for me and for all the
knights of England / and for all them y^ hold by sergeau^try or by any other
manner thing of you / so y^ from this day af terward ye shall not be claymed
king / nor for king be holden. But from this time afterward ye shall be
holden for a singular man of all y^ people. And so they went thens to London /
where y^ lords of England abode them / and sir Edward abode in prison i good
keeping. And this was on the day of y^ co^uersyon of saint Paul / in the.xx.
year of his regne.

Of the prophery of Merlyn declared of king Edward the sone of king Edward
the first.
OF this king Edward prophesied Merlin and said y^ there should come a got out
of Carre yt should have horns of silver / and a berde as white as snow / and a
drop should come out of his nosethrylles yt should betoken much harm honger
and death of people / and greece loss of his land. And that in y^ beginning
of his regne should be hau^ted much lechery. And he said sothe / alas the time
for king Edward yt was king Edwardes sone was borne at Carnaruan in Wales For
sothe he had horns of silver and a berd as white as snow when he was made
pry^ce of Wales / to much he gave him to riot and to folly. And sothe said
Merlyn in his prophecy / that there should come out of his nose a drop. For in
his time was great honger among y^ poor people / and strong death among y^
ty the that dyed in strange land with sorrow and in war in Scotlond. And
afterward he lost Scotlonde and Gascoyn and much le chery in his days was
hau^ced. Also Merlyn said yt this got should seek the flower of life and of
death. And he said so the for he spoused Isabell y^ kings sister of France.
And in this time Merlyn said that there should be made brydges of folk upon
dyches of the sea. And y^ was well seen at Bannockesbourne in Scotlonde wha^ he
was disco^tyted there of y^ Scotces. And Merlyn told also that stones should
fall from castles / and many towns should be made plain. And he said sothe For
when king Edward was discomfyted in Scotlonde and came than southwarde / the
Scotts besyeged castles and did much harm / and brent towns unto the hard
earth. And afterward Merlyn told that an egle should come out of Cornewayle
that should have feathers of gold / that of pride should have no pere / and he
should despise lords of blood / and after he should dye through a bear at
Gauersyche / and that prophecy was full well known and found soche. For by
the egle is understand sir Pyers Ganaston / that than was earl of Cornewayle /
which was a wonders proud man / and despised the barons of England / but
afterward he was heded at Gauersyche through ye earl of Lancastre and the earl
of warwyk. And Merlyn told that in this time it should seem that the bear
should brenne and that battle should be upon an arm of the sea in a field
arrayed like a shield where should dye many white hedes / and he said sothe. For
by the brennynge of ye bear is betokened great dread through cuttynge of
swerdes at that battle of Myton / for there came ye Scotts in manner of a
shield in a wynge / and slew men of religyon / priests and seculers / where
fore the Scotts called that battle in despyte of Englysshmen the white
battle. And after Merlin said that the foresaid Bear should do the Got much
harm / and yt should be upon ye south west / and also upon his blood. And said
also yt the Got should lose much dele of his land / till the time that shame
should him overcome / and than he should clothe him in a lions skin / and
should win again that he had lost / and more through people that should come
out of the north west / yt should make him to be fered and him avenge upon his
enemies through counseyle of two owls / that first should be in peril to be
undone. And those two owls should go over see in to a strange land / and
there dwell a certain time / and after should return again in to England / and
should do much harm to many one / and that they should counsel ye Got to
meue war against the foresaid bear / and the got and the owls should come
to an arm of ye see at Burton upon Trent / and should go over / and that for
dread the bear should flee with a swan in his company to Bury toward ye north
through an unkind outpulter / and that ye swan tha^ should be slain with sorrow
and the bear should be slain full nigh his own nest / yt should stand upon
Pou^tfret upon whom the son should shede his bemes / and many folk should
seek him for his virtue. And he said sothe. for ye good earl Thomas of
Lancaster was borne in the north west / and cosyn to ye king and his uncles
sone / and by law he made ye king lose much lord yt he had purchased will
fully till at ye last the king took thereof shame / and himself filled with
cruelte. And after gate again yt he had lost and much more / through help of
folk coming out of ye northwest / by whom he was drad / and avenged hy^ on his
barons through counsel of ye two Spe^sers yt before were out lawed for their
wickedness / and after came again out of France / and so much these Spensers
cou^seyled ye king yt he should war upon Thomas of Lancastre / so yt the king
and the Spensers and the earl of Arundell and their power met with Thomas of
Lancastre at Burton upon Trent / and him there discomfyted / and sir Vmfrey
earl of Herford was in his company. And after fled the foresaid Thomas and
Vmfrey with their company to Burbrygge / metynge with sir Andrewe of Herkela /
that is called ye unkind outpulter / and also sir Symond Ward earl of York
they came and met with Thomas of La^tastre with an huge company / and them there
disco^syted / and in y^ disco^siture y^ crle of Herford was slain upon the
bridge cowardly with a spear in the fou^dement / and the earl Thomas was taken
and ladde to Pou^tfret / and than was he heded beside his own castle. But
afterward many him sought for miracles y^ god did for him. And in y^ time
Merlyn said / for sorrow and harm should dye a people of his land / wherefore
many lands should be upon him the more bolder And he said sothe / for because
of his barons that were put to death for saint Thomas quarrel of Lancastre /
people of many lands became the bolder for to meue war upon their king / for
their blood was turned to many nacyons. And afterward Merlyn told and said yt
the foresaid owls should do much harm unto the flower of life and death / and
they should bring her to much disease / so that she should go over see in to
France for to make peace to y^ flower delyce / and there should abide till on a
time her sede should come and seek her / and there they should abide both till
y^ time that they should clothe them with grace / and those two owls she
should seek and put them to pyteous death. And that prophecy was well known /
and was full sothe. For sir Hugh Spenser the fader and sir Hugh the sone did
much sorrow and persecucyon unto the queen Isabell through their procureme^t
to her lord y^ king. So they ordained among them y^ she was put unto her wages
/ y^ is to say.xx. shillynges in y^ day / where fore the king of France her
brother was sore alwyed / and sent in to England by his lettres unto king
Edward y^ he should come unto his parlyament to Paris in France. But king
Edward was sore adradde to come there / for he wend to have be arested till
that he had made amends for the trespace that sir Hugh Spenser the fader and
the sone had done / and for y^ harm y^ they had done to the queen Isabell his
sister. Wherefore through her ordinance and consent of y^ Spensers y^ queen
Isabell went over see in to France for to make accord between king Edward and
the king of France her brother. And there dwelled she in France till Edward
her eldest sone came for to seek her and so they dwelled there both till that
alyau^ce was made between them and the gentyl earl of Henaud / yt if they with
their virtue might destroy and overcome y^ ves nym and the falsnes of the
Spensers that sir Edward should spouse dame Philip the worshypfull lady and the
earls daughter of Henaud. Wherefore the queen Isabell and Edward her sone / and
sir Edmonde of wodstocke the kings brother of England / and sir John of Henaud
/ and sir Rogrt Mortimer of Wygmore / and sir Thomas Rocelyn / and sir John of
Cromwell / and sir Willyam Trussell / and many other of the alyaunce of the
gentle earl Thomas of Lancastre yt were exiled out of England for his quarrel
/ and were disherued of their lands / ordained them a great power and arrived
at Herewich in Suffolk. And soon after they pursued the Spensers till yt they
were taken and put to pytcous death / as before is said / and their company also
/ for y^ great falsnes that they did to king Edward and to his people. And
Merlyn said also more y^ the got should be put to great disrase and great
anguysshe and in great soro wehe should led his life. And he said sothe / for
after y^ time that king Edward was taken he was put in to ward till that y^
Spensers were put to death / and also because he would not come to his
parlyame^t at London as he had ordeyued and assygned himself unto his haronage
/ and also would not govern and rule his people nor his realm as a king
should do. Wherefore some of y^ barons of England came and yielded up their
homages unto him for them and all the other of the realm on the day of y^
conuersyon of saint Paul / in y^ year of his regne.xx. And they put him out of
his royalte for evermore / and ever he lived afterward in much sorrow and
anguysshe.

LVdouicus was emperor after Henry.iiij. year. This Lodewik was duke of Bauare
/ and he despised the crownacyon of y^ pope / wherefore y^ pope deposed him /
and much labor and many peryls he had after / and he troubled greatly the
unite of holy church. Than was chosen against him Frederyke duke of Austryche.
And he overcame the duke / and abode a rebellyon to his end / and in great
peril to his soul. And at the last Karolus was chosen against him / the
which prevailed / and suddenly Lodewyk fell down of his horse and decessed.
John Maundeuyll a doctor of physyk and a knight was borne in England about
this time. And he made a meruaylous pilgrimage / for he went almoost about all
y^ world / and he wrote his deeds in three languages / and decessed and was
buried at saint Albons. Benedictus the.xxij. was pope after John.vij. year and
more. This man was a monk / and in all his youth he was of good co^uersacyon /
and a doctor of divinity. And wha^ he was made pope he reformed y^ order of
saint Benet in that thing y^ was necessary. And he was an hard man to grant
benefyces / leest he had granted it to an uncunning man. He made a decretall
y^ which began Benedictus deus in donis suis. And he was very cruel i^ his
faith And for y^ of some men was little loved. He was so stout a man that
almoost he would not know his own cosyns.

Anno dn^i. M.CCC.xxvij.
Of king Edward the third after the conquest.

AFter this king Edward of Carnaruan reigned sir Edward of Wyndsore his sone /
y^ which was crowned king and anointed at Westmynster / through counsel and
consent of all y^ great lords of y^ realm y^ sunday on Candelmasse even / in
y^ year of grace. M.CCC.xxvj. that was of age at y^ time but.xv. year. And for
because y^ his fader was inward in the castle of Kenilworth and also was put
down of his royalte / y^ realm of England was without king from y^ feast of
saint Katherin in the year above said unto the feast of Candelmasse. And than
were all manner plees of y^ kings benche astent. And than was commanded to all
y^ sheryues of England through writ to warn y^ parties to defendau^tes
through somnynge again. And also ferthermore y^ al prisoners y^ were in the
ky^ges gayles y^ were attached through sheryues / should be let go quyte. King
Edward after his crownacyon at the prayer and besechynge of his lyege men of
the realm granted the^ a chartre of steadfast peace to all them y^ would ask
it. And sir John of Henaud and his company took their leave of the king and of
y^ lords of the realm / and turned home to their own country again / and each
of them had full rich gifts / every man as he was of value and of estate. And
than was England in rest and peace / and great love between the king and his
lords. And comynly Englysshmen said among them y^ the devil was deed But the
innumerable tresour of y^ king his fader / and the tresour of the Spensers
both of the fader and of y^ sone / and of y^ earl of Arundell / and of master
Robert Baldoc y^ was y^ kings chau^celer was departed after y^ queen Isabelles
ordinance and sir Roger Mortimers of wygmore / so that the king had no thing
thereof / but at her will and her delyuerau^ce / nor of their lands / as
afterward ye shall here.

How king Edward went to Stanhope for to mete the Scotts.
ANd yet in y^ same time was the king in the castle of Kenilworth under y^
keeping of sir Henry that was earl Thomas brother of Lancaster y^ than was earl
of Leycestre / and the king granted him y^ erledom of Lancastre / that y^ king
his fader had seized i^ to his hands and put out Thomas of Lancastre his
brother. And so was he earl of Lancastre and of Leycestre / and also steward of
England as his brother was in his time. But sir Edward that was king Edwardes
fader made sorrow without end / for because he might not speak with his wife nor
with his son / wherefore he was i^ much mischefe For though it were so y^ he
was lad and ruled by falls counsel / yet was he king Edwardes sone called
Edward with the long shankes / and came out of y^ worthiest blood of all y^
world / and they to whom he was wont to give great gifts and large / were
most preuy with the king his sone / and they were his enemies both by night and
by day y^ procured to make debate and contake between him and his sone and
Isabel his wife. But y^ friar prechers were to him good friends evermore / and
cast both by night and by day how they might bring him out of prison. And
among their company y^ the freres had pryuely brought there was a friar y^
called Dunhened / and he had ordained and gadred a great company of folk to
keep at y^ need / but y^ friar was taken and put in y^ castle of Pou^fret /
and there he dyed in prison / and sir Henry earl of Lancastre that had y^
kings fader in keeping through commandment of the king delivered Edward y^
kings fader by endenture to sir Thomas of Berkeley / and so sir John
Mautreuers and they led him from y^ castle of Kenilworth to y^ castle of
Berkley / and kept hy^ there safely And at cester next after his crownacyon the
king ordained an huge host for to fight against y^ Scotts. And sir John the
earls brother of Henaud came from beyond y^ see for to help king Edward / and
brought with him. vij.C. men of arms / and arrived at Dover / and they had leave
for to go forth till they came to york where as the king them abode / and y^
Scotts came thither to y^ king for to make peace and accord / but the
accordement lasted not between them but a little time. And at y^ time the
Englysshmen were clothed all in cotes and hodes peynted with (...) and with
flowers full semely with long berdes / and therefore the Scotts made a byll that
was fastened upon the church doors of saint Peter's toward stengace / and thus
said y^ scripture in despyte of Englysshemen. Long berdes bertles / peynted
hodes wytles / gaye cotes graceles / makes England thryftles.

ON Trinite sunday next after began the co^take in the cite of York between
the Englysshmen and the Henaudes / and in that debate were slain of the
erledom of Nycholl and murdered. (...). men / and after they were buried under a
stone in saint Clementes church in (...)gate. And because y^ the Henaudes came
to help the king / their peace was cried upon pain of life and lymme and in y^
other half it was found by an enquest of y^ cite that the Englysshmen began
y^ debate.

How y^ Englysshmen stopped y^ Scotts in y^ park of Stanhope / and how they
returned again into Scotlonde.
ANd at y^ time y^ Scotts had assembled all their power and came in to
England and slew and robbed all y^ they might take / and also burnt and
destroyed all the north country throughout till y^ they came to the park of
Stanhope in wyre dale / and there y^ Scotts held them in a busshme^t. But
when y^ king had herd through certain spies where y^ scotts were / anon
right with his host besyeged them within y^ foresaid park / so that y^ Scotts
wist not where to go out / but only to their harms / and they abode in y^
park.xv. days / and vytayles failed them on every side / so y^ they were
greatly appayred of their bodies. And sith y^ Brute came first in to Brytayn to
this time there was never seen so fair an host what of Englysshmen and of
alyens and of men on foot / the which ordained them for to fight with the
Scotts / through eggyng of sir Henry of Lancaster and of sir John of Henaud y^
would have gone over the water of with for to have fought with the Scotts. But
sir Roger Mortymer consented not thereto / for he had pryuely taken mede of the
Scotts to help them that they might go in to their country. And this Mortimer
cou^seyled so much Thomas of Brotherton y^ earl Marshall that was king
Edwardes uncle that y^ foresaid Thomas should not assemble at that time unto y^
Scotts / and he assented but he wist not the doing between the Scotts and
the foresaid Mortimer. And because y^ he was Marshall of England and to him
perteyned ever y^ vau^twarde / he sent hastily to y^ earl of Lancastre and to
sir John of Henaud that they should not fight with the Scotts / in preiudyce
and harmyng of him and his fee / and if they did that they should stand to
their own peril. And y^ foresaid earl Marshall was al arrayed with his battle
at y^ reredoos of the earl of Lancaster for to have fought with him and with his
folk / if he had meued for to fight with the Scotts. And in this manner he was
deceived / and wist nothing of the treason. And thus was the king principally
deceived. And when it was night Mortymer that had the watch for to keep of the
host y^ night / dystroubled y^ watch that nothing might be done. And in y^
mean while y^ Scotts stole by night toward their own country as fast as
they might. And so was the king falsely betrayed / that wend y^ all the
traitors of his land had been brought to an end as it was said before Now
here ye lords how traytoursly y^ king Edward was deceived / and how
meruaylously and boldly the Scotts did of war. For James Douglas with two
hundred men of arms rode throughout all the host of king Edward / the same
night y^ Scotts escaped toward their own country as is above said till y^
they came to y^ kings pauylyon / and slew there many men i^ their beds /
and cried naward naward / and an other time a douglas a douglas. Wherefore y^
king that was in his pauilyon and much other folk were wonders sore afraid.
But blissed be god y^ king was not taken / and in great peril was than y^
realm of England. And y^ night the moon shone full clear and bright. And for
all the kings men the Scotts escaped harmeles. And on the morrow when the
king wist that the Scotts were escaped in to their own country / he was
wonders sorry / and full hertely wept with his young eyes / and yet wist he not
who had done him y^ treason / but that falls treason was full well known a good
while after as the story tells. Than king Edward came again to york full
sorrowful / and his host departed / and every man went in to his own country
with full heavy chere and mourning semblaunt / and the Henaudes took their leave
and went in to their own country / and the king for their travail hugely
rewarded them. And for because of that vyage the king had dyspended much of
his tresour and wasted. And in that time were seen two mones in y^ fyrmament /
that one was clear and that other was derke / as men might se through y^
world. And a great debate was y^ same time against pope John the.xxij. after
saint Peter / and the emperor of Almayn tho made him emperor against y^ popes
will / y^ tho held his see at Auinyon Wherefore y^ emperor made his cry at
Rome and ordained an other pope y^ hight Nicholas y^ was a friar Minour / and
that was against the right of holy church / wherefore he was cursed / and the
power of that other pope soon was laid. And because y^ such meruayles were
seen: men said y^ the world was nygh at an end.

Of the death of king Edward of Carnaruan.
ANd now go we again to sir Edward of Carnaruan y^ was king Edwardes fader
sometime king of England / and was put down of his dignite. Alas for his
tribulacion and sorrow y^ him befell through falls counsel y^ he loved and
trusted upon to much / that afterward were destroyed through their falsnesse
as god would. And this Edward of Carnaruan was in y^ castle of Berkeley / under
y^ keeping of sir Moryce of Berkeley and sir John of Mautreuers / and to them he
made his co^playnt of his sorrow and of his disease. And often times asked of
his wardeyns what he had trespaced against dame Isabell his wife and sir
Edward his sone y^ was made new king that they would not visyte him. And tha^
answered one of his wardeyns and said. My worthy lord dysplease you not y^ I
shall tell you / the cause is / for it is done them to understand / y^ if my
lady your wife come any thing nigh you / that ye would her strangle and slay /
and also that ye would do to my lord your sone y^ same. Than answered he with
a simple chere Alas alas am not I in prison / and all at your own will / now
god it wot I never thought it / and now I would y^ I were deed / so would to
god y^ I were / for than were all my sorrow passed. It was not long after y^
the king through counsel of Roger Mortymer granted y^ ward and keeping of
sir Edward his fader to sir Thomas Toiourney / and to y^ foresaid sir John
Mautreuers through the kings lettre / and put out holly y^ foresaid sir Moryce
of the ward of the king. And they took and lad the king to y^ castle of Corf*
y^ which castle y^ king hated as any death. And they kept him there till it
came un to saint Mathewes day in September in the year of grace. M.CCC.xxvii.
that the foresaid sir Roger Mortimer sent y^ manner of y^ death / how and in what
wise he should be put to death. And anon as y^ foresaid Thomas and John had seen
y^ (...) and commandment / they made king Edward of Carnaruan good chere
and good solace as they might at y^ souper / and no thing the king wist of y^
treason. And when time was for to go to bed the king went unto his bed
and lay and slepte fast. And as the king lay and slepte the traytoures false
for sworn against their homage and feaute came pryuely in to y^ kings chamber
/ and their company with them / and laid an huge table upon his womb / and
with men pressed and held fast down the four corners of y^ table on his body
/ wherewith y^ good man awoke and was wonders sore adrad to be deed there and
slain / and turned his body tho up so down. Than took y^ falls traitors and
tyrau^tes an horn and put it in to his foundement as deep as they might / and
took a spyt of coper bre^nynge / and put it through the horn in to his body /
and often times therewith thyrled his bowelles / and so they slew their lord
that nothing was perceived / and was buried at Glocestre.

How king Edward spoused Philip the earls daughter of Henaud at York.
ANd after Chrystmasse than next following sir John of Henaud brought with him
Philip his broders daughter yt was earl of Henaud his nece in to England / and
king Edward spoused her at York with much honor. And sir John of Bothum
bishop of Ely and sir William of Melton archebysshop of york sange the mass
ye sunday on ye even of the conversion of saint Paul / in ye year of grace.
M.CCC.xxvij. But because that the king was young and tender of age when he was
crowned / full many wrongs were done while yt his fader lived because yt he
byleued the cou^seylers that were falls about him to do otherwise than reason
would / wherefore great harm was done to ye realm and to ye king / and all men
directed it to ye kings deed / and it was not so / almighty god it knows.
Wherefore it was ordained at ye kings crownyng yt the king for his tender age
should be governed by.xij. of the gretest lords of England / without whom no
thing should be done / that is to say / the archebysshop of Canterbury / the
archebisshop of york / the bishop of wynchestre / and the bishop of Herford
/ the earl of Lancastre / the earl Marshall / and ye earl of Kent yt were ye
kings uncles / and the earl of Garen / sir Thomas wake / sir Henry Percy / sir
Olyuer of yngham / and John of Roos barons. All these were sworn truly for to
counsel ye king / and they should answer every year in ye parlyame^t of yt
that should be done in the time of their gouernall. But ye ordinance was soon
undone / and that was much harm to all England. For the king and all the
lords ye should govern him were governed and ruled after the ky^ges mother dame
Isabell / and by sir Roger Mortimer. And as they would all thing was done /
both among hye and low. And they took unto them castles / towns / lands /
and rentes / in great harm and loss to the crown / and of the kings estate
out of mesure.

How the peace was made between ye Englisshmen and the Scotts / and also of
iustyfyenge of Troylebaston.
BYnge Edward at whytsontyde in the second year of his regne / through the
counsel of his mother and sir Roger Mortimer ordained a parlyame^t at
Northamton. And at that parlyame^t the king through their counsel / and none
other of the land within age granted to be accorded with the Scotts in this
manner. That all the feautees and homages that the Scotts should do unto the
crown of England forgave them for ever more by his chartre ensealed. And
forthermore an endenture was made of the Scotts unto king Edward that was
king Henryes sone / which endenture they called ragman / in the which were
contained al ye homages and feautees First of the king of Scotlonde and of all
the prelates / earls and barons of ye realm of Scotlonde / with their seals set
thereon / and other chartres and remembraunces yt king Edward and his barons
had of their right in ye foresaid realm of Scotlond / it was forgyuen them
against holy church. And also with ye black cross of Scotlonde / the which
ye good king Edward conquered in Scotlonde / and brought it out of the abbey
of Scone / yt is a full precious relyke. And also forthermore he relesed and
forgave all the lands that the barons of England had in Scotlonde by old
conquest. And this peace for to be hold and last the Scotts were bound unto
the king in.xxx. M. pound of silver to be paid within three year / that is
every year.x. M. pound by even porcyons. And forthermore above all this they
spoke between the parties above said / that Dauyd Dritonautier that was king
Robert the Brus sone ye falls tyrant and falls forsworn against his oath yt
arose against his lyege lord the noble and good king Edward / and falsely made
him king of Scotlo^de / that was of ye age of.v. year. And so through this
cursed counseyle David spoused at Barwyk dame Ione of the toure / that was
king Edwardes sister / as ye gest tells upon Mary Magdaleyns day / in ye
year of grace. M.CCC. and.xxviij. to great harm and empayrynge of all the
kings blood / whereof that gentle lady came / alas ye time / for wonders much
was that fair damoysell desparaged sith that she was married against all the
comyns assent of England. And fro the time that Brute had conquered Albion /
and named the land after his own name Brytayn / that now is called England /
after the name of Engyst / and so the realm of Scotlonde was holden of the
realm of England / and of the crown by feaute and homage. For Brute
conquered that land / and gave it to Albanack that was his second sone / and
he called that land Albayn after his own name / so that the heirs that came
after him should hold of Brute and of his heirs / that is to say of ye
kings of Brytayne by feaute and homage. And from that time unto this time of
king Edward / the realm of Scotlonde was holden of the realm of England by
feaute and service as above is said in ye Chronicles of England and of
Scotlonde / and bears wytnes more plenarly. And cursed be the time that this
parliament was holden at Northamton. For there through falls counsel the king
was there falsely dysheryted / and yet he was within age. And yet when that king
Edward was put out of his royalte of England / yet men put not him out of ye
feautees and service of Scotlonde / ne of the frau^chyses dysheryted him for
evermore. And nevertheless the great lords of England were against to confyrme
ye peace and the trewse above said / save only queen Isabell yt was the kings
mother Edward / and the bishop of Ely / and the lord Montmer. But reason and
law would not yt a fynall peace should be made between them without the common
assent of England.

Of the debate yt was between queen Isabell and sir Henry earl of Lancaster and
of Leycestre / and of the riding of Bedford.
When ye foresaid David had spoused dame Ione of the toure in the town of
Barwik (as before is said) the Scotts in despyte of the Englysshmen called
dame Ione ye countess make peace for the cowardly peace that was ordained. But
the kings person bare all the wit and blame with wrong of the making of the
accord. And all was done through the queen and Roger M^rtymer. And it was not
long after that ye queen Isabell ne took in to her hands all the lordshyp of
Pountfret almoost all ye lands that were of any value that apperteyned to the
crown of England. So yt the king had not for to dyspende but of his uses and
of his excheker. For the queen Isabell and Mortimer had a gre^e meyny of their
retynue that followed evermore the kings court / and went and took ye kings
pryces for her penny worthes at good chepe. Wherefore the country yt they came in
/ were full sore adrad and almoost destroyed of them. Tha^ began ye cominalte
of England for to have envy to Isabell the queen that so much loved her
before when she came again fro France for to pursue the false traitors ye
Spensers. And in that same time ye false traitor Robert of Holand that
be^rayed his lord sir Thomas of Lancastre / was than delivered out of prison /
and was wonders preuy with ye queen Isabell and also with Roger Mortimer. But
that auayled hy^ but little / for he was taken at Myghelmasse next following as
he rode toward the queen Isabell to London / and sir Thomas wyther smote of his
heed besides the town of saint Albons. And this sir Thomas dwelled with sir
Henry earl of Lancastre / and he put him aside for dread of the queen / for she
loved him wonders much / and prayed unto ye king for him yt the same Thomas
might be exiled out of England. And ye noble earl sir Henry of Lancastre had
oftentimes herd the common damour of ye Englysshmen / of yt disease that was
done in England / and also for diverse wrongs yt were done to ye common people.
Of the which the king bare the blame with wrong. For he was young and tender of
age. And thought as a good man for to do away and slake the sclaundre of ye
kings person / if that he might in any manner wise / so as ye king was thereof
nothing gylty / wherefore he was in peril of his life. And so he assembled all
his retenaunces and went and spoke with them of ye kings honor / and also for
to amend his estate. And sir Thomas Brotherton earl Marshall / and sir Edmond
of wodstok yt were the kings uncles / and also men of London made their oath
for to maynteyn him in that same quarrel. And their cause was this / that the
king should hold his house and his meyny as a king ought to do / and have all
his ryalte / and that ye queen Isabell should deliver out of her hands in to ye
kings hands all manner lordshyppes / rentes / towns and castles yt
apperteyned unto ye crown of England as other queen's did before her / and
meddle with none other thing. And also that sir Roger Mortimer should abide and
dwell upon his own lands / for ye which lands he had helped to disheryte
much people / in so much that ye common people were destroyed through
wrongful taking. And also to inquire how and by whom the king was betrayed
and falsely deceived at Stan hope / and through whose counsel that the Scotts
went away by night from the king. And also how and through whose counsel ye
ordinance that was made at the kings crownacyon was put down / that is for
to say / that the king for amendment and helpyng of the realm / and in
honor of him should be governed and ruled by.xij. of the gretest and wisest
lords of the realm / and without them should nothing be granted ne done (as
before is said) the which couenauntes were malycyously put down from the
king / wherefore many harms shames and reproues have fallen to the king and
his realm. And that is to understand for as much as Edward sometime king of
England was ordained by assent of the comynalte in plain parlyament for to be
under the ward and governance of Henry earl of Lancastre his cosyn for
salvation of his body / he was taken out of ye castle of Ken^^worth where he
was in ward / and through color of queen Isabell and of Mortimer without
consent of any parliament they took and lad hy^ where as never after none of
his ^ynrede might speak with hy^ / and after tray toursly murdered him / for whose
death arose a sclaundre through all christendom when it was done. And also ye
tresour yt sir Edward of Carnaruan left in many places (...) england and in
wales was wasted and borne away without ye will of king Edward his sone / in
destruction of him and all his folk. Also through whose counsel that the
king gave up ye kingdom of Scotlonde / for ye which realm the kings
auncesters had full sore trauayled / and so did many a noble man for their
right / and was delivered to David that was Robert ye Brus sone al ye right
that no right had to ye realm / as all the world it wist. And also by whom ye
charters and remembrau^ces yt they had of the right of Scotlo^de were taken out
of the tresoury and taken to the Scotts the kings enemies / to the
dysherytyng of him and his successors / and to great harm of his lyeges / and
great reprefe to all Englysshmen for evermore. Also wherefore ^ame Ione of ye
toure king Edwardes sister was disparaged and married to David yt was Robert ye
Brus sone / yt was a traitor and enemy to England / and through whose
counsel she was taken in to our enemies hands out of England. And in the
mean while the good earl Henry of Lancastre and his company took counsel how
these points above said might be amended to ye worship of ye king and to his
profit / and to ye profit also of his lyeges. And the queen Isabell through
coniectynge and subtylte and also of Mortymer let ordeyn a parlyament at
Salysbury. And at that parlyame^t was Mortimer made earl of March against all
the barons will of England in preiudyce of ye king and his crown. And sir
John of Eltham ye kings brother was gyrt with a sword of Cornewayle / and tho
was called earl of Cornewayl. And evermore queen Isabell procured so much
anenst her sone the king / yt she had ye ward of ye foresaid sir Edward and of
his lands. And at that parlyame^t ye earl of Lancastre would not come / but
ordained his power against queen Isabell and Mortymer / and men of London
ordained them with.v.C. men of arms. When queen Isabell wist of the doing /
she swore by god and by his names full angerly / that in an evil time he
thought upon those points. Than sent the queen Isabell and Mort^mer after
their retynue / and after ye kings retynue so that they had ordained among
them an huge host. And they so cou^seyled the king / that upon a night they
rode. xxiij mile toward Bedford / where as ye earl of Lancastre was with his
company and thought to have destroyed him / and that night she rode beside the
king her sone as a knight armed for dread of death. And it was done the king to
understand ye the earl Henry of Lancaster and his company would have destroyed
the king and his counsel for evermore / wherefore ye king was somdele toward
him heavy and anoyed. When ye earl Marshall and the earl of Kent the kings
brother herd of these tidings / they ^ode so in message between them / that
the king granted him his peace to the earl Henry of Lancastre for a certain
raunsom of. x^. M. pound. But that was never paid after ward. And these were
ye lords ye held with sir Henry of Lancastre / sir Henry Beamont / sir Fouk
fitz war^^ sir Thomas Rocelyn / sir Willyam Trussell syrr Thomas wyther / and
about an ^ondred knights moo than were to him co^sen ted / and all those were
ex^led through counsel of queen Isabell and of Mor^^mer for Mortymer waited
for to have their lo^des if yt he might through any manner coniecting / for he
was to co(...)us and had to much will / and that was great py^e.

How king Edward went over the sea for to do his homage to the king of
France for the duchy of Guyen.
IT was not long after ye the king of France through counsel of his
Douzepers sent unto king Edward of England that he should come to Paris and
do his homage (as reason it would) for y^ duchy of Guyen / and so through
counsel of y^ lords of England king Edward went over y^ see / and at y^
Ascencyon tide he came to Paris the third year of his regne for to do his
homage unto the king of France. And the king received his homage / and made of
him much joy and worship. But wha^ king Edward had done his homage / hastily
he was sent for in to England through y^ queen Isabell his mother / and anon
hastily he came again in to England upon whytsonday without taking leave of y^
king of France / wherefore he was wonders wroth.

How sir Roger Mortimer bare him proudly and wonders hye.
ANd now shall ye here of sir Roger Mortimer of wygmore that desired and
coueyted to be at an hye estate so that y^ king granted him to be called earl
of March / throughout all his lordshyp. And he became so proud and so hauteyn
y^ he would lose and forsake the name y^ his elders had ever before / and for y^
cause he let call him earl of March / and none of the comyns of England durst
call hy^ by other name. For he was called so by the kings cry / y^ men should
call him earl of March. And Mortimer bare hy^ so hauteyne and so proud / that
wonder it was for to wit / and also dysguysed him with wonders rich clothes
out of all manner of reason / both of shapynge and of werynge. Whereof y^
Englysshmen had great wonder / how and in what manner he might contryue or find
such manner pride / and they said among them comynly that his pride should not
long endure. And y^ same time sir Geffrey Mortimer that was Mortimers sone let
call him king of folly / and so it befell afterward in deed. For he was so full
of pride and of wretchedness / that he held a round table in Wales to all men
that came thither / and cou^terfeyted the doing and the manner of king Arthurs
table / but openly he failed. For the noble king Arthur was the most noble
lord of renome y^ was in all the world in his time / and yet came never none
such after / for all y^ noble knights in all chrystendom of deeds of arms
assayed dwelling with king Arthur / and held him for their lord and souerayn.
And that was well seen / for he conquered in battle a Romayn that was called
Froll / and gate of him the realm of France / and slew him with his own
hands. And also he faught with a gyaunt y^ was called Dinabus and slew him /
y^ had rauysshed fair Eleyn that was king Howelles nece king of little
Brytayn. And after he slew in battle y^ emperor of Rome that was called
Lucie / that had assembled against king Arthur for to fight with him so much
people of Romans and Phethis and sarasyns / y^ no man could nombre them / and
he discomfited them all as y^ story tells. And in y^ same time the common
voice spronge in England through coniectynge and ordinance of the friar
prechers / that sir Edward of Car naruan / that was king Edwardes fader / of
whom the gest tells / said y^ he was alive in y^ castle of Corf / wherefore
al y^ comyns of England almoost were in sorrow and dread whether it were so or
not For they wist not how traytoursly Mortimer had done him to be murdered.

How Edmond of wodstok y^ was earl of Kent and the kings brother Edward of
Carnaruan was heded at Wynchestre.
ANd on a certain time it befell so that sir Edmond of wodstock earl of Kent
spoke unto the pope John the.xxij. at Auinyon and said y^ almighty god had
often times done for Thomas lone of Laneastre many great miracles to many men
and women / y^ were through diverse maladyes undone (as unto the world) and
through his prayer they were brought to their health / and so sir Edmond prayed
y^ pope hertely y^ he would grant hy^ grace y^ the foresaid Thomas might be
translated. But y^ pope said nay / that he should not be translated unto the
time he were better certyfyed of the clergy of England and seen by their
obedyence what thing god had done for y^ love of saint Thomas of Lancastre
after y^ suggestyon that y^ foresaid earl of Kent had made to him. And when
this Edmond saw y^ he might not speed of his purpose as touching the
translacyon / he prayed hy^ of counsel as touching sir Edward of Carnaruan
his brother / and said not long ago he was king of England / what thing might
best be done as touching his deliuerau^ce / sith y^ a common fame is through
England y^ he is alive and safe. When the pope herd him tell y^ sir Edward
was alive / he commanded the earl upon his benyson y^ he should help with all
the power y^ he might y^ he were delivered out of prison / and save his body in
all y^ he might / and to bring this thing to an end he assoyled him and his
company (a pe na et culpa) and al tho y^ help to his deliverance. Than took
Edmond of wodstok his leave of the pope and came again in to England. And when
sir Edmond was comen / some of y^ friar prechers came and said y^ sir Edward
his brother yet was alive in y^ castle of Corf / under y^ keeping of sir Thomas
Gurney. Tho sped him the foresaid Edmond as fast as he might till he came to y^
castle of Corf / and aqueynted him and spoke so fair with John Daueryll / that
was constable of y^ same castle / and gave him rich gifts to have
acquaintance of him and to know of his counsel. And thus it befell y^ the
foresaid sir Edmond prayed specially to tell him pryuely of his lord his
brother sir Edward / if y^ he lived or were deed / and if he were alive he
prayed hy^ ones to have a sight of him. And this sir John Daueryll was a hye
herted man and full of courage / and answered shortly to sir Edmond and said /
that sir Edward his brother was in health and under his keeping / and durst not
show him to no man sith it was defended hy^ in y^ kings half Edward y^ was
Edwardes sone of Carnaruan / and also by the commandment of queen Isabell y^
kings mother / and of sir Roger Mortymer / y^ he should show his body to no man
of the world / save only to them upon life and ly^me and disheryting of his
heirs for evermore But the false traitor falsely lied / for he was not in his
ward / but he was taken thens and lad to y^ castle of Berkeley by sir Thomas
Gurney / by commandment of Mortimer till he was deed as before is said / but
sir Edmond of wodstok wist no thing y^ sir Edward his brother was deed /
whereupon he took a lettre to king Edward his brother as to his worthy lord. And
received y^ lettre of hy^ and behight him to do his message without any fail.
And with y^ sir Edmond took leave of the foresaid John and went in to his own
country and lordshyp i^ Kent y^ he had there. And anon as this same John wist
y^ sir Edmond was gone in to Kent his own lordship / he went in all the haste
y^ be might fro the castle of Corf and came to sir Roger Mortimer / and took
him y^ lettre y^ sir Edmond of wodstok earl of Kent had taken him closed and
ensealed with his own seal. And when sir Roger Mortimer had received the lettre
/ he unclosed it and saw what was contained therein / and began to read it /
whereof y^ begy^nynge was this. Worshyps and reverence with broders legeaunce
and subie^cyon. Sir knight worshipful and dear brother / if it please you I
pray you hertely y^ ye be in good com forte / for I shall so ordeyne for you /
that ye shall come out of prison and be delivered of that disease that ye be
in. And understand of your great lordshyp y^ I have to mine assentyng almoost
all the great lords of England with all their apparayle / y^ is to say /
with armure / with tresour without nombre / for to maynteyne your quarrel / so
ferforth that ye shall be king again as ye were before / and that they have
sworn to me upon a book / and as well prelates as earls and barons. When sir
Roger Mortimer saw and understood the might and the strength of the lettre /
anon his heart for wrath began to boll and evil heart bare toward sir Edmond
of wodstok y^ was earl of Kent / and with all the haste that he might he went
unto dame Isabell y^ queen y^ was y^ kings mother and showed her sir Edmondes
lettre / his will and his purpose / and how that he had coniected and ordained
to put down king Edward of wyndsore her sone of his ryalte and of his kingdom.
Now certes sir Roger said she / has sir Edmond done so now by my faders soul
said she I will be thereof avenged / if that god grant me life / and that in a
short time. And with y^ the queen Isabel went to king Edward her sone there as
he was at the parlyament at Wynchestre for to amend the wrongs and the
trespaces that were done among the people of his realm / and she took and
showed him the lettre that sir Edmond of wodstock had made and ensealed with
his own seal / and badde him upon her blessing that he should be avenged
upon sir Edmonde as upon his deedly enemy. Than was the queen sore wroth
toward sir Edmonde earl of Kent / and cessed never to pray unto her sone till
that he had sent in all the haste after him. And upon that the king sent by his
lettres after sir Edmond of wodstok / that he should come and speak with him at
Wynchestre all manner things left. And when sir Edmond saw y^ the king sent
after him with his lettres ensealed he hasted him in all that he might till
that he came to wynchestre. But when the queen wist that sir Edmonde was comen
to wynchestre / anon she went and prayed so fast unto king Edward her sone
that y^ good earl was arested anon and ladde unto y^ bar before Robert of
Hamond y^ was Crowner of the kings household / and he assocyed to him sir
Roger Mortimer. And than spoke the fore said Robert and said. Sir Edmond earl
of Kent / ye shall understand that it is done us to wit / and pry^cypally
unto our lyege lord the king Edward of England almighty god him save and
keep / that ye be his deedly enemy and a traitor / and also a common enemy unto
the realm / and that ye have been about many a day for to make preuy
delyuerau^ce of sir Edward sometime king of England your brother the which
sometime was put down of his royalte by y^ common assent of y^ lords of
England in appeasynge of our lord the kings estate / and also of his realm.
Than answered the good man and said. Forsothe sir understand well y^ I was
never traitor to my king / ne to the realm / and that I do me on god and on
all the world / and therefore by my kings leave I shall it preue and defend as
a man ought to do. Than said Mortymer. Sir Edmonde it is so ferforth known y^
it may not be well gaynsayd / and that in presence of all that be here it shall
be well proved Now had this false Mortimer the same lettre that sir Edmond had
taken to sir John Daueryll in the castle of Corf for to take to king Edward
his brother that sir Edmonde wist not of / ne supposed nothing y^ sir John
Daueryll had been so falls to deliver his lettre in such wise to Mortimer / and
thought no manner thing of the lettre. Than Mortimer said to sir Edmonde and
showed y^ lettre sealed / and asked him if that he knew that lettre and the
seal. This sir Edmond looked thereon and auysed him long time on y^ print of y^
seal / for he might not se y^ lettre wtin / and wist well y^ it was his seal
/ and thought that it had be^ some lettre y^ had borne no great charge / and
thought nothing on y^ other lettre / and said openly in herynge of them all.
Ye forsothe this is my seal / and I will it not forsake. Loo said Mortymer /
syrs ye here all what he has said and that he knowlegeth y^ this is his lettre
and his seal / and now ye shall here what is contained therein. And than this
Mortimer opened y^ lettre y^ he had folden a fore together / and red it openly
word by word in hering of them all. And when y^ lettre was red he said / loo
syrs ye have herd all that here is written / and that he has knowleged y^ this
is his lettre and his seal and he may not go therfro. And than they cried and
gave dome that he should be hanged and drawn and his heed smytte^ of in manner
of a traitor / and he and his heirs dysheryted for evermore / and so he was
ladde forth and put in to prison. And when this was done / and y^ queen wist
that he was dampened by way of y^ law both of life and lymme / and his heirs
dysheryted for ever more / through open knowlegynge in plain court / wherefore
them thought that it were good y^ the foresaid sir Edmond were hastily slain
without wytynge of y^ king / or else the king would lightly forgive him his
death / and than it should turn them to much sorrow / so as he was empeched.
And anon the queen through counseyle of Mortimer / and without any other
counseyle / sent in haste to the baylyfe of wynchestre y^ he should sinyte of
sir Edmondes heed of wod(...)ok earl of Kent without any manner abiding or
respyte / upon pain of life and lymme / and that he should have none other
execucyon because of taryenge / not withstandyng the judgment. Than took y^
baylyfe sir Edmond out of prison / and ladde him beside y^ castle of wynchestre
/ and there they made a gongfermer to smite of his dyed for none other durst do
it. And so he dyed there / alas y^ while / y^ is to say y^. (...). day of
October / the third year of king Edwardes regne. And when y^ king wist thereof
/ he was wonders sorry / and let bury him at ye friar Minours at winchestre.

Of the death of sir Roger Mortymer earl of March.
ANd so it befell at y^ time that sir Roger Mortimer earl of march was so
proud and so hawteyne y^ he held no lord of the realm his pere. And than
became he so covetous that he followed dame Isabell the queen's court y^ was
king Edwardes mother / and beset his penyworthes with the officers of the queen's
household in y^ same manner y^ the kings officers did. And so he made his taking
as touching vytayles / and also of caryages / and all he did for because of
e^penses and to gadre tresour / and so he did without nombre in all that he
might. Than made he him wonders preuy with the queen Isabell / and so much
lordshyp and retynue he had / that all the great lords of England of him were
adrad. Wherefore the king and his counsel toward him were agreued / and
ordained among them to undo him through pure reason and law / because that
king Edward that was the kings fader tray^oursly through him was murdered in
y^ castle of Corf / as before is said more plainly in the same part of this
book of his death. And some that were of the kings counseyle loved Mortimer /
and told him in preuite how that the king and his counseyle were about from
day to day him for to destroy and undo. Wherefore Mortimer was sore anoyed
and angry as the devil against them yt were of ye kings counsel / and said
he would of them be avenged how so ever he took on. It was not long afterward
that king Edward and dame Philip his wife / and dame Isabell the kings mother /
and sir Roger Mortymer ne went unto Notyngham there for to soiourne. And so it
befell that queen Isabell through counseyle of Mortimer took to her the keys of
ye gates of ye castle of Notyngham / so that no man might come in nor out by
night / but through commandment of Mortimer / ne ye king nor none of his
counsel. And that time it befell so that Mortimer as a devil for wrath
boiled / and also for wrath ye he had against the kings men / and pryncypally
against them yt had accused him to the king of ye death of sir Edward his fader.
And pryuely a counseyle was taken between queen Isabell and Mortymer and the
bishop of Lyncolne and sir Symond of Bedford and sir Hugh of Trompyngton and
other preuy of their counsel for to undo them al ye had accused Mortimer unto
ye king of his faders death of treason and of felony. Wherefore all those yt
were of the kings counsel wha^ they wist of Mortimers casting / pryuely
came to king Edward and said that Mortimer would destroy them because they
had accused him of king Edwardes death his fader and prayed him yt he would
maynteyne them in their right. And these were the lords yt pursued this
quarrel / sir William of Mountagu / sir Vmfrey de Boghun / sir William his
brother / sir Rauf of Stafford / sir Robert of Herford / sir Willyam of Clynton
/ sir John Neuyll of Nornby and many other of their consent / and all these
swore upon a book to maynteyne the quarrel in as much as they might. And it
befell so after that sir Wyllyam of Mountagu ne none of ye kings friends must
not be herborowed in the castle for Mortimer / but went and took their
herborowe in diverse places of ye town of Notyngham. And tho were they sore
adrad lest that Mortimer should destroy them / and in haste came unto king
Edward sir Willyam of Mou^tagu yt than was in ye castle / and pryuely told
him that he nor none of his company should not take Mortimer without counseyle
and help of Wyllyam of Eland constable of the same castle. Now truly said ye
king I love you well / and therefore I counseyle you that ye go to the foresaid
constable and command him in my name that he be your friend and your help
for to take Mortimer / all thing left upon peril of life and lymme. Than said
Mou^tagu / sir my lord grant mercy. Than went forth the foresaid Mou^tagu and
came to the constable of the castle / and told him the kings will. And he
answered and said the kings will should be done in as much as he might / and
that he would not spare for no manner death / and so he swore and made his oath.
Than said sir Willyam of Mountagu to the constable / in herynge of all them
that were helpyng unto the same quarrel. Now certes dear friend / us behooves
to work and do by your advise for to take Mortymer / sith that ye be keeper of
the castle and have the keys in your ward. Sir said the constable ye shall
understand that ye gates of the castle ben locked with the locks that dame
Isabell sent hither / and by night she has the keys thereof and lays them
under the leuesell of the bed till on the morrow / and so ye may not come in
to the castle by the gates in no manner of wise / but I know an aley that
stretches out of the ward under ye earth in to ye foresaid castle / yt goth in
to ye west which aley dame Isabell the queen ne none of her men / nor Mortymer
ne none of his company knows it not. And so I shall led you through ye aley
/ and so ye shall come in to the castle without espyenge of any men yt be your
enemies. And the same night sir William Mou^tagu and all the lords of his
quarrel / and the same constable also went to horse them / and made semblau^t
as it were for to go out of Mortimers sight. But anon as Mortimer herd these
tidings / he wend yt they would have gone over see for fere of him And anon
he and his company took a counsel among them for to let their passage /
and sent lettres anon to the ports / so that none of the great lords should
go home to their own countries but if they were arested and taken. And among
other things Willyam Eland constable of ye foresaid castle / privily lad sir
William of Mou^tagu and his company by the foresaid way under the earth till
they came in to the castle / and went up in to the toure where as Mortymer was
in. But sir Hugh of Trompyngton them escryed hydously and said. A traitors it
is all for naught that ye be come^ in to this castle ye shall dye yet an evil
death euerychone And anon one of them yt was in Mountagues company by with a
mace and smote the same Hugh upon ye heed yt the brayn brast out and fell on ye
ground / and so dyed he an evil death. Than took they Mortymer as he armed
him at ye toures door when he herd ye noise of them for dread And when queen
Isabell saw ye Mortymer was taken / she made much sotowe in heart / and these
words to them said. Now fair syrs I pray you yt ye do no harm to his body a
worthy knight our well-beloved friend and our dear cosyn. Tha^ went they thens
and came and brought Mortimer and presented him unto king Edward. And he
commanded to bring him in safe ward. But anon as they that were consentyng
unto Mortimers doing herd tell yt he was taken / they went and hid them /
and p^^urly by night went out of the town eueryche in to his country with an
heavy heart and mournyng chere / and lived upon their lands as well as they
might. And so that same year yt Mortymer was taken he had at his retynue.ix.
score knights without squyers and sergeauntes of arms and footmen. And than
was Mortymer ladde to London / and sir Symond of Bedford was ladde with him /
and was taken to the constable of the toure to keep. But afterward was
Mortymers life examyned at Westmynster before the king and before all the great
lords of England / for peril that might fall to the realm / and to inquire
also which were consenting to sir Edwardes death the kings fader / and also
through whom the Scotts escaped fro Scanhope in to Scotlonde without the will
of king Edward. And also how yt charter of Ragman was delivered unto the
Scotts / wherein the homages and frautees of ye lords of Scotlonde were
contained / that the Scotts should do ever more unto the English king for
the realm of Scotlo^de / wherefore in his absence he was dampened to be draw^^
and hanged for his treason. And this myschefe came to him on saint Andrews
even / in the year of ye incarnacyon of our lord Jesus Christ. M.CCC. and rxx.

Now king Edward gate again unto him gracyously ye homages and f^au^^es of
Scotlonde / whereof he was put out through false counsel of queen Isabell his
mother and sir Roger Mortymer / that was newly made earl of March^.
NOw have ye herd how sir John Bayloll in the time of peace was chosen to be
king of Scotlonde / because that he came of ye eldest daughter of the earl
David of Huntyngton yt was king Alysaunders brother of Scotlond yt dyed without
heir of his body begoten. And how this John made his feaute and homage to king
Edward Henryes sone ye third for his lands of Scotlonde. And how he
afterward wtsayd his homage through counsel of the Scotts / in the year of
our lord. M.CC.lxxiiij. and sent unto the pope through a falls suggestion that
he made his oath unto the foresaid king Edward over his estate and his will of
the which oath ye pope him assoyled through his bulls to hy^ sent. And anon
as king Edward wist thereof / he ordained anon his barons and came to Barwyk
and conquered the town / at which conquest there were slain.xxv. M. and
vij.C. and Bayloll yt was king of Scotlonde came and yielded him to good king
Edward / and the king afterward delivered him out of ye toure of London / and
all ye great lords with him that tho were taken at Barwyk / and gave them
saufconduyte to go in to Scotlonde. And the Scotts ^ith through their falsnes
warred upon the good king Edward. And when sir John Bayloll king of Scotlonde
saw all this he went over see unto Dunpier and lived there upon his lands as
well as he might till yt the Scotts would amend them of their mysoedes and
trespace and ^ad with hy^ sir Edward his sone / wherefore ye Scotts in despyte of
him called him sir John Turnlabaerd / for because that he would not offend ne
trespace against ye good king Edward of England. And so he forsook his realm
of Scotlonde / and set thereof but little price. And this sir Johan dwelled long
time in France till yt he dyed there. And sir Edward his sone received his
heritage / and did homage to ye king of France / for his lands of Dunpier.
And so it befell afterward that Edward yt was John Baylols sone had with him a
squire of england that was borne in yorkshyre / yt was called John of Barnaby
/ and this Edward Bayloll loved him much / and was nygh him and full preuy.
And so this John of Barnaby was in debate with a frensshe man in ye town of
Du^pier / and so he slew him and went his way in all ye haste yt he might in
to ye castle for to have help of his lord. And anon came ye officers of ye
town to take John of Barnaby as a felon / and sir Edward his lord help him
and rescowed him / and by night made him go out of ye castle / and so he went
his way and came in to England without any harm. And when ye king of France
saw yt sir Edward had rescowed his felon / he became wonders wroth against
sir Edward / and anon let arest him / and took in to his hands all his
lands. Than dwelled sir Edward in prison unto ye time yt sir Henry of Beaumont
came in to France / the which Henry was sometime earl of Angos in Scotlonde
through his wife and was put out thereof wha^ ye accordeme^t was between
England and Scotlond through queen Isabell and Roger Mortimer and their
company / for ye marriage yt she made between Dauyd yt was Robert ye Brus sone
and dame Ione of ye toure king Edwardes sister of England / and well
understood this yt at ye end he should come to his right / but if it were sir
Edward Bayloll yt was right heir of ye realm of Scotlonde. And the king of
France Lowys loved much this sir Henry / and he was with him full preuy / and
thought for to make a delyuerau^ce of sir Edward Bayloll if he might in any
manner of wise. Tho prayed he ye king ye it would please his noble grace to
grant him sir Edward Baylols body unto ye next parlyament that he might live
with his own tents in the mean time / and yt he might stand to be judged with
his peers at ye parlyament. And ye king granted him his prayer / and made the
foresaid Edward to be delivered out of prison in the manner above said. And
anon as he was out of prison / sir Henry took him forth with him and ladde him
in to England / and made him dwell pryuely at ye manner of Sandhall upon Ouse
in Yorkeshyre with the lady Vescy. And so he ordained him there an huge retynue
of Englysshemen and also of alyens for to conquer again his heritage. And so
he gave much silver to the sowdyours and to alyens for to help him And they
behyght for to help him in yt they might / but they failed him at his most
need. And at yt time Donald earl of Moryf herd tell how yt sir Edward Baylol
was privily come in to England and came to him and made great joy of his
coming again / and said to him and behyght him yt all ye great lords of
Scotlonde should be to him attendau^t / and should hold him for king as right
heir of Scotlo^de / and did to hy^ homage and feaute. Than came sir Henry of
Beaumont to king Edward of England / and prayed him in ye way of charity
that he would grant of his grace to sir Edward Bayloll that he might safely go
by land from Sandhal unto Scotlo^de to co^quere his right and herytaunce in
Scotlonde. The king answered and said. If that I suffer Bayloll go through my
land in to Scotlonde / the people would say yt I should be assentyng unto ye
company. Now sir I pray you that ye would give him leave to take with him
sowdyours of English me^ yt they might safely led hy^ through your land in
to Scotlo^de. And sir upon this covenant yt if it so befall (as god it
forbydde) he be dyscomfyted in battle through the Scotts / that I and also
all ye lords that hold with Bayloll ben for ever more out of your rentes that
we have in England. And there ye king upon this covenant granted their bone
as touching him and those yt were of the same quarrel the which claymed for
to have lands and rentes in ye realm of Scotlo^de And these were ye names of
those lords that pursued this foresaid quarrel yt is to say / sir Edward
Bayloll the which challenged the realm of Scotlonde, sir Henry Beaumo^t earl
of Angos / sir David of Stroboly earl of Atheles / sir (...)frey of Mombray /
Walter Common and many other yt were put out of (...)rytage in Scotlonde when ye
(...) made between England and S(...) (...) before is said. And ye shall (...)
that these lords took with them.v.C. (...) of arms and.ij. M. archers and (...)
and tho went in to ship at (...) and sailed by the sea till that they (...)
unto Scotlonde / and came to land (...) kehorne.xij. mile from sayn^ Ioh(...)
town. And anon sent out their (...)pes again / for that they should no^
(...) hurt ne empayred / neither that no man should go in to ye ships again
though that they had need / but abide all (...) and not ^^ee but stand / and
rather (...) death tha^ flee for to mayn(...) (...) quarrel. When the earl of
Fi(...) a (...) man and a stern herd that (...) comen for to take the land
of Scotlonde he came in haste to kynkehorne with xij. M. scotts for to
destroy him that he should not come to land. But sir Edward Bayloll and his
company dyscomfyted him there / at ye which discomfyture sir Alysau^der of
Seron was there slain / and many other. The earl of Fyffe was tho sore and
full ill ashamed / that so little a company had dyscomfy^^d him and shamefully
put him and all his company that were alive for to flee. Than came sir Edward
Bayloll and took ye coun tree all about him till he came unto the abbey of
Dunfermelin / and there he found vytayles for him and for his folk / and
among all things he found in a chamber about.v.C. of great staves of fine
oak with long pykes of yren and of stele / and he took them and delivered them
to the most strongest men of his company. And anon after he went from thens
and lodged him in a field two mile fro saint Johannes town. And when the
burgeyses of the town herd how the earl of Fiffe was dysco^fyted through
Bayloll / they were fore adrad / and brake their brydges yt they had made over
ye water of Erne / so that Baylol might not go over / wherefore he lodged him
there all yt night / but little head he took of rest / and said unto his
people. Now dear lords ye know full well that we be now lodged between our
enemies / and if they may us hampre there is no bote but death / wherefore if we
abide still here all this night / I wene it shall turn us to much harm. For
ye power of Scotlonde may ever wexe and encreace and we may not so do / and we
be but little people against them / wherefore I pray you for ye love of
almighty god make we us bold and hardy / and yt we may myghtely take the
Scotts this night / and boldly war upon them / and let us pursue them this
night / and if they be through us trauayled and se our hardynes / other scotts
that se them so trauayled and weary / the sorer will they be adrad with us to
fight / and fyersly than shall we fight with them and on them pursue / so yt
through y^ grace of god al y^ world shall speak of y^ dough tynes of our
chyuairy. And syrs understand well that all the company y^ came with sir Edward
Bayloll granted well to y^ counsel / and were thereof right glad / and anon
pursued upon the Scotts y^ they became wonders weary. And Bayloll and his
company sore followed them / and did them much harm and sorrow through their
assaut / so y^ they might not for feebleness them help / and for little people.
But tho said y^ Scotts among them / what is now befall that so little people
as Bayloll has in wynge does us so much travail and sorrow. Now certes it
seems us that he werketh by grace / for he is wonders gracyous in his quarrel
/ and we certes shall be deed or that we may come to hy^ us for to yield / sith
that his fader set of us no price. And among all other things Bayloll and his
people passed the water of Erne / so that sir Roger of Swynerton the sone was
fyers and angry and went forth / and they saw people of arms full well arrayed
/ and forth they went unto them and with them faught / and slew and took as
many as would abide. And nevertheless at yt assaut they wend it had been the
great host of Scotlonde. And when it came to the morrow they gadred them
together and rested them a while. And while ye englisshmen rested them / the
noble baron Thomas Vescy and the noble baron of stafford pricked their horses
up and down by ye hills for to keep the estres of y^ country / and as they
prycked up and down they saw a great host of good array ordained in their
wings with helmes and sheldes shynynge coming upon them. And there came tho
two lords again to Baylols folk / and said. Now for the love of god be of
good comfort / for ye shall have battle anon right. And tho spoke sir Fouke
ye sone of Gareyne a baron of great renome and of deeds of arms. Syrs
understand what I will say. I have seen many diverse wings / as well among
sarasyns and jews as among y^ scotts / and yet saw I never the fourth part
of the wynge fight / and therefore if ye will abide our enemies we be enough to
fight against them. But if we be not of good heart and of good courage we be but
lost / and therefore for the love of god let us take to us good heart / and let
us be bold / and think we never on our wives ne on our children / but only
to co^quere our enemies in battle and through the help of our lord god we
shall them overcome. And with yt came the host of the Scotts toward them
full surely and against sir Edward Bayloll in three bataylles well arrayed in
armure / and wonders fyersly they came toward Baylols company. But wha^ sir
Donald earl of Marcil that was with y^ Scotts saw all this / he said to
Robert Brus the sone of Robert the Brus these words. Sir Roberte said he /
full sore me forthynketh at my heart yt these people that Bayloll has brought
with him should dye with dynt of scotts swerdes lyth yt they be christen men as
we be / and therefore me thy^keth yt it were great charity to send unto them
for to yield them to our mercy / and raunsom them through grievous raunsom / for
as much as they have taken our land and done ill. Now certes said sir Robert
y^ Brus / I have well perceived that you art an enemy and a traitor to Scotlonde
/ sith that you wylt consent to save our deedly enemies / yt have done us so
much sorrow and shame / and now it seems well that ye be of their assent. Now
certes Roberte (said sir Donald) falsely ye lie / I am not of their company ne
of their consent / and that hastily ye shall se / for I will fight with them
rather than any of this company / and certes sir Roberte said he I shall in
maugre of thy heed assail them or thou. And with that they prycked their
stedes fyersly on Gaskmo re / and their wings them followed on a re^ge / and
tho came they and met with Bayloll and his company at an hanging bough of the
more in a strayte passage / and so fast they hasted them unto the englysshmen
that thousands fell to the ground each over other in to an hepe both horse
and man Sir Bayloll and his men myghtely stood against them and fast slew the
Scotts to the ground / and many they fore wounded so long till that they
stood upon them and foyned them with their swerdes and speres through their
bodies / and full sore they were trauayled upon them / till yt they became
wonders weary / and wist not what for to do. And y^ Scotts that were left
alive fled away for to save themself in the best manner that they might. And
tho pursued them sir Edward Ba(...) and his men / and slew of them till it
was night. And fro thens they went to saint John's town / and took it and held
them there / and vytayled themself at their own will / for they found enough
where with to make them merry. Than made Bayloll his men yt were wounded go to
ship for to sail in to England to (...) their wou^des. And in y^ time there
was a flemyng in y^ see a strong thief and a robber yt was called Crab / and
this flem(...) was dryue^ out of Flau^dres for his wyckednes / and therefore he
came in to scotlond to hold with y^ scotts / and did as me^^e harm to y^
Englisshme^ as he might to And this Crab met this Bay^e^s men in y^ see yt
were wounded before in baray^e that were sent again in to England (...) to
hele their wou^des / and this Crab gave to them a great assaure and would have
slain them. But y^ Englysshmen defended them manfully and dysco^fyced Crab and
his company / and he fled in to Scotlonde. And as he came toward saint John's
town / he found a great company of Scotts yt were comen again together after
y^ discomfyture of Gaskemore the which besyeged Bayloll and his men in the
same town of saint John. And anon told to the Scotts how that he was
discofyted of y^ Englysshmen that were wounded at Gaskmore y^ went toward
England for to hele their wou^des / and said to the scotts yt they should
have no power ne might nor grace against Edward Bayloll / because that he
dyscomfyted and empayred all the chiualry of Scotlonde with a handful of men
as to account against the Scotts that were slain / wherefore he cou^seyled to
remeue y^ siege from saint John's town / and keep them in y^ best manner that
they might. The Scotts understood yt Crab said sothe / and forsook ye syege
and went thens by night and help themself in y^ best manner yt they might.
When this thing was known through Scotlonde how that y^ lords and knights
were disco^fyted at Gaskmore of Scotlond through sir Edward Bayloll / ye shall
understand that ye lords and ladies and the gentyls of Scotlonde came wonders
fast to saint John's town / and yielded them to Bayloll / and to him did homage
and feaute for their lands / and yielded them to his peace. And he them received
freely / and fro thens he went to ye abbey of Scone / and there he was crowned
king of Scotlonde / and after he let cry his peace throughout all the land.
And at yt same time it befell that king Edward held his parlyament among his
lyeges at new castle upon Tyne / for to amend y^ trespaces and the wrongs
yt had been done in his land / and sir Edward Bayloll king of Scotlonde came to
him thither / and did to him homage and feaute for y^ realm of Scotlonde. And
in this manner king Edward of England gadred again his homages and feautees of
Scotlond / whereof he was put out through counseyle and assent of dame Isabell
his mother / and of sir Roger Mortimer earl of March. Than took Baylol king of
Scotlonde his leave of king Edward of England / and went thens in to his own
land of Scotlonde and set but little by such as had cou^seyled and helped him
in his quarrel / wherefore they went from him / and went and lived by their
lands and rentes in Scotlond. And so it befell not long afterward that the
king of Scotlonde ne remeued and came to the toure of Anand / and there took
his dwelling / and thither came to him a company of knights / strong men and
worthy / and yielded them unto y^ king / and bare them so fair in deed and in
cou^tenau^ce / so that he trusted much upon them. And anon as ye traitors
saw yt he trusted much upon them / they ordained among them fyfty in a
company / and would have slain their lord y^ king. But through y^ grace of
almighty god he brake through a wall an hole in his chamber / and as god would
escaped their treachery / and all his men were slain / and he escaped with much
dread unto ye town of Cardoyll / and there he held hy^ sore anoyed. And this
befell on our ladies even ye concepcyon. Than sent king Edward Bayloll to king
Edward of England how falsely and traytoursly he was in little time put to
shame and sorrow through his lyege men / on whom he trusted wonders much / and
prayed hy^ for the love of god yt he would maynteyn him and help him against
his enemies The king of England had of him great pity / and behyght to help
and socour him / and sent him word that he should hold him in the foresaid
cite of Cardoyll till that he had gadred his power. Than ordained king Edward
of England a counseyle at London / and he let gadre his men in diverse shyres
of England. And when he was all ready / he went toward the town of Barwyk upon
Twede / and thither came unto him king Edward Bayloll of Scotlonde with his
power and besyeged the town / and made without y^ town a fair town of
pauylyons / and die ched them all about / so that they had no dread of the
Scotts / and made many assautes with gonnes and with other engynes to the town
/ wherwt they destroyed many fair houses / and chirches also were beten down
to y^ earth with great stones that spytefully came out of gonnes and of other
engynes. Nevertheless y^ Scotts kept well the town / that ye two kings might
not come therein long time. And the kings abode there so long till those that
were wtin the town failed vitayles and also they were so weary of waking / yt
they wist not what to do. And ye shall understand yt the Scotts yt were in the
town of Barwyk through y^ common cou^ seyle and their assent let cry upon the
walls of the town yt they might have peace of the Englysshmen / and thereof
they prayed the king of his grace and mercy / and prayed hy^ of trewse
for.viij. days upon this covenant / yt if they were not rescowed in yt side
of the town toward Scotlonde of y^ Scotts within.viij. days / yt they would
yield them unto ye king and the town also / and to hold this covenant they
profred to y^ king.xij. hostages out of the town of Barwyk. When the hostages
were delivered to y^ king / anon they of the town sent to y^ Scotts / and
told them of their sorrow and myschefe. And y^ Scotts came than privily over
the water of Twede to y^ bought of y^ abbey / and sir willyam Diket yt was tho
steward of Scotlonde and many other yt came with him / put themself in great
peril of their lives at yt time / for they came over a bridge yt was broken
and the stones away / and many of their company were there drowned / but the
foresaid Wyllyam went over and other of his company / and came by y^ ships of
England / and slew in a barge of Hull xvj. men / and after they went in to y^
town of Barwik by ye water side. Wherefore y^ Scotts held than y^ town
rescowed / and asked their hostages again of the king of England. And the
king sent them word again y^ they asked their hostages with wrong / sith
that they came in to the town of England side / for covenant was between
them yt the town should be rescowed by ye half of Scotlonde. Than anon
commanded king Edward to yield the town or he would hang y^ hostages. And the
Scotts said the town was rescowed well enough / and thereto they would them
hold. When king Edward saw the Scotts break their covenant that they had
made / he was wonders wroth / and anon let take sir Thomas fitz Willyam and
sir Alyfau^der of Feton wardeyn of Barwyk / the which Thomas was parsone of
Dunbar / and let them be taken first before that other hostages / by cause that
sir Alysaunders faders was keeper of the town. And tho commanded every day
two hostages of y^ town till that they were all done to death / but if they
yielded y^ town / and so he should teache them to break their covenant. And
wha^ they of the town herd these tidings they became wonders sorry / and sent
to the king yt he would grant them other. v(...). days of respyte / so y^
between tho hundred men of arntes and.xx. me^ of arms might by strength go
between them to the town of Barwik them force vitayle that ye town must be
hold for restowed And if so were that.xxj. or.xxij. or more were slain of
tho.C. beforesayd that ye town should not be holden for restowed And this
covenant to be holde^ they sent to him other.xij. of y^ foresaid town in
hostage. The king granted them their prayer / and took y^ hostages on saint
Margaretes even / in y^ year of grace. M.ccc. and xxxij. the Scotts came
pricking fyersly in four wings well arrayed in arms for to mete king Edward
of England and Edward ye king of Scotlonde and with their power / and came fast
and sharply against euensonge time / and the same time was flode at Barwik in
the water of Twede that no man might go over on his horse nor on foot / and the
water was between the two kings and ye realm of England And that time abode
the Scotts on ye other side / because yt the Englysshmen should have been
drowned.

This was ye array of ye scotts how yt they came in battle against ye two

foresaid town of Barwyk with an.C. men of arms / and also the comyns of ye

The sum of the comyns amou^teth to.liij. M. and. ij.C. The sum total of ye
people above said amounts lvj. M. vij.C.xlv. And these.lxvj. great lords lad
all ye other great lords above said in.iiij. batayles / as it is told before
all on foot. And king Edward of England and Edward Baylloll king of Scotlonde
had well apparayled their folk in iiij. batayles for to fight on foot against
the Scotts their enemies. And ye English mynstrels blewe their tru^pets and
their claryons / and hidously escryed ye scotts. And tho had every englyssh
battle two wings of price archers / ye which at ye batayl shot arowes so
fast and so sore that the Scotts might not help them self / and they smote
ye scotts thousands to the ground / and they began for to flee fro the
englysshme^ to save their lives. And when y^ scottysshe knaves saw y^
disco^fyture and the scotts fall fast to y^ ground they fast prycked their
masters horses with the spurs for to keep them fro peril / and set their
masters at no force. And when y^ Englisshmen saw y^ / they lepte on their
horses and fast pursued y^ scotts / and all y^ abode they slew down right.
There men might se y^ doughtynes of y^ noble king Edward and of his men / how
manly they pursued y^ Scotts y^ fled for dread. And there men might se many a
scottisshman cast down to y^ ground deed and their baners displayed hacked in
to pieces / and many a good habergeon of stele in the blood bath. And many a
time y^ scotts were gadred in to companyes. But evermore they were
disco^fited. And so it befell as god would y^ the Scotts had y^ day no more
foyson ne might against the Englysshmen than.xx. sheep should have against.v.
wolves. And so were y^ Scotts disco^fited / and yet y^ Scotts had well.v. men
against one Englysshman / and y^ battle was done on Ha^ydownhyll beside y^
town of Barwyk / at y^ which battle were slain of y^ Scotts.xxxv. M.
vij.C. and.xij. And of Englysshmen but only.xiiij. and those were fotemen. And
this victory befell to y^ Englisshmen on saint Margaretes even / in y^ year of
the incarnacyon of our lord Jesus Christ M.CCC.xxxij. And while this doing
lasted y^ Englisshe pages took the pylfre of the Scotts y^ were slain / every
man might take without any chalengynge of any man. And so after this gracyous
victory the king returned again unto y^ same syege of Barwik. And wha^ they y^
were besyeged saw and herd how king Edward had sped / they yielded to him y^
town with the castle on the morrow next after saint Margaretes day. And than
the king ordained sir Edward Baylloll with other noble and worthy men to be
kepers and governors of Scotlonde in his absence / and himself returned
again and came in to England after this vyctory with much joy and worship.
And in the next year following that is for to say / in the year of the
incarnacyon of our lord Jesus Christ. M.CCC. and.xxxiij. and of king Edwardes
regne.vij. he went again in to Scotlonde in winter time / at which ^^age the
castle of K(...)brygge in Scotlond for him and for his men that were with him
he recovered and had against the Scotts all at his own will. And in that same
year sir Edward Baylloll king of Scotlonde held his parlyament in Scotlonde
with many noble lords of England that were at that same parlyament / because
of their lands and also lordshyppes that they had in the realm of Scotlonde /
and held all of the same Edward Baylloll. And in the viij. year of king
Edwardes regne about the feast of saint John Baptyst (...) Edward Baylloll the
very and true king of Scotlonde / as by heritage and right line / made his
homage and feaute unto king Edward of England for the realm of Scotlo^d at
New castle upon Tyne / in the presence of many worthy lords and also of the
comyns both of the realm of England and also of Scotlonde. And anon after
in the same year king Edward of England retryued of the duke of Britayn his
homage for the erledome and lordshyp of ^ychemond. And so following in the.
(...). year of his regne after Mighe^mas rode in to Scotlonde / and there was
fast by said Johannes town almoost all the winter time / and so he held his
Chrystmasse at y^ castle of Rokesburgh. And in the same year through out al
England about sayt Clementes tide in winter there arose such a spryngynge and
wellynge up of water / and also of flodes / both of the sea and also of
fresshe ryuers and sprynges / that y^ see banks / walls and costs brake up
that men / beestes and houses in many places and namely in low countrees
violently and suddenly were drowned / and fruytes driven away of the earth
through contynuaunce and abundance of waters of the sea / ever more
afterward were turned in to more saltnes and sournes of savor. The.x. year of
king Edwardes regne king Edward entered the Scottysshe see after mydsomer / and
to many of the scotts he gave battle and overcame them / and many he treated
and bowed to his peace through his doughtynes. And after at Myghelmasse than
next following was the earl of Moryf taken at Edinburgh and brought in to
England and put in to prison. And in the months of June and July than next
following in the.xj. year of his regne was seen and appeared in y^ fyrmament a
bemed sterre the which clerks call stella Cometa / and that sterre was seen
in diverse parts of the fyrmament. Where after anon there followed in England
good chepe and wonders great plente of all chaffer vytayles and marchaundyse /
and there against honger / scarcete / myschefe / and need of money. In so much
that a quarter of whete at London was sold for two shyllynges / and a good
fat ox at a noble / and five good dove birds for a penny. In which year
dyed sir John of Eltham earl of Cornewayle that was king Edwardes brother / and
lies at Westmynster.

How king Edward made a duchy of the erledome of Cornewayle / and also of
six other earls that were new made / and of the first challenge of the
kingdom of France.
IN the year of our lord. M.CCC. and.xxxvij. and the.xij. year of king Edward
/ in the month of March / during the parlyament at Westmynster in lent time
king Edward made of the erledome of Cornewayle a duchy / and let it call y^
duchy of Cornewayle / the which duchy he gave to Edward his first sone / with
the erledome of Chestre. And also king Edward made at the same time.vj. other
earls / that is to say / sir Henry earl of La^casters sone earl of Leycestre /
Willya^ of Boghun earl of Northhamton / Willyam of Mountagu earl of Salisbury /
Hugh of Awdell earl of Glocestre / Robert of Vfford earl of Suffolk and
Willyam of Cliton earl of Huntyngton. And in that same year it was ordained in
the same parlyame^t y^ no man should were no cloth that was wrought out of
England / as of cloth of gold ne of sylke or velvet or damask or satyn baud
kyn / ne none such other / ne none wild ware ne furs of beyond y^ see /
but such as might spend an hundred pound of rent by year. But this
ordinance and statute was but of little effect / for it was nothing holden. In
the.xiij. year of his regne king Edward went over the sea in to Braba^d with
queen Philip his wife there beryng a child at And w^rp there he dwelled more
than a year for to treat with the duke of Braba^d and other alyed unto him of
the chalengynge of y^ kingdom of France to king Edward of England by right
and by heritage after the death of Karoll the great king of France brother
germayn of queen Isabel king Edwardes mother / the which was holden and
occupied unrightfully by Philip of Valoys y^ emes sone of Karoll The which
duke and all his in y^ foresaid things and all other longyng thereto with all
his men and goods king Edward found ready unto him and made and behyght ^

And all the (...)rdes of every town wh(...) such^thynges should be taxed and
gadred (...) to y^ king thereof / and he h(...) and held (...) at his own ^^st
and will. W(...) I shall knowledge the very troth / the inner love of y^ people
was (...) into hate / and y^ common prayers in to (...) / for cause that y^
common people were so strongly grieved. Also the foresaid (...) of France had
gadred unto h^ a great host and destroyed there in his parties and kingdom
many of y^ kings friends of England with towns and (...) with many other of
their lordshyps / and many (...)s / shapes and despytes did unto y^ queen. Where
fore when king Edward herd this / he was strongly (...) and ^ngred therwt /
and sent diverse lettes over see to y^ queen and to other y^ were his friends in
gladding them / and certyfyenge them y^ he would he there himself in all y^
^aste y^ he might. And anon after rester (...) he had sped of all thyges that
him neded to have / he went over see again. Of whose coming the queen and all
his friends were wonders glad / and made much toye. And all y^ were his
enemies and held against him made his much sorrow. In the same time the king
through counsel of his true (...) and counsel of his lords y^ there were
present with him (...) y^ king of (...) name / and took (...) y^ kings arms
of Frafice quartred with the arms of England / (...) commanded forth with his
coin of gold under description and (...)yng of the name of England and of
France to be made best y^ might be / and y^ is to say / the floreyn y^ was
called y^ noble price of. v^. shyllynges.viij. pens sterlyng / and y^ half
noble y^ value.iij. shyllynges and* (...). peus and the farthynge of y^ value
of* (...). peus.

How king Edward came unto the Scluys and dyscomfyted all the power of
France in the haven.
ANd in y^ next year after / that is to say / the.xv. year of his ^egne he
commanded and let write in his chartres wryttes and other lettres the date of
the regne of France y^ first. And while that he was thus doing and
^rauaylynge (...) France through his counsel ^e wrote to all the prelates /
dukes / cries and barons and the noble lords of y^ country / and also to
diverse of the common people diverse l(...)s and maundementes berynge date at
Gandaue the.viij. day of February. And anon after within a little time he
came again in to England with the queen and her children. And in y^ same year on
midsomer even he began to sail toward France as gayn / and manly and fyersly
he fell upon Philyp of ^aloys / the which long time lay and had gadred to
him a full great and boustous meyny of diverse nations in y^ haven of Scluys:
and there they fought to gyder y^ king of France and he with their ^o^^es fro
myddaye to three of y^ clock on the morrow / in y^ which battle were
slain.xxx. M. men of y^ kings company of France / and many ships and
cogges were taken. And so through gods (...) he had there y^ victory / and
bare theus a glorious ^heualry. And in y^ same year about saint James time would
y^ gates of saint Diners Roberte of A^theys (...) men of ing^^de and fla(...)
egerly fought against y^ duke of Blitgoyn and y^ frensshe men at which battle
were slain and taken of the Frensshmen.xv. barons.lxxx. knights / and ships
and barks were taken unto y^ no^bre of.CC. and.xxx. The same year y^ king
making and abydyng upon y^ syege of Turney ye earl of Henaud with englisshe
archers made assaut unto ye town of saint Amand / where as they slew.l.
knights and many other / and also destroyed the town. And in the.xvj. year of
his regne following in y^ winter time the king dwelled still upon y^ foresaid
syege and sent often time in to England unto his tresourer and other purueyours
for gold and money yt should be sent to him in his need but his proctours and
messengers cursedly and full slowly served him at his need and deceived him /
on whose defaut and laches the king took trewse between him and the king of
France. And tha^ king Edward full of sorrow and shame in his heart withdrewe
him fro y^ syege and came in to Bry tayn / and there was so great strife for
vytayle yt he lost many of his men / and when he had done there yt he came fore
he dressed him over see in to England. And as he sailed toward England in y^
high se^ the most myshappes storms and te^pestes thonder and lyghtnynge fell
to him in the sea / the which was said yt it was done and raised through evil
spirytes made by sorcery and nygromancy of them of frau^te Wherefore y^ kings
heart was full of soro we and anguysshe wellyng and syghynge and said unto our
lady i^ this wise. O blyssed lady saint Mary what is y^ cause y^ ever more
going in to France all things and wethers fall to me joyful and lyking as I
would have them / but always turnynge in to England all things fall un
profitable and very harmeful / nevertheless he stopyng an (...) of the s(...)
word came to the^ (...) of (...) styght. And ye same year y^ king would his
Christ(...)e at M(...)s (...) word to y^ Scotts (...) yt he was tidy and would
fight with (...) but the Scotts would not ^hyde / but fled over y^ scottysshe
(...) them as (...) as they might. And ^^che.xvij. year of his regne about y^
fe^^ of y^ co^ue^syon of saint Pauleking Edward wha^ he has been in Scotlonde
and saw yt the Scotts were fled (...) came again in to England. And a^ytel
before ^ent was y^ which tur neyment came all the young bachelary and cheualty
of England ^^many other ^rles and (...) at the (...) turneyment king Edward
himself was there present. And in y^.xviij. year of his regne at his
parlyami^t holde^ at Westmynster the auy^zeme of ^ester Edward y^ third made
Edward his first sone prince of Wales. And in y^.xix. year of his regne and^^
afteri^ Ia(...)y before lent king Edward let make full noble Iustes and great
feestes in ye place of his birth at Wyndsore / that these was never none such
seen there before. At which feast and royalte were two kings and two queen's
the prince of Wales / the duke of Eornewayle.x. earls.ix. cou^tesses / barous
and many burgeyses the which might not lightly be nombred / and of diverse
lands beyond the sea were many strangers. And at the same time when the
Iustes were done king Edward made a great souyer / in the which he ordained
and began his round table / and ordained and stedfasted the day of the round
cable to be holden there at wyndsore in the whytsonweke ever more yearly. And
in this time Englysshnten so much haunted and cleued to the woodnes and folly
of the strangers / that from time of coming of y^ Hen(...)es.xviij. year
passed they ordained and changed them every year diverse shappes and
disguisynges of clothy^g oflonge large and wide clothes destitute and deserte
from all old honest and good usage. And an othertyme short clothes and strayt
wasted iagged and kyt / and on every side slatered and botoned with sleues and
tapytes of surcotes / and hodes over long and over much hangyng yt if I the
sothe shall say they were more like to turme^tours and de uyls in their
clothing and shoynge and other array / than to men. And y^ women more nycely
yet passed the men in array and curiouslyer / for they were so strayt clothed
that they let hang fox tails sewed by uethe wtin their clothes for to hele
and hide their arses / the which disguisynges and pride perauenture afterward
brought forth and raused many myshappes and myschefe in y^ realm of England.
The.xx. year of king Edward he went over in to Brytayn and Gascoyn / in whose
company went y^ earl of warwyk / the earl of Suffolk / the earl of Huntyngton /
and the earl of Arundell / and many other lords and common people in a great
multitude / with a great navy of.CC. and.xl. ships / anon after mydsomer for
to avenge hy^ of many wrongs and harms to him done by Phylyp of Valoys king
of France against y^ trewse before hand granted / the which trewse he
falsely and untruly by cauellacyons losed and disquatte.

How king Edward sailed in to Normandy / and arrived at Hogs with a great
host.
IN the.xxi. year of his regne king Edward through counsel of all y^ great
lords of England called and gadred together in his parlyame^t at Westmynster
before eester ordained hy^ for to pass over y^ see again for to disease and
destrouble the rebels of France. And wha^ his navy was come together and made
ready he went with a great host the.xij. day of July and sailed in to Normandy /
and arrived at Hogs. And when he had rested him there.vj. days for because of
trauayling of the sea / and for to have out all his men with al their necessaries
out of their ships he went toward Cadomu^ brennynge / wasting and
destroyenge all y^ towns yt he found in his way. And the.xxvj. day of July
at y^ bridge of Cadony manly and nobly strengthed and defended with Normans he
had there a strong battle and a long during / through which a great
multitude of people were slain. And there were taken of prisoners the earl of
Ewe / the lord Tankeruyll / and an.C. of other knights and men of arms / and.
vj.C. footmen no^bred / and the town and yt subbarbes unto y^ bare wall of
all thing that they might bear and carry out was robbed and despoyled. After y^
king passed forth by the country about the bread of.xx. mile be wasted all
manner thing that he found. When Philip of Valois perceived this all though he
were fast by him with a strong host / yet he would not come nigh him / but
brake all ye brydges beyond ye water of Seyn fro Roen to Paris / and by^ self
fled unto ye same cite of Paris to all ye haste yt he might. For sothe ye
noble king Edward when be came to Paris bridge and found it broken / wtin two
days he let make it again. And on y^ morrow after the Assumpcion of our lady
king Edward passed over y^ water of Seyn going to ward the water of Cres^y
/ and destroyed by y^ way towns with the people owenynge therein. And in the
feast of saint Barthylmewe he passed over the water of So^me unhurt with all his
host there as never before had be^ any manner way ne passage / where two. M.
were slain of them that let their passage over. Therefore the.xxvj. day of
August king Edward in a field fast by Cres^y having three batayles of
Englysshmen encountered and met with Philip of Valoys having with him.iiij.
batayles / of which the leest passed greatly ye nombre of English people. And
wha^ these two hosts met together / there fell upon him the king of Beme / ye
duke of Loreyn / and earls also of Flau^dres / Dalau^son / Blois / Har court /
Aumarle and Neuers / and many other earls / barons / lords / knights and men
of arms the nombre of a. M.v.C. xlij. without footmen and other men armed yt
were nothing rekened. And for all this the vngloryous Philip wtdrew hy^ with the
resydue of his people. Wherefore it was said in common among his own people
Nr^e bell soy retreit / yt is to say / our fair wtdraweth him. Than king
Edward and our englisshmen thanked god of such a victory after their great
labor taken to them all thing nedeful to their suste nau^ce and saving of
their lives / and for dread of their enemies rested the^ there. And full erly
in the morning after the frensshmen with a great host came again for to give
battle and fight with y^ englysshmen / with whom met and encountered the
earl of warwik / Northamton and Northfolke with their company / and slew ij.
M. and took many prisoners of ye gentiles of them / and the remenau^t of the
same host fled.iij. mile thens. And the third day after ye battle ye king
went to Ca lays ward destroyenge all y^ towns as he rode thither. When he was
comen / yt is to say / the third day of September he began to besyege y^
town with the castle and continued his syege fro y^ foresaid third day of
September to y^ third day of August y^ next year after. And in y^ same year
during y^ syege of Calays y^ king of scot land with a great multitude of
scotts came in to England to Nouiles cross about saint Lukes day the
euangelyst / hopyng and trustyng for to have found all the land best ytute
and void of people / for as much as the king of Engloude was beyond ye see
/ save ouely preeste^ and men of holy church and women and children and
plowmen and such otherlabourers / and there they came and robbed and did much
preuy sorrow / but yet found they enough that wtstode them by ye grate of
almighty god. And so a day of bacayle was assygned between them and
certaynelordes and men of holy church yt were of ye cou^tres with other common
people fast by the cite of Durham / at which day through ye grace of almighty
god y^ Scotts were ouercomen / and yet were there three times so many of them
as of the englysshmen. And there was slain all the cheualry and knyghthode of
the realm of Scotlonde And there was taken as they would have fled thens Dauyd
the king of Scotlonde himself / and the earl of Mentyf / sir William Douglas /
and many other great men of Scotlonde. And after yt our Englysshmen when they
had rested them a few days and had ordained their kepers of y^ north country
/ they came to London and brought with them sir David ye king of Scotlonde and
all ye other lords yt were taken prisoners unto ye toure of London with all
the haste yt they might / and left them there in safe keeping unto the kings
coming / and went home again in to their own country. And afterward was the
kings rau^som of Scotlonde taxed to an hundred thousand mark of silver to be
paid within.x. year / yt is to say / every year.x. thousand mark.

How king Edward besyege^^ Calays / and how it was won and yielded unto him.
IN the.xxij. year of y^ regne of king Edward he went over the sea in the
winter time / and lay all the winter at the syege of Calays / the which year
while y^ syege lasted and endured / Philyp the king of France cast and
purposed tray toursly and with fraud to put away y^ syege / and came the.xxvij.
day of July in y^ same year with a great host and a strong power and nighed to
y^ syege of Calays / the which Philip the last day of July sent to king Edward
word that he would give him plain battle y^ third day after that about
euensonge time / if he durst come fro y^ syege and abide. And when king Edward
herd that / without any long taryenge or long auyseme^t accepted gladly y^
day and hour of battle yt Philip had assygned. And when ye king of France
herd yt / the next night after he set his tents a fire and remeued and went
away cowardly. Than they yt were in ye town and in ye castle besyeged seeing
all this how that they had none other help ne socour of the king of France ne
of his men / and also yt their vitayles wtin them were spended and wasted / and
for fault of vitayles and re fresshing they ete horses / hou^des / cattes and
myce for to keep their treuth as long as they might / and wha^ they saw and
was found among them at ye last yt they had no thing among them for to ete
ne live by / ne no socour nor rescowe of ye frensshe men of yt other side /
they wist well that they must needs dye for defaute / or else yield y^ town /
and anon they went and took down y^ baners and y^ arms of France on every
side yt were hangen out / and went on the walls of ye town in diverse places
as naked as they were borne / save only their shertes and their preuy clothes
and held their swerdes naked and the point downward in their hands / and put
ropes and halters about their necks / and yielded up the keys of ye town and
of the castle to king Edward of England with great fere and dread of heart.
And when king Edward saw this / as a merciable king and lord received them
all to grace / and a few of the gretest persons of estate and of governance
of the town he sent in to England there to abide their raunsom and the
kings grace. And all y^ comynalte of the town the king let go whyther they
would in peace and without any harm / and let them bear with them all their
things that they might bear and carry away / keeping the town and the castle
to himself. Than through medracion of cardinals that were sent from y^ pope
trewse was taken there between France and England for.ix. months than next
following. And about Myg^elmasse king Edward came again in to England with a
glorious victory. And in the.xxiij. year of his regne in y^ ^est parties of the
world there began a pas^ylence and death of sarasyns and pay(...) that so great
a death was never herd of before / and that wasted away the people so that
uneath the tenth person was left alive. And in the same year about y^ south
countries there fell so much rain and so great waters / that from
Chrystinasse unto mydsomer there was (...) day nor night but that it rayned
somewhat / through which waters y^ pesty lence was so enfected and so
^aboundaunt in all countries / and namely about y^ court of Rome and other
places and see costs that uneath there were left living folk for to bury
them honestly yt were deed. But made great diches and pyttes yt were wonders
broad and deep / and therein buried them and made a renge of deed bodies and
cast aly tell earth to cover them above / and than cast in an other renge of
deed bodies / and an other renge above them. And thus were they buried and none
other wise / but if it were so yt they were men of great estate so that they
were buried as honestly as they might. And after all this in the xxiiij. year
of king Edwardes regne it was done him to wit of a treason that was begone at
Calays and ordained to sell that town for a great sum of florens to king
Philip of France / through the falsnes and ordinance of a knight y^ was
called sir Geffrey of Cheruey that was wonders preuy with king Philip of France
And Wha^ king Edward herd this / he took with him y^ noblest and gentyllest
lords and many other worthy me^ of arms that were present with him for y^
solempnite of y^ high feast. And well and wisely in all the haste that he might
and as pryuely as he might he went over the sea to Calays. And y^ same year y^
good king Edward held his Chrystmasse at Hauerynge / and the morrow after new
years day y^ king was in y^ castle of Calays with his men of arms y^ none of
the alyens wist thereof. And y^ falls co^spyratour and traitor Geffrey of
Cherney sith that he might not openly have his purpose of y^ castle / pry uely
and stelingly he came and held y^ town with a great host. And when he with his
men were comen / he paid the foresaid sum of florens as covenant was to a
Genewey in y^ town y^ was keeper of the castle and consentyng to the same
Geffrey in all this falsnes and treachery / and bound y^ English mynstrels
and servants that were in y^ castle y^ they might not help themself ne let
them of their purpose. And than wenynge y^ they had been sure enough / they
spoke al their wickedness and falsnes openly on high y^ al me^ might here. And
now shall ye here how they were deceived / for they came in by a preuy posterne
over a little bridge of tree / and when they were comen in subtylly and privily
y^ bridge was drawn up and kept y^ none of them y^ came in might go out /
neno moo come in to them. And anon our English men went out at preuy holes
and wyndowes and over the walls of the town and of y^ castle and went and
faught manly with y^ frensshmen y^ were without / and had y^ better of them /
the which when they were occupied by themself on their side / the king y^ was
within the town having with him scarsly but.xxx. men of arms drew out his
sword and with a loud voice he cried on hye. A saint Edward A saint George. And
when the people herd that / they came re^nynge to him and gave to their
enemies so great assaute that there were moo than. iij.C. men of arms and many
moo other slain / and many fled away. And so by y^ grace of god the victory
fell to y^ Englysshmen. Than the king took with him this Geffrey y^ was fynder
of this treason and also many other Frensshe prisoners / and within a while
after he came again in to England. And in this same year and in the year
before / and in the year next following was so great a pestylence of men from
the eest in to the west / and namely through botches / y^ they that sekened as
on this day dyed on the third day after / to y^ which men y^ so dyed in
this pestylence had but little respyte of their lyggy^ge. Than pope Clement of
his goodness and grace gave them full remyssyon and forgyuenes of all their
sins that they were shryuen of / and this pestylence lasted in London fro
Mighelmasse unto August next following / almoost an hole year. And in these
days was death without sorrow / weddynges without frendshyp / wylfull penance
/ and derth without scarsete / and fleing without refute or socour / for many
fled from place to place because of the pestylence / but they were enfected
and might not escape y^ death / after that y^ prophet Isaie says Who that
flees fro the face of dread / he shall fall in to the dyche. And he y^ wyndeth
him out of y^ dyche / he shall be holden and tied with a grenne. But when this
pestylence was cesed as god would uneaths y^ tenth part of y^ people was left
on live. And in y^ same year began a wonders thing / that all y^ were borne
after y^ pestylence had two cheketethe in their heed less than they had before.

How king Edward had a great battle With Spanyardes in y^ see fast by
Wynchelsee.
ANd in the.xxv. year of his regne about saint John's day in harvest in y^ see
fast by Winchelsee king Edward had a great battle with men of Spain where y^
their ships and navy lay chayned together / that either they must fight or be
drowned. And so when all our Worthy men of arms and of the sea costs fast by
winchelse and Romney were gadred together / and our navy and ships all ready to
the war the Englysshmen met manly and strongly with their enemies tomynge
fyersly against them. And when y^ spaynysshe vessels and navy were closed in
all about / there might men se strong battle on both sides and long
during / in which battle was but few that faught but they were pyteously
hurt. And after y^ battle there were.xxiij. ships taken / and so the
Englysshmen had the better. And in y^ next year following of his regne / y^ is
to say the.xxvi. year the king through his counsel let ordeyn and make his
new money that is to say / the penny / the grote value of.iiij. pens / and the
half grote of.ij. pens but it was of less weight than the old sterlyng was
by.v. shyllyng in y^ pound And in the.xxvii. year of his regne was the great
derth of vytayles / the which was called y^ dear somer. And the. xxviii year
of his regne in y^ parlyame^t hoiden at westmy^ster after eester sir Henry earl
of Laucastre was made duke of Lancastre. And in this year was so great a
drought / y^ from the month of March to the month of July there fell no rain
on the earth / wherefore all fruytes / seeds and herbs for y^ most part were
lost in defaute / wherefore came so great disease of men and beestes and derth
of vitayles in england / so y^ this land y^ ever before had be^ plenteous had
need y^ time to seek vitayles and refresshyng at other out yles and countries.
And in y^.xxix. year of king Edward it was accorded / granted and sworn
between the king of France and king Edward of England y^ he should have again
all his lo^des and lordshyps y^ longed to the duchy of Guyen of old time / y^
which had been wtdrawen and wrong fully occupied by diverse kings of France
before hand to have and to hold to king Edward and to his heirs and
successors for euermo re / freely / peasybly and in good qu^ete upon this
covenant that the king of England should leave of and relese all his right and
day me that he had claymed of y^ kingdom of France / and of the tytell y^ he
took thereof upon which speech and couenau^tes is was sent to the court of
Rome on bothesydes of y^ kings / that y^ foresaid covenant should be embulled
/ but god erdeyned better for y^ kings worship of England / for what through
fraud and deceyt of y^ frensshme^ / and what through lettyng of y^ pope and of
y^ court of Rome y^ foresaid couenau^tes were disquat and left of. And in the
same year y^ king revoked by his wise and dyscrete counsel the staple of
wolles out of Flau^dres in to England with al y^ libertees frau^chises and free
customs that longed thereto / and ordained it in England in diverse places /
that is to say at Westminster / Canterbury / Chichestre / Brystow / Lyncolne
and Null With all the foresaid things y^ long thereto. And y^ this thing y^
should thus be done y^ king swore himself thereto / and prince Edward his sone /
with other many great witnesses y^ there were p^sent. And y^.xxx. yete of his
regne anon after whytsontyde in y^ parlyament ordained at Westmynster it was
told and certifyed to y^ king y^ Philip that held the kingdom of France was
deed / and that John his sone was crowned king / and that this John had given
karoll his sone y^ duchy of Guyen / of y^ which thing when king Edward wist
thereof he had great indignacion to him and was wonders wroth and strongly
meued. And therefore before al y^ worthy lords y^ were there assembled at y^
parliament he called Edward his sone unto him / to whom y^ duchy of Guyen by
right heritage should long to / and gave it hy^ there / bidding and
strengthyng him y^ he should ordeyn hy^ for to defend him / and avenge him on
his enemies / and save and maynteyn his right And afterward king Edward
himself and his eldest sone Edward went to diverse places and saints in
England on pilgrimage for to have y^ more help and grace of god and of his
saints. And y^ second kae. of July when all thing was ready to y^ viage and
batayl / and al his retynue and power assembled / and his navy also ready / he
took with him y^ earl of Warwyk / the earl of Suffolk / the earl of Salysbury /
and y^ earl of Oxford / and a. M. men of arms and as many archers / and on y^
Natiuite of our lady took their ships at Plommouth and began to sail. And
when he was arry ued in Guyen / he was there worshypfully received of the most
noble men and lords of y^ country. And anon after king Edward took with him his
two sons / y^ is to say / sir Leonell earl of Vlton / and sir John his brother
earl of Rychemonde / and sir Henry duke of Lancastre / with many earls and
lords and men of arms / and two M. archers / and sailed toward France / and
rested him a while at Calays / and afterward the king went with his folk before
said and with other soudyours of beyond the sea that there abode y^ kings
coming the second day of November and took his journey toward king John of
France there as he had trowed to have found him fast by Ddomaru^ as his
lettres and covenant made mencyon that he would abide him there with his host.
And wha^kyng John of France herd tell of the coming of y^ king of England /
he went away with his men and caryage cowardly and shamefully fleing and
wasting all vytayles y^ englysshme^ should not have there of. When king Edward
herd tell y^ he fled / he pursued him with all his host till Hedyn / and than
he beholdynge y^ scarsete and wantynge of vitayles and also y^ cowardyse of the
king of France / he returned again wasting all the country. And while all
these things were a doing the Scotts pryucly and by night took the town of
Barwyck / sleynge them that with stood them and no man else / but blyssed be god
the castle was saved and kept by englysshmen y^ were therein. When y^ king
wist of all this / he returned again in to England as wroth as he might be /
wherefore in y^ parlyament at Westmynster was granted to the king of every
sack of wolle.l. shyllynges during the term of.vi. year / y^ he might y^
might liar fight and defend the realm against the Scotts and other
mysdoers. And so when all things were ready the king hasted him toward the
syege.

accorded of.iij. millyons of floreyns for his raimsom / and the king comforted
him and chered him in all places with all solace and myrthes that longs to a
king in his going homewarde. And the.ix. day of July in y^ same year this
same John king of France y^ before lay here in hostage went home again in to
his own land to treat of those things and other y^ longed and fallen to the
governance of his realm. And afterward met and came together at Calays both
y^ two kings with both their cou^seyles about all h^ lowen tide / and there
were showed the con dicyons and the points of the peace / and of y^ accord of
both sides written / and there without ouy with saying of both sides gracyously
they were accorded / and there was done and songen a solemn mass And after

other couenau^tes y^ were between them ordained. And in this same year men /
beestes / trees and houses with sodeyn tempest and strong lightening were
perysshed / and the devil appeared bodyly in man's ly kenes to much people as
they went in diverse places in the countrees / and spoke to them in that lykenes.

How the (...) ^ ^
Bynge (...) of his regne (...) Chrystin ass in the (...) of y^ (...) saint
Paul h^lde his (...) Westmynster / in y^ which parlyament was put forth and
showed y^ accord (...) y^ treatys that was stablysshed and (...) between the
two kings / which accord, pleased to much people / and therefore ^y y^

y^ first sunday of le^t / that is to say / the second kal of February the
foresaid English men and Frenssomen / where was song a solemn mass of y^
Crinite of the arche bishop of Caunterbury master Symond Islepe. And when
Agnus dei was done the king being there with his sons and also y^ kings sons
of France and other noble and great lords with candellyght and crosses
brought forth / and all that were not sworn before / swore that same y^ was
written upon gods body and on y^ mass book in this wise. We N. and N. swear
upon gods body and on y^ holy gospelles steadfastly to hold and keep toward
us the peace and the accord made between y^ two kings and never for to do y^
contrary. And when they had thus sworn / they took their crosses y^ their
oaths were compre he^ded in to y^ notaryes. And this same year it fort(...)
upon the A^ce^cyon even about mydday was seen y^ eclypse of the (...) / and
there followed such a drought / that for defaut of^ayne there was great
br^nnynge ofcor^e fruit and (...). And in the same month the.vj. (...) of
June there fell a sanguyne rayn^ almoost like blood at Burgoyne. And a sanguyne
cross from morrow unto pryme appeared and was seen at Boloyn in the ^yre / the
which many men saw / and after it meued and fell in y^ mids of the sea. And
in the same time in France and England and many other lands as they that
were in plain countries and desert bare wytnes suddenly there appeared two
castles / of y^ which went out two hosts of armed men. And that one host
was clothed in white / and that other in black / and when battle between them
was begone / the white overcame the black / and anon after the black took
heart to them and overcame the white / and after that they went again i to
their castles / and than y^ castles and all the host vanysshed away. And in
the same year there was a great and an huge pestilence of people and namely of
men whose wives as women out of governance took husbands as well strangers
as other lewd and simple people / y^ which forgetynge their honor and
worship and birth coupled and married them with them y^ were of low degree and
little reputacyon. In this same year died Henry duke of Lancastre / and also in
this year Edward prince of Wales wedded the countess of Ke^t y^ was sir
Thomas wife of Holand the which was departed sometime and de uorced fro y^ earl
of Salysbury for cause of y^ falls knight. And about this time began and rose a
great company of diverse na cyo^s gadred togider / whose leders were Englysshmen
without any heed / y^ which did much harm in y^ party of France. And not
long after there arose an other company of diverse nations / y^ was called the
white company y^ which in y^ parties of Lombardy did much sorrow. The same
year sir John of Gaunt the sone of king Edward y^ third was made duke of
Lancastre by reason and cause of his wife that was the daughter and heir of
Henry sometime duke of Lancastre.

Of the great wind / and how prince Edward took the lordshyp of Guyen of his
fader / and went thither.
AAd in the.xxxvij. year of king Edward the.xv. day of Ianyuer that is to say
/ on saint Mauryce day about euensongtyme there arose and came such a wind
out of y^ south with such a fyersnes and strength that it brast and blewe down
to y^ ground high houses and strong buyldynges / toures / chirches and
steples and other strong places / and all other strong works y^ stood still
were shaken therwt that they ben yet and shall evermore be the febler and
weyker while they stand. And this wind lasted without any ^^ssyng. vu days
continually. And anon after there followed such water in hey time and in y^
harvest time that al field works were greatly let and left undone. And in
the same year prince Edward took y^ lordshyp of Guyen / and did to king
Edward his fader homage and fraute thereof / and went over see in to Gascoyn
with his wife and children. And anon after king Edward made sir Leonell his
sone duke of Clarence / and sir Edmonde his other sone earl of Cambrydge. And
in y^. xxxvii^. year of his regne it was ordained in the parlyament that men of
law both of y^ church and te^porall law should fro y^ time forth plete in
their mother tongue. And in y^ same year came in to England three kings / y^ is
to say / y^ king of France y^ king of Cypres / and y^ king of Sectionde
because to visyte and to speak with the king of England. And after they had be^
here long time / two of them went home in to their own countries and
kingdoms / but the king of France through great sekenes and malady that he
had abode still in England. And in y^.xxxix. year of his regne was a strong
and great frost / and that lasted long / that is to say fro say^^ Andrews
tide to the.xiiij. kal. of Apryll y^ the tylthe and sowynge of the earth and
other such field work and hand works were much let and left undone for
cold and hardness of y^ earth. And at Drray in Brytayn was ordained a great
deedly battle between sir John of Mou^ford duke of Britayn and sir Charles of
Bloys / but y^ victory fell to the foresaid sir John through help and socour
of y^ englysshmen / and there were taken many knights and squyers and other
men y^ were vnnombred / in y^ which battle was slain Charles himself with
all y^ stood about him / and of y^ Englysshmen were slain but.vii. And in this
year dyed at ye Sauoy John y^ king of France / whose service and exequyes
king Edward let ordeyn and did in diverse places worshypfully to be done / and
at Dover ordained him worthily to be led with his own costs and expenses /
and fro thens he was fet in to France / and buried at saint Denis. In y^.xl.
year of king Edward the.vij. kal. of Feueryer was borne Edward prince Edwardes
sone / the which wha^ he was.vii. year of age dyed. And in the same year it
was ordained y^ saint Peter's pens fro y^ time forth should not be paid / y^
which king yuo sometime king of England of y^ country of westsaxons / y^ began
to regne the year of our lord god.vi. C.lxxix. first granted to Rome for y^
scole of England there to be co^tynued. And in this same year fell so much
rain in hey time ye it wasted and destroyed both corn and hey. And there was
such debate and fyghtyng of sparowes by diverse places in these days / y^ men
found innumerable deed in y^ feldes as they went. And there fell also such a
pestylence / y^ never was seen such in no man's days y^ than lived / for men
ye went to bed hole and sou^de / suddenly they dyed. Also ye time a sekenes
that men call y^ pockes slew both men and women through their enfectyng. And
in the.xli. year of king Edward was borne at Burdeux Rychard the second sone
of prince Edward of England / y^ which Rychard king Richard of Amorican
heued at the fontstone / after whom he was called Rychard. And this same
Rychard when his fader was deed and king Edward also / he was crowned king of
England the.xl. year of his age through right line and heritage / and also by
y^ common assent and desire of the comynalte of the realm. About this time at
king Edwardes commandment of England when all the castles and towns were
yielded to him y^ were holden in France by a great company assembled together
sir Bartram Claykyn a noble knight and a good warryour went and purposed hy^ to
put Piers king of Spain out of his kingdom with help of y^ most party of
y^ foresaid great company / trusting also upon help and favor of y^ pope /
for as much as it came to his ere y^ the same Pyers should led and use a
sinful life / y^ which Piers smytte^ with dread of these tidings fled in to
Gascoyn to prince Edward for to have socour of him. And when he was fled out
of Spain / Henry his brother that was a bastard by assent of y^ most party of
Spain / and through help of y^ ferefull company y^ I spoke of first was
crowned king of Spain / and the no^bre of that same company was rekened and
set at the nombre of.lx. M. fighting men. This same year in y^ month of June
there came a great company and a navy of Danes / and gadred them together in the
north see / purposyng to come in to England to reave and rob and also to slay
with whom they encou^tred and met in y^ see. Maryners and other good
fyghtyng men of the country dysperpled them. And they ashamed went home again
in to their own country / but among all other there was a buistous vessel and
a strong of their navy yt was ouersayled by the Englysshmen and was perysshed
and drowned / in the which ye steward and other great men of De^marke were
taken prisoners / and ye king of England and his counsel prisoned them the
which lords ye Danes afterward came and sought all about for to have had
them again with their goods yt they had lost / and they not well ap^yed ne
pleased of the answer yt they had there / returned home wards again / leuynge
behind them in their Innes pryuely written in scrowes and on walls. Yet shall
Danes waste y^ wanes. Than happed there an English writer and wrote against
the Dane in this manner. Here shall Danes fette their banes. This time Pyers
king of Spain with other kings / yt is to say / the king of Nauerne and the
king of Malog^^ being means went between and prayed couseyle and help of sir
Edward the prince / through whose counsel wha^ he had understand their
artycles and desire yt he was required of ye kings / loath he was and ashamed
to say nay and contrary them / but nevertheless he was aghast lest it should be
any preiudyce against ye pope and long time tarried them or yt he would grant
or consent thereto / till he had better counsel and auyseme^t with good
deliberacyo^ of king Edward his fader. But when he was with every days and
co^tynuall besechyng of many noble men required and spoken to / and with many
prayers sent and made between them. Than prince Edward sent to his fader both
by complaynyng lettres and also by comfortable co^teynyng all their suggestions
and causes with all ye other kings epystles and lettres for to have comfort and
help of ye wrongs not only done to ye king of Spain but also for such
things as might fall to other kings Also if it were not the sooner helped and
amended through ye dome and help of knight hode to them yt it as^ed and
desired. The which lettre wha^ ye king and his counsel had seen such a
kings spoylyng and robbyng with much marvel / and sent again comfortable
lettres to prince Edward his sone and to ye other foresaid kings / and warned
them to arm and ordeyne the^ against that mysdoer / and to ^^stande them by
the help of god that were such enemies to kings. When this noble prince had
received these lettres himself with ye other kings before said all their
counsel called togider or yt he would undertake ye quarrel / he b^side and
knytte fore ye king yt was deposed with a great oath / yt is to say / yt he
should ever after maynteyn the right believe and faith of holy church / with all
their mynystres ryghtes and lybertees to defend from all their enemies and all
euyls / and all that were there against bytterly to punysshe and destrouble /
and all ye ryghtes libertees preuyleges of holy church encreace and maynteyn /
and amend all things yt be wrongfully taken (...) and borne away by him or by
other because of him hastily to restore again / and to drive and put out
s^^^syns and all other (...) people out of his kingdom with al his strength and
power / and suffer (...) admytte none such for no manner thing ne cause to
dwell therein* and yt when he had taken a chris^^ woman he should never come in to
none other woman's bedd^ / ne none other man's wife to defoule. All these
foresaid things truly to keep co^tynue and fulfill as all his lyftyme he was
bound by oath before (...) / in pres^nce and wytnes of those kings with other
dry^e^s. And than that gracyous prince Edward undertook ye cause and the
quarrel of ye king yt was deposed / and behyght him with the grace of almighty
god to restore him again to his kingdom / and let ordeyn and gadre together
forthwt in all haste his navy with men of arms for to war and fight in his
foresaid cause. And in this time upon sand of the scotts see that many a man
it saw three days together there were seen two Egles / of the which y^ one
came out of y^ south / and y^ other out of y^ north / and cruelly and strongly
they fought and wrastled together / and the south Egle first overcame the north
Egle and al to rent him with his byll and his claws that he should not rest ne
take no breath. And after the south Egle slew home to his own costs. And anon
after there followed and was seen on the morrow before y^ son rysyng and after
in y^ last day of October save one day many sterres gadred together on
a(...)epe fell down to y^ earth / leuynge behind them fyry bemes in manner of
lightnynge / whose flambes brent and consumed men's clothes and men's here
walkyng on y^ earth as it was seen and known of many a man. And yet y^
northeren wind y^ is ever ready and destynate to all ill fro saint Katherynes
even till.iij. days after lost great good without no^bre unrecoverable. And i y^
same days there fell and came also such lyghtnynge thonder / snow and hayle /
that it wasted and destroyed men / beestes / houses and trees.

Of the battle of Spain beside the water of Nazers ye was between prince
Edward and sir Henry bastard of spain.
IN the year of our lord a. M. CCC lxvij. and of king Edward.xlij. the third
day of Apryll there was a strong battle and a great in a large field called
Priazers fast by the water of Nazers in Spain between sir Edward y^ prince and
sir Henry of Spain / but the vyctory fell to prince Edward by y^ grate of god.
And this same prince Edward had with him sir John duke of Lancaster his brother /
and other worthy men of arms about the nombre of.xxx. M. And y^ king of Spain
had on his side men of diverse nacyons to y^ nombre of an hundred thousand and
moo / wherefore the sharpenes and fyersnes of his adversary with his full
buystous and great strength made and drove the ryghtfull party abacke a great
way / but through y^ grace of god almighty passing any manes strength that
great host was disparpled might fully by y^ noble duke of Lancastre and his
boost or that prince Edward came nygh him. And when Henry bastard saw that /
he turned with his men in so great haste and strength to flee / that a great
company of them in the foresaid flode and of the bridge thereof fell down and
perysshed. And also there were taken the earl of Dene and sir Bartram Cleykyn
that was chief maker and causer of the war and also cheftayne of the
vauntward of the battle with many other great lords and knights to the
nombre of two thousand / of whom two hundred were of France / and many also
of Scotlo^de. And there were felled in the field on our enemies side of lords
and knights with other people to the nombre of vi. M. and moo / and of
English men but a few. And after this y^ noble prince Edward restored y^
same Pyers to his kingdom again / the which Pyers afterward through treachery
and falsnes of y^ foresaid bastard of spain as he sat at his meet he was
strangled and dyed. But after this vyctory many noble and hardy men of England
in Spain through the flux and diverse other sekenesses took their death. And
also in the same year in the March was seen stella cometa bitwene the north
costs and the west / whose bemes stretched toward France. And in the next
year following of king Edwardes regne.xliii. in Apryl sir Leonel king Edwardes
sone that was duke of Clarence went toward Myleyn with a chosen meyny of y^
gentyls of England for to wedde Galois daughter and have her to his wife / by
whom he should have half y^ lordshyp of Myleyn. But after y^ they were solemply
wedded / and about y^ natiuite of our lady y^ same duke of Myleyn dyed. And in
y^ same year y^ frensshe men brake y^ peace and trewse rydyng on y^ kings
ground and lordshyp of England in the shyre and country of Pou^tyfe / and
took and held castles and towns: and bare y^ englyssh men on hand falsely and
subtylly that they were cause of brekyng of y^ trewse. And in this year dyed y^
duchess of Lancaster / and is buried in saint Paul's church. The.xliiii. year
of y^ regne of king Edward was the gretest pestylence of men and of great
beestes / and by y^ great falling of waters y^ fell at y^ time / there fell
great hyndrynge and destroyenge of corn / in so much y^ the next year after
a busshell of whete was sold for.xl. pens. And in the same year about y^ last
end of May the king held his parliament at Westminstre in which parliament
was spoken of the oath and trewse y^ was broken between hy^ and the king of
France / and how he might best be avenged upon his wrong. In y^ same year on
y^ Assumpcyon of our lady dyed queen Philip of england a full noble lady and a
good woman / and at westmynster worshipfully is buried. And about myd somer the
duke of Lancastre and the earl of Herford with a great company of knights went
in to France where they gate them but little worship / for there was a great
host of the Frensshmen upon Calkhull bridge / and an other host of
englysshmen fast by y^ same bridge y^ long time had lived there / and many
worthy and great men of the englysshmen ordained and gave counsel for to
fight and give battle to the frensshmen / but y^ foresaid lords would not
consent thereto for no manner thing. Anon after it happed that the earl of
warwik came thyderward for to war And when y^ frensshmen herd of his coming
/ or that he came fully to land they left their tents (...) pauylyons with at
their vitayles and fled pryuely away. And wha^ the earl was comen to land with
his men he went in all haste toward Normandy and destroyed y^ isle of Caux with
strength of sword and through fire. But alas i^ his returning to England
again at Calays he was taken with sekenes of pest (...) and dyed / not leuyng
behind him after his days so noble a knight of arms. In which time reigned
and warred the noble knight sir John Hawkewod y^ was an englysshman borne /
having with him at his governance y^ white company before said / the which one
time against holy church / and an other time against lords warred and
ordained great batayles and (...) re in the same country he did many meruaylous
things. And about y^ (...) syon of saint Paul y^ king wha^ ^e had ended and
done y^ entering and (...) great costs and rialtees about y^ sepul(...) and
buryenge of queen Philip his wife he held a parliament at westmynster in
which parliament was asked of y^ (...) a three years dyme / y^ is to say / a
g(...) me to be paid.iii. year during. And the clergy put it of and would not
grant it unto Ester next coming / and than they granted well y^ in.iii. year
by certain terms that dyme should be paid / and also of y^ lay (...) was
a.iii. years.xv. granted to y^ king.

How sir Robert Knolles with other certain lords of the realm went over se^ in
to France / and of their governance.
ANd in the.xlv. year of king Edward in y^ beginning he w^^h unwise counsel
and indiscreet borrowed a great some of gold of y^ prelates lords /
merchants and other rich men of his realm / saying y^ it should be spent in
defendyng of holy church and of his realm. Nevertheless it pfyted no thing /
wherefore about mydsomer after he made a great host of the worthiest men of his
realm among whom were some lords / ye is to say / the lord Fitz water /
and the lord Graunson / and other worthy knights / of which knights the
king ordained sir Robert Knolles a proved knight and well assaied in deeds of
arms for to be governor / and that through his counsel all thing should be
governed and dressed. And wha^ they came in to France / as long as they
dwelled and held them hole together the frensshmen durst not fall upon them And
at ye last about ye begy^uynge of winter for envy and couetyse that was among
them and also discord / they sondred them and parted in to diverse co^panyes
unwisely and folisshly. But sir Robert Knolles and his men went and kept them
safe wtin a castle in Brytayn. And when the frensshmen saw yt our men were
divided in to diverse co^panyes and places / not holdyng ne stre^gthyng them
togider as they ought to do / they fell fyersly on our men / and for ye most
party took them or slew them / and those yt they might take led with them
prisoners. And in ye same year pope Urban came fro Rome to Auinyon because that
he should accord and make peace between ye king of France and the king of
England for evermore. But alas or he began his treatise he dyed with sekenes ye
xxj. day of December / and was buried as for ye time in ye cathedral church of
Auin yon fast by the hye awter. And the next year after wha^ he had lain so
his bones were taken out of ye earth and buried new in ye abbey of saint
Victory fast by Mar cile / of ye which abbey he was sometime abbot himself. And
in both places yt he was buried in there be many great miracles done and
wrought through ye grace of god to many a man's help and to ye worship of
almighty god. After whom followed next and was made pope Gregory cardynall
deken / that before was called Piers Roger. In this same year ye cite of Lymoge
rebelled and faught against ye pryuce as other cytees did in Guyen for great
taxes / costages / and rau^soms yt they were put and set to by pry^ce Edward /
which charges were importable and chargeable / wherefore they turned fro him
and fell to ye king of France. And when prince Edward saw this: he was sore
chafed and grieved / and in turnyng homeward again in to England with sore
scarmysshes and fyghtyng and great assautes fought with them / and took ye
foresaid cite and destroyed it almoost to ye ground / and slew all that were
found in ye cite. And tha^ for to say ye sothe for diverse sekenes and maladyes
yt he had and also for defaute of money yt he might not withstand ne tarry on
his enemies he hyed him again in to England with his wife and meyny / leuyng
behind him in Gascoyn the duke of Lancastre and sir Edmond earl of Cambridge
with other worthy and noble men of arms. In the.xlvj. year of king Edward at the
ordinance and sendyng of king Edward / the king of Nauerne came to him to
Claringdon to treat with him of certain things touthynge his war in Normandy
/ where king Edward had left certain lyeges in his stedetyl he came again. But
king Edward might not speed of that that he asked him. And so ye king of
Nauerne with great worship and great gifts took his leave and went home again.
And about the beginning of March when the parliament at Westmynster was begone
the^ king asked of the clergy a subsydy of.l. M. pound / ye which by a good
auysement and by a general conuocacyon of the clergy it was granted and
ordained that it should be paid and raised of the lay fee. And in this
parlyament at ye request and asking of the lords in hatred of men of holy
church / the chaunceler and the tresourer that were bishops / and the clerk
of the preuy seal were remeued and put out of their office / and in their
stead were seculer men put in. And while this parlyament lasted there came
solemn embassatours fro ye pope to treat with the king of peace / and said
yt the pope desired to fulfill his predecessors will / but for all their
coming they spedde not.

Of the besyegynge of Rochell / and how the earl of Penbroke and his company
was there taken in ye haven with Spanyardes and all his ships brent.
^He.ix. day of June king Edward in ye.xlvij. year of his regne held his
parlyame^t at Wynchestre / and it lasted but.viij. days / to which parlyament
were sompned by write of men of holy church.iiij. bishops and.iiij. abbots
without any moo. This parlyament was holden for merchants of London / of Nor
wyche / and of other diverse places in diverse things and points of treason yt
they were defamed of / yt is to say / that they were rebel and would arise
against ye king This same year ye duke of Lancaster and the earl of Cambrydge
his brother came out of Gascoyne in to England / and took and wedded to their
wives Peter's daughters sometime king of Spain / of which two daughters ye duke
had yt elder / and the earl ye younger. And yt same time there were sent two
cardynals fro ye pope / yt is to say an English cardinal and a cardynall of
Paris to treat of peace between these two realms / which when they had been
both long each in his prouynce and countries fast by tretynge of the foresaid
peace / at y^ last they took with them ye lettres of procuracy and went again to
Rome without any effect of their purpose. In this year there was a strong
battle on ye see between Englysshmen and Flemynges / and the Englisshmen had
the victory / and took xxv. ships with salt / and s^eynge and drownyng all ye
men yt were therein vnwyting them yt they were of ye country / and much harm
should have fallen thereof had not peace and accord soon be made between them.
This year ye frensshmen besyeged ye town of Rochell / wherefore ye earl of
Penbroke was sent in to Gascoyn with a great company of men of arms for to
destroy y^ syege which passed ye see and came safe to ye haven of Rochell /
and when they were there at ye havens mouth or yt they might enter / suddenly
came upon them a strong navy of Spanyerdes which overcame ye Englysshmen in
much blemysshynge / hurtyng and sleynge of many people / for as much as ye
Englysshmen were not than ready for to fight ne warned of the^. And as ye
Spanyerdes came upon them all the Englysshmen either they were taken or slain
/ and. r. of them were sore wounded to the doth^ and al the^r ships brent /
and there they took ye earl with a great tresour of the realm of Eng(...) and
many other noble men also on my(...) mer even ye which is sa^t Etheldredes day
/ and led them with them in to Spayn^ And of this myschefe was no great w(...)
der / for this earl was a full (...) l^uer as an open lechour. And also in a
certa^^e parlyament he stood and was against the ryghtes and frau^chyses of
holy church and also he cou^seyled ye king and his co(...) that they should
ask more of men of holy church than other persons of the lay fee. And for
the king and other men of his counseyle accepted and took rather evil
opynyons and causes against men of holy church than he did for to defend and
maynteyne the right of holy church, ^t was after seen many times for lack of
fortune and grace they had not so great victory ne power against their enemies
as they did before. This same year ye king with a great host entered the sea to
remeue the syege of Rochell / but ye wind was ever contrary to him / and
suffered hy^ not long time to go far fro the land / wherefore he abode a
certain time upon ye see costs abiding after a good wind and yet came it not.
So at the last he came thens with his men to lonoward again / and anon as he was
on lord ye wy^de turned and was in an other cost tha^ it was before.

How the duke of Lancastre with a great host went in to Flaundres and passed by
Paris through Burgoyn and through all France till he came to Burdeux.
Soon after in the.xlviij. year of ye regne of king Edward the duke of
Lancastre with a great power went in to Flau^dres and passed by Paris through
Burgoyn and through all France till he came to Burdeux without any manner with
standing of ye frensshmen / and he did them but little harm / save he took and
rau^soned many places and towns and many men: and after let them go freely. The
same year ye king sent certain embassatours to the pope / prayenge him yt he
should leave of and not meddle in his court of the kepynges and reseruacyons of
benefyces in England and yt those yt were chosen to bishops sees and
dignitees freely and with full might joy and have and be confermed to ye same
of their metropolytans and archebisshops as they were wont to be of old time.
Of these points and of other touching ye king and his realm / wha^ they had
their answer of the pope / the pope enjoined them yt they should certyfy him
again by their lettre of ye kings will and of his realm or they determined
ought of ye foresaid articles In this same year dyed John ye archebysshop of
York / John bishop of Ely / William bishop of worcestre / in whose stedes
followed and were made bishops by auctorite of ye pope / master Alexander
Neuyll to the archebysshopryche of York / Thomas of Arundell to the
bysshopryche of Ely / and sir Henry wakefelde to ye bysshopryche of worcestre.
In ye which time it was ordained in ye parlyament that all cathedral chirches
should joy and have their eleccyons hole / and that ye king fro yt time
afterward should not write against them yt were chosen / but rather help them
by his lettres to their co^fyrmacyon. This statute did much profit And in
this parliament was granted to the king a dyme of the clergy and a.xv. of lay
fee. In the.xlix. year of king Edward dyed master Willyam wytlesey
archebysshop of Caunterbury / and the monks of ye same church asked and
desired a Cardynall of England to be archebysshop / and therefore ye king was
agreued and purposed to have exiled ye monks of ye same house. And they spent
much good or they might have the kings grace and his love again / but yet
would ye king not consent to their eleccyon of ye cardinal / ne of ye pope also
ne his cardynals. And at ye beginning of August it was treated and spoken at
Bruges of certain points and artycles hangyng between ye pope and the king of
England / and this treatise lasted almoost two year. At yt last it was
accorded between them yt the pope fro ye time forth should not use ne dele with
ye reseruacyons of benefyces in England and that ye king should not grant ne
let no benefyces by his write that is called Quare impedit. But as touching
the eleccyon abouesayd there was no thing touched ne done. And that was wyted
and put upon certain clerks the which rather supposed and hoped to be
auaunced and promoted to bysshopryches which they desired and coueyted by the
court of Rome rather tha^ by any other eleccions. This same year about
Candelmasse there met together at Bruges many noble and worthy men of both
sides and realms to treat of peace between the two kings. And this treatise
lasted.ij. year with great costs and large expenses of both parties. And at ye
last they went and departed thens without any accord or effect. The next year
after the.l. year of king Edward / the.iiij. non^. of May being yet void
and vacaunt ye archebysshopryche of Canterbury master Symond sudbery bishop
of London was made archebysshop: and master William Courtney that was bishop
of Herford was than made bishop of London / and ye bishop of Bangor was made
bishop of Herford. And this same time in a certain treatise and spekyng of
peace trewse was taken between England and France fro mydsomer to the next
mydsomer after. And about ye beginning of Apryll ye duke of Brytayne with many
earls / barons and worthy lords and men of England went over see in to
Britayne where he had all his lust / desire and purpose ne had ye foresaid
trewse ben so soon taken which let them. This same time ye isle of
Co^stantyne where yt the castle of saint Savior is in / yt long time was
fought at / and besyeged of the frensshmen was than yolden to them with all the
appertenau^ces / to great harm and hyndrynge of ye realm of England. And this
same year there were so great and so passing betes and therwtall a great
pestylence in England and in other diverse parties of the world yt it
destroyed and sewe violently and strongly both men and women without no^bre.
This same year dyed sir Edward y^ lord spencer a worthy knight and a bold /
and in ye mynster of Teukesbury worshipfully is buried. And lasty^g this
pestilence ye pope at ye instaunce and prayer of an english Cardynall
granted to all people yt dyed in England yt were sorry and repentau^t for
their sins and also shryu^ full remyssyon by two bulls under led vj.
months tha^ next to last. In this same year ye earl of Penbroke was taken and
rau^soned by B^^t^am Claykyn between Paris and Calays as he came toward England
upon saint Etheldredes day / the which saint as it was said ye earl
oftentimes had offended / and within a little while after he dyed. And in
Noue^ber next after there met at Bruges the duke of Lancastre and ye duke of
Angeo with many other lords and prelates of both realms for to treat of
peace.

Of the death of prince Edward / and of the lord Latimer and dame Alyce Pe^s
through whom and her maynteyners the realm many a day was mysgouerned.
NOt long after the.lj. year of king Edwardes regne he let ordeyn and hold at
Westmynster the gretest parliament yt was seen many a year before. In the which
parlyament he asked of the comynalte of ye realm as he had done before a great
subsidy to be granted to him for defendyng of him and his realm. But the
comyns answered ye they were so of^ day by day grieved and charged with so many
talages and subsidyes yt they might no longer suffer such burdens and charges
/ and ye they knew and wist well enough that ye king had enough for saving of
him and his realm / if ye realm were well and truly governed / but ye it had been so long (...) governed by ill offyeers / that ye ^ea^me might neither be
plenteous of chafer and marchau^dyse ne also with richesse. And in these things
they profred themself / if the king would certainly to pre(...) and standeby.
And if it were found and preued afterward that ye king had need / they would
gladly every man after his power and state him help and l^ne. And after this
were publysshed and showed in ye parlyame^t many playntes and defa^^es of
diverse officers of y^ realm / and namely of the lord Larimer the kings
chamberlayn both to y^ king and oak to the realm And also at the last there
was spoken and treated of dame Alyce Pers for the great wro^ges and evil
governance y^ was done by her counsel in y^ realm / the which dame Alyce
Pers the king had holden long time to his lemman / wherefore it was the less
wonder though through y^ fraylte of y^ woman's excityng and her sterynge he
consented to her lewdnes and evil counsel / the which dame Alyce and also
y^ lord Larimer and other such y^ meued the king to evil governance
against his profit and the realm also / al y^ comynalte asked and desired y^
they should be remeued and put away / and in their stedes wise men and worthy
that were true and well assayed and proved / and of good governance should be
put in their stedes. So among al other there was one among the comyns that was
a wise knight and true and an eloquent man / whose name was Piers de la mare
And this Piers was chosen to be spekee for the comyns in y^ parlyament. And for
this same Pyers told and publysshed the troth and rehearsed the wrongs
against the foresaid dame Alyce and other certain persons of y^ ky^ges
counsel as he was bydden by the comyns / and also trusting much to be
supported and maynteyned in this matter by help and favor of y^ prince anon
as y^ prince was deed / at the instau^ce and request of y^ foresaid dame Alyce
this Piers de la mare was judged to perpetual prison in y^ castle of Notyngham
in y^ which he was.ij. year. And in y^. vj kal. of July lastyng y^ same
parlyament dyed prince Edward king Edwardes first sone / y^ is to say / on
trinite sunday in worship of which feast he was wont every year where y^ ever
he were in the world to hold and make y^ most sole^pnite that he might /
whose name and fortune of knyghthode (but if it had be^ of another Hector) all
men both christen and hethen while y^ he lived and was in good point wondered
much and drad hy^ wonders sore whose body is worshypfully buried in
Chrystchirche at Canterbury. And in this same year y^ men and y^ earls
tenau^tes of warwik arose malycyously against y^ abbot and coue^t of Euesham
and their tenau^ces / and destroyed y^ abbey and y^ town / and wounded and bet
their me^ and slew many of them and went to their manner places and did much
harm / and brake down their parkes and closes and slew their wyld beestes
and chaced them / brekyng their fyssh pondes he des / and let y^ water of their
po^des stews and ryuers ren out and took y^ fysshe and bare it with them / and
did them all y^ sorrow y^ they might / so ferforth y^ they had destroyed
perpetually y^ abbey with al theyrme^bres and appertenau^ces but if the king y^
sooner had not holp^^ it and taken head therte / and therefore y^ king sent his
lettres to y^ earl of warwik / chatgyng and co^mau^dyng hy^ y^ he should siynt
redress and amend those evil boers and brekers of his peace / and so by means
oflordes and other friends y^ peace was made between them / and for this hur
lyng as it was said y^ king would not be governed at y^ time by his lords y^
there were in y^ parliament / but he took and made his sone the duke of
Lancaster his governor of y^ realm / the which stood so still as governor
till y^ time that he dyed. The same year after Candelmas or y^ parlyament was
done the king asked a subsydy of y^ clergy and of y^ lay le / and it was
granted him / y^ is to say y^ he should have of every person of y^ lay le /
both man and woman that passed.xiiij. year of age. iiij pens / out take poor
beggars that were known openly for nedy poor beggars. And that he should have
of every man of holy thirche y^ was benefyced or promoted.xij. pens / and all
other y^ were not proted. iiij. pens / out take the.iiij. ordres of the freres
beggars. This same year after Mighelmasse Rychard prince Edwardes sone was made
pry^ce of Wales to whom y^ king gave also the duchy of Cornewayle with the
erledome of Chestre. And about this time the Cardynall of England the fourth
day before Mary Mawdeleyns day after dinner sodeinly was stryken with a palsy
and lost his speech and on Mary Mawdeleyns day dyed.

Of the death of king Edward / and how sir John Monsterwarth knight was drawn
and hanged for his falsnes.
BYght anon after i^ the.lij. year of king Edward in the begy^nynge of October
po^pe Gregory y^.xj. brought and remeued his court with him from Auinyon to
Rome. And the.xij. day of Apryll John Monsterwarth knight at London was drawn
and hanged and than quartred and sent to four chief towns of England / and
his heed smitte^ of and set upon London bridge. For this John was full untrue
to y^ king and to the realm and covetous and unstable / for he took oftentimes
great so^mes of money of the king and his counseyle for men of arms wages that
he should have paid them / and took it to his own use / and he drad that at
y^ last he should be shent and accused for y^ same cause and fled pryuely to
y^ king of France / and was sworn to him and became his man and behyght him
a great navy out of Spain to co^fusyon and destroyenge of England. But y^
ryghtfull god to whom no preuite is unknown / suffered hy^ first to be shent
and spylte or y^ he so traytoursly and falsely betrayed his lyege lord y^ king
of England and his people in his realm / in the which ground this same John
was borne / and wyckedly through battle destroyed or he brought about his
cursed purpose. In y^ feast of saint Gregory next after king Edward gave to
Richard of Burdeux his heir that was prince Edwardes sone at Wyndsore the
order of knyghthode and made hy^ knight / the which king Edward when he had
reigned.lj. year and more / y^.xj. kal. of June he dyed at Shene / and is buried
worship fully at westmy^ster / on whose soul god have mercy. This king Edward
was forsothe of a passing goodness and full gracyous among all the worthy men of
the world / for he passed and shone by virtue of grace given to him from god
above all his p^decessours y^ were noble men and worthy and he was a well
herted man and an hardy for he drad never no myshappes ne barmes ne evil
fortune y^ might fall a noble warryour and a fortunate / for both on lord and
see and in all batayles and assembles with a passing glory and joy he had y^
victory / he was meke / benign / homely / sobre and soft to al men as well to
strangers as to his own subjects and to other y^ were under his governance /
he was devout and holy both to god and holy church / for he worshipped help
and maynteyned holy chirch and their mynistres with al manner reverence / he was
tree table and well auysed in re^porall and worldly needs / wise i^ counsel /
and discrece and meke to speak with / i^ his deeds and manners ge^tyl and well
taught / hauy^g pite on them y^ were in disease / plenteous in gyuyng e^
benefaytes and alms / besy and curyous in buylding / and lightly he bare and
suffered wro^ges and harms / and when he was given to any occupacyo^ he left
all other things for y^ time and tended thereto / semely of body and a mean
stature / having always to high and to low a good chere. And there spro^ge and
shone so much grace of him y^ what man had behold his face / or had dremed of
hy^ he hoped y^ day y^ al thing should hap to him joyful and lykyng. And he
governed his kingdom gloriously unto his age / he was large in gyuyng and wise
in expe^ces he was fulfilled with all honest of good manners and virtues / under
whom to live it was as for to regne / wherefore his fame and his loos spronge so
far y^ it came in to hethynnesse and Barbary / showing and telling his
worthynes and manhood in all lands / and y^ no land under heaven had brought
forth so noble a king / so gentle and so blissed / or might reyse such
another wha^ he was deed. Nevertheless lechery and meuynge of his flesh
hau^ted him in his age / wherefore the rather as it is to suppose for
vumesurable fulfyllynge of his lust his life shorted the sooner. And hereof
take good head like as his deeds bears wytnes / for as in his begy^nyng all
things were Joyful and lykyng to him and to all people. And in his myddle age
he passed all people in high Joy / worship and blyssednes. Right so when he
drew in to age drawyng downward through lechery and other sins little and
little all those Joyful and blyssed things and prosperyte decreased and
myshapped / and unfortunate things and unprofitable harms with many euyls
began for to spring / and the more harm is / it continued long time after.

CLemens y^ syxth was pope after Benedict.x. year. This man in name and deed
was virtuous / and many things y^ Benedict was rigous in / he made easy / and
certain that he depryued he restored / and the rygousnes of y^ faith of
Benedict was laudable / but much more laudable was y^ mekenes of Clement. This
man was a noble prechour / and many sermons he gadred / and let no man pass
from him but he gave him good counsel / and decessed a blissed man. Karolus
y^.iiij. was emperor after Lodewyk.xxxj. year. This man was king of Beme a
wise man and a mighty / and this man was chosen emperor by y^ commandment of
Clement Lodewyk being alive in his contemacy / and because he asked mekely the
popes blessing and to be crowned of him / as other good kings did / therefore
he was protected of god / and prevailed over al his enemies / and many
favorable laws he made to spirytuall men / the which yet are called Karolma.
At y^ last he decessed a rich man in virtue and goods. Inno centius the.vj.
was pope after Clement x. year / and he was a great lover of relygyous men /
and he founded a monastery in France of y^ order of Cartusiens / and was a
great canonyst. Vrbanus the.v. was pope after Innocent. This man was abbot of
Missolens of y^ order of saint Benet a doctor / and is taken for a saint. He
made the cross to be preched against y^ turks And he made a passage to y^
turks. And to him saint Brigyt was sent from Christ for the co^firmacyon of
their rule / and than he was poisoned and decessed. Gregory the.xj. was pope
after him.viij. year. This Gregory did little / and after him followed y^
tribulacyon y^ our lord showed to saint Brigit for the sin of y^ clergy.
Wenselans sone to Karolus aforesaid was emperor.xiiij. year / and he was a
child / and was chosen when his fader was on live / but he took no keep of the
empire. And wha^ he was warned many times to take heed unto it and would not /
he was deposed. For he gave all his delight and lust unto lechery / and the end
was without honor / for he went greatly from the manners and the virtues of his
noble fader. And he was crowned with the imperyall dyademe / and the wisdom of
his fader passed in to Sygysmu^d his brother / as after it shall appear. Vrbanus
was pope after Gregory.vj. year. This Urban was chosen in the Cite of Rome by
strength of y^ Romans / but y^ cardynals did that for dread and not wyllyngly
/ wherefore they fled to y^ Cite of Fu^doru^. And they said that he was not
pope / and chose in his place sir Roberte of Gebennys the same year / which
was called Clement the.vij. Nota. And here began the.xxij. stryte in the
church And it was more worse than ever was any other before. For it was so
subtle / y^ the wysest men that were and the best conscyenced could not
discern with whom it was best to say and hold. And this strife dured.xl.
year with a great sclaundre unto all the clergy / and great peril unto men's
souls for heresies and other evil things y^ which were brought in than In so
much that there was no doctrine in the church for mysdoynge. And therefore
from this Urban the.vij. unto Martyn I know not who was pope. The feast of the
vysytacyon of our lady was ordained by Urban the.vj. after y^ form of the
sacrament of the awte^ for a peace and an unite for to be had among them
through the merytes of our blissed lady. Bonifacius the.ix. was pope after
Urban.xv. year. This Bonyface was chosen at Rome in the stead of Urban / and
the strife continued / for Benedictus was chosen in Auinyon in y^ place of
Clement and was called Petrus deluna / and he duced to the counsel of
Constantyneys / and than he would not obey / but ever abode obstynate. And at
y^ last he decessed in the kingdom of Aragon. And he co^inau^ded his cardynals
to chose an other pope / the which they did anon. And they set up an ydoll
and named him Clement / but they profyted not.

Circa amiu^ dn^i. M.CCC.lxxx.
And after king Edward the third that was borne at wyndsore reigned Rychard of
Butdeux that was prince Edwardes sone of Wales / which prince Edward was king
Edwardes sone.

ANd after y^ good king Edward the third y^ was borne at wynd sore reigned
Rychard y^ second that was the good sir Edwardes sone prince of Wales / the
which king Rychard was borne in the cite of Burdeux in Gascoyn and was crowned
at Westmynster in y^ xj. year of his age. And in y^ second year of his regne
for y^ debate y^ was between the lord Latymer and sir Raufe Feryecs knight
that were against Hawell and Shakell squyers / for y^ prisoner y^ was taken in
Spain by these two squyers / the which prisoner the lord Latimer and sir
Raufe Feryers would have had / the which prisoner was the erie of Dene that
they took in the battle of Spain wherefore these two lords came in to the
church at Westmynstre / and found this one squire heryng a mass beside saint
Edwardes shryne / and there they slew him the which was called Hawell / and
Shakell was arested and put in to y^ toure of London / and there he was long
time for he would not deliver the crle of Dene his prisoner unto these two
lords by sir Aleyn Buxhyll constable of the toure / and by sir Raufe Feriers
one of his adversaries / till the king had granted him grace. In the third
year of king Rychard came the Galays of France in to England unto diverse
ports / and brent and robbed and slew much people of England that is to
say / at Wynchelsee / Rye / and Hastynges / Portesmouth / Ha^ton / Scor more
and Grauesend / and they did much harm and went home again. And in this same
year was a parliament holden at Westmynster / and at that same parlyament was
ordained that every man woman and child that were of the age of xiiij. year
and above throughout all the realm poor folk and other should pay to the
tallage.iiij. pens. Wherefore came and befell afterward great myschefe and
mothe disease to all the comynalte of the realm. And in the.iiij. year of king
Ry chardes regue ye comyns arose up in diverse parties of the realm / and did
much harm / the which time they called the hurlyng time. And they of Kent
and of Essex made them two chefetaynes for to rule and gouerue the company of
Kent and of Essex / that one was called Jack straw and that other Watte Tyler
/ and they came and assembled them upon black heth in Kent. And on Corpus
Christi day after they came down in to South work / and brake up the prison
house / that is to say the kings benche and the Marchalsee / and delivered out
all the prisoners. And so the same day they came in to London and there they
robbed the people / and slew all the alyens that they might find in the cite
and about the cite / and despoyled all their goods and made hauoke. And on
the frydaye next following that was in the morning they came to the toure of
London / and the king being therein they fette out of ye toure the archebisshop
of Caunterbury sir Edmond Sudbery and sir Robert Halys hospitaler pryour and
master of saint John's house / and a white friar that was confessor unto king
Rychard / and brought them to the toure hill / and there they smote of their
heedes / and came again to London and slew much people of the cite. And than
they went unto the dukes place of Lancastre beyond saint Mary of ye stronde
that was called the Sauoy / and there they devoured and destroyed all the goods
that they might find therein / and bare them away / and than brent up the
place. And than afterward they went to saint John's without Smythfelde and there
they destroyed all the goods and brent up that house. And after they went to
Westmynster and to saint Martyns the grau^de / and made them to go out of the
sentwary all that were within for any manner of gylt. And than they came unto
the temple and to all the other Innes of men of law / and despoyled them and
robbed them of their goods / and also took their books of law. And than they
came to London and brake up the prison of Newgate / and drove out all y^
prisoners felons and other / and of both Counters and all y^ people that were
within them / and destroyed all the books of the Counters. And thus they
co^tynued both saturday and sunday unto the monday next after in all their
malice and wyckednes. And than on mon day king Rychard with his lords yt
were with him yt time / and with the Mayre of London Wyllyam Walworth yt was that
time came with the aldermen and the comyns of the Cite / and they came in to
South work to here and to know the intencion of these rebels and
mysgouerned people. And this Jack straw than made a cry in the field that
all ye people of accord should come nere and here his clamours and his cry
and his will. And the lords and the Mayre and the aldermen with the comynalte
having indignacyon of his couetyse and falsnes and his foul presumpcyon.
Anon Willyam Walworth that time being Mayre drew out his knyfe and slew
Jack straw / and anon right there smote of his heed / and set it upon a
spear / and so it was borne through London and set upon London bridge. Anon
these rysers and mysgouerned men were clean vanysshed as it had not ben they.
And than the king of his great goodness and by prayer of his lords made
there.vj. knights of good and worthy men of ye cite of London / yt is to say
/ Wyllyam Walwoorth at y^ time Mayre and slew Jack straw y^ second was
Nicolas Brembre and the third John Philipot / and the fourth Nicolas Twyford /
and the fyfth Robert Laundes / and the sy^th Robert Gayton. And than the king
with his lords and knights returned again to the toure of London / and there
he rested him till this people were better seced and set in rest and peace. And
than by process of time as they might take and get these rebels and rysers
they henge them upon the next galous through out every lordshyp in y^ realm of
England by.xl. and by.xxx. by.x. and by.xij. ever as they might be gotten and
taken in any parties. And in y^.v. year of king Rychardes regne was y^ great
earth quake / and was general throughout the world the wednesdaye after
whytsondaye in ye year of our lord. M.CCC.lxxxxj. wherefore all manner people
were sore aghast and aferde long time for dread of vengeance yt our lord
showed and did. And in the.vi. year of king Rychard sir Henry Spe^ser bishop
of Norwiche went with a Croiserie over the sea in to Flaundres / and there they
gate y^ town of Grauenyng and the town of Burburgh / Du^kerk and Newport /
and there they laded and fraughted.lj. ships with pyllage for to have comen in
to England with these ships and goods. And ye bishop of Norwyche and his
counsel let bren these ships with all ye pyllage in ye same haven in to
hard ashes. And at Du^kerk was done a battle between the Flemynges and the
Englisshmen. And at that battle were salyne a great multitude of Flemynges And
than went the bishop with his retynue to ypers / and besyeged it a long time
/ but it might not be gotten / and so left that syege and came again in to
England. For our Englysshmen were foully destroyed / and many dyed of y^ flyx.
And in this same year came queen Anne in to England for to be spoused to king
Richard. And her fader was emperor of Almayn and king of Beme. And with her
came y^ duke of Tassy her uncle / and many other worthy lords and knights of
her country of Beme and of other duche tongues to do her reverence and worship.
And sir Symond Beuerle a worthy knight of y^ garter and other knights and
squyers that were y^ kings ambassadors brought her in to England / and so
forth to London And the people of the cite / that is to say the Mayre and y^
aldermen and all y^ comyns rode against her to welcome her / and every man in
good array / and every craft with his mynstralsy in the best manner met with
her on the black heth in Kent / and so brought her unto London through y^ cite
/ and so forth to Westmynster unto the ky^ges palace. And there she was spoused
unto king Rychard well and worthily in the abbey of Westmynster / and there she
was crowned queen of England. And all her friends that came with her had great
gifts and were well cherysshed and refresshed as long time as they abode
there. And in y^ same year there was a battle done in the kings pala^s at
Westmy^ster for certain points of (...) son of sir John Ansley knight
defendau^t and Carton squire the appellaunt. But this sir John Ansley overcame
this Car ton / and made him to yield him within y^ list. And anon was this
Carton despoyled of his harneys and drawn out of y^ lystes / and so forth to
Tyburne and there he was hanged for his falsnes. And in y^ viij. year of the
regne of king Rychard sir Edmonde of Langley earl of Cambrydge y^ kings uncle
went in to Portyngale with a fair company of men of arms and archers / in
strengthynge and helping the king of Portyngale against the king of Spain
and his power / and there the king of Portyngale had the victory of his
enemies through help and conforte of our Englysshmen. And when the journey was
done y^ earl of Cambrydge came home again with his people in to England in
haste / blyssed be god and his blyssed gifts. Amen. And this same year king
Richard held his Chrystmasse in the manoyr of Eltham. And the same year y^
king of Armony fled out of his own land and came in to England for to have
help and socour of our king against his enemies that had driven him out of his
realm. And so he was brought unto the king to Eltham there as the king held
his ryall feast of Christmasse. And there our king welcomed him and did him
much reverence and worship / and commanded all his lords to make him all y^
chere that they could. And than he besought the king of his grace and of help
and of his comfort in his need / and that he might be brought again to his
kingdom and land for the Turks had destroyed the most part of his land /
and how he fled for dread / and came hyder for socour and help And than the
king having on hy^ pity and compassyon of his great myschefe and grievous
disease / anon he took his counsel and asked what was best to do. And they
answered and said / if it lyked him to give him any good / it were well done /
and as touching his people for to travail so far in to out loudes / it were
a great Ieopardy. And so the king gave him gold and silver and many other
rich gifts and jewels and betaught him to god / and so he passed again out of
England And this same year king Rychard with a royal power went in to Scotlonde
for to war upon the Scotts for the falsnes and destruccyon that the Scotts
had done to the Englysshmen in y^ marches. And than the Scotts came down to
y^ king for to treat with him and with his lords for trewse as for certain
years. And so our king and his counsel granted them trewse for certain
years / and our king turned him again in to England. And wha^ he was comen to
York there he abode and rested him. And there sir John Holand the earl of
Kentes brother slew the earls sone of Stafford and his heir with a dagger in
the cite of York wherefore the king was sore anoyed and grieved / and remeued
thens and came to London. And the Mayre with the alder men and the comyns with
all y^ solempnite that might be done rode against y^ king and brought him
royally through y^ cite and so forth to westmynster to his own palace. And in
the.ix. year of king Rychardes regne he held a parliament at Westmynster /
and there he made two dukes and a markeys / and.v. earls. The first that was
made duke was the kings uncle sir Edmond of Langley earl of Cambrydge / and

earl of the March at y^ same parlyament holden at Westmynster in plain
parlyament among all the lords and comyns was proclaimed earl of the March
and heir parent to the crown of England after king Rychard / the which
earl of the March went over the sce in to Irlonde unto his lordshyps and
lands / for the earl of March is earl of Vlster in Irlonde and by right lygne

And tha^ they took their leave of y^ king and of other lords and ladies and
went home again in to their own countries with great love and much thank. And

year of king Richardes regne sir John of Gaunt duke of Lancastre went over see
into Spain for to challenge his right y^ he had by his wives tytell unto y^
crown of Spain with a great host of people / and he had with him y^ duchess his

And at y^ last y^ king of Spain began for to treat with y^ duke of Lancastre
/ and they were accorded together through both their counseyles in this manner /
that the king of Spain should wedde the dukes daughter that was y^ right heir
of Spain / and he should give unto the duke gold and silver y^ were cast in to
great wedges: and many other jewels as much as.viij. charyottes might carry.
And every year after during y^ dukes life and the duchess his wife.x. M. mark

/ and yearly bring to Bayon to the dukes assygnes by surete made. And also y^
duke married another of his daughters to the king of Portyngale y^ same time.
And when he had done thus he came home again into England / and y^ good lady

knight y^ was called sir John of saint John / and rode to gyder in y^ park of
wodstok. And there this worthy earl of Pe^broke was slain with y^ other
knights spear as he cast it from him when they had coupled / and thus this
good earl made there his end and therefore the king and the queen made much
sorrow for his death. And in the xvj. year of king Richardes regne John Hende
being y^ time Mayre of London and John Walworth and Henry Vanner being
sheryues of London / that same time a bakers man bare a basket of horsbrede
into Fletestrete toward an hostry and there came a young man of the bishops
of Salysbury that was called Romayn / and he took a horse lofe out of y^ basket
of y^ bakers / and he asked him why he did so. And this Romayn turned again and
brake the bakers heed / and neighbors came out and would have arested this
Romayn / and he brake from them and fled to his lords place / and the
constable would have had him out / but y^ bishops men shette fast the gates /
and kept the place y^ no man might enter. And than much more people gadred
thither / and said that they would have hy^ out / or else they would brenne up y^
place and all that were therein. And tha^ came the Mayre and sheryues with much
other people and cessed y^ malice of y^ comyns / and made every man to go home
to their houses and keep y^ peace. And this Romans lord y^ bishop of
Salysbury master John Waltham that at y^ time was tresourer of England went
to sir Thomas Arundel archebysshop of Canterbury and chau^celer of England /
and there the bishop made his co^playnt unto the chaunceler upon the people of
the cite of London. And than these two bishops of great malice and vengeance
came unto the king at Wyndsore and made a great complaynt upon the Mayre and
sheryues. And anon all y^ cite afterward came before y^ king and his counsel
/ and they cast unto the cite a grievous heart and wonders great malice. And
anon suddenly the king sent for y^ Mayre of London and the sheryues / and
they came to hy^ in y^ castle of Wyndsore And the king rebuked the Mayre and
sheryues full foul for the offense y^ they had done against him and his
officers in his chamber at London / wherefore he deposed and put out the Mayre
and both sheriues / and this was done.xiiij. days before y^ feast of saint
John baptyst. And than y^ king called to him a knight that was called sir
Edward Dalingrigge / and made him wardeyn and governor of y^ cite and chamber
of London / and over all his people therein. And so he kept that office but
four wekes because that he was so gentle and tender to the citezyns of London
/ wherefore the king deposed him / and made sir Bawdewyn Radyngton knight y^
was Controller of the kings household wardeyn and governor of his chamber and
of his people therein / and chose to him two worthy men of the cite to be
sheryues with him to govern and keep y^ kings laws in the cite / that one was
called Gylbert Mawfelde / and y^ other Thomas Newenton sheryues. And than the
Mar(...) two sheryues and all y^ aldermen wall (...) worthy crafts of London
went (...) to the toure of London / and there came (...) the Constable of the
toure / and gave the Mayre and sheryues their oath and charge as they should
have taken in y^ ^^cheker of Westmynster in y^ kings court of his Justice and
barons of the escheker and than went they home again. And than the king and
his counsel for y^ greece malyer and despyte y^ they had to y^ cite of Londen
remeued all his courts from Westmynster unto the cite of york / that is to
say the chau^celer / the escheker / the kings br^che / and the common place
and there they held all these courts of law fro ^^ds^mer y^ is to say / the
feast of saint John bapryst unto y^ feast of Chrystmasse next coming And than
the king and his counsel it not so profitable there as it was at London.
Than anon he remeued if again to London and so to westmynster for greece ease
of his officers and aua^rage to the king and all the comyns of the realm. And
when the people of London saw (...) knew y^ these courts were come aga(...)
and the king and his people also / than the Mayre and the aldermen with y^
chief comyns of the cite let gadre a great sum of gold of all the comyns of
the cite / and ordained and made great rialtees against his coming to London
for to have his grace and good lordshyp / and also their lybertees and
frau^chyses granted to them again as they were wont to have before time. And
through great instaunce and prayer of the queen and of other lords and ladies
the king granted them grace. And this was done at Shene i^ sothery. And than
y^ king wtin two days after came to London. And the Mayre of the cite with the
sheryues aldermen and all the worthy men of the cite afterward rode against
him in good array to y^ heth on this side the manoyr of Shene / humbly and
mekely submyttynge them with all manner obey sau^ce unto hy^ as they ought to do.
And thus they brought y^ king and the queen to London / and when the king

stead sadled and brydled and trapped with cloth of gold and reed partyed
together. And the queen a palfrey all white in the same array trapped with white

for all manner people to drink who would. And between saint Paul and the
cross in chepe there was made a stage a ryall standing on hye / and therein
were many angels with diverse melodyes and songs. And than an angel came
down from the stage on high by a vice and set a crown of gold pyght with
rich perles and precious stones upon the kings heed / and an other upon the
queen's heed. And so y^ citezyns brought y^ king and y^ queen to Westmynster in
to their palace. And than on the moro we after y^ Mayre and the sheryues and
the aldermen of London came unto the king to his palace at westmynster and
presented him with two basyns of silver and over gylted full of coined gold the
sum of.xx.C. pound prayenge hy^ of his high mercy and grace and lordshyp and
special grace that they might have his good love with the lybertees and
frau^chyses like wise as they were wont for to have before time / and by his
lettres patentes and his chartre confyrmed. And y^ queen and other worthy
lords and ladies fell on their knees and besought y^ king of grace to
ro^fyrme this Than the king took up the queen and granted her all her
asking. And than they thanked y^ king and the queen and went home again. And
in the.xvj. year of king Rychardes regne certain lords of Scotlonde came in
to England for to get worship as by fayte of arms. And these were ye
persons / the earl of Mar and he challenged y^ earl Marshall of England to
Just with him certain points on horsbacke with sharp speres / and they rode
together as two worthy knights and lords certain courses / but not y^ full
challenge that y^ scottysshe earl made / for he was cast down both horse and
man / and two of his rybbes broken with the fall / and so he was borne thens out
of Smythfelde home to his inn / and within a little time after he was carried
home in a horse lytter / and at porke he dyed. And sir William Darell knight and
the kings banerer of Scotlond than made an other challenge with sir Piers curtayn
knight and y^ kings banerer of England of certain courses yet on horsback in
y^ same field / and when he had rydden certain courses and assayed he might not

How king Richard spoused dame Isabell y^ kings daughter of France in the
town of Calays / and brought her in to England and let her be crowned queen
in y^ abbey of saint Peter's of Westmynster.
IN the.xx. year of king Rychardes regne he went over see to Calays with dukes
/ earls / lords and barons / and many other worthy squyers with great array
and common people of the realm in good array as longed to such a king and
pry^ce of his nobley and of his own person to do him reverence and

kings daughter of France / and many other worthy lords of great name / both
barons and knights / with much other people that came to y^ town of
Grauenynge and two dukes of France / that one was the duke of Burgoyn / and

come safe his two worthy uncles / the duke of Glocestre and the duke of York /
and these two went over y^ water of Grauenyng and abode there as for pledges
unto y^ time that the marriage and the feast was done and that these two dukes
of France were comen again unto* Grauenynge water. And than these two worthy
dukes came over y^ water at Grauenyng and so to Calays with this worship full

a worthy lord and lady and knights and squyers in y^ best array that might be
And there they met with our meynr at Calays which welcomed her and her meyny with
great reverence / and so brought her in to the town of Calays / and there she
was received with all the solempnite and worship y^ might be done to such a
lady. And than they brought her to y^ king / and the king took her and
welcomed her and all her fair company / and made there a great solempnite And
than y^ king and his counsel asked of the frensshe lords whether all the
couenau^tes and forwards with the co^posycyon y^ were ordained and made on both

Calays / and there was worthily wedded with the most solempnite y^ any king or

strangers and al other and no creature warned y^ feast / but al were welcome /
for there were greece halles and tents set upon y^ grene without y^ castle to

this worthy marriage was solemply done and ended with all ryalte. Than these two
dukes of France with their people took their leave of the king and of the
queen and went again unto Grauenynge water. And there the Frensshe lords /
that is to say the two dukes and all their folk were comen over the water to
Grauenyng / and there they met / and euerichoue took leave at other / and so
they departed / and our lords came again to Calays / and the Frensshe lords
went over the water / and so home in to France again. And anon after the
king made him ready with ye queen and all his lords and ladies and all their
people with them and came over ye see in to England / and so unto London. And
the Mayre and the sheryues with all the aldermen and worthy comyns rode against
them unto the black heth in Kent / and there they met with the king and the
queen / and welcomed them and that in good array / and every man in the
clothyng of his craft and their mynstrels before them And so they brought them
to saint Geor ges bar in Southwerke / and there they took their leave. And the
king and the queen rode to Kenyngton / and than the people of London turned
home again / and in turnynge again to London bridge there was so great prese
of people both on horse and on foot / that there were deed on the bridge.xi.
persons of men and women and children / on whose souls god have mercy and
pity Amen. And than afterward the queen was brought to the toure of London /
and there she was all night / and on ye morrow she was brought through the cite
of London / and so forth to Westmynster / and there she was crowned queen of
England / and than she was brought again unto ye kings palace and there was
holden open court and a ryall feast at her crownacyo^ of all manner people that
thither came. And this was done the sunday next after the feast of saint
Clement / in the.xx. year of king Rychardes regne. And than the.xxv. day of
August next after by evil excitacyon and falls counsel and great wrath and
malice that the king had of old time to his uncle the good duke of Glocestre
and to the earl of Arundell / and to ye earl of war wyk. Anon the king by his
evil excitacyon and his evil counseyle and malice late in the evening on the
same day above said ma(...)edy with his strength and rode in to (...) to ye
town of Chelmel^ord / and ^o came to Plasshe suddenly there sir Thomas of
Wodstok ye good duke of Glocestre lay. And ye good duke came anon to welcome
the king. And the king arested ye good duke himself his own body / and so
he was ladde down to the water / and anon put in to a ship and had to Calays
/ and brought in to ye capytayns ward to be kept in hold by ye kings
commandment. And that time the earl Marshall was capytayn of Calays. And
anon after by commandment of the king and by his false counsel /
commanded yt capytayn to put him to death. And anon certain yemen that had the
good duke in keeping took their counsel how that they should put him to death.
And this was their appointment / that they should come upon hy^ when he were in
his bed and a sleep on a fether bed / and anon they bound him hand and
foot and charged him for to lie still. And when that they had done thus / they
took two towelles / and made on them two riding knottes / and cast the
towelles about his neck / and than they took the fether bed that lay under
him and cast it upon him and than they drew their towelles each ways / and
some lay upon ye fether bed and upon him unto the time yt he was deed /
because yt he should make no noise And thus they strangled this worthy duke
unto ye death / upon whose soul god for his high pity have mercy. Amen. And
when the king had thus arested this worthy duke and his uncle and sent him to
Calays he came again to London in all ye haste with a wonders great no^bre of
people. And as soon as he was comen he sent for y^ earl of Arundell / and for
the good earl of warwyk. And anon as they came he arested them himself / and
sir John Cobham and sir John Cheyn knights he arested them in yt same ma ner
till he made his parliament / and anon they were put into hold / but the earl
of Arundell went at large unto the parley a meant time / for he found sufficient
surety to abide the law / and to answer to all ma ner points that ye king
and his counsel would put upon hy^. And the.xxi. year of king Rychardes
regne he ordained hy^ a parlyament at Westmynster which was called yt great
parlyament. And this parliament was made for to judge these three worthy lords
and other moo as them list at that time. And for yt judgment the king let make
in all the haste a long house and a large of tymbre ye which was called an hall
/ and covered with tyles over / and it was open all about on both sides and
at the ends / yt all manner of men might se throughout / and there the dome was
holden upon these foresaid lords and judgment given at this foresaid
parlyament. And for to come to this parlyament the king sent his wrytes to
every lord / baron / knight and s^uyer in every shyre throughout England /
that every lord should gadre and bring his retynue with him in as short time
and in the best array yt they might ge^e / in mayntey^yage and strengthinge of
ye king against them yt were his enemies / and that this were done in all the

Cl(...) shyre to che^taines of ye (...)tree / and they gadred and brought a
great and an huge multitude of people both of knights and ^^uyers and
pryncypally of yemen of Chestershyre / which ye^ten and archers the king took
to his own court and gave them bowge of court and good wages to be kepers of
his own body both by night and by day above al other persons and most
loved and best trust / the which soon afterward turned ye king to great loss
and shame / hyndrynge and his utter undoing and destruction as ye shall here
afterward. And that time came sir Henry of Derby with a great meyny of men of
arms and archers. And ye earl of Rutlonde came with a strong power of people
both of men of arms and archers The earl of Kent brought a great power of men
of arms and archers / the earl Mar shall came in the same manner / and the

array / and the duke of Lancastre and the duke of york came in ye same manner
with men of arms and archers following ye king / and sir Willyam S^rope
tresourer of England came in the same manner. And thus in this array came all
the worthy men of this land unto our king / and all this people came to London
in one day / in so much yt every (...) lane in London and in the subbarbes
were full of them lodged / and.x. or. x^^. mile about London every way. And
this peo ple brought the king to Westmynster (...) went home again to their

the parlyame^t among all ye lords and yt was on saint Mathewes day the
apostle and evangelist / there he was for judged unto the death in this hall yt
was made in ye palace at Westmynster. And this was his judgment. He should go
on foot with his hands bound behind him from ye place that he was judged in /
and so forth through the cite of London unto ye toure hill / and his heed to be
smytten of / and so it was done in deed in the same place. And.vl. of the
gretest lords that sat on his judgment rode with him unto the place there he
was done to death / and so to se that ye execucyon were done after the dome /
and by the kings commandment with them went on footmen of arms and
archers a great multitude of Chestre shyre men / in strengthynge of ye lords
yt brought this earl to his death / for they were in dread leest ye earl should
be rescowed and taken from them when they came in to London. Thus he passed
forth through the Cite unto his death / and there he took it full pacyently / on
whose soul god have mercy Amen. And than came the Austyn freres and took up ye
body and the heed of this good earl / and bare it home to their place / and
buried him in their quere And on yt morrow after was sir Rychard earl of warwik
brought in to the parlya meant there as the earl of Arundell was for judged /
and they gave the earl of warwyk the same judgment that ye foresaid earl had /
but the lords had compassyon on him because he was of more greter age / and
released him to perpetual pry son / and put him in the isle of Man. And than on
the mondaye next after ye lord Cobham of Kent and sir John Cheyn knight were
brought also in to the parlyament in to the same hall / and there they were
judged to be hanged and drawn / but through the prayers and great instaunce of
all the lords that judgment was forgyuen them / and released to per petuall
prison. And this same time was Rychard Whyttyngdon Mayre of London / and John
Wodecocke and Wyllyam Askam sheryues of London. And they ordained at every gate
of London during this same parlyament strong watch of men of arms and
archers / and through out every ward also. And the king made.v. dukes and one
Markeys and four earls / and the first of them was the earl of Derby / and he
was made duke of Herford / and the second was the earl of Rutlonde / and he
was made duke of Awemarle / and the third was the earl of Kent and he was made

and sir Willyam Scrope that was tresourer of England was made earl of Wylshyre
/ and sir John Montagu earl of Salisbury. And when ye king had thus done he
held the parlyame^t and ryall feast unto all his lords and to all manner of
people that thither would come. And this same year dyed sir John of Gau^t ye
kings uncle and duke of Lancastre in the bishops Inn in Holborne / and was
brought fro thens to saint Paul / and there ye king made and held his
entereme^t well and worthily with all his lords in the church of saint Paul
in London / and there he was buried beside dame Blau^che his wife that was
daughter and heir unto ye good Henry yt was duke of L(...)te. In ye same year
there fell a (...)cyon between the duke of Herford and ye duke of Norfolk in
so much y^ they waged battle and cast down their gloves / and than they were
ta ken up and ensealed / and the battle joined and the day set / and the
place assygned where and when / and this should be at Couentre And thither came
the king with all his lor des at that day / and was set in the field / and than
these two worthy lords came into ye field well and clean armed and well arrayed
with all their wepen and ready to do their battle / and were ready in ye place
to fight at vtterau^ce. But ye king had them cesse and took the quarrel in to
his hands. And forth with right there present exiled the duke of Herford for
term of.x. year / and the duke of Norfolk for evermore. And sir Thomas
Arundell archebisshop of Cau^ terbury was exiled yt same time for ever and
deposed out of his see for malice of the king. And anon these three worthy
lords were commanded and defended ye kings realm. And anon they gate them
ships at diverse havens and went over the sea in to diverse lo^des each his
way And ye duke of Norfolk went to Venise and there he died / on whose soul
god have mercy Amen. And than king Rychard made a clerk of his sir Roger
Walden arche bishop of Canterbury. And in the.xxij. year of king Richardes
regne by falls counsel and ymaginacyon of covetous men that were about him
were made and ordained blancke chartres / and made them to be ensealed of al
manner ry the men throughout ye realm / in so much yt they compelled diverse
people to set their seals thereto. And this was done for great couetyse /
wherefore al good hertes of ye realm were clean turned away fro ye king for
ever after. And that was utter destruccyon and end to him yt was so high and
so excellent a prince and king / and through covetous and falls counsel
falsely betrayed. Alas for pity ye such a king might not se. And than king
Rychard set his kingdom and his ryall land of England to ferme unto four
persons which were these / sir Wyllya^ Scrope earl of Wylshyre and tresourer
of England and sir John Busshe / and Henry Grene / and sir John Bagot knights
/ which turned them to myschefe and death within a little time / as ye shall

great stuff and right good ordinance as longed unto war. And or he passed
over ye see he ordained and made (...) Edmond of Langley his uncle ye duke of
York his lewtenau^^ of England in his absence / with the governance and
cou^sey^e of these.iiij. knights yt had taken England to ferme of the king.
And than he passed the sea and came in to Irlonde and there he was well and
worth^ly received And these rebels that been called (...) Irysshmen came down
to the king and yielded them to him both body and go^des all at his own will
/ and swore unto (...) to be his lyege men / and there did to him homage and
feaute and good service and thus he conquered ye most part of Irlende in a
little time. And while that king (...) chard was thus in Irlonde sir Henry of
Bolyngbroke earl of Derby that ye king had made before duke of Herford y^ (...)
che duke the king had exiled out of this land was comen again in to England
for to challenge ye dukedom of Lancast^^ as for his right and true heritage. And
he came down out of France unto ^alays And there met hy^ sir Thomas
Arundell yt was archebysshop of (...) that was exiled out of England and wi^^
him came the earl of Arundel his so^^ and heir the which was in keeping of
sir John shelley knight sometime with ^he earl of Huntyngdon and with the duke of

these lords / and so couraged them in all manner thing / and passed forth in
to the land and gadred much people to them. And when king Rychard herd and
wist that these two lords were comen again in to England and were londed.
Than the king left his ordinance in Irlonde and came in to Englondward in
all the haste that he might / and came to the castle of ^lyut / and there he
abode for to take his counseyle and what might be done / but to him came none.
And wha^ sir Thomas Percy earl of Worcestre yt was ye kings steward wist and
knew this / anon he came in to the hall among all ye people / and he brake
the yerde of ye ryall kings household / and anon every man was disperpied and
went his way and forsook their master and souerayn lord / and left him
alone. And thus was king Richard brought down and destroyed / and stood him
self alone without comfort or socour or any good counseyle of any man / alas
for pite of this ryall king. And anon came tydy^ges that sir Henry of Boling
broke was up with a strong power of people and that all ye squyers of England
raised up the shyres in strengthyng of him against king Rychard. And thus soon
he was comen out of the North country to Brystowe / and there he met with
sir Wyllyam Scrope earl of Wylshyre and tresourer of England / and with sir
John Busshe and sir Henry Grene / and John Bagot / but he escaped from them and

king Rychard taken and brought unto the duke And anon ye duke put hy^ in fast
ward and strong hold unto his coming to London. And than was there a rumor
in London and a strong noise that king Rychard came to Westmynster / and the
people of London ran thither and would have done much harm and hurt in
their woodnes / had not ye Mayre and aldermen and other worthy men cessed them
with fair words / and turned them home again to London. And there was sir
John Slake dene of the kings chapel of Westmynster taken and brought to
London / and put in prison in Ludgate. And after that John Bagot was taken in
Irlonde and brought to London / and put in prison in Newgate / there to be
kept and abide his answer. And soon after the duke brought king Richard
pryuely to London / and put him in the toure under sure keeping as a prisoner.
And than came the lords of the realm with al their counsel unto ye toure to
king Rychard and said to him of his mysgouernaunce and extorcion that he had
done / made and ordained to oppress all ye common people / and also to all the
realm. Wherefore all ye common people of ye realm would have him deposed of his

crowned of Bonifate the. ix This man entered ytaly with a great host of Almayns
against John the duke of Galias / but he returned with a great wound / and was a

done hy^ to wit yt the duke of Orlyau^ce was comen to saint Clowe fast by
Paris with a great nombre of men or arms and arbalastres / and thither went our
Englysshmen and fought with them / and gate y^ bridge of saint Clowe / and
there they slew many Frensshmen and arbalastres / and the remenau^t fled and
would no longer abide. And tha^ our englysshmen came again to Paris / and there
they took their leave of ye duke and came safe again in to England / and the
duke gave them great gifts. And anon after ye duke of Orlyau^ce sent
ambassadors in to England to king Henry the.iiij. besechinge him of his help
and socour against his deedly enemy ye duke of Burgoyne. And than the king
made Thomas his sone duke of Clarence and his other sone John duke of Bedforde
/ and his other sone Vmfrey duke of Glocestre / and sir Thomas Beauford earl of
Dorset / and the duke of Awemarle he made duke of York. And than ye king
ordained his sone sir Thomas duke of Clare^ce / sir Thomas beauford earl of
Dorset / and sir John Cornwyll with many other lords knights and squyers and
men of arms and archers for to go ouet see in to France in helping and
strengthynge of the duke of Orlyaunce. And these worthy lords with their retynue
shypped at Hamton and sailed over y^ see in to Normandy / and londed at Hogs.
And there met with them y^ lord Hambe at their londynge with.vij. M. men of
arms Frensshmen and three sergeau^tes of arms with them / and all were put to
flight / and of them were taken. vij.C. men of arms and. iiij.C. horses /
without those that were slain in the field. And so they rode forth through out
all France and took castles and towns and slew many Frensshemen that
withstode them / and took many prisoners as they rode / and so they passed
forth till they came to Burdeux and there they rested them a while and set the
country in peace / and rested till the vyntage were ready to sail. And than ye
duke with his meyny came home in to England in safete thanked be god. And in
the same year was the kings coin changed throughout England by the king
and his counsel / that is to say / the noble / half noble / and ferthynge
of gold. And in the.xiiij. year of king He^rpes regne the fourth / he let make
galays of war / for he hoped to have passed the great see / and so forth to
Jerusalem / and there to have ended his life / but god vysyted him soon after
with infirmite and great sekenes / that he might not well endure no while / so
seruently he was taken and brought in bed at Westmy^ster in a fair chamber.
And as he lay in his bed he asked his chamberlayne what he called ye chamber yt
he lay in. And he answered and said Jerusalem. And than he said yt the prophecy
said yt he should make an end and dye in Jerusalem. And than he made him ready
unto god and dysposed all his will And soon after he died / and was carried by
water from Westmynster in a barge unto Feuersham / and from thens he was carried
to Canterbury by land with much torche light brennynge in to ye abbey of
Chrystchirche / and there he was entered and buried beside saint Thomas of
Cau^terburyes shryne. And thus ended ye worthy king Henry about mydlent sunday
/ in ye year of our lord a. M.CCCC. and.xiij. upon whose soul god have mercy.
Amen.

MArtyn y^.v. was pope after John xiiij. year. This man was chosen by the
concyle of Constance / and the other were deposed y^ strove / and so came peace
in the church the which long time before was desired and necessary for y^
defense of the faith. This was y^ myghtyest pope that ever was of riches / and
a great judge He edifyed towns / walls / streets / and he destroyed heresies
/ and he did much good through the noble prince Sygysmund. And he gadred much
money for to get y^ holy land again / but death came upon him and let him /

Eugenius was pope after Martyn.xvii. year. This Eugeny was chosen peasybly
after the death of Martyn / and no man doubted but he was pope But shortly after
he was expulsed from Rome / for it was so that he fled naked Also he was
cited to the concyle of Basilieus and deposed / but he charged him not And for
that began ye strife again / the which stood to his death / and those that
favored him said he was worthy much loving / and the contrary said those
that were against him / but what someuer he was after he had taken the dignite
upon him / before he was of great abstynence and of good fame / and that he did
after that I leave to the judgment of god.

Circa annu^ dn^i. M.CCCC.xiij.
Of king Henry the fyfth that was king Henryes sone.

ANd after the death of king Henry the fourth reigned king Henry his sone that
was borne at Monmouth in Wales / that was a worthy king and a gracyous man and
a great conqueror. And in ye first year of his regne for great love and
goodness he sent to the f^^res of Langley there as his fader had do bury king
Rychard the second / and let take his body out of the earth again / and did do
bry^ge it to Westmynster in a ryall chare covered with black velvet and baners
of diverse arms about / and all the horses drawing y^ chare were trapped in
black and beten with diverse arms / and many a torche brennynge by all the
way till he came to Westmynster / and there he let make for him a ryall and a
solemn enterement / and buried him by queen Anne his wife / as his own
desire was / on y^ ferther side of saint Edwardes (...)yne in y^ abbey of saint
Peter's of Westmynster / upon whose soul god have mercy. And in this same year
were certain lollers taken and falls heretykes yt had purposed through false
treason for to have slain our king / and for to have destroyed all the clergy
of y^ realm / and they might have had their false purpose. But our lord god
would not suffer it / for in haste our king had warning thereof and of all
their falls ordinance and werkyng / and came suddenly with his power to saint
John's without sinythfelde / and anon they took a certain of the lollers and
falls heretykes / and brought them to ye kings presence and there they told
all their falls purpose and ordinance how they would have done and wrought / if
they might have reigned and had their will / and there they told which were
their capytayns and governors / and than ye king commanded them to the toure
of London: and than took moo of them both win ye cite and without / and sent
the^ to Newgate and to both Co^ters. And than they were brought in examinacion
before ye clergy and the kings Justices / and there they were co^uicte for
their falls heresy / and dampened before y^ Iustyee for their falls treason / and
this was their judgment / yt they should be drawn from ye toure of London to
saint Giles field / and there to be hanged and brent on ye galowes. Also there
was taken sir Roger Acton knight for heresy and eke for treason against ye king
and ye realm / and he came before y^ clergy and was co^uict for his heresy to
be brent / and dampened before the Justices to be drawn from the toure of
London through the cite to saint Giles field / and to be hanged and brent. And
in ye second year of king Henryes regne he held a counsel of all ye lords
of ye realm at Westmy^ster / and there he put him this demand / and prayed
and besouhgt them of their goodness and of their good counsel and good will to
show him as touching ye tytell and the right yt he had to Normandy Gascoyn and
Guyen / the which ye king of France whelde wrongfully and vnryghtfully / y^
which his auncestres before hy^ had by true tytell of conquest and right
heritage / the which Normandy / Gascoyn and Guyen ye good king Edward of
Wyndsore and his auncestres before him had holden all their life time. And his
lords gave him counsel to send ambassadors to the king of France and his
counsel yt he should give up unto him his right heritage / yt is to say
Normandy / Gascoyn and Guyen / y^ which his predecessors had holden before hy^
/ or else he would it win with strength of sword in short time with ye help
of almighty god. And than the Dolphyn of France answered to our ambassadors
and saydi this manner / that the king was over young and to tender of age to
make any war as against hy^ / and was not like yet to be a good warryour to
do and make such a conquest there upon him. And somewhat in scorn and despyte
he sent to hy^ a tonne full of tenes balls because he should have somewhat to
play withal for him and for his lords / for that would become him better
than to mayntayn any war. And than anon our lords yt were ambassadors took
their leave and came in to England again and told the king and his couseyle
of the ungoodly answer yt they had of the Dolphin / and of the present y^
which he had sent to our king. And when the king had herd their words and
y^ answer of y^ Dolphyn he was wonders sore agreued and right evil apayed
toward the frensshmen and toward the king and the Dolphyn / and thought to
aue^ge him on them as soon as god would send him grace and might And anon let
make tenes balls for the Dolphyn in all y^ haste that he might / and they were
great gonstones for the Dolphyn to play withal. And than anon the king sent
for all the lords and held a great counsel at Westmynster / and told to
them the answer yt they had of the Dolphin and of his worthy present yt he sent
to him and to his lords to play wtall. And there ye king and his lords were
accorded that they should be ready in arms with their power in the best array yt
might be done and get all the men of arms and archers that might be gotten /
and all other stuff yt longed to war / and to be ready with all their retynue
to mete at Southhampton by La^masse next following without any delay /
wherefore ye king ordained his navy of ships with all manner stuff and
vytayle that lo^ged to such a warryour of all manner ordinance in the haven of
Southhampton to ye nombre of.CCC. and.xx. sails. And tha^ fell there a great
disease and a foul myschefe. For there were three lords which that the king
trusted much on / and through false couetyse they had purposed and ymagined
the kings death / and thought to have slain him and all his brethren or he
had taken the sea / which three lords were named thus / sir Richard earl of
Cambrydge brother to ye duke of york / ye second was the lord Scrope tresourer
of England / y^ third was sir Thomas Gray knight of the North country. And
these three lords aforesaid for lucre of money had made a promise unto y^
Frensshmen for to have slain king Henry the fyfth and all his brethren by a
false train suddenly or they had been ware. But almighty god of his great grace
held his holy hand over them and saved them from these perilous meiny. And
for to have done this they received of y^ frensshmen a millyon of gold / and
that was there openly proved And for their falls treason they were all three
judged to death / and this was y^ judgment / that they should be ladde through
Hampton / and without northgate there to be heded. And thus they ended their
lives for their falls couetyse and treason. And anon as this was done the king
and all his meyny made them ready and went to ship and sailed forth with.xv.
hundred ships / and arrived within Seyne at Kydecause upon our ladies even
the Assumpcyon in Normandy with all his ordinance / and so went forth to Harflet
/ and he besyeged the town all about by land and also by water / and sent to
the capytayne of the town and charged him to deliver the town. And ye
capytayne said that he delivered him none / ne none he would hy^ yield / but
badde him do his best. And than our king laid his ordinance unto the town /
that is to say / gonnes / engynes and tripgettes / and shot and cast at the
walls and eke at the town / and cast down both toures and town and laid
them on y^ earth / and there he played at the tenes with his hard gonne stones.
And they y^ were with in y^ town when they should play their song was well
away and alas that ever any such tenes balls were made / and cursed al tho y^
war began / and y^ time that ever they were borne. And on the morrow y^ king
let cry at every gate of the town that every man should be ready on the morrow
erly to make assaute to y^ town. And Willyam Boucher and John Grant with.xij.
other worthy burgeses came to the king and besought him of his ryall pryncehode
and power to withdraw his malice and bestruccyon that he did to them / and
besought him of.viij. days respyte and trewse if any rescowe might come to
them / and else to yield up ye town to him with al their goods. And than the
king sent forth y^ capytayne and kept the remenau^t still with him. And y^ lord
Gaucorte yt was capytayne of y^ town went forth to Roen in all ye haste unto
the Dolphyn for help and socour / but there was none ne no man of rescowe /
for the Dolphyn would not abide. And thus this capytayne came again unto the
king and yielded up ye town / and delivered him the keys. And than he called
his uncle ye earl of Dorset and made him capytayne of the town of Harflet / and
delivered him y^ keys and bad hy^ go and put out all y^ fre^sshe people both
men women and children / and stuff his town of Harflet with english people.
And than ye king sent in to England and let cry in every good town of
England / y^ what crafty man would come thither and enhabyte him there in y^
town he should have (...)s and household to hy^ and to his heirs for ever more.
And thither went many merchants and crafty me^ / and enhabyted them there to
strength the town / and were welcome. And wha^ y^ king saw y^ this town was
well stuffed both of vytayles and of men / this worthy prince took his leave
and went toward Calays by land / and y^ frensshmen herd of his coming / they
thought for to have stopped hy^ his way y^ he should not pass that way / in
all y^ haste y^ they might brake al y^ bridges where as any passage was for
horse and man / in so much that there might no man pass over the ryuers
neither on horse ne on fo^e / but if he should have bendrowned. And therefore our
king with all his people went and sought his way far up toward Paris / and
there was all y^ ryall power of France assembled and ready to give him battle
/ and for to destroy all his people. But almighty god was his guide and saved
hy^ and all his meyny / and defended him of his enemies power and purpose
thanked be god y^ saved so his own knight and king in his right full tytel.
And than our king beholding and seeing y^ great multitude and nombre of his
enemies to withstand his way and give him battle. Than the king with a meke
heart and a good spirit lift up his hands to almighty god / and besought hy^
of his help / and y^ day to save his true servants. Than our king gadred
all his lords and other people about and bad them al to be of good chere /
for they should have a fair and a gracyous victory and the better of all their
enemies / and prayed them to make the^ ready to y^ battle / for he would rather
dye y^ day in the field / than to be taken of his enemies / for he would never
put y^ realm of England to rau^som for his person. And y^ duke of York fell
on his knees and besought y^ king of a bone / y^ he would grant him yt day y^
vau^tward in his battle / and the king granted him his askyng / and said
gramercy cosyn of York / and prayed him to make him ready. And than badde he
every man to ordeyn him a stake of tree and sharp both ends that y^ stake
might be pyght in y^ earth a slope / that their enemies should not over come them
on horsback / for yt was their falls purpose / and arrayed them for to over ride
our meyny suddenly at the first coming on of them at y^ first brunt. And all the
night before y^ battle y^ frensshmen made many great fyers and much revel
with howting and showting / and played our king and his lords at y^ dyse / and
an archer always for a blanke of their money / for they wend al had be^ theyrs.
The morn ^^ose y^ day began spring / and the king by good advise let array his
battle and his wings / and charged every man to keep them hole together / and
prayed them all to be of good chere. And wha^ they were ready he asked what time
of ye day it was and they said pryme. Than said our king now is good time /
for all england prays for us: and therefore be of good chere and let us go to
our journey. And tha^ he said with an hye voice / in the name of almighty god and
saint George auau^t baner / and saint George this day thine help. And than the
Frensshmen came pryckynge down as they would have over rydden all our meyny /
but god and our archers made them right soon to stomble / for our archers
shot never arowe amysse / but it perysshed and brought to ye ground both
horse and man / for they shot yt day for a wager. And our stakes made them
top over terue each one over over / y^ they lay on hepes two speres length
of heyght. And our king with his meyny and with his men of arms and archers yt
thacked on them so thycke with arowes and laid on with stakes And our king with
his hands fought manly y^ day. And thus almighty god and saint George brought
our enemies to ground / and gave us that day the victory There were slain of
frensshmen yt day in ye field of Agincourt m^^ than.xi. M. Without prisoners
yt were taken / and there were nombred that day of Frensshmen in the field moo
than six score. M. But god that day fought for us. And after came there
tidings to our king that there was a new battle of frensshmen ordained ready
for to stele on him and came toward him. And anon our king let cry that
every man should slay his prysouers that he had taken / and anon array the
battle again ready to fight with the Frensshmen. And when the Frensshmen saw
that our men killed down their prisoners / than they withdrewe them and brake
their battle and al their array. And thus our king as a worthy conqueror had
that day the victory in the ^elde of Agincourt in Pycardy. And than our king
returned again where as the battle was / for to ^e what people were slain of
Englysshmen / and if any were hurt y^ they might be helped And there were deed
in y^ field the duke of Barry / the duke of Alau^son / the duke of Braband /
the earl of Nauerne thief constable of France / and.viij. other earls and the
archebysshop of Saunce / and of good barons an.C. and mo / and of worthy
knights of great alyaunce of cote armures.xv. ho^dred. And of Englysshmen were
deed yt day the good duke of York and the earl of Suffolk / and of all other
Englysshmen there were not deed passing.xxvi. bodies thanked be god. And this
battle was on a frydaye / which was saint Crispyne and Crispinians day in the
month of October / and anon the king commanded to bury them / and the duke
of York to be carried forth with him and the earl of Suffolk. And there were
prisoners y^ duke of Orlyau^ce / the duke of Burbon / the earl of Vendome / the
earl of Ewe / the earl of Richemond and sir But sigau^t marsha^ ^f France /
and many other worthy lords were taken there in this battle of Agincourt and
were brought to the town of Calays / and so over the sea with the king in to
England and londed at Dover in Kent with all his prisoners in safete thanked be
almighty god / and so came to Cas^terbury and offered at saint Thomas shryne.
And so forth he rode through the ^o^^^re of Kent the next way to Eitham and
th^re he rested till that he would come to London. And than the Mayre of London
/ the aldermen and sheryues with all y^ comuners and crafts came to y^ black
^eth well and worthily arrayed to welcome our king with diverse melodyes / and
^hanked almighty god of his gracyous vyctory that he showed for him. And so y^
king and his prisoners passed forth by them ty^ he came to saint Thomas of
wateryng / and there met with him all religyous men with processyon and welcomed
him. And so the king came rydyng with his prisoners through y^ rite of London /
where as was showed many a fair sight at all yt condythes and at yt cross in
chepe as in heavenly array of angels / archau^gels / patriarchs / prophets and
virgyns / with diverse melodyes sensyng and singing to welcome the king / and

And in y^ third year of king He^ryes regne y^ fyfth came the emperor of
Almayn king of Rome and of Hungry in to England / and so to y^ ^^^e of London.
And the Mayre and the aldermen with the sheryues and worthy crafts of London by

than y^ king came in to the town with his brother the duke of Clarete and many
other worthy lords with much solempuite and myrthe. And than the king
commanded y^ capytayn to deliver h^ his castle. And he besought the king to

at y^.xiiij. days end the capytayn of the castle came out and de lyuered y^
keys and the castle to our king, and Bayeus and the other.xiiij. towns were
delivered to him also. And anon the king delivered the keys to the duke of
Clare^ce / and made him capytayn both of the town and also of the castle /
and made him capytayn of Baycus and of all the other towns also. And so he
(...) the town and the castle / and there he held said ^^orges fest / and

Salin / Chayny / Mougome ^y / (...) many other worthy men. And the king
commanded them for to put out all the Frensshmen and women / and no man so
hardy to defoule any woman / no take no manner of good awayt fr^ them / but let
them pass i^ peace on pain of death. And there passed out of the town in one
day moo than.xv.C. women. And the king let stuff the town and castle with
Englyssh men / and ordained there two capytaynes / one for the town / and an
other for y^ castle and charged them upon their lives for to keep well the
town and the castle. And or that our king went thens he gate Faleys Newelyn
/ and laid a syege to Shyr burgh / and that syege laid y^ duke of Glo testre
with a strong power and a mighty and by process of time gate it / and made
there a capytayne of y^ same town. And this same time y^ earl of Warwik laid
a syege unto Dounfront and gate it / and put therein a capytayne. And for to
speak more of the earl of March that y^ king ordained tho to scomme the sea
and to keep the costs of England for all manner of enemies / the wind arose
upon them, that they wend all to have been lost / but through the grace of god
almighty and good governance they tode before the (...) of Wight all y^ storm.
And there were lost two carackes and two balyngers with marchau^dyse and other
great goods and all the people y^ were within them. And an other caracke drove
before Hamton / and threw his mast over the walls of the town / and this was
on saint Barthylmewes day. And when all this storm was cesed this worthy earl
of March took his ships with his meyny / and went to the sea and londed in
Normandy at Hogs / and so rode forth toward the king / and ever as he came
the frensshmen fled. And there came unto them an Anthony pygge and followed y^
host all y^ way till they came to a great water / and there they drad to have
bendrowned / for the water closed them so y^ they might no where get out. But
at the last almighty god (...) this pygge brought them out all safe (...) there
they caught a guide y^ knew all the country about / (...) brought them
through a (...) sa^de / and so in to an isle / and there they (...) many
prisoners in their way toward the king in their journey / and so they came
unto Cane. And there y^ king welcomed him and took his journey to Argenten /
and than anon it was yolden unto the king / and they had their lives and went
their way And than our king remeued and went to a strong town that was
called Cese / and there was a fair mynster / and they yielded it anon unto the
king. And than the king went from thens to Alaunson and wanne the town and
the bridge. And the king sent the earl of warwyk to (...) town that was
called Belesme with a great and a strong power / and anon they yielded it /
and put them all in to the kings good grace and mercy / and so did many mo^
strong towns and castelles that were in those parties. And from thens they
went (...) in Perch / and anon it was yielded unto the (...) both the town
and the castle / and bodies, and goods at the kings good grace. And so the
king gate and conquered all y^ towns and castelles / pyles stre^gthes (...)
abbeys unto Pou^t de larche and from thens unto y^ cite of Boen. And in the
fyfth year of king Henryes regne the fyfth / sir John Oldeastel y^ was the
lord Cobham was arested for heresy / and brought to y^ Coure of London / and
anon after he brake the Cou^e and went in to Wales / and there kept him
(...)ge time. And at y^ (...)he lord Po(...) took him but he stood(...) great
defense long time and was sore wo^ded or he would be taken and to the lord
(...) man brought him out of Wales to London (...) where(...) and so he was
brought to Westmynster / and there was examined of certain points that were
^ut on (...) / and he said not nay / and so he was conuicte of the clergy for
his heresy / (...) (...)ned before the Justyfull glad / and so they went forth
in haste and kept y^ ground and the place y^ the king and his counsel had
assigned / and they quytte them as good warryours to their king Now will I tell
you which were y^ chief capytaynes and governors of y^ cite of Roen. Mon sir
Guy butler was chief capytayn both of y^ cite and of the castle / and Mon sir
Termegan he was capitayn of port de Caur. Mon sir de la Roche was capitayn of
y^ disners. Monsyr Anthony was lewtenaunt to Mon sir Guy Butler. Henry
Chantfien was capytayne of the port de la pount. John Mantreuas was capytayne
of the port de la castle. Monsyr de Preaux was capytayne of the port of saint
Hylary. The bastard of Tyne he was capytayne of the port Martenuylle. And
grau^d Iakes a worthy war^ your he was capytayne of all men of war / and he
was governor outward both on horsbacke and on foot of al men of arms wha^
they issued out of the cite of all y^ ports he them arrayed as they should
encountre with our meyny. And each of the capitaynes ladde.v. M. men of arms /
and some moo. And at y^ first coming of our king there were nombred by
herawdes unto.CCC. M. of men and women and children / what young and old. And
among all these was many a manfull man of his hands / and so they preued them
when they issued out of the cite both on horsbacke and on foot / for they came
never at one gate out alone / but at three or four gates / and at every gate
two or three thousand of good me^nes bodies armed and manfully encountered with our
Englysshmen / and much people slain diverse times with gonnes / quarelles and
other ordinance. And this syege dured.xx. wekes / and ever they of the town
trusted to have been res^^wed / but there came none. So at the last they kept
so long the town that there dyed many a thousand within the town for
defaute of meet of men and women and children / for they had eten their horses
/ dogs and cattes that were in the town. And oftentimes y^ men of arms
drove out the poor people at the gates of the town for spendyng of vitayles /
and anon ou^ Englysshmen drove them in to the town again. So at the last the
capytayne of the town saw the myschefe / and that they were not rescowed /
and also the scarsete of vytayle / and that the people dyed for defaute of meet
every day many thousands / and also saw young children lie like as they had
souked their moders pappes and were deed. Than anon they sent to the king
besechynge him of his grace and mercy / and brought the keys of the town unto
y^ kyng^ and de lyuered the town to him / and all the soudyours voyded the
town with they horses and harneys / and the comyns of y^ town for to abide and
dwell still in y^ town / yearly to pay to hy^ and to his successors for all
manner customs and ^ee fermes and quater^mes. And than the king entered into the
town / and rested him in the castle till the town was set in rule and in
governance.

How the king of England was made enherytour and regent of Fraunc^ / and how
he wedded queen Katheryne.
ANd anon after that Roen was gotten / Deep and many other towns in base
Normandy gave them over without stroke or syege when they understood y^ the
king had go^e^ Ro^n. Also this year had been a peace made and sworn between y^
duke of Burgoyn and the Dolphyn / which were sworn on gods body that they
should love and assyst ^^he other against their enemies. And after this
contrary to this oath / the duke John of Burgoyne was slain and pyteously
murdered in the presence of the Dolphyn wherefore ye frensshmen were greatly
divided / and of very necessyte labored to have a treaty with ye king of
England For the king of England wanne daily of them towns / castelles and
fortresses. Also this same year was queen Jane arested and brought in to ye
castle of Ledes in Kent. And one friar Randolf a doctor of divinity her
confessor which afterward was slain by the person of the Toure falling at
words and debate. And after queen Jane was delivered. And in the.vij. year
both ye king of France and of England were accorded / and king Henry was
made heir and regent of France / and wedded dame Katheryn the kings daughter
of France at Troyes in Champayn on Tr^^ite sunday. And this was made by the
mean of Philip new made duke of Burgoyne / which was sworn to king Henry
for to aue^ge his faders death and was become english And than ye king with
his new wife went to Paris / where he was ryally received. And from thens he
went with his lords and the duke of Burgoyn and many other lords of France and
laid syege to diverse towns of France that held of ye Dolphyns party and
wanne them. But ye town of Melune held long time / for therein were good
defenders. In the viij. year ye king and ye queen came over see and londed on
Candelmasse day in ye morning at Dover. And the.xiiij. day of Feueryer ye king
came to London / and the. xxj day of ye same month ye queen came / and
the.xxiiij. day of ye same she was crowned at Westmynster. Also ye same year
anon after eester ye king held a parlya meant at Westmynster / at which
parlia meant it was ordained yt the gold in english coin should be weyed /
and none received but by weight. And anon after ^hytsontyde the king sailed to
Calais and passed so forth into France. And in March the.xxij. day before
the king came over / ye duke of Clare^ce was slain in France / and diverse
other lords taken prisoners / as the earl of Huntingdon / ye earl of Somerset
with diverse other / and all was because they would not take none arthers with them
/ but thought to have ouercomen ye frensshmen themself without archers / and
yet when he was slain the archers came and rescowed the body of the duke /
which they would have carried with them / god have mercy on his soul / he was a
valyau^t man. And the same year between Chrystmasse and Ca^delmasse the town
of Melun was yolden to ye king In the.ix. year on saint Nicolas day in
Dece^ber was borne Henry y^ kings first begoten sone at Wyndsore / whose
godfaders at the font stone was Henry bishop of Wynchestre / and John duke of
Bedford / and the duchess of Holland was godmoder / and Henry Chicheley
archebisshop of Canterbury was godfader at co^ firmynge. And in the.x. year ye
cite of Meaux in Brie was gotten / which had long ben besyeged. And this same
year the queen shypped at Hampton and sailed over to the king in France /
where she was worshipfully received of ye king / and also of the king of
France her fader / and of her mother. And thus king Hery Wanne fast in France
and held great estate / and sat at diner at a gretefeest i Paris crowned and
the queen also / which had not be^ seen before / and all people resorted to
his court but the king of France held none estate ne rule / but was left
almost alone. Also this year ye wethercocke was set upon Paul's steple at
London. And this year in the month of August ye king wexed seek at Boys de
Vincene / and wha^ he saw he should dye he made his testament / and ordained
many noble things for his soul and devoutly received al cheryghtes of holy
church / in so ferforth that when he was anointed he said the service with the
priest / and at the verse of the psalm of ^iserere mei deus. that was Benign
fac dn^e in bona volu^tate tua syon: vt edifice^tur muri jerusalem. he badde
tarry there and said thus. O good lord / thou know that mine intent has been
/ and yet is / if I might live to reedifye ye walls of Jerusalem. And than the
priest proce ded forth and made an end. And anon after this most noble
prince and victoryous king flower in his time of christen chyualry / whom all
the world doubted / gave his soul in to the hands of god and dyed and made
an end of his natural life at the foresaid Boys de Vince^ne beside Paris
the.xxxvj. year of his age / upon whose soul god have mercy. Amen.

Than was the body enbawmed and cered and laid in a ryall chare / and an image
like to him was laid upon the corpse open with diverse baners / and horses
covered ry chely with the arms of England and France and also the old arms
of saint Edward saint Edmond and other / with great multitude of torches /
with whom went ye king of Scotlond and many other lords which acco^panyed
the body till it came unto Westmynster by London in England. And in every town
by ye way he had solempnely his Dirige on the even and mass on the morrow /
and much alms was given to poor people by the way. And the.vij. day of
November after ye corpse was brought through London with great reverence and
solempnite to Westmynster where as he now lies / it was worshipfully buried /
and after was laid on his tomb a ryal image like himself of syluet and gylt /
which was made at ye ^ost of queen Katheryn. And thus ended and is entered and
buried the noble king Henry the fyfth / on whose soul and all thrysten souls
god have mercy.

Amen.
Of the law of king Henry the fyfth and what he ordained for king Richard and
for himself after his death.
HEre is to be noted that this king Henry ye fyfth was a noble prince after he
was king and crowned / how be it before in his youth he had been wild recheles
and spared nothing of his lust ne desires / but accomply^^hed them after his
lykyng. But as soon as he was crowned / anointed and sacred / anon suddenly
he was changed in to a new man and set all his intent to live virtuously in
maynteynynge of holy church / destroyenge of heretykes / keeping Justice and
defendyng of his realm and subgeetes. And for as much as his fader had
deposed by his labor the good king Rychard / and pyteously made him to dye /
and for the offense done to him against his legeaunce he had sent to Rome to be
assoyled thereof For which offense our holy fader ye pope enjoined him to make
him to be prayed for perpetually / and like as he had done to be taken from him
his natural life / therefore he should do found.iiij. tapers to bren
perpetually about his body that for the extynccyon of his bodyly life his soul
may ever be remembered and live in heaven in spiritual life. And also ye he
should every weke on the day as it came about of his death have a sole^pne mass
of Requi^ and on the even before a Dirige with.ix. lessons / and a dole to poor
people always on ye day of.xj. shyllynges and.viij. pens to be deled penny mele
/ and ones in ye year at his annyuersary his entereme^t to be holden in the
most honest wise / and to be deled ye day.xx. pound in pens to poor people
and to every monk.xx. shyllynges / which all these things per^ournted this
noble king for his fader. For king Henry the fourth his fader performed it
not during his life / whom as it was said god touched and was a lepre or he
dyed. And than this noble prince let do call all the abbottes and pryours of
saint Benettes order in England / and had them in the chapter house of
Westmy^ster for the reformacion of the order / wherein he had comynycacyon / and
also with bishops and men of the spiritualte / in so ferforth that they
doubted sore ye he would have had ye temporaltees out of their hands /
wherefore by the advise / labors and procuryng of the spiritualte encouraged
the king for to challenge Normandy and his right in France / to the intent to
set him a work there / that he should not seek occasyons to enter in to such
matters. And al his life after he labored in ye werres in conque ryng a great
part of ye realm of France that by the agreement of the king Charles he had
all the governance and rule of the realm of France / and he was proclaimed
regent and heir of France. And so notwithstanding for all this great war
that he had / yet he remembered his soul / and also that he was mortal and
must dye / for which he ordained by his life time the place of his sepulture
where he is buried / and there is every day three masses perpetually songen in
a chapel over his sepulture / of which the myddle mass and the first and the
last mass shall be as it is assygned by him / as it appears by these verses
following.

And yet the noble king Henry ye fyfth founded two houses of religyon / that
one is called Syon beside Braynford of the order of saint Brigitte both of men
and women. And on ye other side of the river of Tamyse a house of monks of
Charterhous / in which two places he is contynually prayed for night and day
/ for ever when they of Syon rests they of the Charterhous do their service /
and in like wise when they of ye Charterhous rests the other gothe to / and
by ryngynge of the belles of either place each knows when they have ended
their service / which be nobly endowed / and do daily there great alms deeds
/ as in the Charterhous certain children be found to scole: and at Syon
certain alms given daily. And yet beside all this he founded a recluse which
shall be always a priest to pray for him by ye said Charterhous which priest is
sufficiently endowed for hy^ and a servant. Loo here may all pry^ces take
ensample by this noble prince that reigned so little time / not fully.x. year /
and did so many noble acts as well for his soul to be perpetually prayed for
/ as in his worldly co^questes / and he being i^ his most lusti age despised
and eschewed sin and was a great iusticer / in so much yt al ye princes of
christe^dom drad him and also of (...) and ^e (...) in him ^^fe if god (...) to

(...) the.v. was pope when Eugeny was deposed.ix. year. This Felix was (...)
of Sauoye (...) prince and an old man / and he saw his childs child. This
man wha^ he lived an holy life was chosen pope of the concyle of Basyle / and
Eugeny was deposed / and there was strife longetyme / and he had no great
obedyence for the deposicyon of Eugeny. And at ye last Eugeny decessed and than
Felix resygned to Nycolas for favor of peace to be had / and he was made legate
of france and cardynall of Sabianus This was the.xxiij. (...) between Eugeny
and (...) / and i^ (...). xv^. y^ere / and this was a new cause and (...) seen
before / for ye concyle of Basyle deposed Eugeny ye very pope / and the^e was
no more for he obeyed not the de^rees of the concyle of Constantynople as they
said / ne he charged not to obey the concyle of Basyle / but he said rather ye
contrary should be done than so as they d^^r^ed. Wherefore there arose a great
altercacyon in ye matter. For some said one way / and some another / and could
not accord unto this day / for yt one party said ye the concyle was above
the pope / and an other party said ye contrary / ye the pope was above ye
concyle / but they left it vndetermyned / and therefore god must dyspose for
the best. Albert was emperor after Sygysmonde one year. This Albert was duke
of Austre and neuewe to Sygysmonde / and therefore he was king of ^^em and of
Vngry for his daughter / for other heir he left none. This man was emperor of
Almayne / but anon he was poisoned and dyed / and he was in all things a
virtuous man / yt all men said he was a president to all kings. Fredericus y^
third was emperor after him. This Frederyk was duke of Osteryke / and chosen
Emperor of Almayne / but it was long or he was crowned of the pope for
division. At the last there was made an unite / and he was crowned with great
honor of the pope in ye cite / and was a peasy ble man and a quyete / and of
synguler pit^ / and he hated not the clergy / he wedded the ky^ges daughter of
Portyngale / and in his time whiles that he reigned he made a great co^uocacyon
of princes in Ra^sp^na / for ye incours of ye Turks / and showed unto them yt
now within this.xx. year chryste^dome was made less. ij.C. mile and he warned
them yt they should be ready to resyst him. And the imperyall cite of
Co^stantynople was taken ye same time of y^ mis^yleuynge Turks / and betrayed
by a Ianuens / whom for his labor ye Turk made a king as he promised b^ /
and the fourth day he called him / and did d^ hang hy^ for his deceyt to his
master. And there was great sorrow and weeping among ye christen people for ye
loss of yt noble cite / for many a christen man was slain / and innumerable
were sold / and ye emperor was slain / and for envy ye Turk caused his heed
to be smytten of wha^ he was deed / and almoost al ye faith in ye lord of
greek failed. Nycolas the.v. a Ia nuens was pope after Felix.viij. year. This
Nycolas was chosen at Rome in the place of Eugeny: and yet y^ strife henge
still / and a little and a little they obeyed him And al men meruayled that a
man of so poor a nacyon should obtain against y^ duke of Sauoye ye which was
cosyn and alyed almoost to all the princes of chry^^endome and euerychdue left
him. Than in the year after there was a peace made and Felix resygned / for it
pleased our lord his name to be gloryfyed by an object of the world as was y^
Ianuens in comparyson to the duke the pope. This Nycolas was a master in
divinity and an actyfe man / and a rich man in conceytes and many things that
were fallen he builded again / and all y^ walls of Rome he renewed for dread
of the Turk. And there was a verse made of this unite / and publysshed in the
cite. ^ux fud sit mun dot cessit Felix Nicolao. And that in the year of our
lord. M.CCCC.xlix. The year of grace with a great deuocyo^ was confermed / and
innumerable people went to the apostles setes.

How king Henry the syxth reigned being a child not one year of age / and of
the battle of Vernoyle in Perch.
AFter king Henry y^ fyfth reigned Henry his sone but a child / and not fully
one year of age / whose regne began the first day of September in y^ year of
our lord. M.cccc.xxij. This king being in his cradell was much doubted and
drad because of the great conquest of his fader / and also the wisdom and
guydyng of his uncles the duke of Bedford and the duke of Glocestre. This year
the.xxi. day of October dyed Charles the king of France / and lies buried
at saint Denis. And than was y^ duke of Bedford made regent of France. And y^
duke of Glocestre was made protector and defendour of England. And y^ first
day of March after was sir William Tayllour priest degraded of his preesthode
/ and on y^ morrow after he was brent in smythfelde for heresye. This year sir
James Steward king of scotts married dame Jane the duchess dough te^ of

th(...) was the duke of Alau^son / the duke of (...) the earl of Douglas (...)
ha^ / with many lords of France / and a great company of scotts and
armynackes. And than y^ earl Douglas called y^ duke of Bedforde in scorn John
with the leden sword. And he sent him word again y^ he should find y^ day
y^ his sword was of style. And so y^ ^^yned on both sides and fought (...) me
y^ no man wist who should have y^ better a great while / but at y^ last as god
would y^ victory fell unto y^ english party / for there were slain the earl
Douglas which a lyteil before was made duke of Turo^ / y^ earl of Bou gha^ /
y^ earl of Almarre / y^ earl of Tounar the earl of Vau^tedor / and y^ vycou^te
of Ner bonne / which was one of them y^ slew duke John of Burgoyn knelyng
before the Dolphyn / and many m^^ unto y^ nombre of.x. M. and moo. And there
was taken prisoners y^ duke of Alau^son and many other lords and gentylle^ of
France / but scotts y^ day were slain down right the substance of them
all. The third year of king Henry the syxth the duke, of Glocestre married the
duchess of Hollande / and went over see with her in to Henaud for to take
possessyon of his wy ues enherytau^ce / where he was honou rably received and
taken for lord of the land. But soon after he was feign to return home
again in to England / and left his wife and all his tresour y^ he had
brought with him in a town that is called Mouns in Henaud / which promised for
to be true to him. Notwithstanding they delivered the lady unto y^ duke of
Burgoyn / which sent her to Gaunt / and from thens she escaped in a man's
clothy^ge and came in to zelande to a town of her own called Sirixze / and
from thens she went to a town in Hollande called the Gowe / and there she was
strong enough and withstode y^ foresaid duke of Burgoyne. And soon after y^
duke of Glocestre sent over see in to zelande the lord Fitz water with certain
men of war and archers for to help and socour y^ foresaid duchess of
Holla^de / which londed at a place in zelande called Brewers haven / where the
lords of y^ country came down and fought with him / and in conclusyon he was
feign to withdraw him and his company to y^ see again. But yet he slew and
hurt diverse lords and much people of the same country / and so returned
home again in to England with his company / and prevailed no thing. And also
this same year y^ earl of Salesbury / y^ earl of Suffolk / y^ lord Wyllybe /
and the lord Scales with their retynue laid syege to the cite of Mauns / the
which cite was yolden to them with many other strong towns and castles to y^
nombre of xxxvj. This time all Normandy and a great part of France unto
Drlyaunce was under the obeyssau^ce of y^ king of England / and all the
remenau^t of France was in great trybulacyon and myschefe.

How there was like to have been a great fraye between the cardynal and the duke
of Glocestre. And of the coronacyon of king Henry the syxth both in England
and in France.
IN the fourth year y^ same night y^ the mayre of London John Couentre had
taken his charge / was a great watch in London for a fraye that was between y^
bishop of Wynchestre and the duke of Glocestre protector. etc. For the mayre
with the people of y^ cite would abide by the duke of Glocestre as protector and
defendour of y^ realm. But by labor of lords that went between / and in
especyal by the labor of y^ prince of Portyngale there was a poyntement taken
y^ there was no harm done. And after y^ battle of Vernoyle in Perch the duke
of Bedford came over in to England. And on whytsonday this same year at
Leycestre he dubbed king Henry knight. And forth with y^ said king Henry
dubbed all these knights whose names follows / y^ is to wit / sir Richard

wife went over see to Calays / and a little before went over Henry bishop of
wynchestre. And on our lady day Annu^ciacion in our lady church at Calays the
bishop of Wynchestre when y^ he had songen mass was made Cardinal and he
knelynge before the high awter the duke of Bedford set y^ hatte upon his heed /
and there were his bulls read / as well of his charge as of the reioycynge of
his benefyces spirytuall and temporal. And this same year was great habou^
dau^ce of rain / that the substance of hey and also of corn was destroyed /
for it rayned almost every other day. And this same year y^ good earl of
Salysbury sir Thomas Montague laid syege unto Orlyau^ce / at which syege he
was slay ne with a gonne y^ came out of y^ town / on whose soul god have
mercy / for sith that he was slain englisshe men never gate ne prevailed in
France / but ever after began to lose little and little / till all was lost.
Also this same year a Bryton murdered a good wydowe in her bed without Algate /
which wydowe found him for alms / and he bare away all that she had. And
after this he took the gyrth of holy church at saint Georges in south warke /
and there took the cross and forsware this land. And as he went it happened
y^ he came by the place where he did this cursed deed in y^ subbarbes of London
/ and the women of the same parysshe came out with staves and canell dung and
slew and made an end of hy^ there Notwithstanding y^ constables and many
other men being present for to keep him / for there were many women and had no
pity. Also this same year the duke of Norfolk with many gentylmen and yemen took
his barge the.viij. day of November at saint Mary auerays for to have gone
through London bridge / and through mysguydyng of the barge / it ouerthrewe on
y^ pyles / and many men were drowned / but y^ duke hy^self with two or three lept
upon y^ piles and so were saved with help of men that were above the bridge
with casting down ropes / by the which ropes they saved themself. This same
year on saint Leonardes day king Henry being.vij. year old was crowned at
westminster / at whose crownacyo^ were made.xxxvj. knights This year on saint
Georges day he passed over y^ see to Calays toward France About this time and
before the realm being in great mysery and trybulacyon / the Dolphyn with his
party began to make war and gate certain places / and made distresses upon
englyshmen by y^ mean of his capytayns / y^ is to say / la Here and Poton de
seyntraylles / and in especyall a maid which they named la pucelle de dieu.
This maid rode like a man / and was a valyau^t capitayn among them and took
upon her many great enterprises in so much y^ they had a believe for to have
recovered all their losses by her. Notwithstanding at y^ last after many great
feats / by y^ help and prowess of sir John Luxemburgh which was a noble
capytayn of y^ duke of Burgoyns and many english men pycardes and burgonyons
which were of our party before y^ town of Compyne the.xxiij. day of May the
foresaid pucelle was taken in y^ field armed like a man / and many other
capytayns with her / and were all brought to Roen and there she was put i prison
/ and there she was judged by y^ law to be brent. And than she said y^ she was
with child / where by she was respyted a while. But in co^ clusyo^ it was found
y^ she was not with child / and than she was brent in Roen / and the other
capitayns were put to rau^son and entreated as men of war ben acustomed. And
this same year about Candelmasse Richard hunder a woll packer was dampened for
an heretic and brent at Toure hill. And about mydlent sir Thomas Baggeley
priest and vycarye of Mauen in Essex beside walden was disgraded and dampened
for an heretyke and brent in smythfelde. And also in y^ same year whiles the
king was in France there were many heretykes and loulars y^ had purposed to
make a risyng / and cast bylles in many places. But blyssed be god the
capytayne of them was taken / whose name was William Mau^deuyll a weuer of
Abyndon and baylyf of the same town which named himself Jack Sharp of
wigmoreslonde in wales. And afterward he was byheded at the foresaid Abyndon
in the whytsone weke on the tewesday. This same year y^.vj. day of December
king Henry the.vj. was crowned king of France at Paris in y^ church of our
lady with great solempnite / there being present the Cardynall of England / the
duke of Bedford / and many other lords of France and of England. And after
this crownacyon and great feast holden at Paris / the king returned from thens
to Roen / and so toward Calays / and the.ix. day of February lo^ded at Dover
whom all the comyns of Kent met at beramdoun between Canterbury and Dover
all in reed hodes / and so came forth till he came to y^ black heth / where he
was met with the Mayre John wells with all the crafts of London / clothed all
in white / and so they brought hy^ unto London the.xxj. day of the same
month. And this same year was a restraynt of the wolles of Calays made by y^
soudyours / because they were not paid of their wages / wherefore y^ duke of
Bedford regent of France being than capytayne came to Calays the tewesdaye in
the eester weke. And on the morrow after many soudyours of the town were
arested and put in to ward. And in y^ same weke he rode to Terewyn / and by
the mean of y^ bishop of Terewyn he wedded the earls daughter of saint Poule
/ and came again to Calays. And the.xj. baye of June on saint Barnabees day
there were four soudyours of Calays that were chief causers of the restraynt
heded / that is to wit / John Maddeley John Lunday / Thomas Palmer / and
Thomas Talbot / and an hundred and.x. banysshed the town that same time / and
before were banysshed an hundred and.xx. soudyours. And on mydsomer even after
came the lord regent and his wife to London.

About this time pope Martyn dyed / and after him Eugenye the fourth was pope.
This man was prasybly chosen in Rome by the Cardynalles and was very and
indubytate pope. But shortly after he was put and erpulsed out of Rome / in
such manner that he was feign to flee naked. In this same time was the concyle
of Basylye / to which concyle he was tho cyted to come. And because he came
not / they deposed him But he rought not ne set not thereby but gate the cite of
Rome and abode still pope xvij. year. This year about whycson tide the
heretykes of Praghe were destroyed. For at two Iourueys were destroyed of them
moo than.xxij. M. with their capitaynes / that is to wyce Procapius / Saplico /
and Lupus presbyter Also there was taken on live master Peers clarke an
englyshman and an heretyke. Also this same year was a great frost and a strong
during.xj. wekes for it began on saint Katheryns even and lasted unto saint
Scolasticaes day in February. In which time y^ vyntage that came fro Burdeur
came on shoters hill. This year was the counseyle of Arras / and a great trayte
between the king of England and the king of France where was assembled many
great lords of both parties / at which counseyle was offered to ye king of
England great things / by the mean of a legate that came fro Rome which was
cardynall of saint cross / which offers were refused by the Cardynall of
England and other lords that were there for ye king Wherefore ye duke of
Burgoyne which long had been english sworn / forsook our party and
returned frensshe by the mean of the foresaid legate / and made a peace with ye
frensshe king / receyuynge of the king for recompensynge of his faders death ye
count of po^tou / the lordshyp of Macon / with much other as is specyfyed in
the said treaty. And so our ambassadors came home again in worse case than
they went out. For they lost there the duke of Burgoyn which had been with his
burgonyons and picardes a synguler help in all ye conquest of Normandy and of
France. This same year was a great battle on the sea between the Ienewes and
the king of Aragon / of which battle yt Ienewes had ye victory / for they
took ye king of Aragon / the king of Nauerne / and the great master of saint
James in Galyse / with. iij.C. knights and squyers and much other people. And
this was on saint Dominyks day. And this same year were seen three sons at
ones / and anon followed ye threfolde governance in ye church / that is to
wit / of Eugeny / of the concyle / and of neutralite. Also this same year
M.CCCC.xxxiiij. was a passing great wind / by which steples / houses / and
trees were overthrown. About this time was an holy maid in Holland called
Lidwith / which lived only by miracle / not etyng any meet. This year the
duke of Burgoyn began his order at Lyle of the golden Flees / and ordained
certain knights of ye same order / and made statutes and ordynau^ces much
according unto the order of the garter. Also this same year the frenshmen had
enterprysed to have stolen Calays in ye fysshinge time / for many botes of
france had safe condytes to come to Calays for to take herynge. And the
soudyours of ye town had a custom to come to ye church and leave their staves
standing at ye church door which staves the frenshment that were arrayed like
fisshers had purposed to have taken / and so for to have won the town / but
one of them lay with a common woman ye night before / and he told to her their
counseyle. And she on yt morrow told it to the lewtenaunt / which forth with
commanded yt every man should keep his wepen in his hand / sakeryng time and
other. And when the frensshe men perceived this that they were myspoynted /
they sailed straight to Deep / and stale and took that town. And on Newyeres
even after they took Harflet And thus the englyshmen began to lose a little and
a little in Normandye.

How Calays and Guynes were besyeged by ye duke of Burgoyn / and how they were
rescowed by ye duke of Glocestre.
THis year through all England was a great noise how the duke of Burgoyne would
come and besyege Calays / wherefore ye earl of Mortayn with his army yt he had
for to have gone with in to france was contremau^ded and charged that he should
go to Calays / which was at that time well vitayled and ma^ned / for sir John
Ratclife was lewtenau^t of the king in ye town / and the baron of Dudley
lewtenau^t of the castle. And the.ix. day of July the duke of Burgoyn with all
ye power of flau^dres and much other people came before Calays / and set his
syege about the town / and every town of flau^dres had their tents by
themself. And this syege endured three wekes. In the mean while the duke of
Glocestre being protector of england took ye most part of the lords of
england and went over the sea to Calays for to rescowe the town / or to fight
with the duke and his host if they would abide. This time London and every
good town in england sent over the sea to this rescowe certain people well
arrayed of the best and chosen men for the war. And the second day of August
the foresaid duke of Glocestre arrived at Calays with all his army and.v.
hundred ships and mo^. And the duke of Burgoyne and all his host yt lay in
the syege / as soon as they espied the sails in the sea / before they
approached Calays haven / suddenly in a morning departed from ye syege / leuyng
behind him much stuff and vytayle / and fled in to flaundres and pycardye.
And in like wise did the syege yt lay before Guynes where as they of Guynes
took the great gonne of brass called Dygeon / and many other great gonnes and
serpentynes. And when the duke of Glocestre was arrived with all his host / he
went in to flaundres / and was there.xij. days and did but little harm /
except that he brent two fair vyllages Poperynge and Belle and other houses
which were of no strength / and so he returned home again And this same year
ye king of Scotlo^de besyeged Rokesburgh with much people. But sir Rafe Gray
departed from the castle and ordained for rescowe. But as soon as the king of
Scotlonde understood of his departing / suddenly he brake his syege and went
his way / and left much ordinance behind him / where he gate no worship.
In this same year the second day of January queen Katherin which was ye
kings mother and wife to king Henry the fyfth dyed and departed out of this
world / and was brought ryally through London / and so to westmynster / and
there she lies worshipfully buried in our ladies thapell. Also this year the
fourth day of January fell down the gate with the toure on it on London
bridge toward Southwarke with two arches and all yt stood thereon. This same
year was a great treaty holden between Graueling and Calays between the king
and the duke of Burgoyn / where for the king was ye Cardinal of England / the
duke of Norfolk / and many other lords. And for the duke of Burgoyn was the
duches^e having full power of her lord as regent and lady of his lands /
where was taken by the advise of both parties an abstinence of war for a
certain time in ye name of ye duchess and not of the duke because he had gone
from his oath and legeau^ce that he had made to king Henry / therefore the king
never would write no appoint to have to do with him after but all in the
duchess name. Also this same year queen Jane dyed the second day of July /
which had been wise to king Henry the fourth / and was carried fro Bermondsey
to Canterbury where she lies buried by king Henry her husbonde. This same
year dyed all ye lions in the Toure of London the which had not ben seen many
years before.

How Owen a squire of wales yt had wedded queen Katherin was arested and of the
scysme between Eugeny and Feli^.
IN the.xvi. year of king Henry dyed Sygysmonde Emperor of Almayn and knight
of the garter / whose entereme^t ye king kept at saint Paul's in London ryally
/ where was made a ryall hearse / and the king in his estate cladde in blewe
was a^ even at Dirige and on ye morrow at mass. and^. And after him was elect
and chosen Albert duke of Ostryche which had wedded Sygismondes daughter for
to be Emperor. This man was taken and received to be king of Beme and Hungary
because of his wife yt was Sygismondes daughter / which left none other heir
after him. This Albert was emperor but one year / for he was poisoned / and so
dyed Some say he dyed of a flix / but he was a virtuous man and piteful / so
much yt all the people that knew him said that ye world was not worthy to
have his presence. This year one Owen a squire of wales a man of low birth
(which had many a day before secretly wedded queen Katheryn / and had by
her.iij. sons and one daughter) was taken and commanded to Newgate to prison
by ye duke of Glocestre protector of the realm. And this year he brake the
prison by the mean of a priest that was his chapelayn / and after was taken
again by my lord Bemond and brought again to Newgate / and afterward
delivered at large / and one of his sons afterward was made earl of Rychemond
/ and an other earl of Penbroke / and the third a monk of westminster /
which monk dyed soon after. This same year also on Newyeres day at Baynardes
castle fell down a stake of wode suddenly at after none and slew three men
myscheuously / and foul hurt other. Also at Bedford on a sherthursdaye were
xviij. men murdered without stroke by falling down of a stayre as they came out
of ye comin hall / and many sore hurt. In the.xviij. year sir Richard Beauchamp
the good earl of warwyke dyed at Roen he being ye time lewtenau^t of ye king
in Normandy / and from thens his body was brought to warwyke / where
worshypfully he lies in a new chapel on ye south side of ye quere. Also this
year was a great derth of corn in all england / for a busshel of where was
worth.xl. pens in many places of england / and yet had they not enough /
wherefore Steven Brown that time Mayre of London sent in to Pruce and brought
to London certain ships laden with rye / which did much good to ye poor
people / for corn was so scarce in england yt in some places of england
poor people made them breed of fern rotes. This year ye general concyle of
Basilie deposed Eugenye / and they chose Felix yt was duke of Sauoy / and tha^
began ye scysme which endured unto ye year of our lord. M.cccc.xlviij. This
Felix was a devout pry^ce and saw his sons sone / and after lived an holy life
/ and was chosen pope of ye concyle of Basile / and Eugeny deposed. And so ye
scysme was long time / and this Felix had but little obedience because of ye
neutralite / for ye most part and well nygh all christe^dom obeyed and reputed
Eugeny for very pope: god knows who was very pope of them both / for both
occupied during Eugenyes life. This year sir Richard wyche vicare of Hermete
sworth was degraded of his preesthode at Paul's and brent at tour hill as for
an heretyke / on saint Botulphes day / how well at his death he died a good
christian man / wherefore after his death much people came to ye place where he
was brent and offered and made a hepe of stones / and set up a cross oftre and
held hy^ for a saint till ye mayr and shreues by ye ky^ges commandment and
bishops destroyed it / and made there a dung hill. Also this year ye shreues of
London fet out of saint Martyns ye grand.v. persons / which afterward were
restored again to ye sentwary by ye kings Justices. After Albert ye third
Frederyk was chosen emperor. This Frederyk duke of Osteryke was long emperor
/ and dyfferred to be crowned at Rome because of the scysme / but after ye
unite was had / he was crowned with the imperyall dyademe with great glory and
triu^phe of pope Nicolas ye fourth. This was a peasyble man / quyete and of
singular patience / not hatyng ye church / he wedded ye king of Portyngales
daughter.

How the duchess of Glocestre was arested for treason / and committed to
perpetual prison in the isle of Man / and of the death of master Roger
Bolyngbroke.
IN this year Elenore Cobham duchess of Glocestre was arested for certain
points of treason laid against her / where upon she was examyned in saint
Stephens chapel at westmynster before ye archebysshop of Canterbury / and
there she was enjoined to open penance for to go through chepe berynge a taper
in her hand / and after to perpetual prison in the isle of Man / under the
keeping of sir Thomas stanley. Also yt same time was arested master Thomas
Southwell a chanon of westmynster / master John Hume a chapelayn of the said
lady / master Roger Bolyngbroke a clarke vsyng nygromancy / and one Margery
iourdemayn called ye wytche of Eye beside westmynster. These were arested as
for being of counsel with the said duchess of Glocestre. And as for master
Thomas southwell he dyed in ye Toure the night before he should have been reyned
on ye morrow. For he himself said yt he should dye in his bed / and not by
justices. And in the.xx. year master John Hume and master Roger Bolingbroke
were brought to ye gylde hall in London and there before ye Mayre ye lords and
the^e Justices of England were reyned and dampened both to be drawn hanged
and quartred / but master John Hume had his chartre and was pardoned by ye
king / but master Roger was drawn to Tyburne / where he confessed yt he dyed
gyltles / and never had trespaced in that he dyed for. Notwithstanding he was
hanged heded and quartred / on whose soul god have mercy. And Margery
iourdemayn was brent in smythfelde. Also this year was a great fraye in London
in Fleet street by night time / between men of court and men of London / and
diverse men slain and some hurt / and one Herbotell was chief causer of ye
mysgouernaunce and fraye. Also this year at choosing of ye Mayre of London the
comyns named Roberte Clopton and Raulyn Hollande tayllour. And ye aldermen took
Robert Clopton and brought him at ye right hand of ye Mayre as ye custom is.
And than certain tayllours and other hand crafty men cried nay nay not this
man but Raulyn Holla^d / wherefore y^ Mayre that was Padysly sent them yt so
tried to Newgate / where they abode a great while and were punysshed. In this
same year were diverse ambassadors sent in to Guyan for a marriage for the
king for ye earls daughter of Armyna^ the which was concluded / but by the
means of ye earl of Suffolk it was let and put aparte. And after this ye said
earl of Suffolk went over see in to France and there he treated ye marriage
between the king of England and ye kings daughter of Cecyle and of
Iherusalem. And ye near year that marriage was fully concluded by which
marriage the king should deliver to her fader the duchy of Ang^o and the erledom
of Main which was the key of Normandy. Than departed ye earl of Suffolk with
his wife and diverse lords and knights in the most ryall estate yt might be
out of England with new shares and palfreys which went through Chepe / and
so went over the sea / and received her / and sythen brought her in the lent
after unto Hampton / where she londed and there was ryally received. And on
Candelmasse even before by a great tempest of thondre and lyghtnynge at after
none Paul's steple was set on fire in the mids of y^ shafte in the tymbre /
which was quenched by force of labor and specially by y^ morowmasse priest of
y^ Bow in chepe / which was thought impossyble / save only the grace of god.
This year was y^ earl of Stafford made and create duke of Buckyngham / y^ earl
of warwyk duke of warwyk / the earl of dorset markys of dorset / and ye earl of
Suffolk was made markys of Suffolk.

How king Henry wedded queen Margarete / and of her crownacyon.
THis year king Henry married at South wyk queen Margarete / and she came to
London the.xviij. day of May / and by the way all the lords of England
received her worshipfully in diverse places / and in especyal the duke of
Glocestre / and on the black heth ye mayre with the aldermen / and all ye
crafts in blewe gowns browdred with ye deuyse of their craft / yt they might
be known met with her with reed hodes and brought her to London / where were
diverse pagentes and countenau^ces of diverse hystoryes / showed in diverse places
of ye cite ryally and costly. And the.xxx. day of May the foresaid queen was
crowned at westmynster. And there was Justes three days during within ye
sentwary before the abbey. This year ye pryour of Kylmayn appeled ye earl of
Vrmond of treason / which had a day assygned to them for to fight in
smythfelde / and the lystes were made and the field dressed. But when it came
to point / the king commanded yt they should not fight / but took ye quarrel
in to his hand. And this was done at the instau^ce and labor of certain
prechours and doctors of London as master Gylbert worthyngton person of
saint Andrews in holborne and other. Also this year came a great em bassadour
in to England out of France for to have concluded a perpetual peace but in
co^clusyon it turned unto a trewse of a year. About this time dyed saint
Barnardyn a gray friar / which began the new reformacyon of y^ order in many
places / in so much that they yt were reformed ben called Obseruantes / which
Obserua^tes ben greatly encreaced in ytalye and in Almayne. This Bernardyn was
canonysed by pope Nicolas the.v. in the year of our lord. M.cccc.l. Ioh^es de
Capistrano was his dyseyple / which profyted much to ye reformacyon of y^
order / for whom god has showed many a fair miracle. Also here is to be
noted y^ from this time forward king Henry never profyted ne went forward but
fortune began to turn from him on all sides / as well in France / Normandy /
Guyen / as in England. Some men hold opinion that king Henry gave co^myssyon
plenarly to sir Edward Hull / sir Robert Roos dene of saint Seuerynes / and
other / to conclude a marriage for him with y^ earl of Armynakes sister / which
was promised as it was said and concluded / but afterward it was broken and he
wedded queen Margarete as before is said / which was a dear marriage for the
realm of England. For it was known verily that for to have her was delivered
the duchy of Angeo and the earl dom of Main / which was the key of Normandy
for the frensshmen to enter. And about this y^ said Markys of Suffolk asked in
plain parliament a.xv. and an half to fetch her out of france. Loo what a
marriage was this / as to y^ comparison of ye other marriage of Armynak For there
should have be^ delivered so many castles and towns in Guyan / and so much
gold should have been given with her / y^ all england should have been thereby enry
(...) / but (...) fell / wherefore (...) ought (...) because of (...) / (...)
for marriage of (...) (...)rets w(...) (...) has (...) england had / by losyng
of Normandy and Guyan / (...) (...)nge of (...) against their pry(...) (...)
lords / what (...) lords / what murdre and sleynge of them / what feldes
(...) and (...) many y^ (...) a man has (...) his (...) / (...) co^clucyon y^
king de (...) / and the queen wther sone ^^yne to (...) in to Scotland / and
from thens in to France / and so to (...) y^ she came first fro. Many men dem^
that the brekynge of ye kings promise to the sister of ye earl of Armynak was
cause of his great loss and aduersite.

How the duke of Glocestre the kings uncle was arested at ye parlyament of
Bury / and of his death / and how Angeo and Main was delivered.
IN the.xxv. year of King Henry was a parlyame^t a^ Bury called saint Edmondes
Bury / about which was commanded all the comyns of ye country to be there in
their most best de(...) syble array for to wait upon ye King. To which
parlyament came the duke of Glorestre Vmfrey the Kings uncle which had been
pro^^etour of england all the noneage of ye king. And a(...) (...) ter as he
was in his lod(...) was arested by y^ vycou^te be(...) of england / who me act
(...) y^ duke of Buckyngham / and m(...) (...) lords. And forthwt all his
ser(...)es were commanded to depart from him / and. xxxi^. of y^ chief of
them were a(...) sent to diverse pry(...) / and (...) after this say^ arest y^
said duke was on y^ (...) on whose soul god haute mercy. But how he dyed and
in what manner th(...)taynte is not known / some said he dyed for sorrow / some
said he was murdered between two feder beds / some said y^ a spytte was put in
his fou^dament / but how he dyed god knows / to whom no thing is hyd. And
thus deed he was laid open yt all men might se him / and so both lords and
knights of y^ shyre with burgeyses came (...) saw hy^ lie deed / but wou^dene
token could they not perceive how he dyed. Here may m^ mark what this world
is. This duke was a noble man and a great clerk / and ruled worshypfully y^
realm to ye Kings behofe / and never could be found fault in hy^ / but
(...)uy of them yt were governors and had promy sed ye duth y of Angeo and the
(...)dome of Main causen ye destruccyon of this noble man / for they drad yt
he would have empesshed y^ delyueraunce / and after they sent his body to saint
Albons with certain lyghtes to be buried / and so sir Ge(...)ays of Clefton had
than ye charge to co^uay y^ corpse / and so it was buried at saint Albons in the
abbey. And five persons of his household were sent to London / and there were
they reyned and Judged to be drawn and hanged and also quartred. Of whom y^
names were / sir Roger chamberlayn a knight / Mydelton a squire / Herbard a
squire / Arthur a squier / and Richard Nedha^ / which.v. prosones were drawn
fro ye toure of London through che pe to tyburne / and there ^a^ged and let
down quycke / and than stryped to have b^heded and quarted / and than y^
Markys of Suffolk she wed there for them y^ kings pardon under his great
seal^ so they were pardoned of the remenau^t of the execucyon / and had their
lives / and so they were brought again to London / and after freely deliver to.
Thus began great trouble in this realm of England for the death of this noble
duke of Glocestre / and an the comyns of y^ realm began for to murmr for it
/ and were not content. After ye pope Eugeny was deed Nycolas the.v. was elect
pope. This Nycolas was chosen for Eugeny yet hanging ye ^eysme / notwtstandyng
he gate the obedyence of all chryste^ realms / for after he was elect and
sacred pope / certain lords of france and of england were scut in to Sauoy
to pope Felix / for to entreat him to sease of ye pap^ry. And by the special
labor of y^ bishop of Norwyche and the lord of saint John's he seized y^
second year after y^ pope Nycolas was sacred / and y^ said Felix was ma de
legate of france and cardynal of Sauoy And he resygned y^ hole papa^y to
Nycolas / and after lived an holy life and dyed an holy man / and as it is said
almighty god shows miracles for him. This was y^ xxiij. scysme between Eugeny
and Felix / and dured.xvj. year. The cause was this / ye general concyle of
Basyle deposed Eugeny which was only pope and induby tate / for as much as
he observed not and kept ye decrees and statutes of ye concyle of Constance /
as it is said before / neither he cought not to give obedyence to ye general
concyle in no manner wise / wherefore arose a great alteracion among writers of
this matter (pro et co^tra) which can not accord unto this day / one party
says yt the concyle is above ye pope / and y^ other party says nay / but ye
pope is above y^ co^cyle. God blissed above al thing give and grant his peace
in holy church spouse of Christ. Amen. This Nicolas was of Iene come^ of low
degree / a doctor of d(...)te / an actyf man / he reed^fyed many places y^
were broken and ruynous / and did do make a wall about y^ palace / and made y^
wall new about Rome for dread of y^ turks. And y^ people won (...) greatly
meruayled of y^ ceasynge and (...) of pope Felix to pope Nycolas / considering
that (...) was (...) man of so (...)ly (...) was of (...) to all t^^ m(...)
(...) christen (...) / wherefore there was a verse publysshed / as (...) is
said.

How sir F(...)is A(...) to (...) Fogyers in Normandye. And of y^ loss of
Constantynople by the Turk.
IN the year of (...) Henry. xxvi^ being tree(...) France and England / a
knight of ye english party named sir Fra^ceys Aragonois took a town in
Normandy (...) Fogyers against the trewse / of which taking began much sorrow
and loss / for this was the occasion by y^ which the frenshmen gate all
Normandy. About this time the cite of Co^stantynople / which was the imperyal
cite of all greece was taken by the Turks infydeles / which was betrayed as
some hold opinion / and the emperor taken and slain / and the ryall church
of saint Sophia robbed and spoiled / and the (...)s and images and the rode
drawn about y^ streets / which was done in despyte of the christen faith /
and soon after all chryste^ faith in Greece perisshed and ceased. There were
many christen men slain / and innumerable sold and put in captivity. By the
taking of this cite the Turk greatly was enhau^ced in pride / and a great
loss to all christendom. In the.xxviij. year was a parlyame^t holden at
Westmynster / and from thens adiourned to the black freres (...) London / and
after Christmas to Westmynster again. And this same year Ro^erte of Cane a man
of the west country (...) a few ships took a great flete of ships comyng^
out of ye ^ay laden with (...) which ships were out of prince / (...)u^ders /
(...) / (...): and brought them to H^mpton / wherefore the march auntes of
England being in Flau^dres were arested in Bruges / Ipre / and other places
and might not be delivered (...) their dettes disch ^uged till they had made
apoyntment for to pay y^ (...) of those ships / which was paid by y^
merchants of the staple every penny. And in like wise the marchu^tes and
goods being in Da(...) were also arested / and made great amends. This same
year the frensshmen in a morning took by a train the town of Pount de larche
/ and therein the lord Fauconbrydge was taken prisoner. And after y^ in
D(...)er Rom was taken and lost / being therein sir Edmond duke of Somerset /
the earl of Shrewesbury / which by a poyntment left pledges / and lost all
Normandy and came home in to England. And during y^ said parliament y^ duke of
Suffolk was arested / and sent in to y^ Coure / and there he was a month /
and after the king did do fetch him out / for which cause all y^ comyns were
in a great rumor / what for the delyuerau^ce of Angeo and Mayn / and after
lesynge of all Normandy / and in especyall for y^ death of y^ good duke of
Glocestre / in so much in some places me^ gadred and made them capytayns / as
Blewberde and other / which were taken and put to death. And than the said
parlyament was adiourned to Leycestre. And thy^der y^ king brought with him y^
duke of Suffolk. And when y^ comyns understood y^ he was out of the Coute and
comen thither / they desired for to have execucion on them y^ were cause of the
delyuerau^ce of Normandy / and had been (...) of the death of the duke of
Glocestre / and had sold Gascoyn and Guyen / of which they named to be gylty
y^ duke of Suffolk as chief / the lord Say / y^ bishop of Salisbury /
(...)yell and many mo^. And for to appease the comyns the duke of Suffolk was
exiled out of England for.v. year. And so during the parlyament he went in to
Norfolk / and there took shyppyng for to go out of y^ realm of England in to
France. And this year as he sailed on y^ see a ship of war called the
Nycolas of the toure met with his ship and found him therein / whom they
took out and brought him in to their ship to the master and to the capytayn
and there he was examyned and at y^ last judged to death. And so they put him in
a caban and his chapelayn with him f(...) to shryue him. And ye done they brought
hy^ in to Dover rode / and set hy^ in to y^ bote / and there smote of his heed
/ and brought y^ body on land upon ye sands / and set ye heed thereby And this
was done ye first day of May Leo what auayled him all his (...)rau^te of
Normandy etc. And here ye may here how he was rewarded for ye death of the duke
of Glocestre. Thus began sorrow upon sorrow / and death for death.

How this year was the insurreccyon in Kent of the comyns / of whom Iarke Cade
an Irysshe man was capytayne.
THe year of our lord. M.cccc. and.l. was the great grace of ye Iubile at Rome
/ where was great pardon / in so much y^ from all places in chrystendom great
multitude of people resorted thither. And this year was a great assemble and
gaderynge together of the comyns of Kent in great nombre / and made an
insurreccyon / and rebelled against the king and his laws / and ordained them
a capytayne called Johan Cade an Irysshe man / which named himself Mortymer /
cosyn to ye duke of york. And this capytayn held these men together / and made
ordynaunces among them / and brought them to the black h^th / where he made a
byll of p(...)yons to the king and his counseyle / and showed what (...)ties
and oppressyons the poor comyns suffered / and all under color for to come to
his above / and he had a great multitude of people. And the.xvii. day of June
the king and many lords / capytayns and men of warte went toward him to y^
black heth. And when the capytayne of kent understood the coming of the king
with so great puyssan^ce / he withdrewe him and his people to Seuenoke a little
village. And the.xxviij. day of June he being withdrawn and gone / the king
came with his army set in order and embatayled to y^ black heth. And by advise
of his counseyle sent sir Vmfrey Stafford knight and Willyam Stafford squire
two valyau^t capytaynes / with certain people for to fight with y^ capytayne /
and to take him and bring him and his accessaryes to the king / which went to
Seuenoke / and there the capytayn with his felawshyp met with them / and fought
against them / and in co^clusyon slew them both / and as many as abode and
would not yield them were slain. During this scarmysshe fell a great
varyau^ce among the lords men and common people being on black heth against
their lords and capitaynes saying plainly y^ they would go unto y^ capytayn
of kent / to assyst and help him but if they might have execucyon on y^
traitors being about y^ king / where to the king said nay. And they said
plainly that the lord Say tresourer of England / and the bishop of Salysbury
/ the baron of Dubby / the abbot of Glocestre / Danyell / and Treuilian and
many ^to were traitors and worthy to be deed Wherefore to please the lords
meyny and also some of y^ kings house y^ lord Say was arested and sent to y^
toure of London. And than y^ king heryng tidings of the beth and
ouerthrowynge of the Staf(...) / he withdrewe him to London / and (...) to
^elyngworth / for y^ king (...) lords burst not trust their own household
men. Than after that the capytayne had had this victory upon y^ Staffordes /
anon he took (...) sallet and his brigandynes full of gylte nails / (...)
also his (...) and Arrayed him like a lord and capytayne / and resorted with
all his (...) and also moo than he had before to the black hethe again. To
whom came the archebysshop of Caunterbury / and the duke of Bokyugham to the
black hethe / and spoke with him. And as it was said they found him wytty in
his talkyng and in his request. And so they departed. And the third day of
July he came and entered into London with all his people / and there did make
cries in the kings name and in his name / that no man should rob ne take no
manner of goods but if he paid for it. And came riding through the cite in
great pride and smote his sword upon London stone in Canmyk street. And he
being in the rite sent to the toure for to have the lord Say / and so they
fette him and brought hy^ to the Gyldhall before the Mayre and the aldermen /
where y^ he was examyned. And he said he would and ought to be judged by his
peers. And y^ comyns of Kent took him by force fro the Mayre and officers y^
kept him / and took him to a priest to shryue him / and or he might be half
shryuen they brought him to the standard in Chep^: and there smote of his heed
on whose soul god have mercy. Amen. And thus dyed the lord Say tresourer of
England. After this they set his heed upon a spear / and bare it all about the
cite. And y^ same day about mile end (...) mer was vyheded. And the day
before at after none the capytayne with a certain of his men went to Philyp
Malpas house / and robbed him / and took away much good. And from thens he
went to saint Margarete patyns to one (...) ^ (...) which (...) of their (...)

(...) comyns of y^ (...) concluded to (...) the capytayn and his ^oost / and
sent to the lord Scales to the Coure / and (...) a capytayne of Nor (...) /
that they walde y^ night assail the captain (...) them of kent. And so they
did / and came to London bridge or the capytayne had any knowledge thereof / and
there they fought with them that kept the bryoge. And the (...) men went to

and ^^de them of London to (...) / and slew many of them / and this (...) all

house. (...) they were all departed and gone / there were proclamacyons made in
^ent / Southsex and other places / that what man could take the capitayn quycke
or deed shield have a thousand mark. And after this / one Alexander Iden a
squire of kent took him in a garden in Southsex. And in y^ taking John Cade
the capytayn was slain / and after byh^ded / and his heed set on London
bridge. And than anon after the king came in to kent / and did do sit his
Iustyees at Caunterbury / and inquyred who were chief causers of this ins(...).
And there were. (...). men judged to death in one day / and in other places
^oo. And fro thens the king went in to Southsex and in to the west (...) /
where alytell before was (...) y^ bishop of Salysbury. And this same year were
so many judged to death / that. (...) hedes stood upon London bridge at ones.

Of the field that y^ duke of york took at Brentheth in Kent. And of the birth
of prince Edward. And of the (...)st battle at saint Alvons / where (...)
duke of Somerset was slain.
IN the.xxx. ^ere of y^ king y^ duke of york came out of the march of Wales
with the earl of D(...)shyre and the lord Cobham and a gr^te puyssaunce for
reformacyon of certain (...)ties and wrongs / and also to have Iustr^e upon
certain lords being about the king / and took a feide at Brentheth beside
Dartforde in Kent / which was a strong field / for which cause the king with
all the lords of y^ ^onde went unto the black heth with a great and a strong
multitude of people armed and ordeyn^^ for the war in y^ best wise. And when
they had mustred on the beth / certain lords were tho sent to him for (...)
and make apoyntment with him / (...) were the bishop of Ely / the bishop of
W(...) the earls of Salysbury and (...). And they concluded that the duke of
Somerset should be had to ward and to answer to such artycles as the duke of
york should put on him / and than the duke of york should break his field and
come to the king / which was all promised by the king. And so the king co^
mau^ded y^ the duke of Somerfet should be had into ward. And than y^ duke of
york brake up his field and came to the king. And when he was come contrary to
the promise before made / the duke of Somerset was present in y^ filde awaytynge
and chief about the king / and made the duke of york tide before as a
prisoner through London / and after they would have put hy^ in hold. But a
noise arose y^ the (...) of March his sone was coming with.x. M. men toward
London / wherefore the king and his counseyle feted. And than they concluded
that the duke of york should depart at his own will. About this time began
great dyuysyon in Spruce between the great master and the knights of the
duche order / which were lords of y^ country / for the comyns and towns
rebelled against the lords / and made so great war that at the last they
called y^ king of Pole to be their lord / the which king came and was
worshypfully received / and laid syege to y^ castle of Marienburgh / which
was y^ chief castle of strength of all the lord / and wanne it / and drove
out the master of D^nske / and all other places of that land. And so they y^
had been lords many years lost all their seygnourye and possessions in those
lands. And in y^ year of the incarnacyon of our lord. M. (...). ^iij. on
saint Edwardes day / y^ queen Marg(...) was delivered of a fair (...) /
which was named Edward. That same day John Norman was (...) to be Mayre of
London. And the day that (...) ^ the (...) ^ which (...) that time they (...)

the conclusyons taken (...) y^ king and the duke of york at B(...)th / the
duke of Somerset went (...) / but abod^ about y^ king / and had great rule /
and anon after he was made capytayn of Calays and ruled the king and his
^^alme as he would / wherefore y^ great lords of th(...) alme / and also y^
comyns were not (...). For which cause y^ duke of (...) of Warwyk / y^ (...)
of Salysbury / (...) many knights and squyers / and much other people came to
remeue y^ said duke of Somerset and other fro y^ king. And (...) king heryng
of their coming / thought by his counsel to have gone westwarde and not for
to have met with them / and had with him the duke of Somerset / the duke of
Bokyngham / y^ (...) of Stafford / y^ (...) of Northumberlonde / y^ lord
Clyfford / and many other. And what time that the duke of york and his (...)
understood that the king was departed (...) these lords from London / anon he
changed his way and costed the country / (...) came to saint Albons the.
xxii^. (...) of May / and there met with the king / to whom the king sent
certain lords / and desired (...) to keep the peace and depart / but (...)
syon while they treated on y^ one side y^ earl of Warwyk with the March(...) and

sit aparte / and might not rule as they did before. And this same year dyed
pope Nycolas the fyfth. And after him was Calixt y^ third. This (...) was a
Catalane / and the art (...) of him shall be showed here after. In this same
(...) fell (...) London against (...) because a yo(...) man took (...) from

this great rumor / af fraye and robbery enswed of his fryst meuynge to the
Lombarde / departed and went to Westmynster to sent wary / or (...) had cost

for this cause And a little before y^ duke of york was sent for to (...) / and

where they were almoost and y^ earl of war(...) also / and should have been
destroyed if they had not seen well to.

How the lord (...) was taken by the (...) of Sa(...) / and of the (...) of
(...).
THis year were taken four great fysshes between Ereth and London that one was
called Mors marine / the second was a sword fysshe / and the other twain
were whales. In this same year for certain frayes done in ye north country
between the lord Egremond and the earl of Salysburyes sons / the said lord
Egremond whom they had taken was conde^pned in a great sum of money to ye
said earl of Salysbury / and therefore he was committed in to prison in Newgate
in London / where when he had been a certain space he brake ye prison / and
three prisoners with him / and escaped and went his way. Also this year ye earl
of warwyk and his wife went to Calays with a fair felawship and took
possessyon of his office. About this time was a great reformacyon of many
monasteryes of relygyon in diverse parties of ye world / which were reformed
after the first institucyon / and co^tynued in many places. This same year was
a great battle in ye marches between the land of Hungry and Turkey at a place
called Septedrad / where innumerable turks were slain more by miracle than by
man's hand / for only ye hand of god smote them. Saint John of Capistrane
was there present / and provoked ye christen people being than aferde for to
pursue after ye Turks / where an infynyte multitude were slain and destroyed.
And the Turks said yt a great nombre of armed men followed them / yt they were
aferd to turn again / and they were holy angels. This same year ye prisoners
of New gate in London brake their prison / and went upon the ledes and fought
against them of the cite / and kept the gate a long while / but at ye last
the cite gate ye prison on them / and than they were put in fetters and ^^ens /
and were sore punysshed in ensam (...) of other. In this year also there was a
great erthquake in N^ples / in so much that there perisshed.xi. M. people that
sanke therein to the e^th. Also in the year.xxxvj. saint Osmond sometime
bishop of Salisbury was ^anonysed at Rome by pope Calixt / and the.xvj. day
of July he was translated at Salysbury by the bishop of Caunterbury and many
other bishops. And in August after sir P^ers de Bresay Senesshall of Normandy
with the capytayn of Dep^ and many other capytayns and men of war went to the sea with a great Navy / and came in to the downs by night. And on the morrow
^ely before day they londed and came to Sandwiche / both by land and water /
and took ye town / and ry^^ed and despoy led it / and ^oke many prisoners /
and left the town all bare / which was a rich place and much good therein /
and ladde with them many rich prisoners. In this same year in many places of
France / Almayn Fla^idres / Hollande and (...) / children gadred them togider
by great co^panyes for to go on pilgrimage to saint Myghels mount in Normandy /
which came fro far countries / whereof y^ people meruayled. And many supposed
that some wicked spirit moved them to do so / but it dured not long because
of the long way / and also for lack of vytayle as they went. In this year
Reynold Pecocke bishop of Chestre was ^o^de an herety ke / and the third day
of (...) was (...) at Lam^^th (...) of the archebysshop of (...) / and many
other bishops / doctors and lords (...)all / and his ^okes (...). Ye have
herd before (...) ^or des were (...) at saint (...) / wh(...) fore was always a
grutchy^ge and ^r^th had by the heirs of them that wh(...) slain against the
duke of york / the r^^e of Warwycke / and the (...) of (...)ry / wherefore the
king by the (...) of his counsel sent for them to London to which place
the duke of York came the.xxvj. day of January with.iiii.C. men / and lodged
hy^ at Baynardes castle in his own place. And ye.xv. day of January came the
earl of Salisbury with v.C. men / and was lodged in therber his own place. And
than came the duke of Excestre and of Somerset with. viij.C. men / and lay without
temple bar. And ye earl of Northumberlond / the lord Egremond and the lord
Clifford with.xv.C. men / and lodged without the town. And the Mayre yt time
Geffray Boloyne / kept great watch with ye comyns of ye cite / and rode
about the cite by Holborne and Fleet street with.v. M. men well arrayed and
armed for to keep ye peace. And the.xiiij. day of February the earl of Warwyk
came to London from Calays well beseen and worshypfully with. vj.C. men in reed
Iackettes broddred with a ragged staff behind and before / and was lodged at
the gray freres. And ye.xvij. day of March ye king and the queen came to
London. And there was a co^corde and a peace made among these lords / and they
were set in peace. And on our ladies day in March in the year of our lord.
M.cccc.lviij. the king and the queen and all these lords went on processyon at
Paul's in London / and anon after the king and the lords departed. And i^
this year was a great fraye in Fleet street between men of court and men of
the same street. In which fraye the queen's attorney was slain.

How the kings household made a fraye against the earl of Warwyk / and of the
journey at Bloreheth.
ALso this same year as the earl of Warwyck was at counseyle at Westmynster /
all the kings household meyny gadred them together for to have slain the earl
/ but by the help of god and his friends he recovered his barge / and escaped
their evil enterprise / how well the cokes came rennynge out with spyttes and
pestels against him. And the same day he rode toward Warwyk / and soon after
he gate him a co^myssyon and went over see to Calays. Soon after this the
earl of Salysbury coming to London was encou^tred at Blor^heth with the lord
Awdley and much other people ord^y ned for to destroy him. But he hauyn^
knowledge yt he should be met with (...) was accompanied with his two sons sir
Thomas and sir John Neuyll / and a great (...) ship of good men. And so they
fought to gyder / where ye earl of Salysbury wa^ the field / and the lord
Awdley was (...) and many gentylmen of Chessh(...) (...) and much people
hu^te. And ye earls two sons were hurt / and going homeward afterward they
were taken and had to Ch(...) by the queen's meyny. After (...) Pius was pope /
and was chosen this year M.cccc. and.lviij. and he was called before Eneas an
eloquent man and a poet (...) reate. He was ambassador of the empe rours
before time. And he wrote in ye (...) seyle of Basyle a noble treaty for ye
(...) rite of the same. Also he canonysed (...) Katheryne of Senys. This pope
ordey ned great indulgence and pardon to them ye would go and war against the
Turk (...) and wrote an epistle to the great Turk (...)hortynge hy^ to become
christen. And in the end he ordained a passage against the Turk at Ankone to
which much people drew out of all parties of chrystendome / of which people
he sent many home again / because they suffysed not. And anon after he dyed
at the said place of Ankone the year of our lord. M.cccc.lxiiij. the.xiiij.
day of August.

How Andrewe Trollop and the sow^youres of Calays forsook the duke of York and
their master the earl of war wyk in the west country.
THe duke of York / ye earls of warwyk and of Salysbury saw ye governance of
ye realm stood most by the queen and her counsel / and how ye great princes
of ye land were not called to counsel but set aparte / and not only so /
but it was said through the realm that those said lords should be destroyed
utterly / as it openly was showed at Bloreheth by them that would have slain
ye earl of Salysbury. Than they for salvation of their lives / and also for ye
common well of the realm thought to remedy these things assembled them togider
with much people and took a field in ye west country / to which the earl of
Warwyk came fro Calays with many of ye old sowdyours / as Andrewe Trollop and
other / in whose wisdom as for ye war he much trusted. And wha^ they were
thus assembled and made their field / the king sent out his co^myssyons and
preuy seals unto all ye lords of his realm / to come and wait on him in
their most best defensable array. And so every man came in such wise yt the
king was stronger and had more people than ye duke of york and ye earls of
warwyk and of Salysbury. For it is here to be noted that every lord in
England durst not disobey ye queen / for she ruled peasybly all yt was done
about ye king / which was a good and a well disposed man. And tha^ when ye
king was comen to the place where as they were / the duke of york and his
felaw ship made their field in ye stro^gest wise and purposed verily to have
byde^ and fought but in ye night Andrewe Trollop and all ye old sowdyours of
Calays with a great felawshyp suddenly departed out of ye dukes host / and went
straight to ye kings feld / where they were ioyously received for they knew
ye intent of ye other lords and also ye manner of their field. And than ye duke
of york with the other lords seeing them deceived / took a counsel shortly in
the same night / and departed from ye field leuynge behind them the most
party of their people to keep ye field till on the morrow. Than the duke of
York with his second sone departed through wales toward Irlonde / leuynge his
eldest sone yt earl of March with the earls of warwik and of Salysbury / which
rode together with three or four persons straight in to Deuenshyre / and there by
help and aid of one Denham a squire gate for the^ a ship which cost.xj.
score nobles / and with the same ship sailed from thens i^ to Garnesey / and
there refresshed them / and fro thens sailed to Calais / where they were
received in to ye castle by yt posterne or they of ye town wist of it. And
the duke of York took shyppynge in Wales and sailed over in to Irlonde / where
he was well received.

How ye earls of March / Warwyk / and Salysbury entered in to Calays / and how
the earl of warwyk went in to Irlonde.
THan king Henry being with his host in ye field not knowing of this sodeyn
departing / on the morrow found none in ye field of ye said lords / sent out
in all ye haste men for to follow and pursue after to take them / but they met
not with them as god would. And than the king went to Ludlowe / and despoyled
the castle and the town / and sent the duchess of york and her children to
ye duchess of Bokyngham her sister / where as she was kept long time after.
And forth with the king ordained the duke of Somerset to be capytayn of Calays.
And these other lords so departed as before is said were proclaimed rebels
and great traitors. Than ye duke of Somerset took to him all ye sowdyours yt
departed from ye field and made him ready in all the haste to go to Calays and
take possessyon of his office And when he came there he found ye earl of
warwik therein as capitayn / and ye earls of March and of Salysbury also / and
than he londed by Scales and went to Guynes and there he was received. And it
fortuned that some of tho ships that came over with hy^ came in to Calays
haven by their free will / for ye shypmen ought more favor to ye earl of
warwik than to the duke of Somerset / in which ships were taken diverse men /
as Ienyn Finkhyl / John fellow / Kaylles and Purser which were byheded soon
after in Calays. And after this came men daily over the sea to these lords to
Calays / and began to wexe stronger and stronger / and they borrowed much good
of the staple. And on yt other side ye duke of Somerset being in Guynes gate
people to him / which came out and scarmysshed with them of Calays / and they of
Calays with them which endured many days. During this scarmysshynge much
people came over daily unto these lords. Than on a time by ye advise and
counseyle of ye lords of Calays sent over master Denham with a great
felawshyp to Sandwyche which took the town / and therein ye lord Ryuers and
ye lord Scales his sone / and took many ships in the haven / and brought them
all to Calays / with which ships many maryners of their free will came to
Calays to serve the earl of Warwyk. And after this the earl of warwyk by ye
advise of the lords took al his ships and ma^ned them well and sailed
himself in to Irlonde for to speak with the duke of York and to take his advise
how they should enter in to England. And when he had been there and done his
crandes / he returned again toward Calays / and brought with him his mother ye
countess of Salisbury. And coming in ye west country upon the sea the duke of
Excestre admyral of england being in ye grace of dieu acco^panyed with many
ships of war met with the earl of warwyk and his flete / but they fought
not / for ye substance of ye people being with the duke of Excestre ought
better will and favor to ye earl of warwik than to him and they departed and
came safe to Calays. Than ye ky^ges counsel seeing yt these lords had gote^
those ships fro Sand wyche and taken ye lord Ryuers and his sone ordained a
garnyson at Sandwyche to keep ye town / and made one Mou^ford cap^ tayn of ye
town / and yt no man ne v(...) merchant yt should go to Flau^dres (...) go to
Calais. Tha^ they of Calais (...) this / made out master Denham and many other
to go to Sandwyche and so the^ did / and assailed the town by water and by
land / and gate it / and brought the capytayn over see and smote of his heed /
and yet daily men came over to them fro all parties.

How ye earls of March of warwyk and of Salisbury entered in to England And of
the field of Northamton / where diverse lords were slain.
ANd after this ye foresaid earls of March / warwyk and Salisbury came over to
Dover with much people and there lo^ded / to whom al ye country drew and came
to London all armed and for to let ye lords of ye ky^ges counsel know their
treuth and also their intent assembled the^ and told them yt they ente^ded no
harm ^o the kings person save yt they would put from him such persons as
were about him. And so departed from London with a great puyssau^ce toward
Northamton where the king was acco^panyed with many lords / and had made a
strong field without ye town. And there both parties me^ and was fought a
great battle. In which battle were slain ye duke of Bokyngham / y^ earl of
Shrewesbury the vycou^t Beamond / y^ lord Egremond and many knights and
squyers and other also and the king himself was taken in the field / and
afterward brought to London. And anon after was a parlyament at Westmynster /
during which parlyament the duke of York came out of Irlonde with the earl
of Rutlonde / rydyng with a great felawshyp in to the palace at westmynster and
took y^ kings palace And came in to y^ parlyame^t chamber and there took y^
kings place / and claimed the crown as his propre enherytau^ce and right and
cast forth in writing his tytell / and also how he was ryghtfull heir /
wherefore was much to do / but in conclusion it was appointed and concluded
that king Henry should regne and be king during his natural life / for as
much as he had be^ king so long and was possessed / and after his death the
duke of York should be king / and his heirs kings after him / and forth
with should be proclaimed heir apparau^t / and should also be protector and
regent of England during the kings life / with many other things ordained in
y^ same parlyament / and if king Henry during his life went from his
appointment or any article concluded in y^ said parliament / he should be
deposed / and the duke should take y^ crown and be king. All which things
were enacted by y^ auctorite of the same / at which parlyament y^ common house
comonyuge and treatyng upon y^ tytel of y^ said duke of York / suddenly fell
down the crown which henge than in y^ myd des of y^ said house / which is y^
frayter of the abbaye of Westmynster / which was taken for a prodyge or token
that y^ regne of king Henry was ended. And also y^ crown which stood on y^
highest toure of the steple in the castle of Dover fell down this same year.

Now y^ duke of York was slain / and of y^ field of Wakefelde / and of y^
second journey at saint Albons by y^ queen and the prince.
THan for as much as y^ queen with y^ prince her sone was in y^ north and absent
her fro y^ king / and obeyed not such things as were concluded in y^
parlyament / it was ordained y^ the duke of York as protectout should go
northward to bring in y^ queen / and subdue such as would not obey / with whom
went y^ earl of Salysbury / sir Thomas Neuyl his sone / with much people. And at
wakefeld in Chrystmasse weke they were all overthrown and slain by lords of
the queen's party / yt is to wit / y^ duke of York was slain / the earl of
Rutlond / sir Thomas Neuyll and many moo / and y^ earl of Salisbury was taken
and other / as John Harowe of London capitayn and ruler of y^ fotemen and
Hanson of Hull / Which were brought to Pou^fret / and there after biheded and
their hedes sent to York and set upon the gates And thus was y^ noble prince
y^ duke of York slain / on whose soul god have mercy. And this time y^ earl
of March being in shrowesbury heryng of y^ death of his fader / desired aid
of the town to aue^ge his faders death / and fro thens went to wales / and at
Ca^delmas after he had a battle at Mortymers cross against y^ earl of
Penbroke and of wylshyre / where y^ earl of March had y^ victory. Than the
queen with those lords of the north after yt they had dystressed and slain the
duke of York and his felawshyp came southward with a great multitude of people
for to come to y^ king and undo such conclusyons as had been taken before by
y^ parliament. Against whose coming y^ duke of Nor folk / the earl of warwyk
with much people and ordinance went to saint Albons / and lad king Henry with
them / and there encou^tred togider in such wise and fought / so y^ the duke
of Norfolk and y^ earl of warwik with many other of their party ^ledde and
lost y^ journey / where y^ king Henry was taken by y^ queen and prince Edward
his sone / which two had gotten that field. Than y^ queen and her party being
at her above sent anon to London / which was on asshewednesdaye y^ first day
of lent for vytayle / for which y^ Mayre ordained by y^ advise of y^ aldermen
y^ certain carts laden with vytayle should be sent to saint Albons to them. And
when y^ carts came to crepylgate / the comyns of y^ cite y^ kept the gate
took y^ bytayle fro y^ carts and would not suffer it to pass. Tha^ were there
certain aldermen and comyns appointed to go to Bernet to speak with the queen's
counsel / for to entreat y^ the northeren men should be sent home in to
their country again / for y^ cite of London drad fore to be despoyled if they
had comen. And during this treaty tidings came that the earl of Warwyk had
met with y^ earl of March on Cotteswolde coming out of Wales with a great
meyny of walsshmen / and that they both were coming to London ware. Anon as
these tidings were known y^ treaty was broke / tor y^ king / queen / prince
and all y^ other lords y^ were with them departed fro saint Albons no^thwarde with
all their people / yet or they departed thens they dyheded y^ lord Bo^^yle and
sir Thomas (...) which (...) take in y^ journey done on (...). Than y^
duch(...) of York being at London deryng of y^ loss of y^ field of saint
Albons ^ (...) which went to (...)ght. And philip malpas (...)che merchant of
London / Thomas Vaghan squire / (...) many other (...) of y^ coming of y^
queen to London / took a ship of Andwerpe to have gone in to ^^land / (...)
on y^ other co^st were taken of one Colompne a Frenssheman a ship of war /
and he took them prisoners / and brought them in to France / where they paid
great good for their raunsom / and there was much good and richesse in that
ship.

Of the deposynge of king Henry the syxth / and how king Edward the fourth
took possessyon / and of y^ battle on Palm sunday / and how he was crowned.
THan when y^ earl of March and y^ earl of warwyk had met together on
Cotteswolde / inco^tynent they concluded to go to London / and sent word anon
to y^ Mayre and to the cite that they would come. And anon y^ cite was glad of
their coming / hopyng to be releued by them / and so they came to London. And
when they were comen and had spoken with the lords and estates being there /
concluded for as much as king Henry was gone with them northwarde / y^ he had
forfeyted his crown and ought to be deposed according unto the acts made and
passed in the last parlyament. And so by the advise of the lords spirytuall
and temporal than being at London / the earl of March Edward by y^ grace of
god eldest sone of Richard duke of York / as ryghtfull heir and next
enherytour to his fader the fourth day of March / the year of out lord god.
M.CCCC.lix. took possessyon of the realm at Westmerlonde in y^ great hall /
and after in y^ church of y^ abbey and offered as king with the c^ptre royal. To
whom all y^ lords spirytuall and te^porall did homage as to their souerayn
lord and king. And forthwith it was proclaimed through y^ cite king Edward the
fourth of y^ name. And anon after y^ king rode in his ryall estate northwarde
with all his lords to subdue his subgectes y^ time being in the north / and for
to avenge his (...) death. And on Palmesondaye after he had a great battle in
y^ north country at a place called Cowton / not far from York / where with
y^ help of god he gate y^ field and had the victory / where were slain of his
adversaries.xxx. M. men and moo / as it was said by them that were there. In
the which battle were slain y^ earl of Northumberlonde the lord Clifford /
sir John Neuyll the earl of Westmerlondes brother / Andrewe Trollop / and many
knights and squyers Than king Henry that had be^ king being with y^ queen and
the prince at York heryng the loss of that field / and so much people slain
and overthrown / anon forth with departed all three with the duke of Somerset
/ the lord Roos and other toward Scotlo^de. And the next day after king
Edward with all his army entered in to York / and was there proclaimed king and
obeyed as he ought to be. And y^ Mayre / aldermen and comyns swore to be his
iyege men. And wha^ he had tarried a while in the north / and that all y^
northcou^tree had turned to him he returned southwarde / leuynge behind him
the earl of Warwyk in those parties to govern and rule that country. And
about mydsomer after the year of our lord. M.cccc.lx. and the first year of
his regne he was crowned at Westmynster / and anointed king of England having
possessyon of all the realm.

CAixtus the third was pope after Nycolas three year and.v. months. This
Calixte was an old man when he was chosen pope / and was co^tynually seek / ne
he might not fulfill his desire which he ente^ded to do against the Turks /
for death came upon him. He was chosen pope in y^ year of our lord (...).
(...).lv. And he dyed the syxth day af (...) he had i^stytued the
tra^sfiguracyon of our lord god. He also c^nonysed saint Vincent a friar
precher. And there was a great reformacyon of many monasteryes in diverse
parties of the world / and these reformacions were made many ty mes / but
almoost none abode / but they returned again as they were before by succession
of time after y^ death of y^ worshypfull faders. The feast of the
Transfyguracyon was ordained of Calixt for the gift of grace of y^ meruaylous
victory done against the Turk in Hungary on saint Sixtus day. M.cccc. l^ij.
For there was a meruaylous victo(...) given to christen men in Hungary against
the great Turk / and there he lost many a man and fled shamefully for dread
of his enemies / and no man followed by / but alone y^ hand of god fered the
Turk and his host on saint Calixtes day. Saint John de Capistrano was there
seen present / and he provoked the people that were aferde to follow the
myshyleuynge Turks / and there fell a great (...) on them / for the Turks
said y^ there was so great a nombre of knights that followed them that (...)th
they durst look backwarde and therefore they fled and lest all their tresour
behind them / and they were holy aungelles that caused them to flee.

Nota. Prynters of books were this time myghtely multiplied in Ma g^^cie and
through out y^ world / and there began first, and held their (...) / and this
time many m^n began to be more subtle incraftes and (...)er the ever they were
before.

(...) y^ second was pope after* (...) lixt.vi. year. This (...)us was chosen
in the year of our lord* (...).cccc. (...)* and he was called E^^ as an (...)*
and a great orator / a laurente port and before he was y^ emperors
ambassador / and in y^ co^cyle of Basyle he wrote a noble treatise for y^
auctorite of y^ same. This man desired to have a passage to the Turk And much
people of diverse countrees came to Rome / and he gave them his blessing and
sent them home again / for they were not sufficyent for y^ Turks host / and
(...) after he decessed.

PAulus a venicyan was pope after Pius.vij. year This Paulus was chosen in the
year of our lord Jesus Christ. M.cccc. and.lxiiij. And anon he allowed the feast
of the Presentacyon of our lady as Pius did. This man was a taught man in right
wysnes / and he said it was better to make few things and keep them
steadfastly / than for to make many and soon revoke them. And he made a great
palace at saint Marks / and he decessed or that he had ended it in the year of
our lord Jesus Christ. M.cccc. and.lxxi. Leodin^. the land of Luke was
oppressed with many tribulacyo^s and after in the year of our lord Jesus
Christ. M.cccc. and.lxviij. utterly it was destroyed by Charles the duke of
Burgoyne / the which wedded dame Margarete sister to king Edward y^ fourth of
England. Also the same duke Charles entered in to the land of Geldre / and con
quered it all. The year of grace was also changed by pope Paul for favor of
man's soul from.xxv. year unto.xxv. year. And because y^ cursednes habounded
so sore / grace habounded as sore.

SIxtus the fourth a Geneuoys and a ^rere mynour was pope after Paul. This man
was general in the order of y^ fre^e mynours or he was cardynall. And he was
chosen in the year of our lord god. M.cccc.lxxj. and was called Fra^ciscus de
Sanona / of good fame and virtuous. He was chosen cardynall without his
knowledge till he was made. And the same year that he was chosen pope / the
Turk had taken from christen men two empyres and.iiij. kingdoms.xx. prouynces
/ and two hundred (...)tees / and had destroyed men and women without nombre.
And that meued the pope that he should dyspose him to go to withstand him. And
for an army to be made against the Turk / the pope gave great indulgences of
pardon of the treasour of the church unto all christen realms / that he might
ordeyn some trea sour to withstand that mysbyleuynge Turk. And in the realm
of England John abbot of Abyngdon was the popes legate to dispose this godly
treasour of the church unto every faithful man that was disposed / and that
would ab^^ themself to receive it.

Thus ends the Chronicles of England with the fruit of times / compyled in a
book. And was first imprynted by one sometime scole master of saint Albons / on
whose soul god have mercy Amen. And now lately imprynted at London / and
dilygently amended in diverse places where as any fault was / in Fleet street /
at the sign of the Son / by me Wynkyn de Word / in the year of our lord
god. M.CCCCC.xxviij. the ix. day of Apryll.

The names of this ylonde. Caplo.j.
First (as Galfridus says) this lord was called Albion after y^ name of
Albyne y^ elpest daughter of Dio clesyan / and had.xxxij. systers / and they
were the first that enhabyted this land / and because she was the eldest
sister / she named this land Albion after her own name as the chronicles
reherseth. Other say that this land was named Albion as it were y^ white
lord of white rocks about the clyues of y^ see y^ were seen fro far.
Afterward Brute conquered this land and called it Brytayn after his own name.
And tha^ saxons or Englysshmen conquered this land and called it Anglia y^ is
England. Or it is called Anglia of a queen y^ owed this lo^d y^ was named
Angela / and was a noble dukes daughter of the Saxons. Or as ysid says
Ethi.xv. Anglia has y^ name as it were an angle and a corner of the world. Or
else as Beda says li.j. Saint Gregory saw englisshe children to sell at Rome /
and he accorded to the name of the land and said / they ben sothly angels /
for their faces shine as angels / for the noblete of y^ land shone in the
childrens faces. Alfre. The Britysshe Anglia is called the other world and for
great plente of all good the great Charles called it his own chamber. Solinus.
The edge of y^ frensshe clyf should be the end of the world / if the ylonde
of Brytayn ne were not / which is worthy to have the name of an other world.
Alfre. This ylonde is called insula for it is in salo / that is the sea / and
is beten of with diverse course of waters with stremes and with wawes of the sea.

Of the setting / boundynge / length and bread of England. Ca.ij.
THis Britayn is acounted a noble land both in our stories and also in the
stories of Greeks / and is set against Germania / Gallia / France / and spain
by twene y^ north and y^ west and y^ see between. This land is fyfty mile from
the clyf of the men that be called morini gessorico. Beda li.j. And for this
ylonde lies under the north heed of y^ world / and it has light and bright
nyghtes in y^ somer time so y^ oftentimes at mydnyght men have questyons and
doubt whether it be euentyde or dawning / y^ is for y^ time of the year y^
the son goth not far under the earth by night but passes by y^ north side
and comes soon in to y^ eest again. And therefore in y^ somer ben their days
full long of.xviij. hours / and y^ nyghtes of.vj. hours. And after in y^
winter ben long nyghtes of.xviij. hours and short days of.vj. hours. Also
in Armenia / Macedo nia / Italia and in other lo^des of y^ same line the
longest day and lo^gest night also is of xv. hours / and the shortest day or
night is of.ix. hours. Plimus in meroe. That ylonde is chief of black men /
there is y^ lo^gest day.xij. hours. In Alexandry in Egypt of.xiij. hours /
in Ytalye of.xv. hours / in Brytayn of.xviij. hours / in the ylonde named
Tyle all the.vj. somer months is day / and all the.vj. winter months is
night. Isid.li.xiij. Brytayn is set wtin Occean as it were without the world /
and is set against France and Spain. Giraldus. Brytayn is endlo^ge and larger
in y^ myddle tha^ in y^ ends Orostus. Brytayn stretches in length out of y^
south i^ to y^ north / and in y^ southest it has France / in y^ south Spain
in y^ north Norway / and in y^ west H^bern^a y^ is Irlonde / when shypmen pass
the next clyf of y^ lord they se a cite y^ hight (...) mouth. Beda li.j. y^
cite is now called of Englysshmen Reptacestre. Solinus. Brytayne is. viij.C.
mile of length and it be met from y^ clyf of Tornes to y^ angle of Calidon.
Alfre. That is from Penwithstrete.xv. mile beyond Myghels stowe in Cornewayle
unto Carnes y^ is beyond Scotlonde / and Brytayn is more than. ij.C. mile
broad from Meneuia y^ is the vttermest place in Wales unto Ya^mouth i^
northfolke. Beda. Only out take y^ longest out shotyng of diverse fore lands
with the which Brytayn is all about.xlviij. sithe.lxx. thousand pace.

Of the worthynes and preroga cyons. Caplo.iij.
AS France passes Brytayne / so Brytayn passes Irlonde in fair weder and
noble^e / but not in health. Beda lib.i. For this ylonde is best to bry^ge
forth trees and fruytes / Rutherne and beestes / and wine grows therein in
some places. The land has plente of fowls and of beestes of diverse manner of
kind The land is plenteous and the sea also. The land is noble / copyous /
and rich of noble wells and ryuers / with plente of fysshe. There is great
plente of small fysshe of samon and of eles. Wilhel. de pon.li.iij. So y^ the
people in some place feed their s^yne with fysshe. Beda li.j. There ben
oftentimes taken dolphyns see calves and baleyne great fysshes as whales kind
/ and diverse manner shelfysshe / among y^ which shelfysshe ben muscles that
wtin them have Margery perles of al manner of color and hew of rody and reed
purpure and of blewe / and specially and most of white. There is also plente
of shelfysshe y^ men dye therewith fine reed / y^ reednes thereof is wonders
fair and stable / and stayneth never with cold ne with hete / with wete ne
with dry / but ever the older y^ color is the fayrer. There be^ also salt
wells and hot wells thereof rennynge stremes of hot bathes departs in to
diverse places according for man and woman of all manner age old or young.
Basilius says. That y^ water that tenneth and passes by veins of certain
metal takes i^ his course great hete. This ylonde is plenteous of veins of
metalles / of bras / of yren / of leed / of tynne / and of silver also. Plimus
li.vj. ca.vj. In this ylonde under the turfe of the lord is found good merle
/ the thryfty of the farnes dries hy^self therein. So y^ ever the thycker y^
field is merled y^ better corn it will bear. There is also an other manner
white merle y^ the land is the better.lxxx. year y^ therewith is merled.
Solinus. In this ylonde grows a stone that is called gagates / if ye will
know his fayrnes / it is black as gemmes ben / if ye will know his kind /
it brenneth in water / and quenches in oil / and as to his might / if the
stone be froted and chafed it holds what hy^ nigheth as Succuns a stone that
is so named. Ynd. li.xv. There ben sheep that bear good woll. There ben many
hearts and wild beestes and few wolves / therefore sheep ben the surer without
keeping left in the field. (...). In this ylonde also ben many citees and
towns fair and noble and rich / many great ryuers and stremes with great
ple^te of fysshe / many fair wodes and great / with right many beestes came
and wild. The earth of that land is copyous of metal oor / and of salt
wells / of quarreys of marble of diverse manner stones / of reed / of white / of
soft and of hard of chalk and of white lyme. There is also white claye and
reed for to make pottes / crockes / stenes and other vessel / and brent tyle
to cover the houses and chirches / as it were in the other samia / that is
named samos also. Flau^dres loves well y^ woll of this land / and Hollonde
the skylles and felles of al manner beestes. Guyen y^ yren and the leed. Irlonde
the oor and the salt. All Europa loves and desires y^ white metal of this
land. Alfre. Britayn has enough of al matter y^ there needs to bie and sell /
or is needful to man's use / there lacks neither salt nor yren. Therefore a
versefyour in his meter prayseth this land in this manner. England is a good
land fruytful of woll / but it is a corner. England is full of play / free
men well worthy to play / free men / free tongues free hertes / and free ben
all their things / their hands is more free and better than their tongue.
Also England is beauteous of land / flower of lands all about / that lord
is full paid with fruit and good of his own / that land releueth strange men
that has need thereto. And wha^ hunger greueth other lands / that land fedeth
them. That land bears fruit and corn great plente enough. That land is
well at ease as long as men live in peace / eest and west in each land ben well
known the havens of England. Their ships fou^des and often helps many
lands. Their meet and money men have there more common always. And for to learn
men gladly give gifts. In land and stronde / wide speaks men of England.
Land honey milk chese this ylonde thereof shall bear the price. This ylonde
has no need of other lands / al lo^des must seek help at this alone. Of the
lyking of their woun might wonder king Solomon. The riches y^ there is an /
would desire Octauia^.

Of the meruayles and wonders. ca.iiij.
IN Brytayn ben hot wells well arrayed and adressed to y^ use of manhood /
maystresse of those wells is the great spirit Minerua. In her house the fire
endures always that never changes in to ashes / but there y^ fire slaketh it
chau^geth in to stone clottes. Alfre. In Brytayn ben many wonders / never
theles four ben most wonderful / the first is at Pecton / there blows so
strong wind out of the chynes of the earth that it casts up again clothes
y^ men cast in. The second is at Stonehenge beside Salysbury / there ben great
stones and wonders huge / and be^ rered on high as it were gates set upon other
gates. Nevertheless it is not known clearly ne apperceyued how and wherefore
they ben so arered and so wonderfully hanged. The third is at Cherdhoke /
there is a great holownes under y^ earth / often many men have walked therein /
and have seen ryuers and stremes / but no where can they find none end. The
fourth is / that rain is seen raised upon hills / and none spronge about in
the feldes. Also there is a great ponde that conteyneth.lx. ylondes couenable
for men to dwell in / that ponde is becleped about with six score roches / and
upon every roche an egles nest / and three score ryuers run in to y^ ponde /
and none of them all ren in to y^ see but one. There is a ponde closed about
with wall of tyle and of stone. In that ponde men wasshe and bathe right sore /
and every man feleth the water hot or cold right as he will hy^ self. There
ben salt wells far from the sea / and ben salt all y^ weke long unto
saterdaye at none / and fresshe fro saturday at none unto mondaye. The water of
these wells when it is soden turns in to small salt fair and white. Also
there is a ponde / the water thereof has wonders werkynge / for though all an
host stood by the ponde and turned their faces thyderwarde / the water would
draw them violently toward y^ ponde and wete all their clothes / and so
should a horse be drawn in the same wise. And yt y^ face be turned away fro
the water / the water noyeth not. There is a well that no streme renneth fro
neither thereto / and yet four manner of fysshe ben taken therein / that well is
but.xx. foot long (...). (...). foot broad / and not deep but to the knee /
and closed with hye banks on every side. In the country about Wynchestre is a
den or a cave / out of that cave blows always a strong wind / so that no
man may endure to stand to fore y^ den or cane. There is also a ponde y^
turns tree in to yren if it be therein a year / and so trees ben shapen in to
whetstones. Also there is in the top of an hill buryels / every man that
comes and meteth that buryell he shall find it even of his own length and
mesure. And if a pilgrim knele thereto / anon he shall be all fresshe and feel
no grefe of werynes. Gir. in top. Fast by the mynstre of wymburney (that is not
far fro Bathe) is a wode that bears much fruit / if the trees of that wode
fall in to water or ground that is nygh and lie there all a year / the trees
turn in to stones. Gir. in itinere. Under y^ cite of Chestre renneth the river
Dee / that now departs England and wales. That river chau^geth eueri month
his sordes as men of that country tell / and leueth often the chanel / but
whether y^ water draw more toward England or toward Wales / to what side y^
it be / that year men of that side have y^ worst end and be over set. And men
of that other side shall have better end and ben at their above. When the water
so changes his course it bo death such happes. This river Dee ren neth and
comes out of a lake that hight Pymblemere. In this river is great plente of
samon / nevertheless in the lake is never samon found. Wilhel. dear. le.ij.
Take heed how great light and bryghtnes has been showed upon Englysshmen sith
they first turned to right believe. So y^ of no men in any prouynce ben fou^den
so many hole bodies of men after their death / in lykenes of euerlastynges that
shall be after the day of dome / as it well seems in these holy saints
Etheldrede / Edmond the king / Elphege / Edgar / Cuthberte / and saint Edward /
and many other / I trow that it be done by a special grace of almighty god /
for the nation that is set as it were without the world should take heed to
buryenge of bodies without corrupcyon and rottynge / and ben the more bold and
steadfast for to trust upon the fynall arysyng of deed bodies for to last
evermore after the day of dome.

Of the chief parties of the same land. Ca.v.
AFter the first Brutes time the ylonde of Brytayne began for to have the
pryncypall parties / that been Loegria / Cambria that is Wales / and Albania
that is now Scotlonde. Loegria has that name of Locrinus that was (...)es
eldest sone / and hight Loegria as it were Locrinus land. But now Loegria is
called England. The bounds and marks were thereof sometime y^ frensshe see
both by cest and by south. Beda li.j. ca.ij. And by north two arms of the sea
that breketh far in to the land either against other / but they reche not
together. The eest arm of those twain beginning about a two little mile fro
y^ mynstre of Ebburcurynge. In the west side of Penulton in y^ arm is a town
y^ is called Guydy / the west arm of these twain has in the right side a
strong cite that hight Alcliud / which in their language is called Clyntstone
/ and stands upon a river y^ is called Clynt also. R. Some men would mean
that Loegria ends at Humbre / and stretches no ferther northwarde. The
second party of Brytayn is called Albania y^ is Scotlonde / and has that name
of Albanactus Brutes sone / and stretches fro y^ foresaid two arms of y^ see
northward unto y^ see of Norway. Nevertheless the south parties of Albania where
as Pictes dwelled sometime / that lies from y^ water of Twede unto the
scottysshe see. All y^ longed sometime to y^ kingdom of Northumberlonde
Brenycorne the north side of Northumberlonde fro the first time of English
kings to y^ time wha^ Kyna dius king of Scotlond y^ was Alpinus sone did away
y^ Pictes / and so joined that country to y^ kingdom of Scotlonde. The third
party of Britayn is Wales Wallia that hight Cambria also / and has y^ name
Cambria of Cambre Brutes sone for he was pry^ce of wales. In y^ eest side
Seuarne sometime departed between England and Wales. But in y^ north side the
river of Dee at Chestre / and in the south the river y^ is named Vaga at the
castle of Strygelyn departs England and wales. Also king Offa for to have
a dystynccyon for evermore between the kings of England and of wales / made a
long dyche y^ stretches forth out of the south side by Bristowe under the
hills of wales Seuarne and Dee almoost to the hedes and unto y^ mouth of y^
river of Dee beyond Chestre fast by the castle it renneth between Colehyll
and the mynstre of Basyngwerke in to y^ see. This dyche is yet in many places
seen. In saint Edwardes time walshmen should not pass that dyche with wepen upon
a great pain And that was at y^ earl Haroldes procuring / as it shall be said
here after. But now in either sides both of that half and of this half y^
dyche / and specially in the shyres of Chestre / of Shrowesbury and of Herford
in many places ben Englysshmen and walshmen meddled together.

Of the ylondes that been thereto adjacent. Ca.vj.
BRytayne has three ylondes that been nygh and longing thereto al without y^
ylondes Orcades / as it were answering to the three chief parties of Brytayn.
For the isle of wight lo^geth and lies to Loegria that is England. The ylonde
Mon that is called Angleseia also longs to Wales. And y^ ylonde Eubonia that
has two other names / and is called Meneuia and Man also / which longs to
Scotlo^de. And all these three ylondes / Wight / Mon / and Man ben almoost alyke
much and of quantite / of the which three alarowe follows our speech. Be da
li.j. ca.iij. Claudius sent Vaspasianus and Vaspasianus wanne Wight / and Wight
stretches out of the eest in to y^ west.xxx. mile long / and out of the south
in to the north.xij. mile / and is in y^ eest side.vj. mile fro the south clyf
of Brytayne / and three mile in y^ west side. Beda li.iiij. ca.v. The mesure of
this ylond as Englysshmen guess / is a thousand housholdes and two hundred.
Git. in itinere. Mon that is called Angleseia also is departed from northwales
by a short arm of the sea as it were two mile broad. In Mon ben.CCC. towns
and.xliij. and ben accounted for candredes that been two hondredes. The ylond is
as it were xxx. mile long / and.xij. mile broad. Candredus is so much land
as conteyneth an hundred towns / that name Candredus is made out of two
languages / of Brytysshe and of Irysshe. In praysyng of this ylo^de walshmen
were wont to say a proverb and an old same. Mon Man kembry / that is to say
in english / that land is so good / that it seems y^ it would find corn
enough for all y^ men of Wales. Therefore Virgils verses may be according
thereto / as much as gnawes / beestes long Inneth dawes / so much efte
brings cold dew in a night. In that arm of the sea that departs this
land and northwales / is a swalowe that draws ships to it that sayleth by
/ and swaloweth them in right as does Cylla and Caribdis y^ ben two peryllous
places in the sea of myddle earth. Therefore men may not sail by this swalowe
but slyly at a full see. R. Of the meruayles and wonders of the ylonde of Mon
thou shalt find in the chapter of Wales. Gir. in itinere. The third ylonde
y^ is called both Eubonia and Mene^^a that is Man stands in the myddle
between y^ Irysshe vlstere and y^ scottysshe galleway as it were the navel of
the sea. Beda li.ij. ca.ix. This ylonde Man co^reyneth as it were two ylondes.
The first is southward the more country / and the better corn land / and
co^teyneth.ix.C. and.lx. housholdes. The second conteyneth y^ space of.CCC.
and moo as Englysshme^ guess. Giral. in top. Sometime was strife whether this
ylonde Man should long to Britayn or to Irlond / and for as much as venymous
worms that were brought thither lived there / it was judged that the ylonde of
Man should long to Brytayn. R. In that ylonde is sortylege and wytchecraft
used. For women there sell to shypmen wind / as it were closed under three
knottes of threde / so that ye more wind he will have / ye moo knottes he must
undo. There often by day time men of that land se men that been deed tofore
hand byheded or hole / and what death they dyed. Alyens set their feet upon
the feet of men of that land for to se such syghtes as ye men of that land
done. Beda li.ij. Scotts dwelled first in this ylonde. Thanatos that is Tenet
/ and is an ylonde besides Kent / and has that name Thanatos of death of
serpents / for there be none / and the earth thereof sleeth serpe^tes borne in
other lands. There is noble corn land and right fruytfull. It is supposed
that this ylonde was hallowed and blyssed of saint Austyn the first doctor of
Englysshmen / for there he arrived first.

Of the kings hye ways and streets. Ca.vij.
MOliuncius was the.xiij. king of Brytons / and was the first that gave them
law. He ordained that plowmen folowes / gods temples and high ways that
led men to cytees and towns should have y^ fredome of color so that every
man that went to any of them for socour or for trespace yt he had done /
should be safe for pursuit of all his enemies. But afterward for the ways were
vntertayne / and strife was had / therefore Belinus the king that was ye
foresaid Moliuncius sone / for to put away all strife and doubt / made four
high kings ways / preuyleged with ^^^ preuylege and fredom. And the ways
(...) through the ylonde. The first and gretest of the four ways is called
Fosse / and stretches out of the south in to the north / and begins from ye
corner of Cornewayle and passes forth by Deuenshyre by Somerset / and forth
besides Tetbury upon Cotteswold beside Couentre unto Leycestre / and so forth
by wild playnes toward Newarke / and ends at Lyncolne. The second chief
kings hye way is named watlyngstrete / and stretches thwarte over Fosse /
out of the southeest in to the north west / and begins at Dover / and
passes by the myddle of Kent over Temse beside London by Westmynster / and so
forth by saint Albons in the west side by Donstable by S^ratford by Towcetre /
by Wedom / by south Lylleborne / by Atheryston unto Gylbertes hill / yt now is
called wrekene / and forth by Seuarne / and passes besides Wrokcestre / and
than forth to Stratton / and so forth by the myddle of Wales unto Cardykan /
and ends at the Irysshe see. The third way is called Erynnugestrete / and
stretches out of the westnorth west in to the eestsoutheest / and begins in
Meneuia that is saint David's land in west Wales / and stretches forth unto
Southamton. The fourth is called Rikenyldstrete and stretches forth by
Worcestre / by Wycombe / and by Birmyngeham by Lechfelde / by Derby / by
Chestrefelde / by York / and forth unto Tynmouth.

Of the famous ryuers and stremes. Ca.viij.
THere be^ three famous ryuers renny^ge through Britayn / by ye which three
ryuers merchants of beyond the sea comen in ships in to Brytayn well nygh
out of all manner of nacyons and lands. These three ryuers ben Temse / Seuarne /
and Humbre. The sea ebbeth and flows at these three ryuers / and departs the
three provinces of y^ ylonde / as it were the three kingdoms asondre. The three
parties ben Loegria / Cambria / and Northumbria / that is myddle England wales
and Northumberlonde. R. This name Tamyse seems made one name of two names of
two ryuers / that been Tame and yse / for the river of Tame renneth besides
Dorchestre and falls in yse / therefore all y^ river fro y^ first heed unto
the eest see is named Tamyse or Temse. Temse begy^neth beside Tetbury / that
is.iij. mile by north Malmesbury / there the Temse spryngeth of a well that
renneth eestwarde and passes the Fosse / and departs Glocestre shyre and
wylshyre / and draws with him many other wells and stremes / and wexeth
great at Grecestre / and passes forth than toward Hampton / and so forth by
Oxford / by wallynforde / by Redynge / and by London. Wilhel. de pon. ca.ij. At
the haven of Sandwytche it falls in to the eest see / and holds his
name.xl. mile beyond London / and departs in some place Kent and Essex /
westsex and Mercia / that is as it were a great dele of myddle England R.
Seuarne is a river of Brytayn / and is called Haberne in brytysshe / and has
that name Haberne of Haberne y^ was Estryldes daughter. Guendolon y^ queen
drowned this Haberne therein / therefore the brytons called y^ river Haberne
after y^ woman y^ was drowned therein / but by corrupt latin it is called
Sabrina / Seuarne in english. Seuarne begins in the myddle of Wales / and
passes first toward y^ eest unto Shrowesbury / and than turns southwarde
unto Brygnorth / worcestre and Glocestre / and falls in to the west see
besides Brystowe and departs in some place England and Wales. Wilhel. de
po^.li.iij. Seuarne is swyfte of streme / much fysshe is there in / woodnes of
the swolowynge and of the whyrlynge water casts up and gadre to hepe great
hepes of gravel. Seuarne often aryseth and ouerfloweth the banks. R. Humbre
has that name of Humbre king of Hunes / for he was drowned therein / and
renneth first a croke out of the south side of york / and than it departs
the prouynce of Lyndesey y^ longed sometime to the Merces from the other country
Northumberlonde. Trent and Ous run in to Humbre and make the river full
great. Treuisa. The Merces were men as it were of myddle England / as it shall
be said here after.

Of ancient cytees and towns. ca.ix.
THe kingdom of Brytayne was sometime made fair with.xxviij. noble citees without
right many castelles that were walled with coures / with gates and with bars
strongly builded. A^fre. These were y^ names of the citees. Ca^r lud y^ is
London. Caerbranke y^ is York Caerkent that is Canterbury. Caergoraukon that
is Worcestre. Caerlirion y^ is Leicestre. Caerclon that is Glocestre.
Caercolden that is Colchestre. Carrey that is Chychestre / saxons called it
sometime Cissoncestre. Caercery that is Cir cestre. Caerguent that is
Wynchest^e. Caergrau^te y^ is Cambrydge. Caerleyll that is Lugubalia and
Karlyll. Caerporis that is Porchestre. Caerdrom y^ is Dorchestre. Caerludeoit
that is Lyncolne and Lyndecolin. Caermarthyn that is Merlyns cite. Caersegent
that is Sicestre and is upon Temse not far from Redyng. Leon that is
Caerlegyon also / and hight first legecestre and now is named Chestre.
Caerbathon that is Bache / and hight sometime Athamannus cite. Caerpaladour that
is Septon / y^ now hight Shaftesbury. R. Other citees ben found in cro nycles
for understanding of stories / of whom it shall follow. W(...)hell. de pon.
London is a ryall and a rich cite upon Tamyse / of burgeyses / of riches of
merchants / of chaffre and marchau^dyse. Therefore it is that sometime wha^
derth of vytayles is in all England / comyuly at London it is best chepe /
because of the buyers and sellers y^ ben at London. Gaufre. Brute y^ first king
of Brytons builded and ^dyfyed this (...)te of London y^ first cite / in
remembrance of the cite of Troy that was destroyed / and called it Troy neweth
and Trinouantu^ / yt is new Troy Afterward king Lud called it Caerlud after
his own name / therefore y^ Brytons had indigna^yon as Gyldas tells. Afterward
Englysshmen called y^ cite London / and yet after that Normans called it
Londres / and is named in latin Lo^do^^a. Rudhudibras king Leyles sone was y^
vu^. king of Brytons / he builded Canterbury the chief cite of Kent / and
called it Caerkent. Afterward Englysshmen called it Doro^ernia / but yt is not
Dover yt stands upon y^ clif of y^ frensshe see / and is from this Dover.xii.
english mile. Afterward this Dorober^^a was and is called Canterbury. The
same king Rudhudibras builded Wynchestre / and called it Caerguent / and after
Englysshmen called it went / and wynchestre after the name of one Wine an
Englysshman yt was bishop there. All westsaxon was subject to hy^ / the same
king builded Paladour that is Septon yt now is called Shaftesbury. Britons
tellen yt an egle pro^he^yed there sometime. Bladud Leyles sone a ^ygromancer
was the.ix. king of Brytons / he builded Bathe / and called it Caerbathon.
Englisshme^ called it after Athamannus cite. But at y^ last men called it
Bathonia y^ is Bathe. Wilhel. de po^. (...).ij. In this cite welleth up and
springs (...) bath^s / and men wene y^ Julius Cezar made there such bathes.
R. But Gaufre. monemutensis in his brytysshe book says yt Bladud made those
bathes because William has not seen that brytysshe book wrote so by telling
of other men / or by his own gessyng as he wrote other things not best
auysedly. Therefore it seems more sothly that Bladud made not y^ hot bathes /
ne Julius Cezardyd such a deed / though Bladud builded and made the cite / but
it accords better to kyndly reason yt the water renneth in the earth by veins
of brymstone and sulphur / and so it is kyndly made hot in that course and
spryngeth up in diverse places of y^ cite. And so there ben hot bathes yt
wasshen of teters / sores and scabbes Treuisa. Though me^ might by craft make
hot bathes for to endure long enough this accords well to reason and to
philosophy y^ treats of hot wells and bathes that been in diverse lands /
though y^ water of this bath be more troubly and sourer of savor and of smell
than other hot bathes ben that I have seen at Acon in Almayn. And eyges in
Sauoye which ben fair and clear as any well streme / I have been bathed therein
and assayed them. R. Claudius Cezar married his daughter to Aruiragus king of
Brito^s. This Claudius Cezar builded Glocestre in y^ wedding of his daughter.
Brito^s called this cite first after Claudius name / but afterward it was
called Glocestre after one Gloria which was duke of y^ country and stands
upon Seuarne in y^ march of England and wales. Shrowesbury is a cite upon
Seuerne in y^ march of england and wales / and is set upon y^ top of an
hill and it is called Shrowesbury of shrobbes and fruit yt grew there sometime
o^ yt hill. Brytons called it sometime Pengwerne that is y^ heed of a fair
tree. Shrowesbury was sometime y^ heed of Powesye that stretches forth toward
over y^ myddell of wales unto ye Irysshe see. Notyngham stands upon Trent /
and sometime hight Notyngham yt is ye wonnynge of dens / for ye Danes dwelled
there sometime and dygged dens and caves under hard stones and rocks and
dwelled there. R. Lyncolne is chief of ye prouynce of Lyndesey / and was called
sometime Caerludcoit / and afterward Lyndecoln. It is uncertain who builded
first this cite but if it were king Lud: and so it seems by menynge of ye name
/ for caer is britysshe and is to say a cite / and coit is a wode / and so it
seems yt Caerludcoit is to say Luddes wode town. King Leir was Bladuddes
sone and builded Leyce^tre / as it were in ye myddle of England upon ye river
Sos and upon Fosse the kings hye way.

Wilhel. de pon. lib.iij.
York is a great cite in either side of ye water of Ouse that seemed as fair
as Rome unto the time that king Willyam had with brennynge and fire defouled it
and the country about / so that a pilgrim would now weep and he saw it / if
he had known it tofore. Gaufre. Ebrancus the.v. king of Britons builded york
and called it after his own name Caerbranke. He builded also two other citees /
one in Scotlo^de and is called Edinburgh / and an other toward Scotlonde in the
end of England and is called Alcliud. R. Edinburgh is a cite in the land of
Pictes between ye river of Twede and the scottysshe see / and hight sometime ye
castle of Maidens / and was called afterward Edinburgh of Edan king of
Pictes / yt reigned there in Egfridus time king of Northu^berlonde. Alcliud was
sometime a noble cite / and is now well nygh unknown to all Englysshmen. For
under the Brytons and Pictes and Englysshme^ it was a noble cite to ye coming
of the Danes. But afterward about ye year of our lord viij.C.lxx. it was
destroyed when ye danes destroyed the country of Northumberlonde. But in what
place of Britayn that cite Alcliud was builded / auctours tell diversely. Beda
li.j. says that it was builded by west that arm of ye see that departs
between the Britons and the Pictes sometime there Seuerus famous wall ends
westward / and so it seems by him that it is not far from Ca^^le^ll for that
cite is set at the end of the wall. Other writers of stories write that ye
cite of Alcliud is that cite that now is called Aldburgh / yt is to say / an
old town / and stands upon the river Ous not far fro Burghbrigge / that
is.x. mile westward out of york / and it seems that he preueth that by
Gaufride in his book of deeds of Brytons / he writes yt ^^^durus king of
Britons was lodged at the cite of Alcliud because of so^a^e and hunting / and
found his brother Arga^on maskynge in a wode nygh there b^^^^^ that hight
Calatery / but that w^d^ ^^latery which is Calters in (...) recheth almoost to
york / and str^^^^eth toward ye north by Aldburgh (...) by space of.xx. mile
/ ye most (...) of that wode is now thrown down and the (...) tylled. Other
men would suppose yt Alcliud was that cite that now is called Burgham in the
north country of w^^^ merlonde fast by Comberlond and stands upon ye river
Eden the cite is (...) wondersly seen. Deem ye now where it is builded.
Tre^^sa. It is not hard to assoyle if men take heed that many towns bear one
name as Cartag^ in Africa and Cartago in spain. Newporte in wales and Newport
in ye parysshe of Barkeley / Worten under egg and worton passes / wy^war wyk
pain and wyk in ye parysshe of Barkeley / and two shyre towns either is
called Hampton / as Southampton and Northampton so it seems by the stories
that one Alcliud was in York shyre / an other in westmerlo^d / and one fast by
the right side of y^ west arm of y^ see that departs England and Scotlonde
/ But yt Alcliud was a right strong cite as Beda says / and y^ cite stands
fast by a river yt is called Cliud / and there is not such a river in
Yorkshyre nor in Westmerlonde as men of the country tell me. Some men say
that the river Cliud is now named Sulwatche. Sulwatche is but.v. (...) fro
Caerleyll / which is a cite in y^ ^ou^tre of north England toward y^ north
west / and has an other name / which is Luguball. Leyll the.vij. king of
Brito^s builded Caerleyll. R. In this cite is some what of yt famous wall that
passes Northumberlond. Wi^hel. de pon. In this cite is yet a three chambred
house made of vawte stones that never might be destroyed with tempest of wederne
with brennynge of fire. Also in y^ country fast by westmerlonde in y^ front of a
three chambred place is wryte^ in this manner Mar^ ^ictori. what this writing is
to say I doubt somewhat / but if it were so yt some of y^ Combres lay there
sometime when y^ consul Marius had put hy^ out of ^taly. But it seems better
yt it is written in mind of Marius king of Britons yt was Aruitagus sone. This
Marius ouer^ame in that place Rodryk king of Pictes / so says Gaufre in his
brytysshe ^oke / William malmes^ury saw never y^ book. At Hagulstaldes church
is a place.lxxx. mile out of york northwestward the place is as it were
destroyed / so says Wi^hel.li.iij. de pon* That place longed sometime to y^
bisshopriche of York / there were sometime houses with vice arches and bautes in
y^ mane^ of Rome / now yt place is called Hestoldesham and Heglesham also Beda
(...). (...). ca. (...). says that y^ place is fast by y^ long wall of the
work of Rome in the north half. R. There is difference between the prouynce
of Lindefar and the church Lindefarne. For the prouynce of Lyndefar and
Lyndesey is all one / and lies by eest Lyncolne / and Lincoln is the heed
thereof / of the which says Beda li.iiij. ca.xj. that Sexuulfus was first
bishop there. But Beda lib.iiij. ca.xxiij. says y^ Lyndefar church is an
ylond yt is called holy ylonde in the river of Twede next Barwyk. And so it is
gadred of Bedaes sawes yt Twede renneth in to y^ famous arm of y^ see y^ now
departs Englyssh men and Scotts in y^ eest half / and in that arm be^ three
ylondes / yt one is Maylros that now is called Menros. Tha^ about toward the
west is Lyndefarne church that is called holy ylo^de. Than ye third is above
upward / and is the yloude Far^e and is called also Feruy ylonde. Than upward
above that two mile is a ryall cite upon y^ brynke of Twede which some time
hight Bebamburgh yt is Bobbes cite / and now is called Bamburgh / and has a
right strong castle. Gir. in itinere Two ^ytees there ben either is called
Caerlegyon and Caerleon also / one is De(...)ecia in south wales that is called
Caeruske / also there the river of Vske falls in to Seuerne fast by
Glamorgan. Bellinus king of Britons sometime builded that cite / and was sometime
the chief cite of Demecia in south wales. Afterward in Claudius ^esars time it
was called y^ cite Legyons when at y^ prayer of Genius the queen / Vaspasianus
and Aruiragus were accorded / and Legyons of Rome were sent in to Irlonde / tho
was Caerleon a noble cite and of great auctorite / and by the Romans ryally
builded and walled about with walls of brent tyle. Great noblesse yt was there
in old time is there yet in many places seen / as the great palayses /
gyau^tes toures / noble bathes / ^eleef of y^ temples places of the atrees /
that were places high and ryall to stand and sit in / and to behold about.
The places were ^yally closed with ryall walls that yet so(...)dele stands
^yght nygh close. And within y^ walls and without is great building vndererth
/ water co^duytes and ways vndererth / and stews also y^ shalt se wonderly
made with strayte side ways of brethyng that wonderly cast up hete. In this cite
were sometime three noble chirches / one was of saint Julius y^ martyr / and
therein a great company of virgins. That other was of saint Aaron that was of y^
order of black chauons / yt church was right nobly aourned. The third church
was the chief mother church of all Wales / and the chief see. But after ward
y^ chief see was turned out of that cite in to Meneuia / that is saint David's

Albon. There y^ messengers of Rome came to great Arthurs court / if it is
le^ull to believe Treui^a / if Giraldus was in doubt whether it were lefull to

in mind and ever be in doubt if all his ^okes were such / what lore were

tells what ineueth him so to say. R. There is an other cite of Legyons there
his Cronyeles were betrauayled as it is clearly known by y^ first tha^^tre of
this book. Tr^uisa. That is to understand in the la^yn writing. For he y^ made
it in latin turned it not in to Englisshe in y^ same place that it was first in
la^yn. The understanding of hy^ that made this Crony^les is thus written in
latin in y^ begy^nynge of this book Presentem Cronican^ comp^^auit frat^r
Ranulphus Cestren^^s monachus. That is to say^ in Englisshe. Brother Ranulph
mon^e of Chestre compyled and made this book of the Cr^ny^^es. (...). The cite
of Legions that is Chestre ^tandeth in the March of England toward Wales by
twene two arms of the sea y^ (...) named De and Mersee. This cite in tym^ of

of this cite is unknown. For who y^ ^eeth the fou^dementes of y^ great ^^ones
would rather wene y^ it were Romans we^ke or work of gyauntes / than it were

Ca(...) leon / Legecestria in latin / and Chestre (...) English / and y^ cite
of Legyons also. For there lay a winter y^ legyons of knights that Julius
Cezar sent for to win Irlond. And after Claudius Cezar sent Legyons out of
that cite for to w^nne y^ ylonde yt he called Or^ades. What ever Wyllyam

This cite (...)yueth great marcha^^^se and sends out also. Also nygh this

and other noble m^nes also with the writing about. This is the cite that
Ethe^^^ide king of Northumberlonde destroyed / and (...)we there fast by nygh
two thousand monks of the mynster of Bangor. This is the cite that king
Edgar came thither sometime with.vij. ky^ge^ y^ were ^u^g^^^ to him. I meter
breketh out in this manner in pray^yng this cit^. Chestre* castle town / as it
were / name takes of a castle. It is unknown what man builded this cite now.
Tho legecestria chees hight now town of Legyones. Now Waisshe and Englisshe
hold this cite of great price. Stones on walls seems work Hercules all.
There long with might / to dure yt hepe is hight. Saxon small stones / set

That helps with sondes many men of western lands. Fysshe flesh and corn

king / earth is there dwelling. Of king Haralde / powder is there yet y
halde. Bachus and Mercurius / Mars and Venus. Also Lauerna / Protheus and Pluto
/ regne there in the town. Treuisa. God wot what this is to mean / but poets
in their manner speech feign as though every kind craft and living had a
diverse god eueryche from other. And so they feigned a god of battle and of
fyghtyng and called hy^ Mars / and a god of couetyse and richesse and
marchau^dyse / and called him Mercurius And so Bachus is called god of wine.
Venus goodesse of love and beauty. Lauer ua god of their and of robbery.
Protheus god of falshede and of gyle / and Pluto god of hell. And so it seems
that these verses would mean that these foresaid gods regne and ben served in
Chestre. Mars with fyghtyng and cockynge. Mercurius with couetyse and richesse.
Bachus with great dry^kyng. Venus with love lewdly. Lauerna with thefre and
robbery. Procheus with faishede and gyle. Tha^ is Pluto not unserved that is god
of hell. R. There Babylon lore / more might has troth the more.

Of prouynces and Shyres. Ca.x.
Take heed that England conteyneth.xxxij. shyres and prouynces / yt now ben
called erledomes / reserved Cornewayle and yt ylonde. Alfre. These ben the
names of yt erledomes and shires. Kent Southsex / Sothery / Namshyre / Barok
shyre that has his name of a bare oak yt is in the forest at wyndsore / for at
yt bare oak men of that shyre were wo^t to come together and make their treatyes
/ and there take counsel and advise. Also Wylshyre that hight sometime the
prouynce of Semera^ / Somerset / Dorset / Deuen shyre / that now is called
Deuonia in latin. These.ix. south shyres the Tamyse departs from the other
dele of England which were sometime governed and ruled by the westsaxons law.
Eestsex / Myddelsex / Southsex / Northfolke / Herford shyre / Huntyngdon shyre
/ Northamton shyre / Cambrydge shyre / Bedfordshyre / Boky^gham shyre /
Leycestre shyre / Der by shyre / Notyngham shyre / Lyncolne shyre / Yorkeshyre
/ Durham shyre / Northumberlonde / Caerleylshyre / with Cumberlonde /
Appelbyshyre / with Westmer land / Lancastre shyre that conteyncth five little
shyres. These.xv. North and Eest shyres were sometime governed and ruled by the
law called Mercia in latin and Marchene law in English. It is to wit that
York shyre stretches from yt river of Humber unto yt river of Teyse And yet
in York shyre ben.xxij. hondredes / hundred and candrede is all one. Candrede
is one word made of walssue and Irysshe / and is to menynge a country that
conteyneth an hundred towns / and is also in English called wepentake / for
sometime in the coming of a new lord tenau^tes were wont to yield up their
wepen instead of homage. Durhamshyre stretches from the river of Teyse unto
yt river of Tyne. And for to speak properly of Northumberlond it stretches fro
the river of (...) unto the river of T^o^de That is in ye begynnyngs of
ScotlondeTha^ y^ y^ co^tree of North^mberlonde that was sometime from ^umber

Than ben in England but.xxii. shyres / but if the country of Northumberionde be

hewn town and the land new tylled / and made much more than was at that
time / and many towns and vyllages buyiden / and so there be many moo vyllages
and (...) now than were at that time. And where as before is written that
Cornewayle is not fet among the shyres of England / it may stand among them
well enough for it is neither in wales nor in Scotlonde / but it is in England
/ and it loyneth unto Deuenshyre / and so may there be accounted in

Mercia queen of Brytous yt was Gwyl telinus wife / of her the prouynce had yt

and was called Merchene law. Gyis das that wrote the Cronyeles and hysto ryes
of the Brytons / turned these two laws out of Brytons speech in to laryn. And
afterward king Aluredus turned all out of latin in to Saxons speech / and was
called Merchene law. Also yt same king Aluredus wrote in English / and put
to another law yt hight westsaron law. Than afterward Danis were lords in
this land / and so came forth the third law that hight Dane law. Of these
threlawes saint Edward yt third made one common law / that yet is called saint
Edwardes law. I hold it will done to write and expowne many terms of these

Of kingdoms / of bounds and marks between them. Ca.xii.
THe kingdom of Brytayne stood without departing hole and all one kingdom to
the Brytons / from the first Brute unto Julius Cezars time / and fro Julius
Cezars time unto Seuerus time this land was under trybute to yt Romans.
Nevertheless kings they had of yt same land from Seuerus unto the last
prince Gracian successors of Brytayn failed / and Romans reigned in Brytayn.
Afterward the Romans left of their regnynge in Brytayne / because it was
fetre from Rome and for great besynes that they had on yt other side. Than
Scotts and Pietes by mysledynge of Maximus the tyrau^t pursued Brytayn / and
warred there with great strength of men of arms long time / unto the time
that the Saxons came at the prayenge of the Brytons against the Pictes / and
put out Gurmond the Irysshe king with his Pictes / and the Brytons also with
their king that hight Careticus / and drove them out of England into Wales.
And so yt Saxons were vyctoryous / and every prouynce after his strength made
him a king. And so departed England in to seven kingdoms. Nevertheless
afterward these seven kingdoms euerychone after other (...) all in to one
kingdom. All hole un (...) the prince Adelstoue. Nevertheless (...) ^^nes
pursued this land fro Adei(...) time that was Alurents fader unto the thy(...)
abouts au.C.lxx. (...) (...)lly therein.xxil. (...)re And after him Haralde
h^lde the kingdom.ix. mouethes. And after him. Nor man's have reigned unto this
time / but how long they shall regue he to whom no thing is unknown. (...)
Of yt foresaid seven kingdoms and their marks mares and bounds / when they
began / and how long they endured / here shall I somewhat shortly tell. Alfre.
The first kingdom was yt kingdom of Kent / yt stretches fro the eest Occean
unto yt river of Tamyse. There reigned the first Engystes / and began to regne
by the accountynge of Dionyse the year of our lord A.C.lv. that kingdom dured
iii.C.lviij. year.xv. kings / unto yt time that king Baldrede was put out /
and Egbert king of westsaxon joined that kingdom to his own. The second king
dome was at Southsaxon / that had in the eest side kent / in the south the sea
and the isle of wight / in the west Hamshyre and in the north sothery / there
Ella reigned first with his three sons / and began to regne the year after the
coming of yt Angles even.xxx. But that kingdom within short time passed in
to the other kingdoms. The third kingdom was of Eestsaxon / and bad in the
eest side the sea / in the west the country of London / in the fouth Temse /
and in yt north Southfolke. The kings of this cou^^^^ of westsaron fro the
first Sebertes time unto yt time of the Danes were.x. kings / the which were
subgecte somdele to other kings. Nevertheless o^t est and longest they were
under the kings of Merci^ / and (...) to the time y^ Egbert the king of
westsaxon joined y^ kingdom was to his own. The fourth kingdom was of Eest
(...) gles / and conteyneth Northfolke and South folk / and has in the east
side and in the north side the sea / and in y^ north west Came bridge shyre / in
y^ west saint Comondes dyche and Herfordshyre / and in y^ south Essex. And this
kingdom duted under twelve kings / unto the time y^ king Edmond was slain.
And than the Danes took wrongfully both the kingdoms of eest Angles and of
eest Saxon. Afterward the Danes were put out and dryuenawaye / or made
subgecte. And than the elder king Edward joined both the ky^gdomes to his
orane. The fyfth king dome was of westsaxon / and dured longest of all these
kingdoms / and had in the eest side fouthsaxon / in the north Tamyse / in the
south and in the west the sea Occean In that kingdom reigned Serdryk with his
sone Kenryke / and began to regne the year of our lord god.v.C. and.xix. and
than after the coming of Angles.lxxi. so says Denis the other kingdoms
passed in to this kingdom. The syxth kingdom was of Mercia / and was gretest
of all. The marks and the meres there of were in the west side of the river De
fast by Chestre / and Seuarne fast by Shrowesbury unto Brystowe / in y^ eest
the eest see / in the south Tamyse unto London / in the north the river of
Humber / and so westwarde and downwarde unto the river Mersee unto the corner
of wyrhall / there Number falls in to the west see. Penda Wyvves sone reigned
first in this kingdom in the year of our lord Jesu Christ.vi. C.xxvi. so
says Denis / and fro the coming of Angles an hundred.lxxv. year. This
kingdom dured under.xviii. kings about two hundred.lxiij. year / unto y^
last Colwulfe the Danes vetoke y^ kingdom to kept when Burdred the king was
put out / but the elder Edward the king put out the Danes / and joined the
kingdom of Mercia to his own kingdom. Nevertheless at the begyunynge this
kingdom of Mercia was departed in to three In west Mercia / in myddell Mercia /
and eest Mercia. The.vij. kingdom was Northamhymbrorum / yt is the kingdom of
Northumberionde / the meres and marks thereof were by west and by cest the sea
of Occean / by south yt tyuer of Humber / and so downward toward the west by yt
end of the shyres of Notyngham and of Derby unto the river of Merses / and by
north the Scotts see / that hight forth in Scotts / weres in Britysshe / y^
Scot tysshe see in English. This kingdom of Northumberlonde was first deied
in two prouynces. That one was y^ south side and hight Deyra / and that other
was y^ north side and hight Brenicia / as it were two kingdoms / and the river
departed these two kingdoms that time / for the kingdom of Deyra was from y^
river of Humber unto the river of Tyne. The kingdom of Brenicia was fro Tyne
to the Scottysshe see. And when Pirres dwelled there as Beda says li.iij.
ca.ii. That Ninian y^ holy man co^uetted men of the south side. Ida the king
reigned there first / and began to regne the year of our lord.v.C. and.xlvij.
so says Denis. In Deyra reigned king Elle the year of our lord.v. C.xlix.
These two kingdoms were other while (as it is said) departed between two
kings / and sometime all hole under one king / and dured as it were.xx.
English kings.CCC.xxi. year. At y^ last Osbartus and Elle were slain in
the.ix. year of their kingdom the Danes slew them / and Northumberlonde was
void without king.viii. year Than afterward the Danes reigned in
Northumberlonde.xxxvi. year / unto the onynge of y^ kingdom. Adeistone made
subgecte the kings / Danes / scottysshe and walsshe / and reigned first alone
in Englonge / and held y^ kingdom of England all hole and all one kingdom /
that was the year of our lord. viij.C.xxviij. That tyuer of Mer^ee was sometime
mark and mere between the kingdom of Mercia and the kingdom of
Northumberlond that may be showed in two manners / first by this properte of
this Mersee / that is as much to say as a see y^ is a bound and a mere / for
it departs one kingdom from an other. Also it is written in Chronicles of
Henry and Alfrede y^ king Edward y^ elder fastened a castle at Ma^cestre in
Northumberlond / but y^ cite Ma^cestre is fro the tyuer of Mersee scarsely three
mile.

Of bysshopryches and of their sees. Ca.xiij.
IVrius was the first king chrystened of y^ Brytons / in his time were three
archebysshoppes sees in Brytayne / oue was at London / an other at york / and
the third at Cacrusk the cite of Legyo^s in Glamorgan / that cite is now
called Caerleon. To these archebisshops sees were subge^te.xxviij. bishops /
and were called Flammes. To the archebysshops see of London was subgecte Corn
wayle and all myddell England unto Humber. To york all Northumberlonde from
the bow of Humber with all Scotlo^de. To Caerleon all Wales / there were in
wales.vij. bisshops / and now ben but.iiij. Tho Seuarne departed England and
Wales. Withel. de pon. lib.iij. But in the Saxons time / though saint Gregory
had granted London the preuilege of the archebysshops see / nevertheless saint
Austyn that was sent in to England by saint Gregory turned y^ archebysshops
^^e out of London in to Canterbury. After saint Gregoryes days at y^ prayer of
king Ethe^bryght and citezyns and burgeyses of cauterbury / there y^
archebisshops see has (...) unto now / save that in y^ (...) time Offa king of
Mercia was (...) men of Caunterbury / and bena^ them y^ worship / and
worshypped Adulphe bishop of Lychfeld with the arch^bisshops pall by assent of
Adrian y^ pope upon case by gifts sent. Nevertheless under Kenulphe y^ king it
was restored to Caunterbury again. The worship of y^ see of york has dured
there always and yet dureth / though Scotlond be withdrawn fro his subgeccion
by passing of time. Gir. in it inere li.j. The archebisshops see was turned
out of Caerleon i to Meneuia / that is in y^ west side of Demi^i^ upon the
Irysshe see in saint Dauyds time under king Arthur. From saint Dauyds time
unto Sampsons time were in Meneuia.xxiij. archebysshops. Afterward fell a
pestylence in all Wales of y^ yelowe evil / y^ is called the Iau^dys And tha^
Sampson y^ archebysshop took with him y^ pall and went in to Brytayne Armonica
y^ less Brytayn / and was there bishop of Dolensis / from y^ time unto y^
first Hentyes time king of England were at Meneuia which is called saint
David's.xxi. bishops all without pall / whether it were for vncunnynge or for
pouerte. Nevertheless always fro y^ time the bishops of Wales were satted of y^
bishop of Meneuia of saint D^uyds / and the bishop of Meneuia was sacred of
y^ bishops of Wales as of his suffrigans and made no professyon ne subgeccio^
to none other church. Other bishops y^ came afterward were sacred at
Canterbury by co^pellyng and h^est of y^ king / in token of y^ sacrynge and
subgeccyon / Boniface archebysshop of Canterbury y^ was legate of the Cross
song in every Cathedral church of Wales solempnely. Amas he was y^ first
arch^bisshop of Canterbury that so did in Wales / and that was done in the
second Henryes time. (...). But now ben but two prymates in all England / of
Caunterbury and of York. To the prymate of Caunterbury ben subgecte.xiij.
bishops in England and.iiij. in wales The prymate of york has but two suf
frigans in England / y^ ben y^ bisshops of Caer^^yl and of Durham. Of all
these sees and chaungynge of their places I shall show you here following. Take heed in the begyunynge of holy church in England bishops ordained their sees
i^ low places and simple y^ were ^ou^nable for co^ templacyon / for prayers
and deuocyo^. But in Willyam conquerours time by dome of law canon it was
ordained that bishops (...) come out of small towns in to great ^tees /
therefore was y^ see of Dor chestre ^hau^ged to Lyncolne. Lychfelde to Chestre.
Tetford to Norwiche. Shyr borne to Salysbury. Wells to Bathe. Cornewayle to
Excestre / and Selesey to Chychestre. The bishop of Rochestre has no parysshe
/ but he is the archebysshops chapelayn of Canterbury. Since y^ see of
Ca(...)erbury was first ordained by saint Austin / it changed yet never his
place. Chichestre has under hy^ only Sussex and y^ isle of wight / and had his
see first in Selesey in the time of the archebysshop Theodore / and y^ see
dured there.ccc.xxxiii. year under.xx. bishops fro y^ first Wilfrede unto y^
last Stygande at y^ commandment of king Wyllyam conqueror changed y^ see
fro Selesey to Chichestre.

D^ episcopis occide^talibus. Wilhelmus
Have mind that all y^ prouynce of westsaxon had always one bishop fro y^
begy^nynge unto Theodorus time by grant of king I(...) king of westsaxon the
first Birinus ord^yned a see at Dorchestre that is a simple town by south
Oxforde beside Walyngford between y^ metynge together of ^emse and Came. When
Birinus was deed / kenwaltus the king ordained a see at Wynchestre as his
^aber had putposed / there Agylbert a Fre(...)sshman was first bishop of all
the province of westsaxon / fro y^ time thecite and the sea of Dorchestre
p^^^eyned to the prouynce of Mercia / y^ cite stands within Temse / and the
Temse departs between Mercia and westsaxon. After that Agilbert was put out
of Wynchestre / y^ tho hight Wynton / than was there an English bishop y^
was calle^ Wine. Some men suppose y^ this cite has the name of this Wine / and
is called Wynchestre / as it were wine cite. At y^ last he was put out / and
after him came Leutherius y^ foresaid Ag^^berts neuewe. After Leuthertus Hedda
a while was bishop there / when he was deed Theodorus y^ archebysshop ordained
two bishops to the province of westsaxon. D(...) at wynchestre / to hy^ were
subgect two cou^t^^^s Southery and Southamshyre / and to him were subgecte.vi.
^ou^trees / Barkshyre / wylshyre / Somerset / Dorsetshyre / D^^ uenshyre and
Cornewayle. (...). It seems by this that westsaxon co^^^yned Southery /
Southamshyre / Dor^^^shyre / Deuenshyre / and Cornewayle. W(...)hell. Afterward
in elder Edwardes time to these two sees were ordained by commau^deme^t of
Formosus y^ pope.iij. other sees / at wells for Somerset / at kyrton for
Deuenshyre / and at saint Germayn for Cornewayle. Not long afterward the
syxth see was set at (...)bury for wylshyre. At y^ last by commandment of king
Willyam conqueror all these sees (sau^ wynchestre) were turned and changed
out of small towns in to great Cytees / for Shyrborne and Kammesbury were
turned in to Salysbury. Now to that see is subgecte Barkshyre / wylshyre and
Dorset The sea of wells was turned to Bathe thereto is now subgecte all
Summers(...). The sees of Kyrton and of Cornewayle (...) changed to Excestre /
thereto is sub(...) and Cornewayle.

De orientalibus episcopis.
IT it known that the erst Saxons always fro the begyunynge to now were
subgecte to the bishop of London But y^ prouynce of ^^st Angles that
conteyneth Norfolk and Suffolk had one bishop at Donwyk / the bishop hight
Felix / and was of Bu^goyne / and was bishop.xvij. year. After hy^ Thomas was
bishop.v. year / after hy^ Boniface. xvi^. year. Than Bysy afterward was
ordained by Theodorus / and ruled the prouynce while he might endure by
himself alone After him unto Egbertes time king of Westsaxon an.C.xliij. two
bishops ruled that prouynce / one at Donwyk / and an other at Elyngham.
Nevertheless after Ludecans time king of Mercia left and was only one see at
Elyngham unto the fyfth year of William conqueror when Herfastus the* xxiij.
bishop of the estrene changed his see to Tetford / and his successor
Herbertus changed the sea fro Tetford to Norwytche / by y^ leave of king
Wyllyam the reed. The sea of Ely that is nygh thereto the first king Henry
ordained the.ix. year of his regne and made subgecte thereto Cambrydge shyre /
that was tofore a part of the by^shopryche of Lyncolne / and for ^uytyng
thereof he gave to y^ bishop of Lyncolne a good town called Spaldynge.

De episcopis Mertiorum. Wilhelmus.
HEre take heed y^ as the kingdom of Mercia was always gretest for the time /
so it was deled in moo bishop tyches / and specially by great heart by king
Offa / which was.xl. year king of Mercia / he changed y^ a^chebysshops see
fro Caunterbury to Lythfelde by ass^^t of Adryan the pept. Than the pro(...) of
Mercia and of Linde^^at in the first beginning of their (...) in king
wulfrans time had one bishop of Lychfelde / the first bishop that was there
hight Dwyn^ / the second hight Celath / and were both Scotts / after them y^
third Trumphere / y^ fourth Iarmuanus / the fyfth Chedde. But in Edelfredes
time that was Wulfrans brother when Chedde was deed / Theodorus the archebysshop
ordained there wynfrede Cheddes deken. Nevertheless apud Hyndon after that for
he was vnbuxom in some point / he ordained there Sexwulf abbot of Medamstede
that is named Burgh. But after Sex wulfes fourth year / Th(...)us y^
archbysshop ordained.v. bishops in the prouynce of Mercia / and so he ordained
Bosell at Worcestre / Cudwyn at Lychfelde / y^ foresaid Sexwulfe at ^hestre /
Edelwyn at Lyndesey at the cite Sidenia: and he to^^ EWord^ m^nke of the abbey
of Hylde a^ whythy and made him bishop of Dorchestre ^e side Oxford. tho hight
this Dorch estre Dorkynge / and sh y^ sce of y^ longed to westsaxon / in saint

king of Mercia had destroyed kent / this bishop Sex^wulfe took Pirtas bishop
of Rochestre y^ came out of Kent and made him first bishop of Herford. At y^
last when Sexwulfe was deed Hedda was bishop of Lychfelde after h(...) wylfred
flemed out of Northu^berlo^d was bishop of Chestre / neuerthe ^es after two
year Alfred king of North^ berloude dyed and wylfred turued again to his own
see Hagustalden / and so Hedda held both y^ bysshopriches of Lichfelde and
Ehestre. After h^ came Albyn y^ hight wor^lso / and after ^y^ came three
bishops. Tortant Chestre / witta at Lychfelde / and Eata was yet at
dorchestre. A^^ his ^eth bisshops of Lyndsey held his see.ccc. ^^iij year unto
^emigius changed y^ see to Lyncoln by leave of y^ first king william. But in
^ogars time bishop Leofwinus wyned both bisshopryches togider of Chestre and
Lyndeffar while his life endured.

De episcopis Northumbranis. Withel. de pon.li. ca.xj.
AT York was one see for all the prouynce of Northumberlo^de. Paulmus held
first y^ see / and was ordained of y^ bishop of Canterbury / and held that
see of York.vii. year. Afterward when king Edwyn was slain and things were
dystroubled / Paulinus weat away thens by water in to Kent from whens he came
first / and ^oke with him the pall. Withel.li.iii. And so the bishop rich of

was made bishop of york. Beda li.iiii. But while he dwelled long in France
about his sacrynge at excytynge of qua(...) / y^ were they that held ^^ster
day the.xiiii. day of y^ moan. Chedde was taken out of his abbey of Listynge
and wrongfully put out into y^ see of york by assent of king Oswy. But three
year afterward Theoderus y^ arche bishop did him away / and assygned by to
the ^uynce of Mercia / and restored will frede to y^ s(...) york. But after
because of wrath y^ was between him and y^ king Egfryde was put out of y^ see
by Theodorus help y^ archebysshop / y^ was corrupt with some manner mede /
this was done after that wilfred had be^ bishop of york / and Cumbert at
Hagustalde chie ^he / and Eata at Lyndeffat church / y^ now is called holy
ylonde in y^ river of Twede Aydanus found first y^ see. And Theodo rus made
Eadhedus bishop of Repoun that was comen again out of Lyndesey Wilfred had be^
abbot of Repoun. Theodorus sent Trunwynus to the land of Pictes in the ends
of England fast by Scotlo^de in a place y^ hight Candida ^a sa / and whyterne
also / there saint Hu^an a Bryton was first fou^der and doctor. But all these
sees outtake york failed little (...) little / for y^ see of Cand^o^ ca^a / y^
is Galleway that tho longed to England and dured many years under.x. bishops
unto y^ it had no power by destroyenge of the Pictes. The sees of Hagustaide
and of Lyndeffar was sometime all one under ix. bishops about.lxxxx. year /
and durrd unto y^ coming of the Danes. In that time under Hyngar and Hubba
Ardu^ the bishop went long about with said Cutbertes body unto king
Aluredes time king of westsaxon / and the sea of Lyn deffar was set at
Kunegestre y^ is called Kunyngy sourgh also / that place is called now
Vbbesford upon ^wede. At the last the.xvii. year of king Egberr king Edgars
sone / that see was changed to Dutham / and saint Cutbertes body was brought
thither by y^ doing of Edmond the bishop / and fro y^ time forward y^ sees of
Hagustalde and Lyndeffar failed utterly. The first king Henry in the.ix. year
of his regne made the new see at Caerleyll. The arche byssop of Canterbury
has under him.xiii. bishops in England / and.iiii. in wales / he has
Rochestre under him / and y^ see has under by a part in Kent alone. London
has under him Essex / Myddelsex a half Act fordshyre. Chychestre has under
him Southse / and the isle of wight. Wynchestre has under him Hamshyre and
Southery. Salysbury has under h^ Barkshyre / Wylshyre / Dorset. Ex(...)re has
under him Deuenshyre and Cornewayle. Both has under him Somerletshyre alone.
Wortestre has under him Glocestreshyre / Worcestreshyre / and half
Warwykshyre. Herford has under him Herfordshire and some of Shropshyre.
Chestre is bishop of Coue^tre and of Lychfelde / and has under hy^
Chestreshyre / Staffordshyre / Derbyshyre / half Warwykshyre / and some of
Shropshyre / and some of Lancastreshyre fro the river of Mersee unto y^ river
Rypyll. Lyncolne has under him the prouynces y^ ben between Temse and Humber
that been the shyres of Lyncolne / of Leycestre / of Northamton / of Hunt yngdon
/ of Bedford / of Bokyngham / of Oxforde and half Herfordshyre. ^ly has under
hy^ Cambrydgshyre outtake Merlonde. Norwyche has under him Merlonde / Norfolk
and Suffolk. Also y^ archcbysshop of Canterbury has four suffrigans in wales
that been Landaf / saint Dauyes Bangor / and saint (...)aph. The archebysshop of
york has now but two bisshops under him / y^ is Durham and Caerleyll. (...).
And so ben but two prymates in England / what of them shall do to the other /
and in what mener point he shall be obedyent and under him / it is fully
contained within about y^ year of our lord god M.lxxij. tofore y^ first king
Willyam and the bishops of England by commandment of y^ pope the cause was
handled and treated between the foresaid prymates and ordained and demed that
the prymate of York shall be subgecte to the prymate of Canterbury in things
y^ l^ngen to the worship of god and to y^ ^yleue of holy church / so that in
what place so ever it be in England y^ the prymate of Canterbury (...) hold
and constrayne to gader a counseyle of clergy the pry^^ate of York is holden
with his suffrygans for to be there and for to be obedyent to y^ ordinance that
there shall be lawfully ordained. When the prymate of Canterbury (...) deed /
the prymate of York shall come to Canterbury and with other bishops he shall
sacre him y^ is chosen / and so with other bishops he shall sa^^e his own
prymate. If the prymate of York be deed / his successor shall come unto y^
bishop of Caunterbury / and he shall take his ordinance of him and take his
oath with possessyon and lawful obedyence. After about the year of our
lord.xi. C.lxxxxv. in y^ t(...) of king Richard ben reasons set for y^ right
party for either prymate / and what one prymate did to y^ other in time of
Thurstinus of Thomas and of other bisshops of York from the conquest unto
king Henryes time y^ third. Also there it is said how each of them starte
from other. This place is but a forspekynge and not a full treatise thereof /
therefore it were noyful to charge this place with all such reasons.

Of how many manner of people have dwelled therein. Ca.xiiij.
BRitons dwelled first in this ylond the.xviij. year of Hely y^ prophet
the.xj. year of Solinus postamus king of Latyns.xiiij. year after the taking
of Troy / ^ofore y^ building of Rome. (...)c.xxij. year. (...). They came
hither and took their (...) from Armonyk that now is that other Brytayne / they
held long time the s(...) countries of y^ (...). It b^fe^ afterward in
^aspa(...) time duke of Rome / y^ the P^etes shypped out of (...) in to (...) /
and were driven about w(...) wind / and entered in to the north co(...) of
Irlonde / and found there S^^ttes / and prayed them to have a place to dwell
in / and might ^one get. For Irlonde as Scotts said might not sustain both
people. Scotts sent the Pictes to the north side of England and behyght them
help against the Brytons y^ were their enemies / if they would arise / and
took them wives of their daughters / upon such condicyon if doubt fell / who
should have right to be king / they should rather chose hy^ of the moders side
than of y^ faders side / of the women kynne rather than of y^ men kynne.
Gaufre. In Vaspasyan y^ emperors time when Marius Aruiragus sone was king of
Brytons / one Rodryk king of Pictes came out of Scicia and began to destroy
Scotlonde. Marius the king slew this Rodryk / and gave y^ north party of
Scotlonde y^ hight Cathenesia to the men that were come with Rodryk and were
overcome by him / for to dwell in But these men had no wives / ne none might
have of y^ nation of Bryto^s / there fore they sailed in to Irlonde / and took
to their wives Irysshe me^nes daughters by y^ covenant that y^ moders blood
should be put tofore in succession of heritage. Gir. ca.xvij. Nevertheless
Sirinus super Virgiliu^sayth y^ Pictes agatirses y^ had some dwelling place
about y^ waters of Scicia / and they ben called Pictes of peyntynge and
smiting of wounds / therefore they are called Pictes as peynted men. These men
and these goths ben all one people. For when Maximus the tyrau^t was gone out
of Brytayne in to France for to occupy y^ empire. Than Gracianus and
Valentinianus y^ were brethren and fellows of the empire brought these goths
out of Scicia with great gifts / with flaterynge and fair byhestes in to the
north country of Brytayne. For they were stalworth and strong men of arms.
And so these thieves and brybouts were made men of land and of country and
dwelled in the north country / and held there cytees and towns. Gaufre.
Carancius the tyrant slew Bassianus / and gave the Pictes a dwelling place in
Albama that is Scotlonde / there they dwelled long time afterward and meddled
with Brytons. (...). Than since the Pictes occupied first the north side of
Scotlonde / it seems y^ the dwelling place y^ this Carancius gave them is y^
south side of Scotlonde / that stretches from the thwarte over wall of
Romans work to y^ Scottysshe see / and conteyneth Galleway and Lodouia that
is Lodeway. Therefore Bid(...).iij. ca.ij. speaks in this manner. N^^an the
holy man converted y^ south Pictes. Afterward the Saxons came and made y^
country long to Brenicia the north party of Northumberlonde / unto y^ time
that Kynadius Alpinus sone king of Scotlonde put out y^ Pictes / and made y^
country that lies between Twede and the Scottysshe see long to his kingdom.
Beda li.j. ca.j. Afterward long time y^ Scotts were led by duke Renda / and
came out of Irlonde that is the propre country of Scotts / and with love or
with strength made them a place fast by the Picces in the north side of the
arm of the sea that breketh in to the land in the west side / that departed
in old time between Britons and Pictes. Of this duke Renda the Scotts had y^
name and were called Dalrendinus / as it were Rendaes part / for in their
speech a part is called dal. Gir. pri. The Pictes might have no wives of
Brytons / but they took them wives of Iryssh Scotts / and promised them fair
for to dwell with them / and granted them a land by y^ see side / there y^
see is narowe. That land is now called Galleway. Marianus. Irysshe Scotts
londed at Argall y^ is Scotts clyf for Scotts londed there for to do harm to
y^ Britons / or for y^ place is next to Irlo^d for to come a land in Brytayn.
Beda. And so the Scotts after y^ Britons and Pictes made y^ third people
dwelling in Brytayn. R. Than after y^ came y^ Saxons at the prayenge of the
Brytons to help them against y^ Scotts and Pictes. And the Britons were soon
put out in to wales / and Saxons occupied the land little and little / and
efte more to the Scottysshe see And so Saxons made the fourth manner of men in
y^ ylonde of Brytayn. Beda lib.v. ca.ix. For Saxons and Angles came out of
Germania / yet some Bryto^s that dwell nygh call them shortly Germayns R.
Nevertheless about y^ year of our lord. viij.C. Egbartus king of Westsaxon
commanded and bad al men call y^ men of y^ land Englysshmen. Alfre. Than
after that the Danes pursued the land about a. ij.C. year / that is to say /
fro y^ foresaid Edbartus time unto saint Edwardes time / and made y^ fyfth
manner of people in y^ ylonde / but they failed after ward. At the last came
Normans unto duke Willyam and subdued Englysshmen and yet keep they y^ land /
and they made the syxth people in y^ ylonde. But in the first king Henryes
time came many Flemynges and received a dwelly^ge place for a time beside
Maylros in the west side of England / and made the seventh people in the
ylonde. Nevertheless by commandment of the same king they were put thens and
driven to Hauerfordes side in y^ west side of wales. R. And so now in Brytayn
Danes and Pictes fail all out / and five nacyons dwell therein / that been
Scotts in Albania / that is Scotlonde. Brytayne in Cambria / y^ is Wales / but
that Flemynges dwell in / y^ is west Wales. And Normans and Englysshmen ben
meddled in all y^ ylo^de / for it is now doubt in stories how and in what manner
they were put away and destroyed out of Brytayn. Now it is to declare how y^
Pictes were destroyed and failed. Gir.j. ca.vij. Brytayn was sometime occupied
with Saxons / and peace was made and stablisshed with y^ Pictes / than y^
Scotts y^ came with the Pictes saw y^ the Pictes were nobler of deeds and
better men of arms though they were less in nombre than y^ Scotts. Than the
Scotts having thereof envy turned to their natural treason y^ they have often
used. For in treason they pass other men / and be^ traitors as it were by
kind / for they prayed all the Pictes / and specially the gretest of them to a
feast / and waited their time when the Pictes were merry and had well drunk
they drew up nails y^ held up holowe benches under the Pictes / and the
Pictes unware suddenly fell in over y^ hammes in to a wonderful pytfall. Than
y^ Scotts fell on y^ Pictes and slew them / and left none alive. And so of
two manner people the better warryours were al destroyed But the other that been
y^ Scotts which ben traitors all unlike to y^ Pictes took profit by that
falls treason / for they took all that land / and hold it yet unto this time /
and call it Scotlo^de after their own name. In king Edgarus time Kynadius
Alpinus sone was duke and (...)der of the Scotts / and warred in Picte land
and destroyed the Pictes. He warred six times in Saxon / and took all y^ land
that is between Twede and y^ Scottysshe see with wrong and with strength.

Of the la^guages / of manners and usage of the people of that land. Ca.xv.
AS it is known how many manner of people ben in this ylonde there ben also so
many languages and tongues. Nevertheless W(...)n and Scotts that been not meddled
with other nacyons keep yet their language and speech. But yet y^ Scotts that
were sometime confederate and dwelled with Pictes draw somewhat after their
speech. But the Flemynges y^ dwell in the west side of Wales have left their
strange speech and speak like to saxons. Also Englysshmen though they had fro
y^ beginning three manner of speches / southern northern / and myddle speech
in y^ myddle of the land / as they come of three manner of people of Germania.
Nevertheless by co^mixcyon and medlynge first with Danes and afterward with Normans
/ in many things y^ country language is appayred / for some use strange
wlaffynge / chyteryng harryng / garryng and grysbytyng. This appayring of y^
language comes of two things. One because y^ children y^ go to scole learn to
speak first english / and tha^ ben compelled to construe their lessons in
frensshe / and that has be^ used sith y^ Normans came in to England. Also
gentylmens children ben learned and taught from their youth to speak Frensshe /
and vplondisshmen will cou^terfeyte and lyken them self to gentylmen / and are
besy to speak frensshe for to be more set by / wherefore it is said by a common
proverb. Jack would be a gentylma^ if he could speak frensshe Treuisa. This
was much used tofore the great death / but sith it is somdele changed / for
sir John Cornewayle a master of gra^mer changed y^ techynge of gra^mer scole
and co^struccyon of frensshe in to english. And other scole masters use y^
same way now / in the year of our lord. M.CCC.lxxxv. the.ix. year of king
Rychard y^ second / and leave all frensshe in scoles and use all construccyon
in english wherein they have auau^tage one way / that is y^ they learn the
sooner their gra^mer / and in an other disauau^tage / for now they learn no
frensshe / nor can none / which is hurt to them y^ shall pass the sea. And
also gentylmen have much left to teache their children to speak Frensshe. R.
It seems a great wonder y^ Englysshmen have so great diversity in their own
language in sown and in speking of it / which is all in one ylonde. And y^
language of Normandy is comen out of an other land / and has one manner sown
among all other y^ speak it in England / for a man of kent / southern /
western and northern men speak frensshe all like in sown and speech / but
they can not speak their englisshe so. Treuisa. Nevertheless there ben as many
diverse manner of frensshe in the realm of France / as diverse english in y^
realm of England. R. Also of the foresaid tongue which is departed in three
is great wonder / for men of y^ eest with men of y^ west accord better in
sownynge of their speech than men of y^ north with men of y^ south. Therefore it
is y^ men of merc(...) y^ ben of myddle England as it were partyners with y^
ends / understand better the side languages northern and southern than
northern and southern understand either other. Wilhel. de pon.li. (...). All
y^ language of the northumbres and specially at York is so sharp shyteynge /
fro^^yng and vnshappe / y^ we southern men may uneath understand y^ language.
I suppose the cause be y^ they be nigh to y^ alyens y^ speak strau^gely. Also
y^ kings of England abide and dwell more in y^ south country tha^ in y^
north country / because there is better corn land / more people / more noble
citees / and more profitable havens in the south country than in y^ north
country.

De gentis huius moribus. Gir. in (...)ere.
FOr y^ manners and doing of walssh men and of Scotts ben tofore somewhat
declared. Now I purpose to tell and declare y^ condicyons of y^ myddle people
of England. But the Flemynges y^ ben in y^ west side of Wales ben now all
turned as they were Englisshmen / because they company with Englysshmen. And
they be mighty and strong to fight / and ben the most enemies that Walshmen
have / and use marcha^dyse and clothing and ben full ready to put themself in
auentures and to peril in y^ see and land because of great wynnyng / and ben
ready sometime to the plowe / and sometime to deeds of arms when time and place
a^eth. It seems of these men a great wonder y^ in a bone of a wethers right
sholder when the flesh is soden away and not roasted they know what has be
done / is done and shall be done / as it were by spirit of propheeye and
wonderful craft. They tell what is done in far countrees / tokens of peace
or of war / the state of the realm / sleynge of men and spousebreche / such
things they declare ^^rtayne of tokens and signs that is in such a sholder
bone. R. But the Englysshmen y^ dwell in England ben meddled in y^ ylonde and
ben far from the places that they spronge of first turn to the contrary
deeds lightly without entycynge of any other men by their own assent. And un
easy also impatient of peace / enemies of besynes / and full of sloth. Wilhel.
de pon.li.iij. says. That when they have destroyed their enemies all to y^
ground than they fight with themself and slay each other / as a void and an
empty sto make werketh in it self. R. Neuerthel^sse men of the south ben easyer
and more mylde than men of y^ north. For they be more unstable / more cruel /
and more un easy. The myddle men ben parteners with both. Also they use them to
glotony more than other men / and ben more costlewe in meet and clothing. Men
suppose that they took yt vice of king Hardyknoght that was a Dane. For he
badde set forth ^wyes double mess at dinner and at souper also. These men ben
spedefull on horse and a foot / able and ready to all manner deeds of (...)s / and
ben wont to have vyctory and maystry in every fight where no treason is walkyng
/ and ben curyous and can well tell deeds and wonders that they have seen. And
they go in diverse lands / uneath ben any men rich in their own land or more
gracyous in far and in strange land / they can better win and get new
than keep their own heritage. Therefore it is that they be spradde so wide /
and wene y^ every land is their own. The men ben able to all manner of sleyght
and wit / but tofore y^ deed blonderynge and hasty / and more wise after the
deed than tofore / and leave of lightly what they have begone. Solinus li.vj.
Therefore Eugenius the pope said / that Englysshme^ were able to do what ever
they would / and to be set and put tofore all other / ne were yt light wit
lets. And as Hanyball said that y^ Romans might not be ouercome^ but in
their own country so Englysshmen may not be ouercome^ in strange lands / but
in their own country they be lightly ouercomen. R. These men despise their
own and praise other men / and uneath be pleased with their own estate / what
befalls other men yt they will gladly take to themself. Therefore it is yt a
yeman arayeth him as a squire a squire as a knight / a knight as a duke / a
duke as a king. Yet some go about and will be like to all manner state and be i^
no state / for they take every degree yt be of no degree / for i^ beryng outward
they be min strels and herawdes / in talkyng great spekers / in etyng and
dry^kyng glotons / in gaderyng of catell hucksters and tauerners / in array
turmentours / in wynnynges Argi / in travail Tan^ali / in taking head Dedali
/ i^ beds Sardanapali / in chirches mawmets / in courts thondre only / in
peruylege of clergy and in prebe^des they knowledge themself clerks. Treuisa.
As touching y^ terms of latin / as Argi / Ta^tali / Dedali / Sardinapali / ye
must understand them as y^ poets feyned of them. Argus was an herd and kept
beestes / he had an hundred eyes / and Argus was also a ship / a shipman /
and a chapman / and so Argus might se before and behind and on every side.
Therefore he that is wise and ware and can se that he be not deceived / may be
called Argus. And so the cronycle says in plurell nombre y^ Englysshmen ben
Argi / that is to say / they se about where as wynnyng is. That other word
Tantali / the poet feyneth that Tantalus slew his own sone / wherefore he is
dampened to perpetual penance / and he stands always in water up to the
nether lyppe / and has always ripe apples and noble fruit hanging down to
the over lyppe. But the fruit nor the water may not come wtin his mouth. He is
so holden and stands between meet and drink / and may neither ete nor drink
/ and is ever an hongred and a thyrst / that woo is him alive by this manner
lykenes of Tantalus / they that do right naught there as is much to do in
every side ben called Tantali. It seems that it is to say in travail they be
Tantali / for they do right naught thereto. The third word is Dedali / take heed that Dedalus was a subtle and a slye man. And therefore by lykenes they
that been subtle and slye / they ben called Dedali. And the fourth word is
Sardanapali / ye shall understand yt Sardanapalus was king of Assyryens / and
was full unchaste / and used him for to lie soft. And by a manner of lykenes of
him they that live unchastly be^ called Sardanapali. R. But among all
Englysshmen meddled togyders is so great a chau^gynge and diversity of clothing
and of array and so many manners and diverse shappes that well nygh is there any
man known by his clothing and his array of what someuer degree that he be.
Thereof prophesied an holy Anchor in ^ynge Egelfredes time in this manner.
Hen^i.li.vj. Englysshmen for as much as they use them to dronklewnes / to
treason / and to rechelesnes of gods ^ous / first by Danes / and than by
Normans / and at y^ third time by y^ Scotts that they hold the most
wretchest and leest worth of all other they shall be ouercome^. Than the world
shall be so unstable and so d^uers and varyable that y^ unstableness of
thoughts shall be betokened by many manner dyuersytees of clothing.

Here follows the description of the land of Wales.

Of the land of Wales. Ca.xvj.
NOw this book takes in hand
Wales after England
So take I my tales
And wend in to Wales
To that noble flode
Of Priamus blood
Knowledge for to win
Of great Iupyters kynne
For to have in mind
Dardanus kind
In these four tytles I fond
To tell the state of that land
Cause of the men I shall ^ell
And than praise the land and well
Than I shall write with my pen
All the manners of the men
Than I shall fo^de
To tell meruayles of the land.
Of the name / and wherefore it is named Wales. Ca. xvi^.
WAles now is called Wallia
And sometime it hight Cambria
For Camber Bru^es son
Was prince / and there did won
Than Wallia was to me^e
For Gwalaes the queen
King Ebrancus child
Was wedded thither mylde
And of that lord Gwalon
Withdraws of the soun
And put to.l.i. a.
And thou shalt find Wallia
And though this land
Be much less than England
As good glebe is one as other
In the daughter as in the mother.
Of the commodytees of the land of Wales. Ca.xviij.
Though that land be lyte
It is full of corn and of fruit
And has great plente ywys
Of flesh and e^e of fysshe
Of beestes tame and wild
Of horse sheep oxen mylde
Good land for all seeds
For corn gras and herbs that spredes
There ben wodes and medes
Herbs and flowers there spredes
There ben ryuers and wells
Valeys and also hills
Valeys bring forth flood
And hills metals good
Cooll grows under land
And gras above at hand
There lyme is copyous
And s^lattes for house
Honey and milk white
There is deynte and not lyte
Of braket meet and ale
Is great plente in that vale
And all that needs to the live
That land brings forth ryue
But of great richesse to be draw
And close many in short saw
It is a corner small
As though god first of all
Made that land so feel
To be seler of all hele
Wales is deled by
A water that hight Twy
North wales from the south
Twy deleth in places full couth
The south hight Demicia
And the other Venedocia
The first shoteth and arowes beres
That other deleth all with speres
In Wales how it be
Were sometime courts three
At Carmarthyn was that one
And that other was in Mon
The third was in Powysy
In Pegwern yt now is Shrowesbury
There were bishops seven
And now ben four even
Under Saxons all at hand
Sometime under princes of that land.
Of the manners and ryghtes of the walsshmen. Ca.xix.
^He manner living of that land
Is well diverse from England
In meet and drink and clothing
And many other doing
They ben clothed wonders well
In a shyrte and in a mantell
A cryspe breche well feign
Both in wind and in rain
In this clothing they be bold
Though the weder be right cold
Without shetes always
Evermore in this array
They go fight play and lepe
Stand sit lie and sleep
Without surcot gown cote and kyrtell
Without iopen tabarde cloak or bell
Without lace and chaplet y^ their lappes
Without hode hatte or cappes
Thus arrayed gone the segges
And always with bare legs
They keep none other going
Though they mete with the king
With arowes and short speres
They fight with them that them deres
They fight better if they need
When they go than when they ride
Instead of castle and toure
They take wodes and mareys for socour
When they seen it is to do
In fighting they would be a go
Gyldas says they ben varyable
In peace and not stable
If men ask why it be
It is no wonder for to se
Though men put out of land
To put out other would fond
But all for naught at this stounde
For all many wodes ben at ground
And put the sea among
Ben castles builded strong
The men may dure long un ete
And love well comune mete
They can ete and be mury
Without great cury
They ete breed cold and hot
Of barley and of ote
Broad cakes round and thynne
As well seems so great kynne
S^^de they ete breed of whete
And selde they done ones ete
They have gruell to potage
And lekes kind to companage
Also butter milk and chese
yshape endlonge and corner wese
Such messes they ete snell
And that makes them drink well
Meet and ale that has might
Thereon they spend day and night
Ever the reder is the wine
They hold it the more fine
When they drink at the ale
They tell many a lewd tale
For when drink is in handlynge
They ben full of jangling
At meet and after ^ke
Their solace is salt and leke
The husbonde in his wise
Tells that a great pryse
To give a caudron with growese
To them that sit at his mele
He deleth his meet at mele
And gives every man his dele
And all the over pluse
He keeps to his own use
Therefore they have woo
And myshappes also
They ete hot samon always
All though physyke say nay
Their houses ben low with all
And made of yerdes small
Not as in cytees nygh
But far asonder and not to high
When all is eten at home
Tha^ to their neighbors will they come
And ete what they may find and se
And than return home aye
The life is idle that they ledes
In brennynge slepynge and such deeds
Walsshmen use with their might
To wesshe their ghestes feet a night
If he wesshe their feet all and some
Than they know yt they be welcome
They live so casely in a route
That seldom they bear purse about
At their breche out and home
They hang their money and comb^
It is wonder they be so hende
And hate crack at nether end
And without any core
Make their wardrope at the door
They have in great mangery
Harp / tabour and pype for mynstralsy
They bear corpse with sorrows great
And blow loud horns of ghete
They praise fast Troyan blood
For thereof came all their broad
Nygh kynne they will be
Though they pass an hond^ed degr^
Above other men they will them dyght
And worship priests with their might
As angels of heaven right
They worship servants of god almight
Often gyled was this broad
And yerned battle all for wode
For Merlyns prophecye
And often for sortylegye
Best in manners of Brytons
For company of Saxons
Ben turned to better right
That is known as clear as light
They till gardyns field and towns
And draw them to good towns
They ride armed as would god
And go yhosed and yshodde
And sit fair at their mele
And sleep in beds fair and well
So they seem now in mind
More englysshmen than walsshe kind
If men axe why they now do so
More than they be wont to do
They lyuen in more pees
Because of their riches
For their catell should slake
If they used often wrake
Dread of loss of their good
Make them now still of mode
All in one it is brought
Have nothing and dread naught
The poet says a saw of prefe
The foot man syngeth to fore the thief
And is bolder on the way
Than the horse man rich and gaye
Of the meruayles and wonders of Wales. Ca.xx.
THere is a pole at Brechnok
Therein of fysshe is many a flok
Often he changes his hew on cop
And bears above a gardyn crop
Often time how it be
Shape of house there shalt thou se
When the pole is frore it is wonder
Of the noise that is there under
If the prince of the land hot
Birds sing well merry note
As meryly as they can
And syngen for none other man
Besides Caerleen
Two mile fro the town
Is a roche well bright of leem
Right against the son beem
Goldelyf that roche hight
For it shyneth as gold full bright
Such a flower in stone is naught
Without fruit if it were sought
If men could by craft undo
The veins of the earth and come thereto
Many benefyce of kind
Ben now hyd fro man's mind
And ben unknown yet
For defaute of man's wit
Great tresour is hyd in ground
And after this it shall be found
By great study and besynes
Of them that come after us
That old men had by great need
We have by besy deed.
Treuisa.
In books ye may read
That kind fails not at need
When no man had craft in mind
Than of craft halpe god and kind
When no techer was in land
Men of craft by gods hand
They that had craft so then
Taught forth craft to other men
Some craft that came not yet in place
Some men shall have by gods grace
R. An ylonde is with noise and strife
In west wales at Kardyfe
Fast by Seuarne stronde
Barry hight that ylonde
In the hither side in a chene
Shalt thou here wonder dene
And diverse noise also
If thou put thine eere to
Noise of leaves and of wind
Noise of metals thou shalt find
Frotynge of yren and whetstones y^ shalt here
Hetyng of ouens than with fire
All this may well be
By wawes of the sea
That breketh in their
With such noise and fare
At Penbroke in a stead
Fendes do often quede
And throws foul things inn
And despyseth also sin
Neither craft ne bedes may
Do thens that sorrow away
When it greueth so
To the men it bodeth woo
At Crucynar in west wales
Is a wonders buryales
Every man that comes it to se
Seems it even as much as he
Hole wepen there a night
Shall be broken or day light
At Nemyn in north wales
Alytell ylonde there is
That is called Bardysay
Monks dwell there always
Men live so long in that hurst
That the oldest dies furst
Men say that Merlyn there buried is
That hight also Siluestris
There were Merlyns tweyne
And prophesied beyne
One hight Ambrose and Merlyn
And was gotten by a gobelyn
In Demicia at Carmarthyn
Under king Vortygeryn
He told his prophecye
Even in Snowdonye
At the heed of the water of Coneway
In the side of mount ^ryry
Dynas embreys in walsshe
Ambrose hill in English
King Vortyger sat on
The water side and was full of wone
Than Ambrose Me^lyn proph^eyed
To fore him right tho
Treuisa.
What wyt^e would wene
That a fend might get a child
Some men would wene
That he may no such work welde
That fend that goth a night
Women full often to gyle
Incubus is named by right
And gyleth men otherwhyle
Succubus is that wight
God grant us none such vile
Who that comes in her gyle
Wonders hap shall he smyle
With wonders deed
Both men and women sede
Fendes will keep
With craft and bring an hepe
So fendes wild
May make women bear child
Yet never in mind
Was child of fendes kind
For without eye
There might no such child dye
Clergy makes mind
Death sleeth no fendes kind
But death slew Merlyn
Merlyn was ergo no gobelyn
Another Merlyn of Albyn land
That now is named Scotlonde
And he had names two
Siluestris and Calidonius also
Of that wode Calidony^
For there he told his prophecye
And hight Siluestris as well
For when he was in batell
And saw above a grysely kind
And fell anon out of his mind
And made no more abode
But ran anon unto the wode
Treuisa.
Siluestris is wode
Other wild of mode
Other else
That at the wode he dwelles
R.
Siluestris Merly^e
Told prophecye well and fine
And prophesied well sure
Under king Arthure
Openly and not so close
As Merlyn Ambrose
There ben hills in snowdonye
That been wonderful hye
With heyght as great a way
As a man may go a day
And hight eryty in walsshe
Snowy hills in English
In these hills there is
Leese enough for all beestes of walis
These hills on top beres
Two great fysshe wears
Contained in that one ponde
Meueth with the wind an ylonde
As though it did swymme
And nygheth to the brymine
So that herdes have great wonder
And wene that ye world meueth under
In that other is perch and fysshe
Every one eyed is
So fares all well
In Albama the mylwell
In Rutlonde by Tetynwell
There is a little well
That flows not always
As the sea twyes a day
But sometime it is dry
And sometime full by the eye
There is in northwallia
In Mon that hight Anglesia
A stone according well nygh
As it were a man's thygh
How far ever that stone
Be borne of any mon
On night it gooth home his way
That he found by assaye
Hugh thereto of Shrowesbury
In time of the first Henry
For he would the sothe find
That stone to another he began bind
With great cheynes of yren
And threw all I feren
Bound at one hepe
In to a water deep
Yet amorowe that stone
Was seen erly in Mon
A chorle held himself full slygh
And bound this stone to his thygh
His thygh was rotten or day
And the stone went away
If men done lechery
Nygh that stone by
Swote comes of that stone
But child comes there none
There is a roche right wondersly
The roche of herynge by country
Though there cry any man borne
And blow also with an horn
Noise there though thou abide
Thou shalt here none in this side
There is an other ylonde
Fast by Mon at hand
Hermytes there ben ryue
If any of them done strive
All the myce that may be get
Come and ete all their mete
Than cease never that woo
Till the strife cease also
As men in this land
Ben angry as in Irlonde
So saints of this countray
Ben also wretchefull always
Also in this land
In Irlonde and in Scotlonde
Ben belles and staves
That in worship men haues
And ben worshypped so then
Of clerks and of lewd men
That dreden also
To swear on any of tho
Staff either bell
As it were the gospel
At Basyngwerke is a well
That Sacer hight as men tell
It spryngeth so sore as men may se
What is cast in it throws aye
Thereof spryngeth a great stronde
It were enough for all that land
Seek at that place
Have both hele and grace
In the well ofter than ones
Ben found reed spercled stones
In token of the blood reed
That the maid wenefrede
Shed at that pyt
When her throat was kyt
He that did that deed
Has sorrow on his sede
His children at all stoundes
Bark as whelps and hounds
To pray to that maid for grace
Right at that well place
Either in Shrowesbury street
There that maid rests sweet.
Of the description of Scotlonde sometime named Albania. Ca.xxj.
IT is a common saw that the country which is now named Scotlonde is an
outstretchynge of the north side of Britayn / and is departed in the south side
from Britayn with arms of yt see / and on the other side it is becleped with the sea. This land hight sometime Albania / and had ye name of Albanactus yt was
king Brutes sone / for Albanactus dwelled first therein / or of ye prouynce
Albania yt is a country of Scicia and nygh to Amazona / therefore Scotts ben
called as it were Scyttes for they came out of Scicia. Afterward that land
hight Pictauia / for ye Pictes reigned therein. M.CCC.lx. year. And at the last
hight Hibernia as Irlo^de hight Gir. in top. For many skylles / one is for
affinite and alte yt was between them and Irysshmen / for they took their wives
of Irlo^de / and yt is openly seen in their believe in clothing / in language
and in speech / in wepen / and in manners. An other skyll is for Irysshmen
dwelled there sometime. Beda li.j. Out of Irlonde yt is ye propre country of
scotts came Irysshmen with their duke yt was called Renda / and with love and
with strength made them chief sees and citees besides ye Pictes in ye north side
Gir. Now the loud is shortly called Scotlonde of Scotts that came out of
Irlonde and reigned therein.CCC. rv. vere unto reed Willyams time yt was
Malcolyns brother. R. Many euyde^ces we have of this Scotlonde ye it is of^e
called and hight Hibernia as Irlonde does. Therefore Beda li.ij. ca.xj. says
that Laure^ce archebysshop of Dunbar was archebisshop of Scotts yt dwelled in
an ylonde that hight Hibernia and is next to Brytayn. Beda li.iij. ca.xxvij.
says pestylence of moreyn bare down Hibernia Also li.iij. ca.ij. says that
the Scotts yt dwelled in ye south side of Hibernia. Also li.iiij. ca.iij. he
says yt Clad was a young lyng and learned ye rule of monks in Hibernia. Also
li.iiij. ca.xxij. Egfridus king of Northu^berlonde destroyed Hibernia. Also
li.iiij. ca.xv. the most dry of Scotts in Hibernia / and in ye same
chapy(...) he called Hibernia proprely named ye west ylonde is an ho^dred mile
from eueryche Brytayn and departs with the sea between and called Hibernia ye
country ye now is called Scotlo^de. there he tells yt Ada(...) abbot of this
ylonde sailed to Hibernia for to teache Irysshmen ye lawful Eester day / and
at ye last came again in to Scotlonde. Ysid. ethi. lib.xiiij. Men of this
Scotlonde ben named Scotts in their own language and Pictes also. for sometime
their bodies were peinted i this manner They would sometime with a sharp edged
^ole prycke and kerue their own bodies and make thereon diverse fygures and
shapes / and peynt them with ynke or with other peyn ture or color / and because
they were so peynted they were called Picti / that is to say peynted.
Erodotus. Scotts ben light of heart / strange and wild enough / but by
medlynge of English men they ben much amended / they ben cruel upon their
enemies / and hate bondage most of any thing / and hold for a foul sloth
if a man dye in his bed / and great worship if he dye in y^ field. They ben
little of meet and may fast long / and ete selde when y^ son is up / and ete
flesh fysshe / milk and fruit more than breed / and though they be fair of
shappe / they ben defouled and made unseemly enough with their own clothinge /
they praise fast y^ vsages of their own forefaders / and despise other men's
doing / their land is fruytfull enough in pasture / gardyns and feldes. Gir.
de p^. ca.xviij. The pry^ces of Scotts as y^ kings of Spain ben not wont to
be anointed ne crowned. In this Scotlo^de is sole^pne and great mind of saint
Andrewe y^ apostle / for saint Andrewe had y^ north parties of y^ world /
Scites and Pictes to his lot for to preche and co^uerte y^ people to Christ's
believe / and at y^ last he was martyred in Achata in Gretia in a cite named
Patras / and his bones were kept.CC. lxi^. year unto Co^stantinus y^ emperors
time / and tha^ they were translated into Constantynople / and kept there.C.x.
year unto Theodosius y^ emperors time / and than Vngus king of Pictes in
Scotlo^de destroyed a great part of Britayn / and was beset with a great host
of Brytons in a field called Mark / and he herd saint Andrewe speak to hy^ in
this manner. Vngus Vngus here y^ me Christ's apostle. I promise y^ help and
socour when thou have ouercomen thyn enemies by my help / thou shall give y^
third dele of thyn heritage in alms to almighty god and in y^ worship of
saint Andrew. And the sign of y^ cross went to fore his host (...) the
third day he had victory / and so turned home again and deled his heritage as
he was boden / and for he was uncertain what cite he should dele for saint
Andrewe he fasted.iij. days / he and his men prayed saint Andrewe that he
would show hy^ what place he should chose. And one of y^ wardeyns y^ kept the
body of saint Andrewe in Constantinople was warned in his sleep y^ he should go
in to a place whyder an angel would led hy^ / and so he came in to Scotlonde
with.vij. fellows to the top of an hill named Ragmont. The same hour light
of heaven beshone and be cleped y^ king of Pictes y^ was coming with his host to
a place called Carceuan. There anon were heled many seek me^. There met with
the king Regulus the monk of Constantynople with the rely kes of saint
Andrewe. There is founded a church in y^ worship of saint Andrew that is heed
of all the chirches in y^ land of Pictes. To this thirche come pylgryms out of
diverse lo^des. There was Regulus first abbot and gadred monks. And so all the
tenth land that the king had assygned him / he departed it in diverse places
among abbeys.

Of y^ description of Irlonde. ca.xxij.
HIbernia that is Irlo^de / and was of old time incorperate in to y^ lordship
of Britayn / so says Gir. in sua pop^. where he descryueth it at full / yet is
it worthy and seems to praise that land with large praysyng / for to come to
clear and full knowledge of y^ land these tytles y^ follow open the way.
Therefore I shall tell of y^ place and stead of y^ land how great and what manner
land it is / whereof y^ land has plente / and whereof it has defaute / also
what men have dwelled therein first / of manners of men of that land / of y^
wonders of that land / and of worthynes of halowes and saints of that land.

Of the bou^dyng of Irlonde. Ca. xxiij
IRlonde is the last of all y^ west ylondes and hight Hibernia of one Hiberus
of Spain y^ was Hermonius brother / for these two brethren gate and wan that
land by conquest. Or it is called Hibernia of y^ river Hiberus y^ is in y^
west end of Spain / and y^ land hight Scotlo^de also / for Scotts dwelled
there some time or they came in to y^ other Scotlo^de that longed to Brytayne /
therefore it is written in y^ Martyloge. Such a day in Scotlonde saint Bryde
was borne / and that was in Irlonde. This lord has in the southeest side
Spain three days saylynge thens a side half / and has in y^ eest side y^
more Brytayn / thens a days saylynge / in the west side y^ endless Occean / and
in the north side Yselonde three days faylyng thens. Solinus. But the sea that
is between Brytayne and Irlonde is all y^ year full of great wawes and uneasy /
that men may selde sail sykerly / between y^ see is.C.xx. mile broad.

Of the gretenes and qualite of that land. Ca.xxiiij.
IRlonde is an ylonde gretest after Brytayn / and stretches north ward from
Brendas hills unto y^ land Colu^bina / and co^teyneth.viij. days journey /
every journey.xl. mile: and from Deuelin to Patrykes hills and to y^ see in y^
side in bread iiij. iourneys / and Irlonde is narower in y^ myddle than in the
ends / all otherwise than Brytayn is / as Irlonde is shorter north ward than
Britayn / so is it longer south ward / the land is not plain / but full of
mountains / of hills / of wodes / of marays / and of mores / the land is
soft rayny / wyndy / and low by y^ see side / and wtin hylly and sondy.
Solmus. There is great plente of noble pasture and of leese therefore y^ beestes
must be often dryue^ out of their pasture lest they ^te over much for they
should shende themself if they might ete at their will. Gir. Men of that land
have comynly their health / and strangers have often a perylous (...) / by cause
of y^ moisture of y^ meet. The flesh of kyen is there holsom / and swynes
flesh unwholesome. Men of y^ land have no fever but only y^ fever ague / and
that right selde. Therefore the holsomnes of y^ land and the clennes out of
venym is worth all the boost and richesse of trees / of herbs / of spycery /
of rich clothes / and of precious stones of the eest lands. The cause of y^
health and holsomnes of y^ land is y^ attemperate hete and cold that is
therein. In^bus rebus sufficit. In this land ben m^o kyen than oxen / more
pasture than corn more grass than seed / there is plente of samon / of
lamprays / of ^eles / and of other see fysshe. Of egles / of cranes / of pecoks
of curlewes / of sparowhawkes of geshawkes / and of gentle fawcons. Of welues
and right shrewed myte / there ben attercoppes / blood soukers / eeftes y^ do
n^ harm / there ben fayres little of body and full hardy and strong / there
ben batnacles fowls like wild gees / which grew wondersly upon trees / as
it were nature wrought against kind. Men of relygyon ete barnacles upon
fasting dares because they be not engendered with flesh wherein as me thy^keth
they err / for ^^ason is against y^ / for if a man had eten of Ada^s leg he
had ete^ flesh / and yet Ada^ was not engendered of fader nor mother / but y^
flesh comes wondersly of y^ tree. In this lord is plente of honey and of
milk of vine and of vyneyerdes. Solinus and ys^d write y^ Irlo^de has no
bees. Nevertheless it were better written y^ Irlo^de had bees and no
vyneyerdes. Be^a says y^ there is great hu^tyng to roobuckes / and it is
known y^ there be none. It is no wonder of Beda / for he never saw y^ land /
but some man told hy^ such tales. Also there grows that stone Saxagonus /
and is called Iris also / as it were the rain bow / if that stone be holden
against y^ son / anon it shall shape a raynbowe. There is also founden a
stone y^ is called Gagathes / and white margery perles.

Of the defaute of the land. Ca.xxv.
^Hete corns ben there full small uneath cleansed with man's hand reserved me^
/ all beestes be^ smaller there than in other lo^des. There lacks well nygh
al manner fresshe water fysshe y^ is not gendred in the sea. There lacks
unkind faucons / gerfaucons / pertryche / fesau^t / nyghtyngales and pyes.
There lacks also Roo and Bucke / and Ilespyles / wontes / and other venymous
beestes. Therefore some men feyne and that favorably y^ saint Patryck cleansed
y^ land of worms and of venymous beestes. But it is more probable and
skylfull y^ this land was from y^ beginning always without such worms / for
venymous beestes and worms dye there anon if men bring them thither out of
other lo^des. Also venym and poison brought thither out of other lands / lose
their malice as soon as it passes the myddle of the sea. Also poudre and earth
of that land cast and sown in other lands drive away worms / so ferforth
that if a turfe of y^ land be put about a worm it sleeth him or makes him
thryll that earth for to escape away. In that land cocks crow but little
tofore day / so that the first crowynge of cocks in that land and the third
in other lands ben like far tofore the day.

Of them that first enhabyted Irlonde. Ca.xxvj.
GIraldus says that Casera Noes nece drad the flode and fled with three men and
fyfty women in to that ylonde / and dwelled therein first the last year tofore
Noes flode. But afterward Bartholanus Seres sone that came of Iaphet Noes sone
came thider with his three sons by hap or by craft.CCC. year after Noes flode
/ and dwelled there and encreaced to y^ nombre of.ix. M. men / and afterward
for stenche of careyns of gyau^tes y^ they had slain / they dyed all save one
Ruanus that lived. M.v.C. year unto saint Patrykes time / and informed y^ holy
man of the foresaid men / and of all the doings and deeds. Than the third
time came thither Nimeth out of Scicia with his. iiij sons / and dwelled
there.CC.xvj. year. And at y^ last of his ofsprynge by diverse my shappes of
war and of moreyne they were clean destroyed and the land left void.CC.
year after. The fourth time v. dukes that were brethren Gandius Genandus /
Saga^dius / Rutheragus and Slauius / of the said Nimethes successors came out
of Greece and occupied that lord and deled it in.v. parties / and every party
co^teyneth.xxij. candredes. A ca^drede is a country y^ conteyneth an.C. towns
/ and they set a stone in the myddle of y^ land as it were in the navel and
beginning of.v. kingdoms. At the last Slauius was made king of all y^ land.
The fyfth time when this nacyon was.xxx. year together they wexed feeble. Four
noble men that were Millesius y^ ky^ges sons came out of Spain with many other
in a navy of.xl. ships / and.ij. of y^ worthyest of these.iiij. brethren y^
hight Hyberus and Hermon deled y^ lord between them two But afterward
covenant was broken between them both and Hyberus was slain Than Hermon was
king of all y^ land. And from his time to y^ first Patrykes time were kings
of y^ nacyon.C.xxxi. And so fro y^ coming of Hibernensis unto y^ first Patryk
were. M. viij.C. year. They had that name Hibernensis and Hibernia of y^
foresaid Hiberus / or else of Hibetus a river of Spain. They were called also
Gatels and Scotts of one Gaytelus y^ was Phenis neuewe. This Gaytelus could
speak many la^guages after the la^guages that were made at Nemproths Toure /
and wedded one Scotta Pharoes daughter. Of these dukes came y^ Hiberne^sis. Men
say y^ this Gaytelus made y^ Irysshe language / and called it Gaytelaf / as it
were a language gadred of all languages and tongues. At the last Belinus king
of Britayn had a sone and hight Gurgu^cius that came out of Denmark / at the
ylondes Orcades he found men that were called Basclensis / and were comen
thither out of Spain / these men prayed and besought to have a place to dwell
in. And y^ king sent them to Irlonde that was tho void and waste and ordained
and sent with them dukes and capytayns of his own. And so it seems y^ It land
should long to Brytayne by right of old time. From y^ first saint Patryk unto
Fedliundius y^ kings time.cccc. year reigned.xxxiij. kings eueryche after
other in Irlonde. In this Fedliundius time Turgesius duke and capytayne of
Norway brought thither men of Norway and occupied y^ land / and made in many
places deep dyches and castles / sengle / double and treble / and many wards
strongly walled / and many of them stand yet all hole / but the Irysshmen
retche not of castles / for they take woods for castles / and marays and mores
for castle dyches. But at y^ last Turgesius dyed by gylefulnes of women. And
Englysshmen say that Gurmu^dus wan Irlonde and made those dyches / and made no
mencyon of Turgesius. And Irysshmen speak of Turge(...)us and know not of
Gurmu^dus. Therefore it is to wit that Gurmu^dus had won Brytayn and dwelled
therein / and sent Turgesius with great strength in to Irlonde for to win y^
land / and because Turgesius was capytayne and leder of y^ v^age and journey
and seen among them / therefore Irysshmen speak much of hy^ as a noble man y^
was seen in y^ land and known. At the last wha^ Gurmu^dus was slain in
France Turges^us loved y^ kings daughter of Irlonde / and her fader behyght
Turgesius y^ he would send he^ hy^ to y^ low latheri^ with.xv. maidens / and
Turgesius promised to mete there with.xv. of ye noblest men yt he had: and held
covenant and thought no gyle / but there came.xv. young berdles men clothed
like women with short swerdes under their clothes / and fell on Turgesius and
slew him right there / and so he was traytoursly slain after he had
reigned.xxx. year. Not long after three brethren / Amelanus / S^tacus and
Iuo^us came in to Irlo^de with their men out of Norway as it had been for love
of peace and of marchau^dyse / and dwelled by ye see side by assent of Irysshmen
yt were always idle as Paul's knights / and the Norways builded three citees /
Deuelin waterford and Lymerych / and increased and after wexed rebel against
men of that land and brought first sparthes in to Irlonde. So fro Turgesius
time unto Roderykes time king of Connatia yt was the last yt was king of all y^
land were.xvii. kings in Irlo^de / and so ye kings yt reigned in Irlonde from
the Hermons time unto the last Roderykes time were in all.C. l(...) kings that
were not crowned neither enoynted / n^ by law of heritage / but by might /
maistry and strength of arms. The second Henry king of England made this
Roderyke subgect the year of king Henryes age.xl. and of his regne xviij. the
year of our lord. xj.C.lxxij.

Of the condycyons and manners of Irlonde. Ca.xxvij.
SOlinus says yt men of this land ben strange of nacyon / houseles and great
fighters / and account right and wrong all one thing / and ben syngle of
clothing / scarce of meet / cruel of heart / angry of speech / and drinks
first blood of deed men that been slain / and than wasshe their visages
therewith / and hold them paid with flesh and fruit instead of meet / and
with milk instead of drink / and use much playenge and ydlenes and hunting
/ and travail but little. In their chyldhode they ben hard nourysshed and
hard fed / and they ben unseemly of manners and of clothing / and have
breche and hosen alone of wolle / and strayte hodes that stretches a cubyte
over the sholders behind / and foldy^ges instead of mantels and of clokes.
Also they use no sadels / boots ne spurs when they ride / but they drive
their horses with a chambred yerde in the over end. Instead of byttes with
trenches and of brydels of reest / they use brydels that let not their horses
to ete their meet / they fight unarmed naked in body / nevertheless with two
darts and speres / and with broad sparthes they fight with one hand. These men
forsake tyllynge of land / and keep pasture for beestes. They use long berdes
and long locks hanging down behind their hedes / they use no craft of
flax / of woll of metal / nor of marchau^dyse / but give them to ydlenes and
to sloth / and reken rest for liking / and for fredome for richesse And
though Scotlonde the daughter of Irlonde use harp / tymbre / and tabour.
Nevertheless Irysshe men be conning in two manner instruments of musyke / in
harp and tymbre yt is armed with wyre and strenges of brass / on which
instruments though they play hastily and swyftly they make right merry armony
and melody with thycke tewnes / werbles and notes / and begin from bemoll / and
play secretly under dyme sown on the great strenges / and turn again unto
the same / so that the gretest party of the craft hydeth the craft as it would
seem as though the craft so hid should be ashamed if it were take. These men
ben of evil manners in their living / they pay no tythynges / they wedde
lawfully / they spare not their alyes / but y^ brother weddeth the broders wife
/ they ben besy to betraye their neighbors / and other they bear sparthes in
their hands instead of staves / and fight against them that trust most to
them / these men ben varyable and unsteadfast / trechours and gylefull / who
that deleth with them needs more to beware of gyle than of craft / of peace
than of bre^nynge brondes / of honey than of gall / of malice than of knyghthode
/ they have such manners yt they be not strong in war and in battle / ne
true in peace / they become gosseps to them yt they will falsely betraye in ye
gosseprede and holy kynrede / eueryche drynketh others blood when it is shed
/ they love somdele their nouryce and their playferes which that souke ye same
milk yt they souked wha^ they were children / and they pursue their brethren
/ their cosyns / and their other kynne / and despise their kynne whiles they
live / and avenge their death when they ben slain. So long has y^ usage of
evil custom endured among them / that it has gotten ye maystry over them /
and turns treason in to kind / so ferforth yt they ben traitors by nature.
And alyens and men of strange lands yt dwell among them following their
manners that uneath there is none but he is besmetted with their treason also.
Among them many men pysse sitting / and women standing. There ben many men
in that land foul shapen in lymmes and in body / for in their lymmes they
lack the benefyce of kind. So that no where(...) better shapen than they that been there well shapen(...) (...) worse shapen tha^ they y^ ben ^^yll shapen. And
skylfully nature hurt and defouled by wit (...) of living brings such foul
gro^es and evil shape of them that with un ^^^full de^ynge with foul manners and
evil living so wyckedly defouleth kind and (...). In this land and in Wales
old wives and women were wont and ben yet as men say often for to shape
themself in lykenes of hares to milk their neighbors kyen and stele their
milk / and often greyhou^des ten after them and pursue them / and wene that
they he hares. And some by craft of nygroma^cy make fat swyne for to be reed
of color / and sell them in markettes and fayres. But as soon as these swyne
pass any water they turn in to their own kind / whether it be straw / hey
/ grass / or turues. But these swyne may not be kept by no craft for to
endute in lykenes of swyne over three days. Among these wo^dets and other take heed that in y^ vttermest end of y^ world falls new meruayles and wonders /
as though ky^de played with large love secretly and far in y^ ends / than
openly ^nygh in the myddel / therefore in this ylonde be many grysely wonders
and meruayles.

Of the meruayles and wonders of Irlonde. Ca.xxviij.
MAny men tell that in y^ north side of Irlonde is y^ land of life. In that
ylonde no man may dye / but when they be old and vexed with great sekenes they
be borne out in to the next land / and there dye. There is another ylonde in
Irlonde y^ no woman therein may ^e^e a child / but yet she may co^ceyue. Also
there is an ylonde in which no deed body may rotte. In Vltonia y^ is Vlster is
an yl^de that a ^uke wonderly departs in twain. In y^ one part is great
distur baunce (...) discomforte of fr^des / and in that other party great
liking and comfort of holy angels. There is also said Patrykes purgatory /
that was showed at his prayer to conferme his prechynge and his ^ore when he
preched to mysbyleued men of sorrow and pain y^ evil men should suffer for
their evil works / and of joy and of bliss that good men shall receive for
their holy deeds. He tells that who y^ suffers y^ pains of purgatory (if it
be enjoined him for penance) he shall never suffer the pains of hell / but he
dye finally without tepentau^ce of sin / as ye ensample is set more full at the
end of this chap^^te. Treuisa. But truly no man may be saved but if he be very
repe^tau^t what someuer penance he do / and every man that is very repentau^t
at his lives end shall be sekerly saved / though he never here of saint
Patrykes purgatory. There is an ylonde in Connacte Sa^^ / y^ is in y^ see of
Conaccina hallowed by say^^ Brandon / y^ has no myce / there deed bodies ben
not buried / but be^ kept out of the earth and rotte not. In Mamoma is a well
/ who y^ wassheth him with the waterof y^ well / he shall were hoore on his
heed. There is an other well in Vltonia who someuer is wasshen therein he shall
never wexe hoore afterward. There is a well in Mou^stre or Mamoma / if any
man touch y^ well / anon shall fall great rain in all that prouynce / and
that rain shall never cesse till a priest y^ is a ^^^ne maiden sing a mass
in a chapel that is fast by and bliss y^ water / and with milk of a (...)
that is of one year besprynge y^ well / and so reconcyle the well in this
strange manner. At Glyndal^an about the oratory of saint Keywyn wytches bear
apples as it were apple trees / and ben more wholesome than sauery. That holy
said brought forth these apples by prayers for to (...) his child y^ was seek
There is a lake in Vlster and much fysshe therein which is.xxx. mile in length
/ and xv. in bread. The river Ban renneth out of that lake in to y^ north
Occean / and men say that this lake began in this manner. There were men in yt
country yt were of evil living (coeuntes cu^ Brutis) And there was a well
in y^ land in great reverence of old time / and always covered / if it were
left uncovered / the well would rise and drown all y^ land. And so it happed
that a woman went to yt well for to fetch water: and hyed her fast to her
child that wept in the cradell / and left y^ well uncovered / than ye well
sprange so fast that it drowned ye woman and her child / and made all the
country a lake and a fysshe ponde. For to preue ye this is sothe it is a great
argument / that when ye weder is clear / fysshers of yt water se in y^ ground
under the water round toures and high shapen as steples and chirches of y^
land. In the north side of Irlonde in the country of Ossyryens every.vij.
year at the prayer of an holy abbot / twain that be^ wedded a man and a woman
must needs be exyled and forshapen in to lykenes of wolves / and abide out.vij.
year. And at y^ end of.vij. year if they live they come home again and take
again their own shape / and than shall other twain go forth in their stead /
and so forshapen for other.vij. year. There is a lake in this land / if a
poole of tree pyght and stycked therein / that part of the shafte or poole yt
is in the earth shall turn in to yren / and that part y^ abides in the water
shall turn in to stone / and that part that abides above shall be tree in
his own kind. Also there is a lake that turns h^sell in to asshe / and
asshe in to hasel / if it be done therein. Also in Irlonde be^ three (...) lepes
/ there as samons lepe a(...)st a roche a long speres length. (...) Leg(...)
is a pond there ben seen Colmans birds / the birds called Certelles / and
come homely to (...) hand / but if men do them wroug^ or harm / they go away
and come not again and the water there shall be bitter and stynke / and he that
did y^ wrong shall not astert without wreche and myschefe / but if he do
amends. (...). As touching saint Patrykes purgatory / ye shall understand
that y^ second saint Patryke that was abbot and not bishop while he preched
in Irlonde / labored and studyen for to turn thylke wicked men y^ lived as
beestes out of their evil life for dread of y^ pains of h^ll / and for to
co^ferme them to good life. And they said they would not turn but some of them
might know some what of the great pains and also of y^ bliss that he spoke
of. Than saint Patryke prayed to almighty god therefore / and our lord Jesus
Christ appeared to saint Patryke / and took him a staff and ladde hy^ in to a
wild place and showed him there a round pyt y^ was derke within and said /
that if a man were very repentau^t and stable in believe and went in to this pyt
and walked therein a day and a night / he should se the sorrows and the pains
of evil men / and the Joy and bliss of good men. Than Christ vanisshed out of
Patrikes sight And saint Patryke arered and builded there a church / and put
therein chanons reguler / and closed the pyt about with a wall / and is now in
the church yerde at the eest end of the church / and fast shette with a
strong door / for no man should nycely go in without leave of the bishop / or
of the pryour of y^ place. Many men went in and came out again in saint
Patrykes time / and told of pains and Joy that they had seen / and the
meruayles that they saw ben there yet written / and because thereof many men
turned and were converted to right believe. Also many men went in and came never
out again. In king Stephens time king of England / a knight y^ hight Owayne
went in to saint Patrykes purgatory and came again / and dwelled ever after
during his life in the needs of the abbey of Ludensis that is of y^ order of
Cysteaux / and told many wonders that he had seen in Patrykes purgatory. That
place is called Patrykes purgatory / and the church is named Reglis. No man is
enjoined for to go in to that purgatory / but cou^seyled that he should not
come therein / but take upon him other penance. And if a man have avoided and
be saable and will needs go therein / he shall first go to the bishop and than
he shall be sent with lettres to the pryoue of y^ place / and they both shall
counsel him to leave. And if he will needs go thereto / he shall be in prayers
and in fasting.xv. days / and after.xv. days he shall be houseled and ladde
to the door of the purgatory with processyon and letany and yet he shall be
cou^seyled to leave it / and if he be steadfast and will en^^e / the door shall
be opened and he blyssed and go in gods name / and hold forth his way / and
the door shall be fast shette till the next day / and when the time is the
pryour shall come and open the door / and if the man be comen he ledeth him in
to y^ church with processyon / and there he shall be xv. days in prayers and
fasting.

Of the meruayles of saints of Irlonde. Ca.xxix.
HEre Giraldus makes mind that as men of this nacyon ben more angry than
other men / and more hasty for to take wreche whiles they ben alive / so
saints and halowes of this land ben more wrechefull than saints of other
lands. Clerks of this land ben chaste and say many prayers / and done great
abstynence a day / and drink al night / so is accounted for a miracle y^
(...)ery (...)th not there as wine regneth / and ben chasen out of abbeys in to
the clergy / and done as monks should. But they y^ ben ^^yll of them ben
worste of all other. So good men among them though they ben but few ben good
at ye best. Prelates of that country ben full ^^owe in cor(...) o^ trespace /
and besy in co^templacyon / and not in prechyng of gods word. Therefore it is
that all y^ saints of that land ben co^fessours and no martyrs among them /
and no wonder / for all the prelates of this land clerks and prelates should
do is to them unknown. Therefore wha^ (...) was put against the bishop of
Cassyll how it might be that so many saints ben in Irlonde and never a martyr
among them all / sythen y^ the men be^ so shrewed and so angry / and the
prelates so recheles and slow in cor^eccyon of trespace. The bishop answered
frowardly enough and said. Our men ben shrewed and angry enough to themself /
but to gods servants they ley never hand / but do them great reverence and
worship / but englyssh men come in to this land that can make martyrs / and
were wont to use that craft (...). The bishop said so because y^ king Henry
the second was tho new comen in to Irlonde fresshely after the marty^ dome of
saint Thomas of Canterbury. Gir. In this land / in wales and in (...) land
ben belles and staves with crooked hedes / and other such things for retykes
in great reverence and worship / so y^ men of this land dread more for to
swear upon one of those belles and golden staves than upon the gospels. The
chief of all such relykes is holden Jesus staff that is a^ Deuelyn / with y^
which staff they say that y^ first saint Patryke drove y^ worms out of
Irlond. Augus. de ci. dei ca.vij. if men a^e how it may be y^ diverse manner of
beestes and of diverse kind that (...) kyndly gotten between male and female
come (...) ben in ylondes after Noes flode. Men suppose that such beestes
^wa^me in to ylondes about^ / and first to the next and ^o forth in to other.
Or else men saylynge in to ylondes brought with them such beestes for love of
hunting. Or angels at god almyghtyes camaunde me^t brought such beestes in
to ylondes about / or the earth brought them forth first / and fulfilled tho
gods commandment / that commanded y^ earth to bring forth grass and
quycke beestes.

Here ends the description of Brytayne / the which conteyneth England Wales
and Scotlond / and also because Irloude is under the ^ule of England / and of
old time it ^ath so continued / there fore I have set the description of y^
same after the said Brytayn / which I have taken out of (...)cronycon. And
because it is necessary unto all Englysshemen to know y^ propertees /
(...)modytees and meruayles of them / I ^illya^ Caxton have set them first in
imprynt according to the translacyon of Treuisa / which at y^ request of the
lord Barkeley translated y^ book of Polyeronycon in to English.
