LONDON, Printed by Adam Islip. 1601.

To the Worshipful my very good and Master Peter Manwood ^auile.
SIr, being wholly unfurnisht of any other means to testify my gratefulness
for your many kindnesses toward me, and thinking it unfit that they so long
should sleep obscured or publicly unacknowledled, I judged it irrequisit by
dedication of these few lines unto you (disabled by Fortune for any other
fashion) to let you know how much I desire to be found thankful to an assured
friend. The matter handled, challenges no great worth, the manner in the
dressing of it less, and yet my endevors to deserve the continuation of your
love, not to be rejected: as Time shall beget a more oportune occasion, my
industry shall not slack to apprehend the same, from which (it may be) may
be produced a better-shaped issue: till when and ever after I rest

Yours in all sincere affection and fidelity, assured, Richard Lynche.

A TREATISE OF the travailes of Noah into Europe, containing the first
inhabitation and peopling thereof.
TO begin with the genealogy of Dardanus (the first founder and erecter of
the city of Troy) it is requisite that we take for our cheifest guide therein
the first prince and Patriarch of the world, called Noe, surnamed Gallus;
following herein most especially, the chronicle of that authenticke writer,
Berosus the Chaldean: who indeed of all others most accords with the writings
and holy works of Moses in the old Testament; for as much as the Chaldeans
generally addicted themselves to letters: unto which they were allured and
persuaded by Noe, showing them the use of History, and therein the true
particulars of the creation of the world, until that very time wherein they
then lived; which also Noe himself learned and was instructed in by his father
Lamech, who likewise received his knowledge from his grandfather the Prophet
Enoch, before he was transported into the heavenly Paradise: and this Enoch
had it by tradition from the first father Adam, who was possessed therewith by
divine instinct and holy inspiration. Let us now therefore attend what this
Berosus the Chaldaean will deliver unto us, being a most renowned, ancient,
and grave author, who flourished not long before the times of Alexander the
Great; and unto whom (as Pliny in his Natural history reports) the
Athenians for his great wisdom and eloquence, erected in their universitie a
most stately and gorgeous statue to his own shape and similitude, whose tongue
they gilded over with most pure and resplendent gold. This Berosus we will in
this Treatise much rely upon, adjoining withal unto his authority other
authors of great worth, learning, and antiquity.

Noe (according to S. Jerome in his interpretations of Hebrew words) signifies
as much as resting or easing of a man's self; and he was the son of Lamech,
which signifies humility. This Noe by the descriptions of old writers was
taken in those days to be a Giant, in respect of his extraordinary stature,
proportion, and corpulencie: and he was about the age (as Moses also in the
sixth chapter of Genesis affirms) of five hundred years, when he begat of his
vile Ty^^ (otherwise called Aretia) these his three first sons, Se^, which
interpreted, signifies famous, otherwise called Melchisedech: cham the second
(though Berosus affirm him to be the youngest) which signifies subtlety or
craft: and Iaphet, which signifies liberty or freedom: with these his three
sons, Noe and his family lived in a city called Enos, which was the first
city in the world, and was built by Cain the son of Adam, at the foot of the
mountain Libanus in the land of Syria, and in the particular province of
Phoenicia, not far from the famous city of Jerusalem, situated in the holy
land.

In this city of Enos, and in many others thereabouts, inhabited and lived
many most deformed, fierce, and terrible giants, who by reason of their
unmatchable strength and indomitable powerfulness, ruled and overswaied all
those people thereabouts at their pleasure, committing many odious and ungodly
deeds, and living a most dissolute and vicious life, engorging their luxurious
appetites with surfets of adultery and libidinous conversation, as void of
shame, the law of nature, and the fear of God.

In these times many very learned Astronomers and wise Soothsaiers gave out
prophetical divinations of the sudden approaching destruction of the
universal world, which their forewarning prognostications they engraved and
cut forth in pillars of marble and stony monuments, to signify thereby unto
the world, their knowledge of such future and sure happening accidents. All
this notwithstanding, these obstinat and heart-hardened Giants persevered in
their impious and detestable practices, tyrannizing and oppressing without all
measure, addicting themselves to the finding out of weapons, shields, and other
warlick accoustrements, as also to the making of tents, pavilions, and such
like expedient necessaries for the field: wholly excluding all thoughts of any
alteration or change to ensue: only the good giant Noe, among all the rest,
feared God, and was obedient to his laws, with all the rest of his family and
household, which was Titea his wife, Sem, Cham, and Iaphet, their children, and
Pandora, Noela, and Noegla, their wives: all which, Noe instructed in modesty
and good manners, and in the reverence and fear of their sovereign Creator. He
therefore, as well by divine commandment, as by the science of Astronomy, by
which he gathered the overthrow and confusion of the world, began to frame and
fashion that huge ship or Ark, which we so often read of in holy scriptures,
and which was appointed from above to be the means of the salvation and
preservation of humane kind. Noe, when he saw this general inundation to
approach and show it self, conveied him and his family into this Arc, when
presently all the world, and all things else therein (this excepted) were
overwhelmed and subverted under the raging fury of this so strange and
all-devouring deluge: and this was performed on the eighteenth day of April,
in the six hundred year of the age of Noe. And hitherto was accounted the
first age of the world, according as Philo the Jew in his computations
affirms.

The world thus universally drowned and kept down under the all-subduing power
of the waters ( Noe and his family excepted) in the end they began again to
sink back and retire into the earth, which when Noe perceaved (his Arc then
resting on the top of the high hill Gordicus in Armenia) by the will and
commandment of God, he with the rest (which were seven) came out of his ship,
and descended down unto the new-dried land: which was performed eight hundred
thirty three years before the foundation of Troy, and before the incarnation
of Christ two thousand three hundred and seventeene years. Noe then seeing
himself thus left the sole King, Monarch, Emperor, Patriarch, Lord, and
Master of the whole universal land, remained wonderously astonished at this so
strange and sense amazing accident: and passing along the land, he found on a
plain a fair pillar of marble, whereon he carefully engraved and set down
the deluge and general inundation of the world in the form of an hystoricall
discourse: and this stone (as it is reported) is called at this day by the
inhabitants thereabouts, Myri-Adam, which interpreted, signifies the issue of
Noe; and it stands in the country of Armenia, being a great province in
Asia the great, which affronteth toward the East the Hyrcanian sea, toward
the South lies Mesopotamia, toward the North Colchos and Albania, and toward
the West, Cappadocia; and through the midst of it run the two famous rivers,
Tigris and Euphrates, of all which countries, hereafter in this history more
at large shall be spoken. It is written, That Noe begat of his wife Tytea after
the flood, thirty children, viZ. Tuyscon the Giant, Prometheus, Iupetus,
Macrus, and the sixteen Titans which were all Giants: also Cranus, Granaus,
Oceanus, and Tipheus; and of daughters, Araxa surnamed the Great, Regina,
Pandora, Crana, and Thetis: some authors do allege more, but for brevities
sake we will not further contend with others opinions. Noe thus living in
Armenia, instructed these his children in the knowledge of sacred Theology,
and in rites belonging to religion and holy sacrifices, as also in the
understanding of human manners and secresies of Nature, of which he himself
had composed many books, which afterward the priests and churchmen of Scythia
and Armenia, preserved and kept a great regard and reverence. For this cause he
was called among the Scythians Ogyges Saga, which interpreted from the Scythian
language, signifies as much as, Great Patriarch, sovereign Priest, and mighty
Sacrificer. And this Berosus affirms, saying: Primum itaque dixerunt Ogygam
Sagam, Berosus.
id est, Illustrem sacrorum Pontificem Noam: he also taught and instructed them
the knowledge of the course of the planets, and divided the year into twelve
months, according to the course and circumference of the Moon: he also by his
study of Astronomy and observance of the celestial motions, could
prognosticat of the alterations of weather in the year succeeding: for which
causes the Scythians and Armenians very highly honored him, thinking him to
partake of the divine nature and supernall knowledge, and therefore called him
Olybama and Arsa, which is as much as to say, the Heaven, and the Sun: and
they afterward also built and named many great cities in his name and of his
wife Titea, so much were they honored for their virtues and godly
conversation. He further taught those people the use of agriculture and tillage
of the ground, and also the finding out of the use of the grape, and the manner
to plant vines and other necessaries for their more easy living, whereupon he
was entearmed also Ianus, which in the Scythian tongue, signifies the giver of
wine. But as he was the first that found out the use thereof, so was he the
first that felt the power and virtue of it, who not being able to endure the
fume and mighty strength of the operation thereof, in a great feast whereto he
had envited many of his friends, fell extremely drunk, and so overcome
therewith, as he lay sencelesly sleeping in unseemely manner amid these his
guests and friends so envited: such was the fury of that newfound drink.

Among all the sons of Noe, Cham was the least in his fathers favor, who also
by reason of his Magic art (wherein he had great knowledge) was called
Zoroast, who wholly gave himself over unto all incivilitie and rude behaviors,
following the abominations and vices of those horrible giants before the
flood: he, as hating his own father, for that he saw himself least beloved of
him, as he saw him thus lying drunk (using some charms of enchantment) took
now the time of revenge, and by his Magic so bewitched his father in those
places of generation, that he disabled him ever after to have the use of
women, or to get more children: for these and other such his detestable
impieties, he incurred the wrath and displeasure of God, in most greevous
manner, and was afterward banished from his father; who afflicted him with no
more punishment therein for such his unnatural deed so committed.

Humane kind through the succession of time, so much increased and multiplied,
that they were now enforced to seek out some new habitations and places of
abode: whereupon the good Patriarch Noe, surnamed Ianus, began to exhort the
princes and chief of his family, to put themselves in search for other
countries and places of residence, and there to build and erect villages and
cities, for the society of humane conversation: and he thus allotted unto
them their regions and quarters, where to populat and inhabit. To Sem, surnamed
Melchisedech, he appointed Asia the great, which in it self contains the
half of the world: and he had with him in his company xxv. Rulers of his
family. He afterward built the city of Salem, now called Jerusalem, and
he lived even until the time of Abraham. Unto Iaphet his brother was allotted
Europe, and he had with him fourteen rulers of his generation: and unto these
two, Noe bequeathd his blessing most amply, according as the scripture makes
mention: As for Cham, although he was out of grace with his father, yet had he
his inheritage also allowed unto him, which was the other third part of the
world, as hereafter shall be farther spoken of.

Friar John Annius of Viterbe, the expositor of our author Berosus, does
recite, that Philo the Jew (another very ancient author) does write, That in
the hundred year after the deluge, Noe to show and instruct his children in
Cosmographie, went upon the mountains which overlooke the Ponticke sea (part
of which is now called Mare Mediterraneum) and there showed unto his son Sem
all the Asiaticke seas, from the flood Tanais in Tartaria unto the river Nilus
in Egypt: unto Cham he showed all the rivers issuing from the seas of Africa,
and from thence through Egypt to the streights of Gybraltar: and to Iaphet all
the rivers and floods of Europe, passing from those streights, through Spain,
France, and Italy, and those countries round about; into which country of
Italy Noe also afterward arrived, and left behind him certain of his people
in that part of the country where Rome was long after built, which was eight
hundred years after the flood: from thence he passed unto the coasts of
Greece, and entered into the straights leading to Constantinople, by the sea
called Mare Major, and so again to the floods of Tanais in Tartaria, from
whence he first set forth. And it is to be noted, That as he passed through
all those countries, he always left people behind him to inhabit and increase
in those countries, destributing unto every number certain quarters to remain
in: and after this time, in short space many countries were again reinhabited
and peopled afresh, which since the flood were desolat, and lay naked and
depopulat.

About the one and twentieth year of this his return from the above written
voyage, Noe began to divide kingdoms, and also to erect monarchies in the
world: of which the first was the monarchy of Babylon, over the which,
Nembroth the Giant, the son of his nephew Cus, who was the son of Cham, was
first of all established, in the hundred and one and thirtieth year after the
inundation; and he was called the first Saturn or king over the Babylonians
and Assyrians, who afterward in a fair Campania called Sennaar, laid the
foundation, and erected the great tower and city of Babell, which he had
caused to be built even to the height of the highest mountains, but after by
the confusion of languages it was given over and left unfinished. Nembroth
after this lived in peace and tranquillity 56 years.

Not many years after the setting up of the monarchy of Babylon, Noe divided
four particular kingdoms in Europe, viz. the kingdom of Italy, Spain,
France, and of Almaigne: for in Italy reigned Comerus Gallus, the eldest
son of Iaphet: in Spain ruled Tuball (called also Iuball) the fifteenth
son of Iaphet: in France Samothes (surnamed Dis) Iaphets fourth son: and
over Almaign, (now called Germany) governed the Giant Tuyscon, one of the
sons of Noe. And so likewise in many other places of the world were several
governements and kingdoms then erected, which now to recite, were tedious and
impertinent to our purpose; and every one of them a long time kept and were
contented with their quarters so allotted unto them, and imposed laws and
edicts unto their people, and they called the country after their own name, as
also many mountains, rivers, and towns were so entearmed, to the end, that
all succeeding posterity might know by what means and by whom such cities
and other monuments received their first ground and foundation.

After these kingdoms and governements erected, and the earth now again well
peopled, Noe now undertaketh his second voyage into Europe, leaving Sabatius
Saga his nephew, and brother to Nembroth king of Babylon, to govern and
command over the country of Armenia, from whence he now departs with
purpose to visit his children, and to know of their estates. And this Sabatius
Saga (called also Saturn) had all the country even unto the land of Bactria,
lying toward India (at this day called Tartaria) under his rule and
authority. These things at home thus established, Noe (surnamed Ianus) with
his wife Titea, and many multitudes of people besides, began his voyage (which
was eight score and nine years after the flood, and in the eight and thirtieth
year of the reign of Nembroth) toward Hyrcania, which he then peopled, and
called them after his own name Ianij. From thence he came to Mesopotamia,
where also he left behind him many people to inhabit: and from thence he
attained the country called Arabia Foelix, where he erected two cities, the
one called Noa, the other Ianinea, furnishing them with inhabitants: after, he
passed from thence, and came into Africa, which part of the world he first
assigned unto the government and soveraignetie of his second son Cham, but
at that time there ruled Triton the son of Saba, which was the son of Cus,
the eldest son of the same Cham. This Triton received Noe and his company
with great joy and gladness of heart, and he stayed there some half a year, in
which time Triton died, and left his son Hammon inheritour to the kingdom of
Africa, otherwise called Lybia. After this, Noe passed forward, and at the
length arrived in Spain, which was two hundred fifty nine years after the
flood, and in the tenth year of the reign of Ninus the third king of Babylon.

Iuball or Tuball, the fifth son of Iaphet, and the first king of Spain (as all
hystories do affirm) received his grandfather Noe Ianus, and his grandmother
Tytea, with honorable entertainment and all gladsome willingness: who also
were exceeding joyful to see the prosperous estate of their nephew Iuball, for
so much as they found, that he governed his people with great justice,
policy, and good laws, as Berosus in a certain place alleges, saying:
Anno Nini quarto Tuyscon gigas Sarmatas, legibus format apud Rhenum: Idipsum
agit Iubal apud Celtiberos (hoc est Hispanos) and Samothes apud Celtas. Noe
therefore to help his nephew for the better peopling of his country, founded
there two great cities, calling the one Noela and the other Noegla, in
remembrance and honor of those his two fair daughters, so called, being the
wives of Iaphet and Cham: and after this, departed for Italy to his nephew or
grand child Comerus Gallus, the first son of Iaphet, whom before he had
appointed to be king of that country. In this voyage, and in his remain in
Spain, were spent nine years. Now it is not written, whether he went this
journey into Italy by land or sea, notwithstanding it is very likely, and
agrees with good probability, that in this his voyage he would not pass by
without visiting the wise prince, his nephew Samothes, the brother of Iuball
king of Spain, who was by his appointment created the first king of France,
as is before touched, and he had reigned about this time six score years,
and lived after this in peace and tranquillity five and thirty years and
upward.

The second time of the coming of Ianus thus into Italy, was in the time of
his age eight hundred and threescore years (and now eight score since his last
departure from thence) where thinking to find Comerus Gallus, he now
understood that he was dead, and that his son Cham, (contrary to the
appointment of Noe) not contented with the sovereign domination of Africa,
had there wrongfully usurped the siegnorie of Italy, and had now commanded
over that country five and twenty years or therabouts: and which was worse,
as all the other kings in Europe had instructed and governed their people in
civilitie, manners, and education, he contrary to such their good examples,
had most abhominably corrupted the youth of Italy with all manner of
impieties, vices, and odious sins, which he with the help of those people
(called Aborigines, which he brought along with him to people the country)
made them to embrace, entertain and live in. Noe upon the knowledge of this,
waxt mavelous heavy and discontent, as sorrowing for the ungodliness of his
own son, and suffered him thus for the space of three years to continue
therein, hoping daily to see some amendment or other in him: but finding him to
persever therein, and rather to increase in it than otherwise, he banished him,
with a certain number of people with him, from out the confines of Italy;
from whence departed, he arrived in the Island of Sicilia, where he with his
company long after lived.

Ianus then taking upon himself the kingdom of Italy, which was now two
hundred threescore and twelve years after the flood, he began like a careful
governor to root out and separate the infectious sheep out of the whole
flock, least with their impurities all should be corrupted, and so he chose
out a certain number of people which were tainted with the vices of their
commander that last ruled (and which people were called Aborigenes) and
commanded them to depart out of the country, over the river Tybre, first called
Ianiculum: which thing they performed and demanded for their queen and
governesse Crana, Noes daughter, which he also granted them: and he appointed
a kingdom and government for them, and they were as is already said, called
Aborigines, and those which were left in Italy, were called Ianigines, after
his own name. He had not long rained here, but he caused to be built on this
side of the river Tybre, toward Tuscania, a mavelous great city on the top
of a high mountain, which he then called Ianiculum, and after that Vaticanum,
and since the town of S. Peter of Rome, and it was seated on the same place,
which at this day S. Peter's church stands upon, as also the Popes palace,
called at this day in Italian, Belvedere, which is as much as, The fair sight.
Round about those countries to the river Arnus, which passes through Florence,
to the bounds of Sardinia, did Noe cause to be inhabited and made populous in
those days: wherein also he built and erected many most beautiful cities,
which he called Aryn Ianas, id est, ex Iano exaltatas: and he began then also
to write and set down laws and institutions for the civil administration of
justice, and government of Commonweales, which he first prescribed in the city
of Vetulonia, called since Viterbe: and instructed the people also in the
sciences of Physic, Astronomy, and Divinity, and in the ceremonious rites
and customs belonging to holy sacrifices; and of these also he made many and
several books.

It has been mentioned before, how that upon Noes last departure out of
Armenia, he constituted and established his nephew Sabatius Saga, surnamed
Saturn, to rule as King and Patriarch over that country; wherein he afterward
reigned peaceably, even until the time of the reign of Jupiter Belus, the
son of Nembroth, the second king of Babylon: who yielding unto his disordinat
desires, and coveting to command as sole Monarch of the whole world, was the
first violater and infringer of the ordinances appointed in those days, and by
whose means the golden age afterward lost such her title, and never since was
called so: for before such his over haughty humors, all things were peaceable,
common, and free. This Jupiter endeavored by all devises possible to overturne
the greatness of Sabatius Saga, surnamed Saturn, and commanded also his son
Ninus to undertake all means how to bring him and his family to death and
destruction: which thing they jointly effectuated so far, as hardly escaped he
the snares and subtilties laid to entrap him. Saturn therefore seeing himself
in those dangers and casualties, to be deprived of all dignity and command,
for succor and refuge fled unto his grandfather Noe, there hoping to be
protected, safe guarded, and defended, which thing also Virgil thus remembers:
Primus ab ethereo venit Saturnus Olimpo, Virgil. Whereupon Poets feign, that
Saturn was banished heaven by Jupiter.
arma Iovis fugiens and regnis exul ademptis. Noe, according to the expectation
of Saturn, friendly entertained him, and gave him many gracious signs of his
welcome and wished arrival: and for to honor him the more, and to show the
effects of his friendship and good will toward him, created him the
Commander, King, and Patriarch of the Aborigenes, whom lately we specified:
and there caused him also to build a city, which he called after his own
name, Saturnia, hard by that of Ianus, called Ianiculum; in which very place at
this day one part of Rome, which lies on the other side of the river Tybre,
stands, and is erected; as Virgil also in his Eneidos mentions, Virgil.
where he brings in Aeneas speaking to Evander, saying: Haec duo preterea
disiectis opida muris, Reliquias veterum vides monumenta virorum, Ianiculum
huic, fuerat, illi Saturnia nomen. Ianus then and Saturn thus reigning
together, Titea the great, Noes wife, began in those times first to set up the
order of Nuns, and ceremonies of Vestall virgins, inventing then the setting up
of lights and lamps in the churches and temples dedicated to the profession of
virginity and chastity, which custom was in those days very reverently
regarded, and endured in great honor and reputation, even unto the time of the
Romans. Saturn likewise very painefully instructed the people in tillage, and
in the nature of soiles, wherein he had great skill and knowledge, as also in
the ceremonies of religion: and not long after (having instituted his son
Sabus to be the successor to the kingdom of the Sabines and Aborigenes) he
died, in the three hundred and forty fourth year after the inundation of the
world. In the very same year also, Noe Ianus finding and perceiving his end to
approach, and that now his lustiness and vigor of spirits began to shrink and
decrease, created one of his sons, called Cranus, the King and Patriarch over
the Ianigenes (which are now called Tuscanes) and the sixth year after departed
this life, and gave up to his maker, his noble and heroicke spirit: which was
after he had reigned in Italy fourscore and two years, and after the flood
three hundred forty six years, before the foundation of Troy four hundred
and fourscore, and before the incarnation of Christ, one thousand nine hundred
threescore and seven years, and in the age of the same Noe, nine hundred and
fifty.

The death of this good King and Patriarch possessed almost all the people in
the world with great sorrow and lamentation, and especially the Armenians and
Italians, who in most honorable manner celebrated his obsequies with such their
then used rites and ceremonies, and afterward dedicated and attributed unto him
divine honors and godlike adoration, building and consecrating temples and
holy aultars unto him, calling him by diverse and several names and titles, as
the Sun, the Heaven, the Seed of the world, the Father of the gods, the Soul of
the world, the God of peace, the giver of justice and holiness, the expulser
of things hurtful: also their children and successors called him Ianus,
Geminus, Quadrisons, Enoirius, Ogyges, Vertumnus, Vadymon, Protheus, Multisors,
Diespiter, and Jupiter: and they invented all manner of honors and strange
worships to reverence and adore him: they also shaped forth his picture into
diverse forms and fashions: sometimes setting him forth with two faces, to
signify thereby his wisdom upon every matter and every occasion: sometimes
also with four faces, to denotate thereby that he was the god of the year for
that he had so divided it into four several parts, being the Spring, Summer,
Autumn, and Winter, Macrobius.
as Macrobius in his Saturnals also remembers, saying: Ianus apud nos in
quatuor parts spectat, ut demonstrateius simulachrum ephaleris advectu^:
Afterward, the Phenicians pourtraied him forth in the form of a Dragon,
biting her tail, to show thereby the roundnesse, and the beginning and ending
of the year. In honor of him also at this day the first month of the year
is called after his own name Ianuarius, Servius.
as Servius in his Aeneidos affirms. The ancients likewise have shaped him
forth with two keys in his hand, to show thereby that he was the invent or of
gates and doors, as also of the locking of them and making them fast, to the
end, that the holy temples and sacred places should not be polluted with the
impious abuse of thieves and uncivile persons, and to avoid adulteries and
other such like sins then reigning; and of his name since have all doors and
gates been called Ianuae. In many other sorts and forms have the ancients
defigured the image of this Noe Ianus, as Propertius and many others have
written, who in the fourth book of his Elegies, thus speaks: Quid mirare
meas tot in uno corpore formas?
Accipe Vertumni signa paterna dei
Tuscus ego Tuscis orior, etc.


And undoubtedly, there has not been read of any that lived so uprightly and
justly as this Patriarch Noe, neither that ever any had such honors,
reverence, and godlike adoration done unto him, both in his life time, and
after his death, who also was among those people in those days called God:
neither is it to be wondered, that in those elder times there were so many
gods held and worshipped among the ancients, for so much as it is to be
understood, That in those days all those princes, rulers, and governors that
had lived virtuously, justly, and godly, and had commanded their people with
mildness, equity, and uprightness, were entearmed gods, and that also
without performing any idolatrous adoration or reverence unto them, as
Metasthenes, an ancient author and hystorian of Persia affirms, where he
thus says: Ante Nynum ducentis and quadraginta novem annis regnatum fuit sub
tribus dijs regibus, quorum qui primus universo imperavit orbi, fuit Ogyges,
qui prefuit inundationi terraru^, etc. Cathon also, another very ancient
writer, thus speaks: Italia complura a dijs and ducibus sortita fuit nomina,
a Iano Ianicula quem quidem Enotrium dictum existimant, quia invenit uvum and
far. And for these and such like reasons, Moses and other godly Patriarchs
were called gods, not that they were so in essence, but only in participation,
as in the seventh chapter of Exodus it is written: Ego te dedi deum Pharaoni:
and in the the three and twenty chapter, Dijs non detrahes, and principem
populi tui ne maledicas. Further also the Prophet David thus says: Principes
populorum congregati sunt, cum deo Abraham, quoniam dij fortes terrae
vehementer elevati sunt.

These things are thus so amply and at large exposed, to the end, that the
reader of this Treatise should not so much marvel or wonder when mention is
made in this book of gods and goddesses, which in those days were so much
observed and reverenced. Ovid.
Ovid rehearsing the words of this Noe Ianus, and showing that in his death the
golden age ceased, thus says: Tunc ego regnabam patiens cum terra deorum
Esset, and humanis numina mixta locis
Nondum iustitiam, facinus mortale fugarat,
Vltima de superis illa reliquit humum,
Proque meta populum, sive vt pudor ille regebat,
Nullus erat justice reddere iura labor
Nil mihi cum bello, posts pacem que tuebar, etc.


And as Noe was among these ancients thus honored and adored, and temples and
altars consecrated unto him: so also was Titea his wife held in great
reverence, worship, and holy esteem, who was called also Vesta, Aretia, Terra,
Regina sacrorum, magna Cybeles, Materque deorum, atque Vestalium Princeps, sive
Abbatissa, as Berosus and other writers affirm. Having thus touched the death
of this good Patriarch Noe, it shall not be now impertinent something to
remember and speak of the wicked and abominable life of his degenerate son
Cham, which although of it self it be worthless of any recapitulation or
recital, yet to descend to the lineall genealogy of the Lybian Hercules the
Great, it cannot be well omitted: from which Hercules, Dardanus the first
founder and erecter of Troy, descended and came.

It has been already specified, how Noe deviding the universal earth unto
his children, and how Cham abounding in all vices and detestable courses,
notwithstanding was not deprived of his portion, but had his right of
inheritance justly allotted unto him, which was the third part of the world,
and particularly Africa to the hither part of Egypt; for which countries he
was commanded by his father to depart, with his wife Noegla, and five and
thirty rulers (which is as much to say, as the cheefes of family of his blood
and house) as also with all their children and issue: which was accordingly
performed, and presently he established himself as king and Saturn of Egypt,
where he erected and built a city called Chem-Myn: and among them also, he
himself was called Pan, and Silvanus, which people likewise (so engendered and
issued of that family) to honor and worship him the more, and to show their
love unto him, lived in all impious and ungracious manner, perpetrating most
odious and soule-damning villainies, affirming publicly, That men ought
lawfully to have the company of their own mothers, sisters, and daughters, in
all lusts and concupiscence of the flesh; and other many most inhumane and
shameful acts, not to be recited. And to show that they gloried and bosted in
the wickedness of such their king and ruler, they entearmed him by the name of
Cham Esenuus, which signifies their infamous god Pan. And thus he ruled in
Egypt long time, even unto the six and fiftith year of the reign of Jupiter
Belus, the second king of Babylon: in the which year he began to travel, and
came into Italy (which was then called Kytim) to his brother Comerus Gallus,
the first king of that country; after whose death, Cham presently usurped and
undertook that mighty government: who in stead of virtuous instructions and
godly laws, in which all other princes round about him, his kinsmen
(commanding Germany, Spain, and France) had instructed and taught their
people, clean contrary infected the youth of Italy with all manner of
impieties, incivilitie, and corruptible vices: persuading them (being of
themselves well addicted) to usurie, robbery, murder, poysonings, and the
study of the Magic art, who by reason of his own great skill therein, was
surnamed Zoroastes, and was the first inventor and practiser of that vild and
diabolical learning, of the use of which he composed and writ many books,
and he was called generally throughout the world, Came Esenuus, id est, Came
infamis, and impudicus, propagator. Some have thought, That the Turk for those
and such like causes, is called in his letters patents, le grand Came de
Tartaria.

It is written, That Cham had one sister which was called Rhea, married to
Hammon king of Lybia, who also was enamoured of one other fair woman, called
Almanthea, and had of her by adulterous means, a son, whose name afterward
was Dionysius; which child was secretly brought up and nourished in a certain
city of Arabia, called Nysa: notwithstanding, the matter was not so closely
and cunningly handled, but his wife Rhea had privy advertisements thereof.
Whereupon in despite and jealous discontent, she forsook her husband, and
went home to her brother Cham (then abiding in the Island of Sicilia) who
presently married and espoused her, and (as some writers hold) his wife Noegla
being alive: but of this other he afterward got many children, as Cus the
father of Nembroth, the first king of Babylon, Typhon the giant, and also many
others.

Cham and his own sister Rhea thus married together, they consulted and advised
to be revenged of king Hammon of Lybia, and to that effect raised a great army
of men, and with the assistance and help of their brothers (the sixteen
giants) they set forwards from Sycilia, and in the end arrived within the
territories and confines of Lybia, where they gave king Hammon battle, and in
the field overthrew and vanquished him, so that he was glad to fly into the
Isle of Crete (now called Candia:) not long after this, Rhea had a son of her
husband Cham, called Osyris, afterward surnamed Jupiter Iustus, who prooved a
most noble and gallant prince, far differing from the wicked humors and
dispositions of his father.

After this, about the three and fortieth year of the reign of Nynus king of
Babylon, Dionysius the son of king Hammon and of the fair Almanthea, now
being come to age and of man's estate, began now to think upon the wrong
offered unto his father by Cham and Rhea, in usurping the command of Lybia,
and determined accordingly to be revenged upon them, which also he afterward
performed, and expulst them again out of the country, investing himself in
the regaltie thereof. Notwithstanding, he used Osyris (the young son of Cham
and Rhea) with great clemency and mercy, and received him as his adopted
child, and in remembrance of his father called him also Hammon and Jupiter: and
brought him up very carefully in the study of letters and other necessary
gifts: over whom he appointed as schoolmaister and tutor, a learned man called
Olympus, of whom afterward Osyris took his name, and was surnamed Olympicus.
After that Cham and his wife and sister Rhea were thus discomfited and
overthrown by Dionysius the new king of Lybia, and now retired with such
disgrace into the furthermost and obscurest corners of Egypt; Rhea was
presently upon this, delivered of a daughter called Juno, which was also called
Isis the Great: and this was in the first year of the reign of Semyramis,
which was three hundred and two years after the flood: and this Isis was
accounted for the fairest, as also the best disposed lady of the world. But
her unfortunat and wicked father Cham, now remaining in Egypt (as has been
already specified) was not contented with such his habitation there, but
seeking further (as over ambitiously inclined) arrived in the country of
Bactria, not far from Persia, where he so wrought and prevailed with his
diabolical skill of Negromancie, that he subjugated and brought under all
those people thereabouts, insomuch as he there reigned in great puissance,
pride, and mightiness: and yet not with this satisfied, gathers great
troops and armies of men, and invadeth the Assyrians, against whom marches
their king called Nynus the young, the son of the before mentioned Semyramis,
whose fortune was such, as he victoriously triumphed over his enemy Cham,
suppressing his glory, rule, and haughtiness, he himself being in that
battle slain, and all the army shamefully discomfited.

Many writers have affirmed, That this Cham was a man of singular ingenuitie
and sharp capacity, and that he first found out the seven liberal Sciences,
and had wrote many books of great worth, among which, his cheifest were of
Negromancie, of which, most part of them were burned by the beforesaid Nynus.
Some also say, That he only in the world came out of his mothers womb
laughing and with a smiling countenance, which is an uncouth thing, and (as
most hold) prognosticating no good. Unto this Cham, Tiphon the Giant (his
eldest son by Noegla) was heir, and also succeeded him in humors and
malicious dispositions, who was brought up in Egypt, and there continued. And
now also it shall be fit to revert our history unto the two youngest children
of Cham Zoroastes, which excelled in all good parts and virtuous inclination as
their father abounded in the contrary, and that was that Osyris before spoken
of (the adopted son of Dionysius, king of Lybia) and Isis his sister, the
fairest and best accomplished damsel in the world, whom afterward he took to
wife and married, with whom he had also the kingdom and principality of
Egypt. These two now newly espoused, he being of threescore years of age, and
she about fifty (and yet our author Berosus terms them very youthful) began
to apply themselves to the study of the nature of herbs, and to the finding
out of planting, tilling, and sowing of corn, which afterward they instructed
their people in, and showed the use to their neighbors dwelling in Palestina,
of which ruled king and governor Sem, surnamed Melchisedech, who was the first
that ever offered bread and wine unto God. From thence Osyris passed into
Egypt, and there also very painefully showed them the manner of tilling and
agriculture, as likewise the Poet Tibullus speaks of, Tibullus.
saying: Primus aratra manu solerti fecit Osyris,
Et tenerum ferro sollicitavit humum.


Afterward he traveled into many other countries, always learning them (then
living by acornes, nuts, and water) in the knowledge of such his new invention;
and by these gentle and mild courses he gained the love of all people, and by
that means almost possessed himself of all the world, with the regalities and
principalities thereof (the Empire of Babylon only excepted) whose conquests,
victories, prevailements, and powers, we will something more amply hereafter
remember, following as well our own author Berosus, as also Diodorus Siculus,
the learned Catasthenes, and many other authenticke authors herein in their
books and writings of matters of elder times, and subjects of antiquity Osyris
therefore (surnamed Jupiter Iustus) having by his wife and sister Isis
(otherwise called Juno) and also of many other ladies, which here shall be
needless to recite) many children, as Hercules the great, Anubis, Macedon,
Lidus, Meon, Neptune, Oros, and also many others, he assembleth a mighty
army of all sorts of people, both puissant and subtle, and leaving the
government of the kingdom of Egypt to the queen Isis, carrying along with
him some of his aforesaid children, he takes a long and wearisome journey. The
chief place of command in all his army, he appointed unto his eldest son
Hercules of Lybia, who upon his escutchion and arms, bare depainted the shape
of a crowned Lion rampant, holding in his forefeet a mighty hatchet. His two
other brothers, Anubis and Macedon, carried defigured on their shields, the one
a Dog, the other a Wolf; according to the signification of their names. The
arms of the Emperor Osyris was a royal scepter, and under that, the form of
an eye: as who searches the monuments of antiquity, may there find it out: by
which is perceived how ancient an usage the giving of arms is, and how to be
respected. And in those times all good and just princes were called gods, as
Pan, Apollo, Jupiter, and infinite others, with their goddesses, muses, and
nymphs.

This mighty, powerful, and gallant army thus gathered together, the
Emperor Osyris proceeds in his intended voyage, and therein compasses round
the whole universal earth: his first resistance was upon his entering into
Africa, where was opposed against him the Giant Antheus, but him he presently
overthrew. After that, he quietly passed into India and Aethyopia, where he
did great good in instructing the poor ignorant people in the true knowledge
of necessary nutriment and victuals, telling them the manner how to govern
and command with policy, justice, and equity. Here also he subdued many most
ougly and fierce Giants, full of cruelty and blood, who generally with their
greatness had tyrannized over all those countries of Asia. He slew the tyrant
Busiris of Phoenicia, which used to sacrifice men and women unto the gods.
After this, he arrived in Phrygia, and there also subjugated the Giant Typhon,
in whose command and place he established one of his own sons, ruling
there, being the place where Troy afterward was erected. From thence he came
by long passages, into this part of the world, being Europe, through the
streights of the sea called Hellespont, since called the arm of S. George
deviding Grecia from Turkey.

At this time ruled in Thracia (which is that part of Greece where
Constantinople is erected) a most horrible tyrant and inhumane Giant called
Lycurgus, who now denied passage through his country unto Osyris, and at the
first fiercely resisted his approches, but in the end, in gallant fight, he
slew him with his own hands, and remained victor and sole commander of that
country: which afterward he resigned to one of his own followers called
Maron, being a young and valiant prince. From thence he passed into another
province called Emathia, in which also ruled many bloody and cruel Giants,
all which he clean extirpated, destroyed, and subdued, settling the country
in peaceable quietness and security, over which he appointed to be commander,
one of his own sons before spoken of, called Macedon, who afterward called
that country after his own name, Macedonia, and the people Macedonians, of
whom descended and issued the everfamous conqueror, Alexander the great. Out
of this country, the Emperor Osyris presently departed, and came into the
Isle of Crete (now called Candia) where he vanquished the Giant Milinus, a
tyrannical and sour governor, yet he appointed his son (in whom good
hopes appeared of good government) to be king of the said Island. From these
parts he returned again into Grecia, and so to Scythia, now called Tartaria,
where he found his eldest son, the great Hercules of Lybia, in prosperous
estate: who at this instant was extremely enamoured of a lady called Araxa,
by whom afterward he begat a son called Tuscus, which long after was king of
Italy, and of whom descended king Dardanus, the first founder and builder of
Troy. From Tartaria, the mighty Emperor Osyris (surnamed Jupiter Iustus) and
his son Hercules are now departed, and in short space arived in Hungary, and
so came into Almaign or Germany, even unto the flood of Duno, not far from
the famous river of Rhyne, where (finding the country something populous) he
made some stay and residence, painefully instructing them in the sowing of
corn and planting of vines: and builded also in this place diverse villages
and cities, of whom, he being also surnamed Apis) the mighty house of the
Counts of Hasbourgh in Germany took her name; from which has issued the
noble and illustrious house of Austria, since in great power and greatness
exceedingly flourishing. He also there gave the names unto the cheifest hills
and mountains thereabouts, whereof at this day some are called Appenini. And
from thence he passed into Italy, which presently shall be further shown,
and as that very ancient author affirms, Cathon.
whom we call Cathon the ancient, saying: Aurea et as usque ad Apina deorum
Italiae ultimum, etc.

In these times there reigned in Germany a prince, called Gambrivius, the vij.
king of the Germans, descended from the house of Tuyscon the Giant, the first
king of that country, and the son of Noe. With this prince the emperor
Osyris made long residence, and was roially feasted and entertained, as being
indeed near in kindred and consanguinitie, who accordingly received him and his
train with great joy and gladness. The country of Italy about this time was
extremely oppressed with the tyranny and bloody fashions of infinite numbers of
Giants that therabouts then lived, called Titans, insomuch, as the people of
the country, not able longer to tolerate and endure those such slavish
impositions and unsufferable tyrannies, (hearing of the fame and late arrival
of the Emperor Osyris into Germany) sent their messengers or ambassadors
unto him, most humbly craving and desiring his favorable assistance and
protection against those barbarous and uncivile oppressors, and that he would
make a journey thither to deliver them from the miserable servitude and bondage
that they then were forced to abide and live in. The Emperor Osyris or Jupiter
hearing and accepting of their distressed condition and case, willingly
condescended to leave Germany, and to undertake a voyage thither, to redress
and suppress their wrongs, and the Giants super-arrogant pride, glory, and
haughtiness: which, although they were of kindred and alliance unto him, yet in
respect of their uncivile and tyrannical usances, he instantly proceeded to
the redressement thereof: and in three several battles utterly overthrew,
vanquished, and discomfited them, and thereupon took upon him the government
of the principality of Italy, which (long before) his father Cham and his
grandfather Noe were also possessed of: and he commanded and ruled over the
Italians for the space of eleven years, where for the most part he remained
in the city of Viterbe, called also Vetulonia, and at the end of eleven
years, in great triumph, joy, and glory, instituted his nephew Lestrigon the
Giant (the son of his son Neptune) king, commander, and ruler over all the
country of Italy.

But for so much as in this book mention is made oftentimes of strange and
horrible Giants, and other rare and admirable things, the reader may perhaps
remain incredulous, and scarce believe them to be true, accounting them wholly
fabulous, and by invention fashioned, yet to allege some authority for the
confirmation thereof (leaving out infinite other examples of infallible
certainetie) you only shall be referred to the holy scriptures, and also unto
Josephus the Jewish writer, who amply has handled the apology thereof: among
the rest, Nembroth, Golias, and others, are apparent, that they were Giants,
and of unusual stature, strength, and proportion of body. If the authority
of Boccace may be accepted, he thus writes of himself: In my time (says he)
there was found under the foot and hollow caverne of a mountain, not far from
the city of Deprana, in the Isle of Sicilia, the body of a mavelous, huge,
and strange proportioned Giant, which seemed to hold in one of his hands a
mighty long piece of wood like unto the body of a young tree, or the mast of
a ship, which so soon as it was touched, fell all into ashes and dust, but it
was all garnisht and wrought about with lead, which remained sound and firm,
and it was found to weigh five hundred pound weight: his body also being
touched, consumed, and became all powder and ashes, except certain of his
bones, and three of his teeth, which were also peized, and every tooth weighed
forty ounces. For the height and full stature of his body; it was conjectured
by the people of that country, to be two hundred cubits long. And the same
author says, That his teeth were afterward hanged up in our ladies church of
Deprana, for a strange monument, and a thing of wonderful admiration. In many
other places are the bones of giants that lived in those days, kept and
preserved for woonders and relics of memory, but yet not of so uncouth and
almost incredible hugeness: but leaving these matters to be further ruminated
by the scrupulous, I will return to our maine intendment proceeding, till I
have further explaned the obscurity thereof.

These things above spoken of, being achieved by Osyris against those Giants
and molesters of civil conversation, he departed out of Italy with all his
royal army, singularly well prepared and in gallant equipage, accompanied
with gods, heroes, demie gods, and martialists, that is, with all valiant,
courageous, and wise princes, rulers, and captains: and it is not written,
whether in this his journey he passed through Gaul (now called France) or
went that way by sea, but hard by the continent he coasted, in which then
ruled one Lucus, king of that famous country: but howsoever he journeied, he
now is strived in Spain, where once again he renewed mortal battles against
the Tytans, which were mighty Giants, and cousins to those he before
discomfited in Italy, these also he now subdueth and quite raseth out all
their generation, leaving the government of that country to the command of
Gerion. And from thence he again sailed into Greece, and arived in the
province of Peloponnesus, now called Morea: and he there settled himself, and
ruled in the city of Arges for the space of five and thirty years, as it is
written by Eusebius in his book of Time. After this he creates his son
Egialus, king of Achaia, Eusebius.
and so returns again into Egypt, there to spend his latter days with his
wife and sister Isis, surnamed Juno; who took such his coming home in full
joyous acceptance and gladsome pleasingnesse. By this time all the world had
been filled with the report of Osyris great fame and worthiness, unto whom
were ascribed and given many titles and names of triumph, as Jupiter Iustus,
Dux, Rex, Consultor, Cuius regnum perpetuum est, and habitatio in Olympo: all
which were clean contrary to those wherewith his father Cham was entitled.

Being thus returned into his country of Egypt, he caused in many and
several parts and corners thereof, to be erected certain columns and high
pillars, in which he commanded to be cut out and engraved for the
preservation and memory of his name and glory, these following lines, Diodorus
Siculus.
as Diodorus Siculus repeateth them: Mihi pater Saturnus deorum olim junior,
sum vero Osyris rex, qui vniversum peragravi orbem, usque ad Indorum desertos
fines, ad eos quoque sum profectus, qui arcto subjacent, and Istri fontes, and
usque Oceanum, sum Saturni filius antiquior, germen ex pulchro and generoso
ortum, cui genus non semen fuit, nec fuit in orb locus quem non adinerim,
docens ea quorum inventor fui.

After he thus was quietly seated in his kingdom of Egypt, his brother
Typhon the Egyptian (who in all villainy and malice followed the humors of
his father Cham) began now to repine and envy at the glory and fortune of the
Emperor Osyris, in so much as he fell into a present conspiracy with many
other mallicious Giants for the death and destruction of him and of his
greatness: which he most traitorously prosecuted so far, as in the end, by
subtle and crafty practices he entrapped him, who was by him and the rest of
the Giants cruelly murdered and torn in pieces, whose body they divided, and
had hewne out into six and twenty pieces, whereof every Giant had a share and
part, as a reward and satisfaction for such their bloody and victorious
stratageme: but afterward these parts of his body were found out and gathered
together again by the means of his wife Isis, and buried, with their right
honor and due solemnity, whom after his death the Egyptians held and
worshipped as a god, as also the children of Israel did the like in the desert.
Boccace says, That he was called also Serapis, and that the ancient Poets
termed him likewise Dionysius, Liber Pater, and Bacchus, and that he was the
first that ever triumphed, which was in the first voyage he made into the
Indies; and that the invention of garlands and crowns was by him devised.

Our author Berosus by his collections seems to allege, That this Emperor
Osyris was thus slain in the prime and flower of his age, having attained
only unto three hundred years, for he was borne about the time of Ninus the
third king of Babylon, and died in the reign of Baleus, the Babylonians
eleventh king, by which it is very apparent, what wonderful long time men in
those ages did live. His wife Isis survived him two hundred and fourscore
years, as hereafter shall be mentioned, who after that she had with all fit
ceremonies and rites performed the funerals of her murdered husband, began now
to think upon the actors thereof, and to meditate upon revenge and direful
practices: whereupon she convocateth all her children and nephews, and
inciteth them to the embracement of this her attempt and action, against the
horrible murderers of her newly enterred husband. To be short, they condescend
to her motion, and in the field encounter with Typhon and his associates, and
in battle utterly subdue them: which victory was achieved hard by the river
Oris in Arabia, and in the same place where Osyris himself slew the mighty
Giant and tyrant Antheus. The world being thus delivered of the perverse
generation of Cham, Isis remained a peaceful and secure governesse and queen
over Egypt, which she compassed as well by her own policies and devises, as
by the valor and hardy prowess of her children, of which the cheifest and
most valiant was called Hercules of Lybia, of whom now (withdrawing my pen for
a while to speak further of Isis) I will more amply entreat.

Hercules therefore, the most valourous and courageous young prince, after he
had by this means revenged the death of his father Osyris upon his uncle
Typhon, and the rest of his associates, began now to have a feeling of this
own power and vigor, and undertaketh many most tedious voyages, to scour all
places of the world from the tyranny and oppression of such inhumane and
impious tyrants: and first he passed through the province of Phoenicia, where
he slew the tyrant Busyris, the son of him, whom Osyris before had slain.
From thence he went into Phrygia, where Troy afterward was built, and there
overcame the young tyrant Tipheus; and he gave the government of that country
to his own son Athus, which he begat of a lady called Omphale, as hereafter
shall be declared. Likewise he vanquished the Giant Mylinus, the younger king
of the Island of Candia: and from thence he came into Africa, since called
Barbaria, of which, he named most part of it Lybia after his own name, which
before was called Phutea: and there in memory of his conquests he erected a
column and stately pinnacle. From hence passing through the streights of
Gibraltar, he arrived in Spain, where upon his first landing, he fought
body to body against the three Gerions, which were brothers and joint
commanders and kings of Spain, those also he overcame and slew, and created
his son Hispalus king and ruler of that country: which was now the ninth
king thereof, and of whom the city Hispalis, now called Sivile in Spain,
took her name and was so called. After this, Hercules determined to make a
journey into Italy, there also to purchase further fame and reputation, by
suppressing the tyranny of those that there then lived according to their own
will, power, and mightiness. In this his jorney toward Italy by land, he
passes through the kingdom called Regnum Celticum, then called also Gaul,
and at this day is known and nominated by the name of France: of the
antiquity of which country (before we come to speak of his arrival in
Italy) having so fit occasion, we will in this place something remember.

First therefore we must find out and know in what time and in what age this
famous Hercules of Lybia passed through the country in this his journey, for
so much as it is not written of any certainetie, or by any authenticke author,
That he ever journeied through this kingdom before, although some do hold,
That he went that way into Spain with his father Jupiter (surnamed Iustus) in
the reign of Lucus, the eight king of Gaul, as has been before somewhat
commemorated: and this matter may be easily and evidently discovered, by
comparing the times wherein Hispalus was established and made king of Spain
with those succeeding, of which, Johannes Annius.
Johannes Annius of Viterbe, a most excellent writer and diligent
Hystoriographer in his Chronicles of Spain, says, That the same Hispalus was
crowned and invested in the kingdom of Spain by his father Hercules, in the
six and thirtieth year of Baleus (the second of that name) the eleventh king
of Babylonia; which was after the flood five hundred fourscore and ten years,
before the foundation of Troy two hundred threescore and one, and before the
incarnation of Christ a thousand seven hundred and seven and twenty: for
Hercules was born presently after the death of Ninus, the third king of
Babylon, from whose death unto the six and thirtieth year of Baleus, the
eleventh king, were just two hundred fourscore and ten years: so that by this
means it may clearly be perceived, in what time and in what age this Lybian
Hercules so arrived in Gaul, being presently after the coronation of his son
Hispalus in Spain. At this very time therefore of his coming into Gaul
(which we will now hereafter call France) reigned and governed in that
country as their king and commander, one called by the name of Jupiter Celtes,
the son of king Lucus, whom before we a little touched, who exceeded all
others in riches in those days, and was mavelous wealthy in sheep, in
cattle, and in pasturage, which were all the goods and possessions that
princes in those times abounded in, in that country; for then silver or gold
was not there known, jewels and rare stones were disesteemed, no tributes were
paid, no taxes or impositions laid upon the subjects, all things without
deceit, art, or any villainous invention of man's brain, were peaceably enjoyed.
And to confirm this their ignorance of silver and such metals Diodorus
Siculus thus says, That the sheepheards of this king Jupiter Celtes, attending
their flocks on the top of those mountains which devide the kingdom of
France from that of Spain, called Pyrenci, espied on the sudden on the one
side of the furthermost hills, certain liquid moisture to run down in hasty
streams into the valleys below; and at the higher part of that mountain,
certain flames of fire in most furious manner to show themselves, in so much,
that very hard rocks and stony substances on that mountain were dissolved
and were melted with the extremity of the heat and riscaldation of those
fires: which also ceased not, but continued in that strange manner many months
together. The silly and simple understanding of these sheepeheards, by no
means assumed any apprehension of this so strange working of nature, but
entertained it as a matter exceeding their capacity and reach of judgment,
and therefore passed it over with the lesser wonder, in that they acknowledged
in themselves so deep an imperfection and want of knowledge. But it so
fortuned, That certain merchants of Phoenicia traveling along those coasts,
and perceiving that that metal must needs be good which so distilled and
tumbled down from the tops of those mountains (being, as many old writers
allege, the metal of silver) began to feel the dispositions of those all
ignorant sheepeheards, and to come to some composition and friendly terms for
exchange of some wares they had, with that metal, which those hills in that
plenty so affourded and yielded forth. The poor sheepeheards (as I told you
before) not capable of the true value thereof, for matters of very little worth
(which those merchants then had) exchaunged the one for the other, without any
suspect of disadvantage or ill bargain on their sides: and thereupon the
Phoenicians laded and fraughted their ships (then abiding in a port or haven
not far of) with that metal which those silver mines so produced, and
afterward enriched their country therewith in most abundant and plentiful
manner: and by the reason of these fires, those hills were afterward entearmed
and called Montes Pyrenaei, for Pyr in Greek signifies Feu in French, and fire
in English. But to return from whence we digressed. This royal king, Jupiter
Celtes which before we remembered, had one only daughter, which he prized
and endeared as his cheifest good; who exceeded all other ladies in the world,
in proportion and stature, and in the graces of natural beauty, and for that
she was of so extraordinary and large tallness, she was in those days held
among those people a Gyantesse. This lady, whether proud of her own goodly
features, or chaste in her cogitations, could not by any means be brought to
affect any man whatsoever living, neither would her father consent to any match
or marriage, that might be occasion to take her from his sight, and the fruition
of her so desired presence, until the coming of this so far-famoused and
renowned Hercules of Lybia (of whose great worthiness and strange
performances, they had largely heard) they of themselves entertained a new
thought, and were easily induced, upon the first sight of his personage (which
was majesticke and of wondrous grace) to unite their house with one of so noble
demerit and of so general fame. Hercules likewise became so far ensnared with
the gallant beauty, big proportion, and equisit perfections of Galathea (for
so was the lady called) that he instantly discovered the motions of his
affections and love toward her, which were reciprocally embraced and kindly
entertained: so that there rested only the consummation of the nuptials, which
were presently after performed with all manner of solemnization and rites of
ceremonies observed in those days. Not long after the marriage of the Giantesse
Galathea unto Hercules, her father Jupiter Celtes died, who for his virtuous
life and good government, was held in that reputation, esteem, and reverence
among those people, that ever since that day, the third part of all that
country of France is called after his own name Celtica. After him succeeded
his son in law Hercules, and took upon him the command and government of
the country of France, living peaceably and prosperously with his wife
Galathea many years, and taught also the people new courses how to live, and
better customs and fashions of behavior, controlling them for their rude and
uncivile manners, and wholly depressing a most inhumane and impious order they
had, of sacrificing poor strangers unto their gods, this he abolished and
wholly extinguished, enjoining straight laws, and punishments for the
violaters and infringers of such his commandment herein. Not long after, he
built and erected a most gallant and mighty city, which he caused to be
seated on a high mountain of that country, which now is called by the name of
the Duchy of Burgundy, between Authun and Langres, which city he called
Alexia, which interpreted, signifies conjunctive or uniting, to show that there
were two noble houses of strange countries conjoined and made one. This city
afterward flourished in great glory and puissance, and especially in the
times of Julius Caesar, before which, he himself with a most strong army
lay, begirting the same with a most strict and hard siege: at which time, the
giving of the flowers de Luces in France took his original, as Julius Caesar
himself in his seventh book of his Commentaries affirms. But at this
present, that once gallant and glorious city of Alexia is but a mean village,
and of small account in the country of Lauxois not far from Flauigny.

The great city of Alexia thus in those days peopled, inhabited, and
fortified by the great Hercules, the king of Gaul: after some orders and
institutions appointed for the good governance and managing of all things
whatsoever at home, he proceeds in his intended voyage for Italy, and for
that expedition raised a mighty and powerful army; with which, after he had
taken his leave of his wife Galathea, and of his young son Galatheus, (now
aged about four years or thereabouts) he progresseth to the effectuating of
his first entendment, and presently enters into the territories of the
Allobroges (which country is now called Savoy) and there with main force of
many hands and laborious soldiers, he makes his passage through those
wondrous high rockie mountains, in all ordinary sense and opinion then
inaccessible and not to be passed; but as the extreme industry and
painfulnesse of work brings all difficult things in the end to obedience and
command of art, so these undisgested heaps of stubborn stones and rocks,
were forced at the last to give way unto his army, so far, that all their
horses and baggage whatsoever found a very plain and easy passage. From
thence he descended and came into Italy, where he fully revenged himself of
those inhumane and lawless Giants, which were the death of his own father
Jupiter Iustus: and after all tumults quieted, and the resistants subdued, he
fell to prescribe laws to the people, and to instruct them very carefully in
matters of civil association and orderly living: where we will for a while
leave him, and once again betake our selves more particularly to entreat of
the first original and inhabitation of France: to begin with which, it must of
necessity be drawn by the lineall succession and descent of father to son,
even unto that Jupiter Celtes, and this Hercules of Lybia we so lately
remembered.

It has been in the beginning of this book related, how in the hundred year
after the universal inundation and deluge of al things whatsoever which were
contained in the wide embracement of the world, the good father and Patriarch
Noe made his first voyage, and put forth from Armenia with all those his
children, nephews, and kinsfolks, to discover unto them the situation of many
other countries then unknown: and that he first passed over the Ponticke sea,
and so to the arm of the sea Mediterraneum, coasting along the continent about
all those quarters; of purpose to show unto his children the devision of the
world, and Cosmographically to instruct them in the situation of each several
country, as they stood and were inhabited before the flood: and after that, to
proportionize unto his three first begotten sons, every one his share and
allowance for his rule, command, and domination, as has been before already
spoken of. And in these his travels, he brought also along with him many sorts
of beasts, cattle, herbs, and other such things that were availeable for the
increase and maintenance of humane life; and with every one of his children or
kinsfolk left a certain allowance of such things, there to multiply and
engender. In this his first perigrination, he came into Gaul, and so into
Italy, where after he had spent some time, he returned back into Armenia,
about the tenth year he had set forth from thence: by which it may be
gathered, that Gaul was first inhabited and peopled in the hundred and eight
year after the general flood.

After this his return into Armenia, having there rested himself some one and
twenty years, he began to invent the foundations of great cities, and to
establish kingdoms and siegnories throughout the world: so that in the hundred
and two and thirtieth year after the deluge he first erected and appointed the
monarchy of the Babylonians, of which, the first king was called Nembroth,
Noes cousin: and about the thirteenth year of the reign of this Nembroth, he
instituted and established for the king of the Gauls one other of his kinsmen
called Samothes, surnamed Dis, the fourth son of Iaphet, a man very wise and
well governed. Samothes therefore accordingly took his leave of the Patriarch
Noe, his grandmother Titea, of his father Iaphet, and of his mother Noegla and
the rest of his kindred, and set forward toward his kingdom and government
with all expedition possible: carrying along with him diverse sorts of cattle,
poultrey, and other things necessary for the maintaining and conservation of
mankind (which kind of things were all the riches and treasures that men
desired to possess in those days:) and thus with all his train, family, and
followers, he takes shipping in the sea called Marc major, and in the end, by
the favorable assistance of prosperous winds, he arrived within the confines of
Gaul, which was some seven and thirty years after his first being there with
his grandfather Noe, and about eightscore and four years after the deluge: by
which it may be understood, That this Samothes the fourth son of Iaphet, was
little less than seven score years of age, when he now last visited the
country.

Samothes therefore now entered into his own kingdom with his wife, children,
and followers, and also his horses, kine, and other things necessary, began to
settle himself therein, and to give out edicts and brief commands what he
would have done and performed in this his country: which was done in the year
after the flood above written, and about two thousand fourscore and thirteen
years before the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. The country was very
much peopled by this time, and great increases of all other things there were
found upon his now coming (for it was now seven and thirty years past since
Noe left people there first to inhabit and multiply, which in such a time grew
to great abundance of all things whatsoever.) His welcome and entertainment
was wondrous gladly accepted of those people and men of the country, who
acknowledged him as their Lord, their Patriarch, their chief, and their
Saturn; which names in those days were given as titles only of honor,
excellence, and dignity, as Zenophon in his Aequivocals also says: Saturni
dicuntur familiarium nobilium regum, qui urbes condiderunt Primogeniti eorum,
vocantur Jove's, and Iunones: vero Nepotes eorum Hercules fortissimi and cetera.

It may now very well be imagined, that those people having so long time lived
without a governor, king, or particular commander, must of necessity be
very rude, uncivile, obstinat, and barbarous, living only according to the
laws of Nature, and following their own wills, desires, and concupiscence. Yet
notwithstanding, Samothes by fair and gentle demeanures and mild cariages, so
won their hearts unto him, that they became easily reclaimed, and brought to
be docible and obedient to what precepts or commands were imposed upon them:
and upon this he devised laws and ordinances for domesticke conversation,
which he caused to be made plain unto the people, who at the first something
wondered at so strange alterations, having so many years together lived
without any chief, or any laws to curb or bridle their natural fantasies
and disordinat affections. And these laws were made in the fourth year of the
reign of Ninus, the third king of Babylon, at what time also Tuyscon the
Giant, his uncle, king of Almaigne, and Tuball king of Spain, did the like,
instructing their people very industriously in the rules of Philosophy,
Physic, and Astronomy, which they themselves had learned of their
grandfather Noe and their father Iaphet. And if it be here demanded, what
kind of writings they then used, Berosas does answer, that they were certain
Phoenician characters and letters (which also were used in Armenia) which were
very like unto those which Cadmus long time after brought from Phoenicia into
Greece, and therefore Julius Caesar in his sixth book of Commentaries says,
That the Gauls did use in those times Greek letters for their manner of
writing: but undoubtedly, those characters were found long time before they
were ever known in Greece, as Zenophon and many other authors confidently do
affirm.

Samothes, surnamed Dis, living thus in all tranquillity and peaceable
security among his people, ceased not daily to possess their hearts with
strong opinions of the worth and value of learning, for it is written, that he
was the wisest and most learned prince in the world in those times, as Berosus
also allows, when he thus says: Samothes, qui and Dis vocatur, Celtas
colonias fundavit, nec erat quis etate illa isto sapientior, ac propterea
Samothes dictus est.

Among other his rules of Philosophy and learning, one was (being the
cheifest) he taught the people, That the souls of men were immortal; which
before they hardly believed, as men dwelling in the shade of ignorance, and
invelloped with dark mists of error. After he had thus established laws and
ordinances for the good government of his country, and all his people enjoying
peaceably the fruits of quietness: after the end of seven and forty years,
he rendered up unto Nature that debt which could not be any longer kept back
and detained; and left his eldest son (called Magus) inherit or unto his
kingdom and government, which was in the one and fiftieth year of the reign
of Nynus the third king of Babylon, and when his father Samothes had commanded
that country sevenscore and five years, being at his death about three
hundred years of age, or much thereabout. This Samothes was of that esteem in
those days, and so generally reverenced and loved for his virtues through all
that country, that the Gaulois or Frenchmen, even unto the time of Julius
Caesar, boasted and gloried of nothing so much, as that they were descended and
issued from him, so highly was he possessed of the peoples hearts, in the
greatest opinion of truest love, the which thing also Julius Caesar in the sixth
book of his Commentaries more copiously remembers. In his time also the sects
of Philosophy first took their beginning and original in Europe, and were
called Samothees, which were men studied and expert in all letters, humane and
divine; contrary to the opinion of many, who write, that Greece was the first
mother and bringer forth of arts and sciences. But Diogenes Laertius, in the
beginning of his book entitled, The lives of the Philosophers, contradicts
those suppositions, saying: Philosophiam a Barbaris initia sumpsisse complures
auctores asserunt, constat enim apud Persas claruisse Magos, apud Babilonios
and Assirios floruisse Caldeos, apud Celtas and Gallos Druidas, and qui
Samothei dicuntur. Magus, the eldest son of the Patriarch and Saturn,
Samothes surnamed Dis, began now to take upon him the rule and command of this
his country so left unto him by rightful succession from his father, in the
three hundred year after the flood, after the nativitie of the Patriarch
Abraham eight years, and before the birth of Christ two thousand and
seventeene years. This Magus was a prince of great wisdom, learning and
judgment, and also a great builder, as the interpretation of his name
delivers us: for this word Magus, in the Scythian tongue signifies a builder
or erecter; and in the Persian language, a Philosopher or a wise man. And
Berosus in his book of Time thus says of him: Nini LI. anno, apud Celtas
regnavit Samothis filius Magus, a quo oppida plurima posita sunt in ea regione:
by which it may be gathered, that he was the first that ever in that country
caused any villages, cities towns or houses to be built and erected, for
before that time men lived altogether in the fields, under the umbrages of
trees and covertures of some pleasant groves. Johannes Annius di Viterba in his
Commentaries upon Berosus, says, That this word Magus signifies in that
tongue which first was used in that country of Gaul, as much, as a palace,
house, or mansion: which opinion challenges unto it self the stronger
probability, for that with Ptolomie in his Cosmographie you shall find; that
most of the most ancient towns in that country ended with this word Magus: as
in Aquitaine, Noviomagus; in the province of Lions, Neomagus; in Gallia
Belgica, Rhotomagus, which is now the city of Roan in Normandy: there is also
Berbetomagus, Vindomagus, and many others, whose names do end in this word
Magus; as also Nimegham in Guelderland, was called likewise Noviomagus. By all
these instances it is made apparent, that this Magus, the son of Samothes,
Magus king of France the first that ever built towns in that country, and
caused them to be inhabited
was the first that reduced and gathered together the people of that country
into villages, towns, and boroughs. And further, either of his life, or the
certain time or continuance of his reign and government, it has not been by
any allowed author or ancient writer capitulated.

After Magus, succeeded one of his sons called Sarron, Sarron king of France,
the first fou^der of Universities.
the third king of France, who excelled in the study of letters, and governed
his people with great mildnes, clemency, and uprightness; and he was the
first that erected universities or public schools of learning: and of him
also came a sect of Philosophers called Sarronides, as Diodorus Siculus in his
sixth book of Antiquities affirms, thus saying: Sunt apud Celtas Theologi, ac
Philosophi quos vocant Sarronidas, qui precipue ab eis coluntur, nam moris est
apud illos nullum absque Philosopho sacrificium facere, etc. For in those days
Philosophers and men of learning were regarded with great reverence, zeal, and
gracious respect; and nothing there, of any import was concluded or agreed upon
without their privities consent or advise therein.

Unto the kingdom of France after Sarron, came Drijus, Sarrons eldest son,
unto whom Berosus ascribes this title: Apud Celtas Drijus peritiae plenus. He
began to reign four hundred and ten years after the general deluge, which
was about two hundred five and fifty years after the first foundation and
inhabitation of the kingdom of France. He was deeply seen in principles of
Philosophy, and very skillful in many other sciences. And it is very credibly
delivered by many very grave and learned writers, that he built the city of
Dreux in Normandy, and that of his name came the sect of Philosophers, which
were called Druydes, which were wondrous learned Divines, Augurers, Magicians,
and Sacrificers: but such their oblations and sacrifices in these their days
of blindness, were performed with such inhumane and ungodly fashions, with the
effusion and shedding of human blood in that lamentable and cruel manner, as
is too strange to be reported: which unnatural and impious custom, was
abolished and clean put down by the first Roman Emperors, Augustus, and
Divus Claudius, as Suetonius Tranquilius, Julius Caesar, and Pliny, more
directly have particularized the same.

After the death of this king Drijus, his son (called Bardus) reigned in his
place, and was the fifth king of France. This Bardus was the first deviser and
inventor of rimes, songs, and Music, of whom the Poets and Rhethoricians
first took their sect, which were called also Bardes, Bardus king of France
first inve^tor of Poetry.
as Diodorus Siculus in his sixth book more at large remembers. And these
Poets and singers were held in that reverenced regard in those times among
those people, that if upon the instant encounter of the battles of the enemies
on both parts, these Poets had stepped and put themselves in between both the
armies, they had for that present time recalled their furious intendments, and
been mollified with the pleasant persuasive tongues of these eloquent
Rhethoricians and sweet-singing Poets, as Berosus in one place says to the
same purpose: Etiam apud agrestiores barbaros ira cedit sapientiae and Mars
reveretur musas.

The debt due unto Nature being fully satisfied by this king Bardus (for no
quillit or evacuation whatsoever may avoid it) his eldest son called Longho
was called upon to undertake that which his father had left hereditarie unto
him: of whom, no extraordinary memorable thing is left by fame unto the
sons of time, nor any authority of any great antiquarie possesses us with
his worthiness virtues or perfections: it is only supposed, that before his
death he built the city of Langres, which we call in Latin Civitas
Lingonensis. And he had a son called Bardus the younger, which was the
seventh king of France, and began to command some three hundred and one and
forty years after the foundation and enpeopling of this country of France.
And it is very probable, That of these two kings Longho and Bardus, the first
original and beginning of the people called Lombards took their being and
name, for they are entearmed in Latin Longobardi, which nation, although at
the first they were extracted and descended out of Almaign (now called
Germany) yet they bare domination and rule for the space of two hundred years
and more in Italy, even until the time of king Charlemaine, who absolutely
deprived them of all command, power, and authority in that country round
about.

The eight king of France, was Lucus, the son of Bardus the younger, of whom
it is written (as Ptolomy and others do affirm) the people called Luces or
Lucenses (since inhabiting about the city of Paris) took their name and
original. Of him also, writers have been very sparing to speak of, more than
that he begat a son called Jupiter Celtes, the ninth king of France, and
father to the fair and beauteous gyantesse Galathea, whom before we so
largely spoke of and remembered. And it is by computation and due reckoning
found, that since the first Saturn and king of France called Samothes surnamed
Dis, unto the reign of Jupiter Celtes, were about four hundred years. And now
having thus lineally drawn the succession of every king of this country,
since the first inhabitation thereof until this Jupiter Celtes, and so
consequently unto his son in law, Hercules of Lybia, now the tenth king of
France; we will proceed with him (now employed about his affairs in Italy)
and with his issue and posterity, as it is delivered by authors of great
worth, learning, and authority.

It has been before somewhat touched, how Hercules passing through those
mountainous places of the country of Savoy, at length arrived in Italy, where
(having a puissant army) he presently fell to wars with the Giants called
Lestrigones, most bloody, cruel, and oppressive tyrants, and the murderers or
consenting aidants unto the death of his father Osyris (surnamed Jupiter
Iustus.) With these powerful commanders in that country, he entertained many
fights, and found them very resolute, and prepared to endure the uttermost of
his mightiness and strength: yet in the end, after a ten years wars he
victoriously triumphed over them, and utterly razed out all their issue and
posterity whatsoever: and the place wherein his last battle against these
Giants, was fought in, retains still his old name, and is yet called, The
valley of the Giants; which is hard adjoining unto the city called Tuscanella
in Tuscania. These civil and intestine broiles being thus valiantly and
successefully appeased, Hercules remained a quiet and peaceable possessor of
all the country of Italy, wherein he reigned and continued for the space of
twenty years, much about the time that his father Osyris, his grandfather
Cham, and his great grandfather Noe, had there commanded: in which time he
bestowed many gracious and commodious good turns upon the people of that
country, and built and erected many gallant and famous cities, although the
most part of them be at this day by the all consuming tyranny of Time
ruinated, spoiled, and decayed. He also at this time caused the Island of
Sardinia to be peopled, frequented, and inhabited, which until that time lay
wast, depopulate, and barbarous: and in this place he appointed a ruler called
Iolaus to command as under him, that country, and those people so committed
unto him. He likewise caused through most part of Italy (especially in the
moorish and wettest places thereof) many ditches and trenches to be cast up,
that thereby the palludious meres and standing lakes, might find passages to
empty their floods, and that the fields and bastures by that means might be
preserved dry, and be made more fit for agriculture, tillage, and other
necessary increases for the general profit and good of all the whole country
thereabouts: and of him the river Arnus takes name, for Hercules was also
surnamed Musarnus: and he lived for the most part of the time that he spent in
that country, in a city called Fesula in Tuscania, which city even at this
day (though not in that glory as heretofore) gives the arms of Hercules.

Italy being thus freed from the servitude wherein it lived of those ungodly
and uncivile Giants, and being now brought to a general quietness, ease, and
prosperous estate, Hercules determined with himself to send for both of his
eldest sons, to establish the one in the principality of Italy, and the
other in the kingdom of France; and he to take his journey once again into
Spain (to which country he was much addicted) there to live privately, and
to spend the rest of his years to come, in peace pleasantness, and in all
content. Whereupon he dispatched messengers to his wife Galathea (then
remaining in France, as has been before spoken of) to send him presently his
son Galatheus, being now of man's estate, and very able to bear arms. Other
messengers were dispatched into Scythia (now called Tartaria) there to seek out
his eldest son Tuscus, then remaining with the queen Araxa, queen of
Scythia, inhabiting those countries which lie upon the flood Tanais, and by the
moors and water-lakes called Meotides. Upon the commandment of king Hercules,
Galathea his wife presently sent unto him his son Galatheus into Italy,
accompanied with the greatest men of France, who was very joyously welcomed
unto his father with great feasts and signs of gladness: for he was now
grown up unto a gallant big proportion of body and comely feature, and was
also of a very gentle and gracious disposition, mild in his demeanures, and yet
majesticall and of a spirit-promising aspect, throughout all his countenance.
Not long after him arrived his elder brother Tuscus from Tartaria, who also was
of a mighty corpulencie and extraordinary large stature, whom indeed Hercules
had begot in the very prime of his youth and vigorous lustiness. Upon the
meeting of these two, a great court or assembly of great lords and princes was
held in all pomp, glory, and magnificence: where, in the presence of all the
noble Lords and Barons of diverse countries and governments, as of Egypt,
Lybia (now called Africa) Spain, France, Italy, and Tartaria, with great
solemnities, rites, and ceremonies, Tuscus was created and established the sole
king, Saturn, and commander of all the country of Italy, and he was there
invested in the dignity of Ceritus, that is as much to say, as Jupiter
crowned, or Patriarch of Tuscania: and the younger brother Galatheus, aged about
six and thirty years or thereabouts, was preferred also at that time unto the
rule and government of the kingdom of France. All which ceremonies were
performed with great triumph, state, and royalty, and kept in the city of
Viterba, in the year after the universal inundation of the world, six hundred
and five and twenty, before the foundation of Troy ninescore and one years,
and before the incarnation of Christ a thousand six hundred forty eight. These
things thus solemnly consummated, and Hercules voluntarily dispossessing
himself of these two such imperial crowns. After he had delivered some
instructions and principles of good government to these new erected kings,
Tuscus and Galatheus, after a general conge of them all, he took his journey
toward Spain, to the great discontent and greese of all the chief Barons,
and also of the Plebeians, throughout all the country of Italy: but being
now arrived in Spain, he found his son H^spalus, which he himself had before
established in that kingdom, to be dead, who had reigned only seventeene
years: and that after him succeeded his nephew Hispanus, the seventeenth king
of Spain, and the first of that name, who called the country after his own
name, Hispania, which name it ever since has retained: for before that time it
was called H^beria. This Hispanus reigned afterward some two and thirty
years or near thereabouts, as most writers and Cronographers of Spain do
agree. And in this kings reign, about the nineteenth year thereof (as is
before written) arrived Hercules in that country, now very aged, and of many
years, where he continued three years with his nephew, without any command
or place, in as great content, ease, and quiet as might be, for he had now
given over the desire of rule and principality, and gloried in nothing so
much, as that he by his own valor, prowess, and labors, had conquered such
gallant countries to dispose of as he himself thought good, and to give to
his children to enjoy as their rightful inheritances: for indeed he was the
Monarch and prince almost of all the world, and had attained unto such his
height of glory and fame, not by oppressions, tyranny, or unlawfulness, but
by the subduing of wicked and ungodly giants, the deposing of all usurpers and
bloody governors, and by the abolishing and rooting out of all divellish and
inhumane customs then observed in those days among the poor and
faith-wanting vulgars in those times of error. In these his times of
privatenesse and retired living which he spent in Spain, he builded and caused
to be erected many great towns, cities, and villages; for which cause the
people of that country still call him Hercules the builder. Besides this, also
he gave and addicted himself to the finding out of the natures of strange
herbs, and to the study of Astronomy, and the Magic art, where in he
wondrous deeply was seen, and excellently well read; but he never applied the
use thereof but unto the good and general commodity of the country. He
found out many remedies and enchauntments against the poison of serpents and
many other venomous beasts, then abounding in that country in great plenty,
and by which the inhabitants before were greevously molested and exceedingly
troubled. He also performed there many other memorable things of great worth,
value, and import, as Higinus and many other very learned writers do affirm.
Not long after, his nephew Hispanus, king of Spain, died without issue, and
left none of his own blood to inherit the kingdom after him: whereupon by
the general entreatie of all the whole land, and by public consent, the
command and government of that country was imposed upon Hercules, whom the
people for his virtues, fair demeanures, and good government, did indeed very
highly affect and reverence: and here (having so fit an occasion to speak of
the original and antiquity of this country of Spain) we will for a while
leave him, undertaking the charge once again and the command and government
thereof: and we will begin with the first king of Spain, and so by succession
and lineall descent from one to another, as far as Berosus, Eusebius, Solynus,
and Diodorus Siculus have proceeded therein, and until we come to the reign
of this Hercules.

The very first inhabitation and peopling of this country of Spain, was by
those people that came from the other side of the Caspian sea, called Iberi,
Persae, Phenices, and Paeni, as Pliny in the third book of his natural
history does allege; as also Marcus Varro, and Cato in his originals do
affirm the same; wholly condemning the Grecians of vain glory and ignorance,
to write, that Hercules, Pirenes, Lusus, and Pan were the first that ever
inhabited in this country: but of the colonies therefore of those people
before mentioned, it is very certain, that Spain took first her original, as
also those other Islands round about, is called Sicilia, Corsica, Sardinia, and
Baleares: and the Island Corsica was so called of the people Corsi, which the
Grecians term Cyrnum or Cyrum, but the Persians and Hebrews Corsum: and
after these people, the Goths and Alani came and lived in Spain long time,
and continued for the most part of them until this very present wherein we
now live, from whom and from the rest before mentioned, it is delivered for
certain by many ancient, grave, and learned writers, this country of Spain
deriveth her first beginning and principal foundation.

S. Jerome, Eusebius, Josephus, and many other approved good authors, do all
consent and agree, That Tuball the fifth son of Iaphet, the son of Noe, was
the first that ever was called by the name of king in that country of Spain,
and that he was also the first that erected and built towns and cities, and
prescribed bounds and limits in the same; which as Berosus says, was after the
flood a hundred three and forty years, and in the twelfth year of the reign
of Nembroth, the Babylonians Saturn and ruler; which was before the foundation
of Troy six hundred thirty seven years, and before the nativitie of Christ
two thousand two hundred years. The great city which he called after his own
name (Tuball) is in Baetica, as Pomponius Mela affirms, as also Strabo
averreth the same. This kings chief study and delight was in pasturage, in
flocks of sheep, and herds of cattle, wherein in those times men reposed
great contentment, pleasure, and felicity: and such his study the people
(called Arameans) entearmed by the name of Tharaconem, which is as much to say,
as Pastorum congreationem, The meeting together or assembly of sheepeheards, as
S. Jerome and the Thalmudists of the Jews interprets it: and of the same the
great city of Tharacona is called, as Saguntum first took her name of Sagus,
the builder and erecter thereof. He began also first to set down laws,
precepts, and directions unto his people, and to possess them with the opinion
of good obedience unto their prince, and persuaded them by fair and gentle
means to the embracement of a civil and quiet life and conversation: and
this, Berosus says was performed and done in the fourth year of Ninus king of
Babylon, as before in some places has been a little remembered: and Strabo
says, That in the tenth year of the same Ninus king of Babylon, and in the
age of Tuball one hundred and fifteen years, Noe (surnamed Ianus) coming out
of Africa and Phoenicia, arrived in Spain, and brought thither with him two
colonies, called Nooelas and Nooeglas; although Pliny in his third book of
natural history, in the six and twentieth chapter thereof calls them
Nooegas and Nooelas: and in this country were they planted, and remained with
great multiplication, increase and abundance. This Tuball reigned in this his
government, until the nine and fortieth year of the reign of Ninus, and
from the first inhabitation of Spain a hundred and five and fifty years: The
Patriarch Abraham borne.
and in this kings government was the Patriarch Abraham borne, which was just
by all nearest computation, toward the end of his reign, and in the four and
fortieth year of the before specified Ninus king of Babylon.

Unto Tuball succeeded his son called Iberus, in the government and kingdom
which he had left him to enjoy: which was from the flood two hundred ninety
and nine years, from the first enpeopling of Spain a hundred fifty six,
before the erection of Troy five hundred thirty and one, and before the birth
of Christ two thousand and sixteen years. Marcus Varro.
And of this Iberus (as Marcus Varro alleges) the country was generally
called Iberia, as it was afterward Celtiberia, of certain people called
Celtes, inhabiting long after in France, as many authentike hystorians do
affirm: and of this king also the river Iberus took her name, Solynus.
and was so called. This flood, as Solynus, Albertus Magnus, and Diodorus
Siculus aver, begins his first Spring, and takes his head under the hills
called Montes Pyrenaei, which lately before we remembered, and from thence runs
winding and crooked like the shape of a serpent or snake through the
promontorie of Feraria, and so tumbleth down amain into the sea called
Pelagus Beleare. And this king Iberus reigned until the three and thirtieth
year of the rule of Semiramis, which is about seven and thirty years or much
thereabouts, as Eusebius accounts it.

The third king of Spain, according to the opinion of most hystorians, was
Iubalda, of whose name the hill called Iubalda, was so called, as Berosus
affirms, although in Ptolomie it is written Iubeda, Ptolomie.
and by the successions of times, corruptibly Gybaltar, by which name at this
time the country does acknowledge it. This Iubalda began to enter into his
kingdom in the four and thirtieth year of the reign of Semiramis: from the
worlds inundation three hundred thirty six, from the birth of the holy
Patriarch Abraham four and forty, from the first inhabitation of Spain two
hundred wanting seven years, before the building of Troy four hundred
fourscore and four years, and before the birth of our Savior Christ one
thousand nine hundred fourscore and one years. And in this kings reign the
ever-famoused Hercules of Lybia was borne, which was before the birth of the
Grecian Hercules, of whom so many grave authors have written and been
deceived, almost seven hundred years: of the difference of which, because it
has bred such an incurable skar of error among very learned and old writers, I
think it shall not be much impertinent in this place something to
particularize. Of the number therefore of those men which were called by the
name of Hercules, Varro.
Varro and many other authors allege to be at the least three and forty
several names, but the most famous and renowned were only two, of which, the
first and most worthy was called Egiptius Thebanus, or Hercules Licicus; the
second, Alcaeus Graecus, the son of Alcmena and Amphitrio, as Diodorus Siculus,
Herodotus, and many others affirm, who report also, That there was a temple in
Phoenicia built and dedicated unto the first Hercules many years before the
coming of this Hercules Graecus, the son of Amphitrio, and that also long
after both these two (with the ancient Grecians) were held and worshipped in
great reverence and adoration; but the one of them, being Hercules Egiptius
(say they) was adored as a god, the other but as a mighty and famous
conqueror. Cicero in his book entitled de natura Deorum, sets down this
Hercules also as a god, as Macrobius also and many others have opinionated the
same. Diodorus Siculus in his first book confidently alleges, That this
Hercules Graecus had not to name Hercules, which signifies hearty, but that
his proper name was Alceus and also Heraclius, which interpreted, signifies
Iunonis gloria: which opinion likewise Herodotus consents with, when in his
second book of hystories he affirms, that this word Hercules is not a
Greek word, but of the Egyptian language, and that the Grecians afterward
stole it from the right owner thereof, and unworthily attributed it unto this
Alceus, the son of Amphitrio: which thing also Eusebius maintains, and
says, That those famous and gallant exploits wherewith the world was so long
possessed, and carried such universal admirations among all men, were misplaced
and bestowed on a stranger, that came not near the true merit and worthiness
of him whom it truly concerned; thereby clean exempting and excepting this
Alceus (Amphitrios son) from all interrest or right unto any these so high
and wonder-worthy performances, as only particular and belonging unto this
noble Hercules Egiptius or Libicus, the son of Osyris, called Jupiter Iustus
(as Diodorus Siculus, Berosus, and Moses also, certainly do report.) Unto him
also the people of Lybia consecrated many triumphs, ceremonious observances,
and general feasts, as one for his valor and virtues honored and worshipped
amongst them as a mighty and powerful god: so were they blinded from the true
sight and understanding of knowledge, in those times of darkness, error, and
superstition. And these people were first called Phutei or Phaetontei, as
Josephus and Iheronimus in his tenth chapter upon the book of Genesis
affirms. Unto this Hercules of Lybia were adjoined also all these names
(according to the Egyptian tongue) Her, Hercol, Arno, Musarno, and Ar; of
which, hereafter occasion will present it self, further to expound, and more
largely to speak of: but it is most unfallibly certain, that this Hercules
Egiptius or Libicus, was long before the times of the so much renowned Hercules
of Greece: who indeed according to the writings of very many grave and learned
authors, deserved not the least part of so many glorious praises and titles of
honor, as the flattering and selfe-pleasing conceits of the Grecians have so
amply and prodigally ascribed unto him: for he is by many authors set down no
other but a very pyrate on the sea, a robber and bloody oppressor, where he
could find out any booty or advauntage to show his power, will, and
mightiness; much unlike the proceedings that victorious and virtuous conqueror
Hercules of Lybia: to approve which to be no detraction, but memorious notes of
forepassed learned writers, Manethon that famous Priest and Hystorian of
Egypt, thus says: Constat hunc Herculem Graecum dolo non bello Laumedontem
nil eiusmodi, suspicantem occidisse, and primum ex maximis piratis extitisse,
quanquam virum divino and admirabilirobore preditum, etc. Whereby it is very
apparent by this authority and many others of like worth and antiquity, that
this Hercules the Grecian was but some famous robber or pyrate, living for the
most part among the Argonauts, men excelling in warlicke discipline, and armed
with armours of iron and other like furnitures for the wars, as Eusebius says:
Hercules Alceus affuit domito jam orb, and legibus and regibus formato, and
instituto, and formidoloso ferro invento: whereas contrariwise, Hercules
Egiptius lived in times of ignorance, in respect of those knowledges, when the
use of armor or iron was unfound out, the fury of war not then felt, and in
times of new-rising tumults, not as then ripened or grown to any head or
maturitie. His armor was the skins of wild beasts, and such like
accoustrements was he habited with: which also is attributed unto Hercules
Alceus, as having a Lions skin and a great club in his hands, but they are
among the rest of the fables which the Grecians used, inserted: for it is
nothing likely, that the use of iron being in those times found out, he would
have used any such inferior means of defense for the safety of his body.
This assertion also makes clean contrary against him: for Hercules of Lybia
was borne before the destruction of Troy (according to the computation of the
Egyptian years) above ten thousand years, but Alceus not fully two
thousand, as Diodorus in his first book of Time alleges: which manner of
computation and reckoning of the Egyptians, if we will reduce to the order and
rule observed by the Chaldeans, Scythians, Hebrews, and Ianigenae, which is by
the circular circumference and revolution of the Sun, accounting it as we now
reckon, we shall find, that he was borne presently after the king of Babylon
called Ninus, which is according to our latter observation, some eight hundred
years before the overthrow and ruin of Troy; which makes up the number and
proportion of ten thousand years, held and observed among the Egyptians: by
which we may perceive the great distance of time that was between these two
famous personages, Hercules Egiptius or Libicus, the son of Osyris, surnamed
Jupiter Iustus, and Hercules Graecus or Alceus (or as some hold) the son of
Amphitrio and Alcmena: or the son (by adulterous means) as some others do
think, of one called Jupiter Graecus. But having now thus far digressed from
the maine entendement, we will return to the prosecuting thereof.

The continuance of the reign of the above written Iubalda, king of Spain,
dured from the four and thirtith year of the reign of Semiramis, the
Babylonian Empress, until the eighteenth year of Arius; which is in the
whole about the time of threescore and four years, as by the diligent and
careful collections both of Eusebius and Berosus, is clearly approoved. And
about this time (the Patriarch Abraham, being about the age of a hundred
years) is borne his son Isaac, Isaac born.
as all hystories for the most part give record and mention. In the government
of this king Iubalda, no memorable act done in that country, is left written
by hystorians.

Unto the kingdom of Spain, next after him, succeeded Brygus, which was in
the eighteenth year of the late specified Arius, the Babylonians sixth king;
which is from the first inhabitation of Spain, two hundred threescore and
seven years, and before the foundation of Troy four hundred and thirty. This
word Brygus with the Arameans and Armenians, is called Castellum. And the
Etruscians at this day (with whom many words of the Aramen language remain)
call a castle Bricola, by changing the letter g into c. This king Brygus (as
Berosus and other writers affirm) founded and erected many towns and great
castles in the kingdom of Spain, as Ptolomie also copiously has delivered;
as in the country of Lusitania, there are castles called at this day
Laccobryga, Mirobryga, and others. And in the province of Taracona, a town
called Brygantum, Volubryga, and many others, sounding and ending after the
name of the king Brygus. Pliny says in his fifth book of natural history,
Pliny.
that many old writers do affirm, That a certain people called Brygi in Europe
traveled into Asia, and there builded a city and called it Brygios, which
afterward by changing the letter B into P, was called Phrygios; and that the
Phrygians afterward from these people took their first original and being,
of whom issued that famous progeny of the Trojanes, so gloriously renowned
throughout the world: and this king Brygus reigned in all security and peace
until the first year of the reign of Balaneus, the eight king of Babylon,
which was about two and fifty years or near therabouts.

The fifth king of Spain was Tagus (as Berosus and Diodorus deliver) and he
began his rule and government before the nativitie of Christ a thousand eight
hundred threescore and five years, before the building of Troy threescore and
eighteen years, after the first peopling of Spain three hundred and nine
years. And of this kings name that far-famed river Tagus takes her name: in
which (as Pliny and Solynus report) were found many golden sands, heaped
together in many places of that river. This king with many authors is called
also Tagum Orma, and Moses by synoereicall composition, terms him Tagorma,
as Ptolomie and many other writers of great worth and credit, more
particularly have spoken of the same: and this Tagus reigned in the kingdom of
Spain, about the time of thirty years, by all due computation and conferring
of consent of times, and as Berosus affirms the same.

In the first year of the reign of Armatritis the ninth king of the
Babylonians and Assyrians, the rule and government of the kingdom of Spain
fell and came unto Betus, of whom afterward a great part of that country took
her name, and was known by the name of Baetica. The Etruscians by
transposition and division of ae, call him Beatus, which with the Latins
signifies happy or blessed. The Hebrews derive this word Betus from Behin,
which as S. Jerome interprets it, means as much as, locus vitae meae (id est)
foelic tatis ^ptatae: and from hence it is likely, that in this country some
supposed the Elesian fields to be, and so also thereby many other such like
suppositions arose, which to decide, would here be tedious, and too much
digression from the matter intended. This king Betus reigned seven and thirty
years, as Berosus and other authors do allege.

After him in the eight and thirtith year of Armatritis above mentioned,
Gerion (surnamed Aser) challenged unto him the rule and domination of the
country of Spain: wherein it is written, he governed with great tyranny and
oppression of the inhabitants thereof, intruding himself by violent and
forcible means into the possession and government of that kingdom. This word
Gerion signifies in the Hebrew tongue as much as advena in Latin, which he
manifested more plainly by coming from Mauritania into this kingdom of
Spain, and ruling there like a stranger, according to his own will, desire,
and mightiness. Berosus, as also Diodorus Siculus, does affirm, That he had
another name also, which in the Aramen and Mauritanian language was Deabo, in
the Greek Chryseo, in Latin Aureo, which first of all came of his great
wealth and store of gold, in which he most wonderously abounded in those days:
and this Gerion reigned thus in this his usurped authority until the eight
and twentieth year of the reign of Belochus, the tenth king and ruler of
Babylonia, which was about the time of three and thirty years or near
therabouts. Immediately after him, three brethren together took the rule and
government of this country of Spain into their hands, which were called Deabi
Lomnimi, which word (as S. Jerome expounds it) signifies the cheefes or
rulers of armies, and which we call by the name of the three Gerions, being
indeed the sons of the beforementioned Gerion, the last king and ruler of
Spain. In the time when these three brethren thus reigned and ruled together,
happened that generally known accident, which afterward the world so
universally entertained from the report of loud-tongued Fame, which was, the
untimely and unfortunat death of Osyris, surnamed Jupiter Iustus; who was most
traitorously and vilely murdered by his brother Typhaeus Egiptius, whose
all-lamented death was afterward highly revenged by his son Hercules Lybicus,
who instantly took up arms, and scoured almost all the countries of the world,
until he had found out the author of the murder of his father Osyris, upon
whose body, his angry and wrathful mind took in the end direful and cruel
revenge: at which time also (he being in the pride and fullness of fury and
choler) searched out all corners and places of abode, where any such like
bloody and impious giants, rulers, and commanders, kept their tyrannical and
uncivile governments: among the rest, he slew Busyris in Phoenicia, Typhaeus
the younger in Phrygia, Mylinus, a great commander on the sea in Crete,
Antheus in Lybia, the Lestrigones in Italy, and afterward, these three
brethren called Geriones in Spain, and also many others in many other places,
as has already heretofore been spoken of. After the overthrow thus of these
late specified Geriones, he established and appointed to succeed them one
called Hispalus, who now after these, instantly took upon him the government
thereof.

Hispalus therefore (according to the report and affirmation of Berosus) now
entered to take possession of the regaltie and principality of Spain, which
was from the flood five hundred fourscore and nine years, before the erection
of Troy two hundred one and forty years, before the birth of Christ a thousand
seven hundred twenty seven, and after the first finding out and peopling of
Spain three hundred seven and forty years. Of this Hispalus, the city
Hispalis first was erected and so entearmed, and he was the son of Hercules
Lybicus, as many authors and writers of fame and great antiquity have given
in report unto the posterity of time. He reigned and commanded over Spain
until the very end of the reign and government of Baleus, the Babylonians
eleventh king which was by just reckoning and account, the time of seventeene
years.

In the first year of the reign of Altades, the twelfth king of Babylonia,
Hispanus the nephew of Hercules, was established king and sole ruler over the
dominions of Spain, of whom the country then generally was called Hispania,
which the malice of time has not yet worn out, but still it is known and
called after the same name. After him, Hercules (coming out of Italy, fraught
with years and many victories) took upon him by the election and suffrages of
all the people, the rule and government thereof. And thus has been lineally
drawn forth the first inhabitation of the country of Spain with the
particular and right successions of the kings and commanders thereof, as has
been warranted and allowed by writers of great antiquity and industrious
Chronographers of Spain: where we will now surcease to wade any further, having
brought it unto the very times where we last left our chief purpose and
matter; and will go forward, and proceed from hence until we shall nearer
arrive at the time wherein Troy was first erected and founded, following herein
the same manner of method and form, with which we first set forth, and mean
to continue unto the end (by the favorable permission and allowance of the
divine Majesty.) Hercules therefore ruling thus in Spain, built and erected
many goodly cities and fair castles in that country, whereupon at this day in
some ancient records and monumentall schedules of Spain, you may read of
another title given unto him, which is, Hercules edificator. He was called also
by these names, as Her, Hercol, Arno, Musarno: and they thus signify and are
englished from the Hebrew tongue, as S. Jerome and others expound it: Her
signifies hairie, Hercol all covered over with hair, Arno signifies a Lion,
and Musarno the portraiture or effigies of a Lion, and these names were thus
ascribed unto him, for that he always wore for his upper garment the hairie
skins of Lions, Bears, Leopards, and other such like beasts, and for that on
his shield or targuet was depainted and drawn the shape and form of a Lion,
and which, in all his wars and attempts he always carried about him: and with
some he was called the knight of the ramping Lion. The town of Vetulonia,
called also Viterbe, caused the picture of Hercules to be stamped and
imprinted on their coin: which continued unto the time of the reign and
government of the last king of the Lumbards, who then abollished the
remembrance thereof by any such representation or means of memory. After the
time of some nineteen years or thereabouts, as most writers do allege,
having governed with all love and obedience of the people, Hercules died,
leaving all those countries thereabouts heavily lamenting the loss and
departure of so noble and gallant a conqueror; which was about the time of his
own age three hundred and fifty years, and after he had reigned and
commanded in France, Italy, and Spain, threescore and seven years. In
solemn remembrance of whose generally deplored death, the people of Spain
erected many must sumptuous and costly monuments, and bestowed upon him a
wonderful rich and stately tomb, which as some hold, was built hard by that
place, which as we now call them, the Gades, pillars, or columns of Hercules
are seated upon, being not far from the famous streights of Gibraltar. Unto him
also after his death they attributed very godlike honors, and terms of
veneration and reverence; so was he possessed while he lived among mortals,
with the love and opinion of all those people therabouts, and wheresoever else
he had governed and commanded. And more of this so far renowned conqueror
Hercules shall not at this time be declared, whose victories, triumphs, and
exploits would indeed require a small volume of themselves, being so many, so
glorious, and so worthy, deserving in the perfection of their own merit to be
insculpt in the brass leaved book of time-resisting and endless perpetuity.
And now we will revert our pen to speak of his two famous sons, Tuscus king of
Italy, and Galatheus king of France, and of their issue and posterity. But
first is to be understood, that unto the kingdom of Spain next after
Hercules, succeeded Hesperus, being the twelfth king and governor thereof, and
who was brother unto the renoumed Atlas, whom hereafter occasion will be
presented to speak and entreat of.

It has been before declared and mentioned, how that the great Monarch and
Emperor Hercules dispossessing himself voluntarily of two royal and mighty
kingdoms, placed and instituted therein his two sons, Tuscus and Galatheus:
who long time after lived reciprocally, and reigned together in their several
commands and government, in all peace, quiet, and tranquillity. And to show
and manifest this their love and agreement the more, Tuscus freely bestowed and
gave unto his brother Galatheus the great Island of Sicilia, as then
appertaining and belonging unto the crown and kingdom of Italy, and which
was then altogether desolate and disinhabited (the race and generation of Cham,
Noes son, the first commander thereof, being now extinct and perished.) Unto
this Island, Galatheus made a journey, carrying with him great numbers and
abundance of people, and all things necessary for the in peopling and
inhabiting thereof: which people and nation he afterward and from thence forth
called after his own name Galath-enes; and erected and built also a very great
city there, calling it by the name of Cenegalatha, of which city likewise,
Pliny in his fourth book of Natural history does there entreat and mention.
And it was held in those days to be the greatest and cheifest honor that
might be, to authorize and license any to build and erect any city, and to
call it after his own name: for the denominating of which, no man neither
could give any leave or authority, but those which were established in place
and office of Coritus, that is, the Patriarch, Jupiter, or chief king and
commander of that country, as Tuscus then was, being the sole king and ruler
over all Italy and all those territories adjoining thereunto. And this grace
and favor Galatheus took in great thankfulness and all kind acceptance,
endeavoring by all means possible to be found grateful for so high a favor
received. After all matters were well settled and orderly disposed in this new
erected government of Sicilia, Galatheus returned back again into his
country of France, where with all signs and apparent tokens of a long wished
welcome, he was joyfully received of his people in all the provinces round
about, where we must now leave him for a while, to speak of his brother Tuscus,
and of his affairs and negotiations in his government and charge.

This Tuscus (as is before declared) was the sole and absolute King, Patriarch,
and Jupiter of all the dominions of Italy; of whose name also a chief
province of that kingdom then took her name, and was called Tuscania, and by
the favorable good will of the tyrant Time (who is wont to blot out all
relics and tokens of antiquity) it yet retains the same: in which
particular country, he for the most part made his continual abode and
residence, which before that time was called Etruria, The diverse and several
names of Italy.
and before that, Ianicula, and the people thereof Ianigenes, which is as much
to say, as the issue of Ianus: it was also called Oenotria, Hesperia, Apenina,
and many others, according to the greatness or will of any such chief or
famous king so commanding and ruling over it. Dionysius Halicarnasaeus,
writes, That the country Hetruria (taken oftentimes for the whole and entire
kingdom of Italy) was also called Comera, of Comerus, Iaphets son; and it had
to name also Razenua, It was also called Taurina and Saturnia.
Thuscia, and Thussa, and at this day Italia, as hereafter shall be declared.
Berosus further says, That at the first peopling and inhabiting thereof, it
was called Vmbria of the people Vmbri, which heretofore we have somewhat
touched, as also Pelasgia of the people Pelasgi (taken also sometimes for the
inhabitants of a country in Greece.) Besides all these, it was also known by
the name of Tarrhenia, as many authors of great and approved knowledge in
matters of antiquity, have more amply delivered, which opinion also should be
more easily entertained, if we will but diligently mark the diverse and
several names given and attributed unto other countries, after the same
fashion and manner: for first concerning the people of France, The old names
of the people of France.
they were first of all called Samothei, of Samothes their king, then Celti,
then Galatij, after that Belgae, of their king and Patriarch Beligius, after
that Galli, and since that Francigenae or Franci. The names in like manner of
the people of Germany varied and differed very often and severally: The names
of the people of Germany.
For the first name that ever that people received, were Tuyscones, of Tuyscon
one of Noes sons, the first that ever was king and ruler over that country.
After that they were called Gambrivij, then Ingheones, after that, Isteones,
Suevi, and Vandali, then also Thetanes, Theutontes, Vindelici, Vandalisci,
after that Alemanni, and last of all, of the Romans (as some hold) they were
generally entearmed Germani. So that by these it is plainly shown, how almost
all countries and nations have at diverse times been diversely and differingly
called: by the occasion of which, many writers that have not indeed seriously
and laboriously looked into fragments of old and authentike fathers, for the
derivations and first originals of cities and countries, have been infected
with some disease or other of ignorance and error; by reason of which
dangerous sickness, first creeping (though not perceived) into the heads of
men learned and of authority, it has prooved universally mortal, to all
those that have not invoked the aid of that good Physician, Industry,
throughout all the world wheresoever. And so now again we will return to the
place from whence we last of all set forth, which was from the matters and
particulars which we handled of king Tuscus, sole ruler and commander of all
the country of Italy, of whose actions or memorable atcheevements, there is
little read in any authors, only it is writ, that he first invented the order
and dignity of the Palladian knighthood, and instituted large privileges and
allowances for the maintenance of that new found ceremony. And of any matter
else which might challenge unto it self worth and extraordinary commends,
done and performed by him, few or no hystorians have written: only he left
after him, his son Altheus inheritor and rightful successor to his government
and kingdom.

Altheus then, the son of Tuscus, began to take upon him the rule and command
of Italy, presently after the death of his deceased father, which was the
fourth year after the death of his grandfather Hercules in Spain, who as you
have heard, left inheritour unto him Hesperus, the brother of Atlas, for the
government of that country: which Hesperus had not there long reigned, but
he was expulsed and driven out of his country by violent and oppressive
means by his brother Atlas the giant, surnamed Italus: so that now he was
enforced to forsake the country, and to fly into Italy, in one part of
which, he afterward commanded, and called it after his own name Hesperia,
which name it long time afterward retained. After this, Atlas Italus, not
contented sufficiently with the principality and dominion of Spain (as
overambitiously thoughted) came also into Italy, and overswayed by his
mightiness and power all the country round about, and created and established
himself king and ruler thereof, and called all the country generally after his
own name, Italia, by which it is at this day called, and in the kingdom of
Spain he appointed one of his sons to reign called Sicorus, which was now by
just account the foureteenth king thereof. When these things were thus done, he
went also into Sicilia, as Galatheus before had done, and there for a while he
rested himself, till at the length he returned again back into Italy,
wherein afterward he lived many years. This Italus Atlas by his descent was of
the lineage of Iaphet, and of his son Comerus Gallus, the first king of
Italy; and it was he, which according to the opinions of many, excelled most
of all men then living, in the knowledge of Astrology, for which cause, the
busy Poets fained, that he supported and upheld the heavens with his
shoulders. Altheus all this while was suppressed and kept under by the
mightiness of this ruler, by reason whereof, hystories cannot speak of any
worthy matter done or performed by him: only it is written, he builded and
erected two very large and beautiful cities, one of them called Alteta, the
other Althea, with a castle also called after the same name. And this Altheus,
the son of Tuscus before specified, was uncle unto Dardanus, the first
builder and founder of Troy. He had also a son called Blascon, but it is not
read, that he was afterward Coritus, that is, king of Italy, or commanded in
any extraordinary power and authority; but that this Atlas Italus created and
established one of his own sons, called Morges, in the dignity and office
thereof, wrongfully disinheriting the true heirs that might lawfully have
challenged the same: so that by this unjust means of usurpation and
greatness, the line and issue of Hercules was debarred from the possessing and
enjoying of what rightfully belonged unto them. Also he created and appointed
his daughter called Rhoma, as duchess and commaundresse of the people and
nation called Aborigines (of whom heretofore we something spoke of.) And this
Rhoma was afterward married to a prince of Tuscane, of whom she had a son called
after her own name Rhomanessos, who was the first that ever laid the first
foundation of the city of Rome; as Sempronius very confidently affirms,
condemning all those which attribute the first founding thereof unto Romulus,
who (says he) indeed beautified and enlarged the same, but was not the first
that laid the foundation thereof; and that his name Romulus (being himself
found hard by that city by wondrous accident) took his name of Roma, and
not Roma of Romulus, as the above written author Sempronius, a very sufficient
writer, and some others also of allowed authority, have averred the same. And
the interpretation of this word Rhomanessos, as S. Jerome, the Talmudists, and
many others do expound it, is as much, as, Magna aut potens sublimitas, a
mighty or powerful height or glory; being compounded of two several words
of the Aramean language; Roma, which interpreted, signifies sublimitas, and
Nesson, which is validum or magnum: or as some understand it, it signifies
validum augurium, which is, a strong and infallible prophecy, which indeed the
exceeding greatness and all subjugating power and mightiness of that Empire
did afterward very fitly answer and make good, being raised unto that infinite
greatness and highest perfection of soveraignetie, that it impelled almost the
greater part of the world to sue unto her for favor, and to become tributarie
in great taxes and impositions unto her seat and magnificence. And this city
also was called long after by the name of Valentia: of which, now we will
cease further to entreat, returning to the matter before handled of Atlas,
surnamed Italus, now flourishing and commanding over Italy in great
puissance, glory, and mightiness: who although (as it is already before
specified) he bore great affection, favor, and love unto his son Morges, and
had established him in the regaltie and kingdom of Italy, as Coritus, yet he
began in the end to think and meditat with himself how apparent and monstrous
wrongs and indignities he had offered to all the issue and posterity of
Hercules, in expelling Altheus, and depriving his son Blascon of his right in
the principality of that country; and in those thoughts and humors, he
caused to be called unto him Camboblascon, the son of the beforementioned
Blascon, the son of Altheus, and in lieu and recompense of all former and
forepassed injuries, he gave unto him one of his own daughters in marriage and
matrimonial association, who was called Electra, with whom in dowry he gave
all those towns and countries lying about the Alps and the hither mountains,
nearest confining upon Italy: and upon this, presently after died. After whose
death, his son Morges, possessed belike with holy and religious cogitations,
acknowledging the mighty wrong and disparagement which his father had imposed
on his brother in law Camboblascon, in depriving him of his rightful
succession, willingly and voluntarily despoiled himself of his crown and
command, and transferred it upon Camboblascon, whom presently he caused to
be created and established in the dignity of Coritus, that is, the Jupiter or
king of Italy; and so after that, contented himself to live privately and
obscurely with his brother in law and sister Electra: with whom he had not
many years lived and conversed, but he died, and paid Nature that debt which
no sureties can put off, or be bound for: and so then Camboblascon was with
more general allowances of the people fully invested in his office and place
of Coritus, which is as much to say, as Jupiter Coronatus, as I have already
made known, and which I cannot almost too often expound, in that many have made
so many and several doubts and scrupules, What these Jupiters, Saturnes, and
Hercules might mean? which names indeed are nothing else but titles of honor,
superiority, and dignity: and Jupiter was such, as in Egypt Pharoa, and in
Rome Caesar, and as now their Pope: for Jupiter is as much as, Iuvans pater:
and Papa, Pater patrium. And whereas the superstitious people in those days
honored and reverenced them as gods, it was nothing else, but for some
excellency and great dignity they possessed, or for some great virtue,
learning, and knowledge they were then endued with, as Fabius Pictor and
Zenophon have delivered the same, saying: Principes quia iusti erant, and
religionibus dediti, iure habiti dij, and dicti. Non enim arbitria illorum ab
equo, vel populis a iure innato discedebant. Now then having satisfied that
point, we may the more boldly proceed with our intendment and with the matters
of this Camboblascon, king of Italy, and Jupiter and Patriarch thereof, and
the great father (as they say) of the famous and renowned Trojans. And this
king built the fair city of Montoblascon in Tuscania, which by corruption is
now called and known by the name of Montflascon: and another also which he
named Coritus, now called Cornete, which is situated about some forty miles
from the now mighty city of Rome. And this Camboblascon had by his wise
Electra, the daughter of Atlas Italus king of Italy, three children, which are
these, Iasius, Dardanus, and Armonia: Iasius being created Coritus and
Patriarch of Italy, his father being alive, who also bestowed upon him the
rule and kingdom of France (as many hystoriographers affirm) the next year
after; so that he became very mighty and powerful in all those countries
thereabouts. And now we will proceed with the rest of the kings of France,
beginning where we last left of, which was (if it be remembered) at Galatheus,
the noble son of Hercules of Lybia, and of his fair wife Galathea: where it
was then mentioned, how this Galatheus at the hands of his loving brother
Tuscus, received the Island of Sicilia, and accordingly, carried with him people
to inhabit and possess the country, which being performed, he returned also
back again into France, as has been likewise before somewhat touched: after
which time, he lived peaceably and quietly many years, governing his people
with great mildness and clemency, and yet mingled and accompanied with
uprightness of justice, and execution of his laws and edicts; of whose deeds
and performances, more than are already spoken of, few or no writers have
mentioned, only, that of him and of his name the country generally was called
Gaul, and so continued, and the people thereof termed Gaulons, which by
corruption and overturning of many ages and times, are now in some part of that
country called Wallons, and which before Galatheus, were called Samothei or
Celti. And it is most likely by the conjecturall opinions of most writers, that
this king Galatheus remained and lived in those days for the most part in that
part of Gaul, which is now the province of Acquitaine, which is so called of
the abundance of waters and rivers, wherein that country was wont to exceed,
and that this place was held to be the first and most ancient of all the other
parts of France, which indeed are only two more, for that the whole country
of France is by most divided only into three parts, and they are called Gallia
Acquinatica, Celtica, and Belgica, which of themselves retain and carry the
very names of the first kings and rulers of them, as before is something
specified. The chief cities and principal siegnories of Gallia Aquinatica,
The chief cities of Gallia Acquinatica.
are supposed and held to be these, as most ancient writers do consent,
Narbon, Thoulouse, Caours, Rodetz, Lymoges, Perigort, Bourdeaulx, Zainctes,
Augolesme, Baione, Clermont, Bourges, Tours, Foix, Lestore, Allebreth, Saint
Pons, Nantes, Resnes, Saint Malo, and others. The cheifest rivers and waters,
these, Gironde, Dordonne, Garonne, Loire, Lalier, Cher, Charente, and many
others, now too long to recite.

After the death of the famous and most renowned prince Galatheus, his son
Harbon took upon him the government of the country, and was established the
twelfth king of France, who presently erected and built a very gallant city
for his seat, and called it Harbonne after his own name, which is now called
Narbonne, as many authors do affirm. And of this king, little or nothing is
left written, memorable, or meriting a tedious commemoration or rehearsal:
only he left behind him a son called Lugdus, which was now the thirteenth
king of this country of France, and who built the famous city called
Lugdunum, called also Lion; which is now one of the cheifest and principallest
cities of France, and which has long time flourished in great privileges,
prerogatives, and extraordinary customs, being a city indeed tres-auncient
and of long continuance; and of her name, all that province is called
Lyonnoise, which, as some hold, is contained within the bounds of Gallia
Celtica, and is the greatest and the cheifest part thereof. The first
foundation and building of the city of Lions in France.
And this city of Lions was first founded and erected by the same king Lugdus,
in the twelfth year of the reign of Mancaleus, the foureteenth king of
Babylon, which is as much to say, as after the flood and inundation of the
whole world six hundred and fourscore years, after the first inhabiting of
France five hundred and sixteen years, before the foundation of the city
of Troy one hundred and forty years, and before the now famous city of Paris
was erected, two hundred and twenty years, before Rome was built, five hundred
threescore and eighteen years, and before the incarnation and birth of our
Savior Christ a thousand six hundred seven and thirty years, or near
thereabouts. And in the times of this king Lugdus, arrived and came into
France the queen Isis, who was so famous and so renowned throughout all the
world.

After this Lugdus succeeded his eldest son Belgius, now the foureteenth king
of that country, whose name is yet even fresh in all men's memories, for of his
name that great and populous country called Gallia Belgica, took her title
and was so called, of which (as of the other) we will now make some mention.
The cheifest rivers and waters thereof are these, Lescault, la Sambre, le Lis,
le Rin, Meuse, and Moselle, Saine, Marne, Sum, le Daulx, and others: the
chief woods and forests these, Mormault, and Ardenne. The highest hills and
mountains, are the hill Saint Claude, les Faucsilles, and Vosegus. The
principal villages and greatest cities are these: Cambray, Vallenciennes,
Couloign, Conflans, Vtrecht, Mayence, Strasbourg, Aix, Constance, Lyege,
Tournay, Arras, Amiens, Beauvais, Senlis, Laon, Noyon, Soissons, Meaulx, Rouan,
Rains, Metz, Langres, Besancon, Salins, Dole, Losanne, Geneve, and Camberi. The
chief siegnories are these: the Dukedomes of Iulliers, Cleves, Cheldes,
Brabant, Lorraine, Bar, Lembourg, and Luxembourg: the counties Palatine,
Haynau, Bourgoigne, Ferretes, Montbeliard, Flaunders, Artois, Champaine,
Holland, Zeland, and Namur. This king Belgius (of whom all these gallant and
most famous countries were thus called) builded also the city of Belges, of
which, now only some ruins and relics of memory are left, which are to be
seen in the country of Haynau, and which Julius Caesar likewise in the
sixteenth book of his Commentaries does mention and remember, where he calls
it Belgium. This word Belgius (as many old writers expound it) signifies in
the Hebrew or Phenician language (which tongue the ancient Gauloys then used) as
much as, An ancient god wrestling; for in those times (as I already have
spoken) the people called their kings, gods: by which it may be gathered, that
this their king Belgius was a great wrastler, unto which kind of exercise and
unto the barriers, the people inhabiting in Gallia Belgica did not long since
wonderfully much addict themselves, and were very active and skillful therein,
howsoever at this day those sports for the most part are now utterly left off
and rejected. S. Ierom says also, That this word Belga signifies in the
Hebrew tongue, An ancient commotion, or an old strife: and indeed heretofore
those people of that country were much conversant in wars, in troubles, and
dissentions, and were held to be the most valiant and strongest nation of this
part of the world, as Caesar also in his Commentaries alleges to the same
purpose, saying: Fortissimi autem omnium Belgi. And Strabo in the fourth book
of his Commentaries also says thus: Omnium Gallorum Belgi sunt summi: as a
people that in those times (as it is written) could bring into the field three
hundred thousand fighting men. And thus much for the descriptions of the people
of the country called Gallia Belgica, with the cheifest towns, siegnories,
and rivers thereof, and now we will look back again for the prosecuting and
finishing of our former matter.

In this king Belgius, the line and race of Galatheus the son of Hercules
Lybicus, failed and was determinate, so that upon his death the people of
France (being of themselves wonderfully desirous to elect one of that lineage
so near as it was possible) bestowed the government and command of that
country upon the above written Iasius Ianigena, the son of Jupiter
Camboblascon. And so by that means Iasius was invested and established in that
kingdom as the fifteenth king and Patriark thereof. And in this year the
realm and kingdom of Athens in Greece was first set up and begun, as Berosus
our chiefly followed author in these matters of antiquity averreth, who thus
says: Apud Ianigenas a patre, Iasius creatus est Coritus, and anno sequente
simul ceperent duo reges, videlice primus Rex Athentensium Cecrops priscus, and
Iasius Ianigena apud Celtas. And this was about fourscore years or
thereabouts before the first building and erection of the city of Troy.

Iasius Ianigena, the eldest son of Jupiter Camboblascon (as is before
declared) being thus so gloriously possessed of two such regal and powerful
kingdoms, and being in the cheifest spring and blooming days of his age,
contracted and joined in marriage with a noble and rich lady called Ipitis
Cibeles: for the celebration of which nuptials and espousals, great feasts and
ceremonies of joy and triumph were held and kept, and (as some write) performed
in the city of Viterbe, then the capital seat of all Tuscania. And this was
before the foundation of Troy threescore and seventeene years, in the presence
of Dardanus the first builder thereof, and brother to the new married king
Iasius Ianigena. Many writers do affirm, That in this marriage were greater
triumphs, pastimes, sports, magnificencie, state and pomp, than in any other in
those times throughout all the world whatsoever, and cheefely in respect of
that noble assembly and meeting of so many mighty and great princes, and more
particularly for the coming of the famous empress and goddess (as they
term her) the Egyptian Isis, the daughter of Cham, the wife of Jupiter
Iustus, otherwise called Osyris, and the mother of that all renowned and ever
memorable conqueror, Hercules of Lybia, king and emperor of all France,
Italy, and Spain. And this Isis there first taught those people the manner of
making bread, of flower, meal, and such like stuff; although before that
Osyris her husband had instructed them in knowledge of agriculture, tilling,
and sowing corn, yet they were not until now perfected in the use and right
applying thereof, especially for the making of bread, which they learned and
understood by the coming of this empress Isis. And this marriage and ceremony
of association and matrimony was the first that in those times was celebrated
and solemnized with any rites, feastivals, or new invented usances, as Diodorus
Siculus to the same purpose thus says, these being his very words: Has
nuptias a dijs primum celebratas ferunt, Cereremque in gratiam Iasij ei ex
frumento panem attulisse, Mercurium lyram, Palladem decantatum monile peplum,
ac tibias, etc. This their goddess Isis, otherwise called by the names of
Ceres, Juno, Frugifera, Legifera, and others, was by all probability and by
the opinion of all writers a woman of wonderful long life and many years, for
at her now arrival and coming to this marriage into Italy, she was at the
least four hundred and fifty years old, as she that was borne in the first
year of the reign of Semiramis queen of Babylon, and lived in the whole at
the least six hundred and sixteen years, for she was living after the first
destruction and desolation of Troy, by the space of forty years or near
thereabouts, as almost all writers have delivered in their opinions to the same
purpose and effect. Johannes Annius an old writer, says, That she was in
Germany in the time of Hercules Alemannus, the eleventh king of that country,
by him called Almaigne: and Cornelius Tacitus also seems to affirm the same
by these words, Pars Suevorum etiam Isidi sacrificat. It is written also, that
she was in France in the time of Lugdus then king thereof, as has been
before declared, and that she had traveled almost all these parts of Europe,
instructing and teaching the poor ignorant people the use of many things then
unknown and unfound out. And to approove the better that she was present at
this marriage of Iasius Ianigena, it is yet apparent in that country of Tuscan
by many very ancient scrols, lest still from time to time in that country
from one posterity to another; as also certain old statues and monuments of
marble, with inscriptions of characters infixed thereon, found out in the times
of Pope Alexander the sixth, aver the same, which as Johannes Annius says,
were first found in the earth in the city of Viterbe: and that there were at
that time upon further digging and search of more such like relics, found
hidden far in the ground four several images or pictures of triumph, the one
was of Iasius, the other of his mother Electra, the third of his fair sister
Armonia, which never married, but continued and died a vestall virgin, and the
fourth was of Cibeles the now new married wife of Iasius. There was also found
another square kind of table made of marble, on which were in Greek letters,
these words following engraved, which not long after were thus translated into
Latin. Coritina desponsatio, cum Electra Atlai Kytij iamdudum pertransiverat,
and maxima Isis Frumentaria atque Panifica, concessit ad nuptias Iasij filij
Coriti, in habitaculum turrite Cibeles sponse Iasij in prelio Cybelario, ad
fontem Cybelarium, paulo post sub vadimonia palatia, and paulo post a scelerato
fratre Dardano Iasius male perijt in agro Iasinello in Theisijs, etc. And these
be the very words used heretofore by authors of antiquity. By these therefore
and by like semblable apparences it is cleared, that this Isis, their so
reverently-adored goddess, was now present at the consummation of the
espousals of Iasius Ianigena, king of Italy and France, with the lady Ipitis
Cibeles, his wife. And that this Isis had traveled and journeied through many
and diverse countries, it appears by many and several pillars and stony
monuments erected in many countries of Europe in that behalf, as many authors
do produce. Diodorus Siculus infers, That in Egypt she caused her self a
mighty and stately column to be erected, wherein she caused also these words
to be insculped and inserted. Ego sum Isis Egipti Regina, a Mercurio erudita.
Que ego legibus statui, nullus soluet: ego sum Osyrides, ego sum prima frugum
inventrix, ego sum Oriregis matter. But to omit many other like authorities and
approvements which might conduce to the clearer manifesting and unclouding of
what was first proposed, we will now go forward with this royal marriage of
Iasius, that we with more speed may attain to the complete accomplishment and
effectuating of my purposed entendment.

This great king and ruler Iasius Ianigena had of this his wife Cibeles a son
called Corybantus, so that now there wanted not any terrene or earth-born
delight or felicity which might make this happie-seeming potentate more
fortunat, mighty, or contentfull, but it is a common humor of fortune, that
amidst the thickest and most abundances of her graces and favors, she in some
angry or fantastic imagination, suddenly snatcheth away her so liberally
bestowed gifts, and leaves the late possessors thereof involved and wrapped in a
world of the miserablest unhappiness and soul vexations that may be invented,
as by the fatal success and end of this kings life most plainly appears.
For when as Dardanus, his younger brother (a man indeed of a proud heart, great
courage, and inward ambition) saw his brother Iasius thus to float (as it were)
on the calm seas of joyous prosperity, and to taste of the sweet cup of
Nectar, which Fortune oftentimes administreth unto her favorites, and thus to
live famous in such abundant measure of grace and happiness; he infinitely
repined and malliciously stomacked such the greatness and height of his power
and authority, he being himself so suppressed and obscured by the spite of
Fortune, and living privately and without command, as an inferior or some
base born person or slave. These things oftentimes revolving and studying
within himself, he could not now any longer depresse or quench the overfurious
heat of his aspiring spirit, but in a disdainefull and scorning kind of fashion
went unto his brother the king, to demand leave and license, That (upon some
occasions of discontent pretended) he might depart out of the country to seek
out his better fortunes: which request Iasius refused to condescend unto, and
would by no means allow of his brothers purposes in that behalf intended:
whereupon Dardanus (taking it in great dislike and disparagement unto his
greatness) began secretly to enter into deadly hostility with him, and to
gather many factions and parties together on his side, which, by reason that he
was exceedingly well beloved throughout most of those countries, grew to a
great number and multitude of men, especially of those people then inhabiting
on the other side of the river Tybre, which we called since the Latins,
besides the country of Naples, Povilla, Calabria, and others thereabouts; all
these conjoined and consorted with the faction of Dardanus: and with Iasius,
all those on this side of Tybre, being them of Tuscania, France, and other
particular provinces thereabouts. At this very time (as many writers do
deliver) happened in the world many uncouth, strange, and wonderful portents,
as fearful earthquakes, lightening, blazing comets, and ougly visions; as
also throughout all Thessalie a general overflow and deluge of waters, in
another part of Greece, a strange combustion of houses and towns, and
miserable effects of fire throughout most part of that country. In the same
time also, Pharao king of Egypt following Moses and the children of Israel
through the red sea, with all his army perished and were overwhelmed with the
churlish buffetings of the angry and wrathful billows. All which signs and
extraordinary accidents did manifestly pretoken and prefigure the sudden
approach of some great alteration of estates, and troubles of mighty kingdoms.

The fire of discontent and enmity between the two brothers being thus
wholly set on flame, and diverse attempts and meetings of wrath passed between
them, it happened that Dardanus received the worst, and upon many encounters
still was put unto his shifts, especially by the fresh supply and aid which
Siceleus, king of the isle of Sicilia, and the sixteenth king of Spain had then
brought unto his brother Iasius: so that continually being weakened more and
more both in numbers of men, and in the courages of them that stayed, he was
enforced for his own security to give over those such public means of
oppression and revenge, and to betake his thoughts unto contriving and plotting
of some more inward and therefore more dangerous stratagems. So that in the
end (to avoid prolixitie and tedious circumstance) he so wrought that he
awaited a time when the king his brother (then all suspectlesse of any intended
mischief) went privately to a fountain or spring to wash himself, which
occasion and opportunity so fairly presenting it self, Dardanus most
traitorously and vilely murdered him. And upon that, not daring to adventure
his stay, or to engage himself so far in those cases of peril, he presently
took shipping in the next haven, and with all his jewels and what else riches
portable, he could carry with him away, with many of his friends, followers, and
servitors, he secretly and closely set sail and departed.

The right noble and trespuissant king of France thus cruelly murdered by the
bloody hands of his own natural (though in that unnatural) brother, in the
fiftith year of his reign and mighty government, and in the fourscore and
fourth year of his own age; all the people and inhabitants thereabouts began
mightily to bewail his untimely and miserable end, which was before the
foundation of Troy eight and twenty years or much thereabouts. In general
deploration and laments of this kings death, not only Italy and France, but all
parts of the world unto whom the shrill voiced trumpet of Fame had sounded
forth this report, conjoined and bemoned together, for that he kept peace and
amity with all princes whatsoever, in all unity, love, and concord; and
carried himself so upright and so wise in the troublesome managing of affairs
belonging unto two kingdoms, that he gained and won unto him the hearts and
affections of almost all people whatsoever. After his death, his son
Coribantus succeeded in the government of the kingdom of Italy, but not of
France, so that the people thereof were a good while after without a chief or
ruler: but in the end they chose and elected one that was nearest unto the
lineage and line of Hercules as they might, and his name was Allobrox, now the
sixteenth king thereof. The which king afterward for the most part kept and
remained at the foot of the mountains Apennini, afronting upon Italy, and
there commanded even unto the hills Pyrenei (which divide the country of
Spain from France) and from the Mediterranean sea unto the maine Ocean, and
unto the river of Rhyne: and he there builded and erected many famous towns
and cities, of which, some were those which were since called Piemont, Savoy,
Proavnce, Daulphine, and others, and which people of very late times (if not at
this day) were called Allobroges: and in this kings reign was the farre-famed
and mighty city of Troy first built and erected. To come unto the foundation
of which, we must here in these affairs pause and take breath a while, and
return unto Dardanus, now on the sea tossed with uncertain fortunes, and
tempest-beaten indeed with overblowing and cruel winds, so that he remained in
very great danger and hazard to be cast away and swallowed in the vast and
merciless embracements of the all-wracking waters. Enforced by these
calamities, he was glad to put in at an Island of the Ciclades, attending
there the favorable smiles of Fortune, and the abatement of those horrible and
tempestuous storms. In the end he put forth again, and recovered the sea
Archipelagus, and went afterward on shore in an Island in Greece called Samos
or Samothrace, according to that which the Poet Virgil in his eight book of
his Aeneidos says: Arunculos, ita far senec his ortus in agris, Dardanus
Ideas frigiae penetravit ad urbes, Treiciamque Samum quae nunc Samothracia
fertur. This Island of Samos or Samothracia, is directly opposite unto the
country of Thrace in Greece where Constantinople is erected, which heretofore
abounded in all plenteous manner with Vines, Olive trees, Grapes, and others
such like fruit of most sorts; and in this country also was the learned and
famous Philosopher Pythagoras borne, and one of the prophetesses called Sibeles
Sameos: but it is now (the more to be lamented) in the tyrannous hands and
possessions of the bloody and barbarous Turk. In this country, Dardanus
stayed a good space before he laid the foundation of Troy, hoping yet to be
recalled home again into Italy: but when he perceived that all hopes were
frustrate that were builded on such grounds, he puts himself forth to
seek out as yet his further fortunes, which happened as hereafter shall
breefely be unfolded.

It is to be understood, that on the other side of the sea Hell sponte, which
is called also the streights leading unto Constantinople, in the firm
continent of a country called Asia Minor, now called Natalia or Turkey, and
not far from the above written Island of Samos, is a province called Lydia,
which heretofore was called also Meonia; in the which country, as also in
those next and near adjoining thereunto called Phrygia, reigned and governed
at that time a prince called by the name of Athus the younger, of the same
blood and parentage as was Dardanus for (if it be remembered) we long since
spoke how Hercules of Lybia had a lady to his wife called Omphale, by whom he
begat a son called Athus the great, of which Athus, from descent to descent
in four generations came this Athus the younger king of Meonia and Phrygia,
and who had two sons also, the one called by the name of Lydus, the other
Tur^henus. This king Athus having now upon the arrival of Dardanus, great
abundance of people in his country, by reason of fruitful increases and
multiplications: and having also but small store of victuals and food in his
country to nourish and maintain so populous a state, for want of which, great
famines, pestilences, and other diseases arose in the country, knew not almost
how to dispose of his people, or in what sort to remedy this mischief, so
that in the end he was enforced by reason of that mortal famine, to discharge
many of his subjects out of the country to seek out some new inhabitations
and places of abode: which thing also they wondrous willingly embraced as glad
to be rid and quit of so penurious and starving a place. Dardanus hearing and
understanding of these proceedings, and in what necessities they stood in by
means of the overaboundance of inhabitants, presently made his repair to king
Athus, and there desired of him, That since he must needs send forth such
people for the finding out of new places of habitations, that he would bestow
the charge, conduct, and leading of them upon him, and that he would join
with them for the provisions and necessaries needful and convenient for the
settling of themselves in such their new places of abode, residence, and
habitation. This thing king Athus very willingly entertained, especially, for
that Dardanus was of his own kindred and consanguinitie. This request and
desire of Dardanus thus obtained, he knew no other means to requite so great
a favor, and to be occasion to draw on further kindnesses, but to offer unto
Athus, and utterly to resign all his right, title, interrest, and claim in
the kingdom of Italy for one of his sons, unto which of them the father
pleased and was contented. This profer of Dardanus being well considered of by
king Athus, was in the end thankefully accepted: in lieu and exchange whereof
was allowed unto Dardanus a certain quantity and piece of ground in Phrygia
for him to build and erect a city upon. And between the two brethren, Lydus
and Turrhenus, lots were indifferently cast, which of them with a certain
number of people should set forward for Italy, and which should stay at home:
for the deciding whereof, it fell unto Lydus to remain behind, and to be left
inheritor unto that kingdom which afterward of his name was called Lydia; and
that Turrhenus should be presently dispatched away with his people to inhabit
in Italy, of whom afterward also it was called by the name of Turrhena.
These covenants and agreements concluded upon, Turrhenus sets forward from
Asia Minor (now called Turkey) in his journey for Italy; and Dardanus with his
people and associats began now to build in Phrygia, and in short space fully
finished and erected a city, which he called after his own name Dardania:
which was before the incarnation of Christ a thousand four hundred fourscore
and seven years, before the building of Rome by Romulus four hundred and
seven and twenty years, and before the city of Paris was erected threescore
and ten years, as Eusebius and most writers do affirm. On the other side
Turrhenus is arrived in Italy, and presently repaireth unto the queen
Cibeles, the widow and late wife to Iasius Ianigena, as before has been
declared, as also unto her son Coribantus king of Tuscania; unto which two,
he brought and presented many costly and rich gifts from his father Athus king
of Meonia: who also received them in all gracious and kind acceptance, as
coming from their kinsman, and of the race and blood of Hercules of Lybia.
Turrhenus had not long remained here, but that he was highly favored of the
king Coribantus, who now desirous to see and understand of the estate of his
kinsman Dardanus, prepared presently to take in hand that so long and tedious
journey, and ordained and instituted at home for the government of his
country, the order of the twelve Dukes, whereof Turrhenus was one; and so with
a great troop and company of followers and friends he embarked for the cost
of Phrygia, to see the greatness of Dardanus, and the beauty and excellency
of his new built city Dardania. After some tedious and troublesome travels in
this voyage, at the last he arrived at his wished and desired place, where
with all manner of ceremony he was joyfully entertained by Dardanus, whose
reciprocal and mutual love grew in the end to be such, as he resolved and
there set down his rest for ever to remain, and not to return again into
Italy, but sent word thither of his purposes, and commanding them to create
and establish Turrhenus in his absence king and sole ruler over all that
country. In few years Dardanus began to grow unto great mightiness, riches,
and power, who had also a neighbor prince, of mighty puissance, wealthy, and
fortunate, whose name was Te^^rus, whereupon many writers call the Phrygians
also Teucri; and this Teucrus was the son of Scamander and Idea, and had also
himself a very beautiful and fair daughter, which he married shortly after
unto Dardanus, and was called Batea, of whom Dardanus begot a son called
E^icthonius, who succeeded after him and was inheritour unto the kingdom of
Phrygia. This Ericthonius in process of time arose up unto a wonderful
greatness and large possessions, who (as many writers do affirm) was
accounted to be one of the richest kings in those days in that part of the
world, who (as it is also said) had at the least three thousand horses of his
own continually feeding in his pastures. And this Ericthonius had also a son
whom he named Tros, whom after his death he left as successor and inheritour
unto him, and of whose name afterward the Dardanians were called Trojans. This
Tros very much obliged and beautified the city also of Dardania, (...); which
long time after it retained (...) had three sons, which were, Ilus,
Assaracus, (...) he brought up in the knowledge (...) warlicke sciences, unto
which kind of study (as it is written) he himself also was much addicted,
and had many years together maintained hostile wars with the king of Crete
called Jupiter, the fourth of that name there: in which wars, his son
Ganimedes was taken prisoner even by the hands of Jupiter himself, who for
that in his ensign and colors he gave an Eagle, (being his arms) it should
seem the Poets for that cause have devised and feign (...) as he was on
hunting was snatched up from the (...) unto heaven by Jupiter, (...) Eagle, find
that he is now taken for one of the twelve signs of the Zodiake called
Aquarius. Some other authors also write, that one Tantalus, king of high
Phrygia and of Paphlagonia, a most miserable, covetous and auaricious prince,
had laid certain sna^es and privy means to entrap this Ganimedes and to take
him prisoner as he used to sport himself in hunting, thinking by that devise
to get a mighty ransom of his father Tros for the redeeming and
enfranchising of his imprisoned and captivated son, and that this Tantalus
sent him to one Jupiter of the Isle of Crete, for to safeguard him, and to have
half the ransom which should be paid for his redeliverie and freedom. And
for such like causes belike, the Poets also do invent and say, that Tantalus
is plagued and tormented in hell, standing up to the chin in water, and apples
hanging down unto his lips, and yet can neither drink nor taste the one or the
other; and it is also more credibly written, that he died most miserably and in
great extremity. His son Pelops also, banished and exiled his own natural
country, fled into Greece, and there married a wonderful rich wife and great
lady, by which means he got unto himself and obtained the command of a
whole country, which he called after his own name Peloponnesus, which is now
the country of Mauritania, and subject unto the Empire of the Turk. And of
this Pelops issued and came the two famous captains, Agamemnon and Menelaus.
Tros thus having lost his son on this fashion, studied upon revenge, and in
the mean times comforted himself with his two other sons, Ilus and
Assaracus. And this Ilus called Troy after that, Ilion; who begat a son named
Laomedon, the father of the renowned Priamus: and of Assaracus issued and came
Anchises, Aeneas father. And the before written Tros ruled and commanded there
in great power and puissance for the space of threescore years or near
thereabouts, Archilochus.
as Archilochus in his book of Times alloadgeth.

Laomedon, the son of king Ilus (as is beforesaid) after the death of his
father took upon him the rule and government of Troy, in the two hundred and
two and twentieth year after the first foundation thereof by Dardanus, and he
had five sons and two daughters, which were these, Priamus, Titonus, Lampus,
Clytion, and Letaon, and of these Homer in his Iliads makes further mention:
his daughters were Antigone and Hesione. Homer.
The Greek Poets (who indeed for the most part are full of such like fables)
do say, that the two gods Neptune and Apollo, for a certain sum of money
promised them by him, went with him about the circuit of the city, and there
erected wonderful strong and most huge high walls round about the same: the
which walls afterward finished accordingly, and no money received nor to be
got, Apollo in great rage and anger infected the city with a deadly and
general pestilence; and Neptune in token of his wrath and displeasure also,
sent a monster of the sea among them, unto which, they must every day give and
throw a young child, or else that they all should perish and be devoured by the
ravenous maw and hunger thereof; and that in the end it happened upon the
daughter of Laomedon (called Hesione) to be given unto this marine beast, which
(say they) was rescued and releeved by great fortune by Hercules of Greece,
which came that way, and who afterward slew that monster, and in gratification
thereof the lady Hesione (the daughter of Laomedon) was promised unto him not
long after in marriage, but yet not married unto him by reason of the
unwillingnesse afterward (howsoever it fell out) of her father: for the breach
of which promise, Hercules afterward slew Laomedon in open battle, and
spoiled and ruinated such his glorious city. And for that Thelamon his consort
had that day behaved himself very valiantly in fight, he bestowed the young
lady Hesione upon him, as his concubine and slave; who carried her away with
him into the country of Solamina, whereof he was then king and ruler. But it
is most certain, that for the most part all those Greek writers have erred
infinitely and have delivered many most unlikely hystories: for this Hercules
(as has been before spoken) was a notable and a famous pyrate; and he slew
Laomedon by treachery, and surprised Troy on a sudden and unawares, and also
he was a common ravisher of maidens, as of Hesione, Medea, and others, as
Manethon, Johannes Annius, and Iacques de Bergame have written and very
plainly approved the same. Laomedon being slain, Titonus succeeded next
after him: but he being of another disposition, resigned his interrest therein,
and betook himself to travel into strange countries, even unto the Indies,
where (according to Diodorus Siculus) he married a lady called Ida, and (as
the Poets write) Aurora: of whom, he afterward had a son called Memnon,
who long after came unto the succor of Priamus in his cheifest wars, and was
there slain by the hands of Achilles. In the absence therefore of his brother
Tython, Priamus took upon him the government and charge of that kingdom, being
the second son unto Laomedon their father: who in short time came to be one of
the greatest and most famous princes of the world, for it is written, that he
was wondrous wise, discreet, and valiant, and matched his children with persons
of great sort, worth, and dignity. And for to make him at the first the
stronger, and that he might have time to reedifie his late spoiled and fire
perished city, he entered into alliance and fast kindred with a very mighty
and powerful prince, near adjoining upon his country, who was called by the
name of Cypseus, or (as some hold) Dymas, king and sole commander of Thrace,
which is a province in Greece on this side of the sea Hellespont, whereof the
chief city is at this day Constantinople: and with this Cypseus or Dymas his
daughter, called Hecuba, he married: a lady accomplished with all exterior
graces and inward virtuous dispositions, at which espousals of Priamus and
Hecuba, great ceremonies and signs of joyfulnesse were shown forth and
observed: and of this lady it is writ, that he begot nineteen children male
and female: and of other women and concubines which he daily kept and
maintained in his palace (according to the fashions and usances in those
days) he had one and thi^tie more, so that only nineteen of his fifty
sons and daughters were legitimate and lawfully begotten, the rest bastards
and illegitimate. That Priamus in all had so many children (which indeed he
publickely maintained and shamed not to acknowledge) Virgil also in the second
book of his Aeneidos thus says: Quinquaginta illi thalami, spes tanta
nepotum. And Homer likewise in the last book of his Iliads most plainly
seems to confirm the same.

Troy now thus most gallantly flourishing, newly fortified, repaired enlarged,
enriched, enpeopled, and thoroughly provided and stored of all manner of things
which might be necessary either for the use of fatal wars and open
hostillities, or for the conservation of peace and domesticke tranquillity,
began to assume unto her self a mighty and glorious self-conceit and strong
opinion of her own power, height, and magnificence, assuring her self of all
victorious prevailements over her enemies whatsoever, and of a never failing
prosperity, glory, and felicity: and yet it is not writ, that Priamus
himself was puffed up with any more extraordinary pride or insolency than
became the greatness of so puissant a prince. It is writ also, that in the
times of this his greatest power, he was forewarned by certain Oracles and
false gods which they used to worship in those days, that so long as he did
preserve and safeguard three things belonging unto the city, the town should
be inexpugnable and never to be lost, as Servius and Boccace have written of
the same; the things were these, The image of Pallas called Paladium, preserved
undefaced, The sepulcher or tomb of Laomedon which was under the great gate
Scea, kept undespoiled and whole, and so long as the life of Troylus lasted and
did endure. Priamus therefore very careful to keep these three things with all
diligentnesse and heed, lived in the greatest pomp, delicacie, and state that
ever any prince in the world in those times did or could: so that he seemed not
only to be king of Phrygia, but also chief dominator and emperor of all
Asia, now called Natalia or Turkey: and he was called also in those times, The
king of kings, as Strabo in the thirteenth book of his Geographie, to the same
purpose thus says: Priamus magno ex parvo, and Rex Regum effectus. And these
his powers and authorities not only extended and stretched themselves abroad
throughout the maine continent and firm lands of all those countries
thereabout round, but in the end showed themselves also and possessed their
master of many famous and great Islands lying far in within the bosom and
embracement of the uncivile and rude behaviored sea; as the Island of Tenedos,
and the Island of Metelyn, were subject and vassalized unto the government of
his imperious principallitie, paying him yearly tributes, taxes, and
impositions; and many others also of great same adjoining near thereabout: so
that the infinite greatness and large command of this thrice mighty emperor
Priamus, possessed all the princes and rulers of countries near that way, with
astonished admiration and wondrous maze of his so sudden and unexpected
puissancie. And thereupon sent and dispatched messengers from all quarters to
crave his amity, friendship, and to be in league with him, as also to be
nearer allied unto him in some matches and marriages of their children on both
sides; by reason whereof, Priamus matched his children with great houses, and
of great power and possessions. First he married one of his legitimate and
lawfully begotten daughters called Creusa, unto a prince of great means named
Aeneas, the son of old Anchises: his daughter Astyoche, he matched with one
Telephus, a mighty king of Mysia: and his son Hector joined in matrimony
with Andromacha, the fair daughter of Ection, the powerful and famous king of
Thebes and Silicia: and Polydamas, one of the sons of Anthenor, married with
one of Priamus daughters, (being a bastard, and begotten of one of his
concubines) being of an excellent and singular beauty, called Lycasta. So
also many others of his children were linked and joined in marriages with men
of great rule, power, and command in those days; the posterity of which, and
of their deeds and mightiness, hereafter in some other place and opportunity,
occasion may be presented further to speak of, And for this time (being
indeed forced by an extraordinary occasion) I must thus on the sudden
abruptly break of; desiring and wishing very earnestly, that if this small
piece of pains of mine shall fortune ever to be publickely impressed (which
leaving behind me, it will not be in my power to prevent) it may
indifferently pass uncensured, till the return of his fortune beaten father
may answer for the innocence of the child, and be able a little better to
protect him in his afflictions.

And thus it has been with great care and diligence labored to find out the
truest Hystorians for the deriving of Dardanus, and consequently this king
Priamus, from the race and line of the first prince and Patriarch Noe, with the
particular successions of kings and emperors of Europe, as has been
warranted by the authorities and writings of very learned and authenticke
authors.
