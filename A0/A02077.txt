To the Right Honorable and Virtuous Lady, the Lady Mary Tol^^t, wi^e to the
right Honorable, Gilbert, Lord Talbot: Robert Green, wishes increase of
Honor and Virtue.
MYRON, that unskillful Painter of Greece, never drew any picture, but the
counterfeit of Jupiter: saying, that if it were ill wrought, his worthiness
should countenance out the meannesse of his work^, if well, commend the
per^ection of his Art.

In like manner fares it with me ( right Honorable) who ha^ing unskillfully
shadowed wi^h bad colors, the counterfeit of Fortune, presume boldly to
shrowde it under your Ladyships patronage, as able to defend it, be it never so
mean, and to countenance it, were it never so good. Thus hopeful of your
Ladyships acceptance, I remain,

The unfeigned honourer, and admirer of your Noble perfections, Robert Green.

To the Gentlemen Readers, health.
ALexander, whether wearied with Bu^^phalu^ pace, or de^^rous of nouel^^es, as
^he nature of man delights in change, rode on a time on (...) horse, for
which being reprehended by one of his Captains, he made hi^ this answer:
Though all (quoth he) cannot have Bucephalus cairi^ge, yet this is his horse.

So ^entlemen, if some too C^rious (...) at your courtesy, that vouchsafe to
take a view of this Pamp^let, I hope you will answer: Though it be not
excellent, yet it is a ^ooke.

Yours for a greater cu^^^sie, Robert Green.

THE HISTORY of Arbasto, with the Anatomy of Fortune. CHAP. 1. Arbasto is
discovered in his retired life by the Traueller^
AFter an untoward journey and several unfortunate tempests, besides the
unskillfulness of our Pil^te, I happily arrived at the City of Sydon, where
being set on shore, I straight with my companions went to offer incense to the
goddess of Prosperity, which the Citizens call Araste. ^^^hither being come,
my devotion done, and my oblations presented, desired to take a view of the
ancient Monuments of the Temple, I passed through many places, where most
sumptuous sepulchers were erected: which having seen, as I thought to have
gone to my lodging, I spied a Cell, having the door open: whereinto as I
entered, I saw an Archslamin sitting (as I supposed) at his Orizons, for so was
the Priest of the goddess termed, who being cloth^d in white Satin Robes, and
crowned with a Diadem of perfect gold, leaned his head upon his right hand,
pouring forth streams o^ tears, as outward signs of some inward pas^^ons,
and held in his le^t hand the counterfeit of Fortune, which with one foot
trod upon a Pol^pe (...), and with the other on a Camelion, as assured ba^^i^^
her mutabilitie. Driven into a dumpe with the si^ht o^ this strange de^i^^, as
I long gazed at the vnacquainte^ gesture of this live Fl^min, willing to know
both the cause of his care, and what the picture of fortune did import, I was
so bold to wake him out of ^is passion, with this parle.

Father (quoth I) if my presump^ion be great in preasing ^o rashly into so
secret and sacred a place tha^ I hope, weighing my will, you will somewhat
excuse my boldnes^ for I have not presumed as thinking to give any just
occasion of offense, but as a stranger, desirous to see the Monuments of this
ancient Temple, which (...) I ^arrowly viewed, happ^ning by chanc^ into this
your Cell, an^ seeing your old age p^rplexed with ^trange passion^, stated as
one willing to learn what disaster has driven you into these dumps, which if I
w^^hout off^nce may request, and yo^ without prejudice grant, I shall find my
self by duty bound to requite your undeserved curtes^e.

After I had uttered these words, staying a good space to hear what the ^lde
man would answer, seeing h^e did not so much as vo^chsafe to give an ear to
my par^e, or an eye to my person, but still gazed on the picture of Fortune. I
saw a present Metamorphosis of his actions: for from tears he fell to
tr^fl^ng, from lowering to laughing, from mourning to mirth, yet never casting
his eyes from Fortunes counterfeit, till at last after he had long smiled (as
I thought) at the pi^^ure, he as in desp^te cast it from (...) and taking his
Lute, played a dumpe, whereto he warble^ ou^ ^^ese word^: VVHereat erewhile I
wept, I laugh,
That which I feared, I now despise
My victor onc^, my vassaile is,
My foe constr^ind, my weal supplies.
Thus do I triumph on my foe,
I weep at weal, I laugh at wo^.
M^ care i^ cu^'d, yet has no end,
Not that I want, but that I hau^^
My change wa^ change, yet still ^ end^
I would have less, if you me (...)
Aye me poor wretch (...) d^e live,
Constraind to ta^e, y wish^d to gi^^.
She^ whose delights a^e signs of death,
Who when she smi^^s, begins t^ lowre^
Constant in this, th^^ ^till she change,
Her sweetest gif^s time proue^ but sowre^
I live in care^ frost with her guile,
Through (...) I weep, at her I smile.


The grave Priest having with sig^^s sobbed out this sorrowful ditty, I was
driven into a maze what the contrary content^ of these verses should mean,
until at last casting hi^ eye asid^, and seeing me stand so solemnly, ^e
burst forth unto these cholerick^ terms.

Friend, quoth he (if I may so term thee) thou have either not hear^ much, or
learned very little, either thy courtesy is small, or thy conditions too
currish, that seek to come to counsel before thou be called^ If the secrecy
of my Cell, or the reuer^nce of my age, or thy small acquaintance with me, were
not sufficient to hold thee from pressing so nigh: yet seeing me thus
perplexed, thou might (for modesty sake have left me to my secret and
sorrowful passions. If it be the custom of thy Country to be so discourteous^
I like not the fruit of such a soil: If thy own folly to be thus rash, I
crave not to be acquainted with such a bold guest: but whether it be or no, as
thou came in without my leave, I wish the^ to go out by just command.

He had no sooner uttered these words, but he was ready to take up the
picture, if I had not hindered him with this reply.

Sir where the offense is confessed, there the fault is half pardoned, and
those fac^s that are committed by ignorance, always claim remission by
course: I grant that I have been much too rash, but I repent, and therefor
hope you will take the less offense, and the sooner excuse my folly: faults
committed by will, gain often times but a che^^^, then mine done by ignorance,
shall I hope escape without a mate. Penalties are enjoined by the intent more
then by the work, and things done amiss (says Tully) ever ought to be
measured by the passion, a^^ not by the mere action. Which considered, if my
presence has been pr^^^diciall to your reposenesse, I hope you will think I
offend (...) stranger, and will pardon me, as one sorry for so rash an
ent^^^rise.

The old man very a^^entiuel^ hearing my talk, having somewhat digested his
cholar, rising up from his seat, made me this friendly answer.

Friend ^^uoth he) It is not gold that glisters, the smoothest talk^ has often
times the smallest truth, the Sun when it glistereth mo^^ bright, br^ueth the
greatest shower. The Painter casts the fairest c^lour over the soulest board,
and strangers flatterings ar^ often times but mee^^ deceits: yet whether thy
talk be truth o^ tales, whether thou come to note my passions as a spy, or
have by chance ^it into my C^ll as a stranger, I care not: for if thou envy me
as a foe, I fear not the spite of Fortune: if thou muse at my sudden motions,
it shall little avail thee to hear it, and be a great grief for me to
re^earse it.

O sir (quoth I) if my credit might be such as without desert to obtain so
much favor, or if the prayer of a poor stranger might pr^^aile to persuade
you to unfold the cause of these your sudden passions, I should think my former
travels counteruailed wi^h this your friendly courtesy.

It is good indeed (quoth he) by other men's harms to learn to beware: Phoe^us
had never been so wa^y of Vulcane, if Mars his mish^p had not bid him take
heed: Ulysses had not so wisely eschewed Circes charms, if he had not seen^
before his fellows transformed, and perhaps the hearing of my former cares may
free thee from ensuing calamity.

I have been my self a Prince, which am now subject unto power: alate a
mighty Potentat^, and now constrained to live under a seruil^ law: not
contented erewhile with a kingly Palac^, now sufficiently satisfied with a
poor Cell, and yet this present want exceeds my wonted weal. I then had too
much in penury, and now I lack in superstuitie, being cloyed with abundance,
yet having nothing, in that my mind remains unsatisfied. Fortune, yea
Fortune in favoring me, has made me most unfortunate. Syren-like hiding under
music misery, under pleasure paine^ under mirth mourning, like the su^^ed
^onicombe, which while a man touches he is stung wit^ ^^es: She^ presents
fair shapes, which prove but fading shadows, she proferr^th mountains, and
perhaps keeps promise, but the gains of these golden Mines is loss and
misery. Non^ ro^e on Seianus horse, which got not mishap. None touched the gold
o^ Tholossa, whom some ^isaster did not assail: neither has any bee^^
^^^ayn^ed by fortune, which in time has not been crossed with some hapless
calamity. I speak this by experience, which I (...) the Gods thou never try
by proof: for he only is to be thought ^^ppy, whom the inconstant favor of
Fortune has not made vnh^^py. The Pict^re which thou see here, is the
perfect counter^^i^^ of her inconstant conditions, for she like to the Polype
Fish, ^^^neth her self into ^^ery object, and with the Came^ion takes her
whole delight in change, being sure in nothing but in this, that she is not
sure at all. Which inconstancy after I had known by too much proof, I began to
arm myself against her guiles, and to count her f^^ning flatt^ry, and her
fro^nes of no force, not to accept her as a friend, but to despise her as a
foe, and in despite of her fained deity, to oppose my self against her fickle
power, which I have found the greatest shield to shrowde me from her secret
injuries. I have left my Palace, and taken me a simple Cell, in the one I found
often displeasure, but in the other never but contentation. From a Prince of
the earth, I am become a Priest to the Gods, seeking only by this obscure life
to please my self, and displease Fortune: whose picture when I see, I weep,
that I was so fond, as to be subject to such a servile Dame, and I laugh, that
at last I triumph both over mine own affections, and over Fortune. Thus friend,
since thou have heard the cause of my care, cease off to enquire farther in the
case, pass from my Cell, and leave me to my passions, for to procure my
grief, and not my gain, were to offer me double loss. After he had uttered
these words, perceiving by his par^e that he was a Prince, I began with more
reverence to excuse my rashness, framing my talk to this effect.

I am sorry (quoth I) if sorrow might be a mends for that which is amiss, that
my ha^ty folly has offended your highness: and that my poor pres^nce has
been prejudicial to your princely passions, but since the fault once
committed may be repented, but not reclaimed, I hope your highness will
pardon my unwitting wilfulness, and take, Had I wi^^, for an excuse of so
sudden an offense, which granted, the desire I have to hear of your strange
hap, does make me, pass manners, in being importunate with your Majesty, to
hear the tragical chance of this your strange change. Well (quoth he) since
thy desire is such, and time allows me convenient leisur^, sit down, and thou
shall hear what trust there is to be given (...) incons^^^^ Fortun^.

CHAP. 2. Ar^as^^ re^^^^th his story and discovers himself.
Until I waxt w^ary of m^ di^deme, I was king of the famous Country of
Denma^ke, wh^rin, after Bosphorus deceased, (for so was my father called) I
(...) in happy prosperi^y, coming to the Crown at the age of one and ^^entie
years, being so honored of my subjects for my virtue, and so loved for my
courtesy, as I did not only gain the hearts of them, but also wan the good
will of strange^^. I could not complain (...) lack, in that my greatest want
was store I f^ared not the force of f^rrain foe^, for I knew none but were my
faithful friends, I doubt^^ no misfortune, for I could see n^ way for me to
mishap: nay, if ^ had been wise, I might the more ^aue f^ared misery, in that I
was so fully pampered up with felicity. But I p^ore wr^tch was not daunted with
any dread, because I saw no present danger: I thought the sea being calm,
there could come no tempest: that from the clear air could ensue no storm,
that quiet ease was not the mother of dissension, and that where Fortune once
tuned, in the strings could never be found any discord.

But O fond and unfortunate Arbasto (for so I may be called:) thou now have
tried, though by hapless experience, that when Nilu^ fills up his bounds,
ensues a dearth: when the Ang^lica is laden with most s^ed, then he dies:
when music was heard in the capitol, then the Romans were plagued with
pestilence: when Circ^s proferred most gifts, she present^d most guile, and
when Fortune has deprived thee of most care, then she means to drown thee in
the greatest calamity. For as thus I safely floated in the seas of security,
and bathed in the ^treames of bliss, Fortune, thinking at length to give me
the mate, began thus to profer the che^ke. I had but one only brother called
T^baldo, whom forced by nature, I most entirely loved and liked, who soi^urned
in France, as one desirous to see the manners of strange Countries, and to
furnish himself with all qualities fit for a worthy Gentleman. But on a sudden
I happily received news, that he was cowardly without cause slain in the
Court, which so appaled me, as nature most cruelly exclaim^d against fortune,
in so much, that contrary to the counsel of my Nobles, with a resolute mind^.
I determined to invade France, and either to bring the whole Realm to ruin,
in revenge, or else to hazard life and limme in the battle: well, no persuasion
being able to drive me from this s^^led determination, I caused my ships to be
rigged, and with as m^^h speed as might be, sailed into France with a great
Navy, where I had n^ sooner la^ded my soldiers, but as a professed foe,
craving no other r^cempence for my brothers death but their de^truction. I
(...) their borde^s, fired their forts, rased their Towns and ^^ties to the
earth, using no mercy but thi^, that having deprived them of their possessions,
I also bereaved them o^ their lives. Pelorus hearing with what violence I had
invaded his land (for so the F^^nch king was called) fearing that he was not
able to withstand my fo^ce, seeing that Fortune so favored my enterprise,
passed spe^dily with his whole host unto Orleance, whither I ^asted being not
greatly resisted, laying valiantly a strong slege to the City, which after I
had diverse times assaulted, and so shaken the walls with Camion shot, that
they were force to streng^hen them with n^w cou^term^^es, Pelorus half daunted
with my desperate attempts, coueted secretly to conclude a peace: to colo^^
therefore this his intent with a false shadow, he speedily dispatched (...)
Herald, to entreat a truce for three mon^ths, which being vnhappi^^ granted,
and therefore unhappily because granted, it was lawful for them of Denmark
peaceably to pass into the City, and for them of Orleance quietly to come
into our Camp. While thus the truc^ continued^ I being desirous to take a view
of the French Court, accompanied with my Nobles, went to Pelorus, who willing
to show hi^ martial courage by using courtesy to his foe, gave me very
sumptu^u^ and courteous entertainment. But alas such mischief ensued of this
my fond desire, that death had been thrice more welcome then such distress.
For Pelorus had only two daughters, the eldest called Myrania, the youngest
named Doralicia, so fair and well featured, as Venus would have been jealous
if Adonis had lived to see their beauties. But especially lo^ely Doralicia, and
therefore more lovely, because I so entirely loved her: For she was so
beautified with the gifts of nature, and adorned with more then earthly
perfection, a^ she seemed to be framed by nature to blemish nature, and that
beauty had skipt beyond her skill, in framing a piece of such curious
workmanship, for that which in her (respecting her other perfections) wa^ of
no price, would be counted in others a pearl, her greatest want would in
others be thought a store, so that if any thing lacked in her, it was not to be
sought for in any earthly creature. This Doral^cia being appointed by unjust
Fortune to be the instrument of my fall, accompanied with her sister Myrania
and other Ladies, came into the Chamber where he^ father and I was at parl^,
whose gorgious presence so appaled by s^^ses, that I stood a^tonished, as if
with Perseus shi^ld I had been m^^e a senseless pi^ture. For as the Dormous^
cannot shut her eyes as long as he lies in the beams of the Sun, as the
D^ere cannot c^^s^ them braying where the ^earbe M^ly grows, so could not I
but stare on the face of Doralicia, a^ long as her beauty was such an heavenly
object. She narrowl^ marking my gazing ^ookes, (...) ^erceiued that I was
gal^ed, and therefore to show how lightly she accounted of my liking^ passed
out of the Chamber with a coy and Courtly countena^^^, but Myrani^ as one
perceiving and pitty^ng my passions, seemed with her looks to say in heart^
A^basto, farewell.

These two Goddesses being gone, f^^ling my mind somwh^t perplexed, I took my
leave of Peloru^, and departed. Coming home to my Tent, ^raught with a
thousand toyish fancies, I began to c^^iecture what should be the cause of
these contrary motions, the ^^^ect I felt, the occasion ^ could not find,
applying therefore a contrary ^alue to my sore, it did rather increase, than
cure the m^ladie, for company was a corras^ue, not a comfort: and to be
solitary, the ^inke of all sorrow: ^or then strange thoughts, v^acquaint^d
passions, pinching fancies, waking visions, and slumbring watchings, disquieted
my head. Me thought I saw the counterfeit o^ Doralicia before mine eyes, then
the harmony of her speech sounded in mine ears: her look^, her gestures, ye^,
all her action^ were particularly deciphered by a secr^t imaginati^n. Wrapped
thus in a labyrinth of endless fancies, when reason could not suppres^^ will,
nor wisdom control affection^ I cast my cards, and found by manifest proof,
that the lunaticke fit which so distempered my brains, was that frantic
passion which fools ^ Poets call loue^ which know^e, blaming my self of
cowardice, y^ beauty should make me bend, I f^l at last into these terms.

Why A^basto, art thou so squemish that thou can not see Wine, but thou must
surfeit? can thou not draw nigh the fire and warm^ thee? but thou must with
Satyrus kiss it and burn thee? art thou so little master of thy affections,
that if thou gaze on a picture, thou must with Pigmalion be passionate? can
thou not pass through Paphos, but thou must offer incense to Venus? do thou
think it injury to Cupid to look, if thou do not love? Ah fond fool,
know this, fire is to be used, but not to be handled: the Barren flour^^^^ to
be worn in the hand, not chawed in the mouth: the precious stone Echites to
be applied outwardly, and not to be taken inwardly: and beauty is made to
feed the eye, not to ^etter the heart, will thou then swallow up the bait which
thou know to be ^ane? w^lt thou hazard at that which cannot be had without
har^^^, no, stretch not too far, wade not too deep, use b^^utie, but serve
it not, shake the tree, but taste not of the fruit, (...) thou find it too
hard to be disgested^ Why? but beauty is a God, (...) will be obeyed, love
looks to command, not to be conquered: (...) strove but once with Venus, and
she was vanquished: (...) sen^^^d Cupid, but he went by the worst: it is hard
for thee (...) the Crab^e to swim against the stream, or with the Salaman^^r
to strive against the fire, for in wrestling with a fresh wound, thou shall but
make the sore more dang^ro^s. Yea but what fondne^se is this A^basto to s^^th
thy self ^n ^hy ^olly? Thou did come a Captain, and will thou return a
^aptiue? thy intent was to conquer, not to be vanquished, to fight ^ith the
La^nce, not to be ^o^^d with love, to use thy spear, not thy pen, to challenge
M^rs, not to dally with Venus. How do thou think to subdue France, which
can not rule thine own affections? Art thou able to quail a kingdom, which
can not quell thin^ own mind? no, it will be hard for thee to go in triumph,
which art not so much as Lord of thy self. But A^basto, if thou will needs
love, use it as a toy to pass away the time, which thou may take up at thy
lust, and lay down at thine own^ pleasure. Love? why Arbasto, do thou
dr^ame, whom should thou love? Doral^cia? what thy foe? one that wishes thy
mishap, and partly prays to the Gods, for thy mis-fortu^e? no sure thou art
not so fond.

And with that, as I uttered these words, such thoughts, such sighs, such
sobs, such tears assailed me, as I was stricken dumb^ with the extremity of
these hellish passions, sc^rce being able to draw my breath for a good space,
till at last recovering my senses, I fell to my former sorrow in this sort.

Yes alas Arbasto, it is the luckl^sse love of Doralici^, and therefore the
more lucklesse because thou love Doralicia, that has thus inchaunted thy
affections. She is not thy friend whom thou may hope to get, but thy foe,
whom thou art sure not to gain: for do thou think she will requite thy
merit with meed, or repay thy love with liking? no, she hates thee Arbasto, as
sworn Pelorus foe, and her enemy. Can sh^^ love thee which s^ekest her fathers
life: nay, did she love, yet could she think thou do like, which layest
s^^ge to her City? no, unless by love she were blinded with too much love.
Since then to fancy thy foe, is with the Co^katrice to peck against the s^eele,
subdue thy affections, be master of thy mind, use Will as thy subi^ct, not as
thy soueraig^^, so may thou triumph and laugh at Cupid, saying: Fond^^^ I
was in love, what then.

I had ^o (...) sealed ^p ^hese secret meditations with a sorrowful sigh, but
least being so^^tary I should fall into farther dumps, I went out of my Tent to
pass away the time with some pleasant par^^, thinking this the fittest means
to drive away idle fancies, hoping that h^t love would grow cold, that the
greatest ^a^in was but a blaze, and that love most violent^ in me was ever
least permanent.

CHAP. 3. Arbasto in love with Doralicia, and Myrania with Arbasto, have hau^
opportunity to discover the same.
B^t i^ you would see, you must understand how Love and Fortune can play false
when they list. I ^as not so drowne^ in desires toward Doralicia, as poor
Myr^nia burned with affection t^wards me. For Venus willing to show she was a
woman, by her wilful contrarieties, so fier^d her fancies with the form of my
feature, as the poor Lady was perplexed with a thousand sundry passions, one
while she sought with hate to raze out love, but that was with the Dear to
feed against ^he wind: another while she devised which way to obtain her
desire: but then alas she heaped coals upon her head, for she saw no spark of
hop^ to procure so good hap. Driven thus into sundry dumpes, she fell at last
into these terms.

Alas Myrania (quoth she) happy, yea, thrice happy are those maids which are
borne in the Isle Meroc, which ^n their virginity are suffered to see none but
him whom they shall marry, and being wives are forbidden by the law to see any
man but their husband, until they be past fifty. In this country Myrania,
beauty is used as a natural gift, not honored as a supernatural God, and
they love only one, because love cannot force them to like any other: so that
they sow their love in joy, and reap it in pleasure. Would God thou had
been borne in this soil, or brought up in the same sort, so should thou
have triumphed over beauty as a slave, which now leads thee as a servile
captive.

O unfortunate Myran^a, have thou so little force to withstand fancy, as at the
first alarm thou must yield to affection? can thou not look with Salmacis,
but thou must love? can thou not s^e with Smylax, but thou must sigh? can
thou not view Narcissus with Eccho^ but thou must be vowed to his beauty?
Learn, learn fond fool by others mishaps to beware: for she that loves in
have, often times, nay, alw^ies repents at leisure. The Hippians anointing
themselves with the fat of the fish Mugr^, pass through most furious flames
without any per^l: the people called P^ilii, as long as they sacrif^ce unto
Vest^, can be hurt with no venomous Serpents. Telephus as he wore the
counterfeit of Pallas shield, was in^uln^rable, and thou as long as thy mind is
fraught with the chaste thogh^e of Diana, can never be fired with the haples
flame of Venus: arm thy self with reason, and thou may pass through
Cytheria without danger, let thy will and wit b^ dir^cted with advised counsel,
and thou may say: Cupid, I defy thee.

Ah Myrania, things are soon promised, but not so quickly performed: it is
easy to sound the victory, but passing hard to obtain the conquest: all can
say, I would overcome, but few or none return with triumph Beauty is
therefore to be obeyed, because it is beauty, and love to be ^eared of men,
because honored of the Gods. D^^^^ reason abide the brunt, when beauty bids
the battle? can wis^dome win the field, when love is Captain? No, no, love is
without law, and therefore above all law, honored in heaven, feared in earth,
and a very terror to the infernal Ghostes.

Bow then unto that Myrania, whereunto lawless necessity does bend, be not so
fond, as with Xerxes to bind the Ocean sea in fetters: fight not with the
Rascians against the wind: seek not with them of Scyrus, to shoot against the
stars: contend not with Niobe against Lato^^, nor strive not with Sapho against
Venus, for love being a Lord looks to c^mmand by power, and to ^e obeyed by
force.

Truth Myrania, but what then, to love is easy, and perhaps good, but to like
w^ll is hard and a doubtful chance: fancy thy fill (fond fool) so thou bend
not thy affection to thy fathers foe: for to lou^ him who seeks his ^^^e, is
to war against nature and Fortune. Is there ^on^ worthy to be thy spheere but
Arbasto, the cursed enemy of thy country? can none win thy good will, but the
bloody wretch, who seeks to breed thy Fathers bane? Can the ^agle and the
bird Osiphage build in one tree? will the Faulken and the Done, covet to sit on
one perch? will the Ape and the Bear be tied in one tedder? will the Fox and
the lamb lie in one den? no^ they want reason, and yet nature suffers them not
to live against nature: will thou then be so wilful or witless, as having
reason to guide nature, yet to be more unnatural then unreasonable creatures?
be sure if thou fall in this, thou st^iuest against the Gods, and in str^uing
wi^h them, look for a most sharp revenge.

T^sh I know this, but has not love set down his sentence, and shall I appeal
from his censure? shall I deny that which the destini^s have decreed? no, for
though Cydippa rebelled for a time, yet she was forced at last to make suit t^
Venus for a pardon, and I may seek to hate Arbasto, but never find ^^hers to
begin to mislike him. And with that, such flery pa^^ion^ o^^ressed her, as she
was feign to send forth scalding sighs, som^hat to ease her enflamed fancy,
which being sorrowfully sobbed forth^ she then began afresh to power forth her
pitiful complaints, if ^er sister Doralicia, being accompanied with other
gentlewomen, had not dri^^^ her ^^t of these dumps, whom she no sooner spied,
but leaving her passions ^he wared pleasant, covering care with conceits, and a
mourning heart with a merry countenance, least her sorrowful looks, might
giu^ the company occasion to conjecture somewhat was amiss. But I alas, which
felt the furious flames of fancy to broile inc^ssantly within my breast, could
not so cu^ningly dis^^mble my passions, but all my Peers saw I was perplexe^^
for whereas before this sudden chance, Pelorus mis-fortun^ ^rocured my mirth,
now the soil which I reaped by affection drove me to a deeper misery. In the
day I spent the time in solitary dumps, in the night aff^cted thoughts and
visions suffered me scarce to slumber: for alas there is no greater enemy to
the mind, than in love to live without hope, which doubt was the sum of my
endless sorrow, that in seeing my self fettered, I could see no hope at all
of my freedom: yet to mittigate my misery, I thought to walk from the Camp
toward the City, that I might at the least feed my eye with the s^ght of the
place wherein the Mistress of my heart was harbored, taking with me only for
company a Duke of my Country called Ege^io, unto whom I durst best commit my
secret affairs, who noting my unaccustomed passions, coniecturing the cause of
my care by the outward effects, coveting carefully to apply a salve to my sore,
and to drive me from such drows^e thoughts, wakened me from my dumps with this
pleasant device.

Sir (quoth he) I have often marvelled, and yet cannot cease to muse at the
madness of those men, whom the common people think to honor with the glorious
title of lovers, who when rashly they purchase their own mishap in placing
their affe^^ion, where either their disability, or the destinies deny success
to their suites, do either pass their days in endless dolor, or prevent
misery by untimely death. If these passionate patients listened a little to
Venus all^^ements, as I to Cupids flatteries, few men should have cause to call
the Gods unjust, or women cruel, for I think of love as Mylciades the Athenian
did, who was wont to say, that of all the plagues wherewith the gods did af^^ict
mortal men, love was the greatest, in that they sought that as an heavenly
bliss, which at last they found their fatal bane.

^earing Ege^io thus cunningly and cou^^^ly to touch me at the quick, I
thought to dally with him in this ^^se.

Why Egerio, do thou count it a madnes^e to love, or do thou think him
rash which yields willing^^ ^o it, know thou not that love i^ divine, and
therefore comm^^deth by power, and cannot be resisted? I am not of that mind
with Mylciad^s, that love is a plague, but rather I think he is favored of
the gods and is a happy lover.

Truth (quoth he) but who is happ^ in love? he that has the happie^^
success? no, for I count him most unhappy which in love is most h^ppy.

Why then Egerio (quoth I) thou think^st him v^ha^p^ that ^ee loves.

Or else may it please your highness (quoth he) I should think amiss: for
shall I count him fortu^ate which for one dram of prosperity, reapeth a whole
pound of misery? or shall I ^steeme that lover happy, whose greatest gain is
but gol^en grief? nay that is never to be called pleasure, which is s^uced
with pain, nor that good luck who^^ guerdeon is loss.

Since Egerio (quoth I) thou do thus br^adly blaspheme against Cupid, tell me
why thou thinke^^ ill of lou^.

Because sir (quoth he) it is lou^, being such a frenzy which so infecteth the
minds of men, as under the taste of Nactar, they are poisoned with the water
of Stix, for as he which was charmed by Lara, sought still to hear her
enchantment, or as the D^ere after once he brouseth on the ^amariske tree,
will not be driven away till h^^ dies: so our amorous lovers have their
senseless senses so besott^d with the power of this lasciu^ous God, that they
count not themselves happy, but in their supposed unhappiness, b^ing at most
ease in disqui^t, at greatest re^^ when they are most troubled, seeking
contentation in care, delight in misery, and hunting greedily after that, which
alway^s brings endless harm^.

This is but your sentence Egerio (quoth I) but what reason have you to
confirm your censur^?

Such (quoth he) as your highness can neither dislike nor infring: for the
first step to love is the loss of liberty, tying the mind to the will of
her, who either too curious, little respects his suit, or too co^, smally
regards his service, yet he is so blinded with a ^o^le of fond affection,
that he co^nteth her sullenness soberness, her vain charine^, virtuous
chastity: if she be wanton, he counts her wit^ie, if too familiar,
court^ous; so besotted with the drugs of doting love, that every fault is
virtue, and though every string be out of tune, yet the music cannot be found
amiss: resembling Tamantus the Painter^ who shadowed the worse pictures with
the freshest colors.

The pains that Lovers f^^le for hunting after loss, if their minds were not
charmed with some secret enchantment, were able either to keep ^^eir ^i^des
from being in^^am^d, or else to cool desire being (...) kindled: for the days
are spent in thoughts ^he nights in dr^^mes, both in danger, either beg^^^ing
us of that we had, or promising us that we have not. The head fraught with
^ancies, ster^^ with zeal, troubled with both: yea so many inconueni^nc^s
w^i^e upon love, as to reckon them all were infinite, ^ to taste but one of
them intolerable, being always begun with gr^^^e, conti^^^^ with sor^ow, and
ended with ^eath: for it is a pain shadowed with pleasure, and i^y stuffed
with misery: so that I conclude, that as none ever saw the Altars of Basyris
without sorrow, nor banqueted with P^olus without surfeiting: so as impossible
it is to deal^ with Cupid, and not incur either speedy death, or endless
danger.

As I was ready to reply to Eg^rios reasons, drawing to a small thick^t of
trees, which was hard adjoining to the City, I spied where some of the French
Dames were f^iendly ^^tting about a clear fount^in, of whom after I had taken
a narrow view, easily percei^ed they were three Ladies (accompanied with one
Page) namely Myrania, Doralicia, and their Nurse called Madame Vecchia, which
sudden sight so appalled my senses, as if I had been appointed a new Judge to
the three goddesses in the valley of Id^^ yet seeing before my eyes the
mistress of my thoughts, and the Saint unto whom I did owe my devotion, I
began to take courage, thinking that by this fit opportunity, Love and Fortune
would favor my enterprise, willing therefore not to let slip so good an
occasion, I boldly paced to them, whom I saluted in this sort.

Fair Ladi^s, the s^ght of your surpassing beauties so dazzled mine ^yes, as at
the first I was in doubt, whether I should honor you as heavenly Nymphs, or
salut^ you as earthly creatures: but as I was in this dumpe. I readily called
to mind the figure of your divine fac^s, which being at my coming to your
fathers Court by some secret influence most surely imprinted in my fancy, I
have hitherto, without any spark of forgetfulness perfectly retained (feeling
^uer since in my heart such strange p^s^ions) an unaccustomed deuo^^on to your
beauty and virtues, as I would thin^e the Gods and ^ort^ne did favor me, if
either I might f^nd^ ^cc^sion to manifest my affection, or live to do you
service.

Doralic^a hearing me thus strangely to salu^^ her, although she saw her
self in the hands of her Fath^^^ (...)^ yet nothing dismayed, with a coy
countenance, she gave me (...) ^^abbish answer.

Sir (quoth she) if at the first look (...) for Nymphs, by the perfection of
our di^^n^ beauty, (...) that e^ther your women in Denmark are very fo^^^ or
your (...)lemish^ since your coming into France: for we ^now our imper^^^^^ons
far unworthy of such dissembled praise. But Diomedes smiled most when he
pretended greatest mischief: Scyron entertaine^ his guests best, when he meant
to entreat them worst: Lycaon feasted Jupiter when he sought to betray him: the
Hiena ever fauneth at her pre^: ^he Syren^ sing when the^ mean to enchaunt:
Circes is most (...) when she presents poison: and so you, in praising our
beauty seek to spoil our blood: in^xtolling our perfec^ion, to make us most
imperfect, in wishing openly out weal, s^cre^ly to work ou^ death and
destruction. For your service you offer us, we so much the more mis^ke it, for
his sake that makes the proffer: for we are not so inueigled with love, or so
senseless to conceive, but that we think he little favors the ste^s, that
cutteth dow^e the old stock, he smally res^ect^th the twig, that tendereth not
the root, and he ligh^ly loves the ^hild, that deadly hates the f^ther, Pol
xena counted Achill^s a fl^tterer, because he continued the siege against Troy,
and Cressid for sooke Troy^us because he warred against the Grecians, nor can
we count him our pr^uy fri^nd, which is our open foe.

Why Madame (quoth I) did not Tarpeia favor Tati^s thou^h a foe unto Rome? did
not Scylla respect Mynos though he besieged Ni^us?

Truth sir (quoth Myrania) but the gains they got was p^rpetuall shame and
e^dlesse discredit, for the one was slain by the ^abynes, the other re^ected
by Mynos. The young Faunes cannot ^bide to look on the Tiger: the Halciones are
no so^ nor hatched but they (...) the Eagle. Andromache would neu^r trust the
fair speeches ^f Py^^^us, nor Dydo laugh when she saw Hiarbas smile: where
the party is known to ^e a professed foe, there suspicious hate ensues of
course: and fo^d were that person that would think well of ^^m, that
pro^e^^^^h poison though in a golden pot.

Madame (quoth I) I know it is hard where mistr^st is harbored to infer
belief, or to procure credit where his truth is called (...) question: but I
wish no be^ter success to happen to my self, than in ^art I do imagine to
y^^ all, swea^ing by the gods that I do honor your beauties and ^^^tue^ so
much, that if I had won the conquest, and you were my ca^^ues, yet would I
honor you a^ my soueraig^es, and obey you as a loving sub^^ct.

But I pray God, qu^th ^^^^me Vecchia, you have never occasion to show us such
fauo^r^ ^o^ we cause to sta^^^ (...) your ^^^tes^e: ^or I doubt we should (...)
your ^lowing heat turn^d to a chilling cold, and your gre^^ promises to sm^^^
^^rformance.

In the ^^an time (and with that she took Myrania and Doralicia by the hands)
we will leave you to ^et^rne (...) the Camp, and we will (...) to the City,
willing to g^ue you^ ^ankes for your good will, when we find you a friend and
not be^o^^^

Nay ^adame (quoth I) not so, for constr^e of my m^^ning how you please, or
accept of my company how you list, I will not be ^o discourteous to leave you
so sl^nderly guided, as in the guard of this little Page. And with that taking
Doralicia by the hand, willing not to let slip so good opportunity, I began to
Court her in this manner.

The choice is hard Madame, where the party is compelled either by silence to
die with grief, or by vn^olding his mind, to li^e with shame, yet so sweet
is the desire of life, and so bitter the pass^ons of love, that I am enforced
to prefer an unseemly suit, before an vn^imel^ death. Loath I am to speak,
and in despair I am to speed: For considering what love is, I faint, and
thinking how I am counted a foe, I fear. But sigh where love commands, there
it is ^olly to resist, so it is Madame, that intending to be victor, I become a
vassal, co^^ing to conquer, I am caught a captive, seeking to bring other into
thrall, I have lost mine own liberty. Your heavenly beauty h^th brought me
into bondage, your exquisite perfection has snared my freedom, your virtuous
qualities have subdued my mind, and only your courtesy may free me from car^,
or your cr^eltie cross me with calamity. To recount the ^^rrowes I have
sustained since I first was inueigled with thy beauty, or the service I have
vowed unto thy virtue. since thou (...) count by talk, though never so true,
but mere toys, were rather to breed in thee an admiration then a belief. But
this I added for the ti^e, which the end shall ^ry for a truth, that so
faithful is my affection, and so loyal is my love, that if thou take not
pit^y of my pass^ons, either my life shall be too short, or my misery too long.

Doralicia hearing att^nti^ely my talk, o^t times changed her color, as one
in great choler, being so inflamed ^ith a melancholic ^inde of hate, as she
was not of a long time able to ^^^er one word, yet at last with a face full of
fury, she ^urst forth in^^ th^se despightfull terms.

Why Arbasto (quoth she) art thou of late become frantic, or doe^^ tho^
think me in a frenzy: ^ast thou been bitten with the serpent Amphisbena which
procures m^enes, o^ do^^ thou suppose me fraught with some lunaticke (...),
for thy speech m^keth me think, either thou art ^roubled with the one, or that
thou counts me combred with the other^ if this thy poisoned parle were in ^est,
it was too ^road, wey^ng the case; if in earnest, too bad considering the
person: for to talk ^f peace amidst the pikes, shows either a co^ard, or a
counterfeit: and to sue for love by hate, either frenzy or fo^^y. It is a ^ad
Hare ( Arbasto) that will be caught with a Taber, ^ greedy fish that comes to
a bare book, a blind G^^se that runs to the Fores sermon and she a loving
fool that stoopeth to her enemies lure. No, no, think me not so fond, or at
least hope not to find me so foolish, as with Phryne to fancy Cec^ops, with
Harpalice to like Archemerus, with Scilla to love Mynos, with careless Minion^
so far to forget my honor, my honesty, my parents, and my Country, as to
love, nay not deadly to hate him which is a foe to the lea^^ of these: for
experience t^acheth m^, that the fairer the stone is in the Toades head, the
more pes^ilent is the poison in her bowels, the brig^t^r the Serpent^ scales
be, the more inf^ctious is her breath; and the talk of an enemy, the more it
is seasoned with delight, the more it sauore^h of despite, c^^se then to seek
for lo^^, where t^ou shall ^^nde nothing but hate, for assure thy self, (...)
thou did fan^y as faithfully, as thou do flatter fal^^y, yet the guerdeon
for thy love should be only this, that I will pray incessantly to the Gods,
in thy life to p^st^r th^e with earthly ^orments, and after death to plague
thee with hellish tortures.

Although these bitter blastes of Doralicia, had been a sufficient coo^ing
card^ to quench fond affection, yet as the wa^er causes the seacoale to burn
more freshly, so her despightfull terms far more inflamed my ^^^^re, that I
made her this fri^^dly reply.

Alas (Madame) weigh my case with equity: if you hate me, as I am ^oe to
Pelorus, yet favor me as I am friend to Doralicia. If you loath me as a
conqueror of your country, yet pity me as I am a captive to your beauty.
If you vouchsafe not to listen to the lure of your enemy, yet hear the
passionate complaints of a perplexed lover, who leading others in triumph, yet
himself lives in most hapl^sse servitude.

If I have done a^isse Doralicia, I will make amends: if I have committed a
fault, I will both requite it, and recompense it: a^ I have been thy fathers
^oe^ so I will be his faithful friend, as I have sought his bale, I will
procure his bliss: yea, I will go against the hair in all things, so I may
please ^hee in any thing.

But as I was about to make a longer discours^, she cut mo off in this wise.

In faith (...) (quoth she) so well do I like you, that you cannot more
displease me, then in s^eking to please (...) for if I knew no other caus^ to
hate th^e, yet this (...) su^^ise, that I cannot but dislike thee: he therefore
my fathers friend, or his foe, like h^^, or ha^^ him, yet this assure thy self
that I will n^^^^ love thee. And with that she flung from me in a great cha^^.
Reply I could not, for by th^^ w^e were come to the gates of the ^i^ie, where
(though unwilling) I took my leave of them in this sort.

I am sor^y ^adies that such is my luck, and so vnh^^py is my lot, that in
offering my self a companion, I have greatly offended you wi^h my company: yet
since I cannot strive against chance, I think my self happy that Fortune has
honored me with the fru^tion of your presence, hoping when time shall try my
words no tales but truth, you will at last make me amends with cryiu^ peccaui:
in the mean while I commit you to the tuition of the Gods, praying Fortune
rather to plagu^ me with all mishap, then to cross you with any mischance.

The thanks I had for this my friendly curtesie^ was a coy disdainful look
of Doralicia, and a c^urlish vale of the old trot Vecchia, but Myrania (as one
stung with the prick^ of fancy) ^ad me farewell, with a more curious gloze.

I^ sir (quoth she) the secret intent of your friendship, had been agreeable
to the outward manner of your curtes^e: ^ee had ere this yielded you great
thanks for your company: but since you greet us with a Iudas^e kiss, we
think we have small cause to gratify you for your kindness: notwit^standing,
least you should accuse us wholly of discourtes^e, we say, we thank you,
whatsoever we think, and with that she cast on me such a loving look, as she
seemed to play ^oth to depart.

CHAP. 4. Arbasto and Myrania with several conjectures for love, renewed their
complaints.
THey now returning to the Court, and I ret^ring to the Camp, f^^ling my self
deeply perplexed, yet as much as I could dissembled my passions, willing in
love not to be counted a lover, ie^^ing therefore with Eger^o, I thus began to
dr^^ him on.

How now Egerio, has not the beauty of these ^aires Ladies, brought you from
your fond (...)? will you not ^ee content for blaspheming Love, in penance to
carry a burning ^^ggot before Cupid? me thought your eyes were gazing,
wheresoever your heart was gadding: but tell me in good troth^ is not
Doralicia worthy to be loved?

Yes sir (quoth he) if she were not Doralicia, for as she is beau^^^full, she
is to be liked of all, but as she is Pelorus daughter, not to desired of
Arbasto, least in seeking to gain her love, he get that which he least looked
for.

Why Egerio, what ill luck can ensue of love, when I mean not to ven^ure but
upon trust, nor to trust without trial?

Such as happened to Achilles by Polexen^, and yet he feared Priamus. But alas
^ir, I sigh to think, and I sorrow to s^e that reason should yield to
affection, liberty to love, freedom to fancy, that Venus should bear the
target, and Mars the dista^te: that Omphale should handle the club, and
Hercules the spindle: that Alexander should ^r^^ch, and Campaspe be coy: that a
warlike mind should yield to a little wavering beauty, and that a Prince whose
prowess could not be subdued, should by lou^ become subject at the f^^st shot.

What Egerio (quoth I) know thou not that he whom no mortal c^eature can
control, love can command, that no dignity is able to ^^^^st Cupids deity?
Achilles was inuulnerable, yet wounded by fancy: Hercules not to be conqu^red
of any, yet quickly vanquished by ^ffection: Mars able to resist Jupiter, but
not to withstand beauty. Love is not only kindled in the eye by desire, but
engraven in the mind by destiny, which neither reason can eschew, nor wisdom
expel.

The more pity (quoth he) for poor men, and greater impiety in the Gods,
that in giving love free liberty, they granted him a lawl^^se privilege. But
since Cupid will be obeyed, Arbasto is willing to be obedient, would God love
had either aimed ^^isse, or else had not m^de Doralicia the mart.

I not willing that Egerio should be privy to my passions, told him that what
I spo^e was in jest, and that if ever I did fancy, I would use love as the
Persians did the Sun, who in the morning honor it as a God, and at noon^ti^e
curse it as a devil. Concealing thus my care, the covered smokes burst in^o
great flames, that coming to my Tent, I was f^rst to cast my self upon my
bed, where I sobbed forth sorrowfully these words.

Alas Arbasto, how art thou perplexed, thou both li^est in ill hap^ and love
with out hope: thou burn^^^ with desire, and art cooled wi^h disdain: thou art
bidden to the f^ast by love, and art b^aten with the spit by beauty. But what
then, do thou count it ca^e which thou suffer for Doralicia, who shameth
Venus for her hue, and staineth Di^na for her chastity? Yea but A^basto, the
more beauty she ^ath, the more ^r^^e, and the more virtue, the more
preciseness. None must play ^n Mercuries pipe, but O^pheus: none rule Luci^^r,
but Ph^ebus: none wear Venus in a tablet but Alexander, nor none i^^o^
Doralicia, but such an one as far exc^edeth th^e in person and paren^age:
thou see she has denied thy su^e, disdained thy service, lightly respected
thy love, and smally regarded thy liking, only promising this, while she lives
to be thy professed f^e. And what then fo^d fool, wi^t thou shrink for an
April shower? know thou not that a denial is a grant, and a gentle answer
a flattering sl^ut: that the more they s^eme at the first to loath, the more
they love at the last. Is not Venus painted catching the ball with her hands,
w^^ch she seems to spurn with her ^eet? Does not the Mirre tree being
h^wen, yield no say, which not moved powers forth ^^rrup: and women being
w^ed, deny that, which of themselves they most earnestly desire.

The stone Sandrasta is not so hard, but being heat in the fire, it may be
wrought: no Iuory so ^ough, but seasoned with Su^ho, it may be engraven, no
hawke so haggard, which in time may not be called to the lure: nor no women so
wilful, which by some means may not be won. Hope the best then and be bold,
for Love and For^une cares not for cowards.

Nay tush Arbasto, what need thou pine thus in h^plesse passions, or seek
for that with sorrow, which thou may obtain with a small suit, raise up thy
siege, grant but conditions of peace, show but a friendly countenance to
Pelorus, and he neither will nor dare deny thee his daughter Doralicia. Do^
this then Arbasto, nay I would it^ and that with speed, for now I agree to
Tully that it is good: Iniquissimam pacem iustissi^o bello anteponer^.

Well, being resolved upon this point, I felt my mind disburthened of a
thousand cares, wherewith before I was cl^gged, feeding my self with the hope
of that pleasure, which ^^en ininioyed should recompense my former pain.

But alas, poor Myrania could not feel one minute of such ease, for she
incessantly turned the stone with Sysiphus, rolled on the whe^le with Ixion,
and filled the bottomless tub^ with Belydes, in so much that when she could
^^nd^ no ^eanes to mittigate her malady, she fell into these bitter complaints.

Ah My^ania, ah wretched wench My^ania, how art thou without reason, which
suffer reason to yield unto appetite, wisdom unto sensual will, and a
free mind unto servile love: but I perceive when the Iuie rises, it wreatheth
about the ^l^e: when the ^^p grows high, it bat^^ need of a pole, and when
virgins war in years, they follow that which belongs to their youth. Love,
love, yea but they love expecting some good hap, and I alas both love and live
without all hope, for Arbasto is my for, and yet if he were my friend, he
likes not me, he looks only upon Doralicia. Since then Myrania thou art
pinched, and have none to pity thy passions, dissemble thy love, though it
shorten thy life: for better it were to dye with grief, than li^^ with shame.
The sponge is full of water, yet it is not seen. The lea^e of the tree Alpina
though it be wet, looks always dry, and a wise lover be she never so much
tormented, beh^ueth her self as though she were not touched. Yea, but fire
cannot be hidden in the Flax without smoke, nor music in the bosom without
smell, nor love in the breast without suspicion. Why then s^eke some means to
manifest thy love to Arbasto: for as the stone Draconites can by no means be
polished, unless the Lapidarie burn it, so thy mind can by no medicine be
cured, unless Arbasto ease it: alas Arbasto sweet Arbasto, And with that she
fetched such a groaning sigh, that one of her maids came into the chamber, who
by her presence putting her from her passions, sat so long by, till tired with
drous^e thoughts she fell into a slumber.

Fortune frowning thus upon her, and ^auning upon me, I set my foot on the
fairest sands, although at last I ^o^nd them most fickle, thinking I must
needs tread the measures right, when Fortune piped the dance, but though I
threw at all, yet my chance was hard, for Pelorus tri^ling for truce, pretended
treason: making a show of fear, sought subtly how to overthrow me by deceit,
saying, in ruling of Empires there is required as great policy as prowess, in
in gou^rning an estate, close cruelty does more good than open clemency: for
the obtaining of a kingdom, as well mischief, as mercy is to be practiced,
that better he were to commit an inconu^nience in breaking his oath, than
suffer a mischief by keeping his promise: setting down the staff therefore
in this secure periu^ie, thus it fell out.

CHAP. 5. Arbasto is traitorously surprised by Pelorus, and imprisoned in
OrOrleance, with all his army defeated.
AFter two or three days were passed, accompanied only with Ege^^o, and a few
of my guard, I went to Orleance, determining both to conclude a peace, and to
demand Dolaricia in marriage: where no sooner arrived, and entered in at the
gates of the City, but I found Pelorus and all his men in Arms, which sight so
appaled my senses, that I (...) as one trans-formed, fearing that which
presently I found tru^: for Pelorus having his force inflamed with furious
choler, commanded his Captains to lay hold on me, and to carry me to close
prison, swearing that no less than the loss of life should mittiga^e his
fury.

And raging in this choler, after he had lodged me up in Lymbo, he went with
all his army to the Camp, where finding my soldiers secure, as men little
doubting of such misfortune, he made such a monstrous and mercile^^e slaughter,
as of fifty thou^and he left ^ew a ^ue, t^ose which ^emained he plagued with
all kind o^ slavery: returning ^^om with his shameless triumph, he commanded
that in the midst of the Ci^ie there should be made a great scaffold, whereupon
within t^nne days I should be executed: these heavy and hapless news being
come to mine ears, such sorr^wfull passions perplexed my mind, as after fl^ud^
of brinish t^a^es, I burst forth into these bi^ter terms.

O unfortunate Arbasto (quoth I) art thou not worthy of this misha^ which
wilfully sought thine own misery? can thou accuse the Gods, which did
strive against the Gods? can thou condemn ^ortune, which have warred against
nature and Fortune? No, no, in suffering reason to yield unto appeti^e,
wisdom unto will, and wit unto affection, thou have procured thine own
death, and thy soldiers destruction. Love, yea, love it is that has procured
thy se^^e, beauty that has bred thy bale: fancy has given thee the ^o^le,
and thine own witless will has wrought thy owe: the more is thy pain, and the
less thou art to be pitied: was ther^ none to like but Doralicia? none to
choose but thy foe? none to love but th^^^ enemy? O vile wretch fraught with
careless folly.

And ^ith that, (...) I was ready to exclaim against my cursed destiny, I
heard the prison door ^pen, where I saw presently to enter, My^ania,
Doralicia^ and ^adame V^cchia, who seeing me s^t in such sorrowful dumps,
began to smile at my ^olor, and to laugh at my mishap, which wilfully thrust my
sel^^ into such misery, thinking therefore to aggrauate my grief by r^bbing
afresh my sore, Doralicia began to gall me on this sort.

Hearing Arbasto (quoth she) that you were come to pros^cute your s^te playing
the good Captain, that for the first foil given not over the f^eld, I thought
good to give you a smiling look, in recompense o^ your fl^ttering love, least
if I should not be so courteous to so kind a Gentleman, the world should
account me ^ngratefull.

It is truth (...) (quoth Myrania) it seems he is a passing amorous lover:
but it is pity he has very ill luck: he chooses his chaf^^r (...), but yet
is an unskillful chapman, for if he buy at such an unreasonable rate, he is
like to live by the loss.

Tush (Madame Vecchia) he plays like the Dragon, who sucking blood out of the
Elephant, kills him, and with the same poysoneth her self: so Arbasto,
seeking to betray others, is himself taken in the trap: a just r^ward for so
v^^^^^ ^ealing and a ^^t ^euenge for so ^retchlesse an enemy.

And yet (quoth Doralicia) his purpose has taken small place: for whatsoever
his mind was, his malice has wanted might, wherein he resembles the Serpent
Porphirius, who is full of poison, but being toothlesse, hurts none but
himself. Surely whatsoever his chance be, he^ has made a very good choice:
for he prefers sweet love before ^itter death, and the hope of everlasting
fame, before the fear of momentary misfortune: he shall now for his
constancy be^ canonized in Denmark for a saint, and his subjects may boast and
say, that A^basto our king died for love.

Egerio seeing that extremity of gri(...)er me to utter one word, not able any
longer to abide these ^cumps, crossed her with this ch^^lericke reply.

Gentlewoman (quoth he) although I so term you, rather to show m^^ own
courtesy, than to decipher your conditions, it seems nurture has taught you
very few manners, or nature affoorded very small mo^^^^y, that seeing one in
distress, you should laugh at his dolor, and where the party is crossed with
mishap, you would with bitter taunts increase his misery: if he be your for,
he has now the foil, he is taken in the snare, his life hangs in the
balance.

Though your father ^ee without pi^tie, yet in that you are a woman, be not
without pity. Hate him if you please as he is your e^emy, but despise him not
as he i^ Arbasto, a king, and your hapless lover: we are captives, not to a
worthy conqueror, but to a wretched catife: not van^ by prowess, but by
perjury, not by fight, but by falsehood. W^o in ou^ liue^ to thy fathers less,
won continual fame, and he by our deaths shall purchase perpetual infamy.

Doralicia not willing to suffer him wade any fu^ther, cut him short in this
manner.

Sir, if bragges could stand for payment, I am sure you w^^ld not die in any
m^^s debt: but if your prowess had been as good as your prattle, you needed
not ^aue daunced within so short a t^oder: cr^uen Cocks crow lowdest, fearful
curs bar^e most, and a hartl^sse coward has always more tongue th^n a hauty
Captain. But I bear^ with you, for I doubt the fear of death and danger, has
driven thy master into a cold palsy, and has mad^ th^e either fra^ticke or
lunaticke, the one showing his melancholy, the other bewraying thy choler,
willing therefore as a friend you should pass over your passions with more
patience, we will ^eaue y^u as we found you unless you mean to be shri^^n,
and then I will send you a ghostly father.

Our co^fe^sion good mistress (quoth Egerio) requires but a small ^hri^t: for
we ^aue very little to say, but that Arbasto repents that e^e^ he loved such a
perue^se minion, and I that ever trusted such a p^ri^red traitor

The Gentlewom^n took this for a farewell, pa^sing merrily to the Palace, and
leaving us sitting sorrowfully in the prison, bewayling our mishap with tears,
and exclaiming against Fortune with bitter curses, what our complaints were it
little avails to rehearse^ for it would but drive thee into dumpes, and
redouble my dolor. Suffice this that we were so long tormented with care, that
at last we were past cure, counting this our greatest calamity, that living,
every hour we looked to die.

But as thus we were drowned in distress: so ^oore Myrania had her mind
doubtfully perplexed. Nature claimed by due to have the pre-eminence, and love
^ought by force to win the supremacy. Nature brought in Peloru^ aged hairs
to make the challenge, and Love presented A^bastoes sweet face to be the
Champion: ^^ssed thus with two contrary tempests, at last she began to plead
with her pas^ions.

Ah thrice unfortunate Myrania, what strange fits be these that burn thee
with heat, and yet thou shakest with cold the body in a shiuering sweat and
in a flaming Ice, melting as ^axe, and yet as hard as the Adamant: is it love?
then would it were death for likelier it is thou shall lose thy life, than
win thy love.

Ah hapless Arbasto, would to God thy virtues were less than thy beauty, or
my ^ertues greater then my auctions: so should I either quickly free my self
from fancy, or be less subie^^ed ^o folly.

But alas I ^eele in my mind fierce skirmishes be^^^^ne reason and appetite,
love and wisdom, danger and desire, the one persuading to hate Arbasto as a
foe, the other constraining to love him as a friend: If I consent to the first,
I end my days with death, if to the last, I shall lead my life with infamy.
What shall I then do? Ah Myrania, either swallow the juice of Mandrake, which
may cast thee into a dead sleep, or chew the herb Ca^ysium, which may cause
thee to hate eu^ry thing, so either shall thou die in thy slumber, or dislike
Arbasto by the potion.

Tush poor wench, what folli^s be ^hese? will thou with the Wol^e bark at the
Moon, or with the young Griphons, pecke against the stars? Do thou think
to quench fire with a sword: or with affection to mortif^e love?

No, no, if thou be wise suffer not the grass to be cut from under thy feet,
strike while the iron is hot, make thy market while the chaffer is to sale.

Now Arbasto is thine own, now thou ma^st win him by love, and wear him by
law: thou may free him from misery without thy ^athers mishap: thou may
save his life without thy Fathers loss: thou may grant thy good will unto
love, and yet not falsi^^o thy faith unto nature.

Ca^ Arbasto which is so courteous, become so cruel, but he will requite thy
love with loyalty, thy faithful fancy, with vn^ained affection?

No^ no, he will and must love thee of force, since thou have grante^ him his
life of free will: he will like the^ in thy youth, and honor thee in thine
age: he will be the port of prosperity wherein thou may rest, and the haven
o^ happiness, wherein thou may harbor without harm: so that thou may say
of him, as Andromache said by Hector, Tu Dominus, tu vir, tu mihi frater ^ri^.

Yea but Myrania, yet look before ^hou leap, and learn by other men's harms
to beware, Ariadne loue^ Theseus, fr^ed from him the monstrous Mynotau^e,
taught him to pass the Laberinth, yea forsook Parents and Country for his
cause, and yet the guerdon he gave her for her good will, was to leave her a
d^solate wr^tch in a desert wilderness.

Medea and Jason from the danger of the Dragons, and yet she found him
trothlesse: Phillis ha^ bored Demophon, and Dydo, E^^as, yet both repayed their
love with hate.

Tush the ^ai^e ^ower ha^^ not ^he^ best sent: the Lapidaries choose not the
stone by the outward color, but by the secret ve^tue: Paris was fair, yet
false: Thie^tes was beautiful, but deceitful, Vulcan was car^ed in white
Iuory yet a Smith.

The p^ecious ston^ of M^saulous sepulch^r, could not make the dead carca^^e
swe^t. Beauty Myrania is not always accompanied with virtue, honesty and
constancy: but often times fraught with ^ice, and ^^ri^ry. What then? if some
were T^aytors, shall Arbas^o be tro^hlesse? if some we^^ fa^se, shall he be
^ai^hlesse? no, his beatle and virtue has won me: and he himself shall wear^
me: I will forsake Father, ^riends, and Country, for his cause: ^ea, I will
venture (...) and life to free h^^ from danger, in despigh^ of froward Fortune,
and the destinies.

CHAP. 6. Myrania in love with Arbasto^ contriueth his delivery out of prison
by a secret policy.
MYrania being thus resolute in her opinion, began to cast beyond the Moon,
and to frame a thousand devises in her h^a^ t^ bring her purpose to pass,
fearing every shadow^ doubting every wind, stumbling a^ ^he least straw, yet at
the last pricked forward by fancy, she thought to prevent al^ cause of fea^^ ^n
this wise.

The evening before she meant to atchieu^ her enterprise, she secretly sent for
the Iaylor by one of her maids, to whom she durst commit ^er secret affairs,
who being taught by her mistress to play her part cunningly, brought the
Iaylor into Myranias chamber by a p^^^^rne gate, so that they were neither
seen nor suspected of any: wh^re he no sooner came, but he was courteously
entertained of the young Lady, who faining that she had to debate wi^h ^im of
weigh^ie affairs, called him into her closet, where treading vp^n a fal^^
board, he fell up to the shoulders, not being able to help himself, but that
he there ended his life.

Myrania having desperately atchie^ed this deed, ^h^e strait sought ^ot to rob
him of his coin, but to bereave him of his keys, which after she had got^en,
and conveyed his carcass into a s^^ret place^ she went in her night gown,
accompanied only with her maid to the prison.

Arbasto and Egerio hearing the doors o^^n at such an unaccustomed hour,
began straight to conie^ture, that P^lorus sought to murder them secretly,
least his own people should accuse him o^ cruelty: but as ^hey looked to have
seen the Iaylor, they spi^d Myrania in her night gown: which sudden and
unlooked for sight so appaled their senses, as they were driven into a maze,
till Myrania wakened them from th^i^ dumps with this sugared harmony.

I perc^iue A^basto, that my presence does make th^e to muze, and my sudden
ariuall has driven thee into a maze: what strange w^nd should la^d me in this
coast. In tr^th thou may think either my message is great, or my modesty
little, either that I take small care of my self, or repose very great trust
in thee, who at a time unfit for my calling, have without any guard come to a
stranger, a captive, yea and my fathers fatal^ foe. I confess it is a fault if
I were not ^orst: but seeing that necessity has no law. I think I have the
less^ broken the law. But to leave off these needless preamble^, where d^lay
breeds no less danger then death: know this Arbasto, that since thy first
arrival at my Fathers Court, my eyes have been so dazzled with the be^mes of
thy beauty, and my mind so snare^ with view of thy virtues, as tho^ only art
the man, whom in heart I love and like: seeing thee therefore drowned here by
aduers^ Fortune, in most hapless ^istresse, willing to manifest the loyalty
of my love in effect, which I have protested in words, I have rather chosen to
hazard both my life and honor, than not to offer thee peace, if thou will agree
unto the conditions. As my Father has wrought thy woe, I will work thy weal:
as he has sought thy bale, I will procure thy bliss: from pe^urie I will set
thee in prosperity. I will free th^^ from prison, from danger, yea from death
it self, I will in yielding to love, dissent from nature, to lea^e my Father,
friends, and Country, and pass with thee into De^marke. And to cut off
speeches, which might seem to savor either of flattery, or deceit: as thou
art the first unto whom I have vowed my love, so thou shall b^ the la^^,
requiring no meed for my merit, nor no other gue^don for my good will, but that
thou will take me to thy wife, and in pledge of my truth, see here the keys,
and all other things provided for our sp^edi^ passage.

Myrania had no sooner uttered these words, but my mind was so ra^ished, as I
was driven into an extas^e for joy, seeing that the terror of my death was
taken away with the hope of life, that from hea^inesse, I should ^e ^^stored to
happiness, ^^d from most careful misery, to most secure fel^citie, I
therefore ^ramed her this answer^.

Ah Myran^a, ^he purest Cincelle ^^ineth brightest when it has no oil, and
truth delights when it is apparelled worst. Flatter I will not^ faithful I
^ust be willed from the one by conscience, and driven to the other by your
c^^^esie, which by how much the less I have meri^ed it by desert, by so much
the more I am bound to requit^ it b^ duty. To decipher in colour^d discourses,
and to paint out with curious sha^o^es, how ^u^bly I accept of your o^fer, and
how ^reatly I think my self beholding to the Gods, for blessing me with such
an happy chance, what my loyalty and truth shall be, were but to prove that
which your Ladyship, hoping of my constancy, has not put in question. The
guerdon you crave for your good will is such, that i^ your courtesy had not
forced me to it by constraint, ye^ your beauties and virtues are so great, as
fancy would have compelled me by consent. Myrania, what thou can wish in a
true and trusty Lover, I promise to perform, swearing unto thee, that the
^louds shall flow against the streams, the earth shall mount against his
course, yea my carcass shall be consumed unto dust and ashes, before my mind
shall be found disloyal, and to this I call the Gods to witness, of whom I
desire no longer to li^e, than I mean simply to love.

Oh Arbasto (quoth she) would God I had never seen thee^ or that I may find
thy works according to thy words, otherwise shall I have cause to wish I had
been more cruel, or less courteous. But love will not let me doubt the
worst, but bids me hope the best: yet thus much I may say, when Jason was in
danger, who more faithful? when Theseus feared the Labyrinth, who more loyal?
when Demophon suffered shipwreck, who more loving? but I will not say what I
think Arbasto, because thou shall not suspect I fear^.

Madam^ (quoth Eger^o) Arbasto is my sovereign, and I both honor and ^eare
him as a subject, yet if he should but once in heart think to be disloyal
to Myrania, the Gods confound me with all earthly plagues, if I would not of a
trusty friend, become his mortal foe.

It is easy to persuade her Egerio (quoth she) who already is most willing to
believe, let us leave therefore these needless protestations, and go to the
purpose, delay breeds danger, time t^rrieth for no man, speed in necessity is
the best spur, let us have therefore till we get forth of France, least if we
be prevented, it breed my mishap, and your fatal misery.

Upon this we stayed not, but shutting the prison close, got covertly out of
the City, passing throu^^ France with many fearful perils, which to
rehearse, were^^^he, needless, or ^ootlesse: suffice this, we at last happily
arrived at Denmark, where how I was welcomed home with triumphs, were too
long to rel^te. But how P^lorus was perplexed, after he knew of our happy
departure, thou^h (God ^ot) most hapless unto him, I refer to thy ^ood
consideration to conjecture. The old man fretted not so fast in his m^lancholy,
but Doralicia chased as much in her choler, blaspheming bitterly both against
me and her sister Myrania: but as words break no bones, so we cared the less
for her scolding, fearing not the noise of the piece as long as we were without
danger of the shot. Well, leaving them to their dumps to us again which floated
in delight: ^cki^ Fortune having now hoysed us up to the top of her inconstant
wheel^, seeing how car^lesse I slumbred in the cradle of securiti^, thought to
make me a very mirror of her mutabilitie, for she began a fresh to turn my
ty^pet on this wise.

As daily I flattered Myrania, for fancy her I could not, promising with speed
to call a Parliament for the confirmation of the marriage, I still felt the
s^umpes of the old love I bare Doralicia to stick in my stomack^, the more
closely I covered the sparks, the more the flame burst forth, I found absence
to increas^ affection, not to decrease fancy: in the day my mind dot^d of her
virtues, in the night I dreamed of her beauty: yea, Cupid began to encounter
m^ with so fresh canmizados, as by distance my distress was far more
augmented, such sighs, such sobs, such thoughts, such pains and passions
perplexed me, as I felt the last assault worse then the former battery. If I
loved Doralicia in France, I now liked her thrice better being in Denmark. If
in presence her person pleased me, now in absence her perfection more contented
me. To conclude, I swear to my self with a solemn sigh. Doralicia was, is,
and shall be the mistress of my heart in despite of the froward destinies:
yet amazed at mine own^ ^olly, I began thus to muse wi^h my self.

O foolish Arbasto, nay rather frantike fondling, have thou less reason then
unreasonable creatures? the Tiger flies the train, the Lion escheweth the
n^ts, the Dear auoydeth the coyles, because they are taken with these
instruments, and art thou so mad, as having escaped pikes, wilfully to thrust
thy self into peril? The child being burnt ha^eth the fire, but thou being
an old fool, wilt with the worm Naplitia no sooner come out of the coals,
but leap into the flame. But alas what then: I see the measure of love is to
have no mean, and the end to be euerlasting^ that to love is allotted to all,
but to be happy in love, c^ntent to feel^ why, shall I be so mad to love
Doralicia, or so frought with ungrateful perjury, as not to like My^ania? the
one has crossed me with bitter girds, the other courted me wi^h sweet
glaunces. Doralicia has rewarded me with disdaine^ Myran^a entreated me with
desire, the one has saved my life, the other sought my death. O Arbasto thou
see the best, but I fear like to follow the worst. Alas I cannot but love
Doralicia, what then? what res^eth for me to do, but to dy^ with patience,
seeing I cannot live with pl^asure: yea Arbasto, die, die, rath^r wit^ a secret
scar, than an open scorn, for ^ho^ m^ist well su^, but never shall thou have
good success^. And yet Lions ^awne when they ar^ clawed: the most cruel Tigers
stoop when they are tickled: and Women, though never so obstinate, y^^l^ when
they are courted. There is n^ Pearl^ so hard, but vinegar breaks: n^ Diamond
so stony, but blood molli^^eth, no heart so stiff, but love weakeneth: what
though Doralicia sought thy death, perhaps now ^he repent^, and will give thee
life^ though at the ^^rst she cast thee a stone, she will now throw thee an
apple. Why then Arbasto assault her once again with a fr^sh charge, seek to
g^t that by Letter^, which thou could not gain^ by talk, for one line is of
more ^orce to persuade, then a ^oneths par^e, for in writing, thou may so set
down thy passions, and her perfections, as ^^^e shall ha^^ cause to think
well of thee, and better of her self, b^t yet so warily, as it shall be hard
for her to judge whether thy love b^ more faithful, or her beauty amiable.

CHAP. 7. Arbasto strangely transported with Doralicia^ love, forgets
Myranias kindness, and sends covertly to Doralicia, who again denies him.
Having thus determined with my self, though as covertly as I could to
conc^al^ my ^affaires, least either Myrania or Egerio should spy my halting, I
pri^^ly sent an Ambassad^ur to Pelo^us, to entreat for a contract between us,
and also to cra^e his ^aughter Doralicia in marriage, promising to send him
Myrania safe upon thi^ consent, and withal I framed a Letter to Doralicia to
this effect.

Arbasto, to the fairest Doral^cia, health.
SUch and so extreme are the passion^ of love ( Doralicia) that the more they
are quenched by dis^^ses, the g^^^t^r flames is increased by desire, and the
more they are gall^d wi^h hat^, the more they gape after love, like ^o the
stone Tapozon, which being onc^ kindled, burn^th most veh^mently in the water.
I speak ^his (the greater is my gri^fe) by proof and exp^rience, for having
my heart sco^ched with the beams of thy beauty, and my mind innamed wit^ t^y
singular v^rtue, neither can thy bitter l^^kes abat^ my love, nor extreme
discourt^^^^ diminish my affection. No Doralici^, I am not he that will leau^
the sweet Englantin^ because it pricks my finger, and refuse the gold in the
fire because it burnt my hand, for the mind^ of a faithful lover, is neither to
be daunted with ^espight, nor affrighted with daun^er: but as the Loadstone,
what wind^ so^uer does blow, t^rneth always to the North, so the love of
Arbasto is evermore bent to the beauty and virtue of Doralicia, whatsoever
misfortune happens. Y^^, i^ fares with me as with the herb Bas^ll, the
which the mo^e it is crushe^, the sooner it springs, ^r the pur^ spice, which
the more it is pounded, the sweeter it ^^^^leth, or the Camomill, which the
more it is trodden with the fee^e, the more it flourishe^h: so in these
extremities, beaten (...) to the ground with disdain, yet my love reaches to
the top of the house with hope. ^it^ then Doralicia, thy beauty has (...) the
sore, let thy bounty apply the salve, as thy virtue has caused my malady, so
let thy merci^ gi^^ the medicine, repay not my constancy with cru^lti^, requit^
not my love with hate, and my d^sir^ with d^spight, least thou procure my
speedy death, and thy endless infamy. Thus hoping thou will hau^ some remorse
of my passions, I attend ^hy friendly s^ntence, and my ^atall destiny.

Thine ever, though never thine, Arbasto,


AS soon as I had written my Letter, I dispatched the Messenge^ as speedily and
priu^ly as might be, who within the space of thre^ weeks ar^iued at Orleance,
where delivering his Embassage to Pelorus, and my Letter to Doralicia, he
stayed for an answer the spac^ of ten days, in which time, Pelorus
consulting with his Councel^ wa^ very willing to grant me his dau^ht^r in
m^rriage, but that by no mean^s he could win the good will of Doralicia,
seeing there^^re no perswas^^^^ could prevail, he dispa^cht my messenger with
denial, and Doralicia returned me this froward answer.

Doralicia ^o Arbasto.
Where did thou learn^ ^ond ^oole, that being forbidden to be ^in^, thou
sho^ld^st grow impu^ent? that willed to leave off thy sut^, yet thou shoulde^^
be import^n^te? do^st tho^ think with the Span^^^, by ^awning when thou art
beaten, to make thy foe, thy ^ri^nd? ^o, let ^ther^ deem of thee what they
list, I will count thee ^ c^r. Do tho^ think^ I will be drawn by thy
coun^erfait conceits, a^ the straw by the Iet, or as the g^ld by the mineral
Chrisocalla? No, no, if thou s^ekest to obtain ^auour at my hands, thou doe^^
strive to wri^g water out of the Pummice, and do^^ work the means to increase
^hine own s^ame and severity: for as by instinct of nature, there is a secret
hate, between^ the Uine and the Cabbish, betw^ene the Bore and the Goord, and
be^weene the iron and the Theamides, so in my mind I feel a secret grudge
between Arbasto and Doralicia: cease then to gape for that thou shall never
get, and take this both f^r a warning and an answer: For if tho^ prosecute thy
suit, tho^ do but pers^cute thy self, seeing I am neither to be woed with
thy passion^ whilst thou live, nor to repent me of my rigor when thou art
dead. For I swear, that I will never consent to love him, whose sight (if I
may say with modesty) is more bitter unto m^ than death. Short I am though
sharp, for I love not to ^atter, take this therefore for thy f^rewell, that I
li^e to hate thee.

Willing after death, if it could be, thy foe, D^ralicia.


After that the Messenger was returned to Denmark, and that I had received and
read the Letter, such sundry ^houghts assailed me, that I bec^me almost
^ranticke: ^eare, despaice, grie^e, ^^te, choler, wra^h, desire of re^enge,
and what not, so torment^d my mind, that I fell ^o raging against the G^ds, ^o
r^^l^ng at Doral^cia, and to c^rsing of all ^^ma^ kind, concei^ing such an
extreme hate against her, as be^o^e I loved her not so hear^ily, as now I
loathed her hatefully, counting my self an ungrate wretch toward My^^ni^, and
calling to mind her bea^^ie and vert^e, her bounty and courtesy, I ^ell more
deeply in love with he^, than eu^r with Doral^cia, so that I could not spare
one glance from g^zing upon her person, nor draw my mind from musing on her
per^ect^on. But a sudden change, alas a sorrowful chance.

Myrania pe^ceiuing me sou^ed of these sorrowful dumps, began straigh^ without
casting any water, to conjecture my disease, and ^o sh^^^ ^t that, which indeed
she hit without any great aim. But as love is most suspicio^s, so she began to
doubt the worst, fe^^ing that as yet the ^eautie of Doralicia was not blotted
out of my mind^, searching therefore narrowly what she could either hear^ or
learn of my secret^, a^ last she foun^ out that which wrought he^ final
mishap, and my fatal misery. For by lucklesse chance, leaving the door of my
closet open, Myrania thinking to find me at my Muses, stumbled on the coppie
of my Letter, which I sent to Doralicia, and upon the answer which I received
from that ruthlesse Minion. which after she had read, perceiving how
traitorously I had requited her love with hate^ she conuey^d ^er self covertly
into her Chamber, where, after she had almost dimmed her sight with floods of
tears, and burst her heart with blowing sighs, she fell into these complaints.

O unfortunate Myrania, O hapless Myrania, yea, O thrice accursed Myrania,
whom Fortune by spite seeks to soil, whom the destinies by fate are
appointed to plague, and whom the gods by justice will and must most cruelly
revenge. Thou have been a paricide to thy father, in seeking to destroy him by
thy disobedience: thou art a traitor to thy Country, in saving the enemy of
the Commonwealth, and thou art a foe to nature, in loving disloyal Arbasto:
and can the Gods but plague those monstro^s injuries? No, no Myrania, thou have
deserved more mishap then either Fortune can, or will afford thee. Ah cruel
and accursed Arbasto, I see now that it fares with thee, as with the Panther,
which having made one astonished with his fair sight, seeks to devour him
with bloody pursuit, and with me poor wench, as it does with them that view
the Basiliske, whose eyes procure delight to the looker at the first glimpse,
but death at the second glance. Alas, was there none to like but thy foe? none
to love but Arbasto? none to fancy but a perjured Dane? none to match with but
a flattering mate. Now has thy lawless love gained a lucklesse and: now thou
triest by experience, that the tre^ Alpin^ is smooth to be touched, but bitter
to b^e tasted: that the fairest Serpent is most infectious, the ^^est color
soonest stained, the cleerest glass most brittle, and that lovers, though they
bear a delicate show, yet they have a deceitful substance: that if they have
honey in their mouths, yet they hau^ gal^ in their hearts: the more is the
pity, in thee to tru^t without trial, and the great^ impiety for him to be
a traitor, being so well truste^.

Is this this the ^urte^^e of Denmark toward friends, to entreat them so
dis^ightfull^? is my goodwil not only rejected without cause, but also
dis^ained without color? Alas what shall I do to this extremity being a
forlorn wretch, in a foreign Country? which wa^ shall I turn me, of whom
shall I seek remedy? Pelorus will reject me, and why should he not? Arbasto
has re^^cted me, and why should hee^ the one I have offended wish too much
grief, the other I have served with too great good will: the one is lost with
love, the other with hate: Pelorus, because I cared not for him: Arbasto,
because I cared for him, but alas too much. And with that she fetch such a
sigh, as witnessed a heart pained with most intolerable passions, yea car^ and
grief so fiercely and freshly assaulted her, as sh^e fell into a fever,
refusing all sustenance, wishing and calling for nothing but death.

While she thus p^ned away with grief, I thought to search out her sore, but
I could not p^rceiue the cause of her sorrow, only I did conjecture this, that
she doubted my Nobles would not consent to our marriage: to ^id her therefore
of this care, I presently called a Parliament, where without any great
controversy it was concluded.

This news being come to the ears of Myrania, it no whi^ decreased her dolor,
but did rather far the more augment her distress, which made Egerio to muse,
and dra^e me into a great maze: so that accompanied with my Nobles, I went to
comfort her, and to carry her news, that if she could but come into the
Chamber of her presence, she should there be crowned Queen. But alas, when I
came and saw her ^o altered in one w^^ke, wasted to the hard bones, more like a
ghost ^han a living creature, I began thus to comfort her.

Ah Myrania quoth I) more loved of me than mine own life, and more dear unto
me^ than my self, would God I might be plagued with all earthly diseases, so I
might see thee free from distress: how can Arbasto be without sorrow to see
Myrania oppressed with sickness? how can he but ^inke in calamity, to see
her but once touched with care? alas, unfold unto me thy sore, and I will apply
the salve, make me^ privy to thy malady, and I will procure a med^cine: If
want of wealth work thy worcester, thou have the kingdom of Denmark to dispose at
thy pleasure: if absence from friends, thou have such a friend ^f thy loving
spouse A^basto, as death it self shall never dissolve our love.

I had no sooner uttered this word, but Myrania, as one possessed with some
hellish fury, start up in her bed, with staring looks, and wrathful
countenance, seeming by her raging gestures to be in a frenzy^: but being kept
down by her C^^es, she roared out these hateful curses.

O vile wretches (quoth she) will you not suffer me in my life to revenge my
self on that perjured traitor Arbasto, yet shall you not deny me but after
death my ghost shall torment him with ga^^ly vi^^ons. O thrice accursed
caiti^e, do thou seem to help me with thy scabbard, and sec^etly hurt me
with thy sword: do thou offer m^e honey openly, and privily present me with
gall? do thou say thou wilt cure me with love, when thou seek to kill me
with hate? have I redeemed thee from mishap, and will thou requite me with
misery? wa^ I the means to save thy life, and will thou without cause procure
my death? have I forsaken my Country, betrayed my Father, and yet will thou
kill me with discurtes^e? O hapless Myrania, could not Medeas mishap have made
thee beware? could not Ariadnes ill luck have taught thee to take hee^? could
not Phillis mis^fortune have feared thee from the like folly: but thou must
like and love a straggling stranger? Aye m^ that repentance should ever come too
late: folly is sooner remembered then redressed, and time may be repented, but
not recalled.

But I see it is a practice in men to ^aue as little care of their own ^^thes,
as of their Ladies honors, imitating Jupiter, who never kept ^ath he swear to
Juno, did thou not false Arbasto protest with solemn vows, when thy life
did hang in the balla^c^, that thy love to Myrania should be always loyal,
and have thou not since sent and sued secretly, to win the good will of
D^^alicia? did thou not swear to take me to thy mate, and have thou not
since sought to contract with her a new match? thou did promise to be true
unto me, but have proved trusty unto her: what should I say, thou have
presented her with pleasant drinks, and ^^ysoned me with bitter potions, the
more is my penury, and the greater is thy perjury. But vil^ wretch, do
thou think this thy villainy shall be unrevenged. No^ no Egerio, I hope the
Gods have appointed thee to revenge my iniu^ies, thou have sworn it, and I
fear not but thou will perform it. And that thou ma^st know I exclaim not
without cause, see here the Letters which have passed between this false
traitor and Doralicia.

The sight of these Letters so galled my guilty conscience, as I stood as one
astonished, not knowing what to do, excuse my self I could not, confirm my
love I durst not, yet at last the water standing in mine eyes, clasping her
hand in min^, I was ready to crave pardon, if she had not prevented me with
these injurious speeches.

Clear thy false trayte^^^ Arbasto thou can not persuade me^ thou shall not,
for^iue thee I will not, cease therefore to speak for in none of these thou
shall speed. Eger^o I saved thy life, then reueng^ my death, and so content I
die, yet only discontent in this, that I cannot live to hate Arbasto so long
as I loved him.

And with that turning upon her left side, with a gasping sigh she gave up the
ghost which sight drove me into such a desperate minde^ that if Egerio and the
rest had not holden me, I had sent my soul with he^^ to the grave.

CHAP. 8^ After Myranias death, Doralicia relenteth, and sends to Arb^sto,
who then hated her as much as he loved her before.
AFter Myranias death, being carried by force to my b^d, I lay for certain
days oppressed with such sorrow, as if I had been^ in a tranc^, cursing and
accusing my self of ingratitude, of perjury, and of most despightfull
disloyalty, I lay perplexed with inc^^^ant passions.

W^ll, this heavy and hapless news being noysed in France, Pelorus taking the
death of his daughter to heart^ in short time died, leaving Doralicia the only
inh^ritour of his kingdom.

But yet see how Fortune framed up this tragedy, who meant t^ ca^^ Doralicia
from most happy felicity, to most hapless miseri^: for she seeing that no
sini^^er chance could change my affection, that neither the length of time, nor
the distance of place, the spite of Fortune, the fear of death, nor her most
cruel discourt^si^, could diminish my lou^: musing I say, on this my
inviolable constancy, Cupid meaning to reu^ng^, seeing her now at discouert,
drew home to the head, and struck her so deep at the heart, as in despite of
Vesta she veiled bonnet, and gi^ing ground, sobbed forth secretly to her self
these words: Alas I love Arbasto, and none but Arbasto.

Venus seeing that her boy had so well played the man, began to triumph over
Doralicia, who now was in her dumps, striving as yet between love and hate,
till fancy s^t in her foot, and then she yielded up the bulwark in these
peaceable terms.

Why how now Doralicia (quoth she) do thou dream or dote? Is it folly or
frenzy: melancholy or madness, that drives thee thus into dumps, and so
strangely distresseth thee with dole^? what ^on^ thoughts, what unacquainted
passions: what slumbring imaginations are these which perplexeth thee? have
thou now ^^ele fire to spring out of the co^d flint? heat to ^ry or (...) the
chilling frost? love to come from hate, an^ desire from dis^^ine? Do thou
fare as though thou had been drenc^ed in the River Iellus in Phrig^a? which
at the first br^edeth sorrow through extreme cold, but forthwith burns the
sinews t^rough raging heat? Has V^^us now in despite of Vest^ made th^e
veil ^onnet? the more (poor wench) is thy mishappe, and the w^rse i^ thy
fortune: for love (though never so sweet) cannot yet h^ dige^ted without a
most sharp sauce: faring like the gold that is never p^^ect till it has past
through the furnace^

Love Dolaricia, but whom do thou love, Arbas^o: what the man whom even now
thou did s^ deadly hate? have thou so little force over thy affections, as
to fancy thy ^oe? No, no, fond fool, Arbasto is thy friend, and one that
honoreth thee as a Saint, and would seru^ thee as his sovereign, that loves
and likes thee as much as thou can desire, but more than thou do deserve,
who being bitterly crossed with discurtes^e, could never be touch^d of
inconstancy: but still remains like to Aristo^les Quadratus, which howsoever
it is turned always stands steadfast. Thou can not then of conscienc^
Doralicia, but repay his love with liking, and his firm fancy with mutual
affection: he is beautiful to please the eye, v^rtuous to content the mind:
rich to maintain thy h^nour, of birth to counteruaile thy parentage, wise,
courteous, and constant, and what would thou ^aue more?

Yea but alas I have rejected his service, and now he will not respect my
suit: I have detested him, and now he will despise me: I have requited his
good will with cruelty, and he will revenge me wit^ cont^mpt.

Better had thou then conceal it with grief, than reue^le it t^ thine own
shame: for if thou aim at the white and miss the mark, thou shall be pointed
at of those that hate thee, pitied of those that love thee, scorned at by him,
and talked of by all: suffer rather then (poo^^ Doralicia) death by sil^nce,
than diris^on by revealing thy s^crets, for death cutte^h off all care, but
decision bre^deth endless calamity.

Tush do tho^ think Arbasto can so harden his heart, as to hate thee, so
ma^^^r hi^ a^fections as to flee from fancy, that he will become so proud as to
r^fus^ thy pr^ffer? No, if thou sendest him but one line, it will more harm
him, then all Circes enchantments: if thou lendest but one friendly look, it
will be more esteemed than li^e. Why, but Doralicia^ and with that she sat
still as one in a ^rance, building castl^s in the a^re, ha^ging be^w^en^ fear
and hope, trust and disp^i^e, doubt (...)elfe th^rfor^ from these ^umps, she
took her Lu^e, whereupon (...) this ditt^e: IN time we see that silver drops
The craggl^ stones make soft^
The slow^st ^n^ile in time, we see,
Does cree^e and climb alo^t.
With feeble puffes the tallest pine
In tract of time does fall^
The hardest heart in time does yield
To Venus luring call.
Where chilling frost alate did nip,
There flasheth now a fire:
Where deep disdain bred noisome hate,
There kindles now desire.
Time causes hope to have his hap,
What c^re in time not easd?
In time I loathed that now I love,
In both content and pleased.


Doralicia having ended her dittie, laid down her Lute, and betook her to her
former passions, wherein she had not long plodded, but she determined to write
unto me with as much speed as might be, framing her Letters to this effect.

Doralicia to Arbasto, health.
VVEighing with my self ( Arbasto) that to be unjust, is to offer injury to
the Gods, and that without cause to be cruel, is against all conscience: I
have thought good to make amends for that which is amiss, and of a fained foe,
to become thy faithful friend: for since the receipt of thy Letters, calling
to mind the perfection of thy body, and perfectnes of thy mind, thy beauti^
and virtue, thy curtes^e and constancy, I have been so snared with ^ancy, and
fettered with affection, as the Idea of thy person has p^^^hed me with most
hapl^sse passions.

If I have been recklesse of the (...) will, (...) m^, if ruthlesse through
cruel speeches, I (...) now, that of late I loathed, and desiring (...) even
n^w I ^^spis^d, which a^ often as I call to mind, I can not but blush to my
self for shame^ and fall out with my self for anger.

But the purest Diamond is to be cut before it be worn^, the Frankincense is
to be burnt before it be smelt, and Lou^rs are to b^ tried before they be
trusted, least, shining like the Carbuncle, a^ though they had fire, yet being
touched, they prove passing cold, for the mind by trial once scowred of
mistrust, becomes more fit ever after to belief: so that Arbasto, as I have
pined thee with bitter pills, I will now pamper thee with sweet potions: as I
have galled thee with cruelty, I will heal thee with courtesy: yea, if thy
good nature can forget that which my ill tongue does repent, or thy most
constant kindness forgive that my unbridled fury did commit, I will
counteruaile my former discurtesie with ensuing constancy, I will be as ready
after to take an injury, as I was to give an offense, thou shall find my love
and duty such and so great, as ^ither Doralicia can perform, or Arbasto
desire. And thus committing my life and my living into your hands. I attend
thine answer^, and rest more thine than her own.

Doralicia.


The Messenger by whom she sent this message, making spend to perform his
Mistress command, arrived within few days at Denmark, where delivering me
the Letter, I was greatly amazed at the sight thereof, musing what the contents
should be, at last vnripping the se^les, I perceived to what Saint Doralicia
bent her devotion, but the shower came too late when the grass was withered:
yet I stood for a time astonished, houering between love and hate. But at the
last such loathsome misliking of her former discurtesie so incensed my land,
that to displease her, and to despite For^une, I returned her speedily this
hateful answer.

To Doralicia^ neither health nor good hap.
I Received thy Letter Doralicia, which no sooner I read with mine ^ye, but I
threw into the fl^^ wi^h my hand, least by viewing them I should grow into
great fury, or by keeping them show ^hee any friendship. For we shun the
place of pestilence for fear of infection, the looks (...) the Catharis
because of diseases: the eyes of the Cockatrice for fear of death, Ci^^es
drinks are dreadful charms, and Sirens t^nes doubting inch^^^^ments: should
I not then eschew thy alluring baits, when thou have galled me with the hook?
ye^ I will, and must, least I be intrapped with thy sub^ilt^e, or entangled
with thy sor^erie. Truly Doralicia that once I loved thee I cannot deny, that
now being free I should fall to such folly, I more than vtt^rly refus^, for as
before I liked thee in constant hope, so n^w I lo^th thee wi^^ ^^t^full
co^^empt, comparing thy cursed nature to the herb Basil, which both
ingendereth Serpents, and kills them: so the show of thy virtue inflamed me
with love, but the try^ll of thy vanity has q^^^ched it with hate. Hate, yea,
I more then hate thee, most cruel and ungrateful monster, whose beauty I
hope was given thee of the Gods, as well to procure thine own misery, as
others mishap, which if I might live to see, as Infortunio did by Eriphila, I
would think I did lead my hapless^ life to a most happy end. Thus thou see
how I account of thy love and accept of thy Letters, esteeming the one filthy
cha^^er, and the other as forged charme^, and saying to the^ both, that
pr^ffered service stink^. Want more wind I will not, to sp^^d more time is most
ill spent, therefore take this as a farewell, that if I hear of thy good hap,
I live displeased, if of thy misfortune, content, if of thy death, most
sorrowful, that the Gods did not give thee many days, and much distress: so
wishing thee what ^pight either Fortune or the Fates can afford. Adieu.

Sworn thy foe till death. Arbasto.


CHAP. 9. Doralicia having received Ar^astoes unkind answer, dies of a
Frenz^e: and Arbasto is banished his Kingdom.
DOralicia having received these Letters, and read the contents, was so
impatient in her passions, that she fell in to a Frenzy, having nothing in her
mouth but Ar^^^^o, A^b^sto, ever doubling thi^ word with such pitiful cries
and scrich^s, as would have moved any but me to remors^: she continued not in
this case long before she died. But I alas leading a loathsome life, was mo^^
(...) crossed by fortune, for Ege^io c^nspi^ing with the (...) of my Realme^ in
short time by civil wars disposses^ed me of my Crown and Kingdom. Forced
then to (...) from mine own ^ubi^cts: after some travel I arri^ed at this
(...), where considering with my self the fickle inconstancy of unjust Fortune^
I have ever since lived content (...) this Cell to des^i^: ^ Fort^n^, one wh^^^
sor^owing for the mishap of Myrania, and another while ioying at the misery of
Doralicia: but always smiling that by contemning fortun^, I lear^e to lead her
in triumph. Thus thou have heard wh^ in mine estate I pass my days c^ntent:
rest therefore satisfied, that thus I have lived, and thus I mean to die.

FINIS.
