Composed by ROBERT JONES.

Quae prosunt singula, multa iuuant. LONDON Imprinted by John Windet 1607.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE LORD, ROBERT Earl of Salisburie, Vicount Cranborn,
Barron of Essingdon, Principal Secretary to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty, Master of the Courts of wards and Liueries, Chancellor of the most
famous University of Cambridge, Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter,
and one of his Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council.
PLato and Aristotle, the profoundest of their times, thought the best
education to be defective, without knowledge in Music, and Cicero reports,
that although Themistocles was endowed with many graces, yet was he the less
esteemed, being ignorant thereof, and such regard has all antiquity had
thereto that we not only find them to love, but practice it, for amongst the
rest, Saint Augustine records that S. Ambrose Bishop of Millan, who
ouerwatcht the Church, (then under persecution of the Arrians) intertainde the
time with songs and Music, and though the death of Nero, Tacit.
was exceeding joyful to the people, yet was it much lamented, that his
excellency in Music, should perish with him: which when I consider (Right
Honorable) together with the worthy approbation you have given to many
professors of the same. I am not only encouraged, still to practice, but
willingly to publish these songs, (as the badges of my affection) to all
posterity: And for, because those things are most embraced; which men find
approved, by the voice of greatness, I therefore, ambitiously thought it best,
to single out your Honor, being best able to protect them, hopefully assuring
my self, that your spirits, (which are incombred with many cares) may a
little be delighted in the hearing of these songs, which if they may attain,
I your Honors humble votarie, shall be highly fortunate, and thereby the rather
persuaded to live and die,

Your Honors most bounden, in all humble duty, ROBERT JONES.
