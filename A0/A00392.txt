A SERmon made: by the famous Doctor Erasmus of Roterodame.

In the second chapter of the Gospel of saint Johan.
A Marriage was made in Ca^ia a city of Galile, and Jesus mother was there /
And Jesus and his disyples were called unto the marriage / and when their wine
failed, Jesus mother said to him. they have no wine / Jesus said unto her,
woman what have I to do with the? mine hour is not yet come. his mother said
unto the mynysters. what soever he says unto you do it. There were sto^dynge
six water pottes of(...) one after the manner of the purificacion of the Jews:
Jesus said unto them fylle the water pottes with water, and they filled them up
to the hard brym / and he said unto them pour out now and bear unto the
ruler of the feast / and they bare it. When the ruler of ye feast had tasted
the water that was turned into wine, neither knew whens it was (but the
mynysters which drew the water knew) he called unto ye brydegrome, and said
unto him / all men at the beginning vsen to set forth the good wine, and
when men have dro^ken their fylle / then that, which is the worse, but thou
haste kept back the good wine hitherto.

I Can scacely with my tongue express, most derely beloved brethren, and
systren in Christ, how greatly it reioyseth me, and replenyssheth: and
fulfylleth my mind, all full of joy, and gladness: that I do se so great a
multitude, of you to be assemble here, and to have come together: and that with
so great alacryte, cherefulnes, and good will / to the solemn co^memoracyon
of our blyssed lady, both vyrgyn and mother. This affeccion of you toward the
mother: is devotion, and love toward the sone / it is a manner, and custom /
left to us of our old ancestors and Forefathers: upon the feastefull days,
to make some royal and costely feast, or dinner. Would god that I, which am a
father and herdesman having charge of souls might bring forth out of the
most rich and plentuous larder, or storehouse of holy scripture, to you,
Which are my sons and my sheep in our lord, some meat / which never will
perysshe / but fatteth and makes strong the minds of men into eternal life /
and also that I might bring forth the wine of the spyryte / which by a sobre
dronkennes may so chere and glad your hertes: that even in the very mids of
the trybulacyons and euyls of this world, you may always sing, give lauds,
and thanks unto the lord with spyrytuall hymns. Which albeit that he is
glorious in all his saints: yet in his most blyssed mother, he has
specially, or syngulerly above all other saints declared and (as it were)
powered out the riches of his glory. Let us therefore all together with our
common prayers call for that holy spyryte, which lyghtynge upon the most
blyssed virgyne Marye, did consecrate and make holy her young and tender
virgyns breast or bosom, a temple and tabernacle to the deuyne Trynyte / and
which made her vntouchyd womb the workehouse of that wonderful birth, which
brought f^^th to us Jesus christ the Sauyoure of the whole world desired and
looked for of all ages. First of all this is not unknown to you good Christen
people, that the honourynge and worshypyng of the most holy and blyssed
virgyne Marye consystyth and restyth pryncypallye or chefelye in.iiii. things
/ that is to wit, in lauds or praises / in honors / in calling upon her /
and in Imytacyon or following of her life / of the which.iiii. the last, that
is to wit the Imytacyon of her life, is so the most chief and pryncypall: that
without it all, the other.iiii. are vnfruytefull or unprofitable, and this one
also contains all the other.iiii. within it self / for that man has
suffycyently praised Marye / has suffycyently honored the blyssed virgyne
Marie / and also has suffycyently called upon Marie: who soever he be, which
to the vttermoste of his power does follow ye sobrenes / does follow ye
chastytie / does follow the humblenes and lowlynes of Marie / but they which
throw folysshe judgment / and clean out of order, cease not contynuallye to
sing, and to hepe lauds, and praises to Marie / they also which with wax
candellys / which with gifts, or obsacyons / which with churches, or
chapelles do honor her / and they which with long ambycio^s prayers callyth
upon her desiring her help and do not so much as one think of following her
life whom they do praise they stand in iopardye, lest the mother do say
unto them that, which the father says by the mouth of his prophet Esaye, to
the poeple of the Jews that worshypped him. This people honors me with
their lyppes / but their hertes be far away from me. Again yt also which
says to the same people in the gospel. Not all they that sayen to me master,
master shall enter into the kyngedome of heaven / but he that fulfylleth my
fathers will which is in heaven. Let this therefore most dearly beloved
brethren, and systers be our pryncypall study and care, to follow, as much as
we may, the virtues of the blyssed virgyn Marie in our manners, and
co^uersacyon of living lest she also may say to us / this people honor me
or worshype me with songs / with pypes / recordars / and other instruments of
musycke / with wax candels, and garlandes: but their heart is all set on
such things / which I have always hated with my sone Jesus: that is to wit /
on riches on pleasures / on sinful / and ungracious plays / vnfylthy tales /
and vnclenlye co^munycacyo^s / and on pride / they give to me ye pryncypal
seat or place in the churches, and in aulters / but within their own breasts
or minds they will geaunte me no seat or place at all / they sing and cry
to me Regina celi / domina angelorum / vita / dulcedo / et spes nostra / that
is to say, they call me queen of heaven / lady of angels / they call me their
life and swetnes / their hope and comfort / I am saluted every where / with
most honorable tytles or names / but not every one that says to me lady
lady, shall enter into the kingdom of my sone / but they only which following
the example of my sone, do obey the commandments of god / and which
endeuourynge them selves to express and counterfayte the example given of me
do labor to obtain the favor of my sone by following of his mother / in
whom what so ever thing is worthy to be followed: it is ye gift of the sone.
Let us not therefore suppose or believe, that the most holy vyrgyn has delight
or is pleased with such fastes wherewith some men upon certain days do honor
and worship her fasting only for this intent, that the next day following,
they may the more largely be made dronken: or that she has delight or pleasur
in those songs, which certain persons do sing unto her / which are most
corrupt with flesshely lust and ryote / or that she has delight in their
gifts and offerynges, which are on all sides defiled with fornycacyons and
adulteries. Not for that the most merciful vyrgyne does hate or turn away
her face from sinners / but who soever are asshamed and do repent them of their
fylthynes or sins, ar now no longer sinners / what soever thing is
dyspleasaunt or myslykynge to the sone: can not be pleasant or well liking to
the mother. I know that in some places the chapel of our Lady is set forth
(as it were to show) full of sylkes / silver / gold / and precious stones / so
that they which there do worship the vyrgyne, may seem to worship mammon or
riches / how much more acceptable and pleasant should it be to the blyssed
vyrgyn Marye, If such riches were bestowed and dealte forth in alms to the
reseuynge and socorynge of Christ's members / in whom the mother also with her
sone after a manner is either vexyd and afflycted, or else comforted relyued, and
refresshyd? If it like or pleas you so well to have an image of the blyssed
virgyne / let it be made after such manner, after which she her self pleased
almyghtye god / and let her be portred such manner one, as shall be a goodlye
thing for us to follow / that is to say, let there appear chastytye /
mekenes / and sobryetye / in the countenance or face / in all the state, or
behauyoure of the body / and also even in the very vesture or garments, and
apparel of her. Now I will in few words open / and declare unto you what
thing it is conuenyent, and mete to follow most pryncypallye, in the vyrgyn
Marie. But first I will admonysshe you in the way of charytye of this one
thing / that there can not be a more perfect, or a more sure rule, or form,
and example of holiness, and virtues life taken of any then of ye son: howbeit
this is undoubted / that there is nothing in ye mother: which swarueth, or is
dysagreynge from the doctrine of the sone. And here be now of attente minds,
geuynge audyence, and good head al your young both boys / and wenches / wives
/ and wydowes / married men / old men / and old women / there is none of you /
but you shall have somewhat that ye may follow in the blyssed vyrgyne: the
pryncypall points and as it were marks / whereupon we ought to have our iyes
stedefastlye set / and whereof we will now speak. Are these, her vyrgynall,
her maydenly behauour and symplenes joined / with most high prudence / her
most high felycytie joined with most perfect humylyte / her most high
chastytie in wedlock / the sedulytie, and dylygence of her in doing the
office, and duty of a mother: the passing great fortytude, and strenghe of
her mind in ye frail, and bretell womankynde. How greatly her mind / and
love was set on virgynyte / purytie / and clennes / it is euydente even
hereof / seeing that she was so troubled / and dysmayde at the coming in of ye
angel to her / as Luke Luc. 1.
tellyth in his gospel. No doubt of it she understood / and knew full well /
how great a treasure chastytie, or clennes is / but she perceived also again
/ how great hardenes / and dyffycultie it is to keep the said treasure / for
which so many men / with so many traynes / and wyles do lie in wait / and
which many one have lost before they knew how good a thing / and how great
a treasoure they had of it in their possessyon. Now how far are these
vyrgyns away from the example of ye blyssed vyrgn Marye / which wylfully and
of their own mind do ro^ne forth to play, and to have co^munycacyon / with
young men far unlike to the angel And which vyrgyns also with beckes and
signs with bourdes and merry conceytes / with flattering words and behauoure
/ with gestes / and lettres of love do provoke also yt thing / whereby they may
lease their vyrgynytie or maiden head. The blyssed vyrgyne Marye had an
husbonde with whom she lived in one house: and yet yt notwithstanding she was
trobled and dysmayde at the coming in of the angel in a strange and
unknown shape, that she had never sen before / and she feared al things even
those also wherein is no ieopardye at al. That she had been married unto an
husbonde / she did it because of the custom used among the people of the
Jews / and also to obaye the auctorytie and commandment of her parents /
and yet for all that on virgynytie was all her desire. This she declaryth
plainly her self when she says I know no man / for here the verb of the
present temps sygnyfyeth ye purpose of her mind. Many women ar kept from
uncleanness through the great fere that they have of infamye and loss of their
good name / but the blyssed vyrgyne Marye whiles for the love of chastyte and
cle^nes, she regards not the infamye of sterylytie and of being called a
barayne woman / which was accounted a great rebuke among ye Jews / she
deserved both.ii. of them / that is to wit, that she remaining still a
virgyne, should bring forth a child / being very god and very man / how
may they for shame say them selves to be the worshyppers of this virgyne /
which even in that time: in which they profess virgynytie, do use ungracious
wanto^nes, or else which being now old women / and paste child berynge /
yet nevertheless have delectacyon / and burning lust to pleasure of ye
flesh now being out of season for them? Now this that is shameful, and
unseemly in a woman is much more shameful in ye kind of men. Those that
desire to be taken for virgynes after the example of the blyssed virgyn Marie:
let them be hole / and in every point virgynes / for certain maids have
their bodies vntouchyd / or undefiled / but the tierynge or apparellynge of
them selves (not without medycynes payntynge I warrant you) to set forth them
self / and to cause them to appear beautyfull is unchaste / and unclean / they
use wanton lokes / city of the most blyssed virgyne / this was an euydent
argument and token seeing that though she loved syngulerly perpetual
virgynytie, yet of a simple mind / she being a young maiden lived in one
house with her young spouse or husband. Now harken somewhat of the wysdom of
this young virgyne / for folysshe virgynes the spouse refuses / and knows
them not / as it is read in the gospel. Mat. 25.
After yt the angel had saluted her / she does not forthwith salute him again
/ neither she lepyth out by an by: but quyetly abiding she co^syderyth and
thinks in her mind, Luc. 1.
what manner salutacyo^ yt might be / And again when the aungel had promised to
her / that she should bring forth so noble a child neither she mystrusteth his
promise / neither she is proud or over merye and glad therefore / but demurely
and discreetly she demands of the aungel / after what manner / or by what
means that thing should come to pass which he had promised unto her she not
losing the treasure of her virgynytie, whereupon was all her heart and desire
set / she had seen the concourse of the shepherdes / she had seen the
veneracyon and worship, which the three noble wise men that came out from far
countrees had done to her sone / she had hard also the prophecyes of Anna: and
Symeon, and yet for all yt she blabeth forth none of all these things (as the
most part of women would) but holdyng her tongue, she gathered all these
things together, and keeps them in her heart or mind / it is the most sure
token yt may be of wysdom, even in men also / yt they can keep secret to them
selves so great felycyte / whereof came this so great wysdom in a young virgyn,
in a tender damsel, having none experyence, and unbroken in the world? That
wysdom is an ouerlate and a wretched wysdom: which is gotten or comes to man
by long experyence of hurtes or euylles / the holy ghost does remplysshe and
fulfill even the mind of young wenches, and of young boys also with sage
prudence or wysdom / let every man purge or cleanse his own mind from vices:
that yt ghost the gyuer of wysdom may vouchesafe to enter into it. Now as
for the felycyte of the blyssed virgyne Marie, what need we to speak of it? who
was evermore worshypfully saluted and greted of an Angel? to whom was
evermore great or royal promyses brought? he that is ye maker of heaven and
earth sends an embassage unto the virgyne / Gabryell does the message / and is
maker of ye marriage, a child is promised unto her such one as was never before
nor since promised to any / he shall be (said the angel) great and shall be
called the sone of the highest, Luc. 1.
and the lord god shall give to him the seat of his father David and he shall
reygne over the house of Jacob for evermore, and of his kingdom shall be none
end. what more high promyses may be made then these? Now after that the
angel had brought her in such believe of the said promyses, trow you that
this so great felycyte did any thing mynysshe the humylyte or lowlynes of this
young virgyne? Forsothe it mynysshed it nothing at all / but rather increased
it. Behold (said she) the hand maid of the lord of this so great a busynes,
she challenged or took unto her self no part of the glory or praise, only
she professes and knowlegeth her self to be an hand maid obedyent and ready,
or well willing to all things / what soever it should please the lord to do
with her. Now when she was great with the heavenly child / she disdayneth not
for cause of good manner and curtesy to visyte her cosyn being an old woman and
great with child / her cosyn Elyzabeth said to her how chaunseth this to me yt
the mother of my lord does thus come to me / yet for all that she being always
like her self and contynuynge stylle one manner woman answered and said again /
for he has looked upon the low estate of his hand maid / she grau^teth and
speaks of her happynes / but she bosteth nothing her dignyte, neither she
says / all generacyons shall call me happy and blyssed, because I have deserved
it: by because he has done great things to me, which is of might and power
to do what soever he pleas / and she says not, and holy or glorious is my
name: but she said, and blyssed is his name / And albeit she knew well enough
that she had such a noble child in her womb: yet for all that she disdayneth
not, ne dispyseth her husband / what soever service any obedyent wife does to
her husband that same / much more habundau^tly did she to Joseph / she gothe
with him to the tax or cessynge / which Caesar had commanded with him she
bare the child to his Circuncision / with him she fynysshed all ye cerymonyes
of the Purificacion / she follows him into Egypt: For when they should have
admonycio^ to fle into Egypt ye angel appeared then not to Marie, but to
Joseph, that the auctoryte should be or rest in ye man. In their retornyng again
from Egypt, she cleaves to him and never departs from him, neither
disdayneth she to be comenly called ye wife of a carpenter / neither she is a
shamed of that love and poor or vile brethren and susters, or kynnesfolke /
neither she takes it grievously that her sone was accounted to be the sone of
Joseph / whom she her self also called the father of Jesus / thereunto was
never wife in this world / yt has more reverently obeyed her husband / then
did the mother of god / harken now ye women that do worship the most
blyssed virgyn Marie. What shall here those new wedded wives say: which being
proud of their beauty and youth dyspyseth and sets at naught their
husbands. what shall these matrones or dames say which often times among
casts in their husbands tethe the dowry and richesse which they brought to
him. Yea and also otherwhyles dryueth them out of the house: as if they were
ladies or mastresses / and not wives / what shall they say? which over turns
or destroys the hole house with chiding and brawling. The most blyssed virgyn
Marie with most reverence, and dread pleases, and obeys her husband
Joseph, she never gives to him froward answers / neither takes she upon her
at any time to rewle or master him: or to have her mind fulfilled before his /
and are you asshamed to obey and follow your husbands minds: without whom ye
ar barayn and without honor: and to whom also the auctoryte and commandment
of god and of the apostle Paul has made you subjects? And it is no doubt
but look how great reverence she used toward her husband / as great sedulyte
and dylygence she used in the keeping and bryngyng up of her sone / she leads
him every year ones to ye temple in Jerusalem to show that children should
learn in their tender age to love and worship god / when she had lost him
with how great care and dylygence does she seek him? And she never rests
until she does find him / what was ye blyssed virgyn Marie affrayde of any
mysfortune yt might come to her sone: had she seen any token of lyghtnes or
wyldnes in her sone / no verily none attall / but she taught you, yt be mothers
having children / and gave to you a lesson that you can never be dylygent
enough: and take so good head as ought to be taken unto your children in
their tender age / youth is frail and ready to follow and to be led into all
manner vice. They do worship Marie vndeuoutly who soeur be neclyge^t about the
bringing up of their children / as who should say, it were enough only to have
conceived them and borne them / ye moreover certain women there be / which by
wicked and unlawful crafts and means, do put from them selves the
yrksomenes of berynge their child / and the labors of gyuynge it suck. And
they offe^de or sin nothing less which with loud and ungracious example
gyuyng / infecten and corrupten the feeble young age / and which teaches
children vnthryftynes and vice / Before they can perfectly speak. The most
blyssed virgyn Marie she was very careful and dylygent about her sone Jesus /
and doste thou wylfully set out and betray thy sone and daughter / unto all
manners or kind of fylthynes a sin. Doubtless hereof it comes to pass /
that so many women repent them that ever they were fruytefull and not barayne /
because they bring up evil and noughtly ye children well borne / and yet to
have brought up or taught their child well: is the office more properly
belongyng to the father and mother / then to have begotte it / or to have borne
it / but how is it possible / for them to teach and bring up their children
well which either be not abydyng at home / or else which lives fylthely and
shamfully at home / so yt by the conuersacyon and company with their parents /
the children do learn fylthy co^munycacyon and rybaldry, do lerane wantones /
do learn to be dronkardes / and to be brawlers / to be dysers and carders to
be blabbes and full of idle and vain words / to be backbyters and
sclau^derers / and generally do lerane of them all manner vice and sin. But
here offreth it self unto us large matter / so speak of, if we would compare the
most excellent virtues of the most holy virgyn unto our manner of living / but
yet we shall take very much profit. If we shall study to amend our manners
which be corrupt upon every side / according to the example of this blyssed
virgyn. Now it rests, or remains to touch somewhat of ye fortitude, or
ghostly strenght of this virgyn: for both these be tokens of magnanimite, and
strong mind.

Neither to be proud, or high mi^ded in prosperyte: neither to be sad, and
let the heart fall in aduersyte. Albeit that the worshypfull name of Jesus
wexed famous / and he was so greatly spoken of for his so many and great
miracles don: yet we do never read that this most holy virgyn chale^ged ever or
took unto her self any portion or part of ye praise / yea moreover we scacely
read that she was present at any miracle: save only when at the brydall he
turned water into wine / she hard all things and she gathered them togtyher
in her heart and mind making no words / but alwyes bearyng the person of an
hand maid which she has professed her self to be. with like constaunce and
strong mind she took it: when her only sone and dearly beloved was often
times in ieoperdye by the reason of the Phariseys lyeng in wait for him / and
in co^clusyon. when he was taken, and was bound, when he was scourged, when he
was condemned and judged to death, and when he was led to be crucyfyed / the
other women wept / and they were rebuked of our lord / what felt she then in
her motherly breast or mind? she was not with out feeling or perceyuyng of all
things she sorowed and had compassyon with her sone / but she subdued and
kept under ye natural or carnal affeccion with the strenght of ye spyryte /
she kept in her sobbynges / she held back and kept in ye tears / which would
feign have braste out / and when all the other disciples were slypt and shronke
away from their master for fear / she only and John^ stood nere to the cross
of her sone. All those ar contumelyous pyctures and to the dishonor of our
lady / which representen or setten her forth falling to the ground and in a
swoune without any felyng or perceiving of her self / well nere deed for
sorrow / she neither cried out ne tare her hears / ne knocked her breast, ne
cried out calling her self wretched or unfortunate / she took more consolacyon
and conforte of the redempcyon of mankind / then she did heaviness or sorrow of
ye death of her sone / and in this point also she shows her self an hand
maid: according to her promise, unto him whose will and pleasure it was after
this manner to restore the kind of man / and she thought her self to have been
happily a mother, which had brought forth ye auctor of health and savior to the
world, she preferred ye publyke and comen felycyte before her own pryuate
sorrow or grefe where then be now those women which for ye loss of money /
or for a smaller hurt or dyspleasure do bring forth or cast their child
before the due time / for sorrow and care? where be these men which for the
death of their little daughter dystemperen all their hole houses with fond and
folysshe lamentynges / co^playnynges and wepynges. It is red that the most
blyssed virgyn Marie did behold and se the most bitter and cruel death of
her sone / but we read not any where that she wept and made lamentacyon: other
women wept / and for the lack or want of their lord taken from them / whom
they did not yet love spiritually / they were almost out of their wits and
besides them selves / Marie only, having a strong mind, holds her peace
abiding ye will and pleasure of god / peradventure you do suppose or judge it
but a mean thing and not so hyghly to be esteemed to become ye bond servant
or hand maid of the lord. Verily there is nothing more diffycyle or harder to
acheue and attain, for who soever has ones wholly given or put him self to
ye will and pleasure of the lord, gyuyng the praise only to him / if any wealth,
or good chance has been betyde him or looks for socoure or aid from no where
else, but only from him. If he be in dystresse or in aduersyte / that man can
not but stand styffe and vnabasshed for any wyles or fearful assaltes that
Satan can do or invent against him. But of these things parauenture we shall
at another time have oportunytie to speak more largelye. Now the solempnytie
of this day requires that we should pyke out somewhat or take some part of
the gospel which has been read to you: unto the glory of the sone and of the
mother: and to our ghostlye health and comfort / they which are all redye
married / or else which ar purpossed to be married / and desirous to have a mate
in wedlock gladlye / and with attente ears here this high honor to have been
given to matrymonye / and wedlock.

That christ with his dysyples and mother, when he was bydden to the brydeale
or marriage feast / refused not to go thither / but moreover vouchesafed to put
it to honor by doing so great a miracle at it / but for this cause ye lord him
self being a virgyne, and also the sone of a virgyn: ones has honored
matrymony / to the entente that we should not dyshonest it with our fyltynes,
or uncleanness / ye and even now a days also, where soever the man and wife are
joined together in chaste and faithful matrymonye with agreeable minds, and
with equal love and exercise of virtue there the lord Jesus dysdayneth not to
be present with his mother. Neither she is grieved to beseech and entreat her
sone for them: if any thing be wantynge to them, that which appertains to
the more pleasantness or iocundytye of them that are married / all though
their substance or richesse be never so slender or small / and though that
they have a great many of children / for that wine which Jesus gives, makethe
dulcet and sweet all things: be they else never so heavy / sorrowful and
paynfull. Moreover this thing also is to be marked, that as it is syttyng or
due that the children do obey and follow the will of their mother / so
likewise it is conuenyent and semely that the auctoryte of the parents do give
place to that which the gospel calls us / for in this nothing is to be
consyderyd or regardyd / but only what makes most to ye glory of god, and to
ye common soul health of the people. That his mother calling upon him does
say / they have no wine: it is a point of a certain loving sollicytude or
careful dylyge^ce / that she gives place to ye auctoryte of her sone /
answeryng here to outward apparaunce somewhat hardelye, or sharply in this
wise. Io. 2.
woman what have I to do with the / it is a point of certain wise humblenes
and mekenes: again yt she says pryuely to the mynysters, what soever thing
he shall say unto you / do it, it is a point of a certain trust and confydence
that she had in her sone. Now a days, certain fathers and mothers abusen
their auctoryte, that they have over their children: whiles they compel them
whether they will or not to entangle them self in wedlock or else in the
order of preesthode, or to put them self into some Relygyon / or else whiles
they draw them back from the preaching of the gospel / or whiles the father
or mother compels their sone being a prince or gouernoure to begin betayle
or war, which shallbe cause of great hurt or destruccyon to the common
weal. For the prince or gouernoure in as much as he bears a publyke person
and is a common offycer, he may safely not hurtynge the natural love and
reverence, which he owes unto his father, make answer to his father on this
wise / in this thing I will not take you, or regard you, as my father / I will
more regard the profit of the common wealth / the governance whereof I have
taken upon me, then I will regard the pryuate auctorytie of my father / Here
is perauenture a man having wife and children at home, and his mother
commands him to go in pilgrimage to saint Iamys in Co^postella, because she
has made such a vow or promise: let him say to his mother. In other
things I will take you and obey you as my mother: but in this thing I must
obey god, which commands me to provide and se unto my wife and children.
For whose cause it is well don and according to gods commandment, that a
man do also forsake his father or mother / and these things we have spoken as
touching to the lyterall sense of the gospel / but for as much as our lord
has turned the water of the unsavory law into the best wine, it is right
and according or mete that we also do get out some more pryue and hid sense
or meaning / It was no great thing yt a young wenche was joined to a husband
in matrymonye. But it is a very great mystery, and to be honored even of the
Angelical spirits, that the spyryte that is to wit the sone of god is
joined with ye flesh of man, that is to say: the nature of god with ye nature
of man For the sone of god took unto him our nature / and by a meruaylous glue
it was brought to pass yt the same person was both god and man. There was
present in the same our lord Jesus at this same spyrytuall marriage both the
spouse and the spouses / there was present in that spyrytuall brydale and
feast that blyssed womb, in which that wonderful and vnspecable marriage,
was celebrated and made / in which womb, as in the workehouse of the holy
ghost that Gyaunt of three substaunces, was formed / which should vaynquyshe
depresse and subdue all the tyranny of Satan. There is also another mysterye
of the said marriage / the sone of god feruentlye loved the church which he
has puryfyed with his own blood, to the intent yt he might have her a

having no manner wembe, or spotte, Nota.
neither any wryncle in her at all / and for ye love of this spouses this
meruaylous and wonderful woe were descended from heaven and came into the womb of
a virgyn, from whense being clothed with the robe or vesture of our flesh
came forth, as a spouse or brydegrome from his bryde chamber. This womb of ye
virgyn was certeynly, Ezech. 44.
that yate which Ezechyell saw toward the rysynge of the son / out of ye
which yate there arose or spronge the light Jesus christ to men syttyng in
darkness, and in the shadow of death / which yate remained still closed or
shytte to ye prince the sone of god entering in and also brought forth to us
the same Prince clothed in the body of man, as i^ his wedding garment, the
seal or closure of her chastyte being unhurt / he then after he was come
forth of this chamber / wedded a new spouses the church / he married her
having no dowry or richesse / he married her being in captyuyte / he married
her being fylthy and contamynate. But her thus deformed and full of spots,
he has puryfyed with the bath of his most precious blood he has raunsomed her
being prisoner with his own precious death / and her being bare and naked he
has plentefully enryched with spyrytaall gifts and virtues. The soul of
every one of us most dearly beloved brethren, is the spouses of Christ we
have been raunsomed and bought with an exceeding great price, from the thraldom
of the devil, let us not now wylfully fall again into his seruytude and
bondage. We have been freely washed from fylth, let us not now like swyne
return again unto the soil or mire of vices and sins / we have ones
received the doctrine of the gospel, and we have drunk in the most sweet
spyryte of Jesus: let us not now being unkind to him for his so great
lyberalyte twardes us, run again to the adulterer the devil / but
contynuynge in the faith and promise made at the receyuyng of baptysme / by
which promise we have renounsed the devil and all his pompes / let us always
have in remembrance that we were spoused to one husband, 1 Cor. 2
that we should keep our selves a chaste virgyn to our spouse Christ / and
let us not suffer our senses to be corrupted by the wylynes and craft of ye
serpent, from the sympfycyte which is in christ Jesus / Christ is a Ialous
lover, and not without good cause which did get or win and set at liberty
his spouses to him self / so dearly let us give dylygence that we may be
present always at this spyrytuall wedding or marriage, let us by unfeigned
faith, by pure and perfyte charity co^tynue and abide in the embrasynges of our
spouse, Io. 15
let us that be branches, abide and continue in the vine tree / let us
which be the members, 1 cor. 12
or lymmes abide in the body, Io. 17
that by the spyryte which glueth or soudereth all things together: we may be
made so one with him: as he is al one with his father, let the synagoge of the
Jews drink their own cold and unsavory water which has lost her sponse /
he drynketh this water wheresoever he be that puts his trust and hope of
health and salvation in cerymonyes, in outward things in the power or
strenghte of man. Let us syttyng at the table of our spouse be made dronken
with the spyrytual wine of the doctrine which the spouse has largely and
plentuously powered forth unto us / let us be made fat with the precious body
of him: and with the pocion or drink of his precious blood let us always wax
young as touching our inward man, all though our outward man do decay and
fall away. They which be not yet apt or able to be fed with strong and
substa^cyall meat ar to be nourysshed with milk until that they be grown to
ye strength that they be mete to receive this drink and this meat / that
thing (says Paul) is not the first which is spyrytuall / but that which
is carnal. 1 Cori. 17.
The jews had a carnal law which the wretched men do cleue unto, and will
not yet leave it / but to us which by receyuynge the spyryte of Christ are made
spyrytuall: it is a great shame to be always infantes or babes, and to suck
milk, but it is a much more shame after that we have tasted of the wine of
heavenly doctrine, to return again to the water of the Jews, it is the
propertye of other men first to set before their gestes the best wine / and
afterward that which is worse, that is, to fall from better to worse things
/ But christ has changed this order to the contrary, which kept the best
wine behind and set it forth last to teach us that we should always
profit or goo forewarde from weak things to more strong and substancyall
things / let us pray and beseech the lord that he will give to his spouses
most plentefull fecundite, that is to say: that the sede of the gospel may
most largely be spread abroad / and that daily there may be borne quycke issue
or children / fyllynge the house of god, for through our vices and sins / we
se it brought to pass, that now the lymytes of the Church be brought into so
narowe rowme, and that also among these which professen the name of the
Church: so few be whom the spouse does recognyse to be his / one of us does
blame another / the pryuate person fyndeth defaulte with the princes or
gouernoures, the lay men with the priests / why do we not rather with
agreeable minds go about each man to amend his own self: then to rebuke
another man's life? if we will do so, by this mean the spouses of Christ shall
florysshe and prospere, by this mean the brydale feast shall wax merye and
cherefull / Paul cries / you men that are married love your wives, Ephesians. 5.
as Christ loved the Church and let no man hate his own flesh, but let
him nourysshe and cherysshe it. gyuynge honor to the more weak vessel,
likewise as christ has suffered and does suffer his spouses, 1. Pe. 3
forgyuynge her sins and always drawing her unto better things, likewise
the wives again on their parts, according to the doctrine of the Apostle
let them be subject and obedyent, Coll. 3.
so as is mete and conuenyent in the Lord, and let there be such
temperature of auctorytie and of obsequy or service between them that the
unlawful man may be saved / by the faithful or christen woman, 1. Pe. 3
and that the vnchrystened woman may be sanctyfyed by ye christen man her
husband. And I would wysshe that all men and women should so come together often
unto the praysynge of the blyssed virgyne Marie, if by the gift of the sone,
and the example of the mother, every one of them might return home better
then he came, and might mynysshe somewhat of their vices and make some encreace
and augmentacyon of virtues / such worshyppyng it is wherewith the most blyssed
virgyn Marie is pleased, such also her Sone loves and reioyseth in. To whom
with the Father and the holy ghost be glory and praise without end. Amen.

Laus deo.
