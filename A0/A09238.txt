The pope in his fury does answer return,
To a letter ye which to Rome is late come,

I Do esteem your kyndnes much
For sendyng word so sone,
Your diligence it has been such
It is arrived at Rome:
But when I had pervsd your byl
In that you set thereto your will
And eke your mind applied until
The writing of the same.
I did believe it to be true
But surely I must say to you
It grieved me those lines to view
Were wrtten in your name.
And sure it is no marvel lo
For daily I do hear,
The matter seems to be so
As amply does appear:
For every man does tell for true
The same that late was sent of you
But out alas, your tidings new
Does much appall my spirit.
And makes me swear and makes me tear
To pull and hale, and rend my hear
And brynges me daily in despair
To think on this despite.
But since there is no remedy
That mine obedient child,
Is hanged up upon a tree
And to to much reuylde:
What should I do but curse and ban
And hurt them toe the worst I can
For hanging up so good a man
That bare me such good will?
But if I had him here at Rome
His body should be shryned soon
And mass at morning and at noone
With chantyng of each bell.
For ever should be said and soung
The deuyls to controvle,
And prayers all about his tomb
With senceyng for his soul:
That never a devil so deep in hell
Should once presume with him to mell
Nor once approach his body till
To vex him any way.
And I would keep his body so
That it from hence should never go
And diverse of my friars mo
For him should daily pray.
And gladly would I be reuengd
On England if I might,
Because they have toe much a abusd
My Bull with great despite:
And make thereat a laughing game
And set but little by my name
And much my holiness defame
And daily me dispyse.
Their Queen has chaste the rebels all
That loved to bow their knees to Ball
And hanged their quarters on the wall
As meat for crows and pyes.
But I will walk and daily seek
My Purgatory through,
And cause all the deuyls at my beck
To me their knees to bow:
And where as I may any find
That to their Prince have been unkind
Be sure, with me they shall be shrynde
As they deserved have.
And chiefly now John Felton he
Shall ever be beloved of me
Because that he so louinglye
My Bull did seem to save.
But if that I could have at once
The paryng of his toe,
His head, his quarters, or his bones
That with the wind do bloe:
Then should they be laid up by me
As relics of great dignity
For every man that comes to see
Those Jewels of such grace.
The Nortons bones should so be shrynd
That now hanges wavering in the wynd
If that I could deuyse or find
To bryug them to this place.
And I will curse and ban them all
That speak against my power,
And seeks to make my kingdom fall
My curse shall them deuowre:
And if that here I might you see
For writing lately unto me
Be sure, ye should rewarded be
As best I could bethynke.
And as for Wylliam Elderton
That lately sent me word to Rome
Be sure that he should have like dome
To bye him pen and ynke.
Take this as written from our grace
That unto you we send,
Because we want both time and place
To recompense you friend:
As for the boys that trump and scoff
And at my holiness do laugh
I mind to dress them well enough
If case I had them here.
And for my servants that abide
And long have had their patience tryde
From Roman faith that will not slide
I wysh them all good there.
S. P.

FINIS.
