UNTO THE GODLY AND Christian Reidar, Henry Charteris, wischis grace, and
piece from Jesus Christ our Saluiour. with the perpetual assistence of his
halic Spirit.
IT is the commoun and accustomit manner (gentill reidar) of all them quhilk
dois prohemiate upon any other manis wark, cheiflie to travel about two
pointis. The ane is, to declair the properteis of ye Author, nocht only
external, as his original, birth, vocatioun, estait, strenth, giftis of the
body, substance, and manner of leuing: bot alswa internal: as the qualiteis,
habites, and dispositiones of the mind, his ingyne, knawlege, wisdom, giftis
of the Spirit, and all other verre wis quhilk culd justly be knawin to have
been in him. Bot seeing it is nocht money eiris past, sen it hes pleisit the
eternal God, to call our Author, out of the miserabill and trubilsum
calamiteis of this transiteric life, until his celestial joy, and heavenly
habitatioun, swa that the memory of him is bot as it recent, and not out of
the hartis of money it leuand, to quhome his haill manner of life was better
knawin than unto me, I think it not greitlie neidfull to tarry the thairon, bot
will remit the to learn it at yair mouthis. The other is, to declair his manner
of writing, the vtili^ie of his warkis, and quhat fruit, profit, and
commodity may ensew and follow to the diligent reidar and reuoluar of the
samin. Nouther in this is it greitly neidfull to me to travel, seeing the samin
may be may esilie and perfytelie knawin be his awin pen. For besydis the
plesand and delectabill versiz, besy^i^ the crafty and ingenious poetical
inuentionis, besydis the fruitful and commodious Historyis, ba^th humane and
divine: both recent and ancient: besydis the hailsum and notal^i^l counsellis
and admonitionis to Princis, to Prelates, and to all estatis, quhat vice or
iniquity rang in his dayis, quhilk he did not cel^u^e? not only of the
spiritual, bot alswa of the temporal estait? quhat verteous or commend a bill
fact, hes he not praisit, and desyrit to be had in the dew honor, and
honorabill estimatioun. Bot gif we fall consider and wey the time, quhen he did
write the may pairt of their warkis, being ane time of sa greit and blind
ignorance, of manifest and horribill abhominationis and abusis: it is to be
meruell it how he durst sa planelie inuey ag^nis the wycis of all men: bot
cheiflie of the spiritual estait, being sa bludie, and cruel boucheouris. He
never ceissit both in his grave and merry materis, in cruis^ and in bourdis:
in writing, and in wordis to challenge and carp them. It cu^mis to my memory
ane pretty trik, quhilk sumtyme I have hard reportit of him. The Kingis grace,
James the Fyft, beand on ane certane time accumpany it with ane greit nowmer of
his Nobillis, and ane greit mean of Bischoppis, Abbottis and Prelatis standing
about he quiklie and prettily inuentit ane pretty trik to teine yame. He
cu^mis to the King, and after greit dewgard and salutationis, he makis him, as
thocht he war to require sum wechtie thing of the Kingis grace. The King
persaua^d, demandis quhat he wald have? he answeris: Schir, I have seruit our
grace lang, and lukis to be rewardit as vtheris ar. And now our master
Taileour at the pleasure of God is departit, quhairfoir I wald desire of our
grace, to bestow this lytil benefit upon me, as ane part of reward of my lang
service, to make me our master taileour. The King belenand in deid his taileour
to be departit, sayis to him. Quhairto wald thou be my taileour? thou can
nouther schaip nor few? he answeris. Schir, that makis na matter: for e have
geuin Bischoprikis and benefices to money standing heir about ow: and it can
they nouther teiche, nor preiche. And quhy may I not than asweill be our
taileour, thocht I can nouther schaip nor sew: seeing teiching and preiching is
na les requisite to their vocatiou^, than sch^iping and sewing is to ane
taileouris. The King incontinent persauit his consait, and leuch merrily
thairat: bot the Bischoppis at sic bourding leuch never ane quhit. Na les
ernist and vehement was he aganis them, in his fairsis and publict playis,
quhairin he was verray crafty and excellent. Sic ane spring he gaif yame in
the play, playit beside Edinburgh, in presence of the Queen Regent, and ane
greit part of the Nobility, with ane exceeding greit nowmer of pepill, lest and
fra. ix. houris afoir none, till.vj. houris at euin, quhair amangis money both
grave materis, and merry trikkis he brocht in ane Bischop, ane Person, ane
Freir, and ane Nun. deckit up in their papisticall orname^tis, and manner of
raiment. And thairefter brocht in King correctioun, quha reformand sindrie
deformiteis in his Realm, passit to the trial of his Clergy. And find and
them to be altogidder Idiotis, unworthy of any functioun ecclesiastical,
decernit them to be degradit of their digniteis, and spuleit of their officis:
quhilk beand executit, and they denudit of their vpmaist garmentis, they war
fund bot verray fulis, hypocrites, flatteraris, and nouchtie persons. Quhairby
he signifyit to the pepill, that howsaeuer they war estemit of the world, they
had nathing quhairin they micht justly glory to be pastouris of Christis
Kirk, and feidaris of his flock, bot only their outward ornamentis, and
triumphant tytillis. Bot beand inwardly considerit, they wald be fund bot
verray hyrelingis, enemeis to Christ, and deuoraris of his flock. This play did
enter with sic grief in their hartis, that they studyit be all menis to be
auengit thairof. They conuenit their provincial counsellis, they consultit how
they should best sustene thait kingdom inclynand to ruin, quhilk lairlie had
gottin sa publict ane wound: they eid about to have his haill warkis
condempnit, for heretical, and cessit not in Kirk and market, publictlie and
priuelie, to rage and rayll aganis him, as ane Heretic. Bot to return to our
purpose. Nochtwithstanding the birnand fire borne aganis him in their breistis,
the hatreut co^sauit in their hartis, their puissance and power euin in that
time, quhen they had the ball at their fute, quhen nouther Prince, nor other
was abil to withstand them, it culd they never get power over this sempil man,
nor haif ya^^ harus satiat of him. They had their Canoun Lawis: they had the
Municipal Lawis of the Realm, and actis of Parliament haldin be yat samin
King, quhame he seruit, with quhon c^rom his outh up he co^uersit, that na man
should ressoun or call in dout the authority of their spiritual Father: that
Imagis should be honourit: that the liberty of hali^ Kirk (as they namit it)
should be mantenit, and defendit. And gif any war suspectit in any heretical
point, aganis the co^mandementis of this yair Kirk, incontinent they war cytit,
they war apprehendit, and incarcerat in strange presoun: and finally they war
co^pellit outher to abjure (quhairthrow they remamt infamit all their dayis,
nouther micht enjoy honouris, nor digniteis for their time) or ellis they
behourt may cruelly suffer the fire. How cu^mis it than, that this our
Author being sa plane aganis them, and as it war professit enemy to them,
culd eschaip their snairis, quhen vtheris in doing les hes cruelly perischit?
Sum will think, because his writing was co^mounlie mixit with mowis, and
collourit with crafty consaitis (as Chaucer and vtheris had done befoir) the
matter was the mair mitigatt. Bot this can not satisfy: for na mowis in sic
materis culd mitigate their bludie breistis. Sum will think because he was
continually in Court, and seruit the King, he was esilie ouersene. Bot in my
judgment, that is the greiter cause of offense: namely to haif their vaniteis
and wickitnes publischit in Court, and sicht of Princis Nouther culd this be
saiftie to vtheris. M. Patrik Hammilto^ Abbot of Feirn, being of the blude
Royal, being ane man of greit literature, and of sic life, that the verray
enemeis them sellis war enforcit to commend and allow him. it did he nocht
eschaip their malice, bot sufferit cruel deith be fire. Robert Forester alswa
gentilman on the samin manner was tormentit. And howbeit their did cruelly
perische, it in all agis, and in all nationes, it hes plesit God, of his greit
mercy, to raise and steir up his Prophetis and seruandis, quhame he hes
michtilie preseruit, to repreif the generationis present of their
vnrichteousnes: to utter and oppin to the pepill the corruptioun than regnand:
and as it was aganis the Devil, and the world to testify his treuth: to
walkin them out of their Ignorance. He steirit up the auld and ancient
Doctouris, to impugn and stranglie confute all heresyis springand and rysand.
Bo^ them at this present I will omit for brevity, and will speik rather
sumquhat sen corruptioun and superstitioun enterit amangis them, quhilk war
rewlaris and Pastouris of the Kirk of God: sen they begouth to leif preiching
of pure Christ, and to set up them selfis: to conquers Realmis, prouincis, and
cuntreis: to subdew Princis and Potestates: and finally to exalt them selfis
above all that is callit God. In quhilk dayis war money leirnit men, and godly
Bischoppis in this cuntrir: as Seruanus, Columba, Aidanus, Finnanus, Colmannus,
Leuinus, Bailus, and money ma, quha both in this Realm, and in Ingland, did
lang debell, and hald out the Romische superstitionis, and ceremoneis, as is at
lenth contenit in the auld Historyis of Beda, and vtheris. He rasit up alswa in
the dayis of Carolus Magnus, two of our cuntrie men, both of greit eruditioun
and leirning, the ane callit Iohne, surnamit Mailrosius: the other Claudius
Clemens. Their two passand out of Scotland, at command of King Achaius (as
Boethius wrytis) to ye partis of France, come to Paris, and war the occasioun
of the fundatioun of ye University of the samin, and sindrie vtheris, and war
the first professouris of liberal sciencis in them. Nouther ceissit they with
ane Adelbertus ane Frencheman, and Bertramus, to inwey on ye stait of ye Kirk,
than tendand and declynand fast to corruptioun, until Claudius, and Adelbertus
war clappit in clois presoun, and Iohne departit the cuntrie, and come in
Ingland: quhair (as sum wrytis) at the perswasioun of certane Monkis, he was
slain, be certane his awin discipulis, impacie^t of his admonitiones and
correctionis. After their quhen the sindrie ^ectis of Freiris began to spring
up, he raisit in France Builielmus de. S. Amore: Nigellus: Nicolaus, and
Arnoldus de villa noua: in Italy ye Abbot Ioachimus Calaber: in Germany,
Hildegardis ye Prophets with sindrie vtheris, quhilk stranglie wrait aganis
the superstitionis and Idilteth of the begging Freiris, and other abusis of the
Clergy. And howbeit yair admonitiones culd not be hard, nor th^^r writing taken
in good part, bot utterly reiectit and despysit, it war they not cu^mit to
that fury and rage, as to bruyle and scald quha sa ever should speik aganis
them, bot co^tentit them selus with presoun, or banischement of sic persons,
as war contrarious to them, degraiding them of their digniteis and offices:
and exco^municating them out of their Kirkis. Bot quhen their iniquiteis was
cu^min to maturitie, God raisit up in Ingland, Iohne Vicleif, quha scand the
haill ecclesiastical estait, to be altogidder corrupt: the word of God, to be
cu^mit to neglect, and contempt: and me^nis traditionis above it to be
extollit: did may ernistlie teiche, and write ane huge nowmer of volumis and
bukis aganis them. Than was the beist vnquyetit of his resting sa^t, and began
to rage and fret, to seik the deith and destructioun of this pure man. Bot all
for nocht. The Lord did potentlie preserve him from yair snairis and girnis:
and nothwithstanding all their fury, departit in the Lord in piece. And
howbeit after deith Rancour co^mounlie reissis, it.xlj. eiris after his with,
ya^ tuke up his banis and brint yame. Persewand alswa with may extremity all
that adheirit to him, or did allow his doctrine. They brint the Lord Cobham,
Schir Roger Actou^ Knicht, Williame Thorpe, Williame Tayleir, Richard Howede^,
Iohne Clerdoun. They banischit Elenor Cobhame: they murderit in presoun Iohne
Astoun, Reginald Pecock Bischop of Chichester, with ane infinite noumber ma.
Their was na end in their fury. Quhill they war thus busy in Ingland, began
Iohne Hus, and Hierome of Braga to preiche in Boheme, men of sic leirning, and
life, that they war in admiratioun euin to the verray aduersaris them selfis,
quhairof remanis it sufficient testimoneis writtin be Poggius, and vtheris of
the Antichristiane mean. They beand cytit to the counsall of Constance, come
upon ane saifconduct of Sigismundus the Empriour, than king of Boheme, present
at the counsall: and their gaif ane resoun and declaratioun of their faith, and
doctrine: fra the constant professioun quhairof, quhen yai culd nocht be
disswadit: they contrair the saifconduct, contrair all promises, cruelly brint
them. Satisfyand the Empriour, with this godly Law, of their awin forgeing,
Quod nulla fides sit hereticis seruanda: Their is na promis to be keipit to
heretics. Quhat fruit this gudelie Law hes wrocht, the battle betuix the
Turk, and Lowes king of Vngarie, and Boheme, and the occasioun thairof quhair
the said Lowes perischit, to the greit hurt of all Christianity, will declair:
and money other histories alswa, quhilkis for schortnes I omit. Now our Prelates
laith to ly behind, willing to schaw yair good service to ye halie Sait,
apprehe^dit heir in Scotland, Paull Craw, teiching the doctrine, quhilk Vicleif
and Hus had teichit, and maid ane Sacrifice of him in Sanctandrois. And findand
the sawour of this Sacrifice fragrant and smelland they tuke the Vicar of
Dolor, Freir Kelour, Symsone, Bawerage, kennedie, Stratoun, Bourlay, and money
ma, quha because yai culd not allow yair vain superstitiones and Idolatries,
expres aganis the commandment of ye Lord their God war cuttit of be the fire.
They had now lernit to dispute with fire and faggot, for our auld Bischoppis
and Pastouris war decayit, quhilkes war wo^t to be lampis, and as it war
leidsternis, to all nationis adiace^t: from quhome passit forth money lernit men
to all cuncreis, to Ingland, France, Germany, Sa^one, Pruse, and other partis,
as their Chronikillis testifyis, plantand and teichand the Christian faith,
and all godly sciencis. Bot now dull Asynis had ascendit to their rowmis,
beand maryit with dame property, and riches, and fair lady Sensuality: and
swa after ye rait of other Realmis, war becu^mit Idil bellyis, Ignorant
blokkis, and dum doggis. Nouther war they Idill in Italy: their cruelly
sufferit Thomas Rhedonensis the Carmelite. And in Florence the godly blak
Freir, Hieronymus Sauoronola. Thus co^tinewand yair rage in all Realms, euin
to the vttermaist of yair power, it pleisit ye merciful God, of his greit
mercy, and fauourabill lufe towartis man, quhairby he wald not haif man
utterly to perische, to gif (as it war) lycht to the world: and that be
reueilling of his word and Euangel, be the mouthis of his seruandis Luther,
Bucer, Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Calvin, and money vtheris: be quhome he hes
discouerit yair cankerit corruptioun, and auld festur in sic sort, yat na man
(except he will be wilfully blind) may not persaif ye vennome and fylth thairof.
And it hes ye may part of yir (how saeuer ye poweris of ye world hes been
co^trarious to yame) departie in ye Lord, in quietness. Now sum will say, their
war preicheouris, and Ministeris of the word, and had been sumtyme auoyntit
schauelingis, mar^it with the beistis mark, and had maid defectioun from them,
quhairfoir they persewir them the mair scharplie and cruelly. Bot the Lord
Cobhame, Robert Forester, Straitoun, were nouther schauelingis nor preicheouris.
Richard Mekinnis ane boy of.xvij. eiris of age, brint in Lo^doun, was na
preicheour. The like Judgment sufferit Maistres An Askew, with money women,
quhilk it war na preicheouris. it forther sum will object the equity of the
time, quhairin our Author leuit: that the power of the adversaries was
restraynit, that they culd not rage and rin at riot at their liberty, and
plesour, as they war wont. And it ane lytill befoir his deith they brint. M.
George Vischart, and Adam Wallace Mariner. And schortlie after our Authouris
deith, they tuke the auld man Walter Mill, and cruelly brint him: althocht fra
that fire raise sic ane stew, quhilk struke sic sturt to their stomokis, that
they rewit it ever after. Than hes it not been seriousnes intermixit with
iocunditie: it hes nocht been continual abiding nor serving in court, it hes
nocht been blude royal, nor favor of Princes: nouther teiching nor preiching:
nor equity of time, culd be protectioun to any aganis sa cruel and feirs
adversaries, of equal will, rage, and fury indifferently aganis all. It is
rather the prouydence, the Judgment, the power, and the inmensibill favor, and
mercy of God towartis his sanctis and elect: quhilk upon ye ane part, of his
lufe towardis his chosin, to satisfy their thrist, and desire, quhilk they had
to be dissoluit, and to be with Christ, yat yai should not be langer enforcit to
behald ye wickit vaniteis of yis world: Partly of his just Judgment, because
the world was not worthy of them, for it hes lufit mirknes rather yan licht,
and delytit mair in leis yan in ye treuth. And partly to manifest to all
pepill ye cruel, bludie, and insatiabil hartis of ye memberis of Antichrist,
ye pilleris of the malignant Kirk, he did (as it were) gif ouir into yair
handis, ye lyfis, ye possessionis, gudis, and quhatsumeuer external thing yai
had, to be maid mokking stokkis, and to be disponit at their liberty, and
plesour. On the other pairt, to declair his michtie providence, and power,
quhairby he will not suffer ane hair of the heidis of his chosin to perische,
but his permissioun: and to encorage his elect, seeing yat nouther good nor
evil can fall unto yame, by ye will of yair Father: he hes may michtilie
manteynit yame, ama^gis ye middis of yis malignant generatioun. This Judgment
man we likewise haif of our David Lyndesay: to quhome we will return, omittand
the special abusis of the Clergy, for eschewing of prolixitie, and tediousnes,
to be socht out of his awin warkis be ye diligent reidar. Now as he hes been
scharp and vigilant in marking ye enormities of the spiritualitie, swa hes he
not been negligent, nor sleuthfull in rebuking ye defaltis of ye temporalitie,
and all estatis yairof. He hes not spairit King, Court, Counsalouris,
Nobility, nor vtheris of inferior estait. And howbeit yai war not altogidder
cu^mit to sic corruptioun and fury, yat yai micht not beir mair equally, with
general admonitionis and reprochis, yan the spiritualitie. it als lytill
amendment followit in the ane stait, a^ in the other. Quhat laubouris tuke he,
that the landis of this cuntre^ micht be set out in Fewis, after ye fassioun of
sindrie other Realms, for the incres of policy, and riches? Bot quhat hes he
profitit? Quhen ane pure man with his haill raice and offspring hes laubourit
out yair lyfis, on ane lytill piece of ground, and brocht it to sum point and
perfectiou^: tha^ must the Lairdis brother, kinisman, or surname haif it: and
ye pure man, with his wife, and babeis, for all yair trauellis, schot out to
beg yair meit. He yat tuke lytill laubouris on it, man enjoy ye fruits, and
co^moditeis of it: he man eit up the sweit and laubouris of ye pure ma^nis
browis. Thus the pure dar make na policy, nor bigging, in case yai big yame
selfis out. Bot althocht men wink at yis, and ouirluke it, it he sitts above
yat seis it, and sal Judge it. He yat heiris ye sichis and complaintis of ye
pure oppressit, sall not for ever suffer it vnpunischit. Quhat hes he alswa
writtin aganis yis Heriald horse, deuysit for money pure mannis hurt? Bot quha
hes dimittit it? finally, quhat oppressioun or vice hes he not repreuit? Bot
yir sall suffice for exempill. And gif he had leifit in yir lait dayis, quhat
had he said, of ye unnatural murtheris: ye cruel slauchteris: ye manifest
reiffis: ye continual heirschippis: ye plane oppressionis: ye lytill regard of
all persons to ye co^moun weilth: ye mantening of derth, to the universal
hurt of the pure in transporting of victuallis forth of ye Realm, contrary to
ye statutis yairof, for ye particular weill of few, and hurt of money: the
Importing of greit quantiteis of falls cune, sklenderlie serchit, and lychtliar
punischit: The multitude of Kirkis destitute of Ministeris throw the hail
cu^trie: The slaw administratioun of Justice, and fer les executioun: with all
kind of impieteis (as it were) publictlie, and frelie Regna^d. it nochtyeles we
luke for redres and reformatioun of all sic horribil deformiteis, at ye handis
of sic rewlaris, as God hes, and sall strenthin with his Spirit, lychtin with
ye pure word of his Euangel, endew with his feir (quhilk is ye beginning of all
wisdom) with sic knawlege, sic Judgment, and eill, yat yai sall to yair
vttermaist endeavor, auance, and set fordwart all Justice, and equity, and
suppres all vice and iniquity: to ye glory of God: to ye auancement of his
word: to ye edificatioun of his Kirk, and to ye confort, and quietness of yis
trubillit, and afflictit commoun weilth. Quhilk God of his greit mercy, grant
that we may schortlie se. Amen.

I have alreddie passit ye boundis of ane preface: it ane thing restis to
admonische ye (gentill reidar) of yir warkis following. The mait part of yame
hes been sindrie times in sindrie places imprentit: as heir in Scotland, quhilk
it war not sa correct, as neid requyrit. They haif been Imprentit in Rowen, bot
altogidder sa corrupt and falls, that na man can be abill, to atteyne to the
Authoris mind be yame. For besydis the wrang Ortographie, and falls spelling,
the transpositiones of wordis, and lynis: yair is alswa sic defectiones, yat
sumtymes will want two, or three lynis in ane sentence: sumtymes als money abound,
and be doublit.

Quhairthrow the myndis of honest men ar alienatit from reiding of sa fruitful
warkis: outh is abusit and corruptit: the Author, and his warkis schamefullie
blottit, and barbuleit: the cu^trie infamit: and sic personis as laubouris for
just correctioun utterly discuragit, scand their lauboures, and trauellis sa
haistelie yairefter to be corruptit, at the private appetite and gred^nes of
certane godles Ignorantis: quhilk in respect of yir greit hartis, deseruis na
small punischement. They ar likewise laitlie Imprentit in Londoun, with lytill
better succes than ye other. For yai haif gave about to bring th^me to ye
southern language, alterand ye verse and collouris yairof, in sic placis, as
yai culd admit na alteratioun: quhairfoir ye native grace, and first mind of ye
writer, is oftentimes peruertit And for ye Ortographie, transpositiones, and
defectiones, they ar almaist commoun with the other.

Thus seeing this famous Author, and his notabill warkis to be sa velanouslie
handillit, and sa miserabillie, and malitious^ie mankit, and alterat: we haif
gane about, and takin sum trauellis, to vindicate yame from yir blottis, and
corruptiones: and to reduce, and bring them to the native integrity, and
first mening of ye writer. Quhilk salbe esilie persauit in ye reiding: bot
may esilie, gif any will confer this editioun with yame yat hes pre ceidit:
quhairin quhat difference is betuix rycht and wra^g writing, betuix correct,
and vncorrect Imprenting salbe cleirlie seen.

Mair we haif cikit sindrie warkis of ye samin Author, quhilkis hes not been
befoir Imprentit: to ye intent, that na thing of sa Nobill ane writer should
perische, throw negligence or sieuthfulnes of this present age, bot should be
reseruit to ye fruit of all posteriteis following. And forther intendis (be ye
help of God) to use ye like diligence, in all warkis of yis writer, quhilkis
fall heirefter, be any menis, cum to our handis.

I will deteyne the na langer (good Re^dar) from the warkis them selfis: bot
will commit the to the protectioun of ye Almychtie our God: ernistlie desyrand
ye to call upon him: yat he will raise and steir up money David Lyndesayis: yat
will continually admonische both Prince, and pepill of yair dewtie, and
vocatioun, quhairunto ye Lord yair God hes callit yame: yat will rebuke, and
repreif all sic defaltis, as salbe fund in yame: yat will commit to letteris,
and write, ye honor, ye gloir, ye fame, and succes of verrew, and inbraceris
yairol: The dishonor, ye schame, ye defame, and mischief of vice, and
impiety, and enhanteris thairof.

To be notifyit, and maid knawin to all agis to cum: that it may be ane prik
and spur to ye verteous and godly, to ga fordwart in all richteousnes, and
equity: that it may be ane stay, and brydill to reteyne, and hald bak ye
wickit and ungodly from all wickitnes, and iniquity. To the intent: yat God
may be glorifyit: his Kirk edifyit: and this commoun ^eilth confortit, and
quietit.

Ane adhortatioun of all estatis, to the reiding of their present warkis. ()

How they haith God and man had sore offendit:
With fleschehukis of flattery be never clew them,
Of quhar degree sa ever they discendit,
Their auld misde^d he prayit them ay to mend it

With plesand prouerbis in his warkis all quhair,
With staitlie storyis aggreing to our age,
With similitudis senielie he dois declair,
With weill waillit wordis, wise, and familiar,

Thou lytill quair, of matter Miserabill,
Weill aucht thou, couerit for to be with sabill
Renunceand grene, the purpur, reid, and quhyte
To delicat men thou art not delectabill,
Nor it till amorous folkis amyabill,
To reid on the they will haif na delight.
Warldlie pepill, will haif at the dispyte,
Quhilk fixit hes their heart, and haill intentis
On sensual lust, on dignity, and Rentis.
We haif na King, the to present allace,
Quhilk to this country been ane cairfull case.
And als our Queen of Scotland heritour,
Scho dwellis in France, I pray God saif her grace,
It war to lang, for the to rin that race.
And far langer, or that oung tender flour,
Bring hame till us ane King and Governor.
Allace thairfoir, we may with sorrow sing,
Quhilk must sa lang remane, without ane King.
I not quhome to thy simpilnes to send,
With cunning men from time that thou be kend,
Thy vaniteis na way they will auance,
Thinkand the proud sic thingis to pretend.
Nochtwithstanding, the straucht way sall thou wend,
To them quhilk hes the Realm in governance.
Declair thy mind to them with circumstance.
Ga first till James, our Prince, and Protector,
And his brother, our spiritual Governor,
And Prince of Preistis in this natioun,
After Reverend Recommendatioun
Under their feit, thou lawlie the submit,
And make them humill supplicatioun,
Gif they in the find wrang narratioun,
That they wald pleis, thy faltis to remit.
And of their grace, gif they do the admit,
Than ga thy way, quhair ever thou pleisis best.
Be they content, make reverence to the rest.
To faithful prudent Pastouris spiritual,
To Nobill Erlis, and Lordis temporal,
Obedientlie, till them thou the addres,
Declairing them this schort memorial,
How mankind been to misery maid thrall.
At lenth to them the cause planelie confess.
Beseikand them all lawis to suppres,
Inuentit be mennis traditioun,
Contrair to Christis Institutioun.
And cause them cleirlie for till understand,
That for the breking of the Lordis command,
His thrinfald wand of Flageliatioun,
Hes scurgit, this pure Realm of Scotland,
Be mortal weiris, both be sey and land,
With money terribill tribulatioun.
2. Re. 24 1. Cor. 2.
Thairfoir make to them true narratioun,
That all their weiris, this derth, hunger, and pest,
Was nocht, bot for our Sinnis manifest.
Declair to them, how in the time of Noy, Genesis 7.

Alluterlie, God did the world distroy. Genesis 19.

As haly Scripture makis mentioun,
Sodom, Gomor, with their Regioun and Roy,
God spairit nouther man, woman, nor boy, Mat. 23. Luc. 13.

Bot all war brint for their offensioun.
Jerusalem, that may tryumphand town
Destroyit was, for their Iniquity.
As in the Scripture planelie they may se.
Declair to them this mortal Misery, Iere. 15.

Be sword and fire, derth, pest, and poverty,
Proceidis of Syn, give I can richt descryue,
For laik of Faith, and for Idolatry,
For Fornicatioun, and for Adultery
Of Princes, Prelatis, with money ane man and wyue.
Expel the cause, than the effect belyue
Sall ceis quhen that the pepill dois repent,
Than God fall flak his bow, quhilk it is bent.
Make them requeist, quhilk hes the governance,
The Sinceir word of God for till auance,
Conform to Christis Institutioun,
Without Hypocrisy or dissimulance,
Causing Justice hald euinlie the Balance,
On Publicanis making punitioun.
Commending them of good conditioun.
That being done, I dout not bot the Lord,
Sall of this cuntrie haif Misericord.
Thocht God with money terribill effrayis,
Hes done this cuntrie scurge, be diverse wayis,
Be Just Judgment for our grievous offense,
Declair to them, they sall haif merry dayis
After this trubill, as the Propheit sayis.
Quhen God sall se our humill repentence,
Till strange pepill, thocht he hes geuin license,
To be our scurge, Enduring his desire,
Will quhen he list, that scurge cast in the fire.
Pray them, Psalm. 118
that they put not their esperance
In mortal men, only them till advance,
Bot principally in God Omnipotent.
Than neid they not, to charge the Realm of France,
With gunnis, galayis, nor other ordinance.
Sa that they be to God obedient.
In their premissis, be they nocht negligent,
Display and Christis Baner, hie on hicht,
Their enemyis of them sall haif na micht.
Ga hence pure buke, quhilk I haif done Indyte
In rural ryme, in manner of dispyte,
Contrare the warldis variatioun.
Of Rethorik heir I proclaim the quyte.
Idolatouris, I feir, fall with the flyte,
Because of them thou makis narratioun.
Bot cure thou nocht the Indignatioun
Ot Hypocritis, and falls Pharisience,
Howbeit on the, they cry ane loud vengeance.
Requeist the gentill Reidar, that the reidis,
Thocht ornate terms into thy Park not spreidis.
As they in the may haif experience.
Thocht barrane feildis, beiris nocht bot weidis,

Desire of them nane other recompense,
Bot that they wald reid the with patience.
And gif they be in any way offendit,
Declair to them, it salbe weill amendit.

Or quhow that the Aromatik odouris
Did proceid from the tender fragrant flouris.
Or quhow Phoebus that king Etheriall

And in his presence waxit dick and paill
And over her visage, kest ane mislie vaill.

Quhow euerilk bird, dressed them for till advance
To salute Nature with their melody
That I stude gaising halflinges in ane trance
To heir them make their natural obserua^ce
So royally, that all the roches rang

So Adam was cause Radical
That we been fragill Synnaris all.

The Creatioun of Adam and Eve. ()
QVhe^ God had maid ye heuinnis bricht
The Sone, and Moan, for to gyf licht
The sterry heuin, Genes. i.
and Christalline
And be his Sapience Divine
The Planeitis in their circles round
Quhirlyng about with merry sound
Of quhome Phoebus was principal
Just in his Line Eclipticall
And gave be Divine Sapience
Till every Ster their Influence
With motioun continual
Quhilk doith endure perpetual
And farrest from the heuin Empire
The earth, the water, air, and fire.
He cled the earth, with herbis and treis
All kind of fischis in the seis
All kind of best, he did prepair
With foulis fleing in the air.
Thus be his word, all thing was wrocht
Without material maid of nocht
So be his wisdom Infinyte
All was maid plesand and perfyte.
Quhen heuin, and earth and their contentis
Wet endit with their Ornamentis
Than last of all, the Lord began
Of most vile earth, to make the man,
Nocht of the Lilly nor of the Rose
Nor Cyper tree, as I suppose,
Another of gold, nor precious stonis
Of earth he maid flesche, blude and bonis
To that intent, God maid him thus
That man should nocht be glorious
Nor in him self, no thing sulde se
Bot matter of humylite.
Quhen man was maid, as I have tauld
Gene. ii.
God in his face, did him behauld
Bre^thand in him, ane lyflie spreit
Quhen all their werkis were compleit
He maid man to his similitude
Precelland in to pulchritude
Dotit with giftis of Nature
Above all erdlie Creature
Syne plesandlie did him conuoy
To ane Regioun repleit with Joy
Of all plesour, quhilk bair the price
And callit erthlie Paradyce
And brocht be Divine prouience
All beistis, and birdis, till his presence
Adam did craftelie Impone
Ane special name till every one
And to all thyngis material
He namit them in special
Quhow he them namit, it been kend
And salbe to the warldis end.
In to that gardyng of plesance
Two treis grew, most till auance
Above all other, quhilk bair the price
In middis of that Paradyce.
The one was callit the tree of life
The other tree, began our strife,
The tree to know botth good and evil
Quhilk he perswasioun of the Devil
Began our misery and woe,
Bot let us to our purpose go.
Quhow God gave Adam strait command
That tree to twiche nocht with his hand
All other fructis of Paradyce
He bad him eit at his deuyce.
Sayand, gyf thou eit of this tree
With dowbill deith, than sall thou de
Tharefore I the command be war
And from this tree, thou stand a far.
it Father Adam was allone
But company of any one
Than thocht the Lord it necessar
Till him to create ane helpar.
God pat in Adam sic Sapour
That for to sleip, he tuke plesour,
And laid him down upon the ground
And quhen Adam was sleipand sound
He tuke ane Rib, forth of his side
Syne fillit up, with flesche and hyde
And maid ane Woman of that bone
Fairar of form, was never none.
Than till Adam Incontinent
That fair Lady, he did present.
Quhilk schortlie said, for to conclude
Thou art my flesche, my bonis, and blude.
And Virago, he callit her than
Quhilk is Interpreit, maid of man.
Quhilk Eua, efterwart was Namit
Quhen for her falt, scho was defamit
Than did the Lord them Sanctify
Saying Incres, and Multiply
Be this, men should leif all their kyn
And with their wyffis make dwellyn
And for their saik leif Father and Mother
And lufe them best, above all other
For God hes ordanit them trewlie
To be two Saulis, in one body
My wit is walk for till Indyte
Their heavenly plesouris Infinyte
Was never none erthlie Creature
Sen syne had sic perfyte pleasure.
They had puissance Imperial
Above all thing material.
Als cunnyng Clerkis dois conclude
Adam precellit in pulchritude
Most Natural, and the fairest man
That ever was sen the world began
Except Christ Jesus, Goddis Sone
To q^thome was no comparisone
And Eua, the fairest Creature
That ever was formit be Nature
Thocht they war naikit as they were maid
No schame ather of other haid.
Quhat plesour mycht ane man have more
Nor have his lady him before
So lusty, plesand, and perfyte
Reddy to serve his appetyte.
They had none other cure I wis
Bot past their time, with Joy and blis
Wyld Bet^^s did to them repair,
So did the Fowlis of the air
With noyis most Angelical
Makand them mirthis Musical.
The fischis swemand in the strandis
Wet holelie at their commandis.
All Creaturis with ane accord
Obeyit him, as their souerane Lord.
They sufferit another heit nor called
With every plesour that they wald.
Als to the deith they were nocht thrall
And rychtso should we have been all
For he and all his successouris
Should have possedit those plesouris,
Syne from that Joy material
Gone to the glore Imperial.
They had give I can richt discryue
Greit Joy in all their wyttis five
In heiring, seeing, gusting, smelling
Enduring their delytesum dwelling
Heiring the birdis harmoneis
Taisting the fruetis of diverse treis
Smelling the balmy dulce odouris
Quhilk did proceid from fragrant flouris.
Seeing so money heavenly hewis
Of blomes breking on the bewis
Of twicheing als they had delight
Of vtheris bodyis soft and quhyte,
But dout, Enduring that plesour
They luffit other Paramour
No marvel been thocht swa should be
Considering their greit bewte
Als God gave them command expres
To multiply, and till incres
That their seid, and successioun
Mycht pleneis every Natioun.
I list nocht tatie till declair
All properteis of that place preclair
Quhow herbis, and treis, grew ay grene,
Nor of the temperat air serene
Quhow fructis Indeficient
Ay alyke ripe and redolent,
Nor of the Fontane, nor the fludis,
Nor of the flouris pulchritudis.
That matter Clerkis dois declair
Quharefor, I speik of them na mair.
The Scripture makis no mentioun
Quhow lang they rang in that Regioun,
Bot I believe, the time was schort
As diverse Doctouris dois report.
Of the Miserabill Transgressioun of Adam.
FATHER? Courteo.
How happinit that mischa^ce
(Quod I) schaw me the circumstance
Declare me that cairfull case
How Adam lost that plesand place
From him, and his Successioun
Quhow did proceid that transgressioun*
(Quod he) Experien.
after my rude Ingyne
I sall rehers the that rewyne
Quhen God the Plasmatour of all
In to the heuin Imperial
Did Creat all the Angellis bricht
He maid one Angel most of micht
To quhome he gave preeminence
Above them all in Sapience
Because all other he did prefer
Namit he was bricht Lucifer
He was so plesand and so fair
He thocht him self without compair,
And grew so gay and glorious
He began to be presumpteous,
And thocht that he wald set his sait
In to the north, and make debait
Agane the Majesty Deuyne
Quhilk was the cause of his rewyne,
For he incurrit Goddis Ire
And banyst from the heuin Empire
With Angellis money one Legioun
Quhilkis were of his opinioun.
Innumerabill with him their fell.
Sum lichtit in the lawest hell,
Sum in these did make repair,
Sum in the earth, sum in the air
That most unhappy cumpany^
At Father Adam had Inuye
Persauing Adam and his seid
Gene, iii.
In to rhair placis to succeid.
The Serpent was the subtellest
Above all beistis and craftiest
Than Satan, with ane falls intent
Did enter in to that Serpent
Imaginyng sum crafty wyle
Quhow he micht Adam best begyle
And gar him brek commandment,
Bot to the woman first be went,
Traisting the better to preuaill
Full subtellie did her assaill
With facund wordis, falls and fair
He grew with her familiar
That he his purpose micht auance
Beleuand in her Inconstance.
Quhat is the cause, Madame (said he)
That e forbeir one plesand tree,
Quhilk been but peir most precious
Quhose fruct been most delycious?
I Nyll (quod sche) thate to accord
We are forbiddin be the Lord
The quhilk hes geuin us lyberte
Till eit of every fruct and tree
Quhilk growis in to Paradyse,
Brek we command, we are nocht wise.
He gave till us ane strait command
That tree to twiche nocht with our hand
Eit we of it, without remede
He said but dout, we should be deed.
Believe nocht that (said the Serpent)
Eit e of it Incontinent,
Repleit e sall be with Science
And have perfyte Intelligence
Like God himself, of evil and good.
Than haistelie for to conclude
Heiring of this prerogatyue
Scho pullit down the fruct belyue,
Throuch counsall of this false Serpent
And eit of it to that intent,
And pat her husband in believe
That plesand fructe give he wald preue
That he should be als Sapient
As the greit God Omnipotent.
Think e nocht that ane plesand thing
That we like God should ever ring.
He heir and this Narratioun
And be her solistatioun (...)
Mouit be prydefull ambitioun
He eit on that conditioun
The principal poyntis of this offense
War pride, and Inobedience
Desyring for to be Equal
To God, the Creator of all.
Allace Adam, quhy did thou so
Quhy causit thou this mortal woe?
Had thou been constant ferme and stabill
Thy glore had been Incomparabill
Quhare was thy consideratioun
Quhilk had the Dominatioun
Of every leuand Creature
That God had formit be Nature
Till use them at thy awin deuyse
Was thou nocht prince of Paradyse?
Was never man sen syne on live
That God gave sic Prerogatyue
He gave the strenth above Sampson,
And sapience more than Solomon,
oung Absolon in his time most fair
To thy beauty was no compair,
Aristotell thou did precell
In to Philosophy natural,
Virgill in till his Poetry,
Nor Cicero in till Oratrie,
War never half so Eloquent
Quhy brak thou Goddis Commandment
Quhare was thy wit, that wald nocht fle
Far from the presence of that tree?
Gave nocht thy Maker the fre will
To tak the good, and leif the evil?
Quhow micht thy forfalt be excusit
That Goddis commandment refusit
Throuch thy wyffis perswasioun
Quhilk hes been the occasioun
Sen syne, that money nobill men
Be the evil counsale of women
Alluterlie desiroyit been
As in the historyis may be seen.
Quhilk now we neid nocht till declair
Bot fordwart till our purpose fair.
Quhen they had eitin of the fruit,
Of Joy than war they destitute
Than began they boith, for to think schame
And to be naikit thocht defame
And maid them Breikis of leuis grene,
That their secreitis should nocht be seen.
Bot in the stait of Innocence
They had none sic experience
Bot quhen they war to Syn subiectit
To schame and dreid they war coactit
And in ane busk they hid them cloce
Eschamit of the Lordis voce,
Quhilk callit Adam be his Name
(Quod he) my Lord, I think greit schame
Naik it to cum to thy presence.
Thou had none sic Experience
(Quod God) quhen thou was Innocent
Quhy brak thou my commandment.
Allace (quod Adam) to the Lord
The verite I sall record.
This woman that thou gave to me
Gart me eit of one plesand tree.
Rychtso the woman her excusit
And said, the Serpent me abusit.
Than to the Serpent, God said thus,
O thou Desauer venomous,
Because the woman thou begylit
From thine forth sall thou be exilit.
Cursed and varyit sall thou be,
So sall thy seid be after the.
Cauld earth salbe thy fude also
And creipand on thy breist sall go
Als I sall put Enemite
Betuix the woman ever and the
Betuix thy seid, and womannis seid
Salbe continual mortal feid.
Quhowbeit thou hes wrocht their myscheuis
It sall nocht be as thou beleuis
Sic seid salbe in woman sawin
That thy power salbe down thrawin,
Tredding thy heid that thou may feill
And thou sall tred him on the heill.
This was his promis, and mening
That the Immaculate Virging
Should beir the Prince Omnipotent
Quhilk should tred down that falls Serpent
Satan and all his company
And them confound alluterlie.
(Quod I) Courteo.
give Satan prince of hell
Spak in the Serpent as e tell
And beistis can no way syn at all
Quhy was the Serpent maid so thrall?
I heir men say before that hour
The Serpent had ane fair figour
And eid straucht up upon his feit
And had his memberis all compleit
As vtheris beistis upon the bent.
Experien.
(Quod he) for he was Instrument
To Satan, in this Misery
Punist he was, as e may se.
As be experience thou may know
Expres in to the Commoun law
Ane man conuiteit for Bugre
The beist is brint, als weill as he
Howbeit the beist be Innocent.
And so befell of the Serpent
It was the Feynd full of despyte
Of Adamis fall quhilk had the wit,
As he hes had of money mo
Bot till our purpose let us go.
Than to the woman for her offense
God did pronunce, this sore sentence.
All plesou^ that thou had a sorrow
Sall changit be in lesting sorrow.
Quhare that thou should with mirth and Joy
Have borne thy birth but pane or noy
Now all thy barnis sall thou bair
With dolor and continual cair,
And thou salbe for oucht thou can
Ever subiectit to the Man.
Be this sentence, God did conclude
Women from liberty denude.
Quhilk be experience e may se
Quhow Quenis of most hie degree
Ir under most subiectioun
And sufferis most correctioun.
For they like birdis in till ane cage
Ar keipit ay under thirlage.
So all women in their degree
Should to their men subiectit be.
Quhowbeit sum it will strive for stait
And for the maistrie make debait,
Quhilk gif they want, boith euin and morrow
Their men will suffer mekle sorrow
Of Eve, they tak that qualite
To desire Soueranite.
And than till Adam, said the Lord
Because that thou hes done accord
Thy will, and harknit to thy wife
Now sall thou lose this plesand life,
Thou was till her obedient
Bot thou brak my Commandment
Cursit and baren the earth sall be
Quhare ever thou gois till that thou de.
But laubour, it sall beir no corn
Bot Thrissil, Nettill, Breir, and Thorn,
For fude thou gettis none other beild
Bot eit the herbis upon the field,
Sore laubouring till thy browis sweit
From thine forth sall thou wyn thy meit
I maid the of the earth certane
And thou in earth sall turn agane.
Than maid he them Abilement
Of skynnis ane raggit Raiment.
Them to preserve from heit and cauld
Than grew their dolor money fauld.
Now Adam ar e like till us
With our gay garment glorious?
To them their wordis, said the Lord
Than cryit they boith Misericord
Quhen from that gairth with hartis sore
Banischit they were for ever more,
In to this wrechit vaill of sorrow
With daily laubour ewin and morrow
After quhose dolorous departing,
The Lord gave Paradyse in keeping
Till ane Angel of Cherubin
That none sulde have entres tharein.
At the quhilk entres he did stand,
With flammand fyrie sword in hand,
To keip that Adam, and his wife
Sulde nocht taist of the tree of life,
For give they of that tree had preuit
Perpetually they micht hauelleuit.
So Adam, and his Successioun
Of Paradyse tynt possessioun,
And be this Syn Original
War men to Misery maid thrall.
My Sone now may thou cleirly se
This world began with misery
With misery it doith proceid
Courteo.
Quhose fine sall dolor be and dreid.

After thait baillfull banising?

Quhow they went wandering up and down
Weiping with money loud allace

In wilderness to be exyld
Quhare they fand nocht bot beistis wyld
Mannessing them for till deuore
Quhilkis all obedient war before.
Father (quod I) Courteo.
in quhat country
Did leif Adam, after that he
Was banischit from that delight?
Clerkis (quod he) Experien.
hes put in write
Quhow Adam dwelt with mekle baill
In Mambet, in that lusty vaill,
Quhilk after was, the Iowis land
Quhare it his Sepulture dois stand Genesis iiii.

I l^st nocht tarry till discryue
The woe of Adam nor his wine
Nor tell quhen they had Sonnis two
Cayn, and Abell, and no mo.
Nor quhow cursed Cayn, for Inuy
Did slay his brother cruelly
Nor of thait murning, nor of their moan
Quhen they but Sonnis were left allone.
Abell lay slane upon the ground
Cursed Cayn fleinit, and Vacabound
Nor quhow God of his special grace
Send them the third Sone fair of face
Most like Adam, of flesche and blude,
Seth was his Name, gracious and good
Nor quhow blind Lameth, rakleslie
Did slay Cayn vnhappelie.
Adam as Clerkis dois discryue
Begat with Eve his woeful wyue,
Of Men Children, threttie and two
And of Dochteris alyke also.
Be this thou may weill understand
That Adam saw money ane thousand,
That of his body did descend
Or he out of the world did wend.
Gene. ^.
Adam leuit in earth but weir
Compleit, nine houndreth and thretty eir
And all his dayis war bot sorrow
Remembering boith euin and morrow
Of Paradyre the prosperity
And syne of his greit Misery.
His heart micht never be reiosit
Remembering quhow the heuin was closit
From him, and his successioun,
And that be his transgressioun.
After his deith, as I heir tell
His Saul discendit to the hell
And their remanit presoneir
In that Dungeoun, three thousand eir
And more, so did boith evil and good
Till Christ for them had sched his blude,
Than be that most precious Ransoun
They were delyuerit of presoun
I have declarit now as I can
The Misery of the first man.
Quhow God Destroyit all Leuand Creaturis in earth for Syn, And Drownit them be
ane Terrible Flude, in the time of Noe. etc.
PRVDENT Father Experience
Declare to me, Courteo.
or e go hence
Quhat was the cause God did distroy
All Creature in the time of Noe?
(Quhod he) I trimmyll for to tell
That Infortune, Experien.
quhow it befell
The cause been so abhominabill
And the matter so miserabill.
Bot for to schaw the Circumstance
Manifestly of that mischance.
First I mon gar the vnstderstand
Quhow Adam gaif expres command Gene. vi.

That those quhilkis come of Sethis blude
Because they were gracious and good
Should nocht contract with Caynis kyn
Quhilkis were Inclynit all to Syn.
Till observe that commandment
Cayn past in to the Orient
With his wife, callit Calmana
Quhilk was his awin Sister alswa.
Quhare his offspring did lang remane
Beside the montane of Tatbane.
And Seth did lang time led his life
With Delbora, his prudent wife
Quhilk was his Sister good and fair
In Damascene maid their repair.
In that country of Sethis clan
Discendit money holy man
So lang as Adam was leuand
The people did observe command
Quhen he was deed, and laid in ground
And people greitly did abound
And Cayn slane, as I have schawin,
And Sethis dayis, all over blawin
Gene. vi.
The Sonnis than of Sethis blude
Seand the plesand pulchritude
Of the Ladyis of Caynis kyn
Quhowbeit they knew weill it was Syn
Oppressed with sensual lustis rage
Dip tak them in to Marriage.
And so corruptit was that blude
The good with evil, and evil with good.
Than as the people did incres
They did abound in wickitnes
As holy Scripture dois rehers
Quhilk I abhor, to put in verse,
Or tell with tongue, I am nocht a bill
The suthe been so abhominabill.
Quhow men, and women, schamefullie
Abusit them selfis vnaturallie,
Quhose foull abhominatioun
And uncouth fornicatioun
I think greit schame to put in write,
All that Paull Orose doith indyte.
Quhilk give I wald at lenth declair
It were yneuch to fyle the air.
Greit Clerkis of Antiquiteis
Hes wryttin money true storels
Quhilkis as worthy to be commendit
Quhowbeit they be nocht comprehendit
At lenth in the Divine Scripture
Bot I sall do my besie cure
To tak the best (as I suppose)
That may pertenis to my purpose,
And with support of Christ our king
I purpose to confirm no thing
Of the auld Hystoricience
Contrarious till his Excellence.
Quhowbeit that sum mennis Traditionis
Be contrair Christis Institutionis
Of them thocht sum thing I declair,
Now let us proceid forthermair,
And with ane Language lamentabill
Declare this matter miserabill.

The earth than was so plentuous
Of fruce, and Spyce delicious,
The herbis were so comfortabill
Delytesum and Medicinabill,
The Fontanis fresche and redolent
To laubouring they tuke little teut.
All manner of beistis at their plesour
Did multiply without laubour.
The time betuix Adam and Noe
To se the earth, it was greit Joy
Plantit with precious treis of price.
Four famous Fludis of Paradyce
Ran throuch the earth in syndrie partis
Spreiding their branchis, in all airtis,
The watter was so strange and fine
They wald nocht laubour to make wine.
The fruct, and herbis, were so good
They maid no cair for other fude.
And so the people tuke no cure
Bot past their time at their plesour,
Ay findand new Inuentionis
To fulfill their Intentionis,
So that the Lord Omnipotent
That he maid man did him repent.
And schew until his seruand Noe
That he wald all the world distroy
Except himself, and his Meine.
Allace (quod Noe) quhen sall that be?
Than said the Lord, sen thou so speiris
I sall prolong sax score of eiris
Tarying upon their repentance
Or I fulfill my Just Sentence.
In the meine time, fall thou to wark
Incontinent, and beild ane Ark.
Quhilk Noe began Obedientlie
And wrocht on it Continually.
And to the people daily preichrit
To cry for grace, he to them techeit.
And to them planelie did declair,
That God his wand no more wald spair,
Bot on them he wald wirk vengeance.
To Noe it gave they no credence
And so they were Incounsolabill
Using their lust abhominabill
And tuke his precheing in despyte
Ay following their foull delight
More and more, till that dulefull day
Quhilk all the world put in effray.
Courteo.
Father e gart me understand
Quhen Adam brak the Lordis command
Till agment his afflictioun
God gave his Maledictioun
Unto the earth, quhilk was so fair
That it should barren be and bair
And without laubour beir no corn
Nor fruct, bot thrissill, breir, and thorn.
Now say e, in the time of Noe
To se the earth, it was greit Joy,
Plantit with fourtis good and fair
The suthe of this, to me declair.
Their saying is two, gar me considder
Quhow e make them agree to gidder.
God maid that promis sickerlie

Quhowbeit it come nocht Instantly
(Quod he) as Clerkis dois conclude.
Bot after quhen the furious Find

Than come that promis sickerlie.
Eum siclyke as God gave command
Adam to twiche nocht with his hand
Nor eit of the forbiddin tree,

Quhowbeit he deit nocht but weir
After that day nine hundredth eir.

To saif mankind quhilk is forlorn,
As he had been borne Instantly

After that saying money one eir
As in the Scripture, thou may heir,

Were it nocht tedious for to dwell,
Till our purpose, let us proceid
Schawand the hicht, the lenth and breid
And qualite of Noyis Ark
Quhilk was ane richt excellent wark.
Of Pyne tree maid bound weill about
Laid over with pik, within and out
Iunit full cloce, with naillis strong
And was three houndreth Cubitis long,
Fyftie in breid, thretty in hicht,
Three Chalmeris Iunit weill and wicht,
And euerilk loft, above ane other
Withoutin Anchor, Air, or Ruther,
Ane richt Cubit, as I heir tell
Of mesour now micht been ane ell
In the mid side, ane dur their was
For Beistis ane esie entres.
This Ack quhilk was boith lang and large
Maid in the boddum, like ane Barge
Couerit with burdis weill abufe
Most like ane house, with set on rufe,
Quhose riggin was, ane Cubit braid,
Quhatein their was, ane wyndo maid
Sum sayis, weil be closit with Christ all cleir
Quharethrow the day lycht micht weil appeir
This work the more was to be prysit
Because be God, it was deuysit.
Genesis vii.
The making of this Ark but weir
Indurit weill ane houndreth eir.
Quhe^ Noe had done compleit this wark
God did him close, within the Ark,
With him his wife, and Sonnis three,
With their three wyfis, but mo mean.
And of all foulis of the air
Of euerilk kind enterit ane pair.
Rychtso two Beistis of euerilk kind
For quhy, it was the Lordis mind
That Generatioun should nocht faill,
Quharefore of Femell, and of Maill
Of euerilk kind were keipit two.
Bot to rehers, mine heart is woe
The dolent Lamentatioun
That time of euerilk Natioun,
Say and allace ane thousand syis
Quhen wynd, and rane, began to ryis.
The Roikis with reird, began to ryue
Quhen ugly cluddis did ouerdryue
And dirkynnit so, the Heuinuis bricht,
That Sone, nor Moan, micht schaw no licht
The terribill trimling of earth quaik
Gart Biggingis bow, and Citeis sckaik,
The thounder raif the cluddis sobill
With horrible sound, Espouentabilli
The fyreflauchtis flew ouerthort the fellis
Tha^ was their nocht, bot owtis and ellis.
Quben they persauit, without remede,
All Creature, to suffer deed,
All Fontaris from the earth vpsprang
And from the heuin, the rane down dang
Forty dayis, and forty nichtis
Than ran the People to the hichtis,
Sum clam in craigis, sum in treis,
And sum to the hichest montanis fleis
With more terror, nor I can tell
Bot all for nocht, the fludis fell
And wynd did rowt, with sic ane reird
That euerilk wicht, waryit his weird.
Cryand allace, that they were borne
In to that Flude, to be forlorn.
Men micht no help make to their wyifts
Nor it support their barnis lyifis.
The fludis rofe, with so greit michtis
That they over couerit all the hichtis.
They micht no more their lyuis lenth
Bot swame so lang, as they had strenth,
And so with cryis Lamentabill
Endit their lyuis Miserabill.
Above montanis, that war most hie
Fyftie Cubitis rose the sea.
Men may Imagyne in their mind
All Creature in to their kind.
Boith Beistis, and foulis in the air
In their maneir, maid mekle cair,
The fischis thocht them evil begyld
Quhe^ they swame throuch the woddis wyld
Quhailis tumland amang the treis,
Wyld beistis swomand in the sen^
Bi^dis with money pietuous pew
Efferitlie in the air they flew,
So lang as they had strenth to flee
Syne swattetit down in to the sea.
No thing on earth, was left on live
Beistis, nor foulis, Man, nor wyue.
God holelie did them distroy
Except them in the Ark with Noe,
The quhilk lay fictand on the flude
Welterand amang the stremis woo
With money terribill effrayis
Remanit ane hundredth and fifty days,
In greit lang our, and heuines
Or wynd, or rane, began to ceis.
Sumtyme effectuouslie pray and,
Sumtyme the Beistis vesiand
For be the Lordis commadement
He maid prouisioun sufficient.
For Noe dwelt in that Ark but dout
Ane eir compleit, Genesis viii
or be come out
Quhow at more lenth, in holy write
This dulefull history been Indyte,
And quhow that Noe, began to teiose
Quhen Conductis of the heuin did close,
So that the Rane, no more discendit,
Nor the flude no more ascendit.
Quhen be persauit the heuinnis cleir
Hasend forth Corbie Mesfingeir
In to the air, for to espy
Give he saw any montanis dry.
Sum sayis the Rauin, did forth remane
And come norht to the Ark agane.
Forth flew the Dow, at Noes command,
And quben scho did persaue dry land
Of ane Olyue, scho brak ane branche,
That Noe mycht know the watter stanche,
And their no more, scho did sudiorne,
Bot with the branche scho did return,
That Noe micht cleirly understand
That fellown Flude, was decressand.
And so it did, till at the last
The Ark upon the ground stak fast
On the top of ane Montane hie
In to the land of Armenie.
And quhen that Noe had done espy,
Quhow that the earth began to dry,
Than dang he down the durtis all,
And lousit them, the quhilk was thrall.
The foulis flew forth in the air,
And all the beistis pair and pair,
Past forth to seik their Pastorages.
Their was than bot aucht Personages
Noe, his three Sonnis, and their wynis
On earth, that left was with their lyuis,
Gene. ix.
Quhome God did blis, and Sanctify,
Say and incres, and multiply.
God wat give Noe, was blyith and glaid
Quhen of that presone he was fraid.
Quhen Noe had maid his Sacrifice,
Thank and God of his Benefice,
He standing on mont Armenie
Quhare he the country micht epsy
e may believe, his heart was sore
Seeing the earth, quhilk was before
The Flude, so plesand and perfyte
Quhilk to behald, was greit delight
That now was barren maid and bair
Before, quhilk fructuous was and fair.
The plesand treis, beityng fructis
Were ly and rewin up be the rutis,
The holsum herbis, and fragrant flouris
Had tynt boith vertew, and colouris
The feildis grene, and flurist meidis
Were spuleit of their plesand weidis,
The earth quhilk first was so fair formit
Was be that furious flude deformit,
Quhare vmquhyle were, the plesand planis
Were holkit Glennis, and hie montanis
From clattring craigis, greit and gray
The earth was weschin quyte away.
Bot Noe had greitest displesuris
Behaldand, the deed Creaturis,
Quhilk was ane sicht richt Lamentabill
Men, women, Beistis, Innumerabill
Seeing them ly, upon the landis,
And sum were fleting on the strandis
Quhaillis, and Monstouris of the seis
Stickit on stobbis, amang the treis.
And quhen the Flude was decressand
They were left weltering on the land.
Before the flude, during that space,
The sey was all in to ane place.
Rychtso the earth, as been decydit
In syndrie partis, was nocht deuydit,
As been Europe, and Asia
Deuydit ar, from Africa.
e se now diverse Famous Ilis
Stand from the main land money mylis.
All their greit Ilis, I understand
War than equal, with the ferme land.
Their was none sey Mediterrane,
Bot only the greit Occeane,
Quhilk did not spreid sic bullering strandis
As it dois now, ouirthort the landis.
Than be the raging of that flude
The earth of bertew was denude,
The quhilk before was to be prysit
Quhose bewte than were disagysit.
Than was the Maledictioun knawin
Quhilk was be God, till Adam schawin.
I reid quhow Clerkis dois conclude
Enduring that most furious flude
With quhilk the earth was so suppressed,
The wynd blew forth of the southwest
As may be seen be experience.
Quhow throw the watteris violence
The hich montanis in every art,
Ar bair forgane the southwest part.
As the montanis, of Pyreneis
The Alps, and Rochis in the seis.
Rycht so the Rochis greit and gray
Quhilk standis into Norroway.
The hichest Hillis in every art
And in Scotland, for the most part,
Throuch weltering of that furious flude,
The Cragis of earth warmaid denude.
Traveling men, may considder best
The Montanis bair nyxt the southwest.
Declare (quod I) or e conclude Courteo.

Quhow lang leuit Noe, after the flude.
(Quod he) in Genesis, thou may heir
Quhow that Noe, was sex houndreth eir, Experien.

The time of his greit punischement
And ay to God obedient Gene. ix.

And was the best of Sethis blude.
And als he leuit after the Flude
Three hundredth and fyftie eiris
As the samyn Scripture wytnes beiris.
And was or he Randerit the spreit
Nine hundredth and fyftie eiris compleit.
To schaw this history Miserabill
At lenth my wittis ar nocht abil.
And als my Sone, as I suppose
It langis nocht till our purpose,
To schaw quhow Noyis Sonnis three
Began to incres and multiply.
Nor quhow that Noe, plantit the wine
And drank till he was drounkin syne,
And sleipit with his Membris bair,
And quhow Cham, maid for him no cair
Bot leuch, to se his Father so
Quhowbeit his Brether were richt woe.
Nor quhow Noe, but Restrictoun
Gave Cham his Maledictioun
And put him under Servitude
To Sem, and Iaphet, that war good.
Nor quhow God maid ane conuenent
With Noe, to make no punischement,
Nor be no Flude the people droun,
In sign of that Conditioun
His Rain Bow set in to the air,
Of diverse Heavenly colouris fair,
For to be ane perpetual sing
Be Flude, to make no punissing
This History give thou list to know
At lenth the Bibill sall the schaw.
The Secund buke Contening the Building of Babylon be Nimrod. And quhow King
Ninus began the first Monarchy, of their Idolatry. And quhow Semiramis
Gouernit the Impyre, After her Husband King Ninus.
FATHER I pray ow to me tell.
The First Infortune that befell Courteo.

Immediately after the flude
And quho did first sched saikles blude
And quho Idolarrie began?
(Quod he) I sall do as I can.
After the Flude, I find no history Experien

Worthy to put in memory
Till Nimrod began to King,
Above the people as ane King, Gene. x.

Quhilk was the principal man of one
That beildar was of Babilone.
That history Master wald I know
(Quod I) give e the suthe wald schaw,
Quhy, and for quhat occasioun Courteou

They beildit sic one strange Doungeoun?
Than said to me Experience
I sall declare with diligence Experien

Those Questionis, at thy command.
Bot first Sone, thou mon understand
Of Nimrod, the Genealogy,
His strenth curage, and Quantite.
Quhowbeit Moses in his first Buke,
That history lichtlie did over luke,
Of him no more, he doith declare
Except he was ane strange Huntare
Bot vtheris Clerkis curious
As Orose doith, and Josephus,
Discryuis Nimrod at more lenth,
Boith of his stature, and his strenth,
This Nimrod was the fourt persoun
From Noe belyne discending down.
Noe generit Cham, Cham generit Chus,
And Chus Nimrod, the suthe been thus.
This Nimrod grew ane man of micht,
That time in earth, was none so wicht.
He was ane Giant, stout and strange
Pet force wyld beistis he down thrang,
The people of that hole Regioun
Come under his Dominioun.
No man their was in all that land
His stalwartnes that durst ganestand.
No marvel was thocht he was wicht,
Ten Cubitis large, he was of wicht.
Proportionat in lenth and breid,
Efferand to his hicht we reid.
He grew so greit and glorious,
So prydefull, and presumptuous,
That he come Inobedient
To the greit God Omnipotent.
This Nimrod was the principal man
That first Idolatry began.
Than gart he all the people call
Gene. xi.
To his presence boith greit and small,
And in that greit Conuentioun
Did propone his Intentioun.
My freindis (said he) I make it knawin
The greit vengeance that God hes schawin,
In time of our fore Father Noe
Quhen he did all the world distroy.
And dround them in ane furious flude,
Quharefore, I think we should conclude
Quhow we may make one strange defense
Aganis sic watteris violence
For to tesist his furious Ire
Contrair boith to flude and fire.
Let us go spy sum plesand field
Quhare one strange bigging we may beild,
One Cietie, with ane strange Dungeoun
That none Ingyne may ding it down,
So hich, so thik, so large, and lang
That God till us sall do na wrang.
It sall surmont the planetis semn.
That we from God may win the heuin.
Those people with one ferme intent
All till his counsel did consent
And did espy ane plesand plais
Hard on the flude of Euphrates,
The people their did them repair
In to the plain feilde of Sinear,
Quhilk now of Chaldie beris the name
Quhilk did lang time flureis in fame.
Their greit Fortres, tha^ did they found
And kaist till they gat souer ground.
All fell to work, both man and Child
Sum holkit clay, sum brint the tyld.
Nimrod, that curious Campioun
Deuysar was of that Dungeoun.
Na thing they spairit their laubouris
Like besy beis upon the flouris,
Or Emmettis traveling in to June
Sum under wrocht, and sum above,
With strange Ingenious Masonerie
Vpwart their work did fortify,
With brynt tyld stonis, large and wicht
That Tour they raisit to sic hicht
Abufe the airis Regioun,
And Iunit of so strong fassioun
With Syment maid of pick and ter
They vsit none other mortar.
Thocht fire or watter it assailit
Contrair that Dungeoun nocht auailir.
The land about was fair and plane.
And it raise like ane hich montane.
Those fulische people did intend
That to the Heuin it should ascend
So greit one strenth was never seen
In to the world with mannis ene.
The wallis of that work they maid
Two and fifty faldome braid.
One faldome than, as sum men sayis
Mycht been two faldome in our dayis.
One man was than of more stature
Nor two be now, thareof be sure.
Josephus baldis opinioun
Say and the hicht of this Dungeoun
Of large pasis of mesure been
Five thousand, aucht score, and fourtene.
Be this rakning, it is full richt
Five mylis, and ane half in hicht.
Ane thousand pais, tak for ane mile
And thou sall find it neir that style
This toure in compass round about
Were mylis ten, withouttin dout,
About the Cetie of Staidis
Four houndreth, and four score I wis.
And be this noumer in compass
About three score of mylis it was,
And as Orosius reportis
Their was five score of brasin portis.
The Translatour of Orosius
In till his Cronicle wryttis thus,
That quhen the Son is at the hicht
At none, quhen it dois schyne may bricht
The schaddow of that hiduous strenth
Ser mile and more, it is of lenth.
Thus may e Judge in to our thocht
Give Babylon be hich or nocht.
How God maid the Diversity of Languagis, and maid Impediment to the Buildaris
of Babylon.
THAN the greit God Omnipotent
To quhome all thingis been present
That was, and is, and ever salbe
Ar present till his Majesty,
The hid secretis of mannis heart
From his presens may nocht depart
He seand the Ambitioun
And the prydefull Presumptioun
Quhow their proud people did pretend
Up throuch the heuinnis till ascend
Quhilk was greit folly till deuyse
Sick one presumptuous interpryse.
For quhen they were most diligent
God maid them sick impediment
They were constraynit with hartis sore
From thine depart and beild no more:
Sick Languagis on them he laid
That none will quhat ane other said.
Quhare was bat ane Language before
God send them languagis threscore.
At that time all spak Hebrew,
Than sum began for to speik Grew,
Sum Duche, sum language Sarazyne
And sum beget to we^^ Latyne.
The Master men, ga^^ to go wyld.
Cry and for treis, they brocht them tyld,
Sum said bring mortar heir atonis
Than brocht they to th^me stokis and stonis.
And Nimrod their greit Campioun
Ran rage and like ane wyld Lyoun
Manassing them with wordis rude
Bot never one word they understood,
Before they fand him good and kind
Bot than they thocht him by his mind,
Quhen he so furiously did flyte
Than turmit his pride in to dispyte.
So dirk Gelipsit was his glore
Quben they wald wirk for him no more.
Behald quhow God was so gracious.
To them quhilk were so outrageous.
He another braik their leggis nor arms,
Nor it did them none other harms,
Except of toungis diuisioun
And for fynall conclusioun
Constraynit they were for till depart
Ilk cumpanie in one syndrie art.
Sum past in to the Orient,
And sum in to the Occident,
Sum south, sum north, as they thocht be^^
And so their policy left waist.
Bot quhow that Ciete was repairit
Heir after it salbe declairit.
Of the first invention of Idolatry. Quhow Nimrod compellit the People till
adorn the Fire in Chaldea:
Courteou.
NOW Schir (said I) schaw me the man
Quhilk first Idolatry began?
Experien.
That sall I do, with all my heart
My Sone (said he) or we depart.
Quhen Nimrod saw his purpose failit
And his greit laubour nocht auailit,
In manner of Contemptioun
Departit forth of that Regioun,
And as Orosius doith rehearse
He past in to the land of Perse.
And money one eir, did their remane
And syne to Babylon come agane
And fand huge people of Chaldie
Remanand in that greit City
That were glaid of his returning
And did obey him as their king.
Nimrod his Name for till auance
Amang them maid new ordinance:
Say and I think e ar nocht wyis
That to none God makis Sacrifyis.
Than to fulfill his false desire,
He gart be maid ane flammand fire,
And naid it of sic breid and hicht
He gart it birn botth day and nicht
Than all the pepill of that land
Adorit the fire, at his command,
Proste thit on kneis and facis
Beseik and their new God of gracis,
To give them more occasioun
He maid them greit perswasioun,
This God (said he) is may of micht
Schaw and his bemison the nicht.
Quhen Son, and Moan, at both obscure
His heuinly brichtnes dots endure.
Quhen mennis memberis sufferis called
Fire warmis them euin as they wald.
Than cryit the People at his desire
Their is no God except the fire.
Or their was any Imagerie
Began this first Idolatry.
At that time, their was none usage
To ^arue, nor for to paynt Image.
Than maid he Proclamatioun
Quho maid nocht adoratioun
To that new God, without remede
In to that fire should suffer deed.
I find no man in to that land
His tyranny that durst ganestand
Bot Abraham, and Aram, his brother
That disobeyit, I find none other
Quhilk dwell and war, in that country
With their Father calit Their.
Their brether Nimrod did repreue,
Sayand till him, Lord with our leave,
This fire is bot ane Element,
Pray e to God Omnipotent
Quhilk maid the Heuinnis be his micht,
Son, Moan, and sterris, to give licht.
He maid the fischis in the seis
The earth, with beistis, herbis, and treis,
And last of all, for to conclude
He maid man to his similitude.
To that greit God give pryse and glore
Quhose Ring induris evermore.
Than Nimrod in his furious Ire.
Their brether boith kest in the fire,
Abraham be God he was preseruit,
Bot Aram in the fire he steruit.
Quhen Their, hard his Sone was deed
He did depart out of that stead,
With Abraham, Nachor, and their wyuis,
As the Scripture at lenth discryuis.
And left the land of Chaldea
And past to Mesopotamia,
And dwelt in Tharan all his dayis
And deit their, as the story sayis
The life of Abraham I suppose
No thing langis till our purpose.
In to the Bibill thou may reid
His verteous life, in word and deid.
Now to the, I have schawin the man
That first Idolatry began.
Of the greit Misery And scathis that cummis of Weiris: And quhow king Ninus

Quhilk hes roung sen the world began.
Courteo.
Than (said I) Father give e can,
Quhilk four been they, schaw me I pray ow
Experien.
My Sone (said he) that sall I say ow
First rang the Kingis of Assyrianis:
Secundlie rang the Persianis:
The Greikis thridlie, with swerd and fire
Perforce obtenit the third Impyre.
The fourt Monarchy, as I heir
The Romany brukit money ane eir.
Let us first speik of Ninus king,
Quhow he began his Conquessing.
The auld Greik Historiciane
Diodorus, he wryttis plane
At richt greit lenth, of Ninus king,
Of his Impyre, and Conqueissing,
And of Semitamis his wife
That time the lustiest on life.
It were to lang to put in write
Quhilk Diodore hes done indyte,
Bot I sall schaw as I suppose
Quhilk may belangis thy purpose.
Quhen Nimrod, Prince of Babilone
Out of this wrechit world was gone
And his Sone Belus deid alswa,
The first King of Assyria,
This Ninus quhilk was secund king
Tryumphantlie began to ring,
And was nocht satifyit, nor content
Of his a win Regioun, nor his rent,
Thynk and his glore for till advance
Be his greit people and puissance,
Throuch Pride, Couetyce, and vane glore
Did him prepare to conqueis more.
And gatherit forth ane greit Army
Contrate Babylon, and Chaldie,
Quhare of he had ardent desire
Till June that land till his Impyre,
Quhowbeit he had thareto no richt
Bot by his tyranie and micht,
Without in feir of God or man
His Conquessing thus he began.
His people beand in array
To Chaldea tuke the reddy way
Quhen that the Babilonianis
To gether with the Chaldeanis,
Hard tell King Ninus was cummand
Maid proclamationis throuch the land,
That ilk man after their degree
Should cum and saif their awin country.
Quhowbeit they had no use of weir
They past fordwart withouttin feir,
And put them selfis in good ordour,
To meit king Ninus on the bordour,
In that time e sall understand
Their was no harnes in the land
For till defend, nor till Inuaid,
Quharethrow more slauchter their was maid
They faucht throw strenth of thate bodeis
With gaddis of Irne, with stonis and treis.
With sound of horn, and hidduous cry
They ruschit to gither ticht rudely,
With hardy heart, and strenth of handis
Till thousandis deed lay on the landis.
Quhare men in battle naikit been
Greit slauchter sone their may be seen.
They faucht so lang and cruelly
And with vncertane victory,
No man mycht Judge that stude on far
Quho gat the better, nor the war.
Bot quhen it did approach the nicht
The Chaldeanis they tuke the flicht.
Than the king and his company
Were richt glaid of that victory,
Because he wan the first battle
That strikkin was in earth but faill.
And peceable of that Regioun
Did take the hole Dominioun.
Than was he King of Chal^ea
A^swe^ll as of Issyria.
As for the King of Arabi^.
I^ his conquest maid him supply
Of this it was he nocht content
Bot to the Realm of Mede he went.
Quhare Farnus king of that country
Did meit him with ane greit Army.
Bot King Ninus the Battle wan,
Quhare slane were money nobyll man.
And to that king wald give no grace
Bot planelie in one publict place
With his seuin Sons, and his Lady,
Cruelly did them Crucify.
Of that tryumphe he did Reiois,
Syne fordwart to the field he gois
Than conqueist he Armenia,
Perse, Egypt, and Pamphylia,
Cappadoce, Lide, and Mauritane,
Caspta, Phrigia, and Hyrcane,
All Africa, and Asia,
Except greit Inde, and Bactria,
Quhilk he did conques efterwart
As e sall heir or we depart.
Now wald I or we forther wend
That his Idolatry were kend.
Syue after that without sudiorne,
Till our purpose we sall return.
Quhow king Ninus Inuentit the first Idolatry of Imagis.
NINVS one Image he gart maik,
For king Belus his Fatheris saik,
May like his father of sigour
Of quantite and portratour.
Of fine Gold, was that figour maid
Ane crafty Croun upon his heid,
With precious stonis in tokning
His father Belus was ane King.
In Babylon he ane tempyll maid
Of crafty work, both hich and braid,
Quharein that Image gloriously
Was thronit up tryumphantlie.
Than Ninus gaif ane strait command
Till all the people of that land
Alsweill in till Assyria
As in Sinear, and Chaldia,
Under his Dominatioun
They sulde make Adoratioun
Upon their kneis to that figour,
Under the pane of forfaltour.
Their was na Lord in all that land
His soummonding that durst ganesiand
Than oung and auld, both greit and small
Till that Image they prayit all
And changit his Name as I heir tell
From Belus, to their great God Bell
In that tempill he did devise
Preistis for til make Sacrifice,
Be consuetude, than come ane law
None other God that they wald know
And als he gaif to that Image
Of Sanctuary the Privilege
For quhat sum ever tragressour
Ane Homicide, or Oppressor
Seand that Image in the face
Of their gilt gat the kyngis grace.
Declare to me, Courteo.
sweit schir (said I)
Was their no more Idolatry?
After that this false Idol Bell
Was thronit up, as e me tell.
My Son (said he) Experien.
incontinent
The nouellis throuch the world they went
Quhow king Ninus, as I have said
Ane curious Image he had maid
To the quhilk all his Natioun
Maid deuote adoratioun
Than every Country tuke consait
They wald king Ninus conterfait
Quhen any famous man was deid
Set up one Image in his steid
Quhilk they did honor from the spleen
As it Immortal God had been
Imagis sum maid for the nonis
Of fine gold, sum of stokis and stonis
Of silver sum, and Ever bone
With diverse names till eueryone
For sum they callit Saturnus
Sum Iuppiter, sum Neptunus
And sum they callit Cupido
Their God of lufe, and sum Pluto
They callit sum Mercurius
And sum the wyndie Eolus
Sum Mars maid like ane man of weir
Enarmit weill with sword and speir
Sum Bacchus, and sum Apollo
Of names they had ane houndreth mo.
Quhen one Lady of greit fame
Was deed, for till exalt her name
Ane Image of her portratour
Walde set up in ane Orator
The quhilk they callit their gods
As Venus, Juno, and Pallas,
Sum Cleo, sum Proserpina
Sum Ceres, Vesta, and Diana,
And sum the greit gods Mynerue
With curious colouris they wald carue
Amang the Poetis, thou may see
Of falls goddis, the genealogy.
So their abhominationis
Did spreid ouerthort al Nationis
Except good Abraham, as we reid
Quhilk honourit God, in word and deid
For Abraham had his beginning
In to the time of Ninus king
Ninus begane with tirrannie
And Abraham with humility
Ninus began the first Impyre,
Abraham, of weir, had no desire
Ninus began Idolatry
Abraham in spreit and verity
He prayit to the Lord alone
Falls Imagerie, he wald have none
Of him discendit, I heir tell
The twelf Tribis of Israel
Their pepill maid adoratioun
With humyll supplicatioun
Till him quhilk was of king is king
That heuin and earth, maid of na thing
Deed Imagis, they held at nocht
That were with mennis handis wrocht
Bot the almychtie God of life,
My Sone now have I done discryfe
Their questionis at thy command.
The quhilkis thou did at me demand. Courteo.

Quhat was the cause (schir make me sure)
Idolatry did so lang endure
Outthrouch the warlde so generally
And with the Gentilis specialle? Experien*

(Quod he) sum causis principal
I find in my memorial
First was through Princis commandment
Quhilk did Idolatry invent
Syne singular profit of the Preistis
Payntoures, Goldsmythis, Masonis, wrichtis
Their men of craft, full curiously
Maid Imagis so plesandlie
And sauld them for ane sumptuous price
So be their crafty Merchandyce
They were maid rich abone mesure,
As for the Preistis, I the assure
Large profit gat ouerthort all landis
Throuch Sacrifice, and offerandis
And be their feigned sanctitude
Abusit money one man of good,
Daniell, iii.
As in the time of Daniell
The Preistis of this Idol Bell
Quhen Nabuchodonosor King
In Babylon royally did ring
Their preistis the king gart understand
That Image maid be mennis hand
He was ane glorious God of life
And had sic ane prerogatyfe
That be his greit power deuyne
Wald eit Beif, Muttoun, Breid, and wine
And so the king gart every day
Before Bell on his altar lay
Forty fresche vedderis fat and fine
And sax greit Rowbouris of wicht wine
Twelf greit Louis, of bowtit flour
Quhilk was all eittin in one hour
Nocht he that Image deif and dum
Bot be the Preistis all and sum
As in the Bibill thou may ken
Quhose noummer were three score and ten,
They, and their wyfis euerilk day
Eit all that on the Altar lay
Than Daniell in conclusioun
Schew the King their abusioun
And of their subteltie, maid him sure
Quhow underneath the tempill flure
Throuch ane passage they come be nicht
And eit that meit with candill licht.
The King quhen he the matter knew
Their preistis, with all their wyffis he slew
Thus subtellie the king was sylit
And all the people were begylit
My Sone (said he) now may thou ken
Quhow be the Preistis, and craftismen
And be their craftines and cure
Idolatry, did so lang endure.
Behauld quhow Ihone Boccatius
Hes wryttin workis wounderous
Off Gentilis supperstioun
And of their greit abusioun
As in his greit Buke thou may see
Of falls Goddis, the Genealogy
Of Demogorgon, in special
Fore Grandschir, till the Goddis all
Honourit amang Archadianis
And of the false Philistianis
With their greit deuyllische god Dagon
With vtheris Idolis money one
Bot I abhor the treuth to tell
Of the Princis of Israel
Chosin be God Omnipotent
iii. Reg. xi.
Quhow they brak his Commandment,
King Solomon, as the Scripture sayis
He dotit in his lattrer dayis
His wantoun wyffis to compleis
He curit nocht God till displeis
And did commit Idolatry
Worschipping caruit Imagerie
As Moloch god of Ammonites
And Chamos, god of Moabites
Astaroth, god of Sydoniens
So for his inodediens
And fowll abhominatioun
Were punist his successioun
His son Roboam, I heir tell
Tint the ten Trybis of Israel
For his Fatheris Idolatry
As in the Scripture thou may see.

In Babylon Idolatry repreuit
And wald not worschip their falls idol Bell,

How king Ninus Beildit the great City of Niniue. And quhow he Vincust
Zoroastes the King of Bactria.
THIS Ninus of Assyria King
Quhen he had maid his Conquesing
To Beild ane City, he him dressed
Choosing the place, quhare he thocht best
Quhare he had first Dominioun
In Assyria his awin Regioun
Thocht Assure as the Scripture sayis
Quhilk come before King Ninus dayis Gene. x.

And foundit that famous City
The quhilk was callit Niuiue
Bot as rehersis Diodore
Ninus that City did decore
So marvelous Triumphantly
As e sall heir Immediately
Upon the flude of Euphrates
Quhilk to behauld, greit wounder was.
Ane houndreth and fyftie stagis
That City was of lenth I wis.
The wallis ane houndreth fute of hicht
No wounder was thocht they were wicht,
Sic breid abufe the wallis their was
Three cartis mycht sydlingis on them pas,
Four hundredth stagis, and four score
In circute but mine or more
Of towris about those wallis I wene
Ane thousand, and five houndreth been.
Of hicht two houndreth fute and more
As wryttis, famous Diadore.
The Scripture makis mentioun
Quhen God send Jonas to that town

To schaw them of his punischement
Outthrouch the City quhen he went
Three dayis Iornay, till him it was
The Bibyli sayis, it was no les.
Experien.
My Sone, now have I schawin to thee
Of the buildyng of Niniue
For the agmenting of his fame
Ninus gart call it after his name.
Quhen he that greit City had endi^
To conques more it he intendit,
And did depart from Niniue
And rasit up ane greit Army
Of the may stalwart men and stout
Of all his Regionis round about,
In greit ordour tuke their Iornay
Towart the Realm of Bactria.
Of wicht fute men, I understand
He had seuintene hundredth thousand
Without horsemen, and weirlyke cartis
Quhome he ordourit in sindry partis
Quhilk till discryue I am nocht abill
Quhose noumer been so vntrowabill.
Zoroastes, that nobill King
Quhilk Bactria, had in governing,
That prudent Prince, as I heir tell
Did in Astronomy precell
And fande the Art of Magica
With Natural Science money ma
Seand king Ninus on the field
Fordwarte he come, with speir and scheild.
Four houndreth thousand men he was
In his Army their was no les.
And met king Ninus on the bordour
Rycht vaileantlie, and in good ordour.
On the Vangarde of his Army
On them he ruschit rycht rudely.
And of them slew as I heir say
Ane houndreth thousand men that day.
The rest that chapit war vnslane
To Ninus greit oist fled again.
Of that king Ninus was so noyit,
He restit never till he distroyit
All hole that Regioun up and down
And from the king did reif the croun,
And maid the Realm of Bactria
Subiectit till Assiria.
And in that samyn land I wis
He tuke to Wife Semiramis.
Quha (as mine Auctour dois discryue)
Was than the lustiest on live.
That beand done without sudgeorne
Till Niniue he did return
With greit tryumphe of victory
As mine auctour dois specify
Boith Occident and Orient
War all till him obedient.
It wald abhor the till heir red
The saikles blude that he did sched.
Quhen he had roung as thou may heir
The space of three and forty eir
Be and in his excellent glore
The dolent deith did him deuore.
In quhat sort I am nocht certane
Sum Auctor sayis that he was slane
And left till bruke his Heritage
One little Babe of tender age
oung Ninus was the Chyldis name
Quhilk after flurischit in greit fame.
Sum sayis that be his wyffis treasoun
King Ninus deit in presoun,
As I sall schaw, or I hyne fair
Quhow Diodore hes done declair.
Of the wounderful Deidis of the Queen Semiramis.
NINVS luffit so ardentlie,
Semiramis his fair Lady
Their was no thing scho wald command
Bot all obeyit was fra hand
Scho seand him so Amorous,
Scho grew proud and presumptuous,
And at the king scho did desire
Five dayis to govern his Impyre.
And he of his benevolence
Did grant her that preeminence
With Sceptour, Crown, and Rob Royal
And hole power Imperial,
Till five dayis wet cum and gone
That scho as king should regne alone.
Than all the Princis of the land
During that time maid her ane band
With bankat Royal merrily
Scho treatit them triumphantly
So the first day the people all
Come till her service bound and thrall
Bot or the secund day was gone
Scho tuke sick glore to regne allone
Be one decreit maid them amang
The king scho put in presone strange
I reid weill of his presonyng
Bot nocht of his deliueryng
Quhow ever it was in till his flouris
He did of death suffer the schouris
And mycht nocht lenth his life one hour
Thocht he was the first Conqueror.
Quhose Conquessing for to conclude
Was nocht but greit scheddyng of blude
Now have e hard of Ninus King
Quhow he began, and his ending
Quhowbeit mine auctor Diodore
Of him haith wryttin mekle more.
Princis for w^angous conquessing
Doith make often times ane evil ending.
Thocht he had lang prosperity
He endit with greit misery.
Of king Ninus Sepulture.
THE Queen ane Sepulture scho maid
Quhare scho king Ninus body laid,
Of curious crafty wark and wicht,
The quhilk had staidis nine of hicht
And ten staidis of breid it was
Diodore sayis it was no les.
For aucht staidis one mile thou tak
And their after thy noummer make.
So be this count, it was full richt
One mile, and als ane staid of hicht
Except the tour of Babilone
So hich one werk, I reid of none.
Semiramis this lusty Queen
Considering quhat danger been
To have ane king of tender age
Quhilk micht nocht use no Vassalage.
Scho tuke one curageous consait
Think and that scho wald make debait
Give any maid Rebellioun
Contrar her Sone, or his Regioun,
Quhome scho did foster tenderly
And kepit him full quietly
Scho laid apart her a win cleithing
And tuke the Raiment of ane King.
Quhen scho was in till armor dicht
Micht no man know her be one knicht,
Scho vaileantlye went to the weir
And to give Battle tuke no feir
Dantyng all Realms round about
That all the world of her had dout
More fortunate in her conquessing
Nor was her Husband Ninus king.
Babylon scho did fortify,
Templis and towris triumphandlie
So plesandlie did them prepair
Quhilk in the earth had no compair
Quhowbeid Nimrod, of quhome I spak
The hydduous doungeoun he gart make
And of the City the foundement
To quhome God maid Impediment.
Quhare Nimrod left their scho began
And put to wark money one man.
Of all the Realms round about
Of most Ingyne scho socht them out
Scho had wirkand with tree and stonis
Twelf houndreth thousand men at onis
Go reid the buke of Diodore
And thou fall find the noumer more.
On euerilk side of Euphrates
That nobill City beildit was
And so that river of renown
Ran throuch the midpart of the town.
Ouerthort that tlude scho briggis maid
Of marvelous strenth boith lang and braid.
They were five staidis large of lenth
On euerilk Brig scho maid one strenth.
The circuit as I said before
Four houndreth staidis, and four score.
The wallis hicht quha wald discryue
Three houndreth fute, three score and five.
Sax Cartis micht pas rycht esalie
Abufe the wallis of that City,
Sydlingis without Impediment.
Consydder be our Judgment
Give those wallis were hich or nocht
And also curiously were wrocht
As Diodore hes done defyne
Quhilk doith transcend my rude Ingyne.
Of Babylon the magnificence
To quhome e walde give no credence
Give I at lenth wald put in write

From Niniue, in Assyria
Till Babylon in Chaldea.

Quhow sic ane marvelous multitude

It may weill be my Sone (said he)
As be exempill we may see, Experien.

Quhow David king of Israel ii. San^^ xxiiii.

Be Ioab, his chief Capitane
As holy Scripture schawis plane
Of fecht and men, in to that land
He fand threttene houndreth thousand.
Sen David, in that small country
Mycht have rasit sic one Army.
To this Lady, it was no wounder
The quhilk had greter Realms ane hunder
Nor Dauidis little Regioun
Thocht scho had money ane Legioun
Off men mo nor I tauld before.
Tharefor my Sone, marvel no more
Staurobates, the king of Inde
Greitlie perturbit in his mind
Heiring of sick ane multitude
To make defense he did conclude.
And send ane Message to the Queen
Pray and her Majesty serene,
That scho wald of her special grace
Give him License to leave in peace
Fail and of that thocht he should des
That he sulde gar her fecht or flee.
And till his God ane vow he maid
Give no peace micht of her be had,
And give he wan the victory
That he the Queen sulde Crucify.
At this bosting the Queen maid bourdis
Say and it sall nocht be no wourdis,
Sall gar me pas, fra my purpose
Bot michtie straikis as I suppose.
The Messinger schew to the King
Of her presumptuous answering
Than Staurobates wise and wicht
Come fordwart like anenobill knicht
With money one thousand speir and scheild
Arrayit Royally on the field,
Think and he wald his land defend
Or in the Battle make ane end.
The Queen upon the other side
Full of presumptioun and of pride
Her Baneris plesandlie displayit
With hardy heart, and vneffrayit,
Upon Indus, that famous flude,
They met, quhare sched was mekle blude,
In Bote, in Balingar, and Bargis,
The two Armeis on vtheris chargis.
Semiramis the Battle wan
Quhare drowait and slane were money one man
So that the water of the flude
Ran reid myxit with mannis blude
The king of Inde, with all his micht
From Indus flude he tuke the flicht
Till his chief City, he reteirit,
Quhare in his presens their appeirit
In Battle raye ane new Army
Of richt Invincible Cheualrie
With Elephantes, ane hiddous noumer
Quhilk efterwart maid mekle cummer.
Semiramis and her cumpanie
In the mean time full cruelly
Distroyit the Bordouris of that land,
Tuke presonaris, ma than ten thousand.
Scho tuke ane curageous consait.
Greit Elephantis to contrefait.
Scho had ten thousand Oxin hydis
Weill se wit to gidder bak and sydis
With mouth and nose, teith, eiris and eine,
Quick Elephantis as they had been.
Rycht weill stuffit, full of stray and hay,
Quhare of the Indianis tuke affray.
Upon Camelis, and Dromodareis.
Those falls figuris with her scho careis,
Sere Indianis, quhen they saw that sicht
Efferitlie they tuke the flicht.
For sic one sitht was never seen
Give natural beistis they had been.
The King himself, was richt affeirit
Till he the verity had speirit,
And knew be his Exploratouris
They war bot feneit falls figouris.
Than manfully like men of weir
Fordwart they come withouttin feir.
Richt so Semiramis the Queen
Qubilk for one man was ay fyftene.
Their two Armyis full cruelly
They ruschit to gidder so rudely
With hydduous cry, and trumpettis sound
Till thousandis deed lay on the ground.
Semiramis had sic one noummer.
Till ordour them it was greit cummer.
Than the greit Elephantis of Jude
Richt strange and hardy of their kind
Ford wart they come, and wald nocht ceis
Ty^l throuch the middis of the preis
Of the greit Oist, they rudclie ruschit
That men and horse till erd they duschit.
Those feneit beistis withouttin spreit
Were fruschit and fuileit under feit.
The king of Jude with curage kene
Met with Semiramis the Queen,
He rydand on ane Elephand,
Bot scho with him faucht hand for hand,
And gave the King so greit assay
That he was never in sic affray
To straik at him scho tuke no feir
So weill scho vsit was in weir.
His strakis scho had bot little comptit
Were nocht the king was so weill montit
Ather at other straik so fast
Till they were tyrit at the last.
The King he thocht him self eschamit.
With one woman to be befamit,
And was determit nocht to flee
Thocht in that Battle he should dee,
As man the quhilk disparit been
He rudely ran upon the Queen,
And throuch the arm gaif her ane wound
Quhilk till her heart gave sic one stound
That scho constranit was to flee
Than all the rest of her Army
Quhen they persauit that scho was gone,
Till Indus flude they fled ilk one.
The Queen ouerthort the flude scho raid
On briggis quhilks were of botis maid,
With her ane sober cumpanie
Quhilk with her fled affrayitlie.
The Indianis followit on the chais
Than on the Briggis come sic one preis
Of fleand folkis, quhilk was greit wounder
So that the Bargis brak in schonder.
Sum sank, sum down the river ran,
Than drownit their, money ane nobill man,
Quhilk was greit pity till deplore,
As wryttis famous Diodore.
And finally for to conclude
Was never sched so mekle blude
At one time, sen the world began
Nor slane so money one saikles man,
And all throuch the occasioun
And the prydefull perswasioun
Of this ambitious wickit Queen
Sick one was never hard nor seen.
Staurobates the king of Inde,
Gretlye reioysit in his mind
Of this tryumphe and victory
Semiramis with heart full sorry
Seand sa money taken and slane
Till her country returnit agane,
Lamentand fortunis variance
Quhilk brocht her to so greit mischance
Before quhilk was so fortunate
And than of conforte desolate.
Her Sone ane man of perfectioun
Considerand his subiectioun,
His liberty he did desire
That he micht govern his Impyre,
Seand his Mother vicious
And with that so ambitious
As mine Auctor dois specify
He slew his Mother cruelly
Quhat other cause, or Intentioun
I find no special mentioun.
Sum sayis to be at Liberty
Sum sayis, for her Adultery,
None other cause I can defyne
Except Punitioun deuyne.
Of this fair Lady corageous
Behald the endyng dolorous
Quhilk was bot twenty eris of age
Quhen scho began her Vassalage,
And rang tryumphandlie but weir
The space of two and forty eir
Quhen scho was slane, scho was three score
With eris two, scho was no more.
As Diodore, wrytis in his buke
His Cronicle, quho list to luke.
Of this Lady I make ane end,
Thynkand no way, I can commend
Women for till be to manly
Nor men for till be womenlie.
For quhy, it been the Lordis mind
All Creature till use their kind.
Men for till have preeminence,
And women under obedience.
Thocht all women inclynit be
Till have the Soueranetie.
As this Lady, quhilk wald nocht rest
Till scho her Husband had suppressed
Till that intent that scho micht ring
Allone to have the governing.
Ladyis no way I can comend
Presumptuouslie quhilk dois pretend
Till use the office of ane king
Or Realms tak in governing.
Quhowbeit they vaileant be and wicht
Going in Battle like ane knicht
As did proud Penthesilea
The Princes of Amazona,
In mennis habit aganis resoun.
Siclyke I thynk derisioun
One Prince to be effeminate
Of knichtlie courage desolate,
Neglect and his authority,
Throuch beistlie sensuality,
Accompanyit both day and nichtis
With women more than vaileant knichtis
Sic kingis I discommend at all,
Exempill of Sardanapall.
Courteo.
Father (said I) schaw me how lang
The successioun of Ninus rang?
Experien.
That sall I do with diligence
My Sone (said he) or I go hence.
Sell I have schawin at thy desire
Quhat man began the first Impyre,
Now wald I it were to the kend
Of that Impyre the fatal end.
Howking Sardanapalus for his Vicious life, maid ane Miseravill end.
BETVIX this Conqueror Ninus,
And sensual Sadanapalus,
I can nocht find no special story
Worthy to put in memory,
Except quhilk I have done discryfe,
Of Semirame, king Ninus wife.
Bot I can find no good at all
To wryt of king Sadanapall,
Quhilk was the sext and threttie king
Belyne from Ninus discending,
At lenth his life for to declare
I think it is nocht necessare,
Because that money cunnyng clerkis
Hes him discryuit in their werkis
Quhow he was last of Assirianis
Quhilk had the hole preeminans,
That time of the first Monarchy
In Cronicles as thou may see.
The last, and the most vicious king
Quhilk in that Monarchy did ring.
That Prince was so effeminate
With sensual lust intoxicate,
He did abhor the cumpanie
Of his may nobill Cheualrie,
That he mycht have the more delight
Till use his beistlie appetyte
Conuersit with women nicht and day
And clothit him in their array
So that na man that him had seen
Culd Judge ane man that he had been.
So in Huredome and harlatrie
Did keip him self so quietly,
The Prencis of Assiriens
Of him they could get no presens.
Thus leuit he continually
Agane Nature Inordinatlie.
Quhen to the Persis and the Medis
Reportit were his vicious dedis
With the Rewlaris of Babilone
They did conclude all in till one
They wald nocht suffer for til ting
Abufe them sic ane vicious king
Bot Arbaces, ane Duke of Mede
He darflie tuke on hand that deed.
Bot first he come to Niniue
To see the king is Majesty
And till one of the kingis guard
He gaif ane secreit rich reward
Till put him in ane quiet place
Quhare he mycht see the kingis grace
And be unseen with any wicht
Bot he saw another king nor knycht
In till his Maisteris cumpanie
Except women allanerlie.
And as ane woman he was cled
With women counsalit and led
And schamefullie he was sittand
With spindle, and with Rock spinnand.
Quhen Arbaces that sycht had seen
His curage raise up from the spleen
And thocht it small difficulty
For till depryue his Majesty.
Than rasit he the Persianis
With Medis and Babilonianis
Ennarmit weill with speir and scheildis
Tryumphandlie they tuke the feildis
The King rasit Assirianis
To gyther with the Caldeanis
And them resystit as they micht
Bot finally he tuke the flicht
To saif him self in Niniue,
Than Segit they that greit City
Continually two eir and more
As wryttis famous Diodore
Till that the flude of Euphrates
Arais with sic one furiousnes
Quhare throuch ane grett part of the tonn
Be violence was doungin down.
Than quhen the king saw no remede
Bot to be takin or to be deed
As man disparit full of Ire
Gart make ane furious flammand fire
And tuke his gold and Iowellis all
With Scepture, Croun, and Rob Royal,
With all his tender Seruituris
That of his Corpse had greitest curis
To gidder with his lusty Quenis
And all his wantoun Concubenis,
And in that fire he did them cast
Syne lap him self in at the last
Quhare al were brynt in poulder small.
Thus endit king Sadanapall
Withouttin any repentance
As may be seen be this sentence
Heir followyng, quhilk he did indyte
Before his deith, in greit despyte
Quhilk is ane rycht ungodly thing
As e may see, be his dyting.
Epitaphium Sardanapali.
CVM te mortalem noris, presentibus exple
Delitijs animum, post mortem nulla voluptas,
Et venere, and caenis, and plumis Sardanapali.
Now have I schawin with diligens
The Monarchy of Assiriens
The quhilk at king Ninus began
And endit at this my scheant man
And did endure withouttin weir,
Ane thousand, two hundredth and forty eir
As dois indyte Eusebius.
Reid him, and thou sall find it thus.

FATHER I pray ow to me tell. Courteo.

Quhat notabil thingis yat befell

Become that woeful misery Genesis xix.

Of Sodom, Gomorre, and their Regioun
As Scripture makis mentioun.
Quhose people were so sensual
In fylthie Synnis unnatural
The quhilk in to my vulgar verse
My tongue abhorris to rehers
Like brutell beistis, by their myndis
Unnaturally abuse their kyndis
Be fylthie stink and Lechery
And most abominabill Sodomie,
As holy Scripture dois discryue
In that country were Citeis five
Quhilk were Sodom, and Gomorra
Seboim, Segor and Adama.
Amang them all, fund was their none
Vndefylit, bot Loath allone.
Holy Abraham dwelt neir hand by
Quhilk prayit for Loath effectuouslie,
For God maid him aduertysment
That he wald make sic punischement
To Loath two Angellis God did send
Him from that fury till defend.
Quhen the people of that Regioun
Saw the Angellis cum to the town
Transformit in to fair oung men
They purposit them for to ken
And abuse them unnaturally
With their foul stink and Sodomie.
Of that good Loath was wounder woe
And offerit them his Douchteris two
Them at their plesour for till use
Bot they his Douchteris did refuse.
And than the Angellis be their micht
Those men depryuit of their sicht
And so perforce leit them allone.
To Lothis lugeing quhen they were gone
They him commandit haisteilie
For till depart of that City.
That foul unnatural Lechery
Ane vengeance to the heuin did cry
The quhilk did move God till sic Ire
That from the heuin Bryntstone and fire
With aufull thounding ranit down
And did consume that hole regioun
Of all that land chapit no mo
Except Loath, and his Douchteris two.
His wife was turnit in ane stone
So wyfeles was he left allone.
For scho was Inobedient
And kepit no Commandment
Quhen the Angel gaif them command
Sone till depart out of that land
He monischit them under greit pain
Never to luke bakwart again.
Quhen Lothis wife hard the thoundring
Off flammand fire, and lichtning
The ugly cryis lamentabill
Of people most Espouentabill
For none of them had force to flee
Scho arnit that sorrowful sicht to see
And as scho turnit her anon
Scho was transformit in ane stone.
Quhare scho remanis still this day
Off her I have no more to say.
To schaw at lenth, I am nocht abill
That pietuous process lamentabill
Quhow Citeis, Castellis, Townis, and towris,
Villagis, Bastaileis, and Bowris,
They wet all in to poulder dreuin,
Forrestis, be the rutis vpreuin.
Their king, their Queen, and people all
oung and auld, brynt in poulder small
No Creature was left on life
Foulis, Beistis, Man, nor Wife
The earth, the Corn, herb, fruit and tree,
The Babbis, upon the Nutise knee,
Rycht suddandlie in one Instent
Unwarily come their Judgment
As it come in the time of Noy
Quhen God did all the world distroy
For that self Syn of Sodomie
And most abhominabill Bowgrie
That vice at lenth for to declare
I think it is nocht necessare.
Quhen al was brint, flesche, blude and bonis
Hillis, valleyis, stockis, and stonis,
The country sank for to conclude
Quhare now standis ane ugly flude,
The quhilk is callit the deed see,
Nixt to the country of Iudee.
Quhois stinkand strandis blak as tar
The fleuour of it, men felith on far
In till Oroatius thou may reid
Of that country the lenth and breid
Of lenth fifty mylis and two
And fourtene mile in breid also.
Loath of his wife was so aghast
That he till ane wild montane past
Of company he had no mo
Except his lusty Douchteris two,
And be their prouocatioun
As Moses makes narratioun Genesis xix.

Allone in to that montane wild
His Douchteris boith he gat with child
For they beleuit in their thocht
That all the world was gone to nocht
As it become of that Natioun
Thynkand that Generatioun
Wald faill, without they craftelie
Gar thate Father with them to lie
And so they fand ane crafty wyle
Quhow they their Father micht begyle,
And causit him to drink wicht wine
Quhilk men to Lycherie dois Inclyne
Quhen he was full, and fallin on sleip
His Douchteris quietly did creip
In till his bed, full secreitlie
Prouokand him, with them to lie.
And knew nocht quhow he was begyld
Till boith his Douchteris were with child.
And bure two Sonnis in certane
They beand in that wild Montane,
Of quhome two Nationis did proceid
As in the Scripture thou may reid.
In the quhilk scripture thou may see
At lenth this woeful misery.
This misery become but weir
From Noyis flude, three houndreth eir,
To gyther with four score and ellewin
As comptit Carrion full ewin.
And after Noyis deith I ges
Ane and forty eir their was
Quhen Abraham was of age I wene
Four score of eris, and nynetene
Quhen this foul Syn of Sodomie
Was punisit so rigorously.
Greit God preserve us in our time
That we commit nocht sic ane crime.
Tedious it were for me to tell
This Monarchy during quhat befell.
And wounderis that in earth were wrocht
Quhilk to thy purpose langis nocht.
As quhow the people of Israel
Exodi. i.
Did lang time in to Egypt dwell,
And of ^^are greit punitioun
Throuch Pharaois persecutioun.
Exodi. xiiii.
And quhow Moses did them conuoy
Throuch the reid sey, with mekle Joy
Quhare king Pharao, richt miserably
Was drownit with all his huge army.
Exodus xx.
And quhow that people wanderand was
Forty eris in wyldernes.
Moses that time as I heir say
Resauit the Law on Mont Sinay.
That time Iosue throuch Jordan Iosue. iii

Led those people to Canaan.
Quhare Saull David, and Salomone
With Hebrew Kingis money one
Did richely regne in that country
Enduring this first Monarchy.
The Sege of Thebes miserabill
Quhare blude was sched Incomparabill
Of nobill men, in to those dayis
With vtheris terribill affrayis.
As quhow the Grekis wrocht vengeans
Upon the nobill Trojans
Because that Paris did conuoy
Perforce fair Helena to Troy
Quhilk was king Menelaus wife
Quhare money one thousand lost their life.
That time the vailant Hercules
Outthrouch the world did him addres,
Quhare he did money ane douchtie deid
As in his storye thou may reid,
And quhow throuch Deianeir his wife
That Campion did lose his life
In flammand fire full furiously
The deith he sufferit cruelly.
That time Remus, and Romulus
Did found that City may famous
Off Rome standing in Italy
As in their storye thou may see
Wald thou reid Titus Liuius
Thou should find warkis wounderous.
Quhose doucthie deidis ar weill kend
And salbe to the warldis end
Thocht they began with cruelty
And endit with greit misery,
As been the manner to conclude
Of all scheddaris of saikles blude.
In Greece the ornate Poetry

Be Homerus, that famous man,
To gidder with Hesiodus
As diverse Auctouris schawis us.
It were to lang to put in ryme
The bukis that they wrait in their time.
Genesis xvii

As for good Abraham, and his seid
In to the Bibill thou may reid
Quhow in this time, as I heir tell
Began the kingdom Spirituell
As I have schawin to the before
Quharefor I speik of them no more.
Ane schort Description of the secund, third, and ferd Monarchy
FATHER (said I) Courteo.
quhilk was ye man
That the nyxt Monarchy began?
Cyrus (said he) the king of Perse, Experien.

As Cronicles hes done rehearse.
Prudent and full of Policy
Began the secund Monarchy.
For he was the most godly king
That ever in Perse or Mede did ring,
For he of his benignity.i. Ba^a. xxxvi.

Delyuerit from Captivity
The hole people of Israel
In to the time of Daniell.
The quhilkis had been presoneris
In Babylon sewin score of eris,
Tharefor God of his grace bening
Gave him ane Divine knawleging,
During his time as I heir tell
He vsit counsale of Daniell.
Carrion at lenth doith specify
Of his marvelous Nativity
And of his vertuus vpbringing
And quhow he vincust Cresus king
With money other vaileand deid
As in to Carrion thou may reid.
Quhose Successioun did endure
Till the tent king, thareof be sure.
Bot after his greit conquessing
Richt miserabili was his ending
As Herodotus, doith discryue
In Scithia he lost his life
Quhare the vndantit Scithianis
Vincust those nobyll Persianis
And after that Cirus was deid
Queen Tomyre hakkit of his heid
Quhilk was the queen of Scythianis
In the dispyte of Persianis.
Scho kest his heid, for to conclude,
In till ane vessel full of blude,
And said, their wordis cruelly
Drynk now thy fill, gyf thou be dry
Forthow did aye blude schedding thrist
Now drynk at layser gyf thou list.
After that Cyrus successoun
Of all the world had possessioun
Till Alexander with sword and fire
Obtenit perforce the third Impyre,
Quhilk was the king of Macedone
With vaileand Grekis money one
In battle fell and furious
Vincust the mychtie Darius,
Quhilk was the tent, and the last king
Quhilk did after king Cyrus ring,
As for this potent Empriour
Alexander the Conqueror
Give thou at lenth, wald reid his ring
And of his cruel Conquessing
In Inglis tongue, in his greit buke
At l^nth his life, their thou may luke,
Quhow Alexander that potent king
Was twef eris in his Conquessing.
And quhow for all his greit conquest
He leuit bot ane eir in rest
Quhen be his Seruand secreitlie
He poysonit was full pieteouslie.
Lucane doith Alexander compair
Till thounder, or fyreflaucht, in the air
Ane cruel Planeit, ane mortal weird,
Down thryngand people with his sweird.
Ganges that may famous flude.
He myx^t with the Indianis blude.
And Euphrates, with the blude of Pers
Quhose cruelty for to rehers
And saikles blude, quhilk he did sched
War richt abhominabill to be red.
After his schort prosperity
He deit with greit misery.
It were to lang for to decyde it,
Quhow all his realms were deuyde it,
Ay quhill that Caesar Julius
Quhen he had vincust Pompeius
Was chosin Empriour and king
Abufe the Romany for till ring.
That potent Prince, was the first man
Quhilk the ferd Monarchy began
And had the hole Dominioun
Of euerik land and Regioun
Quhose successouris, did regne but weir
Over the world money ane houndreth eir.
Bot gentill Julius allace
Rang Empriour, bot little space.
Quhilk I think petie till deplore
In five Month, and lytill more
Be falls exorbitant tresoun
That prudent Prince was trampit down,
And murdrest in his counsall house
Be cruel Brutus, and Cassius.
After that Julius was slane
Did regne the greit Octauiane.
Of Empriouris one of the best
During his time, was peace, and rest
Over all the world, in ilk Regioun
As storyis makis mentioun.
And als I make it to the plane
During the time of Octauiane
The Sone of God, our Lord Jesus
Tuke mankind of the Virgin treu.
And was that time in Bethleem borne
Math. ii.
To saif mankind, quhilk was forlorn.
As Scripture makis narratioun
Of his blissit Incarnatioun.
Now have I tald the as I can.
Quhow the four Monarcheis began.
Bot in thy mind thou may considder
Quhow warldlie power been bot slidder.
For all their greit Impyris ar gone
Thou seis their is no Prince allone
Quhilk hes the hole Dominiun
This time of every Regioun.
Father quhat reasoun, Courteo.

Reuaris to be of vtheris ringis
But any rycht, or Just querrell
Quhairthrouch that they micht make battle
And commoun people to dounthring
To this (said I) make answering?
My Sone (said he) Experien.
that sall be done
As I best can, and that richt sone
Their monarcheis, I understand
Preordinat were be the command
Of God, the Plasmatour of all
For to down thring, Dan. vii.
and to make thrall
Vndantit people vicious.
And als for to be gracious
To them quhilk virtuous were and good
As Daniell hes done conclude
At lenth in till his Propheceis.
Quhow their should be four Monarcheis.
His secunde Chepture, thou may see
Quhow after the first Monarchy
Quhen Nabuchodonosor King
Ane Image saw in his sleiping
With austeir luke, in hicht and breid,
And of fine pure Gold was his heid,
His breist and arms of silver bricht
His wame of Copper, hard and wicht,
His loynis, and lymmis, of Irne rich strange
His feit of clay, Irne myxt amang.
From ane montane their come alone
But haud of man, ane mekle stone
Quhilk on that Figours feit did fall
And dang all down in poulder small.
Of quhois Interpretatioun
Doctouris doith make Narratioun
The heid of gold, did signify
First of Assirianis Monarchy.
The silver breist, they did apply
To Persianis, quhilk rang secundly.
The wame of Copper, or of Bras
Thridly to Grekis, compairit was.
His loynis, and lymmis, of Irne and steill
Clerkis hes them compairit weill
To Romany, throuch their diligence
To have the ferd preeminence
Abufe all other Natioun
Be this Interpretatioun
The myxit feit, with Irne and clay
Did signify the letter day
Quhen that the world, should be deuydit
As efterwart salbe decydit
So Christ is signifyit the stone
Quhose Monarchy sall never be gone,
For under his Dominioun
All Princis sall be strampit down
Quhen that greit King Omnipotent
Cummis to his general Judgment.
His Monarchy than salbe knawin
As after salbe to the schawin.
And als the Scripture sall the tell
Quhow in the aucht of Daniell,
He saw in to his visioun
Be ane plane expositioun,
Quhow that ye Grekis, should wirk vengeans
Upon the Medis, and Persiens.
Comparand Greikis, till ane Gait
With ane horn, fers, furious, and, hait
Quhilk slew the Ram, with hornis two
Comparit till Perse, and Mede also
And so be Danielles Propheceis
All their greit mychtie Monarcheis
The quhilkis all other realms supprysit
Be the greit God, they were deuysit
As he of Titus the Roman
Sone and air to Vespasiane
Maid him ane furious Instrument
To put the Iowis to greit torment.
Quhilk I purpose or I hyne fair.
Schortlie that process till declair.
Of the most Miserabill, And most terribill Destructioun of Jerusalem.
Courteo.
FAther (said I) declare to me
Induryng this Ferd Monarchy
The may Infortune that befell?
Experien.
My Sone (said he) that sal I tell
The most and manifest misery
Become upon the greit City
Jerusalem, quhen it was suppressed
As storyis makis manifest.
Bot as the Scripture doith deuyse
Baru. vi.
Jerusalem was distroyit twyse.
First for the greit Idolatry
Quhilk they committit in Iowrie,
The honor aucht to God allone
They gave to Figuris of stock and stone.
Before Christis Incarnatioun
Come this first desolatioun
Five houndreth eiris, four score and ten
In Cronicles, as thou may ken,
Quhow Nabuchodonosor king
That famous City did down thring
Their King, with people money one
Brocht them all bound to Babilone,
Quhare they remanit presoneris
The space of three score and ten eris.
And that first desolatioun
Was callit the Transmigratioun.
Was no man left in all their landis
Bot Purellis laborand with their handis
Till michtie Cyrus, king of Perse
As Daniell hes done rehearse,
Was mouit be God, for till restore
The Iowis, quhare that they were before.
Give I neglect, I were to blame
The last Sege of Jerusalem,
Quhose rewyne was most miserabill
And for to tell rycht terribill.
Was never in earth, City nor town
Gat sic extreme destructioun.
The townis of Tire, Thebes, nor Troy,
They sufferit never half sic noy.
The Empriour Vespasiane
He did deuyse that Sege certane.
Their were the Prophecy compleit (...)

Quhilk Christ spoke on mont Olyueit
Quhen he Jerusalem beheld
The teris from his eine disteld,
Seand be deuyne prescience
The greit destructioun and vengence
Quhilk was to cum on that City
His heart was persit with piety
Sayand Jerusalem, and thou knew
Thy greit rewyne, sore wald thou rue
For no thing I can to the schaw
The verity thou will nocht know,
Nor hes in consideratioun
Thy holy visitatioun,
Thy people will no way considder Matthew xxiiii.

Quham gatherit I wald have to gidder
As errand scheip, been with their hirdis
Or as the Hen, gadderis her birdis
Under her wyngis tenderly
Quhilk they refusit dispitfullie,
Quharefor sall cum that dulefull day
That no remeidie make thou may.
Thy Doungeounis sal be doung in schonder
So that the world sall on the wounder.

Matthew xxiiii.

And as he said, so it befell,
As heir after I sall the tell.
Courteo.
Schaw me (said I) with circumstance.
The special cause of that myschance?
Experien.
(Quod he) as Scripture doith conclude
For schedding of the saikles blude
Of Prophetis quhilkis God to them send
And als because that they miskend
Jesus the Sone of God Souerane
Quhen he amang them did remane.
For all the myraklis that he schew
Maliciously they him misknew,
Thocht be his greit power divine

The water cleir he turnit in wine.
And be that self power and micht

And gave the crukit men their feit

They grew so boldin in their breistis,
The Scrybis, and Doctouris of the law
Of God nor man, quhilk stude none aw.
On Christ Jesus to wyrk vengeans.
Rycht so the false Phariseans
Ane Sect of feneit Religioun
Deuysit his confusioun
And send their seruandis at the last,
And with strange cordis they band him fast,
Syne scurgit him, Iho. xx.
both back and side
That none for blude mycht se his hyde
Their was nocht left ane penny breid
Vnwoundit from his feit till heid
In manner of Derisioun
They plet for him ane cruel Croun
Of pruneand thornis scharpe and lang,
Quhilk on his heavenly head they thrang.
Syne gart him for the greiter lack
Beir his awin Gallous on his back
Till the vile place of Caluarie
Quhare money ane thousand man mycht see.
That Innocent they tuke perforce
And plat him backwart to the Croce
Throuch feit and ha^dis greit naillis they thrist
Till blude abundantly out brist
Without grunsching, cl^^ our, or cry
That pane he sufferit patiently.
And for augmenting of his greuis
They hangit him beiuix two theuis
Quhare men micht se the bludie strandis
Quhilkis sprang forth of his feit and handis
From thornis thristit on his heid
Ran down bullering stremis reid
In the presens of money one man
That blude Royal on roches ran.
Schortlie to say, that heavenly King
In extrme dolor, their did hing
Till he said, Consummatum est,
With ane loud cry, he gaif the gaist.
Quhen he was deed, they tuke one dart
And persit that Prince, outthrouch the heart,
Fra quhame their ran, water and blude
The earth than trymlit to conclude.
Phoebus did hyde his bemis bricht
That throuch ye world their was no licht
The greit Veill of the tempill rave;
The deed men raise out of their grave,
And in the City did appeir
As in the Scripture thou may heir
Than Joseph of Arimathie
Did bury him, rycht honestly.
Iho. xx.
Bot it he rose full gloriously
On the third day tryumphandlie
With his Descipulis in certane
Forty dayis he did remane. Actis. i.

After that to the heuin ascendit
Their Iowis no thing their life amendit,
Nor gaif no credence till his sawis
As at more lenth, the story schawis
Bot cruelly they did oppres
All m^n, that Christis Name did profes
And persecutit money one
They presonit haith Peter and Ihone, Actis. v. Actis, vii

And Steuin they stonit to the deid.
From James the les they straik the heid.
This was the cause in conclusion
Of their cruel confusioun
The prudent Iow Josephus sayis
That he mes present in those dayis,
And in his buke makis mentioun,
Quhow after Christis Ascensioun
The space of two and forty eris
Began those cruel mortal weris,
The secund eir of Vespasiane
Quhare money, takin were and slane.
Josephus planely doith conclude
Was never seen sic one multitude
Before that time in to the town
Quhilk come for their confusioun
Their greit Infortune so befell
That all the Princis of Israel
Conuenit agane the time of Pace,
Bot till return they had no grace,
The bauld Romany with their Chiftane
Titus the Sone of Vespasiane
Their Army over Judea spread.
Than all men to the City fled
Beleuand their to get releif
Bot all that turnit to their myscheif.
The Romany lappit them about
That be no way they mycht wyn out
Sax Monethis did that Sege endure
Quhare lost were money one creature
Quhilk their in misery did remane
Till they were takin all and slane.
During the time of this assail
Their meit, and drynk, and all did fail,
For their was sic ane multitude
That thousandis deit for falt of fude
Necessity gart them eit perfors
Dog, Cat, and Ratton, Ass, and Horse.
Rich men behuffit to eit their gold
Syne deit of hunger money fold.
Sic hunger was without remeid
The quick behuffit to eit the deid.
The filth of Closetis money eit
To lenth their life they thocht it sweit.
The famous Ladyis of the town
For fait of fude they fell in swoun.
Quhen they micht get none other meit
They slew their proper Barnis to eit
Bot all for nocht dispytfullie
Their a win sowldiouris full gredilie
Reft them that flesche most miserabill
And they with murning lamentabill
For extreme houunger eild the spreit Luc. xxiiii

Their was the Prophecy compleit
As Christ before maid narratioun
The day of his grym Passioun
Quhen that the Ladyis for him murnit
Full pieteuslie he to them turnit,
And said, Douchteris murne nocht for me
Murne on our awin Posterity,
Within schort time sall cum the day
That men of this Cietie sal say,
Quhen they ar trappit in the snare
Blyst be the wame that never bare.
The baren papis, than they sall blis
That dulefull day e sall nocht mis.
This Prophecy it come to pas
That day, with money loud allas
Sic sorrowful lamentatioun
Was never hard in that Natioun
Seand those lusty Ladyis sweit
Deand for hounger in the streit,
Their husbandis, nor their childring
Mycht give to them no conforting
Nor it releue them of their harmis
Bot atheris deand in vtheris armis.
After this woeful Indigence
Amang them rose sic Pestilence
Quhare in their deit money hounder
Quhilk till declare, it were greit wounder.
And for final conclusioun
Those weirlyke wallis they dang down
Prince Titus, with his Cheualrie
With sound of troumpe Tryumphandlie
He enterit in that greit City.
Bot till declare I thynk pity
The panefull clamor horribill
Of woundit folk most miserabill
Their was nocht ellis, bot tak and slay
For their mycht no man wyn away.
The strandis of blude, ran throuch the streit
Of deed folk trampit under feit
Auld Wedowis in the preis were smorit
oung Virginis schamefullie deflorit.
The greit Tempill of Salamone
With money ane curious caruit stone
With perfyte pinnakles on hicht
Quhilkis were richt bewtifull and wicht
Quhare in rich Iowellis did abound
They ruscheit rudely to the ground
And set in till their furious Ire
Sancta Sanctorum in to fire.
And with extreme confusioun
All their greit Dungeonis they dang down.
Their bursin were the boldin breistis
Of Bischoppis, Princis of the preistis,
Their takin was the greit vengeans
On falls Scrybis, and Phariseans.
All their payncit Ipocrisie
That time micht make them no supply
That day they dulefullie repentit
That to the deith of Christ consentit
Thocht it was out Saluatioun
It was to their Dampnatioun.
The vengeance of the blude saikles
From Abell, Matthew xxiii.
till Zacharies
That day upon Jerusalem fell.
Bot tedious it were to tell
The greit extreme confusioun
And of blude sic effusioun
Was never slane so money ane man
At one time sen the world began.
The Iowis that day gat their desire
Quhilk they did ask in to their Ire
As been in Scripture specifyit
The day quhen Christ was Crucifyit Matthew xxvii.

Quhen Ponce Pilat the President
Said to them, I am Innocent
Of the Just blude of Christ Jesus
They cryit, his Blude licht upon ws
And on our Generatioun.
They gat their Supplicatioun
That day, with money cairfull cry
Their blude was sched aboundantlye.
Josephus wryttis in his buke
His Cronicle quho lift to luke
During that cruel Sege certane
Were ellewin houndreth thousand slane
Of presonaris, weill tauld and seen
Fourscore of thousandis, and sewintene.
Out of the land they did expel
All the people of Israel
And for their greit Ingratytude
They leave it under Seruytude.
Their is na Iow, in no country
Quhilk hes one fute of property
Nor never had withouttin weir
Sen this day fyuetene hundredth eir.
Nor never sall, I to the schaw
Till that they turn to Christis law.
Sum sayis, that Iowis money fald
Were thretty for ane penny sald,
As Judas said the King of glore
For thretty pennyis, and no more.
After that money were myscheuit
Quhe^ nouelles past, quhow la^g they leuit
Upon their Gold withouttin dout
They slit their bellyis to search it out.
The rest in Egypt, they did send
Presonaris to their lives end.
Titus tuke in his cumpanie
Greit noumer of the most worthy
With him to Rome he led them bound
Syne cruelly did them confound
His victory for till decore
And for Agmenting of his glore
Gart put them in to publict places
Quhare all folk, mycht behauld their faces
Syne with wild Lyonis cruelly
He gart deuore them dulefullie.
This hie Tryumphand mychtie town
At Pasche, was put to confusioun
Because that in the time of pace
They Crucifyit the King of grace.
Sum hes this matter done indyte
More Ornatlie than I can write
Quharefor I speik of it no more
Only to God be laud and glore.
Of the Miserabill end of Certane tirrannous Princis. And specially the
Begynnaris of the Four Monarcheis. ()
NOW have I done declare at thy desyris
As thou demandit in to termis schort
And quha began, the principal Impyris
As Cronicle and Scripture dois report
Quharefor my Sone, I hartlie the exhort
Perfytlie prent in thy remembrance
Of this Inconstant world the variance
The Princis of their four greit Monarcheis
In their most hiest pomp, Imperialis
Traistyng to be most sure set in their seis
The fraudful world gaif to yaim mortal fal^is
For their reward, bot dirk memoriallis.
Thocht ouir ye world, they had preeminence
Of it they gat none other recompense.
For siclyke as the snaw dois melt in May.
Throuch the reflex of Phoebus bemis bricht
Their greit Impyris, rycht so ar went away
Gone been their glore, their power and their micht
Because yai were reuares without in richt
And blude scheddaris, full cruel to conclude
Richt cruelly tharefor, was sched their blude.
Behald quhow God, ay sen the world began,
Hes maid of tyrrane Kingis Instrumentis
To scurge people, and to keill money one man
Quhilkes to his law were Inobedientis
Quhe^ they had done perfurneis his ententis
In dantyng wrangous people schamefullie
He sufferit them be scurgit cruelly.
Euin as ye scule master dois make ane wand
To dant and ding scolaris of rude ingyne
The quhilkis will nocht study at his command
He scurgis them, and only to that fine
That they should to his true counsale inclyne
Quhen they obey, and meisit been his Ire
He takis the wand, and castis in to the fire.
God of king Pharao, maid one Instrument
Quhilk was the greit king of Egiptiens
His awin peculier people to torment.
That beand done, Exo. vii.
he wrocht on him venge^s
And leit him fall, throuch Inobediens. Exo. xiii.

And finally, he with his greit Army
In the reid sey, them drownit dulefullie.
Rycht so, of Nabuchodonosor king.
God maid of him ane furious Instrument
Jerusalem and the Iowis, to down thring
Quhen they to God were Inobedient, Dan. ii^^.

Syne reft him from his riches and his rent
And him transformit in ane beist bru^ell
Seuin eris and more, as wryttis Daniell
Alexander throuch prydefull tirrannie
In eris twelf did make his greit conquest
Ay scheddand saikles blude full cruelly
Till he was king of kingis he tuke no rest,
In all the world, quhen he was full possessed
In Babylon thronit triumphandlie
Throuch poysoun strange, decesit dulefullie
Duke Hanniball the strange Chartagiane
The danter of the Romany pomp and glore
Be his power were money one thousand slane
As may be red at lenth in till his story
At Cannas quhar he wan the victory
On Romany ha^dis ye deed lay on ye ground
Three heipit Buschellis were of ringis found.
Into that mortal battle, I heir sane
Of the Romany, most worthy weriouris
By presonaris, were forty thousand slane
Of quho^ their was thretty wise senatouris
And xx. Lordis, ye quhilkes had dene Pretoures
That deit to in defense of their cuntrie
And for till hald their land at liberty.
Quhat reward gat this cruel Campioun
Quhen he had slane so greit one multitude
And quhen the glass of his glory was run?
Ane schamefull deith, and schortlie to conclude
This been reward of all scheddaris of blude
For he gad sic extreme confusioun
He slew him self in drinking strange poysoun.
Behald the two most famous Campiounis
(That is to say) Julius, and Pompey
Quhilkis did conqueis all erdlie Regionis
Alsweill maine land, as Ilis in the sey.
And to the town of Rome gart them obey
For Pompeius subde wit the Orient,
And Julius Caesar all the Occident.
Bot finally their two did strive for stait
Quhare throw three hundredth.M. me^ were slane
Bot Pompeius after that greit debait
He murdreisit was, the story tellis plane.
Than Julius was prince and Souerane
Abufe the hole world, Empriour and king
Bot in to rest, schort time indurit his ring.
For within five monethis, and little more
Amyd his Lordis in the counsale house
He murdresit was, quhat nedis process more?
As I have said, be Brute, and Cassius.
Gyf thou wald know, their dethis dolorous
Thou most at lenth, go reid ye Roman story
Quhilk hes this matter put in memory.
Gone is the goldin world, of Assirianis.
Of quhom king Ninus, was first and principal
Gone is the silver world of Persianis,
The Copper world of Grekis now is thrall
The world of Irne, quhilk was the last of al,
Comparit to the Romany in their glore,
Ar gone rychtso, I heir of them no more.
Now is the world of Irne myxit with clay,
As Daniell at lenth, hes done indyte.
The greit Impyris ar melted clean away.
Now is the world of dolor and despyte
I se nocht ellis, bot troubill infinyte
Quharefor my Sone, I make it to the kend
This world I wat is drawand to ane end
Tokninges of derth, hounger, and pestilence,
With cruel weris, both be sey and land
Realm aganis realm, with mortal violence
Quhilk signifyis, ye last day ewin at hand.
Quharefor my Sone be in thy faith constand
Raising thy heart to God and cry for grace
And mend thy life, quhil you hes time and space.
The fifth Spiritual And Papal Monarchy.
Courteo.
FAther Is their no Prince regnand
Quhilk hes the world now at command,
As had the Kingis of Assirianis
The Persis, Grekis, or the Romany
Quho hes now may Dominioun
Of euerilk land and Regioun?
Experen.
Their is no Prince, my Sone (said he)
That hes the principal Monarchy
Abuse the world universal
With hole power Imperial
As Alexander, or Darius
Or as had Caesar Julius
For Orient and Occident
To them were all obedient.
Nochtwithstanding, I find one King
Quhilk in till Europe doith ring,
That is the potent Pope of Rome
Impyrand over all Christindome.
To quhome no prince may be compair
As Cannon lawis can declair.
All Princis of the Occident
Ar till his grace obedient.
For he hes hole power compleit
Boith of the body and the spreit
Quhilk never had no Prince before
Except the michtie king of glore.
To Christ he is greit Lewtennand
In holy Peteris Sait sittand.
So he is of all kingis king
Quhilkis in to Europe now doith ring.
And as the Roman Empriouris
Having the world under their curis
Had Princis Knichtis, and Campionis
Rewlaris in till all Regionis
Vphalding their Authority
Using Justice and policy,
Rycht so this potent Pope of Rome
The Souerane king of Christindome
He hes in till ilk country
His Princis of greit gravity
In sum countries his Cardinalis
In their most precious apparaillis
Archtbischoppis, Bischoppis thou may se
Defending his authority.
With other potent Patriarkis,
Collegis full of cunnyng Clerkis.
Abbottis, and Priouris, as e ken
Misrewlaris of Religious men.
Officialis, with their Procuratouris
Quhose langsum law, spuleis the puris.
Archedenis, and Denis, of dignity
Greit Doctouris of Divinity.
Their Chantouris, and their Sacristanis
Their Tresoureris, and their Subdenis,
Legionis of Preistis Seculeris
Personis, Vicaris, Monkis, and Freitis,
Of diverse Ordouris money one
Quhilk langsum were for till expone,
In syndrie habitis as e ken
Different from other Christin men.
Fair Ladyis of Religioun
Professit in every Regioun.
Falls Heremitis, fassionit like the freiris
Proud parische Clerkis, and Pardoneris,
Their Gryntaris, and their Chamberlanis
With their temporal Courtissanis
Thus all the world be land and sey
His Sanctitude they do obey
Nocht only his spiritual Kingdom
Bot the greit Empriour of Rome
And kingis of euerilk Regioun
That day quhen they resaue their crown
They make aith of fidelity
Till defend his authority.
Moreover, with humyll reverence
They make till him obedience
Be their selfis, or Ambassadouris
Or vtheris Ornate Oratouris.
Quho doith gant stand his Majesty

Or haldis any Opinioun

Quhow he is another God nor man.

Far from our Souerane Lord Jesus
And till his kind contratious.
For Christ was God, Ihon. i.

The Cannon law, Expere^^
my Sone (said he)
That questioun will declare to the.
It dois transcend my rude Ingyne
His Sanctitude for till defyne
Or to schaw the authority
Pertening to his Majesty
So greit one Prince, quhare sall thou find
That Spirituallie may lous and bind.
Nor be quhame synnis ar forgeuin
Be they with his Disciplis schreuin
Quhame ever he bindis be his micht
They boundin ar in Goddis sicht,
Quhame ever he lousis in earth heir down
Ar lousit be God in his Regioun.
Als he is Prince of Purgatory
Delyuering saulis from pane to glory,
Of that dirk Dungeoun but dout
Quhame ever he plesis, he takis them out
Our secreit Synnis every eir
We mon schaw to sum priest or freir
And tak their Absolutioun
Or ellis we get no remissioun.
So be this way, they cleirlie ken
The secretis of all secular men.
Their secretis we know nocht at all
Thus ar we to them bound and thrall.
Quhat ever their Ministeris commandis
Most be obey it without demandis.
Quharefor my Sone, I say to thee,
This is ane marvelous Monarchy
Quhilk hes power Imperial
Boith of the body and the Saull.

Thocht money of them be now abusit
For Peter and Paul, with all the rest
Of their Brethren maid manifest
The law of God with true intent
Precheing the auld and New Testament.
They led their life in poverty
Deuotioun and Humylitie
As did their Master Christ Jesus.
And war nocht half so glorious
As their Successor now in Rome
Impyrand over all Christindome.
After the deith of Peter and Paull
And Christis true Discpulisall
Their Successouris within few ^erris
As at more lenth, chare story betis
Full craftelie clam to the hicht
From Spiritual life, to temporal micht.

Quhen did begin their temporal glore?

Or ever ane Paip gat any land

Bot nocht the Thrinfald Diadame
To weir three crounis they thocht great schame
Till Siluester the Confessor
From Constantine the Empriour
Ressauit the realm of Italy
Rychtso of Rome the greit City.
That was the rute of their riches
Than sprang the well of welthines.
Quhen that the Paip was maid ane king
All Princis howit at his bidding.
This Act was done withouttin weir
From Christis deith, three hundredth eir
Than Lady Sensuality
Tuke Lug^ing in that greit City,
Quhare schosensyne hes done remane
As their awin lady Souerane.
Than Kingis in till all Nationis
Maid Preistis greit foundationis
They thocht greit merit and honor
To conterfait the Empriour
As did David of Scotland King
The quhilk did found, during his ring,
Fyftene Abbayis, with temporal landis
Withouttin teindis, and offerandis
Be quhose holy simplicity
He left the Crown in poverty
Now have I schawin the as I can
Quhow their temporal Impyre began
Ascending up ay gre by gre
Abufe the Empriouris Majesty
So quhen they gat amang their handis
Of Italy, all the Empriouris landis,
After that in ilk country
Sprang up their temporalitie
With so greit riches and sic rent
That they began to be negligent
In making Ministratioun
To Christis true Congregatioun,
And tuke no more pane in their preching
And far les travel in their teching
Changeing their Spiritualitie
In temporal Sensuality.
Father thynk e that they ar sure Courteo.

Apperandlie, Experien.

Quhowbeit Chrstis faith, sall never faill

Considering their preeminence?
(Quod he) for Inobedience
Abusing the Commandment
Matthew xv.
Quhilk Christ left in his Testament,
Using their awin Traditioun
More than his Institutioun.
For Christ in his last conuentioun
Matthew xxviii. Job. xv. ^er. i.
The day of his Ascensioun
Till his Discipulis gave command
That they sulde pas in every land
To teache and preche, with true intens
His law, and his commandment.
None other office, he to them gave
He did nocht bid them seik nor crave
Cors presentis, nor offerandis
Nor get Lordshippis of temporal landis.
Bot now it may be hard and seen
Both with thine eris, and thine eine,
Quhow Prelatis now, in every land
Takis little cure of Christis command
Another in to their dedis nor sawis
Neglecting their awin Cannon lawis
Using them selfis contrarious
For the may part to Christ Jesus.
Mat. iiii
Christ thocht na schame to be ane precheour
And till all people, of treuth ane techeour
Ane Pope, Bischop, nor Cardidall
To teache nor preche, will nocht be thrall.
They send forth freitis, to preche for them
Quhilk garris ye people, mok yame with schame.

As in the Scripture thou may see

In Veneis that triumphand town
That nobill Empriour gart ly down
Upon his wame, with schame and lack
Syne tred his feit upon his back
In taikin of Obedience.
Their he schew his preeminence
And Causit his Clergy for to sing
Their wordis eftter following.
SVPER Aspidem and basiliscum ambulabir:
Psalm. lxxxxi.
Et conculcabis leonem and drachonem.
That is, thou sal gang upon the edder and the Coketrice.
And thou sall tred down the Lioun and the Dragoun.
Than said this humill Empriour

The Pope answerit with wordis wroith
Thou sall me honor and Peter boith.

Quhare on he mycht repose his heid.

They did contempne all property
And were richt hartfully content
Of meit drynk, and Abuilement.
To saif Mankind that was forlorn Iho. xix.

Christ bure ane cruel crown of thorn
The Pope three Crownis for the no^is
Of gold, poulderit with precious stonis.
Of gold and silver, I am sure.

And Peter during all his life

Quhare Christ forbiddith Marriage
Bot leifsum till ilk man to Marie

The Pope hes maid the contrar lawis

Under no les pain nor their ly^is
Thocht they have Concubynis fyftene
In to that case, they ar ouersene
Quhat chaistitie, they keip in Rome

Matthew xvii.
Christ did schaw his obedience
Onto the Empriouris excellence
And Causit Peter for to pay
Tribute to Caesar, for them tway.
Paul biddis us be obedient
To kyngis as the most excellent.
The contrar did Pope Selestene
Quhen that his Sanctitude serene
Did crown Henry the Emprioure
I thynk he did him small honor
For with his feit he did him crown
Syne with his fute, the croun dang down
Sayand, I have Authority
Men till exalt to dignity
And to make Emprioutis and kingis
And Syne depryue them of their ringis.
Peter be my Opinioun
Did never use sic Dominioun.
Apperandlie be my Judgment
That Pope red never the New Testament
Give he had lernit at that lore
He had refusit sic vane glore.
As Barnabas Peter and Paull
And rytht so Christis Discipulis all.
The Capitane Cornelius Actis. x.

Quhen Sanct Peter come till his house

Rycht so thy fallow, and thy brother

And lyikwyse Barnabas and Paull Act. xiiii.

In Listra, quhare they wrocht greit workis
The priest of Iuppiter, with his clerkis
And all the people with their auyce
Wald have maid to them Sacrifyce
Of quhilk they were so discontent
That they their clothyng rave and rent
And Paul amang them rudely ran
Sayand, I am ane mortal man
Give glore to God, of king is king
That maid heuin, earth, and every thing:
Sen Peter and Paul vane glore refusit
With Popis quhy sulde sic glore be vsit.
Peter, Androw, Ihone, James, and Paull,
And Christis true Discipulis all
Be Goddis word their faith defendit,
To birn, and skald, they never pretendit
The Pope defendis his traditioun
Be flammand fire, without remissioun,
Quhowbeit men brek the law Divine
They ar nocht put to so greit pyne
For huredome, nor Idolatry
For Incest, nor Adultery,
Or quhen oung Virginis ar deflorit
For sic thing men ar nocht abhorit.
Bot quho that eitis flesche in to lent

And give ane priest happynnis to marie
They do him baneis, curs, and wary
Thocht it be nocht aganis the law

Of lik ordout, the staitlie style.

Quhowbeit his mother milk the kow

With dow^yll clethyng from the called

For quhy, he hes none other pyne
Bot tak his teind, and spend it syne

And gif within two dayis or three

Quhilk hes the Spiritual dominioun,
And Monarchy, abufe all Christindome
Schaw me I make ow supplicatioun?
Experien
My Sone, wald I make true narratioun
(Said he) to Peter, and Paul, thocht yai succeid
I think they preue nocht that in to their deid.
For Peter Androw and Ihon were fischeares fine
Of men and women, to the Christin faith
Bot thai haif spread their Nec with huik and line
On tentis rich, on gold, and other graith
Sic fisching to neglect, they will be laith
For quhy, yai haif fischit in ouerthort ye strandis
Ane great part treuly of al te^porallandis.
With that the tent part of all good mouabil.
For the vphalding of their Digniteis.
So been their fisching wounder proffitabill
On the dry land, als weill as on the seis
Their hery water, they spread in all countries
And with their hois net, daily drawis to Rome
The most fine gold, that is in Christindome.
I dar weill say, within this fifty eir
Rome hes resauit forth of this Regioun
For Bullis and benefice (qubilk yai by full deir)
Quhilk myt full weil haif payit ane kings ranso^n
Bot war I worthy for to weir ane croun
Preistis should no more out substance so consume
Sending eirlie so great riches to Rome.
In to their tramalt net, thai fangit ane fische
More nor ane quhaill worthy of memory
Of quhome yai haif had money dainty dische
Be quhome they ar exaltit to greit glory
That marvelous monstour, callit Purgatory
Howbeit till us, it is nocht amiabill
It hes to them, been very profitabill.
Lat they yat fructeful fische eschaip their net
Be quhome they have so great commoditeis
Ane more fat fische, I traist they sall not get
Thocht they wald search ouerthort ye occeane seis
Adieu the daily dolorous Dirigeis
Selie pure preistis, may sing with heart full sorry
Want they that painful palice Purgatory.
Fair weil Monkrie, with Chanoun Nun and freir
Allace they will be lichtleit in all landis
Cowlis will no more be kend in kirk nor queir
Lat thai ye frutful fische eschaip their handis
I counsall them to bind him fast in bandis
For Peter, Androw, nor Ihon, culd never get
So proffitable ane fische, in to their net.
Their Merchandice, in till all Nationis
As prentit leid, their walx, and parchem ent
Their pardonis and their Dispensationis
They do exceid sum temporal princis rent
As for their Monkis their chanounis and yale Freiris
And lusty Ladyis of Religioun
I know nocht quhar to their office effeiris
Bot men may se their greit abusioun
They ar nocht like, in to conclusioun
Another in to their wordis, nor their workis
To the Apostilis, Prophets nor Patriarkis.
Gif presently their Prelatis can not preiche
Than lat ilk Byschop have ane Suffragane
Or successor, quhilk can the people teiche
On their expensis eirlie to remane
To cause the people from their vice refrane.
And quhen ane prelate, hapnith to deceace
Than put ane perfect preichour in his place.
Do they nocht so, on them sall ly the tharge
Geuand unable men Authority
As quho wald make ane steirma^ til ane barge
Of ane blind borne, quhilk can no dainger so
Give that schip droun, forsuth I say for me
Quho gaif that steirman sic commussioun
Should of the schip make restitutioun.
The humane Lawis, that are contrarious
And nocht conforming to the Law divine
They sulde expel, and hald them odious
Quhe^ thai persaue, them cu^ to no good fine
Inuentit bot be sensual mennis Ingyne
As that law quhilk forbiddis Marriage
Causing oung Clerks birn in lustis rage.
Difficill is Chaistitie till observe Romans vii.

But special grace, laubour, and abstinence
In till our flesche ay regnis till we sterue.
That first Original syn, Concupiscence,
Quhilk we throuch Adamis Inobedience

Quhill that our saull and body deith disseuer.

In Paradyce (as Scripture doith record)
In Galilie, rycht so I understand

To rest and greit felicity.

QVOD I) Father I heir me^ say
That their sal rise before yt day
Quhilk e call general judgment
One wickit man from satan sent
And co^trar to ye law of Christ
Callit the cruel Antechrist
And sum sayis that myscheuous man
Descend sall of the Trybe of Dan
And sulde be borne in Babilone
The quhilk dissaue sall money one.
Infidelis sall of every art
With that falls Propheit tak one part.
And quhow Enoch, and Elias

Bot finally his false Doctrine
And he sall be put to rewine
Bot another be the fire nor sword
Bot be the vertew of Christis word,
And gyf this be of verite
The suith I pray ow schaw to me?

And rycht so in the time of Ihone

And presently now in their dayis
Ar rycht money withouttin dout
Were their falls lawis weill soucht out*
Quha was one greiter Antechrist
And more contrarious to Christ
Nor the false Propheit Machomeit
Quhilk his cursed Lawis maid so sweit
In Turkey it they ar obseruit
Quhare throuch the hell he hes deseruit.
All Turkis, Sarazenis, and Iowis
That in the Sone of God nocht trowis ii. I^

Ar Antechristis I the declare
Because to Christ they ar contrare
Dan. viii
Daniell sayis in in his Propheceis
That after the greit Monarcheis
Sall rise ane marvelous potent king
Quhilk with ane schameles face sall ring
Mychtie and wise in dirk speikingis
And prosper in all plesand thingis
Throuch his falshed and craftines
He sall flow in to welthines
The Godly people he sall noy
By cruel deith, and them distroy,
The king of kingis he sall ganestand
ii These. ii
Syne be distroyit withouttin hand.
Paul sayis before the Lordis cumming
That their salbe one departing
And that man of Iniquity
Till all men he sall oppynuit be
Quhilk sall sit in the holy sait
Contrary God, to make debait.
Bot that Sone of Perditioun
Salbe put to confusioun
Be power of the holy Spreit
Quhen he his time hes done compleit
Believe nocht that in time cumming.
One greiter Antechrist to ring
Nor their hes been, and presently
Ar now, as Clerkis can epsy
Tharefore my will is that thou know
Qu^^r ever they be, that makis one Law
Thocht they be callit Christin men
By natural ressoun thou may ken
Be they never of so greit valor
Pape, Cardinal, King, or Empriour
Extolland their Traditionis

Makand Lawis contrar to Christ
He is ane verray Antechrist
And quho doith fortify or defend
Sic law, I make it to the kend
Be it Pape, Empriour King or Queen
Greit sorrow sall be on them Seen
At Christis extreme Judgment
Without that they in time repent,

Howbeit be diners coniectouris
And principal Expositouris
Of Daniell, and his Prophecy
And be the sentence of Elie
Quhilkis hes declarit as they can
How lang it is sen the world began
And for to schaw, hes done their cure
How lang they traist it sall endure
And als quhow money agis been
As in their warkis may be seen.
Bot till declare their questionis
Their been diverse opinionis
Sum wryttaris, hes the world deuydit
In sex ages (as been decydit
In to Fasciculus Temporum
And Crenica Cronicarum,
Bot be the sentence of Elie
The world deuyditis in three
As cunning Master Carioun
Hes maid plain expositioun
Quhow Elie sayis withouttin weir
The world sall stand sex thousand eir
Of quhome I follow the sentence
And lattis the other Bukis go hence
From the Creatioun of Adam
Two thousand eir till Abraham
From Abraham, be this narratioun
To Christis Incarnatioun,
Rychtso hes been two thousand eris.
And be their Prophecyis apperis
From Christ, as they make till us kend
Two thousand till the warldis end.
Of quhilkis ar by gone sickerlie
Five thousand, five hundredth, three and fifty.
And so remanis to cum but weir
Four hundredth, with sewin and forty eir.
And than the Lord Omnipotent
Should cum till his greit Judgment
Christ sayis the time salbe maid schort Matthew xxiiii.

As Matthew planelie doith report
That for the warldis Iniquity
The latter time sall schortnit be
For plesour of the chosin nummer
That they may pas from cair and cummer.
So be this count it may be kend
The world is draw and neir ane end.
For Legionis ar cum but dout
Of Antichristis were they soucht out
And money toknis doith appeir
As after schortlie thou sall heir
Quhow that sanct Iherome doith indyte
That he hes red in Hebrew write
Of fyftene signis in special
Before that Judgment General,
Of sum of them, I tak no cure
Quhilk I find nocht in the Scripture,
One part of them thocht I declair
First will I to the Scripture fair.
Mar xiii Matthew.xxiiii.
Christ sayis, before that day be done
Their salbe signis, in Sone and Move,
The Sone sall hyde his bemis bricht
So that the Moon sall give no licht
Sterris be mennis Judgment
Sall fall forth of the Firmament
Of their signis or we forther gone
Sum moral sense we will expone
As cunning Clerkis hes declairit
And hes the Sone and Moan compairit
The Son, to the stait spiritual
The Moon to Princis temporal
Rychtso the sterris they do compare
To the lawit commoun populare
The Moon and sterris, hes no licht
Bot be reflex of Phoebus bricht
So quhen the Son of lycht is dirk
The Moon and sterris, mon be mirk
Rychtso quhen Pastouris spiritualis
Popis Bischopis, and Cardinalis
In their beginning, schew greit licht
The temporal stait, was rewlit richt.
Bot now allace, it is nocht so
Those schynand Lampis been ago
Their Radious bemis ar turnit in reik
For now in earth, no thing they seik
Except riches, and Dignity
Following their Sensuality
Money Prelatis ar now regnand
The quhilkis no more dois understand
Quhat dois pertene to their office
Nor thou can kendle fire with Ice.
Woe to Popis I say for me
Quhilk sufferis sic Enormitie
That Ignorant warldlie Creaturis
Should in the kirk have any curis.
No marvel thocht the people slide
Quhen they have blind men to their gyde.
For ane Prelate, that can nocht preiche
Nor Goddis law, to the people teiche, Esaias. lvi

Esaias comparith him in his wark
Till ane dum Dog, that can nocht bark.
And Christ him callis in his grief Ihne. x.

Most lyk ane murderer or ane theif
The cunning Doctor Augustine
Wolfis, and Deuillis, doith them de fine.
The Canon law doith him defame
That of ane Prelate beris the name
And will nocht preiche the Divine Lawis
As the Decreis planely schawis.
Bot those that hes authority
To provide spiritual Dignity
Mycht give they plesit to tak pane
Gar them licht all their Lampis agane.
Bot ever allace, that is nocht done
So derknit been boith Son and Moan.
War kingis lyuis weill declarit
The quhilkis ar to the Moon comparit

From Charity degenerat
I thynk they should think mekle schame
Of Christ for to tak their Surname
Syne leif nocht like to Christianis
Bot more lyk Turkis, and to Paganis
Turk contrar Turk makis little weir,
Bot Christian Princis takis no feir
Quhilkis should agree as brother to brother
Bot now ilk ane dyngis down ane other

And France richtso with greit rigor

And richt swa France agane Ingland
Ingland also aganis Scotland,
And als the Scottis with all their micht

Nor be no way, they can considder
That they may have lang Piece to gidder

Thocht Christ the souerane king of grace

Till their be money ane thousand slane

As all the world may understand.
Father I thynk that temporal kingis. Courteo.

For I haif seen the spiritual stait
Make weir their richtis till deba^t.
I saw Pape Julius manfully
Pas to the field tryumphantlie
With ane rycht aufull Ordinance
Contrair Lowes, the king of France
And for to do him more despyte
He did his Regioun interdyte.
My Sone (said he) Experien.

That langis weill till our purpose
How Sone and Moan, ar boith denude
Of lycht, as Clerkis doith conclude
Comparing them, as e hard tell

And comoun people half despairit

And specially in to their deidis

Quhat doith auaill religious weidis
Quhen they ar contrar in their deidis
Quhat holiness is their within
Ane wolf cled in ane wedder skin

The day of Judgment drawis neir.
Now let us leif this moral sense
Proceiding till our purpose hence
And of this matter speik no more
Beginning quhare we left before.

Quharfor my sone, I pray ye not pretend

Impassibil, and so Celestial
That fire nor sword, may do to yaim no pane
Nor heit, nor called, nor frost, nor wind, nor rane
Thocht sic thing were, may do to yaim no deir

As flammand Phoebus, in his Mansioun

Quhen every one, in to that Regioun

Let us with Paull desire to see that sicht

To be dissoluit, Paull had ane great desire
With Christ, to be in till the heuin Empire.
And moreatour, as Clerkis can discryue,
Their marvelous mirthis, beis inco^parabil
Amang the rest, in all their wyttis five
They sall have sensual plesouris delectabeil
The heuinly so^nd, quhilk salbe Inenarrabill
In their eitis, continually sall ring
And als the sicht of Christ Jesus our King,
In his triumphant Throne Imperial

And with their Spiritual Eis salbe seen
That sicht, quhilk been most superexcelland

Continually that sicht contempland.
Augustine sayis, he had lever tak on hand
To be in Hell, he seeing the essence
Of God, nor be in Heuin, but his presence.
Quho seis God, in his Divinity
He seis in him, all other plesand thingis
The quhilk with tongue, can not pronuncit be
Quhat plesour been, to se that king of kingis
The gretest pane, ye damnit folk down thringes
And to the Deuillis, the most punitioun
It is of God, to want fruitioun.
And mairattouer, they sall feill sic ane smell.
Surmonting far, ye flewour of erdly flouris
And in their mouth, ane tatst as I heir tell
Of sweit, and Supernatural Sapouris
Als they sall se, the heavenly bricht colouris

Quhilk til discryue, tra^scendis ma^nis ingyne
And als they sall have sic Agilite.
In one Instant, to pas for their plesour
Ten thousand mylis, in twinkling of ane Ee
So their Ioyis, salbe without mesour
They sall Reioyis, to se the greit dolor
Of dampnit folk in hell, and their torment
Because of God, it is the Just Judgment.
Subtilite they sall have maruellouslie
Supponing that their were one wall of bras
One glorifyit body, may rycht haistelie
Out throw that wall, without impediment pas
Siclyke as dois the sone beme throw ye glass
As Christ till his Discipulis did appeir

All entres clos, and none of them did steir.
Quhowbeit in heuin, thocht euerilk creature

it euerilk one sall have so greit pleasure
And so content, they sall desire no more
To have more Joy, they sal no way implore
Bot they salbe all satisfyit and content
Like to this rude exempill subsequent.
Take ane crowat, ane pynt stop, and ane quart
One galoun pitchair, ane punsion and ane tun,
Of wine, or balm, gif euerilk one their part
And fill them full, til that they be over run
The little crowat in comparisoun
Salbe so full, that it may hald no more
Of sic mesuris thocht their be twenty score.
In to the Tun, or in the Punsioun
So all those veschellis, in one qualite
May hald no more, without they be over run
it have they nocht alyke in quantite
So be this rude exempill thou may se
Thocht euerilk one, be nocht alike in glore
Ar satisfyit so, that they desire no more.
Thocht presenlie be Goddis purwiance
Beistis, foulis, and fischis in the seis
Ar necessar now, for mannis sustinance
With cornis, herbis, flouris, and fruetful treis,
Than sall their be none sic commoditeis
The earth sall beir no plant, nor beist brutall
Bot as the Heuinnis bricht like burall.
Suppone su^ be on earth, walkand heir down.
Or hich abone, quhare ever they pleis to go
Of God, they have ay cleir fruitioun
Boith est or west, up down, or to or fro
Clerkis declaris plesouris money mo
Quhilk dois tra^scend al mortal ma^nis i^gyne
The thousand part of those plesouris divine
In to the Heuin, they sall perfytlie know
Their tender freindis yair fader and yair mother
Their predecessouris, quhilkes they never saw
Their spousis, barnis, sister, and their brother
And euerilk one, sall have sic lufe till other
Of vtheris glore, and Joy, they sall reiose
As of their a win, as Clerkis doith suppose.
Than salbe seen, that bricht Jerusalem. Apoc. xxi

Quhilk Ihone saw, in his Reuelatioun
Esa. lxvi
We mortal men, allare ar far to blame
That will nocht have consideratioun
And ane continual contemplatioun
With hot desire, to cum unto that glore
Quhilk plesour sall endure for ever more.
To. viii.
O Lord our God, and king Omnipotent
Quhilk knew or yt the heuin, and earth, create
Quho wald to the be inobedient
And so deserve, for to be reprobate
Thou knew the noumer of predestinate
Quho^ thou did call, and hes them Iustifyi^
And sall in heuin with the be glorifyit.
Grant us to be Lord, of that chosin sort
Quhame of thy Mercy Superexcellent

With the blude of that holy Innocent
Jesus, quhilk maid him self Obedient
Unto the deith, and steruit on the Rude
Let us O Lord, be purgit with that blude.
To. viii.
All Creature, that ever God Create
As wryttis Paull, they wis to se that day

Quhen the Children of God predestinate

Quhe^ corruptioun heis clengit clean away
And changit beis, their mortal qualite
In the greit glore, of Immortalite.
And moreattour, all deed thyngis corporal.
Under the Concaue, of the Heuin Empire
That now to laubour, subject ar and thrall
Sone, moan, and sterris, earth, water, air, and fire.
In one manner, they have ane hot desire
Wissing that day, that they may be at rest
As Erasmus, exponeth Manifest.
We se the great Globe of the Firmament
Continually, in moving marvelous
The sewin Planetis, contrary their intent
Ar reft about, with course, contrarious
The wynd, and sey, with storms furious
The trou^lit air, with frostis, snaw, and rane,
Onto that day, they travel ever in pane.
And all the Angellis, of the Ordouris nine
Hauand compassioun of our Misereis
They wis after that day, and to that fine
To se us fred, from our Infirmiteis
And clengit from their greit Calamiteis
And troublous life, quhilk never sal haif end
Unto that day, I make it to the kend.
Ane Exhortatioun Geuin be Father Experience, unto his Sone, the Courteour.

And rauis yaim from yair rent, riches and ringis
Thairfor on Christ confirm thine hole i^tent
And of thy calling, be richt weill content

All neidfull thing for thee, he sall prepair.

To this vnhape, all subject ar and thrall
Quhilk Misery but dout sall ever endure
Till the last day, my Sone thareof be sure.
That day, as I have maid Narratioun,
Salbe the day of Consolatioun
Till all the Children of the chosin noumer,

And als I make the supplicatioun
In erthlie materis, tak the no more cummer.
Dreid not to de, for deith is bot ane slummer.
Leave ane Just life, and with ane Joyous heart,
And of thy gudis tak plesandlie thy part.
Of our talking, now let us make ane end,
Behald quhow Phoebus, dounwart dois descend
Cowart his Palice, in the Occident.
Dame Cynthia I se scho dois pretend,
In till her wattrie Regioun till ascend,
With vissage paill, up from the Orient.
The dew now donkis the Rosis redolent.
The Mariguldis, that all day were reioisie
Of Phoebus heit, now craftily ar closit.
The blysfull Birdis bownis to the treis,
And ceissis of their heavenly harmoneis.
The Cornecraik in the croft, I heir her cry,
The Bak, the Howlat, febyll of their eis,
For their pastyme, now in the euinning fleis.

Her natural notis, peirsit throuch the sky,
Till Cynthia, makand her observance,

And Venus rising with bemis cleir.
Quharefor my Sone, I hald it time to go.
Wald God (said I) e did remane all eir,
That I mycht of our heavenly Lessonis leir.
Of our departing, I am wounder woe.
Tak patience (said he) it mon be so.
Perchance I sall return with diligence
Thus I departit from Experience.
And sped me home, with heart siching full sore,
And enterit in my quiet Oritore.
I tuke paper, and their began to write
This Misery, as e have hard before.
All gentle Redaris, hartlie I Implore
For till excuse my rural rude Indyte.
Thocht Phariseis will have at me despyte,
Quhilkes wald not that their craftines were kend.
Lat God be Judge, and so I make ane end.

THE PROLOG
So thocht I had ingyne, as I have none,
I wat nocht quhat to wryt be sweit sanct Ihone
(For quhy) in all the garth of Eloquence
Is no thing left, bot barrane stok and stone.
The Polite terms ar pullit euerilk one,
Be their forenamit Poeitis of prudence
And sen I find, none other new sentence,
I sall declair, or I depart ow fro,
The Complaynt of ane woundit Papingo.
Quharefor, because mine matter been so rude,
Of sentence, and of Rethorike denude,
To rural folk, mine dy^ing been directit,
Far flemit from the sicht of men of good.
For cunning men, I know will sone conclude,
It dow no thing, bot for to be deiectit.
And quhen I heir mine matter been detrectit,
Than sall I sweir, I maid it bot in mowis
To landwart lassis, quhilkes kepith ky and owis.
The complaint of the Papingo.
QVho clymmis to hich, perforce his feit mon faill
Expreme I sall that be Experience,
Give that ow pleis, to heir one pieteous taill,
How one fair Bird be fatal violence
Deuorit was, and micht make no d^fence
Contrair the deith, so faileit Natural strenth,
As after I sall schaw ow at more lenth.
One Papyngo richt plesand and perfyte,
Presentit was till our most nobill King
Of quhom his grace one lang time had delight,
More fair of form, I wat flew never on wing.
This proper bird he gave in governing
To me quhilk was his simpyll seruiture,
On quhome I nid my diligence and cure.
To learn her language Artificial
To play platfute, and quhissill fute before,
Bot of her Inclynatioun Natural
Scho countrafaitit all fowlis les and more
Of her curage, scho wald without my lore,
Sing like the Merle, and craw like to the cok,
Pew like the Gled, and chant like the Lauerok.
Bark like ane Dog, and kekill like ane ka,
Blait like ane Hog, and buller like ane bull,
Gaill like ane goik, and greit quhe^ scho was wa^
Clym on ane cord, syne lauch, and play the fule,
Scho micht have been ane menstrall agane ule,
This blyssit bird was to me so plesand
Quhare ever I fure, I bure her on my hand,
And so befell, in till ane mirthfull morrow,
In to my garth, I past me to repose,
This bird and I, as we were wount aforrow,
Amang the flowris fresche, fragrant, and formose.
My vital spreitis dewlie did reiose
Quhen Phoebus rose, and rave the cloudis sabill
Throuch brichtnes of his bemis amyabill.
Without vapor was weill purificate
The temperate air, soft, sober, and serene.
The earth, be Nature so edificate
With holsum herbis, blew, quhyte, reid, and grene,
Quhilk eleuate my spreitis from the spleen
That day Saturn, nor Mars, durst not appeir,
Nor Eole, of his Coue he durst nocht steir.
That day perforce behuffit to be fair,
Be influence, and course celestial.
No Planeit preisit for to perturb the air,
For Mercurius, be mouyng natural
Exaltit was, in to the throne tryumphall
Of his Mansioun, unto the fyftene gre
In his awin souerane sign of Virgin.
That day did Phoebus plesandlie depart,
From Gemini, and enterit in Cancer.
That day Cupido, did extend his dart,
Venus that day coniunit with Iuppiter.
That day Neptunus, hid him like one sker,
That day dame Nature, with greit besines
Fortherit Flora, to kith her craftines.
And retrograde was Mars, in Capricorn,
And Cynthia, in Sagittar asseisit,
That day dame Ceres, gods of the corn
Full Joyfully Iohne Vponland applesit.
The bad espect of Saturn was appeisit,
That day be Juno, of Iuppiter the Joy
Pertuband spreitis causing to hald coy,
The sound of birdis, surmontit all the skyis,
With melody of notis Musical,
The balmy droppis of dew Titan vpdryis
Hingand upon the tender twistis small.
The heavenly hew, and sound Angelical,
Sic perfyte plesour, printit in mine heart
That with greit pyne, from thine I micht depart.
So still amang those herbis amiabill
I did remane one space, for my pastance.
Bot warldlie plesour, been so variabill,
Myxit with sorrow, dreid, and Inconstance,
That their in till is no contynuance.
So micht I say, my schort solace allace,
Was dreuin in dolor, in one little space
For in that garth, amang those fragrand flouris
Walkyng allone, none bot my bird and I.
Unto the time, that I had said mine houris,
This Bird I set upon one branche me by.
Bot scho began to speill richt spedilie,
And in that tree scho did so hich ascend,
That be no way I micht her apprehend.
Sweit bird (said I) be war mont nocht over hie,
Return in time, perchance thy feit may fail,
Thou art richt fat, and nocht weill vsit to fle,
The gredie gled, I dreid scho the assail.
I will said scho ascend, veil quod veil,
It is my kind, to clym ay to the hicht
Of fether and bone, I wat weill I am wicht.
So on the hichest little tender twist
With wyng displayit, scho sat full wantounlie.
Bot Boreas blew one blast, or ever scho wist,
Quhilk brak the branche and blew her suddandlie
Down to the ground, with money cairfull cry
Upon ane sto^, scho lichtit on her breist,
The blude ruschit out, and scho cryit for a priest.
God wat gyf than my heart was woe begone,
To se that fowl flychter amang the flouris,
Quhilk with greit murning, began to make her moan:
Now cummin ar (said scho) the fatal houris
Of bitter deith, now mon I thole the schouris.
O dame Nature, I pray the of thy grace,
Len me laiser to speik one little space,
For to complene my fate Unfortunate,
And to dispone my geir or I depart,
Sen of all confort I am desolate
Allone, except the deith heir with his dart,
With aufull cheir, reddy to pers mine heart
And with that word, scho tuke one passioun,
Syne flatlingis fell, and swappit in to swoun.
With sorry heart, persit with compassioun,
And salt teiris, distillyng from mine Ene,
To heir that birdis lamentatioun,
I did approach, under ane Hauthorne grene
Quhare I micht heir, and se, and be unseen
And quhen this bird had swounit twyse or thryse
Scho began to speik, saying on this wise.
O falls Fortune, quhy hes thou me begylit?
This day at morn quho knew this cairfull case?
Vane hope in the my resoun haith exylit,
Having sic traist in to thy feneit face,
That ever I was brocht in to the court allace:
Had I in forest flowin amang my feiris,
I mycht full weill have leuit money eiris.
Prudent counsel, allace I did refuse,
Agane resoun, using mine appetyte.
Ambitioun did so mine heart abuse,
That Eolus, had me in greit dispyte.
Poeitis, of me haith matter to indyte,
Quhilk clam so hich, and woe is me tharefore,
Nocht douting, that the deith durst me deuore,
This day at morn, my form and feddrem fair,
Abufe the proud Pacok war precelland
And now one catyue carioun full of tair
Bathand in blude, down from my heart distelland
And in mine eir, the bell of deith been knelland.
O falls world, fie on thy felicite
Thy Pride, Avarice, and Immundicite.
In the I se no thing been permanent,
Of thy schort solace, sorrow is the end,
Thy falls Unfortunate giftis been bot lent,
This day full proud, the morn no thing to spend,
O e that doith pretend ay till ascend,
My fatal end, have in rememberance,
And ow defend, from sic unhappy chance.
Quhydder that I was strickin in ecstasy,
Or throuch one stark Imaginatioun,
Bot it appeirit in mine Fantasy,
I hard this dolent lamentatioun.
Thus dullit in to desolatioun,
Me thocht this bird, did breue in her maneir
Her counsall to the King, as e sall heir.
The first Epystill of the Papyngo, Directit to king James the Fyft.

Thus thou may be of all plesouris repleit,

And sen the Definitioun of ane king,

Addres the first, abufe all other thing,
Till put thy body, till sic Ordinance,

For quhow should Princis govern greit regionis
That can not dewly gyde their awin personis?
And give thy grace wald leif rycht plesandlie,
Call thy counsall, and cast on them the cure.
Their Just Decreitis defend, and fortify,
But good counsall, may no Prince lang endure,
Wyrk with counsall, than sall thy work be sure.
Cheis thy counsale, of the most Sapient,
Without regard, to blude, riches, or rent.

Of euerilk Prince, after his qualite.
Thocht they be deed, their deidis sall nocht de,

As thou deseruis, put in memory.
Requeist that Roy, quhilk rent was on the rude,

For Princes dayis Induris bot ane drame.
Sen first king Fergus bure ane Dyadame,

And all ar deed, and none bot thou on live.

And moist part in their awin misgouernance.

Of vertew than, exalt thy saillis on hie,

Quhen suddandlie one doith oppres one other,
Lat Justice myxit with mercy them amend.
Have thou their hartis, thou hes yneuch to spend.
And be the contrair, thou art bot king of bone,
From time thine heiris hartis been from the gone.

Because allace, I was Incounsolabill,

The Secund Epistill of the Papyngo, directit to her Brether of Court.
BBETHER of court, with mind precordiall
To the greit God, hartlie I commend ow,
Imprent my fall, in our memorial,
To gidder with this E^dull that I send ow.
To preis over hich, I pray ow not pretend ow,
The vane ascens of court, quho will considder,
Quho sittith most hie, sal ^ind ye sait most slidder.
So e that now, be lansing up the ledder,
Tak tent in time, fest^^ning our singaris fast.
Quho climmis most hich, most dint hes of ye wedder
And leist defense aganis the bitter blast,
Of falls fortune* quhilk takith never rest,
Bot most redoutit daily scho down thringis,
Not sparing Paipis, Conquerouris, nor Kingis.
Thocht e be montit up above the skyis,
And hes boith King, and court in governance,
Su^ was als hich, quhilk now richt lawly lyis,
Complanyng sore the courtis variance.
Their pret^rite time, may be experience,
Quhilk throw vane hope of court did clym so hie,
Syne wa^tit wingis, quhe^ they wend best to fle.
Sen ilk court been vntraist and transitory,
Changing als often, as weddercok in wind,
Sum make and glaid and other sum richt sorry,
Formaist this day, the morn may go behind,
Lat not vane hope of court our resone blind.
Traist weill sum me^, will gif ow laud as lordis,
Quhilk wald be glaid, to se ow hang in cordis,
I durst declair the myserabilite,
Of diverse courtis, war not my time been schort
The dreidfull change, vane glore, and vilite
The painful plesour, as Poeitis doith report
Sum time in hope, sum time in disconfort,
And how su^ me^ dois spend their outheid haill
In Court, syne endis in the hospytaill.
Quhow sum in court been quiet counsalouris,
Without regard to commoun weill or kingis,
Casting their cure for to be Conquerouris.
And quhen they been hich raisit in their ringis.
How change of court yam dulfully down thringes,
And quhen they been from their estait deposit
Quhow money of their fall been richt reiosit.
And quhow fond feneit fulis and flatteraris
For small service obtenis greit rewardis.
Pandaris, pykthankis custrouis, and clatteraris,
Loupis up from laddis, syne lichtis amang lardis,
Blasphemarouris, beggaris, and co^moun bairdis,
Sum time in Court hes more auctorite,
Nor deuote Doctouris in Divinity.
Quhow in sum chuntre been barnis of Beliall.
Full of dissimulit payntit flattery,
Prouocand be Intoxicat counsall
Princis till huredome, and till hasardrie,
Quho dois in Princis prent sic harlotrie
I say for me sic pert prouocatouris
Should punischet be abufe all strange tratouris.
Quhat trauers, troubill and Calamite?
Haith been in court, within their houndreth eiris
Quhat mortal changis, and quhat misery?
Quhat nobil men, been brocht upon their heiris,
Traist weill my freindis, follow e mo^ our feiris
So sen in Court been uo tranquillite
Set nocht on it our hole felicite,
The court changis sumtyme with sic outrage,
That few or none, may makin refistence
And spairis not the Prince, more than the page,
As weill apperith be Experience:
The Duke of Rothesay, micht make no defense,
Quhilk was pertenand Roy of this regioun
Bot dulefully deuorit in presoun.
Quhat dreid quhat dolor, had that nobil king
Robert the third, from time he knew the case
Of his two Sonnis dolent departing?
Prince David deid, and James captyne allace,
Till true Scottis me^ quhilk was a cairful case.
Thus may e know, the court been variand,
Quhe^ blude royal, the change may not ganesta^d.
Quho rang in court, more hie and tryumphand,
Nor Duke Murdok, quhil that his day ^ourit?
Was he nocht greit Protector of Scotland?
it of the court, he was nocht weil assurit.
It changit so, his lang service was smurit,
He and his Sone, fair Walter but remeid
Forfaltit war, and put to dulefull deid.
King James the first, the patroun of prudence,
Gem of Ingyne, and perll of policy
Well of Justice, and flude of Eloquence
Quhose vertew doith transcend my fantasy,
For till discryue, it quhen he stude most hie,
Be falls Exorbitant conspiratioun
That prudent Prince, was pieteouslie put down.
Als James the secund, Roy of greit renonn,
Beand in his superexcellent glore
Throuch rakles schuting of ane greit cannoun
The dolent deith, allace did him deuore.
One thing their been, of quhilk I meruell more.
That Fortune had, at him sic mortal feid
Throuch fifty thousand, to wail him be the heid.
My heart is perst with panis for to pance,
Or write that Courtis variatioun
Of James the third, quhen he had governance,
The dolor, dreid, and desolatioun,
The change of Court, and conspiratioun,
And quhow that Cochrane with his company,
That time in Court clam so presumpteouslie.
It had been good, thai bernes had been unborn
Be quhome that nobill Prince was so abusit.
They grew as did the weid abufe the corn,
That prudent Lordis counsall was refusit,
And held him quiet, as he had been inclusit.
Allace that Prince, be their abusioun
Was finally brocht to confusioun.
They clam so hich, and gat sic audience,
And with their Prince, grew so familiar,
His Germane brother, micht get no presence,
The Duke of Albanie, nor the Earl of Mar,
Like baneist men, was haldin at the bar,
Till in the King, their grew sic mortal feid,
He flemit the Duke, and pat the Earl to deid.
Thus Cochrane, with his catyue company
Forsit them to fle, bot it they wantit fedderis
Abuse the hich Cederis of Libanie,
They clam so hie, til they lap ouir their ledderis,
On Lawder brig, syne kaippit were in tedderis,
Stranglit to deith, they gat none other grace,
Their king captive, quhilk was ane cairful case,
Till put in form, that fait Unfortunate,
And mortal change, perturbith mine ingyne.
My wit been waik, my fyngeris fatigate,
To dyte, or write, the rancour and rewyne
The Civil weir, the battle Intestyne,
How that the Sone, with baner braid displayit
Agane the Father, in Battle cum arrayit.
Wald God ye prince had been that day confortit
With Sapience of the prudent Solomon,
And with ye strenth of strange Sampson supportit.
With the bauld Oist of greit Agamemnon.
Quhat should I wis, remedy was their none
At morn ane king, with sceptour swerd and croun.
At ewin, ane deid deformit carioun.
Allace quhare been, that richt redoutit Roy,
That potent prince, gentill king James ye feird
I pray to Christ, his Saul for to convey,
Ane greiter nobill, tang nocht in to the end.
O Atropus, wary we may thy weird
For he was Mirror of humilite
Lode stern, and lamp of liberality.
During his time, so Justice did preuaill,
The Savage Isles, trymblit for terror.
Eskdale, Euisdale, Liddissdaill, and Anuandaill
Durst nocht rebel, douting his dyntis dour,
And of his Lordis, had sic perfyte favor
So for to schaw, that he effe^ it no fene
Out throuch his realm, he wald tide him alone.
And of his court, throuch Europe spra^g ye fame.
Of lusty Lordis, and lufesum Ladyis ing,
Tryumphand tornayis iusting and knichtly game,
With all pastyme, according for ane king.
He was the glore, of Princely governing
Quhilk throuch the ardent lufe he had to France
Agane Ingland, did move his Ordinance.
Of Floddoun field, the rewyne to reuolue,
Or that most dolent day for till deplore,
I nyll for dreid, that dolor ow dissolve,
Schaw how that prince in his tryumpha^d glore
Destroyit was, quhat nedith process more,
Nocht be the vertew of Inglis ordinance,
Bot be his a win wilful misgouernance.
Allace that day, had he been counsalabill
He had obtenit laud, glore, and victory.
Quhose picreous process, been so lamentabill,
I nyll at lenth, it put in memory.
I never red, in Tragedy nor story,
At one Iornay, so money Nobillis slane
For the defense, and lufe of their Souerane.
Now brether mark, in our remembrance,
Ane Mirror of those mutabiliteis.
So may e know, the Courtis inconstance,
Quhen princis been thus pullit from their seis.
After quhose deith, quhat strange aduersiteis,
Quhat greit misrewll, in to this Regioun rang
Quhe^ our ong prince could another spek nor ga^g
During his tender outh, and innocence,
Quhat stouth, quhat reif, quhat murthur and mischa^ce?
Their was not ellis bot wraking of vengeance,
In to that Court their rang sic variance.
Diverse rewlaris, maid diverse ordinance.
Sum time our Qeuene, rang in authority,
Sum time the prudent Duke of Albanie.
Sum time the realm, was reulit be Regentis,
Sum time Lufetenentis, le. daris of the law.
Than rang so money Iobedientis,
That few or none, stude of ane other aw
Oppressioun did so loud his Bugill blaw,
That none durst ride, bot in to feir of weir,
Iok up onland, that time did mys his meir.
Quho was more hich, in honor eleuate,
Nor was Margarete, our hich and michtie princes?
Sic power, was to hic appropriate
Of king, and realm scho was gouernores.
it come one change, within ane schort process,
That perle preclare, that lusty plesand queen,
Lang time durst nocht in to the court be seen.
The Archebischop of sa^cta^dres James Betoun,
Chancellare, and prima ein po^ et Pastoral
Clam nyxt the king, most hich in this regioun,
The ledder schuke, he lap and gat one fall,
Auctorite, nor power spiritual,
Riches, freindschip, micht not that time preuail,
Quhen dame Curia began to steir her taill.
His hich prudence aualit him nocht ane myte,
That time the court bair him sic mortal feid,
As presoneir, they keipt him in despyte,
And sum time wist not, quhare to hyde his heid.
Bot disagysit, like Ihone the raif he eid.
Had nocht been hope bair him sic company,
He had been stranglit, be melancholy.
Quhat cummer and cair, was in the court of france,
Quhen king Francis, was takin presoneir?
The Duke of Burboun, amyd his Ordinance
Deid at ane straik, rycht bailfull brocht on beir?
The court of Rome, that time ran all areir,
Quhe^ Pape Clement, was put in strange presoun
The nobill City, put to confusioun.
In Ingland, quho had greiter governance,
Nor their tryumphand courtly Cardinal,
The commoun weill, sum sayis he did auance
Be Equal Justice, boith to greit and small,
Their was no Prelate, to him peregall.
Inglismen sayis, had he roung langer space,
He had deposit Sanct Peter of his place.
His princely pomp, nor Papale grauite,
His palice royal, rich, and radious,
Nor it the flude of Superfluite
Of his riches, nor travel tedious,
From time dame Curia, held him odious
Aualit him nocht, nor prudence most profound,
The ledder brak, and he fell to the ground.
Quhare been the douchtie Erlis of Douglas
Quhilkis royally, in to this regioun rang?
Forfalt and slane, quhat nedith more process?
The earl of March, was merschellit yaim ama^g,
Dame Curia them dulfullie down thrang.
And now of lait, quho clam more hich amang us
Nor did Archebald vmquyle the Earl of Angus.
Quho with his Prince was more familiar,
Nor of his grace, had more auctorite?
Was he nocht greit Wardane, and Chancellar?
it quhen he stude upon the hichest gre
Traisting no thing, dot perpetuite,
Was suddanlie deposit from his place,
Forfalt and flemit, he gat none other grace.
Quharefor traist nocht in till auctorite
My deir brether I pray ow hartfullie,
Presume uocht in our vane prosperity,
Conform our traist, in God alluterlie,
Sync serve our Prince, with enteir heart trewlie.
And quhen e se the Court, been at the best,
I counsall ow, than draw ow to our rest.
Quhare been, the hich tryu^phant court of Troy?
Or Alexander, with his twelf prudent peiris,
Or Julius, that richt redoutit Roy?
Agamemnon, most worthy in his weiris?
To schaw their fine, my frayit heart affeiris:
Sum murdrest war, sum poysouit preteouslie
Their cairfull courtis dispersit dulefullie.
Traist weill their is no constant court bot one,
Quhare Christ been king, quhose time i^terminabill
And hich triu^phant glore beis never gone.
That quiet court mirthfull and Immutabill,
But variance standith ay ferme and stabill.
Dissimulance, flatirie, nor falls report,
In to that Court, sall never get resort.
Traist weill my freindis, this is no feneit fair,
For quho that been, in the extreme of deid
The verite but dout, they should declair,
Without regard, to favor or to feid,
Quhill e have time, deir brether make remeid,
Adieu for ever, of me e get no more,
Beseikand God, to bring ow to his glore.
Adieu Edinburgh, thou hich tryu^phant town
Within quhose boundis, richt blythful haif I been
Of true Merchandis, the rute of this regioun,
Most reddy to resaue, court, King and Queen,
Thy policy, and Justice, may be seen,
War deuotioun, wisdom, and honest,
And credence tynt, they mycht be found in the,
Adieu fair Snawdoun, with thy touris hie
Thy Chapel royal, Park, and tabill round,

War I one man, to heir the birdis sound,
Quhilk doith agane, thy royal roche redound.

Fair weill Falkland, the Fortres of Fyfe,
Thy polite Park, under the lowmound law,
Sum time in the, I led ane lusty life,
The fallow Deir, to se them raik on raw,
Court men to cum to the, they stand greit aw,
Sayand thy burgh, been of all burrowis vaill,
Because in the, they never gat good aill.
The Commouning betuix the Papingo, And her holy Executouris.
THE Pie persauit the Papingo in pane,
He lichtit down and feneit him to greit.
Sister (said he) alace quho hes ou slane,
I pray ow make prouisioun for our spreit
Dispone our geir, and ow confess compleit,
I have power be our contritioun,
Of all our mys, to give ow full remissioun.

And of my brether Pryour principal.

The blak been of the deith memorial.
Quharefor, I think our ^uddis natural,
Sulde be submittit hole in to my cure.

The Rauin come rolpand, quhe^ he hard the rair,
So did the Gled, with money pieteous pew,
And feneitlie they contrafait greit cair.
Sister (said they) our raklesnes we rue,
Now best it is, our Just counsall ensew,
Sen woe pretend to hich promotioun,
Religious men, of greit deuotioun.
I am ane blak Monk, said the ruttilland rauin,
So said the gled, I am ane holy freir,
And hes power to bring ow quick to heuin,
It is weill knawin, my conscience been full cleir,
The blak Bybill, pronunce I sall perqueir
So till our brether, e will give sum good,
God wat give we haif neid of lives fude.
The Papingo said, father be the rude,
Howbeit our raiment be religious like,
our conscience, I suspect be nocht good,
I did persaue, quhen priuelie e did pyke
Ane chekin from ane hen, under ane dyke
I grant (said he) that hen was my good friend,
And I that chekin tuke, bot for my teind,
e know the faith be us mon be susteind,
So be the Pope, it is preordinate,
That spiritual me^, should leave upon their teind,
Bot weill wat I, e been predestinate
In our extremis to be so fortunate,
To have sic holy consultatioun,
Quharefore, we make ow exhortatioun,
Sen dame Nature hes grantit ow sic grace,
Laiser to make confessioun general,
Schaw forth our syn i^ haist, quhill e haif space
Syne of our geir, make one memorial.
We three sall make our feistis funeral,
And with greit blis, bury we sall our bonis,
Syne Trentalis twenty, trattill all at onis,
The rukkis sall rair, that me^ sall on them rue,
And cry, Commemoratio Animarum.
We sall gar chekinnis cheip, and gaislingis pew
Suppose the geis and hennis, should cry alarm,
And we sall serve, Secundum Vsum Sarum.
And make ow saif, we find sanct Blase to broch,
Cry and for ow, the cairfull corrinoch.
And we sall sing, about our Sepulture,
Sanct Mongois matynis, and the mekle Creid,
And syne deuotelie say, I ow assure,
The auld Placebo bakwart, and the beid,
And we sall weir for ow the murnyng weid,
And thocht our spreit, with Pluto war professed,
Deuotelie sall our Dirige be dressed.
Father (said scho) our facund wordis fair,
Full sore I dreid, be contrair to our deidis.
The wyffis of the village, cryis with cair,
Quhe^ yat persaue ou maw ouirthort their medis.
our falls consait, boith duke and draik sore dredis,
I marvel suithlie, e de nocht eschamit
For our defaltis, being so defamit.
It dois abhor, my pure perturbit spreit
Till make to ow any confessioun.
I heir men say, e been one Hypocreit,
Exemptit from the seen and sessioun.
To put my geir in our possessioun,
That will I nocht, so help me dame Nature,
Nor of my corpse, I will ow give no cure.
Bot had I heir, the nobill Nichtingall,
The gentle Ia, the Merle, and Turtur true.
My Obsequies, and feiftis funeral
Ordour they wald, with notis of the new
The plesand pown, most angellyk of hew,
Wald God I war, this day with him confessed
And my deuyse, dewlie be him addressed,
The mirthfull Maueis, with the gay Goldspink,
The lusty lark, wald God they war present,
My Infortune, forsooth they wald forthink,
And conforte me, that been so Impotent.
The swift Swallow, in practik most prudent,
I wat scho wald, my bleiding stem belyue,
With her most verteous stone restringityue.
Count me the case, under confessioun,
The Gled said, proudly to the Papingo,
And we sall sweir be our professioun
Counsall to keip, and schaw it to no mo.
We the beseik, or thou depart us fro
Declare to us, sum causis resonabill,
Quhy, we been haldin so abhominabill.
Be thy travel, thou hes Experience.
First beand bred, in to the Orient,
Syne be thy good service, and diligence,
To Princis maid, heir in the Occident.
Thou knawis the vulgar pepillis Judgment,
Quhare thou transcurrit the hot Meridional
Syne nixt the Poill, the plaig Septentrionall.
So be thine hich ingyne superlatyue,
Of all countries, thou knawis the qualiteis.
Quharefore, I the conture be God of live,
The verity declare withouttin leis,
Quhat thou hes hard, belandis or be seis,
Of us kirkman, boith good and evil report,
And quhow they Judge, schaw us we the exhort.
Father (said scho) I Catyue Creature,
Dar nocht presume, with sic matter to mell,
Of our cares, e know I have no cure,
Demand them quhilk in prudence doith precell,
I may nocht pew, my panes been so fell.
And als perchance, e will nocht stand content,
To know, the vulgar pepillis Judgment
it will the deith, alyte withdraw his dart,
All they lyis in my memorial
I sall declare, with true vnfeneit heart.
And first I say, to ow in general,
The commoun people sayith, e been all
Degenerit from our holy Primityuis,
As testifyis the process of our lyuis.
Of our peirles prudent predecessouris,
The beginning, I grant was verray good.
Apostolis, Martyris, Virginis, Confessouris,
The sound of their excellent Sanctitude
Was hard over all the world be land and flude,
Planting the faith, be Predicatioun.
As Christ had maid to them Narratioun,
To fortify the faith they tuke no feir,
Before Princis, precheing full prudentlie,
Of dolorous deith, they doutit nocht the deir,
The verity declaring fervently,
And Martyrdom they sufferit pacientlie.
They tuke no cure of land, riches nor rent,
Doctrine and deid, war boith equivalent.
To schaw at lenth, their workis were greit wounder,
Their myracklis, they were so manifest.
In name of Christ, they haillit money hounder,
Rasing the deid, and purging the possessed
With peruerst spreitis, quhilkes had been oppressed
The crukit ran, the blind men gat their Ene.
The deif men hard, the lipper war maid clean.
The Prelatis spousit were, with pouerte,
Those dayis, quhen so they flurischit in fame,
And with her, generit Lady Chaistite.
And dame Deuotioun, notable of Name.
Humill they war, simple, and full of schame.
Thus Chaistite, and dame Deuotioun
War principal cause, of their promotioun.
Thus they contynewit, in this life deuyne,
Ay till their rang, in Romes greit Ciete,
Ane potent Prince, was namit Constantyne,
Persauit the Kirk, had spousit pouerte,
With good intent, and mouit of piete,
Cause of Divorce, he fand betuix them two,
And partit them, withouttin wordis mo.
Syne schortlie with ane greit solemynite,
Withouttin any Despensatioun,
The kirk he spousit, with dame Properte,
Quhilk haistelie be proclamatioun,
To pouerte gart make Narratioun,
Under the pane of persing her ene,
That with the kirk, scho should no more be seen.
Sanct Siluester, that time rang Pope in Rome
Quhilk first consent to the Marriage
Of properte, the quhilk began to blome
Taking on her, the cure with hich curage.
Deuotioun drew her till one Heremitage,
Quhen scho considerit lady Properte
So hich exaltit in to Dignite.
O Syluester, quhare was thy discretioun,
Quhilk Peter did renunce, thou did resaue?
Androw, and Ihone, did leif their possessioun,
Their schippis, and nettis, lynis, and all the iaue,
Of te^porall substance, no thing wald they have,
Contrarious to their contemplatioun
Bot soberlie their sustentatioun.
Ihone the Baptist, went to the wilderness,
Lazarus, Martha, and marie Magdalane
Left veritage, and gudis more and les.
Prudent sanct Paul, thocht properte profane,
From town, to town, he ran in wynd and rane,
Upon his feit, teching the word of grace,
And never was subiectit to riches.
The gled said, it I heir no thing bot good,
Proceid schortlie, and thy matter auance.
The Papyngo said, father be the rude,
It were to lang, to schaw the circumstance,
Quhow properte, with her new alliance,
Grew greit with child, as true men to me tald,
And bure two dochteris gudlie to behald,
The eldest douchter, named was riches,
The secund Sister, Sensualite,
Quhilkes did incres, within one schort process,
Preplesand to the Spiritualite,
In greit substance, and excellent bewte.
Their Ladyis two, grew so within few eris,
That in the world, war no^ micht be their peris.
This royal Riches, and Lady Sensual,
From that time forth, tuke hole the governance
Of the most part, of the stait spiritual.
And they agane, with humill observance,
Amorouslie their wittis did auance,
As true luffaris, their Ladyis for to pleis,
God wat give than, their hartis war at Eis.
Sone they foret, to study pray and preiche,
They grew so subject, to dame Sensual,
And thocht bot pane, pure people for to teiche,
it they decretit, in their greit counsall,
They wald no more, to Marriage be thrall,
Traisting surely, till observe Chaistite,
And all begylit, quod Sensualite.
Apperandlie, they did expel their Wyffis,
That they mycht leif at large, without thirlage,
At liberty to leid their lusty lyffis,
Thinkand men thrall, that been in marriage
For new faicis, prouokis new curage.
Thus Chaistite they turn in to delight,
Wantyng of Wyffis, been cause of appetyte,
Dame Chaistite did steill away for schame
From time scho did persaue their prouiance,
Dame Sensual, one letter gart proclaim
And her exylit Italy, and France.
In Ingland, couth scho get none Ordinance
Than to the King, and Court of Scotland
Scho markit her, withouttin more demand.
Traisting in to that court to get confort.
Scho maid her humill supplicatioun.
Schortlie they said, scho should get na support,
Bot bostit her with blasphematioun,
To Preistis go make our protestatioun.
It is said they, money one houndreth eir
Sen Chaistite, had any entres heir.
Tyrit for travel, scho to the preistis past,
And to the rewlaris of Religioun.
Of her presence, schortlie they war aghast,
Sayand they thocht, it bot abusioun
Her to resaue, so with conclusioun,
With one auyce, decretit and gave dome,
They wald resset no Rebel out of Rome.
Should we resaue, that Romany hes refusit
And banist Ingland, Italy, and France,
For our flattrie, than were we weill abusit
Pas hyne said they and fast our way auance,
Amang the Nonnis, go seik our ordinance,
For we have maid aith of fidelite
To dame Riches, and Sensualite.
Than pacientlie, scho maid progressioun,
Toward the Nonnis, with heart siching full so^e.
They gave her presence, with processioun,
Resauand her, with honor, laud, and glore,
Purposing, to preserve her ever more.
Of that nouellis come to dame Properte,
To Riches, and to Sensualite.
Quhilkis sped them at the post richt spedilie,
And set ane sege, proudly about the place.
The silly Nonnis, did eild them haistelie,
And humillie of that gilt askit grace,
Syne gave their bandis of perpetual pace.
Resauand them, they kest up wykketes wide,
Than Chaistite, their no langer wald abide.
So for refuge, fast to the freiris scho fled,
Quhilkis said, they wald of ladyis tak no cure.
Quhar been scho now, than said the gredie gled?
Nocht amang ow, said scho I ow assure.
I traist scho been, upon the borrow mure,
Besouth Edinbugh, and that richt money menis
Prof estamang the Sisteris of the Senis.
Their hes scho fund her mother Pouerte,
And Deuotioun, her a win sister carnal.
Their hes scho fund, faith, hope and cherite,
Togidder with the virtues Cardinal.
Their hes scho fund, ane Convent it vnthrall
To dame Sensual, nor with riches abusit.
So quietly, those ladyis been Inclusit.
The Pyot said, I dreid be they assaileit,
They rander them, as did the holy Nonnis.
Dout nocht (said scho) for they been so artaileit,
They purpose to defend them with their gunnis,
Reddy to schute, they have sex greit Cannonnis,
Perseverance, Constance, and Conscience,
Austerite, Laubour, and Abstinence.
To resist subtell Sensualite,
Strongly they been, enarmit feit and handis,
Be abstinence, and keipit pouerte,
Contrair riches, and all her falls seruandis.
They have ane Bumbard, braissit up in bandis,
To keip their port, in iniddis of their clois,
Quhilk is callit, Domine custodi nos.
Within quhose schot their dar no Enemeis
Approach their place, for dreid of dyntis dour,
Boich nicht and day, they wirk like besie beis,
For their defense, reddie to stand in stour,
And hes sic watchis, on their utter tour,
That dame Sensual, with seige dar not assail
Nor cum within, the schot of their artaile.
The Pyot said, quhareto sulde they presume.
For to resyste, sweit Sensualite,
Or dame riches, quhilkes reularis been in Rome,
Ar they more constant, in their qualite,
Nor the princis of Spiritualite,
Quhilkis plesandlie withouttin obstaikle
Haith them resauit, in their habitakle.
Quhow lang traist e, those ladyis sall remane
So solytar, in sic perfectioun?
The Papingo said, brother in certane
So lang as they obey correctioun,
Cheising their heidis be electioun,
Vnthrall to riches, or to pouerte,
Bot as requyrith their necessite.
O prudent prelatis, quhare was our prescience,
That tuke on hand, till observe Chastity,
But austeir life, laubour, and abstinence?
(...) e nocht, the greit prosperity
App^^ndlie, to cum of properte.
e know greit cheir, greit eis and Idilnes,
To Lechery, was mother and maisties.
Thou rauis vnrockit, the rauin said be the rude
So to reprove, riches, or properte.
Abraham, and Isaac, war rich and very good
Jacob, and Joseph, had prosperity.
The Papingo said, that is verite.
Riches I grant, is nocht to be refusit,
Providing alwayis, that it be nocht abusit.
Than said the Rauin, one replicatioun,
Syne said thy reason is nocht worth ane myte.
As I sall preue, with protestatioun
That no man tak, my wordis in despyte,
I say, the temporal Princis hes the wy^e
That in the kirk, sic Pastouris dois provide,
To govern saulis, you not them selfis can gyde.
Lang time after the kirk tuke properte
The Prelatis leuit in greit perfectioun,
Vnthrall to riches, or Sensualite
Under the holy Spreitis protectioun,
Orderly chosin be electioun.
As Gregore, Jerome, Ambrose, and Augustyne,
Benedict, Bernard, Clement, Cleit, and Line.
Sic pacient Prelatis, enterit be the port
Plesand the people be predicatioun.
Now dyke lowparis, dois in the kirk resort
Be Symonie, and supplicatioun
Of Princis be their presentatioun.
So silly Saulis, that been Christis scheip
Ar geuin to hungry gormand wolfis to keip.
No marvel is, thocht we Religious men
Degenerit be, and in our life confusit.
Bot sing, and drink, none other craft we ken,
Our spiritual Fatheris, hes us so abusit
Agane our will, those trukouris been intrusit.
Lawit men hes now, religious men in curis
Professed Virginis, in keiping of strong huris.
Princis, princis quhair been our hich prudens,
In dispositioun of our Beneficeis?
The guerdonyng of our Courticiens,
Is sum cause of their greit Enormiteis,
Their is one sort, waitand like hungry fleis.
For spiritual cure, thocht they be no thing abill,
Quhose gredie thristis been Insatiabill.
Princis, I pray ow be no more abusit,
To verteous men having so small regard?
Quhy sulde vertew, throuch flattery be refusit
That men for couunyng, can get no reward?
Allace that ever one bragger, or ane baird,
Ane hure master, or commoun hasarture,
Should in the kirk, get any kind of cure.
War I one man, worthy to weir ane croun,
Ay quhen their vaikit any beneficeis,
I should gar call, ane Congregatioun
The principal, of all the Prelaceis,
Most cunnyng Clerkis of Vniuersiteis,
Most famous Fatheris of religioun,
With their advise make dispositioun.
I sulde dispone, all offices Pastorallis,
Till Doctors of Divinity, or Iure.
And cause dame Vertew, pull up all her saillis,
Quhen cunnyng men had in the kirk most cure.
Gar Lordis send their Sonnis I ow assure
To seik science, and famous sculis frequent
Syne them promoue, that war most sapient.
Greit plesour war to heir ane Bischop preiche,
One Dane, or Doctor in Divinity,
One Abhor, quhilk could weil his Co^uent teiche,
One Persoun, flowing in Philosophy.
I tyne my time, to wis quhilk wy^l nocht be.
War not the preicheing, of the begging freiris,
Tynt war the faith amang the Seculeris.
As for their precheing, quod the Papingo
I them excuse, for quhy, they been so thrall
To properte, and her ding Dochteris two,
Dame Riches, and fair lady Sensual,
They may nocht use no pastyme spiritual.
And in their habitis, they tak sic delight,
They have renuncit russet, and roploch quhyte
Cleikand to them skarlot, and Cramosie,
With Meneuer, martrik, Grice, and rich armyne
Their law hartis, exalti^ ar so hie
To se their Papale pomp it is ane pyne.
More rich array is now with freneis fine,
Upon the barding of ane Bischopis Mule,
Nor ever had Paul or Peter agane ule.
Syne fair ladyis, their Chene may not eschaip,
Dame Sensual so, sic seid hes in them sawin.
Les skaith it war with license of the Paip,
That ilk Prelate one Wife had of his awin,
Nor se their bastardes ouirthort ye cuntre blawin.
For now be they, be weil cu^min from the sculis,
They fall to work, as they war commoun bullis.
PEw quod the gled, thou preichis all in vane.
e Secular folkis, hes of our case no curis.
I grant said scho, it men will speik agane,
Quhow e haif maid a hundredth thousand huris
Quhilkes never had been, war not our lecherus luris
And give I lee, hartlie I me repent,
Was never Bird I wat more penitent.
Than scho her sch^aue with deuote countenance,
To that falls gled, quhilk feneit him one freir.
And quhen scho had fulfyllit her penance
Full subtellie at her he began inqueir:
Cheis ow (said he) quhilk of us brether heir
Sall have of all our natural geir the curis,
e know none been, more holy creaturis.
I am content (quod the pure Papingo)
That e freir Gled, and corbie monk our brother
Have cure of all my gudis, and no mo.
Sen at this time, freindschip I find none other.
We salbe to ow true as till our Mother
(Quod they) and sweir till fulfill her intent.
Of that (said scho) I tak ane Instrument.
The Pyot said, quhat sall mine office be?
Ouerman said scho, unto the other two,
The rowpand Rauin, said sweit sister lat se
our holy intent for it is time to go.
The gredie gled said, brother do nocht so
We will remane, and haldin up her heid,
And never depart from her, till scho be deid.
The Papingo, them thankit tenderly,
And said, sen e have taken on ow this cure,
Depart mine natural gudis equally,
That ever I had, or hes of dame Nature.
First to the Howlet, Indigent and pure
Quhilk on the day for schame dar nocht be seen,
Till her I leif, my gay galbert of grene.
My bricht depurit Ene, as crystal cleir,
On to the Bak, e sall them boith present.
In Phoebus preseuce, quhilk dar nocht appeir.
Of natural sicht, scho been so Impotent,
My birneist beik, I leif with good intent
Onto to the gentill, pieteous Pellicane,
To help to pers, her tender heart in twane.
I leif the Goik, quhilk hes no sang bot one,
My music, with my voce Angelical.
And to the Guse, e give quhen I am gone,
My Eloquence, anb tongue Rethori^a^^.
And tak and dry, my bonis greit and small
Syne clois them in one cais of Ebure fine,
And them present, unto the Phoenix syne.
To birne with her, quhen scho her life renewis,
In Arabie, e sall her find but weir,
And sall know her, be her most heavenly hewis,
Gold, Asure, Gowles, Purpour, and Synopeie,
Her dait is for to leif five houndreth eir.
Make to that bird my commendatioun.
And als I make ow supplicatioun,
Sen of my corpse, I have ow geuin the cure.
e speid ow to the court but tarying,
And tak my heart of perfyte portrature,
And it present unto my Souerane King.
I wat he will it clois it to one ring,
Commend me to his grace, I ow exhort,
And of my passioun make him true report.
e three my tryppis sall have for our travel,
With luffer and lowng, to part equal ama^g ow
Pray and Pluto, the potent prince of hell
Give e fail, that in his feit he fang ow,
Be to me true, thocht I no thing belang ow,
Sore I suspect, our conscience be to large.
Dout nocht said they, we tak it with the charge.
Adieu brether, quod the pure Papingo,
To talkin more, I have no time to tarry.
Bot sen my spreit, mon fra my body go,
I recommend it to the queen of Farie
Eternally, in till her court to tarry
In wyldernes, among the holtis hoar.
Than scho inclynit her heid, and spak no more.
Plungit in till her mortal passioun,
Full greuouslie, scho grippit to the ground.
It war to lang to make narratioun
Of sichis sore, with money stang and stound,
Out of her wound, the blude did so abound,
One coumpas round, was with her blude maid reid
Without remeid, their was no thing bot deid.
And be scho had, In Mauus tuas said,
Extinctit were her natural wittis five.
Her heid full softly on her schulder laid
Syne eild the spreit, with panis pungityue.
The Rauin began, rudely to rug and ryue,
Full gormoundlyke, his empty throt to feid,
Eit softly brother said the gredie gled.
Quhil scho is hot, depart her ewin amang us.
Tak thou one half, and reik to me ane other,
In till our richt, I wat no wicht dar wrang us,
The Pyot said, the feind resaue the fother,
Quhy make e me stepbarne, and I our brother?
e do me wrang schir gled, I schrew our heart
Tak their (said he) the puddingis for thy part.
Than wit e weill, my heart was wounder sair
For to behald, that dolent departing.
Her Angel fedderis, fleing in the air,
Except the heart, was left of her no thing.
The Pyot said, this pertenith to the king.
Quhilk till his grace, I purpose to present,
Thou (quod the gled) sall faill of thine intent.
The Rauin said, God nor I rax in ane raip.
And thou get this, till other King or Duke.
The Pyote said, plene I nocht to the Pape
Than in ane smedie, I be smorit with smuke,
With that the Gled, the piece claucht in his cluke,
And fled his way, the laue with all their micht
To chase the gled, flew all out of my sicht.
Now have e hard, this little Tragedy.
The sore complaynt, the testament and mischance
Of this pure Bird, quhilk did ascend so hie.
Beseikand ow, excuse mine Ignorance,
And rude indyte, quhilk is nocht till auance.
And to the quair, I give commandment
Make no repair, quhare Poetis been present.
Because thou been, but Rethorike so rude,
Be never seen, beside none other buke,
With King nor Queen, with Lord nor man of good
With coit unclean, clame kintent to sum cuke.
Steill in ane nuke, quhen they list on the luke.
For smell of smuke, men will abhor to beir the.
Heir I manesweir the, quharefor to lurk go leir the.

Bot humilie I beseik thine Excellence.
With ornate terms, thocht I can nocht expres
This sempyll matter, for laik of Eloquence,

With heart and hand my mind I sall addres,
As I best can, and most compendious.
Now I begin, the matter hapnit thus.
THE PROLOG.
IN the Calendis of January,
Quhen fresche Phoebus be mouyng circulai^
From Capricorn, was enterit in Aquarie,
With blastis that the branchis maid full bair.
The snaw, and sleit, pertubit all the air,
And flemit Flora, from every bank and bus
Throuch support of the austeir Eolus.
After that I the lang wynteris nicht.
Had line walking, in my bed allone,
Throuch heavy thocht, that no way sleip I micht,
Remembryng of diverse thyngis goue.
So up I rose, and cleithit me anon.
Be this fair Titan, with his lemis licht
Over all the land, had spread his baner bricht.
With clok and hude, I dressit me belyue
With dowbyl schone, and myttanis on my handis,
Howbeit the air, was rycht penettraryue,
it fure I forth, lansing ouirthort the landis,
Towart the sea, to schort me on the sandis
Because vnblomit was both bank and bray.
And so as I was passing be the way,
I met dame Flora, in dule weid dissagysit.
Quhilk in to May, was dulce and delectabill
With stalwart stormis, her sweitnes was supprisit
Her heavenly hewis, war turait in to sabill,
Quhilkes vinquhyle war to Luffaris amiabill,
Fled from the frost, the tender flouris I saw,
Under dame Naturis mantill lurking law.
The small fowlis, in flokkis saw I fle,
To Nature makand greit lamentatioun.
They lychtit down, beside me on ane tree,
Of their complaynt, I had compassioun,
And with ane pieteous exclamatioun,
They said blissit be Somer, with his flouris,
And waryit be thou winter, with thy schouris.
Allace Aurora, the syllie Lark can cry,
Quhare hes thou left, thy balmy liquour sweit
That us reiosit, we mounting in the sky?
Thy silver droppis, ar turnit in to sleir.
O fair Phoebus, quhare is thy holsum hei^^
Quhy tholis thou, thy heavenly pleland face
With mystie vapors to be obscurit allace?
Quhar art thou May, with June, thy sister schene,
Weill bordourit with dasyis of delight?
And gentill Iulie, with thy mantill grene
Enamilit with Rosis, reid and quhyte?
Now auld and cauld Ianuar in despyte,
Reiffis from us, all pastyme and pleasure.
Allace quhat gentil heart may this Endure?
Ouersylit ar with cloudis odious
The goldin skyis of the Orient.
Cha^ging in sorrow, our sang melodious,
Quhilk we had wount to sing with good intent,
Resoundand to the heuinnis firmament.
Bot now our day, is changit in to nicht
With that they raise, and flew forth of my sicht.
Pensive in heart, passing full soberly
Unto the sea, fordwart I fure anon.
The sea was forth, the sand was smoith and dry
Than up and down, I musit mine alone
Till that I spyit, ane little Cave of stone
Hich in ane craig, vpwart I did approach
But carrying and clam up in the Roche.
And purposit, for passing of the time,
Me to defend from Ociosite,
With pen and paper to Register in ryme
Sum merry matter of Antiquite.
Bot Idelnes, ground of iniquite
Scho maid so dull my spreitis me within,
That I wist nocht, at quhat end to begin.
Bot sal still in that coue, quhare I mycht se
The weltering of the wallis up and down,
And this false warldis Instabilite
Unto that se, makand comparisoun,
And of this warldis wrechit variatioun
To them that fixis, all their hole intent
Considering quho most had, should most repent.
So with my hude, my heid I happit warm,
And in my cloak, I fauldit beit^ my feir.
I thocht my corpse, with cauld should tak no harm
My mittanis held my handis weill in heit.
The skowland craig, me couerit from the sleit.
Their still I sat, my bonis for to rest
Till Morpheus with sleip my spreit oppressed.
So throw the bousteous blastis of Eolus,
And throw my walking, on the nicht before,
And throuch the seyis mouyng marvelous
Be Neptunus, with money rout and rore.
Constraynit I was to sleip withouttin more.
And quhat I dremit in conclusioun,
I sall ow tell ane meruellous visioun,
THE DREME OF SCHIR DAVID LYNDESAY.
ME thocht ane lady of portratour perfyte
Did salus me, with benyng countenance,
And I quhilk of her presens had delight
Till her agane maid humyll reverence,
And her demandit, saving her plesance,
Quhat was her name? scho answerit courtesly,
Dame Remembrance (scho said) callit am I.
Quhilk cummin is for pastyme and plesour
Of the, and for to beir the company,
Because I se thy spreit without mesour
So sore perturbit be melancholy,
Causing thy corpse, to vaxin cauld and dry.
Tharefor get up, and gang anon with me.
So war we boith, in twinkling of ane Ee,
Down throw the eird, in middis of the Center,
Or ever I wist, in to the lawest hell,
In to that cairfull Coue, quhen we did enter
owting and owling, we hard with money ell.
In flam of fire, rycht furious and fell
Was cry and money cairfull Creature
Blasphemand God, and warland Nature.
Their saw we diverse Paipis and Empriouris,
Without recover money cairfull kingis.
Their saw we money wrangous Co^querouris,
Withouttin richt, reiffaris of vtheris ringis,
The men of kirk, lay boundin in to bingis,
Their saw we money cairfull Cardinal,
And Archebischopis in their pontifical.
Proud and peruerst Prelattes, out of nummer,
Priouris, Abbottis, and falls flatterand freiris.
To specify them all, it were ane cummer,
Regulare cha^nonis, churl monks, and chartereris,
Curious Clerkis, and preistis seculeris.
Their was sum part, of ilk Religioun
In haiy kirk, quhilk did abusioun.
Than I demand it dame Remembrance,
The cause of their Prelattis punitioun.
Scho said the cause, of their unhappy chance.
Was Couetyce, Lust, and ambteioun,
The quhilk now garris them want fruitioun
Of God, and heir eternally man dwell
In to this painful poysonit pit of hell.
Als they did nocht instruct the Ignorent.
Prouocand them to penitence be preiching,
Bot seruit warldlie Princis insolent,
And war promouit, be their fenen fleiching.
Nocht for their science, wisdom nor teicheing.
Be Symonie, was their promotioun,
More for deneiris, nor for deuotioun.
Ane other cause of the punitioun,
Of their unhappy prelattis Imprudent,
They maid nocht equale distributioun
Of haly kickis Patrimony and rent,
Bot temporallie, they have it all misspent.
Quhilkis should have been trypartit in to three,
First to vphauld the kick in honest.
The secund part, to sustene their estaitis.
The third part, to be geuin to the puris.
Bot they dispone that geir all other gaitis,
On cartis, and dyce, an harlotrie, and huris.
Their caryuis tuke no count of their a win curi^
Their kirkis reuin, their l^oris clenely cled
And richly rewlit ^oi^^ at bu^^ and bed.
Their bastard barnis, proudely they prouydit.
The kirk geir largely, they did on tha^^^ spend
In their defaltis, their sub^^tis we misgydit,
And comptit nocht their God, for till offend,
Quhilk gart thaim want grace at t^^^r letter end
Rewland that rout I saw to Ca^p^s of Bras,
Simon Magus, and Bischop Cayphas.
Bischop Annas, and the tratour Judas,
Machomete, that Propheit poysonabill,
Chore Dathan, and A^iron their was,
Heretykis we saw vnnume^abill.
It was ane sicht, richt wounderous ^amin^abill
Quhow that they lay, in to they (...) Neiting,
With cairfull cryis, grening and greiting.
Religious men were punischit pa^efullit,
For vain glory als for Inobedience,
Brekand their constitutionis wylfullie
Nocht hauand their Ouermen in reverence,
To know their rewll they maid no diligence,
Vnleifsumlie, they vsit properte,
Passing the boundis of wilful pouerte.
Full sore weping, with vocis lament^bill,
They cryit lawd, O Empriour Constantyne
We may wit thy possessioun personabill
Of all our greit pame^^^ (...).
Quhow ^^t thy purpose was, till ane ^udefyne,
Th^w baneift from us, (...) deuotioun,
Haiffand sic Ee till our promo^ioun.
Than we beheld ane den full dolorous,
Quhare that Princis and Lordis temporal
War Cruciate with panis rigorous.
Bot to expreme their panis in special.
It dois exceid all my memorial.
Importabill pane they had but conforting.
Their blude royal, maid them no supporting.
Sum catyue kingis, for cruel oppressioun.
And other sum, for their wrangous conquest
War condampnit, they and their Successioun,
Sum for publict adultery, and incest.
Sum leit their people never leif in rest,
Delyting so in plesour sensual,
Quhare for their pane, was their perpetual
Their was the cursit Empriour Nero,
Of euerilk vice the horribill veschell.
Their was Pharao, with diverse Princis mo,
Oppressouris of the barnis of Israel.
Herod, and money mo, than I can tell.
Ponce Pylat was their hangit be the hals,
With unjust Iugis, for their sentence falls.
Dukis, Marquessis, Erlis, Barronis, knichtis,
With they Princis, were punist panefully.
Participant they were of their vnrichtis.
Fordwart we went, and leit their Lordis ly,
And saw quhare Ladyis lamentabilly,
Like wod Lyonis were cairfullie cryand,
In flam of fire, richt furiously fryand.
Emprices, Quenis, and ladyis of honouris,
Money Duches, and Comptes, full of cair.
They persit mine heart, they tender Creaturis
So pynit in that pit full of despair
Plungit in pane, with money reuthfull rair.
Sum for their pride, sum for Adultery,
Sum for their tyisting men to Lechery,
Sum had been cruel and malicious,
Sum for making of wrangous heritouris.
For to rehers their lyffis vicious
It were bot tarry to the auditouris,
Of Letherie, they were the verray ^uris
With their prouocatyue Impudictte
Brocht money ane man to Infelicite.
Sum women for their pusillanimite Quhat ho^ribill torment of conscience was
this anticulate co^fessioun.

Ouerset with schame, they did them never schryue
Of secreit Synnis, done in quiet
And sum repentit never in their live.
Quharefor but reuth thai ruffeis did yaim ryue
Rigorously without compassioun,
Greit was their dule, and lamentatioun.
That we were maid, they cryit often allace,
Thus Tormentit with panis Intollerabill
We mendit nocht, quhe^ we had time and space,
Bot tuke in ei^d our lustis delectabill.
Quharefor with feindis ugly and hortibill
We are condampnit, for ever more allace,
Eternally, withouttin hope of grace.
Quhare is the meit, and drink delicious,
With quhilk we fed, our cairfull carionis?
Gold, silver, sylk, with perlis precious,
Our riches, rentis and our possessionis?
Withouttin hope of our remissionis,
Allace our panis ar Insufferabill,
And our tormentis to count Innumerabill.
Than we beheld, quhare money ane thousand.
Commoun people lay flichterand in the fire,
Of euerilk stait, their was ane bailfull band.
Their mycht be seen, money sorrowful Sire.
Sum for Inuy sufferit, and sum for Ire,
And sum for laik of restitutioun,
Of wrangous geir without remissioun.
Manesworne m^chandes, for yair wrangous winning,
Hurdaris of gold, and co^moun Okkararis
Falls men of Law, in Cautelis rycht cunning,
Theiffis, reuaris, and publict oppressaris.
Sum part their was of vnleill Lauboraris
Craftismen their saw we out of nummer,
Of ilk stait to declair, it were ane cummer.
And als langsum to me, for till Indyte,
Of this presoun, the pams in special.
The heir, the cauld, the dolor and dispyte,
Quharefor I speik of them in general,
That dully den, that furneis Infernal,
Quhose reward is, rue without remeid,
Ever deand, and never to be deid,
Hounger and thrist, in steid of meit and drink.
And for thace clethyng, ta^dis and Scorpionis.
That mirk Mansioun, is tapessit with stink
They se na thing, bot horribill visionis
They heir bot scorn, and derisionis
Of foul feindis, and blasphemationis.
Their feilling is Importabill passionis.
For melody, miserable murning.
Their is na solace, bet dolor Infinyte
In bailfull beddis, bitterly burning.
With sobbing, siching, sorrow and with syte
Their conscience, their hattis so did byte,
To heir them flyte, it was ane case of cair,
So in dispyte plungit in to despair.
A little above, that dolorous doungeoun. He semis earn^^^ ^^clude tha^ allo^^
Purgatory.

We enterit in, ane country full of cait.
Quhate that we saw, money ane legioun
Grerand and gowland, with money re^^^full rair.
Quhat place is this (quod I) of blis so bait,
Scho answerit (and said) Purgatory
Quhilk purgis Saulis, or they cum to glory.
I se no plesour heir bot mekle pain.
Quharefor (said I) leif we this sort in thrall.
I purpose never, to cum beie again.
Bot it I do believe, and ever sall
That the true kirk, can no way err at all,
Sic thing to be, greit Clerkis dois conclude.
Quhoweit my hope, sta^dis most in Christis blud.
Abufe that, in the third presoun anon.
We enterit in ane place of perditioun,
Quhare money babbis war makand drery moan,
Because they wantit the fruitioun
^ic was ye ignorance of yaida^is, ye me^ ewin of scharpest iugeme^r, culd not
espy all abusis.
Of God, quhilk was ane greit punitioun
Of Baptism, they wantit the Ansene.
Up wart we went, and left that mirthles mean.
In till ane Volt, above that place of pane.
Unto the quhilk, but sudgeorne we ascendit,
That was the Lymb, in the quhilk did remane
Our forefatheris, because Adam offendit
Eiland the fruct, the quhilk was defendit
Money ane eir, they dwelt in that Doungeoun
In mirknes, and in delolatioun.
Than throuch the earth, of nature cauld and dry.
Glaid to eschaip, those places perrilous,
We haistit us, rycht wounder spedily.
it we beheld, the Secretis marvelous
The Mynis of gold, and stonis precious
Of silver, and of euerilk fine mettell,
Quhilk to declare, it were over lang to dwell.
Up throuch the watter, schortlie we Intendi^
Quhilk enuironis the earth, withouttin dout.
Syne throw the air, schortlie we ascendit,
His Regionis throuch, behalding in and out
Quhilk earth, and watter, closis round about.
Syne schortlie vpwart, throw the fire we went,
Quhilk was the hiest, and hotest Element.
Quhen we had all, their Elementis over pas^.
That is to say, earth, watter, air, and fire,
Up wart we went, withouttin any rest
To se the Heuinnis, was out may desire.
Bot or we mycht wyn, to the heuin Empire
It behuffit us to pas, the way full ewin,
Up throuch the spheiris, of the Planeris sewin.
First to the Moon, and vesyit all her spheir.
Queen of the sea, and beauty of the nycht,
Of nature wak, and cauld, and no thing cleir,
For of her self, scho hes none other lycht
Bot the reflex, of Phoebus bemis brycht.
The twelf signis, scho passis round about,
In aucht and twenty days withouttin dout.
Than we ascendit to Mercurious.
Quhilk Poetis callis god of Eloquence,
Rycht Doctourlyke, with terms delicious,
In art expert, and full of Sapience.
It was plesour to pans on his prudence.
Payntouris, Poeitis ar subject to his cure,
And hot, and dry, he is of his Nature.
And als as cunning Astrologis sayis,
He dois compleit his course Naturally,
In three houndreth, and aucht and thretty dayis.
Syne vpwart we ascendit haistelie
To fair Venus, quhare scho richt lustily,
Was set in to ane sait, of silver schene,
That fresche Gods, that lusty luffis queen.
Thy persit mine heart, her blenkis amorous
Quhowbeit that sumtyme scho is chengeable,
With countenance and cheir full dolorous
Quhylu^mis richt plesand, glaid and delectable,
Sumtyme constant, and sumtyme variable.
it her beauty, resplendent as the fire,
Swagis the wraith of Mars, that god of Ire.
This plesand Planeit, give I can richt discriue,
Scho is both hot, and wak, of her nature
That is the cause, scho is prouocatiue
Till all them that are subiectit to her cure,
To Venus werkis, till that they may endure.
Als scho completis, her coursis natural,
In twelf Monethis, withouttin any fall.
Than past we to the spheir of Phoebus bricht,
That lusty lamp, and lantern of the heuin,
And glaider of the sterris with his licht
And principal of all the planeitis sewin,
And sat in myddis of them all full ewin,
As Roy royal, rolling in his spheir,
Full plesandlie in to his goldin Chair.
Quhose Influence and vertew excellent,
Geuis the life till euerilk erthlie thing.
That Prince of euerilk planeit precellent
Dois foster flouris, and garris herbis spring,
Throuch the cauld eirth, and causis birdis sing.
And als his regular mouyng in the heuin.
Is Just under the Zodiac full ewin.
For to discryue his Diadem Royal,
Bordourit about with stonis schyning bricht
His goldin Cart, or throne Imperial,
The four stedis, that drawis it full richt
I leif to Poeitis, because I have no slicht.
Bot of his nature he is hot and dry,
Compleitand in ane eir, his course trewly.
Than up to Mars, in by we haistit us,
Wounder hot, and dryer than the tounder,
His face flam^^and, as sire richt furious,
His host and brag, more aufull than the thounder,
Maid all ye heuin, most like to schaik in schouder
Quha wald behald his countenance and feir,
Mycht cail him weill, the god of men of weir.
With color reid, and luke malicious,
Rycht colerick of his complexioun.
Austeir, angry, sweir, and seditious,
Principal cause of the destructioun
Of money good and ^obill Regioun.
War nocht Venus, his Ire dois mitigate,
This world of piece wald be full desolate.
This god of grief withouttin sudgeorning
In eris two, his course he doith compleit,
Than past we up, quhar Iuppiter the king
Sat in his spheir, richt amiabill and sweit,
Complexionat with waknes, and with heit.
That plesand Prince, tair, dulce, and delicate
Prouokis piece, and banissis debait.
The auld Poeitis, be superstitioun.
Held Iuppiter, the Father principal
Of all their goddis in conclusioun,
For his prerogatyuis in special
Als be his vertew in to general
To auld Saturn, he makis resistance
Quhen in his malice he wald wirk vengeance.
This Iuppiter withouttin sudgeorning
Passis throw all the twelf planeitis full euin,
In eris twelf, and than but carrying
We past unto the hiest of the seuin,
Till Saturnus, quhilk trublis all the heuin
With heavy cheir, and color paill as leid,
In him we saw bot dolor to the deid.
And cauld, and dry, he is of his nature,
Foul like ane Oule, of evil conditioun.
Rycht vnplesand he is of portrature.
His Intoxicate dispositioun
It puttis all thing to perditioun
Ground of seiknes, and melancholious.
Peruerst and pure, both falls and Inuyous.
His qualite, I can nocht love bot lack,
As for his mouyng naturally but weir,
About the signis of the Zodiac,
He dois compleit his course, in thretty eir.
And so we left him in his frosty spheir,
Up wart we did ascend Incontinent
But ^est, till we come to the Firmament,
The quhilk was fixit full of sterris bricht
Of figour round, richt plesand and perfyte
Quhose influence, and richt excellent licht,
And quhose nummer, may nocht be put in write.
it cunnyng Clerkis, dois naturally indyte,
How that he dois, compleit his course but weir,
In space of seuin and thretty thousand eir.
Than the nynt Spheir, and mouair principal
Of all the laif, we wesy it all that heuin,
Quhose daily motioun is continual,
Both firmament, and all the plancitis seuin,
From eist, to west, garris them full euin
In to the space of four and twenty eris

The seuin Planeitis, in to their proper spheiris,
From west to eist, they move naturally.
Sum swyft, sum slaw, as to their kind effeiris
As I have schawin before specially
Quhose motioun causis continually
Rycht melodious, harmony and sound,
And al throw mouyng of those Planeitis round.
Than moutit we, with richt fervent desire
Vpthrow the heuin, callit Christallyne
And so we enterit in the heuin Empire,
Quhilk to discryue, it passis mine Iagyne.
Quhat God in to his holy throne druyne
Regnis in to his glore Inestimabill
With Angellis citir, quhilkis ar Innumerabill.
In Ordeuris nine, their spreitis glorious
Ar deuydit, the quhilkis excellently
Makis loving, with sound melodious,
Singand Sanctus, tycht wounder fervently,
Their ordeuris nine, they at full plesandlie
Deuydit in to Hierarchies three,
And three Ordouris in euerilk Hierarchy.
The lawest Ordour, is of Angellis bricht,
As Messingeris send to this law Regioun.
The secund ordour, Archangellis full of micht.
Virtues, Potestatis Principatis of renoun.
The sext is callit Dominatioun.
The seuint Thronus, the auchtin Cherubin.
The nynt and hiest, callit Seraphin.
And nixt unto the blissit Trinite,
In his Tryumphant throne Imperial,
Three in till one, and one substance in tire,
Quhose indiuisibill essence eternal,
The rude Ingyne, of mankind is to small
Till comprehend, quhose power Infinyte,
And deuyne nature, no Creature can write.
So mine Ingyne, is nocht sufficient
For to treit, of his hich Divinity.
All mortal men at Insufficient
Till considder they three in unite,
Sic subtell matter I man on neid lat be
To study on my Creid, it wat full fair,
And lat Doctouris of sic hic materis declair.
Than we beheld the blissit Humanite
Of Christ, sittand in to his Sege Royal
At the rycht hand of the Divinity
With ane excelland court Celestial,
Quhose exercitioun continual
Was in loving their Prince, with reverence,
And on this wise they kepit ordinance.
Nixt to the Throne, we saw ye Queen of quenis
Weil cumpanyit, with Ladyis of delight
Sweit was the sang, of those blissit Virginnis,
No mortal man, their solace may indyte.
The Angellis bricht, in nummer infinyte,
G^erilk Ordour in their awin degree
War officiaris unto the deite.
Patriarkis, and Propheitis honorabill,
Coilaterall counsalouris in his consistory,
Euangelistis, Apostolis venerabill
War Capitanis unto the King of Glory,
Quhilk Chi^tanely ^e had win the Victory,
Of that tryumphand Court celestial
Sanct Peter was Lufetenand general.
The Martyris war, as nobyll stalwart Knichtis
Discoafitouris of cruel Battellis three
The flesche, the world, the feind and al his michtis
Confessouris, Doctouris in Divinity
As Chapel Clerkis unto his deite.
And last we saw infinyte multitude
Makand service unto his Celsitude.
Quhilkis be the hie Deuyne permissioun,
Felicite they had Inuariable,
And of his Godheid, cleir cognitioun,
And compleit piece they had Interminable.
Their glore, and honor, was Inseparable.
That plesand place repleit of pulchritude
Unmeasurable it was of magnitude.
Their is plenty of all plesouris perfyte,
Euydent brichtnes, but obscurite.
Withouttin dolor, dulcore, and delight.
Withouttin rancour, perfyte Cherite.
Withouttin hounger, Satiabilite.
O happy ar the Saulis predestinate,
Quhen Saul and body salbe glorificate.
Their marvelous mirthis for to declair,
Be Arithmetik, they at Innumerable.
The portratour of that place preclair,
By Geometry, it is Inmesurable,
By Rethorik als Inpronunciable.
Their is none eiris may heir, nor Eine my se,
Nor heart may thynk this their felicite.
Quhare to sulde I presume for till indyte,
The quhilk Sanct Paul, that Doctor sapient
Can nocht expres nor in to paper write
The hie excellent work Indeficient,
And perfyte plesour ever permanent,
In presence of that mychtie King of glore,
Quhilk was, and is, and sall be ever more.
At Remembrance, humillie I did inquyre
Give I mycht in that plesour still remane.
(Scho said) aganis resoun is thy desire
M^h^refore my friend, thou mon return agane
I^to the world, quhair thou sall suffer pane,
^^d thole the deed with cruel panis sore,
Or thou be digne, to regne with him in glore.
Than we returnit sore aganis my will,
Down throw spheiris of the heuinnis cleir.
Her commandment behustit I fulfill
With sort heart, wit e withouttin weir.
I wald full feign haif taryit their all eir
Bot scho said to me, their is no remeid,
Or thou remane heir, first thou mon be deid.
Quod I, I pray ow hartfullie madame,
Sen we have had sic Contemplatioun
Of heavenly plesouris, it or we pas hame
Let us have sum consideratioun
Of eirth, and of his Situatioun.
Scho answerit and said, that sall be done.
So were we botth, brocht in the air full sone.
Quhare we mycht se the Earth all at one sicht,
Bot like one moit, as it apperit to me,
In the respect of the heuinnis bricht.
I have marvel (quod I) quhow this may be,
The earth semis of so small quantite
The leist stern fixit in the Firmament
Is more than all the earth, be my Judgment.
Scho sayis Sone, thou hes schawin ye verite,
The smallest stern fixit in the firmament,
In deid it is of greiter quantite
Than all the eirth, after the intent
Of wise, and cunning Clerkis sapient.
Quhat quantite is than the eirth (quod I)
That sall I schaw (quod scho) to the schortly.
After the myndis of the Astronomouris,
And specially, the Auctour of the Spheir,
And other diverse greit Philosophouris,
The quantite of the earth Circuleir,
Is fifty thousand liggis, withouttin weir,
Seuin houndreth, and fifty, and no ^^o,
Dividing ay ane lig, in mylis two.
And euerilk mile, in aucht flaidis deuyde.

Ane pais five fute, quha wald than rycht decyde,
Ane fute four palms, give I can rycht descryue,

The diuisioun of the Eirth.
THen certanlie scho tuke me be the hand,
And said my sone cu^ on thy wayis with me
And so scho gart me cleirly understand
How that the earth, tripartit was in three:
In Aphrik, Europe, and Asie.
After the myndis of the Cosmographouris
That is to say, the warldis Descriptouris.
First Asia, contenit is in the Orient,
And is weill more, than both the other twane,
Aphrik, and Europe, in the Occident,
And ar deuydit be ane sey certane,
And that is callit, the sea Mediterrane,
Quhilk at the strait of Marrok hes enter,
That is betuix Spane, and Barbary.
Towart the southwest lyis Aphrica,
And in the northwest, Europa doith stand.
And all the eist, contenis Asia.
On this wise, is deuydit the serme land
It war mekle to me to tak on hand
Their Regionis, to declair in special,
it sall I schaw their Names in general.
In money diverse famous Regionis,
Is deuydit this part Asia.
Weill plenischit, with Citteis, towris, and townis,
The greit Inde, and Mesopotamia,
Penthapolis, Egypt, and Syria,
Cappadocia, Seres, and Armenie,
Babylon, Chaldea, Parth, and Arabie.
Sidon, Judea, and Palestina,
Upper Scithia, Tire, and Galilie,
Hiberia, Bactria, and Philestina,
Hircania, Compagena, and Samarie.
In little Asia, standis Galathie,
Pamphilia, Isauria, and Leid,
Rhegia, Arethusa, Assyria, and Meid.
Secundlie, we considderit Africa,
With money fructfull famous regioun
As Ethiopie, and Tripolitana,
Zewges, quhare standis the triumphant town
Of nobyll Carthage, that Ciete of renoun.
Garamantes, Nadabar, Libia,
Getulia, and Mauritania.
Fezensis, Numidie, and Thingitane,
Of Afric, their ar the principal.
Than Europe, we considderit in certane,
Quhose Regionis, schortlie rehers I sall.
Four principallis, I find above them all
Quhilkes ar Spane, Italy, and France,
Quhose Subregionis, were mekle till auance.
Nether Scithia, Thrace, and Carmanie
Thusia, Distria, and Pannonia
Denmark, Gotland, Grundland, and Almanie,
Pole, Hungary, Boeme, Norica, Rethia,
Trutonia and money diverse ma.
And was in four deuydit Italy
Tuscane, Hethruria, Naplis, and Champanie.
And subdeuydit sindry other wayis,
As Lumbardie, Veneis, and other ma,
Calaber, Romanie, and Genowayis.
In Greece, Epyrus, and Dalmatia,
Thessalie, Attica, and Illyria,
Achaya, Beotia, and Macedone,
Archadie, Pierie, and Lacedemone.
And France we saw deuydit in to three.
Belgica, Celtica, and Aquitane.
And subdeuydit in Flanderis, Picardie,
Normandy, Gascone, Burgune, and Britane,
And vtheris diverse Duchereis in certane,
The quhilkes were to lang for to declair,
Quharefor of them as now I speik na mair.
In Spane, lyis Castillie and Arragone.
Nauarne, Galice, Portugal, and Granate,
Than saw we famous Ilis money one
Quhilkis in the Occeane sey, was situate.
Them to discryue, my wit was desolate.
Of Cosmographie I am nocht expare,
For I did never study in that art.
it I sall sum of their names declare,
As Madagascar, Gades, and Taprobane,
And other diverse Ilis good and fair
Situate in to the scy Mediterrane,
As Cyper, Candie, Corsica, and Sardane.
Crete, Abidos, Thoes Sicilia,
Tapsus, Eolie, and money other ma.
Quho wald at lenth, heir the Descriptioun
Of euerilk I Will, als weill as the ferme land,
And properteis, of euerilk Regioun,
To study and to reid man tak on hand
And the attentike werkis understand
Of Plinius, and worthy Ptholomie,
Quhilaes war expert in to Cosmographie.
Their sall they find, the namis and properteis
Of every I Will, and of ilk Regioun.
Than I inquirit of erthly Paradeis,
Of the quhilk Adam, tynt Possessioun.
Than schew scho me the Situatioun
Of that precelland place of delight,
Quhose properteis were lang for to Indyte.
OF PARADISE.
THis Paradise, of all plesouris reple^^,
Situate I saw in to the Orient.
That glorious gairth of every flouris did fleit
The lusty lillyis, the rosis redole^t
Fresche holesum fructis Indeficient,
Both herb, and tree, their growis ever grene,
Throw vertew of the temperat air serene.
The sweit holesum aromatike odouris,
Proceiding from the herbis Medicinal
The heavenly hewis of the fragrant flouris,
It was ane sicht wounder celestial.
The perfectioun to schaw in special,
And Ioyis of that Regioun deuyne
Of mankind, it exceidis the Ingyne.
And als so hie in Situatioun,
Surmounting the myd Regioun of the air,
Quhare no manner of perturbatioun
Of wedder may ascend so hie as their.
Four fludis flowing from ane Fontane fair
As Tigris, Ganges, Euphrates, and Nyle,
Quhilk in the eist, Transcurtis money ane mile.
The country closit is about full richt,
With wallis hie, of hot and birnyng fire,
And straightly keipit be ane Angel bricht
Sen the departing of Adam, our Grand schyre,
Quhilk throw his crime Incurrit Goddis (...),
And of that place tint the Possessioun,
Both from him self, and his Successioun.
Quhen this lufesum lady Remembrance
All this foresaid had gart me understand,
I prayit her of her benevolence
To schaw to me, the country of Scotland.
Well sone (scho said) that sal I tak on hand,
So suddandlie, scho brocht me in certane,
Euin Just abone the braid I Will of Britane.
Quhilk standis northwest in the Occeane see,
And deuydit in famous Regionis two.
The south part Ingland, ane full richt country,
Scotland be north, with money Ilis mo.
Be west Ingland, Ireland doith stand also.
Quhose properteis, I will nocht tak on hand
To schaw at lenth, bot only of Scotland.
OF THE REALM OF SCOTLAND.
QUhilk after my sempyll Intendement,
And as Remembrance did to me report,
I fall declare the suith, and verrayment
As I best can, and in to terms schort.
Quhairfor effecteo uslie, I ow exhort,
Quhowbeit my wrytting be nocht till auance,
it quhare I faill, excuse mine Ignorance.
Quhen that I had ouersene this Regioun,
The quhilk of nature is boith good and fair,
I did propone, ane little questioun
Beseikand her, the same for to declair.
Quhat is the cause, our boundis been ^o bair,
(Quod I) or quhat dois move our Mise^i^,
Or quhareof dois proceid our poverty?
For throw the support of our her prudence
Of Scotland, I persaue the properteis.
And als considderis be experience
Of this country the greit commoditeis.
First the abundance of fischis in our seis,
And fructuall montanis for our bestiall,
And for our cornis, money lusty vaill.
The rich Ryueris plesand and proffitabill,
The lusty loichis, with fische of sindry kyndis,
Hounting, halking, for nobillis conuenabill,
Forrestis full of Da, Ra, Hartis, and Hyndis,
The fresche fontanis, quhose holesu^ cristal strandis
Refreschis so, the flurischit grene meidis.
So laik we no thing that to nature neidis.
Of euerilk mettell, we have the rich Mynis,
Both Gold, Silver, and stonis precious.
Howbeit we want the Spycis and the wynis.
Or other strange fructis delicious,
We have als good, and more neidfull for us,
Meit, drink, fire, claithis yar in ye be gart abound.
Quhilkes ellis is nocht in all the Mapamound^
More faiter people, nor of greiter ingyne
Nor of more strenth, greit deidis till endure.
Quharefor I pray ow, that e wald detyne
The principal cause, quharefor we at so pure,
For I marvel greitlie, I ow assure,
Considderand the people, and the ground,
That Riches should nocht in this realm redound.
My Sone (scho said) be my discretioun,
I sall make answeir, as I understand.
I say to the under confessioun,
The falt is nocht, I dat weill tak on hand,
Another in to the people nor the land.
As for the land, it laikis na other thing,
Bot laubour, and the pepillis governing.
Than quharein lyis our Inprosperite
(Quod I) I pray ow hartfullie Madame
e wald declair to me the verite.
Or quho sall beir of our barrat the blame?
For be my treuth to se, I think greit schame
So plesand people, and so fait ane land,
And so few verteous deidis taken on hand.
Quod scho, I sall after my Judgment,
Declair sum causis, in to general,
And in to terms schort schaw mine intent,
And syne transcend in to more special.
So this is mine conclusioun final.
Wanting of Justice, policy, and peace,
At cause, of their unhappiness allace.
It is difficill Riches till incres,
Quhare Polycie makith no residence.
And Policy may never have entres,
Bot quhare that Justice dois diligence
To puneis quhare their may be found offense.
Justice may nocht have Dominatioun,
Bot quhare Piece makis habitatioun.
Quhat is the cause, that wald I understand.
That we should want Justice, and policy,
More than deis France, Italy, or Ingland
Madame (quod I) schaw me the verite?
Sen we have lawis in this country,
Quhy want we lawis exercitioun
Quho should put Justice till executioun.
Quhare in dois stand our principal remeid,
Or quha may make a mendis of this mischief?
(Quod scho) I find the falt in to the heid,
For they in quhome dois ly our hole releif,
I find them rute, and ground of all our grief.
For quhen the heidis ar nocht diligent,
The membris man on neid be negligent.
So I conclude, the causis principal
Of all the trubill of this Natioun,
Ar into Princis in to special,
The quhilkis hes the Gubernatioun,
And of the people Dominatioun.
Quhose contynewall exercitioun
Sulde be in Justice Executioun.
For quhen the sleuthfull hird, dois sloug and sleip,
Taking no cure, in keeping of his flok
Quho will go search amang sic hirdis scheip,
May able find money pure scabbit crok,
And going wyld at large withouttin lok.
Than Lupus tu^mis, and Lowrence in ane ling
And dois but reuth, the sely scheip dounthring.
Bot the good hird, walkryfe and diligent
Doith so, that all his flockis ar rewlit richt.
To quhose quhissill all ar obedient
And give the wolfis cummis day or nicht
Them to deuore, than ar they put to flicht,
Houndit and slane, be their weill dantit doggis,
So ar they sure, both owis, lambis, and hoggis.
So I conclude, that throw the negligence
Of our infatuate heidis Insolent,
Is cause of all this realms indigence,
Quhilkes in Justice, hes nocht been diligent,
Bot to good counsall inobedient,
Hauand small E^, unto the commoun weill
Bot to their singular profit euerilk deill.
For quhen their Wolfis be oppressioun
The pure people but piete doith oppres,
Than should the princis make punitioun,
And cause they Rebaldis for to make redres,
That riches micht be, and Policy incres.
Bot richt difficill it is to make remeid
Quh^n that the falt is so in to the heid.
THE COMPLAYNT OF THE Comoun weill of Scotland.
ANd thus as we were talking to and fro,
We saw a bustedus berne cu^ ouir ye bent,
But horse on fute, als fast as he micht go
Quhose raiment was all raggit rewin and vent
With visage leyne, as he had fastit lent.
And fordwart fast his wayis he did advance,
With ane richt melancholious countenance.
With scrip on hip, and pyikstaff in his hand,
As he had been purposit, to pas sra hame.
Quod I good man, I wald feign understand,
Give that e pleis^t to wit quhat were our name.
Quod he my sone, of that I think greit schame.
Bot sen thou wald of my name have ane feill,
Forsooth they call me Ihone the comoun weill.
Schir Commoun weil, quho hes ow so disgysit
(Quod I) or quhat makis ow so miserabill,
I have marvel, to se ow so supprysit,
The quhilk that I have seen so honorabill,
To all the world, e have been proffitabill,
And weill honorit in euerilk Natioun.
How happinnis now our tribulatioun?
Allace (quod he) thou seis how it dois stand
With me, and quhow I am disheritsit
Of all my grace, and inon pas of Scotland.
And go before, quhare I was cheriset.
Remane I heir, I am bor perisit,
For their is few to me, that takis tent,
That garris me go, so raggit, rewin, and rent.
My tender feeindis ar all put to the flicht
For Policy is fled agane in France,
My Sister Justice, almaist haith tynt her sicht,
That scho can nocht hald ewinly her balance.
Plane wrang, is plane capitane of Ordinance,
The quhilk debarres Laute, and resoun,
And small remeid is found for oppin tresoun.
In to the south allace I was neir slane.
Over all the land I culd find no releif.
Almoist betuix the Mers, and Lotchmabane,
I culd no^ht know ane leill man be ane theif.
To schaw their reif, thift, murthour, and mischief,
And vicious workis it wald infect the air,
And als langsum, to me for till declair.
In to the hieland, I could find no remeid,
Bot suddandlie, I was put to exile,
Thai sweir swyngeoures they tuke of me no^ heid,
Nor amengis them, let me remane ane quhyle.
Als in the out Ilis, and in Argyle,
Unthrift, sweirnes, falset, pouerte, and strife,
Pat Policy in danger of her life.
In the law land, I come to seik refuge.
And purposit their to make my residence.
Bot singular proffect, gart me sone disluge,
And did me greit Iniuris, and offense.
And said to me, swyith harlote hy the hence,
And in this country se thou tak no curis,
So lang as my authorite induris.
And now I may make no langer debait,
Nor I wat nocht, quhome to I should me mean,
For I have socht throw all the Spiritual stait,
Quhilkes tuke na count for to heir me complene,
Their officiaris they held me at disdane,
For Symonie, he rewlis up all that rout.
And Couetice that Carl gart bar me out.
Pride haith chaist from them humilite,
Deuotioun is fled unto the freiris.
Sensual plesour hes baneist Chaistite,
Lordis of Religioun, they go like Seculeris,
Taking more count in telling their deneris,
Nor they do of their constitutioun.
Thus ar they blindit be ambitioun.
Our gentill men ar all degenerate.
Liberalite, and Lawte, boith ar lost.
And Cowardice with Lordis is laureate,
And knychtlie curage turnit in brag and boist.
The Civil weir misgydis euerilk oist.
Their is nocht ellis, bot ilk man for him self,
That garris me go, thus baneist like ane elf.
Tharefor adieu, I may no langer tarry.
Fair weil (quod I) and with sanct Iohne to borrow.
Bot wit e weill, my heart was woundit sarie
Quhen comoun weill so sopit was in sorrow,
it after the nicht, cu^mis the glaid morrow.
Quharefore I pray ow schaw me in certane,
Quhen that e purpose for to cum agane.
That questioun it sall be sone decydit,
(Quod he) their sall na Scot have conforting
Of me, till that I see the country gydit
Be wisdom, of ane good auld prudent king,
Quhilk sall delight him may above all thing,
To put Justice till executioun,
And on strange tratouris make punitioun.
Als it to the I say ane other thing,
I se rycht weill that proverb is full true,
Woe to the realm, that hes ouir oung ane king.
With that he turnit his bak, and said ad^w.
Over firth and fell, richt taste fra me he flew.
Quhose departing to me was displesand.
With that Remembrance tuk me be the hand.
And sone me thocht scho brocht me to the roche,
And to the Coue, quhare I began to sleip.
With that one schip did spedilie approach,
Full plesandlie sailling upon the deip,
And syne did slak her saillis, and began to creip
Towart the land, anent quhare that I lay.
Bot wit e weill, I gat ane fellown fray.
All her Cannounis, sche leit crak attonis,
Down schuke the stremaris, from ye topcastell.
They spairit nocht the poulder nor the stonis,
Thai schot their boutis, and down yair ankers fell,
The Marinaris, they did so out and ell,
That haistelie I steit out of my dreme,
Half in ane fray, and spedilie past hame.
And lychtlie dynit, with list and appetyte.
Syne after past in till ane Oritore,
And tuke my pen, and their began to write
All the visioun, that I have schawin before.
Schir of my dreme, as now thou gettis no more,
Bot I beseik God, for to send the grace,
To rewle thy Realm in unite, and peace.
THE EXHORTATIOVN TO THE KINGIS GRACE.
SChir sen that God of his preordinance,
Haith grantit the, to have the governance
Of his people, and create the one King,
Faill nocht to prent in thy Remembrance
That he will nocht excuse thine Ignorance,
Give thou be rekles in thy governing.
Quharefor dres the above all other thing,
Of his lawis to ke^p the observance,
And thou schaip lang in Royalty to ring.
Thank him, that hes commandit dame Nature,
To prent the of so plesand portrature.
Her gyftis may be cleirly on the knawin.
Till dame Fortune, thou neidis no procurature,
For scho hes largely, kyith on the her cure.
Her gratitude scho hes unto the schawin.
And sen that thou man scheir, as thou hes sawin,
Have all thy hope in God thy Creator,
And ask him grace, that thou may be his awin.
And syne considder thy vocatioun,
That for to have the gubernatioun
Of this kynrik, thou art predestinate,
Thou may weill wit be true narratioun,
Quhat sorrow, and quhat tribulatioun
Haith been in this pure realm unfortunate.
Now conforte them that hes been desolate,
And of thy people have compassioun,
Sen thou be God, art so preordinate.
Tak manly curage, and leif thine Insolence,
And use counsall of nobyll dame Prudence.
Found the fermelie on faith and fortitude,
Draw to thy court, Justice, and temperance.
And to the Commoun weill have attendance.
And also I beseik thy Celsitude,
Hait vicious men, and lufe them that are good.
And ilk flatterer thou fleme from thy presence,
And falls report out of thy court exclude.
Do equal Justice, boith to greit and small,
And be exempill to thy people all,
Exercing verteous deidis honorabill.
Be nocht ane wreche, for oucht that may befall,
To that unhappy vice and thou be thrall.
Till all men thou sall be abhominabill.
Kingis ^ar knichtis, ar never co^uanabill
To rewle people, be they nocht liberal,
Was never it na wreche to honor abill.
And tak exemple of the wrechit ending
Quhilk maid Mydas, of Thrace ye mychtie king,
That to his Goddis maid Inuocatioun,
Throw gredines that all substancial thing
That ever he twichit, should turn but tarying
In to fine gold, he gat his supplicatioun,
All that he twichit but dilatioun
Turnit in gold, boith meit, drink, and clething,
And deit for hounger but recreatioun.
Als I beseik thy Majesty serene,
From Lechery, thou keip thy body clean
Taist never that Intoxicate poysoun
From that unhappy sensual Syn abstene,
Till that thou get ane lusty plesand Queen,
Than tak thy plesour with my benisoun.
Tak tent how prydful Tarquyne tynt his croun,
For the deforsing of Lucrece the schene.
And was depryuit, and banist Romes town.
And in despyit of his Lecherous leuing,
The Romany wald be subject to no king.
Money lang eir, as storyis doith record,
Till Julius, throw verteous governing,
And Princely curage, began on them to ring,
And chosin of Romany, Empriour, and lord.
Quharfor my Souerane in to thy mind remord,
That vicious life, makis often ane evil ending,
Without it be throw special grace restord.
And give thou wald thy fame and honor grew,
Use counsall of thy prudent Lordis true,
And se thou nocht presumpteouslie pretend,
Thy a win particular weill for till Ensew.
Wirk with counsall, so sall thou never rue.
Remember of thy Freindis the fatal end,
Quhilkis to good counsall wald not condescend.
Till bitter deith (allace) did them persew.
From sic unhap I pray God the defend.
And finally, remember thou mon de^
And suddanlie pas of this mortal see,
And art nocht sicker of thy life two houris.
Sen their is none from that sentence may flee.
King, Queen, nor Knicht, of law estait nor hie,
Bot all mon thole of deith, the bitter schouris.
Quhar been they gone, their papis and empriouris?
Been they nocht deed, so sall it fair on the.
Is no remeid, strenth, riches, nor honouris.
And so for conclusioun,
Make our Prouisioun
To get the infusioun
Of his hie grace
Quhilk bled with effusioun
With scorn and derisioun.
And deit with confusioun,
Confirmand our peace. AMEN.
FINIS.
The Complaint of Schir David Lindesay, of the Mont Knicht, direct to the
Kingis Grace. *
SChir I beseik thine Excellence,
Heir my complaynt with patience,
My dolent heart dois me constrayne,
Of my Infortune to complain.
Quhowbeit I stand in greit doutance,
Quhome I sall wit of my mischance.
Quhidder Saturnis crucite
Regnand in my Natiuite
^e bad aspect, quhilk wirkis vengeanre,
Or vtheris heavenly influence.
Or give I be predestinate
In court to be Unfortunate,
Quhilk hes so lang in service been
Continually with king and queen.
And enterit to thy Majesty
The day of thy Natiu^^e,
Quharethrow my freindis been eschamit,
And with my fais I am defamit,
Seand that I am nocht regardit
Nor with my brether in Court rewardit,
Blamand my sle^thfull negligence
That seikis nocht sum recompense.
Quhen diverse men dois me demand
Quhy gettis thou nocht sunt piece of land,
Als weill as other men hes gottin.
Than wis I to be deid and rottin,
With sic extreme discomforting
That I can make no answering.
I wald sum wise man did me teiche,
Quhidder that I should flatter or fleiche
I will nocht flyte, that I conclude
For crabing of thy Celsitude.
And to flatter, I am defamit.
Want I reward, than am I schamit.
Bot I hope thou sall do als weill
As did the Father of Fameill,
Of quhome Christ makis mentioun
Quhilk for ane certane pensioun
Feit men to wirk in his wine aird.
Bot quho come last, gat first rewaird.
Quharethrow the first men were displeisit.
Bot he them prudentlie ameisit.
For thocht the last men, first were seruit,
it gat the first that day deseruit.
So am I sure thy majesty,
Sall anis reward me or I de,
And rub the roust of my ingyne
Quhilk been for langour like to tyne.
Althocht I beit nocht like ane baird
Lang service arnis ay rewaird.
I can nocht blame thine excellence,
That I so lang want recompense.
Had I solistit like the laue
My reward had nocht been to crave
Bot now I may weill understand,
Ane dum man it wan never land.
And in the court men gettis na thing
Without inopportune asking.
Allace my sleuth and schamefulnes
Debarrit frame all gredines.
Gredie men that are diligent
Rycht often obtenis their intent,
And faileis nocht to conqueis landis,
And namely at oung Princis handis.
Bot I tuke never none other cure.
In special, bot for thy pleasure.
Bot now I am na mair dispaird,
Bot I sall get Princely rewaird,
The quhilk to me sal be mair glore
Nor them thou did reward before.
Quhen men dois ask ocht at ane king,
Sulde ask his grace ane nobill thing,
To his Excellence honorabill,
And to the asker proffitabill.
Thocht I be in my asking lidder,
I pray thy grace for to considder.
Thou hes maid both lordis and lairdis,
And hes gewin money rich rewairdis
To them that was full far to seik,
Quhen I lay nychtlie be thy cheik.
I tak the Quenis grace thy mother.
My lord Chancellar, and money other,
Thy Nuris, and thy auld Maistres,
I tak them all to beir witness.
Auld Willie Dillie were he on live,
My life full weill he could discryue.
Quhow as ane Chapman betis his pak.
I bure thy grace upon my bak.
And sumtymes stridlingis on my nek,
Dansand with money bend and bek.
The first sillabis that thou did mute
Was pa, da lyn, upon the lute.
Than playit I twenty springis perqueir,
Quhilk was greit piete for to heir,
Fra play thou leit me never rest,
Bot gynkertoun thou lufit ay best.
And ay quhen thou come from the scule
Than I behufit to play the fule.
As I at lenth in to my Dreme,
My sindry service did expreme.
Thocht it been better (as sayis the wise)
Hap to the court, nor good service.
I wat thou luffit me better than,
Nor now sum wife dois her good man.
Than men till other did record,
Said Lyndesay, wald be maid ane Lord.
Thou hes maid lordis (Schir) be sanct Geill.
Of sum that hes nacht seruit so weill.
To ow my Lordis that standis by,
I sall ow schaw the causis quhy,
Give e list tarry I sall tell,
Quhow my Infortune first befell.
I prayit daily on my kne,
My oung master that I micht se,
Of eild in his Estait Royal,
Hauand power Imperial.
Than traistit I without demand,
To be promouit to sum land.
Bot my asking I gat over sone,
Because ane Clips fell in the Moon,
The quhilk all Scotland maid on s^el^
Than did my purpose ryn arreis.
The quhilk war langsum to declair,
And als my heart is wounder fair,
Quhen I have in remembrance,
The suddand change to my myschance.
The King was bot twelf eris of age,
Quhen new rewlaris come in their rage,
For commoun weill makand no cair,
Bot for their profeit singulair.
Imprudently, like witles fulis,
They tuke that oung Prince from the sculis,
Quhare he under Obedience,
Was lern and vertew and science.
And haistelie plat in his hand
The governance of all Scotland.
As quho wald in ane stormy blast,
Quhen Matinaris been al aghast
Throw danger of the seis rage,
Wald tak ane Child of tender age,
Quhilk never had been upon the sey,
And to his bidding al obey,
Geuyng him haill the gouernall
Of schip, Merchand, and Marinall.
For breid of rockis and foreland,
To put the Ruther in his hand.
Without Godds grace is no refuge.
Give their be danger, e may Judge.
I give them to the devil of hell
Quhilk first deuysit that counsel.
I will nocht say that it was tresoun,
Bot I der sweir, it was no resoun.
I pray God, let me never se ring
In to this realm, so oung ane King.
I may nocht tarry to decydit,
Quhow than the ^su^t ane quhyle was gydit,
Be them that pertlie luke on hand
To gyde the king and all Scotland.
And als langsum for to declair,
Their facund flattering wordis fair.
Schir, sum wald say our Majesty
Shall now go to our liberte.
e sall to no man be coactit,
Nor to the scule no more subiectit.
We think them verray natural fulis,
That lernis over mekle at the sculis.
Schir, e mon learn to ryn ane speir,
And gyde ow like ane man of weir,
For we sall put sic men about ow.
That all world and mo sall dout ow.
Than to his grace they put ane gaird,
Quhilk haistelie gat their rewaird
Ilk man after their qualite
They did s^li^^ his Majesty.
Sum gart him raueli at the rakket,
Sum harlie him to the hurly hakket.
And sum to scha^ their courtly corsis,
Wald ryed to leith, and ryn there hoissis,
And wichtlie wallop ^uir the sandis.
e nowther spairit sp^rris nor wandis,
Castand galmoundes with bendis and beckis,
For wantones, sum brab their neckis.
Their was no play bot cartis and dyce,
And ay schir flattery bure the price.
Roundand and rowkand ane till ane other
Tak thou my part (quod he) my bruther,
And make betuix us sicker bandis,
Quhen ocht sall vaik amangis our handis,
That ilk man stand to help his fallow.
I hald thareto man be alhallow,
Swa thou fische nocht within my boundis,
That sall I nocht be goddis woundis,
(Quod he) bot eirar tak thy part.
Swa sall I thine, be goddis heart.
And give the Thesaurer be our friend,
Than sall we get both tak and teind.
Tak he our part, than quha dar wrang us?
Bot we sail part the pelf amang us.
Bot haist us quhill the king is oung,
And lat ilk man, keip weill ane tongue
And in ilk quarter have ane spy
Ws till aduertis haistely
Quhen any casualiteis
Sall happin in till our countries.
Let us make sure prouisioun
Or he cum to discretioun.
No more he wait nor dois ane sanct.
Quhat thing it been to have or want.
So or he be of perfyte age
We sall be sicker of our wage,
And syne lat ilk ane carll crane other.
That mouth speik mair (quod he) my brother.
For God nor I tar in ane raip,
Thou micht give counsall to the Paip,
Thus lauborit they within few eiris,
That they become no paigis peicis.
S^a haistelie they maid ane hand.
Sum gadderit gold, sum conqueist land.
(Schir) sum wald say, be sanct Dionis,
Give me sum fat Benefyis,
And all the proffect e sall have.
Give me the name, tak ow the laue.
Bot be his bowis war weill cummit hame,
To make service he wald think schame.
Syne slip away withouttin more,
Qu^en he had gottin, that he sang fore.
Me ch^^ht it was ane preteous thing,
To se that fair oung tender king,
Of quhome their gallandis stude none aw.
To play with him, pluk at the craw.
They become rich, I ow assure,
Bot ay the Prince remanit pute.
Their was few of that garnisoun,
That lernit him ane good lessoun.
Bot sum to crak, and sum to clatter.
Sum maid the f^le, and sum did flatter.
(Quod ane) the Devil stik me with ane knyfe,
Bot schir, I know ane maid in Fyft,
Ane of the lustiest wantoun lassis,
Quhar to schir, be goddis blude scho passis,
Hald thy tongue brother (quod ane other)
I know ane faire^ be fyftene futher.
(Schir) quhen e pleis to Linlithquo pas,
Their sall e se ane lusty las.
Now trutill trattil trow low,
(Quod the third man) thou dois bot mow,
Quhen his grace cummis to fair Stirling,
Their sall he se, ane dayis darling.
Schir quod the fourt, tak my counsel,
And go all to the hie bordell,
Their may we lowp at liberte
Withouttin any grauite.
Thus every man said for him self,
And did amang them part the pelf.
Bot I (allace) or ever I wist,
Was trampit down in to the dust,
With heavy charge withouttin more.
Bot I wist never it quharfore.
And haistelie before my face,
Ane other slippit in my place,
Quhilk richly gat his rewaird.
And stylit was the Ancient lord.
That time I mycht make no defense,
Bot tuke perforce in patience.
Prayand to send them ane mischance,
That had the Court in governance,
The quhilkis aganis me did maling,
Contrair the plesour of the king.
For weill I knew his gracis mind
Was ever to me true and kind,
And contrair their Intentioun
Gart pay me weill my pensioun.
Thocht I ane quhyle wantit presence,
He leit me have no Indigence.
Quhen I durst another peip nor luke
it wald I hyde me in ane nuke
To se those uncouth vaniteis.
Quhow they like any besie beis
Did occupy their goldin houris
With help of their new gouernouris.
Bot my complaynt for to compleit,
I gat the sour, and they the sweit.
Als Ihone Makrery the kingis fule
Gat dowvyll garmountis agane the ule.
it in his may triumphant glore,
For his reward gat the grand glore.
Now in the Court sendill he gois
In dreid men stramp upon his tois.
As I that time durst nocht be seen
In oppin Court, for both my Eine.
Allace I have no time to tarry
To schaw ow all the ferie farie.
Quhow those that had the governance.
Amangis them selfis raisit variance.
And quho may to my skaith consentit,
Within few eiris full sore repentit,
Quhen they could make me no remeid,
For they war harlit out be the heid,
And vtheris tuke the governing,
Weil wors than they in alkin thing.
They Lordis tuke no more regaird,
Bot quho mycht purches best rewaird.
Sum to their freindis gat beneficeis,
And other sum gat Bischopreis.
For every lord, as he thocht best,
Brocht in ane bird to fill the nest,
To be ane wacheman to his marrow.
They began to draw ai the cat harrow.
The proudest Prelatis of the kirk,
Was feign to hyde them in the mirk
That time, so faileit was tharesicht.
Sen syne they may nocht those the licht
Of Christis true Gospel to be seen,
So blyndit is their corporal Ene
With warldlie lustis sensual,
Taking in realms the gouernall,
Both gyding court and sessioun.
Contrair to their professioun.
Quhare of I think, they should have schame
Of spiritual preistis to tak the name.
For Esayas, in to his wark,
Callis them like Doggis, that can nocht bark,
That callit ar preistis, and can nocht preiche,
Nor Christis law to the people reiche.
Give for to preiche, been their professioun,
Quhy should they mell, with court or Sessioun?
Except it war in spiritual thingis.
Referring unto lordis and kingis
Temporal causis to be decydit.
Give they their spiritual office gydit,
Ilk man mycht say, they did their partis
Bot give they can play at the cairtis,
And mollet moylie on ane Mule,
Thocht they had never seue the scule,
it at this day, als weill as than
Will be maid sic ane spiritual man.
Princis that sic prelatis promouis
Account thareof to give behouis,
Quhilk sall nocht pas but punischement,
Without they mend, and sore repent,
And with dew ministratioun
Wyrk after their vocatioun,
I wys that thing quhilk will nocht be
Their peruerst Prelatis ar so hic.
From time that they been callit lordis,
They ar occasioun of discordis,
And largely will propynis hecht,
To gar ilk Lord with other fecht,
Give for their part it may auaill.
Swa to the purpose of my taill,
That time in Court raise greit debait,
And euerilk lord did strive for stait,
That all the realm micht make no redding,
Quhill on ilk side their was blude schedding.
And feildit other in land and burgh
At Linlithgow, Melros, and Edinburgh.
Bot to deplore, I think greit pane
Of nobyll men, that their was slane.
And als langsum to be reportit
Of them quhilk to the Court resortit.
As tyrrannis, tratouris and transgressouris,
And commoun publict plane oppressouris.
Men murdreisaris, and commoun theiffis,
In to that Court gat all releiffis.
Their was few lordis in all their landis,
Bot till new Regentis maid their bandis
Than raise ane reik or ever I wist,
The quhilk gart all their bandis brist.
Than they allone, quhilk had the gyding
They could nocht keip their feit from slyding,
Bot of their lyffis they had sic dreid,
That they war feign till trot over Tweid.
*
NOw Potent Prince I say to the,
I thank the haly Trinite,
That I have leuit to se this day,
That all that world is went away,
And thou to no man art subiectit,
Nor to sic counsalouris coactit.
The four greit virtues Cardinallis
I se them with the principallis.
For Justice haldis her swerd on hie,
With her balance of Equite.
And in this realm has maid sic ordour,
Both throw the hieland, and the bordour,
That Oppressioun, and all his fallowis,
Ar hang it hich upon the gallowis.
Dame Prudence hes the be the heid
And temporance dois thy brydill leid.
I se Dame Force make assistance,
Beirand thy Targe of assurance,
And lusty Lady Chaistite
Hes banischit Sensualite
Dame Riches takis on the sic cure,
I pray God, that scho lang endure,
That Pouerte dar nocht be seen
In to thy house, for both her Ene,
Bot fra thy grace fled money mylis,
Amangis the Hountaris in the Ilis.
Dissimulance dar nocht schaw her face,
Quhilk wount was to begyle thy grace.
Folly is fled out of the town,
Quhilk ay was contrair to ressoun.
Policy and Piece begynnis to plant,
That verieous men can no thing want.
And as for sleuthfull Idle lownis.
Sall fetterit be in the Gaileownis.
Ihone Vponland been full blyith I trow.
Because the rysche bus, keipis his kow.
Swa is their nocht I understand,
Without good ordour in this land,
Except the spiritualite,
Pray and thy grace, thareto have Ee,
Cause them make ministratioun
Conform to their vocatioun.
To Precht, with vnfeneit intentis.
And trewly use the Sacramentis
After Christis Institutionis.
Leuing their vane traditionis,
Quhilkis dois the silly scheip Illude.
Quhame for Christ Jesus sched his blude.
As superstitious pilgramagis,
Prayand to grawin Imagis,
Expres aganis the Lordis command.
I do thy grace till understand,
Give thou to mennis lawis assent
Aganis the Lordis Commandment,
As Jeroboam, and money mo
Princis of Israel also
Assentaris to Idolatry,
Quhilkis punist war rycht pieteouslie,
And from their realms were rutit out.
So sall thou be withouttin dout,
Both heir and hyne withouttin more,
And want the euerlesting glore.
Bot give thou will thine heart inclyne,
And keip his blyssit law deuyne,
As did the faithful Patriarkis,
Boith in their wordis, and in their warkis,
And as did money faithful kingis
Of Israel during their ringis,
As king David, and Salomone
Quha Imagis wald suffer none,
In their rich Tempillis for to stand,
Because it was nocht Goddis command,
Bot destroy it all Idolatry
As in the Scripture, thou may see.
Quhose rich reward was heuinly blis,
Quhilk sall be thine, thou do and this.
Sen thou hes chosin sic ane gaird,
Now am I sure, to get rewaird.
And sen thou art the richest king,
That ever in this realm did ring,
Of gold and stonis precious,
May prudent and Ingenious.
And hes thy honor done auance
In Scotland, Ingland, and in France,
Be Martial deidis honorabill,
And art till every vertewabill.
I wat thy grace nocht misken me,
Bot thou will other give, or len me.
Wald thy grace, len me to ane day
Of gold, ane thousand pound, or tway,
And I sall fir with good intent,
Thy grace ane day of payment,
With Seillit Obligatioun,
Under this protestatioun,
Quhen the Bas, and the I Will of May,
Beis set upon the mont Sinay:
Quhen the Lowmound beside Falkland,
Beis liftit to Northumberland:
Quhen Kirkmen airnis no dignite,
Nor Wyffis no Soueranite:
Winter but frost, snaw, wynd, or rane,
Than sall I give thy gold agane,
Or I sall make the payment
After the day of Judgment,
Within ane month at the leist,
Quhen Sanct Peter sall make ane feist
To all the Fischaris of Aberladie,
Swa thou have mine Acquittance reddie.
Faileand thareof, be sanct Phillane,
Thy grace gettis never ane grote agane.
Give thou be nocht content of this,
I man requeist the King of blis,
That he to me have sum regaird,
And cause thy grace me to rewaird.
For David King of Israel,
Quhilk was the greit Propheit Royal.
Sayis, God hes haill at his command
The hartis of Princis in his hand.
Ewin as he list them for to turn,
That man they do without sudgeorne.
Sum till exalt to dignite.
And sum to depryue in pouerte.
Sum time of layit men, to make lordis,
And sum time lordis to bind in cordis,
And them alutterlie distroy,
As plesis God, that royal Roy.
For thou art bot ane Instrument
To that greit King Omnipotent.
So, quhen it plesis his excellence,
Thy grace sall make me recompense.
Or he sall cause me stand content,
Of quiet life, and sober rent.
And tak me in my letter age
Unto my sempyll Hermitage,
And spend that my Eldaris wun,
As did Diogenes in his twn.
Of this complaynt with mind full meik,
Thy gracis answeir (Schir) I beseik.

THE PROLOG.
NOCHT Lang ago after the hour of prime.
Secreitly sitting in mine Oratorie.
I tuke ane Buke till occupy the time,
Quhare I fand money Tragedy and story,
Quhilk Ihone Boccace, had put in memory.
Quhow money Princis, Conqueroures and Kingis
War dulefullie deposit, from their ringis.
Quhow Alexander, the potent Conqueror
In Babylon was poysonit pieteouslie.
And Julius, the michtie Emperor
Murdreist at Rome, causles and cruelly.
Prudent Pompey, in Egypt schamefullie,
He murdreist was, quhat nedith process more?
Quhose Tragedyis, war piety till deplore.
I sitting so, upon my Buke reding,
Rycht suddantlie, a fore me did appeir
Ane woundit man, abundantly bleiding,
With visage paill, and with ane deidlie their.
Semand ane man of two and fifty eit,
In Raiment reid, clothit full curiously,
Of weluoit and of Satyn Crammosie.
With febill voce, as man oppressed with pane,
Softly he maid me supplicatioun.
Sayand, my friend, go reid, and reid agane,
Give thou can find, be true Narratioun
Of any pane like to my passioun.
Richt sure I an^^^ at Ihone Boceace on live,
My Tragedy at lenth he wald descryue.
Sen he is gone, I pray the till indyte
Of my Infortune sum Remembrance.
Or at the leist, my Tragedy to wryt,
As I to the sall schaw the Circumstance,
In termis breue of my unhappy chance,
Sen my beginning, till my fatal end.
Quhilk I wald till all creature were kend.
I not said I, make sic memorial
But of thy name I had Intelligence.
I am David, that cairfull Cardinal
Quhilk doith appeir (said he) to thy presence.
That vmquhyle had so greit preeminence.
Than he began, his deidis till indyte
As e sall heir, and I began to write.
I David Betoun Vmquhyle Cardinal,
Of nobill blude, be line I did descend,
During my time I had no peregall.
Bot now is cum, allace my fatal end.
Ay gre, be gre vpwart I did ascend
Swa that in to this realm did never ring
So greit one man as I, under ane king
Quhen I was ane oung Ioly gentill man,
Princis to serve, I set my hole intent.
First till ascend, at Arbroith I began
Ane Abbacie, of greit riches and rent.
Of that estait, it was I nocht content,
To get more riches, dignite, and glore,
My heart was set, allace, allace, tharefore.
I maid sic service till our Souerane king,
He did Promoue me till more hie estate.
One Prince abufe al preistis for til ring,
Archebischop of Sanctandrois consecrate.
Till that honor quhen I was Eleuate,
My prydefull heart was nocht content at all,
Till that I create was ane Cardinal.
it preissit I till have more authorite.
And finally, was chosin Chancellair.
And for vphalding of my dignite,
Was maid Legate than had I no compair.
I purchest for my proffect singulair,
My Boris, and my Thresure till auance.
The Bischoprik of Mecepois in France.
Of all Scotland, I had the Gouernall,
But my a wife concludit was no thing
Abbot, Bischop, Archebischop, Cardinal,
In to this Realm no hieat culd I ting,
Bot I had been Pape, Empriour, or King.
For schortnes of the time, I am nocht abill
At lenth to schaw, my actis honorabill.
For my most Princely Prodigalite,
Amang Prelatis in France I bure the pryse.
I schew my Lordly Liberalite,
In Banketting, playing, at cartis and Dyse.
In to sic wisdom, I was haldin wise.
And sparit nocht to play with king, nor knicht
Three thousand crownis of gold upon ane nicht.
In France, I maid seir honest Voyagis,
Quhare I did Actis digne of Remembrance.
Throuch me war maid Tryu^phant Mariagis,
Till our Souerane boith proffet and plesance.
Queen Magdalene, the first Dochter of France,
With greit riches was in to Scotland brocht.
That marriage throch my wisdom it was wrocht
After quhose deith, in France I past agane,
The secunde Queen, homewart I did conuoy.
That lusty Princes, Marie de Lorane,
Quhilk was resauit with greit triumph and Joy.
So seruit I our richt Redoutit Roy.
Sone after that, Harie of Ingland king
Of our Souerane, desirit ane commoning.
Of that meting, our king was weill content,
So that in ork, was set boith time and place.
Bot our Prelatis, nor I, wald never consent,
That he should se, King Harie in the face,
Bot we were weill content, quhowbeit his grace
Had saillit the sey, to speik with any other,
Except yat king, quhilk was his mother brother.
Quhait throch yar rose, greit weir and mortal strife
Greit heirschipes, hunger, derth, and desolatioun.
On ather side, did money lose their life,
Give I wald make ane true Narratioun,
I causit all that tribulatioun.
For till tak peace, I never wald consent,
With our the king of france had been content.
During this weir, wartaking presoneiris,
Of nobyll men, fechting full furiously
Money one Lord, Barroun, and Bacheleiris,
Quhar throuch our king tuk sic melancholy,
Quhilk drove him to the deid richt dulcfullie.
Extreme Dolor ouirset did so his heart,
That from this life, allace, he did depart.
Bot after that boith strenth and speiche was leisit,
Ane paper blank, his grace I gart subscryue,
In to the quhilk, I wrait all that I pleisit,
After his deith, quhilk lang war till descryue
Throuch that writting, I purposit belyue,
With support of sum Lordis benevolence,
In this Regioun till have Preeminence.
As for my Lord, our richteous Governor,
Give I wald schortlie schaw the verity,
Till him I had no manner of favor,
During that time, I purposit that he
Should never cum to none Auctorite.
For his support tharefor he brocht amang us,
Forth of Ingland, the nobyll Earl of Angus.
Than was I put abak from my purpose,
And suddandlie cast in Captivity,
My prydefull hatt to dant, as I suppose
Deuysit be the hich Divinity.
it in my heart, sprang no humylite,
Bot now the word of God full weill I know,
Quho dois exalt him self, God sall him law.
In the meine time, quhen I was so subiectit,
Ambassadouris war sent in to Ingland.
Quhare they boith piece, and marriage co^tractit.
And more surely, for till observe that band,
War promised diverse plegis of Scotland.
Of that contract, I was no way content,
Nor never wald their to give my consent.
Till Capitanis, that keipit me in waird,
Giftis of gold, I gave them greit plente
Rewlatis of court, I richly did reward,
Quhare throuch I chaipit from Captivity.
Bot quhen I was fre, at my liberte,
Than like ane Lion, lowsit of his Cage.
Out throuch this realm, I began to reil and rage.
Contrar the Governor, and his company,
Often times maid I insurrectioun.
Purposing for till have him haistelie.
Subdewit unto my correctioun.
Or put him till extreme subiectioun.
During this time, give it war weill decydit,
This realm be me was utterly deuydit.
The Governor purposing to subdew,
I rasit ane oist of money bald Barroun,
And maid ane raid, quhilk Lithgow it may rue,
For we destroyit ane mile about the town.
For that I gat money blak malisoun.
it contrair the Gouernouris intent.
With our o^ng Princes, we to Striuiling went.
For hich contemptioun of the Governor,
I brocht the Earl of Lennox, forth of France.
That lusty Lord, leuand in greit plesour,
Did lose that land and honest Ordinance.
Bot he and I, fell sone at variance.
And throch my counsall, was within schort space,
For faltit and flemit, he gat none other grace.
Than throuch my prudence, practik and ingyne,
Our Governor I causit to consent
Full quyetlie, to my counsall inclyne.
Quhare of his Nobilis, war nocht weil content.
For quhy, I gurt dissolve in plane Parliament,
The band of peite, contractit with Ingland.
Quharthroch c^^e harm, and heirschip to scotland.
That piece brokin, arois new mortal weiris,
Be sey, and land, sic reif, without releif,
Quhilk to report, my frayit heart effeiris,
The verite to schaw in termis brief,
I was the rute, of all that greit mischief.
The south country may say, it had been good,
That my Nurice, had smorit me in my cude.
I was the cause of mekle more mischance
For vphald, of my glore, and dignite,
And plesour of the potent King of france,
With Ingland wald I have no unite,
Bot quho considder wald the verite,
We micht full weill have leuit in piece and rest,
Nine or ten eitis, and than playit louse or fast.
Had we with Ingland keipit our contrackis,
Our nobyll men, had leuit in piece and rest.
Our Mercha^dis had nocht lost so money packis,
Our commoun people had nocht been oppressed.
On ather side, all wrangis had been redrest.
Bot Edinburgh sen syne, Leith and Kingorne,
The day, and hour, may ban that I was borne,
Our Governor, to make him to me sure,
With sweit, and subtell wordis, I did him syle,
Till I his Sone, and Air, gat in my cure.
To that effect I fand that crafty wyle,
That he no manner of way ^ycht me begyle
Than leuch I quhen his liegis did allege,
How I his Sone had gottin in to plege.
The Earl of Angus, and his Germane brother.
I purposit, to gar them lose their life.
Rycht so till have destroyit money vthtr,
Sum with the fire, su^ with the sword and knyfe.
In special, money gentle men of fyfe.
And purposit till put to greit Torment
All fauoreris of the auld, and new Testament.
Than every man, they tuke of me sic feir,
That time, quhen I had so greit governance.
Greit Lordis dreiding, I should do them deir,
They durst nocht cum till court but assurance
Sen syne their hes nocht been sic variance.
Now till our Prince Barronis obedientlie,
But assurance, they cum full courteslie.
My hope was most in to the king of France,
To gidder with the Popis holiness.
More than in God, my worschip till auance.
I traistit so in to their gentilnes,
That no man durst presume me till oppres.
Bot quhen the day come of my fatal hour,
Far was from me, their support and succor.
Than to preserve my riches, and my life,
I maid one strenth of wallis hich and braid.
Sic ane Fortres was never found in fyfe.
Beleuand their, durst no man me inuaid.
Now find I true the saw quhilk David said:
Without God of ane house be master of wark,
He wirkis in vane, thocht it be never so stark.
For I was throuch the hi^ power Divine,
Rycht dulefullie doung down amang the as,
Quhilk culd not be throch mortal ma^nis ingyne,
Bot as David did slay the greit Golias,
Or Holopherne, be Judith keillit was
In myd amang his triumphant Army,
So was I slane in to my chief Ciete.
Quhen I had greitest Dominatioun,
As Lucifer had in the heuin Empire,
Came suddandlie my Depriuatioun.
Be them quhilk did my dolent deith conspyre.
So cruel was their furious birnand Ire,
I gat no time, layser, nor liberte
To say, In Manus tuas Domine.
BEhald my Fatal Infelicite,
I beand in my strenth, Incomparabill,
That dreidfull Dungeoun maid me no supple,
My greit riches, nor tentis proffitabill,
My Silver work, Iowellis inestimabill,
My Papal pomp, of gold my rich thresour,
My life and all, I lost in half ane hour.
To the people was maid ane Spectakle,
Of my deid, and deformit Carioun.
Sum said it was ane manifest Myrakle.
Sum said it was Divine Punitioun
So to be slane, in to my strange Doungeoun.
Quhen every man had Iugit as him list,
They Saltit me, syne closit me in ane kissed.
I lay vnburyit sewin monethis and more,
Or I was borne, to closter, kirk, or queir,
In ane midding, quhilk pane been till deplore,
Without suffrage, of Chanoun, Monk, or freir.
All proud Prelatis at me may Lessonis leir,
Quhilk rang so lang, and so triumphantly,
Syne in the duct doung down so dulefullie.
TO THE PRELATIS.
O e My Brether Princis of the Preistis,
I make ow hartly Supplicatioun,
Boith nyckt and day reuolue in to our breistis
The Process of my Depriuatioun.
Considder quhat been our Vocatioun.
To follow me, I pray ow nocht pretend ow,
Bot reid at lenth, this Cedull that I send ow.
e know quhow Jesus his Discipulis sent,
Ambassadouris till every Natioun,
To schaw his law, and his commandment
To all people, by Predicatioun.
Tharefor, I make to ow Narratioun,
Sen e to them ar verray Successouris,
e aucht till do as did our Predecessouris.
Quhow dar e be so bauld till tak on hand,
For to be Herraldis to so greit ane King,
To beir his Message, boith to burgh and land,
e beand dum, and can pronunce no thing.
Like Menstralis, that can nocht play nor sing.
Or quhy should men give to sic Hirdis hyre,
Quhilk can not gyde their scheip about ye mire.
Eschame e nocht to be Christis seruitouris,
And for our fee, hes greit temporal landis?
Syne of our office, can nocht tak the curis,
As Cannone Law, and Scripture ow co^mandis.
e will nocht want, teind scheif, nor offerandis,
Teynd woll, teind lamb, teind Calf, teind gryce and guse,
To make service e ar al out of use.
My deir brether do nocht as e war wount,
Amend our life now, quhill our day Induris.
Traist weill e sall, be callit to our count
Of euerilk thing, belanging to our curis.
Leif hasartrie, our harlottie, and huris,
Remembering on my vnprouisit deid.
For after deith, may no man make remeid.
e Prelates quhilkes hes thousandis for to spend,
e send ane sempyll freir, for ow to preiche,
It is our craft, I make it to ow kend.
our selfis, in our Templis for to preiche,
Bot ferlie nocht, thocht syllie freiris fleiche,
For and they planelie, schaw the verite,
Than will they want the Bischopis cherite.
Quharefor been gewin ow sic Royal rent?
Bot for till find the people Spiritual fude,
Preichand to them, the auld and new Testament,
The law of God, doith planelie so conclude,
Put nocht our hope in to no warldlie good,
As I have done, behauld my greit thresour,
Maid me no help at my unhappy hour.
That day quhen I was Bischop consecrait,
The greit Bible, was bound upon my bak.
Quhat was tharein, little I knew God wait,
More than ane beist, berand ane precious pak.
Bot haistelie, my conuenant I brak
For I was oblissit with my awin consent.
The law of God to preiche with good intent.
Brether richt so quhen e were consecrait
e oblissit ow all on the samyn wise
e may be callit Bischoppis countrefait,
As Gallandis buskit for to make ane gyse.
Now think I Prineis, ar no thing to pryse,
Till give ane famous office till ane fule,
As quho wald put ane Myter on ane Mule.
Allace, and e that sorrowful sicht had seen,
Quhow I lay bullerand, bathit in my blude,
To mend our life, it had occasioun been
And leif our auld, corruptit conswetude.
Faileing their of, than schortlie I conclude,
Without e from our ribaldrie arise,
e sall be seruit, on the samyn wise.
TO THE PRINCIS.
Imprudent Princis but discretioun
Having in eirth power Imperial,
e been the cause of this Transgressioun.
I speik to ow all in to general,
Quhilk doith dispone all office spiritual,
Geuand the saulis, quhilkes been Christis scheip,
To blind Pastouris but conscience to keip.
Quhen e Princis doith laik ane officiar,
Ane Baxter, Browster, or ane master Cuke,
Ane trym Taileour, ane cunnyng Cordynar,
Ouir all the land, at lenth e will gar luke,
Most abill men, sic officis till bruke.
Ane Browster, quhilk can brew most hoilsu^ aill,
Ane cu^nyng Cuke, quhilk best can sessoun caill.
Ane Taileour quhilk hes fosterit been in france,
That can make garmentis on the gayest gyse.
e Princis been the cause of this mischance,
That quhen their doith vaik any benefyse,
e aucht till do upon the samyn wise.
Ga^serche, and seik, both in to burgh and land,
The law of God quho best can understand.
Make him Bischop that prudentlie can preiche,
A^ dois pertene till his vocatioun.
Ane ^^^ione, quhilk his Parischoun can teiche.
Ga^ V^caris make dew Ministratioun.
And als I make ow supplicatioun,
Make our Abbottis of richt Religious men,
Quhilk to the people Christis law can ken.
Bot not to rebaldis, new cum from the roast.
Nor of ane stuffat, stollin out of ane stabill,
The quhilk in to the scule maid never na cost,
Nor never was till Spiritual science abill,
Except the cartis, the dyce, the ches, and tabill,
Of Rome raikeris, nor of rude Ruffianis,
Of calsay Paikeris, nor of Publicanis.
Nor of Fantastike* feneit flatteraris,
Most meit to gather mussillis in to May.
Of Cowhubeis, nor it of clatteraris,
That in the kirk, can another sing nor say
Thocht they be clokit up i^ Clerkis array,
Like doitit Doctoris new cum out of Athenis.
And mu^myll over ane pair of maig^t matenis.
Nocht qualifyit, to bruke ane Benefyis,
Bot throuch schir Symonis solistatioun.
I was promouit on the samyn wyis,
Allace throuch Princis supplicatioun.
And maid at Rome throuch falls Narratioun,
Bischop, Abbot, bot no Religious man.
Quho me promouit, I now their banis (...)
Quhowbeit I was Legate, and Cardinal,
Little I knew, tharein quhat should be done
I understood no science spiritual,
No more than did blind Alane of the moon.
I dreid the king that sittith hich above,
On ow Princis sall make sore punischement,
Rycht so on us throuch richteous Judgment.
On ow Princis for vndiscreit giving,
Till Ignorantis, sic officis till use.
And we, for our Inoportune asking,
Quhilk should have done sic dignite refuse.
Our Ignorance, hes done the world abuse
Throuch Couetice of riches, and of rent.
That ever I was ane Prelate I repent.
O Kingis make e no cair to give in cure,
Virginis professed in to Religioun,
In till the keiping of ane commoun hure?
To make think e nocht greit derisioun,
Ane woman Person of ane Parisoun?
Quhare their been two thousand saulis to gyde,
That from harlottis can not her hippis hyde.
Quhat and king David leuit in their dayis,
Or out of heuin quhat and he lukit down,
The quhilk did found so money fair Abbayis?
Seand the greit Abhominatioun
In money abbayis, of this Natioun,
He wald repent that Narrowit so his boundis,
Of eirly rent, three score of thousand poundis.
Quharfore I counsall euerilk Christian king,
Within his realm make Reformatioun
And suffer no mo Rebaldis, for to ring,
Abufe Christis true Congregatioun.
Faileing thareof I make Narratioun,
That e Princis, and Prelatis all at onis,
Sall bureit be in hell, Saul, blude, and bonis.
That ever I brukit Benefice I rue,
Or to sic hicht so proudely did pretend.
I man depart, tharefor my freindis adieu,
Quhare ever it plesith God, now man I wend.
I pray the till my freindis me Recommend,
And fail nocht at lenth, to put in write
My Tragedy, as I have done Indyte.
FINIS.
The deploratioun of The Deith of Queen Magdalene.
O Cruel Deith, to greit is thy puissance
Deuorar of all erthlie leuyng thingis
Adam, we may the wyit of this mischa^ce
In thy default, this cruel tyrane ringis
And spairis another Empryour nor Kingis.
And now allace hes reft forth of this land
The flour of France, and confort of Scotland.
Father Adam allace that thou abusit
Thy fre will, being Inobedient,
Thou chesit Deith, and lesting life refusit,
Thy Successioun allace, that may repent
That thou hes maid mankind so Impotent,
That it may make to Deith, no resistance.
Exemple of our Queen, the flour of France.
O dreidfull Dragoun, with thy dulefull dart,
Quhilk did nocht spair, of Feminine the flour,
Bot cruelly did pers her throuch the heart,
And wald nocht give her respite for ane hour,
To remane with her Prince, and Paramour,
That scho at laiser, mycht have taken license,
Scotland on the, may cry ane loud vengeance.
Thou leit Mathusalem, leif nine houndreth eir
Three score and nine, bot in thy furious rage.
Thou did deuore, this oung Princes but peir,
Or scho was compleit, seuintene eir of age,
Gredie gorman, quhy did thou nocht assuage,
Thy furious rage, contrair that lusty Queen,
Till we sum fruct, had of her body seen.
O Dame Nature, thou did no diligence,
Contrair this theif quhilk al ye world co^foundis.
Had thou with natural targis maid defense,
That brybour had nocht cu^mit wtin her boundis,
And had been sauit from sic mortal stoundis,
This money ane eir bot quhair was thy discretion
That leit her pas, til we had seen succession.
O Venus, with thy blind sone Cupido,
Fie on ow both, that maid no resistance,
In to our Court, e never had sic two.
So leill Luffaris without dissimulance.
As James the Fifth, and Magdalene of France,
Discending boith of blude Imperial,
To quhome in lufe, I find no perigall.
For as Leander swame outthrow the flude,
To his fair Lady Hero, money nichtis,
So did this prince, throw bulryng stremis wode
With Erlis, baronis, squyaris, and with knichtis,
Contrair Neptune, and Gol and their michtis,
And left his Realm in greit disesperance,
To seik his Lufe, the first Dochter of France.
And scho like prudent Queen Penelope,
Full co^stantlie wald change him for none other,
And for his plesour, left her awin country,
Without regard, to Father or to Mother,
Taking no cure of Sister, nor of Brother,
Bot schortlie tuke her leif, and left them all,
For lufe of him, to quhome lufe maid her thrall.
O dame Fortune quhare was thy greit confort,
Till her to quhome thou was so favorable,
Thy slyding gyftis, maid her no support,
Her hie synage, nor Riches intellible,
I se thy puissance been bot variable,
Quhen her father the most hie cristinit King,
Till his deir Child, mycht make no supporting.
The potent Prince, her lusty lufe and knicht,
With his most hardy Noblis of Scotland,
Contrair that bailfull bribour had no micht,
Thocht all the men had been at his command,
Of France, Flanderis, Italy, and Ingland,
With fifty thousand Millioun of tresour,
Mycht nocht prolong that Ladyis life ane hour.
O Paris of all Citeis principal,
Quhilk did resaue our Prince with laud and glory
Solempnitlie throw Arkis triumphall
Quhilk day been digne to put in memory.
For as Pompey after his Victory,
Was in to Rome, resauit with greit Joy,
So thou resauit, our richt redoutit Roy.
Bot at his Marriage maid upon the morn,
Sic solace, and Solempnizatioun,
Was never seen before, sen Christ was borne,
Nor to Scotland sic consolatioun,
Their selit was, the confirmatioun,
Of the weill keipit ancient alliance,
Maid betuix Scotland, and the realm of france,
I never did se, one day more glorious
So money in so rich abilementis,
Of Silk and gold, with stonis precious,
Sic Banketting, sic sound of Instrumentis,
With sang, and dance, and Martial tornamentis,
Bot like ane storm, after ane plesand morrow,
Sone was our solace, changit in to sorrow.
O traitor deith, quhom none may contramand,
Thou mycht have seen, the preparatioun,
Maid be the three Estaitis of Scotland,
With greit confort, and consolatioun
In euerilk Ciete, Castle, Toure, and Town,
And how ilk Nobill, set his hole intent
To be excellent in Habilement.
Theif, saw thou nocht, the greit preparatiuis,
Of Edinburgh, the Nobill famous town,
Thou saw the people, laboring for their lyuis,
To make triumph, with trump and Clarioun,
Sic plesour was never in to this Regioun
As should have been, the day of her entrace,
With greit propynis, geuin till her grace.
Thou saw makand rycht costly scaffalding,
Depayntit weill, with Gold and asure fine,
Reddie preparit, for the vpsetting,
With Fontanis flowing, watter cleir and wine,
Disagysit folkis, like Creaturis deuyne,
On ilk scaffold, to play ane syndrie story,
Bot all in greiting, turnit thou that glory.
Thou saw money ane lusty fresche galland,
Weill ordourit for resauing of their Queen,
Ilk Craftisman with bent bow in his hand,
Full galeartlie in schort clething of grene,
The honest Burges, cled thou should have seen,
Sum in scarlot, and sum in claith of grane,
For till have met their Lady Souerane.
Prouest, Baillies, and lordis of the town,
The Senatouris in ordour consequent,
Cled in to Silk of Purpure blak and brown,
Syne the greit Lordis of the Parliament,
With money knychtlie Barroun, and baurent,
In Silk and Gold, in colouris consortable,
Bot thou allace, all turnit in to sable.
Syne all the Lordis of Religioun,
And Princes of the preistis venerable,
Full plesandlie in their Processioun,
With all the cunnyng Clerkis honorable,
Bot thiftuouslie thou Tyrane tresonable,
All their greit solace, and Solempniteis,
Thou turnit in till dulefull Dirigeis.
Syne nixt in Ordour passing throw the town,
Thou should have hard the din of Instrumentis,
Of Tabrone, Trumpet, Schalme, and Clarioun,
With reird redoundand throw the Elementis,
The Herauldis, with their awful Vestimentis,
With Maseris, upon ather of their handis,
To rewle the preis, with burneist silver wandis.
Syne last of all in Ordour triumphall,
That most Iliuster Princes honorable,
With her the lusty Ladyis of Scotland,
Quhilk should have been, any sycht most delectable
Her raiment to rehers, I am nocht able,
Of Gold and perle, and precious stonis brycht
Twynkling like sterris in ane frostie nycht.
Under ane Pale of gold, scho should have past,
Be Burgessis borne, clothie in silkis fine,
The greit Master of household all their last.
With him in ordour all the Kingis tryne,
Quhais ordinance, war langsum to defyne.
On this manner, scho passing throw the town.
Should have resauit money benisoun,
Of Virginis, and of lusty burges wylffis,
Quhilk should have been, ane sycht celestial.
Viue la Royne, cryand for their lyiffis,
With ane Harmonious sound Angelical,
In euerilk corner, myrthis Musical,
Bot thou tyrane, in quhome is found no grace,
Our Alleluya, hes turnit in allace.
Thou should have hard, the ornate Oratouris,
Makand her hienes Salutatioun,
Boith of the Clergy, town and counsalouris,
With money Notable Narratioun,
Thou should have seen her Coronatioun,
In the fair Abbay of the Holy rude,
In presence of ane myrthfull multitude.
Sic Banketing, sic aufull Tornamentis,
On horse and fute, that time quhilk should have been,
Sic Chapel Royal, with sic Instrumentis,
And crafty Music, singing from the spleen,
In this country, was never hard nor seen,
Bot all this greit solempnite and gam,
Turnit thou hes, In Requiem aeternam.
Inconstant world, thy freindschip I defy;
Sen strenth, nor wisdom riches nor honor
Vertew nor beauty, none may certefy,
Within thy boundis, for to remane ane hour,
Quhat valith to the king or Empryour,
Sen pryncely puissance, may nocht be exemit,
From Deith, quhose dolor can nocht be expremit.
Sen man in earth, hes na place permanent.
Bot all mon pass, be that horrible port,
Let us pray to the Lord Omnipotent,
That dulefull day, to be our greit comfort,
That in his Realm, we may with him resort,
Quhilkes from ye hell, with his blude ransonit been,
With Magdalene, vmquhyle of scotland Queen.
O Deith, thocht thou the body may deuore
Of every man, it hes thou no puissance,
Of their vertew, for to consume the glore,
As salbe seen, of Magdalene of France,
Vmquhyle our queen, quhom Poetis sal auance
And put her in perpetual memory,
So sail her fame, of the have Victory.
Thocht thou hes slane ye heuinly flour of France
Quhilk Impit was, in to the Chrissill kene,
Quharein all Scotland saw their hail plesance,
And maid the Lyoun reioysit from the spleen,
Thocht rute be pullit from the leuis grent,
The smell of it, sall in dispyte of the,
Keip ay two Realms, in Piece and Amite.
Quod Lindesay.
The Answer quhilk schir David Lindesay maid to ye Kingis Flyting.
REdoutit Roy, our ragment I have red,
Quhilk dois perturb my dull Intendeme^t.
From our flyting, wald God, yt I were fred.
Or ellis sum Tygerris tongue were to me lent.

And rude report, from Venus Court deiectit.
Lusty Ladyis, that our Libellis lukis

Commandand me beir cumpanie to the Cukis,
Moist like ane Devil, they hald me detestable.
They banis me sayand, I am nocht able

Upon our pen, I cry ane loud vengeance,
Were I ane Poeit, I should preis with my pen
To wreik me on our wennemous writing.
Bot I man do, as dog dois in his den,
Fald both my feit, or fle fast from our flyting.
The mekle Devil may nocht endure our dyting.
Quhare for, Cor mundum crea in me, I cry,
Proclamand ow, the Prince of Poetry.
Schir with my Prince, pertenit me nocht to pley.
Bot sen our grace, hes geuin me sic command,
To make answer, it must neidis me obey,
Thocht e be now strange like ane Elephand,
And in till Venus werkis may vaileand,

That e will draw at laiser with our ferris.
Quhat can e say forther, bot I am taileit
In Venus werkis, I grant schir, that is true.
The time hes been, I was better artaileit,
Nor I am now, bot it full fair I rue,
That ever I did Mouth thankles so persew.

And waist it nocht, bot gyf e wit weill quhair.

Quharefore bewar, with dowbling of the bellis,
For money ane dois haist their awin saul knellis.
And specially, quhen that the well gois dry,

That wald nocht of ane Princes ow provide.
Tholand ow rin schutand from schell to schell,
Waistand our corpse, leitand the time ouerslyde
For like ane boisteous Bull, e rin and ride

Ay fukkand like ane furious Fornicatour.
On Ladronis for to loip, e will nocht lat,
Howbeit the Caribaldis cry, the corinoch.
Remember how beside the masking fat,

That feynd with fuffilling of her roistit hoch,

Come rudely rinna^d do^n about our luggis.

Bagsche, directit to Bawte, the Kingis best belouit Dog, and his Companeonis.
Maid at Command of King James the Fyft, be Schit David Lindesay of the Mont
Knycht, Alias, Lyoun king of Arms. etc.
ALlace, quhome to should I complain
In my extreme Necessity.
Or quhameto sall I make my maine,
In Court na Dog will do for me.
Beseikand sum for Cherite
To beir my Supplicatioun,
To Scudlar, Luffra, and Bawte.
Now or the King pas of the town.
I have followit the Court so lang,
Quhill in good faith I may no mair.
The Country knawis I may nocht gang,
I am so crukit, auld, and sair,
That I wait nocht quhare to repair.
For quhen I had authorite,
I thocht me so familiar,
I never dred necessite.
I rue the race that Geordie Steill
Brocht Bawte to the kingis presence.
I pray God lat him never do weill,
Sen syne I gat na audience.
For Bawte now gettis sic credence,
That he lyis on the Kingis nycht goun.
Quhare I perforce for my offense,
Man in the clois ly like ane loun.
For I haif been ay to this hour,
Ane witrear of lamb and hog,
Ane tyrrane, and ane Tuleour,
Ane murdreissar of money ane dog.
Five foullis I chaist outthroch ane scrog,
Quharefor their motheris did me wary.
For they war drownit all in ane bog.
Speir at Ihone Gordoun of Pittarie.
Quhilk in his house did bring me up,
And vsit me to slay the deir.
Sweit milk and meill he gart me sup,
That craft I leirnit sone perqueir.
All other vertew ran arreir,
Quhen I began to bark and flyte.
For their was another Monk nor freir,
Nor wife nor barn, bot I wald byte.
Quhen to the King the care was knawin
Of my unhappy hardines,
And all the suth unto him schawin
How euerilk dog, I did oppres,
Than gave his grace command expres,
I should be brocht to his presence.
Nochtwithstanding my wickitnes,
In Court I gat greit audience.
I schew my greit Ingratitude
To the Capitane of Badzeno,
Quhilk in his house did find me fude
Two eir with other houndis mo.
Bot quhen I saw that it was so,
That I grew hich into the Court,
For his reward I wrocht him woe
And cruelly I did him hurt.
So they that gave me to the King,
I was their mortal Enemy.
I tuke cure of na kind of thing
Bot pleis the Kingis Majesty.
Bot quhen he knew my cruelty,
My falset and my plane oppressioun,
He gave command that I should be
Hangit without confessioun.
And it because that I was auld,
His grace thocht petie for to hang me,
Bot leit me wander quhare I wald,
Than set my fais for to fang me.
And every bouchour dog down dang me.
Quhen I trowit best to be ane lord,
Than in the court ilk wicht did wrang me.
And this I gat for my rewaird.
I had wirreit blak Makesoun,
Were nocht that rebaldis come and red.
Bot he was flemit of the town,
From time the King saw how I bled.
He gart lay me upon ane bed,
For with ane knife I was mischeuit.
This Makesoun for feir he fled
Ane lang time or he was releuit.
And Patrik Striuiling in Ergyle,
I bure him bakwart to the ground.
And had him slane within ane quhyle,
Wat nocht the helping of ane hound.
it gat he money bludie wound,
As it his skyn will schaw the markis,
Find me ane Dog, quhate ever e found
Hes maid sa money bludie sarkis.
Good brother Lanceman, Lyndesayis dog,
Quhilk ay hes keipit thy laute,
And never wirryit lamb nor hog,
Pray Luffra, Scudlar, and Baute,
Of me Bagsche, to have pity,
And provide me ane portioun
In Dumfermeling, quhare I may dre
Penance for my extortioun.
Get be their Solistatioun
Ane letter from the kingis grace,
that I may have Collatioun,
With fire and Candil in the place.
Bot I will leif schort time, allace,
Want I good fresche flesche for my gammis,
Betuix Aswednisday and Paice,

Baute considder weill this bill,
And reid this Cedul^ that I send ow.
And euerilk point thareof fulfill,
And now in time of mys amend ow.

To clym over hie, nor do na wrang.

And tak exemple quhow I gang.

Nor put me forth of my lugeing.
Na dog duist fra my Denner sker me,
Quhen I was tender with the king.
Now euerilk tyke dois me down thring,
The quhilk before, be me war wrangit,
And sweris I serve na other thing,
Bot in ane helter to be hangit.
Thocht e b^ hamelie with the King,

And our exemple make be me,
And belief weill e at bot doggis.

Thocht e have now greit audience,
Se that be ow, be nane oppressed.

From time the king be weill confessed,
Their is na dog that hes transgrest
Throw cruelte, and he may fang him,
His Majesty will tak no rest,
Till on ane gallous he gat hang him.
I was anis als far ben as e ar
And had in Court als greit credence,
And ay pretendit to be hiear.
Bot quhen the Kingis excellence,
Did know my falser and offense,
And my prydefull presumptioun,
I gat none other recompense,
Bot hoyit, and houndit of the town.
Was never sa unkind ane corce
As quhen I had authorite.
Of my freindis I tuke na force,
The quhilkis before had done for me,
This Proverb, it is of verite,
Quhilk I hard red in till ane letter,
Hiest in Court, nixt the weddie,
Without he gyde him all the better.
I tuke na mair count of ane Lord,
Nor I did of ane keiching knaif.
Thocht euerilk day I maid discord,
I was set up abone the laif.
The gentill hound was to me slaif.
And with the Kingis a win fingeris fed.
The silly raichis wald I raif,
Thus for my evil deidis was I dred.
Tharefor Bawte luke best about,
Quhen thou art hiest with the King.
For than thou standis in greitest dout,
Be thou nocht good of governing.
Put na pure tyke from his steiding,
Nor it na silly Ratchis raif.
He sittis above that seis all thing,
And of ane knicht can make ane knaif.
Quhen I come steppand ben the flure,
All Rachis greit room to me red.
I of na creature tuke cure,
Bot lap upon the kingis bev,
With claith of gold, thocht it were spread,
For feir ilk freik wald stand on far.
With euerilk Dog, I was so dred
They trimblit quhen they hard me nar.
Good brother Bawte beir the euin,
Thocht with thy Prince, thou be potent.
It cryis ane vengeance from the heuin,
For till oppres ane Innocent.
In wealth be than most vigilent,
And do na wrang to dog nor beiche,
As I have, quhilk I now repent.
Na Messane reif, to make the rich.
Nor for augmenting of thy boundis
Ask no reward, schit at the king.
Quhilk may do hurt to other houndis,
Expres aganis Goddis bidding.
Chais na pure tyke from his midding,
Throw cast of Court, or kingis requeist.
And of thy self, presume no thing,
Except thou art ane brutall beist.
Traist weill their is none oppressor,
Nor boucheour dog drawer of blude,
Ane Tyrrane, nor ane transgressour,
That sall now of the King get good,
From time forth, that his Celsitude
Dois cleirlie know the verite,
Bot he is flemit for to conclude,
Or hangit hich upon ane tree.
Thocht e be cuplit all to gidder
With silk, and swoulis of silver fine.
Ane Dog may cum forth of Balquhidder,
And gar ow leid ane l^wer tryne.
Than sal our plesour, turn in pyne,
Quhen ane strange hounter blawis his horn.
And all our treddingis gar ow tyne,
Than sall our laubour be forlorn.
I say no more good freindis, adieu,
In dreid we never meit agane.
That ever I kend the Court, I rue.
Was never wycht so will of wane.
Lat no Dog now serve our Souerane,
Without he be of good conditioun.
Be he peruerst, I tell ow plane,
He hes neid of ane good Remissioun.
That I am on this way mischeuit,
The Earl of Hountlie I may wary.
He wend I had been weill releuit,
Quhen to the Court, he gart me carry.
Wald God I wa^ now in Pittarie,
Because I have been so evil dedie,
Adieu, I dar no langer tarry.
In dreid, I waif in till ane wyddie.
FINIS.
Ane Suplication directit from Schir David Lyndesay Knicht, to the Kingis
grace, in Contemptioun of side Taillis.
SChir, thocht our grace hes put great ordour
Both in the Hieland and the Bordour,
it make I Supplicatioun,
Till have sum Reformatioun,
Of ane small fa^t, quhilk is nocht Tressoun.
Thocht it be contrary to Ressoun.
Because the Water been so vile,
It may nocht have ane Oruate ^yle.
Quharefor I pray our Excellence,
To heir me with greit Patience,
Of stink and weidis maculate
No man may make ane Rois Chaiplat.
Souerane, I mean of their side taillis,
Qu^ilk throw the dust and dubbis traillis,
Th^e quarteris lang behind their heillis,
Expres agane all Comoun weillis.
Thocht Bischoppis in their pontificallis,
Have men for to bei^ up their taillis,
For dignite of their office.
Rychtso ane Queen, or ane Empress,
Howbeit they use sic grauite,
Comformand to their Majesty.
Thocht their Rob Royallis be vpborne,
I think it is ane verray scorn,
That every Lady of the land,
Should have her taill so side trailland,
Howbeit they been of hie estait,
The Queen they should nocht counterfeit.
Quhare ever they go, it may be seen,
How kirk, and calsay they soup clean.
The Imagis in to the kirk,
May think of their side tailis Irk,
For quhen the wedder been most fair,
The dust fleis hiest in the air,
And all their facis dois begarie.
Give they culd speik, they wald them wary.
To se I think ane plesand sicht,
Of Italy the Ladyis bricht,
In their clething most triumphand,
Above all other christin land.
it quhen they travel throw the townis,
Men seis their feit beneth their gownis,
Four Inche abone their proper heillis
Circulat about als round as quheillis.
Quhare throw their dois na poulder ryis,
Their fait quhyte lymmis to suppryis.
Bot I think may abusioun,
To se men of Religioun,
Gar beir their taillis throw the streit,
That folkis may behald their feit.
I trow sanct Bernard, nor sanct Blais,
Gart never man beir up their clais.
Peter, nor Paul, nor sanct Androw,
Gart never beir up their taillis I trow,
Bot I lauch best to se ane Nwn,
Gar beit her taill abone her bwn,
For no thing ellis as I suppois,
Bot for to schaw her lilly quhyte hois.
In all their Rewlis, they will nocht find,
Quha should beir up their taillis behind.
Bot I have may in to despyte,
Pure Claggokis cled in roiploch quhyte,
Quhilk hes skant two markis for their feis,
Will have two ellis beneth their kneis.
Kit, tok that clekkit wis istrene,
The morn will counterfute the Queen.
Ane murcland Meg that mylkit the owis,
Claggit with clay abone the howis,
In barn, nor byit, scho will nocht bide,
Without her kirtyll taill be side,
In Burtowis wantoun burges wyiffis,
Quha may have sydest taillis stryiffis,
Weill bordourit with Veluoit fine,
Bot following them it is ane pyne.
In Somer quhen the streitis dryis,
They raise the dust abone the skyis.
None may go neir them at their eis,
Without they cover mouth and neis,
From the powder, to keip their ene.
Consider give their Cloiffis be clean.
Betuixt their cleuing, and their kneis,
Quha mycht behald their sweitie these,
Begairit all with dirt, and dust,
That were a^euch to stanche the lust
Of any man that saw them naikit.
I think sic giglottis ar bot glaikit,
Without profit to have sic pride,
Harland their claggit taillis so side.
I wald they borrowstounis barnis had breikkis
To keip sic mist fra Malkinnis cheikkis.
I dreid rouch Malkin de for drouth,
Quhen sic dry dust blawis in her mouth.
I think may pane, after ane rane,
To se them towkit up agane.
Than quhen they step forth throw the streit.
Their faldingis flappis about their feit.
Their laithlie lyning furthwart flypit,
Quhilk hes the muk, and midding wypit.
They waist more claith within few eitis.
Nor wald cleith fyftie score of freitis.
Quhen Marioun from the midding gois,
From her morn turn, scho strypit the nois.
And all the day quhare ever scho go,
Sic liquour scho likkith up also.
The Turcumis of her taill I trow.
Mycht be ane supper till ane sow.
I ken ane man, quhilk swoir greit aithis.
How he did lift ane Kittokis claithis,
And wald have done, I wait nocht quhat.
Bot sone remeid of lufe he gat.
He thocht na schame to make it wittin,
How her side taill was all beschittin,
Of filth sic flewer straik till his heart,
That he behouit for till depart.
(Quod scho) sweit schir, me think e rue,
(Quod he) our taill makis sic ane slew,
That be sanct Brybe, I may nocht bide it,
e war nocht wise, that wald nocht hyde it,
Of Caillis I will no more Indyte,
For dreid sum Duddroun me despyte.
Nocht withstanding, I will conclude,
That of side Taillis can cum na good.
Syder nor may their hanclethis hyde,
The remanent, proceidis of pride.
And Pride proceidis of the Devil.
Thus always they proceid of evil.
Ane other fault Schir, may be seen,
They hyde their face all bot the ene.
Quhen gentill men biddis them good day,
Without Reverence they slide away.
That none may know, I ow assure,
Ane honest woman be ane hure.
Without their naikit face I se,
They get no mo good dayis of me
Hails ane Frence Lady quhen e pleis,
Scho will discover mouth, and neis.
And with ane humill countenance,
With Visage bair make reverence.
Quhen our Ladyis dois ride in rane,
Should no man have them at disdane,
Thocht they be couerit mouth and neis.
In that case they will nane displeis.
Nor quhen they go to quiet places,
I them excuse to hyde their facis,
Quhen they wald make Collatioun,
With any lusty Companeoun,
Thocht they be hid than to the ene,
e may considder quhat I mean.
Bot in the kirk, and market placis,
I think they should nocht hide their facis.
Without their faltis be sone amendit,
My flyting, schir, sall never be endit.
Bot wald our grace my counsall tak,
Ane Proclamatioun e should make,
Both throw the land and Borrowstounis,
To schaw their face, and cut their gownis,
Nan^ should fra that Exemptit be,
Except the Quenis Majesty,
Because this matter is nocht fair,
Of Rethorik it man be bair.
Women will say this is no bourdis,
To write sic vile and filthy wordis.
Bot wald they clenge their filthy taillis,
Quhilk ouir the myris and middingis traillis,
Than should my wrytting clengit be.
None other mendis they get of me.
The suith should nocht be haldin clos,
Veritas non querit Angulos.
I wait good women that been wise,
This rural Ryme will nocht dispryse.
None will me blame, I ow assure,
Except ane wantoun glorious hure,
Quhais flyting I feir nocht ane fle.
Fair weill, e get no more of me.
Quod Lindesay in contempt of the side taillis,

Kitteis confessioun, Compylit (as is beleuit) be Schir David Lindesay of the
Mont Knicht. etc. The Curate, and Kitte.
THe Curate Kitte culd Confess,
And scho tald on both mair and less.
Quhen scho was telland as scho wist,
The Curate Kitte wald have kissed.
Bot it ane countenance he bute,
Degeist, deuote, daine, and demure.
And syne began her to exempne,
He was best at the after game.
(Quod he) have e na wrangous geir?
(Quod scho) I staw ane Pek of veir.
(Quod he) that should restorit be,
Tharefore deliver it to me.
Tibbe and Peter bad me speir,
Be my conscience they sall it heir.
(Quod he) leave e in lechery?
(Quod scho) Will Leno mowit me.
(Quod he) his wife that sall I tell,
To make her acquentance with my sell.
(Quod he) ken e na Heresy?
I wait nocht quhat that is (quod scho)
(Quod he) hard e na Inglis Bukis?
(Quod scho) my Master on them lukis.
(Quod he) the Bischop that sall know,
For I am sworn that for to schaw.
(Quod he) quhat said he of the King?
(Quod scho) of good he spak na thing.
(Quod he) his grace of that sall wit,
And he sall lose his life for it.
Quhen scho in mind did mair reuolue,
(Quod he) I can nocht ow absolve,
Bot to my Chalmer cum at euin,
Absoluit for to be and schreuin.
(Quod scho) I will pas till ane other.
And I met with schir Andro my brother.
And he full clenelie did me schryue,
Bot he was sumthing talkatyue.
He speirit money strange case,
Quhow that my lufe did me Inbrace.
Quhat day, how often, quhat scort, and quhare?
(Quod he) I wald I had been their.
He me absoluit for ane plak,
Thocht he na price with me wald make.
And mekle Latyne he did mummill.
I hard na thing bot hummill bummill.
He schew me nocht of Goddis word,
Quhilk scharper is than any sword,
And deip in till our heart dois prent,
Our Syn, quhairthrow we do repent.
He pat me na thing in to feir,
Quharethrow I should my syn forbeir.
He schew me nocht the Maledictioun
Of God for Syn, nor the afflictioun.
And in this life, the greit mischief,
Ordanit to punische hure, and theif.
Nor schew he me of hellis pane,
That I mycht feir, and vice refrane.
He counsalit me nocht till abstene,
And leid ane holy life and clean.
Of Christis blude, na thing he knew,
Nor of his promises full true,
That saifis all that will believe,
That Satan sall us never grieve.
He techit me nocht for till traist,
The confort of the haly Gaist,
He bad me nocht to Christ be kind,
To keip his law, with heart and mind,
And love and thank his greit mercy.
Fra Syn, and hell, that sauit me.
And lufe my Nichtbour as my sell.
Of this na thing he could me tell.
Bot gave me penance ilk ane day,
Ane Aue Marie for to say.
And Frydayis five, na fische to eit.
Bot butter and eggis ar better meit.
And with ane plak to by ane Mess,
Fra drounkin schir Iohne latynelesse.
(Quod he) ane plak I will gar Sand
Give the agane with hand dande.
Syne in to Pilgramage to pas,
The verray way to wantounes.
Of all his penance I was glaid,
I had them all parqueir, I said.
To mow and steill, I ken the price.
I sall it set on Cincq and Syee.
Bot he my counsale culd nocht keip.
He maid him be the fire to sleip.

Dame keip the keis of our woll loft.
Throw drink and sleip maid him to raif,
And swa with us they play the knaif.
Freiris sweiris be their professioun,
Nane can be saif, but this Confessioun,
And gartis all men understand,
That it is Goddis awin command.
it is it nocht bot mennis drame,
The people to confound and schame.
It is nocht ellis bot mennis law,
Maid mennis myndis for to know.
Quharethrow they syle them as they will,
And makis their law conform their till,
Sittand in mennis conscience,
Above Goddis Magnificence.
And dois the people teiche and tyste,
To serve the Paip the Antechriste.
To the greit God Omnipotent
Confess thy Syn, and sore repent.
And traist in Christ, as wrytis Paul,
Quhilk sched his blude to saif thy Saul.
For nane can the absolve bot he,
Nor tak away thy syn from the.
Give of good counsall thou hes neid,
Or hes nocht lernit weill thy Creid,
Or wickit vicis regne in the,
The quhilk thou can nocht mortify.
Or be in Desperatioun,
And wald have Consolatioun,
Than till ane preichour true thou pas,
And schaw thy Syn, and thy trespass.
Thou nedis nocht to schaw him all,
Nor tell thy Syn both greit and small,
Quhilk is impossible to be.
Bot schaw the vice that troubillis the.
And he sall of thy saul have reuth,
And the Instruct in to the treuth,
And with the word of verite,
Sall confort, and sall counsall the.
The Sacramentis schaw the at lenth,
Thy little faith to stark and strenth.
And how thou should them richtlie use,
And all Hypocrisy refuse.
Confessioun first was ordanit fre,
In this sort, in the Kirk to be.
Swa to confess as I descryue,
Was in the good Kirk Primityue.
Swa was Confessioun ordanit first,
Thocht Codrus kyte should cleue and birst.

The Iusting betuix James Watsoun, and Ibone Harbor, Seruitoutis to King James

IN Sanctandrois on Witsoun Monnunday,
Two Campionis their manheid did assay,
Past to the Bars Enar^^t heid and handis,
Was never seen sic Iusting in no landis,
In presence of the Kingis grace and Queen,
Quhare money lusty Lady mycht be seen.
Money ane Knicht, Burroun, and bautent,
Come for to se that aufull Tornament.
The ane of them was gentill James Watsoun,
And Iohne Harbor the other Campioun,
Unto the King they war familiaris,
And of his Chalmer boith Cubicularis.
James was ane man of greit Intelligence,
Ane Medtcinar, full of Experience.
And Iohne Harbor, he was ane nobill Leche.
Crukit Carlingis be wald gar them get speech.
From time they enterit war in to the field.
Full womanly they weildit speir and scheild,
And wichtlie waiffit in the wynd their heillis,
Ho^land like ^a^geris rydand on their creillis.
Bot ather can ^t other with sic haist,
That they could never their speir get in the reist.
Quhe^ gentil James trowit best with Iohne to meit
His speir did fald amang his horssis feit.
I am rycht sure good James had been undone,
War not that Iohne his mark tuke be the moon.
(Quod Iohne) howbeit you thinkis my leggis like rokkis.
My speit is good, now keip ye fra my knokkis.

The feind ane thing I can se bot the list.
For more can I (quod Iohne) be goddis breid,

Defend the man. Than ran they to lyk ra^mis,
At that rude riuk James had been strykin down,
Were not that Iohne for feirsnes fell in swoun.
And tycht so James to Iohne had dane great deir.
Were not amangis his horse feit he brak his speir.

And with that s^raik he trowit that John was flane

Be this good Iohne had gottin forth his swerd,
And ran to James with money aufull word.
My furiousnes for (...) now sall thou find

Tha^ gentill James began to crak greit wordis,

With gluifis of plait they dung at vtheris facis,
Quha wan this field, no e^cature could hen,
