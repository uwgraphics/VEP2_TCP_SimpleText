Here begins a merry geste of the friar and the boy.
a friar and a shepherd

GOd that dyed for us all
And drank both eysell and gall
Bring us out of bale
And give them good life and long
That lysteneth to my song
Or tends to my tale
There dwelled an husbonde in my country
That had wives three.
By process of time
By the first wife a sone he had
That was a good sturdy ladde
And an happy hyne
His fader loved him well
So did his mother never a dele
I tell you as I think
All she thought was lost by the rode
That did the little boy any good
Other mete or drink
And yet ywys it was but badde
And thereof not half enough he had
But evermore of the worste
Therefore evil mote she fare
For ever she did the little boy care
As ferforth as she dorste
The good wife to her husbonde began say
I would ye would put this boy away
And that right soon in haste
Truly he is a cursed ladde
I would some other man him had
That would him better chaste
Than said the good man again
Dame I shall to the said
He is but tender of aege
He shall abide with me this year
Till he be more strongere
For to win better wage
We have a man a stout freke
That in the field keeps our nete
Slepynge all the day
He shall come home so god me shield
And the boy shall in to the field
To keep our beestes if he may
Than said the wife verament
Thereto soon I assent
For that me thinks most nedy
On the morrow when it was day
The little boy went on his way
To the field full ready
Of no man he had no care
But sange hey how away the mare
And made Joy enough
Forth he went truly to said
Till he came to the plain
His dinner forth he drough
When he saw it was but bad
Full little lust thereto he had
But put it up again
Therefore he was not to wit
He said he would ete but lyte
Till night that he came home
And as the boy sat on a hill
An old man came him till
Walking by the way
Sone he said god these
Sir welcome more ye be
The little boy began say
The old man said I am an hongred sore
Have thou any mete in store
That thou may give me
The child said so god me save
To such vytayle as I have
Welcome shall ye be
Thereof the old man was glad
The boy drew forth such as he had
And said do gladly
The old man was easy to please
He ete and made him well at ease
And said sone gramercy
Sone thou have given mete to me
I shall the give things three
Thou shalt them never forgete
Than said the boy as I trow
It is best that I have a bow
Birds for to shote
A bow sone I shall the give
That shall last the all thy live
And ever a like mete
Shote therein when thou good think
For if thou shote and wynke
The prycke thou shalt hytte
When he the bow in hand felt
And the boltes under his belte
Loud than he lough
He said now had I a pype
Though it were never so lyte
Than were I glad enough
A pype sone thou shalt have also
In true musyke it shall go
I do the well to wit
All that may the pype here
Shall not themself stere
But laugh and lepe about
What shall the third be
For I will give the gifts three
As I haue-sayd to the before
The little boy on him lough
And said sir I have enough
I will desire no more
The old man said my troth I plyght
Thou shalt have that I the hight
Say on now and let me se
Than said the boy anon
I have a stepdame at home
She is a shrewe to me
When my fader gives me mete
She would thereon that I were cheke
And stareth me in the face
When she looks on me so
I would she should let a rappe go
That it might ring over all the place
Than said the old man tho
When she looks on the so
She shall begin to blow
All that ever it may here
Shall not themself stere
But laugh on a row
Fare well quod the old man
God keep the said the child than
I take my leave at the
God that most best may
Keep the both night and day
Gramercy sone said he
Than drew it toward the night
Jack him hyed home full right
It was his ordinance
He took his pype and began to blow
All his beestes on a row
About him they dance
Thus went he pypynge through the town
His beestes him followed by the sown
In to his faders close
He went and put them up echone
Homewarde he went anon
In to his faders hall he gose
His fader at his souper sat
Little Jack espied well that
And said to him anon
Fader I have kept your nete
I pray you give me some mete
I am an hongred by saint Ihone
I have sytten metelesse
All this day keeping your beestes
My dinner feeble it was
His fader took a capons wynge
And at the boy he began it slynge
And badde him ete a pace
That grieved his stepmoders heart sore
As I told you before
She stared him in the face
With that she let go a blaste
That they in the hall were agaste
It range over all the place
All they laughed and had good game
The wife waxed reed for shame
She would that she had been gone
Quod the boy well I wot
That gonne was well shote
As it had been a stone
Cursedly she looked on him tho
An other blaste she let go
She was almoost rent
Quod the boy will ye se
How my dame lets pellettes fle
In faith or ever she stynte
The boy said unto his dame
Tempre thy bombe he said for shame
She was full of sorrow
Dame said the good man go thy way
For I swear to the by my faye
Thy gere is not to borowe
Afterward as ye shall here
To the house there came a friar
To lie there all night
The wife loved him as a saint
And to him made her complaynt
And told him aryght
We have a boy within ywys
A shrewe for the nones he is
He does me much care
I dare not look him upon
I am ashamed by saint John^
To tell you how I fare
I pray you mete the boy to morrow
Beat him well and give him sorrow
And make the boy lame
Quod the friar I shall him beat
Quod the wife do not forgete
He does me much shame
I trow the boy be some wytche
Quod the friar I shall him teache
Have thou no care
I shall him teache if I may
Quod the wife I the pray
Do him not spare
On the morrow the boy arose
In to the field soon he gose
His beestes for to drive
The friar ran out at the gate
He was afterde leest he came to late
He ran fast and blyue
When he came upon a land
Little Jack there he foude
Dryuynge his beestes all alone
Boy he said god give the shame
What have thou done to thy dame
Tell thou me anon
But if thou can excuse the well
By my troth beat I the will
I will no longer abide
Quod the boy what eyleth the
My dame fares as well as ye
What needs the to chyde
Quod the boy will ye wete
How I can a bird shete
And other thing withal
Sir he said though I be lyte
Yonder bird will I smite
And give her the I shall
There sat a bird upon a brere
Shote on boy quod the friar
For that me lysteth to se
He hytte the bird on the heed
That she fell down deed
No ferder might she flee
The friar to the busshe went
Up the bird for to hente
He thought it best for to done
Jack soke his pype and began to blow
Than the friar as I trow
Began to dance soon
As soon as he the pype herd
Like a wood man he fared
He lepte and daunced about
The breres scratched him in the face
And in many an other place
That the blood brast out
And tare his clothes by and by
His cope and his scapelary
And all his other wede
He daunced among thorns thycke
In many places they did him prycke
That fast began he blede
Jack pyped and laughed among
The friar among the thorns was thronge
He hopped wonders hye
At the last he held up his hand
And said I have daunced to long
That I am like to dye
Gentle Jack hold thy pype still
And my troth I plyght the till
I will do the no woo
Jack said in that tide
Friar skyppe out on the ferder side
Lightly that thou were goo
The friar out of the busshe went
All to ragged and to rent
And torn on every side
Uneaths on him had one cloute
His hely for to wrappe about
His harneys for to hyde
The breres had him scratched so in the face
And many an other place
He was all to bledde with blood
All that might the friar se
Were feign away to flee
They wend he had been wode
When he came to his host
Of his Journey he made no boost
His clothes were rent all
Much sorrow in his heart he had
And every man him dradde
When he came in to the hall
The wife said where have thou been
In an evil place I wene
Me thinks by thyn array
Dame I have been with thy sone
The devil of hell him overcome
For no man else may
With that came in the good man
The wife said to him than
Here is a foul array
Thy sone that is the lefe and dear
Has almoost slain this holy friar
Alas and welawaye
The good man said benedicite
What has the boy done friar to the
Tell me without let
The friar said the devil him speed
He has made me dau^ce maugre my head
Among the thorns hey go bette
The good man said to him tho
Had thou lost thy life so
It had been great sin
The friar said by our lady
The pype went so meryly
That I could never blynne
When it drew toward the night
The boy came home full right
As he was wont to do
When he came in to the hall
His fader did him soon call
And badde him to come him to
Boy he said tell me here
What have thou done to the friar
Tell me without lesynge
Fader he said by my faye
I did naught else as I you say
But pyped him a spring
That said his fader would I here
Mary god forbede said the friar
His hands he did wrynge
Yes said the good man by gods grace
Than said the friar out alas
And made great mourning
For the love of god quod the friar
If ye will that he pype here
Bind me to a post
For I know none other read
And I dance I am but deed
Well I wot my life is lost
Strong ropes they soke in hand
The friar to the post they bond
In the myddle of the hall
All that at the souper sat
Laughed and had good game thereat
And said the friar would not fall
Than said the good man
Pype on good sone
Hardely when thou will
Fader he said so mote I the
Have ye shall enough of gle
Till ye bydde me be still
As soon as Jack the pype hent
All that there were verament
Began to dance and lepe
When they began the pype here
They might not themself ftere
But hurled on an hepe
The good man was in no dyspayre
But lightly lepte out of his chair
With a good chere
Some lepte over the stock
Some stombled at the block
And some fell flat in the fire
The good man had great game
How they daunced all in same
The wife after began step
Evermore the kest her eye at Jack
And fast her tail began to crack
Loud than they could speak
The friar himself was almoost lost
For knocking his heed against the post
He had none other grace
The rope rubbed hy^ under the chynne
That the blood down did rynne
In many a diverse place
Jack ran in to the street
After him fast did they lepe
Truly they could not stynte
They went out ar the door so thycke
That each man fell on others neck
So pretely out they went
Neighbors that were fast by
Herd the pype go so meryly
They ran in to the gate
Some lepte over the hatche
They had no time to draw the latche
They wend they had come to late
Some lay in their bed
And held up their head
Anon they were waked
Some sterte in the way
Truly as I you say
Stark belly naked
By that they were gadred about
Iwys there was a great route
Dauncynge in the street
Some were lame and might not go
But yet ywys they daunced to
On hands and on fete
They boy said now will I rest
Quod the good man I hold it best
With a merry chere
Sease sone when thou will
In faith this is the meryest fytte
That I herd this seven year
They daunced all in same
Some laughed and had good game
And some had many a fall
Thou cursed boy quod the friar
Here I somon the that thou appear
Before the offycyall
Look thou be there on frydaye
I will the mete and I may
For to ordeyne the sorrow
The boy said by god auowe
Friar I am as ready as thou
And frydaye were to morrow
Frydaye came as ye may here
Iackes stepdame and the friar
Together there they meter
Folk gadered a great pase
To here every man's case
The offycyall was set
There was much to do
Matters more than one or two
Both with priest and clerk
Some had testamentes for to preue
And fair women by your leave
That had strokes in the derke
Every man put forth his case
Than came forth friar Topyas
And Iackes stepdame also
Sir offycyall said he
I have brought a boy to the
Which has wrought me much woe
He is a great nygromancere
In all orlyaunce is not his pere
As by my troth I trow
He is a wytche quod the wife
Than as I shall tell you blythe
Loud could she blow
Some laughed without fail
Some said dame tempre thy tail
Ye wreste it all amysse
Dame quod the offycyall
Tell forth on thy tale
Let not for this
The wife was afraid of another crack
That no word more she spacke
She durst not for dread
The friar said so mote I the
Knave this is long of the
That evil mote thou speed
The friar said sir offycyall
The boy will combre us all
But if ye may him chaste
Sir he has a pype truly
Will make you dance and lepe on hye
Till your heart braste
The offycyall said so mote I the
That pype would I feign se
And know what mirth that he can make
Mary god forbede than said the friar
That he should pype here
Before that I hens the way take
Pype on Jack said the offycyall
I will here now how thou can play
Jack blewe up the sothe to faye
And made them soon to dance all
The offycyall lepte over the deske
And daunced about wonder fast
Till both his shynnes he all to breast
Him thought it was not of the best
Than cried he unto the child
To pype no more within this place
But to hold still for gods grace
And for the love of mary mylde
Than said Jack to them echone
If ye would me grant with heart fre
That he shall do me no vylany
But hens to depart even as I come
Thereto they answered all anon
And promised him anon right
In his quarrel for to fight
And defend him from his fone
Thus they departed in that tide
The offycyall and the sompnere
His stepdame and the friar
With great Joy and much pride
Thus ends the friar and ye boy.
