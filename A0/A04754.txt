by warrant from the Justice of Peace convicting, and within 3 days to be sold,
3. Car. 3.

Where there is no sufficient distress or non payment, within six days after

oversight of the Sheriffs. 11. Hen. 7. cap. 15.

Estreats of amerciaments must be by Indenture between the two Justices

No amerciament for default of appearance when the Sessions are not summoned by
precept. Lam. 381. or when the summons is at one place, and kept at another.

Or when the Sessions were the same time at two places, and the party appeared
at one of them. 384.

One Justice of Peace cannot amerce his fellow for absence from the Sessions;
but a Justice of Assize may amerce a Justice of Peace for his absence from the
Goale-deliverie. Lam. 385.

Clerk of the Peace, Coronours, Sheriffs, Bayliffes of Franchises, Constables
of Hundreds, may be amerced for default of appearance at Sessions. Lam. 395.

Amerciaments of Jurours for concealment, vide Jurours. Lam. 400, 401.

Appearance.
Recognizance taken for the Peace against all the Kings people, and to appear
at the next Sessions by Supersedeas out of the Chancerie, testifying surety

Upon complaint of an apprentice one Justice may take order betwixt his master
and him, and for want of conformity in the master, may bind him to appear at
the Quarter Sessions. Dal. 59. and to be discharged by four Justices. If
default be in the apprentice, it seems one Justice may send him to the house
of correction. Dal. 60.

Assent of two Justices is sufficient to the Churchwardens or overseers, or the
most of them, to bind as apprentices the sons of poor parents till 24
years of age, or their daughters till 21 years of age. 39 Elis. 3. Lam. 327.
43 Elis. 2. Dal. 63. Lam. 331.

Disposition of money given for putting forth apprentices, and the nomination
and placing of them must be by corporation, and in towns not corporate by the
Parson or Vicar, Constable, Churchwarden and Overseers for the time being, or
most part of them, the same to be according to the will of the giver: And any
of the disposers forbearing and refusing to dispose of the money, whereby it is
not disposed, shall lose 3 pounds 6 shillings 8 pence, one moytie to the poor
of the parish, the other to the informer. 7. Jac. 3.

Disposers of such money given for apprentices, are to take bond with two

Force.
Force is twofold.

Every trespass in judgment of law is a force, and the action may be, Quare
vi and armis. Dal. 166. Lam. 141.

That which is properly force is either Manu forti, or Multitudine.


Manu forti is violence offered to the person of another by deed or word. Dal.
166.

By deed, as actual violence, or to be furnished with offensive weapons not
usually born. ibid.

Any thing which a man takes in his hand to throw it at another, may be said
to be armor. Cro. 74. b.

Multitudine, when there be two or three in a company, or more. Dal. 167.

Forcible entry.
Forcible entry must be an actual entry. Dal. 168

If one or more come weaponed, especially with weapons unusually worn, and
violently enter into an house or land. Dal. 167. Lam. 134, 135, 145, 147

Much more being entered, if he or they offer violence, or fear of harm to any
in possession, or drive any out of possession. Dal. ibid. Lam. 142.

167. Lam. 146.

To enter peaceably with weapons not usually born by them to house open or

A trespass made manu forti, or cum multitudine though it be but to cut or
take away another man's corn, grass, or goods, or fell or crop wood, or to do
any other trespass, though the party be not put out of possession, yet it
seems forcible entry punishable by the statutes: but otherwise if the entry
be peaceable, yet it is disseising with force. Dal. 167, 168. Lam. 133, 143,
145.

To enter peaceably, and after entry, by force or violence to cut corn, grass,
wood, etc. or carry away another goods, is force. Dal. 168. Cro. 70.

To distrain for rent due or not due with force, does countervail a force. Dal.
ibid. Lam. 144

Diverse enter where the entry is not lawful, and all save one demean
themselves peaceably, and one only enters with force, or after entry uses
force, it is forcible entry in all. Dal. 172. Cro. 22. a. 24. b. 34. b. Lam.
143.

In all these cases of trespass, only the Justice of Peace may, as it
seems, remove the force, and upon view imprison and fine.

Forcible entry by words.
To enter peaceably, and then to offer by threatening to kill the dissesse if he
reenter. Dal. 168.

To enter by fair means, his entry being lawful, and persuade them within to
come out, and the door being open, or shut by the latch, to enter without
combating, or offensive weapons, or other violence. Dal. 168.

To enter peaceably and quietly, getting other out, and quietly to hold it.
Dal. ibid.

To enter peaceably into a house, and finding armor or weapons, not to remove
them. Lam. 145.

To take a man being out of his house, and imprison him, and in the mean time
to send another peaceably to enter, is no force. Dal. 169. Lam. 146

He that only agrees to a forcible entry made to his use.

Forcible detainer.
Forcible detainer is of lands and tenements, not of the person. Dal. 169. Lam.
137, 146.

If entry be peaceable, and the detainer forcible, it is punishable, except
quiet possession had been had for three years. Dal. ibid.

To deny a Justice of Peace to enter (upon supposure of a forcible detainer) is
forcible detainer, though it be but by one person and no weapons showed. Dal.
169. Lamb. Cro. 70. b. P. R. 4. 1. Lamb. 145.

If the Justice enter and finds any arrived, or any armor or unusual
weapons lying by them, or find more then the ordinary family. Dal. ibid. Lamb.

Dal. 170, 171.

What is forcible detainer by word.
To enter peaceably, and after to threaten to kill the disseiser if he come
again. Dal. 170. Lamb.

It seems to amount to a forcible detainer to threaten to maym him, beat, or
do bodily hurt to the disseised if he come again, Dal. ibid. for that death may
ensue upon such beating or hurt.

What is not forcible detainer.
One enters peaceably into a house, and finding armor or weapons, does not
remove them. L. 145.

To threaten to burn his house or spoil his goods, to deny to open the doors,
to deny to go out. Dal. 170.

What is forcible detainer of rent.
The tenant resists so forcibly, that the owner cannot distrain for his rent,
nor use his common of pasture. Dal. 171.

The tenant forestalleth the way by force and arms, or threatens him that
has the rent or common, that he dares not distrain or use his common. ibid.

The tenant makes rescous of the distress with force and arms.

In these cases of rent or common, the Justice may remove the force, record it
upon new, imprison and fine, but can award no restitution.

Forcible entry.
What persons may make a force.
One alone, if it be with offensive weapons or turbulent behavior to the
affray of others. Dal. 166, 167, 171. Lamb. 143.

under 18.

A feme covert may by her own act make a forcible entry or detainer, and she
may be imprisoned and fined, but the fine cannot be levied on the husband ibid.

Consent.
If one command or counsel others to a force, and be present, though he do
nothing, he is a principal, Dal. 172. but if absent, a disseiser.

Diverse enter, one only commits force, all are guilty ibid.

Who cannot be put out.
The King cannot be disseised, therefore an enditement upon the statute, 8. H.
6. for the K. is not good, neither can the Kings farmer prefer a bill of
enditement upon the said statute, but must have an information in the
Exchequer. Dal. 172. Cro. 69. a.

Where one may hold with force.
Where one has peaceably entered, and after continued in quiet possession
without interruption for 3 years together, Lamb. Dal. 178. and may hire
strangers to maintain his possession, and have his company in armor, Dal. 179.
Cro. 71. but he may not resist the Justice of Peace that comes to view.

Upon enditement of forcible holding the plea 3 years, lawful possession next
before avoideth imprisonment, fine, and restitution. Dal. 179.

But it holds not,

1 If the entry were forcible, though the holding peaceable.

2 If the holding were forcible, though the entry peaceable.

3 If a disseiser have continued peaceable 3 years. Quaere if he shall be
helped by 8. H. 6. or, 31. El. If a disseiser have forcibly continued his
possession 20 years, he may be endited upon 8. H. 6. and the Justice may make
restitution. Cro. 71. a.

4 If the possession of 3 years have been interrupted. Dal. 173, 180. Cro. 71.
a. Lamb.

A disseiser quietly holds 3 years, and after the disseiser enters or
makes claym, the disseiser reentring cannot hold with force, for he is in upon
a new disseising. Dal. 180.

A lawful possessour, after 20 years possession is acted, he can neither
reenter nor hold with force. ibid.

What force is lawful.
Force used by the Kings Officers for the due execution or advancement of
justice, or of the judgment of the law: as,

1 To pursue, apprehend, and carry to prison offenders in treason, felony, or
other great crimes.

2 A Sheriff or his officers to apprehend by virtue of the Kings writ.

3 A Justice removing unlawful entries or holding of possessions, and
repressing riotters. Dal. 176.

4 Justice, Sheriff, Constables, or Coroners, may use force in apprehending or
imprisoning such as in their presence attempt to disturb or break the peace.

5 It is lawful by force to break open doors, to arrest offenders within, if
the officer cannot otherwise enter.

Note that the officer is first to signify the cause of his coming, before he
attempt to break open the doors, 5. Dal. 177. as

First, for treason, felony, or suspicion of felony. Cro. 170. b.

2 Where one has dangerously wounded another. Cro. 131. a.

3 An affray being in the house. Cro. 146. b.

4 Upon a forcible entry or detainer found by inquisition. Dal. 176.

5 Upon a capias ut legatum in personal action, or capias pro fine directed to
the Sheriff. Cro. 170. b.

6 Upon warrant or process for attaching a Popish recusant excommunicate. 3.
Jac. 4.

7 Upon a warrant for the peace or good behavior. Dal. 176, 177. but Crom.
176. b. makes Quaere.

8 Upon recovery in a real action or ejectione firma, but not to execute the
Kings process upon the body or goods of any person at the suit of any subject.
Dal. 177.

9 In all cases where the King is party. ibid.

1 Forcible defense is lawful for every man to keep his house to himself, his
family and goods, as his castle, as well for defense against injury, as for his
repose. Vide plus Houses.

2 In defense of husband, wife, father, mother, or master.

3 Father or mother in defense of the child within age. Dal. 151.

4 In defense of my goods or my land. Dal. ibid.

In these cases he that attempteth may be disturbed; and if he attempt to
assault or lame me, I may beat him again, as well in defense of my person as
possessions, but not kill him. 152.

What Justices of Peace are to do in forcible entry or detainer.
Every Justice upon complaint or notice given, ought at the cost of the party
grieved, to do execution: viz.

1 He must go to the place. Dal. 41. Lamb.

2 Take sufficient power of the county or of the Town, and the Sheriff also,
if need be, as well to arrest offenders, as also for removing of the force, and
for conveying them to the goal. Dal. ibid. Lam.

3. Arrest and remove all offenders, and take their weapons, and prize them for
the King. Dal. ibid.

If the doors be shut, and entrance denied, he may break open the house. Dal.
42. Quaere.

The Justice cannot arrest or remove them if he find no force, except by
enquitie. Dal. 42.

The Justice ought to make a record of the force, and either keep it by him or
indent it, and certify one part either into the Kings Bench, or to the Clerk
of the Peace, and keep the other. Dal. 42.

The record of the Justice is a sufficient conviction of the offender, and is
not traversable. ibid.

The Justice ought to commit immediately to the next goal, those which he
finds continuing the force, until they pay their fine, ibid. and 91. or
forfeit an ^00 pounds. ibid.

But such force must be in the presence or view of the Justice.

The Justices or some of them that see the force, are the proper Judges of that
offense, and may assesse the fine, but it must be upon every one severally,
Dal. 91. and is to be estreated into the Exchequer; upon which assessing and
estreating the party is to be delivered. Dal. 43.

And so upon payment of the fine to the Justice, or recognizance for payment.
Dal. 43.

Quaere, for the Sheriff is accountable for all fines.

Or the Justice may record the force, commit the offenders, and certify the
record to the J. of Assize or to the Sessions, and there the offenders fined.
Dal. 43. Cro. 161. a.

But ought more properly to be assessed by them that record the force, Dal. 91.
Cro. ibid. and to be of value.

Or the Justice may certify the record into the Kings Bench, refer the fine
thither, Dal. 43. which Lambert thinks the best course.

The fines must be reasonable, secundum quantitatem and qualitatem delicti.

The force ought to be inquired of in some good place or town near where the
force was, Dal. 43. and that within a month if it be a riot. 92. One Justice
may enquire. Dal 43.

Inquiry may be though the offenders be not present, or though the Justice go
not to see the place where the force is. Dal. 43, 44. Lamb. 152.

Without enquiry there can be no restitution. Dal. 44, 183. Cro. 161. b. 164. a.

Upon inquiry making, the Justice must direct his precept to the Sheriff to
summon 24 of 40 shil. a year land per annum. Dal. 182.

Upon default the Justice may award an alias and pluries infinite till they
come.

The Sheriff, at the day of the second precept, must return 40 shill. in
issues upon every one, at the third writ five pound, and at every day after the
double. 8. Hen. 6. 0. 9.

If any jurour have not 40 shill. land, yet the enditement is good for the
King. Quaere if there shall be restitution, Dal. 182. Lam. 152.

Returning of smaller issues then the statute, hinders not the inquiry. Dal.
ibid. Lam. ibid.

Upon enquiry the Justice may make restitution, Dal. 44, 182. wherein the
Justice needs not to examine the title. Dal. 183. Lamb. 156.

A restitution before inquisition, ibid. Cro. 161. 8. 164. ^.

In the enditement not only the entry but also the putting out must be, and
and adhuc extra tenent; Lam. 153. for lack of these words no restitution can be
made. Dal. 44, and 181. Cro. 163. 8. Lam.

The enditement must be good, both in matter and form, Dal. 183. the words
manuforti or cum multitudine are necessary. ibid.

The enditement must express the quality of the thing, whether message,
cottage, etc. tenementum may extend to either, and so entertain. Dal. ibid.

If restitution be made by a Justice upon an insufficient enditement, the Kings
Bench will restore the other. Dal. 184. Cro. 162. a.

If error be in the enditement, any two of these Justices which were at the
taking of the enditement, upon prayer of the party may grant a supersedeas to
stay restitution, if restitution be not made Dal. 184. Cro. 165. a.

But no Justice not present can grant a supersedeas. ibid.

The Justice may make restitution, or give warrant to the Sheriff, or certify
into the Kings bench, and leave the award of restitution to that Court. Dal.
44, 185. Lam. 156.

None can grant restitution but they before whom the force was found, Dal. 44,
185. except the Kings Bench.

None can personally restore the party, but he that took the inquiry. Dal.
185.

But by precept to the Sheriff. Lam. 158.

After inquiry the Justice of Peace may break into the house by force, and put
the ejected into possession. Dal. 44.

If restitution be made without inquiry, it is punishable in the
Starrechamber. Dal. 45.

Restitution must only be made to him that was put out. Dal. 45, 185.

Restitution is to be made only of house and land, Dal. 183. but not of rent,
common, or advowson. 45.

Restitution may be made notwithstanding a traverse, Dal. 45. but upon tender
of traverse, the safest way for the Justice is to certify the presentment into
the Kings Bench. ibid.

If the Justice upon complaint or notice given of a force, do not remove the
force, record it, and commit the offenders, it is punishable in the
Starrechamber. Dal. 45.

The offenders being gone, the Justice may send his warrant, and commit them
till they find surety of their good behavior. Dal. 45.

If force be made by three, it is a riot. Dal. ibid.

The proceedings upon a writ upon the statute of Northampton, 2. Ed. 3. 3.
1 The Justice of Peace to whom this writ is delivered, is but a minister
therein, and coming to the place where the force is supposed, by the writ he
may cause 3 O yes, and then make proclamation for silence, prout Dal. 46. Cro.
72. a. b. Lam. 168.

2 Then may he read or cause the writ to be read, or declare the effect
thereof.

3 Then let three O yes be made, and make proclamation again for the peace,
prout Dal. 47. Cro. 42. b. Lam.

4 Either enter and search for armor, or enquire by jury. ibid.

All that remain after proclamation, are to be imprisoned, and the armor
apprized. ibid.

If upon proclamation they depart, they are not to be imprisoned.

The execution of the statute of Northampton without writ.
Every Justice of Peace may execute it ex officio without writ. Dal. 47. Cro.
72. a.

The difference in the manner of execution is, that without writ there needs
no proclamation nor certificate into the Chancerie, but the Justice may enter,
search, commit the offenders there found, apprize the armor, record all what
he shall do, and thereout send an estreat into the Exchequer, Dal. 47, 48. Cro.
ibid.

The Justice cannot make restitution to the party outed, but only remove the
force. ibid. Lam. 162.

Of causes to stay granting of restitution, vide Dal. 187.

Forfeitures of a recognizance taken for the Peace.
Whatsoever is a breach of the peace, the same is a forfeiture of the

shall

1 Lose the good, and be imprisoned 2 months without bail or mainprise.

2 For the second lose double the goods, and be imprisoned for 6 months.

Goal, Jailer.
Jailer or Sheriff may make a goal of his own house; so cannot a constable not

jailer, not in the prisoner. Lam. 229. Dal. 239. P. R. 147, 149.

If the survayours do certify the next Justice in a month, the Justice ought
to certify the presentment at the next Sessions.

If the survayours present not til after the month, and the Justices do
certify it at the next Sessions, it is not good against the offenders.

offenders cannot pass. Dal. 130.

Homicide.
Homicide is the killing of a man by a man. Dal. 207.

It is no difference whether the slain be alien, denison, or English man, if he
lives under the Kings protection. Dal. ibid. Cro. 21. a. Lam. 237.

To kill one attainted of treason or of felony, or outlawed for felony, or
attainted in Praemunire, is felony. Dal. 207. Cro. 24. 3.

Homicide is either killing himself, felo de se, or another.

Felo de se forfeiteth to the King his goods and chattels real and personal,
and his debts due by special, Dal. 208. but no lands, nor blood corrupted.
ibid.

His goods are not forfeited till his death. ibid.

Infant or non compos mentis do not forfeit; but a lunatic killing himself out
of his lunacie, does forfeit his goods. Dal. 208.

Homicide of another is Voluntary, Involuntarie.


Voluntary is Murder, vide Murder. Manslaughter.

precedent, and one of them does kill the other. Dal. 214. Cro. 26. a. Lam. 247.

Manslaughter by Chancemedley, or Se defendendo, his person, house, and goods.

master not told to the servant, Lam. 248. so a stranger suddenly taking part.
Lam. 248.

Two that were in malice are reconciled, fall out upon new occasion, and one is
killed; it is manslaughter only. Dal. 215. Lam. 250.

Se defendendo, when one kills another in the necessary defense of himself
or his, thereby to save himself or his possessions or goods, or some other
persons which he is bound to defend from peril: and it is either against a
felon, as murderer or thief, or a loyal subject. Dal. 220. Lam. 252.

Against a loyal subject, if he be assailed by another man, he must fly so
much as he may till he be let by some wall, ditch, hedge, preasse of people,
or other impediment, that his necessity of defense may seem inevitable, and he
shall be committed till the time of his trial, lose his goods, and seek his
pardon. Lam. 153. Dal. 221. It is not material though he strike again, if
before he give any deadly wound he fly to the strait.

Neither is it material though there were former malice, unless he lie in
wait for the other, or agree for the place of fight, or strike the first
stroke. Lam. 253. Dal. 221.

Or assaulted in his own house upon a sudden quarrel, or thereby kills him,
Lam. 254. but he forfeiteth his goods and must have his pardon, except the
assaylant came with a felonious intent to kill or rob him. Dal. 221. Cro. 28.
a. Lam. 254.

A man falls to the ground, there his flying to a strait is not necessary.
Dal. 225.

An officer or minister of Justice, in executing his office being assaulted, is
not bound to fly. Dal. 214.

A servant killing him who robbed or killed his master, so it be done
presently, or in defense of his masters person or goods, if it cannot otherwise
be avoided. Dal. ibid. Cro. 28. a.

Forrester, Parker, or Warrener, or any in their company, killing an offender
in a Forest, Park or Warren, after hue and cry to keep the Peace, if they
yield not themselves, or fly, or defend: themselves by violence, is no
felony. Dal. 222. Quaere if there be no malice in the keeper. Cro. 30. b.

It is justifiable by me, my servants or company, to kill one who attempteth
feloniously to murder or rob me in my dwelling house, or in or near a
highway, horse-way, or foot-way, or burglarily to break my house in the night.
Dal. 220. Cro. 27. Vide Lam. 249. of one entering by force in the day, and
killing in the dark.

To shoot at him that comes to burn my house, is justifiable in me or my
servants. Dal. ibid. Cro. ibid.

In defense of the possession of my goods, I may justify to beat him that
wrongfully takes them, but not kill him, except he be a thief. Dal. 224.

To kill a true man, in defense of house, land, or goods, is manslaughter. Dal.
ibid. Cro. 20. b.

Involuntarie homicide is by misadventure, necessity.


By misadventure is, when a man doing a lawful act, without any evil intent,
kills a man: this is not felony of death, but he shall have his pardon of
course for life and lands, but forfeiteth his goods. Dal. 216.

A schoolmaster, father, mother, or master, correcting moderately his scholar,
child, or servant; Shooting at pricks, buts, or lawful mark; A workman
casting tyle, timber, or stone from a house, or any thing from a cart and
giving warning, or doing other lawful thing and giving warning.

Running at Tilt, or fighting at Barriers by the Kings command.

The killing of a man in doing of an unlawful act, without evil intent, is
felony, as shooting arrows, casting stones into highways or other place
whither men usually resort. Dal. 217.

Fighting at Barriers, or running at Tilt without the Kings command.

Quaere if playing at hand-sword, bucklers, football, wrestling, and such like,
whereby a man is slain or receives hurt, and dies within the year and day,
be felony of death, or may have their pardon of course. Quaere similiter of
casting a stone at bird or beast.

A man may be slain by the fall of a house or tree, etc. and killed by a bull,
bear, horse, dog, etc. or by some fall which he takes, Dal. 218. if it be
through the wilful default of another, it is felony.

The thing which causes the death is a Deodand, and so forfeited to the King.
Dal. 218. Cro. 31. a.

The forfeiture has relation from the stroke given Deodands are not forfeited
till the matter is found on record. Dal. 218.

The Jury which finds the death of a man, must find and apprize the Deodand.
It behooves the town to see it forthcoming; for the Sheriff shall be charged
with the price, and shall levy the same on the Town. Dal. ibid.

If the slain be under 14 years of age, nothing is forfeited as a deodand.
Dal. 218.

Homicide by necessity is Commanded, Tolerated.


An officer does execution after judgment, according to his warrant; it is not
properly homicide, but justice. Dal. 219. Lamb. 234.

Riotters, forcible enterers or detainers, that shall resist the Justice of
Peace or other the Kings officers, and will not yield themselves, being slain,
it is no felony. Dal. 220. Cro. 23. 30. b. 158. Lam^. 215.

If an officer, by virtue of the Kings process, arresting one for debt or
trespass, is resisted, and kills the resister, it has been taken to be no
felony. Dal. 220. Cro. 24. a. 30. b. Quaere.

In all these former cases there must be inevitable necessity, that the
offender could not be taken without killing. Dal. 220.

Horses and Mares.
Any Justice may hear and take the claim of the owner of any horse, etc. which
was stolen within six months after the sale thereof, the proof to be made by
two witnesses upon oath within two days next ensuing the said claim. Dal. 56.

bona fide, so as the right owner repaying his money may have his horse again.
Dal. ibid.

seller.

5 The book-keeper must make a true and perfect entry of the sellers name and
place of dwelling, etc. and of the true price, forfeiture. 31. El. 12.

Every contract for a stolen horse out of the fair is void, though it be
after booked. Dal. ibid.

A sale in open market shall not take away the owners property, the buyer
knowing that it was another. Dal. 56.

All horses and all other goods are to be sold in such a place or shop as is
commonly used for the selling of goods of the same kind, to alter the
property. Dal. ibid.

A thief sells a stolen horse by a false name, and is so entered in the

by the Minister, petty Constable, and Churchwarden, or any two of them, shall
be complained of to any Justice of the Peace, and by him suspected for refusing
the oath of alleagiance. 7. Jac. 6. Lamb. 199, 200.

Two Justices of Peace, one being of the Quorum, may require any person of the
age of 18 or above, under the degree of a Baron or Baroness, to take the oath
of alleagiance, and on refusal to commit him to the goal without bayl, till
the next Assizes or Q. Sessions. 7. Jac. 6. Lamb. 363.

Where the examination of a Justice of Peace is the conviction of the party,
there it ought to be upon oath: but where it is but to inform the Jury upon
the indictment, it needs not. Lamb. 536. Dal. 125. Though the statute does
not expressly say it shall be upon oath. Dal. ibid.

In cases of felony it seems convenient that the information be upon oath,
otherwise the examination shall not be given in evidence.

If the examinate die before the trial, the examination may be evidence;
without oath many will speak coldly. It is the practice of the Courts in
Westminster. Dal. 264. Cro. 194 a. Lamb. 213, 214, 215.

The refusing the oath of alleagiance required by two Justices of the Peace,
and the taking of the same and oath of supremacy by a conformed Recusant
returning into England, are to be certified at the next Q. Sessions. 7. Jac. 6.
Lamb. 216.

The oath of alleagiance required at the Q. Sessions of such as formerly
refused the same, and being there tendered and refused, the refusers (other
then Noblemen and women) incur Praemunire, except women covert, who are to be
sent to the goal without bayl. ibid.

Overseers of the Poor.
All to whom the overseers by 43. Elis. 2. may bind apprentices, may take and
keep them as apprentices, and the overseers may with the assent of two Justices
of Peace, one being of the Quorum, in their respective limits where there be

Pardon.
AT the Common Law before the statute of 13. R: 2. a pardon of all felonies was
good for murders, and some for treason. Lamb. 561.

Pardon of all felonies is not good for murder or petty-treason, except the
pardon be with a non obstante, or that murder be therein expressly mentioned.
Dal. 213. Cro. 21. b.

But it is good for accessaries, both before and after. Lamb. 561.

A pardon of all felonies will not discharge a man that is attainted of felony,
except the execution and attainder be pardoned. Dal. 213. Cro. 115. Lamb. 562.

Breaker of the Peace after the pardon, forfeiteth the pardon, and may be
hanged notwithstanding his pardon. Dal. 213. Cro. 115. b.

The King only can pardon treason, murder, or other felony, or any accessory
thereunto. Dal. 214.

General pardon is that which is given by act of Parliament to all men, of
which the Court ought of duty to give allowance, though the party will not
plead it nor accept the benefit thereof. Lamb. 559, 560.

Pardon of abjuration is not good without special words of abjuration. Lamb.
562.

Quaere if a general pardon for petty-treason avail him that is indicted of
murder, without the word proditorie. 560.

A general pardon coming betwixt the stroke and the death of all misdemeanors,
will avail for the death. Lamb. 560.

Quaere if a pardon of all offenses (except persons outlawed of murder) will
avail one that has committed manslaughter, and yet indicted and outlawed of
murder, and after the pardon reverseth the outlawry. Lamb. 560.

Pardon of attainder and execution for felony is not good for felony. Lamb. 562.

Pardon of a Jailer for escapes of felony and traitors, is not good for
voluntary escapes. Lamb. 562.

Pardon of 2 for all felonies done by them, or either of them, will not serve
for offenses done by one of them alone. Lamb. 562.

Pardon must agree with the indictment in name and addition of the party, and
nature of the offense; for a pardon of all felonies is not good for
petty-treason, murder, nor of one attainted of felony. Lamb. 561.

A special pardon ought to be pleaded under the great seal, and a writ of
allowance brought with it, testifying he has found surety for the good
behavior, unless there be a dispensation by non obstante. Lamb. 561.

Prisoner pleads a pardon, the I. of P. in absence of the Kings Attorney may
join issue that he is one of the persons excepted. Lamb. 560.

He that kills another se defendend^, must sue to the King for a pardon.
Lamb. 253.

He that kills one by misadventure, shall have a pardon of course without
suit. Lamb. 254.

The manner of suing a pardon of course is, If they desire to purchase their
pardon, they must upon their trial plead not guilty, and then the special
matter being found by verdict, they shall be bayled; then they must sue forth a
Certiorari to certify the record to the Lord Chancellor, who shall make them
a pardon of course under the great seal without suing to the King. D. 217. Sta.

bound with two sureties not to offend in any the said particulars, which
recognizances taken by two Justices of the Peace may be returned at the Quarter
Sessions. 1. Jac. 27. Dal. 67, 68. Lam. 335.

By 7. Jac. 11. proof of 1 witness is sufficient for the taking, etc. of
partridges and phesants; the punishment as 1. Jac. 27.

Killer of partridges or phesants with hawks or dog, by color of hawking
between the first of July and the last of August, upon conviction within six
months after the offense by the confession of the party or oath of two

bail, unless he pay presently to the Churchwardens and Overseers of the poor
where he offended or was taken, 40 shill. for hawking, and 20 shill. for every
partridge or phesant taken. 7. Jac. 11. Dal. 68. Lam. 335.

Taking of phesants or partridges upon another man's ground by nets or
otherwise, except unwillingly by trammell and there to let them go again,
loses 20 shill. a phesant, and 10 shill. a partridge. 11. H. 7. 17. and 23.

phesants bred up or brought up from beyond the seas) loses for every deer 40
sh. phesant 20 sh. hare or partridge 10 sh. one moytie to the informer, the
other to the poor of the parish. 1. Jac. 27.

Constable by warrant from two Justices of the Peace may search the houses of
any not allowed, suspected to have any setting-dogs or nets for partridges, and
finding them, may detain, kill, or cut in pieces any of them. 7. Jac. 11.

Offenses against the statute of 1. Jac. 27. punished by it, are not to be
punished by Judges of Assize in their circuit, Justices of Peace at Quarter
Sessions, or two Justices of the Peace out of the Sessions. 1. Jac. 27.

Every man may stay the affrayers, till their heat be cooled, and then they may
deliver them to the Constable to imprison them till they find sureties of the

death by some hurt, for then any man may carry the other to the goal till it be

The child maliciously kills the father or mother, it is pettie-treason,
though the father or mother at the same time give neither meat, drink, nor
wages to the said child; but it is treason in the said child, in respect of
the duty of nature violated. Dal. 205. Cro. 19. b. But Lam. says it is not
treason in the child, if the father give it not meat nor drink, as to a
servant, Lam. 245. and do their business, for it is as a servant.

The son or daughter in law kill the father or mother in law with whom they

The Justices may compel such as be of ability, to take poor children
apprentices, and may bind such masters refusing over to the next
jail-delivery: so said Sr. Henry Montague at Cambridge Assizes 1618. and the
statute of 43. Elis. 2. seems to warrant as much, the words whereof are to
this effect, It shall be lawful for the Churchwardens and overseers or the
greater part of them, by the assent of 2 I. of the P. to bind any such
children to be apprentices where they shall see convenient cause, Dal. 92, 93.
or the Churchwardens or overseers, with the assent of 2 such Justices, may

You shall swear you shall depart this Realm of England, and all other his
Majesty's dominions, and that you shall not return hither or come again into
any of his Majesty's dominious without license of our sovereign Lord the King,

Every such Recusant that refuses to abjure, or after abjuration does not
within the time appointed go to such haven and depart, or after such abjuration
returns without his Majesty's special license, in every such case shall be
adjudged a felon. 35. El. 2. Dal. 108. Lam. 419.

The Justices of Peace before whom such abjurations shall be made, must
presently cause the same to be entered at the next general goal-deliverie in
the said county. ibid.

The Bishop of the diocese or any one Justice of Peace, or Minister of the
parish where such convicted Recusant shall be, may require his submission. ibid.

Justices of Peace at their Quarter Sessions may require, hear, and determine
of all Recusants both for not coming to Church and not receiving the Sacrament
according to law, as J. of Assize and goal-deliverie may do, and at the
Sessions (in which such enditement shall be taken) make proclamation to render

Release.
Justice of Peace compels one of his own motion to give surety of the Peace
until a certain day, he may by like discretion release it before the day. Lam.

Party bound generally to keep the Peace without any day limited, it is for

Recognisance is taken at the suit of (...) to keep the Peace against him
only, A may release it before the same Justice or any other that will certify
it. Lam. 110. Dal. 147. Cro. 139. b. 169. a. That release being certified at
the next Quarter Sessions will discharge the party bound of his appearance, so
that he shall not be called upon for his recognisance. Dal. ibid.

certified at the Sessions with the release, lest peradventure the Peace was
broken before the release made. Lam. 111. Dal. 144. Cro. 1.

Whether the good abearing taken upon complaint may be released by any special
person, quaere, Lam 133. Dal. 163.

Neither the Justice of the Peace nor the party can discharge the recognisance
of the Peace by the release out of the Sessions; for first the recognisance is
made by the King, and therefore none but the King can release or discharge it.
Secondly, the recognisance is taken for the parties appearance, and the release
cannot discharge the appearance. Dal. 175.

The appearance is requisite, notwithstanding any release made; first, for the
safety of the recognisance; secondly, that others may object in open Sessions,
if he have broken the Peace, that he may be endited thereupon. Dal. 176. F.
contra Comp. 139. b.

If the Justices of Peace at the Sessions do certify the release, by this the
obliged is discharged, and shall not be called upon for his recognisance, nor
his default recorded; for the principal cause of the recognisance was the
keeping of the Peace, the which is discharged by the release which is certified
at the Sessions, and then the appearance is but accessarie to the same, and the
intent is only that then he should find new surety if the party will not
release: and this is the common usage.

After the entering or detaining with force found, the Justice of Peace may by
himself or precept to the Sheriff under the test of himself alone restore the
party grieved to his possession. Dal. 185. Lam. 156.

None can make restitution but they before whom the enditement is found, but
the Justices of the Kings Bench, either upon certificate made by the J. of P.
before whom it was found of the presentment, or if the said presentment or
enditement be removed by Certiorari. Dalt. 185. Lam. 157, 158.

If the Sheriff return upon a precept or writ of restitution that he cannot
make restitution for resistance, he shall be amerced, for he may take the power
of the county. Dalt. 185. Lam. 157. Cro. 163. b.

Justice of Peace before whom the presentment was made, dies before
restitution; quaere, whether the Justices at the Sessions can award it. Lam.
155.

Justices of Peace ought not to award restituion where the enditement is
sufficient in law, either in matter or form. Dalt. 183.

In the enditement 1. not only an entry must be, but also a putting out: 2.
the enditement must express the quality of the thing, ( viz.) whether it be
message, cottage, meadow, pasture, wood, or land arable: 3. it must say Et

If error or insufficiency be in the enditement taken before Justices of
Peace, and restitution awarded, any two Justices of those that were present at
the taking thereof may at another Sessions, or without Sessions grant a

What one J. of P. is to do in case of Riots.
He may prevent a riot before it be done, or stay it in the doing, and in the
doing may take and imprison the rioters, and bind them to their good
behavior. Dalt. 84.

A riot being done, Justices of Peace can neither record the riot, nor make
inquiry, nor assesse the fine, nor award process, nor meddle with it, but
only as a trespass against the Peace. Dalt. 84. Lam. 181.

Justices of Peace sitting in a judicial place, and seeing a riot, may command
them to be arrested, and recorded, and it concludes the offenders, Dal. 84.

But a Justice of Peace in another place seeing a riot, and recording it, the
parties may traverse it. ibid. Cro. 65. a.

Every Justice of Peace being of and in the county, having notice of any riot,
ought to execute the statute 13. H. 4. 7. viz. that the rioters be arrested,
etc. and removed, otherwise the next Justices forfeit 100 pounds apiece, and
every other Justice in whom there shall be default, fineable in the
Starrechamber. Dal. 84, 85. Cro. 124. a.

One Justice of Peace may arrest rioters, enforce them to find sureties for
the Peace or good behavior, or in default commit them to prison. Dal. 84, 85,
87. Cro. 157. b. Lam. 181.

A Justice of Peace not finding the rioters come to the place, may leave his
servants to restrain the rioters when they come; or else arrest them if they
offer to break the Peace. Dal. 85. Lam. 181.

If the Justice of Peace be sick, he may send his servant to repress a riot,
or to arrest such offenders, and bring them before him to find sureties for
the Peace, and his command by word is sufficient. Dal. 85. Cro. 64. a. 148. b.

One Justice of Peace may cause all statutes for suppressing of riots to be put
in execution. Dal. 85.

If the riot be notorious, it is not safe to stay complaint or information.

What two Just. of Peace may do in a riot.
They ought to send for the Sheriff or Undersheriffe, if none of them come,
Dal. 86. Lam. 327. If one or two next Justices do come, and not the Sheriff or
Under-sheriffe, each as come shall be excused of their fine of 100 pound. Dal.
86. Lam. 327. Cro. 63. b.

If one Justice of Peace in the county shall execute the statute of 13. H. 4.
7. it shall excuse the next Justices. Dal. 86. Lam. 326, 327.

Two Justices of Peace present without the Sheriff, are fineable if they do
not all which by the statute of 13. H. 4. 7. ought to be done. Dal. 86. Cr. 63

Vnder-sheriffe must do upon the statute of 13. H. 4. 7. Dal. 88.
1 They must go to the place where the riot is. Dal. 88.

2 They shall take the power of the county ( viz.) all above 15 years of age,
under the degree of Barons, upon pain of imprisonment, fine, and ransom. Dal.
88. Cro. 157. Lam. 314, 315.

It is good to raise the power of the county with certain information (though
it be false and excused) or without information, if when they come they find
one. 88, 89. Cro. 64. b. Lam. 315, 316.

3 They shall arrest all such offenders, or cause them to be arrested, bring
the force, commit to prison the rioters, and take away their weapons. Dalt. 89.
Lam. 326, 327.

And all such as come into the company, if they be present, shall be arrested,
imprisoned, and fined, as it seems. Dal. ibid.

Such as they meet coming from the place riotously arrayed, they may arrest and
imprison, but cannot record any riot done by them, but after enquiry may fine
them. Dal. 89. Cro. 63. a. Lam. 316.

The Justices see the riot committed, and the rioters escape; they must record
them, and cannot arrest them but upon fresh suit, which record must be sent
into the Kings Bench, that process may come from thence. Dal. 80. Lam. 318.

The Justices may grant a warrant for such as they saw escaping, to be bound to
the good behavior. Dalt. 81. Cro. 196. a.

And so they may do upon information, but it is best to do it upon inquiry,
and so to fine them. Dalt. 90.

In execution of the said arrest of rioters, the Justices may justify the
beating, wounding, or killing of any the rioters which resist or will not
yield. Dalt. 90. Cro. 62. b. 158. b. Lam. 316.

4. After arrest the Justice, Sheriff, or Undersheriffe shall record the riot
in writing ( viz.) all that shall be done in their presence against law, which
ought to be formal and certain, as time, place, number, weapons, manner, etc.
Dalt. 90. Cro. 63. a. Lam. 316, 317.

If in going to see a riot, another riot happen in their presence, they may
record it, arrest and imprison the offenders. Dalt. 90. Lam. 318.

If the rioters make a riot upon the Justices, they may record it also. Dalt.

Justice records a riot, and upon examination it appears no riot, or saw it
not, or there was no riot, yet the parties are concluded. Dalt. 90. Cro. 63. a.
65. a. 130. a. Lam. 317.

The Justices are presently to commit rioters to the goal, and the power of the
county ought to be aiding to the Sheriff or Under-sheriffe. Dalt. 91.

None may commit the rioters but the Justices who had the view. ibid.

If the Justice, Sheriff, or Under-sheriffe commit to prison the offenders,
and do not record the riot, every of them loses 100 pound. Dalt. 91. Cro. 61.
b.

The said Justice and none other shall assesse the fine upon the offenders,
which by the statute of 1. H. 5. 8. ought to be of good value, that thereout
the charges of the Justice and other officers may be born, yet must be
reasonable and just. Dal. 91. Cro. 61. a. Lam. 317.

The fines must be imposed upon every offender severally. Dal. 91.

The sine must be estreated into the Exchequer, Dal. 91. and then to deliver
the offender as it seems. ibid.

The J. as it seems, may out of the fines pay the charges of the said
Justice, and of the Jury who made the inquiry for their diet and the
Sheriffs fees; and the Justices Clerk who makes up the record, may have his
fees out of that money, or rather may take of every offender 12 pence when they
pay their fines. Dal. 117, 118.

Or the Justice may record the riot, commit the offender, and after certify
the record to the Assizes, Sessions, or Kings Bench. Dal. 91, 92.

The record may be delivered at the Sessions to the Clerk of the Peace,
together with the residue of the money remaining of the fine. Dal. 118.

Where Justices of Peace are remiss in punishing the rioters, the Lords in the
Starchamber may and do after assesse greater fines for the same riot. Dal. 94.
Cro. 63. a.

If the riot was not committed in the presence of the Justice, or the rioters
gone before their coming, two Justices at least within one month next after
must enquire thereof by a Jury returned by the Sheriff, and record the riot
being found, which is to remain with one of the said Justices. Dal. 92. Cro.
124. a. Lam. 321.

The form of such inquiry, vide Dal. 9. Lam. 329.

Inquiry shall not be unless the rioters be gone. Dal. 92.

It is not necessary that one of the Justices of Peace be of the Quorum. Dal.
92. Cro. 62. b.

The inquiry may be made at any time after the month; but if it be not within
the month, the Justices are in danger to lose 100 pound: yet if the Jurie be
charged within the month, and have day after to give up the verdict, the
statute is not broken. Dal. 92. Lam. 322.

At the inquiry the Sheriff or Under-sheriffe must be present, but then as
ministers only. Dal. 92. Lam. 321.

The Justices assembled to enquire within the month, the parties agree, and
the Justices dismiss thereupon the Jurie, the Justices shall be fined though
none will solicit the Inquest or give evidence to the Jurie; for the Justices
ought to proceed ex officio, seeing some of the Jurie may have knowledge of the
riot, and they ought to make proclamation if any will give evidence. Dal. 92,
93. Lam. 322.

If at the parties request the J. dismiss the Jurie without inquiry, they are
fineable in the Starchamber to the King. Dal. 93. P. R. 29.

The I. may bind to the good behavior the parties complaining of the riot,
who caused them to meet and will not prosecute for the King, but have agreed
it. Dalt. 93.

Though the Justices go not to see the riot, yet they may enquire within a
month after. Lamb. 321.

After inquiry had and the riot found, the Justices have power to hear and
determine the same ( viz.) first to make out process against the offender
under their own test. Secondly, to assesse the fine. Thirdly, to commit till
they have paid the fine. Fourthly, to deliver them after payment of their fine
or sureties taken by recognisance, receive their traverse, if the matter will

Commission and statute referred to their charge. Lam. 278.

Sessions held without summons are good, but then none shall lose any thing for
default of appearing. Lam. 380, 381.

Summons of the Sessions is usually by precept written to the Sheriff, and by
him to be returned at the Sessions. Lam. 381, 385.

Precept for summoning the Sessions may be made by any two Just. of Peace, one
being of the Quor. but not the Custos Rotulorum alone; and summons cannot be
discharged by Supersedeas of all the other Justices, but by Supersedeas out of
the Chancerie. Lam. 382, 383.

Sessions held by one Justice of Peace is not good, although it were summoned
by two, and styled by their names; but by two sufficient Justices it is good,

week after S. Michael, the Epiphanie, the clause of Easter, after the

The Easter Sessions by 33. Hen. 8. cap. 10. are to be holden as arbitrable,
and therefore though by summons they be to be kept in one place, yet they may
be kept in another; but then there can be no amerciament for default of
appearance. Lam. 383, 384.

Two Sessions at one time for one County lawfully summoned at two places, both
are good, and appearance at one shall excuse default of appearance at the
other, and presentiments taken before either of them shall be good. 384.

The Clerk of the Peace. 393.

Jurors for inquiry and trial. 396.

The Justices of Peace, if need require, may keep a special Sessions by virtue
of their Commission, or by the statute. 2. Hen. 4. 5. Lamb. 623.

Summons of a special Sessions is for the most part for some special
inquiry, and not to the general service of the commission. Lam. 623.

All matters within the commission or statute may at a special Sessions of the
Peace be given in charge, yet they are at liberty to give in charge either all
or any of them. Lam. 623, 624.

If two Justices of the Peace, one being of the Quorum, make a precept to the
Sheriff for the holding a Sessions at such a place and day, and to return a
Jury before them, either Justice can by their Supersedeas to the Sheriff
inhibite him, Cro. 126. b. but the King by his writ of Supersedeas may
discharge it. ibid.

A man is bound to appear before a Justice of Peace within forty days after,
in the mean time a general Sessions is kept, he ought to appear before the
Justice at the Sessions. Cro. 123. a. nu. 18.

A Justice commands one on pain of 10 pound by his precept to appear at the
next Sessions, and he does not, no Scire facias shall go against him more then
upon a Sub poena, but it seems he may be attached upon a contempt.

Soldiers passing out of the Realm to serve any foreign Prince, etc. not
having before their passage taken the oath of alleagiance before the officer

ibid.

Soldier entered upon a record, and having taken presse-money, and that

Ed. 6. 2. Dalt. ibid. So of mariners and gunners that have taken pressemoney to
serve the King on the sea, and come not unto, or depart from the captain
without license, it is felony. 5. Elis. 5. Dal. 247.

In these cases following, by the statute of 39. Elis. 17. soldiers and
mariners do become felons, Dal. 247.
Such which set themselves not to some lawful course of life, but wander up

Every parish is to be taxed to the relief of disabled soldiers, by the
greater part of the Justices at their Quarter Sessions next after Easter, so as
no parish be above ten pence, nor under two pence weekly to be paid, so as the
total sum in any County where there shall be above 50 parishes, do not

none be there, in the parish next adjoining. 43. El. 3.

In default of payment of the same assesse, the Churchwardens and petty
Constables may levy it by distress and sale, etc. and in their default the
aforesaid Justices or Justice of Peace. 43. El. 3.

The Churchwardens and petty Constables are to pay over their collections to
the high Constable 10 days before every Quarter Sessions, and the high
Constables at every Quarter Sessions are to pay it over to the Treasurer. ibid.

If any of them make default, then the Churchwardens or petty Constables
forfeit 20 shillings, and every high Constable 40 shillings to be levied by the
Treasurer by distress and sale for augmentation of stock. 43. El. 3.

Treasurer for maimed soldiers must be 10 pound in lands or 50 in goods in the

next Qu. Sessions, at which time the more part of the Justices may according to
their discretions grant him a pension during his life, being not duly revoked
or altered. 43. Elis. 3.

43. Elis. 3.

Star Chamber.
The experience of Star Chamber is the best guide and direction for a Justice
of Peace. Lam. 175

Stolen goods.
After attainder upon evidence by the owner, the stolen goods are to be
restored to the owner by writ of restitution awarded by the Justices before
whom the attainder was. 21. H. 8. 11. Lam. 586. Dal. 262. Cro. 191. a. Vide
Restitution of stolen goods.

Stewards of Courts.
Stewards of the Sheriffs turn, Leet, or Pypowders, cannot grant surety of
the Peace unless it be by prescription, but every of them may commit him to
ward that shall make an affray in their presence whilst they be in execution
of their office, which the steward in a court Baron cannot do. Lam. 14. Dal. 2.

Stocks of the shire.
The parishioners, and in their default the Churchwardens and Constables, are
to assesse the tax imposed upon the parish by the Justices at Easter Sessions,
toward the relief of the prisoners in the Kings Bench, Marshalsey, Hospitalls,
and other losses by fire, etc. In default of them, any Justice of Peace
dwelling in that parish, or (if none dwell there) the next Justice may assesse
the same; and the same Justice of Peace, or any other Justice of Peace in that
limit, in default of the Churchwardens and Constables, may levy the same by
distress and sale of the offenders goods, and in default of distress may
commit such persons without bail till they pay the same. 43. Elis. 2. Dal. 110.

In all taxations observe these rules, Dal. 110.

1 The most reasonable taxation of land is by the yearly value, not the
quantity.

2 He that occupies lands in his own hands in several parishes, shall be
charged in every parish propoitionably for his land there.

3 The farmer shall be rated for the land, and not the lessor.

4 A man is not to be rated for his farm-rents, for that the occupier of the
lands is chargeable for the same.

5 By goods in most cases a man may be rated, as well as by lands, but not both
by goods and lands.

6 A man shall be charged for goods only in that town where the goods be at
the time of assessment: the Constable and major part of the parishioners, upon
warning given in the Church, may make such taxations by law. Dalt. 106. Cook 5,
6, 7.

The like may be done by the Churchwardens and the greater part of the
parishioners for Churchcharges. Dalt. ibid.

If the greater part will not meet, the officers and such as will meet may tax.
Dal. ibid.

Where a man is charged by goods, they must be bona notabilia. Dalt. 131. Vide
Taxations.

Subsidy.
Upon proof before two Justices of Peace that a subsidy man by covin has
escaped taxation, they shall charge him at double the value of so much as he
ought to be taxed at, and he shall be further punished at the discretion of the
said Justices. Lam. 3^6

Summons of the Sessions, vide Sessions.

Sunday.
All persons shall resort to their parish Church or Chapel accustomed, or upon
reasonable let to some usual place where Common prayer shall be used upon
every Sunday and other day ordained and used to be kept holy day, and then and
there to be orderly and soberly during the time of Common prayer, preaching, or
other service of God, or lose 1^ pence for every offense to be ievied by the
Churchwardens there, to the use of the poor by way of distress, 1. Elis. 2.
Dal. 80, 81. though he be Popish Recusant convict or not convict. ibid.

If any subject do not resort and repair every Sunday to some Church or
Chapel, or some usual place appointed for Common prayer, and there hear
divine Service according to the statute, 1. Elis. 2. it shall be lawful for a
Justice of Peace of that limit, upon proof by confession of the party, or oath
of witness, to call the party before him; and if he or they make not a
sufficient excuse, to the satisfaction of the said Justice, then to give
warrant to the Churchwardens of the said parish under his hand and seal, to
levy 12 pence by distress to the use of the poor for every default; and for
want of distress to commit the offender to prison, every offender to be called
in question for one month after the offense. 3. Jac. 4. Lam. 418.

None punished according to the branch of the statute of 3 Jac. 4 shall be
punished by 1. Elis. 2. for the same offense. 3. Jac. 4.

There shall be no meeting, assemblies, or concourse of people for any sports
or pastime out of their own parishes on the Lords day; nor Bear-baiting,
Bul-baiting, Interludes, common plays, or other unlawful exercises within
their own parishes, upon forfeiture of 3 shillings 4 pence to the use of the
poor, upon view of one Justice of Peace, confession of the party offending,
or oath of one witness, to be levied by warrant of the said Justice under hie
hand and seal to the Constable and Churchwardesn; in default of distress, the
offender to sit in the stocks three hours. The offender to be questioned
within one month. 1. Car. 1.

Carryers, waggoners, waynmen, drovers, shall not travel with horse, wagons,
carts, or cattle upon Sunday, upon pain of 20 shillings for every offense.
Neither shall any Butcher kill or sell any victual upon Sunday, on pain of 6
shillings 8 pence, upon view of one Justice of Peace, confession of the party,
or oath of two witnesses, the penalty to be levied by the Constable or
Churchwardens to the use of the poor by warrant from any Justice of Peace by
distress, or by any that will sue for the same at the Qu. Sessions in the same
County within six months, his reward not to be above the third part. 1. Car.
1.

Showing of boots on the Sunday, with intent to sell them, loses 3 shill. 4
pence, and the value of the boots. 1. Jac. 22. Lam. 46.

Supersedeas.
Supersedeas is sufficient, though it heither name the sureties, nor contain
the sum wherein they are bound; but it is better if it do both. Lam. 96.
Dalt. 139.

Supersedeas delivered to the officer, if he urge new sureties, the party may
refuse; and if he be committed, he may have his action. Lam. 99. Dal. 139.

Supersedeas out of the Chancery will discharge surety of the Peace in the
Kings Bench, and either of them a precept for the peace awarded by a Justice of
Peace, and an attachment lies against him if he surcease not, and he may be
imprisoned and fined for it. Lam. 99. Dal. 140.

Supersedeas received by a Justice of Peace out of an higher court, he should
forbear to make any warrant, or if one be made, to send out his Supersedeas to
the Sheriff or other officer to desist to put it in execution. Lam. 99, 100.

Supersedeas out of the Chancery is to be certified at the next Sessions,
together with the recognisance for the Peace; if the Supersedeas do testify
that he has found surety in the Chancery only unto a certain day, which day
it after those Sessions if the Supersedeas come to his hands after his
recognisance taken. Lam. 13. Dalt. 140.

Supersedeas for the good abearing, quaere if it be granted by a Justice of
Peace, Lam. 123. Dalt. affirms it, 164. Cro. 237 a.

A Supersedeas made by a Justice of Peace, and returned under his seal, is a
sufficient record to prove a recognisance taken for the Peace, and warrant to
call the party bound, and if he make default, to record the same. Lam. 97.

If a Justice of P. will by a Supersedeas discharge a Precept for the Peace
awarded by another by virtue of his office, and not by Supplicavit, the
recognisance would be taken according to the form of the Precept. Lam. 96. Dal.
139.

Certiorari to remove a record is in it self a Supersedeas to the Justice, yet
the party may have a Supersedeas to the Sheriff that he arrest him not upon
the Justices record. Lam. 515.

Whether the Justice ex officio after a Certiorari ought to award their
Supersedeas, to stay proceeding upon their record, quaere Lam. ibid.

An exigent awarded against one indicted of a trespass before the Justices of
Peace, may be stayed by Supersedeas out of the Chancerie, upon surety found
there to appear the day in the Writ, though he be taken upon it. Lam. 326, 327.

So by Supersedeas granted by two Justices of Peace, one being of the Quorum,
testifying that he has found sureties, al. fine assidendo. ibid.

By one Justice of Peace, Dal. 176. Cro. 334. If a Supersedeas be directed to
the Justice of Peace and Sheriff, the Justice to whose hands it shall be
delivered may keep it, and deliver the libell to the party. Dalt. 140.

Supersedeas granted for the Peace or good behavior out of the Chancery or
Kings Bench, is void, unless it be upon motion in open Court, and upon
sureties of five pounds in lands, or 10 pounds in goods in subsidy.

Whether the party bound, sending the Supersedeas to the Sessions, be
discharged of his appearance there, quaere Dal. 140, 141. Lam. 113.

Supplicavit.
He only to whom the Writ of Supplicavit is delivered, must execute it. Dal.
153.

The Justice that receives the Writ, may make the Warrant to the Constable or
other party and indifferent; and if he refuse to find sureties, to carry him
to prison. Dalt. 153.

The party attached can be bound only before him that sent out the Warrant.
Dalt. 153.

The Justice is to execute the Supplicavit as it directs. Dal. ibid.

If the sums be left to discretion, it is safe to take good sums. Dalt.
ibid.

After sureties taken the Justice may make him a Supersedeas. Dalt. 153.

The Justice needs not return the Supplicavit. nor make certificate, until a
Certiorari do come to him. Lam. 10. Dalt. 157.

Supremacy.
To refuse the oath of Supremacy, the first offense is Praemunire, the second
Treason. 5. Elis. 1.

Surety of the Peace.
Surety of the Peace is the acknowledgement of a recognisance to the King
(taken by a compettent Judge of record) for the keeping of the Peace. Dal. 127.

Every Justice of Peace may take and command the Peace either as a Judge or a
Minister. Dalt. ibid.

Justice of Peace may command surety of the Peace, either of his own
discretion, or at the prayer of another.

In what cases a Justice of Peace may command surety of the Peace by his own
discretion, Dal. 128, 129.
1 One that makes an affray upon the Justice himself, or an assault.

2 Such as in his presence make an affray upon another, or offer to strike
another.

3 Such as in his hearing shall threaten to kill, beat, or hurt another, or to
burn his house.

4 Such as in his presence contend only in hot words.

5 Such as in his presence go or ride armed offensively, or with unusual
number of servants or attendants. And servants and laborers that bear any
weapons contrary to the statute of 12. Ric. 2.

6 Any person by him suspected to be inclined to break the Peace.

7 If the Constable bring one before him that shall threaten to kill, maim, or
beat another.

8 If the Constable bring one who in his presence attempted to break the Peace
by drawn weapon, striking or assaulting another.

9 Whom the Constable finds fighting or quarrelling in a house, he may break
open the door, and bring them before a Justice of Peace to be bound.

10 He may make his warrant for such as have made an affray, and bind them to
the Peace.

11 If one have received a wound, he may bind the one and the other till the
wound be cured, and the malice over.

12 Such as go or ride armed offensively to faires or markets, or wear or
carry dags or pistols charged.

13 Common Barretours.

14 Rioters.

15 Him that stands bound to keep the Peace, and has forfeited his
recognisance by breach of the Peace, and will not be bound again, till he be
convicted and the forfeiture levied. Dal. 129. Yet Crom. 141. says that he may
be bound anew if he be only convict for breaking the Peace.

16 Him that stands bound, if his sureties be insufficient.

Justice of Peace is to send to prison him that refuses to give sureties,
until he find sureties. Dal. 129. Lam.

17 Justice of Peace may cause one to be arrested to find surety of the Peace
against another, and grant a warrant for it: for he might have bound him of his
own authority. Dal. 129.

At the request of another he may command surety of the Peace, but must first
take an oath of the party that demands the Peace, that he stands in fear
of his life, or of some bodily hurt, or to have his house burnt. Dal. 130. Lam.

Causes to procure surety of the Peace.
1 He that is threatened to be hurt in body, as to be beaten, wounded, maimed,
or killed. Dal. 130.

2 He that fears another will beat, wound, maim, or kill him. Dal. 130.

3 He that fears another will burn his house. Dal. 130.

4 He that fears that A will procure another to hurt him in his body, or
burn his house. Dal. 130.

5 If a man lie in wait to beat, kill, or hurt another. Dal. 130.

Quaere, if he threaten to burn his goods.

In what cases a man shall not have the Peace granted.
1 To threaten and to imprison him. Dalt. 130. Lam. Crom. 135. Quaere tamen.

2 Where one is in fear that a man will hurt his servant, cattle, or other
goods. Dal. 130. Crom. 138. a.

3 Because he is at variance with his neighbor. Dalt. 131.

4 Where there is no fear of present or future danger. Dal. 131. Lam.

5 For a battery past: yet a Justice, if he see cause, may bind over the
affrayers. Dal. 131. Lam.

Justice of Peace may deny to grant surety of the Peace, if it be upon mere
vexation; yet if the party will take his oath, it is not safe to deny it.
Dal. 131.

Against whom surety of the Peace may be granted.
Against a Knight or any person under the degree of a Baron. Dal. 133.

Against any Ecclesiastical person not doing divine Service in the Church or
Churchyard, or other place dedicated to God. Dal. 133.

One Justice of Peace may grant the surety of the Peace against his fellow
Justice. Dal. 133.

One Justice of Peace may demand the Peace against another man.

The wife may demand the Peace against her husband, if he threaten to kill her,
or outragiously beat her, or have notorious cause to fear it; and the husband
may crave the Peace against his wife. Dal. 133, 134.

The Peace may be granted to a feme-covert, or an infant under the age of 14
years, if he have discretion to crave the Peace; but they must be bound by
sureties. Dal. 134.

A lunatic may crave the Peace, and have it granted him. Dal. 134.

It may be granted against one attainted either of treason or of felony, Dalt.
135. or convict of heresy. Dal. 163.

It may be had against an excommunicate person, Dal. 135. and an abjured
person. ibid.

It may be had against one attainted in Praemunire, and against an alien either
made denizon, or living in England.

It may be had against one dumb and blind, so against an impotent person.

Against whom the Peace cannot be granted.
1 It cannot be granted against any Nobleman, or Noblewoman. Dal. 131.

2 Against one non sanae memoriae.

3 Against one born dumb and deaf, or made blind and deaf accidentally: he
may have understanding, and the Peace may be granted to him or against him.
Dalt. 163.

How the surety of the Peace is to be commanded and executed.
A Justice of Peace may command the Peace by word, and by writing.

By word.
The party being present in the presence of the Justice of Peace threatens,
or makes an assault or affray upon another, or does any other act tending to
the breach of the Peace. Dal. 136. Cro. 138. Lam.

One demands the surety of the Peace, being present, and takes his oath he
is affrayed, etc. the Justice may command the other to find surety. Dal. 136.
Cro. 138. b. Lam.

The Justice in such cases may command the Constable or other known officer, or
his own servant being present, to arrest such party to find surety of the
Peace, and may commit to the Goal such party refusing to find surety. Dal.
Cro. Lamb. ibid.

By writing.
The Justice by precept or warrant in writing under his seal directed to some
known Officer, or other indifferent person, containing the cause and at whose
suit, to the end the parties may provide the sureties and take them with them.
Dal. 136. Lam.

The Justice may make his warrant to bring the party before him, but the usual
manner is to bring the party before the same Justice or some of the Justices of
the County. Dal. 136, 137. 288.

Who may serve the Warrant, vide Warrant.

The Constable is first to acquaint the party with the matter in the Warrant;
and if he refuse to go before the Justice to find sureties, he may arrest him
and carry him to the Goal, without carrying him to the Justice. Dal. 137. Lam.

If the party yield to find surety, the Officer is not bound to go up and
down with him, but may keep him until he can procure sureties to come to him;
if afterward he make resistance or offer to go away, he may by his warrant
carry him to the Goal and set him in the stocks till he can get aid to convey
him to the Goal. Dal. 137.

The arrest is not justifiable except the Officer do carry him to the Goal that
refuses to find sureties. Cro. 171. b. Dal. 138.

The party may go before any other Justice (if the warrant proceed ex officio)
to offer the sureties, but cannot force the Officers to travel out of the
division where they dwell. Nay it is at the election of the officer to carry
the party to any other Justice, rather then to give the election to the
delinquent. Dal. 138.

The party coming before the Justice is to offer his sureties, or else the
Justice is to commit him, for the Justice needs not to command them. Dal. 137.

If the party refuse before the Justice of Peace to find sureties, the Officer
by the first Warrant may commit him. Dal. 138.

The Officer is fineable if he arrest the party, and do not carry him before a
Justice of Peace, if he be willing to find sureties; secondly if upon refusal
they arrest him, and do not carry him to the Goal. Dal. 138.

The party being imprisoned, the Justice of Peace may make him his liberty;
first, if the complainant die; secondly, if he do enter surety of the Peace.
Dal. 138.

If the imprisoned have a suit depending in the common pleas, by some opinions,
the imprisoned may be discharged by a writ of privilege. Quaere tamen, Dal.
138. Cro. 38. a. Lam.

A sworn and known Officer needs not to show his Warrant, but the servant of
the Justice must show it if it be required. Dal. 281. Lam. 89.

If husband and wife be bound to appear, and in the mean time to keep the
Peace, and the husband only appears, the recognisance is not forfeited. Dal.
146. Cro. 144. b.

Suspicion and suspects of felony.
A suspect of felony ought not to be arrested by a warrant from a Justice of
Peace, unless he be endited before; for if the bailiffe which serves the
warrant does suspect him, he may do it of himself without a warrant; and
without suspicion the Justices warrant is no warrant. Lam. 188. Dal. 289. Crom.
147. b. 148. b. 197. a. Quaere.

Suspicion only without felony committed is no cause to arrest another. Dal.
228, 274. Cro. 154. a.

A felony being committed, every man may arrest suspicious persons that be of
evil fame, etc. and if such person make resistance, the other may justify to
beat him. Dal. 295.

The Constable or other person that arresteth one for felony or suspicion,
must himself suspect. Dal. 268, 296. Crom.

Swannes.
Taking away from his own or another man's ground Swannes of another man's, upon
conviction and examination of witnesses is imprisonment for a year and a day,
and loss of ten pound. Lam.

To steal Swannes unmarked, if they be domiti, and kept in a man's manor or
private rivers, is felony. Dal. 262. edit. 1626.

Swearing.
He that swears or curses, being convicted by hearing of any Justice of the
Peace, or by oath of two witnesses, or confession of the party before a
Justice of Peace, loses 12 pence to the poor to be levied by distress, the
offense being proved within 20 days, or for default of a distress to be set
in the stocks three hours. 21. Jac. 20.

The offender being under twelve years of age, and not forthwith paying his 12
pence, by warrant of a Justice of Peace, or head-officer, is to be whipped by
the Constable, or by the parent or master in his presence. ibid.

Taxations, vide Stock of the Shire.
TAxations made for a Commonwealth, as making or mending of bridges,
highways, causeys, sea-banks, etc. shall be upon all persons though they
assent not. Dal. 137. edit. 1626.

Talebearers, vide News.

Tanners, vide Leather.

Tavern-keeper.
Assignment of such as shall keep a Tavern to utter wine, is to be made at the
general Sessions, unless it be otherwise by especial grant. 7. E. 6. 5. Lam.
614.

Testimonial.
Testimonial under the hand of one Justice of Peace sealed, is sufficient to
pass in hay-time and harvest-time from one County to another. Lam. 190.

In all testimonials and pasports, some assured marks of the party, by which
he may infallibly be distinguished and known from others, are fit to be
specified. Lam. 206.

Testimonial for a serving-man turned from his masters service, or whose
master is dead, ought to be made by two Justices of Peace. 27. Elis. 11. Lam.
331. Dal. ^o.

Theft.
Theft is a fraudulent and felonious taking of another man's personal goods, in
the absence of the owner, and without his knowledge. Dalt. 229. Lam. 272.

Theft is either Grand-larcenie, or Pettie-larceny.

Grand-larcenie is when goods stolen are above 12 pence, and it is felony of
death, except the party be saved by his book. Dal. 229.

Yet if the goods be of more value, and the Jury find it did not exceed 12
pence, it is not grand-larcenie. Dal. 229.

Pettie-larcenie is if the goods do not exceed 12 pence, and is not felony of
death, but imprisonment for some time, or whipping, or some other punishment by
the discretion of the Justice before whom the party is arraigned. Dal. 229.

For pettie-larcenie, the Justice of Peace before whom the offender shall be
brought, is not to punish him, but either to send him to the house of
correction, or to bail him. ibid.

Pettie-larcenie is forfeiture of goods and chattels.

Six pence, four pence, and three pence, being taken by one at several times
from one and the same person, may be put together in one enditement. Dal. 230.
