THE AUTHOR TO THE READER.
Receive here beloved Reader, a short Poetique discourse, which I have
selected and translated, from amongst the rest of the works of Dv'BARTAS: as a
viue mirror of this last and most decreeped age. Here shall thou see clearlie,
as in a glass, the miseries of this wavering world: to wit, the cursed nature
of mankind, and the heavy plagues of God. And specially here may thou
learn not to flatter thy self, in cloaking thy odious vices, with the
delectable color of virtue: an error, allace, over common in this
hypocritical age, not only in particular men of all degrees: but even
generally in ranks, estates, and offices. But that this Treatise may seem
the les obscure unto thee, I have insert before the same, the Authors Praeface
and Exord of the whole work, that thereby thou may rightly conceive the
coming in of this portion thereof. And in case thou find as well in this work,
as in my LEPANTO following, many incorrect errors, both in the dytement and
orthography, I must pray thee to accept this my reasonable excuse, which is
this. Thou considers, I doubt not, that upon the one part, I composed these
things in my very young and tender years: wherein nature, (except she were a
monster) can admit no perfection. And now on the other part, being of riper
years, my burden is so great and continual, without any intermission, that
when my ingyne and age could, my affairs and fasherie will not permit me, to
re-mark the wrong orthography committed by the copiars of my vnlegible and
ragged hand, far les to amend my proper errors: Yea scarslie but at stolen
moments, have I the leisure to blenk upon any paper, and yet not that, with
free and vnuexed spirit. Always, rough and unpolished as they are, I offer
them unto thee: Which being well accepted, will move me to have the
presenting unto thee, of my APOCALYPSE, and also such number of the PSALMS as I
have perfited: and encourage me to the ending out of the rest. And thus
(beloved Reader) recommending these my labors to thy freindlie acceptance: I
bid thee hartelie Farewell.

TO THE KING OF SCOTLAND.
Where others hooded with blind love do fly,
Low on the ground with buzzard CVPIDS wings,
A heavenly love, from love of love thee brings,
And makes thy MUSE to mount above the sky.
Young Muses be not wont to fly too hie,
Age taught by time, such sober ditties sings,
But thy youth flies from love of youthful things,
And so the wings of time does ouerflie.
Thus thou disdainst all worldly wings as slow,
Because thy MUSE with Angels wings does leave
Times wings behind, and CVPIDS wings below,
But take thou heed, least Fames wings thee deceive.
With all thy speed from Fame thou can not flee,
But more thou flees, the more it follows thee.
HENRY CONSTABLE.

SONET TO THE ONLY ROYAL POET.
WHere shall the limits lie of all your fame?
Where shall the borders be of your renown?
In East? or where the Sun again goes down?
Or shall the fixed Poles impale the same?
Where shall the pillars which your praise proclaim
Or Trophies stand, of that exspected crown?
The Monarch first, of that triumphant town
Reuiues in you, by you renewes his name.
For that which he performd in battles bold,
To us his books with wonders does unfold.
So we of you far more conceive in mind,
As by your verse we plainly (Sir) may see.
You shall the writer and the worker be,
For to absolve that CAESAR left behind.

TO THE KINGS MAJESTY OF SCOTLAND.
IF ALEXANDER sighed when he came,
Unto the Tomb where fierce ACHILLES lay:
If he had cause, that blessed age to blame,
Since HOMER lacks his merits to display.
If he with tears his sorrovves did bewray,
To see his Father PHILIP conquer all,
And that more Worlds behind there did not stay,
Which for revvard of his deserts might fall:
Then may I moan, our times, our judgment small,
Unworthy records of your sacred skill:
Then must our Poets on new Muses call,
To grant them gifts to imitate your quill.
I like the fly, that burns in the flame,
Should show my blindness to attempt the same.
HENRY LOK.

THE EXORD, OR PREFACE OF THE SECOND WEEK OF DVBARTAS.
THou mighty God that of the world
The birth did make me see,
Unfold her cradle also now,
Her childhead show to me:
And make my Spreit to walk athort
The turning flourisht ways
Of sauorie Gardens, wherinto
Still crook't but any stays
Of Rivers four the courses quick:
Declare me what offense,
From Eden both chased ADAMS self
And seed for his pretense:
And tell who of immortal did
Himself a mortal macke
To bring from heaven the Antidote
To us which we did lack:
Give thou me grace the story of
The Church to sing aright,
And als the story of the Kings,
And grant that by thy might
I guide the world unto her grave,
My purpose making lest,
Even from the first of Sabboths all,
Unto the hind most rest.
Well know I that this surgie sea,
Is lacking march or ground,
But o thou holy Pilote great,
Will guide me safe and sound
Unto the port of my desire,
Where drouked then I shall
Extol thy mercies manifold,
And pay my vows withal.
O SACRED Floure-delis whose youth
Does promise to us all,
That even thy famous Laurels green
Match Alexanders shall,
Since that (for to obey thy will,)
I fly unto the skies,
Conuoy my course with loving eye,
And help the faults that rise
From my too blunted frutelesse pen,
In Pampeloun so someday,
Mot thou win home thy crown again,
The which was rest away:
So of thy neighbors evermore
Mot thou the honor be,
The love of all thy subjects true,
And foes to fear for thee:
So never mot the heaven against
Thee show his wrathful face,
But the Eternal be thy arm,
His Spirit thy guiding trace:
So with my shearing sword in hand
And fighting at thy side,
Mot I ore-cled with blood and stoure
So boldly by thee bide
As for to cleave the Spanish Host,
Or force some sieged Town,
The combat done for Virgill serve
To publish thy renown.
GOD did not only (sovereign Prince)
The whole command bestow,
On our forefather ADAM of
This earth, and all below:
In making subject to his yoke
The skealie swimming race,
Who with their little sins do cleave,
The frothie Seas apace:
And those that have no other hold,
But horror of deserts:
And those that bricoll through the waist
Of air that fedders parts:
But chus'd him als a dwelling place,
Which happy was, and more
With climat temperate and fair,
The which the deintie flore
With variant ameling paimented
Of springing flowers most sweet,
Adornd with Pomons fruicts, and als
With Zephyrs smells repleet:
Where God himself did level just,
The allees with his line,
Ore-couered all the hills with trees,
With Haru'st the valleys syne,
And with the sound of thousand brooks
Adiornd the sweetest sleep
Made cabinets fair at proof of Sun
Which out his beams did keep:
He squared a yard, and als he did,
Plant, clenge, and labor syne
The everliving fairness of
A fertile Orchard fine:
The Sacred Rivers courses als
He parted here and there,
And with a thousand coulors paints
The face of Meddowes fair.
THE TRANSLATORS INVOCATION.
O Thou that mightily does toone
My warbling holy Harp,
And does sublime my Poem als
That I thereon do carpe,
And marying so my heavenly verse
Unto the Harpes accords,
Inspires my sacred Muse to sing
Unto the Lord of Lords.
O now inflame my furious Spreit,
That furiously I may
These Furies (mankinds plagues allace!)
With furious Pen display:
That I his fame do not betray,
Who Azure Sky does deck
With blazing lights, and on the earth
His Trophies does erect:
The love of Heaven, the honor of earth,
The wonder of our age,
Who whill that furious bloody MARS
Does in his Country rage
(Alluring ORPHEUS) with his songs
He sweetly does inchaunt
The MUSES nine to leave their leeds
That they before did haunt
And take them to his vulgar tongue,
Their Ethnique heads withal
He crowns with holy twists and fair
Of LIBAN Cedres tall.
Then o thou guider of my Spreit,
And leader of my pen,
Grant, that as he his subject fair
Does (liberal) to me len,
That so he len his lofty style,
His golden draughts, his grace,
Wherewith in variant coulors he
Adornes the papers face,
That I may viuelie paint him forth:
Peace PAN, peace prattling Muse,
Hear PHOEBVS in a borrowed tongue
His own discourses use.
THE FVRIES.
WHere am I carried to? in world
No more may I be found:
The earth that I do tread upon,
And all this vaulted round,
Which bringing home, and guiding back
The days and nights again,
Be wrathful now with me, reguides
My longsum woe and pain:
The air I breath by longest draughts,
The Sea I swim into,

The work most glorious lo.
This wretched roundnes can not be
The plenteous world no more,
Which God with orn'ments bravely decked,
So diverse and in store:
No, this is but a Prison vile,
A Hell fulfild with fray,
And of the first world but the tomb
Most miserable always.

That in thy justice maid,
(Transformd from father myld in Judge:)
This changement that I said,
Change me, and cast me over again,
Addres my feeble hand,
And make that into my discourse
No humane thing may stand.
That I thy instrument may be,
And eloquently syne,
To our posterity may sing
This doolefull change of thine.
BEFORE our first fore-father had,
Too impudentlie bold,
His back turned unto God, his face
Unto the Serpent old:
Even all this WHOLE, was like unto
Ane instrument in toone,
Well set, and well accorded just:
And when as that was done,
So learn'dlie played on, as the sound
Most rarely dulce always,
Proclaimed the praise of God, who on
The same did freedonne ay.
The man in serving God, was served
Of all the world apace:
The bodies dead and living als,
Did strive in every case
To nourish still that holy peace,
And with ane ardent love,
To please their double head, each other
Embrast for that behoue.
The lowest of a concord blessed
Resounded with the hie,
The wak with dry, the cold agreed
With that which hottest be.
And syne that sacred innocent,
The bright ASTREA Queen,
It fastened fast with mastik firm,
Of holy love that been.
This CUPID hid, that mary's yet
By straitest bonds and old
The Adamant stone with heavy yrne,
Quicksilver with the gold:
The Ambre with the straw or chaff,
And in the wauie reign,
PIN with her spy, the Whaile with her
That guides her through the Maine:
That makes the Sperge so freindlie with
The bosse and trembling Reed,

With boughs that wine do breed.
That makes the earie Bustard with
The galliard horse confether,
And the Parroquets painted makes
With Wolves to live together.
That ioynes the Moore-hen with the swift
And feirie futted Heart,
The Goat with Sargone, Partrichis
With Does into ane part:

A shadow and a trace,
Of such a love as raignd into
The formest age allace:
Where as our Muses low from heir
With most harmonious sounds,
Deuinely sang with them above
Into the circled rounds.
But Man as being the special, and
The most resounding string

Of toone does with it bring
The rest of brangling sinews all,
As now it render macks,
In place of sweet enchanting air,
So great and murmuring cracks,
As ENYON makes astonished quyte,
Even cruel ENYON who
The old debaits of CHAOS does
Renew with greener woe.
The Heaven that ever fair did blincke
Upon his maistresse ay,
That naught but MAN and Honny in
Her breast did power always,
Now sweeps her with his floods, and with
His ice her dosinnis quyte,
And beatis her with his haill, and gaigs
Her with his fires in spyte:
And with his snow does make her old,
And ielouslie does darde,
Both night and day upon her bones,
His thundering fyerie farde.
And RHEA that does birst for spyte,
And cholere in these days,
A thousand vapors black against
The Heaven now does she raise:
And by the port half open of
The gulf profound and how,
Does sudle all his brow with clouds,
And mists that of her grow.
The Cock sensyne does with his voice
The Lion bold effray,
The Glead, the Chicken: and the Sheep,
That baisdlie trembles ay,
Flees from the rau'ning Woolfe: and in
Great NEPTVNES fleeting plain,
The Lobster fears for Polipus:
And Polipus again
For Congre-Eels fears: and neerthelesse,
The self same Lobster to
Ouercums this Eele, who victor is,
Even of her victor lo:
Yea, even do, by a secret MARS,
Most noisome quarrels ludge
In very senseless stocks of plants,
Reteining still their grudge.
Thou DENIS, evermore a child,
O Father sleepie still,
If plant beside the leauie keall
Thy fertile stock they will,

And paile grown all his leaves,
For spite, or fear, by flight himself
From neighbourhead such bereaues.
As in like manner, to revenge
The branches bearing wine,
Near Rue, and Origane, planted keal,
By them is killed syne.
The tree Dodonean, and the tree
By ATTIQVE land beloved,

Remaining vnremooued
Even in their widow holes. O thou
Invincible debate,
That makes the one, ne live can, where
The other lived of late:
That reigns into the very tomb,
Does to the PARQVES resist,
And never does thy hatred wash
In floods of LETHES mist.

A simple muttons skin,
Does burst affraidlie, only at
The sound and rattling dinne
Of bloody ravening Woolfs-skinne: And
Sick-like the trypes well thrown
Of that so glutton brigand, breaks
With secret force unknown
The guts of sheep: whom in the place
Of longsome bleating still,

A sweet Lute speak at will.
And of the royal Egle als
The strange devouring plume,
Does wondrously the feathers of
All other fowls consume.
The Heaven, first mobile, with the self
Does carry and remove
More swifter far then any wind,
By this his course above
The rest of all the heavens: backdrawing
Their Torches giving light,
From ALEXANDERS Alters, to
The Pillars HERCULES pight.
But mortal ADAM, as the king
Of all things here belaw,
He being straied, unto the way
Of death does all things draw:
And, blinded Pilot, on a Sea
Most deadly and in fire,
This worlds Ship guides against the rocks
Of furious heavenly ire:
Which softly sliding of before,
Was fleeting ever still,
Both vnder-a skillful Skipper, and
A Zephyre calm at will.
For or he did revolt, he could
Not cast his wondering eyes
Upon no part, but through it all
Almighty God he sees.
He finds him in the earth, as to
The Seas, he feels him there,
Contemplats him in Heaven, and sees
Him painted in the air.
Our world was nothing, but a great
Large Shop, that open stood,
Where magnifiquelie God displaid
His treasures fair and good.
This WHOLE was but a mirror fair,
Which bright on every side,

With great God that does bide.
But man unhappy can not find,
Since this his sin and fall,
Plant, stone, or living creature,
Yard, wood, nor flood at all,
Plain, Field, Hill, Dale, Sea, Shore, or Haven,
Where he may draw his breath,
That has not written into the brow
The hard doom of his death.

This Fabrique large and round,
Is but a very storehouse of
Gods wrath that does abound.
Man, in rebelling thus against
The sovereign great, I say,
Does feel his subjects all enarm'd
Against him every way.
The air by winds sturr'd, AMPHITRITE
Does stormy make a gild,

With brierie thorns fulfild,
As fredd now from the oath of their
Fidelity and trust,
The honor do revenge on him
Even of the Godhead just.
The influence malign of stars,
Coniured does provide,
A secret Hangman for to plague,
His arrogance and pride.

Her brother rosts him quite,
The air, when he looks for it least,
Pursues him in a spite.
By brimstoned thunders, and by raines,
By blasting of the corns,
By frosts confirmd, hair-rimmes, and Snowes,
And hailstones sharp as thorns.
And VVLCANE whiles fallin out of Heaven,
Whiles irritate by art,
Whiles kindled under richest roofes
By chance in any part,
Whiles vom'd out of a mountain, whose
Tempestuous gulf has store,
Both of Saltpeeter and of Pitch,
And Brimstone biting sore,
Does rage against him: startling still,
For fury, as appears,
And wrackes in less space then a day,
The labour-of thousand years.
The Sea by her debording steals
His Isles from him withal,
His flocks vp-swallows, and ore-whelmes,
His towns and makes them fall.
The Earth all weary on her face
Such burden for to keep,
(A burden cursed and profane,)
Whiles sinks in darkest deep
A whole great country, and withal,
The windy tops and hie
Of proudest Palices, into
Her entrails hid they be.
IT IS in hatred even of him,
That after many ways,
She does ingratelie barren haru'sts
Produce us now a days.
And for the corn, that we do sow,
(Deceitful) does us pay
With thirsles burning corn, and with
The vaprous Darnell ay.

With sticking Burres and rough,
And guylefull hope of Windle-stray,
That Is but an empty slough.
All this were little, if that, as
Stepmother cruel, sho
Would not produce the Wort-berrie,
Our furious enemy. Lo
The Hen-bane black, and Ches-bow als,
That cold-ryfe does us keep

And makes us ever sleep.
The stonnishing Carpase, Humlocke als,
That smores us by his might,
Yee-feet, Yce-hands, and makes us isk,
And dims our clearest sight.
Sardonien Percell, Sennon-drawer,
And with a laughing cheer,
The Wolfe-bane, Burne-toung, swelling lips,
And crying still with here.

The Ixia binding sore,
Sad hearted Flacke-wort, fosterer of
Hydropsie more and more.
March-Lillies als, that yeukars be,
Of flancks the gnawers rude,
The Mandragore full cold, and Ew,
That kendles up the blude.
Plants, who do by their root, their suck,
Or by their little seed,

The time unto us breed.
The Earth that knows we love (as we
Were bred, of brutish kinds,)
Our life less, and our honor, then
Her metals hid in minds:
She with her hooks, deceitfullie,
Does mix for us and mell
The scumme of Silver and Arsnicke:
With cruel poison fell
Our inward parts deuours: and so
Does justly punish right
Our covetous lusts with torments sharp,
That she makes on us light.
So as, whiles, from one only mind,
They (foolish) draw apace,
The tortour of soul, and martring of
Our body both, allace.
And what more shall I say? but that
A Pilot full of skill,
And aided by the breathing of
A friendly wind at will,
He cannot with less travel guide
The winged fleeting Ship,
That softly on the azure salt
Of humide field does slip.
And that the jugler fine, so well
Can no ways make to dance,
Make skarmushes, run, and retire,
And syne again advance
His little Marmosets, whom to
His avarice does give
A Sprite, that by the only art
And workmanship does live,
As we most happy did command
The silent flocks, that do,
All skalie, cleave the stormy fluds,
That they do swim into:
And all the flying songsters sweet,
And the rebellious bands,
That rush out through the woods, or runs
Athwart the bairest lands:
And at the wind even of our voice,
They trembled fast afraid,
And each wink of our eyes, to them
A law was they obaid:
And to their holy office so
They bent were night and day,
As even they uncommanded did
Us service every way.

Our Parents light among,
Alas, they of our slaves are now
Become our tyrants strong:
The fearful hideous Whale, if that
We sail upon the Maine,
In weltring with a stroke, even all
At once, the bulluring plain,
Does bury underneath the waves
Our fleeting Castle fair,

And Eagle in the air.
And if we go into the feilds,
So many deadly bands
Of spotted venoms, and of Pests
Cyniphien, on all hands
Do lie into embuscade dern'd.
The Wolf on other side,
With Lion, Sanglier, and with Beer
And Leopard does abide,

Against their head conspire,
And pitielesse tear him, in revenge
Of the eternal ire.
The Forests thick, they have no bush,
Nor thicket great at all,
That does not hide a hangman, to
Give us our death and fall.
We every cauerne do suspect, and
Every hedge we see,
The smallest branch, that stighles, makes
Us sore afraid to be.
If that, we dwelling be at home,
The spiteful Mastie bold,
The Bull wood-headed, and the Horse,
Whose courage cannot fold,
With teeth, with horned brow, and with
Their feet do make us war
Most sorry: seeing Tyrants such
On earth, promenney darre.
No: There is not so small a midge,
That boldly against us cleene,
Will spare to shoot the arrows of
His little fury keen.
ALAS: what hideous fraisome shapes?
What horrible ghosts I see?
What thundering loud? what roaring cries?
What terrible howlings hie?
Am I not on the elrish Shore
Of PHLEGETON, braying in Hell?
O TISIPHON, MEGERE, ALECTO als,
Thou fury sad and fell,
What den makes you the cauernes quite
Most fraisome and profound
Of darkest Hell? o monsters most
Abominable under ground,
Ye Ministers of PLVTO, with
The thrown and stormy brow,
O Daughters of the shadie night,
What here then do ye now?
The man alas, without your cross,
Your whips and tortours sore,
Does he not feel the horrors else
Of pains anew, and more?
For our fore-beer, no sooner left
The sacred soil of grace,
To live into this earth, or rather
Tomb and lowest place,
Where reigns a thousand deaths, when as
The voice eternal ay,

That guilty were always.
That Sulphurd STYX and PHLEGETON, drinks
All burning in a fire,
Thick ACHERON, and COCYTE als,
All in a bloody ire.
O Sisters with the eddrie hair
O Eumenids cruel ye,
What? Of your selves for evermore,
Will ye the tortourers be?

Your cursed houses paile,
Come vomit here your poisons black
In this unhappy veil.
Have ye no fear to languish here,
For exercises lake,
For ADAM builds you a hundredth Hels
Here for his vices sake
FROM top to bottom eat these words
AVERNE all trembled apace:

Redouble in every case.
And als that stinking goulfe, where fraies
Do reign for evermore,
Was sudden filled with pitch, with Sulphre,
And rozen in great store.
The GORGONES, SPHINX, and HYDRAES, and
The Pythons, monsters rair,
The cauerns deep did open of
Their glutton bellies their:
Even as the fire that hid into
A vapor thick remains,
Does grudging murmr at the cloud,
That pressing it retains,
Does Cannon, thunder, astonish als,
And whirling long in round,
Does, wrathful, make the Element
That windy is, resound.
Even so, these Sisters three, these three
Most hideous rages vile,
Do raise a thousand tempests, boun
To leave their hell a while.
And each of them already goes,
And hurles his yrnie cart,
Upon the Bridges bars of yrne,
Ay brangling on all part.
That nine times Planks Stix, and in prison
Where horrible darkness tumbles,
With braying, running, wandering still,
Most terrible horrible rumbles.
Then fraifull HYDRE, and CERBERE als,
That muttin makes a stir,
Who on one body has the heads,
Both of a Mastich curre,
A Serpent, Bull, and of an Ounce,
Whose cruel eyes do pearce,
And of a Woolfe, a Horse, a Bear,
And of a Lioness fearce.
With brangle of lights does bark, does whisle,
And route does evermore,
Make murmuring, loudlie howl and bray,
And rummish fast and rore.
Such Pell-mell dinnes, and ringing reards,
And tempests strange to hear,
Do from one corpse proceed at once,
That many heads does bear.
Then having of our day atteind
Unto the calmed port,
Then wings of Aquilo they with
A whirre more sudden short

Sore tortring they assay,
Who cruellest pains can forge for him
To suffer every way.
OF ATROPOS the very shape,
Lo, Hunger comes at ones,
Her blackned skin is pierced with
The sharp points of her bones:
She ever greedy longing gants,
With hollow suncken eye,

And in her mouth they see
Her wide-set teeth come Saffron hewed:
Her empty bowels clear,
Do through the rinckles of her skin
Transparantlie appear.
And for her belly, has she naught
Of belly but the place,
Her knees and elbows hidelesse on

A monster most insatiable,
Whom to, but for a fill,
All that is living here below,
But skarcelie suffice will.
Her swallowing throat goes seeking still
Her meat in very meats:
One dish another summonds, and
Her gourmand entrails eats,
And toomes at once. The very flesh

May skantlie stanch her raging lust,
Thus of her hunger sprung:
But even sometimes (o gluttony
Of strangest sort and rare)
To fill her foule-some guts, to eat
Her guts she does not spare:
That she thereby, may make it more,
She makes her body less,
And to our father cruel so,
She does her self address.
And furthermore, from hels she brings
Unto this combat here,
The rage, the weakness, and the thrist,
Her likest sisters dear.
THE war comes after, bruzing laws,
And bruzing manners all,
Loue-teares, shed-blood, and burning Innes,
And raizing every wall:
In-under his brazen feet, the earth
All creepes and trembles fast,
His mouth it is a fiery coal,
His voice a thunders blast:
Each finger of his hand, it is
A Cannon that does bray,
And every awful look of his
A lightning flaming ay.
The great disorder, and the fray,
Despair, and flight, do post,
And winged ever, go before
His cruel murdering Host:
As burnings, and the swelling pride,
And great impiety vile,
The quarrelous scisme, sack, and all
Impunitie for a while.
The cruelty, the horror, the
Destruction and ruin,
Though all accompany him, whereas
He barbrous marches syne.
The doole, the solitarines, with
The poverty that peeps,

Undaunted following keeps.
AND if that I be not deceau'd,
Another fury lo
That does a battrie dress against
Our first forefather to,
Of thousand thousand Cannons, I
Hear, feel, though not in sight,
The more that she is weak, the more
Has she of force and might:

And foolish is she nam'de.
Sad, deaf, crooke-backed, and of legs
And arms, both is she lam'de.
The poison with the many names,
Deaths minister alace,
That comes at posting gallope, and
Returns at slowest pace.
Il-fauoured, troubling rest, and als
Fantastike, miserable eke,

Insatiable blood does seek
The daughter of intemperance, and
Of Heaven misorder'd cleene,
A cruel evil discouerd, but
More cruel hid unseen.
IN SUMMER Meidowes, Grasshoppers
Have not so many above,
So many Creikets under, as did
Infernal voices move,

A calmed Heaven and still,
The King enamailed of the people,
That gather Honnie will:
So many little buzzing burds
Guides not, when he does cast
Even of his little hollow ludge
The first foundations fast,
As this effraying monster has
Of Soldats at command,
That raging charge the man abaisd
At every part and hand.
So as a regiment incensed,
And horrible giving fraies,
Now for to yoke a skarmish hot,
The first of all assaies
Against ADAMS head, which is the house
Most holy hallowed ay,
Of all the faculties of the soul,
And reasons forth, and stay.
A King that neighbor will bereave
Another Kings Empire,
Before he fight into the feilds,
Or open wars desire,
He first corrupts by richest gifts
His Counsels truth at length,
Well knowing that a Counsel good
Is of a King the strength.
Even so, this Fury banished from
The CHAOS dark and low,
Do for Forerinners, Frenzy,
And Madness als let go:
Whereof the one in heating much,
The other drying sore
The weak brains, they do stop the course,
And blunt do more and more
The sharpnes of man's judgment, and
Engrauing makes remain
(Abusers) in the Spreit, a Squadre
Of CHIMERS fancies vain.

LETHARGY sleeping ay,
As casten of hazarders, assailes
Their foe the best they may,
At former part, but yet by arms,
That are contrary clean,
For making yci-colde the brains,
His brethren dosened been,
And makes the living man like to
A dead in every sort,

Do not repasse the port.
The Palsy else does undertake
A war and battle bold,
Else Spasmus sturres, the one does slack,
The other strait does hold
The Senewes of weak ADAM, else
They do the passage dit,
Unto the living subtle Spreits,
That would go down by it.

And only man to man
Com'd to a Combat set, assaies
All kind of wards he can,
Eschewes, rebaits, strikes out, and does
Observe his times aright,
And casting whiles, does make upon
The sparkling eyes to light
Of this his foe his clock, syne with
The far end of his blead,

In gushing streams and read.
The sickness, to the end that she
May have the better skair,
Of our forefather tied to bed
(Who scarce can turn him their)
Else with so many bonds she does,
The Ophthalmie let go,
Which with a seething blood within
The sight as cruel so,
Gives thousand stogs, she also breeds
The Pearl upon the eye,
That dimmes the shine, and Cataract,
That dark and cloudie be:
Whereof the one by gathering of
To gross ane humor pight
Within the bright Spreits guider, does
The door close of the light.
The other does as with a cloth,
Envious syle and hide,
The Crystal shining humor, that
Does in his eyes abide.
This done, even with a gird to our
Fore-beer flees withal,
This cruel Dragon merciless,
Whom squeinancy they call:
That scoaps unto his throat, and with
Blood loppred lacking heat,
He having of the how-throat bolle,
The Muskles boldned great:
In him alone does give a proof,
Of his so obstinate strength,
Wherewith he is to fight, against
His future race at length.
Like HERCULES, who when as yet,
In swaddling clothes he lay,
Buire on his brow engrau'd his great
Undaunted courage ay:
Beginning with his hands, no hand
But strongest turkesse else,
Most boldly wraithfull for to smoare
The Dragon bearing shells,
A master stick that promises
The Trophee Lernien sure,
The Spaignoll triumph, and the fur
Cleonien that they bure.
The second regiment sets on
By deadly forces fell,
Beginning with the Squadre of all
The vital parts to mell;

And else that humor gross
Lights-stopper, him ASTHMATIQVE makes
Ay panting in a Cross.
And the Corroziue flowing of
A gutter dropping slow,
His spongious lights does vlcerate, and
Him dries cum'd Ptisick so.
The Peripneumonie withal
A hot consuming braize,

And heat does kendle and raize.
And als the pitiless Empiem does
Him sease among the rest,
With an Apostume filling up
The howest of his breast.
And furthermore the Pleurisy
Does brod him in the sides,
In making ever boil that blood
Which under his ribs abides.

With thickest fleume does he,
As Spreit importune, heavy, press
His breast that panting be.
MY GVIDE Urania oracle
That chassis errors vain,
Name me this warrior trembling ay,
For fury and disdain.
And whose enarmed hand does not,
With fiery torch assail,
The wings but even the armies heart
And over it does prevail.
Who for her campions has the Cough,
The irkesum ganting lo,
The Souning swerfis, thrist, shuddering, and
The colde-rife trembling to.
The bating of the pulse, the heat,
The rauing strange withal
And pain of head. O is not this
The fury whom we call
The burning perrilous Fever, who
Inconstantlie does take
Mo faces then VERTVMNVS, and
Who (fine) her self can make
Continual whiles, whiles tierce, whiles quart,
And whiles but for a day,
Whiles slow, whiles kindled up, even as
The matter as they say
Which in our feeble bodies is
The cause of all this change,
Has slow, or promptlie ready has
This secreet motion strange.
Well ought I for to know thee, o
Thou traitrous mastish vile,
Who four years had thee in my heart,
For hostess all the while.
So as I bear as yet even of
Thy greatest force, allace,
The marks into my soul, and in
The body many a trace.
For leaving that thou soucked out,
And cruelly did seek
The blood out of my veins, and of
My bones the Marrey eik,
I of my Spreit the virtue feel
All slokened to be fall,
The vigor of my Spreit cum'd gourd,
The sharpnes blunted all.
And als my memory, the which
Was somewhat yet before,

The water, where a score
Is als sone vanished quite as drawn.
Yea, surely, I almost
My former studies, to my shame,
And greatest grief, have lost.
And als my Spreit a Table like,
That void, has but a frame,
Like Coruin, Trapesuntius, or
Like Gaze, forgot my name,

Most facond hand and pen,
Did teach the Roman language to
The very Roman men.
And for that cause in spite of my
Most careful studies ay,
My verse are feuerous now become,
By habitude always.
Verse, sometimes animated, with
A fury most divine,

Unlearned coldness syne.
BUT OF the Regiment that is third
The cruel Squadres fall,
Unto the quarter, that conteines
The virtues natural all:
The virtues that do piece and piece
Most happily procure,
Als-well our nourishment, as our
Vp-growing always sure.
The Boulime whiles, whiles lacks of meat
Through ANOREXIA will,
Dog-hunger whiles, whiles lies his meat
Through BRADIPEPSIA still.
Whiles she that makes the appetite,
So monstrous and so great,
In how parts of our stomach, does
She take her lodging seat.
Then after with the Liver does
The saffrond Gulsoch fight,
For having stopped way to the Gall
Chollerick, by his might
He does his kindled venom skaill
Throughout the corpse. (In place
Of finest blood.) which outwardly
Turns yeallow hewed apace.
In contrare doufe Hydropsie makes
Him like for cold to sterue,
Whill time it make the Fleume in place
Of purest blood to serve.
But I the sliddrie bowels see
Below (allace) by foes
Assaild, that are a thousand times
Far mutinaire then those:
The Colic with her preson'd winds
Breids them a raging pain,
The dolor Iliack does throw
Them sore, most inhumaine
Does stop their purging conduits, and
Detestable she makes
Even of manns mouth a pestilent
And filthy stinking jakes.
The read dissenterie all enarmd
With throwings sore again,
Does painefullie draw out the blood
Of many an opned vain.
The Stony gravel does the neares
On other part invade,
By gathering of an humor, which
The rigor of heat has made

(Malicious) without more
The sliddrie vreter, carier of
Salt urine skalding sore,
Even as the Diabete does, by
The contrair louse at last
The grease of all our body in
The urine seething fast,
And causing thirst, distills as much,
As all the matter may,

The gutter running ay.
And to the members that us makes,
For ages following here,
Leave of our bodies dead, so quick
And many Mirrours clear,
Yoakes fiercely the unableness
To live in VENUS law:
And the continual flowing of
The seed unripe and raw.

To leese and to destroy
The vnconceaued Babes thereby,
Their Parents to anoy.
THE SQADRE fourt, wherein the Chouks,
As Soldats do remain,
The vile devouring Cancer, and
The Gout a cruel pain,
Together with the Hyues, and with
The boudned Oedems clear,

A hundredth brags with bear
Unto the place assieged, and syne,
Their blind rage does them make,
Because they cannot harm the fort,
The plain field for to sack.
From hand in sheath o cruel foes,
Your mightlesse Swords let fall,
The death a thousand times has both
Of blood and senews all,
Bereft your foe, and naught the less,
Without all hold or stay
Your pitilesse hand his beauty does
Dishonor every way
His members all makes laidlie, and does
With blunted knife begin
To saw his joints, and Leiths, and for
To hacke his wrinckled skin.
I think I see into the midst
Of wild and open lands,
Of Wolves, and subtle Foxes als
The cruel crafty bands,
Who having on the softest Sand,
By chance of meeting found
The Lion streaked, who on live
Commanded all the ground,
And whose most horrible austrun face
(Retaining former spite)
Did melt a far, even with his beams,
Their former boldness quite:
They (cruel) tear him, and against
Their King that is deceased,
Affraidly proves, to practice that,
Whereat, they feeblie preased.
Shall I among these dwynings count,
(Whose cruel boldness fell,
Seems, as it were, with outward scroofe
Of vexed man to mell?)
The ouglie lousy Phtiriase: o
The shameful plague and vile,

Their Beggars all the while:
Who clad with clouts, and eaten up
With Vermin ever still:
Both night and day, for yeuking are
Compelled to fidge their fill.
Kings swarming all with Lice, when as
The rubbing cannot stay,
Nor yet often changed beds can give
Them slaiking any way.

Are sliding after Waves:
So swarm does follow after swarm,
Their flesh too fertile craves
His own deuourers to produce,
And whill spent be the blood,
It of it self the self does make
The execrable food.
But what? Think not that Fortune blind,
Whose turning Wheel still slides.

Confus'dlie pell-mell guides:
I of her Soldats see, who as
Conducted well by reason,
Makes choice, as well of nature, age,
As of the quartered season,
The Portugal is bruddie so,
In Phtisiques as we see,
The Ebre in Chouks, the Arne in those
That Epilepticke be:

Goitrous does abound,
In pest-folkes Sardine, Lepruse are
In Egypt many found.
The places manners like, or the
Strong influence aloft
Of mighty Heaven that gouerns all.
So tender childhood soft,
Is gnawn with Worms, the children that
Their rawnes gender will,
And for their weakness hes their womb,
That loose runs ever still:
The Skall upon their head does of
Their saltest fleumes proceed.
They for a time bear many a blybe,
Of worssome that does breed
Even of the menstruall humor, which
As new wine raging fast,
In seething in the body, makes
A plouckie skin at last.
The youth into Hemorragie
Most easily does fall,
In Fevers hot, in Dwinings, and
In Phrenesie withal.
And feeble age has commonly
For his too irksome Hosts,
The coldrife bloodlesse shakings, and
The fashious coughing hoasts,
Katharres and Gouts. So likewise the
Sciaticke, hard to mend
The Fever, that the humor of
Melancholy does send.
The bloody fluxis, Pests, and als
The watrie swelling great,
Are nurished with us when weak
Autumnus brooks his seat.
The Fike, the Skab, the Langour als
Of ALCIDE does us take,
And raging charge us in the spring,
That both is hot and wake.
And then the Diarrhee, with the
Hot-euill, a seeknes sore,

In Summer evermore.
As Pleurisy, the host and rheum
Do seeldome make repair,
But covered with the whitest flocks
Of heavenly feathers fair,
And Soldiers sweirlie keeping home
Into the house do hold
Of gelded son to aigit yeir,
Their garnison full cold.

Delight but in a throng)
Vnleauing of the first from corpse
To corpse to slide along,
As the Ameriquain, and als
The Leprosy, and Byle,
The Phtisie, mesels, and the pests
Red Charbucle and vile.
And further some I see, which for
Sadd heritage, allace,

From age to age embrace.
The Choakes and Goitre both into
That rank they ever stood,
The Gout, the Gravel, Leprosy,
With all that spilles the blood,
Rumbursnes, white Hydropsie als,
The languishing Ptisie eik,
The Epilepsie dead withal,
Bred of a vaprous reik.

Venom unespied,
Is to the flowing Sperma of
Their fathers surely tied.
But o allace: what stratagems,
What strongest arms can we
Now use against those warriors, who
Deceatfull traitors be.
I mean these traitorous pains whom art,
As most imperfite knows
Not by the name, but only by,
Effects that thereof grows.
Such as the suffocation of
The bruddie matrice quick,
The Swowning wan, and skunnering evil
That skailles conuentions thick.
When as a vapor, I know not what,
Long kept close I trow,
Into, I know not what a part,
It does, I know not how.
Can he eschew the cruelties
Fulfild with crafty wyles
Of those so obstinate ills, who are,
Abusers by their gyles
Of cunning med'ceners hands, and who
Once from the body chased,
Are in the half dead members under
An other name replaced.
Or rather Scholars even of the
Fond Metempsichosis strange.
Teacht by that SAMIEN learnd. The one
Does metamorphosd change
In far worse ill. Cum'd either of
Th'affinity that does lie,
Twixt fattish humors or betwixt,
The members vexed thereby:
Or else through the vnlearnd abuse,
Or the malicious greed,
Of those that of Apollos art,
Are practisers indeed.

And changd is every way
In Falling-ill, the Rage into
Lethargy sleeping ay.
The constitution ill into,
Hydropesie full cold,
The Slee-ping dulnes often transformed
In Palsy does us hold.
Short ADAM like a Heart is who
Does in a wodds nuik stay,

Is at the latter bay
All teared with lyam-hounds, whom of
The one does bite his back,
One pulles his flank, an other at
His breast does bussie snack:
One scoupes unto his throat, and one
His fouch is loath to leave
One holds his ear, and one unto
His neck does hinging cleave.

Whose pridefull horn does egg,
The sleeprie biting little swarms
Of many a spiteful cleg:
Who bumming do come out, and their
Assailer do assail,
And valiantly do on his skin
Their Squadre camp and nail,
The Bull does with his forked head,
The winds beat every where,

His sides beats here and there.
And flying longs both forests, rocks,
And forcie streams and clenches,
The place where he received his hurt,
But not his hurts eschewes.
In end, with needels ouercled,
Behoues him to be slain,
Or at the least as dead into
That place for to remain.
For man he is invaded with
A thousand langors sore,
And every other living thing
It gets a proof no more
But of a very few of evils:
The falln-ill only assailes,
The Squadres gatherers of the hot
And the Venerian Quails.
The sheep does fear the skab, and als
The dulling Sturdie still,
The dog-ill, and the Madness they
Oppres the mastish will.
And further, every one of them
Before his birth does bear,
Of strongest simples knawledge such
As they have need to leare.
And never does he feel his evil
Steal near to him so soon,
But he als sone the remedy
Has ready to be done.
For the slow-past Shelpaddock has
The Humlock icie-colde,
To serve for sovereign remedy.
The Ram does rightly hold
The Rhew his counter-poison, and
The Sacred Laurel tree,
For Reubarb serves to Partrich, Merle,
And Gea that painted be,
The Bear for medicine meet for him,
The Mandragore observes.
And the Marcellian crommie for
Lucinas Goats it serves.
But we are ignorant of all,
Even after having had
Acquired in books a knowledge, that
Sophistique is and bad.
An art ay snappring, and withal,
A knowledge quite unknown,
Which never enters but into
The hoarie heads, and thrown

A labor too ingrate,
In seeking others healthes, they leese
Their own, such is their state:
Or rather, who do make themselves,
By others perrils sore,
Full famous Doctors, and by drinks
Vntimous do they store,
And fill with Hillocks the Churchyard,
And lacking fear or shame,

For murders made by them.
I do not speak here of the good,
The learned and the wise,
Into whose hearts, the fear of God
Imprinted deeply lies,
And who do skilfully within
Our bodies stay and tie,
Our spreits of life, that otherwise,
Were ready out to fly:

As heavenly men celest,
Healthes leaning stocks, and bannishers
Of every death and Pest.
Dame Natures counselors, and the
Almighties agents ay,
And Stewards, and Store-maisters wise,
Of flourishing age always.
But if that any pain by art
Of man may slaked be,
These learned learned it have even of
Their College dumme we see:
For we do the Phaebotomie
Of the Sea-horsses take,
Of the wild Goats the Recipeis
That for the eyes we make.
Of Ibis and the Heron we
The Laxatiue clisters have,
Of Bears and Lions the Austere
Great diets we receive.
Now all these Campions fearce they do,
The body but persew.
Some inwardly do make assault,
And outwardly anew:
Or if that any take them to
The soul most pleasant fair,
That no ways is directly but
For that they will not spare
To cross her feeble Officers,
And spoil her worklumes fine,
Whereby she (learned) so many works
Makes subtilie divine.
BUT LO four fearful Captains now,
Whose fury hot assaies,
To dress a battery great against
The Spreit in many ways:
His constancy in a brangle puts,
And promptlie draws apace,
Even from the path of reason quite,
Their judgment blind alace,
Opinions Children who thought they
Invisible be cleine,
Yet they their harmefull motions through,
The bodies makes to sheine.
The first is irksomnes, the which
A drumlie cloud does hold,
And from the crown even of the head
Unto the foot does fold:
Does rauing drant both night and day,
Grows old or age be near,

His face as Furs appear:
And in a dowisome quiet nooke
He careful ever thrists,
Als many sighs out of his breast,
As tears from eyes out brists.
He guides the tarndnesse, which to eat
The self does never fail,
The weeping pity, and withal
The heavy sadness paile:

Straiks blea-hewde beats the sell,
Who with Coals, Aspiks, Tedders als
For Armor meet does mell.
The throwart eied envy withal
Fat of the leanes ay
Of dearest friends, who restleslie
Does gnaw her self away:
Like famisht POLIPVS, who in
Vnhaps does bath her still,

Her wrath does feed and fill.
And als the jelousie, which but
To slumber once does fear,
And ever (most suspicious) has
The Flea into the ear:
And far mo eyes then he who being
By HERMES witcht at last,
Did the Inachien beauty let
Be stolen he sleeping fast.
THE Second Captain sure is joy,
Excessiuelie to glade,
Who skoups, and lightly starties, and
Whom to the street that made
By APPIVS was, to narrow is,
Whose senses all they do
Even at the wishes als enjoy
Most pleasant pleasures to:
Who guides effronted vanterie that
Does ever feign and lie,
A flatterer, and importune, and
That ever crying be:
And pride brow-bender Giant who
Wings on his back does bear,
And with his lofty forhead hits,
The Starrie sylring clear:
And many others like the Bells,
Who boldned in a rain,
Do swelling empty rise upon
The wake and humid plain.
The fear whose sides incessantly
Do bussie beat apace,
Whose bosom has no heart, nor veins
Have blood in any case:
Nor spreit has counsel, yet she daunts
Us quite that feeble dame,
Even with the terror pale, and with
The Land-wart blushing shame:
And swearnesse als at slowest pace
Which ever comes and creepes,
The which with willing yrnes her arms
At all times fastened keeps:
Who lashlie dreams both night and day,
A barren, vndought eik,
A vile paralitique feeble one,
Who begging aid does seek.
And thou o Covetousness the which
The earth, nor yet the air,
Nor sea, or heaven can ever fill
Or stanch thy lusting caire.

For entrailles carries ay,
And clookes for hands, thou fences with
Poor ADAM every way,
Thou does unto the combat bring,
Ambition boudned vain,
That burns in slow and soaking fire,
Whose passion to contain
Or bound in EPICVRVS worlds,
Is bootelesse to essay,

In paintrie carry ay.
Thou brings the greedy Avarice,
Enarmed all with cleekes,
And cled with glue, who never briggs
For her safe passage seeks,
Both through CHARIBDIS baying, and
Through traitrous SYRTES fell,
Who grows the miserabler the more
Her wealth grows with her sell.

Or love, or faith, who will
Her neighbors sorelie harm, but yet
Her self more ever still.
Who puts her hand in every thing,
Moechanicklie too vile.
Like TANTALYS in middst of goods,
Full poor even all the while.
Who nombers never what she has,
But what she lak'th does count,

She hie does never mount.
Thou wrathful contrare ADAM does
Lead forward to the war,
The wrath, the which already goes
Then thunder swifter far.
Who sullen like a Sanglier makes
Her awful teeth to crack,
Her hair starts wouddershunes, and whiles
Her burning eyes does make
To reill, whiles tieth to the ground:
Whose horrible face it will
Whiles paill, whiles fiery, rout with voice
Most wild and elrage still:
The ground stamps with her feet, her hands
On other rash apace:
She poison, fire, and cruel sword,
Into that foming case
Bears in her hand, them for to kill,
Whom syne she does lament,
And lightlies death providing that
Her fellow also went:
Like as a hinging wall which by
The wind louse shaken been,
Does bruze the self on that, the which
Under it all bruz'd is clean.
Thou makes unto the fight to come
Squared arrows bearing love,
Which tyrants painting will I not
After all th'Apellesis prove
That FRANCE has borne, and shortly then,
Beneath thy Standarts fair,
Thou makes als many Soldats else
For to be marching there
As there be verry goods, or for
Resemblance so does trow
The King of beasts who of him self
Is not the master now.
But if these passions that pursewes
And touches us so near,

A glancing lightening clear
Then were it nothing, but allace
They oftentimes do leave
The venomed sting into the soul
Which hurting they deceive:
From that so drumlie spring does flow,
The deadly poisons fell,
The SODOMIES, thefts, and incests,
And treasons vile to tell.

Conspiring, drunkenesse eik,
The Sacrilege, wait-laying, murder,
And Reafe that prays do seek.
Allace these langors (that be worse
Then thousand deaths be far,)
Are different from the langores that
Makes with the body war.
Who are auowedlie enemies,
And by their malice do,

Of healthes attaining to.
Whiles by the brangling pulse, and whiles
Even by their color viue,
Whiles by the stinging needels of
Strong dolor that does grieve.
So as well knowing once the evil,
That does us brook and bind,
It is not too difficill syne,
The remedy to find.

Our understanding reign,
Who only ought and may discern
Of them, they do remain
Unknown at all and for that cause
Does PODALIRIVS stay,
To run to ANTICIRE to get
His health in any way.
And furthermore the Feuerous man,
We feuerous do him call,
Hydropique we hydropique name,
Dissimuling not at all
Inunder the deceatfull masque,
Of fained words the pain
That crewell, does our members with
Her torments sharp demaine.
Contrariwise, the Spreit is of
The self the flatterer ay,
The own skabb claws, and with a style
That liar is always
By cloaking of his vices lets
The Ulcer blind to fear,
The Cautere needles quite for it
Of reason for to hear:
And sure if ever vice did cleith
The self in any where
With the unspotted famous cloak
Of holy virtue fair
It certainly is in our age
Worse by a hundredth fold,
Then when on all the earth the waves
Quite universal rolde.
Of sins discourse I will not that
Are vildest in degree,
Wherewith the bedds infamous of
The greatest spotted be.
For fear that in offending of
The holies tender ear,
I rather seem to teach them then
To wish them to forbear.

Grangores gnawne and deformed,
Bears Woods, fair Meidowes, Castles als
In threads of Gold transformed.
And whose hands prodigal into
Once shifting of the Cairts,
One Iusting proud, one Banquet great,
Do wast with glorious hearts
The treasures gathered by the pains
And niggard travels sore.

Are liberal evermore.
They whose affected going, and
Whose fairded deintie cheeks,
Whose accent all effeminat,
Whose bonnie blincks and keeks,
Whose feeble coward heart and spreit,
Whose soft and souple weed
Declares, that they are only men
Of outward show indeed.

Those who from bed to bed
Like Goat-bucks wander vagabonds,
Whose charming mouths have led
And chaste SVSANNAES tysted half
And ever famisht, flee
To every pray: o surely these
Are Lovers called we see.
They who by false contracts, and by
Unlawful measures do

And princely riches too:
And goes Sophisticating all
The simple strangers ay,
And hundreths do for hundreths lend,
Are Stewards good they say.
Who in reuenges badd desire,
Do ever thrist and burn,
Who bathes themselves in blood, and puts
No difference in their turn
Of rank, of Sex, of age, but still
Most cruel they defile,
Cold blooded into every corpse
Their murdering hands and vile,
Are men of most magnanime spreit.
O would to God that FRANCE
Were void of men of spreit, since that
Our manhead does advance,
And fight for our ilwillers, and
Suckes out our blood apace,
Makes wast our Cities, and does bresh
Our very sides allace.
O would to God the Targe, the Pike,
The Sword might changed be
In ploughs for to mannure the Land.
O shall I never see
The Spiders long and threadie feet
Full busy for to weaue,
Within the hollowest of a healme
Decked with a pennage brave?
But if ye Frenchmen green so fast
To Battles for to go,
And if that awful Ennyon seethes
Into your bowels so,
What gain or profit holds you here,
And makes you stay so long?
Our fields of bestiall void, of wealth
Are all our Cities strong.
Then go ye, run o warlike youth
Whom no distress can dant,
Another Gaulien Greece into
Natolia for to plant:
Go run in Flanders, and do ye
Most merciful relieve
Your brethren Belges from the yoke
Of Spain that does them grieve.
Run unto Portugale, and people
Of new Gallicia now,
And do your names engraue again
In PORT-VLISSES brow.
THus loving Reader as thou sees,
Now have I made an end,
Unto this work which man did write,
But by the Lord is pend:
Wherein as I have preast to make
The Author known to all,
That into Britain I Will remain,
Where he before was thrall
Within the only bounds of France,
So doubt I not thou will
Excuse my blotting of his face,
And blame my lack of skill
Which let me to imitate
His hard and lofty verse,
His arrows headed blunt by me,
As erst could no ways pearce.
But since both profit may herein,
And pleasure reaped be,
Though metamorphos'd all I grant,
And quite transformed by me:
Yet ought thou justly love and like
My painful travels bent,
It is sufficient unto me,
Thou know my good intent.

THE AVTHORS PREFACE TO THE READER.
IT falls out often, that the effects of men's actions comes clean contrary
to the intent of the Author. The same find I by experience (beloved Reader)
in my Poem of LEPANTO: For although till now, it have not been imprinted, yet
being set out to the public view of many, by a great sort of stolen Copies,
purchased (in truth) without my knowledge or consent, it has for lack of a
Praeface, been in some things misco^strued by sundry, which I of very purpose
thinking to have omitted, for that the writing thereof, might have tended in my
opinion, to some reproach of the skillful learnednes of the Reader, as if his
brains could not have conceived so vncurious a work, without some manner of
Commentary, and so have made the work more displeasant unto him: it has by
the contrary falen out, that the lack thereof, has made it the more displeasant
to some, through their mistaking a part of the meaning thereof. And for that I
know, the special thing misliked in it, is, that I should seem, far contrary
to my degree and Religion, like a Mercenary Poet, to pen a work, ex
professo, in praise of a foreign Papist bastard: I will by setting down the
nature and order of the Poem, resolve the ignorant of their error, and make the
other sort inexcusable of their captiousnes. The nature then of this Poem, is
an argument, a minore ad majus, largely entreated by a Poetike comparison,
being to the writing hereof moved, by the stirring up of the league and
cruel persecution of the Protestants in all countries, at the very first
raging whereof, I compiled this Poem, as the exhortation to the persecuted in
the hinmost eight lines thereof does plainly testify, being both begun and
ended in the same Summer, wherein the league was published in France. The order
of the Cantique is this: First, a Poetique Praeface, declaring the matter I
treat of: wherein, I name not DON-IOAN, neither literally nor any ways by
description, which I behooued to have done, if I had penned the whole Poem in
his praise, as VIRGIL, Arma virumque cano, and HOMER, Dic mihi musa virum, of
whose imitatio^ I had not been ashamed, if so my purpose had been framed. Next
follows my invocation to the true God only, and not to all the He and She
Saints, for whose vain honors, DON-IOAN fought in all his wars. Next after my
invocation, follows the poetique History of my comparison, wherein following
forth the ground of a true History, (as VIRGIL or HOMER did) like a painter
shadowing with vmbers a portrait else drawn in gross, for giving it greter
viuenes, so I eike or pair to the circumstaunces of the actions, as the rules
of the poeticke art will permit: which Historicke comparison continues till the
song of the Angels: in the which I compare and apply the former comparison to
our present estate, taking occasion thereupon to speak some what of our
religion. Lastly the Epilogue of the whole in the last eight lines, declares
fully my intention in the whole, and explaines so fullye my comparison and
Argument, from the more to the less, as I cannot without shameful repetition
speak any more thereof. And in a word: what so ever praise I have given to
DON-IOAN in this Poem, it is neither in accompting him as first or second
cause of that victory, but only as of a particular man, when he falls in my
way, to speak the truth of him. For as it becomes not the honor of my estate,
like an hireling, to pen the praise of any man: So becomes it far less the
highness of my rank and calling, to spare for the fear or favor of whomsoever
living, to speak or write the truth of any. And thus craving pardon (beloved
Reader) for this longsome Apology (being driven thereto, not by nature, but
by necessity) I bid you heartily farewell.

THE LEPANTO OF JAMES THE SIXTH, King of Scotland.
I Sing a wondrous work of God,
I sing his mercies great,
I sing his justice heere-withall
Powered from his holy seat.
To wit, a cruel Martial war,
A bloody battle bold,
Long doubtsome fight, with slaughter huge
And wounded manifold.
Which fought was in LEPANTOES gulf
Betwixt the baptized race,

Rencountring in that place.
O only God, I pray thee thrice,
Thrice one in persons three,
Alike Eternal, like of might,
Although distinct ye be.
I pray thee Father, through thy Son,
Thy word immortal still,
The great ARCHANGEL of records
And worker of thy will,

And eik my pen inflame,
Above my skill to write this work
To magnify thy name.
INTO the turning still of times,
I err, no time can be,
Where was and is, and times to come,
Confounded are all three.
I mean before great God in Heaven,
(For Sun and Moon deuides
The times in Earth by hours and days,
And seasons still that slides.)
Yet Man, whom Man must understand,
Must speak into this case,
As man, our flesh will not permit,
We heavenly things embrace.
Then, as I else began to say,
One day it did fall out,
As glorious God in glistering throne,
With Angels round about
Did sit, and Christ at his right hand,
That crafty Satan came,
Deceauer, Liar, hating man,
And Gods most sacred name.
This old abuser stood into
The presence of the Lord,
Then in this manner Christ accus'de,
The sower of discord.
I know thou from that City comes,
CONSTANTINOPLE great,
Where thou have by thy malice made
The faithles Turks to freat.
Thou have inflamde their maddest minds
With raging fire of wraith,
Against them all that do profess
My name with fervent faith.
How long o Father shall they thus,
Quite under foot be tred,
By faithles folks; who executes
What in this snake is bred.

Their Faith is too too small,
They strive me think on either part,
Who farthest back can fall,
Have thou not given them in my hands,
Even boath the sides I say,
That I, as best does seem to me,
May use them every way?
THEN IEHOVA, whose nod does make,
The heavens and mountains quake,

Of all the Earth to shake.
Whose word did make the world of naught,
And whose approouing syne,
Did stablish all even as we see,
By force of voice divine.
This God began from thundering throat,
Grave words of weight to bring,
All christians serves my Son though not
Aright in every thing.

With Infidels oppressed,
So of my holy hallowed name
The force is great and blessed,
Desist o tempter. GABRIEL come
O thou ARCHANGEL true,
Whom I have often in message sent
To Realms and Towns anew.
Go quickly hence to Venice Town,
And put into their minds

Have done in sundry kinds.
No whisling wind with such a speed,
From hills can hurl ore heugh,
As he whose thought does furnish speed,
His thought was speed aneugh.
This Town it stands within the Sea,
Five miles or there about,
Upon no I Will nor ground, the Sea
Runs all the streets throughout.
Who stood upon the Steeple head
Should see a wondrous sight,
A Town to stand without a ground,
Her ground is made by slight:
Strong Timber props dung in the Sea
Do bear her up by art,
An I Will is all her market place
A large and spacious part,
A Duke with Senate joynd does rule,
Saint MARK is patron chief,
Ilk year they wedde the Sea with rings
To be their sure relief.
The Angel then ariu'd into
This artificial Town,
And changed in likeness of a man,
He walks both up and down,
While time he met some man of spreit,
And then began to say,
What do we all? me think we sleep:
Are we not day by day
By cruel Turks and infidels
Most spitefully oppressed?
They kill our Knights, they brash our forts,
They let us never rest.
Go too, go too, once make a proof:
No more let us desist
To bold attempts God gives success,
If once assay we list:
With this he goes away, this man
Unto another tells
The purpose whereunto they both
Agree among them fels.
This other to another tells,
And so from hand to hand
It spreads and goes, and all that heard
It, necessare it fand.
And last of all, it comes unto
The Duke and Senates ear,
Who found it good, and followed forth
The same as ye shall hear.

In such a piteous strait
By Mahometists, that they had else
Given over all debait:
The Turk had conquest Cyprus I Will,
And all their lands that lay
Without the bounds of Italy,
Almost the whole I say:
And they for last refuge of all,
Had moved each Christian King

Relief in every thing.
The Town with piteous plaints did call
Upon the Lord of might,
With praying still and fasting often,
And groaning all the night,
Was nothing heard but sobs and sighs,
Was nothing seen but tears,
Yea sorrow drove the brauest men
With mourning to their bears.

The babe for woe did weep,
To see the mother giving milk
Such doleful gesture keep.
Young men and maids within the town
Were ay arraid in black,
Each Eau'n the Sun was sooner hid
Then erst, the night to macke.
No VENUS then, nor CUPID false
durst kyth or once appear,
For paile distress had banished them,
By sad and sorry cheer.
As Seas did compass them about,
So Seas the Streets did ri^^^.
So Seas of tears did ever flow,
The houses all within.
As Seas within were joynd with howles,
So Seas without did raire,
Their careful cries to Heaven did mount
Resounding in the air.
O stay my Muse, thou goes too far,
Show where we left before,
Lest trikling tears so fill my pen
That it will write no more.
THEN VENICE being in this state,
When GABRIEL there was sent,
His speeches spread abroad, made Town
And Senate both so bent
To take revenge, as they implorde
The Christian Princes aid,
Of forces such, as easily,
They might have spard and maid.
At last, support was granted them,
The holy league was past,
Als long to stand, as twixt the Turks
And Christians war should last.
It was agreed, that into March,
Or April every year,
The army should on eastern Seas,
Convene from far and near.
THVS bent upon their interprise,
The principalls did conveene,
Into MESSENA to consult,
What order should have been,
Observed in all their army great:
There DON JOAN d'AVSTRIA came,
Their General great, and VENIER als
Came there in Venice name.
From GENES ANDREA DOREE came
And Rome COLONNE sent,

Had into counsel spent,
In end ASCAGNIO DE LA CORN
A Martial man and wise
His counsel gave, as ye shall hear
Upon their enterprise.
THREE causes be (o Chieftaines brave)
That should a General let,
On Fortunes light uncertain wheel
The victory to set:

Then winning can avail,
As if his Realm he do defend
From them that it assail:
The next is when the contrare Host
Is able to divide
For sickness sore or famine great
Then best is to abide.
The third and last, it is in case
His forces be too small,

Then for to perish all:
But since of these two former points
We need not stand in doubt,
Then though we leese, we may defend
Our Countries round about.
As to the last, this army is
So awful strong and fair,
And furnished so with necessares
Through your foreseing cair,
That naught does rest but courage bold.
Then since your state is such,
With trust in God assay your chance
Good cause avails much.
But specially take heed to this,
That ere ye make away,
Ye order all concerning war,
Into their due array:
For if while that ye see your foes,
Ye shall continewe all,
Then shall their sudden sight with fear
Your brauest Spreits appall,
Each one command a sundry thing,
Astonished of the case,
And every simple Soldat shall
Usurp his Captains place.
This counsall so contents them all,
That every man departs,
With whispering much, and so resolves
With bold magnanime hearts.
THEIR preparations being made,
They all upon a day,
Their biting ankers, gladly wayed,
And made them for the way.
The Grecian Fleet, for HELENS cause,
That NEPTVNS town did sack:
In brave array, or glistring arms,
No match to them could make.
There came eight thousand Spaniards brave,
From hot and barren SPAIN,
Good ordour kepars, cold in fight,
With proud disdainful brain.
From pleasant fertile ITALY,
There came twelve thousand als,
With subtle spreites bent to revenge,
By crafty means and falls.
Three thousand ALMANS also came,
From Countries cold and wide,
These monney men with awful cheer
The chok will dourelie bide.

Three thousand venturers brave,
All voluntaires of conscience moved,
And would no wages have.
Armde Galleyes twice a hundr'and eight,
Six ships all wondrous great,
And five and twenty loadned Ships
With baggage and with meat.
With forty other little barks
And pretty Galeots small,

The Christian Navy all.
THIS cloud of Galleys thus began
On NEPTVNS back to row,
And in the Ships the mariners,
Did skippe from towe to towe
With willing minds they hailde the Ties,
And hoist the flaffing Sails,
And strongest towes, from highest mastes,
With force and practique hayles.

In Galleys against their will,
Whom Galley masters often did beat,
And threaten ever still.
The foming Seas did bullor up,
The risking Oars did rash,
The Soldats pieces for to clenge
Did shoures of shotts delashe.
BUT as the Devil is reddie bent,
Good works to hinder ay,

Their good success to stay:
Yet did the wisdoms of the Chiefes
And of the general most,
Compound all quarrels and debates
That were into that Host,
Preferring wisely as they ought,
The honor of the Lord,
Unto their own, the public cause,
To private men's discord.
THE feathered fame of wondrous speed
That does delight to flee
On tops of houses prattling all
That she can hear or see,
Part true, part false: this monster strange
Among the Turks did tell,
That diverse Christian Princes joynd,
Resolved with them to mell.
Then spies were sent abroad, who told
The matter as it stood,
Except in Arithmetique (as
It seemd) they were not good,
For they did count their number to
Be less then was indeed,
Which did into the great Turks mind
A great disdaining breed:
A perrillous thing, as ever came
Into a Chieftaines brain,
To set at naught his foes (though small)
By lighleing disdain.
Then SELYM sent a navy out,
Who wanderd without rest,
Whill time into LEPANTOES gulf
They all their Ankers kest.
IN season when with sharpest hooks
The busy shearers cow
The fruitful yallow locks of gold,
That do on CERES grow,
And when the strongest Trees for weight
Of birth do downward bow

In showers raines ripelie now,
And Husbandmen with woodbind crowns
To twice borne BACHVS dance,
Whose pleasant poison sweet in taste,
Does cast them in a trance:
Into this riping season sure,
The Christian Host I say,
Were all assembled for to make
Them Ready for the way:

The Vines were standing bair,
Trees void of fruit and CERES polde,
And lacking all her hair:
But when that leaves, with rattling falls
In banks of withered boughs,
And careful laborers do begin,
To yoke the painful ploughes
The Nauies near to other drew,
And VENIER (sent before)

The Turks had skowp'd the score,
That fifty Galleis quite were fled,
This word he sent express,
To make the Christians willingly
To battle them adresse,
As so they did, and enterd all,
(Moved by that samin slight.)
Into LEPANTOES gulf, and there
Preparde them for the fight.

Great God who creats all,
(With wakrife eye preordoning
What ever does befall.)
Was sitting in his pompous Throne,
In hiest Heaven above,
And gloriously accompanied
With justice and with love:
The one has smiling countenance,
The other frowning cheer.
The one to mercy still persuades
Him as a Father dear,
The other for to power his plagues
Upon repining sin,
And fill the fields with woeful cries,
The houses all with dinne,
But yet the Lord so temperates them,
That both do brook their place,
For Justice whiles obtaines her will,
But evermore does grace:
IEHOVA als has balances,
Wherewith he weighs aright
The greatest and the heauiest sins
With smaller faults and light,
These grace did move him for to take,
And so he weighed in Heaven,
The Christian faults with faithless Turks,
The balance stood not eauen,
But sweid upon the faithless side:
And then with awful face,
Frownd God of Hosts, the whirling Heavens
For fear did tremble apace,
The staiest Mountains shuddred all,
The grounds of earth did shake,
The Seas did bray, and PLVTOES Realm
For horror cold did quake.
How soon AVRORAS joyful face,
Had shead the shadie night,
And made the chiuering Larks to sing
For gladness of the light,

In Seas had gone to rest;
And PHOEBVS chasing vapors moist,
The Sky made blew celest:
The General of the Christian Host
Upon his Galley Mast,
The bloody sign of furious MARS
Made to be fixed fast.
Then as into a spacious town,
At breaking of the day,

Their Worklumes every way,
The Wright does sharp his hacking Axe,
The Smith his grinding File,
Glasse-makers beets their fire that burns
Continual not a while,
The Painter mixes colors viue,
The Printer Letters sets,
The Mason clinckes on Marble Stones,
Which hardly dressed he gets:

With earnest eyes did see
You sign of War, they all prepared
To win or else to die:
Here Hagbutters prepared with speed
A number of Bullets round,
There Cannoners, their Canons steild
To make distroying sound,
Here Knights did dight their burnisht brands,
Their Archers bows did bend,

And Harness hard did mend,
The feirie Mariners at once
Makes all their tackling clair
With whispering dinne, and cries confus'de,
Preparing here and there:
As busy Bees within their Hyues
With murmuring ever still,
Are earn'st upon their fruitful work
Their empty holes to fill.
The Flags and Enseigneis were displaid,
At ZEPHYRS will to wave,
Each painted in the colors clear
Of every owner brave.
BUT all this time in careful mind,
The General ever rolde,
What manner of array would best
Fit such an Army bold,
To pance on this it paind him more,
This more did trouble his breast,
Then Canons, Corse-lets, Bullets, tackle,
And swords, and bows, the rest,
And at the last with ripe advise,
Of Chieftaines sage and grave
He shead in three in Cressents form,
This martial Army brave:
The General in the battle was,
And COLONNE undertook
The right wing with the force of GENES,
The left did VENIER brook.
WHEN this was done, the Spanish Prince
Did row about them all,
And on the names of special men
With loving speech did call,
Remembering them how righteous was
Their quarrel, and how good,
Immortal praise, and infinite gains,
To conquer with their blood,
And that the glory of God in earth,
Into their manhead stands,
Through just relief of Christian souls
From cruel Pagans hands:
But if the ennemie triumphed
Of them and of their fame,
In millions men to bondage would
Professing Jesus name.
The SPANIOL Prince exhorting thus
With glad and smiling cheer,
With sugared words, and gesture good,
So pleased both eye and ear

This word abroad they blew,
A good presage that victory
Thereafter should ensew.
THE Turquish Host in manner like
Themselves they did array,
The which two, BASHAAS did command
And order every way.
For PORTAN BASHA had in charge,
To govern all by land,

The only chief command.
These BASHAAS in the Battle were,
With mo then I can tell,
And MAHOMET BEY the right wing had,
The left OCHIALI fell.
Then ALI-BASHA visied all
With bold and manly face,
Whose tongue did utter courage more
Then had alluring grace:

What victory Turks obtaind
On catife Christians, and how long
The OTTOMANS race had raignd.
He told them als, how long themselves
Had victours ever been,
Even of these same three Princes small,
That now durst so conuene,
And would ye then give such a lie
Unto your glories past,
As let your selves be overthrown
By loosers at the last?
This victory shall Europe make
To be your conquest pray,
And all the rare things therein till,
Ye carry shall away:
But if ye leese, remember well
How ye have made them thrall,
This samin way, or worse shall they
Demaine you one and all,
And then shall all your honors past
In smoke euanish quite,
And all your pleasures turn in pain
In dolor your delight:
Take courage then, and boldly to it,
Our MAHOMET will aid,
Conducting all your shots, and strokes,
Of Arrow, Dart, and blaid:
For nothing care but only one
Which only does me fray,
That ere with them we ever meet
For fear they flee away:
This speech did so the Army please,
And so their minds did move,
That clincks of Swords, and rattle of Pikes,
His speeches did approve.
THE glistering clear of shining Sun
Made both the Hosts so glance,
As fishes eyes did reele to see
Such hewes on Seas to dance:
But TITAN shinde on eyes of Turks
And on the Christian backs,
Although the wavering wind the which
But seldom settling tackes,
The Turks did second ever still
Whill but a little space
Before the chocke, o miracle,
It turned into their face,
Which Christians joyful as a seal
And token did receive,

They victory should have.
How soon a Cannons smokie throat
The Seas did dindle all,
And on BELLONA bold and wise,
And bloody MARS did call,
And that the sounding clear of brass
Did als approve the same,
And kindled courage into men
To win immortal fame.

This battle to recite,
And what by Martial force was done
My pen presumes to write,
As if I had you bloody God,
And all his power seen,
Yea to descriue the God of Hosts
My pen had able been:
No, no, no man that witness was
Can set it out aright,

Which none could do by sight:
But since I rashly took in hand,
I must assay it now,
With hope that this my good intent
Ye Readers will allow:
I also trust that even as he
Who in the Sun does walk
Is colored by the samin Sun,
So shall my following talk
Some savor keep of Martial acts,
Since I would paint them out,
And God shall to his honor als
My pen guide out of dout.
THIS warning given to Christians they
With Turks yoke here and there,
And first the six aforesaid Ships
That were so large and fair,
And placed were in the former ranks,
Did first of all persew
With Bullets, Raisers, Chains, and nails,
That from their pieces flew:
Their Cannons rummisht all at once,
Whose mortal thudding drove,
The fatal Turks to be content
With THETIS for their grave.
The Fishes were astonished all,
To hear such hideous sound,
The Azur Sky was dimmed with Smoke,
The dinne that did abound,
Like thunder rearding rumling rave
With roares the highest Heaven,
And pearst with pith the glistering vaults
Of all the Planets seven:
The piteous plaints, the hideous howles,
The grievous cries and mones,
Of millions wounded sundry ways,
But dying all at ones,
Conjoynd with former horrible sound,
Distemperd all the air,
And made the Seas for terror shake
With braying every where:
Yet all these unacquainted roares,
The fearful threatening sound,
Joined with the groaning murmuring howles
The courage could not wound
So far of Turquish Chieftaines brave,
As them to let or fray
With boldest speed their grievous harms
With like for to repay,

And Hagbuts crack so thick,
As Christians dead in number almost
Did countervaile the quick,
And sent full many carcages
Of Seas to lowest ground,
The Cannons thuds and cries of men
Did in the sky resound:
But Turks remaind not long unpaid
Even with their proper coin,

To former thundering join:
Dead drop they down on every side,
Their sighing Spreits eschews,
And crosses Styx into disdain,
To hear infernal news:
Yea skarcelie could the ancient bote
Such number of souls contain,
But sobbed underneath the weight
Of Passengers profane.

A whirling round does bear
The lead that dings the Father in dross
And fills the Son with fear,
Whill there a Chieftaine shrillie cries,
And Soldats does command,
A speedy Pellet stops his speech,
And stays his pointing hand,
Whill time a clustered troop does stand
Amasst together all,

Makes some selected fall:
The hideous noise so deaf'd them all,
Increasing ever still,
That ready Soldats could not hear
Their wise commanders will,
But every man as MARS him moved,
And as occasion served
His duty did the best he might,
And for no perrill sweru'd,
Their old commanders precepts past
They put in practice then,
And only memory did command
That multitude of men.
THVS after they with Cannons had
Their duty done a far,
And time in end had wearied them
Of such embassad war,
A rude recounter then they made,
Together Galleis clipped,
And each on other rasht her nose,
That in the Sea was dipped:
No manner of man was idle then,
Each man his arms did use,
No skaping place is in the Seas
Though men would MARS refuse:
The valiant Knight with Coutlasse sharp
Of fighting foe does part
The bloody head from body pale:
Whill one with deadly dart
Does pearce his enemies heart in twain,
An other fearce does strike
Quite through his fellows Arm or Leg,
With pointed brangling Pike:
The Cannons leaves not thundering of,
Nor Hagbuts shooting still,
And seldom Powder wastes in vain
But either wound or kill:
Yea even the simple forceats fought
With beggars boltes anew,

They wounded sore and slew:
Whill time a Christian with a sword,
Lets out a faithless breath,
A Turk on him does with a darte,
Revenge his fellows death,
Whill time a Turk with arrow does,
Shoot through a Christians arm,
A Christian with a Pike does pearce
The hand that did the harm:

A Turk with threatening sound,
A Hagbut hittes the Cannoner,
Who dead, falls to the ground:
The beggars boltes by forceates casten,
On all hands made to fly,
Iaw-bones and brains of killed and hurt,
Who wished (for pain) to die:
The clinkes of swords, the rattle of Pikes,
The whirre of arrows light,

In vain do what they might,
The cracks of Galleys broken and bruzd,
Of Gunns the rumbling beire
Resounded so, that though the Lord
Had thundered none could hear:
The Sea was vernished red with blood,
And fishes poysond all,
As IEHOVA by MOSES rod
In Aegipt made befall.

Uncertain all the while,
For Fortune often on either side,
Did frown and after smile,
It seemed that MARS and PALLAS both
Did think the day too short
With bloody practice thus to use
Their old acquainted sport:
For as the slaughter ay increast,
So did the courage still,
Of Martial men whom loss of friends
Enarm'd with eigre will,
The more their number did decrease
The more that they were harmd,
The more with MARS then were they filled
With boldning spite inarm'd:
Now up now down on either side,
Now Christians seemd to win,
Now overthrown, and now again,
They seemed but to begin.
My pen for pity cannot write,
My hair for horror stands,
To think how many Christians there
Were killed by Pagane hands.
O Lord throughout this Labyrinth
Make me the way to view,
And let thy holy three-folde Spreit
Be my conducting clew:
O now I spy a blessed Heaven,
Our landing is not far:
Lo good victorious tidings comes
To end this cruel war.
IN ALL the time that thus they fought,
The Spanish Prince was clipped
With ALI-BASHA, whom to meet
The rest he had oreslipt:
And even as throughout both the Hosts,
Dame Fortune varied still,
So kythde she twixt those Champions two,
Her fond inconstant will:
For after that the Castles four
Of Galleis both, with sound,
And slaughter huge, their Bullets had
In other made rebound,

Consumde their shots below
In killing men, or else to cut
Some Cable strong or Towe:
Yet victory still uncertain was,
And Soldats never ceast
(With interchange of Pikes and Darts.)
To kill, or wound at least.
In end, when they with blood abroad
Had bought their meeting dear,

Began for to appear:
For even the Spanish Prince himself
Did hazard at the last,
Accompanied with boldest men
Who followd on him fast,
By force to win the Turquish deck,
The which he did obtain,
And entered in their Galley syne
But did not long remain:

With his assisters brave,
That backward faster then they came
Their valiant foes they drove,
That glad they were to skape themselves,
And leave behind anew
Of valiant fellows carcases,
Whom thus their enemies slew.
The General boldned then with spite,
And vernisht red with shame,

Then tine his spreading fame:
And so of new encouraged
His Soldiers true and bold,
As now for eigrenesse they burn
Who erst were waxed cold:
And thus they entered in again
More fiercely then before,
Whose rude assault could ALI then
Resist not any more,
But fled unto the forte at STEVIN.
For last refuge of all,
Abiding in a doubtsome fear
The chance he did befall.
A MACEDONIAN soldier then
Great honor for to win,
Before the rest in earnest hope
To BASHA bold did rin,
And with a Cutlace sharp and fine
Did whip me off his head,
Who lackt not his reward of him
That did the Navy lead:
The General syne caused fix the head
Upon his Galley Mast,
At sight whereof, the faithless Host
Were all so sore aghast,
That all amas^ gave back at once,
But yet were staid again,
And never one at all did escape,
But taken were or slain
OCHIALI except, with three times ten
Great Galleis of his own,
And many of the Knights of MALT
Whom he had overthrown:
But if that he with his conuoy
Had mist a safe retreat,
No news had SELYM but by brute
heard ever of this defeat.
WHEN thus the victory was obteind,
And thanks were given to God,

Releeu'd from Turquish rod.
O Spanish Prince whom of a glance
And suddenly away
The cruel fates gave to the world
Not suffering thee to stay.
With this the still night sad and black
The earth over shadowed then,
Who MORPHEVS brought with her and rest
To steal on beasts and men.

Reuoluing what event
Might come of this prepared fight,
With doubtsome minds and bent:
They longed, and yet they durst not long
To hear the news of all,
They hoped good, they feared the evil,
And kest what might befall:
At last the joyful tidings came,
Which such a gladness bred,

The Market place bespred:
Anon with cheerful countenance
They dress them in a ring,
And thus the formest did begin
Syne all the rest to sing.
CHORUS VENETVS.
SIng praise to God both young and old
That in this town remain,
With voice, and every Instrument,
Found out by mortal brain:
Sing praises to our mighty God,
Praise our deliuerars name,
Our loving Lord, who now in need,
Has kythd to be the same,
The faithles snares did compass us,
Their netts were set about,
But yet our dearest Father in Heaven,
He has redeemd us out.
Not only that, but by his power,
Our enemies feet they slaid,
Whom he has trapt, and made to fall
Into the pit they made:
Sing praises then both young and old,
That in this town remain,
To him that has relieved our necks,
From Turquish yoke prophaine.
Let us wash off our sins impure,
Cast off our garments vile,
And hant his Temple every day,
To praise his name a while.
O praise him for the victory,
That he has made us have,
For he it was reuengd our cause,
And not our army brave:
Praise him with Trumpet, Piphre, and drum,
With Lutes, and Organes fine,
With Viols, Gitterns, Cistiers als,
And sweetest voices syne:
Sing praise, sing praise both young and old,
Sing praises one and all,
To him who has redeemd us now,
From cruel Pagans thrall.
IN HEARING of this song me thinks
My members waxes faint,
Nor yet from dulnes can I keep,
My mind by no restraint.
But lo my Y^nie head does nod,
Upon my Adamant breast,
My eie-lidds will stand up no more,
But falls to take them rest.
And through my weak and weary hand,
Does slide my pen of lead,
And sleep does else possess me all,
The similitude of dead.
The God with golden wings through ports,
Of horn does to me creep,
Who changes ofter shapes transformd
Then PROTEVS in the deep.
How soon he came, quite from my mind,
He worldly cares removed,
And all my members in my bed,
Lay still in rest beloud.
And syne I heard a joifull song
Of all the fethered bands
Of holy Angels in the heaven,
Thus singing on all hands.
CHORUS ANGELORVM.
SIng let us sing with one accord
HALLELV-IAH on hie,
With every elder that does bow
Before the Lamb his knee:
Sing four and twenty all with us
Whill Heaven and earth resound
Replenisht with IEHOVAS praise
Whose like cannot be found:
For he it is, that is, and was,
And evermore shall be,
One only one vnseparate,
And yet in persons three.
Praise him for that he creat has
The Heaven, the earth and all,
And ever has preserved them since
From their ruin and fall:
But praise him more if more can be,
That so he loves his name,
As he does mercy show to all
That do profess the same:
And not alanerlie to them
Professing it aright,
But even to them that mix therewith
Their own inventions slight:
As specially this samin time
Most plainly may appear,
In giving them such victory
That not aright him fear:
For since he shows such grace to them
That thinks themselves are just,
What will he more to them that in
His mercies only trust?
And since that so he uses them
That doubt for to be saved,
How much more them that in their hearts
His promise have engrau'd?
And since he does such favor show
To them that fondly pray
To other Mediators then
Can help them any way:
O how then will he favor them,
Who prayers do direct
Unto the Lamb, whom only he
Ordaind for that effect?
And since he does revenge their cause
That worship God of bread,
(An error vain the which is bred,
But in a mortal head)
Then how will he revenge their cause
That only fear and serve,
His dearest Son, and for his sake
Will for no perrils swerue:
And since that so he pities them
That bear upon their brow,
The mark of Antichrist the whore
That great abuser now,
Who does the truest Christians
With fire and sword invade,
And make them holy Martyrs that
Their trust in God have laid,
How will he them that thus are used,
And bears upon their face
His special mark, a certain sign
Of everlasting grace?
Put end unto the traueils (Lord)
And miseries of thy Sancts,
Removing quite this blindness gross
That now the world so dants:
Sing praises of his mercy then
His superexcellence great,
Which does exceed even all his works
That lie before his seat:
And let us sing both now and ay
To him with one accord,
O holy, holy, God of Hosts,
Thou everliving Lord.
THVS ended was the Angels song,
And also here I end:
Exhorting all you Christians true
Your courage up to bend,
And since by this defeat ye see,
That God does love his name
So well, that so he did them aid
That served not right the same.
Then though the Antichristian sect
Against you do conjure,
He does the body better love
Then shadow be ye sure:
Do ye resist with confidence,
That God shall be your stay
And turn it to your comfort, and
His glory now and ay.
FINIS.
SONET.
THe azur'd vaulte, the crystal circles bright,
The gleaming fyrie torches powdered there,
The changing round, the shyning beamie light,
The sad and bearded fyres, the monsters fair:
The prodiges appearing in the air,
The rearding thunders, and the blustering winds,
The fowls, in hew, in shape, and nature raire,
The pretty notes that winged musiciens finds:
In earth the sau'rie flowers, the mettal'd minds,
The wholesome herbs, the hautie pleasant trees,
The silver streams, the beasts of sundry kinds,
The bounded roares, and fishes of the seas:
All these, for teaching man, the LORD did frame,
To do his will, whose glory shines in them.

LA LE PANTHE DE IAQVES VI. ROY D'ESCOSSE, Faicte francoise par le Sieur Du
BARTAS.

IMPRIME A EDINBVRG PAR ROBERT WALDE-GRAVE, Imprimeur du Roy.

Anno Dom. 1591.

Auec Privilege de sa Majeste.

AV LECTEVR.
LECTEVR, ne pense point qu'un desir d'augme^ter ma reputation m'ait pousse a
trauailler apres ceste versio^. Quelque pourete d'espritqu'il y ait en moy, si
suis-je, par la grace de Dieu, beaucoup plus fecond en matiere, qu'en motz: and
l'inuention me couste moins, que l'elocution. C'est pourquoy i'auoy fait voeu a
mes plus saints Muses, de ne mettre jamais la main a traduction ou paraphrase
quelco^que. Mais, que ne pourroit sur moy, je ne dis pas la grandeur, ains
l'admirable esprit du Roy d'Escosse? La grave douceur, la belle and
artificieuse liaison, les viues and parlantes descriptions de sa Lepa^the m'ont
tellement rauy, que j'ay este contraint de fausser mon serment. Accept
donques, ie te pry, ceste plant que l'Apollon de nostre temps a seem de sa
propre main, and les Graces ont arrouse du nectar plus divine qui coule de leur
bouche. Et bien que pour estre transportee en autre solage, elle ait perdu ses
plus belles fleurs: toutesfois son estoc, ses branches, and la plus part de ses
fueilles luy sont demeurees. Le peintre peut bien exprimer and le pourfil, and
les couleurs d'un beau visage: mais non l'air, le geste, and moins encor la
parolle. Que si mesme quand au sens tu trouues que cest extraict ne respond
point entierement a son original, propose toy que cest ouurage ne faisoit que
sortir encores tout blueta^t de la forge Royale, quand je luy donnay la facon
francoise: and que depuis sa Majeste l'a rebattu, and relime, and breffait tell,
qu'il semble estre sorti de la boutique d'Homere.

PREFACE DV TRADVCTEVR A LAVTHEVR.
IAQVES, si tu marchois d un pied mortel ca bas,
Hardy i'entreprendroy de tallonner tes pas:
I'estendroy tous mes nerfs, and ma course sacree
Loing, loing lairroit a dos les aisles de Boree.
Mais puis qu Aigle nouueau tu te guindes es cieux,
Colle bas, ie te suy seulement de mes yeux:
Mais plustost du desir: ou, si ie me remue,
Ombre ie vole en terre, and toy dedans la nue.
He! fusse-ie vrayment, o Phoenix Escossois,
Ou lombre de ton corpse, ou l'Echo de ta voix.
Si ie n'auoy l'azur, l'or, and l'argent encore
Don't ton plumage astre brillantement s'honnore,
Au moins i'auroy ta form: and simon rude verse
N'exprimoit la douceur de tant d'accords diverse,
Il retiendroit quelque air de tes voix plus qu'humaines,
Mais, Pies, taisez vous pour ouyr les Camoenes.
LA LEPANTHE DE IAQVES VI. ROY D'ESCOSSE, FAICTE Francoise par le Sr Du BARTAS.
IE chante du grand Dieu la justice and bonte,
Un exploit de ses mains non encore chante:
Un combat hazardeux, vne dure iournee:
Ie descry dans ces verse la bataille donnee
Sur le flot LEPANTHOIS, qui se vid arrouse
Et du sang Circoncis, and du sang baptize.
VIEN, vien donques, Seigneur, o Majesty divine,
Tout-puissante, immortelle, vne en trois, en un trine,
O Pere de ce Tout, ie te pry trois fois,
Par ton unique Fills, ton immortelle voix,
Le bras de ton vouloir, l'Ange du tesmoignage,
Que ton Esprit sacre sur l'or de ceste page
Face color un verse, en graces si parfaict,
Qu'il pass merueilleux les merueilles du faict.
Le trois-fois Saint ayant pour throne le haut Pole,
Les Anges pour archers, a son flanc sa Parole,
L'Eternel vid un iour, (l'erre car deuant DIEV
Le Temps enfant du Ciel, ne peut point auoir lieu.
Le temps desia pass, qui passera, qui pass,
Tousiours confus ne sont qu'un temps deuant sa face.
Mais quoy? l'homme mortel pour parler clairement
Aux hommes, est contraint parler humainement:
La chair n'attaint au ciel, and les langues mortelles
Beguayent en parlant des chooses eternelles.)
Il vid, di-ie, au milieu de la troop celeste
L'ennemi de son nom, and des hommes la peste:
Le Saint vid a ses pieds le premier imposteur,
De crimes forgeron, seme-yuraye, menteur,
Auquel Christ parle ainsi: Monstre plein d'impudence,
Tu viens (le scay-ie pas?) de l'antique Byzance
Pour remplir boute-feu, d'ire and forcenement,
Du Turc porte-turban le fire entendement
Contre ceux qu'a mon nom l'humble genouil flechissent.
PERE permettras-tu que ces chiens les pestrissent
Sous leurs profanes pieds? que ceux qui sont sans foy
Triomphent des humains qui t'adorent en moy
D'une foy viue armez? qu'en despit de ton ire
Ils soient executeurs de tout ce qu'il conspire?
Quelle foy? dit Satan: ne scay-tu pas qu'ils font,
Impudens, a qui mieux couronnera son front
Du laurier de reuolte? a tu pas exposee
Et la gent Muzulmane, and la gent baptizee
Enter mes rouges mains, a fin que leur supplice
Responde a leur forfait, responde a ma malice?
Adonques l' Eternel qui du seul croulement,
De son chef rayonneus meutiusqu' au fondement
Les montagneux rochers, fait chanceler le Pole,
Bouleuerse l'Enfer: ce DIEV don't la Parole
D'un rien fit de ce Tout l'ouurage si parfait,
Et le maintient encore en l'estat qu'il l'afait,
Prononca, non des motz, ains des bruyants tonnerres:
Dragon crache-venin, ruze fufil des guerres,
Vilain, lasche la prise, espargne les Chrestiens,
Et n'ose, o Tentateur, t'attaquer plus aux miens.
Tout Chrestien sert mon Fills, and bien qu'en mainte sort,
Il demente aueugle le sacre nom qu'il port,
Qu'il err en plusieurs points: si veux-ie toutes-fois
Que le nom de mon Christ luy serve de pauois:
Tant ce doux nom m'est saint: tant ie veux qu'on ho^nore
Ce beau nom que l'Enfer, le Ciel, la Terre adore.
Affronteur cesse donc. Mais toy Force de DIEV
Qui de zele empenne discourse de lieu en lieu,
Comme mon ambassade, o loing-volant Archange
GABRIEL, l'un des chefs de l'astreuse phalange,
Va t'en viste a Venice, and grave dans le coeur
De leur grave Senate vne guerriere ardeur,
De venger tant de torts que les dextres cruelles
Des rasez Muzulmans ont fait a mes fideles.
Il court tossed, and plustost qu'un vent roll caillous
Ne haste enter deux monts son murmurant courrous.
Sa pensee luy sert d' vne vistesse extreme,
Car il n'est a peu pres que pensee luy-mesme.
La trafiqueuse mer de tous costez enferme
Ceste ville, qui n'est Isle, ny terre ferme,
Ville, qui flotte en l'eau, ville sans fondement,
Qu'une forest plantee en l'onde artistement
A grands coups de belier supporte, and port aux nues,
Grand'ville qui n'a point moins de mers, que de rues.
Montesur vne tour a cent bouches d'airain,
Tu vois vne mer seche, un champ fait a la main,
Un abbrege du monde, vne isle rich and grande,
Ou preside un seul Duc, ou le Senate command.
Saint MARC est leur Patron: and leur espouse encor
La marchande Thetis, que d'une bague d'or,
Ils estrenent chasqu' an. Le messager celeste
Arrive la dedans prend la form, and le geste
D'vn bourgeois ia chenu: se promeine, and trouuant
Un sage citadin, met ces motz en auant.
Helas! que faisons nous? sommes nous lethargiques?
Nous sommes oppressez, par ces cruels Ethniques,
Et ne le sentons point? noz forts sont mis a bas,
Noz guerriers esgorgez, and ne le voyons pas?
Allons, que tardez vous? chargeons ceste racaille,
Vuidons noz vieux debats par un iour de bataille.
DIEV secourt les hardis Cela dit, ils enfuit.
Ce propos courageus de bouche en bouche suit
Tous le coins de la ville: Il paruient a l'oreille
De l'auguste Senate: qui soudain se reueille
De son profond sommeil: l'approuue, and sage faict
Ce qu'il doit, ce qu'il peut pour le mettre en effect.
Ce peuple estoit tenu par les lunez gendarmes
De si court qu'ilz n'auoient que les seuls voeus pourarmes:
La Cypre estoit ia prise, and le board mugissant
D'Adrie, estoit le board de son scepter impuissant.
Il supply l'Eglise esparse par la terre,
Qu'en priant elle arrache au Seigneur le tonnerre
Qui gronde sur son chef: La ville engemissant,
Importune sans fin le trois-fois-Tout-puissant:
Tous les iours elle ieusne: elle joint ses mains saints:
On ne voit rien que pleurs: on n'entend rien que plaintes.
Les hommes plus guerriers sont mandez au cercueil
Frappez tant seulement du fer mousse du dueil:
La femme done laict de tristesse se pasme:
L'enfancon qui le void de ducil rend presque lame.
La plus gaye ieunesse a d'vn noir vestement,
Affuble tout son corpse: le plus rich ornement
De l'azur estoille, le clair cierge du monde,
Plustost qu'il ne souloit se replonge en son onde
D'vn front rebarbatif, affreux, and renfrongne:
La blaffarde Misere a tout d'vn coup done
La chasse a Cupidon. Dans leurs maisons dorees
Flottent les tiedes pleurs: autour, les mers irees.
Les eaux bruyent autour: dedans, les hurlements:
Leur cri des-espere percant les Elements
Monte iusques au Ciel. MUSE, turn en arriere
Et, sage, remetz toy sur ta route premiere.
Crains-tu pas que les pleurs sur mon papier coulants,
Effacent les noirs traitz de mes discourse sanglants?
TELL estoit la Cite, quand l'empenne message
De son peuple marin r'allume le courage.
Noz Roys, sollicitez par elle tous les iours,
Vont en fin accordant le demand secours.
La saint ligue est faicte: and sur la verte riue
Du fort MESSENIEN tout l'ost Chrestien arrive.
La, comme General DON-IEAN l' Austrichien
Luit ainsi qu'vn Soleil: l'honneur Venitien
VENIER s'y trouue aussi: le Geneuois DORIE,
Et COLOMNE pilier du pilier d'Hesperie,
De la ville a sept monts. Or plusieurs iours s'estant
Enter ces braues chefs passez en consultant,
ASCAIGNE de la Corn, homme prudent and brave
Auance ce discourse non moins facond que grave:
SEIGNEVRS, on ne doit pas hazarder un estat
Sur le rouet ledger d'vn uncertain combat
Quand la guerre se fait dans les propres entrailles
De nostre cher pais: quand des dures batailles
Le bien-heureux succez n'apporte tant de fruict
Auxvainqueurs, qu'aux vaincuz vne grand'route nuit:
Et beaucoup moins encor quand l'armee ennemie
Combatue du Ciel, de faim, d'Epidemie
Peu a peu se desbande: ou quand plus d'estendarts
Marchent en l'ost hayneux, qu'aux nostres des soudarts.
Lors certes il vaut mieux laisser cuuer leurrage,
Et caler voile un peu, que fair entier naufrage.
O genereux Heroes, puis que nous nefaisons
Laguerre a Soliman sur l'huis de noz maisons,
Que son ost ne se rompt: and que nostre exercite
Superbe est compose de tant d'hommes d'eslite,
Si fort, si bien muny: que pour estre vainqueur
Sans doubt rien ne peut luy manquer que le coeur:
Attaquons l'ennemi, iectants sus lapuissance
Du DIEV donne-lauriers l'ancre de l'esperance.
Bon droit vaut mieux que force. Il est vray que plustost
Que nous venons aux mains, il faut policer l'ost,
L'asseurer, l'exercer: de peur qu'a l'impourueue
Du Barbaresque arroy l'esblouissante veue
N'esbranle les plus fires: que les commandments
Diverse n'aillent troublant noz croisez regiments:
Et le soldat couche freschement sur le roll
N'vsurpe de son chef l'office and la parolle.
Il finit: and soudain par un murmr doux
Son genereux conseilest approuue de tous.
Ilz s'en vont satisfaicts: and dans les creux nauires
R'emportent eschauffez des genereuses ires.
Ce camp, par qui iadis ILION fut raze,
En arms and valeur cedoit au baptize.
La, l'Espaigne rostie, areneuse, infertile,
De ses filz basanez en faict venir huict mile:
Superbes, bien reglez, de leur honneur ialoux,
Froids au co^menceme^t, mais chauds aux meilleurs coups.
L'Italie, tetin, and verger de la terre
Y fait color la fleur de ses hommes de guerre:
Douze mill soldatz vindicatifz, gentilz,
A bien fair, a mal fair, esgalement subtilz.
Puis on void sur le dos de l'ondeuse campaigne
Venir des vagues champs de la froide Allemaigne
De guerriers fourmilliere, and boutique de MARS,
Trois mill champions, venaux, mais bons soudarts.
La se trouuent aussi trois mill volontaires
Bouillants d'vn zele saint: deux cents and huict galeres,
Vingt and cinq naus de charge, auec six grands vaisseaux,
Qui semblent des Palais, non des nefz sur les eaux.
Et deus fois vingt encor fustes, fregates, barques
Portent le camp sacre des fidelles Monarques.
CE peuple vagabond, ceste ville de bois
Commence a desmarer le septiesme du mois
Qui nage tout en moust. D'vn alaigre courage
Les nochers vont grimpant de cordage en cordage:
Hissant, haussant les draps: and donnent, rois des eaux,
Par force and par engine des aisles aux vaisseaux.
Seuls les forcats mi nuds d'vne rame ferree
Rompent a contre coeur l'eschine de Neree:
Mais le Comite fire en front, en mine, en voix
Les menace tous-iour, and les bat maintes-fois.
Ia d'auirons bruyans vne forest esmue
Par un nombreux accord le Sell baueux remue:
L'artillerie orage: and les soldats dispos
D'une gresle de plomb font empouler les flots.
SATAN, qui hait malin toute saint entreprise,
Le noir feu du discord dans l'ost Chrestien attise.
Le General l'esteint de l'eau de son bon sens:
Et faict, bien advise, que les chefz plus puissans
Ne regardent qu'a DIEV: and d'vn coeur heroique
A l'interest prive preferent le public.
LE RENOM loing volant (quisus les hautes tours
D'vne langue d'airain caquetant tous les iours,
Dict le vray, dict le faux:) haste ses peintes aisles,
Et des apprestz Chrestiens port au Turc les nouuelles.
L'espion desguise, legier, ingenieux:
Don't le corpse est couuert, and d'oreilles and d'yeux
Se fourre bien par tout: mais soniect semesconte
Et fait que l'ennemi, desdaigneus, ne tient conte
De l'exercite saint: vice qui souuent perd
Maint Captain en chef plus hazardeux qu'expert.
La f^otte de SELIM au-gre des vents errante
Mouille l'ancre a la fin augoulphe de Lepanthe.
Le tanne moissonneur auoit desia tondu
CERES aux cheueuxd'or: BACCHVS auoit perdu
Et son pampre and ses fruicts: les branches verdissantes
Ne craquent sous le faiz des pommes rougissantes:
Le bois des premiers froids paslement estonne
Laisse tomber son poil sur le gazon fene:
Et ia le laboureur du soc de sa charrue
Pour y semer du ble le pourri champ remue,
Quand lapproche se faict Lors VENIER le ruze,
VENIER second Vlysse ayant l'ost abuse
Par vne fausse alarm, and semeles nouuelles
De la blesme terreur des soldatz infideles:
Qu'on ny void que discord, fuite, temerite:
Et que cinq-fois dix naus ont leur camp ia quitte,
Faict que noz champions d'vn plus constant courage
Mesprisent des Payens, and le nombre and la rage.
Tandis le Saint ouurier de ce rond bastiment,
Qui void tout, qui sur tout command absolument,
Assis au lieu plus haut de la voute empyree
Void slanquer les piliers de sa chair doree
De JUSTICE and d' AMOVR. L'vn a le front riant,
Et l'autre rensrongne: l'vn vapor nous priant,
Et l'autre contre nous: l'vn a Pity le pousse,
L'autre fait que vengeur L' ETERNEL se courrouce,
Qu'il desploye ses fleaux, and rempli^se les chams
De hurlemens affreux, les toictz de cris trenchans.
Mais le DIEV tousiour-vn si dextrement accord
Et la LOY porte-glaiue, and la MISERICORDE:
Qu'encor que la premiere obtienne rarement,
De ses breuetz sanglants le just appointement:
Et que l'autre tousiours parvienne a ses attentes:
Else sont toutes-fois esgualement contents.
Puis L' ETERNEL prenant la balance en ses mains,
Et par grace y pesant les pechez des humains,
Des cruelz Sarrasins void trebucher les fautes:
Et celles des Chrestiens demeurer tousiours hautes.
Lors ilfronca son front don't la Terre trembla,
Pluton fremit de peur, and la Mer se troubla
Bruyantement haueuse Aussi tossed quel' Aurore
Peinte d'or, de safran, de vermeillon encore,
A bani la nuict sombre: and qu'en tire-lirant
L'allouette a done d'un bec doux-souspirant
Vngay bon-iour au iour: que Phoebe change-face
Dans le parc de Thetis ses moreaus vistes chasse:
Que Phoebus dissipe-ombre a d'un feu tremblotant
Frappe l'acier fourbi du casquet esclatant:
IEAN d' AVSTRE va plantant sur la hunc venteuse
De MARS fauche-soudars l'enseigne furieuse.
Ainsi que les ouuriers diligemment subtils,
Sur la point du iour preparent leurs outilz:
Son feu tousiour viuant la le vitrier attise:
L'artiste menuisier la ses rabotz aiguise:
Le serrurier sa lime: and la le bon macon,
Au rebelle Porphyre oser donner facon.
La ses viues couleurs l'aigu peintre meslange:
Et la ses plombs parlants le prompt Imprimeur range:
Ce monde de soldats ne void si tossed flotter
Le signal du combat, qu'il s'en court apprester
Ses instruments guerriers: and gaillard boult d'enuie
Ou de gaigner la Palm, ou de perdre la vie.
Le brave Cheualier son glaiue raieunit,
Ses arms l'armeurier: Le soldat se munit
Et de cord and de plomb: and l'artilleur ia couche
Des Canons brise-nefz la ruineuse bouche:
L'Archer band son arc: and les nochers criars,
A leur oeuure attentifs courent de toutes parts.
Tous, tous sont occupez, ainsi que les auettes,
Qui peintes voletant sur l'esmail des fleurettes
Succottent la dessus l'alme sueur du ciel,
Qu'en leurs troux doux-bruyans else changent en miel.
On ne void rien parmi les troops marinieres
Que drapeaux bou-boufans, gonfanons, and bannieres,
Ou zephyrese jove, orgueilleux de mesler
Son aisle enfante-fleurs, doux esuantail de l'air,
Parmi tant de couleurs, armoiries, devises.
IEAN d' AVSTRE cependant, oisif tu ne mesprises
L'ordre de la bataille: and ton entendement
N'est pas moins trauaille de ce chaud pensement,
Que le rest du camp a ses mains occupees
Aux cords, traitz, canons, bales, arms, espees.
Tu menes la bataille, and fais que le Romain
A main droite combat, VENIER a lautre main.
CE chef rodant autour de la floite fidelle
Par nom and par surnom les plus vaillants appelle:
De leur deuot dessein propose l'equite,
Le butin de Turquie, and limmortalite.
Dict que l'honneur divine gist comme en leur courage:
Que leur seule valeur peut d'vn cruel seruage
Affranchir leurs germains: mais en tournant le front,
Ils trahissent leur gloire: and miserables font
Que le peuple qui saint la Foy de Christ embrasse
Gemira dans les ceps de l' OTTHO MANE race.
De ce noble orateur l'auguste royaute
Le front fierement beau, le port, la grauite
Door tant de ses mots la coulante merueille:
Que tout le camp raui par l'oeil, and par l'oreille
Dict Victoire, victoire, o victoire: and le flot,
D'vn language bruyant redit trois-fois ce mot.
I e t'accepte, o mot saint (cry le Prince sage)
Mot sacre, ie te pren pour un heureux presage.
LE Turc range de mesme en bataille ses osts,
PORTAV command en terre, ALY dessus les flots.
Fire il conduit le gros des troops infidelles,
OCHIAL and MEEMET gouuernent les deux aisles.
Lors ALY le BASCHA soigneux va visitant
D'vn visage asseure l'exercite flottant:
Et practiquant guerrier, vne masle eloquence,
Ilraconte comment la Turquesque vaillance
A tousiour triomphe du peuple port croix:
Qu'eux mesmes ont vaincu ia desia tant de fois
Ces chefs qui leur font test: and la longue duree
Des sceptres d' OTTHOMAN race en terre adoree.
He! voulez vous (dit il) rompuz, desfaicts, chassez,
Dementir le renom de voz gestes passez?
Fair cent-fois vainqueurs a voz vaincuz hommage?
Et du terroir Chrestien mespriser le pillage?
Mais perdant, vous serez accablez de gros fers:
Et gehenez nuict and iour seruirez a voz serfz:
Voz heurs deuiendront pleurs: and ceste renommee
Qui pousse au Ciel voz faitz ira toute en fumee.
Courage donc Soldats: MAHOM sera pour nous,
Et de noz fers trenchants guidera tous les coups.
Que s'il fault auoir peur, ayez peur que la crainte
Du burin de Nature en leur poictrine empreinte
Ne leur done plustost que de venir aux mains,
Et la iambe des cerfz and laisle pied des dains.
Le son enflambe-coeurs de ces motz heroiques
Est suiui quand and quand d'vn branslement de piques,
Du tin tin des estocs, and d'vne voix qui sort
De tout l'ost sans ardeur, sans force, sans accord.
Les rayons clair-luisans de la torche du monde
Donnant dessus l'acier font berluer sous l'onde
Les troupeaux escaillez. Le Soleil radieux
Frappe les Sainctz a dos, and le Turc sur les yeux.
Et les vents vagabonds qui deuant la meslee
Des Byzantins cruels chocquoient la pouppe aislee,
Si tossed qu'on vint aux coups (o miracle!) donna
Sur leur visage fire. Le Turc s'en estonna
Et le Chrestien le prit pour augure fidelle,
Que le DIEV des combatz defendroit sa querelle.
Si tossed que le gosier bruyantement fumeux,
Des longs canons troubla l'Ocean escumeux:
Que fire iladiourna BELLONE au grand courage:
Et MARS le furieux, sanglant, aime-carnage:
Que de l'airain plie le son haut-resonnant
Eut embraze les coeurs d'vn desir bouillonnant
De renom eternel. Pouuret, que veux-tu dire?
Veux-tu d'vn digne verse ces durs assautz descrire?
Ozes-tu peindre au vif DIEV tout tell qu'il estoit
Quand son bras tempesteux pour ses filz combattoit?
L'oculaire tesmoin n'y pourroit point suffire:
Et toy qui n'en scais rien que par un ouir-dire
En viendras bien a bout? mais ie l'ay proiecte,
Ie l'ay desia promis, le sort en est iecte,
Croyant que le lecteur visera, favorable,
Moins a mes rudes verse, qu'amon desir louable.
Que comme ceux qui vont tous les iours au soleil
Sont teincts des raise ardents qui partent de son oeil:
Mes propos retiendront quelque couleur naifue
Du MARS qu'ils veulent peindre: and que la source viue
D'eloquence and scuoir, le grand DIEV, don't ie veux
La gloire icy chanter, accomplira mes voeus.
Le sign estant done, la bataille commence,
Les six plus grandes nefz verse la test on auance:
On afuste, on prent mire, on tire des canons,
D'ou sortent des cailloux, bouletz, ramez, chainons,
Qui donnent dans les Turcs: and sous les eaux pourprees
Enterrent a lopins leurs bands demembrees.
Le peuple sans poulmon es abysmes s'enfuit
Tout d'vn coup, estonne d'vn tant horrible bruit:
Le cielest affeuble de cent nues fumeuses:
On oit bruire al'entour cent bouches salpetreuses,
Et leur ton ton-tonant err: and prompt, I'ay voulu icy imiter l'Onomatopoee
de l'autheur.
rompt le rond
Du plancher estoille. Les hurlements que font
Tant and tant de blessez qui par cent mill ports
Font leurs ames sortir despiteusement fortes,
Conioincts aux premiers bruitz, chamaillis, trembleme^ts,
Troublent tout en un couples craintifz elements.
Mais non les chefs des Turcs, qui vont pleins de courage
C'est orage chasser par un contraire orage:
Et leurs bouletz ardents abattent tant de corpse,
Que le nombre est esgal des viuans and des morts.
Les Turcs sont repayez en la mesme monnoye:
Nostre canon les bat, les brise, les foudroye.
Rompuz qui ca qui la tombent dedans les flots:
Leur esprit dedaigneux sort auec les sanglots,
Trauerse en blasphemant la riuiere infernale,
Et visited'Enfer la nuict sombrement pale.
Du passager CHARON le gemissant bateau
De trop d'ombres charge s'enfondre dedans l'eau.
Tandis qu'un pere ardent apres le fire carnage
Et de geste, and de voix, done a son filz courage,
Un boulet empenne d'une ardente vapeur
Done au pere la mort, done a l'enfant la peur.
Tandis que de la main, tandis que de la bouche
Un chef co^mande aux siens, un volant plomb luy bouche
Les conduits du language, and roidit, inhumain,
Les nerfz iadis si forts de sa parlante main.
Tandis qu'vn escadron emplotone se serre,
Le murmurant effort d'vn ensoulfre tonnerre,
Fatal, n'en choisit qu'vn, effleurant le chapeau
Du voisin, doz de l'autre, and d'vn autre la peau.
Cest effroiable son, faict que des Capitaines
Bien qu'ilz orient fort haut, les parolles sont veins.
Chascun mean les mains selon qu'il est pousse
Ou de l'obiect present, ou d un MARS insense.
Il est chef and soldat: and ses mains exercees,
Font proufit seulement des batailles passees.
S'estant donc saluez sur les champs ondoyants,
Par des ambassadeurs mortellement bruyants
On parle de plus pres: l'vn and l'autre ost approach:
La nef choque la nef, la nef la nef accroche:
Tout bras, tout glaiue aigu, tout dard est employe:
Celuy qui fuit les coups, est dans la mer noye.
Icy le Cheualier trenche net vne test,
Et la quand un guerrier magnanime s'appreste
A creuer d'vn espieu le coeur d'vn fire soudart,
Un tiers d'vn bois tremblant l'outre de part en part.
Tousiour le canon tonne, and l'harquebuse pette:
Iamais du fer creuse la foudreuse tempeste
Ne les menace en vain: chaque plomb a son blanc:
Et s'il ne tue point, il verse aumoins du sang.
Le forcaire au doux son du saint mot de franchise
Vne guerriere ardeur dans sa poitrine attise:
Et s'armant de crochetz, de bars, d'auirons,
Bless, assomme tous ceux qu'il trouue aux enuirons.
Cependant qu'vn Chrestien prive ce Turc de vie,
La vie du Chrestien est par un Turc rauie.
Lors que d'vn traict Turquois un saint bras est attaint,
Le bras decoche traict est perce d'vn bois saint.
Et sur le mesme poinct que d'une forte bale
L'artilleur Musulman pousse en l'onde infernale
Un baptize soldat, l'harquebusier croise
Tue le canonier, qui mire peu ruze
Le beau coup qu'il a faict: and done trop grand prise
A cil qui seulement contre sa test vise.
Des fresnes aiguisez le dru tremoussement,
Le chamaillis du fer, des traicts le frissement,
Des blesses languissants l'effroiable language,
L'entrechoc des vaisseaux, and des canons l'orage,
Mesles s'en vont si haut sur les eaux resonnant,
Qu'on ne peut mesme ouir le bruit du ciel tonnant.
La mer n'estrien que sang: and la race escaillee
S'enyure du poison de son onde souillee:
Et semble qu'a ce coup de L' Amramide saint,
Le deuorant baston eut tout ce goulphe teint.
Leur valeur rend long temps douteuse la meslee:
Mesme ost and gaigne and perd. Et la fortune aislee
Void chasque bataillon de picques herisse
Or d'vn riant visage, or d'vn oeil courrouce.
MARS trouue le iour court pour practiquer sa rage:
Le massacre croissant, fait croistre le courage:
Plus le nombre descroit, plus descroit la pity:
La perte des amiss cause vne inimitie,
Qui rend chasque soldat durant ce triste esclandre
Fort a donner les coups, insensible a les prendre.
Quand ie pense combien de Chrestiens sont tombez
Sous l'homicide fill des coutelas courbez
Du peuple Byzantin, d'horreur mon poil se dress,
Ma plume ne peut peindre vne tell tristesse.
O DIEV par ton esprit esclaire mes esprits:
Et d'un saint peloton guide moy par les plis
De ce Daedale obscur: courage, terre, terre:
Ie descouure un bon port: Ie voy finir la guerre.
Ia l'oreille me corn, and dans les creuses naux
Semble que i'oy desia mill chants triomphaux.
L'Espagnol Cheualier qui courageux desire
Du Colonnel Payen attaquer la nauire,
Hurt, pass a trauers flotz, proves, esperons,
Bales, piques, espieux, dardz, flesches, auirons:
Agraffe nef a nef, esprouue sa vaillance.
Mais le sort n'est pas moins constant en inconstance,
En ce duel prive, qu'es combatz generaux.
On tire incessamment des chasteaux des deux naux.
Les canons plus en coup qu'en murmr effroyables
Rompent corpse, iambes, bras, mastz, antennes and cables.
On rend les traicts iectez: and du commencement
L'entr'approche des chefs s'achepte cherement.
A la fin toutes-fois la victoire commence
Regarder d'vn bon aeil l'Espagnole vaillance.
DON-IEAN accompagne des plus braues guerriers,
Prodigue de son sang, enter des beaus premiers
Dans le vaisseau vaincu du BASCHA, qui colere
Se despitant de veoir les croix dans sa galere,
Rechasse les vainqueurs, and fait qui'ls laissent morts
Sur son tillac sanglant pour gage plusieurs corpse.
Le Prince esperone de despit and de honte,
Et chez qui l'amour saint de la gloire surmonte
L'amour doux de la vie, encourage si bien
Et d'exemple and de voix le bataillon Chrestien
Que son craintif glacon en un brasier s'allume,
Et qu'il r'entre dedans plus fire que de coustume.
Le Turc de tant de gents a la fin combattu
Gaigne pour se sauuer la prove au bec-pointu.
Un soldat Grec l'attaque: and fait saulter par terre
Son sacrilege chef d'vn coup de cimeterre.
Le coup n'est sans guerdon: and le chef degoutant
Est fiche sur le mast de son vaisseauflotant.
Ce trophee estonna les Turcs de tell sort,
Que la volante peur loing des coups les emporte.
Mais ils sont tossed apres par noz voiles r'attaints.
Et sans qu'vn OCHIAL trompa noz longues mains
Gaignant un seur Asyle auec trente galeres,
Ou maint Heroes Malthois esprouuoit les miseres
Du forcat qui battu battoit tousiour Neptun,
SELIM n'en eust rien sceu que par un bruit commun.
La bataille gagnee au SEIGNEVR on rend graces:
On suit barques, esquifs, houlques, galeres, nasses:
On y trouue enferrez douze mill de ceux
Que CHRIST le grand Pasteur dans son parc a rec eus.
On haut-loue DON-IEAN vray foudre de la guerre,
Don't le ciel a voulu fair monstre a la terre:
Et puis la retire, non sans cause ialoux
Qu'vn astre si luisant flamboiast parminous.
La Nuict respand adonc sur les chooses mortelles
Pour couuer le repos ses doux-pesantes aisles:
Va tous les animaux de son miel enchantant:
Et mean auecques soy Morphee linconstant.
Venize est en suspens, and d'vne ame flottante
Attend l'euenement de l'attaque sanglante.
Elle se veut promettre, and n'ose toutes-fois
(Tant le pass l'esmeut) la mort de l'ost Turquois.
De joy and de douleur sa poitrine est attainte:
Elle esere le bien, and du mal elle a crainte.
En fin du bon succez de ce cruel combat
Le message certain paruient iusqu'au Senate:
Du Senate, a la Ville. Vne joy incroiable
Saisit le coeur de tous. La troop venerable
Des Dames aux vieux ans, and des Vierges encor,
Reprenant ses carquans, bagues, and chains d'or,
Et se tournant en rond dans la place public
Au branle de ses pieds marient ce Cantique.
CHOEVR VENETIEN.
CHante, o peuple, ton DIEV: Ieunes and vieux chantez,
De voix and d'instruments celebrez ses bontez.
De CHRIST le grand Sauueur chantez l'amour extreme,
Sauueur qui s'est monstre vray Sauueur a vous-mesme.
Le laqs des ennemis nous tenoit enserrez,
Les Turcs autour de nous auoient tendu leurs retz:
DIEV nous a mis au large, and leur propre artifice,
Miserable, a serui de fosse a leur malice.
Chante, o peuple, ton DIEV: Ieunes and vieux chantez,
Vieux and ieunes de DIEV celebrez les bontez.
Qui du profane ioug de la gent Sarrasine
N'aguere a descharge vostre saigneuse eschine.
Lauez tous voz pechez dans l'eau du repentir:
Nets entrez dans son Temple: and faictes retentir
Ceste route des Turcs, victoire renommee
Que nous tenons de luy, and non de nostre armee.
Chrestiens, saisissez-vous de voz luths doux-sonnants,
Prenez cistres, tabours, fifres haut-resonnants,
Donnez aux orgues vent: embouchez voz trompettes:
Animez violons, guiterres, espinettes:
Chantez tous d'vn accord: Ieunes and vieux chantez,
Et de vostre Sauueur celebrez les bontez.
DECE Cantique saint la douce melody
Rend and mon corpse pesant, and mon ame engourdie.
Ia ma test de fer s'encline doucement
Vne, deux, and trois fois deuers mon sein d'aymant:
La paupiere est du tout sur mon oeil abaissee,
Et ma plume de plomb chet de ma main lassee.
Et bref, mon corpse viuant proprement ne vit pas:
Caril est possede du friar du Trespass.
Lors le DIEV Sommeilleux, le viste, le peint Ange,
Qui plus souuent de front, qu'vn vain Protee change,
Morphee aux aisles d'or s'escoule lentement
Par la port de corn en mon entendement.
Chez soy l'ame si tossed ne luy permit l'entree
Que de tous soings humains elle fut seque stree:
Et qu'elle ouit ces verse doucement animez
Par le charmeur gosier des courriers emplumez.
CHOEVR DES ANGES.
CHantons freres volants: chantons tous d'vn accord,
Le los de l'Immortel, le los du DIEV tresfort.
Anciens qui merchants sur les voutes plus hautes,
Deux-fois-douze adorez l'Agneau efface-fautes,
Louez le auecques nous: and faictes que les cieux
Ne resonent voutez, que son nom glorieux.
SEVL il est, il sera, il fut tousiour en estre,
Des estres la fontaine, and des estres le maistre:
Un en trois, trois en un, distinct, non divise:
Qui dans le rien d'vn rien ce Tout a compose,
Et le tient en estat: o Citadins porte-aisles,
O vous vies sans corpse, o troops immortelles
Louez le de ceste oeuure: and si fair se peut,
Louez le encore plus de ce que doux il veut
N'espandre seulement les ruisseaux de sa grace
Sur celuy qui deuot son pur service embrasse:
Ains sur celuy qui meu de tell quelle foy
Mill menuz fatras mesle parmisa loy.
DIEV le monstre a ce coup. Mais quoy? ses vrais fidelles
Sentiront plus a plein ses faueurs eternelles.
DIEV, DIEV sera leur bras. Carpuis qu'il est ainsi
Que, clement, il poursuit d un paternel soucy
Ceux qui, Pharisiens, s'enflent de leur justice,
Que feroit-il a ceux qui confessent leur vice?
A ceux de qui l'esprit par l'Esprit Saint dompte
Ne veulent recourir qu'a sa saint bonte?
Puis qu'il aid a celuy don't le salut chancele,
Et que doit esperer celuy quil Esprit seele
Du cachet de salut? Puis qu'il p^rte faueur
A celuy qui se feint Sauueur dessus Sauueur,
Et s'adresse aux Dieux vains: o qu'il sera propice
A cil qui fait ses voeus au Soleil de Justice!
A l'Agneau sacre saint, a qui seul le Seigneur
A done de tout temps l'estat de Moienneur!
Chrestiens, s'il est ainsi que sa dextre combatte
Pour celuy qui, bigot, adore un Dieu de paste:
(Erreur par trop grossier) pourra il mespriser
Ses vrais adorateurs? pourra-il refuser
Aid a cil qui zele de son feu seul s'enflame,
Et qui fait pour son nom bon march de son ame?
Puis qu'il cherit celuy qui port au front escrit,
Trompe des faux docteurs, le seel de l'Antechrist:
De la grande Putain, de qui les mains cruelles,
Et par fer and par feu poursuiuent les fidelles:
He! n'aimera-il pas cil qui pour son amor
Est des cruels tyrans mal mean nuict and iour?
Qui luy rend tesmoignage? and qui dessus sa face
Port eternellement la marque de sa grace?
O SEIGNEVR fay cesser, fay cesser les trauaux
Qui torturent les Saints: done fin a leur maux:
Et chasse, o trois-fois Bon, l'ignorance profonde,
Qui d'vn nuage espais affeuble tout lemonde.
Et nous ses messagers d'astres clairs reuestus
Celebrons sa bonte, gloire de ses vertus.
Chantons tous d'vne voix, o bands emplumees,
Chantons, o Saint, o Saint, o Saint DIEV des armees.
Leur chant prendicy fin. Icy prend fin le mien.
O toy qui nes de faict moins que de nom Chrestien,
Bon coeur, espere en DIEV, qui mesme fauorise
Ceux qui n'ont seulement qu'vn vain titre d'Eglise.
Que si de l'Antechrist le blasphemant courroux
Plus felon que iamais conjure or contre nous:
Scache que DIEV cherit plus le corpse que l'ombrage
Chrestien, monstre a ce coup inuaincu ton courage,
Et t'asseure que CHRIST fera de ton ennuy,
Sortir proufit pour toy, sortir honneur pour luy.
FIN.
