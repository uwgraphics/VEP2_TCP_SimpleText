The two inseparable* brothers.
OR A true and strange description of a Gentleman (an Italian by birth) about
seventeene years of age, who has an imperfect (yet living) Brother growing
out of his side, having a head, two arms, and one leg, all perfectly to be
seen. They were both baptized together; the imperfect is called John Baptist,
and the other Lazarus. Admire the Creator in his Creatures.
To the tune of the wandering Jews Chronicle.


TO England lately news is come,
Which many parts of Christendom
have by experience found
To be the strangest and most rare,
That same did to the world declare,
since man first walked o'th ground.
I many Prodigies have seen,
Creatures that have preposterous been,
to nature in their birth,
But such a thing as this my ^^eame,
Makes all the rest seem but a dream,
the like was nere on earth.
A Gentleman well qualifide,
(...) bear his brother at his side,
(...)ably knit,
(...)e you may see,
(...) living be,
(...)t it.
This yong-man does completely walk*
He can both read, write, sing, or talk,
without pain or detraction,
And when he speaks the other head,
Does move the lips both Ruby red,
not speaking but in action.
This head and face is rightly framed,
With every part that can be named,
ears, eyes, lips, nose, and chin.
His vpperlip has some beard on it,
Which he who bears him yet does want,
this may much wonder win.
Oue arme's about his brother cast,
That does embrace his body fast,
the other hangs by,
These arms have (...) fingers all,
Yet as a child's they are but small,
pinch any part he will cry.
Only one leg with foot and toes
Is to be seen, and some suppose,
the other is contained
^^thin his brothers body, yet
(...) has him so to it,
^
The second part,
To the same tune.


YEt nothing does the lesser eat,
He Is only nourished with the meat
wherewith the other feed,
By which it seems though outward parts
They have for two, yet not two hearts,
this admiration breeds.
For sickness and infirmities,
I mean Quotidian maladies,
which man by nature has,
Sometimes one's sick, the other well
This is a story strange to tell,
but he himself thus says.
Th imperfect once the small pox had*
Which made the perfect brother sad,
but he had never any,
And if you nip it by the arm,
Or do it any little harm,
(this has been tried by many,)
It like an infant (with voice weak)
Will cry out though it cannot speak,
as sensible of pain,
Which yet the other feels not,
But if the one be cold or hot,
that s common to both twain.
Some seauenteene years of age they be,
A perfect proper youth is he
to which the less does cleave,
They were baptized being young,
Few then did think they would live so long,
as few would now believe.
but that to ratify this truth*
A(...) in the Strand this wondrous youth
is pre^ent to be seen,
And be with his strange burden, has
Bin shown (with marvel) as he says
to our good King and Queen.
John Baptist is the imperfect named,
Who through the christian world is famed,
his Brother which him bears
Was called Lazarus at the Font,
And if we well consider an t
a mystery in t appears.
From Italy their native place,
They have some certain late years space,
gone one still with another,
Indeed they cannot other wi^e do,
He that see's one must needs see two,
the brother bears the brother.
Through Germany, through Spain and France.
(Deuoyd of danger or mischance)
and other Christian Lands
They trauell'd have, nay rather one
For both, so many miles has gone,
to show the work of Gods hands.
And now in England they have been
About a month although unseen,
till now obtaining leave,
In seeing this or such strange things,
Let us admire the King of Kings,
and of his power conceive.
That just opinion which is do,
To him who is all good all true,
whose works we cannot find out,
Let admiration then suffice,
Since there is no man that is so wise,
but of s own wit may doubt.
And so do I
Martin (...)
