ADVISE, GIVEN BY A Catholic Gentleman, to the Nobility and Commons of
France, to join together, and take arms speedily (by commandment of the
King) against thieves and robbers, which are now abroad ruining the poor
people: Setting down an order and policy how they should take arms, to
avoid all disorder and confusion amongst them. Whereunto is adjoined, A
declaration published by the Duke de Mont-pencier for the reclaiming of the
Clergy and Nobility of Normandy, unto his Majesty's obedience, etc. With
certain news of the overthrow of the Gautiers, and diverse other rebels
against the French King, by the said Duke of Mont-pencier, on the sixth, and on
the twentieth day of April. 1589.

Translated out of the French into English, by I. Eliote.

LONDON Printed by John Wolf. 1589.

Advise given by a Catholic Gentleman of France, etc.
ALthough few days since, I set forth a book in print, containing four
Chapters, in the which I did at large advertise my countrymen of France of that
which they had to do, in this dangerous time of reuolting: yet seeing their
ruin to draw nigh daily, and that the greatest harm falls chiefly on the
Nobles, and on the poor pesants, who as it were utterly ruined and undone,
remain benumbed, not able to help them selves any thing at all, poor men,
being utterly spoiled of the forces that God gives them for their
maintenance and defense, I have bethought my self, to open them a way, and to
advertise them once again, how they may live peaceably one with another, and
to set them down the means, how they may disturb and hinder the quartering
and canto^ning of this state, that to their great prejudice, so many go about.
It is then to you, my Lords of the Nobility, and to you poor Country people,
that I address my self, laboring to make you know, how both your interests
go in this matter, and that you must not now forsake one another (as you do)
considering that now you have need to join your forces together, for your
common safeguard and defense. It is to you, I say, that I speak, Nobility of
France, but yet more particularly to you, pore countrymen, full of affliction:
for you make my soul full of pity and compassion, seeing you beaten, pilled,
and ransomed by the soldiers of this time on the one side, and seeing you on
the other side pinched and gnawed to the very bones by these Townes-men, which
laughe in their sleeves, and make a ieste, being safe themselves within the
compass of their walls, at your misery and calamity. You are the cause that
the tears trickle down from mine eyes, when I consider how all the world
does cousin and deceive you, and when I see none that do take in hand to
defend your cause: to be short, you make me die for very sorrow, seeing
you only bear the burden of the greatest part of miseries, that have
chanced to light on this desolate kingdom. For although God has made me a
Gentleman borne, and that I see those that are of the same quality, menaced to
have their part of the same dommage that you suffer, yet must I needs pity you
a great deal more then them, for that a great part of them have been so
miserable, as to help to work their own mischief, and procured yours
besides, by the rebellion which they have practiced against their king: they
had wit and understanding to know that they did ill, and nevertheless suffered
themselves to be blinded through their ambition and avarice, wherewith their
adversaries very crastilie serve their turn, to draw them to their party:
some of them took money, other some contented themselves with vain promises,
that they should have some dignities and honorable charges: but those are yet
possessed of them, whom the king has thought good to place therein: and with
these baits and deceitful persuasions of the mutinous preachers (which are
now infinitely scattered over this Monarchy) were they induced to offend God,
to hurt their Prince, the liberty of their Country, their posterity, their
particular friends, and by consequent their reputation, without the which they
are unworthy of the title of honor, that they bear: ye poor men did not
offend upon a iollitie, as they did, but if you have borne arms for these
rebellious persons, you have done it only following the example of your
unadvised superiors, who have made you believe, that it was the only means to
assuage the vehemence of the evil that did afflict you, and in that you have
done as he, who (feeling him self vexed with any grievous disease) takes
every thing that is proffered him in likeness of a remedy or medicine,
although it be sometimes very poison or death it self: so you thought that
they were skillful Physicians, who knowing your diseases would heal them, and
they are but counterfeit fellows, that making their profit by your disease,
seek to make it incurable, and to poison it: and that this is most true, you
see that after they have named the good medicines needful for you, they have
applied other that are clean contrary, bringing you no ease or comfort at all
thereby, as they did promise you, but so made your wounds to rankle, and grow
more grieuesome and painful unto you daily.

My friends, it is now high time, that you resolve your selves to withstand the
tirannous proceedings and pretenses of those, who have hitherto deceived you
with fair promises, to make you consent to their establishing and your own
ruin: it is now high time or never, poor people, that ye go about to seek
some remedy for the evil you suffer: and I can see none more fit for you, the^
to take arms, not with a confusion and disorder (as some amongst you have done
already) but with some good policy, in uniting your selves together under
the obedience of your King, and joining unto you such Gentlemen, as you shall
find desirous of your good: for even as in extreme diseases, it is requisite
oftentimes to use extreme remedies: so the oppressions that you feel, being
too rigorous and violent, you must needs disburden your selves of them by a
forcible and violent endeavor; and this is the reason, why I would have you to
take arms, according to the order that I shall set down anon, and not to
suffer your selves to be blinded and deluded by the fair promises of the
Lorraine Princes and their adherents, for they are those counterfeit
Physicians, that I spoke of even now, unto whom the prolonging of your malady
is profitable. In the beginning of their revolt, they made you believe by their
books made for the purpose, and by the Sermons of their Apostaticall
preachers, that they Catholics had then great need to conclude a league and
alliance among themselves, to ruin the heretics, and to prevent the
succession of any heretical Prince after our king, leaving out, I warrant you,
nothing that might make to confirm this proposition, and to make it be liked
of all that they could. Which proposition is very good, and most expedient for
all Catholics, if the effects were correspondent to the words: but in stead
of making an union of Catholics, they have used this holy pretext, to have a
cast only at the king, and to divide the Catholics by this means into
sides, bringing in by this division all the disorder and riot that you see at
this present in this Monarchy, and that yet you are like to see, if God put
not to his helping hand speedily. This is the cause that the Catholics are now
divided, and at variance among themselves, and that the honester sort call this
league an union of rebels, and a faction of conspirators: and the reason why
they call it so, is, because they have joined their drifte to reform the
estate, with the pretext of the holy League, whereby they have plainly meddled
with the king, and called his authority in question, that which the more
virtuous and honester sort cannot allow, for that (as I have said before, in
the second Chapter of the book that I have already setforth, and as I will
show you hereafter more at large) is not permitted of God: and see for
certain that which has caused all true Catholics to hate and contemn this
league and alliance, although they never found one word of truth in all that
the Lorraine Princes promised, being the first authors of this conspiracy.
They have sworn and protested to you (to encourage you, and to make you think
well of their factious fetches and proceedings) that they wish the ruin of
heretics, and under this false pretense they have attempted against their
King. They let their armies take up the best places of this Realm, and lodge
themselves and their soldiers, where never any soldiers came before, and the
profit that you reap thereby is, their troops of soldiers are round about
your Cities; who use and entreat you as Turks, and not as their Catholic
brethren, they promised to cause the Kings soldiers to keep good rule, and yet
you never saw more detestable thieves, then these that go to the wars now for
the^: these are, say they, Catholics of the holy League, and yet they force
women, they ravish the daughters of Catholics, they beat Priests, they prison
the^, and hang them up by the heels, to make them give money: they war, say
they, to ruin heretics, which have retired themselves into their houses, and
to clear the Country of them, but if any one show a countenance, as though
he would defend himself, they let him alone, and seek but those that are
without all defense and cannot resist, and specially above all, those that are
full of money, who have reconciled themselves within the compass of the
Church, and are retired under her protection and safeguard, those are they that
they seek, they take them first: he that embraces the Church, with them has
no better assurance, than he that renounceth her: It is enough to be an
heretic (say they) if a man have at this present a good purse, and a naughty
sword: they made an abatement of taxes to be proclaimed, but for every penny
that they have abated, they make it cost a crown: for in many places they have
begun to levy and tax for the maintenance of their forces, and for the m
unition of their fortresses: in sum, see how they have performed nothing of
all that they promised, and so far are they from leaving their fellonie and
rebellion, that they do what they can, every day to make you commit their
detestable insolences and villainies. The Duke of Maine in stead of going to
besiege Niort, that the Hugonites have taken in, speaks of nothing but
assailing his King, if he could assemble but forces sufficient: his adherents
cause now to be proclaimed in diverse Provinces (and chiefly in Normandy) that
the pesants and Countrymen have to arm themselves, without any leave or
consent of the Nobles, who are not of their side: and they say it is for the
defense of the common people. Know you what craft and subtlety they mean?
every one of them which has a good place already, has no less hope than to
make himself sovereign Lord of the Bishopric, Bailywicke, and Vicountie,
where his fortress is situated, yea, and to climb higher if opportunity
serve, and for this occasion they would be rid of those Gentlemen that dwell
near them, of whom they cannot be assured: but having no forces strong in ough
to set upon the^, they will make at your costs and deniers a company in every
hundred and vicounty at the least of twelve or fifteen hundred men well armed,
and having once armed you by the help of your own pursestrings, and appointed
Captains and governors over you at their own devotion and pleasure, they
shall win quickly a great number of you to the^, who shall serve their turn to
keep the other under, and to ruin (if they can) every one, whom they think is
not for them, from who^, they think, you might have some assistance, when you
should be a weary of supporting their tyranny; and even as they have set a
great part of the Nobility together by the ears, so will they do you to:
that this is most true, ye see already the great division that is happened
amongst you, and how in diverse places your next neighbors have murdered one
another in taking of parts, where they are diversely affected, and when you
shall be armed and joined together under these Leaguers themselves, and when
you shall have helped to establish them to the prejudice of good Catholics,
the Kings true and faithful servants: to be brief, when they shall be
settled peaceably in their governments, doubt not, but ye shall fall into
greater misery then so, for the ambition wherewith they are carried headlong
(receiving no limite) will bring them on to war one against the other, and
every one will labor to make himself greater by suppressing his neighbor,
and trust upon his intelligence that he shall have with forain Princes, in the
mean while that these Princes of Lorraine shall jar with those that they
shall find able to answer them: and as you see every Prince of Lorraine
seeks to have as good part in the Cake as another, and will not refer all
that they do to one sole man's authority: even so, if you look near into the
matter, do there adherents also, for every man thinks he has as good right
to have a piece, as the Duke of Maine to have all the whole himself.

The chief governors amongst them do saise upon the receipt of taxes for
themselves in every quarter, and use them, as if they were their own proper,
they grant out Commissions as they list, to leauie soldiers in their own
names, they enroll and cassere whom they list, they fetch down the bells out
of the Church steeples to cast them into Cannons, they take up and dismiss
soldiers, as they think best, they give protections and safegardes as they
please, they set prisoners at liberty, and they entertain gardes for their
own bodies, at the charges of the poor people: and to be short, they do all
things as sovereign Lords and masters, and depend no more of the name of
their Catholic Princes, but in this only that they find commodious for their
own establishment: and in deed some I know amongst them, who counterfeit to
take part with these Lorrainistes, and yet have intelligence with foreign
Princes, whom they think allianced unto them for their private gain, to hope
for the destruction of this estate.

See, poor people, how these rebels by their insatiable ambition have builded
their own ruin and yours together. See how they kindle amongst you the fire
of a perpetual civil war, and how they spoil you by that means of the
peaceable traffic, that you should have in your own Country by the
concourse of Marchantes from every place, abridging you thereby of the
liberty of humane society: and this is all the good you shall get, to take
arms under their authority, to help them to quarter out this Realm for
themselves: to be brief, this is the very means that they have found out,
to become masters of your persons and of your goods: but they fear that your
Lords and you are joined together to hinder the course of their pretenses, and
to set you at variance, to make you malcontent with the Nobility, they
persuade you to take arms, without ever craving any assistance of any
Gentleman, if he be not one of their own brood and conspiracy, promising
you that you shall not need to care, they will save you harmless, and that you
shall be no more pilled and taxed so long as they shall have the stronger
party, but by them and their companions: but after that you have forsaken once
your good governors and Lords, and shall be in disgrace with the greatest
part of the Nobility, (whom their honor and loialtie have sworn enemies to
this faction) God knows, how they will force you to contribute to those
things that they shall have need of, and how cruelly they will deal with
you, when they have taken from you all power to resist their tyranny. Refuse,
I beseech you, to arm your selves in this manner, oppose your selves to the
pernicious pretenses of these Leaguers, and follow not the example of those of
the Chapel of Gautier in Normandy: for all things done without order, are
also done without reason, and that which is done contrary to reason, has for
the most part an evil issue, and cannot prosper long. The Gautiers took
arms, asking no leave of their sovereign Lords, establishing amongst
themselves neither rule, policy, or any good discipline of war, and yet not
content with that, were they so shameless and impudent (as it was told me) to
have given forth, that they would conspire and lay their heads together
against the Nobility, wherein notwithstanding they show their gross
ignorance and want of judgment: for truly there is no realm in the whole
world, where the Gentlemen have more advantage over the pesants, then in
France, and I will tell you the reason, to the end that you may know, that you
cannot well attempt any thing without the nobility, and that you are not able
to hold out, having once war against them. First, you must grant me, that
it is not an easy thing to attempt against them, but they shall be by and by
advertised, by reason of the great number of them, and for that you have no
familiarity with them, nor access unto them, and by reason that they are
lodged within their strong Citadels, castles and houses of defense, within the
which you have none intelligence at all, and whether you frequent very
seldom: and again they never go into the country, nor depart out of their
fortes, but very well mounted, very well armed, and well accompanied, and you
are but footmen, and cannot keep always together, but you shall be greatly
combred, and turmoiled. But if you conspire against them indeed, and they
perceive it once, what shall you gain by that? You have no places of defense,
no ca^non to batter, no man to teach you how you should make your approches at
an assiege, howeyou should place all kind of batteries, how you should make
your trenches, how you should cut off a wing or tail of an army, how you
should set in order your maine-battell, and how you should choose out a fit
place for your fight: you have no cauallery: you have amongst you neither
general of the field, martial, master of the camp, nor master of the
Artillery: and to conclude, you have no body at all that can teach you how
to match like men of war, and so you can be, when you have al done, but a
sort of pesants in arms, and clownes in soldiers coats, amongst whom
falls out for the most part disorder and confusion, even then when you should
do some good exploite: so that we see daily by experience, that one hundred
under good conduct overthrow a thousand of this baggage race: and to say, that
in time these pesants would make good soldiers: admit that, yet that would
help you nothing: for soldiers will never take arms for pesants against the
Nobility: for that the true soldier retayneth the nature of a Gentleman, and
the Gentleman is not properly, and ought not to be more then a soldier, and
a man at arms in his perfection. None were made noble anciently in this
monarchy, but soldiers of mark, who had made proof of their valor, so
that as soon as any of you shall feel in himself the least spark of the
nature of a soldier and man at arms, he will forsake you straight, to go to
your enemies, and so you shall but make rods for your own tails. We read
in the Chronicles, that in the reign of king Charles the sixth, the pesants and
the handicrafts men of Limosin and of Poictou, did rise in arms against the
Nobility, who were hanged, almost every one, and putto the sword by the Duke
of Berry, and by the Nobles of these three Provinces. This one example, with
that I have alleged already, shall be sufficient to learn you, that it is
impossible by this means to prejudice greatly the Lords and seigniours of your
country, and also ye may see al they that ever have attempted the like, whatil
success they have had, except the Switzers only? but it was an easy matter
for them, because their Gentlemen had no fortresses, no engines of war, no
soldiers at commandment, none other weapons but such as pesants use, but
kept themselves for the most part pel-mell within towns and Boroughes with the
pesantes, being little difference at all between them, which gave great
assurance and facility to these vile pesantes to conspire against those, who
were not noble but in name only.

My friends, I beseech you then, follow mine advise, humble your selves before
the Lords and Seigniours of your Country, praying them to have pity and
compassion upon you, and that they would now assist and aid you: bear no
arms without their consent, or at the least without leave and consent of some
of them, and of some of those of the honester sort, and above all things, my
loving friends (whatsoever men may say unto you,) keep always the faith and
loyalty, that you owe unto your king: oppose your selves to all thieves and
robbers which march contrary to his commandment, who observe not the laws
of his Majesty, and care not a rush for the decrees of his Nobility: forso our
preachers preach unto them, and command them to do at this present day: but
for Gods sake consider, in stirring up (as they do) the Nobles to rebel
against their King, and the Commons against the Nobility, they do nothing but
overthrow all good laws, and confound all good policy. In very deed it were
lawful for Gentlemen to take arms against their king, and for the commons to
conspire against the Nobility, if you can show them where God commanded it:
for we must obey him above all. But if he forbid us to to do it, either we are
very Atheists, or else we must believe that he cannot teach us to walk in his
ways and statutes: yea marie, but here some of our rebels will reply and
ask: who can teach us better the will of God, then our mother the holy Church
his spouse? We are not the children of God, if we be not the children of the
Church, and the Church will not acknowledge us to be hers, if we obey not her
commandments: as for us, we believe that we walk in Gods laws, when we
follow the Church, the which teaches us to do those things which we do.
Alas! poor friend, the eyesight of thine understanding, blinded with the craft
of thy very enemies deceyueth thee. Thou take the shadow for the body:
that which thou call the Church, is not the true Church, the spouse of our
Savior Jesus Christ: it is but a part of his officers, which are but men full
of frailnesse, and subject to corruption and many infirmities, who have been
suborned by others and led clean out of the right way of the Church: are but
corrupt and naughty men, who being once made ministers of God, are now become
the ministers of the devil: and the reason why, because they tread the laws
of God and of the Church under their feet, and make laws and decrees at their
own pleasure, following their inordinate and unbridled lusts and passions,
and nothing else. There is great difference betwixt the sweet mildnes of the
Church, and the outrageous vehemency and heat of this rabble of wicked
Doctors, whom thou do take here for the body of the whole Church. They
say, that the King having imprisoned the Primate of Lions, and caused the
Cardinal of Guise to be slain, is no more the child of the Church, but that he
is banished and excommunicate out of the Church, that he has touched two that
are Gods anointed, and laid his hands upon two chief rulers of the Church,
against his faith and promise made, and that having failed and broken promise,
his people are not bound to obey him any more, and that all that assist him
are also cast out of the Church, and out of the union of Catholics. Unto whom
I answer, that they are themselves out of the Church, for that they do not
agreeable to the commandments of Jesus Christ, of his Apostles, and other his
Saints, which have written and preached his word, who have bin the true
Ministers of his Church. The Church is our true mother and not a stepmother, as
they would persuade us, she is full of pity, and merciful to her children,
desiring and seeking their salvation, even then most of all, when they have
done amiss, she shows them gently their fault, she calls them to
repentance, and waits on them, she uses no kind of rigorous correction
toward them, she keeps her door always open for them to enter in that
sekener: on the contrary side, these her officers, at the least, these of the
league and conspiracy of rebels do shut her door to all that would enter
in, if they be not partakers of their faction. They refused at the last
Parliament holden by the three general estates at Bloys, to receive into the
Church the County of Soyssons, one of their lawefull Princes, who came unto
them, the tears dropping down from his cheeks, confessing that he had done
amiss, craving pardon of God and of the Church, for that he had a little
while assisted the Hugonites, repenting himself thereof from the bottom of
his heart. The Church forbids vengeance, and reserueth it to God: and yet
they full of rage and fury, will revenge (if they can) the death of two men,
who have peradventure very well deseruedit. The Church for no crime whatsoever,
condemns any person to die, and yet these men replenished with rigor and
cruelty, would indite the County of Soyssons and other Catholics, who ask
every day pardon of God and his Church, for having taken arms, to their great
grief, against their Catholic brethren. They cry Crucifige, crucifige, after
this young Prince, because he has (say they) drawn his sword upon
Catholics, and these seditious fellows, whom they allow of and maintain in
their Sermons, ransom, besiege, kill and massacre good Catholics (be they
never so good livers) if they refuse to bear atmes against their soueraign
Prince. And albeit they cannot prove that such fellonie and riot is commanded
any where by God or his Church, yet they hold it an heinous crime to speak
well of the King, or to pray to God for his majesty. The Church commands
us to pray to God for our enemies, and these Leaguers will not pray so much
as for their King, so full of impiety are they: although that it be expressly
commanded of Gods own mouth, and accustomed from the beginning in the Church.
The servants of God, says Saint Paul, writing to the Corinthians, must be
humble to every one, fit to teach, suffering and abiding patiently the
wicked, gently instructing those that are out of the way: and our Church men
are clean contrary, arrogant, rigorous, impatient, seditious, and rebellious
to their King. The Church (as Saint Augustine says) does excommunicate no
person before he be called to the confession and satisfaction of his fault,
and before she have heard, what he can say for him self: and yet our
godly Preachers curse their King (although they cannot do it) for the death
of the Cardinal of Guise, having not yet heard what reasons he can allege
to justify himself, the which are peradventure more tolerable, then they
think they are. They say, he has put to death a chief Prelate of the
Church, over whom neither he nor any of his had any power or jurisdiction. I
answer for his majesty, that he has power and jurisdiction over the life
and goods of all his subjects, of what quality so ever they be, and if he
has caused his life, of whom they speak, to be taken from him, he did it
not as unto a chief ruler and Prelate of the Church, but as unto a wicked and
ungodly subject, an enemy to the common wealth, a disturber of public peace
and tranquillity, who had oftentimes attempted against the life and estate of
his Sovereign Prince. But if they reply that the Cardinal was not under the
correction of the King, I pray you let us see what Solomon the sage says in
his book of Wisdom. The mark of a King and sovereign Prince, says he, is
the power to make laws for all men in general, and for all men in particular
also, and this power he receives of none other but of God, who is the judge of
Kings, and who makes informations against them, when they do any thing
amiss, with all rigor. The Prophet David (whom I should have alleged first)
who did not speak, but by inspiration of the holy Ghost, said, that the King
and sovereign Prince has such authority and power over his subjects, that
he may dispose their lives and goods at his pleasure, and no man to gainsaie
him in aniething. And Isidore in one of his passages uses these words, The
kingdom of God (says he) draws nigh, by reason of this terrestrial
kingdom, to the end that those which are of the body of the Church, if they
offend, may be punished by the rigor of Princes, and that the discipline, to
the which the Church cannot bind them, be nevertheless kept by the power and
authority of Kings and Princes. This shows that the Cardinal of Guise might
be judged by his King, and being, as he was, guilty of treason, it is not a
thing now to be called in question or doubt any more. And yet this is the
point, whereupon our mutinous Cleargie-men do ground the reason and equity of
their rebellion, and yet they have small reason, God wot, for to defend it. And
that it is most true, to prove by all manner of ways that they are guilty of
fellonie, I will grant them (against my conscience and the truth) that the
King has unjustly caused the Cardinal of Guise to be slain, but is it for
them then to take vengeance, and to prohibit his subjects to show to him that
obedience, that they owe to the^r Prince? Let them read what Saint John
Chrysostom says in his book of the dignity of Priests: The Ministry of
the Church (says he) is a charge committed of God to teach lovingly without
any taking of arms, and not a power to give or take away kingdoms, and to
make laws for civil policy. And Jesus Christ in his Gospel by Saint Matthew,
said to his Apostles: The Kings of the earth reign over nations, but it shall
not be so with you. And in another place: Ye shall be carried before the Princes
of this world, and before their governors, etc.

If then the Apostles and other Saints chosen of God, have bin subject to the
power and authorities of sovereign Princes, as Saint Ambrose affirms: what
are our Clergy men more at this present day then they were, who would, if
they could, dispossess their King? Who attempt publicly against his
authority and honor? Are they privileged of God more then others are? Or
has Satan more power over them, then he has over others? For a truth I
believe, they are not assisted with the holy spirit of God, for I cannot
think that Gods spirit does inspire them to speak so unworthily of him,
whom his majesty has commanded them to obey. They call the King tyrant: and
none ought to be accounted such a one, except he violate the laws of God, and
the laws of nature, as they do, or else usurp the sovereignty over his
fellows and superiors, without express commandment from God, as the Duke of
Maine does. They say, the king is the protector of heretics, and yet cannot
prove that ever he refused to war upon the^, or that he did aid them in any
of their affairs: but they know very well, and they cannot deny, but that he
has oftentimes hazarded his own life, which is dear unto him, against them.
And that moreover he has day by day made edicts and proclamations against
them, and greatly to their prejudice, if they were well put in execution, and
if as great care were had to make them take effect, as they have to rebel
against his Majesty. They say moreover, that the king serves his own turn,
and has intelligence with heretics, and that he seeks nothing more then to
establish their sect in his kingdom: yet can they not show, tha this majesty
has ever made any of them captain of any of his forts, or that he has any of
that side, which is a servant of his household, or an officer of his crown:
nay but say they, he serves his own turn with their forces, which ill
beseems a prince most Christian, such a one as he is: and they can wish, so
full of loyalty are they, that he should commit himself to the guard and
protection of his evil minded subjects, who seek nothing else but his ruin:
to be short, they allege all things that they think might persuade you, that
the king minds nothing else, but to plant heresy in all the territories under
his obedience. But to show that, what they can say, are but lies and
impostures, let them prove the intention of his majesty, if they cannot
content themselves with the profes, that he has already made of the fervent
zeal that he bears to the Catholic religion, by sending to him some that
shall protest for them, that they shall reconcile themselves toward him, and
that they shall obey him, as good and loyal subjects ought to do, so that it
would please his Majesty to pardon them, and to permit them to war upon the
heretics: and I assure them if they do so, the king shall receive them into
his favor with all his heart, and shall augment their forces, as far as his
authority shall be able to further so laudable a purpose: and if he do not, then
shall they have occasion to blame him worthily. But if they refuse this means
of reconciliation, then may all Catholics that are near his royal person, and
all those besides that are his servants, think with themselves very well, if
they persevere in their presumptious rebellion, no good Catholics would be
offended, though he served his turn with the heretics of this realm, but
contrariwise they would wish him to call the Turk to his aid, if he thought
he might have any help at his hand. See then all the benefit that their revolt
should procure, shall serve but to put the heretics in assurance of their
affairs, and to make them live in tranquillity by reason of the great
division, that shall be brought in amongst the Catholics. They preach unto us,
as I have told you, that we are quite discharged from the obedience that we owe
unto our king: for that, say they, he is wicked, you must understand that, if
their false accusations and impostures be true) as though we were but bound
unto him, co^ditionally, and that our obligatio^s were limited according to his
good and wicked life: moreover they stop and take up, and cause to be taken up
the taxes and tributes due to their king, and yet we read in S. Mat. 22 that on
a time the Pharisees and Herodians seeking to entrappe our Savior Jesus
Christ, went to find him out and used these speeches unto him, Master, tell
us, is it lawful to pay tribute unto Caesar or not? Show me (says he) the
tribute money, and they gave him a penny. Then he asked them, whose image and
superscription is this? And they answered him, Caesar's: then, quoth he, give
unto Caesar those things which are Caesar's, and unto God those things which are
Gods. See then, who tells them, that they do not well to saise upon the tribute
of the King. What are they able to answer him? It is Jesus Christ himself
that speaks those words, and yet he of whom he spoke, believed not in him.
Was there ever anietyrant more detestable then Nabuchodonozer, who having
forced the City of Jerusalem, spoiled, wasted, and razed the houses and walls
thereof, burned the temple, defiled the sanctuary of God, and more than all
this, caused an image of gold made after his own likeness to be erected and
worshipped upon pain of being burned alive, to those that would refuse the
same: yet God called him his servant, and promised to make him a great Prince
and governor. And the Prophet commanded the people to pray for this monster
of nature, and for his children, that they might reign after him, as long as
the world should stand.

Let us proceed and see more particularly what the Apostles and other Saints
do teach us, concerning the obedience that we owe unto our Kings and Princes,
that she may certainly know, if it be lawful according to Gods laws, to
war against our King or not, or if you ought not (notwithstanding your
mutinous preachers) to keep inuiolablie the fidelity, that is due unto him:
for this is the chiefest point, that you ought to know perfitly, before you
take arms, to make choice of the best and surest side, for that in arming your
selves it most necessary to choose out some side to join unto, if you covet
to hinder these great masters amongst you, from quartering out the estate,
which they would easily do, if they had no sovereign head to answer and
make account unto.

Saint Peter the chiefest head of the Church, after whose example all true
ecclesiastical persons ought to rule themselves, did not teach us, that we
ought to measure the faith and respect, that we owe unto our king, by the
equiualence and measure of his loyalty: for when he saw Nero the very enemy
of God commit a thousand execrable cruelties, yet did he command Christians to
pray for him, and in his first Epistle, his second Chapter, he says: Submit
your selves unto all manner of ordinance of man for Gods sake, whether it be
unto the King, as unto the superior, or unto governors, as unto them that
aresent of him: and in the same Chapter says he: fear God, honor the King,
and your Superiors. That which Saint Paul does command us also, using these
terms: obey your Kings, although they be wicked. And writing unto Titus, in
his third Chapter, he says thus: Pet them in remembrance, that they be
subject to principalities and superior powers, and that they be obedient to
their governors. And to the Romans the 13. Chap. he says: let every soul be
subject to the higher powers, for their is no power but of god: and the powers
which are, are ordained of God: wherefore he that resists the higher power,
resists the ordinance of God, and they which resist bring upon themselves
damnation: for the prince is the minister of God for thy good: but if thou do
evil fear, for he bears not the sword in vain, for he is the minister of
God to take vengeance on him that does evil: wherefore ye must be subject, not
because of wrath only, but because of conscience also: for, for this cause ye
pay tribute also, because they are Gods ministers serving for the same purpose.
Give to all men therefore their due: tribute to whom tribute, fear to whom
fear, custom to whom custom, and honor to who^ honor belongs. These are
the words of S. Paul, unto whom the preacher agrees: Eccl. cap. 20. saying, we
must not speak ill of our king, nor offend him in any thing. Tertullian in the
30. and 37. of his book called the Apology, shows us clearly, that true
christians ought never to think, for any occasion whatsoever, to revolt and
rebel against their kings and sovereign princes. He says that the Christians
that lived in his time, did alwais so faithfully obey their Emperors, and pray
unto God for them, although they were the professed enemies of Jesus christ,
and that they would not rebel against their majesty's, although often times it
lay in their power to do, far surpassing therein the pagans and other nations,
that were in subjection under the said Emperors: forasmuch as (says this holy
man) that they did not find this to be lawful by the permissio^ of God. We pray
unto god, says he, for the safe guard and prosperity of our sovereign
princes: for we know that the imperial majesty is ordained of God, and that it
ought to be loved, honored and reverenced: for this cause also do we reverence
the Christian prince, whose majesty is next after Gods, from whose hand he has
his authority. These words of this holy personage are enough to teach us, (as I
think) my dear friends, that the evil life of the prince does no whit
discharge the people of their fidelity: S. Amb. also did not blame the
christians that did yield their due obedience to Julian the Apostata: he bad
the^ not (although they lived under the most disloiall prince of the whole
world) that they should rebel against him: but did pray the^ only to do no
thing against the honor of God, and rather to depart the territories of his
empire, then to suffer their consciences to be forced. What will our doctors
say to this? what will they answer to these words of these holy me^? They do not
say (as you may perceive) that it is lawful for the subject to attempt against
the life and authority of his prince, if he be an evil l^uer: but they all
command to the contrary, that we obey our sovereign princes what soever they
be, and that we pray unto God for the^, without any prescribing to our selves
the limits of the honor that is due to them, and to make it conditional.

People of France, these words of God and of his servants, ought to resolve
you, to keep firm footing in the love, fear and fidelity that ye owe unto
your king, and moreover you may see thereby, that our Clergiemen and other
rebels that are leagued together, are out of the Church rather, then those that
they condemn, whilst they go clean against all that god and his church do
command: and the preachers who do dissuade the people from the obedience, that
they owe to their king, do as Ananias the false prophet did, who for
prophesying against the obedience that God commanded the people of Israel to
show to Nabuchodonoser, died one year after by the just judgment of God. Ye
would say to hear these me^ preach, that their preisthod does license to injury
those that are right honorable, and that it exempteth them from punishment for
any fault that they shall commit: and besides that, it sets them free from
all homage and fealty that they owe to their sovereign Princes, whereas their
duty commands them the clean contrary.

But I would feign know of these good prelates of the Church, who causes them
to intermedle so far with matters of state, since that is no part of their
vocation. Had they rather abandon the Church altogether, out of the which they
are departed, then to forsake the affairs of this world? If they find the
King to be an evil liver in their own false judgment, why should they
refourme him, seeing it is no point of their duty? What matter have they
wherewith to charge his conscience, seeing they cannot prove that he ever
attempted any thing against the honor of God? Can any amongst them say
truely', that his Majesty has punished or caused to be punished any man for
his honest behavior, or for his good deeds? Is there any Catholic to be
found, that can say, and lie not, that his Majesty has wished him to become
an heretic, or to do any other villainy? Those that give alms to the poor,
that every day do their devotion at the Church, that spend the one half of
the year in fasting and prayer, and to be short, that seek by all means to
win heaven, can they justly complain, that his Majesty has reprehended
them at any time therefore, or that he has forbidden them to persevere in
their lawdable exercises of Christianity* upon what do they ground themselves
then to say, that the king is wicked, and a naughty liver: it is not upon his
cruelties, that he has done: for I do not think, that there ever was any
Prince in this state, less given to seek vengeance, and that took less
delight to shed and spill blood than he. I know diverse unto whom he does good
daily, and yet he knows certainly, that they have erst conspired against
his authority, and resisted his magistrates. And when they shall allege the
death of the Cardinal and Duke of Guise, I will but desire all them that have
any reason to consider advisedly, how intolerable a thing it is for a great
seignior and master, of the quality of our King to be misused, snapt up, and
controlled by his own subjects and by his own household servants, and I
assure my self, that those that would lay all partial affections aside, to
pause and consider of this matter aright, should see that the King could not,
being a man and subject to humane passions, wish any good unto these two
Princes, that had sought so near his life and honor. To say then, that he
should not have sworn unto them so solemnly to pardon them, and yet to keep
hidden that mortal hatred in his heart, I think well, and would not excuse
him, if I thought they had not extremely provoked him since the promise, that
it pleased his majesty to make them, and since the assurance that he had given
them: but forasmuch as I know the aduertismentes that the King had hourly of
their sinister meaning, I cannot blame him, that he has sought by punishing
them, to save his own life, his lineage, and his estate. In deed, say the
rebels, the King did well to prevent them, if he were sure that they were but
his own servants, but he should not have proceeded against them, so as he
did: but should have let them bin tried by way of justice, and so to have
proceeded against them: as though it had bin in the Kings power to make two men
prisoners, and to proceed against the^ by the way of public justice, that a
little before had chased him out of his principal city, and being accompanied
with an infinite number of thieves, came boldly before his Majesty and all his
magistrates and no man durst once lay hold on their collers. Further, as
though it were not lawful by the laws of God to punish in the field, and
without any long ceremony of indictment, to put to death those that are
convinced of treason toward their chief governors, as these were, of whom the
indictment was ready drawn, when their crime was proved, and they sound
guilty: and the proof was and is so sufficient, that al French men, except
those that be blind and of their conspiracy, may clearly perceive their
naughty driftes. To be short, since they had deserved death, it cannot greatly
skill, how they have suffered it, and there is no sufficient matter in that for
us to rise up in arms against our King: but I fear me, it will fall out to
the Duke of Maine, and to those that provoke and prick him forward to revenge
the death of his brethren (if he can) as it did unto Absalon, and to Achitophel
his wicked counselor, who for co^spiring against their King, and seeking to
bereave him of his authority, had both most lamentable and tragical ends.

I beseech you, let us now speak of another matter: ye are preached unto daily
and pricked forwards to arm your selves against your King, yea to resolve to
set upon him, and to encounter against him, I ask you but this one question,
if any one amongst you were so miserable as to have taken his life from him,
were it either in battle or otherwise, what recompense, do ye think, he should
have at the hands of the Duke of Maine, and other his confederates, the
professed enemies of his majesty: can you but think, that he would like well
of such a piece of service? No, no, masters, persuade not your selves so:
think that the reward he should have for his labor, should be a severe and
rigorous punishment. Know then, that the first thing that an usurper
pretends, after that he has established himself, is to rid himself of
such, who infringing their loialtie and faith to their natural Prince, have
aided to kill and murder him. And these are the reasons that move him, or
ought at the least to move him to do this, if he have never so little judgment
at all. First, to show that he has such treachery in horror, to purchase by
this means among the best reputation and fame to be of a generous and lofty
mind: secondly, to put the rest of his subjects in fear, and to make them take
heed by this example not to attempt the like against his own person: thirdly,
because he cannot live in security of such persons, but always stands in
great doubt of the^, fearing least they withdraw themselves from his service,
with as much facility, as they had before sequestered the fidelity and service
due unto their Prince. And this is the cause, why al rebels have to look to
themselves, and chiefly those that are thrust forwards to attempt against the
life of their sovereign Prince: for few of them, or none at all may be found,
that at any time have committed any such wicked and villainous acts, that have
not been punished with cruel deaths, and by the means of them, that had set
them on to execute their wicked enterprises.

Saul being slain in war, and his head brought unto David, who was
wrongfully persecuted by him, caused him to be put to death that brought the
same, saying that he ought not to wash his unclean hands in the blood of him
that God had anointed. Theophilus caused all them to be called before him,
that had murdered Leo Emperor of Constantinople, to establish his Father in
the Empire, being all come, and hoping to have some good reward for their
pains, he caused them all to be fair knocked in the head. Theodosius put to
death those that murdered Gratianus and Valentinianus, unto who^ he did
succeed in the Empire. Seuerus served with the same sauce those that slew
Pertinax. Vitellius, surnamed the cruel, put to death those villains, that had
cruelly murdered the old Emperor Galba. Domitianus caused Epaphroditus to be
strangled, for that he helped Nero to kill himself. And Alexander the great
caused him to be cruelly tortured, that had slain Darius his mortal enemy.
To conclude, the examples in all histories both ecclesiastical and profane
are rife of the tortures and punishments, that have bin inflicted to those
subjects and vassals that have co^spired to kill and murder their sovereign
Princes. Then my friends, fly the counsel of such as persuade you to commit
any such act of impiety against the persons of your lawful Princes and
governors, whom God has appointed to command and rule over you.

Orders conceived and set down for taking arms for his Majesty.
Having showed you already by the laws of God, and by all humane reason, how
dangerous a thing it is, both for the soul and body, to rebel against the
Prince and his authority. Now I would feign show you the means, how ye may not
only defeat all the crew of these thieves and ransommers, which gnawe you to
the hard bone, but also reduce your King into his former authority, and by
this means shall ye move his majesty to grant you that which ye so much
desire for your own good and contentment. See then here, good people of
France, the order that ye must observe in taking of arms, to the end ye
incur no suspicion of conspiracy against your King, and that his authority
may remain always in the hands of the Nobles, without whom the pesants can
do nothing, to whom also they are commanded by the laws of God to give honor
and obedience, as unto their superiors, that is meant, only to those that are
good members, the true servants of God and of their Prince, and lovers of
common peace and tranquillity: for as for others, it is very well done to
invade and set upon them, and as they themselves have denied their fidelity to
their sovereign Prince, so to deny them the honor and respect, that they
pretend to be due unto the^, from the which the common people are discharged by
the last declaration of the king.

First, there must be in every Bishopric, Bailiwick or Vicountie, one
General or chief man chosen, who must be a Gentleman of mark, a good member, a
good Catholic, and deuoide of any suspicion of favoring any part, but God
and his Princes. This General and chief man must take a note of all the
Parishes, Boroughes and villages that depend of his quarter or hundred, must
leauie in every Parish the number of soldiers, according to the greatness
and riches of the parish, must not leauie above 30. men in the greatest parish,
must take a note of all their names that are leauied, and divide them into
squadrons, and his squadrons must he divide again into companies, and his
companies must he reduce into one regiment or two, according to the bigness of
the Bishopric, bailiwicke or Vicountie. This General and chiefe-man must
name out the Captains, their Lieutenants, and Ancients. He must choose the^
such as be Gentlemen, or such at the least, that retain the name of Gentlemen:
and he must look diligently that he take none to have charge under him, that
is either of the Hugonites side, or takes part with the Catholic rebels. And
to avoid all troubles and divisions that such men may stir up amongst you, he
must give commandment, that in all the boroughs and thorowfaires, where many
houses are near together, that every man be furnished with arms, that is
able to bear them, and that rather the Parishes, villages, and hamblets next
adioining shall contribute some thing unto them, to help them to that which is
needful for the^. All these thorowfaires must be trenched in, and so fortified
with barricados and places of defense, that they may stop for a time the
troops of the enemy that would pass, till their next villages that are
friends and confederate with them, may be assembled, to help them to repulse
the said troops. He must forbid to make any alaru^ by sound of any bell, but
command the^ to have drums in every parish and village, to be kept in the house
of the elder Sergea^t or Corporal of that squadron: he must also forbid, that
no man leave his house, or forsake his affairs for any allarum that shall be
given, if he have not express commandment from the chief Commander, or from
one of his Captains, that is meant, if he be not enrolled and pricked for a
soldier, and this must be done, that the labor and business of the common
people be not ceased, and interrupted. And to avoid all disorder and confusion
in marching like trained soldiers, and not as armed pesants, they must forbid
upon great penalties, those that are not enrolled, that they carry not about
them, or keep in their houses any arms whatsoever, except chasing staves,
halbardes, pike staves and forkes to keep their houses withal, but as for
swords, daggers, and harquebuzes which are portab^le, going to markets, or
public meetings, no man shall have any privilege to carry, except he be
enrolled and pricked for a soldier: hereby to avoid co^bats, murders, and
vprores, which otherwise might fall out among the common people. Besides all this, he must appoint always one or two companies of foot me^ in every
Bishopric, bailiwick or Vicountie, who must be always ranging abroad in the
country, ready at an hours warning to fight, if need so require. This being
done, there is no Province in all this realm, wherein there may not be found
thirty or forty Ancients of footmen ready to fight and encounter with the
enemy, besides those that shall be armed for the guard of their own houses:
and this shall not so much charge the people, but for their finding, and some
money to have powder and shot, a matter of nothing: provided, that they do not
enrol more men in every Parish, then it shall be able to find and entertain
without any complaint or grudging. And this is the way for the pesants to
keep themselves in homage and amity toward the Nobles. For if the pesantes
take arms, as they have done already in many places disorderly, no man
doubts but we shall see them and the Nobles quickly together by the ears,
and so they will straight utterly ruin one another. In every Bailywicke they
must choose none other General and chief, then the Bailiefe himself, so that
he be a Gentleman, making profession of arms, and that it be known (as I
said even now) that he make account of nothing more, then the service of God
and of his Prince, and the tranquillity of his Country. But if the Bailiefe
be suspected for an heretic, a rebel or fellon against his King; or be
unwilling to take his charge in hand, then must they choose some Gentleman of
the same bailiwick, if any be there capable of such a charge. But if there be
found any Gentleman that being more ambitious then well affectioned to the
benefit of the communaltie, will not suffer their tenants and vassals to
follow this order prescribed, yet their said vassalles shall not let to join
themselves with other, that take arms, and so jointly, and by the authority
of their Generals, shall declare such Gentlemen unworthy of their quality,
and enemies to the common wealth, according to the declaration of the King in
that behalf proclaimed. This is the order that ye must observe in taking
arms, that ye may not be odious and injurious to your King, and that hereby
ye may avoid al division and trouble which might arise amongst you in doing
otherwise. I beseech you then that you would begin to put this in practice, as
soon as ye possibly can, assuring your selves, that when ye shall put this in
execution, either by force or fair means ye shall make these Lords and
Gentlemen of the Towns that now do misuse you, and eat you up almost, be
glad to join with you. Courage then my Lords of the Nobility, begin you, and
your Tenants will all follow. What? do ye think that your Tenants shall be
ruined, and ye shall feel no smart? Know ye not that your interests and theirs
go both together, and that their good is your benefit also? Why then do ye
delay the time to succor and aid them? Do ye stand in fear, the Duke of
Maine, who calls himself a friend of the commons, will hinder you from the
establishing of this order? Persuade your selves my friends, that if it lay in
his power to do, I would have left this unspoken, and I would have taken
better heed to keep this matter secret: but I see well enough that he cannot
do it, (and that for two or three reasons, that I will set you down) and that
it consists but in viewing and knowing your own forces to become peaceable,
and so to set your king in his former authority again, maugre all the
resistance that may be made herein. For the power and forces of the rebels are
not such, as they are presupposed to be: they have in deed some towns at
their commandment: but their is not one of the towns that is for them, but is
environed at the lest with a dozen great boroughs, the which in one five days
you may make capable for the cannon: and this cannon must not be brought from
place to place in post-haste, but with such reasonable charges and expenses,
that they may be well able to furnish. Besides they have so few soldiers,
that ye are twenty to one: and yet the soldiers that they have are no better
men of war, nor of more experience then you. To be short, ye have many
advantages over them, that I will conceal, till such time as I see your arms
in hand. Resolve then your selves to assail them, or otherwise you will
quickly curse the hour that ye did not credit me. Are ye not ashamed to see
these leaguers to compel and force you as they list, who are far your
inferiors: I may well call them your inferiors, because the greatest Lords,
and the third part of Gentlemen of mark in this Realm are enemies of this
rebellion, and yet you see a a number of little petty Captains that pill,
spoil, rob, beat and ransom the Priests and the poor people, and yet ye
will not resist them: but let them take such heart at grass, and such
advantage over you, that they presume to besiege, and to war upon Catholics
of great honor, that resist their insupportable insolency and outrageous
dealing.

My Lords, to conclude, I beseech you all make no delay to take your arms in
hand, to make these troublers of our state to lay down theirs, and do not
doubt but shortly ye shall see, that those few men of quality, that they have
amongst the^ now will forsake them, and join with you, confessing that they
have done amiss, and acknowledging themselves bounden by their loialtie and
particular interest, to take your parts: I beseech God give them the grace, so
to do, that altogether we may follow that way without any division, which is
most honorable, and most profitable for restoring of the peaceable estate and
government of our Christian common wealth.

FINIS.
A DECLARATION PVBLISHED for the reconciling of the Clergy and Nobility of
Normandy unto the obedience of his Majesty, by the Duke of Mont-pencier Pecre
of France, Governor and Lieuetenant general for the King in the Duchy of
Normandy.
FRRANCIS OF BOVRBON, Duke of Mont-pencier, of Saint-Fargeau, and of
Chastelraud, Daulphin of Auuergne, Peer of France, Sovereign of Dombes,
Prince of Roch-sur-yon, Marquis of Meziers, County of Castres, of Morrain, and
of Barfur Seine, Vicount of Auge and of Brosse, Baron of Beauiolois, Thiert,
and of Mirebeau, etc. Governor and Lieutenant general for the King, in his
Duchy of Normandy, to whom these present letters shall come, sends
greeting. Perceiving since our arrival in these parts the subjects of my Lord
the King, fallen into an open rebellion, and the greatest part of them to take
arms against his Majesty's service: having also intelligence, that since some
meetings and skirmishes, wherein a great number of the inhabitants of the
Cities, and villages of this province, have been defeated and overthrown, they
have signified unto us by their humble supplications, that they desire to be
received and reconciled into the obedience and service of his Majesty: the
which we tendering, desiring to preserve many of his Majesty's natural
subjects, that by allerements and wicked persuasions have inta^gled and joined
themselves with many other naughty and il disposed people, in the said
rebellions and conspiracies. We have made, according to the good pleasure of
our Sovereign Lord the king, a certain Declaration touching the reunion and
reco^ciling of the inbitants of the said cities, and villages, and caused the
same to be read and published in this City of Caen. And forasmuch as diverse
of the Cleargie-men, and of the Nobility have put in their finger, and been
favorers, and adherents in these rebellious enterprises, so that we should
have great cause to prosecute them, and proceed against them, as against
rebels and perturbers of the peaceable government of our common wealth: yet
considering somewhat nearer, that such way of proceeding might bring some
preiud^ce unto this estate, being all natural subjects of his Majesty: we
have better advised, that both the Clergy men and Nobility might have safe
means to bring themselves back unto their natural duty and allegiance,
and that we with all lenity might further and help them therein, as much as
possible might be: WE DO TO WIT: that by the assurance that we have of the
mercy and clemency of his Majesty toward his said subjects: and after that
we had fully taken deliberation of this matter, by the advice of his counsel
assisting us herein, We have declared, and do by these presents signed for the
same cause with our own hand, declare, That we have freely taken and received,
and do take and receive into the safeguard of my Lord the king, and into our
own protection all ecclesiastical persons of what quality or condition
soever they be, having taken the oath according to the form prescribed by his
Majesty: or shall take the same within ten days after the publishing of this
declaration, made before the bailifes or their deputies in every vicountie. And
if any of the said ecclesiastical persons shall refuse to take the said oath
before or within ten days being limited, the said term being once expired,
all their goods and temporal revenues shall be saised upon and put in the
hands of Commissioners that shall give account thereof, etc. when, and to
whom it shall appertain: deducting always their ordinary charges, and so
much as shall discharge their benefices and spiritual charges. Provided
further that the Bishops, their Vicegerents, or others that have authority
thereunto, shall procure that some person that is capable and not suspect, and
such a one that has taken the oath aforesaid, shall serve and supply their
turns in their spiritual vocation and calling. And they shall moreover
enioine them to make prayers and supplications for the health of his Majesty,
and for the prosperity and good success of all his affairs, as they ought to
do, and are naturally bound thereunto. And as for those of the Nobility, who
have not borne arms for his Majesty's service, and taken the said oath of
allegiance, we enioine the^ in like manner within ten days to take the same
oath administered by our own hands: or el e before the Bailifes or their
deputies, every one in their own jurisdiction, at their own choice, and as
they shall think best. In doing this we have also received and taken them into
the safeguard of his Majesty, and into our protection. But as for those of the
Nobility which are revolted, and have taken arms against the service of his
Majesty, and be yet prisoners, if they desire to enter into reconciliation,
and take the said oath, they shall have their passeport from us: the which
shall be granted them, by the certificat of any Catholic Gentleman, servant to
the King, who shall have taken the said oath. And of these passeports shall
be made and kept a true register: So may the said Gentlemen come before us in
all assurance, to take the said oath, as we shall administer it unto them, by
our own hands, Unto the which they shall be admitted, in putting in good and
sufficient sureties to perform and continue the service that they owe unto his
Majesty, not prohibiting them the use of their arms, but after the said
passeports are once granted unto them. And if the said Gentlemen shall fail to
do this within the said ten days, the term of the said ten days being out,
their goods shall be seized upon, and be put into the hands of my Lord the
King, and remain in the safe keeping of Commissioners, which shall give an
account thereof, and answer for them, etc. when and to whom it shall
appertain. Of which oaths so taken, as well by the Cleargie-men, as by the
Nobility: likewise of the ^easing of their goods and revenues, the said
bailifs or their deputies in every Vicountie shall frame process in writing,
and send them unto us within three days, after the said ten days be expired,
upon pain to answer for them in their proper names and private persons. And
we do straitely charge and command the said bailises, or other deputies in
every Vicountie of this province, that they cause these presents to be read,
published and registered, and that they keep, observe and fulfill every point
of the contents hereof, according to their form and tenure, and that for this
cause, they constrain all those who^ these presents shall touch, by all lawful
means and reasonable order of justice, that they assist and suffer the same to
be executed: no^ obstant all contradictions and appeals whatsoever, and and
without all prejudice of the same: for the which it shall not be lawful to
defer the execution hereof, considering the importance of that which is above
said, is for the benefit and service of his Majesty, and for the
preservation and tranquillity of his estate. Given at Caen, the fifth of May
1589. Signed: Francis Bourbon. And on the other side: by my Lord L'Amoureux.
And sealed with the great seal of my Lord in red wax.

the Duke of Montpencer Governor and general Lieutenant for the King in
Normandy, have been published by sound of trumpet in the chief and most usual
places of this City, to make cries and proclamations for our Lord the King: By

Trumpet, this ninth of May 1589. I have set to my hand in the presence of
Michael Maillard: John le Coq of Caen, and diverse others for the same purpose
there assembled in great number.

SIr it grieueth me not a little, that I have heard no news from you of long
time, fearing lest in this so miserable a time (the which I must needs confess
is the very father and affourder of the greatest afflictions and most
intolerable calamities that ever were seen in our poor nourse and mother the
Country of France) you have met with some ill rencounter, which has hindered
you so long from imparting unto me your letters, whereby I might understand
how you had your health and welfare all this while, the which I beseech the
good Lord long to preserve unto you, and once to do me this favor, that by
some good token I may show the great affection that I bear to your service:
for I protest unto you, that next after the honor and fear that I bear unto
God, the obedience that I owe to my prince, the respect and loyalty, whereby I
am bound to my Lord and master, there is nothing in the whole world that I
desire so much, as the continuance of the mutual amity between us two. By the
means whereof I live content, and rejoice in my heart as often as I call it to
my remembrance. And although as yet I have not manifested it unto you, yet you
must think, Sir, that it has not been for lack of good will, but by reason
of some occurrences, the true guides of all human actions, the which have not
permitted me to execute and perform the singular affection that always I
have borne unto you. But sure I had written to you ere this time, had I not
since mine arrival in this Country of Normandy found the said Country so
divided by the factious and entising persuasions of many wicked ministers and
pastors: but why do I call them pastors? rather rauishing wolves disguised
under sheep skins, who being won with sums of money and fair promises to
the rebel conspiratours, enemies against his Majesty, have so long and so
much broched their detestable villainy, and infected this poor Country, so
that there is not one town or fortress, not so much as a village or borough
clear, but has drunk and tasted of their poison wherewith they have filled
them so full, that all the subjects of his Majesty burst out into an open
rebellion against him: and under the pretext of religion and piety that they
have at every word in their mouth, and of a fantastical liberty wherein
they make these poor and miserable souls believe they are set, they have made
them so drunk and berest of all common reason, that there is no place in all
the Country, be it never so little, where a man may not find some of this
cursed crew of rebels in all estates and qualities: for the very Bishops
themselves are the chief pillars of this rebel^ion in most places: all the
Nobility and most of the Country towns assisting them herein. I except
certain towns which have contained themselves within the obedience of his
Majesty, because those of the better sort have stood fast. But I cannot see
any one Town at all, wherein some have not bin found that have swarued in
some points: and some there are amongst the rest, that have declared themselves
open enemies to his Majesty, renounced his obedience, and given forth such
villainous, unworthy, and traitorous speeches of him, as nothing more vile may
be named or spoken. The only Town of Caen may exempt it self, to be one of
the constantest, and one of the least attainted in this disloialtie: for by the
good order that Monsieur de la Veronne, governor, and Captain general of the
said town has taken, who by his loialty toward his Prince has won
himself immortal reputation, being assisted with Monsieur de Beuuron, who
came thither moved with a seruent zeal and desire, that he had to emploie
himself in the service of his Majesty, in such affairs and occurrences as
should fall out, and besides of many other honest personages, as well of the
Magistracy as of the inahbitants of the same city, it has contained it self
within the obedience of his Majesty, and in this may vaunt to have preserved
the whole Province, whereas all other towns, as Roan, Lisieux, Falaize, Seez,
Bayeux and Argenten, have all shaken off the yoke of obedience, and set open
their gates to the chief captains of the rebels, who have in every place bin
received and obeyed, except in Caen aforesaid, Allenzon, and in some other
towns toward Constantine, so that I assure you, if Caen had revolted too, all
Normandy had done the like. That which his Majesty foreseeing, advised to send
my Lord the Duke de Mont-pe^cier Prince of his blood, his Governor and
lieuetenant General in this Province, and sending him with great expedition
from Tours commanded M. de. S. Cire, one of his Counselors and master of
Requests of his house, to accompany and assist my said Lord. Who departing
from Tours, accompanied with the Lords of Bacqueuille and de l'Archant came to
Luce, where he had intelligence that Sir Boisdaulphin, la Moth-serrant, and
other rebels which had surprised, and do hold the Town of Man's, had purposed
to meet with them by the way. Nevertheless although they were far stronger
and better appointed than he, this generous heart of the House of Bourbon,
whom no fear could ever daunt, determined to pass, and did in deed pass
hard by the nose of his enemies, and came as far as Allenzon, where he found
the inhabitants of the town sore amated, for the surprising of the town of
Man's, next neighbor unto them, and besides being inueigled to enter into this
supposed union (or to speak better) rebellion, reduced them wholly, and
confirmed them in their good meaning and obedience toward his Majesty,
declaring unto them how he had forgiven them and all the inhabitants of
Normandy, the third part of taxes due unto him, hoping a better opportunity
and more happy season would come, when he might gratify them in some
greater matter. There my Lord imitating the fervent zeal of his
predecessors, most Catholic Princes of the royal family of Bourbon, did
keep his Easter with great devotion and solemnity, and was present at divine
service, as were also all those that were of his suite and train, with great
reverence and devotion. Having given order the twesdaie for the said City,
and to assure the inhabitants thereof, made provision of forces for the
Castle, and leauyed two companyes of shot on horseback to remain in
garrison in the same Town to keep it, and the villages round about, to
repulse the rebels that would come to forage and constrayne the inhabitants
to pay them taxes and other tributes due unto his Majesty. My Lord having
committed the charge thereof unto the Lord of Rentie governor of the said
place, he departed thence, and for that it was signified unto him that those of
the town of Sees were minded to join with the said rebels, and had not in deed
taken the oath, according to the form prescribed by his Majesty, as it was
sent unto them by my said Lord, he purposed to pass that ways and sent word
before unto the Bishop and to the inhabitants there, that they should set open
the gates for him. Whereupon after a little consultation had amongst them, they
made him answer, that they were ready to receive him. Which they did, a great
part of the Citizens meeting him a good way out of the town: into the which my
Lord entered with Monsieur de Bacqueuille, L'Archant and their troops, and
passed through the said town without any stay, purposing to march on
straight, and to enterprise nothing in this City, but to signify to the
Bishop and other the inhabitants here, the cause of his voyage, and how the
King meant to deal well and favorably with all his subjects, and to
acknowledge and make account of them according to the duty and obedience that
they should show toward him. Then every man protested himself to be most
loiall and affectionate subjects of his Majesty, but I think some of them
spoke with their lips, that which their heart never thought, as by and by ye
shall understand. Departing from Sees, we met with my Lords de Hallot, and de
Creuecoeur, accompanied with a good and honorable troop of the Nobility (who
were assembled before, staying for our coming, and had had some skirmishes and
meetings with the rebels) unto whom they did offer with many protestations to
serve the King faithfully as long as breath was in their bodies. Who were
straight entertained of the Duke, and the soldiers of both companies joined
together: then were we above 300. horsemen, all men of war, and a most brave
and resolute troop of Nobles. Ye must imagine that there was none that with
all his heart did not detest the ingratitude and sinister meaning of therebells
toward his Majesty, and did not condemn them, and menace their overthrow.
From thence my Lord the Duke determined to go to lie at Escouche, which is a
borough well fenced, some two leagues from Argenten (whether my Lord did mind
to go: but having intelligence that those of the said town, through persuasion
of Monsieur de Brissac and the Magistrates of the City, had taken the rebels
part, having no pieces of artillery, nor any footmen to force them, went
further) The morrow which was the wednesday, being the fifth of this month, the
Duke departed from Eschouche, and drew toward the City of Falaize. Out of the
which Monsieur de Touschet, Anger-Ville, Normandiere and diverse other rebels,
who had saised on that City a little before (by intelligence that they had
with the lieuetenant of the said Lord of Brissac Captain of Falaize) did
depart, having a good number of horsemen, with many lanciers, and a number of
footmen to stop our passage, and they marched on til they came near a village
called Pierrefite, two miles distant from Falaize, where they being met withal
by the Lords of Bacqueuille, de L'Archant, and Creuecoeur, who lead the
coursers, they had a brave charge, and stood little to the fight: for my Lord
the Duke leading the maine battle, beginning to appear, they took their
heels and began to fly: yet left behind the^ de Touschet, Angerville, and
Normandiere, their chiefest leaders, who were taken prisoners, and brought
before the Duke, who redeliuered them into the hands of those that had taken
them, till such time as he should call for them again, all the rest of their
company being hewn in pieces, or else laid in rout, not one of our side
being lost, and but only Monsieur de Chaumont, who was hurt in the head with a
cortl^s, and his horse slain with a thrust of a lance. But now, God be
thanked, he is recovered again, and feels no more pain. From thence my
Lord came to Falaize, where they made a false show, as though they would set
upon the gates for him, but they never meant it, so that being not able to
force them, he came into this City, where I can assure you he was honorably
received and with great shoutes of all honest men, criing: God save the King,
and my Lord the Duke of Mont-pencier. All the Town kept that day holie-daie,
the chiefest of the City, with whom was Monsieur de Beunron acco^panying him
to his lodging, which was in the house of the Lord President d'Aubigny, a
very honorable personage, and besides an honest man and a true true subject
to his Majesty. Whether came unto him my Lord de la Veronne to salute him,
and to do his reverence unto him, whom he received courteously and
honorably, and commended him highly for his good mind and loyalty that he
had showed to the service of his Majesty, in garding this Town within his
obedience. There arrived on the morrow the County of Thorigny, and a little
after him Monsieur de Longaunay with a great troop of Gentlemen, who were all
welcomed and embraced by my L. the Duke de Mont-pencier with great thanks
for their good affection toward him, whereof he did protest to advertise his
Majesty, and to requite it in particular, as occasion should serve. Here my
Lord seeing himself to be strong, determined by the advice of the Lord de S.
Circ, to war upon the rebels, and to make them to leave that they held so
fast in that Country, and for that they had the greatest part of the Towns
and Cities, he resolved to carry along some pieces of Artillery, to force
them, if possibly he might, although his footmen were not many. He sent
away before Monsieur de Hallot, Bacque-ville, and l'Archant, to saise upon
the City of Falaize, with the regiment of Monsieur de Tracie, the companies of
Monsieur de Saint Denis Maillot, and of the Captains le Radier, Chauuain,
Daulphin, Roque-ville, Glaize, and other voluntary Captains, and on the
Sundaie the sixteenth of this month, my Lord caused a general procession to
be made, and caused a Sermon to be preached, with certain prayers that they
made for the safegarde of his Majesty, and the good success of his affairs,
the which had been but a little before discontinued. On the mondaie the
eighteenth day, my Lord appointed officers over his treasure and money, and
over his victual and artillery, and departed himself with two Cannons, and
one bastard Culuerine, not hoping so much to force Falaize, for that he had
not sufficient munition and powder, as to draw the enemy out into the plain
field. The same day he arrived at Falaize, and was lodged at Saint John's
Abbie. The artillery was planted the same night, but on the morrow being
Twesdaie, the eighteenth of the month, finding that the battery could not
well be made in that place, they displaced them again, and laid them lower
right over against the house of Monsieur de la Fresnay, Lieuetenant general in
the Bailiwick of Caen. So on the wednesdaie the battery began, and continued
till three a clock in the after noone. By that time three towers being bat^red
down, lay open outwardly: Unto every one of which towers, they thought good to
send a Sergeant and ten soldiers to take a view thereof, to see whether they
might lodge there or not, that on the morrow they might further those that
should come to the assault and breach, which they meant to make between the
two towers, and to dislodge the enemy from the trenches if he had made any,
and that the rest of the two companies, whereof were the two Sergeants, should
keep themselves in batt^ile raie in the rampire, lying over against the ditch,
to safeguard the other soldiers into the towers. These Sergeants with their
soldiers went boldly hard to the bottom of the wall of the said two towers,
and taking a view of them, found that they were too deep, to lodge in any
wise within them, and by reason that those within made little resistance, the
Captains of the said companies were of opinion, that the town might be forced
and taken that ways, whervppon they stouping a little, entered boldly into the
ditch that was deep and without any water: and after them followed all the
Nobility that was there present without any advise or commandment from their
General, and ran into the ditch, some armed, some unarmed, and some with
their swords only in their hands, and walked so boldly hard by the walls,
and with such a courage and resolution, that I may assure you if their had
been but one hole through the wall, that a man or woman might have crept
through, the said town had been straight our own: but that good God that is
careful to preserve those that be his, would not suffer so great a mischief
to fall upon us: but rather having respect to the right and equity of the
cause that we maintain, left no possibility for us to take the said city:
and caused that the retraite being sounded, al our men retired with very
little loss: for the enemy that had another drift and conspiracy against us,
made no account to repulse our men, but would willingly that they had entered
in, that they might have executed their naughty fetch, co^triued by the
County of Brissac, the Lords of Pierrecourt, and of Long-champ, the Barons of
Vernie, of Eschauffour, of Tubeuf, and other ringleaders of the Rebels, who
when they durst not come into the field to encounter with us, thought by this
surprise to have entrapped us at Falaize, and for the same purpose had they
assembled the flower of all their rebel forces, and having taken from about
l'Aigle, Orbec, Seez, Argenten, Vimoutier, and other places near thereabout, a
company of more then six thousand men, Gautiers, as well appointed for
muskets and harquebuzes, as may be said, amongst whom they did mix some seven
or eight hundred common soldiers, such as they could come by: some Nobility
also of the weaker sort, but a great number of Priests, Canons, Monks, and
other ecclesiastical persons, having conveyed all their forces near to
Argenten, where the tho Lord de Brissac, accompanied with the Barons of
Eschauffou, of Tubeuf, the Lords of Vieupont, Roquenual, of Beaulieu, of
Aunay, and other chief captains of the said rebels received them, and
conducted them the right way to Falaize, thither came the Baron of Vernier with
his forces from about Damfront, thither came also the Lord of Pierrecourt with
those that he could make out from Pontau-de-mer out of the country of Auge, and
from Honnefleur, thinking now to atchieue their wicked enterprise: But they
were deceived, for the Duke having advertisement the Wednesday night of their
pretense, provided for them, and taking advise of the Nobles that were with
him, removed the Artilleric from the trenches, and sent away his cannons to
Courcy (a castle very well fortified, two leagues from Falaize) and resolved
with the said Coluerine to meet the enemy in the plain field to encounter
with him, which he did, after that the Lord of Emery, one of the Marshals of
the field had taken view of them, and by his report, as also of diverse others,
it was known for certain, that they were lodged in three Villages very near
adjoining the one to the other. He appointed the Lord County of Thorigny, of
Longaunay, and the Lord of Vicques the elder brother, to lodge with their
troops betwixt the said villages and Argenten, to keep them in on the one
side, and the Lords of Bacqueuille, de l'Archant, and de Beuuron with their
companies to enuiron them on the other side, and the Duke himself came full
upon them marching with the whole army, aided with the Lords of Hallot and his
own brother, and being on the top of a little mountain, commanded the Lords
of Emery and of Surene, Marshals of the field, to advance the Infanterie which
was upon the left hand with the Coluerine, the which they soon did: For
although our footme^ were very few, yet those that we had were so hardy, and
their leaders who were the Lords of S. Denis, Maillot, du Radier, de
Roqueuille, Chauuain, Daulphin, Glaize, and other voluntary, so hardy and sure
men, that they made no delay, but skirmished strait, and their enemies did the
like, shooting many musket and harquebuze shot from both sides, but as soon as
our Coluerine began to play in their faces, the rebels began to be much
amazed, and my Lord Brissac himself caused his Cornette to turn bridle, and
retired with some number of horses and horsemen as hardy as himself: yet did
these rebel troops after the first Coluerine shot, which had not much hurt
them, stand to the fight: but when they heard the Coluerine roar the second
time, and saw the Lord of Vaumarte, one of their chief leaders and fourteen
or fifteen others carried away with the shot, they began to shake: Then my
Lord the Duke commanded a fresh charge, which was given so hot and fierce,
that all the said rebels were put to the chase, most of them put to the edge
of the swoorde, and some taken prisoners. There might you have seen a gallant
company of noble Gentlemen affectioned to the service of their Prince. But it
is impossible to speak with what resolution and valor these troops, and
those of the Lords de Hallot and of Creuecaeur his brother, which followed him
hard, did enter perforce among the thickest of these miserable and mutinous
rebels, nor with what resolution my Lord the duke de Mont-pencier did lead
them to the fied, and marching foremost in battle did encourage those that
followed him, so that this race and scumme of rebels not able to abide the
brunt, were forced to yield and fall down under their most victorious hands,
some flying this way and some that way, to escape death, but all in vain, for
the slaughter was so bloody and so great, that of all those that they found at
the first village called Pierrefite, which were about two thousand men, there
escaped not one only man, or very few ifthere did any, but were either
slain or taken prisoners all. The troops assembled again, my Lord the Duke
set upon the second village, called Villiers, where he found another great
company of Rebels, under the conduct of the Baron of Tubeuf, who escaped not
so well as the former: for whatsoever we met withal there, felt either fire
or sword, without any mercy, the Baron of Tubeuf and few others excepted who
were taken prisoners. And because the night drew on a pace those which were
lodged in the their villages called Commeaux, who were not above a thousand or
twelve hundred men, amongst whom were diverse gentlemen, as Monsieur de
Beaulieu, and other Clergymen of Seez, many of them being Curates, (and
amongst others there was the Curate of Vimoustier, the most pestiferous
mutinous and seditious fellow in all Normandy) held out a while and skirmished
a little with the Captains le Radier and Chauuain, but Monsieur de Beaulieu
was by and by taken at the entrance of the fort, and being carried by the said
Captain Chauuain, before my Lord the Duke, told for certainty that there
were at the lest eight hundred men well armed and well appointed in the said
fort. Wherefore my Lord seeing it was then late, commanded the Lords de
Bacqueville, and l'Archant to get into the fort, and to find some means to
force it, with the Infanterie, and the Coluerin that he left them, and he went
to lie that night at Escouche, where he arrived about eleven a clock at night.
As soon as he was gone, these miserable rebels hearing how their companies
were overthrown, yielded their lives being saved only, and were by and by
disarmed, and afterward co^ducted to Escouche, where the duke soiourned all
the morrow to take a view of the prisoners which were in great number of al
qualities of persons. The same day the Lords of Hallot and Bacqueuille, du
Breuill, de Bellefontain and de l'Archa^t went abroad, to see if they could
meet with any ranging rebels, and missed not much to have taken the Baron of
Vernie, who having some number of Cuyrasses retired in great speed to
Argenten, with the County of Brissac, and the rest of his accomplices, which are
so discouraged, that they dare not appear in any place, where they hear of
our troops, who do nothing but go from place to place seeking out rebels to
fight with them, to make them acknowledge their fault. ^he morrow being
Saturday, the xxij. of the said Month, leaving the Lords of Harcourt, of
Saint Mary Venoix, and of Sassy at Escouche, we came to lie at Courcy. Where
having intelligence that Monsieur de Pierre court was lodged not far off with
some Lanciers, our troops mounted straight on horseback, and went to find
them out, but they mist of them, for they had dislodged, and we had tidings how
they made no great tarying: so that in all the plains ten leagues round about
this city, two rebels are not be found in the field together, they have been
hit on the hips so kindly these two sundry times. But the last overthrow was
far greater then I have set down. For that those which were defeated were
the flower of all their forces, were it of men at arms, or of capital caitifs
that persisted in their sinister meaning, and wicked rebellion against their
prince. From Courcy my Lord the Duke came directly to this City to bring
back his Artillery, and purposes within few days to be in the field again,
and to tarry by it, till he have by the grace of God reclamed all the baze
Normandy to the very gates of Roan into the obedience of his Majesty. Sir,
this is the true discourse of all that is past and done since the arrival of
my Lord the Duke de Montpencier in this Country, which is greatly bound and
beholding unto him: being most certain that if he had not come, this Country
had been in poor and miserable estate ere now: but God be thanked, the
amendment is now most certain. And every man may clearly see, that all
enterprises of rebels are like the y^e of one night, which melts away in the
morning: and so by consequence their malicious practices cannot long endure:
for their meaning being so sinister and perverse as it is, it is impossible
that it should stand long time to take effect: and we see daily the experience
thereof, and in this we must needs know and confess the goodness and mercy
of our God, who makes us verily to confess and acknowledge his greatness and
power, when it pleases him. For this poor country which by the subtlety and
craft of these wicked spirits, the leaguers has been so much divided within it
self, and the Inhabitants thereof so for the most part seduced, and bewitched,
that they knew not them selves, and by that means had clean forgotten their
true and natural duty toward his Majesty, now that they see by the coming
of my Lord the Duke of Mont-pencier, how their accomplices and adherents have
been handled, they will seek to reconcile themselves, so that I have good
hope that shortly the rebels force shall be very slender, albeit those of
their party have sowed so many false bruites, lies, and pure inventions of
their own heads, and do not stick to spread them abroad in all the Cities of
this Province: notwithstanding the greatest part of them, employing all the
friends they have to reclaim and reconcile themselves into the good favor and
obedience of his Majesty. So I beseech God, Sir, to grant you your hearts
desire. From Caen this 23. April. 1589.
