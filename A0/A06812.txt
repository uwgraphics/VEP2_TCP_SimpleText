Here begins a little treatise or book named Johan Mau^deuyll knight born
in England in the town of saint Albone and speaks of the ways of the holy
land toward Iherusalem / and of marueyles of Ynde and of other diverse
countries.
FOr as much as the land over the sea / that is to say the holy land that
men call the land of hetynge Among all other lands it is the most
worthyest land and souerayn of other lands / and it is blessed and hallowed
and sacred of the precious blood of our lor de Ihesu christ. In the which
land it l^ed him to take flesh and blood of the virgyne Ma^y / and to
enuyron that land with his own feet. And the re he would do many miracles /
and preche and teache the faith and the law of us christian men as unto his
childern. And therefore he would suffer many repro ues and scorns for us. And
he that was king of heaven / and of earth / of air / of see / and of all
things that are contained in them would all oonly be called king of that land
when he said. Rex su^ iudeorum. I am king of Jews. For that time was that
land of Jews / and that land had he chosen before all other lands as for
the best and the most virtuous and for the most worthyest of the world. And
as the phylosophre says thus. Virtus rerum in medio consistit. That is to say
/ virtue of things is in the mids / and in that land he would led his life
and suffer passion and death of the Jews for us and for to deliver and bye us
fro the pains of hell / and fro death withouten end / the which was ordained
to us for the sin of our fader Adam / and for our own sins also. For as
himself he had none evil deserved / for he thought never evil / ne did never
evil. And he that was king of glory and Joy might best in that place suffer
death. For he y^ will do any thing that he will be known open ly. He will do
cry it openly in the myddell place of a town / or of a cite / so that it may
be known to all parties of the cite. So he that was king of all the world
would suffer death for us at Jerusalem / that is in mids of the world / so yt
it might be known to men of all parties of ye world how dear he bought man
that he had made to his own likeness for the great love that he had to us /
for more worthyer catell ne might he have set for us than his own blessed body
and his own precious blood / ye which he suffered for us. A dear god what love
he had to his subgettts. When he yt had done no trespass would for trespassours
suffer death. By right ought men to love and worship and dread and serve such a
lord / and worship and praise such a holy land that brought forth such
fruit through the which every man ^s saved but if it be his ow ne defaute.
This is the land behyght to us in he ry age / and in that land would he deye
as cessed to leave it to his childern. For the which every good christian man yt
may and has whereof should strength him for to conquer our right heritage and
chase out the evil peoples hands / for we are called cry sten men of Christ
our fader. And if we be right childern of Christ we owe for to challenge the
heritage that our fader left us and do it out of strange men's hands. But now
pride / couetyse / and envy has so enfla^med the hertes of lords of ye worl
de that they are more besy for to dysheryte their neighbors than for to
challenge or conquer their right heritage before said. And the common people
that would put their bodies and catell for to conque re our heritage / they may
not do without lords / for assemblynge of the people without a chyef lord is
as a flock of sheep that has no sheepherde the which depart asondre / and
wot never wheder that they should go. But would god that the worldly lords
were at good accord / and with other of their common people would take this
holy vyage over the sea. I trow well that within a little time our right
heritage before said should be reconsyled and put in the hands of the right
eyres of Ihesu christ. And for as much it is long time that there was no
general passage over the sea / and many men desire to here speak of the holy
land / and have thereof great solace and comfort. John mau^deuyle knight.
Though it so be that I be not worcester thy yt was born in England in the town of
saint Albone and passed the sea in the year of the Incarnacyon of our lord
Ihesu christ. M. CCC. xxxij. on the day of saint Myghell and hyderwarde has
be long time over the sea and have seen and gone through many lands and many
prouynces and kingdoms and yles / and have passed through Turkey / through At
money the little and the great / through Tartary / thorugh Percy / through Syry /
through Araby / through Egypt the high and the low / through kyby / through Caldee
/ and a great part of Ethyope / through Ama zonie / through Ynde the less and
the more a great par te / and through many other yles which are about Ynde
where many diverse people dwelled of diverse laws and shappes / of (...) ^des
and yles I shall speak more pla^ I shall deuyse a par te of things what they
are when time shall be / after it may come to my mind / and special for them
that will and are in purpose for to vysyte the holy cite of Jerusalem and the
holy places that are there about / and I shall tell the way that they shall
hold thither / for I have many times passed and ryden it with good company /
and of many lords.

He that will go toward Jerusalem on horse or a foot or by the sea. Ca. pmu^.
IN the name of god almighty. He that will pass over the sea / he may go many
ways both on land and see after the countries yt he comes fro / and many of
them come all to one end / but trow not that I will tell all the towns and
cytees and castles that men shall go by / for than should I make to long tale
/ but all oonly some countries and most pryncypall cytees or towns that men
shall go through to go the right way. First if a man come from the west side of
the world as Englon de. Irlonde. Wales. Scotlonde. Norweye / he may go if he
will through Almayne / and through ye kingdom of Hungery yt marches to the land
of Poyal me and to the land of Pannony / and of Allesey. And the king of
Hungary is a right great lord and a mighty / and holds great and much land
/ for he holds the land of Hungery and of Allesey Coma me and a great part
of Bulgary that men call the land of Buggers / and a great part of the
kingdom of Rosse and that lasts to the land of Nyflon de and marches unto
Pruysse / and men go thus thorugh the land of Hungery through a cite that men
call Cypren / and beside the castle of Newburgh / and through the ylle town
that is toward the end of Hungery / and so over the river of Danowe / and
this is a full great river and goth in to Almayne under the hills of Lumbardy
/ and it takes in to him. xl. other ryuers / and it renneth through Hungery and
thorugh Greece and through Tartary and goth in to the sea so strongly and with so
great might that the water is fresshe. xl. mile within the sea / and afterward
go men to Belgraue and enter in to the land of Buggers and there pass men a
bridge of stone that is over the river Marroh / and men pass through the land
of Pynteras and come to Greece to the cite of Sterny and to the cite of
Affynpayn and so to the cy te of Constantynople that was sometime called^
Bessamorn and there dwelled commonly the Emperor of Greece.



To Constantynople is the best and the fairest church of the world / and it
is of saint Sophy. And before this church is an image of Iustynpan them perour
gylt / and it is upon an horse and crowned / and it was wont to hold a round
appell in his hand and men say there that it is a token that the Emperor
has lost a great part of his land / for the appell is fallen out of the
images hand and also yt he has lost a great part of his lordshyp. For he was
wont to be Emperor of Rome / of Greece / and of all Asyen the less / of Surry
and of the land of Jude in the which is Jerusalem / and of the land of Egypt
/ of Percy and Araby / but he has lost but Greece and the land that longed
thereto all only and men would many times put the appell in the images hand but
it would not hold it. This appell beto keneth the lordshyd yt he had over all
the world. And the other hand he holds lift up against the eest in token for
to manasse mysdoers / and this image stands upon a pyler of marble.



At Constantynople is the cross of our lord and his cote without seem the
spou^ge and the read of the which the Jews gave our lord drink galle on the
cross and there is one of the nails that Christ was nailed with to the
cross. Some men wene yt half of the cross of Christ be in Cypres in an abbey
of monks that men call the hylle of the holy cross / but it is not so / for
that cross y^ is in Cypres is the cross on the which Dysmas the good thee^
was hanged / but all men wot not that / and y^ is yll^ done / but for y^
getynge of the offrynges they say^ that it is the cross of our lord Ihesu
christ. And ye shall understand y^ the cross of our lord was made of four
manner of trees as it is contained i^ this verse. In cruce sit palma cedrus
cipressus oliua



For the pyece that went right up from the earth unto the heed was of cypres /
and the pyece that went overthwart to the which the hands were nailed was of
palm / and the stock y^ stood within the earth to the which they had made a
morteys was of ce dre / and the table above his heed that was a foot and a half
long on the which the title was written in Ebrewe / in Grew / and in Latin
that was of olyue And the Jews made the cross of these four manner of trees
for they trowed that our lord Ihesu christ should have hanged so long upon
the cross as long as the cross might last / and therefore made they the foot
of cedre / for cedre may not in the earth ne in water rotte / and they would it
should have last long / and for they trowed that the body of Christ should
have stonken / that pyece is made of cypre for it is well smelling / so that
the smelle of his body should not grieve to man that come forby. and that
overthwart was made of palm / for in the old testament it was ordained that
when any had the vyctory he was crowned with palm / and for they trowed that
they had the vyctory of Ihesu christ / therefore they made ye pyece yt went
ouerth wart of palm / and the table of the title they made of olyue / for
olyue betokens peace / as the story of Noe witnesses when the douue brought
the brau^che of olyue that betokens peace made between god and man. Also the
Jews trowed to have had peace when Christ was deed / for they said that he made
dyscorde and stryf among they^. And ye shall understand yt our lord was
nailed to the cross lyenge / and therefore he suffered the more pain. Also in
Greece and the christian men that dwell over ye see say that the tree of cross
yt we call cypres was of that tree yt Adam ete the appell and so find they
written / and they say as their scripture says that when Adam was syke he said
to his sone Seth y^ he should go to paradyse and pray the angel that keeps
paradyse that he would send him of the oil of the tree of mercy for to anoint
with his me^bres that he might have hele. And Seth went but the angel would him
not late come in at the door but said unto him that he might not have of the
oil of mercy / but he took to him four graynes of the same tree that his fader
ete the appell / and badde hy^ as soon as his fader was deed that he should
put this graynes under h^ tongue and grave him / and thereof should grow a tree
/ and when that tree bare fruit than should Adam be hole. And when Seth came
again he found his fader deed / and he did with the graynes as the angel
^adde him / of the which came four trees of the which was a cross made that
bare good fr^yte. That is to say our savior Ihesu christ / through whom Adam
and all that come of him where saved and delyucred from everlasting death but
if it be their own defaute. This holy cross the Jews hid under the earth
under the roche of mount Caluary / and it lay there two hundred year and more
unto the time that saint Eleyne found it / the which saint Eleyne was the
mother of Constaunce the Emperor of Rome / and she was daughter of king All
that was king of England that than was called the great Brytay ^e whom the
Emperor took to wife for her great beauty when he was in that country. And ye
shall understand that the cross of our lord was in the length. viij.
cubytes / and that overthwart had in length. iij. cubytes and an half.



A part of the crown of our lord ^hu wherewith he was crowned / and one of
the nails / and the spear heed / and many other relyques are in France to
Paris in the chapel of the king of France / and the crown lies in a vessel
of crystal well dyght and rychely / for a king of France bought these
relyques sometime of the Jews to whom the emperor had laid them to pledge for
a great sum of silver. And all if it be so that men say that this crown be
of thorns / ye shall understand that it was and is of Ionkes of the sea that
was white y^ prycketh as sharp as any thorns / for I have see^ and behold
many times that of Paris and that of Constantynople / for they were both of
one made of Ionkes of the sea / but men have departed them in two pyeces / the
which one part is at Paris / and that other part at Constantynople. And I
have one point thereof that seems a white thorn and that was given to me for a
great frendshyd / for there is many of them broken and fallen in the vessel
when they show the crown to great men or lords that come thither. And ye
shall understand de that our lord in that night that he was taken he was led
in to a gardeyne / and there he was examyned sharply / and there the Jews
scorned him and made him a crown of branches of albespyne that grew in the
same gardeyne / and set it on his heed so fast that the blood ran down by
many places of his vysage and his neck and his sholders / and therefore has
the albespyne many virtues / for he that bears a branch of it upon him / no
thonder / ne no manner tempest may de re him / ne none house that it is in may
none evil ghoost come in no place there it is. And in that sa me gardeyne
saint Peter denied our lord thryes. Afterward was our lord led before the
bishop and the mynystres of the law in an other gardeyne of Anne / and there
he was examyned also and scorned / and after again with a white thorn that
men call barbarens that grew in to the same gardeyne / and that has as many
virtues. And afterward he was led in to a gardey ne of Cayphas and he was
crowned again with Englentyre / and after he was led in to a chamber of
Pylatus and there he was examyned and crowned / and the Jews set him in a
chair and cladde him in a mantell / and than made they a crown of Ionkes of
the sea / and they kneled unto him saying. Aue rex iudeorum. That to say in
English. Heyle king of Jews. And the crown of the which that one half is
at Paris / and that other half at Constantynople the which Christ had upon his
heed when he was done on the cross and therefore men shall worship that most
and hold it more worthyer than any of the other. And that spear shaf^e has
the Emperor of Almayne / but the heed of iron which was put in his side is at
Paris. And many times says the Empe rour of Constantynople yt he has the
spear heed. And I have often seen it but it is gretter than y^ of Paris. Also
at Constantynople lies saint Anne our ladies mother whom saint Eleyne made bryn
ge from Jerusalem. And there lies also the body of saint John crysostom yt was
bishop of Constantynople. There lies also saint Luke eua^gelyst for his bones
were brought fro Bethany where he was graue^ and many other relykes are there.
and theris of the vessels of stone as it were merble the which men call
I^ryons that evermore dropped water and they fylle themself each year ones by
themself. And ye shall wete that Constantynople is a right fair cite and a
good and well walled / and it is three cornered / and there is an arm of the sea yt men call Hellespount / and some call it the bouche of Con stantynople
/ and some call it the brache of saint George / and thus this water encloseth
two parties of the cite / and upward to the sea upon the water was wont to be
the great cite of Troy in a full fair plain / but that Cite was destroyed
with them of Greece.

Of the Ylondes of Greece ca. ij.


ABout Greece ben mny yles that men call Calastre. Calcos. Certege. Tesbyria.
Minona. Faxton. Molo. Carpate / and Lempne. And in this isle is the mount Athos
that passes the clouds / and there is many speches and many countries that
are obeysau^t to the emperor of Constantynople / that is to say. Turcople.
Pyncy. Narde. Comange / and many other Tracy. and Macedonie of which Alexandr
was king. In this country was Arystotles borne in a cite yt men call Strages
a little fro the cite of Tracy / and at Strages is Ary stotles buried and upon
his tomb is made aij awter and there they make every year a great fest as he
were a great saint / and upon this awter the lords hold their great cou^seyls
and assembles / and they trow that through Inspyracyon of god and him yt they
shall have the better counsel. In this country are right high hills /
toward the end of Macedone is a great hylle that men call Olymphus yt depar
ted Macedone and Trachy / and it is high up to the clouds / and the other
hylle that men call Athos is so high that the shadow of him stretches unto
Olymphus yt is nere. lxxvij. mile between / and abo ue yt hylle is the air so
clear yt men may feel no wind there / and therefore may no best live there by
cause it is so dry. And men say in these countries that phylosophres sometime
went upon those hyl les and held to their noses a spou^ge moist with wa ter
for to have air / for the air was so dry. And above in the powder of the
hylle they wrote lettres with their fyngers / and at the years end they came
again and found those lettres which they had wry ten the year before without
any defaute / and therefore it seems well y^ those hills pass the clouds to
the pure air. And at Constantynople the Emperors palace is right fair and
well dyght / and therein is a fair palace for Iustynge / and it is made about
with stages yt each man may well se and none grieve other / and under these
stages are stables vouted for themperours horses / and all the pylers of these
stables are of marble. And within the church of say^e Sophy an Emperor would
have laid the body of his fader when he was deed / and as they made the grave
they found a body in the earth / and upon yt body lay a great plate of fine
gold / and thereupon was written in Ebrewe / in Grew and in latin lettres that
said thus. Jesus xp^s nascet de virgin maria ct ego credo in eu^. That is to
say. Ihesu christ shall be borne of the virgyne Mary and I believe in him And the
date was it was laid in earth two hundred year before our lord was borne /
and yet is that plate in the tresory of the church / and men say yt it was
Hermogenes the wise man. And all if it be so yt men of Greece be christian / yet
they varye from our faith / for they say that the holy ghost comes not out of
the sone / but all oonly of the fader / and they are not obeysau^t to the
church of Rome ne to the pope / and they say yt their patryarlres have as
much power over the sea as the pope has on this side the sea. And therefore
pope John the. xxij. sent lettres to they^ how christian faith should be all one
and that they should be obeysau^t to a pope that is Crystys vyher in earth to
whom god gaf plain power for to bind and to assoyle / and therefore they
should be obedyent to him. And they sent him diverse answers / and among other
they said thus. P^ tentia^ tua^ su^ma^ cir^a subiectos tuos firmiter credimus.
Supbia^ tua^ su^ma^ tollerare no^ possumus. Auaricia^ tua^ su^ma^ satiare no^
intendimus. Dn^s tecu^ sit. quia dn^s nobiscu^ est. vale. That is to say We
believe well thy power is great upon thy subgettes. We may not suffer thy pride.
We are not in purpose to fulfill thy couetyse. Lord be with the / for lord is
with us / fare well / and other answer might we not have of them. And also
they make their sacrament of the awter of therf bread / for our lord made it
of therf bread when he made his mau^de / and on therthursdaye make they their
bread in tokenynge of the mau^de and dry it at the son / and he^e it all the
year / and give it to syke men instead of gods body. And they make but one
vnccyon when they christian childern / and they anoynte no syke men / and they
say there is no purgatory / and souls shall have neither Joy ne pain unto
the day of dome. And they say that fornycacyon is no dedly sin / but a
kyndly thing / and that men and wy^men should wedde but ones / and who so wed
death more than ones their childern are bastardes and gotten in sin / and their
priests also are wedded / and they say that usury or symony is no dedly sin
/ and they selle benefyces of holy church / and so did men of other places /
and that is great sclau^der for now is symony king crowned in holy church god
may amend it when his will is. And they say that in lent men should not
sing mass but on the saterdaye and on the sunday / and they fast not the
saterdaye no time in the year / but if it be the Crystmasse and Eester even.
And they suffer no man that is on the side of the great see sing at their
awters / and if it fall that they do through any hap they wasshe their awters
as soon without tarye^* ge with holy water / and they say that there shold^
be but one mass said at one awter on a day. And they say also that our lord
ete never mete but h^ made token of etynge. And also they say that w^ sin
dedly in shauynge of our berdes / for the be^ de is token of a man and a yefte
of our lord / and they say that we sin in etynge of beestes that were
defended in the old testament and of the old law / as swyne / hares and
other bestes. And this they say also that we sin in etynge of flesh in the
days before asshe wednesdaye / and in etynge of flesh on the wednesdaye /
and when we ete chese or eggs on y^ frydaye / and they curse all those that
ete no flesh on the saterdaye. Also the Emperor of Constantynople makes the
patryarkes archebyssh^pes and bysshopes / and he gives all the dygnytees and
chirches / and depryueth them that are worthy. And all if it be so that these
things touch not the way / nevertheless they touch to that I have behyght
to show a part of the customs and manners and dyuersytees of countries / and
for this side the se^ the first country that is dyscordau^t in faith and
le^teth for our faith on this side the sea / therefore I have set it yt ye may
see and wete the dyuersyte yt is between our faith and theyrs / for many men
have great liking to here speak of strange things.

To come again to Constantynople for to go toward the holy land. ca. iij.


NOw come we again for to know the way fro Constantynople. He that will go
through Turkey he gooth toward the cite of Nyke and passes through the yate of
Chyuytot that is right high / and it is a mile and an half fro Nyke / and who
so will goo by the brache of Saint George and by the Greek see there as saint
Nycholas lies and other places / and first men come to the isle of Sylo / and
in that isle grows mastyke upon small trees as plomtrees or cherytrees. And
then after men go thorugh the isle of Pathmos where saint Johan the euangelyst
wrote the apocalypse / and I do you to wete when our lord Ihesu christ deyed
saint Johan theuangelyst was of the age of.xxxij. year / and he lived after the
passion of Christ.lxvij. year and than deyed. And fro Pathmos men go to Ephesym
a fair cite and nere to the sea and there deyed saint Johan and he was buried
behind the awter in a tomb / and there is a fair church for christian men
were wont to hold yt place / but in the tomb of saint Johan is no thing but
Manna / for his body was translated in to paradyse / and Turks hold now yt
cite and yt church and all Asye the less / and therefore is Asye the less
called Turkey / and ye shall understand yt Saint Johan did make his grave
there in his life / and laid himself therein all quycke / and therefore some sayen
that he deyed not / but he rests there to the day of dome / and therefore
sothely there is a great merueyle for men may see there apertly the earth of
the tomb many times stere and move as there were a quyck thing under. And
from Ephesym men go through many yles in the sea unto the cite of Pateran where
saint Nycolas was borne. and so to Marca where he by the grace of god bys shop
was chosen / and there grows right good wine and strong that men call wine
of Marca And fro thens men go to the isle of Crete which the^ Emperor gaf
sometime to Ionays. And than pass men through the yles of Cophos and Lango of
the which yles Ypocras was lord / and some say that in that isle of Lango is
Ypocras daughter in manner of a dragon that is an hundred foot long as men say
/ for I have not seen it / and they o^ the yles call her the lady of the
country / and she lies in an old castle and shows her thryes in the year
/ and she does no man no harm / and she is thus changed fro a damoysell to a
dragon through a goddess that men call Dyana / and men say that she shall
dwell so unto the time yt a knight come that is so hardy that dare go to her
and kiss her mouth / and than shall she torn again to her own kind and be
a woman / and after that she shall not live long. And it is not long sythen a
knight of Rodes yt was hardy and doughty said yt he would kysshe her / and when
the dragon began to lift up his heed again him and he saw it was so hydeous
he fled away / and the dragon in his anger bare the knight on a roche and of
that roche she cast him in to the sea and so he was lost.

Yet of the same dragon. ca. iiij.


ALso a young man that wist ^not of yt dragon went out of a ship and went
through the isle till that he came to a castle / and came in to the cave and
went so long till he found a chamber / and than he saw a damoysell yt kempt
her heed and looked in a myrrour / and she had much tresour about her / and he
trowed she had be a common woman that dwelled there to keep men / and he abode
y^ damoysel and the damoysell saw the shadow of him in the myrrour and she
turned toward him and asked him what he would / and he said he would be
paramoure or le^man. And she asked him if he were a knight and he said nay /
and she said than might he not be her le^man. But she badde him go again to
his felawes and make him knight and come again on the morrow and she should come
out of the cave and than he should kiss her on the mouth / and she badde him
have no dread / for she should do him no harm if all him thought she were
hydeous to see / she said it was done by enchau^tement / for she said yt she
was such as he saw her than / and she said yt if he kyssed he^ he should have
all yt tresour and be her lor de / and lord of those yles. And he departed fro
her and went to his felawes to the ship and made him knight and came again upon
the morrow for to kiss the damoysell. And when he saw her come out of the
(...) in form of a dragon he had so great dread ^ he fled to the ship / and
she followed him / and when she saw yt he turned not again / she began to (...)
as a thing yt had much sorrow / and turned again / and soon after the
knight deyed / and sythen hitherto might no knight se her but he deyed anon.
But when a knight comes yt is so hardy to kiss her he shall not deye / but he
shall torn that damoysell in to her right shappe / and he shall be lor de of
the country before said. And fro thens men come to the isle of Rodes / the
which the hospytalers hold and govern / and yt took they sometime fro the
Emperor / and it was wont to be called Colles and so yet the Turks call it
colles. And saint Pou le in his Epysteles writes to them of the isle of
Collooenses. This isle nere.C.lxxx. mile from Constantynople. And from this isle
of Rodes men go in to Cypres where are many vynes yt first are reed / and after
a year they wexe all white. and those vynes that are most white are most
clear and best smelling / and as men pass by this way by a place where was
wont to be a great cite that men call Sathalay / and all the country was
lost through folly of a young man / for he had a fair damoysell yt he loved well
/ and she deyed suddenly and was buried in a grave of marbell / and for the
great love yt he had to her he went on a night to her tomb and opened it and
went and lay by her / and when he had done he went his way / and when it came
to the end of. ix. months a voys came unto him and said in this ma ner wise
as in the next chapter following.

Of a young man and his lemman. ca. v.


^ Oo unto the tomb of that same woman that thou have lain by / and open it
and behol de ^ell that yt y^ have begoten on her / and if thou (...) ^or to go

flewe (...) heed right hydeous for (...) see / the which (...) all about the
(...) and the country / (...) after the Cy^ and the country sanke (...) and
there is many peryllous passages. Fro (...) to Cypies is nere five h^ndred mile
and (...) men may go to Cypres and come not at (...). Cypies is a good isle and
great and there are many good cytess and there is an archebysshopp at Nychosy
and four other bysshop^ in that land. And at Famagost is one of the best
haven on the sea that is in the world / and that are christian men and sa^asyns
and men of all nacyons. In Cypres is the hylle of the holy cross / and there
is an abbey of monks and there is the cross of the good thief Dysmas as I
have said before. And some wene that there is the half of the cross of our
lord / but it is not so and they do wrong yt make men to believe so. In Cypres
lies saint Gononon of whom men of y^ country make great solempnyte / and in
the castle of Amors lies the body of saint Hyllaryon / and ^en keep it full
worshypfully / and beside Fama^ost was saint Bernarde borne.

IN Cypres men hunte with the pampeons the are like to leopardes and they take
wild b^ tes right well and they are somewhat more than (...) ons / and they
take more sharply wild bestes the hou^des. In Cypres is a manner that lords
and oath men ete upon the earth / for they make dyches the earth all about the
halle deep to the knee / a^ they do paueye them and when they will ete they^
therein and sytte there / this they do to be more fres^ for that land is more
hoter than it is here. And great festes and for strange men they set forme^
bordes as men do in this country / but them w^ lever sytte in the earth. Fro
Cypres men go by (...) de to Jerusalem and by the sea / and in a day and (...)

it is to Acon. M. CCC. miles of Lombardy.

Of the hylle Carme. ca. ix.


ANd the isle of Greece is right in the mydwaye / and beside this cite of Acon
toward the sea at. vi. score forlonges on the right side toward the North
there is the hylle Carme where Elyas the prophet dwelled / and there was the
order of Carmes first founded. This hylle is not right great ne high / and at
the foot of this hylle was some time a good cite of christian men yt was called
Cayphas / for Cayphas founded it but it is now all wasted. And at the lift side
of the hylle is a town that men call Saffre / and that is set upon an other
hylle there was saint James and saint John borne / and in the worship of them
is there a fair chir ^he made. And for Tholomayda yt men now call Acon to a
great hylle that men call Ehale de Tyrreyes is an hundred forlonges / and
beside the cite of Acon renneth a little river yt men call Be lion / and there
nere is the fosse of Mymon all round that is an hundred cubytes or shaftmontes
breed / and it is all full of gravel clear shynynge / whereof men make white
glass and clear / and men come fro far countries by ship / and by land
with carts to take of that gravel / and if there be never so much taken
thereof on a day / on the morrow it is as full again as ever it was / and that
is great merueyll / and theris always wind in yt fosse that styreth always the
gravel and makes it trouble. And if a man put or do therein any metal / as
soon as it is therein as soon it waxes glass / and the glass yt is made of
this gravel if it be done again in to the gravel / it turned again to
gravel as it was before / and some say that it is a swalowe of the sea
gravel.

How Sampson slew the king and his enemies. ca. x.
ALso from Acon before said goo men three Iourneys to the cite of Phylystyen yt
now is called Gaza / that is to say rich cite / and it is ^ght fair and full
of follre and it is a little upon y^ see. And from that cite brought the
strong Samson the gates of the cite upon an high hylle where he was taken in
yt cite / and there he slew the king in his palace and many a thousand more
with him / for he made an house to fall on them. And fro thens shall men go
to the cite of Cesaryen and so to the castle of Pylleryns and then to
Ashalon and so forth to Japhath / and so unto the holy cy t^ Jerusalem.

The way to Babylon where as the Soudan dwellyth. ca. xi.


ANd who so will goo thorugh the land of Babylon where the Soudan dwells to
have leave to go more sykerly through the chirches and countries / and for to go
to mount Synay before he come to Jerusalem and than corn again by Ierlm he
shall go fro Gasa to the castle Dayr. And after a man comes out of Surry and
gooth in wylder nesse where the way is full sondy / and yt wilderness
lasts. viij. Iourneys where men find all that them needs of vytayles / and
men call that wylder nesse Archellek / and when a man comes out of this
deserte he ent^th in to Egypt / and they call Egypt Canopat / and in an other
langage men call it Mer syn^ / and the first good town that men find is call
led Beleth / and it is at the end of the kingdom of Alape. And fro thens men
come to Babylon and to Kayre / and in Babylon is a fair church of our lady
where she dwelled. vij. year, when she was out the land of Jews for dread of
king Herod. And there lies the body of saint Barbara virgyn / and there
dwelled Joseph when he was sold of his brethern / and there made Nabugodonosor
put three childern in fire / for they were of right truth / the which
childern men called Anania. Azaria. Mi^el. as the psalm of Benedicite says /
but Na^ugodonosor called them thus. Sydrac. Mysac. (...). that is to say. God
glorious / god vyc (...) us / god over all kyngdoms / and yt was for my^ that
he made gods sone / as he said go With (...) childern through the fire. There
dwelled the (...) dan / for theris a fair see in a strong castle and (...)
set upon a roche. In that castle is always dwelling to keep the castle and
to serve the Soudan more than. viij. thousand persons of folk yt take all
their necessaryes of the Soudans court I should well know it / for I dwelled
with him soudeour in his wars a great while again the Be^oyns / and he would
have wedded me to a gre ^e ^ynces daughter right rychely and I would ha (...)
forsaken my faith.

(...) of the Soudan. ca. xij.
ANd ye shall ^vnderstande that the Soudan is lord of. vi. kingdoms the
which he has conquered and gotten to him by strength / and this are they / the
kingdom of Canopate / the kingdom of Egypt / the kingdom of Jerusalem where
Dauyd and Salon were kings / the kingdom (...) Surry of the which the cite of
Damas was (...) chyef / the kingdom of Alape in the land of (...) meth / and
the kingdom of Araby which was to ne of the three kings yt made offrynge to
our de when he was borne / and many other lands holds in his hand / and
also he holds Calapl^ that is a great thing to the Soudan / yt is to (...)
among them Roys isle and this vale is full (...)



And than men go up on the mount of saint (...) ryne / and that is much higher
than the mount (...) (...). And there as saint Katheryne was graven is (...)
church ne chapel ne other dwelling place / (...) there is an hylle of stones
gedred together abou (...) the place there she was graven of angels / there was
wont to be a chapel but it is all cast dow^ / and yet lies there a great
part of the stones.



^ut under the foot of the mount of Synay is a monastery of monks and there is
the church of saint Katheryne wherein ben many lamps brennynge / ^ they have
oil olyue enough for to ete and te bre^ne ^ yt they have by miracle of god /
there com certain of all manner birds every year ones like pylgry^s ^ each of
them brings a brau^che of olyue in to (...) of offrynge whereof they make
much oil.

For to return fro Synay to Ierlm ca. xiij.
NOw sythen a man has vysyted this holy place of saint Katheryne / and he will
torn to Jerusalem / he shall first take leave at the monks and reco^mau^de him
specially to their prayers and those same monks give with a good will to
pylgryms vytayls to pass with through the wylde^ nes to Surry and that lasts
well. xiij. Iourneys And in yt wyldernes dwell many Arabyns tha men call
Bedoynes and Ascoperdes / these are for ^e yt are full of all manner of ylle
condycyons / (...) they have no houses but tents which they mak^ of bestes
shynnes as of camelles and other bestes the which they ete and there under lie
they / and the^ dwell in places where they may find water as on the reed see
/ for in that wyldernes is great de^ fault of water / and it falls often where
a man fyndeth water one time he fyndeth it not an other (...) me / and therefore
make they no houses in those cou^trecs. These men that I speak of till not the
land for they ete no bread / but if it be any yt dwelled nere a good town /
and they roast all their fysshes and flesh upon hot stones again the son /
and they are strong men and well fighting and they do no thing but chase
wild bestes for their sustenau^ce and they set not by their lives / therefore
they dread not the Soudan no^ no prince of all the world. And they have often
war with the Soudan / and that same time yt I was dwelling with him they
bare not but a shield and a spear for to defend they^ with / and they hold
none other armor / but they wind their hedes and their necks in a great
lynen clothe / and they are men of full ylle kind.

As men are passes this wilderness again comende to Jerusalem. ca. xiiij.
ANd when men are passed this wilderness toward Ier^m / they come to Barsabe
yt was sometime a fair and a liking town of christian men and yet is there some
of their chirches / and in that town dwelled Abraham the patryarke / this
town of Barsabe founded ^ryas wife of whom Dauyd engendered Solomon the wise yt
was king of Ier^m and of. xij. kinds of Israel / and he reigned. xl. year /
and fro thens go men to the vale of Ebron yt is fro thens nere. xij. mile / and
some call it the vale of Mambre / and also it is called the vale of Teres /
for as much as Adam in yt vale be wept an hundred year the death of his sone
Abell yt Caym slew. And Ebron was sometime the pryncypall cite of Phylystyens /
and there dwelled geau^tes and there it was so free yt all men that had do ill
in other places where there saved. In Ebron Iosue Calofe and their felawshyp
came first to aspye how they might wy^ne the land of promyssyon. In Ebron
Dauyd reg ned first. vij. year and an half / and in Ier^m he reigned xxxiij.
year and an half / and there are the graves of the patryarkes Adam. Abraham.
Jacob and their wives Eve. Sara. Rebecca. and they are in the hangyn ge of the
hylle / and under them is a right fair chit the kyrnelde after the facyon and
manner as it were a castle / the which church ye sarasyns keep right well /
and they have that place in great worship for the holy patryarkes that lies
there / and they suffer no christian men ne Jews to come in there but they have
special grace of the Soudan / for they hold christian men and Jews but as
hou^des yt should co me in no holy place / and they call the place spelunke or
double cave or double grave for one lies on an other / and the saralyns call
it in their langage Caryatharba / that is to say the place of patryarkes / and
the Jews call it Arboth / and in that same place was Abraham's house / and that
was the same Abraham the which sat in his door and saw three persons and
worshypped but one / as holy writ witnesses saying. Tres vidit et vnu^
adorauit. That is to say / he saw three and worshypped but one / and him took
Abraham in to his house.



Here follows a little of Adam and Eve and other things. ca. xv.
ANd right nere to that place is a cave in a roche where Adam and Eve dwelled
when they were driven out of Paradyse / and there gate they their childern. And
in that same place was Adam made as some men say / for men called some time
that place the field of Damasse / for it was in the lordshyp of Damasse / and
fro thens he was translated in to Paradyse as they say / And afterward he was
driven out of Paradyse and put there again / for the same day that he was put
in to Paradyse the same day he was dry uen out / for as soon he sinned. And
there begins the vale of Ebron that lasts nere to Jerusalem / and the
angel badde Adam that he should dwell with his wife / and there they engendered
Seth of the which kynred Ihesu christ was borne. And in that vale is the field
where men draw ou te of the earth a thing / the which thing men in that
country call Chambyll / and they ete that thing instede of spyce / and they
bear it to selle / and men may not grave there so deep ne so wide but it is at
the years end full again up to the sides through the grace of god / and two
mile from Ebron is the grave of Loath yt was Abraham's brodsr.

Of the dry tree. ca. xvi.


THan a little from Ebron is the mount of Mambre of the which mount the vale
to ke his name / and there is a free of oak that the sarasyns call dyrpe that
is of Abraham's time / that men call the dry tree / and they say that it has been from the beginning of the world and was sometime grene and bare leaves unto
the time that our lord deyed and so did all the trees in the world or else
they failed in their hertes*or else they faded / and yet is there many of
those in the world. And some prophecyes say that a lord or pryn ce of the
west side of the world shall win the land of promyssyon / that is the holy
land with the help of christian men / and he shall do sing a mass under the
dry tree / and than the tree shall wax grene and bear fruit and leaves / and
through that miracle many sarasyns and Jews shall be turned to the christian
faith / and therefore they do great worship thereto and keep it right besely.
And all if it be dry it bears a great virtue / for certaynely he that bears
a little thereof on him it heleth a sykenes called the falling evil and has
also many other virtues / and therefore it is holden right precious.

Fro Bethleem ca. xvii.
FRo Ebron men go to Bethleem on half a day / for it is but five mile and it
is a fay re way and thorugh woods full plesaunt. But Bethleem is but a little
Cite long and narowe and well walled and enclosed with a great dyche / and it
was wont for to be called Effrata as holy writ says. Ecce audiuimus eam in
effrata etc^. That is to say. Loo we herd him in Effrata / And toward the
end of the cite toward the eest is a right fair church and a gracyous / and
it has many toures and pynacles and kyrnelles full strongely made / and within
that church is. xliiii. great and fair pylers made of marble / and between
this church and the cite is the field Floridus / and it is called the field
florysshed as ye shall here.

Of a fair maiden that should be put to death wrongfully ca. xviii.


THe cause is / for as much as a fair maiden that was blamed with wrong yt
she had done fornycacyon / for the which cause she was demed to the death and
to be burnt in that place to the which she was led. And as the wood began
to brenne about her / she made her prayer to our lord as she was not gylty of
yt thing / that he would help her that it might be known to all men. And
when she had thus said she entered the fire / and anon the fire went out / and
those branches that were brennynge became reed roses / and those branches
that were not kyndled becam white rosers full of white roses / and those were
the first roses and rosers that any man saw / and thus was the maiden saved
through the grace of god. And therefore is that field called the field of god
florysshed / for it was full of roses. Also beside the quere of that church
aforsayd at the right side as men come downewarde.xij. grees is the place where
our lord was borne that is now full well dyght of marble and full rychely
depaynted of gold silver and asure and other colors. And a little thens by
three paces is the crybbe of the ox and the ass / and beside that is the place
where the sterre fell that led the three kings Jasper Melchior and Balthazar
/ but men of Greece call ye kings thus Galgalath. Saraphy. Galgalagh. These
three kings offered to our lord encense / gold / and myrre and they came
together thorugh miracle of god / for they met together in a cite yt men call
Chasak / that is.liij. Iourneys fro Bethleem / and there they were at Bethleem
the fourth day after they had seen the sterre. And under ye cloister of this
church.xviij. grees at the right side is a great pytte where the bones of the
Innocents lie / and before yt place where Christ was borne is the tomb of
Saint Ierom that was a priest and a cardynall that translated the Bible and the
Sawter fro Hebrewe in to latin / and beside yt church is a church of saint
Nycholas where our lady rested her when she was delivered of child / and for
as much as she had so mo che milk in her pappes yt gryued her she mylked it
out upon the reed stones or marble / so yt yet may the traces be seen white
upon ye stones. And ye shall understand that all that dwell in Bethleem are
christian men / and there are fair vynes all about the cite and great plente of
wine / for their book yt Machomet betoke them the which they call Alkaron /
and some call it massap / and some call it Harm forbyddeth them to drink
wine / for in yt book Machomet curses all those that drink of yt wine and
all that selle it / for some men say yt he ones slew a good hermyte in his
dronkenes which he loved much / and therefore he cursed the wine and they^
that drink wine / but his malyson is turned to himself as holy writ says.
Et in vertice^ ipsius iniquitas eius descendet. That is to say in English.
His wyckednes shall descend in his own heed. And also the sarasyns brings
forth no gry se ne they ete no swynes flesh / for they say it is brother to
man and that it was forboden in the old law. Also in the land of Palestyne
ne in the land of Egypt they ete but little v^ale and beef but it be so old
that it may no more traueyll ne work not yt it is forboden but they keep them
for tyllyn ge of their ^nde. Of this cite of Bethleem was king Dauyd borne /
and he had.lx. wives and.ccc. le^mans. Fro Bethleem to Jerusalem is two mile /
and in the way to Ierlm half a mile fro Bethleem is a church where the angel
said to the shepeherdes of the berynge of Christ / and in yt way is the tomb
of Rachell yt was Iosephys mother the patryarke and she deyed as soon as she
had borne Benyamyn and there she was buried / and Jacob her husbonde set.xij.
great stones upon her in tokenynge yt she had borne.xij. childern. In this way
to Jerusalem are many christian chirches by the which men go to Jerusalem.

Of the Cite of Jerusalem. ca.xix.
FOr to speak of Jerusalem ye shall understand that it stands fair among
hills and there is nouther river ne well but water comes by conduyte fro
Ebron / and ye shall wete that men called it first Iebus and sythen was is
called Salome unto the time of king Dauyd / and he set these two names samen
and called it Iebusalem / and than came Salon and called it Jerusalem and so it
is called yet. And about Jerusalem is the kingdom of Surrey / and thereby is
the land of Pa lestyne and Ascalon / but Jerusalem is in the land of Jude /
and it is called Iudee / for Judas Machab^us was king of that land / and also
it marches afterward on the kingdom of Araby / on the south side on the
land of Egypt* on the west side upon the great see / on the north side upon
the kingdom of Surrey and the sea of Cypres. In Ie rusalem was sometime a
patryarke / and archebysshops and bishops about in the country. About Irlm are
these cytees. Ebron at.vij. mile. Yeryco at.vi. mile. Barsabe at.viij. mile.
Ascalon at.xviij. Iaffe at.xxv. mile. Ramatha at.iij. mile / and Bethleem / and
toward the south is a church of saint Markertot that was abbot there for whom
they made much sorrow when he should deye / and yet is painted there how they
made dole when he deyed / and it is a pyteous thing to behold. This lon de of
Jerusalem has been in many diverse nacyons honds / as Jews. Cananeus.
Assyryens. Perce Medoynes. Massydones. Greeks. Romans and christian men.
Sarasyns. Barbaryns. Turks and many other nacyons. For Christ will that it be
lon ge in the hondes of traitors no sinners be they christian or other. And now
has the mystrowynge men holden that land in their hondes.lx. year and more /
but they shall not hold it long and if god will.

Ye^ of the holy cite of Jerusalem. ca.xx.
ANd ye shall wete that when men first co me to Jerusalem / they go first
pilgrimage to the church where that the holy grave is / that is out of the
cite on the north side / but it is now closed in with the wall of the town /
and there is a full fair church round all open above and well covered with
leed / and on the west side is a fair toure and a strong for belles / and in
the mids of the church is a tabernacle made like a little house in manner of
half a compass right well and rychely of gold and asure and other colors well
dyght / and on the right side is the sepulcre of our lord / and the tabernacle
is. viij. foot lon ge and. v. foot wy de and. xi. foot of heyght and it is not
long sythen the sepulcre was all open yt men might kiss it and touch it. but
for men yt came thy der payned they^ to break the stones in pyeces or powder /
therefore the Soudan has do make a wall le about the sepulcre that no man may
touch it / But on the lift side is no wyndowe but therein is many lamps light
/ and there is a lamp yt hangs before the sepulcre light brennynge and on
the frydaye it goth out by it self and lyghtneth again by it self at the hour
that our lord rose from death to life. Also within yt church upon the right
side is the mount Caluary where our lord was done on the cross and the cross
was set in a morteys in the roche that is white of color and a little reed
meddled with / and upon that roche dropped the blood of the wounds of our
lord when he was payned on the cross / and that is called Galgatha / and men
go up to that Galgatha upon greces / and in that morteys was Adams heed found
after Noes flood in token that the sins of Adam should be bought in the same
place / and above that roche made Abraham sa crefyce to our lord / and theris
an awter and before that awter lies Godfrey of Boleyne. Bawdewyne and other
that were christian and kings of Jerusalem. And there as our lord was done upon
the cross is this written in grew. Otheos / basylon / ysmon / presemas /
ergaste / sothyas / oys. That is to say in latin. Hic deus rex noster ante
secula operatus est salute^ in medio terre. That is to say. This god our king
before worlds has wrought hele in the mids of the earth. And also upon the
roche where the cross was fixed is written within the roche. Gros / guyst /
basys / thou / pestes / thoy / thesmoysy / is to say in latin. Quod vides est
fundamentu^ to cius mundi et huius fidei. And it is to say / that you see is
ground of all the world and of this faith / And ye shall understand that our
lord when he deyed was. xxxij. year old and three months / and the prophecy
of Dauyd says that he should have. xl. year when he says thus. Quadraginta
a^nis proxi mus fui generacioni huic. That is to say / forty year was I
neighbor to this kind / and thus should it seem that prophecy were not soth /
but it is. For in old time men called years of.x. months of the which
March was the first and December the last / But Gaius Cezar that was Emperor
of Rome did set to these two months Ianua ry and February and ordained the
year of.xij. months / that is to say.CCC. days without lepe ye re the
proper course of the son / and therefore after the accomptynge of.x. months
to the year he deyed in.xl. year / and after our years of.xij. months is
it.xxxij. year and three months. Also within mount Caluary at the right side
is an awter where the pyler lies yt our lord was bound to when he was
scourged and there beside are three other pylers yt always drop water / and
some say yt those pylers weep for our lords death / and nere this awter in a
place.xlij. grees deep was found the very Cross by assente of Saint Eleyne
under a roche where the Jews had hid it / and it was assayed for they found
three crosses / one of our lord and two of the two thieves. And saint Eleyne
assayed they^ on a deed body that rose as soon as the very cross of our lord
was laid on him. And there by in the vale is the place where the four nails
of our lord were hid / for he had two nails in his hondes / and two in his
feet / and one of those nails the Emperor of Constantynople did make a
brydell for his horse to bear him in battle / for the virtue that it had he
overcame his enmyes. And when all the lands of Asye Turkey Damasse the more and
the less. Surrey and Jerusalem. Araby / Percy / and Mesopotamy / the kingdom
of Alape Egypt the high and the low / and other kingdoms many full nygh all
unto Ethyope the low / and also unto Ynde the less that than was christian and
there was in that time many good men and holy hermytes / of whom the books of
the faders lives speaks / and they are now in paynynis and sarasyns hondes /
but when god will right as these lands are lost through sin of christian men /
so shall they be won again by christian men through the help of god. And in
the mids of this church is a com pas in the which Joseph of aromathy laid
the body of our lord when he had taken him of the cross / and upon the same
place did he wasshe the feet of our lord / and that compass men say it is in
the mids of the world.

Of the church of the holy sepulcre. ca. xxi.
IN that church of the sepulcre on the north side is the place where our lord
was done in prison in many places / and there is a part of the chain with the
which he was bound. And there he appyered first to Mary mawdeleyne when he
was risen fro death / and she trowed that he had been a gardyner. In the church
of the sepulcre was woned to be chanons of saint Benet / and they had a pryour
but the patryarke was their sovereign / and without the doors of the church at
the right side as men go up.xviij. degrees said our lord to his mother. Ecce
filius tuus. That is to say. Woman behold thy sone. Deinde dicit discipulo.
Ecce ma ter tua. That is to say / than said he to his dyscy ple. Behold thy
mother. And this word he said upon the cross / and upon these grees went our
lord when he bare the cross upon his sholder / and under these grees is a
chapel where priests sing / but not after our law / and always they make
their sacrament of the awter of breed saying Pater nf. and other prayers / as
with the which thing they say the words of whom the sacrament is made /
for they know not of addycyons yt many popes have made / but they sing in
good devotion. And there nere is the place where our lord rested him when he
was weary for berynge of the cross. And ye shall understand that before the
church of the sepulcre is the cite most weyke / for the great plain that is
between the cite and the church / on the eest side without the walls of the
cite is the vale of Iosaphat that comes to the walls.



In that vale of Iosaphat without the cite is the church of saint Stephen
where he was stoned to death / and there by is the gate gylted that may not be
opened. Through yt gate our lord entered on palm sunday upon an ass / and the
gate opened against him when he would go to the Temple / and yet are the
steps of the ass seen in three places the which stand in full hard stones.
Before the church of the sepulcre two hundred paces is a great hospy talle of
saint Johan / in the which hospytall be.liiij. pylers made of stone. And to go
toward the eest fro the hospytall is a right fair church that men call our
lady the great / and than is there an other church after that y^ men call our
lady of the latin / and there was Mary cleophe and Mary maw deleyne and drew
their here when our lord was done to death.

Templu^ dei. Of the Temple of god. ca. xxij.


And fro the church of the sepulcre toward the eest at. xviij. pa ces is
Templu^ dm^. That is a fair house and it is all round and right high and co
uered with leed. and it is well pauyed with white marble / but the Sarrasyns
will suffer no Lrysten men ne Jews to come therein / for they say y^ so foul
men should not come in to y^ holy place / but I came therein and in other places
where I would / for I had letters of the Soudan with his great Seal / and
commonly other men have but of his sygnet / and men bear his letter with his
seal before theyin hanging on a sper^ / and men do great worshypp thereto and
knele again it as ^e do again gods body / for those men y^ it is sent to /
before they take it they enclyne theyin first there to / and then they take it
and lay it upon their he des and afterward they kiss it / and than read it
all enclynynge with great worship / and than they profer them to do all that
the brynger will / and in this Templu^ dm^ were wont to be chanons regulers /
and they had an abbot to whom they were obedy ent / and in this Temple was
Charlemayn when the angel brought him the prepuys of our lord when he was
cyrcu^cysed / and after king Charles did bring it to Acon in to our ladies
chapel.

Yet of the Temple of god. ca.xxiij.
ANd ye shall understand y^ this is not the Temple that Solomon made for y^
Tem ple lasted but a thousand an hundred and two year. For Tytus Despasianus
sone y^ was Emperor of Rome that laid syege about Jerusalem for to dyscomfyte
y^ Jews for they had do Christ to death without ^eue of the Emperor / and when
he had ta ken the Cite he did brenne the Temple and cast it down / and took
all the Jews and put of them to death.xi.C.M. and the other he put in prison
and sold xxx. for a penny / for they said that they bought ^hu christ for. xxx.
pens. And sythen gaf Iulyan aposcata leave to the Jews to make the Temple of Ie
rusalem again for he hated christian men / and yet he was christian but he forsook
his law. And when y^ Jews had made the Temple than came an earth quaue as god
would and cast down all y^ they had made. Sythen Adryan the emperor y^ was of
them of Troy made Jerusalem again and the Temple in that same manner that
Solomon made it and would that no Jew should dwell there but all cry sten men
/ for if all it were so that he was not crystened he loved christian men more
than any other men / save men of his own faith. And this Emperor did enclose
and wall the church of the holy sepulcre within the cite y^ before was far
with out the cite / and he would have changed the name of Jerusalem and called
it Helyam / but y^ name lasted not long. And ye shall we^e yt the sarasyns do
gre te worship to that Temple / and they say yt place is ^ght holy / and when
they go there in they go bare foot and knele many times down. And when my
fellows and I came there in we did of our harneyse and came hare foot in to
the Temple and thought yt we should do as much or more than they that were
mystrowynge / and this Temple is three score and three cubytes of wydenesse and
as much of length and.xxxij. cubytes in the heyght / and covered with leed /
and it is within full of pylers of marble. And in mids of the Temple is a
stage of.xxiiij grees of heyght and good pylars all about. This place called
the Jews Sancta sanctorum. That is to say. Holy of holyes / and in that place
comes none but oonly their prelate that makes their sacre fyce / and the
people stands all about in diverse sta ges after they are of dygnyte and of
worship / and there be four entrynges to that Temple and the do res are of
cypres well dyght / and within the eest door our lord said here is Jerusalem.
And on the north side within the door is a fontayne but it renneth not / of the
which holy writ speaks and says thus ^idi aqua^ egrediente^ de templo.
That is to say. I saw water coming out fro the Temple. And upon the other
side is a roche yt men called sometime Moryach / but after was it called Belet
or the ark of god with the relykes of the Jews. This arc did Tytus carye
with him to Rome when he had dyscomfyted all the Jews. In that same ar ke were
the.x. commandments / and of Arons rod and of Moses rod with which he
departed with the reed see when the people of Israel passed thorugh on dry
foot / and with that rod he did many wondres / and there was a vessel of
gold full of Manna / and clothing and ornaments / and the taber nacle of
Aron / and a table square of gold with.xij. precious stones / and a box of
Iaspes grene with four fygures and. viij. names of our lord within / and.vij.
candelstyckes of gold / and four censers of gold / and an awter also of gold
/ and four lions of gold / upon the which they had Cherubyn of gold. xij.
span long / and a tabernade of gold / and also. xij. trompettes of silver /
and a table of silver / and. vij. barley loves / and all other relyhes that were
before the Natyuyte of Ihesu. Also upon this Roche slept Jacob when he saw
angels go up and dnwne and said. ^ere locus iste sanctus est et ego ig noraba^.
That is to say. Forsooth this place is holy and I wist it not. And there the
angel changed Jacobs name and called him Israel. And in that place saw
Dauyd the angel that slow the people with a sword and put it all blody in
the shethe / And in this roche was saint Symeon when he re ceyued our lord in
to the Temple / and on this roche he set him when the Jews would have
stonedr him / and the roche ryued in two and in that ryft he hid him / and a
sterre came done and gate him light And on this roche sat our lady and learned
her saw ter. And there forgave our lord the sins to the woman that was taken
and found in aduoutry / and there was our lord Ihesu christ cyrcu^cysed / and
there the angel denou^ced to Zacharye the Natyuyte of saint John baptyst / and
there offered first Melchysedech bread and wine and water to our lord in
tokenynge of the sacrament that was to come. And there fell Dauyd prayenge to
our lord for mercy for him and for his people when he saw the angel slay his
people / and our lord anon herd his prayer / and therefore would he make the
Temple in that place. But our lord Ihesu christ forbadde hy^ by an angel / for
he had done treason when he die de slay ^ryas a good knight for to have his wife.
And therefore all that he hadr ordained for to make the Temple he betoke it unto
Solomon his sone / and he made it and he prayed our lord that all those that
prayed in that place devoutly and with good heart that he would here that
prayer and grant that they asked ryghtwysly / and our losde grant it / and
therefore Salomons sone called it the Temple of counsel and help of god.
Without the doors of that Temple is an awter where Jews were wont to offer
dou^es and turtylles / and in y^ Temple was Zacharye slain / and on the
pynnacle the Jews set saint James on the earth that first was bishop of
Jerusalem / and a little fro this Temple on the right side is a church covered
with leed that is called the scole of Solomon. And toward the south is the
Temple Salon that is full fair and a great place / and in this place dwell
knights that are called Templers / and that was the founder thereof and of
their order / and in that Templu^ dm^ dwell chanons. Fro this Temple toward
the eest at. xxvi. paces in a corner of the cite is the bathe of our lord and
this bathe was won te to go to Paradyse / and beside is our ladies bed and
nere there is the tomb of saint Symeon / and without the cloister of the
Temple toward the north is a right fair church of saint Anne our ladies
mother / and there was our lady conceived / and before that church is a great
tree yt began to grow that same night. And as men go down fro that church.
xxij. grees lies Ioachym our ladies fader in a tomb of stone / and there nere
was laid some time saint Anne / but saint Elyne did trans late her in to
Constantynople. In this church is a well in manner of a cysterne that is
called Probatica pilcina / that had five entrynges / and in yt cyster ne was
wont an angel to descend and stere the wa ter / and what man that bathed him
first therein after the mouynge was made hoole that was syke what sykenes so
ever he had / and there was the man of the palsy made hole yt was syke.
xxxviij. year / and our lord said unto him in this manner wise. Toll grabatu^
tuu^ et ambula. That is to say in English / take thy bed and go. And there
beside was the house of Pylate / and a little thens was the house of king Herod
that did slay the Innocents.

Of king Herod. ca. xxiiij.
THis king Herod was a full wicked man and a fell / for he did first and
formest slay his wife which he loved full well / and for the great love that he
had to her when she was deed he beheld her and went out of his wit and so
was he lon ge time / and afterward he came again to himself And sythen he
did slay his own childern that he had gotten of yt wife / and after he made
slay the other his second wife and a sone that he had gotten of that same wife /
and after he did slay his own mother / and he would also have slain his own
brother. but his brother deyed suddenly / and thus he did all the ill that he
might. And than he fell syke / and when he ^awe that he should deye he sent
for his sister and all the great lords of that country / and when they were
there he did put all the lords in to a toure and said to his sister / he wist
well that the men of the country should make no sorrow for him when he were
deed / and therefore he made her for to swear unto him that she should do smite
of the hedes of his lords euerychone after his death / and than should men of
all the country make sorrow for his death / or else they would not sorrow /
and thus he made his testament. But his sister fulfilled it not as of that
thing that parteyned unto the lords / for as soon as he was deed she
delivered the lords out of the toure and sent euerychone home to their houses
and told them what her brother would she had done with them. And ye shall
understand that in yt time was three Herodes of great name. This of whom I
speak men called him Herod ascolonyte / and he that did smy te of saint John
baptyst heed was called Herod antypa / and the third was called Herod
agryppa and did slay saint James and put saint Peter in prison.

Of saint Saluatours church. ca. xxv.


ALytell within the cite is saint Saluatours church and therein is saint John
crysostoms arm / and the most part of saint Stephens heed. And on the other
side toward the south as men go to mount Syon is a fair church of saint
James where his heed was smyten of / and theris mount Syon / and there is a
fair church of god and of our lady where she was dwelling and deyed / and
there was sometime an abbey of chanons regulers / and fro that place she was
borne of the apostles unto the vale of Iosaphat. And there is the stone that
the angel bare to our lady fro mount Synay / and it is of that color that the
roche of saint Katheryne is of / and there beside is the gate where our lady
when she was with child went through to Bethleem. Also at the entering of
mount Syon is a cha pell and in that chapel is that stone great and large with
which the sepulcre was covered when Christ was laid therein / the which stone
the three Ma ryes saw turned upward when they came to the sepulcre / and there
they found an angel that said to them that Christ was risen fro death to life.
And there is a little pyece of the pyler to the which our lord was scourged /
and there was Annas house that was bishop of the Jews in that time. And in
that same place forsook Saint Peter our lord thryes before the cock crewe.
And there is a part of the table on the which god made his maunde with his
dyscyples / and yet is there the vessel with water out the which his dyscyples
feet were wasshen and thereby is saint Stephens grave / and theris y^ awter
where our lady herd the angels sing mass / and there appyered Christ first
to his dyscyples after his resurreccyon when the gates were sperde and said.
Pax vobis. That is for to say. Peace to you. And on that mount appyered Christ
to saint Thomas and badde him assaye his wound / and that was the.viij. day
after his resurreccyon / and than he byleued parfyghtly and said. Dominus meus
et deus meus. That is for to say in English. My lord and my god. In that
same chapel behind the high awter were all the apostles on Wytsondaye when
the holy ghoost descended on them in likeness of fire / and there made god
Paske with his dyscyples / and there slepte saint Johan the Euangelyst on our
lords breast / and saw slepynge many preuy things of heaven. And the mount
Syon is within the cite and it is a little higher than the other side of the
cite / and that cite is stronger on that one side than on the other for at the
foot of mount Syon is a fair castle and strong which the Soudan did do
make there / on mount Syon was king Dauyd buried and Solomon and many other
kings of Jerusalem And there is the place where Saint Peter wept full
tenderly when he had forsaken our lord / and a stone cast from that is an
other place where our lord was Iuged for that time was there Cayphas house.
Also between the Temple Solomon and mount Syon is the place where Christ raised
the maiden fro death to life. Under mount Syon toward the vale of Iosaphat is a
well that men call Natatorye sylo / there was our lord wasshen after that he
was baptized. And thereby is y^ tree on the which Judas hanged himself for
dyspayre when he had sold Christ. And there by is the Synagoge where the
bishops of Jews and the pharysees ca me to hold their counsel / and there
Judas cast the xxx. pens before them and said / peccaui trade^s san guine^
iustu^. That is to say. I have sinned deceyuynge ryghtwysse blood.

The field of Acheldemak which was bought with those.xxx. pens. ca. xxvi.
ON the other side of mount Syon toward the south a stone cast is the field
that was bought with* those.xxx. pens for which Christ was sold yt men call
Acheldemak / that is to say the field of blood / in yt field is many tombs of
christian men for there be many pylgryms graven. And also in Jerusalem toward
the west is a fair church where the tree grew of the which the cross was
made / and there nere is a fair church where our la die met* with Elyzabeth
when they were both with child / and saint John styred in his moders womb and
made worship to our lord his maker / and under the awter of the church is a
place where saint John was born / and thereby is the castle of Emaux.

Of the mount Joy. ca.xxvij.
TWo mile fro Jerusalem is the mount Joy that is a fair place and liking and
there lies Samuel the prophet in a fair tomb / and it is called mount Joy
for there many pylgryms see first Jerusalem. And in the myddell of the vale of
Iosaphat is a little river that is called Torrens cedron / and ouerth wart this
river lay a tree of the which the cross was made that men yode over. Also in
that vale is a church of our lady and there is the sepulcre of our lady / and
our lady was of age when she deyed.lxxij. year / and there nere is the place
where our lord forgave Saint Peter all his sins and misdeeds that he had
done. And beside that is a chapel where Judas kyssed our lord that men call
Getsemay and there he (...) (...) ken of the Jews / and there left Christ his
dyscyples before his passion when he went to pray and said Pater si fieri
potest transeat a me calix iste. That is for to say in English. Fader if it
may be done late this chalyce go from me. And also thereby is a chapel where
our lord swette both blood and water. And there is the tomb of king Iosaphat
of whom the vale had the name. And on the side of that vale is the mount of
Olyuete / and it is called so for there greweth many olyue trees there and it
is higher than Jerusalem / and therefore fro that hylle men may see in to the
streets of Jerusalem. And between that hylle and the cite is nothing but the
vale of Iosaphat and that is not full large / and upon that hylle stood our
lord when he went in to heaven / and yet seems there the step of his left
foot in the stone / and there is an abbey of black chanons that was sometime /
but now is there but a church. And but a little thens.xxviij. paces is a
chapel and there is the stone on the which our lord god sat on when he
preched and said thus. Beati pauperes spiritu quonia^ ipsorum est regnu^
celorum. That is for to say in English. Blessed be they that are poor in
spyryte / for theyrs is the kyngdo me of heaven / and there he taught his
dyscyples their Pater noster. There nere also is a church of that blessed
woman saint Mary Egypcyan and there is she buried. And upon the other side
toward the est three boweshottes fro thens stands Bethphage where our lord
Ihesu christ sent saint Peter and saint James for to fetch an ass on Palm
sunday.

Of the castle Bethania. ca.xxviij.
THere toward the eest is a castle that men call Bethania there dwelled
Symeon the loprouse yt herborowed our lord and them yt were baptized of our
lords dyscyples / and he was called Iulyan and was made bishop / and that is
he yt men call on for good herborowe. In yt same place our lord forgaf Mary
mawdeleyn her sins / and there she wesshe his fect with her teeres and dried with
her here and there was Lazar raised yt was four days deed.

Of Yeryco and other things. ca.xxix.
IN the retornynge of mount Olyuete is yt pla ce where our lord wept upon
Ierlm / and there by our lady appyered to saint Thomas after her assumpcyon and
gaf him her gyrdell. And thereby is the stone on which our lord sat often and
preched / and thereon he shall sytte yt day of dome as hy^self said And there
is mount Galyle where thapostles were gadred when Mary mawdleyn told they^ of
Cry ^is rysynge. between mount Olyuete and mount Galy (...) is a church where
the angel said to our lady when she should deye. Also fro Bethany to Yerico
is. v. mile. Yeryco was sometime a little cite / but it was wasted / and now is
it but a little town / that town took Iosue through miracle of god and
bidding of the angel and destroyed it and cursed all tho se yt builded it
again. Of that cite was Raah yt common woman that received messengers of
Israel and kept them fro many peryls of death and therefore she had a good
reward as holy writ says. Qm^ accepit propheta^ in noi^e meo mercede^ prohe
accipiet. That is to say. He that takes a prophet in my name / he shall take
mede of a prophet.

Of the holy places between Bethanye and flom Jordan and other things. ca.xxx.
Also from Bethanye men go to flom Jordan through wyldernes and it is nere a
days Journey between toward the eest unto a great hylle where our lord
fasted.xl. days / and upon this hylle was Christ brought of the fend of hell
and said to him thus. Dic vt lapides isti panes fiant. That is to say / that
these stones be made bread / and there is an hermytage where dwell a manner of
christian men that men call Georgyns / for Saint George converted them / and
upon yt hylle dwelled Abraham a great while. Also as men go to Yeryco in the
way sat many syke men cryenge. Jesus fili david miserere nobis. That is to
say. Ihesu Dauyds sone have mercy on us. Also two mile fro Yeryco is flom
Jordan / and ye shall wete the deed see departed the land of Ynde and of Araby
/ and the water of yt see is full bitter / and this water casts out a thing
that men call aspaltu^ as great pyeces as an horse / and Jerusalem is. CC.
furlonges from this see / and so it is called the deed see / for it renneth not
nor no man ne be that has life yt is therein may live and yt has been proved
many times / for they ha ue cast therein men yt are demed to death / ne no man
may drink of yt water / and men cast iron therein it comes up again / and if
a man cast a fether therein it gooth to the ground and that is against kind.
And there about grown trees that bear fruit of fair color and seem ripe /
but when a man breketh them or cut in them he fyndeth naught in them but
coals or ashes in tokenynge that thorugh the vengeance of god these cytess
were (...) te with the fire of hell. And some man call that lake the lake of
the Alphytedde / and some call it the flom of the devil / and some call it
the stynkynge flom for the water thereof stynketh. There sanken these five
cytees through the wreche of god. that is to say. Sodom. Gomor. Aldema. Solome
and Segor. For the sin of Sodom that reigned in them / but Segor thorugh the
prayer of ^oth was saved a great while / for it sat on an hylle / and yet
appyereth much thereof above the water / and men may see the walls in clear
weder And in this cite of Segor Loath dwells a great while and there he was
made dronken of his dough ^s and lay by them / they wend that god should
have destroyed all the world as he did with Noes flood. And therefore they
lay by their fader for men should be borne of them in to the world. And if
he had not be dronken he had not lain by them. And at the right side of this
see dwelled Loths wife a stone of salt for that she looked agay ^e when the cite
sanke down.

Of Abraham and his generacyon. ca. xxxi.
ANd ye shall understand that Loath was Arons sone Abraham's brother / and Sara
Abraham's wife was Loths sister / and Sara was. xc. year old when she gate Ysaac
/ and Abraham had an other sone named Ismaell that he had^ gotten on his maiden
Agar / and he was. xiiij. year of age when Ysaac was borne / and when Ysaac
was. viij. days old he was circu^cysed and therefore the Jews did circu^cyse
them at the age of. viij. days / and his other sone Ismaell was circu^cysed
that same day and was. xiiij. year of age / and therefore the Sa rasyns did
circu^cysetheym at. xiiij. year of age / and therefore the Jews that be of the
generacyon of Ysaac do circu^cyse them at the. viij. day of their age / and
the sarasyns that be of Ismaels genera cyon do circu^cyse them at their.
xiiij. year of age. And in to that deed se^ aforsayd renneth the flom Jordan
and makes there an end / and this is within a mile of saint Iohans church /
and a little beneden that same church westwarde were the christian men wont to
bathe them / and a mile thens is the river of Loath through which Jacob went
when he came fro Mesopotamyen.

Of the flom Iordane. ca. xxxij.
THis flom Jordan is no great River nor d^ pe but there is much good fysshe
therein / and it comes from mount Lybany fro two wells tha^ men call Ior and
Dane / and of them it takes the name / and upon the one side of that river is
mou^^ Gelboe and there is a fair plain. And on yt other

hylle of Effraym where Anna Samuels mother the prophet dwelled / and there was
the prophet borne / and after his death he was buried at mount Joy as I have
said. And after come men to Sybola where the Ark of god was kept under Hely
the prophet. And there made the people of Israel their sacrefyce unto our
lord. Also there spa ke our lord first unto Samuel. And there mynystred god
the sacrament. Also there nere at the lift side is Gabaon and Rama Benyamyn of
the which holy writ speaks. After that come men to Sychem that some men
call Sycar / and this is in the prouynce of Samarytanes / and some time was
there a church but it was all casted down / and it is now a fair vale and
that full plenteuous / and there is a good cite in that vale that men call
Neople / and so froms thens it is a days Journey unto Jerusalem / and there is
the well where our lord spoke to the woman Samarytane / and Sychem is.x. mile
fro Jerusalem and it is called Neople / that is to say the new town. And
there nere is the Temple Joseph Ia cobs sone that governed Egypt. Fro thens
were his bones brought and laid in that Temple / and thither came Jews often
in pilgrimage with gre te devotion. Also in that cite was Jacobs dough ter
Dyana rauysshed for whom her brothers slew many me^. and thereby is the cite of
Garysym where the Samarytanes make their sacrefyce.



On this hylle would Abraham have sacrefyed his sone Ysaac / and there nere is
the vale of Dotayn and there is y^ cesterne where Io seph was cast in of his
brethren before yt they sold him / and it is two mile to Sychar / and fro
thens men come to Sa mary yt men call Sebasten / and y^ is the chyef cite of
that country / and in that cite was the sete of the.xij. kinds of Israel /
but it is not so great as it was / and there was saint John baptyst buried
between two prophets Helyzeus and Abdon / but he was byheded in the castle of
Makaryn beside the deed see and he was translated of his dyscyples and buried
at Samary / but there did Julius apostata take his bones and burnt them /
for he was yt time Emperor / but the finger with the which he showed our
lord saying. Ecce agnus dei. That is to say Behold the lombe of god / and
that finger might (...) (...) (...) (...) ^ecla the virgyn did bryn and Hely
the prophets. And therefore (...) say* Peter. Bonu^ est nos hic esse. faciamus
tria tabernacula etc. That is to say. It is good to us to be here / make we
three tabernacles. And our lord Ihe su christ badde them that they should say
it to no man unto the time yt he was risen from death to life And upon the same
hylle shall four angels sown their trompettes and reyse all men yt are deed
to life / and than shall they come in body and soul to the Judgment / but the
Judgment shall be in the vale of Iosaphat on Eesterdaye at the same time as our
lord rose from death to life. And also a mile fro mount Tabor is mount Hermon /
and there was y^ cite of Namy / before the yates of yt cite our lord raised
the wydowes sone yt had no more children.

Of the sea of Galyle. ca. xxxvij.
ANd from thens men go to a cite that men call Tyberyen yt sytteth on the sea
of Ga lyle / and all if it be called the sea of Galyle it is no see ne arm of
the sea / for it is but a staumble of fresshe water / and it is more than an
hundred furlon ges long and.xl. brood / and therein is many good fysshes. And
on the same see stands many good cytees therefore this see changed often his
name af ter the cytees that stand thereupon but it is all (...) water or see /
and upon this see yode our lord dry^ foot / and there said he to Peter when he
came on the water and was nere drowned. Modice fidei quare du bitasti. That is
to say. Thou of little believe why had thou doubt.

Of the table there Christ ete upon after his up rysynge fro death to life. ca.
xxxviij.
IN this cite of Tyberyen is the table yt Cry ste ete of with his dyscyples
after his refurreccyon / and they knew him in brekynge of bread as holy writ
says. Et cognoueru^t eu^ in fractione panis. That is to say. The knew him in
brekynge of bread. And about the hylle of Tyberyen is the Cite where our lord
fed five thousand people with five barley leaves and two fysshes.



And in the same cite did men cast in anger a fie-

not be burnt / and saint Tecla the virgyn did bring these finger under the
Alphen y^ ben mou^tayns where they do it great worship / and she did saint
John baptyst heed closed in a wall / but the emperor Theodosyan did take it
out and found it lapped in a cloth all blody and bare it to Co^stantynople and
theris yet the one half of the heed / and the other is at Rome in saint
Syluesters church / and the vessel wherein his heed was laid when it was
smyten of is at G^ene and they do it great worship. Some say that saint Iohans
heed is at Amyens in Pycardy / and some say it is Saint Iohans heed the
bishop. I wot not but god wot it.

Of the Samarytanes. ca. xxxiiij.


FRom Sebasten to Jerusalem is. xij. mile / and between the hills of this
country is a well yt men call Fons Jacob / that it to say Jacobs well yt
changed four times in the year his co lour / for sometime it is reed / sometime
clear / somty me grene / and sometime thycke / and men yt dwell there are
called Samarytanes and were converted through the apostles / and their law
varyeth from christian la we and sarasyns law also and fro Jews and paynyms /
they believe well in one god yt all shall deem / and believe the Bible after the
letter / and they lap their hedes in reed lynen clothe for dyfference of
other / for sarasyns lap their hedes in white clothe / and christian men yt
dwell there in blewe cloth / and Jews in yelowe / and in this country
dwellen many Jews payenge trybute as christian men done. And if they will wete
the lettres of the Jews they are such / and the names of their lettres as
they call they^. Alpha for a. beth for b. gimel c. he d. van e. zay f. ex g.

Of Galyle. ca. xxxv.
FRo this country yt I have spoken of men go to the plain of Galyle and leave
the hills at the one side / and Galyle is of the prouynce of ye land of
promyssyon / and in that prouynce is the land of Naym and Capharnay^ and
Corosaym / and at Bethsayda was saint Peter and saint Andrewe born / of
Corosaym shall Antecryst be born / and as some say he shall be borne in
Babylon / therefore says the prophet. De babilonia coluber exiet q^ totu^
mu^du^ deuorabit. That is to say. Of Babylon shall come a serpent yt shall
devour all the world. And this Antecryst shall be nourysshed in Bethsayda and
shall regne in Corosaym / therefore says holy wryt thus. Ve tibi corosaym. Ve
tibi Bethsayda. That is to say. Woe be to ye Corosaym. Woe be to y^ Beth sayda /
and the Chan of Galyle is four mile from Nazareth / of yt cite was the womas of
Chanane^ of whom the gospel speaks / and there our lord die de the first
miracle at ye wedding at the Archetryclyne when he converted water in to wine.
And fro thens mey go unto Nazareth yt was sometime a great cite / but now is
there but a little town and it is not walled / and there was our lady born /
the na me took our lord of this Cite / but our lady was gotten at Jerusalem. At
Nazareth took Joseph our lady to wife when she was of. xiiij. year of age and
there the amgell salued her saying. Aue gracia plena dn^s tecu^. That is to
say. Heyle full of gra ce the lord be with the / and there was sometime a great
church / and now is there but a little closes to recey ue the offrynges of
pylgryms / and there is the well of Gabryell where our lord was wont to
bathe him in when he was little / at Nazareth was our lord nourysshed / and
Nazareth is to say / flower of gardeyne / and it may well be called so / for
there was nourysshed the flower of life yt was our lord Ihesu christ. At half a
mile from Nazareth is the blood of our lord / for the Jews led him upon an
high roche to cast hy^ down and slay hym*but Ihesu christ passed through them
and lept on a roche where his steps are yet seen / and therefore say some
when they dread them of thieves or else of enemies / they say thus. Jesus
aute^ transiens per medium illorum ibat. And they say also these verses of the
sawter three times. Irruat super eos formido et pauor in magnitudine brachij
tui. Dn^e fiant i^mobiles qua si lapis donec pertranseat ppl's tuus dn^e et
ppl's iste que^ redemisti. And so when all this is said a man may go without
any lettynge. Also ye shall understand and know yt our blessed lady bare
child when she was. xv. year of age / and she lived with him. xxxij. year and
three months / and after his passion she lived. xxij. year.

The way of Nazareth to the mount or hylle of Tabor. ca. xxxvi.
ANd from Nazareth to mount Tabor is three mile / and there our lord
transfygured him before saint Peter saint John and saint James and there they
saw ghoostly our lord and Moses

ryens and they holden half our faith and half the faith of the Greeks and they
have long berdes as the Greeks have.



And there be other yt me^ call Georgyens whom saint George converted / and
they do more worship to halowes of heaven than other do / and they have their
crowns shaven / the clerks have round crow nes and the lewd have crowns
square / and they hold the Greeks law. And there be other yt men call
christian of gyrdynge / for as much as they were gyr dels underneath / some other
call Nestorynes / some Aryens / some Nubyens / some Gregours / and some Indens
that are of the land of preter Johan / and euerychone of those have some
artycles of our believe. But each of them varye from other*and of their
varyau^ce were to much for to tell.

For to torn again on this side Galyle. ca. xl.
NOw sythen I have told (...) of many ma ners of men that (...) (...) (...)
(...) (...) said. Now will I torn (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) ne upon
this side / no^ (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) de of Galyle y^ I spa^
(...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) shall go through Dam^ (...) (...) (...)
(...) (...) (...) good marchaundy se^ (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) the sea / and five (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) carry marchau^dyses upon
(...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) and dromedaryes and (...) (...) (...) (...)
(...) Thi^ cite of Damas founded (...) (...) that ^as ^hams servant before
Ysaac (...) (...) and he thought to have been (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) he
called that cite after his (...) (...).



And in that place slow Caym his brother Abell / and beside Damas is the mount
of Syry / and in that cite is many a physycyen / and that holy man saint Poule
was a physycyen to save men's bodies in hele before that he was converted /
and after he was a physycyen of souls. And fro Damas men come by a place
called our lady of Sardemarche that is five mile from Damas and it is on a
roche / and there is a fair church and there dwell monks and nonnes christian
/ in the church behind the high awter is a table of tree on the which the
image of our lady was depaynted that many times was turned in to flesh / but
the image is now seen but a little / but evermore through grace of god the table
droppeth oil as it were an olyue / and there is a vessel of marble under the
table to receive the oil / thereof they give to pylgryms for it heleth many
sykenesses / and he that keeps it clenly a year / after the year it turned in
to flesh and blood. Between the cite of Dark and the cite of Raphane is a
river that men call Sabatory for on the saterdaye it renneth fast and all the
weke else it stands still and renned not or little. And there is an other
river that on the night freseth fast and upon the day no frost is seen And so
men go by a cite that men call Berugh / and there men go in to the sea that
will go in to Cy pres and they arryue at port of Sur or of Thyrry / and than go
men to Cypres / or else men go or may go from the port of Thyrry right and
come not at Cypres and arryue at some haven of Greece / and than come men in to
those countries by ways that I have spoken of before.

How a man may go ferthest and lengest in those countries as herafter ben
rehearsed. ca. xli.
NOw have I told you of ways by the whi che men go ferthest and lengest as by
Babylon and mount Synay and other places many / through the which lands men
torn again to the land of promyssyon. Now will I tell you the way of
Jerusalem / for some men will not pass it / some for they have not to spend /
some for they have no company / and many other causes reasonable / and therefore
I shall tell you shortly how a man may goo with little cost and short time. A
man that comes fro the lands of the west he gooth through France Burgoyne /
and Lumbardy / and to Venys or to Geene or some other haven of those marches /
and take there a ship and go to the isle of Gryff / and so arrived he in Greece
/ or else at port Myroche / or Valon / or Duras / or some other haven of those
marches / and go to land for to rest him / and gooth again to to the sea and
arryueth in Cypres / and comes not in the isle of Rodes / and arryueth at
Famagost that is the chyef haven of Cypres / or else at Lamaton / and than
enter ship again and pass beside the ha uen of Tire and come not to land /
and so passes he by all the havens of that cost unto he come to Iaffe that is
the next haven to Jerusalem* for it is. xxviii. mile between. And fro Iaffe men
goo to the cite of Ramos and that is but little thens and it is a fair cite /
and beside Ramos is a fair church of our lady where our lord showed him unto
her in the shadows that betokens the Trynyte And there nere is a church of
saint George where his heed was smyten of. And than to the castle of Emaux /
and than unto mount Joy / and fro thens pylgryms see Jerusalem / and than to
mount Modyn and than go to Jerusalem. At mount Modyn lies the prophet Machabe
/ and over Ramatha is the town of Donke whereof Amos the prophet was

Yet of other ways for to go by land unto Ie rusalem. ca. xlii.
FOr as much as many men may not suffer the savor of the sea / but is lever
to go by land if all it be more pain. A man shall go to one of the havens of
Lombardy as Venys or an other / and he shall pass into Greece to port Myroche
or an other and shall go to Constantynople / and shall pass the water that is
called the brache of Saint George yt is an arm of the sea. And from thens he
shall come to Puluerall / and than to the castle of Synople. And fro thens
shall he go unto Capadoce that is a great country wherein is many great hills
/ and he shall go through Turkey and to the cite of Nyke the which they wanne
fro the emperor of Constantynople / and it is a fair cite and well walled / and
there is a river that men call the Lay. and there go men by the alps of
Mormant / and thorugh the vales of Malebrynys and the vale of Ernax / and so to
Anthyoche the better yt sytteth on the river Ryclay / and there about is many
good hills and fair / and many fair woods and wild bestes / And he yt will
go an other way he gooth by the plain of Romayn cost and the Romayn see / on
that cost is a fair castle that men call Florage. And when a man is out of
the hills he passes through the cite of Moryach and Artoyse where is a great
bridge upon the River of Fern that men call Fassar / and it is a great river
berynge ships. And beside the cite of Damas is a River that comes fro the
mount of Lybany and that men call Alban / at the passing of this river saint
Eustache lost his two sons when he had lost his wife / and it goth through the
plain of Archades and so to the reed see and than goo men to the cite of
Fermyne and so to the cite of Fern. And than to Antyoche and yt is a fair cite
and well walled / for it is two mile long / and theris a bridge over the river
yt has at each pyler a good toure and is the best cite of the kingdom of
Surry. Fro Antyoche men go to the cite of Locuth / and so to Geble / and to
Tortouse / and thereby is the land of Cambre and a strong castle yt men call
Manbek. And fro Tortouse men go to Trypelle on the sea / and upon the sea men
go to Dacres / and there is two ways to Jerusalem / on y^ lift way men go
first unto Damas by flom Jordan / on the right side men go through the land of
Flagme and so to the cite of Cayphas of which Cayphas was lord / and some
call it the castle Pelleryns * and from thens it is four days Journey to
Jerusalem / and they go through Cesary Phylypp and Iaffe and Ra mas and Emaux /
and so to Jerusalem.

Yet an other way by land toward the land of promyssyon. ca. xliij.
NOw have I told you some ways by land and by water how men may go to
Jerusalem. And if it be so yt there be many other ways that men go by after
the countrees that they come fro / nevertheless they torn all to one end. Yet
is there a way all by land to Jerusalem and pass no see from France or
Flau^dres / but that way is full long and a perylous and of great travail /
and therefore few go that way / he that shall go that way he gooth through
Almayne and Pruysse and so unto Tartary. This Tartary is holden of the great
Cane of whom I shall speak afterward / for thither lasts his lordshyp. And
all y^ lords of Tartary yield him trybute. Tartary is a full evil land and
sondy and little fruit berynge / for there grows but little corn or wine or
fruit / but bestes are there great plente / and therefore ete they but flesh
without bread / and they soupe the brotth and they drink milk of all manner of
beestes. They ete cattes and all manner wild bestes / rattons and myce / and
they have little wood / and therefore they dyght their mete with horse dou^ge and
other beestes when it is dry. Princes and other lords ete but ones on the
day and right little / and they be right foul folk and of evil kind / and
in somer there is many tempests and thondres that sleeth many men and beestes
and right suddenly / and it is there right cold / and as suddenly it is right
hot. The prince yt governs that land they call him Raco and dwell leth at a
cite that men call Orda / and forsooth there will no good man dwell in that
land / for it is good to sow in thorns and wedes / and other good is there
none as I herd say / for I was not that way / but I have been in other lands
marchynge thereon as the land of Rossye and Nyflonde and the kingdom of Grecon
and Lectowe / and the kyngdo me of Grasten and many other places / but I went
never that way to Jerusalem / and therefore I may not well tell it / for I
have understand that men may not well go that way but in winter / for waters
and marrays that are there yt men may not pas se are than hard froren and full
of snow above / for were not the snow there might no man ^o. And ye shall
understand yt a man shall go three Iour^ may assaye them well in this manner /
first cu^e with them in diverse precious stones as saphyrs or other upon
crystal / and than men take a stone y^ is called adamande / lay a nedell
before that adamande and if the dyamande be good and virtuous the adamande
draws not the nedell to him whiles the dyamande is there. And this is the
prove that they make beyond the sea. But it falls sometime that the good
dyamande loses his virtue thorugh him that bears it / and therefore it is
needful for to make it to recover his virtue again or else it is little of
value.

Of diverse kingdoms and yles of the land of Ynde. ca. liij.


MAny dyuer^ countries and kingdoms are in ynde / and it is called Ynde of a
river yt renneth through and is called ynde also* and there is ma ny other
precious stones in that river ynde. And in that river men find eles of.xxx.
foot long / and men that dwell nere that river are of evil color and yelowe
and grene. In ynde is more than five thousand yles yt men dwell in good and
great beside those that men dwell not in / and in each one of those is great
plente of cytees and much people / for men of Ynde are of yt condycyon yt they
pass not out of their land commonly / for they dwell under a planet that is
called Saturn / and that planet ma keth his course by the.xij. signs in.xx.
year and the moon passes through the.xij. signs in a month and for that
Saturn is of so late sterynge / therefore men that dwell under him and in yt
clymate have no good will to be much sterynge about. And in ^ur country is it
contrary / for we are in a clymate that is of the moon and of light sterynge
and that is the planet of way / and therefore it gives us will to much
mouynge and sterynge and to go in to diverse countries of the world / for it
gooth about the world more lightly than an other planet does / Also men pass
through Ynde by many countries unto the great see Occean. And than they fynd^
the isle of Hermes where merchants of (...) and of Geene and of other diverse
parties o^ cr^endome come for to bye their marchaundys^*

there was one in that country that meddled with sorcery that men called
Takyna yt with enchau^te mentes could make him like an angel / and he wen ^e
often and lay with maidens / and therefore was Mary the more aferde for the
angel and thought in her mind that it had be Takyna yt went with ^he maidens
/ and she coniured him yt he should say unto her if he was that same Takyna /
and the angel badde her have no dread for he was certain a messenger of Ihesu
christ. Also their book of Al ^aron says yt she had child under a palm tree
and than was she gretely ashamed and said yt she would ^e dedd / and as soon
her child spoke and conforted her and said to Mary. Ne timeas maria. That is
^o say. Be not adred Mary. And in many other places says their book Alharon
that Ihesu christ spoke as soon as he was borne / and the book says that Ihesu
christ was sent fro god almighty to ^e ensample to all men / and that god
shall deem all ^en / the good to heaven and wicked to hell / and yt Ihu ^yst is
the best prophet of all other and next to god ^ that he was very prophet that
gave the blind ^ght and ^eled meselles / and raised deed men and went ^
quycke to heaven / and if they may find a book ^ith gospelles and namely Missus
est angelus / they ^o it great worship / they fast a month in the year they
ete not but on the night / and than they keep ^eym fro their wives / but they
that are syke are ^ot constrained to that. And that book Alharon speaks of
Jews and says they are wicked people^ for they will not believe that Ihesu
christ is of god And they say yt the Jews lie on our lady and her sone Ihesu
christ saying yt they did him not o^ the cross / and for sarasyns believe so
nere our faith and they are lightly converted when men preche the law of Ihesu
christ / and they say they wot well b^ their prophecyes yt their law of
Machomet shall fail as does the law of Jews / and that cryst^ men's law
shall last unto the worlds end. An^ if a man ask them wherein they believe /
and the^ say yt they believe in god almighty the which ^ maker of heaven and of
earth and other things ^ without him is no thing done / and the day of do^
me when every man shall be rewarded after h^ deseruynge / and yt all thing is
soth that Christ say^ through the mouths of his prophets.

Yet of Machomet. ca. xl^
ALso Machomet badde in his book Al^ ron that every man should have two w^ ues
or three or four / but now take they. ix. and ^ many le^mans them lyked / and
if any of their ^ ues do amys again their husbondes*he may d^ ue her out of
his house and take an other / but he m^ give her a part of his goods. Also
where m^ speak of the fader and sone and holy ghoost / they sa^ that they are
three persons and not one god / for the^ ^he Alkaron speaks not thereof ne of
the Try^te* but they say that god spoke or else was he ^be / and god has a
ghoost or else were he not a ^e / and they say yt gods word has great
streng^ and so says their Alkaron / and they say yt Abra^n and Moses were
well with god for they spoke ^th him / and Machomet was right messenger of ^ /
and they have many good artycles of our faith ^d some understand the
scryptures and prophecyes ^ they have them / and the gospels and the Bible is
^yten in their langage / and so wot they well of ho ^ryte / but they
understand it not but after the ^ter and so do the Jews / for they
understand not ^e letter ghoostly / and therefore says saint Poule. ^ttera
occidit spiritus aute^ viuificabit. That is say. Letter sleeth / and ghost
makes quycke. And ^e Sarasyns say that the Jews are wicked for ^ey keep not
the law of Moses the which he to ^ to them. And also christian men are ylle
for they ^pe not the commandments of the gospelles that ^esu christ sent
unto them. And therefore I shall ^le you what the Soundan told me upon a day
his chamber / he did void out all manner of ^en / lords / knights / and
other for he would speak ^th me in counsel / and he asked me how christian ^en
governed them in our country / and I said ^ght well thanked be god / and he
said sykerly ^ay / for he said that our priests made no force of ^ddes service
/ for they should give good eusample to men to do well and they give ylle
ensample and therefore when the people should go on the ho^ days unto the
church to serve god / they go to ^ uerne to be in glotony all the day and the
night / ^ ete and drink as beestes yt wot not when they ha^ enough / and also
christian men he said aforsed they^ to fight samen / and euerychone to begyle
other / an^ also they are so proud yy they wot not how the may cloth them /
now long now short / now (...) te now wide / on all manner of wise. They shol^
be simple meke and soth fast and do alms as Ihes^ christ did in whom they
believe / and he said the are to covetous yt for a little silver they selle
they^ childern their systers and their wives / and one taken an other man's
wife and none holds his faith ^ other / and therefore said he for their sins
has go^ given these lands to our hondes / and not thoru^ our strength but all
for your sins. For we wo^ well forsooth when ye serve well your god that h^
will help you so yt no man shall win agay^ the land when they serve their
god well / but wh^ le they live so foully as they do / we have no dred^ of them
/ for their god shall not help them / ^ than I asked him how he knew the
state of ^ry sten men so / and he said that he knew well both o^ lords and
of commons by his messengers which h^ sent through all countries as it were
marchaunt^ with precious stones and other marchau^dyses (...) know the manner
of every country. And than h^ did call again all the lords in to the
chamber and than he showed me four persons yt were great lords in that
country yt devised me my country and other as in crystendome all as they had
be men of the same country / and they spoke Frensshe right well and the Soudan
also / and than had I great marvel of this sclau^der of our faith / and so
they yt should be turned by our good ensamples to the faith of Ihesu christ /
they are drawn away thorugh our evil living / and therefore it is no wonder
if they call us evil for they say soth / but the sarasyns are true for they
keep truly the commandments of their Alkaron yt god sent them by his
messengere Machomet / to whom they say yt Gabryell ye angel spoke often and
said him the will of god.

Of the birth of Machomet. ca. xlvi.
ANd ye shall understand that Machomet was born in Araby / and he was first a
poor knave and kept horse and went after marchau^dyse And so he came ones in
to Egypt with marchau^ dyse / and Egypt was yt same time christian / and there
was a chapel beside Araby and there was an hermyte / and when he came in to
the chapel that was but a little house and a low / as soon ye enter began to
be as great as it were of a paleys gate / and that was the first miracle that
the sarasyns say that he did in his youth. After began Machomet to be wise
and rich / and he was a great astronomer / and sythen was he keeper of the
land of the prince Lo rodan and governed it full well / in the which manner
that when the prince was deed he wedded the lady that men called Quadryge. And
Machomet fell often in the falling evil / wherefore the lady was wroth that
she had taken him to her husbon de. And he made her to understand that every
time that he fell so / he said yt Gabryell the angel spoke to him / and for
the great bryghtnes of the angel he fell^ down. This Machomet reigned in Araby
the year of our lord. vi. hundred and. xx. and he was of the kind of Ismaell
that was Abra hams sone yt he gate of Agar / and other are called Sarrasyns of
Sarra / but some are called Moaby tes / and some Amonytes after two sons of
Loath And also Machomet loved well a good man an hermyte that dwelled in
wilderness a mile from mount Synay in the way as men go fro Araby to Laldee
and a days Journey fro the sea where merchants of Venys came. And Machomet
went so often to this hermyte yt all his men were wroth / for he herd gladly
the hermyte preche / and did his men walk all the night / and his men thought
they would this hermyte were deed. So it befell on a night that Machomet was
full dronken of good wine and he fell in sleep / and his men took Macho mets
sword out of his shethe whiles he lay and slep te and therewith they slew the
hermyte / and afterward they put the sword up again all blody. And upon the
morrow when he found this hermyte thus deed / he was in his mind very angry
and right wroth / and would have done his men unto the death / but they all with
one accord and with one will said y^ he himself had slain him when he was
dronken / and they showed him his own sword all blody / and than byleued he
that they said sothe / and than he cursed the wine and all those that dron ke
it. And therefore sarrasyns y^ are devout drink no wine openly else they
should be repreued / but they drink good beuerage and sweet and norysshyn ge
that is made of Lalamels / and thereof is sugour made.



Also it befalls sometime that christian men become sarrasyns / either through
pouerte or symplenes or wickedness. And therefore their archebysshop when he
receives them says thus. Laeles ella Machomet rozes ella. That is to say.
There is no god but one and Machomet his messenger / And sythen I have told
you a part of their law and of their customs / and now I shall say you of
their letters that they have with their names. First they have for A almoy /
bethath for b. cathi c. ephoti for d. delphoy e. fothy f. garophin g. hechun h.
iocchi i. kathi k. lothun l. malach m. nahalot n. orthy o. choziri p. zoth q.
rutholat r. routhi s. solathi t. chatimus v. yrithom x. mazot z. zatepin ^.
iohetus ^. these are the names. These four letters they have yet more for
dyuersyte of their langage / for as much as they spoke so in their throtes as
we have A in our langage and speak in England. Two letters may than they have
in their a. b. c. That is to say y and z the which are called thorn and zowx.

Of the yles and of the meruayllous people and diverse beestes. ca. xlvij.
ANd sythen I have devised before of the ho ly land and countrees there about
and many ways thither / and to mount Synay to Babylon and other places of the
the which I have spoken

and anon he did deliver him out of prison and he ^maunded that spalme to be
said euety day at ^yme / and so he held Anastasius for a good christian ^an /
but he would never after go to his bysshopry^e for they accused him of heresy.
Topasonde ^as sometime holden of themperor of Constanty ^ple / but a great man
yt he sent to keep yt country ^enst the Turks / and held it to himself and
cal^ himself Emperor of Topasonde. and from thens men go through little Armony
and y^ country is an old castle that is on a Roche (...) men call the
castle of Sperwe / and there men ^de an hawke sitting upon a perke right well
(...) and a fair lady Fary y^ keeps it. And he yt (...) wake this same hawke
seven days and seven ^tes / and some say that it is but three days and three
nyghtes allone without any company and without sleep. This fair lady shall
come unto him at the. vij. days or three days end and shall grant unto him
the first thing that he will (...) of worldly things / and yt has often be
proved* And so (...) a time it betelle that a man which that time was king of
Armony that (...) (...) doughty man waked upon a time / and at the seven days
end the lady came unto him and badde hy^ a^ what he would for he had^ well
done his de^ ^oure. And the king answered and said yt he was ^ gr^te lord and
in good peace / and he was rich so the he would ask no thing but all oonly
the body (...) the fair lady to have his will of her. Than the fair lady
answered and said (...) that he was fool for he wist not what he asked / for he
myg^ not have her / for he should not ask but world^ thing and she was not
worldly. And the king sa^ he would naught ^llys. And she said to him sy^ he
would ask not else she should grant h^ three things and to all them yt
came after him said unto him. Sir king ye shall have war^ out peace unto the.
ix. degree / and ye shall be in s^ ^eccyon of your enmyes / and ye shall have
great n^ of good and catell / and ^ythen yt time all the ky^ of Armony have ^en
in warr^ and needful and (...) der trybute of the Sarasyns. Also a poor m^
son^ woke on a time and asked the lady yt he my^ be rich and happy in
marchaundyse / and the l^ granted him / but she said to him that he had
asked his undoing for great pride that he should have thereof. And this man
became so great a merchant both by see and by land that* he was so rich that
he knew not the thousenst part of his goods. Also a knight of the Templers
woke ones / and when he had done he desired to have a purse full of gold / and
what soever he took thereof she should ever be full again / and the lady
grant it him / but she told him that he had desired his destruc^yon for
great mystrowynge that he should have of the same purse* and so it befelle. But
he that shall wake has need to keep him from sleep / for if he sleep he is
lost that he shall never be seen / but that is not the right way / but for the
meruaylle. And from Topasonde men go to great Armony to a cite that men call
Artyron that was wont to be a good cite / but Turks have destroyed it / for
there neither grows no wine ne fruit. From this Artyron men go to an hylle
that is called Sabyssacoll / and there nere is an other hylle that men call
Ararath / but the Jews call it Thano where Archa Noe rested after the dyluuye
/ and yet is on that hylle / a man may see it fro far in clear weder / and
the hylle is. xij. mile of heyght / and some say they have be thereat and put
their fyngers in the hooles where the fend wen^e out when Noe said in this
manner wise. Benedicite. But they note well for no man may go on that hylle for
snow yt is always vvpon that hylle both winter and somer that no man may go
up and never yode sith Noe was / but a monk through the grace of god brought a
planke that is yet at the abbey at the hylle foot / and he had great desire to
go upon yt hylle and aforsed him thereto / and when he was at the third part
upward he was so weary that he might no ferther / and he rested him and slepte
and when he awoke he was down at the hylle foot and than prayed he to god
devoutly that he would suffer him to go upon the hylle / and the angel said
unto him that he should go upon the hylle / and so he did / and sythen that
time no man came there / and therefore men shall not believe such words.



And fro thens men goo to a cite that is called Tanzy^ / and that is a fair
cite and good. Beside that Cite is an hylle of salt and thereof every man take
what he will / and there dwelled many christian men under trybute of the
sarrasyns.



Fro thens men go through many cytees and towns and many castles toward Ynde /
and than come to a cite that men call Cassage that is a fair cy se / and in
that cite is ha^ondaunte of corn and wynes and of all manner goods / and there
met the three kings together that went to make their offrynge to our lord in
Bethleem. Fro that cite men go to a cite that men call Cardabago / and paynyms
say that christian men may not dwell there but they deye soon and they wot
not the cause And fro thens men go thorugh many countries cytees and towns yt
it were to long to tell / to the cite of Carnaa that was wont to be so great
that the wall about was of. xxv. mile / the wall shows yet / but it is not
now in habyte with men /

and there ends the land of the Emperor of Percy.
Of the country of Job and of the kingdom of Caldee. ca. xlix.
ON the other side of that cite of Carnaa men enter in to the land of Job /
that is a good land and great plente of all fruytes / and men call that land
the land of Swear. In this land is the cite of Thomar. Job was a paynym and
also he was Cofraas sone / and he held that land as prince thereof / and he
was so rich that he knew not the hondreth perte of his good / and after his
pouerte god made him rycher than ever he was before / for after he was king of
Ydumea after the death of king Esau / and when he was king he was called Ioab /
and in that kingdom he lived. C. year and. lxx. so yt he was of age when he
deyed. CC. year and. xlvin. And in this land of Job is no defaute of no thing
yt is needful to manes body. There ben hills where men find manna and manna
is called angels bread yt is a white thyn ge right sweet and much swetter than
sugour or ho ny and yt comes of the dew of heaven yt falls on the herbs /
and there it congeled and waxed white and men do it in medycynes for rich men.
This land mar ches to the land of Caldee yt is a great land and there is
full fair folk and well apparaylled / and they goo rychely arrayed with clothe
of gold and with perles and other precious stones. But the woman are right
foul and evil cladde and go bare foot and bear an ylle cote large wide and
short unto their knees and have long sleues down to the foot / and they have
great black here long hanging about their shulders and they are right foul
for to look upon that I dare not tell it all by cause that I am worthy for to
have a great reward for my praysynge of them. In this land of Caldee
aforsayd is a cite that men call Hur / and in yt cite was Abraham the
patryarke borne.

Of the kingdom of Amasony where as dwelled but wymmen. ca. l.


AFter the land of Caldee is the land of Amasony that is a land where is no
man but all wy^men as men say / for they will suffer no man live among them
ne to have lordshyp over them. For sometime was a king in yt land and men were
dwelling there as did in other countries and had wives / and it befelle yt
the king had a great war re with them of Sychy and he was called Colopius and
he was slain in battle and all the good blood of his land. And this queen
when ^he herd that and other ladies of that land yt the king and the lords
were slain / they gadred them together and killed all the men yt were left in
their land among them / and sythen that time dwelled no man amon ge them.
And when they will have any man to lie by them they send for them in a
country that is nere to their land / and the men come and are ther^ viij.
days or as the woman lykes and than go they again / and if they have men
childern they send them to their faders when they can ete and go / ^ if they
have maid childern they keep them* and if they be of gentle blood they
brenne the left pappe a way for berynge of a shield / and if they be of
little blood they brenne the right pappe away for shotynge. For those wy^men
of that country are good warryours and are often in so^de with other lords /
and the queen of that land governs well that land / this land is all
enuyronned with water. Beside Amasony is the land of Termagute that is a good
land and prouffytable / and for goodness of that land king Alexander did ma
ke a cite there that he called Alexander.



Of the land of Ethyope. ca. li.
ON the other side of Caldee toward y^ south side is Ethyope a gre^e land. In
this land on the south are the folk right black. In that sy de is a well
that on the day the water is so cold that no man may drink thereof / and on
the night it is so hot that no man may suffer to put his hand in it. In this
land the ryuers and all the waters are troublous and somdele salt for the
great hete / and men of that land are lightly dronken and have little appetyte
to mete / and they have commonly the flixe of body and they live not long.



In Ethyope are such men that has but one foot and they goo so fast that it
is a great meruaylle / and that is a large foot that the shadow thereof covered
the body fro the son or rain when they lay upon their backs / and when
their childern be first borne they look like russeth / and when they wax old
than they be all black. In Ethyope is the land of Saba / of the which one of
the three kings yt sought our lord at Bethleem was king.

Of Ynde the more and Ynde the less / and of dya mandes and small people and
other things. ca. lij.
FRo Ethyope men goo in to Ynde thorugh many diverse countries and it is called
Ynde the more / and it is departed in three parties / that is to say Ynde the
more that is a full hot land / and Ynde the less is a temperate land / and
the third part that is toward the north there is it right cold / so yt for
great cold and frost and ice the water becomes crystal / and upon that
grows the good dyamandes yt is like a trouble color / and that dyamande is
so hard yt no man may break it. Other dyamandes men find in Araby that are
not so good yt are more nesshe / and some are in Cypres and in Macedony men
find also dyamandes / but the best are in Ynde / and some are found many
times in a mass yt comes out where men find gold fro ye mine when men break
ye mass in pyeces / and some time men find some of gretnesse of a pese and
some less and those are as herd as those of Ynde / and all if it be yt men
find good dyamandes in Ynde upon the Roche of crystal. Also men find good
dyamandes upon the Roche of Adamande in the s^e and on hills as it were hasyll
nottes / and they are all square and poynted of their own kind / and they
grow both together male and female and are norisshed with the dew of heaven /
and they engender commonly and bring forth small childern yt multeplye and
grew all the years. I have many times assayed that if a man keep them with a
little of the roche and wete them with many dewes oftymes they shall grow
every year / and the small shall wax great / and a man shall bear the dyamande
in his lift side / and than is it of more virtue / for the strength of their
growing is toward the north / that is on the left side as men of those
countries say. To him that bears the dyamande upon him it gives him hardynes
/ it keeps his lymmes of his body / it gives vyctory of enemies if a man's
cause be right / and him yt bears it in good will it keeps him fro stryf fro
riot fro ill dremes and sorceryes and enchau^tementes / also no wild best
shall grieve him ne assail him. And also the dyamande should be given fre^y
without couetyse and byenge and than it is of more virtue / it heleth him that
is lunatyke and that is trauayled with a devil / and if venym or poison be
brought in the presence of the dyamande as soon it moysteth and begy^neth to
sweet / and men may well polyce them to make men believe that they may not be
polysshed. But me^ but it is so warm there in that isle that men's bal lokes
hang down to their shankes for the great dyssoluynge of the body. And men of
the country that know y^ manner do bind them up full strey te and anoynte
them with oynt^mentes made therefore for to hold them up or else they might
not live* In this land and many other men and wy^men lay them all naked in
Ryuers and waters from vndren of the day to it be passes none / and they lie
all* in water but the face for the great hete that is there / and the wymmen be
not ashamed for the men. In this isle are the ships without nails of iron or
bond for roches of adamande that are in the sea would draw ships to them.
Fro this isle men go by see to the isle of Cana where is great plente of corn
and wine / and the king of this ^le was sometime so mighty that he h^lde (...)
^yenst king Alexander with great strength.



Men of this isle have many manner of believe and faith and have also diverse
laws / for some do worship the son / some the fire / some the trees / and
some the serpents or any other thing that theyin first met in the morning
/ and some do worship symulacres and ydolles / but between symulacres and
ydolles is no dyfference / and that i^ to understand images made to lyknesse
of wha^ thing a man will that is not kyndely for some image has an heed as an
ox / and some have thr^ or four heedes / one of a man or an horse or an ox^ or
of any other be that no man has seen. And ye shall understand that they
that worship symulacres they worship them as for worthy me^ that were sometime
/ as Hercules and other that did many meruayles in their times. For they say
they wot well that they are not god of kind that ma de all thing / but that
they are well with god for the meruayles that they do / and therefore they
worship them. And so say they of the son for it chau^geth oftymes for it
gives sometime great he (...) for to nourysshe all things on e^the / and for
it is of so great profit they wot well it is not god but it is well with god
and that god loves it more than any other thing / and for this cause they
worship it. And also they say their reasons of other planetes and of fire also
for it is profitable and needful* And of ydolles they say that the ox is the
holiest best yt they may find here in earth and most profitable than any
other for he does much good and none ylle / and they wot well that it may not
be without special grace of god / and therefore they ma ke their god of an ox
the one half / and the other half a man / for man is the fairest and the best
creature of the world. And they do worship to serpen tes and other beestes
that they mete first at morrow and namely those beestes that have good metynge
after whom they speed well all day after / the whi ^he they have proved of
long time / and therefore they say that this good metynge comes of gods
grace / and therefore have they do make ymage^ like unto those things that they
may worship them before they mete any thing else.



And yet are some christian men that say that some bestes are better for to mete
than some / for hares and swyne and other bestes are ylle to mete first as they
say. In this isle of Cana is many wild beestes / and rattons of y^ country
are as great as hou^ des here* and they take them with mastytes* for cattes
may not take them. From thens men come to a cite that men call Sarchis / and
it is a fair and a good cite and there dwell many christian men of gods faith
/ and there be men of relygyon. Fro thens men come to the land of Lombe and in
that land wast peper in a forest that men call Tonber / and it wast in none
other place more in all the world than in that forest / and that forest is
well. l. days Journey / and there by the land of Lombe is the cite of Polomes
/ and * under that cite is an hylle that men call Polombe / and thereof takes
the cy^e his name. And so at the foot of the same hylle is a right fair and a
clear well that has a full good and sweet savor / and it smells of all
manner sorts of spyces. And also at each hour of the day i^ chau^geth his
savor dyuersly / and who so drynketh thryes on the day of that well he is
made hole of all manner sykenes that he has. I have some time dronken of that
well / and me thinks yet that I fa re the better / some call it the well
of youth / for they yt drink thereof seem to be young always and ly ue without
great sykenes / and they say this well co meth fro Paradyse terrestre for it
is so virtuous / and in this land grows gynger / and thither come many good
merchants for spyces. In this country men worship the ox for his great
symplenes and mekenes and the profit that is in him / for they ma ke the ox
to travail. vi. or. vij. year and than men do ete him. And the king of that
land has ever more one ox with him / and he that keeps him every day
takes his fees for the keeping. And also every day he gadreth his vryne and
his dou^ge in a vessel of gold and bears it to the prelate that they call
Archiporta papaton / and the prelate bears it to the king and makes thereupon
a great blessing. and than the king puts his hand therein and they call it
gaul / and he anoynteth his front and his breast therewith / and they do it
great worship and say he shall be fulfilled with the virtue of the ox before
said / and that he is hallowed through virtue of that holy thing as they say.
And when the king has thus done than do it other lords / and after them
other men after they are of degree if they may have any of the remenau^te. In
this country their ydolles are half man and half ox as the figure shows in
the second leef here before / and out of these ydolles the wicked ghoost
speaks to them and gives them answer of what thing y^ they ask him / and
before these ydolles they slay their childern many times and sprenge the blood
on the ydolles and so make they sacrefyce. And if any man deye in that country
they brenne him in tokenynge of penance that he should suffer no penance if
he were laid in the earth for etynge of worms. And if his wife have no
childern than they brenne her with him / and they say it is a good reason that
she keeps him company in the other world as she did* in this / and if she
have childern she may live with them and she will / and if the wife deye before
she shall be burnt and her husbonde also if he will. In this country grows
good wy ne / and women drink wine and men none / and woman shave their berdes
and men not.

Of the kingdom of Mabaron. ca. liiij.
^Ro this land men go many Iourneys to a country that men call Mabaron / and
this is a great kingdom / there in is many fair cytees and towns. In this
land lies Saint Thomas i^ a fair tomb in flesh and bones in the cite of
Calamy / and the arm and the hand yt he put in our lords side when he was
risen / when Christ said to him. Noli esse incredulus sed fidelis. That is to
say Be not of wanhope but believe / that same hand lies yet without the tomb
bare / and with this hon de they give their domes in that country to wete who
has right and who not / for if any stryf is between two parties they do write
their right in to two bylles and those bylles are put in saint Thomas hand /
and as soon the hand casts away y^ bylle that has wrong and holds the
other stylle yt has ^yght / and therefore they come fro far countrees to have
Iugementes of causes that are in doubt. In y^ church of saint Thomas is a
great image that is a symulacre and it is well dyght with rich pre cyous stones
and perles / and to yt image men come in to pilgrimage fro far countries with
great de nocyon as christian men go to saint James / and there come some in
pilgrimage yt bear sharp knyues in their hondes / and as they go by the way
they shere their shankes and thyghes yt the blood may come out for the love of
yt ydoll / and they say yt he is holy that will deye for yt ydolles sake. And
there is some yt fro the time yt they go out of their houses at each third
pace they knele to yt they come to this ydoll.



And when they come there they have ensence / or such other thing for to
ensence the ydoll as we would do to gods body. And there is before that
mynster or church of this ydoll a vyuer full of water / and in that vyuer
pylgryms cast gold / silver / perles / and other precious stones without
nombre instead of offrynges and therefore when as the master of the mynster
has any need of helping / as soon they go to that vyuer and take there out
as much as they have need to helping of the mynster. And ye shall understand
when that any great festes come of that ydoll as the dedycacyon day of the
church or of the thronynge of the ydoll all the country there about assembled
them there together / and than men set this ydoll with great reverence and
worship in a chair well dyght with rich csothes of gold and other of
tapestry / and so they carye him with great reverence and worship round about
the cite / and before the chair gooth first in processyon all the maidens of
the country two and two together / and so after them go the pylgryms that are
come fro far countrees of which pylgryms some fall down before the chair
and lateth all go over them and so are they some slain and some are broken
their arms and shan kes and this do they for love of the ydoll / and they
believe the more pain that they suffer here for their ydoll the more Joy shall
they have in the other world / and a man shall find few christian men that
will suffer so much penance for our lords sake as they do for their ydoll.
And nyghe before the chair go all mynstrelles of the country as if were
without nombre with many diverse melodyes.



And when they are come again to the church they set up the ydoll again in
his throne / and for worship of the ydoll two men or three are slain with
sharp knyues with their good will. And also a man thinks in our country
that he has a great worship and he have an holy man in his kyn Like wise say
they there that those that are thus slain are holy men and saints / and they
are written in their letany / and when they are thus deed their friends brenne
their bodies and they take the ashes and those are kept as relykes and they
say it is holy thing / and that they have doubt of no peril when they have
of those ashes.

Of a great country called Lamory where the peo ple go all naked / and other
thynge^. ca. lv.


ARo this country. lij. Iourneys is a country that men call Lamory / and in
that land is great hete / and it is the custom there that men and wy^men goo
all naked / and they scorn all them that are cladde / for they say that god
made Adam and Eve all naked and that men should have no shame of that that god
made / and they believe in the same god that made Adam and Eve and all the
world / and there is no woman wedded but woman are all common there / and the
forsake no man. And they say that god commanded to Adam and Eve and all that
came of them saying. Crescite ^t multiplicamini et repleti terra^. That is to
say in English. Wexe and be multeplyed and fylle the ^rthe / and no man may
say there. This is my wife. Ne woman say. This is my husbonde. And when they

And beside this isle of Lamory is another isle that men call Somober and is a
good isle / men of that isle do mark them in the vysage with an ho te iron men
and wy^men for great nobley and to be known from other / for they hold them
self the worthyest of the world / and they have war euermo ^e with those men
that are naked that I spoke of before. And there are many other yles and
diverse manners of men of which it were ouermoche for ^o speak of all.

Of the country and isle named Iana and is a mighty land. ca. lvi.
ANd there is a great isle that men call Iana / and the king of that country
has vnde^ him. vij. kings for he is a full mighty prince.



In this isle grows all manners of spyces more plenteuously than in other
places / as gynger / clowes / canell / nutmygges / and other / and ye shall
understand that the nutmygge bears the maces / and all thing therein is
plente sauf wine. The king of this land has a rich palace and the best that
is in the world / for all the greces in to his halle and chambres ben all made
one of gold and an other of silver / and all the walls are covered and plated
with gold and silver / and in those plates are written stories of knights and
bataylles / and y^ pauyment of the halle and chambres is of gold and of silver
/ and there is no man y^ would believe the richesse y^ is there but if he had
seen it / and the king of this isle (...) so mighty y^ he has many times
overcome the great Chane of Cathay that is the myghtyst Em perour that is in
all the world / for there is often war among them / for the great Chane
would make him hold his land of him.

call it Sala mass / and is a great kingdom with many fair cytees



In this land grow trees yt bear mele of which men make fair bread and
white and of good savor / and it seems like as it were of whete. And there be
other trees that bear venym / again the which is no medycyne but one / that
is to take of the leaves of the same tree and stampte them and tempre them
with water and drink it or else he shall deye suddenly for tryacle may not
help. And if ye will wete how the trees bear mele I shall tell you / men hew
with an hachet about the rote of the tree by the earth so that no berke be
perced in many places / and than comes out a lycoure thycke which they take
in a vessel and put it to the son and dry it / and when it is dry they do
it unto the mylle to grynde and so it is fair mele and white / and honey and
wine and venym are drawn out of other trees in the same manner and do it in
vessels to keep. In that isle is a deed see / yt is a water yt has no ground /
and if any thing fall therein it shall never be found / beside yt see grows
great can and under their rotes men find precious stones of great ver tue /
for he yt bears one of those stones upon him there may no iron dear hy^ ne
draw blood on him and therefore they yt have those stones fight full hardely
for there may no quarrel ne such thing dear them / therefore they yt know ye
manner make their quarrels without iron and so they slay them.

Of the kingdom of Talonach where the king has many wives. ca. lviij.
THan is there an other isle yt men call Talonach that is a great land and
plenteuous of goods and fysshes as ye shall here herafter.





And the king of this land has as many wives as he will a thousand and mo /
and lies never by one of them but ones. And yt land has a marvel yt is in
no other land. For all manner fysshes of thee comes there ones a year one
after other and lies them nere the land / sometime on ye land and so lie
three days and men of yt land come thyd and take of them what he will / and
than go those fysshes away and an other manner comes and lies also three days
and men take of they^ / and thus do all manner fysshes till al have be there and
men have taken what they will. And men wot not the cause why it is. But they
of that country say / that those fysshes come so thither to do worship to
their king for they say he is the most worthyest king of the world / for he
has so many wives and geteth so many childern of them.



And that same king has. xiiij. M. olyfau^tes or moo which be all tame and
they be all fed of the men of his country for his pleasure by cause yt he
may have them ready to his hand when he has any war against any other kings
or princes / and than he does put upon their backs castles and men of war as
the use is of yt land / and like wise do other kings and princes there about.

this isle when that their friends are syke and that they believe surely that they
shall deye / they take them and hang him up all quycke on a tree / and say
it is better that birds yt are angels of god ete them than worms of the
earth. Fro thens men go to an isle there the men are of ylle kind / for the
nourys she hou^des for to strangle men. And when their friends are syke yt they

call god / and he that may most slay is of most name among them. And if
two men be at strife and they be made at one them behooves to drink either
others blood / or else the accord is naught. Fro this isle men go to an isle

Of the kingdom named Mancy and is the best kingdom of the world. ca. lxiij.
TO goo fro this isle toward the eest many Iourneys a man shall find a kingdom
yt is called Mancy and this in Ynde the more / and it is most delectable and
plente of goods of all the worl de. In this land dwell christian men and
sarasyns / for it is a great land / and therein is. ij. M. great cytees and
other many towns. In this land no man goth on beggynge for theris no power
man / and the men ha ue berdes thynne of here as it were cattes. In this land

/ and theris a cite that men call Latorym and is more than Paris / and in yt
land are birds twyes gretter than it be here. and there is good chepe of all
manner of vytayles / In this country are white hens and they bear no feathers
but wolle as sheep do in our land / and women of that country y^ are wedded

vyners / and as soon he brings out of the water great fysshes / and thus
take they fysshe as long as they myll to (...) them needs. Fro this cite men

most cite of the world / and that cite is fyfty mile about / and there is in
yt cite ^o than.xij. pryn cypall gates without. Fro thens within three mile is
an other great cite / and within this cite are more than.xij. thousand brydges
/ and upon each bridge is a strong toure where the kepers dwell to keep it
again the great Chane for it marches on his land / and on one side of the
cite renneth a great river / and there dwell christian men and other / for it is
a good country and. ^teuous and there grows right good wine / this is a
noble cite where the king of Mancy was wont to dwell / and there dwell
relygyous men christian freres. And men go upon y^ river till they come to an
abbey of monks a little fro the cite / and in yt abbey is a great gardeyn and
fair and therein is many manner of trees of diverse fruytes In yt gardeyne dwell
many manner of beestes as baboynes / apes / marmosettes and other / and when the
covent has eten a monk takes the releef and bear it in to the gardeyn and
smyteth ones with a belle of silver which he hold in his hand / and anon
come out these bestes yt I spoke of and many mo nere.iij. or.iiij. thousand
and he gives they^ to ete of fair vessels of silver / and when they have eten
he smyteth the belle again and they go again their way. And the monk says
yt those bestes are souls of men yt are deed / and those beestes yt are fair
are souls of lords and other rich men / and those yt are foul bestes are
souls of other commons. And I asked them if it had not be better to give yt
relef to poor men / and they said theris no poor man in yt country / and if
there were yet it were more alms to give it to tho se souls yt suffer there
their penance and may go no ferther to get their mete than to men yt have wit
/ te and may travail for their mete. Than come men to a cite that is called
Chybens and there was the first sege of the king of Mancy. In this cite are.lx.
brydges of stone as fair as they may be.

Of the land of Pygmeen wherein dwelled but small people of three span long.

land of the great Chane. This River gooth through the land of Pygmeens / and
there men are of little stature for they are but three span long and they are
right fair both men and women though they be little / and they are wedded
when they are half a year old / and they live but viij year / and he that
lived. viij. year is holden right old / and these small men are the best work
men of sylke and of cotton in all manner thing that are in the worl de. And
these small men travail not nor till no land / but they have among them
great men as we are to travail for them / and they have great scorn of those
great men as we would have of grauntes or of them and they were among us.

fair country and rich full of goods and marchau^dyses / thither come mar
chauntes every year for to fetch spyces and other marchau^dyses more commonly
than they do in to other countries. And ye shall understand that merchants
that come from Denis of fro Geene or from other places of Lombardy or of
Romayne / they go by see and land.xi. months and more or they may come to
Cathay.

Of a great cite named Cadon where in is the great Chans palace and sege. ca.

IN the prouynce of Cathay toward the eest is an old cite / and beside that
cite the Tartarynes have made an other Cite that men call Cadon that has.xij.
gates / and ever between two gates is a great mile / so that those two cytees
the old and ^he new is round about.xx. mile. In this cite is the palace and
sege of the great Chane in a full fair place and great of which the walls
about is two mile / and within that are many fair places and in the gardeyne
of that palace is a right great hylle on the which is an other palace / and it
is the fairest that may be found in any place / and all about yt hylle are
many trees berynge diverse fruytes / and about that hylle is a great dyche /
and there nere are many vyuers on each side / and in those are many wild
fowls that he may take and go not out of the palace. Within the halle of that
palace are.xxiiij. pylers of gold / and all the walls are covered with rich
skynnes of beestes that men call panters. Those are fair beestes and well
smelling and of the smelle of the skynnes none evil smelle may come to the
palace / those skynnes are as reed as blood / and they shine so again the
son yt uneaths may men behold them / and men praise those skynnes as much
as it were gold. In mids of that palace is a place made yt they call the
mou^tour for the great Chane that is well made with precious stones and great
perles hanging about / and at the four corners of that mou^tour are four
nedders of gold / and under that mou^tour and above are conduytes of beuerage
that they drink in thempe^^ours court. And the halle of that palace is
rychely dyght and well / and first at the over end of the halle is the throne
of the Emperor right hye where he sytteth at mete at a table yt is well bordu
red with gold and that bordure is full of precious stones and grrete perles /
and the greces on which he gooth up are of diverse precious stones bordred with
gold. At the lift side of his throne is the sege of his wife a degree lower
than he sytteth and that is of Jasper bordured with gold / and the sege of his
se^onde wife is a degree lower than the first and that ^s also of good Jasper
bordured with gold / and ^he sege of the third wife is a degree lower than ^he
second / for ^ape he has three wives with ^ym where soever he is / vesyde
these wives on the same side sytteth other ladies of his kynne echone lower
than other as they are of degree / and all those that are wedded have a
counterfeet of a man's foot upon their heedes a cubyte long and all made with
precious stones / and above are they made with shynynge feders of pecoks or
such other in tokenynge that they are in subgeccyon of man and under man's
foot / and they that are not wedded have none such. And on the right side of
the Emperor sytteth first his sone that shall be Emperor after him / and he
sytteth also a degree lower than the Emperor in such manner of seges as the
Emperor sytteth / and by him sytteth other lords of his kynne echone lower
than other as they are of degree. And the emperor has his table by himself
allone that is made of gold and precious stones or of white crystal or yelowe
bordred with gold / and echone of his wives has a table by herself. And under
the Emperors table sytteth four clerks at his feet that write all yt the
Emperor says be it good or ylle. And at great festes above the Emperors
table and all other tables in the halle is a vine made of fine gold yt gooth
all about the halle and it has many branches of grapes like to grapes of the
vine / some are white / some are yelowe / some reed / some grene / and some
black / all the reed are of rubyes of cremas or alabau^ce / the white ar^ of
crystal or by call / the yelowe are of topaces / the grene are of emeraudes
and crysolytes / and the black^ are of quyches and gerandes / and this vine is
made thus of precious stones so properly that it seems as i^ were a vine
growing. And before the board of the Enperour stands great lords / and no
man is so hard to speak to him but it be mynstrels for to solace the emperor.
And all the vessel that is se^ ued in his halle or chambres are of precious
stones and namely at tables where great lords ete / that is to say / of
Jasper / crystal / amatyst / or fine gold and the cups are of emeraudes /
sapphires / topaces. and other many manner of stones / and of silver have they
no vessel for they praise silver but little to make vessel of / but they
make of silver greces py lers and pauymentes of halles and of chambres. And ye
shall understand yt my fellow and I was in soudy with him.xvi. months again
the king of Mancy upon whom he made war / and the cause was for we had so
great desire to see the nobley of his court if it were such as we herd speak
of / and forsooth we found it more rycher and solemn than ever we herd speak
of / and we should never have byleued it had we not seen it / but ye shall
understand yt mete and drink is more honest among us than it is in those
countries / for all the commons ete upon skynnes of bestes on their knees and
ete but flesh of all manner bestes / and when they have all eten they wype
their hondes on their skyrtes and they ete but ones on the day and ete but
little bread / but the esta te of the lords is full nobley and full rychely.

Wherefore that the Emperor of Cathay is call led the great Chane. ca. lxviij.
ANd ye shall wete why he is called the great Chane / ye wot well that all the
world was destroyed with Noes flood but Noe and his wife and his childern. Noe
had three sons Sem Cham and Iapheth. Cham was he yt saw his faders balockes
naked when he slepte and scorned it / and therefore was he cursyd / and Iapheth
covered it again. These three brethern had all the land. Cham took the best
part ecstwarde yt is called Asia. Sem took Affryke. and Iapheth took Europe.
Cham was the myghtyest and rychest of his brethern / and of him are come the
paen folk and diverse manner of men of the yles / some hedles / and other men
dysfygured / and for this Cham the Emperor there called him Cham and lord of
all. But ye shall understand yt the Emperor of Cathay is called Chane and not
Cham* and for this cause it is not long gone yt all Tartary was in subgeccyon
and thrall to other nacyons about / and they were made herdemen to keep beestes
/ and among them was. vij. lynages or kyn des / the first was called Tartary
yt is the best / the second lynage is called Tanghot / the third Eu race /
the fourth Valayre / the fyfthe Semoth / the sixth Menchy / the seventh
Sobeth. These are all holding of the great Chane of Cathay. Now it befelle so
yt in the first lynage was an old man and he was not rich and men call hy^
Changyus. This man lay and slept on a night in his bed / and there came to
him a knight all white sitting upon a white horse and said to him. Chane
slepest thou / god that is almighty sent me to the / and it is his will yt thou
say to the. vij. lynages yt thou shall he their Emperor / for ye shall
conquer all the lands yt are about you and they shall be in your subgeccyon
as ye have be in theyrs. And when morrow came he rose up and said it to the.
vij. lynages / and they scorned him and said he was a fool. And the night after
the same knight came to the. vij. lynages and badde them of gods behalf to
make Changyus their Emperor and they should be out of all subgec cyon. And on
the morrow they chose Changyus to Emperor and did him all worship yt they
might do and called him Chane as the white knight called him / and they said
they would do as he badde them. Than he made many statutes and laws the
which he called Ysakan. The first statute was that they should be obedyent to
god almighty / and believe yt he should deliver them out of thraldom / and yt
they should call on him in all their works. An other statute was that all men
yt might bear arms should be nombred and to each. x. should be a master and
to an hundred a master / and to a thousand a master. Than he commanded to
all the grettest and pryn cypalest of the. vij. lygnages that they should
forsake all that they had in heritage or lordshyp / and that they should
hold them paid of that he would give them of his grace / and they did so
And also he badde them yt each man should bring his eldest sone before him
and slay his own sone with his own hondes and smite of their heedes. and as
soon they did his bidding. And when he saw they made no lettynge of yt he
badde them do / than badde he them follow his baner / and than he put in
subgeccyon all the lands about him.

How the great Chane was hid under a tree and so escaped his enmyes by cause
of a bird. ca. lxix.
ANd it befelle on a day that the Chane to de with a few men to see the land
that he had won / and he met with a great multitude of his enemies and
there he was cast down of his horse and his horse slain. And when his men saw
him at the earth they wend he had be deed and fled / and the enemies followed
after / and when he saw his enemies were far he hid him in a busshe. for
the wood was thycke there / and when they were come again fro the chasse they
went to seek amon ge the wood if any were hid there / and they found many.
And as they came to ye place where he was / they saw a bird sytte upon a tree
the which byr de men call an oule / and than said they yt there was no man
for that bird sat there and so went they away / and thus was the Chane saved
fro death / and so he went away on a night to his own men which were glad
of his coming. And fro that time hyderwardes men of that co^utree have do gre
te worship to that bird and for that cause they worcester ship that bird above all
the birds of the world And than he assembled all his men and rode upon his
enemies and destroyed them. And when he had won all the lands that were
about him he held them in subgeccyon. And when the Chane had won all the
lands to mount Belyan / the white knight come to him in a vysyon again and
said unto him. Chane the will of god is that thou pas se the mount Belyan and
thou shall win many lands / and for thou shall find no passage go thou to
mount Belyan that is upon the sea side and knele.ix. times thereon against the
eest in the worship of god and he shall show the a way how thou shall pass /
and the Chane did so / and anon the sea that touched the hylle withdrowe him
and showed him a fair way of.ix. foot brood between the hylle and the sea /
and so he passed right well with all his men and than he wanne the land of
Cathay that is the most land and the grettest of all the world / and for
those.ix. knelynges and the.ix. foot of way the Chane and the men of Tartary
have the nombre of.ix. in great worship.

Of the great Chanes letters and the writing about his seal. ca. lxx.
(...) than say those men with a loud boys to all the halle now he stylle a
while / and than says one of y^ phylosophres each man make reverence and
enclyne to the emperor yt is gods sone and lord of the worl de for now is
time and hour / and than all men enclyne to him and knele on the earth / and
than byddeth the phylosophre them rise up again / and at an other hour an
other phylosophre byddeth they^ all put their finger in their eerys and they do
so / and at an other hour an other phylosophre byddeth yt all men shall lay
their hand on their heed and they do so / and than he byddeth them take away
and they do so / and thus fro hour to hour they bydde diverse things / and I
asked pryuely what this should mean and one of the masters said yt the
enclynynge and the knelynge on the earth at yt time has this token / that all
those men that kneled so shall evermore be true to the emperor / that for no
gift ne hetynge they shall never be traitors ne falls to hy^ And the putting
of y^ finger in the eere has this token / yt none of those shall here none
ylle be spokey of the Emperor or his counsel. And ye shall understand yt
men dyght no thing / clothes / bread / drink / nor none such things to
the emperor but at certain hours that the phylosophres tell and if any man
reyse war against that Emperor in what country so it be these phylosophres
wot it soon and tell the Emperor or his counsel / and he sends men
thither for he has many men. And he has many men to keep birds as garfaukons
sperhaukes / faucons / gentyls / laners / sacres / popyniayes that are speaking
and many other. x. thousand olyfau^tes / baboynes / marmosettes and other /
and he has ever about him many physycyens more than two hundred that are
christian men and. xx. sa rasyns / but he trusts more in christian men than in
sarasyns. And there is in that country many ba rons and other servants that
are christian and converted to the good faith thorugh prechynge of good christian
men that dwell there / but there are many that will not that men wete that
they are christian.

Of the great richesse of this Emperor and of his dyspendynge. ca. lxxij.
THis Emperor is a great lord for he may dyspende what he will without nombre
/ by cause he spended another silver another gold / and he made no money but of
leder or skynnes / and this same money gooth thorugh all his land / and of
the silver and gold builded he his palace. And he has in his chamber a pyler
of gold in the which is a Ruby and a carbuncle of a foot long the which
lyghteth all his chamber by night / and he has many other precious stones and
rubyes but this is the most. This Emperor dwells in the somer toward the
North in a cite that men call Saydus and there it is cold enough / and in the
winter he dwells in a cite that men call Camalach and there it is right hot
/ but for the most part is he to Cadon that is not far thens.

Of the ordinance of the lords of the emperor when he rydeth from one country
to another or to war. ca. lxxiij.
ANd when this great Chane shall tide from one country to an other they
ordeyne four oostes of people / of which the first gooth before a days
Iourneye / for that oost lies at even where the Emperor shall lie on the
morrow / and there is plente of vytayls. And an other oost comes at the right
side of him and an other at the lift side / and in each oost is much folk.
And than comes the fourth oost behind him a bow draught / and there is more
men in than in any of the other. And ye shall understand that y^ Emperor
rydeth on no horse but when he will go to any secret place with a pryue meyne
where he will not be known / but he rydeth in a charyotte with four wheles /
and there upon is a chamber made of a tree that men call lignu^ aloes that
comes out of Paradyse terrestre and that chamber is covered with plates of
fine gold and precious stones and perles / and four olyfau^tes and four oxen
all white gone there in. And five or six great lords ryden about him so that
none other men shall come nere him but if the Emperor call any. And in that
same manner with charyotte and such oostes rydeth the Empress by an other side
/ and the Emperors eldest sone on the same array / and they have so much
people that it is a great marvel for to see.

How the Empire of the great Chane is departed in to. xij. prouynces / and how
that they do cast ensence in the fire where the great Chane passes thorugh the
cytees and towns in worship of the Emperor. ca. lxxiiij.
THe land of the great Chane is departed in. xij. prouynces / and each
prouynce has more than two thousand cytees and towns. Also when the emperor
tydeth through the country / and he passes through cytees and towns / each man
makes a fire before his house and casts therein ensence and other things yt
give good smell to the emperor. And if any men of relygyon yt are christian dwell
nere as the emperor comes they mete him with processyon with a cross and holy
water / and they sing Veni crea tor spiritus with a loud voice. And when he
see them come he commands the lords y^ ride nere him to make way yt the
relygyous men may come to him / and when he see the cross he does of his hatte
that is made of precious stones and great perles / and yt hatte is so rich
that it is marvel to tell and than he enclyned to the cross. And the
prelate of the relygyous men says orysons before him and gives him the
benyson with the cross / and he enclyneth to the benyson full devoutly / and
than the same prelate gives him some fruit of the nombre of.ix. in a plate of
gold as peers or apples or other fruit / and than the Emperor takes one
thereof and the other he gives to his lords / for the manner is su he there
that no strange man shall come before the emperor but he give him some what
after the old law that says. Non accedat in ^spectu me^ inanis. That is to
say. No man come in to my sight idle. And than the Emperor byddeth these
relygyous men yt they shall go forth so that men of his oost defoule them not.
And those relygyous men that dwell where the Empress or the Emperors sone
comes do in the same manner.

How that the great Chane is the myghtyest lord of all the world. ca. lxxv.
THis great Chane is the myghtyest lord of the world / for prester Johan is
not so great a lord as he / ne the Soudan of Babylon ne the Enperour of Persy.
In his land a man has hundred wives / and some.xl. some more some less / and
they take of their kynne to wives all save their systers of their moders / but
their systers of their faders other wives they take also / and they take also
well their stepmoder if their fader be deed / and men and women have all one
manner of clothing so that they may not be known but yt women that are wedded
bear a token on their heedes / and they dwell not with their husbondes / but
he may lie by which that he will. They have plente of all manner of bestes save
swyne and for soth they will none / and they believe well in god yt made all
thing and yet have they ydols of gold and silver / and to those ydols they
offer their first milk of their bestes.

Yet of other manners of this country. ca. lxxvi.
THis Emperor the great Chane has three wives / and the pryncypall wife was
preester Iohans daughter. And the people of this country begin to do all
their things in the new moan / and they worship much the son and the moon
those men ride commonly without spores / and they hold it great sin to break
a bone with an other and to cast milk on the earth or other lycour yt men may
drink. And the most sin that they may do is to pysse in their houses there
they dwell / and he that pysseth in his house shall be slain / and of those
sins they shryue them to their priests / and for their penance they shall
give silver / and the pla ce where men have pysseth shall be hallowed / or else
may no man come there. And when they have do their penance they shall pass
through a fair fire or two to wake them clean of their sins. And (...)

thou be our lord and our Emperor. And he enquyreth of them and says if ye
will that I regne upon you so must ye do all that I bydde you to do. And if he
bydde that any be slain he shall be slain / And they answer all with one
voice / all that ye bydde shall be done. Than says the emperor fro now forth my
words shall cut as my sword / and than they set him in a chair and
crown him / and than all the good towns therabout send to him presents so
much that he shall have more than hundred Camels laden with gold and silver
beside other Jewels that he shall have of lords of precious stones and gold
without nombre / and horse and ryhe clothes of camacas and tartaryns and such
other.

What countries and kyngdoms lay next to the lon de of Cathay and the frontes
thereof. ca. lxxix.
THis land of Cathay is in Asye the deep / and this same land marches
toward ye west upon the kingdom of Sercy the which was some time to one of
the three kings that went to seek our lord in Bethleem / and all those yt
come of his kynne are christian. These men of Tartary drink no wine. In the
land of Corosaym that is at the northsyde of Cathay is right great plente of
good but no wine / the which has at the e^st side a gre te wilderness that
lastech more than an hundred Iourneys / and the best cite of that land is
called Corosaym and thereafter is the land so called / and men of this land
are good warryours and hardy / and thereby is the kingdom of Comayn / this the
most and the grettest kingdom of the world / but it is not all Inhabyte / for
in one place of that land is so great cold yt no man may dwell there for
cold / and in an other place is great hete that no man may dwell there / and
there are so many feyghes that a man wot not on what side he may torn him /
and in this land are but few trees berynge fruit. In this land men lie in
tents and they brenne dou^ge of bestes for defaute of wood. This land
descends toward Pruyse and Rossy / and thorugh this land renneth the river
Echell yt is one of the great test ryuers of the world / and it is frosen so
hard every year that men fight thereon in great batayles on horse / and foot men
more than hundred thousand at ones. And a little fro that river is the great
see of Occean that they call Maure / and between this Maure and Caspye is a
full strayte passage to go toward Ynde and therefore king Alexander did make
there a cite that men call Alexander for to keep that passage / so that no man
may pass but if he have leave / and now is that cite called Port de fear / and
the pryncypall cite of Comayn is called Sarachys / this one of three ways to go
in to Ynde / but through this way may not many men go but if it be in winter /
and this passage is called Berbent. And an other way is for to go from the
land of Turkescon through Persy / and in this way are many Iourneys in
wyldernes. And the third way is yt comes fro Cosmane and goth through the
great cite and through the kingdom of Abachare. And ye shall understand that
all these kyngdoms and lands unto Persy are holden of the great Chane of
Cathay and many other / and therefore he is a full great lord of men and of
land.

Of other ways coming from Cathay towar de the Greeks see. And also of the
Emperor of Persy. ca. lxxx.
NOw have I devised you the lands towar des the north to come fro ye lands of
Cathay to the lands of Pruyse and Rossy where christian men dwell. Now shall I
deuyse to you other lon des and kyngdoms in coming down fro Cathay to the
Greeks see where christian men dwell. And for as much as next the great Chane
of Cathay the Emperor of Persy is the grettest lord / therefore I shall first
speak of him / and ye shall under stand that he has two kyngdoms / the one
begy^neth eestwarde and is the kingdom of Turkescon / and it lasts westwarde
to the sea of Caspye / and southwarde to the land of Ynde / and this land is
good and plain and well manned / good cytees / but two most pryncypall of the
cytees are called Ba ^yryda and Sormagau^t. The other is the kingdom of Persy /
and lasts fro the river of Physon unto the great Armony / and northwarde unto
the sea of Caspye / and southwarde to the land of Ynde / and this is a full
plenteuous country and good / and in this lon de are three pryncypall cytees.
Nessabor. Saphan. and Sarmasse.

Of the land of Armony which is a good land / and of the land of Myddy. ca.
lxxxi.
THan is ye land of Armony in which was sometime three kyngdoms / this is a
good lo^ de and plenteuous / and it begins at Persy and lasts westwarde to
Turkey of length / and in breed lasts fro the cite of Alexander yt now is
called Port de fear unto ye land of Myddy. In this Armony are many fair cytees
/ but Canryssy is most of name Than is the land of Mydde and is full long
and not brood / and begins eestwarde at ye land of Persy and Ynde the less
and lasts westwarde to ye kingdom of Caldee / and northwarde to little
Armony. In this Myddy are many great hills and little plain and there dwell
Sarasyns and an other manner of men that men call Cordyns and Karmen.

Of the kingdom of George and of Abcan and many meruayles. ca. lxxxij.
THan next is the kingdom of George y^ begyuneth eestwarde at a great hylle
that men call Abyor / this land lasts fro Turkey to the great see and the
land of Myddy and the great Armony. and in this land are two kings one of
Abcan / and an other of George / but he of George is in subgeccyon to the great
Chane / but he of Abcan has a strong country and defends him well again
his enemies. And in this land of Abcan is a great marvel / for there is a
country in that lon de that is nere three days long and about / and it is
called Hamfon / and that country is all covered with myrkenes / so that it
has no light yt no man may see there / and noman dar go in to that cou^ tree
for the myrkenes. And nevertheless men of the country thereby say that they may
sometime here therein the voys of men and horse whynynge and cocks crow and they
wot well that men dwell there* but they wot not what manner of men / and they
say this myrkenes comes through miracle of god that he did for christian men
there. For there was a wyc ked Emperor that was of Poy / and he was called
Saures and he pursued sometime all christian men to destroy / and did them make
sacrefyce to his false gods* and in that country dwelled many christian men the
which left all their goods and catelles and richesse and would go in to
Greece / and when they were all in a great plain yt is called Megon the emperor
and his men came to slay these christian men / and than ye christian men all set
they^ on their knees and prayed to god / and anon came a thycke cloud and
ouerlapped the emperor and all his oost / so that he might not go away and so
dwell they in myrkenes / and they came out never after / and the christian men
went where they would / and therefore they might say thus Adn^o factu^ est
istud et est mirabile in oculis n^is That is to say. Of our lord is this done
and it is wonderful in our eyes. Also out of this myrke lon de comes a River
that men may see by good token that men dwell therein.

Of the land of Turkey and diverse other cou^trres and of the land of
Mesopotamye. ca. lxxxiij.
THan next is the land of Turkey that mar cheth to great Armony / and therein
are many countries as Capadoce. Saure. Bryke. Quesycyon Pytan and Geneth / in
echone of those countries are many good cytees / and it is a plain land and
few hills and few ryuers / and than is the kingdom of Mesopotamye that
begynnet estwarde at flom of Tygre at a cite that men call Mosell / and it
lasts westwarde to the flom of Eufraten to a cy te that men call Rochaym /
and westwarde fro high Armony unto the wilderness of Ynde the less / and it
is a good land and plain / but there is few ryuers and there is but two
hills in that land / the one is called Symar / and the other Lyson / and it
marches to the land of Caldee. And ye shall wete that the land of Ethyope
marches eestwarde to the great wilderness / westwarde to the land of Nuby /
southwarde to the land of Marytane / and northwarde to the reed see / and than
is Marytane yt lasts fro yt hills of Ethyope unto Lyby yt high and the low
yt lasts to the great see of Spain.

Of diverse countries and kyngdoms and yles and mer uayles beyond the land of
Cathay. ca. lxxxiiij.
NOw have I said and spoken of many on this side of the great kingdom of
Cathay of whom many are obeysaunt to the great Chane / Now shall I say of
some lands and countries and yles yt are beyond the land of Cathay. Who so
goth fro Cathay to Ynde the high and the low he shall go through a kingdom yt
men call Cadissen and is a great land / there grows a manner of fruit as it
were goordes / and when it is ripe men cut it asonder and men find therein a
be as it were of flesh of bone and blood as it were a little lamb without
wolle and men ete the best and the fruit also and that is a great marvel.
Nevertheless I said them yt I held that for no marvel / for I said in my
country are trees that bear fruit that become birds fleing and they are
good to ete / and that yt falls in water lived / and that that falls on the
earth deyed and they had great marvel of this. In this land and many other
about there are trees yt bear clowes and nutmygges and canell and many other
spyc^*



and there are vynes that here so great grapes that a strong man shall have
enough to do to bear a cluster of the grapes. In that same land are the hills
of Caspye that men call Vber / and among those hills are the Jews of the.x.
hyndes enclo sed within that men call Gog and Magog and they may not come out
on no side. There was en closed.xxij. kings with their folk yt dwelled
between the hills of Syche / and king Alexander chased them thither among
those hills / for he trusted to have enclosed them there thorugh werkynge of
men but he might not / and when he saw that he might not he prayed to god that
he would fulfylle yt he had begone / and god herd his prayer and enclosed the
hills together so yt the Jews dwell there as they were locked in / and there
is hills all about them but at yt one side and there is the sea of Caspye.
And some men might ask / there is a see on one side why go they not out there
/ for there to answer I that all if it be called a see it is no see / but a
stange standing among hills / and it is the grettest stange of all the
world / and if they went over the sea they wot not where for to aryue / for
they can no speech but their own. And ye shall understand that the Jews have
no law of their own law in all the world but they that dwell in those
hills / and yet they pay trybute for their land to the queen of Armony. And
sometime it is so that some of the Jews go over the hills / but many men may
not pass there together for the hills are so great and so high. Nevertheless
men say in that country there by that in the time of Antecryste they shall do
much harm to christian men / and therefore all the Jews that dwell in diverse
parties of the world lere for to speak Ebrewe / for they hope that the Jews
that dwell among the hills aforsayd shall come out of the hills and they
speak all Ebrewe and not else / and than shall these Jews speak Ebrewe to
them and led them in to crystendome for to destroy christian men. For these
Jews say they wot by their prophecyes yt those Jews yt are among those
hills of Caspye shall come out and christian men shall be in their subgecco^n as
they be under christian men. And if ye will wete how they shall find the passage
out as I have un derstande I shall tell you. In time of Antecryll a fox shall
make his den in the same place where king Alexander did make the gates and
he shall dygge in the earth so long till he perce it through unto that he come
among the Jews. And when they see this fox they shall have great marvel of
him / for they saw never such be / for other beestes have they among
them many / and they shall chase this fox and pursue him unto that he be
fled again in to his hole that he came fro. And than shall they dygge after
as he went unto they come to the gates yt Alexander did make of great stones
well dyght with syment / and they shall (...) these gates and so shall they
find the issue.

Of the land of Bactry and of many gryffons and other beestes. ca. lxxxv.
FRom this land men shall go unto the land of Bactry where are many wicked
men and fell. In that land are trees yt bear wolle as it were sheep of which
they make clothe. In this land are many Ypotaynes that dwell sometime on land
/ sometime on water and are half man and half horse / and they ete not but men
when they may get them. In this land are many gryffons mo re than in other
places / and some say they have the body before as an egle and behind as a
lion / and they say soth for they are made so / but the gryffon has a body
gretter than. viij. lions and gretter and stal worthyer than an hundred egles.
For certainly he will bear to his nest fleing an horse and a man upon his back
or two oxen yocked samen as they go at plough / for he has long nails on his
feet and great as it were horns of oxen / and of those they make cups there
to drink of / and of his rybbes they make bows to shote.

Of the way for to go to prester Iohans land which is Emperor of Ynde. ca.
lxxxvi.
ARo this land of Bactry men goo many a days Journey to the land of prester
John that is a great Emperor of Ynde / and men call his land the isle of
Pantoxore. This Emperor prester Johan holds great lands and many good
cytees and good towns in his kingdom / many great yles and large. For this
land of Ynde is all depar ted in yles by cause of great flodes that come out
of Paradyse / and also in the sea are many great yles. The best cite that is in
the isle of Pantoxore is call led Nyse / for that is a noble cite and rich.
Prester Johan has under him many kings and many die uerse people / and his
land is good and rich but not so rich as the land of the great Chane / for
merchants come not so much thither as they do in to the land of the great
Chane for it is to lon ge a way. And also they find in the isle of Cathay all
that they have need of / as spycery clothes of gold and other richesse. And
all if they might have better chepe in the land of preester Johan than in the
land of Cathay and more fyner / nevertheless they would let it for the long
way and great peryls in the sea / for there are many places in the sea where
are great Roches of a stone that is called adamande / the which of his own
kind draws to him iron / and for as much that there should pass no ship
that had nails of iron for it should draw it to him / therefore they dare not
wend in to that country with ships for dread of adamandes. I went ones in
that see and sa we as long as it had been a great isle of trees and stocks and
branches growing / and the shypman said to me that those was of great ships
that were dwelling there thorugh the virtue of the adamandes and of things
that were in the ships were those trees sprongen and waxen / and such Roches
are there many in diverse places of that see and therefore dare no shypman pass
that way. And an other also that they dread the long way / and therefore they
goo most all to Cathay and that is nerer unto them. And yet is it not so nere
but them behooves fro Venys or fro Geene be in see toward Cathay. xi. or.
xij. months. The land of prester John is long and marchau^ts pass thither
thorugh the land of Persy* and come unto a Cite that men call Hermes / for a
phylosophre that men called Hermes founded it / and they pass an arm of the sea and come to an other cite that men call Saboth and there find they all
marchau^dyses and popyniayes as great plente as larkes in our cou^ tree. In
this country is little whete or barley and therefore they ete rise and milk
and chese and other fruytes. This Emperor priest Johan weddeth commonly the
daughter of the great Chane / and the great Chane his daughter. In the land of
prester John is many diverse things and many precious stones so great and so
large that they make of them vessels platers and cups and many other things
of which it were to long to tell / but somewhat of his law and of his faith
shall I tell you.

Of the faith and believe of prester Johan / but he has not all ye full believe
as we have. ca. lxxxvij.
THis Emperor prester Johan is christian and a great part of his land also /
but they ha ue not all the artycles of our faith / but they believe well in the
fader and the sone and the holy ghost and they are full devout and true one to
an other / and they make no force of catell / and he has under him. lxxij.
prouynces and countries and in echone is a king / and those kings have other
kings under them. And in this land are many meruayles / for in that land is
the grauelly see yt is of sonde and of gravel and no drope of water / and it
ebbeth and flows with right great wawes as an other see does and it is never
still ne never in rest and no man may pass that land beyond it. And all if
it so be that there is no water in yt see / yet men may fy^de there in right
good fysshe and of other facyon and shape than is in any other sees / and also
they are of full good savor and sweet and good to ete. And at three Iourneys
fro that see are great hills through whi che renneth a great flood that comes
fro Parady se and it is full of precious stones and no drope of water / and it
renneth with great wawes in to the gra uelly see. And this flood renneth three
days in the weke so fast and stereth great stones of the roches with him that
make much noise / and as soon as they come in to the grauelly see they are
no more seen / and in those three days when it renneth thus no man dare come in
it / but the other days men may go therein where they will. And also beyond yt
flood toward the wilderness is a great plain all sondy and grauelly among
hills / and in yt plain gro we trees that at the rysynge of the son each
day begin to grow / and so grow they to myddaye and bear fruytes but no
man dare ete of yt fruit / for it is a manner of iron / and after myddaye it
turned again in to the earth / so yt when t e son gooth down it is no
thing seen / and so does it every day And there is in yt wilderness many
wild men with horns on their hedes and right hydeous / and they speak not but
grunt as swyne. And in that country are many popyniayes that they call in
their lan gage pystak and they speak through their own kind as apertly as a
man / and those that speak well ha ue long tongues and large and on every foot
five toos. there are some that have but three toos and tho same speak naught or
very little.

How the Emperor preester Johan when he goth to battle has three crosses
borne before him of fine gold. ca. lxxxviij.
THis Emperor preester Johan when he gooth to battle he has no baner borne
before him / but he has born before hy^ three crosses of fine gold and those
are great and large and well dyght with precious stones / and for to keep each
cross is ordained a thousand men of arms and mo than an hundred thousand on
foot in manner as men ke pe a standarde in battle in other places and he has
men without nombre when he goth to any battle against any other lord. And when
he has no battle but rydeth with preuy company than does he bear before him
but a cross of tree not painted and without gold and precious stones and all
plain in token yt our lord Inu christ suffered death on a cross of tree. And
also he has born before him a plate of gold full of earth in token that his
lordshyp and nobley shall torn to naught and his flesh shall torn to earth.
And also he has borne before him an other vessel full of Iewellys and gold
and precious stones in token of his nobley and his might.

Of the most dwelling place of prester John in a cite called Suse. ca. lxxxix.
ANd he dwelled commonly at the cite of Su se and there is his pryncypall palace
that is so rich that marvel is to tell / and above the pryn cypall toure of
the palace are two pomels of gol de all round / and each one of those has two
carbu^cles great and large yt shine right clear on the night And the pryncypall
gates of this palace are of pre cyous stones that men call Sardyn / and the
borders of the bars are of yuory / and the wyndowes of the halle and chambres
are of crystal. And tables that they ete of some are of Emeraudes some are of
mastyk some of gold and precious stones / and the pylers that bear the tables
are of such stones also and the greces on which the Emperor goth to his see
where he sytteth at mete one is of mastyk an other of crystal an other of
Iaspy grene an other of dyasper an other of sardyn an other of cormlyn a another
of sempton / and that he sets his foot up on is of crysolytes and all these
greces are bordured with fine gold and well dyght with great perles and other
precious stones / and the sides of his sege are emeraudes bordured with gold
and with precy^us stones / the pylers in his chamber are of fine gold with
many carbuncles and other such stones that give great light on the night / and
all if the carbuncles give great light nevertheless there bren neth each night.
xij. great vessels of crystal full of bame to give good smell and to drive
away wicked air. The form of his bed is all of sa phyre well bound with
gold to make him to sleep well and for to destroy lechery / for he will not
lie by his wives but thryes in the year after the sesons and all only for
getynge of children. And he has also a fair palace at the cite of Nyse where
he dwells when he will but the air there is not so well tempred as it is at
the cite of Suse. And he has every day in his course more than. xxx.
thousand men without comers and goers / but. xxx. thousand there and in the
country of the great Chane spend not so much as. xij. thousand in our
country / he has evermore. vij. kings in his court to serve him / and echone
of them serves a month and with these kings serve always. lxxij. dukes and.
CCC. earls / and every day ete in his court. xij. archebysshops and. xx.
bishops. The patryarke of saint Thomas is as he were a pope / and
archebysshops and bishops and abbottes all are kings in yt country / and
some of the lords is master of yc halle some of yc chamber / some steward /
some marshall and some other officers and therefore he is full rychely served /
and his land lasts in bread four months Journey / and it is of length
without mesure.

Of a rich man in prester John land named Catolonabes and of his gardeyne.
ca. lxxxx.
IN an isle of prester Iohans land that men call Myscorach and therein is great
plente of goods and much riches and many precious stones In that land was a
rich man not long agone that men called there Catolonabes / he was full rich
and he had a fair castle on an hylle and strong / and he had made a wall
all about the hylle right strong and fair within that he had a fair gardeyne
wherein were many trees berynge all ma ner of fruytes yt he might find / and he
did plant therein all manner of herbs of good smell and that ba re flowers /
and there was many fair wells and by them was made many fair halles and
chambres well dyght with gold and asure / and he had made there diverse
stories and beestes and birds yt song and turned by engyne and orbage as they
had be all quycke / and he had in his gardeyne that he might find to make a
man solace and comfort / and he had also there in that gardeyne maidens with in
the age of. xv. year the fairest that he might find and men childern of the
same age / and they were cladde with clothes of gold and he said that the same
were angels / and he had do make three hills fair and good all enclosed about
with precious stones of ^aspye and crystal and well bound with gold and
perles and other manner of stones / and he had made a conduyte under the earth
so yt when he ^olde the walls ran sometime with milk sometime with wine
sometime with honey / and this place is called Paradyse. And when any young
bachelere of that country knight or squire comes to him for solace and
dysporte / he ledeth him in to his Paradyse and showed unto him all these
diverse things / and diverse songs of birds and also of his damoysels and
his wells / and he did stryke diverse Instruments of musyke in an high
toure that might be seen and said those were angels of god / and that place was
Paradyse that god has granted to tho se that byleued when he said. Dabo vo^is
terra^ fluente^ lac et mel. That is to say. I shall give you land flowynge
milk and honey. And than this rich man did these men drink a manner of dryn
ke of which they were dronken and he said to them if they would deye for his
sake that when they we re deed they should come in to his Paradyse / and they
should be of the age of those maidens and shol de dwell always with them /
and he should put them in a fair Paradyse where they should see god in his
Joy and in his mageste / and than they granted to do what he would / and he
badde them go and slay such a lord or a man of the country that he was
wroth with / and that they should have no dre de of no man / and if they were
slain themself for his sake he should put them in his Paradyse when they were
deed. And so went those bachelors to slay great lords of the country / and
were slain themself in hope to have that Paradyse / and thus he was avenged of
his enemies thorugh his deserte. And when rich men of the country perceived
this malice and cautele and the will of this Catolonabes they gadred them
together and assailed the castle and slew him and destroyed all his goods and
his fair places and richesse that were in his Paradyse / the place of the
walls is there yet and some other things / but richesse is not there and it
is not long ago sith he was destroyed.

Of a meruaylous vale that is beside the river of Physon. ca. lxxxxi.
ANd a little fro that place on the lift side beside the River of Physon is a
great marvel. There is a vale between two hills and that is four mile long
/ and some men call it the valey enchau^ted / some the valey of deuylles /
same the valey peryllous / and in that valey are many tempests and a great
noise and hydeous every day and night / and sometime as it were a noise of
Taburynes of nakers and of trompettes as it were at a great fest. This valey is
all full of deuylles and has been always / and men say there yt it is an enter
to hell. In this valey is much gold and

and reasonable and many christian men among them that are full rich / and the
water between the land of prester Johan and this isle is not full deep for men
may see the ground in many places.

Of two other yles one is called Orell / and yt other Argete where are many
gold mines. ca. C. I.
THere are more estwarde two other yles the one is called Orell / and the other
Argete of whom all the land is mine of gold and silver. In those yles may men
see no sterres clear shynynge / but one sterre yt is called Canapos / and there
may not men see the moon but in the last quarter. In yt isle is a great hylle of
gold yt pyssmyres keep and they do the fine gold from the other yt is not
fine gold / and the pyssmyres are as great as hou^des so that no man dare come
there for dread of pyssmyres yt shol de assail them so yt men may not work
in that gold ne get thereof but by subtylte / and therefore when it is right
hot the pyssmyres hyde them in the earth from vndern to none of the day /
and than men of the country take camels and dromedaryes and other bestes and
go thither and charge them with gold and go away fast or the pyssmyres come
out of the earth. And other times when it is not so hot yt the pyssmyres hyde
them not they take meres yt have foles / and they lay upon these meres two
long vessels as it were two small barelles and the mouth vpwardes and drive
them thither and hold their foles at home / and when the pyssmyres seen these
vessels / they spring therein for they have of kind to leave no hole nor pytte
open / and anon fylle these vessels of gold / and when men trow yt the
vessels are full they take the foles and bring them as nere as they dare and
they whyne / and the meres here they^ and anon they come to their foles / and
so men take the gold / for these pyssmyres will suffer beestes for to go
among them but no men.

Of the derke country and hills and roches of st^ne nyghe to the paradyse
terrestre. ca. C. ij.
Beyond the yles of the land of prester Johan and his lordshyp of wyldernes
to go right eest men shall not find but hills great roches and other myrke
land where no man may see a day nor night as men of the country say / and
this wyldernes and myrke land lasts to paradyse terrestre where Adam and Eve
were set / but they were there but a little while / and yt is toward the
eest at beginning of the earth / but yt is not our eest that we call where
the son ryseth in those countries toward paradyse / and than it is mydnyght
in our country for the rou^denesse of the earth / for our lord made the earth
all round in mids of the fyrmament. Of paradyse can I not speak properly /
for I have not be there and yt angreth me / but yt I have herd I shall say
you. Men say that paradyse terrestre is the highest land of the world / and
it is so high yt it touches nere to the cercle of the moon for it is so high
yt Noes flood might not come there to the which covered all the earth about.

A little of paradyse terrrestre. ca. C. iij.
THis paradyse terrestre is enclosed all about with a wall / and yt wall is all
covered with moss as it seems yt men may see no stone ne no thing ^ls whereof
it is / and the highest place of paradyse in the mids of it is a well yt
casts out the four floodes yt run through diverse lands. The first flood
is called Physon or Ganges and that renneth through Ynde / in yt river are many
precious stones and much lignu^ aloes / and gravel of gold. An other is
called Nylus or Gyron and yt rennth through Ethio pe and Egypt. The third is
called Tygre and that renneth through Assyry and Armony the great. And the
fourth is called Eufrates that renneth through Armony and Persy / and men say
that all the sweet and fresshe waters of the world take their spryn gynge of
them. The first river is called Physon that is to say a gaderynge of many
ryuers togy der and fall in to that river / and some call it Began ges for a
king yt was in Ynde yt men called Gangeras for it renneth through his land. And
this river is in some places clear in some places trouble in some place hot in
some place told. The secon de river is called Nylus or Gyron / for it is ever
trouble / for Gyron is to say trouble. The third river is called Tygrys / yt
is to say fast rennynge for it renneth faster than any of the other / and so
is a best that men call Tygrys for he renneth fast. The fourth river is called
Eufrates / yt is to say well bre^nynge / for there grows many good thyn ges
upon yt river. And ye shall understand that no man living may go unto yt
paradyse / for by lon de he may not go for wild beestes which are in the
wyldernes / and for hills and roches where noman may pass. Ne by those ryuers
may no man pass for they come with so great course and so great wawes yt no ship
may go ne sail against them. Many gre te lords have assayed many times to go
by those Ryuers to paradyse / but they might not speed in their way / for some
deyed for werynes of rowing / some wexe blind and some deef for noise of the
waters so noman may pass there but through specyal grace of god / and for I can
tell you no more of yt place I shall say you of that I have seen.

How prester Iohans land lies foot against foot to England. ca. C. iiij.
IN this yles of the land of prester Johan and they are under the earth to us
/ and other yles are there who so would pursue them for to enuyron the earth
who so had grace of god to hold ye way he might come right to the same
countries y^ he we re come of and come fro and so go about the earth and for it
were to long time and also many perils to pass few men assaye to go so /
and yet it might be done / and therefore men came fro these yles to other yles
coostynge of the lordshyp of preester Johan. and men come in the coming to one
isle yt men call Cassoy / and that country is nere.lx. Iourneys long and more
than.l. of bread yt is the best land that is in those countries save Cathay /
and if merchants came thither as commonly as they do unto Cathay it should be
better than Cathay / for it is so thycke of cytees and towns yt when a man
goth out of a cy te he sees anon another on each side / there is gre te
plente of spyces and other goods. The king of this isle is full rich and
mighty and he holds his land of the great Chane for that is one of the.xij.
prouynces that the great Chane has under him without his own land.

Of the kingdom of Ryboth. ca. C. v.
FRo this isle men go to an other kingdom y^ men call Ryboth / and that is also
under the great Chane / this is a good country and plenteuous of corn wine
and other things / men of this land have none houses / but they dwell in
tents made of tree. And the pryncypall cite of that country is all black
made of black stones and white / and all the streets are paued with such
stones / and in yt cite is no man so hardy to spyll blood of man ne be for
worship of a mawmet that is worshyped there In that cite dwelled the pope of
their law yt they call Lobassy and he gives all dygnytees and benefyces yt
fall to the mawmet. And men of relygyon and men that have chirches in yt
country are obedyent to him as men are here to the pope. In this isle they have
a custom through all the country yt when a man's fader is deed they will do him
great worship / they send after all his friends relygyous prestes and other
many / and they bear the body to an hylle with great Joy and myrthe / and when
it is thet the grettest prelate smyteth of his heed and lays it upon a great
plate of gold or silver and he gives it to his sone / and the sone takes it
to his other friends singing and saying many orysons / and than the prestes
and the relygyous cut the flesh of the body in pieces and say orysons / and
the birds of the country come thither / for they know well the custo me / and
they fly above them as they were egles and other birds yt ete flesh. And
the priests cast the pieces unto them / and they bear it away a little from
thens and than they ete it / and as priests in our cou^ tree sing for souls
Subuenite sancti dei and so forth. So those prestes there sing with high voice
in their langage in this manner wise. Se and behol de how good and gracyous a
man this was yt the angels of god come for to fette him and bear him into
paradyse. And than thinks the sone of the same man yt he is greatly worshypped
when birds have eten his fader / and where are most plente of birds there is
most worship. And than comes the sone home with all his friends and makes
them a great feast / and the sone makes clean his faders heed and gives
them drink thereof / and the flesh of ye heed he cutted of and gives it to
his most special fren des some a little and some a little for deynte. And in
remembrance of this holy man that the birds have eten / and of the scalpe of
the heed the sone does make a cup and thereof drynketh he all his life in
remembrance of his fader.

Of a rich man which is another king prince duke nor earl. ca. C. vi.
ANd from thens to go.x. Iourneys through the land of the great Chane is a full
good isle and a great kingdom / and the king is full mighty And in this isle is a
rich man which is nor king prince duke nor earl / but he has each year. CCC.
thousand horses charged with ryce and corn / and he has a noble and a rich
life after the manner of the country / for he has.l. damoysels that serve him
every day at his mete and bed and do what he will And when he sytteth at the
table they bring hy^ mete / and at each time five meases together / and they

speak properly of them. Also in countries where I have been are many
meruaylles yt I spoke not of for it were to long tale / and therefore hold you
pay de at this time yt I have said / for I will say no more of meruaylles that
are there / ^o that other men that go thither may find enough for to say that
I have not told.

What time Johan Maundeuyll departed out of England. ca. C. ix.
ANd I Johan Mau^deuyll that went out of my country and passed the sea the
year of our lord a. M. CCC. xxxij. and I have passed through many lands and
yles and countries / and now a^ come to rest I have compyled this book and do
write it the year of our lord. M. CCC. lxvi. at. xxxiij. year after my
departing fro my country / and for as much as many men believe not but that
they se with their eyes or yt they may conceive in their kyndly wit /
therefore I made my way to Rome in my coming homewarde to show my book to the
holy fader the pope and tell him of the meruayles yt I had seen in diverse
countries so yt he with his wise counsel would examyne it with diverse folk
that are at Rome for there dwell men of all nacyons ^f the world / and a
little time after when he and his o^eyll had examyned it all thorugh / he said
to (...) for certain yt all was true / for he said he had a book of latin
that contained all that and much more of the which the Mapa mu^di is made /
the which book I ^we / and therefore our holy fader the pope has (...) and
confermed my book in all ^oyntes. And I pray to all those yt read this book
that they will pray for me and I shall pray for them / and all those that
say for me a Pater noster and an Aue maria yt god forgive me my sins. I make
them parteners and grant them part of all my good pylgrymages and other
good deeds whi che I ever did or shall do to my lives end / and I pray to
god of whom all grace comes that he will all the reders and (...) that are
(...) fulfill of his grace / and save them (...) (...) (...) and bring them
to his Joy that ever shall last he that is in the (...) (...) / (...) / and
holy ghoost that lives and regneth god without end (...).
