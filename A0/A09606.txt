Philogamus
Give place ye Poets fine
bow down now and incline
For now ye Muses nine
So Sacred and Divine
In Parnase holy Hill
^aue wrought their worthy will
and by their goodly skyll
^ppon that mighty Mountain
(...) Hellycons Fountain
That always does remain
^ynce Pegase made it flow
^s by your books we know)
Have washed the lyppes of one
That slepte not long agone
That forked Hill upon
Who after that anon
As he had seen the Muses
New Poetry he uses
And yours he clean refuses.
For wakyng suddenly
He wrote right wortheily
Such kind of Poetrye
As never one of you
Had heard or seen till now
He wrote I tell you plain
An Antygraphe full main
None such on this side Spain
Antipus to suppress
And clerly to compesse
Wherein he fayneth no less
But that if God were dead
He might be raised in Bread
Wherefore ye Poets al
And clerks both great and small
Submyt your selves ye shall
And down before him fall
And never not to rise
For you cowlde not deuyse
So great an interpryse
As this new poet did
Whose connyng is yet hyd
And many other works
That secretly yet lurckes
None such among the Turks
Nor Saracens can be found
The Gospellers to confound.
His works are so well bownd
And builded on such ground
As cannot well decay
Till the sand be washed away.
He is skylled so wonderously
In the science of Masonrye.
Wherefore I will not spare
His learning to declare
Although with myckle care
Because I want the ways
This Poet for to praise
And fame upon him raise
That flows in these days,
With such exceadynge Eloquence
And Superfluous Sapyence
Imbute wtyh Insuffycyence
Of learning and Intellygence
Whose wrytynges are laudable
So new found and not able
I tell you without fable
That no man under sky
Can praise them worthily
They show them selves so fayer
That none can them appayer
And therefore now behold
And see how well he could
Describe them that are bold
To marry being sworn
To keep them chaste beforne
Making their vow a scorn
And taking to them wives,
With them to lead their lives
But with these blooddes he stryues
And out of town them dryues
With eloquent taxacions
And vyolent vexacyons
And earneste exprobracyons
With instant insultacions
And strange denomynacyons
That none among all nacyons*
Can show such learned fasshyons
As can this noble scholar
He may well wear a collar
Of. H. for his humanitee
And for his great Urbanytye
He may wear upon his Bonnet
A double. P. well set
And with a traye above
In tokenynge of the love
That toward him he bears
Which men to Chastenes swears.
Wherefore look up and see
If ye believe not me
Your own Judges to be
For easily may ye spy
If ye look earnestly
And well his latten try
That out of Barbarye
His learning he has fett
And all his Knowledge get.
For this I dare well Swear
Here can no such fine gear
Be had but only theare,
Advise it well and read
For here it does succeed.
O Insensati
All married preistes that be Nuyti
Barbis dispuisati
Carnales hedos Uocati
Quorum deus venture
To ye belly they be bound by Inde^ture
Uentri semper obedire
Uulueque serui^e
Quorum Satan est Pater
Et ^eche^ia Matter
This Genera Uiperarum
Runs per Orbem Terrarum
O God omnipotent
Qui regnas et viuis
Send shame and punishment
To all Prestes and their wives
And let them goo void of all grace
Et in fernorum supplicia
With Lucyfer to have a Place
In sempiterna supplicia.
The Praise of the Meter.
O meter passing measure
Prouokinge sport and pleasure
O treatise of high treasure
So Typycal in figure
None such from lyn to lygure
Lapte up in such fine latin
As passes both syls and satyn
O Homer so Heroical
And Percius Satyricall
Where are your works Poetycal?
O Horace where art thou
Uyrgyll and Ouide now
And all the rest of you
Let se who dare auow
One such a work to show
No no, full well I know
Take al you on a row
Ye cannot do it I trow
Not one of you that wrote
Such Satyrs well I wot
If he your books had seen
He would have shamed them clean
You had no Peers you wene
Because with laurel grene
Crowned you were by right
But our new Poet might
Be crowned with the Uyne
And Garland Canabyue
For engyne and for wytt
The muses did admytt
Not only him to yt
But gave him so much grace
That if he vewe the face
Of one In any place
He may make him with speed
A Poet to proceed.
The proof thereof indede
Full plainly did appear
Within this half year
For one that was a Smytthe
A forger at the stytthe
A mighty man of pytthe
And strong of lym and lytthe
When he had been him with
And talked but a while
He wrote so high a style
As none within a mile
Could fashyon with a fyle
With al his wit and wyle,
Well well for all ye smyle
Certes I tell you treuth
A lack yt is great ruth
That men will not believe
The gifts that Muses give
Beside all this his Smythery
Uul^anus taught him certanly
Wherwt he wroughe right curyously
As ye may se yt euydently
Contained in the testymony
And latter will of Heresy.
For there He shows Poetry
Hyghly professyng Romery
Lo, now I say therefore
Your books we need no more
They may be rent and tore
What though ye cry and rore
We need not now your lore
For if this art were drowned
Again it may be found
Even by the very sound
Of these new Poets Tools
They be no small fools,
If they be red In schools
You may sit down on stools
And so to take your rest
As I suppose it best.
But well ye thyncke I Geyst
By cock for all your lokes
You may claspe up your books
And then go keep the roockes
Or else with hangle hooks
Go fyshe and take some flookes
For clean your clergy crookes
And goes no more on right
Since these began to wryght
Ye have no more no might
To florysh in their sight
But this I will you tell
The Mason does excel
Wherefore he may full well
Above all bear the Bell
Wherefore with all my power
I will each day and hour
Advance his high honor
Praiyng these Muses Sacre
With Hellicons Lauacre
To wash me by their aid
To do as I have said.
*The praise of the Poet.
O Poet so impudent
Which never yet was studente
To thee, the Gods prudente
Minerua is illudente
Thou wrytest things dyffuse
Incongrue* and confuse
Obfuscate and obtuse
No man the like does use
Among the Turckes or Jews
Always inuentyng news
That are incomparable
They be so fyrme and stable
Like as a Ship is able
Without Ancre and Cable
Roother Maste or Sail
Pully Rope or Nail
In Wind Weather or Hayle
To guide both top and tail
And not the course to fail
So this our Poet may
Without a stopp or stay
In cunning wend the way
As Well by dark as day
And never go astray
If yt be as they say.
O Poet rare and Recent
Dedecorate / and indecent
Insolent and insensate
Contendyng and condensate
Obtused and obturate
O bumbylate, obdurate
Sparyng no Pressed or Curate
Cyuylyan or Rurate
That be already married
And from their vow been varyed
Whereto the scripture them carried
They might as well have tarried
I swear by the north door Rood
That stowte was while he stood
That they had been as good
To have sold their best blew hood
For I am in such a mood
That for my power and part
With al my wit and art
With whole intent and heart
I will so at them Darte
That some of them shall farte
Before they feel it smarte.
Could not these bloods be pleased
With men's wives to be eased
And in their daughtars seized
As well as the other greased
Though thus they had not preased?
In faith they shall be feased
For I set to my hand
In fight with them to stand
By water and by land
By gravel and by Sand
And by the salt sea strond
Behold here is a wand
To beat them back and bone
I trow a thing alone
To make these gallantes groan
And with our poets aid
They shall be so dismayde
So fearful and afraid
That down they shall be laid,
As thycke as hoppes and hayle.
Now will I them assail
And threashe them with my Flayle
To mar these married Preistes
I fight with both my Fystes
Look on the fraye who Lystes.

ELQUIDUOS BED?
Lo now how like you this?
I trow I did you Bliss
And them, as worthy is
To dyng till they shall Piss
Me think I do not miss
Though my Crown be not scraped
Nor I in Order mysshaped
Nor for such woorshyppe gaped
Nor anoyted Preyste with Oil
Nor Cream or other Soil
Nor took such fylthy Foil
Yet will I tugge and Toil
Toss turn and Turmoyle
Cumbre Clowte and Coil
Dismembre and Dispoyle
All them that I may catch
That daily wait and watch
Feacte wenches to vpsnatche
And marrye to their Match
But I will them dispatche
And byggely on them beat
For all their wives so feacte
That are so Nyce and Neat
Which sittyng on their Seat
Of Scriptures will Entreat
And feign would us defeacte
With words grymme and great
From Beads of woodde and Geate
And from our myghtie Meat
That is, our God of wheat
Puff, so I Swelle and Sweat
I Fridge I Frothe and Freate
Of this Uncowthe to think
But suerly shall they Drink
Till above the ground they stynke
With a Lyrycum Twynke
For I can never Shrynke
As long as our Uulcanus
And lusty Longimanus
Will stick while he is Sanus
For though he be Prophanus
He is not nothing Uanus
Nor learned like Alanus
I tell you he is no Na^u^
But one of stature stout
No Lubber nor no Loute
He will reach round about
And ventyng with his snoute
Will touch them top and towte
And all their rufflyng towte
With Clarckly clubbes to cloute
For fyersly has he fought
Endeuouryng to drive out
The reader in our queare
That draws to him here
Men coming far and near
There did our Smythe appear
With countenance so clear
Full chau^geable in cheer
And dapper as a dear
Chefely he did him charge
How he had taught at large
More then he could dyscharge
Or find in text or Marge
Concerning Consecratyon
And Transubstanciation
Or all our Transmutacion
And Substance Alteracion
Deniyng Ueneracion
And also Adoration
In time of Ministration
And that Non dentibus
Panem Prementibus
Nullis Euentibus
Christum Gustari
Nec Mancipari
Posse vel de^ipi
Sensus, cum Recipi
Dabitur Panis.
Sed Smyth, I^^nanis
Abiit Inanis
But or he went away
He trymmed him I say
With goodly tantes and gaye
And with a tryggum tray
Like a fine Philologus
Or rather a Pantolobus
He called him Spermologus
And would have a Dialogus
But were there a Catalogus
Of him and al his sect
He might be chef elect
These reders to correct
For well can he object
And Subtelly suspect
In things that be dyrect
But sure if he be chect
Your corrage is deiect
And al your hope in vain
Yet still will I remain
To take for you great pain
If ye will me retain
And put my self in parrel
To fight thus in your quarrel
If thou O Poet once
That well can cowche thy stones
Or fab^^ with his mall
To me for help will call
Either with book or word
Soon will I be the third
So if I find you kind
Certes you shall me bind
To show that is behynd
Well well ye know my mind.
LO thus Philogamus
After this sort
Helps Misogamus
Him to comfort
Against Monogamus
That does report
That your Apogamus
Is but aborte.
FINIS.
