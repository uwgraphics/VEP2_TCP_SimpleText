The metynge OF DOCTOR BARONS AND doctor Powell at Paradise gate and of their
communicacion both drawn to Smithfylde from the Towar. The one burned for
Heresye as the papists do say truly and the other quartered for popery and
all within one hour.

Powel IT is seen often
that men mete now and then
but so do hills never
what wind drove the hither

Barons Demand thou wherefore
for quiet ever more
I have trauelid long therefore

Powel Why I the desire
thy reward is borning fire
thy travel was non other
but against holy churches mother

Barons Truly thou doste not say
full besy I have been
Gods word so pure and clean
as it has been well seen
to open night and day
but I have been so croppid
pollid and noppid
and so often stopped
In that my godly Iornye
ever some popish train
out of a bishops brain
did turn me back again
clean beside the way
so for the very trothe
I fasyd with many an oath
and susteyninge much wroth
my duty could not do
though Barons was my name
and had grudge and blame
rebuke disdain and shame
with sorrow care and woo
by many of the wicked
I was spornid at and kycked,
when that they were prycked
one the galde back
that they might fulfill
their popish wicked will
and so contenewe still
with malis lie and crack
they made many listes
and gave no small gifts
now little to their thriftes
by burning very long
they alleged many laws
after their own sawes
not wordy. ii. strawes
to put pore men to wrong
some pore sely sowles
were brought forth to powles
with careful heavy nowles
suffering much shame and care
some had there names
with tauntes rebukes and shame,
and constrained were with blames
fagots for to were
some in prison deep
did lie and sleep
and could not stir nor crepe
like thieves as they had been
with course barley bred
very hungerly feade
so heavy as any lead
their drink was water thin
if they had not sought a boute
friends to get them out
long else they might
in prison tarry still
and yet no cause why
that they could pacify
orells truly justify
but their malice to fulfill
for the truths sake
some they did make
their gods to forsake
some were exiled clean
many they did spill
bannyshe burn and kill
folowyg their wicked will
like thieves as they had been
some in the bishops chambere
priuelye examined were
because ye people should not co^ nere
to know what there was done
with threteninges all to mainyd
and fasinges sore blaimid
to recante they were constrained
from thens or they were gone

Powell Fie Barons thou raylest
it is not true thou faylest
to lewdly thou sayiest
in thy communication
tell some other tail
and do no longer rail
for else I will not fail
to leave the here alone.

Barons. It is your old pleying
that we do use railing
the truth when we be saying
against your noughty living
ye can not abide
your wyckednes should be spyde
or the truth should be tried
ye be thereat so biting
but God that sits on hye
to have on me mercy
if I intent to lie
or thereof will make reciting
therefore brother powell
though on popery still ye smelle
and will not that I tell
your detestable fasshion
as I am so I am
another popish nor roman
but a very christian
and that on christ's passion
for witness do I call
though bitter was my fall
I am content with all
let me my mind declare
for I will not spare
now I am past care
the truth for to say
mercy I tell the showed they none
but a way with flesh and bone
of them they cried anon
that spoke against their will
better it were they said
in yrons that he were teyd
or to the fire leyde
then our kingdom he should spyll
still about they sought
and spitfully wrought
speaking that was not thought
the truth to put to flight
with malice to much used
Iudasly they accused
the truth to be refused
was all their delyght
abroad were sent liars
of prestes and of friars
to be privy spiers
to put Gods word to wrong
who did not cease
malice to increase
and not quietness
through the ynglysh thrange
if they had remembered well
what on the Jews fell
persecuting the gospel
and the undoubted truyth
Then would they look about
and fear their popish route
in peaces should breast out
or have a great ruyth
a deuelysh mad devise
well doing to despise
naming it the newgise
as some did it call
which be the holy roode
has done much more good
to our ynglysh blood
then the old fashion all

Powell. Cease thy comunication
against the old fasshion
our catholyke tradicion
what do thou know
of bate or sedicion
of grudge or rebellyon
with in ynglysh region
that the old sort did sow
I see thou dust not fail
to Ieste and to rail
with an evil tail,
and malyciously to crow.

Barons (...) thou popish ass
shall I let pass
the prelates iniquitas
whereat totus mundus
rorith at the bisshops
with their romysh shiphookes
the popes privy cokes
I mean plainlye thus
who list to seek about
may in chronicles sone find out
what seeds the popish route
in yngland has sown
because the time is short
I shall brefely report
and wright in dew sort
them what I have known
and how manfully hardy
the fathers of the clargy
and nothing at all hardy
in lies, disdain and pride
spared no expense
nor yet daily diligence
by the preuie defense
Gods word for to hyde
A font escaped on the other side o^ this page (...) the iii. Line for dronke^
bl^^kes read d^^^kes blood (...)
^inna sinnarum is
that thou in no wyes myss
to conueye this
to the high prelates al
it is my last writing
I would they use no biting
yet open sittinge
whatsoever thereof be fall

THE LETTER OF BARONS
Full heavy I say they ought to be
for so long cloki^g of gods virtue
and to lament right bitterly
calling for mercy
that he would their eyes open
yt their stony hearts may be broken
which so long has been soken
with doctrine so fylthy
all the woorlde does now it spy
and wonderfully upon them cry
that they so long christ did deny
our only health and savior
and made us believe on stoks and stons
dronken blocks and dry bones,
to be all helpers for the nones
for our wicked behauiore
holly bred and holly water
with read letters written in paper
and to the cake as to our maker
to trust they did us teach
for the thonder to the holly bell
and at our death the holly candel
masses propiscatory they did sell
to be out helping leche
for this lords laydes and knight
they have had in great despighte
with many other that now wright
against their abhominacion
it is well known and now espied
by my blood and other that fried
in smithefild gods word has tried
their pharisis old fasshion
such as was to polles called
and in prisones cruelly scallid
for gods word and spitfully bralled
for vengeance have cried
to god who with ye prelates now has meant
for their tyranny without let
and for thyr Iuggeling and snari^g net
this cannot be denied
there is no man that now brooks
There stowte crakes and hie looks
their double hearts and fabli^g books
their pride do abate
though truth was enclosed in a wall
it is broken out and now does fall
your lordly pride brother snowbal
all these be seen of late.
Powell. Thou abominable heretic
fantastical and lunatike.
thy words mi heart do throw prick
thus to hear the rail
prate and say what thou will
the papists thereat have no skylle
they will keep their hold stylle
and thou shall not prevail
I se there is no remedy
any longer to talk with the
as thou was so will thou be
abominable heretic
as for thy letter to conueye
to my prelates stout and gaye
here I openly say the nay
and thereat trust and stycke
they will prevail when you art gone
when you and thine lamente and moan
they have to be meri it is well knoue^
no sorrow can make them sick

Barons The deuel, a lie brother powell
dust thou say but I the tell
let them live any longer to smell
and their fusty popery
they know ye law they know ye pain
they can no longer cloak nor feign
and if they do I tell the certain
their reward is plain ropery
hereof I need not much to say
you assaied ye game you know ye play
let them turn their mind a way
and strife not against the right
if ye lordly pour might ons a bate
then would they quicly open ye gate
of true doctrine which of late
king henry did bring to light
god save kig Edwards noble grace
and send his highenes time and space
to continewe forth his godly trace
by gods power and might
and send ill chaunte and crokid happes
to all such popish forked capes
that gave so many cursd slappes
for gods blissed word
so has he done it is certain
they have not won I tell the pleine
and never shall till they have agaie
the pope to be there lord

Powel The devil of hell be thy gyde
thou dust ever braule and chyde
against my sort and dust not hyde
one word less or more
thou say thou come to have rest
thou shall be the deuels geste
and herto I will do my best
thou may be sure therefore.

Finis,
Imprynted At London, at the sign of the Hill, at the west door of Paul's. By
Wyllyam Hill. And there to be sold
