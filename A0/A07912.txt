Hereford, Lord Ferrer of Chartley, Borcher, and Lovaine, Master of the Queens
Majesty's Horse, Knight of the noble order of the Garter, and one of her

RIght Honorable, knowing the tediousness of time, to be best beeguiled by
the sweetness of exercise, I have exercised the nine sweet Muses, with greedy
affection, to delight the tenth. Your Honor, is the same excelent tenth Muse,
of more in valewable worth then the other nine. To your delight, I consecrate
my duties, and offer up my nights labors for your days pleasures, and voutsafe
noble Lord, to grace the offering by your kind acceptacion, and entertain
with favor, the offerers entire devotion. In your favorable regard, consists
my safest guard, and my Muses security in your Honors satisfaction. If I
satisfy not you, I satisfy not any, although all beesids. If I content you, I
hope I shall content all, whom I am to have regard not to discontent, and
thereby I gain, which is the sweetest gain, the comfort of my labors. I
therefore right humbly beeseech your Honor, not presuming upon the worth of so
poor and base a present, but upon the worthiness of your own noble heart,
that this may rest secure under your Honorable patronage, as under privilege
of a religious Sanctuarij, commended by your ready acceptance, and defended by
your favorable countenance.

Your Honors in all duty to be commanded. John Mundy.

To the Reader.
YOu that shall reap the pleasure and delight
Of all his pain that has composd these songs,

Give pains due praise, and skill what there to longs.
So graced shall these first fruits of his skill,
Make him with stodie, seek to please you still.

Hereford, Lord Ferrer of Chartley, Borcher, and Lovaine, Master of the Queens
Majesty's Horse, Knight of the noble order of the Garter, and one of her
Majesty's most Honorable privy Council.
RIght Honorable, knowing the tediousness of time, to be best beeguiled by
the sweetness of exercise, I have exercised the nine sweet Muses, with greedy
affection, to delight the tenth. Your Honor, is the same excelent tenth Muse,
of more in valewable worth then the other nine. To your delight, I consecrate
my duties, and offer up my nights labors for your days pleasures, and
voutsafe, noble Lord, to grace the offering by your kind acceptacion, and
entertain with favor, the offerers entire devotion. In your favorable regard,
consists my safest guard, and my Muses security in your Honors satisfaction.
If I satisfy not you, I satisfy not any, although all beesids. If I content
you, I hope I shall content all, whom I am to have regard not to discontent,
and thereby I gain, which is the sweetest gain, the comfort of my labors. I
therefore right humbly beeseech your Honor, not presuming upon the worth of so
poor and base a present, but upon the worthiness of your own noble heart,
that this may rest secure under your Honorable patronage, as under privilege
of a religious Sanctuarij, commended by your ready acceptance, and defended by
your favorable countenance.

Your Honors in all duty to be commanded. John Mundy.
