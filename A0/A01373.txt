The end and Confession of John Felton who suffered in Paul's Churcheyeard in
London, the.viii. of August, for high Treason. 1570.
Each man desiers to have report,
of news both strange and rare:
And couits for to know those things,
whereby they may be ware.
For to avoyde those doings great,
that might on them befall:
For by example are they taught to do,
and what they shall
Receive for their malicious minds,
and wicked Treasons great:
As now of late it has been seen
through Justice judgments seat.
That holds the sword to do the right,
and strike where blows should fall:
And punish for their wicked lives,
each one whom she does call.
The poor, the ritche, the learnd, ye wise
the beggar and the snudge:
The King sometime too has it felt,
as well as has the drudge.
Wherefore be laws decreed and made
but for to punish those,
That will not by their Prince be rewld
but seems to be their foes.
As now is seen by Felton lo,
that lately here did die,
In Paul's Churchyard he left his life,
on Galows taule and hie.
Who from the prison where he lay,
was drawn on Hardell there:
For good example of all such,
that they might take the fear.
For to beware of such like fact,
as well in word as deed:
Least they for their like hier at last
no better like to speed.
* Now mark his end and what I shall
report here of his death:
For why these ears of mine did here,
and iyes while that his breath
Remained in his wicked corpse,
which stubbornly did die:
As one me thought something best raught
through Treasons cruelty.
His Gown of Grograin he put of,
which on his back he had:
And eke his Doublet which was made
of Satin somewhat sad.
Into his Shirte he then was stripped,
and up the Ladder he
Did mount, for to receive that death,
that each man there might se.
These words he spoke, and said alowde
my Masters all and some:
One thing I have to say to you,
now that I here am come.
That is, I pray you all with me
bear record what I say:
I here protest before you all
, this present dieyng day,
That I was never Traitor sure,
nor Treason to my Queen
Did never do, nor never thought,
that ever has been seen.
And for the fact wherefore I die,
I can it not deny:
But at the Gate where as the Bull
was hanged, there was I,
In company, on more with me,
did hang it up together:
And though in place, I had not bin,
it had not escaped ever.
From hanging up, for suredly,
for that same present day:
It had bin hanged, in that place,
though I had been away.
Then said the Shreue, unto him,
Oh Felton do remember:
That thou have bin, a Traitor great
and to the Queen offender.
And surely thou most Traitorously,
and stubbornly have thou sought,
The best thou could to go about,
thy Prince to bring to naught.
And eke the Realm and all the rest,
as mutche as in thee lay,
Thou soughst by thy Traitorous heart,
to bring unto decay.
Therefore call unto God the Lord,
and pray him from thy heart:
That he receive thy soul to rest,
when thou from hence shall part.
Well so I do, and here I crave,
you all good people pray
For me, that ready is to dye,
and then began to say,
Into thy hands, Oh Lord my God,
I yield my Soul and Breath:
For thou have me redeemd, I say,
with thy most precious death.
In manus tuas Domine,
and so the rest he said,
The Hangman then did throw him of,
and so his breath was staide.
He hanged theare upon the Tree,
and in a little space:
They cut him down incontinent,
that Justice might take place.
Where as he quartred should be,
according to the Law:
And to the Judgment that he had,
to make those stand in awe.
That be of his affinity:
and surely there be some,
That thinks that he deserude not death
in all that he has don.
He then dismembered was straight way,
when he had ended that:
His Belly ripped open wide,
his Bowels all he gat.
And to the fire he straight them threw,
which ready there was made:
And there consumed all to dust,
as is the fires trade.
His Head cut of, the Hangman then,
did take it up in hand:
And up alofte he did it show,
to all that there did stand.
And then his body in Four parts,
was quartred in that place:
More pity that his Traytorous Heart,
could take no better grace.
And thus he had his just desarte,
as well he had deserved:
I would the rest that not repents,
were likewise also served.
Beware you Papists all beware,
be true unto your Queen:
Let not your Traitorous hearts be bent
as here tofore has been.
Stand not against the living God,
spurn not against his Law:
Kick not against the Prick I say,
but have him still in awe.
Be not ashamde to torn in time,
set shamefastness aside:
No shame it is to turn to God,
though you have gone far wide,
The farther you have gone astray,
and wicked ways has led,
The ernester you should return,
from that most wicked Bed,
Wherein you lay a sleep long while,
forgetting of his grace:
Now call the refore unto the Lord,
to set you in that place,
Where you may have eternal rest,
and live in heaven hie:
And rest in Abraham's bosom too,
when that you needs must dye.
And for that grace that God may give,
as I have said before:
I humbly pray continually,
both now and evermore.
Our Prince, our Queen Elizabeth,
a happy state to have:
Let us all pray with one accord,
her noble grace to save.
And her to keep from all her foes,
and shield eternally:
From wicked wights that go about,
to seek continually:
Her whole decay: the Lord defend,
her noble royal heart:
From yielding to those Foes of hirs,
that daily plays their part.
For to be reeue her of her right,
and of her stately Crown:
All those (I say) that so does seek,
God shortly throw them down.
Thus here I end, and once again,
the living God I pray:
Our noble Queen Elizabeth,
preserve both night and day.
