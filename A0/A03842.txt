CAPTAIN HVMES Poetical Music.

Principally made for two Basse-Viols, yet so contrived, that it may be played
8. several ways upon sundry Instruments with much facility.

1 The first way or music is for one Bass-Viole to play alone in parts, which
stands always on the right side of this Book. 2 The second music is for
two Basse-Viols to play together. 3 The third music, for three Basse-Viols to
play together. 4 The fourth music, for two Tenor Viols and a Basse-Viole. 5
The fifth music, for two Lutes and a Basse-Viole. 6 The sixth music, for two
Orpherions and a Basse-Viole. 7 The seventh music, to use the voice to some
of these musicks, but especially to the three Basse-Viols, or to the two
Orpherions with one Basse-Viole to play the ground. 8 The eight and last
music, is consorting all these Instruments together with the Virginals, or
rather with a wind Instrument and the voice
Composed by Tobias Hume Gentleman.

Always thus to the Reader.
I Do not study Eloquence, or profess Music, although J do love Sense,
and affect Harmony. My Profession being, as my Education has been, Arms,
the only effeminate part of me, has been Music; which in me has been
always Generous, because never Mercenarie. To praise Music, were to say, the
Sun is bright. To extol my sefe, would name my labors vainglorious. Only
this, my studies are far from servile imitations, I rob no others inventions,
I take no Jtalian Note to an English Dittie, or filch fragments of Songs to
stuff out my volumes. These are mine own Phansies expressed by my proper
Genius, which if thou do dislike, let me see thine, Capere vel noli nostra,
vel ede tua, Now to use a modest shortness, and a brief expression of my self
to all noble spirits, thus, My Title expresses my books Contents, which (if
my hopes fail me not) shall not deceive their expectation, in whose
approuement, the crown of my labors rests. And from henceforth, the
statefull instrument Gambo Violl, shall with ease yield full various and
deuicefull Music as any other instrument. For here J protest the Trinity of
Music, parts, Passion and Division, to be as gracefully united in the Gambo
Violl, as in the most received Instrument that is, which here with a Soldiers
Resolution, I give up to the acceptance of all noble dispositions.

The friend of his friend, Tobias Hume.


Your Viols must be tuned as the Lute, being the best Set that ever was
invented, for these kind of Musickes, which may be compared with the highest
and curious music in the world.

TO THE RIGHT VVORthely innobled, PHILIP Earl of Arundel, etc.
AS great men have many cares to hinder their delights, so have they much
choice of delights to sweeten their cares. Among which more elected and almost
divine pleasures, Humanity must needs give Music a supreme worth: which
ever allowed truth gives me heart to hope that your right noble spirit will
esteem it no il-fitting complement, to receive these few musical Essaies
from him who ever deuotes his utmost indeauors to the deserving of your
happy-making favor. I shall therefore in these only protest my willingness to
do your Honor the readiest and choicest service my studies can affoard: which
humblest tender, if it may obtain acceptance, my labors are happy, and my
self in my largest hopes amply satisfied. Of which, I cannot despair, since I
know Heroicke spirits are as far from contempt as from baseness.

The servant of your noble virtues, Tobias Hume.

^VVhat greater grief ^ ^ ^

^WHat greater grief ^ ^

^WHat greater grief then no relief in deepest woe ^ ^death is no friend that
will not end such hearts sorrow help I do cry, no help is nie, but wind ^
^and air, which to and fro do toss and blow all to despair, since then
despair I must yet may not ^ ^die no man vnhapier lives on earth then I. ^

It Is I that feel the scornful heel of dismal hate,
My gain is lost, my loss clear cost repentance late,
So I must moan bemonde of none, O bitter gal!
Death be my friend with speed to end and quiet all.
But if thou linger in despair to leave me,
I Will kill despair with hope, and so deceive thee.
