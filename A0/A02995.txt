obtained a^ain^^ the Duke de Maine, and the Romish Revels in his kingdom, upon
Ashwednesday being the fourth day of March last past. 1590.
To the tune of the new Tantara. God save the King.


TRiumph good Christians and rejoice,
This wondrous news to hear:
Wherein the power of mighty Jove,
So greatly does appear.
God is the stay and strength of those
That in him puts his trust:
And what he ever promiste them,
He keeps firm and just.
Let canons rore and Muskets shoot,
Let Fife and Ensigns play:
Let Trumpets shrill and dubbing drums,
Sound forth this joyful day.
Who knows not how the Duke de Maine,
By title from the Gwize,
Has sought to rule (...) in France.
^
All ioinde themselves in battle ray.
Upon firm land in France,
Entending to have slain the king,
Yet had a worser chance.
Let canons rore and Muskets shoot etc.
Whereby the enemy was that time,
Full thirty thousand strong:
The king his power was but weak,
To right his open wrong.
He had not past ten thousand men,
In his defense to fight,
Which was great ods as all men knows,
To put all these to flight.
Let canons rore (...) shoot etc.
In valiant sort he cheerd his men,
And lovingly he said:
God is with us, our quarrels good,
Be therefore not dismaide.
My trust is still that as the Lord,
Has me before defended:
So he will fight against my foes,
That have my death pretended.
Let canons rore and Muskets shoot etc.
My quarrel does pertain to God.
In whom I put my trust:
And in the promise he has made,
I know he will be just.
Be valiant now and fight like men,
And God will be your guide:
And I with you will spend my blood,
And not once step aside.
Let canons rore and Muskets shoot etc.
To ^ther then the Armies went,
Which made a wondrous shoe:
On either side they fought full fierce,
Each sought the others woe.
The Canons roard and Muskets shot,
And made a warlike noies:
Their Trompets sound and dubbing dru^s,
Encreaste the soldiers ioies.
Let canons rore and Muskets shoot etc.
The Fife m^de warlike melody,
The ensigns were displaied:
Oh either side they curredge cride.
The king was not dismayed.
But like a Soldier and a king,
A standard he did take:
And slew the man that bare the same,
Which made his enemies quake.
Let canons rore and Muskets shoot etc.
The Duke de Maine for all his power.
Was forste from field to fly:
His heels were better then his hands,
He fought so valiauntly.
His power was stricken with such fear,
That they did fly in haste:
Whereby the king did win the field,
His enemies were disgraste.
Let canons rore and Muskets shoot etc.
He and his power did follow them,
Full five hours in the chase:
From eight at morn til toward night.
He fought in the enemies face.
This victory he did obtain,
Such was his good succes,
And many thousand enemies slain,
Report says sure no les.
Let canons rore and Muskets shoot etc.
What tents and furniture for war,
What treasure and jewels rich:
Hereby the king and soldiers got,
You may suppose was miche.
And prisoners taken of account,
As you shall: shortly here,
Who for their reason to their king,
I think will pay full dear.
Let canons rore and Muskets shoot etc.
See here the handy work of God,
Who harmles saude the king.
And sent him treasure in great store,
And every warlike thing.
