Paul's Church: at the sign of the Gun. 1599.

To the Right Worshipful Master Robert Carey Esquire, Robert Green wishes
increase of all honorable virtues.
ENnius (Right Worshipful) had a Maecenas, though his verses were rude, and
Hippocrates durst present his pictures though they were rough. The blindest
Bayard has a reason to shadow his presumption: for says he, will is above
skill. Soothing my self (right Worshipful) with their humors, having
attempted to frame out an ORPHARION, to harsh to make a concord in any cunning
ear: yet with old Ennius doting in my youth as he did in his age: I do
presume to present my rural Instrument under the shadow of your patronage, and
the rather for that as the poor Cobbler durst prefer his chattring Pie to
Augustus, for that the Emperor was affable and courteous, so hearing your
Worship to be endued with such honorable virtues and plausible qualities, as
draws men to admire and love such united perfection: I embolden my self to
trust upon your Worships courteous acceptance, which if it be such as others
have found and I hoped for, and that any way this Orpharion may agree with the
daintines of your touch and fingering, the end of my labors and the sum of
my desires consort in one sympathy, and in that hope, I commit your Worship to
the Almighty.

Your Worships humbly to command, To. Green.

To the Gentlemen Readers Health.
GEntlemen, I have long promised my Orpharion, and because I would not
frustrate your expectation: at last it is leapt into the Stacioners Shop, but
not from my Study, for then might you think I had sweld with the mountains,
and brought forth a Mouce, but the Printer had it long since* marry whether
his press were out of tune, Paper dear, or some other secret delay drive it
off, it has line this twelve months in the suds. Now at last it is crept forth
in the Spring, a slender bud and easily to be nipt with the least frost of
Disdain.

Therefore do I entreat whatsoever melody my Orpharion yield: you would favor
the blossom with the Sunshine of your courteous acceptance, else shall you
discourage a Gardener for grafting any more, and therefore hoping to find you
as ever I have done, farewell.

Rob. Green.

Greenes Orpharion.
Cupid having taught me what restless passions are in love, what continual
perturbations Fancy affoordes to such as account beauty the principal end of
their affects: having received the wound, I sought where to find a salve fit
for the easing of my malady: Experience willing that I should not tie my
thoughts on delay, told me that such as were enuenomed with the Scorpion, must
be healed by the Scorpion, that the Tarantals sting could not be pulde out
without Music, that he which was pierced with Achilles Lance must be healed
by his Spear, and they which were charmed with Love, must seek to love, or
else lack remedy: Whereupon doubtful what I should do, I was willed to sue to
Venus as sovereign Goddess and patroness of such perplexed patients. I left
my home and sailed to Cipres, there found I men unknown, but not her whom I
looked for: there might I see Venus Palace like the gorgious Tower built by
Semeramus. Sloth being Porter, sleepy, and suffering free passage to all, the
gate of entrance was not the way to return: for at the other side was a door
to depart, where Beggary stood and threatened all, but struck some with his
whip of repentance: within I found Princes, great Lords and men of mean
calling, al prisoners, some fettered by the eyes, others by the ears, some by
the tongue, as having more lust in their mouth then love in their minds, none or
few cheyned by the hearts, and such as were set inthroned in a secret Cell:
those Venus shrinde up as wonders of the world, well: missing what I came for,
I past speedily from thence to Paphos, where Venus had only a Temple, thither
came multitudes on Pilgrimage, making vows, uttering oaths, and protesting
promises: if they might enjoy the fruition of their Ladies, to be sworn
votaries to the Goddess: Some were favored, others disgraced: some dispaired,
some hoped, but all found the end of their pilgrimage was to buy smoke with
many perrills and dangers: But all these instances were no arguments to
diswade me from my journey: But as Medea though I saw the best and allowed of
it, yet I followed the nearest and smarted for it, for such as be in love are
like the Dear which one while strike at the Tamarisk tree with their horns,
and then greedily burst on it with their mouths, others the people of Mamaca,
that surfeit on Dates, and yet dye with them in their mawes. Lovers exclaim
against Cupid, and yet they go on pylgrimage to Paphos, they call Venus
unjust, and yet offer her incense and sacrifice, they foresee misery, and yet
run headlong on their own misfortune. So fared it with me, for seeing these
men thus deeply passionate, and yet so slenderly rewarded, as who carried away
the greatest trophe, had his ensign stamped with repentance: yet their mishaps
could not make me learn to beware, but from Paphos I went to the fountain of
Alcidalion, where I heard Venus to avoid the heat of Summer, was kept close
Prisoner by Mars in a Pauillion, but I found the rumor false, yet did I not
repent me of my arrival, for there I saw sitting about the bancks, infinite
troops of fair and beautiful Ladies, all votaries unto Venus, smyling at the
fondness of men, and laughing at the passions of their Lovers, making true
love knots of rushes, that broke ere they could be twisted: some seemed like
Saints, those were subtle and perverse: others fawned, and those were
flatterers: some wept, and they let fall tears of deceit: some seemde to have
many eyes, and those had many fancies: some two hearts, and yet they were very
chaste: for some had twenty measuring their Loves by their looks: gazing still
upon their countenance and gesture, I perceived hard by separate from the rest
a few Ladies sitting passing solitary, their names were engraven in the
trees, but so long since as hardly I could read them, yet I found out Hero,
Penelope, Thisbe, Artemesia, alas a small number and disdained by the rest,
these had their eyes shut against beauty, and their ears open to virtue, their
hearts subject to love, but only stamped with one Carracter, resembling the
Emeraulde, that never loses the first impression nor admits any other:
well here I could neither find Venus, nor hear of her, but scoffinglie those
girls told me, she was either in Ida or in Erecinus, desirous to loose no
time, I hasted from Alcydalion to Ida, where I could see no steps of a
Goddess, but only the ancient monument of Troy consumed to cinders, there I
noted the end of love, the reward of lust, the trophes of Venus, the follies of
women in Helena, that brought Priamus his sons, and so famous a City to
confusion. From thence I posted to Erecinus, the Mountain was green and
pleasant to the eye, the stones that appeared higher then the grass seemed
like Iacinthes, the moss was flowers, the very rubbish below pearls, so ye
nature seemd to have conquered art, and art nature, and a supernatural glory
both in musing at the gorgeous situation of this divine Mount, looking if
either there were Palace or Temple dedicate to Venus, I saw none, but casting
mine eye into the bordring vale, I saw a Shepherd grasing of his flocks.
Desirous to learn of the man any news of the Goddess, pacing down from the
Hill, I went and saluted him in this manner.

Shepherd, so I name thee for thy flocks, more may thou be, for Apollo kept
Midas sheep, and Mercury taken the shape of a Heardman: but measuring thy
degree as present thou seem, I crave so much favor at thy hands, as to tell
me whether Venus is resident about this mount of Erecinus, or no, I have been
at all her places of abode, and this is the last of all her earthly mansions:
This Shephearde hearing me salute him so courteously, laying down his pipe and
his hook answered thus bluntly.

Friend, what I am it little reckes thee, thou see my fouldes, and then why
stand thou upon higher titles: In calling me shepherd or Swain, thou
give me my due, if my degree be greater, my sheep may serve for thy excuse,
to thy question: as it savors of folly, so I think best to answer it with
silence, yet for I see thy thoughts to be full of passions, and thy face the
map of sorrows, the two notes of a Lover, if I knew my counsel might profit
thee, or my experience warn thee, I would bestow a little wast time while my
Sheep grase so hard, to hold thee chat.

Hearing the Shepherd beginning so roughly, to conclude so gently, willing to
be auditor to his Country precepts, I answered him thus.

Shepherd, if thou be no better, (for thy talk makes me suspect higher, Know
that I have told many cares, numbered many passions, felt many sorrows, vttred
many sighs, shed many tears since Venus entertained me, with Roses at the
first, and afterward beat me with Nettles, I have found love to be a
Laborinth, a fury, a hell, wherein men alive feel worse pains then those
ghostes that pay Charon hier for his ferriboat: grieved thus, yet as one in a
lunacie: I never fore-sawe my miseries. I heard many counsels, and read many
preceps, but al in vain, yet for that time has many chances, the Fates their
Canons tied to opportunity. Fortune her decrees variable, and love, many
accidents: I will humbly crave what thou have offered, promising to be
attentive and not ungrateful, as far as a strangers ability may gratify.

The Shephearde without further promising or longer delay, began thus.

Thou see that I sit here feeding my flocks by Erecinus, whether daily
resort multitudes of amorous Pilgrims suing to Venus for relief of their
passions, but how she used these fond and perplexed patients, as it pitties me
to rehearse, so it will grieve thee to hear. Those youths whose years more
then their minds, are fried with a small flame of ordinary fancy, rather
inserted by nature then inferred by love, such she entertaineth most
sumptuously, as fittest objects for her to work upon, putting oil in the
flame, fire to flax, and beauty as the balefull object to youth, for she
knowing the old verse to be too true for her to disprove, Quod latit ignotum
est: ignoti nulla Cupido, that, what is secret from us we never desire to
inueagle them with her charms, she present beutie excellent by nature, yet far
more gorgious by art: fair faces, smiling looks, alluring gestures sweet
speeches, these are the baits that she lays to entrap, and youth is so fond
that he cannot but taste, resembling the poor Mouse, that feeds soonest on
the most infectious Rosalger, respecting the color, not the confection, after
once she has gotten youth limed fast on her twigges, then Cupid uses them as
marks, and at every shoot galleth to the quick, that the wounds cannot be
cured, till either we find remedy by repentance, which often comes too late,
or have a quittance by death, which they think comes too soon. Others, that
have been stale stayers in her Court, spending their time in sighs, tears,
and many dispayring passions, such she feeds on with delays, giving the^
one day an incarnatiue to heal, and the next day a contrary medicine to
fester, choking their senses with perfumes, and straight stifling them with
Hemlock, suffering their Ladies in the morning to wash their temples with
Rose Water, and at night to quaffe to them gall and vinegar, shadowing smiles
with frowns, sower looks with wanton actions, fettering them with the wings
of hope, but hanging despair at their heels, least soaring too hie, they
should seize and catch their pray: suppose she sets the^ on the top of her
wheel, where, poor man I know thou desire to be plaste, and for their long
travel, she gives them with Ixion a cloud, a fair dame I mean, as she
bestowed upon Paris, yet shall thou find, that she fetches all her virgins
from the fountain of Alcydalion, (believe me Pilgrim I will not warrant their
maidenheads) because thou see they have many eyes, and many hearts, which have
many fancies, and many lures, and trust me Pilgrim, many causes must needs
bring out some effects: But leaving these doubts as may not once have entrance
into Lovers thoughts, and affirming that all are virgins that come from Venus,
for Diana has so few in her train, that she marries not one in seven years,
when the lover has what he long sought for, he finds not the fairest
Crystal but has his stain, the brightest topar but has his spot, the
richest Gold, but has his ore, and the purest creature feminine I mean: but
has her common imperfection, either proud without profit, and that's a
purgation for the Purse, or fair without wit, and that is to marry a wooden
picture with a golden creast, full of favor but flattering, and so he may
reap many kisses and little love, shrewish, deceitful, wilful, fond, new
fangle, and what not: nay, perhaps prove so light in the brains, that she make
him swell in the brows, that as he has been in his youth a votary to Venus,
so in his age he may prove a companion to Vulcan, and Pilgrim quoth the
Shepherd, this is to sit on the top of Venus wheel, these bitter sauces
be her cheifest delicates, and these painted Sepulchers her richest trophies.
Thou see I sit near Erecinus, and therefore speak by experience, thou say
to Venus thou art in love, thou would feign have a wife from Alcidalion,
look before thou leap, pry into Venus Cofers, and see what chaffer she
prouides for her chapmen, I have counsayled, now rests it in thee either to
follow it with a momentary sorrowing content, or to forsake it with a
perpetual pleasing mislike.

Hearing the cunning experienced swain to discourse so roundly of the matter,
I imagined either he had been in love, or an enemy to Venus, so that I
demanded of him if he would not have men love at all?

Yes quoth he, so they count Dianas virgins not Venus wantons: I replied she
had very few or none, he answered, had she more suitors, she would provide
more maids, but Venus spying them pass toward her Palace, lays such
snares to entangle, such traps to entice, such charms to bewitch, such dangers
to prejudice, that none or very few ariue at Dianas mantion, and such as do:
come thither half maimed.

Then quoth I, you conclude peremptorily against Venus and her crew, and very
hardly against women. Hearing me say so, he took me by the hand, and softly
whispering in mine ear, Pilgrim I may say to thee, Wives be they never so
watched they will: Maids be they never so bashful they wish, and widows be
they never so coy, they would, take me not generally Pilgrim quoth he, and
with that sitting down he took his pipe in his hand, and played so sweetly,
that like Argus at Mercuries melody I fell on sleep.

No sooner had Morpheus shut mine eyes, but I fell into a dream, me thought I
was led from Erecinus by Mercury, along the galupin or silver paued way of
heaven to the hie built house of Jove, there would I have gazde at the
gorgious buildings, but my guide was in haste, and conducted me into the great
Hall, where Jupiter and the rest of the Gods were at a banquet, no sooner was I
entered amongst them, but Mercury sprinkled me with water, which made me capaple
of their divine presence, so yt I sat still looking on their persons, and
listening to their parle, at last me thought blunt Vulcan that sat at ye lower
end of the board, although Venus above, sat opposite to Mars, began thus
roughly to break silence: I cannot mighty Gods but smile to think that when
my wife and her blind Son, the one with her box of beauties, the other with
his quiver of Arrows, pass abroad to show their Deities: what number of
poor perplexed men as Patients come to have cure of their hurts, some in their
eyes, that have gazed with the Philosopher against too bright a Sun, and such
are blind; some that with Ulysses have not stopped their ears, but have
listened the Sirens, and they complain of their hearing: some in their hearts,
and those bewraies their passions by their groans: none comes without grief,
nor return thoroughly cured, so that I suppose either the wounds are very
perilous, or my wife a bad Surgion. Truth (quoth Jupiter) but what number of
women come hither: Multitudes (quoth Vulcan) Apollo smoothly and yet with a
smile, demanded if they were as bad to cure as men: No (quoth Vulcan) for be
the wound never so deep, it is perfectly cured in twelve hours, either my wife
is more friendly to Women, or their sores more easy to salve. No (quoth
Mercury) it is because their loves are like a man's breath against bright
steel, which scarce lights on before it leapeth off, or like wood wet in
Allom water, which lies in the fire and waxes hot, but never burns: their
hearts resemble a Pumice stone, light: and which way soever you turn it: full
of starting holes, that if fancy steal in at the one, he can step out at the
other: or else quoth Jupiter, their hearts have no holes at all, but as firm as
flint, that neither fancy nor love can enter, for Venus teaches them
extremities, either to fawn and be too fond, or to be too coy and too
stubborn, which causes so many to put up inuertiues against her. Least of all
(quoth the Goddess,) in a great chafe has Jupiter cause to accuse women of
cruelty, if not, I appeal to Juno, at this all the company smiled and Jove was
silent, well (quoth Apollo,) leaving these quips seeing we have met to be
merry, if it please you to allow of my motion, to make us some music, I will
raise up the Ghosts of Orpheus and Arion, two, famous in their times for their
instruments, and greatly experienced in Love, as being great trauailers, and
with that conuersing the greatest Potentates in the world, who often are as
full of loves as they are of dignities: these shall please us with harmony, and
discourse either what they think, or what they have heard of women's Loves: To
this all the Gods gladly agreede, and Mercury was sent in Post to Pluto for
these two Musicians, scarce had I thought Mercury had been out of the Hall,
before I saw enter with this winged God the Ghosts of Orpheus and Arion, so
lively to the eye, and so well trussed in their apparel as they seemed
perfectly such as they were when they lived upon earth: Orpheus after that he
had done due reverence to the Gods, especially to Apollo: tuning his
instrument without any more command, as if his service should be saluery, he
daintily touched the Cords with a sweet stroke, and to a melodious tune, sung
this Ditty.

Orpheus Song.
HE that did sing the motions of the stars,
Pale colored Phoebus borrowing of her light:
Aspects of planets often opposed in iarres,
Of Hesper Henchmen to the day and night.
Sings now of Love as taugh by proof to sing:
Women are false and love a bitter thing.
I loved Euridicae the brightest Less,
More fond to like so fair a Nymph as she:
In Thefaly, so bright none ever was,
But fair and constant hardly may agree.
False hearted wife to him that loved thee well:
To leave thy love and choose the Prince of hell.
Theseus did help, and I in have did hie,
To Pluto, for the Less I loved so:
The God made grant, and who so glad as I,
I tunde my Harp, and she and I began go*
Glad that my love was left to me alone.
I looked back, Euridicae was gone.
She slipped aside back to her latest love,
Unkind she wronged her first and truest Feere,
Thus women's loves, delights as trial proves,
By false Eurydycae I loved so dear.
To change, and fleet, and every way to shrink,
To take in love, and lose it with a wink.
Scarce had Orpheus ended his song, but Jupiter thinking not to let so fair a
ball fall to the ground: took opportunity thus by the hand.

This present Dittie of Orpheus tends to our forepassed discourse, as though
the Fates had forepointed our talk, and this arrival consequence of their
infallible decrees: since then the unkindness of Euridicae discouers the
inconstancy of women, and that Orpheus has by his sundry passions made an
Anatomy of love: let us hear his opinion how he censures of beauty. Apollo
at Jupiters motion commanded Orpheus, who not amassed (as a Ghost come from
hell) began thus. The Question right mighty Gods is easy, for that commonly
all gaze at beauty as at the fairest object that flattereth the eye, yet a
thing perilous, howsoever it seems precious: seeing the fairest Lawnes soonest
take the deepest stains, the brightest Beralles the greatest flawes, and
oftentimes the fairest faces with intolerable faults: Greece vaunted not so
much of her beautiful paragon, as Troy lamented of their incestuous strumpet,
men came to Rome to see Messalines beauty, but Rome sorrowed that she was
counted a Harlot: Thessaly rung of Euridites proportion, but Thessaly shamed
and Orpheus grieved at her bad condition, and yet forsooth though we find
beauty thus prejudicial, yet we must leap at it, though to our utter ruin we
light in the ditch: But as the fish Ramera listening to the sound of the
trumpet, is caught of the Fishers: as the Porcupine stands staring at the
glimmering of the Stars, and is overtaken with dogs: as the Leopard looking
at the Panthers painted skin, is caught as a pray: so he which takes too
much delight to gaze upon beauty, is often times galled with grief and misery:
yea, his pleasure shall infer such profit, and his good will such gains, as
if he reapt the beautiful Apples of Tantalus, which are no sooner touched, but
they turn to ashes.

Beauty no sooner flourishes but it fades, and it is not fully ripe, but it
begins to rotte: it no sooner blossommeth, but it withers: and scarcely
being touched, it stayneth like the Guiacum leaf, that has the one halpe
parched before the other half be perfect, to the Bird Acauthis, which hatched
white, yet turns black at the first storm: Or like to the stone Astites,
that changes color with the only breath of a man: this (right mighty Gods)
is my censure of beauty, that unless joined with virtue, it is like the
feathers of the Phoenix, placed in the carcass of a Crow, but where faith and
feature are Relatiues, that beauty I call divine and metaphisica, for because
gratior est pulchro veniens e corpore virtus. This discourse of Orpheus all the
Gods applauded except Venus, Juno brookt it as having lost the Ball, and Venus
thought it was best to pocket up whatsoever a Ghost out of hell did tattle, and
so I would have all fair Gentlewomen to take it: well, so well did the Gods
like and allow of his talk, that Jupiter questioned him what he thought
generally of women: Orpheus neither forcing Juno nor Venus, as one that could
but go to hell, boldly made answer, that their general sex stood upon two
extremes, either too courteous or too cruel, and that he had made expeence of
both, and which quoth Jupiter are the worst? I note (quoth Orpheus) if your
question tendes toward men, because my particular instance may be no general
Example, but this well I wot, cruelty has the greatest punishment appointed
for it in hell, which may it please you and the rest of the Gods to be
attentive, I will prove with a known history. The Gods settling themselves in
their seats, showed by their silence how they liked of his motion, whereupon
Orpheus began thus.

Orpheus Tale.
SInce the mad frowes of Bacchus (in that I was sworn an enemy to women through
the unkindness of Euridicae,) stoned me to death while I sat playing music to
the Rocks, which seemed to move at my melody: my soul sent to Pluto, I
found favor at his hands for that he wronged me of my wife, that I had free
liberty to pass into every several mancion: whereupon one day with my Harp I
walked through several places, and heard several complaints, but at the last
I came to a thick fogge, the smoke and stench so deadly and pestilent, as all
the ghosts in hell, respecting this dungeon, seemed to live in Elisium, out of
this mist I heard the voice of a woman, uttering pitiful shrikes, having
remorse of her passions, I touched my Harp, and played, thinking while my
music lasted, to make her forget her torments, as I had done the other ghosts
in hell, but she told me all was in vain, since as her fault exceeded all, so
her torture was more then they all: for here quoth she I hang by the hair of
ye head in so thick a smoke and stinking a fog, as no tongue can express,
nor imagination conceive it. Desirous to hear the cause of this strange
extreme, I asked her name, and the offense, she wished me ^alfe angerly to
cease my fidling, and she would discourse at large: I put up my pipes at such a
dry blow, and she murmured out of the fogge thus.

I am Lidia that renowned Princess, whose never matched beauty seemed like the
gorgious pomp of Phoebus, too bright for the day: rung so strongly out of the
trumpe of Fame, as it filled every ear with wonder: Daughter to Astolpho, the
King of Lydia: who thought himself not so fortunate for his Diadem, since other
Kings could boast of Crowns: nor for his great possessions, although endued
with large territories, as happy that he had a Daughter whose excellency in
favor stained Venus, whose austere chastity set Diana to silence with a
blush: Know whatsoever thou art that stand attentive to my tale, that ye
ruddiest Rose in all Damasco, the whitest Lillies in the creeks of Danuby,
might not if they had united their native colors, but have bashed at the
vermilion stain, flourisht upon the pure Crystal of my face: the
Marguerites of the western Indies counted more bright and rich, then that
which Cleopatra quaft to Anthony, the Coral highest in his pride upon the
Affricke shoares, might well be graced to resemble my teeth and lips, but
never honored to ouerreach my pureness. Remaining thus the mirror of the
World, and natures strangest miracle: there arrived in our Court a Thracian
Knight, of personage tall, proportioned in most exquisite form, his face but
too fair for his qualities, for he was a brave and resolute Soldier. This
Caualier coming amongst diverse others to see the royally of the state of
Lidia, no sooner had a glaunce of my beauty, but he set down his staff,
resolving either to perrish in so sweet a Laborinth, or in time happily to
stumble out with Theseus. He had not staide long in my Fathers Court, but he
showed such Knightly deeds of chivalry amongst the nobility, lightened with
the extraordinary sparks of a courageous mind, that not only he was liked
and loved of all the chief Peers of the Realms, but the report of his
valor coming to my Fathers ears, he was highly honored of him, and placed
in short time as General of his warlike forces by Land: resting in this
estimation with the King, preferment was no means to quiet his mind, for love
had wounded so deep, as honor by no means might remedy, that as the
Elephants can hardly be haled from the sight of the Wast, or the Roe buck from
gazing at red cloth, so there was no object that could so much allure the
wavering eyes of this Thracian called Acestes, as the surpassing beauty of the
Princess Lydia, yea, so deeply he doted, that as the Camelion gorgeth
herself with gazing into the air, so he fed his fancy with staring on the
heavenly face of his Goddess, so long dallying in the flame, that he scorcht
his wings, and in time consumed his whole body. Being thus passionate, having
none so familiar as he durst make, he fell thus to debate with himself.

Is it Alcestes love that troubles thee? why thou art a Soldier, sworn to
arms, not to Armor: to encounter foes in the feelde, not to court Ladies in
the Chamber: Hercules had almost performed his twelve labors, ere he durst
find leisure to love, and thou art scarce acquainted with Mars, but thou
seek to be private friend to Venus: away fond fool, to thy Spear and
Shield, manage thy horse, though here in a peaceable Country: let not Bees
hiue in thy Helmet, rust inblaze the figure of sloth on thy Armor, or love
call thee her milksoppe, by whom war it self has approved martial: have
thou forgotte that which thou suckest out of thy Nurses teate, that to love is
to loose, and fancy be it never so charie, is mere folly: for love how
soever it be, is but a Chaos of cares: and fancy though never so fortunate,
has her crosses: for if thou enjoy the beauty of Venus, thou shall find it
small vantage: if thou get one as nice as Minerua, thou may put thy winnings
in thine eye: if as gorgious as Juno, thy account being cast, thy sums will be
rated with loss: yea, be she chaste, be she virtuous, be she courteous,
constant, rich, renowned, honest, honorable, yet if thou be wedded to a woman,
think thou shall find in her sufficient vanity to counteruaile her virtue:
assure thy self never to live less without disquiet, nor die before thou have
cause to repent: which Craterus the Emperor noted, when wishing that some
sinister misfortune might befall his foe: he prayed unto the Gods he might be
married in his youth, and dye without issue in his age: accounting marriage by
this wish, far more full of prejudice, then of pleasure. This, yea all this
Acestes thou know to be true: but suppose it were not, is there not
sufficient to dissuade? beside, see thou not? or has fancy cast such a mask
before thine eyes, that thou will not see? that her beauty as it is excellent,
so it is high seated: both in the dignity of her parentage, and the self
conceit of her mind, to be gazed at, and so honored: not to be reached at and
so enjoyed, thou see she is little liberal of her looks, much less
prodigal of her love: she couets rather a God, then a man: the^ amongst men
think she will aim at the highest, or sit still as she is: Pride in her
greatest pomp sits inthrond in her eyes, and disdain in her looks: that if
she glaunce to so low as Acestes, it is rather to grace him with a smile then
to show him any favor: beside, fortune has opposed her self to thy aspiring
thoughts, in that thy good will has not yet deserved any such guerdon: thy
desire, is far above thy desert: and the poor stay of a wandering Knight,
far unfit for the Princely state of worthy Lidia: But suppose she were
pricked in the same vein, and that Venus would friendly instill some drops of
her inchaunted water to mollify her heart, yet ye Duke her Father will neither
condescend to her mind, nor consent to my motion: nay if he should but hear of
such reckles folly, as he has wrought my promotion, so he would work my
confusion: and in troth Acestes, not without cause: for art thou so void of
virtue, or vowde to vice, as to requite his liberality with such disloyalty: to
return the trust which he reposeth in thee with such treachery: Tush, Love is
above Lord or law, friend or faith, where Love buddeth, no Master is made
account off, no King cared for, no friend feared of, no duty respected: but all
things done according to the quality that is predominant. Have thou been a
Soldier, and dreamest thou of such doubts? are the courtings of Venus, more
perrillous then the incounters of Mars? or the denial of a Lady, worse then
the daunt of a foe: no Acestes, be not faint hearted as the North Islands, where
the people Iberi dwell foster no venomous beast, nor the Sea called Mare
mortuum feeds no Fish, so are there no Cowards suffered to arrive at Paphos,
she is but a woman, and therefore to be wone: Then sound on the march, ask not
of what degree she is, but where she is: these words Acestes (carry emphasis)
and are more fit for a Soldier then for a Lover: for love is quesie, and if it
be ouer-strained, cracketh at the first wrest: enduring in this doubt, he sat
down deeply ouercharged with melancholy passions; that as he which eats of
the Goord Nutte, loses his memory: and as the Elephant feeding on the
Helytropian becomes sleepy: so Acestes fell into a drowsy kind of
contemplature, that to avoid such cogitations as combred his mind, he got
him self into a Gallery which was built between the Turrets of the house, and
there set himself down as half in a trance: Love, that took pity of
this patient, so favored him, that he had not sat long in his dumps but that
Lidia came thither all alone to be solitary, who seeing Acestes sitting thus
sadly slumbring, determined for her own recreation to be a little pleasant with
him, and therefore awakened him thus.

Why how now Acestes, is it your custom in Thracia to use slumbers after meat
for Physic? or is it some melancholy impression that thus amateth your senses?
trust me at the first I called to remembrance the picture that Zerxsis drew of
Endimion, lying upon the mount of Erecinus, who leaning his head on his hand,
his eyes shut as one in a dream: yet had his face so bedued with distilling
tears, as his outward plaints did sufficiently bewray his inward passions: and
so Acestes, in this thy solitary dump? did thou resemble Endimion, both in
countenance and color, that had tears fallen from thine eyes as thou were in
a trance? I had happily demanded how Phebe had used thee: So apalde was
Acestes at this sudden presence of Lidia, that he sat still as a man deprived
of his senses: till at the last gathering of his wits together he start up,
and his due reverence done, he made this answer.

I think Madam that melancholy is not particular either to person or place, but
that being a complexion, it follows oft-times the quality of the affection:
so that the mind any way distressed, the body must yield in effect to the most
precious part: I confess therefore, that being disquiet at my heart, I felt
mine eyes heavy, as they which were the cheifest procurers of my malady: but
when I awoke and saw your excellency, both your presence and courtesy greatly
daunted my mind: your presence, in dazeling mine eyes so suddenly with so
solemn an object: your courtesy, in that your Ladyshippe without curiosity
would vouchsafe to talk with so mean a Gentleman: but I see the best fruit
has the brauest blossoms: the most precious stone, is chosen by the most
glistering hue, and the best conditions, by the sweetest countenance: so that
where beauty reigns, there virtue remains: and under a fair face rests a
faithful heart: But whereas you say you had taken me for Endimion by my
penitrature and countenance, but that I wanted tears to decipher my sorrow: I
answer, that the hottest thunders are not ever quenched with rain, nor the
deepest greefes ever discovered by tears: the stone Garatides fryeth without
and is cold within, the Germander least when it is most full of moisture,
looks then most dry: where the sea is most deep, there it is most calm: and
where is the smallest show of tears, there often are the greatest effect of
sorrow: For trust me Madam, I think Endimion sighing for the absence of his
Lady Luna, never felt more bitter passions on the mount Erecinus, then I
suffered in this half waking slumber: why (quoth Lidia) are you in love?
Acestes at this question fetched a deep sigh, as it seemed his heart strings
should have cracked in sunder, he stood as one in an ecstasy, doubting whether
now he should take time by the forehead, or to defer it till afterward:
well, seeing opportunity so fit, he boldly took heart at grace, and began to
give this encunter.

They (Madame) that seek to stop the swift running Volgo, a River that leads
into Persia, by staying the stream, makes the flood flow more fiercely: to
repress the fire, is to increase the flame: and to conceal love, is to
smother smoke in the nosethrill, which either will out, or else stifleth: wounds
fed of with delays fester, and often prove incurable: fancy long held in the
grass, seldom proves a timely Harvest: which makes me to set my hazard on
the Dice, and either presently to hear the courteous sentence of my life* or
the cruel doom of my death. Since most excellent Princess, I arrived at the
Court of Lidia, so has mine eyes fed on the beauty of your face, mine ears
wrapped in admiration of your divine wit, my mind inchaunted with the
consideration of your virtues, and my heart as the receptacle of all these
excellencies, so devoted to the substance that contriues such supernatural
qualities, that the exceeding pleasure, which so long luld me in delight, at
length suncke so deep, that they grew to grievous passions: to say all (what I
could at large discourse) in on word, so long did I gaze at your beauty, that
I was snared, and so long did I admire your virtue, that now I rest your
Captive: so far Madame entered the Laborinth, that either I must perrish with
the Minotaure, or else humbly crave your aid, that the clue of your mercy may
hale me forth of such an intricate danger.

Lidia, who swelled in choler at these speeches, could not brook to hear up
the end of his discourse, but faring like angry Jove, who in his rage covers
the beautiful Sky with a world of storms, so she incensed with dysdaine,
filled her sweet countenance with a shaddowe of bitter frowns, knitting her
brows she began thus to reply.

Why gentle master Knight, has too much familiarity bredde contempt? are you
such a good Phisiognomer, that you have insight into my wrincle in the browe
and dimple in the cheeks? I see well if Apelles that cunning Painter, suffer
the greasy Sowter to take a view of his curious work, he will grow so
malapart as to meddle with his picture, that he must be thrust into his shop
with Nae suitor vltra crepidum, if the proud Centaur Ixion be bidden to the
feast of the Gods, no less then Juno herself will suffice him for his choice.

Set a Beggar on horseback, and they say he will never light: extol one of
base stock to any degree of dignity, and who so proud and hautie: I speak
this Acestes to thy reproof, for that my Father has made thee general of his
forces, seek thou to master him in fortune: will no diet down but my
Fathers own Dish? no meaner mate suffice unless thou marry with a Prince? Did
my Father prefer thee, and now will thou presume to be his better? have my
looks been so loving, my glaunces so full of good will, as to promise so much
as thou do presume? no* but the least countenance of familiarity to a
servile mind, procures great encouragement: have thou ever noted any of my
actions so base, that thou might think I would match with a man of thy
calling? Have I wantond it so ever in thy sight, as thou might think me fit
for Venus? But suppose my mind were so fond, as I would (soring so hie as
ever I have done) stoop now so low? think thou my Father could affoorde
thee his Daughter Lidia, whom he far priseth above his crown? hopest thou to
compass his consent? No, but if he knew of thy daring presumtion, he would
repay thy folly with such punishments, as thy aspiring thoughts do merit:
he would vnplume thee of all thy feathers: and like Esops Crow turn thee
naked to the world: that they which grudged at thy hasty promotion, might
laugh at thy sudaine fall: if therefore thou love thine own welfare, keep thy
self within thy bounds: least in soaring with the Hobby, to fall to the geound
with the Lark: and in daring with Phaeton, thou fall headlong into such
infirmities, as thou shall never be able to creep out of: and with that she
flung away in a great rage, and left Acestes passing passionate: so that he
sat him down again more melancholy then he was before: musing and
meditating upon the cruel resolution of Lidia, slumbring thus on his hard
fortune, upon a sudden he fell into these terms.

But by the sweet, how should we know the sower: the white seems most
silver hued when it is adjoined to black: and prosperity is most sweetest
when it has been fore-crossed with adversity. This principle perhaps Lidia
means to make me try by experience, thinking to feed me first with bitter
broathes, that after, dainty fare may more delight me: for the childing cold
of Winter, makes the Summers Sun more pleasant: and the frowning looks of
Lidia, will cause her smiles to seem more cheerful. Then Acestes cease not
to pursue thy suit, until thou find her more courteous, or resolutely vowed to
remain obstinate.

Thus like a valiant Champion, Acestes never feared that mislike hung in Women's
brows, and into their hearts he could not pry: but hoped the best, and sought
for opportunity to iterate his suit in this distress. But ForFortune meaning
plesantly to sport with this young nouice, would not minister such fit
occasion that he might have sole and solitary access to his Goddess: for
Lidia upon pretended purpose, so warily avoided his company: and with such
disdainful looks rewarded his proffered duty, that Acestes was feign to aim
his course by a new compass, and therefore getting into his Chamber, stepping
to his standish, he wrote her a Letter to this effect.

Acestes to the beautiful Princess Lidia, wishes what she desires.
SUch as take surfeite by feeding too greedily on the Honey combs of Hibla,
seek cure by tasting overmuch of the sweet sugar Canes in Candi. The Phalanga
stingeth deadly, and his venom can be drawn out only by rubbing over the
place with gold. They which fall sick of Love, must have potions ministered by
fancy and charms from Venus to tie about their temples, or else come Apollo
with all his drugs: the patient will return him this answer. Nullis amor est
medicabilis Herbis. I speak this sweet Princess, as a patient troubled with
the same passions: for so deeply have I imprinted the rich Carracters of your
exquisite perfections, in the closet of my thoughts* that neither mine own
endeavor feeling I have aspyred too hie, nor your rigor checking me I am borne
to low, serves any way to race out those Ideas which so firmly I have
conceived: I seek to suppress love with reason: and I find that I quench
fire with Flax: I use absence, that is Oil in the flame: I frequent company,
their talk is tedious unto me: I seek to be solitary, oh then as in visions
your sweet self is present, as that celestial object whereon mine eye
coueteth to gaze, and my mind to meditate. Since then Madame, your beauty has
made me surfeit, let your courteous bounty cure my disease: reject him not so
rigorously that regards you with such reverence: poor Knights have their
loves not in their own wills, but as Love and Fortune pleases to allot: some
gaze hie and stumble not, as Vulcan when he courted Venus, some look low and
gain not, as Eumenides, that married a Farmers daughter that proved unchaste:
sure I am howsoever I shall speed, it will be more honor for me to perrish in
her desires, then live in base fortunes. Then Madam, seeing my love is like to
ye stone Lincostis, which the louder the wind blows, and the deeper they are
drencht in the water, the more they burn and blaze: so the more you seek to
cool my fancy with disdain, the more my affection is kindled with desire:
the greater despair you drive me into by denials, the greater hope encouraged
by constancy I have to obtain my requests? in which fervent affection I mean
to remain without change, craving in liew of this my loialtie, that I may be
admitted by degrees into your favor, even as my deserts in love shall merit,
which shall be as the bliss of heaven to him that pineth away, and as yours
only and ever.

Still in hope Acestes.


THis Letter conueid with great speed and no less secrecy to Lidia being
then solitary in her Chamber, who receiving them, vnripping the seals, saw no
sooner the name of Acestes, but she perceived he was importunate in his old
suit: which drove her into such a fury, as at the first she flung away his
Letter in great disdain, vpbrayding him of immoderate presumption, that durst
attempt the love of such a Paragon: so that thoroughly inflamed with choler,
she stepped hastily to the Letter and red it, which after she had perused,
falling into a satyricall scoffing kind of vain, she rudely returned him
this answer.

To her new found Lover Acestes, the great Knight of Thracia, Health.
Sweet Sir, I received your passionate Letters, and pity them as the
inhabitants of Labia Laborinth do the passengers that perrish on their
shelues, whom they gaze on, but never relieve: your witty invention tells me
that you are stung with the Phalanga, and so are in love: take it the more
patiently, for no doubt the serpent was Venus messenger, else had she not fancy
in steed of infection: But alas, your malady cannot be cured but by my means:
know then brave Caualier of Thracia, that my cunning is too small to enterprise
the composition of any secret simples, and my calling too great to become a
Physician to such a paltring Patient: so that I neither can nor will cure any
other man's disease by being prejudicial to mine own safety, but gentle sir
think me not cruel: for it is the influence of the stars, and the effects
of nature that makes these contrarieties, as having opposde us in the
calculation of our nativity, for as the Panther cannot abide the company of the
Ownce, as the Uulture is mortal enemy to the Eagle, and the blood of a Lion
and a Woolfe can never be mixed in one bowl, so as impossible it is by
requests, be they never so ruthful to become thy friend, which by the
destinies and instinct of nature am thy mortal foe. Cease then to accuse me
of cruelty, and leave off to appeal to my courtesy, for thou shall always be
sure to find the one, and never to feel the other: yet least thou should
condemn Lidia of ingratitude, who ever was bountiful to her greatest foes,
though I cannot inwardly mittigate thy misery, yet I will outwardly teach thee
to apply such playsters, as if the experience of them approve true, shall
greatly appease thy pain: It is reported that he which drinks of the river
Auerna, cools and mortifieth his affections, but if the water be touched by
any means before it be drunk, the virtue thereof is of no value. He that
wears the feathers of the bird Ezalon about him, shall ever be fortunate in his
love, but if they be not pulled when the Sun is eclipsed: they are of no force,
and to be brief there is nothing that sooner drives away amorous conceits,
the^ to rub the temples of thy head with the sweat of an Ass, which if you
can perform, as no doubt you may put in practice, fear not but you shall
count my Physic authentical. Thus gentle knight of Thracia, you have heard
my mind, and so I warn you to wade no further, least I have cause to laugh and
you to repent.

Lidia of Lidia resolved to mislike of Acestes of Thracia.


THis Letter she sent by one of her Gentlewomen to Acestes, who no sooner read
the contents, but the disdain of his Goddess struck such a cold dumpe to
his heart, that he sat as the picture of Pigmalion, when the poor caruer
leaned with great passion on his marble mistress: his thoughts were on
despair, his musings on despair, the objects to his eyes, sounded the ugly
shadow of despair: that as one lunatic, he said: Venus was ths strumpet of
Mars, the baude of Jupiter, the Patroness of leachers: and that in all her
Kingdom there was neither love nor virtue, but lust and vanity: I grant
(quoth he) she has beauty to bestow, but so it is tempred with pride, as he
that buys it does penetentiam emere: she has many such truls as Helena to
sell, but they were either so froward or so frolic, as fear may persuade them
from the one, or turn them from the other: she is Goddess of women's hearts,
but she tricks them up with such false colors, and engraues so many
principles of her Philosophy, in the very center of it, that they are as expert
in coining of deceites, forging of tears, feigning of sighs, casting of
looks, lending of fauning smiles, and such prejudicial policies to bewitch
men, as ever the Caldees were in their diuinations, but this is, suffiseth not
to revenge me on her words, would she were mortal, the^ would she were Mars,
that I might with my arming Sword pearce their disdain and ingratitude in
single Combat.

As thus he was half in a frenzy, one came to him from the King with
Letters, the contents whereof were, that he should make him ready with all
possible speed to pass into Pamphilia, to make invasion with fire and sword:
This news come to Acestes view, as a man revived from the dead, he burst from
his former plaints, and began thus to frolic with him self: Now despite of
Venus has Fortune sworn to join me in friendship with opportunity, now time
proffers the full cup, and the devil take me if I carowse it not: Now Lidia
shall be mine if ever she shall be to any: women are won with honors: the fame
of Prowess challenges more then eloquence, a Soldiers sword prevails more
with a Princess, the^ a Cowardes pen: when news shall come to Lidia that
Acestes has made a conquest of Pamphilia, when he sends the Kings Crown as a
token to the fair and matchles Lidia, the^ no doubt but she will be as
courteous, as now she is cruel: her looks will lighten love, where now they
drop hate: her words will be welcome, where now they threten revenge:
Conquerers carry commands in their foreheads, and love kneeles to them where
others bow to love? then Acestes ply thee, martial thy Soldiers in have to
Pamphilia, and there fight both for honor and love, which either resolve to get
or to miss of both with death: Having thus comforted him self, he provided
all things necessary for his voyage into Pamphilia, both of soldiers, money,
victuals, and munition: which being ready: taking his leave only of the King
(for Lidia would (...) (...) and his Daughter on his right hand, were amazed,
as noting in his face some extraordinary sparks of Chivalry: Acestes pacing
up to the steps that decended from the Kings seat, placing on either hand a
King, began thus to deliver his tale.

Right mighty Sovereign, executing the charge of the General of thy forces
against Pamphilia, as thy command and my allegance bad me, I entered with fire
and sword, and by the help of Fortune made conquest of the Country, the King
is slain, his Crown I sent to thy Daughter, the kingdom is garisond to thy
use: his confederates these two Kings of Caria and Cylicia, for that they
united their supplies to his forces, I invaded, conquered, and brought hither
Captives: their Crowns their kingdoms, the treasure, the bondslaues, for that
they were without thy Commission, I not present to thee, but to the Princess
Lidia, with all the honor I won in the field, ever vowing to deuote all my
thoughts, my actions, and my Sword and life, as pressed to execute her command
and service: with that, rising up, he led the Kings to the Princess, and
delivered them her as her Captives, she could not for shame in such a
presence, but feign a good countenance, and accept them gratefully: whom she
forthwith presented to her Father, who entertaind them as belonged to such
Kingly prisoners: all the Nobles casting their eyes on Acestes, as honoring
the man for his virtues: the King starting up, gave him great thanks, and bad
him demand somewhat before that honorable assembly: with the gift whereof
he might gratify him: swearing whatsoever he craved, as he was true King he
would perform it: Acestes hearing this happy motion, casting his eye on the
Lady Lidia, boldly began his request thus.

Although right mighty Sovereign, Crowns and Kingdoms be sweet, and your
grace has willed me to ask any thing without acception: yet for that I
paunde my life and honor for the atchiuing of these conquests with my blood,
which a Soldier holds far deerer then Diadems, I little make account of
such pelf: but rather make choice of that which I prefer before honor, life,
and land, or all the world, if it should be presented to me: and that is, the
fair and virtuous Princess Lidia. Scarce had Acestes uttered this word
Lidia, but the King starting from his seat, turned to his daughter, and asked
what love was passed betwixt her and Acestes. Such (quoth she) with a frowning
countenance, as past betwixt Juno and the Centaure Ixion: I not deny, but
before his journey to Pamphilia, he courted and made great suit by word, and
letters, but how I disdained the motion of so base a companion, let the
aunswers of his Letters manifest: And now before this royal and honorable
assembly I protest, if Acestes were featurde like Narcissus, as courageous as
Hercules, having as many heroical virtues as ever had any, and could present
me every day two Kings for Captives till he made me Empress of the World, yet
would I disdain him, as one unworthy the Princess Lidia. At this answer,
all the assembly abashed, as counting the Princess discourteous and ingrate:
the King as a man inflamed with fury, began to prosecute his Daughters speech
in this manner: Presumptuous Thracian, unfit with these late conquests,
rather obtained by the ill fortune of these Kings, then thy prowess: for thou
have done me service, I grant thee life, but for thine aspyring thoughts to
demand the Princess Lidia, I discharge thee of thy Generalship, and
absolutely of my service, commanding thee upon pain of death, within ten
days to depart out of all my dominions, and never to approach my Confines or
land. This said, the King in great choler rose up ready to depart, the Nobles
were amazed and grieved, yea, and grudged secretly at Acestes wrong, but for
fear of the King were silent: Acestes howsoever inwardly vexed, yet showed no
discontent in his countenance, but with a Soldiers courage pulling of his
Garland, said: I am not dismayed at this doom, for that I never grieved at the
ouerthwarts of Fortune: what I have got in thy Court, I leave, as disdaining
ought yt is thine: the honor I have won, is mine own, and that thou can
not deprive me off, and so committing my fortunes to my deserts, I leave thee
and thy Court: and so soon as may be thy Country: where if ever I arrive, I
dare thee to do thy worst: and with that Acestes went away, and the King with
the two Kings and the Lords, passed in to dinner.

No sooner was Acestes alone, but the ingratitude of the King, the disdain of
his Daughter, the disgrace offered by both, so pierst him to the heart, that as
such as drink of Lethe become obliuious: so he forgetting the beauty of Lidia,
fell to such deep thoughts of hate and revenge, that he enjoined himself for
a great space to be solitary, that Nemesis and he might consult together how to
bring both the Father and the Daughter to confusion: at last he resolved to
go to Armenia to Sertorius, there great Potentate of that Country, whom he
knew to be mortal enemy to the King of Lidia, and in this resolution he
took his journey. No sooner was he arrived in the Armenian Court, but word
was brought to Sertorius that Acestes the martial Thracian, that conquered
Pamphilia, Ca^ia, and Cylicia, was come disguised, and as a stranger into his
Court: the King hearing this, took one or two of his chief Lords, and went to
salute Acestes, and to give him honorable entertainment, such as belonged to
so mighty a Co^querer: Acestes perceiving himself to be known, after due
reverence done to the King, began at large to discourse to him what service he
had done to the King of Lidia, and how he was rewarded, craving succor and
supply of his Majesty, that he might revenge with his Sword. The King amazed
at such monstrous ingratitude, wondering how such base resolutions could
harbor in the heart of Prince, he promised Acestes not only to aid him with
an army of approved Soldiers, but in person to hazard him self, both to
requite old injuries: and to reprove in justice such an abuse offered without
desert. This answer of Sertorius so contented Acestes, that after great thanks,
he rested in the Court, passing frolic, til the forces were furnishing:
which no sooner were ready, but without delay Sertorius and Acestes marched
merrily forward toward the confines of Lidia, as soon as Acestes had set
his foot within the ground of the ungrateful King, drawing his Sword, he
swore not to sheathe it, till he had made it drunk with the blood of Lidians,
commanding his Soldiers (for Sertorius had given him the ordring of the
battles) that they should use all extremeties of martial, burn, sack,
spoil Cities, Towns, and Castles, to cast all to the ground, to take none
Captives of whatsoever degree or sex, but to put all to the Sword: men as they
were subjects in Lidia, Women as the worms that he most hated: Children as the
issue of them both: the pillage of all should be theirs, only the King of
Armenia should have the Kingdom, and he would content him self with revenge:
this Oration ended, he furiously marched forward, and where he came, left the
Country desolate: The King of Lidia hearing this, was driven into a great
agony, but dissembling his grief for fear of discouraging his Soldiers, he
levied a mighty army, and hasted forward to buckle with Acestes whom he met
half at advantage, as having most of his men at pillage: whereupon the Lidians
taking opportunity set upon the Armenians, but Acestes so rangde those that he
had, in such warlike sort: that he not only aboade the brave of his enemy, but
entered his battle, disordered his ranckes, and put them to the flight: many
were slain in that present place, such as escapt and fled, were met by the
Pillages and haruiers of the Armenians, and all put to the sword, so that of
forty thousand Lidians there scarce remained thirty with the King, who passing
up into the Country: insconst himself within a strong Castle with his
Daughter Lidia, a few faint hearted Soldiers, and all the treasure he could
get: Acestes followed his Fortunes, and leaving Sertorius behind with the main
battle, took with him ten thousand Horse, and six thousand foot, and made
after the King of Lidia, as fast as his men were able to march: coming at last
to the Castle weere he was insconst, first he intrencht a siege round about
and legard it on every side, then he damd up all such springs, wels, and
Conduits, as served the Castle with fresh water: this done, he resolved not
to loose a man at the assault, but to make them yield by famine. The Princess
Lidia looking over the walls, seeing how her mortal enemy had girt the Castle
with Soldiers, Armenians men there thirsted after blood, and hated both her
and her Father, she fell from thoughts to passions, from passions to tears:
insomuch that she sat her down, and wept bitterly: her Father coming up the
batilments, seeing his daughter in such perplexed estate, finding want of
victuals, and that of force he must be famished: grief stopping his speech, he
sat him down and bare her company in her passions: and after consulted how to
prevent ensuing misery, many conjectures cast: at last they resolved to submit
themselves to his mercy, whereupon Lidia decking her self in most gorgious
attire, accompanied only with two of her Ladies, passed out of the Castle
gate, and went toward the Legar: the Sentonell no sooner had them in hold, but
they were honorably conveyed to the Pauilion of Acestes, who being certified
that the Princess Lidia was attended to speak with him, leapt from his seat,
and went to entertain her, Lidia no sooner saw him, but she fell down at his
feet: Acestes curteeusly took her up, and setting her in his seat, demanded
her what she^craued: Lidia all blubbered with tears, falling down on her
knees, began thus.

Mighty Acestes, if repentance were any satisfaction for offenses, or sorrow
any salve to cover ingratitude, if tears might wipe away disdain, if a
Uirgines blood would pay ransom for them which have done amiss: I would
present all these to pacify the fury of thy conquering Sword: but I know such
deep hate of my Fathers ingratitude, such desire to revenge my rechlesse
disdain, and the disgrace proffered by both: has set a fire the heart of
Acestes, as nothing may serve to quench such an over heated flame: Oh yet might
I find so much favor, that my death might redeem the old man my Father, if
not for the loss of Kingdom, yet of life: and from falling into the hands of
his ancient enemy Sertorius, I should account Acestes as merciful as he is
valiant: if my treaties may not prevail, as it little behooves Acestes any
way to favor Lidia, yet grant me this, that I may dye upon thine own Sword,
that my blood vanishing on thy blade, thou may be satisfied, and I
slaughtred: by the hand of Acestes so brave a Soldier, might dye contented.

No sooner had she uttered these words, but she poured forth such streams
of tears, as made the Armenians to take pity of the distressed Princess:
Acestes taking her up again, called for his Sword, and unsheathing falling
down at her feet, began thus to make reply.

Such deep impression of grief sweet Goddess, has pierced the heart of
Acestes, in that he has lifted his Sword against the Lord that harboreth
Lidia such sorrow, such repentance, such remorce, in that I have done any
thing that might offend the Princess Lidia, whose divine presence has raced
out all intent to revenge: and so captiuated again her Acestes: that here
franckly he offreth his conquering Sword, (that has atchiued so many
battles) into the hand of his mistress to chastise either with death if she
please, that daring Knight that has so deeply offended, and with that he sat
as a man in a trance: Lidia seeing she had brought the Bear to the stake,
thought now so cunningly to muzzle, as she would keep him hereafter for
biting: following therefore her inchauntment, she fell about his neck, and
wette his cheeks with her tears in such sort, that at last from weeping they
fell to kissing, yea so did Acestes comfort Lidia, that from melancholy she
grew to be somewhat pleasant, the Knight possessed thus of his Lady (as he
thought) after he had banqueted her with such delicates as soldiers can
afford, taking only her hand for pawn of his fafety, he went with her to the
Castle, where they were no sooner entered, but the King of Lidia with his
Crown in his hand met Acestes, and submitting him self, offered both his
diadem and daughter as due to so victorious a champion, Acestes refused his
dignities, but accepting of his Daughter, embraced her, and entered into private
and familier parle: insomuch that choler past upon both sides, they began to
treat of the marriage, which was concluded: when the King of Armenia returned
out of his Kingdom: whereupon without delay (so fervent was the love of
Acestes,) he took leave of Lidia and her Father, and going down to the
Legar, raised the siege, to the great admiration of all his Soldiers, and from
thence marched to the Camp where Sertorius lay: to whom Acestes reveled what
had past, and craved that he would depart out of Lidia with sufficient coin
answerable for his costs: Sertorius with a frowning look told him that in
battle he never played in jest, and what he had won with the blood of his
Soldiers and danger of his own person, he would not deliver up but by
battle: Acestes whose mind was too haughty to entreat, said nothing, but
secretly stole from the Camp, and traversing through Lidia, got up of Horse
and Footmen, the number of six and thirty thousand, with whom trusting to
his Fortunes, he marched closely and secretly to the Camp, of Sertorius,
where he arrived about midnight, using now policy, that before had conquered
with prowess: so that killing the watch and Sentonell, he past the Court of
guard, and set upon the Soldiers, making a great slaughter of such men as were
sleepie and amazed: yet Sertorius escaped, but Acestes passed forward and
followed him into Armenia, where his fortunes so served him, that he conquered
Armenia, and brought the King himself captive to Lidia: coming thus in
triumph to my Fathers court, seating him in greater pomp and possessions then
ever he had, he began to use his late familiarity toward me, but I as a woman
changed in calling and condition, shook him off with more disdain then
before: he challenged my Fathers promise, who presently commanded he should
be apprehended and put in close prison: we having thus cauhgt the Lion in ye
snare, my Father questioned me how I would have him used. I would not resolve
on any less penalty then death, my reason least in letting him abroad, he
should fall to his fortunes: the manner of his martyrdom I devised to be famine,
as he intended to us by his leager: my Father yielding him absolutely into my
hands: I prosecuted the matter, causing every day for his greater torment, a
course or two of dainty viands to be carried before the window that looked
into his Chamber, and my self to agrauate his sorrows, would pass often by
his lodging in most pleasant humor. Acestes seeing himself thus overtaken in
his own folly, by trusting too much the tears of a woman, would not exclaim
against the sex, but seeing no way but death, no kind but famine, he resolved
to show an honorable mind in great patience, and so remained their four days,
when, pinched with extreme hunger almost even to death: as Lidia passed by, he
fell into these passions.

Meat, meat, oh for want of meat I perrish: Ah hunger, hunger, the
extremest of all extremeties: were I amongst men, men would pity me: amongst
beasts, beasts should feed me or feed upon me. Amidst ye pikes would I
venterously escape, or valiantly perrish: on the land, I could shift: in the
Sea, I could swim: no place so barren, no people so barberous that would not
relieve me or soon rid me: every where more help, no where less, hope, ah
hunger, hunger, the extremest of all extremities. Thrice cruel Lidia, no
worse I will term thee for that once I loved thee: not suffering me to live,
nor simply to dye: my head is giddy, mine eyes dazell, fallen are my cheeks,
and my tongue die my words, my sinews shrink, my blood consumes, all my
limbs fainte, and my heart fails me: every minute I die, and I with I did but
die: too long am I out of the way, to be well out of the way: Ah hunger,
hunger, the extremest of all extremities.

Ah Liuia, have I deserved thus to be done unto, I gave thee Crowns, and
thou will not give me a crum: I bestowed Kingdoms on thy Father, and he
presents me with famine: thus Love wrought the train, and fortune, nay mine
own folly performed the treason: yet this hope I have, that he has found me,
is he that has fashioned me, who though he scourge me, will yet save me,
how be it my God I cannot but cry, ah hunger, hunger, the extremest of all
extremeties.

What is it I would not rather be, then thus be? then thus, ah then thus in
pined walls to attend so bitter a death? I faint, alas I faint, my hearts
anguish commands my tongues silence: then Acestes silently be patient,
patiently be penitent, penitently perrish, and that last martyrdom will be thy
least misery, because longer thou shall not cry: ah hunger, hunger, the
extremest of all extremeties.

This complaint highly contented Lidia, so that she departed and told it to
her Father, rejoicing that her devised form of death sorted to so bitter
events: well another day past, so hungry grew Acestes, that he greedely fed on
the flesh on his arms, spilling that blood with his own teeth, which before
he had so prisde in many battles: which when he had done, ready to give up
the ghost, seeing the bare bones of his arms, he fell into this last
complaint: Miserable wretch even in the highest degree, miserably with my teeth
have I tired on mine own flesh, till now bloodlesse and famished, my latest
gasp hardly gives passage to a few, and my farewell words, Lidia, ah Lidia,
whereof is thy hard heart formed? that the sting of such diresse cannot pierce
it, have thou the ears of a woman to hear my cries, and not the heart of a
woman to pity my case? Ah Lidia, he that loved thee, for that he loved thee
must die: he that sounded thy praises in sundry Provinces, him have thou pinned
and pined up, till those arms are bare from flesh, that in many battles
bruted thy fame: I will not curse; thou art Lidia, nor exclaim at my last date
thou were my love: nor pray for revenge, since at my death my patience shall
give my soul the better passage. But fondly, how short a time have I to speak
and yet how foolishly I speak, to name my earthly Goddess when I should pray
to my heavenly God: the one has consumed me, the other must save me: now
comes the touch, my heart yeeldes to him that framed it, now the last bitter
sweet pang of death ends what the malice of man has inflicted, and so
falling down, he died.

As soon as I perceived he was dead, not yet content with revenge, I caused
his body to be hanged in chains, that the world might see the trophee of my
cruelty: The manner of his death being known, the Nobles and specially the
Commans began to murmr that so brave a warrior who had made four Kingdoms
tributories to Lidia, should so ingratefully perrish through ye malicious
disdain of a woman, yea, so far it pierced into the heart of Selidon great
Duke of our realm, that suddenly causing a mutiny, he summond most of the
Nobles, and told the^ such a tirant was too heavy for them to bear, to be
short, the Nobles agreed, the Commons of their free will came in flocks to
revenge, so that he had quickly leauied an Army of an hundred thousand men,
and entered into the Castle, took me and my Father prisoners, whom he
commanded to be famished in the same place where Acestes ended his life, there
without remorse we dyed, they took down the body of Acestes, and buried him
with princely funerals, and over his tomb, for that he attempted the revenge:
they crowned Solydor King of Lidia.

AS soon as she had ended her tale, she fell to her wonted cries and shrikes,
not answering to any question, so that I left the place and returned back with
my Harp: Orpheus having thus discoursed, Jupiter asked Venus how the liked of
the tale: marry quoth she, as of one that Orpheus tells, coming out of Hell:
nothing prejudicial to my Dietie, since she was enemy to love, and of so
austere chastity: it rather touches Juno or Diana, the one stately in her
looks, the other too chary in her thoughts: for my part so I dislike of her
disdainful cruelty, as if I might have censured, if possible it might have
been, she should have had a more bitter death upon earth, and a more
pinching pain in hell: Truth quoth Mercury, for perhaps the pain is not so
great to remain in the fogge, as the remembrance how fair once she was, and
now to have all smeared with the smoke: I think when Venus was a maid, she
was more charie of her face then her maidenhead: and more wary of her beauty
then her honesty. These quippes quoth Mars are digressions, but leave Venus
and talk of Lidia, whose life was so strickt, whose heart so opposde to love,
whose thoughts so full of pride and disdain, as her instance serves rather
to be produced for a wonder, then for example to condemn women, since the
world I think contains not one so bad: Apollo smiling said, Well taken Mars
for you own advantage, women must be pleased, and Venus will frown if she be
not flattered: Vulcan sits fast a sleep, or else I would not have spoake so
broad before, but to drink down all the frumps, Ganimede (quoth he) fill in
Nectar, so the Gods from disputing fell to carowsing, and then Arion tuning his
instrument, began to warble out this Ditty.

The Song of Arion.
SEated upon the crooked Dolphins back,
Scudding amidst the purple colored waves:
Gazing aloof for Land, Neptune in black,
attended with the Tritons as his slaves.
Threw forth such storms as made the air thick*
For grief his Lady Thetis was so sick.
Such plaints he throbd as made the Dolphin stay,
women (quoth he) are harbors of man's health:
Pleasures for night, and comforts for the day,
what are fair women but rich natures wealth.
Thetis is such, and more if more may be:
Thetis is sick, then what may comfort me.
Women are sweets that salve men's sowrest ills,
women are Saints, their virtues are so rare:
Obedient souls that seek to please men's wills,
such love with faith, such Jewels women are.
Thetis is such, and more if more may be:
Thetis is sick, then what may comfort me.
With that he diu'd into the Coral waves,
To see his love, with all his watery slaves.
The Dolphin swam, yet this I learned then:
Fair women are rich Jewels unto men.
ARion having ended his Ditty, Apollo said, this falls out fit, for Orpheus
having made the division of a woman's nature to be either too cruel, or too
courteous: Arion stands in his song as well to defend, as he to oppose:
accounting women the wealth of nature, and far more profitable then Orpheus
says they are prejudicial, therefore if it please the rest of the Gods, we will
hear what Arion censures of that sex, they gladly agreed, and Apollo
commanded him to show his opinion, whereupon Arion began thus.

No sooner right mighty Gods, had nature in her curious moulde formed the
counterfeite of Beauty, but looking upon her workmanship, she fell in love
with that metaphysicall excellency, as Pigmalion did with the perfection of his
own Art: which may assure us, that it is most exquisite, wherein curious
nature takes such extreme delight: this glorious Idea drawn out from the
secret temper of the graces nature, bestowed more prodigally upon women then
men, as creatures more worthy and excellent: the richest gold has the rarest
color, the purest stones are most clear, the sweetest Flowers most pleasing
to the eye: and women as the purest quintissence circolated from all other
living things, are therefore the most beautiful and fair: yea in their own
sex, beauty is the touchstone of virtue, and ye fairer a woman is, the fuller
of good conditions: for such as nature has either slipped over with negligence,
or made in her melancholy, so that they are ill favored and deformed either in
face or body: such I hold as a principle to be counted stigmaticall, as noted
by nature to be of a bad constitution: then must we confess that beauty is
excellent, as the pride of nature: divine, as fetched from the Gods: glorious,
as the delight of the eye: pleasing, as the content of the heart: and to be
esteemed above all things, as the very cover and superficies under which virtue
lies hid: if then men seeing such heavenly objects, such sweet Saints, have
their eyes fixed, their minds fettered, their thoughts enchanted with their
loves, are they to be blamed or not? rather to be thought of Heroical
conceit: that place their liking on the foundation of beauty, and to be
counted men of great judgment, that in their desires seek to covnite
themselves to such an excellency: for may not he which enjoys a beautiful
Lady, boast that he possesses at command? by spending a few years in wooing,
some part of his living in expenses, his days quiet in sighs, his nights sleep
in tears, by these toys and a few other passions, he possesses himself of
that creature which the graces and nature had studied many ages to make
excellent: yet there be some such satiricall copes-mates* that spare not to
rail against them, calling them the imperfection of nature, saying beauty is
vanity, and the sign of little honesty, noting women as waspish, froward,
deceitful, toyish, light, sullen, proud, inconstant, discurteous, cruel, and
what not: such as can afford them no better speeches, I would have either made
Euenuches or Esseni or plain Asses, never to be favored of women, but to be
accounted as stoicall companions, unfit to attend on such beautiful and
virtuous creatures: for in my opinion sweet and simple souls: they be
pleasant, open hearted, far from deceit God wot, as bearing all their own
secrets both grave, and yet having many mad and merry tricks to pleasure men,
humble and lowly, submitting themselves to what their friends will lay upon
them: constant, as never to be turned from their opinions: kind enough, and to
be short, as full of excellent qualities, as the precious stone Silex is full
of secret virtue, and this right mighty Gods is my opinion of women: The Gods
smiled at this censure of Arion, and wished him if he could to prove it with an
instance as Orpheus did the contrary: Arion laying by his instrument, and the
Gods being silent, he told his tale to this effect.

Arions Tale.
AFter that Right mighty Gods, the Pirates had heaued me over board, and that
being received upon a Dolphins back, I was safely transported to Loyath, the
King glad of my arrival, as honoring me for that I was counted the most
perfect musition in Thece, and musing at the strangenes of my fortunes: to make
his peers and princes of his land, partakers not only of my melody, but of the
wonder: he proclaimed a general feast, not of volentary but upon command,
that all Dukes, Earls, Barrons, Knights, and other Gentlemen, should with
their wives and children, for the more magnificence be present: which strickt
Edict, was so straightly obeyed of all, that at the day appointed, none failed
to be present: there appeard in the Kings Palace such troops of Lords and
Ladies, as might with their glorious bravery ouercharge the eye with pleasure.
To these the King presented me clad in my rich robe, with mine instrument even
as I sat on the Dolphins back, with the whole discourse of my fortunes: whereat
they were all driven into a wandering admiration, after long gazing on me, as at
a man reserved to some higher or more hateful destiny, they sat down in the
great Hall to dinner: being placed by the King him self and his Son, who
then playde the Marshall of the Hall: the young Prince, whose name was
Philomenes, giving greatest attendance where he saw the fairest Ladies: as
having his eye drawn rather with beauty then chiualry, at last he espied a
lamp that lightened all the rest, or rather disgraced them: as Phebe does the
little fixed Stars: for so far she surpast the other Ladies in excellency,
as she did in dignity: and by birth she was daughter to Pelopidas the Duke, and
great commander in Corinth, this Lady whose name was Argentina was so fair:
as touching the faultles mixture of vermillion flourisht upon Iuory, and so
full of favor for the perfect proportion of the linaments, whereupon this
native color was ouer-dasht, that nature had made beauty abcolute, and beauty
made Argentina the most excellent: Philomenes seeing so heavenly a Nymph,
stood staring on her face, as at a wonder, gazing so long, that Venus seeing
Ceres and Bacchus honored all the rest, thought to arrest the young Prince for
her attendant, so that leuelling Cupids arrow aright, and wishing the boy to
draw home, she pierst Philomenes so deep, that he shrunk and start at the
sudden prick which this inuenomed arrow had tainted him with: feeding thus
his eye, his fancy and his thoughts with contemplation, he lost his stomach
to gorge with the Camelion on the air: sure was that mess where Argentina
sat, to have what attendance the Prince could grace them with: but their
service was so broken and so ill sewed, that either they must conjecture the
Prince to be no cunning seruitor, or else that his heart was on his halfe-penny:
well, dinner being done and the tables taken up, Arion fell to his music,
and the chief Ladies to the measures, Philomenes ringleader of the rout,
singled out the Lady Argentina, who blushing to see the young Prince make
choice of her above the rest, gave such a glory to her face, that Philomenes
all on fire at the sight, had almost forgotte the time of the measure: but
calling his wits together, he led foremost till the music ceast, and then
wringing her by the hand, he whisperd to her thus. I see Madam that all these
Lords and Ladies present, frolic themselves as fitting the time, and feeding
my Fathers delightful humor: my silly self only excepted, who this day giving
mine eyes leave to banquet on your beauty, commanded my stomach to fast and
pray, that my heart which had surfetted on the excellency of love, might find
a courteous Physician: now sweet saint it rests in your favor, whether I
shall triumph as the most happiest, or sorrow as the most miserable. The music
called on to an other measure, so that Philomenes was interrupted, and forced
to tread his task, but as soon as the music gave breathing time, Argentina
beginning her exordium with a blush, made Philomenes this answer.

It seems sir, that it is a merry time, your honor is so well disposed to be
pleasant, singling out a cunning musition. the simplest plain song, that your
descant might seem the more refind. It behooves such as my self to brook ye
frumps of a Prince, and to take them for favors, for Kings words may not
offend, if in wrath, much less in jest: might your handmaide dare to reply, in
my opinion howsoever your eyes have banquetted, your sight is never the worse,
nor they the more satisfied: for your hearts surfeite I will be beadwoman, with
your stomach not in fasting, but pray that your Physician may prove such as
would fit your desires: but my Lord to your last clause, it is unlikely your
mirth depends of my favor, whose favor cannot profit nor disfavor
prejudice, but taking it in jest as your honor profferd it, I pray you for my
part my Lord to be as merry as you please. The instruments sounded, and forward
must Philomenes, who wished Arions strings might crack, that his melody ended,
he might proceed in his prattle. As soon as the music stopped again, the
Prince began thus.

Believe me Lady, if you take my talk for a jest, you have a deeper insight in
my thoughts then my self: for by your divine beauty, (the oath that for the
whole world I would not infringe) so deeply in earnest did I break into my
first passion, that my heart feels far more then my tongue uttered, so
strongly and strangly has love on a sudden vi et armis as they say made
entrance, there where fancy before could have no passage, so that rightly have
thou said Argentina, that though mine eyes and heart surfeited, yet they are
not satisfied: as vowing themselves ever devoted to so excellent a choice:
which if they may possess as it lies in your power, nature by no means may
minister the^ greater content: As Philomenes was ready to wade further in his
discourse, the dance, I know not upon what occasion, brake of, and the old man
calling his son, told the noble men they should hear one of Arions
scholars, whereupon he commanded his son to take the instrument in his hand,
who very nie as skillful as his Master, obeyed his Fathers charge, and glad
that time had given him opportunity to show his cunning before this Goddess,
he began to play, and sung a sonnet to this effect.

Cupid abroad was lated in the night,
his wings were wet with ranging in the rain,
Harbor he sought, to me he took his flight,
to dry his plumes I heard the boy complain.
I opte the door, and granted his desire,
I rose my self, and made the wagge a fire.
Looking more narrow by the fires flame,
I spied his quiver hanging by his back:
Doubting the boy might my misfortune frame,
I would have gone for fear of further wrack.
But what I drad, did me poor wretch betide:
For forth he drew an arrow from his side.
He pierst the quick, and I began to start,
a pleasing wound but that it was too hie,
His shaft procurde a sharp, yet sugared smart,
away he flewe, for why his wings were dry.
But left the arrow sticking in my breast:
That sore I greeude I welcomd such a guest.
PHilomenes having ended his song, they all generally commended the skill of
the young Prince, but especially Argentina, who hearing him sing both sweetly
and passionately, was charmed as if she had heard the Sirens, that while all
the other walked abroad, she fained herself not well, and withdrew solitary
into her Chamber, where alone, she began to ruminate in her memory all the
perfections of Philomenes, as well the sweenes of his face, ye proportion of
his body, as the virtues and qualities of the mind: his courage, his comlines,
his dignities, but there she stopped and gave a sigh, as being a prince too high
for her to gaze at, meditating thus: she so swallowed up the potions yt Venus
had tempred with her sorcery, as drunk with his beutie, she began to fall with
herself into this parle.

Unhappy Argentina, whose youth virtue has brideled with chaste thoughts,
whose years beauty inchaunteth with fond looks, resembling the nettle, which
may be handled in the bud, but stingeth in the flower: do thy virtues increase
like the pace of a Crab, backwarde? Have thou in thy cradle been continent, and
will thou in thy sadle be impudent? art thou come to this feast to buy folly?
know thou not that Venus stands by the wine press of Bacchus, and breathes
her venom upon his liquor? satst thou down pleasant and must thou rise
passionate? I and in love Argentina? and why not in love? was I not framed for
love? are not Women's hearts the Exchequour where fancy yields up his accounts:
yes Argentina, and fear not to love, for if thy choice be right made, there
can nothing come for marriage but honor: but with whom art thou in love? with
Philomenes the Kings Son and heir apparent to the Diadem of Corinth, a
step higher Argentina then it becomes thee to tread a degree far above
thy fortunes, a star to high for thee to gaze at. Kings as they are men before
the gods, so are they gods before men: such high personages as we must honor
with our looks, not attempt with our loves: Why but Argentina he loves thee,
he is inamored of thy beauty, he sues with words, and intreates with his
eyes: What then: cannot such great Princes be sooner pensick then passionate:
wear favor in their mouths, when they have flattery in their hearts: Does
not love hang in their eye-lyddes, which as it is taken in with every look, so
it is shaken off with every wink: is not their fancies like the Summers dew,
which scarce wetteth the grass before it be dried up with the Sun? take
heed Aagentina, Princes have liberties and privileges, they can laugh out
faults, which we must pay with pennalties: We hold Venus for a Goddess,
they never offer her incense nor sacrifice: and yet they no sooner crave, but
she is ready to grant: yea but has sworn ah fond fool, Periuria ridet
Amantum Jupiter: Lovers oaths are like fetters made of glass that glister
fair, but couple in restraint: if swearing had made love perfect, Carthage had
possessed Eneas for their King: Phillis had not hanged her self, nor Medea said
Deteriora sequor, yet men must be credited, else shall love be a shadow: talked
of, but not put in execution: all are not Sons to Anchisis, nor brothers to
Jason, nor traitors like Demophon: Philomenes face bewraies his faith, and me
thinks his looks contain loyalty: Thus poor wench do I persuade my self to
the best, whereas perhaps he means but to sport with me to make trial of my
wit, well if it be so, I will endeavor to love him less the^ I do, but if he
mean truth, I will labor to love him more then I have done: and with this she
rested content, and went abroad to find out the rest of the Ladies. Argentina
had not served her self thus in secret, but Philomenes was as solitary: for
getting himself up into his Study, then setting down his head on his hand, and
his elbow on his book, he began thus to debate with himself. Philomenes thou
have read much and reapt little, that at one look have learnd more, the^ in
seven years study thou could discover: Hermes told thee that beauty was a
star, whose influence had sundry effects, this was Allegorical, and thou did
only pass it over for a principle. Auicen said that love was a fury, how did
thou esteem of this but as an axiom: Epictetus called Venus the restless
planet, thou tookest this for a dart: and Amphibological Aphorism comments
thou had none, and conceive thou could not: but now if Hermes, Auicen, or
Epictetus want interpreters, let amorous Scholars be auditors to my precepts:
for I have found beauty a star, and have gazd against it: Love is a fury for it
is full of passions, and Venus a restless star, for since the Goddess
distilled into my thoughts her precious Balms, the opperation has been so
mighty, as my greatest rest has been restless disquiet, what need these
ambigues, this schollerisme, this foolery, thou art in love with Argentina, the
co^manders daughter of Corinth, a Duke, but thy Subject: why then do thou
use preambles and protestations? can thou not say flatly I am in love, Venus
Cofers when they have the greatest found, are always most empty: and lovers
when they prattle most, are thought either great talkers, or deep flatterers:
then Philomenes discover thy mind, Argentina is a woman, and therefore to be
wooed, and so to be won: Kings may command, where poor men cannot entreat: it is
better to name a crown then to write a Letter: an ounce of give me, is worth a
pound of hear me: the name of Queen is a great argument, and therefore fear
not: thou have as much to be liked, as she to be loved. Thus far well
Philomenes, but suppose she has already settled her affection, and has made
choice of some other: seek not to divert her, for she that is faithles to one,
will be constant to none, if thou love her, wish her not to be disloyal, but
rather paune thy life, then disparage her honor, and wrestle with Love, whom if
thou subdue: thou exteemst a glorious conquest. In this resolution he flung out
of his chamber, and passing into the privy Garden, there he found all the
Ladies sparfeled abroad in sundry borders, some gathering flowers, others in
discourses of the excellency of the place, some in prattle with the birds, all
busy, none idle: taking thus a superficial view of them all, as having his eye
wandering for a fairer object: he passed forward to find out if it might be the
Lody Argentina, whom he spied with her mother in a shady walk of the Garden:
seeing non but the^ two, thither went Philomenes and saluted them in this
manner: Honorable Duchess, well accompanied with your fair daughter, the Mother
happy for bearing so sweet a creature, and Argentina fortunate in coming from
such a parent: your walking in this shady Arbor resembles Latona, tripping
with her train, Diana in the Lamns, where having her self tried the forwardnes
of Esculapius her husband: she schoold her daughter, so that Diana vowed
perpetual chastity: I hope Lady that ye Duke Pelopidus, brooks not company with
Esculaus, and therefore you need not nusle up your daughter in such heresy:
The Duchess hearing the young Prince so pleasant being her self a Lady of merry
disposition, made him this answer. Lord Pilomenes, were I Latona indeed and as
waspish in mind, as ready as she to revenge: I would cause Phoebus to chastise
your frumps as he did the sons of Mobae, in loding my back with such reverence,
and my daughter with such beauty, to your strange supposition, as far as
Pelopides differs from Esculapius: so far was mine from Latonas persuasion, so
believe me sir, if Roses be not gathered in the bud, they either wither or
prove windfalls: Maids must be married, least they be marred: if they be coy
and swear chastity, they often wish and will with secrecy, youth is the subject
of love, and Siens that are grafted young, have the surest joints, therefore so
far am I from that austere perverseness of some mothers, that as young as
Argentine is, if there were a man whom she could love and we like of, they
should never break off for years. Philomenes hearing how the Duchess desembled
not, began thus to reply: and what manner of man should he be that might both
content you and please your daughter? the one measuring by age, the other be
youth: I would have him, quoth the Duchess, to be of age answerable to my
daughters years, and his pare^tage proportioned to his parentage, least
inequality of time or birth might breed mischief, his personage such as might
feed her eye, his virtues such as might plese us both, his living answearable
to all these, and him would I count a fit husband for Argentina. A right
conclusion quoth Philomenes, for there is no match yt is right made if pelf
conclude not the premises: if he had ye age of Adon, the honors of Hercules, ye
proportion of Theseus, the virtues of yeboy, yet si nil attuleris ibis Homere
for as, if he have not living, al his love is laid in ye dust: but what say you
Arge^tina, in faith let me as your gostly father, have you at shrift before
your mother, tell me were you never in love: Argentina blushed and was silent, as
one that durst not be bold before her mother: whereupon Philomenes said, see
Madam, it is your presence makes your daughter so squemish, I pray you pratle
with some other of the Ladies, and give us leave a little to be secret here in
this walk, perhaps I will be a suter to your daughter, what say you Madam, shall
I have your good will? I, and my good word my Lord quoth she, if you meant
earnestly: and with that smiling she went her way and left them to themselves:
Philomenes seeing himself thus alone with his Goddess, thought to take hold
of her mothers last words and from the^ to drive his insinuation thus.

You hear sweet Saint how favorably your Mother speaks, now Madam what
censure shall I have at your hands? I cannot paint out many passions, not tell
tales with such large periods as many use to do, but I will court thee and woo
thee in one word, and that is Argentina I love thee, more I cannot promise, and
so much I will perform by the faith of a Prince: Argentina seeing Philomenes
speak so plainly, and therefore as she thought so faithfully made this answer:
my Lord, you take the antecedent of my mothers answer for a fouor, but you
leave out the consequent: and that is if you mean in earnest, for I cannot
think you grace would look so low as upon Argentina, but rather gaze at some
glorious princess, whose Majesty might match Juno, whose worthiness Pallas,
whose beauty venus, and with these might bring for her dowry a Diadem: but? and
with that Argentina staid and blushed: which Philomenes espied, and therefore
wringing her by the hand said: but, what Madam, nay forward with the rest or
you proffer me great wrong: why then my Lord, quoth she, and with that she
gald him with a glance: but if your honor would vouchsafe to favor such a
simple maid, as from a mean Lady to make her a Queen: for other the^ marriage
I dare swear your Lordship does not intend: your Father gracing our loves
with his Kingly consent, though I could not with love sufficient request love:
as in person and parentage unfit for your highness, yet would I with obedience
and humility make supply of these defects which otherwise were wanting. This
answer of Argentina so contented Philomenes, as that he stood as a man in a
trance, at last he took her hand in his, and swore, that before the feast
were ended he would make her princess of Corinth, let this suffice Argentina,
quoth. he, and with that he sealed up the bargain with a kiss, and walked
toward her Mother, to whom he delivered Argentina thus: Madam here I deliver
your daughter as safe as I received in outward appearance, but how I have
schoold her, time will make trial, perhaps we have struck the match, and
therefore let the Lord Pelopidus provide a good dowry, and with that he went
his way: when the matter comes to that effect my Lord, you shall have a
dukedom with her: at that the Prince turned back and said, that's mine already,
and her Father is like to be my subject, and so to hold his living in chief:
the Duchess smilde, and thus they parted. But leaving Philomenes to the King
his Father, who having noted as narrowly as his son, the beauty of Argentina,
had great lyking of the Lady, so that he made inquiry of those which were
Pelopidus nearest neighbors, what disposition the virgin was of, they all
affirmed to the King that she was so virtuous, humble, courteous, and adorned
with such excellent qualities, as the form of her life was a method whereby
other Gentlewomen did direct their actions. The King hearing this, resolved in
his mind there could not be a fitter match for his Son, whereupon
determining to break with the young Prince, as he was in this humor, he met
Philomenes whom he took aside, and began to question him as concerning
Argentina, whether he could fancy the Lady or no. Philomenes afraid the King
had espied their loves, made answer, that he never took such narrow view of
her that he could yield his judgment with affection: then do quoth. the King,
and give me within two days an answer, and so he departed. Philomenes joyful
of this, no sooner met Argentina, but he told what motion his Father had made,
but to make a small harvest of a little crop: Philomenes at the two days end so
answered his Father, that the King breaking with the Duke, it was concluded
that the end of the feast should be the beginning of ye marriage, which was
such a joy to the nobles to see their young Prince allied in his own Land, that
they devised new Iustes and pastimes, continuing the feast many days to their
great joy, and the Lovers most happy content: The marriage and the feast thus
finished, the Nobles departed, Pelopidus leaving his daughter thus honorably
espoused, took this leave, the married couple staying still with the old King in
his Court, who being of great age, lived not long after, but paid his debt
unto nature, so that Philomenes was crowned King of Corinth: Living thus
happily with his wife Argentina, thinking his degree too high for Fortune to
prejudice, it so fell out, that Marcion the King of Sycilia, hearing that his
ancient enemy Philomenes father was dead, thought to try what metal was in
the son, to prove if he were as valiant and fortunate as his father, therefore
he leauied a great Army and provided a great fleet to sail to Corinth, which
was no sooner rigged but he imbarqued his men, and as soon as wind and weather
would permit, sailed toward Corinth, where arriving in a Desert place, as
politic to land without any great resista^ce: he vnshipt his men, and all his
furniture for war: and letting his Navy ride in the road, he marched forward
into the maine land, using as one yt intended a conquest, fire and sword,
Philomenes hearing by Posts how Marcion was landed with a mighty Host, and
had spoiled many of his provinces, started up, and summoning his Lords about
him, raised a mighty host, such as never King of Corinth did before him, and
with the^ marched to meet with Marcion, whom he incountred by the River yt
runs by the great plains called the Corinth downs: then pitching his
pauilion, he entrenched his Army, and so had Marcion fortified his: lying thus
a while, at last by Heralts they resolved upon a day of battle, which once
come and both the Armies rangd: they joined battle so furiously, the one to
co^quer, the other to defend: Philomenes heart made one with equity, the other
with despair, that a long while ye fight was doubtful, till at last fortune
allotted the best to Marcion, in such sort that the field was his, the
Corinthians most slain, some fled, the King valiantly fighting, taken
prisoner: Marcion triumphing in the victory, marched forwards to the City
leading Philomenes as his Captive: coming to the gates, ye Citizens yielded
up the keys, and he as a valiant conqueror entered, and passing into the
palace, found there the Queen all blubbred with fears, as a woman almost
senseless, whom he comforted and committed to ye custody of one of his Duke:
seated thus victoriously in Corinth, he not only disgraded the King from all
dignity, but disrobing him, commanded that he should be turned out of the
palace, and that he should not be relieved upon pain of death, but if he
would have any thing to satis-fie his thirst, he should get it with his
handythrift: Philomenes not abashed at this doom, entreated the King to be
good to his wife, and so went and became a labourer for day wages, contented
with this fortune: Marcion the next day sent for the Queen, who although
forlorn with tears, yet nothing her narrowly, he found her the fairest
creature that ever yet in his life he had viewed, so that he fell extremely in
love with her, and offered her what lyberty or pleasure she would have,
courting her with many fair promises and amorous conceits, but all in vain,
for she was resolved whatsoever fell, life or death, yt none to her but her
love Philomenes: Marcion captiuated in her beauty, was restless, feeling such
strange and uncouth passions, that at last he fell into these terms.

What fond motions Marcion are these that disturb thy mind? what childish
thoughts unfit for a king, a soldier, nay for one that has conquered both a
Crown and kingdom: thou camst from Sycilia to be victor, and here thou art
arrived and not vanquished, thou have beaten Philomenes in battle, and art
brought under by his wife in love, thy resolution was to terrify thy foes with
thy sword, so thou have don, but feign to please a woman with thy tongue: by
this fond foolery I may note, yt Venus frown is of more force then the weapons
of Mars, that affections are harder to be suppressed then enemies to subdue: that
love is above King and keiser, where Cupid commands, there dignity has no
privilege to withstand: then Marcion yield, sue and entreat, but whom, the
wife of Philomenes thy captive, rather command her, and what she will not
yield by entreaty, take by constraint: in so doing should I reap infamy, and
forced love is never sweet: no Marcion allure her with wealth, promise she
shall be thy paramore, to seat her next thy self in thy kingdom, women are won
with favors, and there is none so chaste but time and gifts may entice. In this
resolution he sent for Argentina, and began thus to deliver his mind unto
her. Thus see Argentina, how I have favored thee, no like a Princess that
were captive, but even as a Queen that is sole mistres and sovereign of my
affections, thy beauty has conquered that heart which had made conquest of thy
Country, and subdued him who before, woman's feature never vanquished: then
Argentina take pity of him that for thy love is so passionate, consent that I
may enjoy thee as my paramour, and thou shall be honored as she that is best
loved of the King of Sycilia, I could Argentina y^ see obtain by force what
I sue for by entreaty: but I covet rather to possess my self of thy lovely
consent, then by constraint: yield therefore what I request, and here before
the Lords of Sycilia, I promise to grant whatsoever thou shall command, so it
touch not my Crown nor thy Husband, though to the danger of my person, freely
without exception: Argentina as one nothing dismayed, returned him this answer:
I not deny Marcion thou have subdued Corinth, and deposed the King, which I
attribute rather to his bad fortunes, then thy prowess or chivalry, but in
all thy conquest thou shall never boast thou have conquered either Philomenes
or his wife Argentina, seeing we are only ouercom, not vanquished: in that both
of us remain contented, and keep our minds untouched: thou art inchaunted with
my love, no Marcion, but perhaps thou art fed with lust, and never hope that
Argentina will minister any means to appease the flame: although thou should
enforce her to consent by the most extreme torments: Philomenes lives, and so
long will and love: not thee, but him whom I vowed to be true unto for ever: yet
thy last condition has somewhat persuaded me, that if thou grant what I
request, I will consent not only to be thy paramour but thine for ever: the
king was so glad of this, that he iterated with an oath to perform her
demauud: then this it is quoth Argentina: Tomorrow morning thou shall shut thy
self into a secret place, whereof my self will keep the key, and there for
three days thou shall fast, without tasting any thing so aslake hunger or
thirst: this time thou shall pray to the Gods for the remission of our sins
which we shall offend in by breach of matrimony, then at the term of three days
thou shall freely take the use of my body before thou eat any meat, otherwise
if thou fail but as much as Proserpina to taste a grain of the pomgranet,
thou shall never after question me of love: thus do, and I grant to like thee,
or else here is my head, let that pay my raunsom: Marcion was so setted in her
beauty, that he thought it nothing to undertake this task, and therefore
promised before his Lords to fast three days, and then to lie with her before
he eat any meat, or else never to motion her any more of love: whereupon the
next day the Princess shut him up till the date was expired, in which three
days he felt such torments, such pinching hunger and extreme thirst, that he
cursed love, and exclaimed against beauty as a charm yt made men senceles,
willing to give for one crum the Diadem of Corinth* well the term expired, all
the Nobles were assembled and sat in the great hall, expecting what event should
fall either of ye kings fast, or of Argentinas request: at last Argentina sent
the key to one of the Lords, that the king might come into the Hall whether she
presently would repair: the Lord went to the chamber door and no sooner put
the key to the lock, but Marcion started up and cried for meat, the Lord
unlocked and saw the king glance at him with such a fierce look, that he was
afraid and started back: villain quoth Marcion, have thou brought me any meat,
and with that running as a mad man into the hall, flinging in fury among the
Lords: Why Gentiles (quoth he) sit you here without meat? why are not the
tables spread? do I allow such niggardly allowance, or will you famish him that
fostereth you all? At this he was in a rage, Argentina apparailed in her
richest robes, came pacing, that she looked more like an Angel, then a mortal
creature, insomuch that every eye directed their glaunces at so heavenly an
object, except Marcion, who at her sight sat as a man greatly amated: having
her maid follow her with a dish of meat crumd: Argentina with a smiling
countenance taking him by the hand, said thus.

Redoubted Conqueror, according to promise I am come in the presence of these
Lords to offer my self subject to your highness pleasure, ready to go whither
your grace shall conduct me: Marcion at this cried out, and think thou
Argentina that famisht men have mind on beauty, or is hunger to be satisfied
with love? no, no, it is true Marcion, Sine Cerere and baco friget Venus, reason
could not subdue lust, but fasting has set it on a non plus: but what is that
the maid carries? meat my Lord quoth she for your honor after, and with that
she blushed: Marcion no sooner heard her name meat, but he leapt to the maid,
pulled away the dish, saying: farwell fond love, and welcome that whereof one
morsel is worth a monarchy, Argentina give me leave to eat, for thou have
conquered Marcion in his own folly, and with that he fell to his meat, wherewith
after he had somewhat appeased his hunger, sitting him in his seat royal, he
began to parle with his Lords of Argentinas policy, highly extolling the
constancy of so true a wife, and so far entered into consideration of the
chance of fortune, and fall of Princes, that rising from his throne, he went
and embraced and kissed Argentina, not only praising her for her ready invention
to persuade him from his vanity, but for her sake sent for her husband, and
yielded him his Crown and his Kingdom, and living his sworn friend, returned
home into Sycilia.

NO sooner had Arion ended his tale, but Mars taking opportunity, said: we see
by this event, that as women have their vanities whereby to be checked, so they
have their virtues redounding greatly to their praise: being both affable and
constant, although that single instance of Orpheus his Lidia did infer the
contrary: And so quoth Apollo would Venus serve for an instance if you mean of
constancy, for no doubt if you may be judge, al beauty shall be virtue, and all
women shall be Saints: and now quoth Jupiter, Apollo by your leave to take Mars
his part, we often rightly to think of women, seeing so often we seek their
favors, and speak to them by entreaties for their loves, otherwise we should
prove our selves very ingrate: to beat the^ with rods, that feast us with
banquets, to proffer them Scorpions that gives us no worse then their own
selves: Lively spoken quoth Mercury, but Juno likes you never the better for
this flattery, as supposing you have sued to more then contented her, or
becommed you: but in my opinion, Arions tale paints out a paragon, a matchles
mirror, as well for constancy, as the other for cruelty: these extremes
therefore infer no certain co^clusions, for they leave a mean between both,
wherein I think the nature of women do consist, neither so cruel but they will
grant, nor so constant but they will yield, and rather oft-times prove too
courteous then too unkind: See quoth Mars how peeuishly you conclude, to taunt
them still of inconstancy: well Mercury, quoth he, thou art subtle, and can
by thy fallacions prove what thou will: but yet this I set down for mine own
opinion, that women the more beautiful they are, the more courteous, the more
constant, ye fuller of excelent qualities: and rather virtues, and by the River
of Stycks I swear, and with that he rose in a choler, this I will approve
against him that dare maintain the contrary: though not with my pen, yet my
sword: at this the Gods smild, and Mars in such a rage clapped his hand on the
board: that I awoke, not knowing what became of the Gods or of Arions soul,
only I remembered their tales.

BEing thus awakt, I looked about me, and still sat my Shepherd: how now good
fellow, quoth I, have I not taken a lusty nap? thy Pipe sounded so sweetly, and
there I had such a dream as I would not have lost for much, for I hope it will
after more profit me then all my iourny, I have past to Erecinus: I am glad
quoth the Shepherd, my pipe did thee so much pleasure, and if thy slumber has
presented thee any visions, note them, for all dreams that men see in Erecinus,
prove true: and with that standing up, me thought he had wings on his head,
shoulders, and feet: he bad me farewell, and took his flight: then I knew it
was Mercury. Whereupon, calling to mind the occasion of my journey: I found
that either I had lost love, or love lost me: for my passions were eased, I
left Erecinus and hasted away as fast as I could, glad that one dream had rid
me of fancy, which so long had fettred me, yet could I not hie so fast, but ere
I could get home, I was overtaken with repentance.

FINIS.
