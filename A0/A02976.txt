The French Kings letter sent to the people of Artois and Henault requesting
them to remove the forces gathered by the King of Spain from the borders of
France, otherwise denouncing open war.
Masters and friends, it is a thing honorable, and the duty of a worthy and
indeed a Christian prince, to spare shedding of man's blood, and to reppresse
the afflicting of innocent people, as much as he may. In consideration whereof
God having made us to be descended of a very famous, courageous and Christian
race even as the Kings our predesessors have excelled in godliness and
virtue, so we imitating them, are desirous to crown our actions and our reign
with excelling glory: We therefore will not only call to witness Gods divine
majesty, who is the alone searcher of the hearts of Princes, but we are
content also, (depending on nothing but on Gods help and our own sword) to
make all the world judge together of our cause: and among other we appeal to
you, who can best judge, and ought rightly to censure, being our nearest
neighbors, and such as have more knowledge of the right of our matters than
all other.

You know that about five years past, God by his holy providence having put the
scepter of France in our hands, by lawful succession, he charged us
immediately with maintaining the iustest quarrel that ever prince in the world
could undertake, binding us to pursue the revenge and punishing of a most
execrable murder and parricide committed on the person of the deceassed King
(our most honorable and Sovereign Lord and brother, of most christian memory)
and to defend our royal patrimony against the ambition and rebellion of those
which would have usurped the same, who afterward spared not any means that
might be to have obtained their purpose. And albeit that ever since we have
had both courage, and the same right and ability that we now have, to revenge
our selves upon ye countries and subjects of the King of Spain (the principal
author and enterpriser of this war) yet being holden back by many
considerations of great importance to al Christendom, we have chose rather to
bear much, defending our selves but simply, than to set upon those forcibly,
to whom we could peradventure, have procured and done as much hurt as we have
received at their hands: but hoping to win them or moderate them in the end,
through our sufferance, and the equity of our cause, which was approved and
warranted of God by many special graces and conquests that it pleased God to
grant us over our enemies, yet the eagernes and stomachfulnesse of the King of
Spain and of his adherents has been such, even since our turning to the
Catholic Romish religion, that perceiving the chief Cities and the
principal Lords of our Realm, who had before made war against us, to have
now sworn all fidelity and obedience: yet notwithstanding, in steed of doing
as the duty of peace and of good neighborhood (couenanted by our predecessors
to be between our crowns, countries and subjects) did will him to have done:
every man knows, how he has still maintained and openly set on fire the
obstiuate indenours of the residue of our traitors, has battered our forts,
put our subjects to ransom, has prepared and gathered together from all
parts forces and armies, for to enter afresh into our realm, and only for our
sake labors to destroy the town of Cambray and the country of the
Cambresians, using against us, our friends, seruauts, and subjects, all deeds
of an open euemy. Which thing being so, as we cannot nor will not any longer
forbear the protection that we owe our subjects and our self. We have also
determined to repel the injuries and offenses which we receive by the same
means that they are offered us. But calling to mind the old love and
affection of kings our predecessors toward you, and your good will and duty
yielded to them, and moreover it being manifest that you be a little faulty of
this war, you must endure the chiefest and most fierce assaults, when it shall
be open war. We have been willing to dayn of the proclamation hereof for your
sakes for to give you to understand that, if you can so handle the matter to
obtain that the army gathered together near our fronters, by commandemtnt of
the King of Spain (by whom shall be no less annoied than we doubt to be) may
be removed far from us, and will assure and promise us, that they shall not
enterprise any hurt against us, our subjects and countries, the City of
Cambray and the country of the Cambresians nor that they shall not favor our
traitors: then will we not go forward with our proclamation of war, so as we
may see the same take effect between this and the first day of the next year.
But, if this be not done we shall be constrained for the reasons aforesaid,
to proclaim and make open war against the King of Spain, his subjects, and
countries that shall abide by him and aid him in the same war, like as the
kings our predesessors have done upon the like occasions: Protesting before
God and his holy angels, that we shall be very sorry therefore in regard of the
evil that we foresee like to ensew unto Christendom. For avoiding of which,
we have don that a Prince loving the weal of Christendom and to live in
concord with his neighbors, could have done. You shall receive this present
writing one of our trumpets, by whom if you shall delay to make answer, or by
some other within the time appointed, we will take it as we hear from you. So
we pray to God to keep you.

From Amiens the xvij. of December. 1594.
THE Kings Proclamation.
A declaration of the French kings proclaming open war against the king of
Spain and his adherents, with the causes him moving thereto.
THere is no man in this Realm, nor that knows any thing of the realm but
knows, how the king of Spain not having been able to make open war, and
so to destroy France (which God has protected and defended with the Kings
thereof, of happy memory, the said kings being still aided by their good
loyal subjects) has raised up and set on fire dissentions and parts taking
in the same, whereby he thought to bring the realm to utter ruin: and yet do
the same dissentions greatly trouble the realm. For his hatred toward us and
his covetousness, have been so vehement, that not only he has spent and
bestowed many large sums of money: employed and wasted his principal forces
and Armies, even so far, that he left his own countries unfurnished: but
also he has enterprised under a color of godliness and religion, to attempt
openly for to inuegle from time to time, natural Frenchmen, to abandon their
loyalty due to their liege princes, and Sovereign Lords (a practice always
wondered at of all nations in the world) he still seeking to get the crown of
this noble realm for himself, or for his.

Which matter he began to attempt immediately after the decease of king Frances
the second, and has ever since continued the same by diverse means sought,
still triumphing and abusing the minority of our kings. But he especially
manifested the same, and made it plainly to appear, a little before the end
of the reign of king Henry the third deceassed, of most christian memory, in
the year one thousand five hundred fourscore and five: for the Frenchmen then
enjoying, wholly and quietly, Religion, Justice, the kings great fauonr, and
general rest, and being like, nay assured to continue in this happy estate to
their own content: the K. of Spain even then under false forged shows went
about to fill all the Realm with fire, bloodshed, and extreme desolation,
arming the Catholics one against another; yea and against as Catholic a
king as ever reigned.

Whereupon followed his woeful death, which will bleed continually in the hearts
of those that are right Frenchmen: besides other murders spoils and miseries
which we have suffered: under the heavy burden of which, France and Frenchmen
have and should have been brought to yield themselves, yea to have suffered
perpetual shipwreck, had not the singular grace of God (which never fails
his) given to our K. and sovereign Lord now force and valor to defend
coragiouslie, the right of his cause with our liberties, goods, lives, houses
and honors: and to bring to naught the unjust purposes of the said king of
Spain and his confederates, to his shame and their confusion.

So that France may now be in hope to recover the former happy estate, to the
glory of God, under obedience of the kings royal majesty, if every body will
be ready to yield thereto his faithful endeavor, and his majesty employing
also the same means and remedies, that other kings his predecessors have in
times paste practiced, for to defend the realm against the ancient enemies
thereof. Which matter considered by his majesty, together with the tender care
he has of maintaining religion, his own credit, the defense and protection
of his subjects, whereof he makes more reckoning than of his own life, as he
has often hazarded willingly, and is still ready to hazard his life for
their good: for neither the kings turning to the same religion with the
Spaniarde about three years since, nor the present danger that threatens all
christendom (which every man knows to have risen through the discords, and
just gelousie that the king of Spain his ambition has bred every where: none
of these things could moderat his malicious mind against this realm, the kings
majesty's person, his good and faithful subjects, the people of Cambray, whom
his majesty has taken into his protection, against whom the king of Spain
and his people use all hostility daily continually assaulting them violently
on every side, battering and taking towns, leading away prisoners, putting
them to ransom, killing his subjects, raising taxes and fines upon them, and
dealing in all things as a sworn enemy: yea so far, as he has caused
attemptes to be made of taking away his Majesty's life, by trecheries and
villainous detestable means: as appeared not many days past: and worse had it
happened, to the great woe of France, had not God the true protector of kings,
wonderfully turned aside that horrible stroke, offered by the hand of a
Frenchman (an abominable and monstrous matter) but driven to that act by a
spirit most void of humanity and indeed Spaniardlike, even against the kings
sacred majesty.

The king therefore hereupon gives notice to all those unto whom it shall
appertain: that he will no longer forbear the maintaining of his honor, the
protection of his subjects to who^ he is bound, and of the people of Cambray
(whose part he would defend, though he did yet longer with patience forbear
the going forward with the attempts) seeing those of Artoys and Henault make
small account (to the grief of his majesty) of exhortations that he by his
letters was about to make them, that they should put to their helping hand
with him, to turn away or appease the fury of war, raised by the said
Spaniards, being no less noisome and pernicious to those of Artoys and
Henault, than to his subjects:) he has determined and is resolved, from
henceforth to make open war against the said king of Spain, his subjects,
vassals and countries, for to be revenged upon them, of wrongs, injuries and
offenses, that he and his have sustained at their hands, like as other kings
his predecessors have done upon the like occasions: undoubtedly trusting that
God who knows the secrets of his heart, and the equity of his cause, will
alwaie assist him with his divine power, and will bless him and make him
prosper and al his army, with the help of his good subjects.

In regard whereof the kings majesty commands and most straightly enioyneth
al his said subjects, vassals and servants, to make war hereafter against the
said king of Spain, by sea, and by land, and against his countries, subjects
vassals and adherentes, as against enemies to the kings person and his realm:
and for the accomplishing hereof, that they go with forces in to his said
countries, to assault and surprise towns, Fortes, and places that are under
his obeisance: and there to levy taxes, fines and ransomes: To take his
subjects and servants prisoners and put them to ransom, and to deal with them
like enemies, even as they do and would do with his Majesty's subjects and
friends. Therefore his Majesty has forbidden, and does by these presents
streitly prohibit and forbid, all manner of communication, intercourse of
Merchandise, giving intelligence, company keeping, or dealing with the said
king of Spain, his adherents, Servants and Subjects, upon pain of being
taken and adjudged Traitors: He has also revoked, and does by these presents
revoke all licenses, pasports, and safe conducts given and granted by his
majesty, or by his Lieutenants general or other, being contrary to this
present decree, declaring them hereby to be of no value, forbidding them to be
holden of Magistrates as things of no regard, after fifteen days expired
after the publishing of this decree.

Which decree he has therefore caused to be proclaimed with sound of
Trumpette, and public Proclamation throughout the Provinces and frontiers of
the Realm, to the end that none may pretend ignorance, but that every one
may observe and put the same inexecution, upon pain of disobedience.
