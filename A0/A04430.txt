Our savior Jesus Christ has not ouercharged his church with many ceremonies.

The Lord shall knit up his mind in few words for our rightwise making /
eue^ by faith only to be justified.

Esaye. x. M.D.XLIII. in Febru.

IT behooves / and it is necessary also: That every Christen man know and
believe / owr lord Jesus Christ not to have ouercharged his church with over
many ceremonies / rites / laws and precepts. And also to know which be the
principal lessons / doctrines / and precepts all ready in nowmbre / concerning
the very trwe worship of god / and owr christen religion: whereby the
co^gregacio^ of christ is so perfytely and sufficiently enstruct / that we can
/ ne ought not to seek for / or desyer any more.

PAul / the chosen vessel of God / writing unto his disciple Timothe /
prophesied that in the later days / there should be men all for them selves /
the lovers of them selves / and of no man else / couetuouse / stout / stobborne
/ and proud / which will be seen to have a glittering show of godliness: ij.
Timothe.iij.
but they will renownce the pithey power and effect thereof. And the thing it
self they utterly deny and reiecte. And therefore be they ever lerning / and
never comen to the knowledge of the trowthe. And even this same prophecy / many
of us read it / but all we under stand it not: as trwely in these owr days /
as in time paste to be fulfilled. For the laws concerning the welthe /
governance / and good order of the church / they are now fermely decreed and
set fast / and to morrow unmade and marred agene / they are treated and
refracted / acted and vnacted / then they reason for the reformacion of the
church / and of the manner of the reformacion thereof / whether this manner or
way ought to be directely or vndirectely / tolerable / just or absolutely /
aperte / plain / or by colowr covertly brought to pass. And it is so subtyly
disputed and so craftily handled / that there is no manner nor mesure / non end
/ nor no certaynte / form nor fasshio^ of their wavering laws / inco^stante
acts / crafty counsels / forewritinges / afterwritinges / opinions / doctrines
/ sentences and minds. There were once wryte^ great and many broad books of
their decrees / decretalles Clementines and addicions / extrauaga^tes wandering
far beyend and out of the trwthe. Who is able to nowmbre and recyte the books
/ laws and sentences of all them that wrote for popes and papists pleasurs?
Who ca^ tell us all the acts of parlementes / ordinances / and institucions of
counsels and bisshops in their owen diocesses? By the which / all the people
of God has be^ so combred / snarled / tied and perplexed / that they strongly
and stoutely did learn / yea and that alweys at all times / and yet could they
never come unto the just knowledge of the trwthe. Yea thou shall find even
among the people many that abhor and deteft these said holy popes decrees /
laws etc^ / as roten / stinking running sores. And as touching the doctrine of
the gospel / whiles these lawers and scolemen study these decrees and scole
matter / they find nothing in it ferme nor certain (their judgment is so
corrupt) nor obtain they any godly fruit for their salvation / but poison and
corrupcion of their owen souls / and of their judgment. But yet they learn
stoutely these deuillisshe antichristen decrees and laws etc^ / and never
come they unto any good and perfect end of any good learning / so that their
minds may be satisfied and at rest in guyette / their selves never having
in any just nowmbre the chief articles and principal points of the trwe
religion. Wherefore that it might apere / eue^ but to mean learned and simple
wits / owr lord Jesus not to have onered / burdened and charged his church
with any constitucions and rytes / either heuye or many / or obscure derke / or
hard / or unable to be expressed / but that tharticles of owre faith (whereby
the faythefull ar made perfet) be sewe and sone told: we shall lay forth
these things which the lord has delivered to us / and which be ower
articles in brief sum / where with his church is content and fynissed. But
let no man think this matter to be longer in telling / then that it may be but
in few words fynished. For the treatese of the trwthe and religion is content
with very few words / nothing regarding nor requiring any curiouse and
laborouse loquacite or long babbling. I therefore shall endeavor my self
syncerely so to treat this matter so profitable and necessary / that not with
out great fruit this would be read and herd.

That our Lord Jesus has not onered his church / but subdewed it unto a
pleasant yoke of a sweet seruitute / him self witnesses in Math. xi. sayi^g.
The lord has not ouercharged his church.
All thingis ar delyuerd to me of my father / and noman knows the sone but
the father / nether any man knows the father but the sone / and unto whom
soever the sone will reuele him. Come ye all unto me that labor and ar
burdened / and I shall ease and refresshe you. Take my yoke upon you / and
learn of me which am mylde / meek and humble hearted / and ye shall find ease
and quyetnes in your souls. For my yoke is pleasant / and my burden light.

First of all he says himself to be the fontaine of all goodness / and even
that lively plentuouse spring never to be dry drawn / which will satisfy his
childerne most plentuouslye. Then he adds / himself to be that heavenly and
faithful teacher / which one only may trwly deliver and give forth the
celestial wysedom and perfect doctrine. Hereof he exhorts all men to come to
him / how many so ever ar perplexed / and intricated with any dowte of the
trwth / be affl^^ted / grieved / troubled and pressed down with to heuye
burde^s. For unto all me^ he promises counforte and quietness present help /
remedy / and saciete / that is to satisfye their desire with all goodness / and
to be brief / even the true institucion and enstruccio^ in all trwthe / and a
just tranquilyte of minds. Psalm. c.ij.
He exhorts also / that (the yoke of the world cast of) me^ submit and put
their necks under gods holy sweet yoke. For this yoke he pronownceth it to
be pleasant and light. Not only be cause there is nothing hard to a loving
and willing man / but also for that this doctrine is the most plain and
simple / And eue^ the word (as says the prophet) which is abreuiated and
made short Where of the same prophet also prophesying of the kingdom of
Christ (which is his doctrine cries in the person of God saying Harken you
that be thirsty. Esaias. x.
Esa. lv.
Come ye all unto the waters / even he that has no money Come / bye and eat.
Come (I say) bie with out money wine and milk / yea / and with out any
price. Wherefore lay ye forth your money for that at fedeth not / and spend ye
your labor about that at fedeth not? Hear hear (I tell you) me / and eat
that at good is / and let your soul not delight in fatness. Bow down your
ears / and come to me. Hear me (I say) and your soul shall live: and I
shall smite up an everlasting covenant with you / even the faithefull mercies
promised to David. Behold I have given him to testifye of me to the gentyls /
to be a leader and master to the populouse heithen. By these words / owre
benign and trwe god provoke all mortal men to come to him only / he
excludes none at all. For he calls the^ not unto certain heuey burde^s to
be borne / for he foreseing these heuey infinite dampnable burdens of men's
ceremonies / rites and tradicions / institucions / inuencions / acts /
articles (and I can not tell what) commanded non to be so hardy / as to bear
a tankerde of water through Solomon's temple. By water fetched at muddy pyttes
(as Jeremy expowneth it) meaning the heuey unsavory and unprofitable
ceremonies / rytes etc^ / inve^ted of men. He calls us not therefore to bear
these intolerable burdens unto which (to ease us) the makers of them / will
not once put to their leiste finger / but he calls us unto celestial
pleasant riches / to be pertakers of etrnall life. Math. xxiij.
Ephe. iiij.
He rebukes also our folisshnes / which are carried about and diversely vexed
with varye / diverse / contrary / and most hard kinds of sondrye doctrine /
of which there comes no profit / but great hyndraunce and undoing to our
housholdes and goods. Come therefore to me (says he) hear me / me (I say)
and your souls shall live. For he offers to these obayers and comers to him
a great gift in covenant / promisyng us eue^ Christ him self / in who^
only he promises himself / to give us all things. Let us now therefore see
how God has performed this covenant and promise / and what things the
father has given us in christ / eue^ christ himself to witness.

When the only begoten son of God / which is in the bosom of the father /
descended from heaven unto us / and being very god and man Jesus Christ should
preche the heavenly wysedom / even the gospel / unto the hole world / and
should enstructe and institute his church in the trwe religion: The doctrine
deliuerd of christ to his church.
he wrapped not / nor combred / nor clogged not the minds and souls of his
people with diverse and manyfolde traditions: nether disputed he nor reasoned he
with them any long time / either obscurelye / or sharpelye of the trwe
salvation and iustificacion / snarling their consciences / inuoluing the
christian religion in any subtily and hard questions: but often times in one
little short sermon he gave us all thing what so ever is necessary and
perteyning unto owr very salvation / which thing we shall now clearly
setforth in plain examples.

In John / the.iij. the Lord receiving Nicodemus unto him fully and perfytlye
to be taught in all that same lesson and in his institucion / he does nothing
else teache him / but that this master of Israel might understand and know that
who so ever will aspire unto life everlasting / he must be borne agene from
above / even of the holy ghost: that is to say / these same owr own
strength / enforcementes innated and engraven in to us from owr first birth /
to have nothing at all no disposicion of owre selves / no inclinacion promptnes
/ nor red^^es unto our right wysenes and soul health to (...) obtained / but
that from above through the divine and fre grace is the holy ghost ge^en us:
which must tra^smute / change and illumyn the hertis of men / that anon they
might see the depraved nature and corrupt disposicon and inclinacion of ma^nis
nature / and so dispaering of their own strength and power / they might fly
unto the mercy of god / whose mercy delivered his sone unto death / that
every one that believes in him / be not lost: but may have life eternal. And
also that man now taken up to him from out of the derkenes of errors and
sins / he might perfitlye walk in the light of trwthe and puernes. What
could have be^ spoken (I pray you) in so great and weighty a matter more
briefly? or could have been said playnelier and more fullye and perfetly? I
think there can noma^ this taught in this heavenly philosophy require any more
Nether any other wise or by other means did he instruct the woman of Samarye
at the well / but that he seems there to have used a more compe^diouse
briefnes. Ioa^. iiij.
In the scole at Caperne / when he was desyered of some men and asked what they
should do / that they might work the works of god? Ioa^. vi.
he answerde them with one word. This is the work of god / even to believe in
him whom he has sent / albeit by and by he added a little le^ger exposicio^ of
the same / how that him self being the bread of life was comen in to the
world / how and by what ways he should prepare his own flesh and his
blood in to the meat and drink which gives life to the soul. And agene
under what manner he would be eaten and dronke^ / even spiritually through
faith. But yet is that same exposicion so plainly and so briefly wound up that
unto noman it can apere to be onerouse and heuey / even as thexposicion of the
law in Matthew is a little largelyer drawn at length / but a non after it is
briefly knit up and gadered agene into this one sentence. Mat. v.vi. and vij.
Wherefore all things what souer ye would men should do to you / even so and the
same do you unto them. For into this end te^de the law and prophets. Unto
this agrees also that at the lord on this manner says in John. Ioa^ xiij.
and.xv.
This is my precept that ye love one a another even as I have loved you / even
the same that is red in Paul / owe ye nothing to any man but this only / eue^
one to love a another. ^o. xiij.
For he that loves a another has fulfilled the law Who can say that these
lessons be to long or confusely inuolued / or to derke and obscure? In that
same his last souper when now he should open to his disciples the greatest and
highest mysteries and secrets of owr faith and should powerforth all his hole
godly breast unto sauit Thomas when he asked him / Master / we know not
whother thou goist / and how might we know the way? With one sentence he
expowning and showing them / whother he went / wherefore he must dye / and
which is the sewerest and most certain way unto heaven / said. I am the way /
the trowth and the life. There comes noman to the father but by me. In which
words he expressed the cause and fruit of his death / and showed them the way
unto heaven / yea and that most plainly he showed it them. And besides this
all wother ways ordened or invented by me^ besides this way / he plucked them
up / he destroyed / casted down / and sta^ped the^ under his feet for naught /
eue^ wrong ways / dampnable and ungodly. Whereof verily John boldened / said
in his canonik pistell. God has given us eternal life and this life is in his
sone / and whosoever have the sone has life / and he that has not the sone has
not life. Unto the which saingis justly agrees eue^ the same that s. Paul
propowned with a marvelous evidence unto the Ephesiens / God to have rehearsed /
and (as in brief some) brought it / and in Christ concluded. so that now out
of this same only Christ / as it were out of the barn of all goodness / men
might fetch the thing which before as it were by piece mele / was fetched out
of many sundry parts of scripture / yea / and even the Lord Jesus himself in
Matthew dampneth / and techeth us to avoid / and abhor these men who soever they
be / which deuyde the minds of the faithful / and induce them unto many and
diverse things as necessary or profitable unto thobteyning of salvation. For
if any man (says he) tell you. Lo here is Christ / or there is he / believe him
not For there shall arise false anointed and false prophets and shall show
forth tokens and prodygiouse wonders / so that (if it were possible) even the
very elect might be brought in to error. Math. xxiiij.
Take heed (says Christ) for I have now told it you before. If therefore they
tell you / Lo he is in the deserte and solitary places of religion / go not once
forth / or say / see he is in the secret places as in the p^uey pixe and
secret ciborye / believe it not. What the^ shall the faithful soul do? He
shall depend of the mouth and grace of the only Lord / which has
commanded his chosen tobe ware and avoid these manner abominable deceytes of
men sondrelye knittinge / smytinge / and diuidyng into many opinions the hertes
of the faithful with this wyked scysme: and has set forth before us himself
only the teacher of the trwth and in few words thexpiacion of sins and
purging from the same even the mercy seat of grace and forgiveness in every
necessite to be sought / and to fly unto him. For this is eue^ he / that same
master given unto all the world / which also has dyed for us / yea and even
he that is risen agene unto life / and sits on the right hand of god /
there making continual intercession for us / being that only all alone
perpetual priest with only one sacrifyce for ever finisshing and perfet
making them which are sanctified. Every man (I suppose) clearly vnderstondith
and perceyueth it well that in / and for Christ / the father has given us all
things. All men see what manner teching was the doctrine of the Lord
concerning owr salvation / whereby we be justified and who is the life of the
faithful / a doctrine (I say) which is short and brief / but yet clare /
manifest / full and perfet in every part. Hitherto perteynith also his
tradicion of the benefittes and good will to be given forth / of the prayers of
the faithful / and of fasting and chastysing of the body / eue^ siche
doctrine as is both brief and clear (as ye may see in Mat. vi. cap. having
nether any difficultye nor burden. Which tradicion and doctrine of christ
notwithsto^ding yet apereth intolerable and unable to be expressed and
vndersta^de^ of the lay people / if thou estemest it of the disputacio^s of
sophisters / and take it at the subtle setting forth of the scolastical
scolders.

Here follow all the Sacraments that Christ delivered to his church.

Now as towching the sacraments / very few they were which the Lord committed
unto his church / even only these tweyne / baptism and the sign or
remembrance of his body and blood. For as for John his baptism / he dyspiced
it not / but with the s^^e himself was sanctified. And eftesone after he
sending his disciples into all the world to preach his gospel and to declare
it unto all nations and gentyles said. See that ye be going to teach all the
gentyles or nations / who soever they be / baptising them in to the name of the
father / the sone / and the holy ghost. In which institucion thou shall never
find any thing either hard or heuye or not plainly spoken and expressed. And
as for himself whiles he lived upon the earth and laid forth the wholesome
preching of the gospel / baptized noman / but his disciples he commanded to
baptize. For the word of god is more beter and more preciouse then the
sacrmentes yea / and faith its elfe is more noble then the sacraments. Hebre.
xi.
For with out faith it is impossible for any man to please god. And with out
faith / sacraments may be ministered: but profit shall they not. Furthermore /
the souper the Lord himself did first institute and celebrate it / in no
costely aparell nor in any (...) (...) (as they say) ornoweri^g (...) (...)his
table with any rich iewelle / (...) / chalesses / images / candle stikis (...)
etc^. There were no glitering golden no^ silver sewtes nor preciouse vessels /
no (...) made / onerouse charcheable nor hard for any man / but all was plain
simple easy to be had / moderate sobre dece^t and honest. For Christ in that
sober souper / with bread and wine both testified and preched unto us the
mysterye and benefit of owr redemption / and commended and left unto his people
/ the remembrance of his death / and the co^corde and mutual amyte unviolable
and perpetual amongst us to endewre. Nether did he here spinosely / that is to
say / thornisshely sherpely perplexly with confusion and accombrance of owr
wittis and plain understanding subtily and magistrally as the dunre men speak
bring in these deed dreams of this holy sacrament which were and ar wo^te now
a days to be disputed in scholis vnyuersites and freerly in doctorissh popissh
pulpittis. As whether there be the very real ^ substanciall body of Christ
really naturally substancially corporally as long / as broad / as thyke / as
heuey (and I can not tell what nor how) as he hanged on the cross. And agene
what into what thing is converted / whether bread is turned into nothing / or
in to Christus body? what substance abides still and remains? what substance
is lost or ceasseth to be? and in so ceassing from his own substance /
whether it be nothing at all / the accidents / that is to say / whightnes /
lightness / heaviness / taste breking baking etc^ / whether they there abide still
with out substance / and whether he be whole with all his members in the wholl
sacrament or bread / and wholl in every peese broken / whether one body may be
in heaven and earth and in a thousand places at once. And how so great a body
may be wholl in so little a crome of bread. And whether there be his gloriouse
immortal impassible body / or his body mortal and passible as it was in his
souper sittynge with his disciples? But Christ at his souper taught the^
plainly the ferme faith in / and to believe in god / he disputed of brotherlye
love clearly / and treated of the remission of sins / of patience and
constancye in aduersite / and preched them of the adsewered certain hope of
that blessed life to come. For these things ar wholesome and aperteyning to owr
salvation / and to the knowledge of god / these thingis requires he of his
people.

When owr Lord Christ had delivered this doctrine concerning the christian
religion / and the discipline of the sacraments privately to his disciples and
openly to all men dispersed through Galyle and Iewrye / and also after that he
had purged by his innocent death on the cross the sins of the hole world:
What things were delivered unto the church by the holy ghost.
and was bureyd / the third day he ryseth from death / and by.xl. days he
apered to his disciples / and lest they should have douted of his resurreccion
/ he showed himself unto them by many evident profes / himself verelye to have
had risen from death / in the mean time giving also precepts unto the apostles
/ of the church or co^gregacions to be called together and constituted through
out all the world / and thus all thingis finisshed / he is ascended into
heaven: and sits in glory at the right hand of the father. And the precepts
which he gave unto his / were of this manner. That they should go forth into all
the rownd world and preche his gospel / that is repe^ta^ce and remission of
sins in the name of christ / and that they should also baptyse the beleuers
thereof / teaching them to keep all thingis which himself had commanded them.
By the which thing verily he signified the most perfect kind of techinge to be
delivered to them. For that at he adds / They should abide and wait for the
coming of the holy ghost / pertayneth to that purpose unto the which many me^
violently pluk it / as though this holy ghost should have delivered to them a
another news and more large doctrine the^ Christ had before taught them. For
even himself openly said in his gospel. He shall not speak out of him self /
but all thingis what soever he has herd shall he speak / and agene. Ioa^. xvi
He shall receive it out of my precepts and doctrine / and so shall he show it
unto you. Agene. That same counforter and techer even the holy spirit whom the
father shall send in my name / he shall teache you all thingis / and shall lay
upon your hertis impri^ted theryn fast all those things what soever I have
told and taught you. Lo / he says he shall teache you all thingis and because
they should not understand it of any new doctrine / or think that Christ
perchance had not taught them all thingis necessary for theirs and owr
salvation / but had left out some unwritten verites. He adds for a more
declaracio^. And shall all those thingis prynte in your hertis the which I my
self told and spoke unto you. Wheresoit folowthe that owr Lord Christ
taught them all thi^gis / but by the reason of their infirmite and weakness
those all thingis or else many of them / they had foregoten / so that it was
necessary for them those lessons by the holy spirit to be called agene and
beaten faster into their minds and memory / and there depelyer to be
infastened / and every thing fullyer at large to be explicated and declared.

But now / lest any man should doubt of these thingis / we will gladlye also
gather agene together into a some / what thingis the apostles aftir they
received the holy ghost gave and deliuerd to the chirchis to be observed. What
the apostles delivered unto the church
And that we might begin this demonstracio^ eue^ of S. Peter. Ye shall see that
he was called forth on a time unto Cornelye the capitayn of the Italyk legio^.
For the angel of the lord had told him / that he should send men unto Ioppen
called now port Iaph / and call Symo^ peter. Actu. x.
For he shall tell the what thou must do. Which when he was called and now
comen / and should tell him what he should do: he prescribed him no another thing
else then that he must believe in Jesus Christ. For he prechid not else to him
but christ eue^ to be crucified for us / buried / and the third day to have
had risen from death / yea and himself in the same his preching witnesses
himself not to have had received any thing else of the Lord to be preched
saying. The Lord commanded us to preach to the people and to testyfye that
it is he which is constituted of god to be judge of the quyk and deed. Unto this
man all the prophets bear witness that who so believe he shall receive
remission of his sins through his name. Who here of (I pray you) understand
the apostles not to have had delivered any wother thingis to the people
dispersed through out the world then the same which they received delivered to
them of the lord? Who sees not thissame tradicion and doctrine delivered to
be sufficient unto salvation to be obtained / and unto the perfitfull religion
of christ? For the angel told him clearly that Peter should show him what he
must do. And Luke added by and by what he showed and prescribed him / even
nothing else then that at is expowned and laid forth in these few wordis. And a
non he baptized him with his familye. Peter thrusted in nothing into Cornelius
of any auriculare confession / nor of any puate absolucio^ / he taught him
nothing of cases reserved to the Pope. He forgote satisfaccion indulge^cis
pardons and popisshe penance to be enjoined him. He delivered him nothing of
merits and celebracion of mysses or of vows of chastity to be paid and kept.
Nothtng of inuocacion of saints / nor worshipping of images / he commanded him
nothing concerning pilgrimages to Rome or to Jerusalem / no mention of matens
eue^song ladypsalters sensing candies processions nor yet of holy bread nor
holy water nor ashes: but he preched him Christ plainly and in him only he
showed him all thi^gis. And eue^ the same Peter the most constant and fervent
affirmer and defender of the simplicite and playnesse of the faith and doctrine
of christ / in the counsel holden at Jerusalem in the which this question was
treated: Whether only faith justifies / and whether the works of the law
called good werks should be joined to faith unto the perfeccio^ of a christian
man: he rises up and with great grauite pronounces into these words. Ye men
and brethern / ye know that of the old time god chose out among us / that
throrow my mouth the gentyles should here the word of the gospel and believe
it. Acts. xv
And god which knowth men's hartis has testified unto the^ giving them the holy
ghost as well as unto us / no difference putting betwixt us and the^ when by
faith he has purifyed the hertis of them. Now therefore / wherefore tempte ye
god / that any yoke should be laid upon the neckis of the disciples / which
nether owr fathers nor we have been able to bear? But by the grace of owr Lord
Jesus christ we believe to be salued even as they believed and were saved.
Hitherto have we recyted the wordis of saint Peter. Here he says there is but
one / and that is a sewer and certain way unto salvation / but one and that
the most full and perfect form of justifying / even by the grace of owr lord
Jesus christ. Unto this tradicion Cornelius with all his familye familiar and
kinsfolk cleaued fast with all his whole heart and with trwe faith and received
the testimony of the sons of god / in this mean ceason (says Peter) I nether
added nor laid up on his shuldern any burden of the law: only preched I
Christ into whom he believed. Wherefore / the grace of god and faith into
christ is sufficient unto salvation / nether is it necessary any thing to be
added out of the law to make perfect owr iustificacion. And as for those few
tradicyons which there in that chap. a non ar red and added or said to be
putto / were observed for the co^sideracion of the tenderness yet of the time /
and for the manners yet of the men of that world / not that they should be
perpetual / but for charityes sake kept in the cities for a little time in the
which cytes Moses was yet red openly in their synagoges and scoles.

Now of the.xiij. chap. of the acts and.xv. ca. is it manifest / that nether
Paul himself the apostle taught either other thingis / or moo / or not the same
to the chirches of the gentyles. But in his pistles right diligently he
declares all faitfull / in christ to have and find all thingis which are
necessary unto the very salvation and perfeccion of christ's religion / nor to
need any other means else besides Christ or with christ to live blessedly.
For eue^ in the pistle to the philippians. The things which once were lucre and
plesaunte to me (he says) I now know the same for christis sake to be hurt
and hindrance to me yea I know now all things to be damage / for that
excellent knowleges sake of Christ Jesus my lord / for whose sake I reputed all
things to be hurtful and damage and esteemed and reputed them for dunge and
dyrte / that I my self might get christ for my lucre and advantage and that I
might be found in him / having not my nowne rightwysnes out of the law and
good workis / but that same rightwysnes which is through the faith of christ.
And for this cause he every where exhorts alme^ unto the faith into owr lord
Jesus / with the which faith also he comme^deth and sets forth as the fruits
of faith / as innocence of living / charity and also fervent prayers unto the
Lord. And this apostle baptized as the Lord had commanded him / althowgh he
confesses himself in the mean ceason / very few or non to have baptized. i.
Cor. i.
The souper of the Lord he celebrated no another wise / nor in no another wise
commanded he the Cori^thes to celebrate it / the^ the lord himself had
instituted and first ordened it. i. cor. xi.
For as for me (he says) I have not delivered unto you any thing concerning
this souper / but even the very same that I have received of the lord etc^ /
the place is openly known.i. Corin. xi. These (I say) ar the tradicions which
S. Paul / at the precept of the lord has delivered unto the chirches even an
absolute perfect and full example of an absolute cryste^ doctrine and of a just
chirch And now verily there is nothing more certain the^ that all the mother
apostles followed the same self way and manner of prechi^ge when they all with
one institucio^ and one spirit gathered together the co^gregacio^s of god. Out
of these all / I suppose it to be clear and plain / Owr Lord Jesus not to
have had ^nerated his church: and which be the very principal chief points
and articles few in nowmber by the which his congregation and church is fully
and perfitly so finisshed / that it want nothing: Which be these chief pncipal
sufficient articles given to the church.
that is to weit eue^ the doctrine of the gospel or divine verite wherein /
faith into god / the love of my neighbor publik justice / patience in the
cross / holiness in lyuinge / and that benign holy merciful distributing of
owr goodis to the pore / pure and faithful prayer / and the reverent
religiouse right use of the sacraments. In these (I say) very few thi^gis
nothing ouerouse / the church of christ is perfitly finisshed / so that it is
wholl and perfect in nothing diminisshed wanting any thing. i. Timothe.iij.
This same church I mean which Paul trwly calls the house of the living God
/ the pylar and foot of the trwth / which sto^deth fast upon and cleaves to
that foundacio^ stone Jesus christ. i. cor. iij.
And if any man yet dowteth and thinks many mo thingis to be required unto
her perfeccion: let him hear Luke in the actis of the apostles / describinge
the primative or first / that is to say that most of all perfect full church
of Christ gathered to gither even of the apostles / no moo thingis the^ these
there in that time putting in mind unto them: thereof gathering that even now
like wise / by the same only chief principalls committed unto the^ / that
there out of the fame / the perfitst congregacions might be gathered / made
perfect and conserved. For in the.ij. of the acts aftir Luke had showed by what
manner the holy ghost had be^ given to the apostles / anon he declares how and
in what manner Peter preched christ unto the people of Israel / and how that
they now compunct and stricken in heart asked: What shall we do ye men and
brethern? which Peter answerde in these wordis. Resipiscite: et baptizetur
vnusquisque vestrum in nome^ Jesus christi ad remissionem peccatorum / Repe^te
and change your living and be baptized every one of you into the name of Jesus
christ / so to have remission of your sins by faith: and ye shall receive
the gift of the holy ghost. And aftir a few mo wordis. S. Luke adds /
exhorting the^ with many mo wordis saying. Be ye p^serued and keep your selves
from this perverse and euel generacio^. In the which answer of Peter and
exposicio^ of the story by Luke / first we have the chief principals of the
euangelyk doctrine / even faith and repentance through the name of christ / and
then an exhortacion and warninge / and at last the sacrament of baptism. And
anon aftir Luke adds yet unto these wordis. They were verily perseueri^ge in
the doctrine of the apostles / and in frendely charitable distributing their
goodis and in the brecking of the bread / and in prayers. In the which wordis
also / the doctrine of thapostles is regathered as it were in to a brief sum
and not only it / but also the constant perseuera^ce in the apostles doctrine
/ which cheiflye is most necessary / also the loving distributing of their
goodis / and the breking of the bread which is the souper of the lord and
faithful praying. In these (I say) so few in nowmber chief principals / the
writer of the acts of thapostles clearly and perfitlye finisshed up complete
that first primative and apostolik church the which never man / except he
were ungodly / would say but it was the most full / perfect / and wholl just
chirch. Sewerly Luke in the end of the same chap. openly calls it the chirch /
saying. The lord added daily unto the church sich as shuldbe saved /
confessing also health and salvation to be in sich a church / and as many as
come into the fellowship of sich a congregation to be saved. with these very
few principal institucions and doctrynes may the church therefore (as ye may
here see) be gathered perfitlye fynisshed and conserved / yea and that is the
very just and trwe chirch which enstructed with these few thingis cleaves to
/ and is sustained upon christ the very rok. But here also have ye the
testimonies of holy men. For lactancius in his book of the trwe wisdom the v.
book of his institu. cap. xxx. says / That same only is the universal chirch
which holds the trw worship. This is the fountayn of trwth / this is the house
of faith / this is the temple of god / wherein if any enters not / or out of
the which if any go forth he shall be far from the hope of eternal life and
health But yet because heretyks think their church to be the catholic chirch /
ye shall know that same to be the trwe chirch in the which is the religion
and trwe worship of god in spirit and in no vtward ceremonies of men / in which
is confession of sins unto god and repentance which heleth holsomly sins
and wou^des / unto the which the weakness of the flesh is subject. These
wordis Lactancius wrote which disputing of the trwe worship in his.vi. book of
his institu. cap. i. says. The holy and singular majesty of god desiereth
nothing else of man then only innocencye which if any offreth it to god / he
has made a sufficient sacrifice both godly and religiously. Which thing I
have added to / that thou might the trwlyer understand that at he said /
the catholic chirch to be even the same which holds the trwe worship of god.
And Austen the very trwe doctor of the church answering to the questions of
January in his c.xviij. pistle writes plainly into these wordis. First of all
I would thou should hold in mind the chief point and principal of this
disputacion / even owr Lord Jesus Christ (as himself says in his gospel) to
have subdewed and laid owr necks under his most pleasant yoke and his light
easy burden. Whereby he has bownde and yoked together the chirch and societe
of the new people with Sacraments very few in nowmber / most easy to be
observed / in significacion most noble and excellent / even Baptism by which
we be consecrated into the name of the trinite / and the Communion or partaking
among many of the body and blood of owr lord / with sich like (if there be
any) commended to us in the scripturs: those except / which for the
congruence of the hertis of the old people and for the tender time of the
prophets burdened their bondage: which certain sacraments and ceremonies be
siche as ye read in the.v. books of Moses and so forth following unto the grace
of the gospel.

But / mennis testimonies left / let us return to the witnesses of god / and
agene to the testimonies of the most excellent apostles Peter Ihon and Paul /
whom I shall yet more largelye allege / that in the mouth of.ij. or iij. this
inuicte verite / that is to weit / that in these few poyntis and principals in
nowmber / the chirch be made perfect / might be affirmed the fastlyer and the
stronglyer proved. For Peter after that he hade put forth a certain few
doctrynes and precepts of the faith / charity / patience and beneficence / and
had exhorted the godly to express the^ in holy works: a non he adds. These
things if ye do: ye shall not slide at any time. For verily by this manner shall
the entrese into the eternal kingdom of owr Lord and savior christ Jesus be
abundantly ministered unto you. But and if he had not believed this kind of
doctrine which now we have recyted / to be sufficient unto that life to be
obtained and for the people of god to be made perfect / he had never said By this
manner or ways abundantly (observe the pithei weight of this word Abou^da^tly)
shall thentres into his kingdom be mynistred unto you. Then / verily were not
these monkisshe and fryerlye odiouse orders / nether their ungodly rules of
mo^kis friars etc^ / nor yet them selves. The^ were there no misses / no siche
manner of questions or traditions as have owr idle belled bisshops and skoldi^g
scolemen many years aftyr at last dreamed and brought into the church. And
yet with out these dead dreams (says S. Peter) Abundant and plentuouse
entresse by the dotrine of the apostles to be laid open unto all men desyeringe
to com to that life eternal. Saint Ihon in his pistle / says. The thing
which ye have herd from the beginning / abide there in / or let it abide in
you. If that doctrine which ye have herd from the begi^ning abide in you /
then shall you also abide and dwell in the sone and in the father. Lo / here he
promises to them a perfect and full fellowship and coniunccion of the father and
of the sone with those faithful which continewe and abide in that kind of
doctrine which thapostles from the beginning of their prechinge delivered the^.
But from that beginning they gave them no another doctrine then the same which
(they said) we have herd. Wherefore that tradicion must be sufficient unto
perfeccion. S. Paul not only binds the preacher of the gospel unto the same
brief and simple plain kind of doctrine / but besides that / he prophecieth
certain pestelent pharisais and papistis to come / which (eue^ as we now see
them) will not hear that same trwth delivered to the chirches / confessed and
confirmed with miracles / but will turn themselves unto vain fables and most
vain lies and trifles. ij. Timo iij. and iiij.
For thus writes he unto Timothe. I beseech the humbly before god and owre
Lord Jesus christ which shall come to judge the quik and dead in his own
aperaunce and in his kingdom / preche thou the word and sermon / be fervent
in time / out of time / rebuke blame / reprove / exhort with all lenite
softnes and doctrine. For the time shall come when men will not suffer nor
abide the trw doctrine / but aftir their own voluptuouse lusts and desyers
they shall heap unto them selves techers / even them which mustetykle their
ears / and shall auerte their ears from the trwth / even unto vain fables
shall they be converted. These wordis without dowte had not that divine breast
and godly heart / pronownced with so great feruencye and fervent affect / but
that he knew it right well / that that same doctrine which himself with also
the mother apostles had preched and delivered to the chirches in writing / was
just / perfect / and sufficient / and the innumerable chirches now constituted
welnighe through out all the world to be trwe and perfect full chirches.
Wherefore these same few institucions must nedis be sufficient for the
congregacions with which as necessary doctrynes the lord would instruct his
chosen and not onerate and ouerburden them / yea and that eue^ for this intent
/ that we should not now be ever in lerning / never comen to knowledge of the
trwth. For all these thingis ar certain / in a just little nowmber / yea and
eue^ the most easyest lessons through christ's help / so long as we cease not
from owr office and apply owr calling.

Furthermore / lest anyman complayn saying these owr sayings to be to skant
and initof vnfinisshed / it shall be necessary to expres some of these things
more at large that it may be manifest unto almen / us to have sufficienly in
these few principals / all things pertaining unto the perfeccio^ and
fulfilling of the church. The doctrine of the apostles / the preching of the
trowth / the word of the Lord / the holy scripture or gospel of Jesus
christ / obtayneth the first place in these said principals. What ar
comp^hended in these pncipalles.
For it prescribes this thing / the laws of lyffe to be most absolute and
perfect: this place techeth / it rebukes / it deiecteth and casts down and
lifts up agene heuey myndis / it exhortethe / it counforteh / it threateneth
/ it bends and menaceth and decrees punisshme^ts / it sets forth rewards
both of god and man / and to be short / all divine and humane thingis /
ecclesiastik and polityk / yea all the parts of owr lyffe / all ages and all
offices it informs and instituteth most plentuously / and perfitly yea and it
absolueth and makes them all perfect and full / nothing wanting. This witnesses
Paul the most wysest in the law / writing to Timothe / saing. Thou / see that
thou standeste fast and persevere in those thingis which thou lernedst and
which are committed unto the / knowing of whom thou haste learned them / and that
from thy childhod thou have known the holy letters which may make the wise and
perfect unto thy salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. For the hole
and perfect scripture godly inspired is profitable unto teching and lerning / to
rebuke / to correck to institute / and enstruct / in all good works that any
man of god may be entire perfect and redye unto every good work.

Also the word of the lord / in a manner and as far as it pertains unto us
/ is idle wa^tinge her fruit and operacion / except there be me^ that will
exercise / stere up and whett it / in time and place / applyinge and layinge it
unto men / teaching it / ernestly provoking it settinge it forth at lybertye
and defend it. And here have the mynisters of the church their place / and
chiefly the techers of the trwth the goydes of the congregacions / the
interpretours of scripturs / prechers / the masters of living and good manners.
For as miche therefore / that there is noman suddenly full made / nor borne a
perfect artificer: the church must nedis have scolis / scolis (I say) in
which tongues / arts / liberal disciplines / but yet in a sobriety and mean /
but chiefly the holy institucion and godly bringing up of children be delivered
and taught religiously unto the disciples which may be here aftir appointed and
promoued unto the ministracions of the church / and taught also them which are
apt unto erudicion and wisdom. For that there were flourisshi^g scoles or
universities as they now call them / in the time of the apostles and so
flourisshed long aftir their days / Luke affirms the autour of this in the
Actis cap. xiij. And Paul in the.i. pistle to the Cori^thians in the.xix. cap.
Also Eusebius in his ecclesiastik storye / and wother ecclesiastik writers
witness the same. And out of these manner scoles / the most faithful / most
excercised / the godlyest / the most eloquent men / and of most experience
and wisdom were ever called unto the ministracions / gouerna^ce and teching of
the congregacions. Also when it is so that in the church or congregation in
which doctrine flourissheth / this ungracious kocle / drake / and dernell also
will grow vndere and preuely increase / so that there will very many stourdye
proud rebels budde and wexe ripe / which as they ca^ craftily feign
themselves faithful / even so do they nothing worthei and corresponde^t to
faith. yea and they will not set a straw by it if they be taught an.C. times
and be rebuked never so openly and greuouslye. Netheles they go forth still in
their mischief sins. Wherefore it is necessary that the congregacions have
not only their ministers and techers / but also their elderly sage wise men /
yea and the seclare magistrates to / which must with the laws bring into
order and with disciplyne constrayne and bind fast these contumate stifnecked
vnshamelesse criminouse sinners And these mynisters and magistrates it behooves
to be right good me^ / holy / faithful / godly just / te^perate / sobre /
strong and constant and siche as fere god / which both will and may do their
office and duty. And unto this pertayneth the eleccion and office of the
seclare Magistrates / hitherto pertayn the su^ptuarye and penal laws agenst
eting surfeiting dronkenes / superfluite / excess / viciousnes rybaldrye /
whorehunting / filthy comunicacion: also the laws agenst aduonterers and
whoremongers / and laws of matrimonye justly to be contracted / lawfullye to
be kept in reverence and iustlye to be divorced laws of the bringinge up of
children / of the pubyk justice / of bying and sellinge or any wother doingis
/ agenste their evil deccate^ / false wares etc^ / agenste vserars and
corrupters and minisshers of coins / of iugeme^tes of the pore and destitute
nedye / orphans and frendles to be defended / of tranquilite and publyk peace
/ agenste hyered batail and wages to corrupt men / laws of beneficence almose
and help of the pore and of the lawful use of the goods of the chirches.
These thingis would I incidently and as it were by the way point men to
briefly / concerning the doctrine of the apostles or of the trwth / and of the
ministers thereof / that is to say / of the lerners / techers / professors /
prechers and of the holy senate and sage counsel of the church. Of syngers
quere men and their ecclesiastik song / I can say nothing taken out of the
institucion of the apostles. Paul comma^deth his chirches to sing in spirit
and mind. Wherefore it is sufficient to the just church if with trwe faith
they offer through christ their pure prayers unto the Lord.

As for the Sacraments S. Austen very godly and lernedly affirmed very few to
be instituted of the Lord / even Baptism and the sacrament of thanks giving /
the most easyest sewerly in their obseruacion and kepi^g of them / but in
sense and significacion most noble and excellent. For they carry no great
cost with them / nor yet no difficulty (I speak of the apostles sacraments /
and not of the popish sacraments) and in few wordis / they have no worldly
shyning shows and glytering vain glory. For all their vertew and strength
consists of / and in their institucion and significacion. The faithful
saints in the congregation ar justified and absolved by faith only / and not
by sacraments. For sacraments exercise and in a manner excite and stere up
faith* for they ar visible accions instituted of the lord / to the intent he
might represent unto us his mysteries and giftis / and so testifye toward us
his good will / exrercise and whett owr faith / gather and bind us to gither
into owr religion / and to admonisshe us of owr office. As ye may see in
Baptism For that represents unto us that it is he only which wassheth us
from owr sins / by it witnessing that he favors us / yea and that he will
be owr god one alone for us all sufficient. How often so ever baptism is given
in the co^gregacio^ / the faith of holy men is excercised. Besides that it
gathers and brings us together vtwardly into his people / and warns us to
mortifye and slaye owr carnal affectes / that daily we might dye with the
Lord and rise agene with him into a new life. Agene / in the Souper of the
lord / it is signified that the body and blood of owr lord ar spent and laid
forth for us in the cross to satisfye owr fathers justice / and give more life
to the beleuers. Wherefore / when the bread is raught unto us / which bread the
lord called as it were in sign and token or aftir the similitude and aftir
the manner of speking appropriated to sacraments / his body a manifest token is
given / that the Lord offered himself all whole unto us that we might have owr
fruicion and sight of him in faith. And thus owr faith is excercised in that
mystyk accio^. And as out of many graynis one loffe is made / and of many
grapes the liquor of wine flows forth: even so ar we monisshed of mutual
love in the percepcio^ and receiuinge of the signs and sacraments / and that
with Christ and among owr own selves we be made one body / and to give
tha^kis to christ owr deliverer. This is dowtles the use and form of the
sacraments / having nothing which hitherto has not been proposed and setforth
in the doctrine of the gospel / save that it has pleased the Lord for our
infirmite to have to do with us according to owr capacite by these signs
sacrame^tals as it were with visible words: and in a manner to lay before owr
eyes the most great and excellent thingis / that they might be the more
commended praised and accepted of every christen man: and so by the one
sacrament to iniciate and profess (as they say) the faithful / out of whose
fellowship he excluded not even the infantes. And by the the other sacrament for
the waren people to retayn in memory the death of the sone of God. And thus ye
see it most manifest / the use of the sacraments to be most plain and single
most wholesome and most full of the most swetest fruits. Which use many make it
more the^ ingrate and unthankful / by those their thornye spinose disputacions
fond questions and with their skoldinge cauillacions and sophistical besye
brawlynges.

Of these thingis hitherto written (I suppose) every reader perceives / that we
which glory and rejoice in the gospel and name of christ / have in few
principales showed all thingis which perteyne unto the full perfeccio^ of the
church / and therefore owr lord with these few in no wise to have onerated
his church. For these few things / albeit of their nature they be the most
divine and incomprehensyble / yet unto the faithful ar they the most easy
and most iocunde and joyful in thobseruacion and in the keeping of them.
Wherefore / what soever cost / what charge and burdens the congregacions this
day sustain: with what soever laws rytes ceremonies tradicions of men /
apere they never so comelye and decent (as they say) with what and how many
soever decrees and disputacions the congregacions be yet snarled combred and
clogged / nether of the Lord / nor of the apostles / nor of non apostelyk men
have they received them / but of the evil idle bellye burdens of the earth /
of the supersticiouse papists / and of these couetuouse preistes and greadye
bisshops / which as they have hitherto ben ever in lerning and never come^ to
the knowelege of the trweth / even so plainly have they thought and made
godlynes to be lucre and to serve their insaciable lusts: of whom the apostle
wrytinge to Timothe / says. Avoid from these persons which be of siche
couetuouse conditions and abominable lyuinge. Cast of therefore (oh christian
reder) these their importable burde^s of heuey vnprofitfble supersticiouse
ceremonies / which to ease you they will not once put forth their finger to
bear them their selves / which burde^s in that (as Paul says) they punisshe
the body / they apere to have some vtwarde holiness / and yet ar they with out
all honor and godliness / even their rytes and choice of meats to feed the
flesshely lusts of their bellyes. Collo. ij
And putt your necks under the sweet yoke of Christ / and submit your
shulders under his light burdens (light it is that love bears) that as we be
like Christ in gladlye suffrering / so we may be like him in glory / unto the
which / he with the father / and his most holy spririt / bring us all. Amen.

At Zijr^^.
