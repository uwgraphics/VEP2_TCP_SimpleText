As sh^e them wrought by time, precesse and space
All this matter sh^e taught me of her grace

O clyo lady most facundyous
O Rauysshyng delight of Eloquence
O gylted gods gay and glorious

This book to you no plesaunce may present
But netheles as tasted bytternesse
Al sweet thing makes be more precious
So shall my hook extend the godelynesse
Of other auctours which ben glorious
And make their writing delycyous

For king or queen aulfyn / knight or pawn

First my desire was to have drawn my king

A doughtful prince most mighty and most digne
Most excellent and most vyctoryous
Having a son and four daughters benyngne
And a servant which with affectuous
Love and desire he cherysshed in his hows
A commandment yafe his servant in certain
The which he brake^ and death she old he his pain
Four tormentours the king cleped to him
Bad one h^ym to put in prison sour
And other sh^old quyck flee him lyth and lym
The third kill h^ym the fourth sh^old him devour
The four daughters herd tell of this rumoure
Whose names ben Mercy / truth / rygh^t / and pease
But mercy though^t her faders ire to cease
She looked down in to the prison deep
Her loved servant saw sh^e syttyng there
For whom her heart began both blede and weep
Dystyllyng teres dysteyned al here chere
She began unlace her tressyd sonnysshe here
Nakyd her breast / and for compassyon
Before here fader on knees fell a down
O mercyful / and o most mercyable
King of kings / and fader of pity
Whose mighty mercy is inmensurable
O prince eterne / O benyngne lord quod sh^e
To whom mercy is yeuen of properte
Of thy servant that lies in prison bound
Have thou mercy or death mine heart will wou^d
I am sovereign above thy works al
I am the pure auau^t of thy godhede
I am thy child thy ge^me celestyal
The mynyster of al thy godlyhede
The substance that al mankind does feed
I am the tresour of thy deyte
O prince of pees my bone now grant thou me
See how I sytte dysseueld on (...)
My crystal eyes. see how their teres rain
My rosy lyppes / see how they perced be
The hemed chere eke of my clekes tweyne
See how the tery River does dysteyne
My swa^nysshe throat with syghes in distraynte
My breast forbete / see fader al is faynte
And if thowe wolt grant me you prysonere
And gyfe me leave to lose him out of pain
All this dystresse / and all this mine heavy chere
To gladness thou might restore again
Thy h^igh^ vengeance / why should you not restrain
And sh^e we mercy syn he is penytent
With that came troth. and asked what it meant
To truth than spack her fader reverent
And said a servant / wh^iche I loved best
On pain of death I yaue a commandment
Which for to keep in him was al my trest
But he it bracke. and as a proud traitor kest
Me to supplaunt / and I made my behest
For his trespaas he sh^old dye at the lest
My daughter mercy prayth with voys pyteous
I would foryeue / and on him have pity
For sith my mercy is most copyous
I must it sh^ewe / thus argues sh^e to me
Nay nay quod troth / fader it may not be
Thou must of force observe thine own statute
And thy promise fulfylle for every fute
Thynk that I am thy daughter veryte
That of al truth doothe execucyon
Withouten whom thine eterne deyte
Were vnyat with imperfectyon
Thy will is law / thy promise is reason
And sith thy will / and thy promise also
Was he sh^old dye thou may not goo there fro
For thy godlyhede put out al varyaunce
Stable thy sentence. and thy Just judgment
Let execute in deed the same penance
That was forbrokyn of thy commandment
Than said mercy / unworthy is that assent
For sauns doubt every reasonable creature
Without mercy may not live no endure
Know ye not well that I am sempyterne
Quod mercy tho / how may ye me refrain
I am lady above the heaven superne
Though ye in earth be pryncesse and sovereign
My mighty grace is never void ne vain
Ergo I must releue servant penytent
Save fro the death assoylle this argument
Right sensyble and preygnaunt for your path
He that strong argument quod veryte
But do dyspute / mercy is not mine art
Another in herne ne in hole / troth logeth to me
And permanent I am as well as ye
And syn of force my fader must be true
From his byhest / how may ye him ^^newe
And if ye thynk / he broke not his byhest
For to permute with mercy she vengeance
For one is god / than would ye at the lest
In his godhede include both ignorance
And hastynesse and exyle (...)
And prescyence and ask eke might I sone
Why hight he that / that better (...) undone
Than said mercy / whereto was mercy wrought
But if mercy had execucyon
Whereto on me was al my f^der^ thought
And al his joy in my creacyon
Was I not made for res^yon
Of heavenly bliss / and for necessyre
That both angel and man must have of me
And if so were that I were adnychyla^^
The heavenly court may not restorely be
My faders Royalme were vain and vacuate
A power howsh^old it were withouten me
Why sh^old I not than have a soueraynte
And complement of my petycyon
Than answered troth / for ye ask no reason
Though ye al day argue for your purpoos
Truth sh^al deliver at her own volunte
My lyberte in no point will I loos
I am my faders ch^yld / as well as ye
And ryghtwysenes I wot will hold with me
And with yt word truth for h^ir suster went
Dame ryghtwysenes. which was anon present
On godely wise / but ferful to behold
Come ryghtwysenes al bemed full of lyt
For sh^e ne spared for hot / ne for cold
For high for low / for to fulfylle al right
My sustres strive quoth sh^e with voice on hight
I will dyscusse / and their contencyon
As right asks / bring to conclusycn
To his servant I thynk / what trust and grace
My fader had / and eke ^haryte
And in earth for him he made a place
Of lust / delight / and of al lyberte
Each erthely thing eke unto h^is soueraynte
He had enclyne / and be obedyent
Wh^yles he truly fulfylleth his commandment
What thing in earth he couthe or might deuyse
For hertes rest and lives sustenaunce
On him began laugh in all godely wise
And at h^is lust made h^ym obeysaunce
Exyled from h^ym was unhappy chance
Aduersyte might never his steps sewe
To his master whiles he was servant true
And if so were / he brake his commandment
My fader made a constytucyon
That prysoned and al quyck flene and rent
Deed and devoured sh^old be punycyon
For h^is trespaas and his transgressyon
That both pure love and fere this just precept
Should h^ym excyte that it were trewely kept
Not withstandyng the promise and statute
The trust / the love / the bounte and kyndenesse
Yone freel servant subject to seruytute
Save to conspyre with all vngentylnesse
And of ye just ma^dement made full just in^sgresse
Wherefore of right me thinks he must be deed
Late be quod pees / that is a cruel deed
And with that word pees ceme in to the place
Whoos person was patron of portature
Her rosy lyppes with chere full of grace
Offered kyssyng unto each creature
Phoebus him self with all his bemed cure
May not belyke the light of her vysage
So pure perfyte was that heavenly image
And on this wise sh^e began her tongue affyse
And said to troth / O ryt how may this mean
As your purpoos pees for to exyle
And to make mercy never more be seen
And to ordeyne death for to regne as queen
This would no more / but for to depryue express
My faders Royalme / and his sovereign richesse
Sith every Royalme that has dyuysyon
Within him self must needs be desolate
And we ben four for one conclusyon
For to sustene the Reame and his estate
Among us four / why sh^old then be debate
And sith that law will rather lossyn pain
That it extend / let pees and mercy reygne
My faders Royalme and had suffers no why^^
It is of rest and of tranquylyte
By cause of which he writes in his style
The prince of pees / the auctor of pity
King of mercy / and h^d of al bounte
Thus need of force must pees regne and prevail
Ch^yef stryf and debate perysshe in all battle
The ch^yef auaunt and commendacyon
Of this h^yghe Royalme is for it is of pees
Than whereto make ye disputacyon
Contrarious ben your debate / and rees
With stryf I will not duelle withouten ^^es
And if debate me from this Royame dysseuer
The land of pees destroyed is for ever
But sith so is / there is a trespaas done
Unto mercy let yield the trespasour
Hit is her office to redress it soon
For trespaas is to mercy a meryour
And ryt as sweet has his apryet by sour
So by trespaas mercy has al her might
Without trespass mercy has last of lygh^t
What sh^old be sy^te / but if that sykenes were
What nedyth salve / but if there were a sore
What needs drynk there thyrst has no powers
What sh^old mercy / but trespaas goo before
But trespaas by mercy were little store
Without trespaas none execucyon
May mercy have / ne yet perfectyon
But suster troth / ye may regne as a pryncesse
Without falsh^ede / and have your soueraynte
Without Iniure / and so may rygh^t wysenes
Eke without werre I pees may alwey^ be
But mercy kyndely has no properte
Withouten trespass / of which sh^e has her myt
Ryt as the son the moon yeueth al their lyt
Therefore I read as for conclusyon
That we obey mercy with one acord
And that we leave al our dyscencyon
For little things as clerks here record
With pees grows and goede thing; with discord
Wydeth awey / therefore led pacyfye
Our lust to one / and fall we to mercy
Late be qirod truth to you I nyl assent
No More will I ywys / quod ryghtwysenes
And with that word / truth to her fader went
And thus she said O ground of stedfastnes
O permanent / O very truth endeles
Hold thy hyhest. and support veryte
For ryghtwysenes acordeth unto me
These words says rytwysenes. and kneleth down
And said fader sith it is mine office
To give condygne remuneracyoun
To evil / and good / to each virtue and vice
And not to spare for prayer ne for price
And I sh^al thy godhede gloryfye
That truth asks / I must need Iustyfye
The foresaid caas reseruyng in my mind
How soon thy servant lust to the offend
And how he was cruel-fale / and unkind
To thy byhest I must of right attend
And need of force to judgment condescend
Wherefore I give sentence dyffynytyue
In form foresaid yt peyue to death him drive
Of this process to have the true intent
I wol thou wit quod sapyence to me
This mighty king is god omnypotent
In one godhede regnaunt. and persons three
His sone is Christ / his dough^ters in degree
Ben virtues four annexed to his godhede
His servant is old Adam as I read
Return we now (...)

And at the last with pyteous voice and wild

Fare well ye all. dame mercy lies in swoune
For sothfastnes accused has mankind
And ryghtwysenes that sh^old do al reason

Mercy and pees for them no grace may find
Notwithstondyng Judgment may have no suit
By cause of pees / but it be execute
Woo worth debate / that never may have pees
Woo worth penance that asks no pity
Woo worth vengeance / that mercy may not cees
Woe worth that Judgment that has none equity
Woe worth that troth / that has no charity
Woo worth that Inge^ that may no gylt save
And woe worth ryt / that may no favor have

But now I goo ywys I wot never whyder
Wherefore of force ye must fall to dyscord
O thou sovereign of al bataylle the lord
Now may thou send comete thy messager

And June in sum sign of the aquybone

And erratyk ay in your course be
For pees is gone / that your Ire did refreyn
And stabled you in all tranquylyte
Fare well ye al with all your broad contre
Fare well fader / thy Reame may never encrees
And with that word euanysshed dame pees

Of all the heaven the brother to mercy
Th^is woeful caas seeing / and this meschyef
For me ywys did send full hastily
O sapyence he said full pytously
With sum counceyl help now in this need
Thorugh perced / mine herb begins to blede
For pees is gone / and mercy lies in swoune
Withouten comfort so well a wey the while
Eke desolate is this heavenly Regyon
But mercy reygne^ and pees com from exyle
O sapyence help now to reconcyle
My suster pees / and mercy to comfort
And to this fine with counceyl me support
O master mine / O sovereign mighty lord
Hard is this caas quod I withouten lees
Hygh^ is that help / that may bring to acord
Mercy and truth / dame ryghtwysenes and pees
Mercy would save her man / and vengeance sees
Troth will not so ne yett dame ryghtwysenes
And for this stryf pees is to wyldernes
Echone of them will no wey be removed
From her intent hit is incomerous
Them to acord / how sh^old it be contreued
Syn two for two stond ay contraryous
Th^is sole caas is wonder studyous
For this acord who so that sh^al fulfylle
Must need of force perform their aller will
But sapyence who may best plese them al
And give echone their full desire express
I mean the wretch / that lies in prison thral
Mercy to have / and his gylt to redress
And not to offend dame truth and rytwisenes
And revoke pees / who shall this do quod he
In one godhede syn we be persons three
My fader is die full of lasting might
And al wysedom appropred is to me
Of al godenes the blessed heavenly light
The holy ghoost has to his propyrte
Thus myt wysedom and goodenes that both three
Ay of one will / may this accord make
But of ve three who shall the treuse take
My wits hole I godred unto me
And finally de for conclusyon
O master mine / I said it lies in the
Of this acord the execucyon
And on three wise I prove it by reason
Wherefore of force to make this accord
Dyspose thy self. be both subject and lord
Thy fader is so ferful well thou wost
That pees and mercy dat not compromyt
In him as juge and eke the holy ghost
In whom al grace godenes and truth is knyt
Dame truth and right for juge will not admyt
For well they wot that he is mercyes friend
Wherefore thy self of this must make an end
Yone wretch desired not thy fadere might
Ne yet the goodenesse of the holy ghost
For thy wysedom he cast with the to fight
And smote thy sheld omyd the heavenly host
For which thy self must answer well thou wost
Not thy fader / ne yet the third person
The help of this thus lies in the alone
These sustres soul who that shall pacyfye
Must be the sone of man / and take mankind
And for man's gylt / gylthes suffer to dyi
And raunson man that thynk I in my mind
Sith but to one sone the Trynyte may find
Which sone thou art / that by necessyte
This solemyne act lies finally in the
Than said my self O lady sapyence
O good beldame or ye forther proceed
Vouchesauf to tell your noble tru^tence
Wh^y might wysedom and godenes as I deed
To three persons which are in one godhede
Appropred ben / are they not peregal
And coeterne / and consubstancyal
Yis son ywys quod sapyence to me
They ben al three in godenesse might and wit
Egal and like / of one substance they be
But yet ywys thou clepyse them dryght
When that thou say the fader full of might
The sone of wit / the spyryte of goodenesse
This will a cause that is in kind express
A fader is thou wost a name of age
Of impotence and of debylyte
A Sone a name is of youth / and courage
Of inscyence and instabylyte
A spyryte is a name of cruelte
Of hight and pride / this may thou propre find
And eke comune if thou wolt see in kind
Wherefore the fader in the Trynyte
We clepe mighty the son full of wit
The good spyryte / this is of propyrte
To avoid the vice / that in kind is knyt
But of them al sone mine A will thou wit
In might with grace more excellent is none
Echone has al. and al three is but one
Return we son mine to our matere
My sovereign lord the brother of mercy
Said sapyence / I see it now so clear
That this accord in me is finally
But hard it is to take mankind and dye
Nevertheless mercy to recomforte
And save mankind, such death nere but disporte
With full effect he concluded in his heart
Of al mankind to make redempcyon
Give death for life / give joy for peynes smerte
Love soueraynte / and make subiectyon
The Angels eke had such compassyon
Of man's death / that right in specyal
To help mankind / they cast them al
Unto counceyl the holy spyrytes went
The Ierarch^yes with their heavenly collage
To pray for man / it was their hole intent
That he might come to his old heritage
Out from the Carybde / and the smoky cage
Of seruytude^ the which him had incluse
Four thousand year / he might it not refuse
The Ierarchye next to the Trynyte
With heavenly voys pytous / and delycate
Kneled a down / and said O god we be
As thou well wost to the inmedyate
As assessours we ben to thyn estate
Cubyculers also of thy godhede
To our prayer / O mighty god take heed
The to byhold is our sovereign solace
Our life. our lust / and ay lastyng bliss
The high glory that shyneth in thy face
The wit of kind may not conceive ywys
And sith that man so like unto the is
And fourmed was unto thine own sykenesse
Out of thy bliss. wh^y lies he in derkenesse
What honor is / what worthynesse
To thy godhede to suffer thyn image
Devoured be / and drenched in derkenesse
For whom thou made lygh^t to be heritage
And sith our bliss is hole in thy vysage
O well awey^ why sh^old of it the shapnesse
The to dysteyne alwey in derkenesse
Wherefore we pray / O prince full of grace
Thou have pity of man thy creature
His hondes strong / vouchesauf to vnlase
Let not thy sh^ap so long derkenes endure
Give sum reward unto thyn own honor
For now is time of mercy and of pees
And time is common yt al vengeance sh^old cees

There was gramer ground of science al

Dame Rethoryk science Imperyal
Dame Arsmetryk science in proporcyonyng
Geometry that mesureth every thing
The lady musyke and Astronomye
These ladies seven sewed theologye

And said welcome suster and sovereign
They kyssed sweet / of other both were feign
Philosophye is who lust to dyffyne

Of governance honest and good living
It is also the probable connyng
Of worldly thing / and goodely thing ywys
As much as to man possible is
She is cleped also the art of arts
And eke of death the medytacyon
Her being eke y set in two parts
In pure science and oppynacyon
Science thing techeth by certain reason
Oppynacyon is in certaynte
When thing by reason may not proved be
And if the son be more in quantyte
Than is the earth / how much eke is the heaven
Of what matter / and if he stable be
Or yet moble / this can not science neuen
If that the moon be moysty / holowe or even
This know we not by propre pure reason

Nature and kind / virtue and polycye
How they y taught eke execute sh^old been

Wherefore to her annexed ben sustres three

Phylosophye has these in especyal

Her propre kind / her kyndely properte
And in the second is trust of living
Knowledge of virtues and honest
When kind and virtues may than known be
The third suster comes with her resoun
Of evil and good making discrypcyoun
Millesius one of the sages seuene

By his reason the causes of the heuene
And of each the nature began he find
Than come plato a worthy clerk of kind
For natural art sought out geomatrye
Arsmetryk. Musyk and astronomye
Dame Ethyca pryncesse of polycye
Good Socrates first founder of governance
To knew virtue and conne live honestly
And four ladies he sought full of plesaunce
To serve dame Ethyke with obeysaunce
Whoos names ben prudence and ryghtwysenes
Dame fortitude and temporaunce I guess
Than fond plato the lady racyonal
Which when that kind and virtue known been
Techeth each man by reason specyal
To understand the subtyl strength and clean
Of kind and virtue what they would and mean
Than sought he out Dame Dyaletyca
To serve her with Dame Rethorica
In these three sustres grounded may we find
Dyuynyte / if we look well ywys
For each dyuyne other speaks of kind
As in the noble book of Genesis
Or of manners as in proverbs
Or of logyk / for whom dyuynes all The Cantycle taken in specyal
Some said that philosoph^ye called resoun
Has ladies two subject in specyal
The first hight Inspectyue whoos eye a boun
Dyscerneth thing wh^iche is celestyal

Of these four ladies must I specially

Dame Actual has other ladies three

Dame Cyuyle hight the third full of bounte

All this she taught / but for I must be breue
In this matter I nyl no ferther trace

But who so lust of Musyk for to wit
For very ground to Boece I him remyt

There may thou see of Dame Armonyca
Of Dame Metryk / and of dame Rethinica
Of al Musyke the very ground parfyte
There shall thou find. with bliss and al delyde
And these with musyke were in joy and bliss
And helped her prouynce / with her armonye
And with them was each instrument ywys
That is of Musyk / and of mynstralcye
Harp / lute / pype / trump / Fydel / ryuyls / sautry
The Rote / cagons / and the monycord
The Gyterne / Symbal^ / and the clauycord

Incipit breuis processus de Astronomia
Than see I sit in place full of al plesaunce
The heavenly lady dame Astronomye
Wh^iche of the sterres the course and governance
Their fygures eke descryueth craftily
And with her was the maid Astrologye
Which sometime is kyndely / and precious
And otherwh^yse over much superstyous
She is kyndely when that sh^e sh^eweth clear
The sons course / the moon. the sterres eke
And does nothing / but as kind does her lere
But when sh^e lust in sterres for to seek
The birth of man / which hole sh^al be seek
And will Dyuyne / and preche thing for to be
Unkindly than / and unlawful is sh^e
Astronomye that lady full of grace
Began first dyuyne what thing ye world sh^old be
What thing heaven is his course and his place
His paleys eke / his parties in degree
His form / his spear / and eke his properte
His syhte / his course / his mouyng at the best
With all other parties most and lest
His hemyspery / and his cer^tis five
Their properte / and how they cleped been
The Zodyak also sh^e began descryue
The son his course and his effect clean
His magnytude. his nature well besene
The moon her course / her diverse fourmes eke
And their Eclypses / there was nothing to seek
She taught also how sundry sterres hygh^t
And in what time they goo their cercules al
Eke how the son the moon yeueth al their lyt
Which Lucina we clepe in specyal
And how that fire out from heaven does fall
Like as the sterres fyl it is seen
The cause of this / and what it may mean
And to each sterre that cleped is a sign
By sit of which thing to come men may guess
A propre name sh^e began to assygne
As Arctur / Vrsa / the more eke and the less
Thus diverse names began sh^e for to dress
As Tryones / Boetes / Yades
Aricturus. Oryon / and plyades
As Lucyfer / Cometes / Vesperus
Their names old sh^e told full craftily
The planetes seven sh^e neuened unto us
Saturne^ Jove / Mars / Phoebus / and Mercurye
The Moon Venus / and what they sygnyfye
Their influence / and their qualyte
With cyrcumstannce of pure solempnyte
Twelve fygures than sh^e told ryt well arrayed
The Ram / the Bull / and the gemelles to
The Crabbe. the lyon^ and the streyt maid
The balaunce tharcher / and the Scorpio
The Got / the water sire / and the fysshe also
The planetes seven as they to this atteyne
Such each time dysposed^ soth to said
And how each figure had of his properte
A propre name / thus began sh^e constrewe
The gentyles eke how that they blinded be
That lust / honor with worsh^yp fresshe and new
The planetes seven / as parfyte gods true
Their rytes old / and their ydolatrye
She began reherce / as techeth poeterye
And how they clepe the ra^me the first sign
For that in mars beginning of the year
The son in him makes his course digne
And they worsh^yp him on their manner
By cause of Jove whom in their temples clear
If they depaynte a Rams head they make
With horns two for Iubyters sake
He come an ox / and took Europa they said
Wherefore the bole they worsh^yp of their grace
Castor pollux eke when they deed were laid
Among the sterres they demed have a place
Whom they clepen the gemelles with solace
For Hercules eke slough the great lion
Him for that sign they worsh^yp with renoun
O mysbyleue merueylous for to neuene
O cursyd blyndenes of these gentyles al
Which demyn fysshe / and bestyal be in heaven
For gloryfyed regnau^t perpetual
As Rame / bore / Crabbe / and bear in specyal
Hound / lion / swanne / the egle eke in fere
Whom they worsh^yp for Jove's chyef squire
She told also of batayl destyne
And how in sterres some men have such bileue
That in their birth right by necessyte
Ordained is all that him sh^al please or grieve
This old error our doctors done repreue
Socrates the same with Arystotyl says
Notwithstondyng they were not of our faith
Or if a man were in his natyuyte
Constreyued to / his sundry arts al
Them for to do right by necessyte
Why sh^old good men have lawre in specyal
Or myslyuers to punysshement be thral
Good Isodre makes this reason
In dampnynge of this false oppynyon
Astronomye the Egyptes first did find
Astrologye / and her queynt obseruaunce
Folk of Calde first sought and brought to mind
Whom Abraham taut the egyptes with plesa^ce
As writes Josephus withouten doutaunce
But greeks sayn this craft first was found
By one Athlant / and of him had his ground
And with this lady was sire Tholome
Ioh^n de hispayn / and Mysaleth also
With all other auctours in degree
That drew of her / whoos names let I go
Thus in sterres I wol cease and ho
And by the order of the arts seven
Styre folk to leave the world / and draw to heaven

Incipit Tractatus de Fide
Dame feith than led us unto her wonyng place
Unto a tower solemn and glorious
Full of al lust / comfort / virtue and grace
Depeynted fresshe with color precious
And in a parlour full solacyous
Thappostles al were set with pure delight
And of our truth the artycles they write
They had believe in god fadel of might
Maker of heaven and earth / and all that is
Of vysyble and inuysyble wight
And in his son crist full of bliss
Before the world / which was alwey ywys
I get not made and consubstauncyal
To his fader / of whom fourmed is al
He came from heaven / and in the maid Marye
By inspyracyon of the holy ghost
Mankind he took / and borne he was for to dye
To win man's soul out from the fendes host
And under Pylate set with Jews boost
Bounden and beat / crowned and crucyfyed
With watery wounds Innocent he dyed
For he was graven man out from hell he brot
And rose the third day unto live again
Styed to heaven / his faders Trone he sought
From whens as king / he sh^al come yet certain
Both quyk and deed to deem / to life / or peyn
The good to bliss / the evil to punysshement
Heuene earth and hell sh^al quake in that judgment
And in the holy ghoost believe they had
In holy church baptysme communyon
Of saints eke to hold ferme and sad
Of al trespaas to have remyssyon
And for to trow the resurectyon
Of people deed / and in life lastyng
Unto the which almighty god us bring
These artycles with other points all That longs to the holy Trynyte
Dame feyth her self began tell in specyal
With all the secrets of the deyte
Which in English not reherced be
Such thing as sh^old be pryuate and occult
I read we leave / and take quicumque vult
There was to feyth doing al reverence
The holy sinner Mary Magdalene
Which by dame faith has geten indulgence
Of al her sin / and was assoylled clean
Good martha eke by her grace began optene
And brought to live her brother lasedarus
So was the sone also of Regulus
There was the daughter eke of Canane
Which by her was brought fro the fendes bond
Al other eke / that of any infyrmyte
Thorugh feyth was cured / with her see I stond
Blind dome and deef leprous foot and hond
Whom feith has heled / and brought unto grace
With all honor obeyed her in that place
There was also the holy confessors
That preched feyth while they were on live
Doctors martyrs and glorious auctours
Writing of feyth / and her merit blyue
And on this wise / they began her descryue
And said that feyth is ground of al godenes
Withouten whom life has no sykernes
Unto al good sh^e gives strength and comfort
And who troweth not he falls impotent
The sh^eld of feyth who lust to comport
Al thing ouercometh as unto reverence
His three enemies with their yrous pretense
Against him sh^al neuermore prevail
Ask and believe thyn askyng sh^al not fail
She is ^y / for as the clerk says
There is but one god lord perpetual
Pryncypally / of whom preched is faith
Eke hole sh^e is of her artycles al
True without error outher great or small
Lively and quyck to do every quyk deed
For else sh^e were but as a body deed
There was the lady clennesse well arrayed
Devotion and dame vyrgynyte
Dame contynence and chastyte the maid
Dame Loulynesse and dame stabylyte
Enlumyned fresshe echone in their degree
These seruen faith / and as they couthe deuyse
With bliss they song / and said upon this wise
If better is to trow in god above
Than in mankind or in many other thing
Who troweth in him / for he can keep and love
Their lust fulfylle / and grant them their askyng
And in his gospel eke a worthy king
He said him self in me / who lust believe
Though he be deed ywys yet sh^al he leave
O cursed folk with your Idolatrye
Wh^iche in falls gods setten your delight
Blind dome / and death is al your mametrye
Of stok and stone / men may such karue and thwyte
Leave them for falls with sour and despyte
In our one god cast anchor and believe
Though ye were deed / he can make you leave
He is al life when your gods be deed
They have a time / and he is sempyterne
They are but earth / and brought low as led
He regneth god above the heaven superne
Blyssed be he. for he no grace will werne
To them / that will in him beset their believe
And though they dye ywys yet sh^al they live
