Nature:

A goodly interlude of Nature co^pylyd by master Henry Medwall chapleyn to the
right reverent father in god Johan Morton sometime Cardynall and arche bishop of
Canterbury

First comes in Mundue and syttyth down says nothing and with him Worldly
affection berynge a gown and cap and a gyrdyll for Man. Than comes in Nature /
Man / Reason / and Innocencye / and Nature syttyth down and says.
Nature. Thalmyghty god / that made each creature
As well in heaven / as other place erthly
By his wise ordinance / has purueyd me nature
To be as mynyster / under him immedyately
For thencheson / that I should perpetually
His creatures / in such degree maintain
as yt has pleased / his grace for them to ordeyne
To me yt longs by natural engendure
thing to contynew / that has spyryte of life
which / ne were my help should never endure
But suddenly peryshe / and wax all caytyfe
Atwyxt thesementys / that whylom were at strife
I have swaged / the old repugnaunce
and knyt them togeder / in manner of alyaunce
The I have ordained / the goddys Deane
Lady of the sea / / and every fresh fontayn
which comenly decreceth / when she gynneth wane
And waxes abundant / when she creceth again
Of eb and flode / she is cause certain
and reyneth as princes / in every isle and town
That with the sea / is compassed enuyron
I am causer / of such impressyon
as appears wonderouse / to mannys sight
As of flammes / that from the sterry regyon
Seems to fall / in times of the night
Some shote sydelong / and some down right
which causes the ignorant / to stand in dread
that sterrys do fall / yet falls there none in deed
What needs yt to speak / of thyngys here by low
as fowls / bestys / and fysshes in their hynde
Of trees / herbys / and stones how they grow
In which / men sundry and meny virtuous find
One thing be ye sure / and thynk yt in your mind
No manner creature / may take on hy^ure
Of these works / but only I nature
And plainly there is / in earth no manner thing
That is not partyner / of my influence
I do provide / for every best living
Of natural food / always suffycence
And give them also / a manner of prudence
Whereby they may / naturallyensew
Thing that is delectable / and the other exchew
Who taught the cok / his watch hours to observe
And sing of courage / with shyrll throat on hye
who taught the pellycan / her tender heart to carue
For she nolde suffer / her byrdys to dye
Who taught the nyghtyngall / to record besyly
Her strange entuny^ / in silence of the night
Certes I nature / and none other wight
But if that I / should clepe to memory
Each strange effect / and every great meruayll
That I have caused / I ensure you faithfully
That rather time / than process should me fayll
yt were your pain / and to me but trauayll
All such matters / as now to bring in place
Wherefore I let pass them / tell other time and space
But if ye covet / now to know theffecte
Of thyngys natural / by true conclusyon
Counsel with Arystotell / my philosopher elect
Which has left / in bokys of his tradycyon
Now every thing / by heuynly constellacyon
Is brought to effect / and in what manner wise
As far as mannys wytt / may naturally compryse
Wherefore sith god / of his great largess
Has thus enryched me / with dower of his grace
And made me as who seyth / a wordly goddess
Of duty I can / no less do in this case
But with hearts joy / and entyere solace
My self address / to do his high pleasurs
And to this same / move all other creaturs
Enforce you therefore / his creaturs each on
To honor your maker / with humble obeisance
Nomely thou man / I speak to the alone
Before all other / as chyef of his creance
Think how he / has made the to this semblance
Pluck up thyn heart / and hold thyn head vpryght
and ever more / have heaven in thy sight
Ouyde in his book / cleped the transformacyon
among all other his fables and poesyes
Makes special / mensyon of thy creacyon
Showing how god / wonderously began deuyse
when he the made / and gave to the thempryse
Of all this world / and feoffed the with all
as chyef possessyoner / of thyngys mortuall
In token whereof / he gave the vpryght vysage
and gave the in commandment / to lift thyn eye
Up to ward heaven / only for that usage
Thou should know him / for thy lord almighty
all other bestys / as thyngys unworthy
To behold therth / with grouelyng countenance
and be subdued / to thyn obeysaunce
But as touching / the cause specially
wherefore I have ordained the / this night to appear
It is to put the / in knowledge and memory
To what intent / thou art ordained tobe here
I let the wit / thou art a passanger
That have to do / a great and long vyage
and through the world / most be thy passage
Address the self / now towardys this iournay
For as now thou shall / nolenger here abide
Lo here Reason / to govern the in thy way
and sensualyte / upon thyn other side
But reason I depute / to be thy chyef gyde
with innocencye / that is thy tender noryce
Evermore to wene the / from thappetyte of vice

Man. O lord of lords / my lord god immortuall
To the be honor / and joy ever to endure
whose heavenly empyreshall never be fynall
But world without end / remain stable and sure
whom heaven and hell / and erthly creature
with one assent / and all with one accord
Honors / prayseth / and knowlegeth for their lord
To the mine head / I humbly inclyne
Thankyng thy grace / that first have ordained me
To be as a syly creature of thine
and after that / of thy great bownte
Thou have me set / in sovereign degree
and given me the profettys / of every erthly thing
as well of frutys / as of bestys living
and that that is / also most precyouse
thou have me enspyred / with heavenly wisdom
whereby I may / do worhys meruaylouse
In every place / where soever I come
Of each perfeccyon / thy grace has sent me some
So that I know / that creature no where
Of whose virtue / I am not partyner
I have as has / each other element
among other in this world / a comen being
with herbys and trees / contynuall noryshement
that is suffysant / to natural living
with sensual bestys / I have a manner of knowing
whereby I should / in good things delight
and flee the contrary / of mine appetyte
And over all this / thou have given me virtue
Surmountyng all other / in high perfeccyon
That is understanding / whereby I may auew
And well dyscerne / what is tobe done
yet for all that / have I fre eleccyon
Do what I will / be yt evil or well
And am put in the hand / of mine own counsel
and in this point / I am half angelyke
Unto thy heavenly spyrytys / almost egall
albeyt in some part / I be to them unlike
For they be ordained / to endure perpetual
and I wretched body / shall have my funeral
When yt pleases / thy grace so to provide
Man is not ordained / always here to abide
Wherefore unto thy sovereign and high estate
Most heavenly prince / I make mine oryson
Sith yt has pleased / thy noble grace algate
That I unworthy / of so great renown
In this world / shall have possessyon
thou give me grace / my self to enure
as may me profit / and be to thy pleasure

nature. God has herd thy prayer / ma^kynd no dout
In all thy requestys / and right full petycyon
Now forth thy iournay / and look well about
that thou be not / deceived by falls prodycyon
Let reason the govern / in every condycyon
For if thou do not / to his rule inclyne
yt will to thy great myschef and ruin
I wot well sensualyte / is to the natural
And granted to the / in thy furst creacyon
But notwythstandyng / yt ought tobe ouerall
Subdued to reason / and under his tuycyon
Thou have now lybertye / and nedest no maynmyssyon
And if thou abond the / to passions sensual
Farewele thy lybertye / thou shall wax thrall

sensua lyte, What lady nature / have I none intresse
As Well as reason / or innocence
Thank ye this lady / a good process
That they are auaunced / and I let go by
ye know right well / that I ought naturally
Before all other / to have of him the cure
I am the chyef perfeccyon of his nature
Alas what could / the sely body do
Or how should yt live / ne were the help of me
Certes yt could not well / crepe nor go
At the lest wise yt should / neither feel here nor se
But be as other / incensate bodies be
In mouche wurscase / than worms of the grownde
In which uneath / any tokyn of life is found
Mesemeth yt should / abhort him for to here
That I destrayned / should be in any wise
Standing that I / was create tobe his fere
Of all his guydyng / to take thenterpryse
And now ye put me out of his service
And have assygned / reason to be his guide
With innocencye his noryse / thus am I set a side
ye clepe him lord / of all bestys living
And nothing worthy / as far as I can se
For if there be in him / no manner of feeling
Ne no lively quyknes / what lord is he
A lord made of clowtes / or karued out of tree
And fares as an image / araued out of stone
That nothing else can do / but stand alone
If ye intend / hymto contynew long
In honor / or worldly felycyte
He most nedys follow / his apetyte among
And conferme him self / to the more part
I tell you men / will have no deynte
to do service / or homage to a block
all the world will / thynk yt but a mock
Suffer me therefore / to have with him a rome
and to be with him / as chyef counseyll
and if he do so / I thynk to dome
He shall reygn in the world / as chyef gouerner
But if Reason / tykyll him in the ere
Or bear him on hand the how is wood
He shall never be able / to do erthly good

nature. My friend as I / said to you before
a Rome shall ye have / no man says nay
But reason must be / preferred evermore
For he can best led him to the way
Of virtue and grace / whereby he may
Longest continue / to goddyshygh pleasure
To ye which end / god has ordained this his creature
Content thy self / now with Reason my friend
And medyll the no further / than thou have to do
Thou have brought many a man / to a wrecched end
And so thou woldyst spyll / his creature also
But what so ever he say / take no head thereto
without that Reason / will allow the same
For who so does the contrary / deserves myche blame
God and I Nature / have set the in better case
Than any creature / under the fyrmament
Abuse not man / abuse not thy grace
Of god almighty / that from above is sent
Thou shall be the first / that shall repent
If ever thou fle / Reason and sue folly
when onys thou felest / the sinert of mysery
But be of confort / hardely god shall send
Both gostly aid / and worldly help also
And I shall never / fayll unto thy lyfes end
To mynyster unto the / as me owes to do
To yender the world / which thou must nedys to
Now shape the thither / there is no more to say
Thy lord and mine / guide the in thy way
Then Nature goes out.
sensua Well lady nature leave / ye me in this case
Shall I have of you / none other confort
By christ yet / will I not hyde my face
For as soon as we / shall to the world resort
I put no doubt / he will me support
He has been my good master meny a day
And he will not se me / thus cast away

Reason. (...)
^
(...) and wotyst not why
(...) body / will demean him thus
be sure thy mind (...) all erronyous
(...) self well / and (...)
Which (...) thyn and others confusyon

sensua ye Reason sir ye speak (...) a noble man
but yet are ye take / with a (...) of ouersyght
What would ye make me / stand as a sordan
And not speak ane word / for mine own right
I se yt well / that if your lordshyp might
by means possible / onys bring yt about
your self should be a ruler / and I but a cast out

Rea. A rular? certes and so I owght to be
and a lord also / though ye say yt in scorn

sensua A lord? whose lord.

Rea. Thy lord

sensua Nay so mote I the
thou lie / yt may no lengar be forborne
thou camyst but to night / and may hap go to morn
For if thou be as haute / as thou begynnest
thou shall avoid / myche sonar than thou wenuyst

Rea. As for mine auoydaunce / how sone so ever yt be
It shall not skyll / as for this intent
But he that first flees / or forsakes me
He shall have gretest / occasyon to repent
It shall be to his great trouble and turment
that he has lest Reason / and suyd his own folly
that thereby is fallen / to wreched penury
But now as touching / the honor and degree
that I am ordained to / I will thou understand
that almighty god / of his grace and bountye
Of the and such / has given me the over hand
And will that I use / the as a seruand
to advise the and reform the / when thou gynst to err
And to clepe the homward / if thou rayll to far
And where thou say / thou art so necessary
that man without the / can have no living
as in that point / we shall not myche vary
I wot thou art necessary / to his being
But be thou sure / that is not the very thing
That makes him / to appear so wonderouse
and to be in his nature so noble and precyouse
(...) a thing that does (...) far excede
All other perfecc^^s / and virtuous natural
For sensualyte / in very deed
Is but a mean / which causes him to fall
In to much folly / and makes him besty all
So that there is no dyfference / in that at the lest
Bytwyxt man / and an unreasonable best
But this other / comes of great tenderau^ce
and spyrytuall love / that god owes to mankind
whom he has create / to his own semblaunce
and endued / with a wonderouse mind
whereby he may well dyscerne and find
Suffysant dyfference / bytwyxt good and bad
Which is to be left / and which is to be had
Lo this is yt / that does him dygnyfye
and causes him to be / reputed so excessent
and of all this / the chyef doar am I
which from heaven in to earth by god am sent
Only for that cause / and fynall intent
That I should this his creature / demean and guyd^
For the season that he does in this world abide
Now compare thy virtues / and mine togeder
and say which is / the wurthyar of them to

sensua Which is the worthyar? forsooth I trow neither
we be good felowys.

Re. Nay my friend not so
Thou ought to obey me / where so ever I go

sensua Nay that shall I never do / for to dye
I shall be thy fellow be / look thou never so hye
And therefore hardely / be somewhat selo wlyke
Leave thyn hawt conceytys / and take a metely way
For shame of the world man / let us not styk
at a matter of tyght noght / and trauers here all day
Have me in few wordys man / and hark what I say
Medyll thou in no point / that belongs to me
and I shall promise the / neu er to medyll with the
And standing the nonage / of this gentylman
On my parell / take no care therefore
I shall demean yt / as well as I can
till he be passyd. xl. yerys and more
and reason then / if ye will vndershore
His crooked old age / when lusty youth is spent
Than take upon you. I hold me content
For trust ye me / the very troth is this
this man is put / in his own lybertye
And certainly / the fre choice is his
Wheder he will be governed / by the or by me
Let us therefore put yt / to his own ieopardye
and therein stand / to his arbytrement
To which of us twain / he had sever assent

Rea. Nar syrnot so / I know his fraylte
the body is / dysposed for to fall
Rather to the worse / than the better part
Butrt be helped / by power supernall

sensua yet Reason / when thou have said all
if thou se him not / take his own way
Call me cut / when thou metest me another day

Rea. For cartayne yet / according to mine office
I must aduertyse / and counsel him at the lest
to hawnt virtue / and schew all vice
And therein assyst him / to the vttermest
and if he will / algatys be a best
And take none head / to my lore and doctrine
The parell and hurt / shall be his and not mine

Inno. Syrs I shall answer / for this man as yet
That he is maiden / for all such folly
as should dystayne nature / or dishonor yt
Brought up with me / full well and tenderly
wherefore I dare / the surelyar testyfye
for innocencye / that he is yet vyrgyn
Both for deed / and eke consent of syn
And lengar will not I be of his acquayntaunce
Than he is virtuous / and of good living
for fleshly lust / and worldly plesaunce
is with innocencye / nothing according
But if his behauyour / and daily demeanyng
Be of such draught / as reason will allow
I shall him favor / and love as I do now

sensua Well spoken and wisely / now have ye all done?
Or have ye ought else / to this man to say

Rea. O sir ye.

Sensualy. piece no more of this dysputacyd
Here be many fantasyes / to drive forth the day
That one chatreth like apye / that other like aiay
And yet when they both / have done what they can
Ma^gry them teeth / I shall rule the man

Man. O blessed lord / what manner stryf is this
At wyxt my reason / and sensualyte
That one meneth well / and that all other amysse
In one is sekernes / and in the other great fraylte
And both they be / so annexed to me
That nedest I must / with one of them abide
Lord as thou thynkyst best / for me do provide
For I am wonderously / entryked in this case
and almost brought / into perplexyte
Not wythstandyng / thanked be thy grace
as I did never assent / ne aggre
To thing that should / be contraryouse unto the
Of sinful ded / and thought all innocent
Subduyd to reason / as his obedyent

Rea. Christ grant you therein / good contynuaunce
to be ever / of the same mind and intent
But now will ye call / to your remembrance
For what cause / ye be hyder sent
I hold yt well done / and right expedyent
that ye were brough / unto the worldys presence

Man. Be yt so in goddys name / I pray you go we hens

Rea. And will ye that I / shall for you declare
Unto the world / the cause of your coming
What is your intent / and what parson ye are

Man. ye I would be glad / that every thing
Be done even / after your deuysyng

sensua Shall I than stand / as I were tongue tide

Man. ye hardely / till reason have said

Rea. Sir world / yt is the mind and also pleasure
Of lady nature / as she bad us to you tell
that ye accept / and receive this her creature
With you for a season / here to dwell
Despryng you heartily / to entreat him well
with all the favor / that ye can deuyse
Wherein ye shall do her / great pleasure and service

The world. Syrs ye be welcome / to us heartily
your messagye is / to us right acceptable
Be ye assured / there is nothing erthly
to us so joyful / ne yet so delectable
As to be acquaynted / with parsons honorable
Namely souch / as ye seem to be
Men of high honor / and of great dygnyte
And as touching the message / that ye have brought
Have thereof / the full mind and intent
Assuryng you that our bysy thought
Shall Be to do / dame naturys commandment
and thereunto / we will be dylygent
To do her pleasurys / in that we may
And so we would / ye should to her say
And were ye show / unto me that this man
Is ordained to reygne / here in this empry
I assent well / for or nature began
To shape the world / the thought finally
to ordeyne man / therein to occupy
He to take upon him / as mighty gouerner
Having all thing / subdued to his power.
Wherefore I receive / greatly his coming
Mankind sir / heartily welcome ye be
ye are the parsone / without faynyng
that I have evermore / desired to se
Come let me kys you. O benedycyte
ye be all naked / alas man why thus
I make you sure / yt is right perylous.

Man. I thank you / but I need none other vesture
Nature has clothed me / as yet suffysantly
Gyltles of syn / and as a maiden pure
I were on me / the garment of innocencye

Inno. ye hardely were that garment contynually
It shall thy body / suffysantly sauegard
From stormy weder my life to ieopard

The world. Be piece / fair woman ye are not very wise
Care ye not / if this body take cold
ye must consider / this is not paradyse
Ne yet so temporate / by a thousand fold
Whose so lives here / be he young or old
He must suffer / both fervent cold and hete
And be out of temperaunce / often time in his diet
Also he must nedys / do as the world does
That intends any while / here to reygne
And follow the gyse that now a day goth
As for as his estate / may yt maintain
And who does the contrary / I will be plain
He is abyect / and despised utterly
and stands ever baneshed / from all good company
Sith god therefore / had ordained this body
To dwell here / in this erthly regyon
Of conuenyence / he must him self apply
To worldly things / and be of such condycyon
As all men be / and leave each fond opinion
That is not approuable / of wysar men than he
to take such way / yt is but vanyte.
Take this garment / man do as I you bid
Be not ashamed / hardely to do yt on
So so / now this gurdell / have gurd yt in the myd
And this for your head / go set yt upon
By the charge of me / you be a goodly on
As ever I saw / sith yt I was borne
Worth a thousand / that ye were beforne.
Give me your hand / be not in fere
Sytdown / as ye ar borne to occupye this place
I give you here / auctoryte and power
Over all thing / that conceived is in the space
Of all the earth / that rownd is in compace
To be as lord / of every regyon
and thereof I give you / pessyble possessyon.

Man. Blessed be thou / my lord most bounteouse
that of thy great / abundant cheryte
Me thy wretched creature / have honored thus
with natural gyftys / and worldly dygnyte
Now I beseke the / for thy great pity
Sith thou have set me / in so noble way
Suffer me not here after / wrechedly to decay
For certes yt is / mine hartys desire
So to demayn me / in this life present
As may be most / unto thy pleasure
and unto nature / not dysconuenyent
This is my will / and my chyef intent
this will I observe / thy grace to borow
though I therefore / suffer mouche worldly sorrow

Rea. Forsooth these wordys / be greatly to allow
if they from meke / and lowly heart proceed
Now mankind / sith thou have made this vow
Escape the thereafter / thy life to lead
And set thy world / be cousyn to thy deed
that is to say / do thou none other wise

Inno. Than thou here openly / to god do promise
ye sir and ever / look that ye abstain
Not only from deed / but also from the assent
So that ye commyt / neither of them twayn
if ye will observe / the high commandment
For surely ye may / not be cleped innocent
Nor gyltles of syn / as for as I can find
if onys ye assent / to folly in your mind.

Mundus. This is an hard word / sister that ye have spoken
An hard word surely / and an heavy sentence
But thynk ye goddys / commandment broken
For a light tryfull / and matter of insolence
Alas have ye such a spyced conscience
That will be entryked / with every merry thought
Leave yt woman leave yt. For yt is naught

loquiad ho. And man as for you / ye shall not take that way
That manner of obseruaunce / is to hard and strayte
ye must attempt the world / and therein assay
Whether ye can live / after that endrayte
These. ii. folk / harp both on refrayte
and ever enbesyeth them / to rebuke you of syn
That never was spotted / ne fownd gylty therein
take none head of them / their wordys be but wind
and as for this time / I command them to silence
And set us se now / how prately ye can find
By sage polycy / and worldly prudence
To maintain the state / in honor and reverence
that ye shall be in / while ye in the world dwell
Speak of this matter / and ponder yt well
First me seems necessary / to provide
What manner folkys / your saruauntys shall be
For surely ye ar / nothing accompanyde
according / to a man of your degree
ye have here with you. ii. parsons or. iii.
That pleases you happily / in the best wise
yet yt appears not so / to every mannys ges.
What man is this?

Man. Reason sir my chyef conselour
And this innocence / my noryce hyderto
And sensualyte that other / by whom I have power
To do / as all sensate bestys do
But reason and innocence / chyefly these two
Have the hole rule / and gouerny of me
To ^^^m eke is subdued / my sensualyte

sensua For cartayne sir / reason has done me wrong
More than ever he shall be able to recompense
God knows sir I thought / the season very long
Till we were brought / unto your presence
But now I pray you / to adnull the sentence
That nature gave unto me / by reasons advise
to my great hurt / and vttyr preindyce
And sir I ask / none amendys erthly
But that reason / may have a chek mate
A little knack / a little prayty congy
His haut courage / some thing to abate
For hyderto / he has kept great estate
And had of me / the over hand and strengar
But ye not dyspleased / I will suffer yt no lengar

Mundus. Thou have had great wrong / and that is pity
For if thou be the parson / that I take the fore
thou sholdyst be / as honorable as he

sensua Lord ye say well / but woldgod ye would se
Some manner help / and remedy for this evil
And let me not always / live this like a dryuyll

Mundus. Sir ye know well / that if so yt were
A man should suddenly / come to a strange place
Wherein he is / but alyand and stranger
He must nedys be / compelled in that case
to put him self / in the favor and grace
Of some syngler person / that can show him the way
Of all the behauour / and gyse in that contray
So yt is now / that ye be hyder sent
this contray as yet / to you unknown
In mine opinion / yt is expedyent
to take some other counsel than your own
Of well enured men / such as have grown
In worldly experyence / and have thereof the dryft
And can best for you / in time of need skyft

Homo. Certes ye move / right well and prudently
and I am well content / that yt so be
But as yet / have I not the polycy
To know which men / have most abylyte.

Mun. Dare ye commyt / the matter unto me

homo. (...) well / I am fully content
That all thing be done / by your assygnement

Mun. Tha^ thus I will / that above all thing
From hens forward / ye be like and conformable
Unto other parsones / in all your demeanyng
Namely to such / as be companable
Be they never so vycouse / or abhomynable
For every man / clepyth him wise
That does after the comen gyse.
And as for men / that should do you service
I know diverse persons / that be right honorable
That can you serve / always point deuyce
In all the world / be there none so able
So wise / so polytyke / ne yet so profitable
Lo here is one of them / that I speak fore
and he him self can tell you / where ye shall have more
Worldly affection is this mannys name
He is well brayned / and wondrous of inuencyon
a fore castyng man / and pain of shame
ye shall not find / in any christian regyon
a wyser fellow / in thyngys to be done
Specially of matters / that be concerning
Worldly pleasure / that is for you according
Suffer him therefore / never to depart
But if yt be / for matters of great substance
and for sensualyte / I pray you with all my heart
To accept him to your favor and tendraunce
He has been long / of mine acquayntaunce
and on my faith / my heart can not but grudge
To think that ye should use him as a drudge
Do as he aduyseth you / hardely now and than
and despise not / utterly his counsel
Think that ye be here / a worldly man
and must do as men / that in the world dwell
ye are not bound / to live like an angel
Ne to be as god / always immutable
Mannys nature / of him self is full miserable
I have told you now / my counsel and advise
And ye have promised / to be ruled thereby
Now set each man / execute his office
and se how wisely / ye can them occupy
To encreace the world / and yt thereto ye must apply
(...)
Now address you thereto / and demean you thus
I shall be to you ever good and prosperouse

Man. (...) of this curtesy
^nde (...) as yet, but be ye sure
I she (...) self / endeavor bysyly
to do that may be / to your pleasure
And for the season / that I shall her endure
I shall (...) / and to my power maintain
That unto you in any wise do partayne

ye worcester. Than to bygyn with all I will advise you
to put this man / from your company
I tell you / every man will despise you
As long as ye / be ruled by innocence
to follow such counsel / yt is but folly
For he can neither good neither evil
and therefore he is taken / but for a dryuyll

Man. By my faith / even as ye say
It lyketh me not right well
With innocence long to dwell
therefore according to your counsel
I will not after this day
with his company my self affere
As me wet as yt were a gray friar
I suppose there is no man here

Now by the bell yt were almys to break
Some of these knaves brows
A gentylman comys in at the dorys

Pride Pride

sensua Pride?

Pride ye sykerly
But I am cleped worship comenly
In placys where I dwell.

sensua Worship now in faith ye saw true
ye be radix viciorum. Rote of all vertew.

Pride ye ye man ye would say so if ye me knew.

sensua Turd I know you well
Sir ye are welcome as I may say
I shall bring you in service if I may
And if one man stand not in the way.

Pride One man what the devil is he

sensua By god one that loves not the
Nor me neither.

Pride I pray the tell me
what manner of man he is
And I shall give him a lift as I guess

sensua Wylt thou so doubtless.

Pride ye and that within a short process
In faith I will not mysse.

sensua Surely I can not spy the ways how

Pride Let me alone I shall do well ynow
Aquaynt me with that man and care not thou
The matter shall speed

sensua Hark cosyn first speed this matter
And if yender man make the not good chere
As any man that ever came here

Pride Sir I shall tell the how / when I am in
To thy masters service I will first begin
To set his heart on a merry pyn
And bid him make good chere
I will bid him / thynk how he is create
To be a worthy potestate
And eke that he is predestynate
to be a princes pere
And other thyngys more than this
I shall bring that heart of his
To be more howt than yt is
By a dewys ase
Specially I will commend his wit
That no man can amend yt
And that he is able thereby to sit
as a judge in comen place
And when I praise him this wise
I think his heart will begin to rise
and after that utterly despise
any opray counsel to here
He shall trust all to his own brain
and than would Reason never so feign
Though he come and such opry twayn
He shall be never the nere

sensua Surely this conseyt is well found
I shall bring the in service for twaynty pound

Pride Gramercy brother I thynk me much bound
To the forthy curtesy
But sir abide here on thing
I will not be known that yt is my sekyng

sensua No more would I for. xl. shelyng
Let me alone hardely

sensua Sir if yt please you here is come a straunge^
That never was aquaynted with you ere
Somewhat shame fast and half in fere
To put him self in prese
A goodly parsone be ye sure
Both of countenance and of feature
If he were drawn in portrayture
And a good man doubtless
ye and a wise man at all
Will yt please you that I him call
to s^che with you.

Ma. hyd him com.

S^. I shall

sensua Sir hyd him welcome for the manner sake
Another day I am sure he will crake
And say such a gentylman did him make
^ery great chere
Desire him for to dwell with you
I tell you he is a man for your prow
And knows the world well I now
No man better than he

Man. Sir ye be welcome to this place

Pride I thank you sir / but I do you trespace
to come thus homly.

Sensua. ye a parlous case
God wot ye are welcome heder
On my faith by my will
ye shall dwell with us still
Go nere to him and task your fill

Man. Now sir what have ye to say to me

Pride No great thing sir / but I come to se
And to know what manner man ye be
That all men prayseth so mouche

Man. Praise whom praise they.

Pride. Mary you
Man me.

Pride. ye sir I make mine auow
They give you a praysyng good I now

To acquaynt me with you
^ut ye may say that I am bold

Man. Nay ye ar worth thy weight of gold
Me thenketh me to you myche behold
I pray you what is your name

Pride My name is wurshyp.

Man. Wurshpp now surely
The world told me yt was my destyny
To come to wurshyp or I dye

Pride Truly I am the same

Man. Now wurshyp I pray you me tell
your wysedom and also counsel
ye can aduertyse me passing well
In thyngys that I have to do

Pride In good says any thing that I
May do to your pleasure yt is ready
I am your own and pray you heartily
That ye accept me so
But where ye ask counsel of me
Me seems ye save not your honest

Man. Mine honesty. Wherefore let se
I pray you show me why

Pride Mary sir for yt is right fyttyng
That a man of your behauyng
Should have always suffycyent conyng
Of worldly wit and polycy
To guide him self every where
And not to be led by the ere
And beg wit here and there
Of every iak a pie
ye are well complexyond be ye sure
And nature has done on you here cure
As myche as upon any creature
that ever I saw with mine eye
And by lykylyhod sir I wys
ye have wit according to all this
Dressys nature has wrought a mysse
And that is not lykely

Man. Now certain thanked be heaven king
I have a right quyk understanding
If ye show me any thing
I can sone perceive yt
But I was forbid by reason
On mine own fantasye to ron
Or to take any presumpcyon
Of mine own wit

Pride Said reason so. Mary fie on him knave
yt were better ye ha^gma^ where i^ his grave
than ever the lewd fool should have
the governance of you

Man. Certain nature aduysed me
to follow reason what time that she
Put me first in auctoryte
that I stand in now

I se well ye be but a very lad
On my faith I was very glad

He that would lordshyp enjoy

Man. ^urshyp for goddys sake grieve ye no^

Pride I wys ye ar but an ydeot
I pray you sir make not me a sot
I am no tryfler
I have been in honor here to forne
ye allow the counsel of a ^arse borne
Before mine I have ytin scorn
It is a thing I can not bear

Man. Whom mean ye Reason

Pride ye that same daw

Man. What is he a wise man

Pride ^e is astraw
Because he kepys you under aw
ye be therein blind

Man. And so does he without saynyng
for hyderto I might do nothing
but after hye will and by ddyng
And that groged my mind

Pride Grouge (...) yt is no marvel hardely
(...) shall grieve me certainly
As long as I am in your cumpany
To se you deem (...) that wise
ye be now in good way
but in faith I like not your array
It is not the fassyon that goth now a day

Man. By god that will I do goodly
but I pray you syrs do your dylygence
for this array and spare none expense
and for a while I will go hens
And come again shortly
^ere Man and Sensualyte go out.
w. aff. Brother Pride now the weight
Of all this matter rests in the

Pride Thus he thou shall se me deuyse it eue^ straight
It is but tapes that gere with me
I have none other study a days parde
but how I may new fassyons find
and thereon I set all my labor and mind
Sir our master shall have a gown
That all the galandys in this town
Shall on the fassyon wonder
It shall not be sowed but with a face
by twyxt every some a space
Of two handful a sonder
Than a doublet of the new make
Close before and open on the bak
No sleue upon his arm
Under that a shyrt as soft as sylk

Than shall his hosen be stryped

w. aff. Ha ha ha now by the mary vyrgyn
This will set him on a merry pyn
Even as yt should be
But ever I am in great fere
That Reason will whyster him in the ere
and tome his mind clean fro this gere
This thing fereth me

Pride Reason nay nay hardely
He is forsaken utterly
Sith I came to his company
He would not onys appear
Nevertheless for a surte
Worldly affection I advise the
as shortly as ever yt may be
For speed of the matter
To bring him shortly in acquayntaunce
With all the company of mine affyaunce
and settheym give contynuall attendaunce
Every man bysyly
after the propertye of his office
Than shall ye se him utterly dospyce
Reasons counsel on waran^yse
and forsake him utterly

sensua Nay nay syrs care ye nothing
That matter is sped well and fine

Pride Is yt so.

Sensua. ye by heaven king.
Even as we sat togeder at the wine

w. aff. Thou shall have goddys blessyng and mine
but is yt true

sensua ye sir by this day
Our master and Reason have made a great fray

Pride Now so

sensua (...) farth we sat together
(...) herby
(...) who should come together
(...) and margery
(...) you ^rde so pra^ly
(...) the last morning
(...) while (...) say ^pyng

Pride I (...) ye ^ne well I now
(...) that is nothing to this purpose
(...) on thy tale for god auow

sensua I (...) had I wypt my nose
(...) I spyde them anon I rose
an^ called them unto me by name
And without more taryeng anon they came
And sat down with us / and made nothing strau^g
as they be full curteys / ye know yt well
And anon our masters color bygan to change
whereof yt came / I can not tell
His chere was appalled / every dell
and scant that he could speak to me one word
But s^ert him even up and rose fro the board
He said he would go / ly down on a bed
and prayed me for the manners sake
That margery might com hold his head
Which as he told me / bygan to ache
And so she has him undertake
To make him hole / in an hour or twain
when soever he has any such soden pain
What yt means I wot never
But he syketh her phy^yk so well
That I trow the devil of hell
Can not them two dysseuer
Lo this have I done / and what trow ye more
yet can I tell you better tydyng

Worldly aff. what is that.

sensua Mary Reason that ye two spoke of before
Ca^ even to us as we sat so drynkyng
And gave our master an hete worth an hangyng
Because that margery sat on his kne
while that other hoar sat talkyng with me
My master saw that he could have no rest
Never be ryd of this controllyng
He prayed the man and thought yt best
(...) my (...)
(...) ^ut more ta^yeng
(...) Reason so (...) the head
(...) ^ruayll but he be now deed

w. aff. (...) ^an fill all the cups at ones
(...) this be true

sensua (...) these, (...)
(...) never a word

Pride Trowyst thou yt is no feigned strife
Bytwyxt them two

sensua No on my life.
For when they faught I ran between
and cried keep piece and leave debate
But ye would have laughed had ye seen
How I departed them / and for all that
Sometime I clapped Reason on the pate
and cried keep the piece as fast as I could
Till I was horse I cried so loud

w. aff. But can our master play the man now
and fare with this gere

sensua ye make god auow
And beware ye of one thing
Medyll ye no more with margery
For by cokkys precyouse body
If our master may yt espy
Or have an understanding
That ye use her company
I tell you he will be angry
He is so full of ielosy
As ever I knew man

w. aff. Ielosy piece man be still
He can thereof no manner of skyll

sensua No but say what ye will
I am sure he can
He is now as famylyer
With bodily lust as ever ye were
ye and thereto as great a swerer
When time requyres
Knew I never of his age
A man of better courage
To do all manner of outrage
After our desires
Sith Reason and he were thus at varyaunce
He has be full of such dalyaunce
And both called to his favor and a^quayntaunce
^ur (...) by and by
^uy wreth glotony and co^se
Sloth and lechery become to his ser^yce
And utterly he hatyth their (...)
And that he professes o^enly

w. aff. And be these folk of his retynue

sensua ye euerychon on I tell you true
But mary there names be changed new
For to blere his eye
I tell you he is a serefull man
For Reason styrreth him now and than
And therefore do we what we can
It is little I now hardely
Sir a there is first Pride as ye wot well
The sweet darlynge of the devil of hell
How his name is changed ye can tell

w. aff. ye mary on the best wise
Wurshyp I wene is now his name

sensua ye by the rode even the same
And couetyse to eschew all blame
Does his name dysgyse
And calls him self worldly polycy
Wreth because he is somwat hasty
Is called manhood. Then is there envy
and he is called dysdayn
Glotony for good felyshyp is taken
and sloth his old name has forsaken
And as fair a name has he shapen
as ever man could ordayn
He is called ease right confortable to the blod
Specially for them that lust to do no good
and among all other I would ye understood
That lechery is called lust
Lo these be fair names parde
Both good and honest as seems me
as for their condycyons what they be
ye know well

w. aff. ^ery just
I know their condycyons on the best wise
if they keep still their old gyse

sensua yes that they do on warantyse

w. aff. But yet I have gr^t maruay^
that couetyse should dwell in his company

sensua (...) troth so / and so have I
But one thing I ensure you faithfully
And that I have espied well
that (...) ^derto our master sets no store
By his council nor his lore
Mary when his head waxes hoar
than shall be good season
To follow couetyse and his way
ye time I now another day
Even so I hard our master say

w. aff. By my faith he said but reason
but all the remanent be well retained

sensua ye be ye sure yt is matter unfeigned
And wot ye who is gretely dysdayned
With our master now

Pride Who

sensua By god even shamfastnes
when he shall do any such excess
No shame can fere him doubtless
I may say to you

Pride No than the craft were naught
but now syrs well bethought
Sith the matter is hereto brought
It is time for me
To go and make some prouysyon
Of garmentys after the new inuencyon
As he commanded me to be don
thereto must I se
For yt is committed to my negligence
And if he come hyder while I am hens
I pray the excuse mine absens

sensua ye and mine also

Pride Why wylt thou go with me

sensua Will I quod a ye parde
It is according for Sensualyte
With Pride for to go

w. aff. Now ye matter is all most in good case
After the world is mind and pleasure
there is no more / but now must I cupace
With all my wit and besy endeuure
how it may be stablysshed and co^tynued sure
For a little fantasy of mannys own will
May quayll this matter and utterly yt spy^
And if he vary again
of scrypyll ymagynacyon
Or else by the suggestyon
Of the foresaid reason
One thing I am certain
He will no lengar me support
And that were a shrewd crank dor^
Therefore yt is best that I resort
to my masters presence
And se of what demeanor he is
I am gretely to blame I wys
For that I saw him not or this
Sith he departed hens.
He goes out and Reason comes in.
Rea. O good lord / to whom shall I complayn
And show the sorrows of my mind
and nothing for mine own cause certain
But only for the decay of mankind
which now of late is waxen so blind
That he has despised and forsaken me
And follows every mocyon of his sensualyte
What aduayled at the beginning
that Nature comytted me to his service
and charged me that before all thing
Of all his gydyng I should take thenterpryse
when he lusts not to follow mine advise
but follows thappety^ of his sensual affection
As a brute best that lakketh reason
And yet not wythstandyng
that he does me dysdayn
I will resort to him again
And do my labor and bysy pain
To assay if I can him refrayn
^ro such bestly living
but first will I stand hereby
In secret manner to espy
Some token of grace in him whereby
I may dyscerne and find
that he has any shamfastnes
After his great surfeit and excess
And if yt be so doubtless
It sha^ content my my^
Man comes in. I say syrs where is wurshyp can ye tell
In this place I left him last

w. aff. Sir I warand you he is occupied well
In ordeynyng your garmentys full fast
He departed fro me in great have
For that intent / and so he desired
That I would tell you when need required
He showed me his mind or he went
How he had devised your garment
And if yt be made after that intent
as he told me
When ye were on that vestour
Every man shall do your honor
as becummeth a man of your hauyour
And so yt should be

Man. ye but what will Reason say
When he sees me in that array

w. aff. Reason. Mary let him go play
To the devil of hell
He promised me at the beginning
That ye would no more be under his gydyng

Man. No but yet yt were according
To have therein his counsel
Man without reason is but blind
And if I should speak after my mind
I can well a dyfference find
Bytwyxt man and a best
When he has Reason in presence
and duly obeys his saw and sentence

w. aff. Why have ye such a spyced conscience
Now within your breast
that changes your mind so suddenly
I am sorry and ashamed truly
On your behalf

Man. No force hardely
Thouledest me all wrong
and therefore will I no more follow the

w. aff. Not worldly affection?

Man. Nparde
Nor yet thy brother Sensualyte
I have followed you to long

w. aff. Is that your mind

Man. ye doubtless
And now will I seek shamefastnes
By whom I trust I shall redress
All my mysded

w. aff. And sith thou wylt nedys to shame bow
I pray god send the shame I now
and yet I trust make god auow
Ones thou shall have need
To call me again to thy service

Man. Nay nay on warantyse
Now syrs who can me advise
what is best to do

Shamfastnes. Sir if ye lust to have mine acquayntaunce
I am ready to give you attendaunce
Happily my service shall you advance
I am called shamfastnes

Man. By your troth are ye the same

sham. ye forsooth that is my name
Almys dedys I can attame
And help for to repress
when ye have done offense or syn
if ye will mercy and grace wyn
with shame fastnes ye must bygyn
This way must ye take

Man. ye be the man without faynyng
That I wysshed for / or ye came here
and glad am I now of your coming
Prayng you with heart entere
when I have need thus to com nere

sham. So will I do ye may trust yt verily
When soever ye call ye shall find me ready
He goes out
Rea. Sir is yt your mind to do as ye say

Man. ye that is yt as god me speed
Hard ye all this matter ye or nay

Rea. yes that I did in very ded

Man. O gostly reason I have greter need
Of your help than ever I had before
Help me now and I shall never forsake you more
Sith I forsook your cumpany
I have committed myche folly

I am ashamed certainly
when I think thereon
Bu^ now have I refused (...)
All such manner of cumpany
and three have I done verily
Of mine own mocyon

Rea. Than my help shall be ready as often as ye me ta^
It is my duty so for to do
And of your offenses will I make no rehersall
But what soever ye have done hyderto
To me ward set yt pass and go
Against god your offense is great
Of the which matter I will not long treat
But this confort of me ye shall have
if ye be contryte as ye pretend
God is mercyable if ye lust to crave
Call for grace and sone he will yt send
And be not in purpose hereafter to offend
accustom your self in the ways of virtue
And be not in doubt grace will ensue

Man. Sir yt is my mind and intent
Hereafter to be your true obedyent
and never more to assent
To such folly again

Rea. And upon that condycyon
I take the unto my tuycyon
with all hartys affection
Never to part at wayn
And for this seson
Here we make an end
Lest we should offend
This audyence / as god defend
It were not to be don
ye shall understand never thelesse
That there is myche more of this process
wherein we shall do our besynes
and our true endeuure
To show yt unto you after our guyse
when my lord shall so deuyse
It shall be at his pleasure

Thus ends the first part.
The second part^.
Reason and Man come i^.
I assemble the life of mortal creature
To the allyege again a s^rong town or castle
In which there is myche b^st endenure
myche warly polycy with bysy trauayll
On every side which par^e shall prey ayll
By sleyght of ingyns or by strong power
that other to subdue and bring into danger
In such case and manner of condycyon
Is wreched man here in this life erthly
While he abides within the garyson
Of the frayll carcas and carynouse body
Whom to impugn laboreth incessantly
the world / the flesh / the enemy / these three
Him to subdue and bring into captyuyte
And for to show you what wise they us ipugn
First does the world give us an allectyfe
to couetryches and worldly renown
With other vanyteys that be used in this life
Next that our flesh which ever is in stryse
again our spyryte / does provoke and excyte
Is to accomplish our sensual appetyte
The last of all is our great enemy
Which ever has us in contynuall haterede
Of old enkankred malice and envy
that he owes to us and all the kynrede
Of all the aunceters of whom we do succeed
Nor yetcesseth his malice unto this day
Is to endaunger in all that he can or may
And certes these our said enemies
Be of their nature so mighty and so strong
That hard yt will be for us in any wise
Again them war or battle to vnderfong
also our garrisons and fortress to mayntayn long
Again their ingens without spyrytuall grace
We can not perform in no manner case
Wherefore yt is to us right behouable
Besyly to pray to god that is immortal
Besechyng him as he is mercyable
To have compassyon and pytye on us all
And not to suffer us any wise to fall
Into such folly and utter myschaunce
Is (...) them grieve and do (...)
Also yt behooves on our part
To fle all such manner of occasyon
as may be put in fere and Ieoparde
Of their dyspleasure in any con^^^cyon
New fangl^s and c(...)nyce (...)
we must forsake in all manner wise
And acquaynt us with their contrar^se
Quia contraria contrariis curantur. etc.
I tell this tale sir to you
Trustyng that yt be not done in wast
ye remember as I suppose well I now
Now yt is not fully. in. days past
Sith ye me promised and bound yt fast
From that day forth to be obedyent
unto my counsel and aduysement
Man. ye sir so I did in very ded
And yet yt is my mind and intent
To follow the same have ye no dread

Rea. if ye do not your self shall repent
Now fare ye well for I must be absent
As for a season / and for your confort
when so ever ye call me I shall to you resort
Then he goes out and Sensua. comes in.
sensua God forbed that ever he com again
Jesus how may ye this life endure
Me seems yt should be to you a great pain
Sith ye be of good complexyon and nature
To forbere the worldly sport and pleasure
As ye have done now a great seson
and all by the folyshe counsel of reason
Where is your lusty heart bycom
That served you so well this other day
Now so help me god and halydom
I have great marvel how ye may
Live in such mysery / and this dare I say
without ye take some other ways
By my troth yt will shorten your days
And though I say yt that were pity
For by christ and ye were gone
Meny a good fellow would make great moan
Then he wepyth
Man. Why weep ye so

sensua let me alone
It will none other wise be
and ye saw the sorrowful countenance
Of my cumpany your old acquayntaunce
that they make
For your sake
I dare say ye would moan them in your mind
They be so loving and so kind
That I am sure
if ye endure
In this peuyshe opinion
It will be their confession
There is none other remedy
But for sorrow they shall dye

Man. Nay god forbed they should so do

sensua In faith without ye help thereto
There is none other way

Man. I will help yt in all that I may
And I wist by what mean

sensua Mary call them to your cumpany

Man. By saint Iha^n I am content
For I may say here to the
Sith I forsook my lyberte
And did to Reason assent
I had never merry day
But lived under awe and dread always
Nothing to mine intent
Another while I will me dysport
and to mine old cumpany resort

sensua O than shall ye them confort
and your self also
Wot ye who will be very glad

Man. Who

sensua Margery

Man. Why was she sad

sensua ye by the mass she was stark mad
Even for very woe
When she hard tell of this chance
And because she would live in penance
Her sorrow for to quench
She has entered into a relygyouse place
At the grene frerys hereby

Man. ye hase.
Alak good (...) wenche
Is yt an house of strayt relygyon

sensua ye as any that ever was bygon
Sith the world stood

Man. Be they close nonnes as other be

sensua Close quod a nay nay parde
That gyse were not good
ye must beware of that gere
Nay all is open that they do there
As open as a gose eye

Man. And comes any man into their sellys

sensua ye ye god forbede else
It is fre for every body
And bysyde all this they be
Ex omni gente cognite
No nacyon they forsake
Without yt be beggars going by the way
That have never a penny to pay
For that that they do take
And yet can I beggars thyderlede
Where they shall be for lumpes of bread
Satysfye their desire
Such drabbes some there be
That require none other fe
Nor yet any other hyre

Man. Be they not wedded as other folk be

sensua Wedded quod a no so mot I the
They will nottary therefore
they can wed them self alone
Com kys me Iha^n gramercy Ione
This wed they ever more
And yt is the more to comend
For if the woman hap to offend
as yt is their gyse
a man may let her alone with sorrow
and wed another hoar on the morrow
Even of the same wise

Man. Forsooth this is a noble relygyon
It styrreth me to great devotion
For to se that place
Can thou bring me thither well I now

sensua ye and yt were myd night I make god auow
As dark as ever yt was

Man. But where is bodily lust now

bodyly Then comes in bodyly lust with him w. aff.
Mary sir I have sytten and sought you

Man. This three or. iiii. howrys
I make god auow
ye give shrewd attendaunce

bodyly All this. ii. days I could not the espy
Sir ye know well that ye and I
Be never myche a sonder

Man. albe yt I be from you among
And now me seems thou have tarried to long

bodyly which is to me great wonder
Wonder ye parde for an howr or twayn
Forth for a passing while and com again
Here is a sore matter
when was I so long absent as now
and yet I was for to seek you
at the the other side of the water
The place that ye wot of parde

Man. Understand ye what ye mean

bodyly ye ye

Man. Tell me in mine ere

bodyly Quid est latinum propter le stewys
What laten now this of the newys
I herd never this ere

Man. I trow ye begin to wax shamfast
Nay nay hardely that gere is past
Meny days a gone

bodyly I am as wanton as ever I was
It were alms to hang you else by the mass
By the hard neck bon
But will ye now go with me to a place
and I shall show you the smorterst place

Man. That ever ye saw with eyes

bodyly What thing is yt young or old
What ever yt be yt is able to be sold

Man. It shall like you on the best wise
For my love let us some night be there
at a banquet or a rere supper
and get us some wanton mete
So we may have some deynty thing
yet would I spend. xx. shyllyng
where so ever I yt get

bodyly Nay nay will ye spend a coyell of crowns
and there shall no gentylman in this. x. towns
Be better served than ye
Nor be received more honestly
As to an house of bawdry
For a banquet or ^nkry
For a dyshe. ii. or three

Man. yes that will I spend with all mine heart

bodyly By your leave I will depart
To make ready this gere

Man. What now in all this have

bodyly ye for god sir I am a gast
that other knaves will come theder
before us and take up all

Man. Se there to I pray the

bodyly So I shall
Else fie on all together
Then goes he out.
w. aff. Now will margery make great moan
because ye com not.

Man. ye let her alone
I am not her bond man parde
She has dysappoynted me or now

w. aff. yet on my faith sir and I were as you
at the least I would excuse me
Send her word that ye in no wise
May this night keep her promise
And if ye do not so
She will so morn that as I thynk
Of all this night she will sleep no wynk
She shall be so full of woman. ye on my parell take no care
This answer will I deffar and spare
till I be certain
what answer bodyly lust shall bring
Of this other praty new thing
when he comes again

w. aff. Will yt please you that I go to mergery
In your stead

Man. Mary that were merry
woldyst thou serve me so

w. aff. Why sir by my troth I mean but well

Man. ye what thou menyst I can not tell
But that shall thou not do

w. aff. In good faith sir ye may do wurs
For while I have any thing in my purs
Or any penny to spend
I will make her even such chere
As I would mine own wife if she were here
Else god defend

Man. ye I thank the for thy good will
But as for that chere keep yt still
Till I call thereon

w. aff. By god sir for good love I spoke yt
And now that I se ye will not take yt
I shall let yt alone

Man. How now have thou been yender away

bodyly ye sir.

Man. Et que nouellys

bodyly Ie nescey
I could not speak with her
No with none of her folkys

Man. Not with one

bodyly No they be a sleep euerychone
All that ever dwell there

Man. How know thou wether they be a sleep or n^

bodyly Mary she her self told me so
when I rapped at the door

Man. It seems she was not a sleep than

bodyly No she was a bed with a strange man

Man. A myschefe on her hoar
I would this fire were i her tayll I make god auow

bodyly That needs not she is hot I now
It were more alms to get
Some cold water her fire to quench
I tell you yt is as warm a wenche
As any in all this street
I supposed I had angered her ill

Man. How so

bodyly For I rang her a knyll
That waked her from her sleep
I gave her a pele for her frendys soulys
a man might have hard the noys from poulys
To the farthest end of chepe
She saw that I would not feace but knok
And rap still at the gate
She opened a wyndow and put forth her head
Hens. xl. d. quod she. Iak noble is a bed
This (...) ye come ^o (...)
I ha stands the wynd so cold quod I
(...). q. title we have a bry
This gere goes all wide
And so I came thens a great pace
till I came hyder / lo this is the case
Have I not well hyde

Man. Well man there is no more to do
that we cannot have we must forgo
there is none other remedy
Lo worldly affection now may thou se
Thy counsel was naught that thou gave me

w. aff. No more yt was truly

Man. ye I told the asmyche before
It is good to be sure ever more
therefore now let us go
And resort again to our old hosts
that is the best way now as I guess

w. aff. ye hardely do so
Then they three go out and Pride comes in.
Pride Syrs remember ye that this other day
Man promised me even in this stead
that I should with him dwell and now I here say
The wild worm is com into his head
So that by reason only he is led
It may well be so / but I am sure
that Reason shall not always with him endure
Me thinks that Sensua. does not his part
according to the duty of his office
for no body can better torn a mannys heart
Nor yet a redyer mean deuyse
to put away such folyshe fantasyse
than Sensualyte if he lust to assay
for he is chyef ruler when Reason is away

sensua ye / a ruler will I be though Reason say nay

Pride Ah Sensualyte welcome by this day
what tydyngys good

sensua ye by my fay
as good as can be told
I have brought this man to his old gyse

Pride Have thou so

sensua ye on warantyse

Pride Now forsooth I give the pryk and pryse
Thou (...)
Of this tydyngys I am glad and fayn
But shall I be welcome to him again
and all our cumpany

sensua ye hardely
as welcome as ever ye ware before

Pride Goddys blessyng have thyn heart therefore
thus am I in thy det more and more

sensua Iapes why say ye so

Pride for I speak yt after my mind
thou art to me always so kind
But where shall I our master find
to him will I go

sensua He is besy hark in your ere
with little margery ye wot where
And as soon as I had brought him there
I came my way a pace
and because he should not be alone
I left with him worldly affection
and other erand had I none
Now to this place
but even to show you what is done
and from hens I must anon
for to seek an other companyon
to give attendaunce

Pride Who is that

sensua Mary glotony
Our master calls for him besyly
Sawyst thou him not

Pride No certainly
To my remembrance

sensua I must go seek him without any taryeng
But Pride I warn you of one thing
While I thynk thereon
when my master and ye shall mete
In any wise se that ye him great
In the old fassyon
And make as though ye know nothing
Of his diverse and varyable dealyng
Keep that in your breast
ye can not do him more dyspleasure
Than thereof to make reporture
Therefore let yt rest
(...) ^gh treson
Then he goes out.
(...)de (...) g^ad ye warn me thus in seson
(...) the better were
B^th ^s warnyng I shall be wise
And do as ye me aduertyse
take thereof no ca^

Sloth. Will ye be wise quod a / mary that is a thing
By god ye had need to have better warnyng
Or ye bring that about

(...)de What brother Sloth fro whens comyst thou

(...)h. Straight fro my bed I make god auow
Mine eyes be almost out
for lak of sleep / but this sir to you
Me thought ye called me sloth right now
Piece no more of that
I have a new name as well as ye

(...)de What is that / ease

(...)h. ye parde
But yt forces not
while our master is not present
Between us twayn I am content
Call me what ye will
But where is our master

(...)de Wotest thou nere

(...)h. No

(...)de No more do I

(...)h. There there there
Thou shall dwell with me still
Thou art as good a wayter as I

(...)de I shrew the better of us both hardely
But surely we do not well
we shall not continue with yonder man
but we awayte better now and than
Therefore by my counsel
Let us twayn go together
To seek our master

(...)h. But wotyst thou whether
we shall now go
To find our master

(...)de I shall assay
Thou shall se me guess the way
And happily find him to
Now must I to the stews as fast as I may
to ^ech this gentylman but syrs I say
Can any man here tell me the way
For I came never there
ye know the way parde of old
I pray the tell me which way shall I hold
will ye se this horson cocold
I trow he cannot here
Now yt were alms to clap the on the crown
Then comes in man and worldly aff.
Man. Why be there any cocoldys in town

Pride ye I durst hold thereon my gown
that there be a score
but for god I cry you mercy
for by my says I wist you not so ny
Had I wist yt I ensure you faithfully
that word I would have forbore

Man. No force hardely yt touches not me
But wurshyp tell me where have ye be
Me thinks long sith I you se

Pride Sir yt is no marvel
Bad ye not me the last day
To go puruey for your array
And ye remember well

Man. ye for god have ye done the same

Pride ye by the rode else were I to blame
All thing is ready in pain of shame
Else I quyte me ill
The tailor told me yester night
that all your garmentys were ready dyght
will ye go thither and have a sight

Man. ^emary with a good will

sloth. Will ye that I go with you also

Man. I wot never whether ye may attend thereto
for ye do nothing
But even after your own sweet will

sloth. Why should I ever wayt nay that I nyll
for to be a king
I may not endure contynuall besynes
I was never used thereto doubtless
I should not live a year
if I followed you I am sure
(...) and ^our ^ut of me sure
I saw never your pere
He wene there can nothing be do
But if ye put your hand thereto
and I wrs that is no need
ye have seruauntys that be true and just
if yt would like you to put them in trust
And quyte well they ^e mede
what should I attend you for to please
when I se well ye set by none ease
which belongs to me

Man. Why ease what means the thus to say
I do but ete drynk sleep and play
And none other labor parde

sloth. ye / ye may say what ye will
But I can never se you ydell
And quyete as ye should be
your body laboreth as does an hakney
That bareth the burdon every day
That pytye yt is to se
And your mind on that other side
Is never Idell nor unoccupied
I wys yt greueth me
To se you demeaned that wise
I trow ye be set all on couetyse

Man. Cou^tyse / nay let be
It is a thing of greter cure
That stycketh in my mind be thou sure

sloth. So me thought by the rode
I wist as myche there was some thing
By your ^o wring chere and your syghyng
That was not all thing good
But what is the matter I pray you heartily

Man. I wys thou can not deuyse the remedy
with all the wit thou have
But this is the case to tell yt shortly
A thing was told me as I came hereby
Now Reason puruayth fast
And makes very great labor and ordinance
To dashe us all out of countenance
And for that purpose
He has gadred a great cumpany

sloth. What to do

(...). I wore nere I
But as I suppose
It is to bring me in captyuyte
And to take from my l^berte
So he has often said

Pride ^ere ye that matter

Man. Nay never a dell
but I care for yt wit ye well
Yet am I not afraid
For I wist wythstand yt proudly
and syrs I trust ye will stand thereby
when yt shall be need

Pride ye by the way that god went
Or he have of you his intent
First shall I blede
The best blood that is in this carcas

Man. Well ease go thy way hens a pace
and make therein good speed
Call my cumpany all togeder
and bid them every man com heder
That is with me affeed

sloth. Mary sir that shall be do
Then he goes out.
Man. Wurshyp in the mean time let us go
To se my new apparel

Pride Will ye so. Now for your ladies sake
Go do yt on you and I undertake
It shall become you well

Man. Worldly affeccy on abide thou here
For I will go do on this new gere
as wurshyp does me counsel
Then Man and Pride goes out.
w. aff. Mary I shall with all mine heart
this good fire and I will nor depart
For very cold mine hand is do smart
It makes me woe bygon
Get me a s^ole here may ye not se
Or e^ys a chayr will yt not be
thou pyld knave I speak to the
Now ^ong shall I stand

Glotony. ^et him stand with a foul evil
^
(...) ye se so / every dr^uyll
Now adays I w^rand
Must command as he were a king
Let him stand on his sete with bredyng

w. aff. What Glotony / I can tell the one thing
In faith you will be shent

gloto. Why

w. aff. My master has sent Sensualyte
To seek the all about the contre
Spakest thou not with him

gloto. yes parde
I know all his intent
And thereuppon I am com here
For to awa^t / but wotest thou where
Our master is now

w. aff. Nay I wot nere
I am not very certain
But Pride and he together begone
Ne said he would com again anon
within an howr or twayn
Tarry thou here and go net away
I will go break my fast and I may
For I ete never a morsel this day
Then he goes out.
gloto. Mary that is a thing
Go when thou wist I will abide
My stomak he shall not rule or gyde
That is now fasting
Nay of all thing erthly I hate to fast
Four times a day I make repast
Or thryse as I suppose
And when I am well fed
Than get I me to a soft bed
my body to repose
There take I a nap or twayn
^p I go straight and to yt again
Though nature be net ready
yet have I some mete of delight
For to provoke ^happetyte
And make the stomak gredy
After all this nedys I must
Sometime follow the wanton lust
For hot drynkys and delycate reflecyon
Causes flesshely insurreccyon
ye know yt as well as I

Man. Troth as ye say I know yt well

gloto. What gentylman is this can ye tell

bodyly. Wotyst thou never

gloto. No by the bell
I saw him never before

bodyly Is yt our master

gloto. Nay by the rood
It is not he woldyst thou make me wood

Man. yes I am the same

gloto. I cry you mercy I se yt well now
Before I knew you not I make god auow
In ernest nor in game

Man. Why. Because I have changed mine array

gloto. For that cause trow ye nay nay
That is not the thing
That can dysceyue me be ye sure
but I pray you who has had you in cure
Sith my last departing

Man. By my faith a little season
I followed the counsel and diet of reason

gloto. There went the hare away
His diet quod a / yt may be verily
For ye be haltred maruelously
Altered I would say
alas the while had ye no mete
As long as ye were under his diet

Man. Mete / yes I had some
without yt were on fasting days
Than he wythdrew my supper always
and gave me never a crom

gloto. No force hardely why would ye than
favor him as ye did like a madman
ye look now as yt were a ghost
Had ye dwelt with him till this day
ye had been pyned even away
as ye be now almost
your flesh is gone every dell
A vengeance on the morsel
That is left thereon

bodyly Now talk of the remedy

gsoto. (...) now (...) the (...) and (...) safe

bodyly ye bu^ where ye the m^te now (...)

gsoto. ye are ^yng hasty be ne d^
frist must ye go
where as prouer spon thereof ye made
Let ve go thither and re shall be had

Man. But what to the marsiers of the in
A weddyd woman or a vyrgyn

gloto. Nerther of both I ioys

bodyly (...) No / but for a maiden she goth

gloto. ye forgod that she does
But yet she ye none by Iye

bodyly No / no / what than

gloto. I wye I not / but as men clater
They say she ye innupta matter
Hardely an holy woman

Man. Well thither we will / go we hens

bodyly Sir ye will give me license
To sport me for a season

Man. yes for a while ye well I now
but go not out of the way I charge you
for hyder will come anon
All my cumpany as I suppose
Keep them together for I purpose
to come again anon
and show them my mind what I will do
Then he goes out
bodyly Mary I shall do what I can thereto
and yet yt ye hard for me
to keep them together any while
But I shall tell you what
I had sever keep as many flese
Or wyld hares in an opyn lose
as undertake that

Wrath. Wherebe these knaves that make this array

bodyly Mary they be gone that other way
tell me whom ye mean

wrath. I trow thou scornyst

bodyly Nay certainly
How so be yt if I should not ly
at the first blushe I ensure you faithfully
I f^nd forgot you (...)
(...) ye be thus defensybly arayd
(...) at that are ye affrayd
who fiath you grieved

wrath. Nay I fere no man that bears an he
(...) I sever that I were deed
than that should be preued

bodyly By my faith ye are wont to be as bold
as yt were a lion of cottyswold
but now to my questyon
what means all this defensyble array

wrath. Mary sloth warned us two this same day
Even sith yt was none
that our moyster and Reason should make a stay
and therefore he had us without delay
to awayt on our capytayn

bodyly A now I know the matter right well
But what shall com thereof I can not tell
It passes my brayn
Our master wylled that we twayn
Should tarry here till he com again

envy. What wylt thou do than

bodyly Who I Ienay care not for me
I will not com where strokys be
I am not so mad a man
And I wys yt is not for any fere
But yt is a thing that I can well forbere
And will as long as I can
Of lust and pleasure is all my mind
It longs to me of properte and kind
And if I should to the war
And ly in mine harnes as other men do
^yth hunger and thurst a day or two
It should me utterly mar

envy. It were a great loss if thou were mard
Now fie on the stath horson coward
By cokkys preciouse blood
It were no syn to sle such a knave
Host not thou wagys as other men have
And few of us so good
yet wylt thou fayll us at this need
Now who so ever shall quyte my mede

to have s^ne the knaves heart blood
than. xx. shrll^ ngys of fee

Man. What how syrs what means this gere,
will ye sle each other here
No more of this work

envy. By the heart of god and he had abyden
A little while he should never have spoken
with priest nor with clarke

Man. Who was that

envy. your own mynyon
Bodyly lust

Man. Why what has he done

envy. Even like a lurden
He says that ye have given him license,
to abide at home and keep resydence
while we bear the burden
And serve you now at your need

Man. He prayde me so in very deed
within these. ii. days
He said he would serve me with a good will
But of the warrys he could no skyll
Nor knew thereof the ways
How be yt I gave him thereof none answer

envy. No but I am sure he will not com there
And now man ye se
That no man is so myche to blame
As your self

Man. I

envy. ye by saint I am
No man but even ye
for I am well a Jured of one thing
ye gave him better clothyng
Than ye did me
And better wagys and fees also
And though I said but little thereto
But suffered ever more
yet I by ^aynd yt ever in my mind
And though that ye were to me unkind
To set so (...) at store
By such a knave as he was
I would I had him here by the mass
And no man but we twayn

Man. By my troth this is ever thy guyse
Ioke by whom I set any pryse
Him thou wylt most dysoayn

wrath. By christ he can do none other wise
but now sir is there any service
That ye will command me

Man. ye mary is there / but my cumpany
Dresseth them forward passing slowly
I trow yt will not be
Manhood thou art good I now for one

wrath. ye by christ and they came every chone
I will not greatly fere

envy. By my troth because he says so
I shall tell you what I saw him do
I was present there
Sir yt happyned in westmynster hall
Even before the Iuges all
His handys were bound fast
And never upon him that ever god made
Dager sword nor knyfe he had
And yet at the last
He drove. xii. men into a corner
and an howi after durst they not appear
How say ye hereto
and his handys had been at syberte
He wose have put them in great I eoparde
It is to suppose so

Man. Mary there he qurte him well
but where be mine other folk can ye tell
The^ comes i Glotony with a chese i a botell.

wrath. Mary here comes one
Good felyshyp me seems yt should be

Another botell I will go puruey
Lest that drynk be scarce in the way
Or happily none to sell

But I may serve to be a vyteler
And thereof shall ye have store
So that I may stand out of danger

This is even such a another dreuyll
As was here while ere

I pray god send him a shrewd wife
and than shall he have I now
But I shall tell you syrs as for me
I am none of them so mot I the
I may say to you
I will no such rekennyng is abide
Goddys body here comes Pride
as crank as a pecok
As soon as he and I mete
without he stand right upon his fete
He shall bear me a proud mok

Pride What tydyngys syrs can any man tell

envy. ye mary that can I do as well
as any that was in feld
ye have tarried so long about your gay gere
That the feld is done or ye come there

Pride Done mary god sheld

envy. It is done without fayll
But whyehe of them has wone the balayll
I can not tell you certain

Pride Thou were not there yt seems thereby

envy. Not I there quod ayes hardely / (...) that to my great
but as soon as ye batellys joined togeder (pain
I came my way straight heder / for to tell tydyng^

Pride What the devil tydyngys can thou tell

envy. Mary I can show you nothing of the batell
but of ma^y other tydyngys
ye are out of concext I tell you forever
Because (...) not you endeuou^
^t th^s great (...)
I^ so m^e (...) ye ore (...) to sees

And (...) out of wa^s

Pride That is not true as I suppose

envy. Sir and ^t be not t^ke my nose
And my head also
your office was given or I came thens

Pride Mary that was a very short sentence
and I not cassed thereto
Now envy what counsel wist thou give me

envy. By my troth Pride thou may believe me
I^ I were in thy case
I would wythdrawe me for a season
though yt be another felony nor treason
Nor yet wylfull tree space
yet the same is wurst of all
For every knave will the call
a co ward to thy face

Pride I am unhappy I seyt well
for thexpense of mine apparel
towardys this vyage
what in horses and other array
^ath compessed me for to say
all my sand to morgage
and now when I have all do
To less mine office and fees also
For my true intent
I may say that all my cost
and all my time is evil lost
In service that I have spent
well what so ever by tide me
for a season I will hyde me
after thy counsel
and sith yt will no better be
Fare well I take my seue of the

envy. ^ow gentle Pride fare well
Alas that I had no good fellow here
to bear me cumpany and laugh at this gere
this game was well found

sensua yes and ye lust to play the knave
Some manner of cumpany ye might have
S^e within this ground

envy. Some I can think y^ng or old
And (...) yt were a small household
as any might be found

sensua It is not small the company shows well
But me thought thou were about to tell
Of some merry I este
Or some merry game at my cummyng

envy. ye fardely yt is a game for a hyng
when he lusts best
To laugh for his dysporte and solace
Sir I shall tell the this is the case
Right now as I stood
In this place and never a man with me
In came Pride garnyshed as yt had be
One of the ryall blood
It grieved me to se him so well be seen
But I have abated his courage clean
For a little season
By the rode I have given him a chek mate
For I bare him an hand that he came to fate
And that the feld was done
and how his office was given away
Because he failed our master that day
I made him to believe so
And when I had told him all this tale
anon he began to wax all pale
Full of care and woe
and now he hydeth him felfe for shame
I gave him mine advise to the same
and so he is gone

sensua Now on my faith this was madly do
but in faith what moves the thereto

envy. Mary cause had I none
but only that yt is my guyse
When I se another man arise
Or fare better than I
Than must I chafe and fret for ire
and ymagyn with all my desire
To dystroy him utterly
But now in ernest Sensualyte
tell me when this fray shall be
I pray ye heartily. Sensua. What against Rea.

(...). ^e the same

sensua (...) they be agreed in yarn of shame
and go^d cumpany they keep

envy. Agreed (...) in the m^re name
Mary fyr^ at were a game
to make some of us weep

sensua We^e or laugh man so yt is
and who trow ye is the ^a user of this

envy. Who

sensua Age the devil him quell

envy. Why is age now com in pl^ce

sensua ye and that may ye spy by his face
and ye mark yt well
His stomak faynteth every day
His bak croketh his head waxes gray
His nose droppeth among
His lust is gone and all his lykyng
I se yt well by every thing
He may not live long
and all makes age as I said before
He is the dear / and what trow ye more
this age has done

envy. What

sensua By my faith he has brought in Reason
In such wise that at no season
Nothing can be wrought
B^t Reason must be called thereto
I fere me he will us all undo
within few days
As soon as Glotony had espyde
all this gere he would not abide
but went even his ways
Our master prayed him to t^ry a season
Nay nay quod he / now have I done
I may no lengar tarry
For age and I may not togeder dwell
and straight way he departed fair and well
Bodyly lust stood by
and saw that Glotony would nedys be gone
^aue with the Glotony quod he anon
For I must go with the
So that. (...). be gone togeder
(...) am there none of them both heder

envy. Never a one that I se

sensua Well they be gone some other way
to get a new master as soon as they may
They can not be ou^ urueyd
and as for^ as they. ii. were gone
Our master sent for couetyse anon
and ^^rtesy him prayed
to awayt on him well for a year or two
and he has promised him so to do
as for a year or twayn
But Reason may not thereof know

envy. Reason quod a / no so I trow
He will that dysdayn
but where has couetyse ben many a day

sensua He dwelled with a pressed as I herd say
For he loves well
Men of the church / and they him also
and lawyars the / when they may tend thereto
will follow his counsel

envy. So men say these as I dwell
but Sensualyte can thou tell
Now in this case
what were best for us to do

sensua Mary I hold yt best that we go
Nere by to some place
and semble togeder all our cumpany
to here there myndys by and by
and every mannys opinion
what shall be best for to do

envy. By my troth and be yt so
I hold yt welldon
Than they go forth and Reason and Man com in.
Rea. Sir I have often times you aduysed
to live virtuously / and showed you the way
and that not wythstandyng / ye have me despised
And followed Sensualyte / meny a day
will ye so continue / ye or nay
If ever ye purpose your self to amend
It is time / for your life draws fast to thend

Man. I can not continue / though I would
For age has wayned me clean therfro
and yet Reason / when ye me told
Of this gere meny day a go
I (...) / I should (...)
(...) of your wordys / great story and d^
Would god that my life were to bygyn again

Rea. S^eke not thereof / that may not be
a thing don / can not be called again
but the thing / that most fereth me
On your behalue / I tell you plain
Is that ye would / in no wise abstayn
From sinful lustys / as I wylled you to do
Till now that age compels you thereto

Man. That is full true / wrthout faynyng
as long as mine appetyte did endure
I followed my lustys / in every thing
which now by the course and law of nature
And not of my polycy / or good endeavor
Is taken fro me / for ever more
And so can I deserve / no mede therefore
But not wythstandyng this mine abusyon
I trust that by the help of your good advise
I may be made the child of salvation

Rea. yes and ye will sir on warantyse
So that ye utterly forsake and despise
All your old seruauntys in will and deed
and do by my counsel

Man. yes have ye no dread

Rea. Than my soul for yours / I lay to wed
ye shall do well / have ye no mystrust
And first to begin with / I you forbed
All manner of dyspeyre / and secundly ye must
Put to your mind / and good will
To be recured / of your great excess
For without your help / yt can not be doubtless
Is in this example / if so be the pacyent
Of him self / be wyllyng to have any remedy
It is a great furtheraunce to that intent
So that to the preceptys of physyk he apply
And who so does the contrary / no maruarll truly
Though he myskary / what should I bring
Any mo examples for so plain a thing

Man. It shall be no need as in this case
I know right well / what ye mean thereby
And that will I follow by godds grace

Rea. Than as I told you / yt shall be no maystry
your self confort / and ^o ^aue good remedy
(...) ^st the great (...) that thou have don
(...) why the thou have deserved endless dam^ o^
^ut do (...) I (...) the / and ^aue no d^de
And for to (...) the medyeyns / most ^yng
(...) thy force / do by mr read
Look what disease / ^s (...) and b^
take ever such a medyeyn as is (...) in w^yng
So that the contrary in all manner of wrse
Must hele his contrary as physyh does deuyse
Right so who so lusts fro syn to arise
where he has in pride / done any offense
He can be helpen thereof none other wise
but only by mekenes / that is the recompense
again Wreth and Envy / take charity and pacyence
take alms deed / again the syn of coue^rse
And to repress glotyny / acquaynt ye with abstynece
Again foull lust of body / take chastrte (...) co^tyne^ce
Myche syn grows by Sloth and by Idelnes
and that must be eschewed by mean of good besynes
^o this be preparatyfys most souerayn
Against thy sores which be mortal
Onles that this medyeyns to them be layn
When thou have received these preparatyfys all
I will com again if thou me call
And order the further after my mind

Man. (...) ye but where shall I these preparatyfys find

Rea. Thou shall them find wythm thyn own breast
Of the yt must com / yt must be thy deed
For voluntary sacrafyce pleases god best
Thou can not thereof have help or mede
But if this gere of thyn own heart proceed

Man. Well I shall endeavor me to the uttermost
And trll I have found them I shall never rest
But how shall I know them that wot I nere
I pray you show me that before yout departing

Rea. It needs not thereof to enquere
Thou shall know them at the first me^yng
Of. (...). contrarys there is but one seruyng
That is to say when thou knowyst well that o^
The other contrary is known anon
Then he goes out (...) ^kenes comes in. Who so woteth hystoryes / of

But our lord have you in his kypyng
And send rou well to speed

if yt like you / to put me in so great trust
And I true ye shall find me / true and just

Man. I wot well I shall. Surely you be bound
To the world / that has given you so great co^mendacy^

ye worcester. ye sir some men had lever than a thousand pound
They might be commended / of the same fassyon
But sir let pass / all this commendacyon
and answer to me / I pray you frutefully
In that I shall meue you / substancyally
Sir at few wordys / I you exhort
Sith that ye be come to your own
Cast your self to bear such a port
That as ye be / ye may be known
Eke yt is necessary / for that behoue

Whereby / ye may vere out your countenance
Will yt like you therefore / that I survey
And se thex^ent'of all your land

Both for rou and yours / all manner of v^nd
with other vtensy^tys / ready at your hand
So that ye be puruerd / all times ^rely and late
Of each thing / that belongs to your estate

Man. your counsel is good / do as ye thynk best
I comm^t all such thing / to your dyscrecyon
I shall do my ^ew / bysynes at the lest
To bring all thyngys / to good conclusyon

And other thyn^rs more tha^ this
I shall bring that heart of ^ys
To be more howt than yt is
^y a de wys a^e
^crally I will commend his wit
That no man can amend yt
And that he is able thereby to sit
as a judge in comen place
And when I praise him this wise
I think his heart will begin to rise
and after that utterly despise
any opray counsel to here
He shall trust all to his own brain
and than would Reason never so feign
Though he come and such oprytway^
He shall be never the nere

sensua Surely this conseyt is well found
I shall bring the in service fortwaynty pound

Pride Gramercy brother I thynk me much bound
To the forthy curtesy
