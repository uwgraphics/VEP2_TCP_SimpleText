IN all humility and reverence, the inahbitants of the low Countries do
show, protesting that they mind to live according to the reformation of the
Gospel, that sithence fifty years past and more, some of the said Countries
have bin severed from the Religion, commonly held in the Roman Church, for
many reasons known to the whole world, as well by books published, as by
the confessions of many, which have yielded reason of their separation, even
to the death. And albeit they have curiously searched all the means possible
to root them out, yet the more they killed and persecuted, the more the number
has increased, in such sort, that even in the time of the Duke of Alua, who
as he has surpassed the bloudiest Tirantes in all manner of cruelty, so has
he surmounted himself in this behalf, having put to death betvveene
eighteen and nineteen thousand persons by the hands of the hangman, having
also driven away an infinite number of honest people lovers of their Country
and common wealth. And yet sithence notvvithstanding, that which has bin
practiced by Don Loys de Requesens, such devices have bin set forvvard, as
were forecast for the overthrow of the said Protestants, who contrariwise
have shevved themselves more openly than before, even in vvithdravving
themselves from the obedience and subjection of the Pope, to certain whole
provinces: and a far greater number, leaving their Country, and the place
where they were borne, desiring rather to suffer all extremity, going
voluntarily into banishment out of a country so much loved of them that are
strangers, and to suffer joyfully the loss of their goods, rather than yield
themselves subject to the said Romish Religion. Then of the banishme^ts of the
Duke of Alua, and other the like, there have follovved great and dangerous
vvarres throughout the lovv Countries, the traffike greatly decayed, and the
handy crafts transported, and made common to strange nations, in which
things chiefly consisted the principal wealth of the said Country.

But as the intent of the council of Spain, sithence this Country was
joined to it, has alvvaies bin wholy to make these provinces subject to the
Spanyarde, as in all places where they have set their foot, they go about
to make the subjects their slaves and tributaries, and that the most part of
them under the color of reward and recompense, have long since devoured in
their hearts the goods and possessions of the inhabitants of these Countries.
The occasion of persecuting the said Protestants, under the shadovv of
devotion, has seemed to them a fit mean to atchieue their miserable
purpose to bring all under their government, after they had overthrown one
of so great a side, reaping praise and commendation of many, both of godliness
and zeal to the religion and service of God. So your highness and my Lords
know, how the Lord Don John going no whit out of the way trodden by the
Spaniards, has gone about by policies and subtilties, to make these Countries
subject to this miserable estate of bondage, vvhereto the Duke of Alua was not
able to atteyne for all his cruelty: and how by the will of God, that
which many, and namely the said Protestants have well foreseen, has bin
discovered, and made manifest to every one. Whereto at the beginning there
was made resistance with one accord by all good countrymen, and lovers of
their common wealth, Religion being set aparte, until that the said Don John
by placards, letters, vvritings, and people suborned being among us, namely by
the Jesuits and other like, has laid such foundation, as has seemed to him
fit to breed and mainteyne a deadly division, sovving mutual suspicions,
and defiances, by reason of the diversity of Religion, a foundation then very
fit, vvhereon to build covertly a whole disagreement and division of the
Countries, for of the one part he did blow continually into the ears of
Prelates and other Ecclesiastical persons, and generally of those that make
profession of the Romish Church, that the said Protestants had no other
intent, but when they savv time, to take away their goods, and to lay in
wait for their lives, that for their defense only he was in arms, and that
he vvoulde vvarrante them from such and the like dangers, into which they
would cast themselves headlo^g, unless they openly took his part. As to the
contrary, he savv well enough that the said Protestants thought as much, since
that there was no speech touching the quiet exercise of their religion, and
that they purposed nothing else, but as soon as might be, to make them
eftsoons subject to the fire, in such wise, that of the victory of the
common enemy, they could not hope for any other fruit, after they had
faithfully spent their lives and goods, and all that which God had lent
them for the most just defense of the Country, and for the expelling of the
coniured enemy, but a nevve beginning of mishappes, which might cause that
the said Protestants (judging themselves not to be more assured of their
Countrymen, with whom in common they sustained the labors of the war,
than of the enemy) took party apart, in good time regarding their surety,
since that in the end they savv no other remedy to save themselves. And
although such wicked practices have not altogether fallen out according as
they have bin devised, which ought to be attributed to Gods providence, who
has bin vvatchfull over this Country, and over the vigilancie and
carfulness of our good superioures, and other of our good Countrymen, so
near they had most dangerous effects. For whereas we should all have bin
united to mainteyne our liberty, and to preserve our privileges against the
tyranny of strangers, contrariwise of this cursed seed have issued in many
the fruits of cold hearts, estraungings, and vvithdravving of minds, diverse
practices, secret assemblies, and intelligences with the enemy, and
generally some falsing their faith, have openly stuck to him, and at the
beginning making some shevve to defend themselves, have suffered themselves to
be carried away by the said persuasions, which is the principal fruit that
Don John has ever hoped to gather by his crafty skill and dissimulation. And
in deed, it is impossible, that the hearts and minds could well unite and
dravve themselves together, as in one body, where the one and the other being
full of suspicion, think that every one has him for his companion, who
either is his declared enemy, or which hides a secret hatred which in time
and place must be discovered to the spoil of the goods, and life of his
fellow, there is no trust, but rather a continual hidden defiance, that
engenders a hatred, and imprinteth in the heart all other sorts of vehement
passions. And albeit that some ill experienced in dealing in the State and
ordering of matters, as naughty Chirurgions, which sound not the bothome of
the vvou^d, but content themselves to cure the uppermost part of the diseased
member: So these men only assay outwardly to heal the hurt, without
discovering the root, to pull away altogether that hurt which vvasteth us
by little and little, even to our utter ruin and desolation. Notvvithstanding
these means can not close up the wound of our harms, but rather it comes
to pass that of the one side and the other, the least fault that is
committed, is, that the service of the common wealth is slovvly and litherly
done, and daily this heat of resisting the enemy grows cold, and it is to
be feared, that the enemy, who all this while is not asleep, but rather
continually spreading among us flames of suspicion, will in the end lighten
such a fire of division, that of the one side and the other, we shall be
consumed and destroyed by the same fire, which our own suspicions and
passions have nourished and mainteyned.

These things have caused that the Protestants, having an unspeakable grief
that the Religion whereof they make profession, in the which without
offending any person, they seek nothing but to serve God with cleanness of
heart, is so vntovvardly expounded, and that to their greatest displeasure,
they see, that it serves Don John for a foundation vvhereon to build his
practices, (which are to oppress the one by the other) as good Countrymen
and Citizens they have diligently sought out the vvelspring and original of
these mischiefs, and if they were redressed, it should be easy to come to a
good unity, all suspicions being laid apart, and defiances extinguished, a
thing so greatly desired of good men, and so necessary to the whole common
weal. This it is, that of the one part they see in many places the Prelates,
and other Ecclesiastical persons, to be in continual fear, that one day
the said Protestants will set upon them, to the whole overthrow of
their Religion, and spoil of goods. Of the other part, the said
Protestants think, that they are only reserved to be led by them to the
butcherie, seeing that after so many loyal services, they can not have the
liberty of their Religion granted them: whereupon there arises some proud
speech of both sides, and ouermuche liberty of the Souldyoures or people,
which notvvithstanding, under most humble correction of your highness and
my Lords, might seem to be remedied, if in dealing with both parts
freely, and without dissimulation, in disclosing among themselves the causes
of the mischief, which is but too much increased, they vvoulde grant of
the one part the said Protestants, the free exercise of their Religion,
seeing that this is the only cause which brings them in suspicion, and
causes that some do enterprise matters not pleasing every man. Of the other
part, that the said Protestants by meet means, should assure the said of
the Romish Religion, that they sought nothing less, than to root out by
force the said Religion, to take away, and possess their goods, and to do
any act contrary to the duty of their fellovv countreyman. Contrariwise,
that they are ready to employe themselves for the whole preservation of the
Country, and of all the inhabitants thereof, as well generally, as
perticularly: And if these things be executed, there is no doubt, but that all
matter of division will cease, and a good peace shall be well established,
the occasions of mutual defiance being by this mean taken away, and the old
grudges and hatreds altogether buried.

Most humbly beseech your highness, and my Lords, to consider the long time
that they have looked, that the general Estates should provide for matters of
Religion. But if for the discommoditie of the time, the occasion be not yet
offered to assemble, or else by the drift of some, who favoring privily the
party of Don John, do let it, mainteyning by this mean the said defiances, or
others, which hope yet after the victory, to burn the said Protestants
(means no less dangerous the one than the other, and no less unworthy of
good Countrymen.) If then, for such reasons or the like, they could not yet
well provide for this, it rests only, (if by your most wise counsel there
be no other remedy) the one of these two means, to vveete, either that the
said Protestants, who for some danger could not be brought to the exercise
of the Romish Religion, do abide alvvayes without Religion, or else that in
deed they take in hand the public exercise of their Religion. The first is
so hurtful to the common wealth, that nothing can be thought more, for it
brings with it the contempt of God, despising of Religion, Atheism,
whereof follovveth the breaking of the laws of God and Man. The second may
be a cause of a division in the contrary, which might turn vpside down
the present state, the one taking one party, the other another, which might
open a gappe, to overthrow the one by the other, follovving the entreprise of
the dead Escouedo, the very firebrand of this Country. But if the rules, and
lessons of the auntients, and of those which have bin reputed for their
wisdom, ought to take place, it is certain, that in affairs of such
weight, we can not take better council, than of our enemy: for if this
argument of the diversity of Religion be the best vveapon which he takes
in hand to beat us, it is good for us to set our side in order, that this
falling out, serve not him for a breach, to make his tirannie enter in among
us. And for as much as experience of time past shows us that our sins
have bin so great, that we could not all be brought to one Religion alone,
it rested (under most humble correction) to advice how without altering the
unity of the Country, the one and the other Religion might be mainteyned
without the prejudice of one and other.

Whereupon the said Protestants most humbly beseech your highness, and my
Lords, not to give ear to those, which to hinder so good a matter, allege
first of all the pacification of Gant, secondly, that two Religions can not
abide together in one Country, and thirdly, that there is no assurance, this
point being agreed upon, that the Ecclesiastical persons may be mainteyned.
For touching the first, it is well known, that the enemy has plainly
renounced it, by open declaration sent by Sieur de Selles, that he would not
in any wise hold it, wherein he shows manifestly vvhereat he shoots,
and teaches the said Protestants whereof they should take heed. Wherefore
we are not bound to keep our oath with him, seeing that disloyally he first
brake it. And concerning that which touches us among our selves, for so
much as the said pacification was concluded by the advice, and consent of
other provinces, with my Lord the Prince of Orange, and the Estates of
Holland and Zelande, it is certain, and nature teaches it, without
vvronging of any, that there is nothing so natural, but as by the consent of
the two parts, the contracte has bin made, passed, and promised: so by the
consent of the one part and the other, it could not be in part broken,
qualifyed, and interpreted for the common weal of the Country, and for
cutting off the secret vvorking of the enemy. But the said Protestants
think not in any wise to vvithstande it, nor do mind to be the cause of
the breach thereof, seeing that they, abiding in the terms of the said
pacification, most humbly demand and require, that by the mean of the
general estates, there should provision be made for the free and public
exercise of Religion. Concerning the second point, experience has at all
times shevved the contrary, whether we consider the ancient or new
Emperoures, or behold the nations near adjoining. For it is well known to
them which are but meanly seen in Histories, that the Emperoures being at
the beginning Paynims, have nevertheless maynteyned under their Empire
Christians and Paynims, having whole legio^s of Christians, and the rest of
their army Paynims, all marching under one general of the army. And
notvvithstanding there were found in that time, as at this present,
uncircumspect councellers, which did put such opinions into their Princes
heads, that the two Religions could not endure together, upon occasion
whereof, the Emperoures fell to persecute the most part, but incontinently
they first suffered the punishmente for such foolish councels. Afterward in
the times of Christian Emperors, the like has bin a very long time, and not
only that, but also among them that did bear in common the name of Christians,
the Church has bin allowed to stand open to them, which held doctrine
altogether contrary, which may be seen in the histories of Constantine his
children Theodosius and others. As for our time, there are so many examples,
that if we are to judge them by the number, one may sooner say, and more
certainly, that whosoever has gone about to abolishe one of the two
Religions, has put his state in great danger. Howsoever it be, if we look
about us, the two mightiest nations, and with which we are environed, to
vveete, Germany, and France, after so much spilling of blood, have found no
mean to staunch it, but by condescending to the exercise of the one, and the
other Religion. We bear yet in mind the great invasions that the Emperor
Charles of most famous memory made into Germany, of the great likelyhoodes of
good success that he had in the beginning, having subdued the better part
thereof, and having in his power the chiefest, brauest, and mightiest Princes,
the issue notvvithstanding was such, that after he was brought to greater
extremity, tha^ ever such a mighty Prince was, he had no way to assure
himself, but in condescending to the one and other Religion: your highness
grandfather, a Prince of great and rare judgment and council, the Emperor
Ferdinand perceiving that he had no other mean to assure the one and the
other, and to take away the suspicions that were in Germany, condescended to
the Religions-friedt, and since that time, there has not bin one mutiny in
Germany, the Ecclesiastical persons might enjoy their goods, dignities, and
preheminences with greater assurance, than in any other place of Christendom,
and in many towns, as at Francfort, Worms, Vlme, Ausbourg, and others, is
exercised the one and the other Religion, without division or uproar in the
Churches of any of these towns. The Emperor of most noble memory your
highness father, has not only maintained that which has bin so well
framed by his predecessors; but besides has alovved it in his own countries,
well perceiving that this was the only mean to keep his subjects in peace.
In like manner, Rodolph your highness brother, at this present enjoying the
sacred seat of his predecessors, has not many days past granted the same to
the nobles of his kingdom of Hungary. I will not say what the state of
Hungary has bin since Sigismund. As touching France, we are too near
neybors to be ignorant, that the stremes of blood which ran in such abundance,
could never be stayed, until that she had her liberty granted, which has
always brought with it quietness, as when she was hindered, forthwith the
Realm has bin wholy on fire, ready to consume himself, and to bring
himself to ashes. But if likewise we can take example by the common enemy
of Christendom, to vveete, the Turk, who knovveth too well what it is to
bear rule, we see that he suffers alike under his Empire, the Christians and
the Jews, being for all this in no doubt of any reuolting, yet he has under
his Empire without comparison, more Christians, which do not acknovvlege, nor
vvil acknovvlege the Pope, tha^ there be in this Europe, which do acknovvledge
him. The K. of Marroques and Fleez does the like. And as for the K. of Poland,
besides the diversity of Christian Religion that he has in his country, he
has also a great number of Mahometanes, which obey him, not having for this
respect any co^motio^ in his country. The Pope himself, whom they of the
Romish Church hold for their head, and his examples for infallible rules,
suffers at Rome, and in all places where he has any property, that the
Jews have their public Sinagoges, yea for a little money, he will suffer
that every one may have it to himself. The like is seen in many Cities of the
Empire. Likewise my Lords, the Estates here with us, have not let the said
Jews to dress their Sinagogs in some places of these Countries, and that in
consideration of a small profit, which in no wise is to be compared to that,
whereof there is question at this present. And notvvithstanding, the said
Jews do deny Jesus Christ, and are enemies of the Church of God, the
which shall not be found in thousands of Protestants, which hope in Christ,
as the only worker of their salvation, and are not enemies of the Church, but
rather desire only the reformation.

As touching the third point, the said Protestants can not so soon make
known to all the world, the good desire they have to live peaceably with
their tovvnesmates and Countrymen, but hope in time to make most certain
proof thereof, the said defiances being set aside, and suspitio^s taken away,
the which they shall promise before God to perform. In the mean season, they
most humbly beseech your highness, and my Lords, to offer all such means
of assurance, as you shall think meet, and they shall be very forvvard as
much as lies in them thoroughly to obey, and to frame themselves thereto, and
persuade themselves with this, that they shall promise, that they will find
some Princes, good friends to this Country, and great Lords, which will do
them this honor, to aunsvvere for their faithfulness and stedfastnes in their
promises.

These things considered,
the said Protestants beseech with all their most humble and obedient heart
and affection, that it would please your highness, and you my Lords, as those
to whom this common wealth his committed, and for which you are bound to
give account before God and Man, that it would please you, in taking away all
occasions of defiances, and suspicions among the poor subjects of the lovv
Country, all which bend their eyes upon you, to find the means with the
liking, and contentme^t of all, to agree to the equal exercise of both
Religions, until that it has pleased God, surmounting by his mercy the
multitude of our sins (which are the only causes of so many mischiefs) by
the mean of a good, holy, and free council general, or at the least
national, to end the controversies that we see in this Country, touching
matters of Religion, to preuente by your wise councels and deliberations, so
many mischiefs as you have seen to light upon neybours, who with much ado
ca^ yet fetch breath, to cut off by your wisdom the enterprises of the
enemy, who under the shadovv of this variance, would cast us headlong into a
bottomless pit of confusion, and by your ripe deliberations, to give
co^tentme^t to all the poor subjects which feel the smart, but look for the
remedy at their hands, whom they have chosen for their Phisitia^s, and to
be guided to the haven by the^ whom they have chosen for their gouernoures.
That it vvoulde please you to behold rather the examples of our neybours and
others, of which the one by their wise foresighte have remedied the mischief
to come, the other being taught by their calamity, had rather seek remedy,
though the disease has bin long and deep rooted, than in despairing their
own safety, to cast themselves headlong into utter destruction. That it
vvoulde please you to have pity and compassion of the^, that have placed
themselves betvveene your arms, and look not for any comfort next after God,
but of you, and so doing, ordeine, that by a sacred law of forgetfulness, al
things past of the one part may be buried, without that hereafter none may
be sifted for any thing happened by reason of the diversity of Religion: and
the said Protestants shall promise to submit themselves to all reasonable
conditions, such as it shall please your highness to offer, to keep them
inuiolably, and to put in such assurance, as they are able. And albeit the said
Protestants owe themselves, their lives, and their goods to their Country,
notvvithstanding they most humbly beseech, that it would please you to
remember, how many years they have suffered, for the service of their
country, and since the unity of the provinces, what their faithfulness and
obedience is and has bin: but if any of them has committed any act, which
is not allowed of all, there is nothing vvhereto a fit remedy may not be
given, and they are not deadly faults as theirs are, which openly under
pretense of zeal dravve themselves to the enemy. Although also that the said
Protestants should receive any vvrong which they hope not, they have
determined by Gods grace, to stick to that which they know they owe of duty
to their country. Notvvithsta^ding they trusting to your wisdom and
equity, most humbly desire you to fulfill their request, as for a free
recompense of so many travels, and for to encourage the^ more and more to do
well, so shall you do well, and the said suppliants shall be bound to pray to
God for the wealth and aduanceme^t of your estate, the universal and
quietness of the Country, and as til this present, they have bin very
forvvard, and disposed to serve faithfully, and by the grace of God, without
reproach to the common wealth, so shall they settle themselves by means
thereof, to do better in time to come.

TO THE READER.
OF late aduertisements are come over, that the.xiiij. of this present month
of July, the Estates assemble themselves to deliberate upon this request, the
sequel whereof is uncertain, for as Euripides in Iphigenia says, (...): that
is, Gods doings fall out otherwise than men look for, and he saves whom he
loves.
