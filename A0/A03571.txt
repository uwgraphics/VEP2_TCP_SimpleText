Robin Hood (?) with a longbow and arrow, wearing a cap with a feather, facing
Little John, who bears a sword and axe Little John.


LONDON. Printed for Edward White.

Here begins a little jest of Robin Hood and his merry men and of the proud
Sheriff of Notingham.
Lythe and listen Gentlemen,
that be of fre borne blood:
I shall you tell of a good yeoman
his name was Robin Hood.
Robin was a proud outlaw
whilst he walked on the ground,
So courteise an outlaw as he was one,
was never none yfound,
Robin stood in Bernsdale
and leaned upon a tree,
And by him little John
a good yeoman was he.
And also did good Scathlock,
and Much the milners son,
there was no inch of his body
but it was worth a grome.
Then bespake him little John
all unto Robin hood:
Master if you would dine betime
it would do you much good.
Then bespake good Robin hood,
to dine I have no lust
till I have some bold Baron
or some vnketh gest
that may pay for the best
Or some Knight, or some Squire
that dwells here by west.
A good manner then had Robin
in land where that he were,
Every day ere he would dine
three masses would he here.
The one in the worship of the Father,
the other of the holy Ghost:
the third was of our dear Lady
that he loved of all other most.
Robin he loved our dear Lady,
for doubt of deadly sin,
would he never do company harm
that any woman was in.
Master then said little John
and we our board shall spread
tell us what way we shall gone,
and what life we shall lead,
where we shall take where we shall leave
where we shall abide behind:
where we shall rob where we shall reaue
where we shall beat and bind.
Thereof no force said Robn,
we shall do well enough,
but look you do no husbandman harm
that tilleth with the plough,
No more you shall no good yeoman
that walks by green wod shaw:
Ne no Knight, ne no Squire
that would be a good fellow.
Bishops and these Archbishops
ye shall them beat and bind,
the high Sheriff of Nottingeam
him hold in your mind.
this word shall hold said little John,
and this lesson shall we lere.
It is far days God send us a guest
that we were at our dinnere.
Take thy good bow in thy hand said Robin
let Much go with thee,
and so shall William Scathlock,
and no man abide with me.
Now walk ye up unto the shore,
and so to Watling-street
and wait after some uncouth guest,
by chance some may ye meet.
Be he Earl or any Baron
Abbot or any Knighti
bring him then to lodge to me
his dinner shall be dight.
They went anon unto the Sails
these yeomen all three,
they looked East they looked West,
they might no man see
But as they looked in Bernesdale
by a deem street:
Then came there a Knight riding,
full soon they began him meet.
All drouflye was his semblant,
and little was his pride,
His one foot on the stirtop stood,
the other waued beside:
His hood hanged over his eyes two,
he rode in simple array,
A sorrier man then he was one
rode never on Summers day.
Little John was courteous,
and set him on his knee:
Welcome be ye gentle Knight,
welcome are you to me,
Welcome be thou to greene-wood
hend Knight and free.
My Master has abiden fasting
sir all these hours three.
Who is your Master said the Knight.
John said Robin hood:
He is a good yeoman said the Knight,
of him have I heard much good.
I grant he said with you to wend
my brethren all three:
My purpose was to have dined to day
at Blithe or Dancastre.
Forth then went that gentle Knight
with a careful cheer,
The tears out of his eyes rann
and fell down by his leere.
They brought him unto the lodge door
When Robin began him see
Full courteously he did off his hood
and set him down on his knee.
welcome sir Knight then said Robin,
welcome thou art to me,
I have abyden fasting sir
all these hours three.
Then answered the gentle Knight
with words fair and free,
God thee save good Robin,
and all thy fair menye.
They washed together and wiped both
and set to their dinnere,
Bread and wine they had enough
and numbles of the Dear.
Swans and Fesants they had full good
and Fowls of the river
there fails never so little a bird
that ever was spread on bryer.
Do gladly sir Knight said Robin,
Gramercy sir said he
Such a dinner had I not
Of all these weeks three.
If I come again Robin
Here by this Country,
As good a dinner I shall thee make,
as thou have made to me.
I thank thee Knight then said Robin
my dinner when I have,
By God I was never so greedy
my dinner for to crave.
But pay ere you wend said Robin
me think is good right,
It was never ye manner by worthy God
a yeoman to pay for a Knight.
I have naught in my Coffers said the Knight
that I may proffer for shame:
Little John go look said Robin hood,
Ne let not for no blame.
Tell me truth said Robin
so God have part of thee:
I have no more but x s. said the Knight
so God have part of me.
If thou have no more said Robin
I will not one penny,
And if thou have need of any more
more I shall lend thee.
Go now forth little John
the truth tell thou me,
If there be no more but ten sbillings
not any penny that I see
Little John spread down his mantle
full fair upon the ground
And there he found in the Knights cofer
but even half a pound
Little John let it lie full still
and went to his master full low
What tidings John said Robin
Sir the Knight is true
Fill of the best wine said Robin
the Knight shall begin
Much wonder thinks me
thy clothing is so thin.
Tell me one word said Robin
and counsel shall it be,
I trow thou were made Knight of force
or else of yeomanry,
or else thou have be a sorry husband,
and lived in stroke and strife,
an Okerer or else a Letcher said Robin
with whores have thou led thy life.
I am none of these said the Knight
by God that mage me,
An hundredth winters hear before
mine Ancestors Knights have be.
But of it has befall Robin
a man has be disgrast
But God that sits in heaven above
may amend his estate.
Within 2. or 3. years Robin said he
Four hundredth pound of good money
full well then might I spend.
Now have I no good said the Knight
but my children an my wife,
God has shapen such an end
till God it amend.
In what manner said Robin
have thou lost thy riches?
For my great folly he said
and for my kindness.
I had a son forsooth Robin
that should have been mine heir,
When he was twenty winters old
In field would just full fair.
He slew a Knight of Lancashire
and a Squire bold,
For to save him in his right
my goods both set and sold.
My Lands be set to wed Robin
until a certain day,
To a rich Abbot here beside
of Saint Mary Abbay.
What is the sum said Robin,
truth then tell thou me
Sir he said four hundredth pound
the Abbot told it to me.
Now and thou loose thy land said Robin
what shall fall of thee?
Hastily I will me buske said the Knight
over the salt Sea:
And see where Christ was quick and dead
on the mount of Caluere.
Farewell friend and have good day
it may no better be.
Tears fell out of his eyes two,
he would have gone his way,
Farewell friends and have good day,
I have no more to pay.
Where be thy friends said Robin,
sir never a one will know me:
Whiles I was rich enough at home
great boast then would they blow:
And now they run away from me
As beasts on a row
They take no more heed of me
than they me never saw
For ruthe they went little John
Scathlocke and Much also
Fill of the best wine said Robin
for here is a simple cheer
Have thou any friends said Robin
thy borrowes that will be
I have none said the Knight
but God that dyed on a tree
Do away thy jest said Robin
thereof I will right none
weenest thou I will God to borrow
Peter, Paul or John
Nay by him that made me
and shope both Sun and Moon
Find a better borrow said Robin
Or money gettest thou none
I have none other said the Knight
the sooth for to say,
But it be our dear Lady
she fails me never or this day.
By dear worthy God said Robin
to seech all England through
Yet found I never to my pay
a much better borowe
Come now forth little John
and go to my treasure
And bring me four hundredth pound
and look it well told be
Forth then went little John
and Scathelocke went before
He told forth four hundredth pound
by eighteen score
Is this well told said little Much
John said what grieved thee
It is alms to help a gentle knight
that is fallen in poverty
Master then said little John
his clothing is full thin
Ye must give the knight a livery,
to wrap his body therein
For ye have Scarlet and green master
and much rich array
there is no merchant in merry England
so rich I dare well say
Take him three yeards of every color
and look that well ymet it be
Little John took none other measure
but his bow tree
And of every handful that he met
he leped over foots three
What devils draper said little Much
think thou to be
Scathelocke stood still and laughed
and said by God almight
John may give him the better measure
by God it cost him but light
Master said little John
All unto Robin hood
Ye must give the knight an horse
to lead home all his good
Take him a gray courser said Robin
and a saddle new
He is our Ladies messenger
God lend that it be true
And a good Palfray said little much
to maintain him in his right
And a pair of boots said Scathelocke
for he is a gentle knight
what shall thou give him little John said Robin
sir a pair of gilte spurs clean
to pray for all this company
God bring them out of tene
When shall my day be said the Knight
sir and your will be
This day twelve months said Robin
under the green wood tree
It were great shame said Robin
a Knight alone to ride
without squire, yeomen or page
to walk by his side
I shall thee lend little John my man
for he shall be thy knave
In a yeomans sted he may stand
if thou great need have.
The second fit.
NOw is the Knight gone on his way
this game he thought full good
When he looked on Bernisdale
he blessed Robin hood
And when he thought on Bernisdale
on Scathelocke much and John
He blessed them for the best company
that ever he in came
Then spoke the gentle Knight
to little John began he say
tomorrow I must to York town
to saint Mary Abbay
And to the Abbot of that place
four hundredth pound I must pay
And but I be there this night
my land is lost for aye
The Abbot said to his covent
there he stood on ground
this day xii. months came a Knight
and borrowed four^ hundredth pound
Upon his land and fee
But he come this ilke day
disberited shall he be
It is full early said the priour
the day is not yet far gone
I had lever to pay a hundredth pound
and lay it down anon
The Knight is far beyond the sea
in England is his right
And suffers hunger and cold
and many a sore night
It were great pity said the priour
So to have his land
And ye be so light of your conscience
you do him much wrong
Thou art ever in my berde said ye Abbot
by God and saint Richad
With that came in a fat headed muncke
the high sellerere
He is dead or hanged said the Muncke
by God that bought me dear
Ind we shall have to spend in this place
four hundredth pounds by year
The Abbot and high sellerere
stert forth full bold
The high Justice of England
the Abbot there did hold
The high Justice and many mo
had taken into their hand
Wholly all the knights det
to put that knight to wrong
They demed the knight wonder sore
the Abbot and his meiny
But he comes this ylke day
disherited shall he be
He will come yet said the Justice
I dare well undertake
But in sorrow time to them all
The knight came to the gate
Then bespake that gentle knight
until his menye
Now put on your simple weeds
that ye brought fro the sea
They came to the gates anon
the porter was ready himself
and welcomed them every chone
Welcome sir knight said the porter
my Lord to meat is he
And so is many a gentleman
for the love of thee
The Porter swore a full great oath.
by God that made me
Here be the best corse horse
that ever yet saw me
Led them to the stable he said
that eased might they be
they shall not come there said the knight
by God that dyed on a tree
Lords were to meat yset
in that Abbots hall
the knight went forth and kneeled down
and saluted them great and small:
Do gladly sir Abbot (said the Knight)
I am come to hold my day.
The first word the Abbot spoke
have thou brought me my pay?
Not one penny said the Knight
by God that has made me:
Thou art a shrewde debtor said yt Abbot
sir Justice drink to me.
What do thou here (said the Abbot)
but thou had brought thy pay?
For God then said the Knight
to desire of a longer day.
Thy day is broake said the Justice,
land gettest thou none:
Now good sir Justice be my friend,
and defend me against my fone.
I am hold with the Abbot said ye Justice
both with cloth and fee:
Now good sir Sheriff be my friend,
nay for God said he.
Now good sir Abbot be my friend
for thy courtesy:
and hold my lands in thy hand
till I have made thee gree:
and I will be thy true servant,
till ye have four hundredth pound
of money good and free.
The Abbot swear a full great oath,
by God that died on a tree,
Get thy land where thou may
for thou gettest none of me.
By dear worthy God said the Knight
that all this world wrought
but I have my land again
full dear it shall be bought.
God that was of a maiden borne
send us well to speed,
for it is good to assay a friend
or that a man have need.
The Abbot loathly on them began look,
Out he said thou false Knight,
step thee out of the hall.
Thou lie then said the gentle Knight
Abbot in thy hall:
false Knight was I never;
by God that made us all.
Up then stood that gentle Knight
to the Abbot said he:
To suffer a Knight to kneel so long
thou can no courtesy.
In Iusts and in Tournaments
full far that have I be,
and put my self as far in press
as any that ever I see.
What will ye give more said the Justice
and the Knight shall make release:
or else dare I safely say
ye hold never your land in peace.
An hundredth pound said the Abbot,
the Justice said give him two:
Nay by God said the Knight,
ye get not my land so.
Though ye would give a thousand pound more
yet were thou never the near:
Shall there never be mine heir
Abbot, Justice ne Friar.
He stert him to a bourd anon
till a table round
And there he shook out of a bag
even four hundredth pound
Have here thy gold sir abbot said the Knight
which thou lentest me
Had thou been curtise at my coming
I would have rewarded thee
The Abbot sat still and eat no more
for all his royal cheer
He cast his head on his shoulder
and fast began to stare
Take my gold again said the Abbot
sir Justice that I took to thee
Not a penny said the Justice
by God that dyed on a tree
Sir Abbot and you men of law
Now have I held my day
Now shall I have my land again
for ought that you can say
The knight start out of the door
away was all his care
And on he put his good clothing
and the other he left there
He went him forthfull merry singing
as men have told in tale
His Lady met him at the gate
at home in Verisdale
Welcome my Lord said his Lady
sir lost is all your good
Be merry dame said the knight
and pray for Robin hood
That ever his soul be in bliss
he help me out of tene
Ne had not be his kindness
beggars had we been.
The Abbot and I accorded been,
he served of his pay:
the good yeoman lent it me
as I came on the way.
This Knight then dwelled fair at home
the sooth for to say:
till he had got four hundredth pound
all ready for to pay.
He puruaide him an hundredth bows
the strings were well dight:
An hundredth sheafe of arrows good,
the heads burnisht full bright:
And every arrow an ell long,
with Peacocke well ydight:
And nocked they were with white silver
it was a seemly sight.
He puruaide him an hundredth men
well harnased in that stead:
And himself in that same suite,
and clothed in white and red.
He bare a lance gay in his hand,
and a man led his male:
and rode with a light song
unto Bernisdale.
As he went up a bridge was a wrestling
and there tarried was he:
And there was all the best yeomen
of all the west Cuntrie.
A great courser with a saddle and bridle
with gould burnisht full bright:
A pair of gloves a red gold ring,
a pipe of wine in good fay:
What man bears him best ywis
the prize shall bear away.
There was a yeoman in that place
and best worthy was he,
And for he was far and friend bested
yslaine he should have be.
The Knight had ruth of this yeoman
in place where that he stood,
He said the yeoman should have no harm
for the love of Robin hood.
The Knight preased into the place,
an hundredth followed him in fear,
With bows bent and arrows sharp
for to shend that company.
They shouldred and made him room
to wit what he would say:
He took the yeoman by the hand,
and gave him all the play,
He gave him five marks for his wine
there it lay then on the mould,
and bad it should be set abroach
and drink who so would.
Thus long tarried this gentle Knight
till that the play was done.
So long abode Robin fasting
three hours after noone.
The third fit.
LYthe and listen Gentlemen
all that now be here,
Of little John that was the Knights man
good mirth ye shall hear.
It was upon a merry day
that young men would go shoot
Little John fet his bow anon
and said he would them mnete.
Three times little John shot about
and always claue the wand.
The proud Sheriff of Nottingham
by the marks began stand.
The Sheriff swore a full great oath
by him that died on a tree,
this man is the best archer
that ever I did see.
Say me thou wight young man
what is now thy name:
in what country wast thou borne,
and where is thy wonning wane.
In Holdernes I was borne
ywis of my dame,
Men call me Reinald Greene-leafe.
when I am at home.
Say me Reinald Greene-leafe
Will thou dwell with me,
and every year I will thee give
twenty mark to thy fee.
I have a Master said little John,
A courteous Knight is he,
may ye get leave of him the better may it be
The Sheriff gat little John
twelve months of the Knight:
therefore he gave to him anon
a good horse and a wight.
Now is little John the Sheriffs man
he give us well to speed.
But always thought little John
to quite him well his meed.
Now so God help said little John
and by my true lewte
I shall be the worst servant to him
that ever he had yet.
It befell upon a wednesday
the Sheriff on hunting was gone:
and little John lay in his bed
and was forgot at home:
Therefore he was fasting
till it was past noone.
Good sir Steward I pray thee
give me meat said little John:
It is long for greene-leafe
fasting so long to be:
Therefore I pray thee Steward
my dinner give thou me.
Shall neither eat nor drink said the Steward
till my Lord be come to town
I make mine auow to God said little John
I had lever to crack thy crown.
The Butler was discourteous
there he stood on the floor:
He start to the buttery and shut fast the door
little John gave the Butler such a rappe
his back yede nigh in two:
Though he lives an hundredth winters
the worse he still shall go.
He spurned the door with his foot
it went open well and fine:
And there he made a large livery
both of ale and wine.
Since you will not dine said little John
I shall give you to drink:
and though you live this hundredth winter
on little John shall ye think:
Little John eat and also drunk
the while that he would:
the Sheriff had in the kitchen a Cook
a stout man and a bold.
I make my auow to God said the Cook
thou art a shrewd hine
in an hous-hold for to dwell
for to ask thus to dine.
And there he lent little John
good strokes three:
I make mine auow said little John
these strokes do like well me.
Thou art a bold man and a hardy,
and so thinks me:
And ere I pass from this place
assaied better shall thou be.
Little John drew a good sword:
The Cook an other in hand,
they thought nothing to flee
but stiffly for to stand.
There they fought sore togethrr
two mile way and more:
might neither other harm done
the mountenance of an hour.
I make mine auow to God said little John
and by my true lewte
thou art one of the best swordmen
that ever I saw yet.
Could thou shoot as well in a bow
to greene-wood thou should with me:
And two times in the year thy clothing
changed it should be:
And every year of Robin hood
twenty mark to thy fee.
Put up thy sword said the Cook
and fellows we will be
Then he fet to little John
the numbles af a Do:
Good bread and full good wine,
they eat and drank thereto.
And when they had drunken well
their truths together they plight,
that they would be with Robin
that ylke day at night:
They hied them to the treasure-house
as fast as they could gone:
The locks that were of good steel
they brake them every one:
They took away silver Vessel,
and all that they might get:
Pieces Masers and spoones
would they none forget:
Also they took the good pence
three hundredth pound and three,
and hied them to Robin hood
under the greene-wood tree.
God thee save my dear Master,
and Christ thee save and see.
And thou said Robin to little John
welcome thou art to me,
and so is that good yeoman
that thou have brought with thee.
What tidings from Noti^ngham
little John tell thou me.
Well thee greeteth the proud Sheriff
he has sent thee here by me
his Cup and his silver Vessel,
and three hundredth pound and three
I make mine auow to God said Robin
and by the Trinity
it was never by his good will
this good is come to me.
Little John him bethought
on a shrewde wile 5. mile in the Forest
him happened at his will.
Then he met the proud Sheriff
hunting with hound and horn.
Little John could his courtesy
and kneeled him besorne.
God save thee my dear Master:
and Christ you save and see.
Reinald Greene-leafe said the Sheriff
where have you now be.
I have now be in the Forest
a fair sight can I see,
it was one of the fairest sights
that ever yet saw I me.
Yonder I see a right fair Heart
his color is of green,
seven score Dear upon a heard
be with him all by deene,
His tindes be so sharp Master
of sixty and well mo,
that I durst not shoot for dread
least they would me slo.
I make my auow to God said ye sheriff
that sight would I feign see.
Buske thee thither ward my dear Master
anon and wend with me
The Sheriff rode and little John
a foot he was full smart,
And when they came a fore Robin
Lo here is the master Ha^t,
Still stood the proud Sheriff,
a sorry man was he:
Woe worth thee Reinald Greenleafe
thou have betrayed me.
I make mine auow to God said John
Master ye be to blame:
I was misserued of my dinner
when I was with you at home.
Soon he was to supper set,
and served with silver white:
And when the Sheriff saw his Vessel
for sorrow he might not eat.
Make good cheer said Robin hood
Sheriff of charity:
And for the love of little John
thy life is granted to thee.
When they had all supped well
the day was all gone:
Robin commanded little John
to draw off his hose and shoone:
His kertle and his coat a pie
that was furred well and fine:
And took him a green mantle
to lap his body therein.
Robin commanded his wight yeomen
under the green wood tree
that they shall lie in that sort
that the Sheriff might them see.
All night lay that proud Sheriff
in his breech and in his shirt:
Now wonder it was in greene-wood
though his sides do smart.
Make glad said Robin hood
Sheriff for charity:
For this is our order ywis
under the greene-wood tree.
This is harder order said the Sheriff
then any ancre or friar:
For all the gold in merry England
I would not dwell long here.
All these twelve months said Robin
thou shall dwell with me,
I shall thee teach proud Sheriff
an outlaw for to be.
Or I here an other night lie
Robin now I pray thee
Smite off my head rather to morn,
Let me go then said the Sheriff
and I forgive it thee:
for Saint Chaiity:
and I will be the best friend
thar ever yet had ye.
Thou shall swear me an oath said Robin
on my bright brand,
Thou shall never wait me scath
by water nor by land.
And if thou find any of my men
by night or else by day
upon thine oath thou shall swear
to help them that thou may.
Now has the Sheriff sworn his oath
and home again to gone,
He was full of greene-wood
as ever was any man.
The fourth fit.
THe Sheriff dwelt in Nottingham
he was feign that he was gone:
and Robin and his merry men
went to wood anon.
Go we to dinner said little John:
but Robin said nay,
for I dread our Lady be wrath with me
for she sent me not my pay.
Have no doubt Master said little John
yet is not the Sun at rest,
for I dare swear and safely swear
the Knight is true and trust.
Take thy bow in thy hand said Robin
let Much wend with thee,
and so shall William Scathlock
and no man abide with me,
and up into the sails,
and to watling street,
and look for some strange guest,
by chance you may them meet:
Whither he be Messenger,
or man that mirths can,
or if he be a poor man
of my goods he shall have some.
Forth then start little John
half in a fray and teene,
and girt him with a full good sword
under a mantle of green.
They went then unto the Sails
these yeomen all three,
they looked East they looked West
they might no man see,
But as they looked in Bernisdale
by the high way
they were ware of two black Monks
each on a good palfray.
Then bespake little John
to Much he began say,
I dare lay my life to wed
these Monks have brought our pay.
Make glad cheer said little John,
and bend we our bows of ewe,
and look our hearts be syker and sad
your strings trusty and true,
the Monk has but fifty and two man
and seouen summers full strong,
there rides no Bishop in this land
so royal I understand.
Brethren said little John
here are no more but we three,
but we bring them to dinner
our Master dare we not see.
Bend your bows said little John,
make you youder Priest to stand,
the foremost Monk his life and his death
is cloased in my hand.
Abide churl Monk said little John,
no farther that thou gone,
if thou do by dear worthy God
thy death is in my hand.
An evil thrift on thy head said little John
right under thy hattes band,
for thou have made our Master wrath
he is fasting so long.
What hight your Master said the Monk
Little John said Robin hood:
He is a strong thief said the Monk
of him heard I never good.
Thou lie then said little John
and that shall sore rue thee.
He is a yeoman of the Forest
to dine he has bode thee.
Much was ready with a Bow
ready and anon.
He set the monk to fore the breast
to the ground he began gone
Of two and fifty wight yeomen
there abode but one
Save a little Page and a groom
to lead the summers with little John.
they brought the monk to the lodge door
whither he were loath or leefe
For to speak with Robin
mangre in their teeth
Robin did down his hood
the monk when he did see
the monk was not so curteise
his hood then let it be.
He is a churl master by dear worthy God
then said little John:
Thereof no force said Robin
for courtesy can he none.
How many men said Robin
had this monk John:
Fifty and two, when that we met
but many of them be gone.
Let blow we a horn said Robin
that fellowship may us know
Seven score of wight yeomen
came pricking on a row
And euerich of them a good mantell
of scarlet and of raye,
All they came to good Robin
to wete what he would say
They made the monk to wash and wipe
and sit at his diner:
Robin hood and little John
they served him both in fere.
Do gladly monk said Robin
gramercy sir said he:
Where is your abbay when you are at home
and who is your auowe
Saint Mary abbay said the monk
though I be simple here.
In what office said Robin
sir the hie Sellerere.
Ye be the more welcome said Robin
So mote I thrive of thee
Fill of the best wine said Robin
this monk shall drink to me
But I have great marvel said Robin
of all this long day,
I dread our Lady be wrath with me
she sent me not my pay.
have no dout master said little John swear
you need not so to say
This monk has brought it I dare well
for he is of her abbay.
She was a borrowe said Robin
between a knight and me
Of a little money that I him lent
under the green wood tree:
And if thou have the money brought
I pray thee let me see
And I shall help thee eft again
if thou have need of me.
The Monk swore a full great oath
with a sorry cheer,
of the borrowhood thou speak to me
heard I never ere.
I make my auow to God said Robin
Monk thou art too blame,
for God is hold a right wise man,
and so is his Dame:
Thou toldest with thine own tongue
thou may it not denay,
how thou art her servant,
and seruest her every day:
And thou art her Messenger
my money for to pay,
therefore I do thee thank
thou art come at thy day.
What is in your coffers said Robin,
truth then tell thou me,
Sir he said twenty mark,
so might I thrive and thee.
If there be no more said Robin
I will not take one penny,
if thou have need of any more
sir more shall I lend thee:
And if I find more said Robin,
ywis thou shall it forgone,
for of thy spending money Monk
thereof I will have none.
Go now forth little John,
and the truth tell thou me,
if there be no more but twenty mark,
no penny let me see.
Little John laid his mantle down,
as he had done before,
and told out of the Mankes male
eight hundredth pound and more.
Little John let it lie full still,
and went to his Master in have:
Sir he said the Monk is true now,
our Lady has doubled your cost.
I make mine auow to God said Robin
Monk that told I thee:
Our Lady is the truest woman
that ever yet found I me.
By dear worthy God said Robin,
to seek all England through,
yet found I never to my pay
a much better borrow.
Fill of the best wine and to him drink said Robin
and greet well thy Lady hend,
and if she have need of Robin hood,
a friend she shall him find:
And if she have need of any more silver
come thou again to me,
and by this token she has me sent
she shall have such three.
The Monk was going to Londonward
there to hold great mote,
the Knight that rode so hie on horse
to bring him under foot.
Whither be ye away said Robin,
sir to manners in this land,
to reckon with our reues,
that have done much wrong.
Come now forth little John
and hearken to my tale,
a better yeoman I know none
to seek a Monks male.
And what is in ye other coffer said Robin
the soothe we must see
By our Lady said the Monk
that were no courtesy
To bid a man to dinner
and since him beat and bind.
It is our old manner said Robin
to leave but little behind.
The Monk took the horse with spur
no longer would abide.
Ask to drink then said Robin
or that ye farther ride.
Nay for God said the Monk
Me rueth I came so near
For better chepe I might have dined
in Blithe or Dancaster.
Greet well your Abbot said Robin
and your Priour I you pray
And bid hun send me such a Monk
to dinner every day.
Now let we that Monk be still
and speak we of that knight
Yet he came to hold his day
while that it was light
He did him straight to Bernesdale
under the greenwood tree:
And he found there Robin hood
and all his merry menie.
The Knight light from his good palfrey
Robin when he can see,
Right courteously he did down his hood
and set him on his knee.
God thee save good Robin hood
and all this company.
Welcome be thou gentle Knight,
and right welcome to me:
Then bespoke good Robin
to that Knight so free:
What need drives thee to greene-wood
I pray thee sir Knight tell me,
and welcome be thou gentle Knight,
why have thou be so long:
The Abbot and the high Justice
they would have had my land.
Have thou thy land again said Robin,
truth then tell thou me:
Yea for God then said the Knight,
and thank I God and thee.
But take no grief said the Knight
that I have be so long,
I came by a wrestling,
and there did I help a poor yeoman
with wrong they put behind,
Now by my truth then said Robin,
for that Knight thank I thee,
what man that helps a good yeoman
his friend then will I be.
Have here cccc. pound said the Knight
the which ye lent to me:
And there is xx. mark for your courtesy.
Nay fore God said Robin
thou brook it well for ay,
for our Lady by her hie Sellerer
has sent to me my pay,
and I should take it twice
a shame it were for me,
but truly gentle Knight
welcome thou art to me.
And when Robin had told his tale,
he laughed and made good cheer:
By my troth then said the knight
your money is ready here.
Brook it well said Robin
thou gentle knight so free,
And welcome be thou gentleknight
under this trusty tree:
But what shall these Bows do he said
and these Arrows fethered free,
By God then said the gentle knight
a poor present to thee.
Come now forth little John
my will done that it be,
Go and fetch me four hundredth pounds
the monk over told it me:
Have here four hundredth pound
thou gentle Knight and true,
And buy thee horse and harnes good
and gilt thy spucres all new:
And if thou fail any spending
come to Robin hood,
And by my troth thou shall not fail
whilste I have any good:
And brook well for thy hundredth pound
which I did send to thee,
And make thy self no more so bare
by the counsel of me.
Thus then help him good Robin
the Knight of all his care,
God that sits in heaven hie
grant us well to fare.
The fifth fit.
NOw has the Knight his lean take
and wend him on his way,
Robin hood and his merry men
dwell still full many a day.
Lythe and listen Gentlemen,
and hearken what I shall say,
how the proud Sheriff of Nottingham
did cry a full fair play,
that all the best archers of the North
should come upon a day,
and they that shoot all of the best
the best shall bear away,
He that shoots all of the best
furthest fair and low,
at a pair of goodly Buttes
under the green wood shawe,
a right good Arrow he should have
the shaft of silver white,
the head and feathers of richred gold,
in England is none the like.
This then heard good Robin
under his trusty tree:
Make ye ready you wight yeomen,
that shooting will I see,
buske you my merry yeomen
ye shall go with me:
And I shall know the Sheriffs faith
true and if he be.
When they had their vows ybend,
their arrows fethered free,
seauenscore wight yeomen
stood by Robins knee.
When they came to Nottingham
the Buttes were fair and long:
Many were the bold archers
that shot with bows strong:
There shall but six shoot with me,
the other shall keep my head,
and stand with good bows bent
that I be not deceived:
The first outlaw his vow began bend,
and that was Robin hood:
and that beheld the proud Sheriff
all by the buttes where he stood.
Thrice Robin shot about,
and always he claue the wand:
And so did good Gilbert
with the lilly-white hand.
Little John and good Scathlock
were archers good and free,
little Much and good Reinald
the worst they would not be.
When they had shot about
these archers fair and good,
evermore then was the best
for sooth Robin hood.
To him was delivered the good Arrow,
for best worthy was he,
he took the gift full courteously,
to greene-wood then would he.
They cried out on Robin hood,
a great horn began he blow:
Woe worth thee treason said Robin
for evil tohu art to know:
And woe be to thee thou proud Sheriff
thus cheering thy guest,
an other promise thou made to me
within the green forest:
But and I had thee there again
under the trusty tree,
thou should give me a better wed
then thy true lewte,
Full many a bow there was bent,
and arrows let they glide:
Many a kirtle there was torn,
and hurt many a side.
The out-lawes shot was so strong,
that no man might them drive,
and the proud Sheriffs men
they fled away beliue,.
Robin saw the bushment broke,
in greene-wood he would have be,
many an arrow there was shot
among the company.
Little John he was hurt full sore
with an arrow on the knee,
that he might neither go nor ride,
it was full great pity.
Master then said little John
if ever you loved me,
and for that ylke Lords love
that died upon a tree,
and for the meeds of my service
that I have served thee,
let never the proud Sheriff
alive now find me,
but take out thy brown sword,
and smite thou off my head,
and give me wounds so wide and long
that I after eat no bread.
I would not said Robin
John that thou were slain
for all the gold in merry England
though I had it all by me.
God forbid that said little Much then
that died on a tree
that thou should little John
depart our company:
Up he took him on his back,
and bare hun well a mile,
many a time he set him down
and shot another while.
Then was there a fair Castle
a little within the wood,
double ditched it was about,
and walled by the Rood:
And there dwelt that gentle Knight
sir Richard of the Lee
that Robin had lent his good
under the green wood tree.
In he took good Robin,
and all his company:
Welcome Robin hood
welcome art thou to me,
I do thee thank for thy comfort
and for thy courtesy
And for thy great kindenes,
under the green wood tree,
I love no man in all the world
so much as I do thee:
For all the proud Sheriff of Notingham
right here shall thou be.
Shut the gates and draw the bridge
and let no man come in,
And arm you well and make you ready
and to the wall ye win.
For one thing Robin I thee hite,
And swear by Saint Quintine,
thou shall these twelve days abide with me
to sup, eat and dine.
Boordes were laid and clothes were spread
ready and anon
Robin hood and his merry men
to meat began they gone.
The sixth fit.
LYthe and listen Gentlemen,
and hearken unto the song,
how the proud Sheriff began,
and men of arms strong
full fast came to the hie Sheriff
the country up to rout,
and they beset the Knights Castle
the walls all about.
The proud Sheriff loud began cry,
and said thou traitor Knight,
thou keep there the Kings enemies
against all law and right.
Sir I will anow what I have done,
the deeds that here be dight,
upon all the lands that I have
as I am true Knight:
Wend forth sirs on your way,
and do ye no more to me
till you wit your Kings will
what he will say to thee.
The Sheriff thus had his answer
without any leasing:
Forth he went to London Town
all for to tell our King,
there he told him of that Knight,
and eke of Robin hood,
and also of the bold archers,
that noble were and good,
he would auow that he had done
to maintain the out-lawes strong
he would be Lord and set you at naught
in all the north land.
I will be at Nottingham said the King
within this fortnight,
and take I will Robin hood,
and so will I that Knight.
Go home thou proud Sheriff,
and do as I you bid,
and ordain good archers enough
of all the wide country.
The Sheriff had his leave ytake,
and went him on his way:
And Robin hood to greene-wood
upon a certain day.
And little John was hole of the arrow
that was shot in his knee:
And did him strait to Robin hood
under the greene-wood tree.
Robin hood walked in the Forest,
under the leaves green,
the proud Sheriff of Nottingham
therefore had great teene.
The Sheriff there he failed of Robin hood
he might not have his pray,
then he awaited that gentle Knight
both by night and day,
ever awaited that gentle Knight
sir Richard of the Lee:
As he went on banking by the river side
and let his Hawk flee.
To betray this gentle knight
with men of arms strong,
And led him home to Notingham-ward
ybound both foot and hand,
The Sheriff swore a full great oath
by him that died on a tree,
he had rather then a hundredth pound
that Robin hood had he.
Then the Lady the Knights wife.
a fair Lady and free,
she set her on a good Palfray,
to greene-wood anon rode she:
When she came to the Forest.
under the greene-wood tree
there found she Robin hood,
and all his merry menye:
God thee save good Robin,
and all thy company:
For our dear Ladies love
a boon grant thou me:
Let thou never my wedded Lord
shamefully slain be:
He is fast bound to Nottingham-ward
for the love of thee:
Anon then said good Robin
to that Lady free,
What man has thy Lord ytake?
The proud Sheriff then said she,
he is not yet passed three miles,
you may them overtake,
Up then start good Robin
as a man that had been wake.
Buske ye my merry yeomen
for him that dyed on a tree,
And he that this sorrow forsakes
by him that dyed on a tree.
And by him that all things makes
no longer shall dwell with me:
Soon there were good vows ybent
more then seven score,
Hedge ne ditche they spared none
that was them before.
I make mine auow to God said Robin
the Knight would I feign see,
And if ye may him overtake
yquight then shall he be.
And when they came to Nottingham
they walked in the street,
And with the proud Sheriff ywis
soon began they meet.
Abide thou proud Sheriff he said
abide and speak with me,
Of some tidings of our King
I would feign hear of thee,
this seven year by dear worthy God
ne yede I so fast on foot.
I make mine auow to God thou proud sheriff
that is not for thy boot:
Robin bent a good Bow
An arrow he drew at his will,
He hit so the proud sheriff
upon the ground he lay full still.
And ere he might up arise
on his feet to stand,
He smote of the sheriffs head
with his bright brand.
Lie thou there the proud sheriff
evil may thou thrive,
there might no man to thee trust
the whiles thou were alive.
His men drew out their bright swords
that were so sharp and keen,
And laid it on the Sheriffs men
and drive them down by deene.
Robin start to that knight
and cut in twe his band,
And took him in his hand a Bow
and bad him by him stand.
Leave thy horse thee behind
and learn for to run,
Thou shall with me to green wood
through mire, moss and feene.
thou shall with me to greenewood
without any leasind,
till that I have get us grace
of Edward our comely King.
The vii. fit.
THe King came to Nottingham
with knights in great array,
For to take that gentle Knight
and Robin hood if he may.
He asked them of that country
after Robin hood
And after that gentle knight
that was so boulde and stout,
when they had told him the case
our King understood their tale,
And seized in his hand
all the knights land:
The compass of Lankashire
he wend both far and near.
Till he came to Plumpton park
he failed many of his Dear.
There the king was wont to see
herds many a one,
He could uneath find any Dear
that bare any good horn.
the King was wonder wroth withal
and swore by the Trinity,
I would I had Robin hood
with eyes I might him see.
And he that would smite of the knights head
and bring it unto me.
He should have the knights lands
sir Richard of the Lee:
I give it him with my charter
and seal it with my hand,
To have and hold for evermore
in all merry England,
than bespake a fair old knight
that was true in his fay,
O my liege Lord the King
one word I shall you say:
there is no man in this country
may have the knights lands,
While Robin hood may ride or gone
and bear a Bow in his hands.
that he ne shall lose his head
that is his best ball in his hood,
Give it to no man my Lord the King
that ye will any good.
Half a year dwelled our comely King
in Nottingham and well more,
Could he not hear of Robin hood
in what country that he were,
but allway went good Robin
by halt and eke by hill,
and always he slew the Kings Dear,
and used them at his will.
Than bespake a proud Foster
that stood by our Kings knee,
If ye will see good Robin,
you must do after me:
take five of the best knights
that now be in your led,
And walk down by your Abbay
And get you a Monks wede.
And I will be your lodes man
and lead you on the way,
And ere you come at Notingham
my head then dare I lay:
that ye shall meet with good Rodin
on live if that he be,
Or ye come to Nottingham
with eyes ye shall him see.
full hastily our king was dight
so were his knights five,
they were all in Monks weeds
and hasted them thither blithe
Our King was great above his coule
a broad hat on his Crown,
Right as he were Abbot like
they rode up in the town:
Stiff boots our King had on
forsooth as I you say,
He rode singing to green-wood
the covent was clothed in gray.
His male horse and his great summer
followed our King behind,
Until they came to greenwood
a mile under the linde.
there they met with good Robin
standing by the way,
And so did many a bold Archer
forsooth as I you say.
Robin took the Kings horse
hastily in that stead,
And sir Abbot by your leave
a while you must abide:
We be yeomen of this Forest
under the greenewood tree,
We live by our Kings Dear
other shift have not we.
And ye have Churches and rents both
and good full great plenty,
Give us some of your spending
for saint Chritie.
Then bespake our comely King
anon then said he,
I brought no more to greenwood
but forty pound with me:
I have lain at Nottingham
this fortnight with our King,
And spent I have much good
on many a great Lording:
And have but forty pound
no more then have I me,
But if I had a hundredth pound
I would give it to thee.
Robin took the forty pound
and divided it then did he,
Half he gave to his merry men
and bad them merry be:
Full courteously Robin began say,
have this for your spending,
we shall meet another day
gramercy then said our King.
but well thee greeteth Edward our king
he has sent to thee his Seal,
And bids thee come to Nottingham
both to meat and meal:
He took out the broad Seal
and soon he let him see,
Robin could his courtesy
and set him on his knee.
I love no man in all the world
so well as I do my King,
Welcome be my Lords Seal
and Monk for thy tyding:
Sir Abbot for thy tyding
to day thou shall dine with me,
For the love of my King
under the trusty tree.
Forth he had our comely King
full fair by the hand,
Many a Dear there was slain
and full was fast dight and:
Robin took a full great horn
and loud he began it blow,
Seven score of wight yeomen
came running on a row.
All they kneeled on their knee
full fair before Robin,
The King said himself until
and swore by saint Austin,
Here is a wonder seemly sight
me thinks by Gods pine,
His men are more at his bidding
then my men be at mine.
Full hastily was their dinner dight,
and thereto can they gone,
they served our king with all their might
both Robin and little John.
Anon before our King was set
the fat Venison.
the good white bread, the good red wine
and thereto the good Ale brown:
Make good cheer said Robin
Abbot for charity,
And for this ylke tiding
blessed may thou be.
Now shall thou see what life I lead
or that thou hence wend,
then thou may inform our King
when ye together be lend:
Up they start all in haste
their Bows were smartly bent,
Our King was never so sore aghast
he went to have been shent.
Two yardes there were up set
thereto can they gang,
By fiftye pace our King said
the marks were too long:
On every side a rose garland
they shot under the line,
who so fails of the rose garland said Robin
his tackle he shall tine,
And yield it to his master
be it never so fine.
For no man will I spare
so drink I ale or wine
A good buffet on his head bear
for this shall be his fine
And those that fell to Robins lot
he smote them wonder sare
twice Robin shot about
and ever he claue the wand,
And so did good Gilbert
with the lilly white hand.
Little John and good Scathlock
for nothing would they spare,
When they failed of the garland
Robin smote them full sare,
At the last shoot that Robin shot
fore all his friends fair.
Yet he failed the garland
three fingers and more,
Then bespake good Gilbert
and then he began say,
Master he said your tackle is lost
stand forth and take your pay.
If it be so said Robin
that may no better be,
Sir Abbot I deliver thee mine arrow
I pray thee serve thou me.
It falls not for mine order said ye King
Robin be thy leave,
For to smite no good yeoman
for dout I should him grieve.
Smite one boldly said Robin
I give thee largely leave,
Anon our King with that word
he folded up his sleue.
And such a buffet he gave Robin
to ground he yede full near,
I make mine auow to God said Robin
thou art a tall Friar:
There is pith in thine arm said Robin
I trow thou can well shoot
Thus our King and Robin hood
together began they meet:
Robin beheld our comely King
steadfast in the face,
So did Sir Richard at the Lee
and kneeled down in that place.
And so did all the said outlawes
when they saw them kneel,
My Lord the King of England
now I know you well.
Mercy then said Robin to our King
under this trusly tree,
Of thy goodness and thy grace
for my men and for me.
And yet said good Robin
as good God do me save,
I ask thee mercy my Lord the King
and for my men I it crave.
Yes for God said our King
thy petition I grant thee,
So that thou will leave the greenwood
and all thy company:
And come home to my Court
there to dwell with me.
I make mine auow to God said Robin
and right so shall it be,
I will come to your Court
your service for to see,
And bring with me of my men
seuenscore and three
But and I like not your service
I will come again full soon
And shoot at the dunne dear
as I was wunt to done.
The viii. fit.
Have thou any green cloth said our king
that thou will sell to me
Yea for God said Robin
thirty yardes and three.
Robin said our king
now pray I thee
To sell me some of that cloth
to me and my meynye:
Yes for God then said Robin
or else I were a fool
An other day ye will me clothe
Itrowe against the yule.
The king cast of his cote then
a green garment he did on
And every knight had so ywis
they clothed them full soon
When they were clothed in Lincoln green
they cast a way the gray
Now shall we to Notingham
all this our king can say
They bent their bows and forth they went
shooting all in fere
toward the town of Nottingham
outlawes as thy were
Our king and Robin rode together
forsooth as I you say
And all they shot pluck buffet
as thy went by the way
And many a buffet our King wan.
of Robin hood that day,
And nothing spared good Robin
our King when he did pay.
So God me help said the King
thy game is naught to lere,
I should not get a shot of thee
though I shot all this year.
All the people of Nottingham
they stood and beheld,
they saw nothing but mantles of green
that covered all the field.
Then every man together can say
I dread our King be stone.
Come Robin hood to the town ywis
on live he leaves not one.
Full hastily they began to flee
both yeomen and knaves,
And old wives that might evil go
they hipped on their staves.
The King lough full fast
and commanded them to come again
when they saw our comely King
ywis they were full feign:
They eat and drank and made them glad
and sung with notes hye,
Then bespake our comely King
to sir Richard of the Lee,
He gave him there his land again
a good man he had him be.
Robin hood thanked our comely King
and set him on his knee.
Robin hood dwelled in the Kings court
but twelve months and three,
that he had spent an hundredth pound
and all his men's fee.
In every place where Robin came
evermore he laid down,
Both for Knights and Squires
to get him a great renown.
By than the year was all gone
he had no man but twain,
Little John and good Scathelock
with all for to gone:
Robin saw young men shoot
full fair upon a day,
Alas then said good Robin
my wealth is wend away.
Sometime I was an archer good
a stiff and eke a strong,
I was commended for the best archer
that was in merry England:
Alas then said good Robin
alas what shall I do,
If I dwell longer with the King
sorrow will me slo.
Forth then went Robin hood
till he came to our King,
My Lord the King of England
grant me my asking.
I made a Chapel in bernisdale
that seemly is to see.
It is of Mary Magdalen
and there would I feign be.
I might no time this seven nights
no time to sleep one wink,
Neither all this seven days
another eat nor drink.
Me longs sore to Bernisdale
I may not be there fro
Bare foot and wolward have I hight
thither for to go
If it be so then said our king
it may no better be
Seven nights I give thee leave
no longer to dwell from me.
Gramarcy Lord then said Robin
and set him on his knee,
He took his leave full courteously
to greenwood then went he.
When he came to greenwood
in a merry morning,
There he heard the notes small
of birds merry singing.
It is far gone said Robin
that I was last here,
I have a little lust for to shoot
at the dunne dear.
Robin slew a full great heart
his horn then can he blow.
That all the outlawes of that Forest
that horn could they know:
and gathered them together
in a little throw,
Seauenscore of wight yeomen
came running on a row.
And fair did of their hoods
and set them on their knee,
Welcome they said our master
under the greenwood tree,
Robin dwelled in greenwood
twenty years and two,
Then for dred of Edward our King
again would he not go:
Yet he was beguiled ywis
through a wicked woman.
the prioresse of Kirkesley
that nigh was of his kin,
For the love of a knight
sir Roger of Dankastre.
For evil mote they thee,
they took together their counsel
Robin hood for to sley:
And how they might best do that deed
his banes for to be
Then bespake good Robin
in place whereas he stood,
to morrow I must to Kirkesley
craftily to be letten blood.
Sir Roger of Dancastre
by the prioresse he lay,
And there they betrayed Robin hood
through their false play:
Christ have mercy on his soul
that died on the rood,
For he was a good outlaw
and did poor men much good.
* Thus ends the life of Robin hood.
Here begins the play of Robin Hood, very proper to be played in May games.
Robin hood. NOw stand ye forth my merry men all
and hark what I shall say,
Of an adventure I shall you tell
the which befell this other day.
As I went by the high way
with a stout Friar I met.
And a quarter staff in his hand,
lightly to me he leapt
And still he bad me stand.
there were stripes two or three,
But I cannot tell who had the worse
but well I wot the whoreson
Leapt within me
and fro me took my pursse.
Is there any of my merry men all
that to the Friar will go,
And bring him to me forth withal
whether he will or no.

Little John. Yes Master I make God auow
to that Friar will I go,
And bring him to you
whither he will or no,

Friar Tuck. Deus hic, Deus hic, God be here
is not this a holy word of a Friar,
God save all this company,
But am not I a jolly Friar
For I can shoot both far and near.
and handly the sword and buckler
and this quarter staff also
If I meet with a gentle man or yeman,
I am not afraid to look him upon
nor boldly with him to carp^,
If he speak any words to me,
He shall have stripes two or three
that shall make his body smart.
But masters to show you the matter
wherefore and why I am come hither
in faith I will not spare,
I am come to seek a good yeoman
in Bernisdale men say is his habitation
His name is Robin hood
And if he be better man then I
his servant will I be and serve him truly
But if that I be a better man then he
by my truth my knave shall he be
and lead these dogs all three.

Robin hood. Yield thee Friar in thy long cote my throat,


Friar tuck I beshrew thy heart Knave thou hurtest


Robin hood. I trow Friar thou beginnest to dote
who made thee so malapert and so bold,
To come into this Forest here,
among my fallow dear.

Friar. Go louse thee ragged knave
if thou make many words I will give thee on ye ear
though I be but a poor Friar
to seek Robin hood I am come here
and to him my heart to break.
thou lousie Friar what would thou with him
he never loved Friar nor none of Friars kin.

Friar Auaunt ragged knave
or ye shall have on the skin.

Robin hood Of all the men in a morning thou art ye worst
to meet with thee I have no lust,
For he yt meets a friar or a fox in the morning
to speed ill that day he stands in ieopardie
therefore I had rather meet with the devil
Friar I tell thee as I think,
then meet with a friar or a fox
in a morning or I drink.

Friar Auaunt thou ragged knave this is but a mock
if you make many words you shall have a knock,

Robin hood Hark friar what I say here,
over this water thou shall me bear
the bridge is borne away.

Friar To say thee nay I will not
to let thee of thine oath it were great pity and sin
but upon a Friars back and have even in.

Robin hood Nay have over.


Friar now am I friar within and thou Robin without,
to lay thee here I have no great doubt:
Now art thou Robin without and I friar within
Lie there knave. choose either sink or swim.

Robin hood Why thou lousie friar what have thou done


Friar Marry set a knave over the shoon,


Robin hood Therefore thou shall abye


Friar Why will thou fight a pluck


Robin hood And God send me good luck,


Friar Then have a stroke for Friar tuck.


Robin hood Hold thy hand Friar and hear me speak


Friar Say on ragged knave
me seems ye begin to sweat.

Robin hood In this Forest I have a hound
I will not give him for an hundredth pound:
Give me leave my horn to blow,
that my hound may know.

Friar Blow on ragged knave without any doubt,
until both thine eyes start out:
Here is a sort of ragged knaves come in
Clothed all in kendall green
and to thee they take their way now.

Robin hood Peradventure they do so


Friar I gave thee leave to blow at thy will,
now give me leave to whistle my sill.

Robin hood Whistle Friar evil might thou fare,
until both thine eyes stare.

Friar Now cut and Bause,
Bring forth the clubbes and staves
And down with those ragged knaves.

Robin hood How say thou Friar will thou be my man
to do me the best service thou can,
Thou shall have both gold and fee,
And also here is a lady free I will give her unto thee
And her chaplain I thee make
to serve her for my sake.

Friar Here is a huckle duckle an inch above the buckle
She is a trul of trust to serve a friar at his lust
A pricker, a prauncer, a tearer of sheets,
a wagger of buttocks when other men sleeps,
Go home ye knaves and lay crabs in the fire
for my lady and I will dance in the mire for very pure joy.

Robin hood. Listen my merry men all
and harken what I shall say,
Of an adventure I shall you tell
that befell this other day:
With a proud potter I met
and a rose garland on his head,
the flowers of it shone marvelous fresh
this seven year and more he has used this way
Yet was he never so courteous a potter
as one penny passage to pay.
Is there any of my merry men all
that dare be so bold,
to make the Potter pay passage
either stluer or gold.

Little John Not I master for twenty pound ready told
For there is not amongst us all one that
dare meddle with that potter man for man
I felt his hands not long agon
but I had lever be here by thee,
therefore I know what he is
Meet him when ye will
or meet him when you shall,
He is as proper a man as ever you meddled withal

Robin hood I will lay with thee little John xx. pound so red
if I with the potter meet
I will make him pay passage mauger his head.

Little John I consent thereto so I eat bread,
If he pay passage mauger his head
twenty pound shall ye have for your meed.

The potters boy Jack. Out alas that ever I saw this day.
For I am clean out of my way:
From Nottingham town,
If I me hie not the faster
Or I come there the market will be done.

Robin Let me see are thy pots whole and sound.


Jack Yea master but they will not break ye ground sake


Robin I will them break-for the cuckold thy masters
And if they will break the ground
thou shall have three pence for a pound.

Jack Out alas what have you done
if my master come he will break your crown

the Potter Why thou whoreson art thou here yet
thou should have been at market.

Jack I met with Robin hood a good yeman
He has broken my pottes
and called you Cuckold by your name.

Potter Thou may be a gentleman so God me save,
but thou seem a naughty knave:
Thou call me a cuckold by my name.
And I swear by God and saint John.
Wife had I never none
this cannot I deny
But if thou be a good fellow
I will sell my horse harnes, pots and paniers too
thou shall have the one half and I the other
if thou be not so content thou shall have
stripes if thou were my brother.

Robin Hark potter what I shall say.
this 7. year and more thou have used this way
Yet were thou never so courteous to me
as one penny passage to pay.

Potter Why should I pay passage to thee,


Robin For I am Robin hood chief governor
under the greene-wood tree.

Potter This seven year I used this way up and down
yet paid I passage to no man,
Nor now I will not begin do the worst you can.

Robin Passage shall thou pay here under the greenwoodtree
or else thou shall leave a wed with me:

Potter If thou be a good fellow as men do thee call,
lay away thy bow
And take thy sword and buckler in thy hand
and see what shall befall.

Robin hood Little John where art thou,

Little John Here master I make auow
I toulde you master so God me save,
that you should find the potter a knave:
Hold your buckler fast in your hand,
and I will stiffely by you stand,
Ready for to fight,
Be the knave never so stout
I shall rap him on the snout,
and put him to flight.

Thus ends the play of Robin hood.
