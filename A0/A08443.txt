Unto The right Honorable LORD Edward / Duke of Somerset most dear uncle
unto the Kings Majesty / and Gouuernour of his Royal Parson / and of his
Realms / Dominions and subjects Protector. His graces most humble Servant
Rychard Argentyne wissheth the increase of honor and grace.
Like as in the beginig (most Gracyous Lord) it may appear by the propre
names of men / that the same were appointed unto them by a synguler reason.
Genes. 4.
So by Seth also it may be manifest that Kings are given unto the World of
God. Genes. 1.
For after the time that the infinite Lord / had created the universal world
/ and reserved the supremite of it unto him self / he made man Prince and
Lord / and a King immediately under hiouer all / which might exercise his
office / him self not being parsonaly present before our eyes / to the intent
that we should always elevate the same unto Heaven there to seek him. And
therefore of just cause Kings / Princes ande Gouuernours that most lively and
notably represe^t unto us the divine majesty of God / being endued with a large
porcio^ of the same / are called Gods in the scripture. Genes. 6.
Psalm. 82.
And of the profane poet Homere are named to come from God.

These Princes and Kings / as it appears in the register of thiges done in
time / were in most places accustumed eue^ from their tender age / to be
brought up under iiij. gouuernours. Justice / Prudence / Fortitude and
continency / amongst the which virtues. Justice being the highest of power
albeit that with her manyfold benefittes / necessary unto the use of man / she
goes upon the ground / yet that notwithstanding with her shulders she
reaches unto heaven. For as much as she covers nothig to her self nor
craves any thing / but gives unto every man his own / ande restores every
thing unto his right order and kind. Paral. 16.
Where therefore the people of God made great joy ande feasted for their true
religion restored / and were joyful for the confyrmyng of their King / the
which did minister unto them only externally judgment ande justice / what
ipye / ought all this realm to be in / unto whom it has fortuned the right
order of the supper of the LORD to be restored / through the study of such a
Prince as walks in all the ways of God in goodness and faith / led by a
Gouuernour that most parfectly has trained him to the same? 2. Reg. 6.
Psalm. 25.
In whom the spirit of Jesus christ that was ones only offered / manifestlye
produces his effects. Phil. 1.
And where as in our days many that of right ought to be called martirs /
like unto Paul / intendig that Christ should be magnyfyed in their bodies or by
their death / with their blood / did not stick to give a testimony unto the
world of the internal goodness prepared unto the saints hereafter / and fed
the ravening wolves with their carcases. Now (God be blessed) by our so
gracyous a Prince / their teth are blunted and their mouths musseled. For
those that should have been the light / that the fruit of righteousness that
comes by Jesus Christ only / might have been planted in many / like unto the
Phariseys that had miracles comune unto them with the fathers / and the
presence also of the most mekest lamb of God / the which did illustrate them
with his doctrine ande miracles / would in no case come to any amendment. And
yet they glory that their name was prophesied to be exercised in justice by
the prophet Esaias. Esaias. 60.
Where the ixx. interpreters have (if it be their text and not others) I shall
give thy Princes in peace / and thy Bysshoppes in justice. But the Hebrewe text
(if they will that place to be meant of them and not of other publyke officyers)
calls them more (accordyngly unto the truth) exactours or cursitours /
nothing seking for the founteine of all saturite lacking the frugalite that
Paul wills the^ to use. The which thing they would not if they had in them
the careful mind of the just execution of things to be done unto Gods
honor. Like as by the shauing of their beardes and of their heads (the which
were in the old time tokens of a pensyve ande sad mind) they appear to
have. Esaias. 15.
But treuth it is / that like as the bearde (that was accounted to be the
ornament of the man) is hateful unto them / and is not to be found amongst
them / so is the study of all good virtue amongst others and not amongst
them. And therefore the migtye LORD has appointed your grare unto the same
office for the comfort of all the faithful / as the necessary hand of a King
gyve^ unto us by God. And to that purpose these syx Sermons of the famous
clerk Bernardinus Ochinus are translated out of the Italyan tongue. The first
declaring what thing GOD is. The second / How to know GOD by his creatures.
The third if Phylosophye serve to true theologye and in what manner. Fourthely /
How we ought to use the Scryptures in attayninge the knowledge of GOD. Fyfthly
/ Of thinconue mences that are happened and daily happen by the abuse of the
holy scriptures. Syxtly and finally / If to be good divines it behoue us to
have the human sciences or not / and geve^ unto your grace as a most
unworthy gift / that by your graces favor the fruit of all the oher sermons
may be brought unto your graces louinge servauntes of the whole body of this
Realm / unto whose comfort the lord IESV Christ preserve your grace. At
Ippeswych the xiiij. day of February. Anno. M.D. xlviij.

The preface.
WHo well co^sydereth where unto we are created / good Christen reader / shall
find that of all our trauayles there is rests no fruit / as proves the holy
spirit of prophetie by the mouth of Solomon saying. I have looked upon all the
things under the son / and have found none other but vanite. Only reserved
the Image of God in us / beig the spirit that susteineth not the natural life
alone / but also all the holy and virtuous thoughts / which God has created
immortal unto his own likeness / as thou may wesparceaue / if thou consider
the substance of the natural body / that having the spirit / is all lively
/ and not only moves each figer / hand / foot / eye and tongue materially /
but also with the thought / penetrateth the heavens and in manner co^ceaueth a
substance i^ the immortalite of gods euerlastig kigdome / and wa^tig the
spirit / testeth dead private of al those virtues / though well thou shall se
/ that it lacks nether hand / fore / eye tongue nor other membre. This I
say unto the (Gentell reader) to the intent that thou should know / that the
almighty Creator is served not of vanities / that is to say / of bodily or
worldly exercises / but of spiritual thoughts / which are the just and true
sacrifices unto God. Ande thereby to draw the to remember the marvel of his
works / ande to think more unto thine end then to thy life. Disposi^g thy
self to learn the sciences that this little book shall teach the / which
treats of none other but of the spiritual things / and bears in it the
substance of the holy scripture which so vehement reasons and so good
persuasions / that it suffiseth to draw from the thy stony heart / and to
renew in the a carnail heart / if thou be one of them / to whom God has
determined to gyve his grace. One of them (I say) that with lively faith
confess Christ the son of God to have suffered for their sins. As the
Aucthour hereof sufficientlye persuadeth the / who (being a man of great years
/ and wonderful reputacion) for the love of Christ and of the troth / has
rather chose^ exyle and persecutyon / then con^inuau^ce of wealth / honors
and frendshyp. A man of profou^de learnig. The most notable preacher of all
Italy. Famous for the great example of his good life. Esteemed and honored of
all Princes / not for his age only (being a man of lxx years / or
theraboutes) but also for his infinite virtues and mooeste. And finallye so
beloved of all people / that in what place sorver he preached / there has ever
been found great prease of audience. All this notwithstanding at length
(because he syncerely followed the true Gospel / and did not sorbeare to
reprehe^d the public abuses of the romish Church) he was persecuted of Paul
the third / and constrained to forsake Italy / and to flee into Germany Where
he has not ceased with his pen / to follow the virtuous exhortacions / that
before time with his mouth he preached. Having thereby at this hour (God be
thanked) edifyed the most part of the good understandings in Italy / in the
true and parfect way of Christ. To whom with the father and the holighost be
praise honor and glory.

So be it.

Anthony Scoloker unto the Reader.
IF the multitude of all natyous under heaven / gathered to gether at
Kierusalem / after that the holy-goost was geven unto the Apostles / were
stonied / and mardayled much / that they heard them / speaking every man with
his own tongue / declaring the wondrous doyngs of God / how much more then
ought we to wonder in these our latter days / that have the same miracle
wrought daily amongst us also? Act. 2.
For not only the fathers that were laboring (not many years sins) ande
travaylinge in this our pilgrimage with us / and now are gone unto the lyui^g
God / do both lyvely and most godly even still at this day preach unto us /
but also the very Prophets and Patriarchs and also the whole company that have
been eve^ from the beginning of the world / are now familiar unto (...) / and
are become Inglishmen. Yea / god hi self of his great infinite mercy in our
own tongue speaks unto us / out of his most sacred word / to our great
joy and spiritual comfort. And Paul being a^ hebrew borne / has changed
his tongue / and is become ours / as though he had been bredde and brought up
all the days of his life amongst us. Wherefore albeit that the Gospel being
now confyrmed / it may appear / that miracles at these days are nothing so
necessary as they were in the prymatyue Church / when by the virtue of the
holighoost and by miracles / that new doctrine was to be confirmed / yet the
verite it self shows the same power still even now unto us / that said My
father works eve^ until this time / and I also do work. John. 5.
How great a wondre therefore is it that almost no man does marvail at / to see
that by the means of thigs committed to writtig two / though one be never so
far distau^t from the other / may communicate their secrets tegether? and yet
passig this / by the help of the same / we receave the virtuous counsels / the
most holy instruerio^s the godly prechigs of the seers (as they called the
prophets: because i^ the majesty of the aet^rnall god they did see 1. Reg. 2.
as it had been in a c^ece microur / the secret misteryes of things both past
and for to com^) and yet we mardall nothing at all. But God (not leauyng us
thus / where as by the very true monuments of the godly that are passed from us
/ their minds being ^eft with us still / we are urle or nothig amended) does
send unto us his Prophets out of strange countries / that the congregation
thereby may be edifyed / and most bound to render thanks unto hi^ for his
infinite mercy. 1. Cor. 14.
Amongst the which Bernardinus Ochinus and Petrus Martyr men of great
learning / which are now come unto us. And for as much as the said Bernard
preachech in the Italyan tongue which all men understand not / I have seth
forth syx of his Sermons out of this tongue into Inglysh. Intendinge to set
forth the rest very shortly (if these shall be thankefully received) to the
intent that his nature tongue thereby may be made ours / and that the glory of
God may the better be set forth. Unto whom all honor is due / world
wythourende.

So be it.

Sermons of Master Bernardyne Othyne / borne within the famous vniversite of
Siena in Italy / now aso an ex^le in this life / for the faithful testimony
of Jesus Christ.
Sermo i. Vhat thing God is.
Ignorance specyallye of the heave^ly things / is the greatest lack that ca^
be in man and above all other the ignorance or lack of knowledge of God. For
as it is impossible to attain the science of Philosophye Astrology Geometrye
or of any other like / without the ground or first pri^cipailes. So without
the knowledge of God the true beginning and pricypall of true deuynite it is
impossible to have any light of the troth / necessary and proffitable to the
ghostly health. And likewise / as the knowledge of the first principalles of
one science / depends the knowledge of all the troth and conclusio^s that
that science contains. So of the true knowledge of God / depends the
knowledge of all the circu^staunces and troth of Theology or Deuinite
Wherefore seeing how much pestiferous and detestable the ignorance of God is /
and how much necessary the true knowledge of him is / I have thought it
expedient / first to consider what thing God is.

It is a most easy thing to know that God is / or that there is a god /
since that there is no Nation so barbarous / but that it believes that there
is a God / being a general knowledge that God has so imprinted in the hearts
of al men / that if the man have any judgment at all / it behooves him with
the heart to confess that there is a God. For albeit there have been many
wicked which with their mouths have said / there is no God. Nevertheless the
self same / when they have fallen into any peril or necessite / have been
e^forced of that only light and religion of God / to reco^mende them selves
unto him / so that we must of force repute hi^ a very ydeote / that demeth God.
Psalm. 13.
Ande being therefore an evident and easy thing to endwe that there is a God /
we most now travail a^de labor (though it be most (...)) to know what that
god is. (...) have bee^ of opimo^ that it is impossible that ^^e should Imagine
what God is because infinitene above all propor^ions h^ exced^ to the weakness
of our vndersta^ding^ / spe^^ally because our wi^^es are drowned in the body /
occupied of fan^as^^s / and (...) by the derke veins of things (...) / far
of from God. We be weak of (...) ^eke and impole^t through the (...) and our
own sins. Wherefore they ^aye that we ca^ have noue other knowledge of God /
but the negative / that is to wit / we may know that God is not material
nor form imperfect nor yet soul of the world / that he is not Earth / Water /
Air / Fire / Wind / seecre / Mons / Son / Corporal light nor any virtue
spredde abroad. He is not the beaultie that we see / the swetenes that we
taste / nor other thing sensible / imaginable or intelligible of us / but that
infinitely he exceadeth all creatures / and all things that we understand. In
him there is an inaccessible light such as they / which with their thoughts in
manner have been raised so high / that they have found what God is have
deceued them selves. Tim. 6.
And they who ymagin in their minds to have found God / do fabricate an ydoll
/ out of all measure distaunt from the true being of God / as appears by his
commandment to the Jews / when he prohibited the^ the sculpture or grauinge
of ydolles / understanding not of the materyall ydolles only / but also of the
imaginable. Erod. 20.
For our wits are extreme darkness / in comparyson of gods inestimable first
light. So that it behooves us with Aaron to enter in Sa^cta Sanctorum and with
Moses into the Celestial Cloud / if we will know / that is to say / to know
that we know not / in so the wise that the more fervently a man will profess
not to know somoch the better he does know / and who presumes to know / is
farthest of from the knowledge. And why? because God in his power and light
stands so hid in darkness from us / that with blindness we see him / with
ignorance we know him / with retuing or with going back we comprehend him /
in fleing we find him and with scylence we praise him. Psalm. 1
And it behooves him that will know what thing God is / to study in the scole
of simpliene and rest vanquisshed of that inestimable / inaccessible ande
incomprehensible light.

And I confess that we ca^ not comprehend God / in such manner as God
comprehends him self. That is to say / we can not have a^ infinite
knowledge of him / as do the blessed saints that is to say / to have as they
have the clear naked / open and visible sight of him / to behold him in the
founteyne of his bryghtnes / face to face in the very being that he is. 1.
Cor. 2
But we may very well attain a knowledge what God is though not so perfectly
as we shall know in the other lyte. For it is not possible we should know what
thig God is not / if first we learn not to know what thing he is / and that
his being is so pertect that it repugneth thimperfectio^s of those things that
be not. Wherefore considering all the negatiues (...) are rehearsed of god are
grounded upon (...) posy^i^e and affirmatio^ that (...) / we must say of
force ^^a^ we know^ God more perfertly / in knowing that is to be known / then
in knowing nothing at all. And therefore speaking of more h^^^e knowledge
affyrmatiue / that in this present life the elect co^munly and without
special privilege and miracle had of God / I say / that first thou ought
to consider that the creature has his being / although imperfect. Ande God
has his being without any imperfeccio^ Yea his being is infinitely perfect.
wherefore to know what thing God is / it behooves the to do as he does that
will make an Image. First he cutteth of many pieces / before he parforme the
form that he deforeth / and afterward payntech and apparcelleth it.

So is it necessary that with the mind / thou thou first consider the being
of the creature. Ande because thou shall find him repleate of iperfectio^ /
being terminable create / temporal / corruptyble and other like / therefore it
behooves the to cleanse / puryfye and take from him all those imperfectyons /
and ymagyn him infinite / interminable / icorruptible and in effect abstract
and lift up above all imperfectyon. Neither does that suffice / but also it is
necessary that thou floryshe ande adorn him of all perfectyo^ possible / in
soche wise that thou conceive to see him aeterne / necessary / simple immutable
and infinite. Neither yet does all that suffice / but morouer it behooves the
with thy thought to purify and cleanse of all i^perfectyon the Will and mind
created / the wisdom created the justice bountye / pitye / power / Charity /
treuth / beaultye and all the other virtues and perfections / to which
imperfectyon is contrary / ande consequently to entythe him of infynyte
degrees of perfectyon / ande so to behold him in God as a thing puryfyed / to
be unto him / dyvyne ande intynite. BUT because those powers / virtues and
operatyons with imperfectyo^ in manner rules in us / will not suffer our wits
to conceive that creature in his being and to cleanse and spoil him of all
imperfectyons / and so to make him infinite / we can not in our being see him
in God in whom there can be nothing imperfect* but it must suffice us to see
him in virtue and eminency. So that albeit in gods propre being there is the
corporal vysyon / the imaginatyon / credulyte opinion / discourses and other
actions essentially. Nevertheles it must suffice us to se the^ in virtue and
eminencye. For to see God clearly / it includes and conteyneth all perfection
/ like as the gold conteyneth the perfection of all other metalles. He then
that sees that divine being with all perfectyon possible / sees what thing
God is / because he sees a spiritual light / most pure most clear / most
simple and exellently fair / aeterne / immutable / necessary and infinitely
perfect / replete of Celestial faelicite / justice / power / bounty / verite /
wisdom / mercy / charity and of all the other perfect^o^s and virtues
infinitely parfect and that in it / in virtue and eminencye be all the colors
/ odours / savors / sou^des / songs / swetenes / fairenes / honors /
dignityes / treasures / pleasures and faelicities of the woorld / infinitely
and without proporcyon / more perfect then they be of them selves here.

And moreover it behooves the to know that the being of the creature is a
shadow and a most fleyght vanite in comparison of Gods being / and the
difference more / then is between our shadow ande our selves. Exodus ^
It is to be said of God / that surely he is only the thing that is. Like
wise I say of our powers / beaulte truth / charity / justice / wisdom and of
all our other virtues / that compared to the divine they be as most vain
Images / and shadows / infinitely distau^t from them of god. Johan. 5.
Also it behooves to know / that God is not ydell / but that he continually
works (as Christ says) in such wise / that he has not only given unto the
world his beige / but also continuallye conserueth all the things created /
and all the virtues / that of all the miracles and strange effects / we
konwledge only God to be Aucthour and to him we give all thanks honor and
glory. So likewise ought we to knowledge of him all the natural effects and
operacions / and not to extolle or praise nature / but God only / who grueth
and preserves the bring ande virtue to all things. Neither ought there any
other chance or fortune to be named / but all to be confessed of God / and he
only to be thanked / even as he continually works for us.

And as his power is never ydell / but continual working in all creatures. So
his wisdom continually sees / disposes and ordeineth all things most best
/ and his bounty likewise continually communicates unto us his benefyttes and
graces.

Furthermore it is necessary thou know that all that god has wrought /
works or shall work in his creatures / is all for man / for whom they be
created and preserved. For all the gifts ande benefittes that from the
beginning have been made or shall be made to the creatures / Man is bound to
knowledge them as made to him / and accordingly therefore to thank God. Ande
especially the chosen or elect / to whom all creatures do serve / both the
predestinate and reprobate. Romans ^.
Yea the Anngelles and the deuelies / even to the very sines. And because God
does here manifest and discover him self / with his omni potent wisdom /
truth / justice / bounty and his other virtues ande perfections / not only
in his creatures / but much more in his scriptures / and specially in Christ on
the cross / chefely to them that by faith conceive him with spirit. Therefore
it behooves him that will know what this GOD is / to behold him particulerly
in Christ / and to beseech him to give him lively ande clear light to know
him not only in his creatures and scriptures / but specially in Christ
crucified / to the end that in him and by him / understanding the great bounty
of God / we may render unto him all honor and glory / by our Savior Jesus
Christ. Amen.

Section. ij. How to know God by his creatures.
GOD in his majesty apparelled with his perfections / and in the well of his
brightness (as says Paul) is a certain light inaccessyble and hid. 1. Tim^.
^.
But here he somewhat discovers him self by his creatures / as who will enter
into Rome / must of force know by the pyllers / sepultures / Images ande by
the great ruins that he shall find there / that the Romans in times past /
have been of great power / dominion and wisdom. Esaias. 15.
So he which enters into this world / seeing this great engine / must of
force know the maker thereof to be the God omnipotent. And beholding the order
of his creatures / must not only see but also marvel at the wisdom of God.
Psalm. 1.3.
And with David cry and say. Lord thou have created all things in wisdom.
Ande moreover it behooves him to say that GOD is best / seeing that continually
he disposes new gifts unto his creatures. And seeing that by due means he
leads them to their end / he is forced to confess GODS divine providence /
ande so in conclusion by the things created / to come to the knowledge of GOD
/ and of all his perfections / as far forth as they appear in his creatures
/ and that because the creatures be united so to gethers that each one hangs
on other / and all of GOD / in soche wise that they make a ladder to the
understanding of the natural / by the which they clyme ande ascend even to
GOD. They see that this inferior world / is gouuerned of the heavens / ande
that the heavens keep their courses uniformly / by continual moving / and
thereof be constrained to consider / that the virtue which moves the^ / being
infaticable ande never weary / is spiritual / for if it were corporal / it
should end or at the least wax weak. Ande so going farther / they consider
that that spiritual virtue / not being the supreme / is gouuerned by an
other. Ande because they can not attain the infynite everlasting / they are
forced to come to a first supream^ intelligence / the which moves without
being moved / and to a first cause independent / ande so they ascend to the
knowledge of GOD. Moreover / by the beaulte of the creatures / they asce^d to
the knowledge of the beaulte of God. By the order / Armonie and consent that
appear in the creatures / they attain the consyderation of Gods infinite
sapience or wisdom. Psalm. ^5.
Ande so by the visyble works of God (to the regard whereof David calls us /
saying Come ande behold the works of the lord) they attain to consider the
inuisyble perfections of God / his everlasting power ande Divinity as Paul
writes. ^om. ^.
There is no creature so bace nor so vile / in whom there shines not the
glory of God / in which thou may see his great power / wisdom / bounte
beaulte and the other perfectio^s. And by how much the creatures be more
noble / high / worthy and excellent / by so much the more do they discover
God. Psalm. 8.
Like as the heavens which particulerly do show the glory of God. And the more
perfectly we know the creatures Yea God in the^ / so much the more we rise to
the knowledge of God / ande by so much the more our vndersta^di^ges wholly and
with perfect light is united and copulate unto him.

It is true that many consider the creatures in the^ selves / without respect
to him that has created them / ande so co^serueth and gouuerneth them. But
those are of more gross condition then is the owl / which / because he can
not behold the Son / forces him self and takes pleasure to behold him in
the sterres. And they / not seeing God in his glory / seek not / at the lease
wise / to see him in the mirror of his creatures.

But know thou first that this ladder of the creatures to clime unto God is
perilous / because that God having put in them a certain beaultie and
swerenes / to the end that man's understanding of the taste of the sweet
running water should be provoked to seek the fonteine or spring / and thereby to
seek God with more vehemency. Many stay or rather fire them selves in the
degrees / ande never arrive to the height.

And so^me of the sight of the beaulte created / fall into vile / base /
unclean and fylthy thoughts. And other swelle in pride of that their vain
science / without climing to taste the swetenes of Gods bou^tie / fyxe them
selves in the degrees / and there show them selves contented for reward to be
seen and reputed for learned / of the blind folysh and frantyke woorlde.

Furthermore / this ladder is very hard and imperfect because that by the sin
of our first parents we are so blinded of sight / that with great difficulte
we may see god in the darkness of things created / specially because the wise
of the woorlde / coveting to search all the properties / virtues and qualyties
of the creatures / have entangled them selves with their curious thoughts to
the vain shadows of the world / that first they are attrapped of death or
ever they are a little elevated their minds toward God.

It is also a very long ladder / for the great distaunce that is between the
low sensyble creatures (at the which / as at the first step or degree it
behooves to begin at to elyme) and God. For it requires extreme labor to
arryse to the knowledge of the material substau^ces / and much more the^ to
clime with the thought to the knowledge of the imateriall. And when thou art
arrived at the perfet knouledge of the supreme creature / because between that
and God there is infinite dystau^ce / before that with the thought thou arrive
at god / thy wits shall be i^ manner so wekened that in the end thou shall
attain none other but a weak inparfect and dark co^cept.

Therefore to have sufficient light of God to the knowledge of him by the
creatures / suffiseth not to our saluatyon.

For though with all natural light we did arryve by the creatures at the
knowledge of God / yet can we be none other but good Metaphisici or natural
theologiens / and not therefore good and supernatural divines / because the
woorlde should always have more operatyon in us and in our hertes then God. We
might well leave our goods for pleasure / ande one an other for honor / as in
times past certain Philosophers have done / which left one vice perceauing
other. But no man ca^ willingly forsake the world / him self and all thing /
and have God for God / and for his only last end / but he alone to whom the
bounty of God is discovered / in soche wise that he may more in him / then
all the richesses / pleasures and dignities of the world. Whereunto suffyseth
not the bounty of God discovered in his creatures / nor all our natural light
/ as Paul writes to the Romans. (...) 1.
Whom he she wech that the natural light / which leads to the knowledge of
god by the creatures / was not enough / because thereof they had not light to
glorifye nor yield the due thanks unto GOD.

wherefore they are not to be excused which / thinking the natural light to
suffyse / and trusting in their propre forces or stre^gthes / demand none
other light of God / but are to be reputed wicked. For as much as we all have
need of the divine grace and light to know GOD suffyciently. Neither is it
enough to behold him in his creatures. But it behooves with the spirit and
supernatural light to understand him in Christ / where he discauereth him
self with so great excessyue bounty / that he rauissheth ande draws unto
him the hearts / in soche wise / that delivering them of the world / he saves
them. Let us therefore fyxe our eyes in that divine spectacle / to the end / that
fealing in him and by him the bounty of the father / we may render unto him
all honor and glory by our Savior Jesus christ. Amen.

Sermon. iij. If Phylosophie serve to true Theology or divinity / and in what
manner.
THere be so^me the which denying al supernatural light / think that in the
world there is none other Theology or divinity but the natural / which they
call Metaphysyca. And because that a Man can not be a Good Metaphysiens / unless
he be first a good Philosopher / therefore they be constrained to say / that
Philosophy serves to Theology or Divinity. Sum other / not being able to
deny Theology or divinity to be supernatural / say that it is grounded
upon the natural / in such wise that (after their sayig) as the knowledge
intellectiue requires the sensytiue / because thereof it has original /
grows and hangs or depends / so has Theology or divinity need of
Philosophy / because of it it takes beginning grows and is establisshed.

Philosophy then after their opinion / is the guide that leads unto Santa
Sa^torum / to behold the celestial things.

The ladder by the which it behooves / to clime to true Theology or
divinity. And man's reason is the rule to the which (according to their
judgments) resort all the knowledge of the divine light. And in so much do
they allow the^ / in as much as they agree / not with the holy scriptures nor
with the spirit / but with their blind human judgment / which they hold
for the scepter that she with all / even to God.

But I say / that as our human reason by the sin of our first pareutes /
is weak / blind / frenetike and foolish. So is likewise their Philosophy.
Ande that because that albeit after the sin / God left unto man a little light
of the natural things / necessary to the human life and convenient to our
miserable state. Man nevertheless / in whom rests a certain pride and
curiosyte^ / would not content him self with so simple a knowledge. As where a
certain Philosopher / giving him self thurtye years to study the knowledge of
all the properties of the be / could never perfectly attain his desire. The
others have given the^ selves to search the knowledge of all the properties /
qualities / virtues and operations of every sensyble thing ande not only of
the base ande corruptyble but also of the celestial bodies. Yea (and which is
more) they have enterprysed to speak of the Soul / of the Angels / of God
and of the things supernatural / In soche wise that (passing the lymytes of
their small light / and walking blyndely) each one has fabrycate in his mind
his own fantasy / and to the purpose have so spoken and written every one
according to his propre frenesye / where of is growe^ so great variete of
opinions / so many confusions / errors / sects ande heresies / that (as saint
Jerome justly calls them) the Philosophers are the Patryarkes of the
heretykes / ande the first begotten of Egipte. Ande it is an old proverb / a
great Philosopher a great heretyke.

The natural reason therefore / that is not healed by faith / is frenetyke and
foolysh / as thou may well think when thou considerest the presumptyon / in
that it pretends to be the guide / fou^dacyon ande ladder of the divine
knowledges. Where as it serves not to raise the man to the knowledge of God /
but much less gives him cause to confess with Socrates that not only he
knows not / but also that / without the divine grace he can do nothing.
Albeit that that Phylosophye is now so proud / that with the suppressinge and
persecutinge of Christ / the Gospel / the grace ande faith / it has always
magnifyed the carnal man / his light ande his powers / And is become so
frenetike / that oneles it be healed by faith / it will believe nothing to be
true / but that it thinks good / neither is it possible to persuade him in
any treuth / if first declared unto him by his frenetyke reasons / it be not
conformable to his blind judgment. Conclude therefore / that Phylosophye lies
low in the dark vale of understanding / and can not lift the head to the high
ande supernatural things / in respect whereof / it is utterly blind / ande
knows not / neither by experience nor revelation / so that in it / it is
impossible to establysh the foundation of the faith. For as the feling passes
not the region of the sensible things. So likewise can nothne main reason nor
phyiosophye pass the regyon of the natural things. The natural man (as
writes Paul) understands not the things of the spirit. And because he is
not capax / that is percea^eth it not / he mocketh and scorneth it. Yea he
persecuteth / banisheth withstandeth / denies ande repugneth the miracles /
reuelatids propheties / the grace faith the holy scriptures / God / Christ and
his members. Iohe^ 10.
If they hear the Gospel preached of a faithful man / they say he is mad
/ furyous or possessed of the deuell / as was said of Christ. War. 8.
If of a learned man / they say his great study has brought him out of his
wits / which also was laid to Paul. Act. 7.
If of an ignorant / how / say they can he be learned that never studied
letters? And if of a poor wretch (as touching the world) they say to him
as was said to the boren blind man. Thou wast borne in sin / and will thou
teach me? Johan. 9
And so in effect can in no wise abide to hear the things of God. Go read
the holy scriptures / ande thou shall find that the carnal wisdom ande
humayne reason has always rebelled against God. She is the same that /
fygured by the serpent / persuaded our first parents to taste of the
prohibited apple / ande that believed not the word of God / and that
afterward taught them to excuse them selves. That made Caim to slay his
brother Abell / ande that persuaded the world in the time of Noe / that the
general diluge or floude should not come. She caused the building of the tower
of Babel. She provoked Pharao to resyst God. She induced the people of God to
murmur against him / and to worship the golden calse / and moved the Gentiles
to ydolatrie. It is that harlott that made Solomon / loose his wits / and
stirred his Father to kill Vria. And finally / she is the same that persecuted
the Patriarckes / Prophets / Apostles Martirs / and saints of the old and
new Testament. Behold whether she be a wicked fool or not that put Christ
on the cross / and where as Christ crucified is the right wisdom of God she
accounts it for a mere madness. Surely there is nothing that has so much
favored the kingdom of Antechrist as she / which has introduced all the
supersticions / Hypocrisies. Ydolatries and euelles that have been committed
under color of holiness. The faith has not had a greater ennemy then she. The
Church of Christ was a Paradise whiles the simple faith reigned. But taking in
hand the Scepter of human reason / it is become a confused Babylon. And
where as the clear / sure and infallyble faith / by giving light of the truth
/ magnifyeng Christ / his grace and the gospel / does aonichilate or bring
to naught the fleshly man / ande makes the parson simple / pure / immaculate /
virtuous and houe. The dark / blind deceitful freenetike foolish and
heretical carnal reason / wisdom and Philosophy / co^dempneth and
oppresses the truth. And to prone ande extolle the errors persecuteth /
crucifieth and burieth Christ the grace and the gospel and magnifieth the
caruall man even to the heaven. All the harlots to gether have not so much
corrupted the world as this only carnal reason / prudence and salse
Philosophy. No nor the simple ignorance has not so much co^fused the world
as the human science / wisdom and Philosophi^ / which makes men bold /
unshamefast / hoote / l^ers / proud / contencious / frenetike foolysh and
wicked. Wherefore Paul exhorted the Colossians to beware of her deceypt /
because (as God says by the Prophet Esaye) she begyleth Colos. 3.
Esaias. 47.
the parsons. For the wise or the world be the most deceived / most fools /
most wicked and most contrary to Christ. And it requires a special miracle
to convert one of the^. Read the Christian histories / and thou shall find
that those be they which evermore have been the first to persecute the Gospel.
And they are very wicked and foolish that will ground Christ upon Aristotell
/ even like unto them that will build a Tower upon a wheaten straw. Christ
and not the Philosophy is the only true fou^dacio^ of his Church and of the
true supernatural divinity of the which he is the only workmaster / and not
Aristotell. I pray the what has Aristotle to do with Christ? Many have
enforced them selves to agree Aristotle with Plato / but they could never
bring it to pass / because Aristotle beginning at the lowest of the sensible
things / ryseth in the end to as high as may be. And Plato begineth where as
Aristotle e^deth. Consider now how it is possible to agree hi^ with christ /
though many will make him a pillar of the Gospel and a ladder to clime to
heaven. Let us therefore repute the sciences of the world as vain / being like
unto the harlots / that with their flattering words and false deceipts
corrupt the minds. And let us consider that if the priests of the old
Testament were prohibited to take a comune woman for a wife / how much more
the Christian that is all wholly consecrate ande dedicate to God / ought to flee
and eschew the vain sciences and only serving him self of the^ as of most
vile handmaidens / to knitte him selue in spirit and with heart ande mind to
apply him self to that pure and immaculate virgin of the holy Theology or
divinity? To the intent that everlastingly we may render to God all laud
honor and glory / by our Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.

Sermon. iiij. How we ought to use the holy scriptures / in attaining the
knowledge of God.
THe knowledge of the holy scriptures is not enough to prove that we have
suffycient light of God / because it is possible that a man may by his pro^pte
memory attain the holy scriptures ande their interpretacions in his mind /
and by force of his natural wit / naturally understand them / and be
nevertheless for all that without faith / spirit and lively light of God. Lue:
24.
For thereto it behooves him to have the spirit and supernatural light / that
God with his favor do open and penetrate the mind by his divine grace. So
that therefore we must not account the holy scriptures for our last end / or
for our supreme Queen or Emperesse / but for means that serve to the faith /
to the spirit ande to the true knowledge of God / much more the^ the
creatures. And we ought to serve our selves of them in diverse ways / for that
they first incite and teach us to repair to God / saying / in him is the
chief bou^te / go to him / for he is faithful / and has promised to make you
taste all virtue and goodness in him. Yea. though they do not make the lively to
know God / yet work they / as the Samaritane did / that sent the Samaritanes
to Christ / who otherwise made them taste and feel that which the Samaritane
had said of him unto them / in soche wise that when they returned / they
confessed / saying we believed not at all by thy words / we our selves have
heard and know / that this is truly the savior of the world. John. 5.
And so the holy scriptures do send the to christ / to the end that he may
open thy heart / and make the i^ spirit lively to understand that which
already thou have read in the dead letter / that thou may say unto the
scriptures / we never believed by thy words / the which / being without spirit
/ could not make us taste lively the great bounte of God. It is true that by
thy words we have bee^ provoked to go to Christ / who / speaking unto us in
spite has made us to feel in the heart / a more clear / high and divine effect
of that thou have spoken. They err therefore that / fedig them selves of the
letter and not of the spyrite / do fix the^ selves in the holy s^riptures /
and seek none other light but that. Yea I say that for one hours study /
they ought to pray a thousand / and to demand of god the true understanding
of the^. And like as the Placonistes held opinion / that the sensyble things
gives us occasion to study in the book of the mind in which (they say) is
imprynted all the veryte. So must we consider that the holy scriptures do call
us to Christ / in whom (as Pause says) be hid all the treasures of wisdom
and knowledge. This is no less then true / that like as if thou had a
friend whom thou have not tried (though always thou have trauayled to prove
him) thou would not inwardely know him for a friend (though he were ever in
thine eye) because the proof has not rooted hi^ in thy mind. So albeit the
holy scriptures do call ande exhort the to seek god in spirit / it is yet
impossible that thou should find god i^ truth i^ the scriptures / if first
by spirit / thou have him not at the heart.

They serve also an other manner / that many times happens. As where God
makes the in spirit with lively faith to feale a divine truth. Afterward /
redi^g the holy scriptures / thou find that truth written that thou have so
conceived. And thereof resting contented / thou confirmest thy self in the faith
of that truth / notwithstanding that it ought to suffice the / of the first
inspiration of the holighost. And so moreover because that in Christ is the
end of the law / all the promises fulfilled and all the prophecies verified
/ the shadows / figures and scriptures of the old Testament / he that redeth
it and sees all fulfilled in christ is forced to satisfye him self of the
truth / and to establish him self in faith. Romans 10.
2. Cor. 1.
For Christ sent the Jews (that would not believe him) to the holy scriptures /
as to them that witnessed of him. Afterward / albeit that in the Church of
God / to be satisfied / grounded and establisshed in the divine / celestial
and supernatural verite / it behooves in effect to come to the inward wytnes
of the holyghoost / without whom we can not know which scriptures of god be
holy and which not. Nevertheless / after that by spirit we are assured that
our holy scriptures be of God / we ought to serve our selves of them as of a
certain infailyble and supreme outward rule to teach / reprehende / correct
and exhort the others ande to conumce the^ that speak against it. For (as
Paul writes) amongst the exteryour things we have not a more sure clear /
parfect and steadfast rule / then this / with which we ought in spyrite to rule
all our words / works / deeds and life. 2. Tmo. 3.
Tit. 1.


The holy scriptures moreover show unto us (though far of) our country. By
her we have light of God of his promises and also of his threateninges. Roma.
^^.
And they nourish in us / the faith hope / charity fear and other virtues.
They comfort us in our troubles / and in prosperity exhort us to be
temperate. They discover the vanities of the world / our miseries and the
bounty of God. And who that studieth them must of forie recyre or withdraw
him self from the worldly thoughts / and settle his mind to mortify his
vices / inordinate desires and affections. So that the study of them is very
proffitable to them that duly use it. But it behooves not to study as the
Jew (who fyxeth hi^ in the vttermust rynde of the letter / which) as Paul
says) kills / and beholding Moses with the face covered / ande not entering
into Sancta Sanctoru^ / but as the true Christian / to whom is given the
knowledge of GODS celestial Reygne or Kingdom / without parables / that with
the lively spyrite does penetrate to the lyuelie taste ande fealing of GOD in
Christ / beholding him with lively faith in the face discovered / ande entryng
into Sancta Sanctoru^ / to see with clear supernatural light / the high
resplendent secrets of God. To whom be given all laud / honor and glory by
our Savior Jesus christ. Amen.

Sermon. v. Of thinconueniences that are happened and daily happen by the abuse
of the holy Scryptures.
T The holy Scriptures of them selves be the good gifts of got and of the
holyghoost. Nevertheless they may be used of us well or evil / as by experience
it is manifest. For where as Gods elect serve the^ selves of it to Gods honor
/ the reprobate contrary wise serve the^ selves of it to his dishonor /
through their own fault and not of the scriptures In so much that in respect
of their wicked malignite it has per chance done hurt in some ways to the
world / though at length / god of his infynite bounte reduces all things to
his honor and glory. For first the scriptures and specially the holy
scriptures / have a^noied the^ who have been dilligent to gather to gether many
books / and negligent to study the^. Thi^king the^ selves fully learned when
they have had their library full of books. Other some studying / have not
attained to imprynte the truth that they found in their minds / and therefore
have written it in papers / so that / resting most ignorant / all their
learni^g co^systeth in their wrytinges / and loosing them / they also loose
their science. Which was one of the Arguments that caused Plato to co^dempne
lettres / saying that before scripture was found / the men were much better
learned then sense / because they were forced to write in their minds that
that afterward they have written in paper. I pass over that many have
consumed their time in the dishonor of god / in readi^g and writing of things
curious ande pernicious to the health. And that many transported of Curiosyte
/ have willed to see so many books that in the end they remained confused
without fruit. As does the field whereon they cast ouermoch seed. And of some
that by those means have lost their wits. But that which imports much
more is that they think the true knowledge of Theology or divinity consists
in lettres / which is utterly false / because they give not true and lively
light of the supernatural thiges that can not otherwise be known of us but by
spyrite / revelation / faith spiritual taste / lively understanding and sure
experience. For like as the Philosopher without experience can have no
knowledge although he bear in mind all that is written / ande nor having
practysed / he must rest only in opynion grounded upon Aristotle / Plato and
the other Philosophers / which moves him to believe their writing to be true /
being nevertheless in very deed more ignorant then is the poor paisaunt or
husbandman / that by laboring of the Earth / without sekinge lettres / fyndeth
the operacion of many natural things / that proves his science to be somwat
and theirs none / though well they study for ever and want experye^ce. So
likewise one simple ydeote without learning / if he have faith / lively taste /
and spiritual understanding of God / is a greater divine then all the learned
men of the world that be without spirit. Yea he is a divine ande they none.
For that of the heavenly supernatural things he knows so much as he tastes
/ and exper^n^ateth by faith (...) the learned man has only a barraine / y^le
cold and d^ade opinto^ which stands without faith in desperacio^ /
accompained of every vice. Now therefore it appears that of this error / by
thiking that true Theology or divinity consists in learning / there are
innuaerable inconueme^ces growe^ / and chefely that many / wanti^g letters /
and not having time to study / thinking that by other wares it is impossible
to become divines / have not disposed them selves to demand of God with meke
heart ande fervent desires: light of the divine things. And moreover they
have fled ande withdrawn them selves from the intelly gence or understanding
of the holy scriptures / as from a terrible ruin / because their wise learned
and holy men have persuaded them that no man may understand it but they onthe
that are learned. Conde^pning them that write in the vulgar tongue / as if the
true divinity depended of the Hebrew Greek or Latin lettres / or of that wit
that has well studied them. Behold now therefore whether this be not a most
raw and wicked opinion / beig the very cause that has moved me thus to write
i^ my natural tongue to thinte^t that (knowing the true Theology to be open to
every langdage and to the simple) our own nation should not be private / who
have none other but the mother tongue. There be many that / studying the holy
scriptures without spirit / lively faith and supernarall light / have not
only not attained the true knowledge of the bounty of God and their own
propre miseries / but the more they have studied / the more / by the dry and
dead letter / they are become blind of God and of them selves. Yea
unfaithful / unkind / proud arrogau^t presumptuous contentious ande repleate
of all other byces. Where as the supernatural true Theology or divinity
stewing the great bounte of God / and declaryng in our selves our own myseries
makes us faithful / thankful / just / humble / modest / gentle / quiet and
conformable.

And moreover they be so blind that not knowing their own wretchedness / they
not only forbear to humble the^ selves before God / and of him heartily to
demand help light and grace / but also leaving prayer for their study / and
the spirit for their learnig / they presume to be masters of the others as
Paul writes / ande so inflambed of their science / have staundered the world
where as charity edifieth. Romans 2.
And being consequently without spyryte / they study and understand the holy
scriptures according to their own judgments / diversely as their wits and
study are varyable / and every one according to his fantasye expounds them /
thynkyng he has perfectly and justly conceived them / Whereof are grown
infynite sects ande herespes. 2. Cor. 8.
In stead of that / if they had bee^ good and true divines and had had the
spirit of Gods gift / they had understand the^ in treuth and verite / whereof
follows none other but union of faith both in spyryte and charity.

Many also believing by the study of the holy scriptures / to attain true
Theologye and parfect knowledge of God ande consequently the chief felycyte
possible to the living man / have given them selves to study the scriptures /
and walkinge by them to join to the supreme faelicite of Gods knowledge /
because they wanted the spirit / they neither can arryve at the true ande
lyvely light / taste and spiritual understanding of God nor yet to the true
felicite. Where of it grows that they fall to the botome of infidelyte / in
such wise / that they believe that there is none other light / faith or
divinity then that their barreine and dead opinion / nor other felyeire then
that their myserye / and so / seming to have attained the height of virtues /
before they have ones tasted of them / they disprayse them. These and soche
other inconveniences are grown ande continual lie grow through them that
know not how they ought to use the holy scriptures in soche wise / that by
their default / ande not of the scriptures / they have perchance done hurt to
the world. But for that we ought not to co^dempne the letters (as many have
done) but the men that know not to use them as they should be used to the
honor of God. To whom be all honor and glory by our savior Jesus christ.

Sermon. vj. If to be good divines it behoue us to have the human sciences
or not.
THere be many that think it is not possible to attain the perfection of
Theology / if first a man learn not Gra^mer / Dialec: ica / Philosophy and
metaphisica / Yea Scotus Thomas bonauenture ande soche other. I confess my
self to have been in that error and therefore am now moved to compassion of
them that rest blinded withal. If it were as they say / we should be most
bounden unto the inuentours of those sciences / syns that by them we may be
good divines / and without the^ not. And then I pray you if they happened to
perish or those aucthours to be lost should it not follow that also the world
should lack divinity? And likewise if the learned men in those sciences be
only the good diuins and consequently Saints (the contrary whereof is clearly
seen) then might well the simple ande unlearned people despair of all ghoostly
health / and the true and necessary divinity hang upon human sciences. So
by that reason it should behoue us to say that the Apostles and in manner all
the saints / Yea and the blessed virgin Marie wear not good divines /
notwithstanding that they have taught others. No nor Christ never learned those
humayne sciences / and yet was he the most excellent divine. Johan. 7.
Therefore we must know that one human science leads us to clyme to an
other / much unworthy of the name of Theology or divinity / but rather to be
called Metaphisica / the which neither has nor geveth so much light of God as
can suffyse to our salvation / being a knowledge / that by force of man's
wit / eliming the degrees of human reason / may be attained. Where as the
true ande supernatural Theology or divinity is a science of the spirit / a
gift ande light that by grace comes from God above / in soche wise / that
not he that has the pregnau^t wit / has most studied and is best learned
/ is greatest divine / but he that has faith / lively light and understanding
of God / that lives better and more christianly. Ephe. 2.
And because faith is a gift of God / and the true divinity a supernatural
light / not attaynable or can not be attained of us / but given of God to his
Elect. Therefore every simple. Yoeote and ignorant of the human sciences /
may by the grace of god / suddenly become a parfect divine and christian / as
in the acts of the Apostles it is read of the Eunucho. Act. 8.
It is possible the^ / that a simple old woman may have more of the true
Theology or divinity / then all the learned men of the world. For the human
sciences do fill our minds of smoke and pride / and occupy them in soche
wise (that distracte with Marta) they be not attentive with Marie to receive
the knowledge of God. It is seen by experience that rather and more lightly the
simple have accepted the Gospel the^ the learned me^ of the world. Yea where
the simple / the ydeotes / the little children ande the Samaritanes magnified
Christ / the learned scribes and Phariseis persecuted him even to the death of
the cross. Ande when the world conuerteth / seldom the learned men come to
the faith / but have been ever the last. There could none enter into Sancta
Sanctorum by tholde law / but the high Bishop. But Christ dying on the
cross / has overthrown the veil of the temple / so that the resple^dent
treasures of Gods wisdom hid i^ christ Col. 2.
are manifested so openly / that the simple and ydeotes / yea the publicanes
and comune women have understood them. Whereof David speaks saying Thy
words be open / they lyghten and give understanding to the litleones. Psalm.
118.
That high and divine wisdom is become so low and open in Christ / that
every simple may understand. For that Christ is not come as an human man to
teach us letters but is divinely and spiritually descended to kindle the
spirit / light charity and grace in the hearts of his elect / ande so has he
made them to understand / even to the Children which magnify him / saying
Blessed is he that is come in the name of the lord. Math. 21.
And Christ reproved his Apostles when they let the Childeren of coming to
him / though now their be many that will Luke 18.
not allow the holy scriptures to be had in the vulgar tongue / nor read
and declared to the simple / as if they could not understand them / nor were
not bound to know that which is contained in them. And yet it is certain /
they contain none other but proffytable and necessary things to the health /
and that being of the holyghoost / those divine verities be in manner so
expressed / that in what tongue soever it be written / so it be truly declared
/ and with pure heart heard and understand / they must needs edify without
offendig. Christ thanking his father / said unto him. Wath. 11.
I praise the (father and lord of heaven and earth) that thou have hid these
things from the wise and prudent / ande opened the^ unto babes / not for that
they have studied / but because it has so pleased the. Jeremy. 3.
In this is fulfilled that that God promised by his prophet Jeremy / that even
to the least of all they should know. Now behold if they be blind or not /
that will build the true Theology upon Philosophy / and upon the human
sciences: where as christ is the true fondacio^ / and upon him it behooves to
build / not wood straw or hay / but silver gold and precious stones / that
is to say / not the inuencions of man / but the only true reuelacions of God.
Sainet Johan Baptist / and not Aristotle / was the precursor or foreru^ner of
Christ. It is not possible with the light of a little burning candell to augment
the great light of the Son and likewise Christ can not be clarified by the
humayne sciences. John. 5.
He him self says that he has taken his beaulte / not of men but of his
father / who said unto hi. John. 13.
And the I have glorified / and the I shall glorify. And will thou then that
Christ / which is the light of the world / should have node of the light of
Aristotle? Johan. 1.
That their dry / cold and dead Theology serves to make them proud / to
presume of them selves / to contend and to deceive the blind ignorant people
with persuading them falsely to repute them for divines / yea and to begile
them selves / that albeit that they be darkness in deed / yet they think them
selves to be the light of the world / ande therefore humble not their hearts to
pray unto God to give them light. I will not say that we ca^ not serve our
selves of all the human sciences in the honor of God / yea and of our sins
/ in asmoch as of them we may take occasyon of virtue. But I say in deed that
they be not necessary to make us good divines. For to that it behooves a
supernatural light of God / with clennes and purite of heart. And this light
we ought evermore to demand of God with fervent prayer / we ought also to
seek the hearing of Gods word / and with humilite to exercise our selves in
studying the holy scriptures / to the intent / that as true and good divines /
we may render unto God all honor and glory by our savior Jesus Christ. Amen.

Finis.
