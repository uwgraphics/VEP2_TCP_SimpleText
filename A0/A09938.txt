In the time of Gods visitation by Sickness, or Mortality especially, may be
used by Governors of Families
First, A Confession of sins.
O Eternal, Almighty, and just God, merciful, loving, and holy Father, we
thy humble servants humbly confess and acknowledge here in thy presence, that
all the imaginations of the thoughts of our hearts are only evil continually,
yea every man in his best estate is altogether vanity. And we (dust and ashes)
have grievously sinned, we have transgressed thine holy laws and ordinances,
we have exceeded in measure, number and weight, the iniquities of our
forefathers, and have thereby justly deserved that thou should in thy just
judgment have drawn forth the sword of thy justice, and executed vengeance,
even in the highest degree against us, according to the measure, number and
weight of our manifold sins and heinous iniquities, we are not worthy of the
least of all thy mercies. We humbly also confess and acknowledge (even
against our selves) that neither thousands of Rams, nor ten thousand rivers
of oil (if we were able and willing to yield them unto thee) are sufficient to
satisfy thy justice for the least of the iniquities which we have committed
against thee, if thou should turn thine eye of mercy and compassion away
from us; and these things heretofore we confessed (O Lord) but our lives we
amended not. And yet notwithstanding (O merciful Lord, holy and loving Father)
so great is thy loving kindness toward us, and so manifold are thy mercies,
that thou (of thy favor) have been pleased (even in pity and compassion for
thine own sake, without any desert of ours) to pacify thine own wrath, by a
few light and easy strokes with thy rod of correction, and so for a time to
cease thine anger, to try us if we would seek after thee, not suffering thy
punishing Angel to pass through Jerusalem and Judea, London, and other these
dominions, with a swift course and heavy hand, as in the days of King David.
And (finding us a rebellious and stiff-necked people) have sent out thine Angel
to threaten and execute vengeance in greater weight, and in greater measure
against us, if we will not amend. And yet in favor stayest from executing thy
fierce wrath. What shall we then offer unto thee (O Lord our God) for all the
blessings which we have reciued from thee? Thou have no need to receive of us,
all beasts, all cattle, all sheep on mountains; yea the earth is thine, and
all that therein is, the world, and they that dwell therein, we our selves, and
all that we have are thine, what have we that we have not received of thee? We
confess (O Lord) even against our selves, that we have nothing to offer but
the calves of polluted lips, proceeding from unclean and uncircumcised
hearts, that is, praise, thanks, and prayer, and the same (if thou should
consider them as they are ours) very full of vanities and corruptions.

Secondly, A thanksgiving for deliverances.
SVch as we have (yet) O merciful father, we (more humbly and more freely, and
heartily, then heretofore) offer unto thy Majesty. We praise thy holy, great
and glorious name, and we yield unto thee humble and hearty thanks for thy
great and wonderful deliverances; deliverances from pestilence, famine, and
sword, heretofore worthily threatened against us, and for other thy manifold
favors and blessings bountifully bestowed upon this City, and upon this Land,
and (now especially Lord) for thy great mercy, in that thou art pleased, even
now at this present, once again to touch the people of this Land for their
trial, with thy loving rod of fatherly correction, rather then in justice to
power out the violls of thy wrath, utterly to consume us for our
unthankfulness and disobedience.

Thirdly, A Prayer for continuance of Gods mercies.
ANd we humbly and heartily pray thee (O Lord) even for thine own names sake,
and for thy Son our Savior Jesus Christ's sake, lay not to our charge our
offenses past, forgive us our iniquities, cover our sins, and impute them not
unto us, and then we shall be blessed. Purge, frame, and form our hearts
anew; soften them, and make them repentant and obedient, willing freely without
backe-sliding or halting to yield obedience unto that spirit which says:
Give me the heart; deliver us also (holy Father) not only from perishing by
waters, according to thy merciful and gracious promise made of old, but also
from that abundance of waters, which may kill, hurt and hinder, the seed or
fruits of the earth, and give us holy Father (as graciously in great mercy
thou have given us) only that former and that latter rain, commended in thy
holy word, and other seasonable and temperate weather, which may yield unto the
good seed of the ground, as now, so hereafter, (by thy blessing) in times
convenient life, growth and increase, so as we may by thy gracious favor, as
this year, so others also, at length reap the fruits of plentiful haruests:
And because so it is (Lord) that thou make a land barren for the wickedness
of them that dwell therein, change thou our hearts (we humbly beseech thee)
root out the wickedness from the hearts of the inhabitants of the land, and
then we shall be sure that the land shall yield her increase. Give us O Lord
thy grace and holy spirit, to guide and govern us, and to hold us within the
lists and limits of thy holy precepts and ordinances, in such sort, as that we
may for ever hereafter, use thy word as the only wise, and all-sufficient rule
to square our lines by, knowing that all unwritten verities, and all
traditions, and inventions of men, yea all the imaginations of the thoughts of
our hearts are only evil continually; let thy word be a lantern to our
feet, and a light unto our paths, knowing that therein is the true Kings
highway to be found, that leads to everlasting life and salvation, and that
all other ways which have not warrant from thence (if thou shall in judgment
look into them) will be found to be but bypath, leading to eternal death
and destruction. Give us (O Lord) a holy and earnest desire, often to hear thy
holy and heavenly word: give us wise, understanding, faithful and obedient
hearts, that we may truly understand, and faithfully believe; and may (not for
fear, or fashion, or for any other worldly respect whatsoever, but in a true
obedience for conscience sake) fruitfully practice in our lives and
conuersations thine holy statutes and ordinances. Continue thy grace, mercy,
and accustomed loving kindness (O Lord we beseech thee for thine own names
sake, and for thy Son our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ's sake) unto King
James our blessed David, and unto the Queen, and the Prince his son, and to
all his royal progeny. And grant (if it be thy good pleasure) that he may
attain to the years of the eldest of his Fathers, in the days of their
Pilgrimage, set up his seed after him (Lord we beseech thee) and stablish the
throne of his Kingdom in his posterity in all ages, so as there may not want
a man of his seed to sit upon his throne, to feed people in Jacob, and thine
inheritance in Israel, so long as the heaven and the earth endure. Be merciful
also unto all Israel, Jerusalem, and Judea, London, and all the Kings
Dominions; and to the Magistrates and Ministers of thy holy word and
sacraments. In their several degrees, dignities, and callings, give them (O
Lord we beseech thee) a true love and zeal of the execution of thy holy laws,
that they may (according to thine own appointments) faithfully, dilligently,
and with a religious care and conscience, of the advancement of the glorious
gospel of thy Son our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, discharge that great
charge and weighty burden which thou have laid upon them: and stop the entry
and passage (O Lord) both to Magistracy and Ministry, so as neither ravening
wolves deuourers, nor wily foxes deceivers of thy stock, nor any others, but
such only as thou know to be furnished with gifts fit for the discharge of
those great and weighty callings, be suffered to enter or pass thereunto. We
use means (O Lord) to preserve health, and to avoid and expulse infection:
But we depend not upon them, we trust not in them, we humbly confess, that no
good success, no blessing, can come but from thee, and by thee alone: and
therefore we humbly and heartily pray thee to give success, and to yield thy
blessing thereunto, and to say once again to thine Angel, Hold now thy hand.
More particularly (O holy Father) continue also (we beseech thee) thy mercy and
loving kindness to the little flock within this house, and to thy humble and
unworthy servant whom thou (of thy favor) have appointed to be ouerseer
thereof, and give unto them thy grace in such measure that they may so walk
every of them in their several places and callings, as may be agreeable to thy
holy and blessed will, through Jesus Christ our Lord and only Savior. In whose
name we humbly further pray unto thee for these and all other things which
thou in thy wisdom know to be most meet for us, and for thy whole Church,
in that form of prayer which he himself has taught us. Our Father which art
in heaven, etc.
