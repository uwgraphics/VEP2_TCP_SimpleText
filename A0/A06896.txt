(...) Of god and man but with out p^^itence
And confession with fylth and v^
Of dedely synnys presumyth to accede
Un to the holy mysterise in deed
He etith and drynkith his dome to him for sothe
^che dedely sinner that cursidly so does
But we therefore that many day before
with confession of our sins soore
with penitence are chastysid and made thynne
with lean lent and fast ageyn our sin
with alms doing and bitter teris weeping
And fro sins sluggye and fro slepyng
Are cleney wasshe with outyn foul enfection
Than in the day of holy resurrection
Of our lord we to his board accede
In feyth catholic with flessh and blood us feed
Of the vnspottyd lamb of crist jesus
Not un to dome but to encrese of virtue
we it teceyue to remission of sin
Finally the bliss of heuyn to win
That is callid helthfull beatitude
It for to take with the hoole multitude
Of joy and bliss to all our reparation
we take this fest as to our preparation
And thus my friends it nedith you to do
These textis and resons for to consent un to
when this people in general had perceyuid
The qwenys words and specially co^ceyuid
These textis holy and true exposition
Her wise words of true humble condition
They could answer in no manner wise
For ripe sentence with wordis ware and wise
But when they knew the chirchis institution^
From thens forward to thexecutions
Of holy chirchis rite and governance
They took to them this gentil obseruaunce
In parceyuing of this helthful mystery
And kept it forth with conscience good and merry
Preterea in aliquibus locis. etc.
ANd in scotland also in diverse places
Men there were I trow for lakke of graces
Ageyn holy chirchis co^suetude
That vsid to sey myss that people rude
with out the chirchis powere and license
Abhoiable was this insolence
The which mysse use this blessid holy qwene
In that error in no wise would sustene
In goddis cause she set her heart on fire
with all her study it was her hole desire
For to destroy and bring to nowght yt rite
That after ward none durst in soil no^ site
So presume or of that fecte appear
In all the land of scotts ferr ne new
Also they vsid ayens the reverence
Of holy sunday ageyn cristys co^placence
In servile works to be laborious
But the qwene devout and virtuous
She wyd their defaut by autorite
And by reason to each in his degree
Seyeng thus that cristes holy day
which is sunday was ordeynyd this is no nay
For cristes high blessid resurrection
That every christian man should have affection
It to have in laud and veneration
That we should do no werk nor operation
That were servile for fro seruilite
Of the fend his bondage and pooste
we were bought as well we knowyn all
Thus are we fre after that we were thralle
That day we should be devout and holy
Keeping us fro nycete sin and folly
This affermyth the pope saint gregory
where he seyth thus in his devout story
In the sunday no man put him in prease
Fro servile works but fro that labowr cease
Insist to prayer in all manner wise
In gostly labor should he so devise
That if owght of vice and insolence
By six days before of necligence
In the hole weke it happynyd to be done
That in sunday that comes after sone
Of cristis risyng should be expiation
Clean by praieres in gostly consolation
And saint Gregor the pope and holy clerk
A certain man for an erthly werk
Done on sunday espied in probation
He smote with cursyng and strait increpation
with heart blamyng and them that him also
So conseylid and styrid him there to
He Iugid them for to be denouncid
By.ii. month is cursid it was pronouncid
In opyn chirch this was his decre
Til it was correct it would no other be
when the resons of the qwene devout
well autorisid were thus brought about
They were co^cludid and cowd not ageyn say
But that they must keep holy the sunday
Fro werk servile and so they did in deed
Fro thens forward the better for to speed
And forther more unlawful marriages
Of stepmodres had yey in vsages
And that a man should wedde his brotheris wife
Aftir that he was passid fro this life
These were used and therefore the qwene
These cursid uses she could not sustene
And said that all feythful people must
Her cursid use for sakyn and her lust
And as death such marriage escheu
And to good use conform them in virtue
And in that land were many things mo
Of wikkid rite and cursid use also
Ageyn the chirchis goodely ordynance
which in that counsel by her governance
were adnullyd da^puyd and cassate
And fro thoo bowndes fully extirpate
Out of the realm by her providence
Such was her wit prudence and sapiens
Explicit sctha distinctio and incipit tertia
Cum enim de salute. etc.

ALso more over when she of souls health
And wisdom spoke and of gostly wealth
