Here begins the temple of Glass.


Through co^streynt and greuons heuines
For pensyfnes and high dystres
To bed I went now this other night
When yt Lucyna with her pale light
Was Joined last with phoebus in aquarye
Amyd Decembre when of Ianuarye
There be kalendes of the new year
And derke dyane horned and no thing clear
Had her beams under a mysty cloud
Within my bed for cold I began me shroude
All desolate for constreynt of my won
The long night walowynge to and fro
Till at last or I began take keep
Me did oppress a sodeyn deedly sleep
Within the which me thought I was
Rauysshed in spyryte in to Temple of glass
I ne wyste how far in wyldernes
That founded was all by lyclynes
Not upon stele / but on a craggy roche
Like yse Ifrore / and as I did approach
Again the son that shone so clear
As any crystal and ever nere and nere
As I began nyghe this grysly dredefull place
I wext astonyed the light so in my face
Began to smite so passing ever in one
On every part where that I gone
That I ne might no thing as I would
About me consydere and behold
The wonder esters for bryghtnes of the son
Till at last certain skies done
With wind chased than her course I went
Tofore the stremes of Tytan and I blent
So that I might within and without
Where so I would behold me about
For to report the facyon and manner
Of all this place that was cyrculer
I compass wise / round by entayle wrought
And when I had long and sought
I found a wycket and entered in as fast
In to the temple and mine eyes cast
On every side now low and now efte alofte
And right anon as I began walk soft
If I the sothe a right report shall
I saw depaynted upon a wall
From est to west many a fair image
Of sundry lovers like as they were of aege
Isette in order after they were true
With lyfly colors wonder fresshe of heme
And as me thought I saw some sit and some stand
And some knelynge with bylles in their hand
And some with complaynt woeful and pyteous
With doleful chere to put to Venus
So as she sat fletynge in the sea
Upon their woe for to have pity
And first of all I saw there of cartage
Dido the queen so goodly of vysage
That began complain her adventure and caas
How the deceived was of Eneas
For all his hestes and his oaths sworn
And said alas that ever she was borne
When she saw that deed she must be
And next her I saw the complaynt of Medee
How that she falsed was of Jason
And nyghe by venus saw I sytte Atheon
And all the manner how the bore him sloughe
For whom she wept and had pyne enough
There saw I also how that Penelope
For she so long her lord ne might se
Was of color both pale and grene
And alther next was the fresshe queen
I mean Alcest the noble true wife
And for admete how she lost her life
And for her thrughe if I shall not lie
How she was turned into a daysye
There was Grysyldes Innocence
And all her mekenes and pacyence
There was eke Isoude and many other moo
And all the torment and the cruel woo
That she had for Trystram all her lyve
And how that Tysbe her heart did ryue
With thylke sword of sir Pyramus
And all the manner how that Theseus
The mynotaure slow amyd the house
That was forwrynked by craft of dedalus
What he was in prison shyt in crete
And how that phylles felt of loved hete
The great fire of demephon alas
And for his falshed and for his trespass
Upon the walls depeynt men might se
Now she henge upon a fylberde tree
And many a story mo than I reken can
Were in the temple and how that paris wan
The fair Eleyne a lusty fresshe queen
And how achylles was for Polycene
Islayne vnwardly within troy town
All this saw I walking up and down
There saw I written eke the hole tale
How Phylomene in to a nyghtyngale
I turned was / and proygne unto a swalowe
And how the sabynes in their manner halowe
The feast of Lucresse yet in Rome town
There saw I also the sorrow of Palamone
That he in prison felt and all the smerte
And how that he thrughe unto his heart
Was hurt in wardly by casting of an eye
On the fair fresshe and lust young Emelye
And all the strife between him and his brother
And how that one faught with that other
Within the grove till they by Theseus
Accorded were as Chaucer tells us
And ferthermore as I began behold
I saw how Phoebus with an arowe of gold
I wounded was through out his side
Only by envy of the god Cupyde
And how that Dyane unto a laurer tree
I turned was when that she did fle
And how that Jove began to change his cope
Only for love of the fair Europe
And into a bull / when he did her sue
List of his godhede his form to transmewe
And how that he by transmutacyon
The shap began take of Amphytryon
For alcumena so passing was of beauty
So was he hurt for all his deyte
With loves darte and might it not escape
There saw I also how Mars was take
Of Uulcanus and with Uenus found
And with the cheynes Inusyble bound
There was also all the poesye
Of him Mercurye and all the Phylogye
And how that she for her sapyence
I wedded was to the god of eloquence
And how the Muses lowly did obey
Hye in to heaven this lady to conueye
And with her song how she was magnefyed
With Iupyter there to be stellefyed
And vppermore depaynt men might se
How with her ring the goodly Canace
Of every foul the laydous and song
Could understand as she walked them among
And how her brother so often helped was
In his myscheyf by the stead of bras
And ferthermore in the temple were
Full many a thousand lovers here and there
Is sundry wise ready to complain
Unto the goddess of their woo and pain
How they were hyndred some for envy
And how the serpent of false Jalousye
Full many a lover has put a back
And causeles on them have laid a lache
And some there were that playned on abscence.
That were exyled and put out of presence
Through wicked tongues and falls suspeccyon
Without mercy or any remyssyon
And other also their seruyse spent in vayn
And of their lady were not loved again
And also other that for pouerte
Durst in no wise their great aduersyte
Dyscouere ne open / lest they were refused
And some for wantynge also were accused
And also other that loved secretly
And of her lady durst axe no mercy
Leest that she would of him have despyte
And some also that put right great wit
On double lovers that love things new
Through whose falsenes hyndred be the true
And some there were as it is often found
That for their lady many a blody wound
Endured has in many a regyon
Whiles that an other has had possessyon
All of his lady and bears a way the fruit
Of his labor and of all his suyte
And other complained of Richesse
How he with tresour does his business
To win against all kind and right
Where as true lovers have no force ne might
And some there were as maidens young of aege
That plain so with pypynge and with rage
That were coupled again all nature
With crooked old that may not long endure
For to perform the lust of loves play
For it ne sit not unto fresshe may
For to be coupled to old Ianuarye
They be so diverse that they must varye
For old is grutchynge and malencolyous
Always full of Ire and suspeccyous
And youth entendeth to Joye and lustynes
To mirth and play and to all gladness
Alas that ever it should fall
So sweet sugre ycoupled to be galle
These young folk cried often sithe
And prayed Uenus her power to kythe
Upon this myscheyf and shape remedy
And right anon I herd other cry
With sobbing teres and pyetous sown
To fore the goddess by lamentacyon
That were constreyned in their youth
And in chyldhode as is often a couthe
I entered were in to relygyon
Or they had years of dyscrecyon
That all her life can not but complain
In wide copes perfeccyon or to feign
Full covertly for to cover their smerte
And show the contrary of their heart
Thus saw I where many a fair maid
That on their friends all the wit they laid
And other next I saw there in great rage
That they were married in their tender aege
Without fredome of fre eleccyon
Where love has selde domynacyon
For love at large and at lyberte
Would freely chese and not with such trete
And other saw I full often weep and wrynge
That they in men found such varyenge
To love a season while that beaulte floureth
And after by dysdayne so ungoodly loureth
On her yt sometime he called his lady dear
That was to him so pleasant and entyere
But lust with fayrnes is so over gone
That in her heart troth abides none
And some also I saw in teres reyne
And pyteously on god and kind pleyne
That ever they would on any creature
So much beauty passing by mesure
Set on a womnn to give occasyon
A man to love to his confusyon
And namely there where he shall have no grace
For with a look forth by as he does pace
Full often falls casting of an eye
A man is wounded that he must needs deye
That never perauenture after he shall her se
Why will god do so great a cruelte
To any man or to his creature
To make him so much woo endure
For her percas whom he shall in no wise
Rejoice never / but so forth in Juyse
Led his life till that he be in his grave
For he ne durst of her no mercy crave
And also perauenture though he durst and would.
He can not wit where he her find should
I saw there also / and thereof had I routhe
That some were hyndred by couetyse and slouthe
And some also for their hastynes
And other also for their rechelesnes
But at the last as I walked and beheld
Beside pallas with her crystal shield
Tofore the statute of Uenus set on heyght
There kneled a lady in my sight
Tofore the goddess which as the sonn^e
Passes the sterres and also the storm
And Lucyfer to void the nyghtes sorrow
I clerenes passes erly the morrow
And so as May has the soueraynte
Of every month the fayrnes and beauty
And as the rose in swetnes and odor
Surmounteth flowers and bawme of all lycour
Has the pryse and as the rubye bright
Of all stones in beauty and in sight
As it is know has the Regalye
Right so this lady with her goodly eye
And with the stremes of her look so bright
Surmounteth all through beauty in my sight
That for to tell her great semelynes
Her womanhede her port and her fayrnes
It was a marvel how ever that nature
Could in her works make a creature
So angelyk so goodly one to see
So femynyn or passing of beauty
Whose sonnysshe here bryghter than gold wyre
Like Phoebus beams shynyuge in his spyre
The goodlyhed also if her fresshe face
So replenysshed of beauty and of grace
So well ennewed by nature and depaynt
As rose and lylyes together were meynt
So egally by good proporcyon
That as me thought by mine inspeccyon
I began meruaylle how god or work of kind
Might of beauty such a tresour find
To give her so passing excellence
For in good faith through her hye presence
The temple was enlumyned enuyron
And for to speak of her condycyon
She was the best that might be on live
For there was none yt with her might strive
To speak of bounte or of gentylnesse
Of womanhede or of lowlynesse
Of curtesye or of goodlyhede
Of speech of chere or of semelyphede
Of port benygne or of dalyaunce
The best taught thereto of pleasaunce
She was the well also of honest
An exampler and myrrour also was she
Of secretnes of troth of faythfulnes
And to all other lady and maystres
To show virtue who so list to lere
And so this lady right humble of chere
Knelynge I saw clad in grene and white
Tofore Uenus goddess of all delight
Enbrowded all with stones and perre
So rychely that Joye it was to se
With sundry rolls on her garnement
For texpowne the troth of her intent
To show fully that for her humblesse
And for her virtue and her stablenesse
That she was rote of all womanly pleasaunce
Therefore her word without varyaunce
Enbrowded as men might see
De mieulx en mieulx with stones of perre
This is to say that she was so benygne
From better to better her heart does resygne
And all her will to venus the goddess
When that her list her harms to redress
For as me thought some what by her chere
For to complain she had great desire
For in her hand she held a little bylle
For to declare the so^me of all her skylle
And to the goddess her quarrel for to show
Theffecte of which was in words few
The copye of the supplycacyon
O lady Uenus mother of cupyde
That all this world have in governance
And hertes hye that hawten by pride
Enclynest mekely to thine obeyssaunce
Cauler of Joye Relees of penance
And with thy stremes can every thing dyscerne
Thrughe heavenly fire of love that is eterne
O blesfull sterre persaunt and full of light
Of beams gladsom deuoyder of derkenes
Cheyf recomforte after the black night
To void woeful hertes out of their heaviness
Take now good head lady and goddess
So that my byll may your grace atteyne
Redress to find of that I me complain
For I am bound to thing that I nolde
Freely to chese there lack I lyberte
And so I want of that mine heart would
The body is knyt / though my thought be free
So that I must of necessyte
My hertes list outward contrary
Though we be one the deed must vary
My worship save I fail eleccyon
Again all right both of god and kind
Thereto be knyt under subieccyon
Fro whens far both are out of mind
My thought gooth forth my body is behind
For I am here / and yonder my remembrance.
Between two so hang I in balance
Deuoyde of Joye / of woo I have plente
What I desire that may I not possede
For that I nolde is ready ay to me
And that I love / for to sue I dread
To my desire contrary is my mede
And thus I stand departed in tweyne
Of will and deed ylaced in a cheyne
For though I brenne with feruente and hete
Within mine heart I may complain of cold
And by excess though I swelte and sweet
Me to complain god wot I am not bold
Unto ne wight nor one word unfold
Of all my pain alas the hard stounde
The hoter that I brenne ye colder is my wound
For he that has mine heart faithfully
And hole my love in all honest
Without change all be it secretly
Unto theffecte and complaynt of my byll
Sith life and death I put all in thy will
And tho me thought the goddess did enclyne.
Mekely her heed and softly began express
That in short time her torment should fine
And how of him for whom all her dystresse
Continued had and all her heaviness
She should have Joye and of her purgatory
Be helped sone and so live forth in glory
And said daughter for thy sad troth
Thy faithful menynge and Innocence
That planted be withouten any sloth
In your person deuoyde of all offense
So than atteyned to our audyence
That with our grace ye shall be well releuyd
I you behete of all that has you greuyd
And for that ye be ever of one entente
Without chance or mutabylyte
And in your pains ben so pacyent
To take lowly your aduersyte
And that so long through the cruelte
Of old Saturn my fader vnfortuned
And think therwithin a little while
It shalll aswage and over pass soon
For men by layser pass many a mile
And often after a drepynge moan
The weder clereth and when the storm is done
The son shyneth in his spyre bright
And Joy waketh when woo is put to flight
Remember eke how never yet no wight
Ne came to worship without debate
And folk rejoice also more of light
That they with derkenes were waped and wate
No man's chance is always fortunate
Ne no wight prayseth of sugre the swetnes
But they tofore have tasted bytternes
Grysylde was asayed at full
That turned after the encrese of Joye
Penelope began eke for sorrows dull
For that her lord abode so long at Troy
Also the torment there could no man accoye
Of dorygene flour of all Bretayne
Thus ever Joye is fine and end of pain
And trusts this for conclusyon
The end of sorrow is Joy void of dread
For holy saints through their passion
Have heaven won by their sovereign mede
And plente gladly followed after need
And so my daughter after your greuaunce
I you behote ye shall have full plesaunce
For ever of love the manner and the gyse
Is for to hurt his servant and to wound
And when he has taught them his empryse
He can in no Joy make them to habounde
And sith that ye have in my lase be bound
Without grutchynge or rebellyon
Ye must of right have consolacyon
This is to said dowte it never a dele
That ye shall have full possessyon
Of him that ye now cherysshe so well
In honest manner without offencyon
By cause I know your entencyon
Is truly set in party and in all
To love him best and most in special
For he that ye have chosen you to serve
Shall be to you such as ye desire
Without change fully till he sterue
So with my bronde I have set him a fire
And with my grace I shall him enspyre
That he in heart shall be right at your will
Whether ye list to save him or to spyll
For unto you I shall his heart so low
Without spotte of any doubleness
That he ne shall escape from the bow
Though that himself by unsteadfastness
I mean of cupyde that shall him so dystresse
Unto your hand with the arowe of gold
That he ne shall escape though he would
And sith ye list of pity and of grace
In virtue only his youth to cherysshe
I shall by aspecte of my benygne face
Make him to show every syune and vice
So that he shall have no manner spyce
In his courage to love things new
He shall to you so plain be found and true
And when this goodly fair fresshe of hue
Humble and benygne of troth crop and rote
Conceived had how Uenus began to rewe
On her prayer plainly to do bote
To change her bitter at ones in to sweet
She fell on knees of high devotion
And in this wise began her oryson
Highest of hye queen and Empres
Goddess of love of good yet the best
That through your beauty without vice
Sometime conquered the apple at feast
That Jupiter through his hye request
To all the gods above celestyall
Made in his palace most Imperyall
To you my lady vpholder of my life
Mekely I thank so as I may suffyse
That ye list now with heart ententyf
So gracyously for me to deuyse
That live while with humble sacrefyse
Upon your awters your feast year by year
I shall encence cast in to the fire
For of your grace I am full reconsyled
From every trouble unto Joye and ease
That sorrows all be from me exyled
Sith ye my lady list to appease
My pains old and fully my disease
Unto gladness so suddenly to torn
Having no cause from hens forth to morn
For sythen ye so mekely list to daunte
To my seruyse him that loves me best
And of your bounte so gracyously to grant
That he ne shall varye though him list
Whereof my heart is fully brought to rest
For now and ever o lady my benygne
That heart and will I holy to you resygne
Thanking you with all my full heart
That of your grace and vysytacyon
So humbly list him to co^uerte
Fully be at my subieccyon
Without change or transmutacyon
Unto his last now laud and reverence
Be to your name and excellence
This all and some and cheyf of my request
And hole substance of my full entente
You thanking ever of your grant and hest
Both now and ever that ye me grace sent
To conquer him that never shall repent
Me for to serve and humble for to please
As fynall treasour of my hertes ease
And then anon Uenus cast a down
Into her lap branches white and grene
Of hawthorne that went enuyron
About her heed that Joye was to seen
And had her keep them honestly and clean
Which should not fade ne never were old
If she her bidding keep as she has told
And as these bows be both fair and sweet
Follow theffecte that they do specyfye
This to said both in cold and hete
Be ye of one heart and of one fantasye
As are these leaves which may not dye
By no duresse of storms that been kene
No more in winter than in somer grene
Right so by ensample of well or woo
For Joye torment or for aduersyte
Whether so fortune favor or be foo
For pouerte riches or prosperyte
That ye your heart keep in one degree
To love him best for nothing that ye feign
Whom I have bound so low under your chain
And with that word the goddess shoke her heed
And was in peace and spoke as tho no more
And there with all full femynyn of dread
Me thought the lady syghe began full sore
And said again lady that may restore
Hertes in Joye from their aduersyte
To do your wylll better and better after my gre
Thus ever slepynge dremynge as I lay
Within the temple me thought I saw
Great preces of folk murmr wonderful
To croude and shoue the temple was so full
Eueryche full besy in his own cause
That I ne may shortly in a clause
Dysceyue all the rytes and the guyse
And eke I want conning to deuyse
How some there were with blood encence and milk
And some with flowers sweet and soft as sylke
And some with sparowes and doves white
That for to began them delight
Unto the goddess with syghe and prayer
Them to relese of that they most desire
That for the prees shortly to conclude
I went my way for the multitude
Me for to refresshe out of prees alone
And by myself me thought as I began gone
With in the estres and began a while tarry
I saw a man that walked all solytary
That as me seemed for heaviness and dole
Him to complain that he walked so sole
Without espyenge of any other wight
And if I shall dyscryue him a right
If that he had not be in heaviness
Me thought he was / to speak of semelynes
Of shap of form / and also of stature
The most passing / that ever yet nature
Made in her works / and like to be a man
And therewith all as I reherce can
Of face and chere the most gracyous
To be byloued happy and ewrous
But as it seemed out ward by his chere
That he complained for lack of his desire
For by himself as he walked up and down
I herd him make a lamentacyon
And said alas / what thing may this be
That now am bound that whilom was fre
And went at large at mine eleccyon
Now am I caught under subieccyon
For to become a very homagere
To god of love / where or I came here
Felt in mine heart / naught of loves pain
But now of new / within her fyry chain
I am enbrased so that I may not strive
To serve and love while I am on live
The goodly fresshe in the temple yonder
I saw right now / that I had wonder
However god / for to reke all
Might make a thing so celestyall
So angelyke on earth to appear
For within the stremes of her eyes clear
I am wounded even to the heart
That fro the death I may not astert
And most I marvel that so suddenly
I was so yield to be at her mercy
Whether that she list me to live or deye
Without more / I must her lust obey
And take mekely my sodeyn adventure
For sith my life my death / and eke my cure
Is in her hand it will not auaylle
To grutche again / for of this bataylle
The palm is hers / and plainly the vyctorye
If I rebelled honor none ne glory
I might not in any wyle acheue
Sith I am yelden / how should I then preue
To reaue away / I wot hit will not be
Though I be loos / at large I may not flee
O god of love how sharp is now thyn arowe
Now may thou now so cruelly and so narowe
Without cause hurt me and wound
And take none head my sorrows to found
But like a bird that flees at her desire
Till suddenly within the pantyre
She is caught though late she was at large
A new tempest forcasteth now my barge
Now up now down / with wind it is so blow
So am I tossed and almost overthrow
Ferdryue in derkenes of many sundry wawe
Alas when shall this tempest ouerdrawe
To clear the skies of mine aduersyte
The lode sterre what that I ne may see
It is so hyd with clouds that be black
Alas when will this torment ouerslacke
I can not wit / for who is hurt of new
And bledeth in ward till he were pale of hew
And has his wound inwardly fresshe and grene
And it is not known unto the harms kene
Of mighty cupyde that can so hertes daunte
That no man in his war dare him vaunte
To get a price but oonly by mekenes
For there ne vayleth strive ne sturdynes
So may I say that with a look am yolde
And have no power to strive though I would
Thus stand I ever betwix life and death
To love and serve while I have breath
In such a place where I dare not plain
Like him that is in torment and in pain
And knows not to whom to discure
For there that I have holy set my cure
I dare not well for dread ne for danger
And for unknown tellen how the fire
Of loves bronde is kyndled in my breast
Thus am I murdered and slain at lest
So pryuely within my thought
O lady venus whom I have sought
So wysshe me now what me is best to do
That am distraught with my self so
That I ne wot what way for to torn
Sauf by my self soleyn for to morn
Hangyng in balance betwixe hope and dread
Without comfort remedy or read
For hope bids pursue and assaye
And again ward dread answerth nay
And now with hope I am set a lofte
But dread and danger hard and nothing soft
Has overthrow my trust and put a down
Now at my large / now fetred in prysoun
Now in torment / now in souerayn glory
Now in paradyse and now in purgatory
As man dispayred in a double werre
Borne up with hope / and then anon danger
Me draws a back / and says it shall not be
For where as I of mine aduersyte
Am bold some while mercy to require
Then comes despair and begins me to lere
A new lesson to hope full the contrary
They ben so diverse they will do me varye
And thus I stand dismayed in a trance
For when hope were lykly me tauaunce
For dread I tremble and dare one word not speak
And if hit so be / that I not outbreke
To tell the harms that greuen me so sore
But in myself lencrece them more and more
And to be slain fully me delight
When of my death she is no thing to wit
For but if she the contreynt plainly know
How should she ever / on my pains rue
Thus often time with hope I am meuyd
To tell her all / how I am greuyd
And to be hardy on me for to take
To axe mercy / but dread does me then^e a wake
And then wanhope answeryth me again
That better were that she have disdain
To deye attones unknowen of any wight
And therewith all bids hope anon right
Me to be bold and pray her of grace
And sith all virtues be portreyd in her face
Hit were not syttyng / that pity were behind
And right anon within my self I find
A new plee brought on me with dread
That me so maseth that I see no speed
By cause he said that stonyeth all my blood
I am so simple and she is so good
Thus hope and dread in me will not seace
To plete and strive my harms to encreace
But at hardest yet or I be deed
Of my distress sith I can no read
But stand down still as any stone
To fore the goddess I will me haste anon
And complain without more sermon
Though death be fyn and full conclusyon
Of my request / yet I will assaye
And right anon me thought I say
This woeful man as I have me morye
Full lowly enter in to an oratorye
And kneled adoun in full humble wise
To fore the goddess and began anon deuyse
His pyteous quarrel with a doleful chere
Saying right thus as ye shall here
The complaynt of the man
Redress of sorrow o Citherea
That with the stremes of thy plesau^t hete
Gladest the Mount of all Cirrea
Where thou haste chosen thy paleys and sete
Whose bright beams ben wesshen and wete
In the Reuer of Elycon the well
Have now pity of that I shall you tell
And not disdain ye of your benygnyte
My mortal woo O lady mine Goddess
Of grace and bounte and merciful pity
Benygnely to help and to redress
And though so be I can not well express
The grievous harms that I feel in my heart
Have never yet the less mercy of my smerte
This is to said O clear heuens light
That next the son sercled have your spear
Sith ye me hurt with your dreadful might
By infulgence of your beams clear
And that I by your service now so dear
As ye me brought in to this maladye
Be ye gracyous and shape ye remedy
For in you holy lies help of all this care
And know best my sorrow and all my pain
For dread of death / how I ne dare alas
To axen mercy ones / ne me complain
Now with your fire heart so constrayne
Without more or I deye at lest
That she may wit what is my request
Now I no thing in all this world desire
But for to serve fully to mine end
That foodly fresshe so womanly of chere
Without change while I have life and mind
And that ye would such grace send
Of my seruyse that she not disdeyne
Sythen her to serve I may not me restreyne
And sith that hope me has yeuen hardynes
To love her best and never to repent
Whiles that I live with all my besynes
To dread and serve / though danger never assente
And here upon ye know mine entente
How I have vowed fully in my mind
To be her man / though I no mercy find
For in my heart enprynted is so sore
Her shap her form and all her semelynes
Her port her chere / her godenes more and more
Her womanhed and eke her gentylnes
Her troth / her faith and her kyndnes
With all virtues each set in her degree
There is no lack / saving oonly of pity
Her sad demenyng of will not varyable
Of look benygne / and rote of all plesaunce
And exemplayre to all that will be stable
Discrete prudence of wysdom suffysaunce
Myrour of wit ground of governance
A world of beauty compassed in her face
Whose persant look does through my heart race;
And over this wonder secret and true
A well of fredome and right bounteuous
And ever encrecyng in virtue new and new
Of speech goodly / and wonder gracyous
Deuoyde of pride / to poor not dyspytous
And if that I shortly shall not feyne
Save upon mercy I no thing complain
What wonder thene / thought I be with dread
Inly supprysed for to axely grace
Of her that is queen of womanhede
For well I wot in so high a place
It will not be / therefore I over pace
And take lowly what woo I endure
Till she of pity me take to her cure
But one auowe plainly here I make
That whether so be / she do me life or deye
I will not grutche / but humbly it take
And thank god and wylfully obey
For by my troth my heart shall never reneye
For life ne death mercy ne danger
Of will and thought to be at her desire
To ben as true as ever was Anthonyus
To Cleopatre while him lasted breath
Or on to Thesbe young Pyramus
That was faithful found till them deperted death
Right so shall I till Antropos me sleeth
For well or woo her faithful man be found
Unto my last / like as my heart is bound
To love as well as did Achylles
Unto his last the fair Polixene
Or as the great famous Hercules
For Dianyre that felt the shote kene
Right so shall I say right as I mean
While that I live / her both dread and serve
For lack of mercy though she do me sterue
Now lady Venus to whom no thing unknow
Is in the world hyde / ne naught may be
For there nys thing neither hye ne low
May be counceyled from your pryuete
Fro whom my meuynge is not now secree
But wit fully that mine intent is true
And like my troth now on my pain rue
For more of grace than of presumpcyon
I axe mercy and nothing of dute
Of lowly humbles without offencyon
That ye enclyne of your benygnyte
Your audyence unto my humylyte
To grant me that to you I clepe and call
Some day relees yet of my pains all
And sith ye have the guerdon and the mede
Of all lovers plainly in your hand
Now of grace and pity take ye head
Of my dystres that am under your bond
So lowly bound as ye well understand
In that place where I took first my wound
Of pity suffer ye my health may be found
That like as she me hurt with a sygh:
Right so with health let me her sustene
And as the stremes of her even bright
Sometime my heart with wounds sharp and kene
Through persed have and yet be fresshe and grene
So as she me hurt / let her me socour
Or else certain I may not long endure
For lack of speech I can say you no more
I have matter but I can not plain
My wit is dull to tell all my sore
A mouth I have and yet for all my pain
For want of words I may not now attain
To tell half that does my heart grieve
Mercy abiding till she me list releue
But this theffecte of my matter fynall
With death or mercy relees for to find
For heart body thought life lust and all
With all my reason and all my full mind
And five wits of one assent I bind
To her seruyse with out any strife
And make her pryncesse of my death or life
And now I pray of reuth and eke pity
O goodly planet o lady Uenus bright
That ye your sone of his deyte
Cupyde I mean that with his dreadful might
And with his bronde that is so clear of light
Heart so to fire and to mark
As ye me sometime brent with a spark
That like wise and with the same fire
She may be it as I now brenne and melte
So that her heart be fla^med with desire
That she may know by ferue^ce how I swelte
For pity plainly if she felt
The self hete that does mine heart enbrace
I hope of reuth she will do me grace
And there with all Uenus as we thought
Toward this man full benygnely
Can cast her eye like as that she rought
Of his disease and said full goodly
Sith it is so that thou so humbly
Without grutchynge out hestes list obey
Toward thine help I will anon purueye
And also my sone Cupyde that is so blind
He shall be helping fully to perform
Your hole desire that no thing be behind
Ne shall be left so we shall reform
This pyteous complaynt yt makes the to morn
That she for whom you sorowest most in heart
Shall through her mercy releace all thy smerte
When she sees time through her purueau^ce
Be not to hasty but suffer all thing well
For in abiding through lowly obeyssaunce
Lies full redres of all that ye now feel
And she shall be as true as any stele
To you alone by our might and grace
If ye list mekely abide a little space
But understand ye that all her cherysynge
Shall be grounded upon honest
That no wight shall by any rehersynge
Deem amys of her in no degree
For neither mercy reuth nor pity
She shall not have ne take of the none head
Ferther than longs unto her womanhede
Be not astonyed of no wylfulnes
Ne not despeyred of this dissolucyon
Let reason bridle lust by buxumnes
Without grutchyng or rebellyon
For Joye shall follow all this passion
For who can suffer torment and endure
Ne may not faylle but follow shall his cure
For to fore all she shall the love best
So shall I her without offencyon
By Influence enspyre in her breast
In honest wise and full entencyon
For to enclyne by clean affection
Her heart fully on the to have reuthe
By cause I know that thou menest treuthe
Go now to her where she stands a side
With humble chere and put the in her grace
And all before let hope be thy guide
And though that dread would with the pace
Itsytteth well but look that thou arace
Out of thyn heart wanhope and dyspeyr
To her presence or thou have repair
And mercy first shall thy way make
And honest men before do thy message
To make pity in her heart awake
And secretnes to further thy vyage
With humble port to her that is so sage
Shall means be / and I my self also
Shall the forne or thy tale be done
Go forth anon / and be right good of chere
For specheles nothing may you speed
Be good of trust and be no thing in were
Sith I my self shall help in this need
For at leest of her goodlyhede
She shall to the her audyence enclyne
And lowly to her till thou thy tale fine
For well thou wotest if I shall not feyne
Without speech thou may no mercy have
For who that will of his pryue pain
Fully be cured his life to help and save
He must mekely out of his heart grave
Dyscure his wound and show it his leche
Or else deye for defaute of speech
For he that is in myscheyf reklees
To seche help I hold him a wretch
And she ne may thyn heart bring in peace
But if thy complaynt to her heart stretche
Would thou be cured and will no salve fetch
It will not be for no wight may atteyne
To come to bliss if he list live in pain
Therefore at ones go forth in humble wise
Tofore thy lady and lowly knele a down
And in all troth thy words so deuyse
That she ou the have compassyon
For she that is of so hye renown
In all virtues as queen and sovereign
Of womanhede shall rewe on thy pain
And when the goddess this lesson had told
A boute me so began I behold
Right so astonyed stood in a trance
To see the manner and countenance
And all the chere of this woeful man
That was of hew deedly pale and wan
With dread supprysed in his own thought
Making chere as though he rought naught
Of life ne death ne what so him betyde
So much fere he had on every side
To put him forth for to tell his pain
Unto his lady other to complain
What woo he led torment or disease
What deedly sorrow his heart did sese
For reuth of which his woes I endyte
My pen I feel quake as I write
Of him I had so great compassyon
For to reherce his weymentacyon
That uneath though with myself I strive
I lack conning his pains to dyscryue
Alas to whom shall I for help call
Not to the muses for cause they ben all
Help of right in Joy and not in woo
And in matters that they delight also
Wherefore they nyll as now dyrecte my style
Nor me enspyre alas the hard while
I can no further but to Thesyphon
And to her sister to call help upon
That be goddesses of torment and pain
Now let your teres in to mine ynke reyne
With woeful words my paper for to blotte
This woeful matter to paynt not but spotte
To tell the manner of this dredefull man
Upon his complaynt when he first began
To tell his lady when he began declare
His hyd sorrows and his evil fare
That his heart constreyned so sore
Theffecte of which was this without more
Pryncesse of youth and flour of gentylnes
Ensample of virtue ground of curtesye
Of beauty rote queen and eke maystres
To all women how they shall them gye
And sothfast myrrour texemplefye
The right way of port and of womanhede
What I shall say of mercy take ye head
Besechynge unto your hye nobles
With quakynge heart of my Inward dread
Of grace and pity and not of ryghtwysnes
Of very reuth to helpen this need
This is to say O well of goodlyhede
That I ne recke though ye do me deye
So ye list first to here what I seye
The dredefull stroke the great force and might
Of good Cupyde that no man may rebel
So Inwardly through out my heart right
I perced has that I ne may council
Mine hyd wound ne I ne may apele
Unto no gretter this mighty god so fast
You to serve has me bound unto my last
My heart and all without strife ar yolde
For life or death to your seruyse alone
Right as the goddess mighty Venus would
Tofore her mekely when I made my moan
She me constreyned without change anon
To your seruyse and never for to feign
Wherso ever ye list to do me ease or pain
So that I can nothing but mercy cry
Of you my lady and change for no new
That ye list goodly tofore or that I deye
Of very reuth upon my pains rewe
For by my troth and ye my pains knew
What is the cause of mine aduersyte
On my disease ye would have pity
For unto you true and eke secre
I will be found to serve as I best can
And therewith all as lowly in each degree
To you be alone as ever yet was man
Unto his lady from the time I began
And shall so forth withouten any sloth
Whiles that I live by god and by my troth
For liver I had to deye suddenly
Than you offense in any manner wise
And suffer pains inward pryuely
Than my seruyse as now ye should despise
For I right naught will axe in no wise
But for your servant ye would me accept
And when I trespace goodly me correct
And for to grant of mercy the prays
Only of grace and womanly pity
From day to day that I might let
You for to plese / and therewith all that ye
When I do mys / list for to teache me
In your seruyse how that I may amend
From hensforth and never you offend
For unto me it does enough suffyse
That for your man ye would me receive
Fully to be as ye list deuyse
And as ferforth as my wits can conceive
And therewith all like as ye preue
That I be true / to guerdone me of grace
Or else to punysshe after my trespace
And if so be that I may not atteyne
Unto your mercy / yet grant at lest
In your seruyse for all my woo and pain
That I may deyen after my beheste
This is all and some the fyn of my request
Either with mercy your servant to save
Or mercyles that I may be begraue
And when this benygne of her entente true
Conceived has the complaynt of this man
Right as the fresse rody Rose new
Of her color to wexen she began
Her blood astonyed so from her heart it ran
In to her face of very femynyte
Through honest dread abashed was she
And humbly she began her eyes cast
To wards him of her benygnyte
So that no word by her lyppes paste
For have nor dread mercy ne pity
For so demened she was in honest
That vndeuysed no thing fro her stert
So much of reason was compassed in heart
Till at last of which she did abrayd
When she his truth and menyng dit feel
And unto him full goodly spoke and said
Of your behest and your menyng well
And your seruyse so faithful every dele
Which unto me so lowly now ye offer
With all my heart / I thank you of your profer
That for so much your intent is set
Oonly in virtue I brydled under dread
Ye must of right nedis fare the bet
Of your request / and the better speed
But as for me I may of womanhede
No ferther grant to you in mine entente
Than as my lady Uenus will assente
For she well knows I am not at my large
To done right naught but by her ordinance
So am I drowned under her dread full charge
Her list tobeye without varyaunce
But for my part so it be pleaunce
Unto the goddess for troth in your empryse
I you accept fully to my seruyse
For she my heart has in subieccyon
Which holy is yours and never shall repete
In thought nor deed in mine eleccyon
Wytnes on Uenus that knows mine intent
Fully to beye her dome and Judgment
So as her list dispose and ordeyne
Right as she knows the trought of us tweyne
For unto the time that Uenus list provide
To shape a way for our hertes ease
Both ye and I mekely must abide
To take at gree / and not of our disease
To grutche again till that she list tappease
Our hyd woo so Inly that constreyneth
From day to day and our hertes peyneth
For in abydyng of woo and all affraye
Who so can suffer is founden remedy
And for the best full often is made delay
Er man beheld of their maladye
Wherefore as Ueuus list this matter to gye
Let us agree / and take all for the best
Till her list set both our hertes in rest
For she is that byndeth and can constreyn
Hertes in one / this fortunate planete
And can releace lovers of her pain
To turn fully her bitter in to sweet
Now blysfull gods down fro thy sterry sete
Us to fortun^e cast your stremes shene
Like as ye know / that we troth mean
And therewith all as I mine eyes cast
Fo to perceive the manner of these sweyne
To fore the goddess mekely as they paste
Me thought I saw with a golden cheyne
Uenus / anon enbrace and constreyne
Her both hertes in one / for to persevere
Whiles that they live / and never to disseuere
Saying right thus with a benygne chere
Sith it is so / ye be under my might
My will is thus / that ye my daughter dear
Full accept this man as it is right
Tnto your grace anon here in my sight
That ever has been so lowly you to serve
It is good skyll your thank that he deserve
Your honor sauf and also your womanhede
Him to cherysshe / it sytteth you right well
Sith he is bound under hope and dread
Amyd my cheyne that forged is of stele
Ye must of mercy shape that ye feel
In you some grace of his long seruyse
And that in have like as I shall deuyse
This is to say that ye take heed
How he to you often faith full and true
Of all your servants / and no thing for his mede
Of you ne asks / but ye on him rue
For he vowed has to change for no new
For life ne death for Joy ne for pain
As to be yours so as ye list ordain
Wherefore ye must or else it were wrong
Unto your grace fully him receive
In my presence because he has so long
Holy ben yours as ye may conceive
That from mercy if ye him weyue
I will myself record cruelte
In your person and great lack of pity
Let him for his troth find then again
For long seruyse guerdon him with grace
And let your pity weye down his pain
For time is now danger to arace
Out of your heart and mercy in to space
And love for love would well biseme
To give again and this I plainly deem
And as for him I will be his borowe
Of lowlyhede and besy attendaunce
How he shall be both eve and morrow
Full dylygent to do his obseruaunce
And ever awaytynge you to do pleasaunce
Wherefore my sone lysten and take heed
Fully to obey as I shall the read
And first of all my will is that thou be
Faithful in heart and constante as a wall
True humble meke and therewith all secre
Without change in party or in all
And for no torment that the fall shall
Tempest the not but ever in stedfastnes
Bote thine heart and void doublenes
And ferthermore have in reverence
These women all for thy lady sake
And suffer never that men them do offense
For love of one but ever undertake
Them to defend whether they sleep or wake
And ay be ready to hold them party
Against all tho that to them have envy
Be curteys ay and louly of thy speech
To rich and poor ay fresshe and well besyne
And ever besy ways for to seche
All true lovers to releace or their pain
Sith thou art one and of no wight have dysdayne
For love has power hertes for to daunt
And never for cherysshynge the to much auaunt
Be lusty eke void of all trystesse
And take no thought but ever be Iocunde
And not to pensyf for none heaviness
And with thy gladness let sadness ay be found
When woe approaches let mirth most habou^d
As manhood axeth and though thou feel smerte.
Let not to many know of thyn heart
And all virtues besely thou sue
Uyces eschew for the love of one
And for no tales thyn heart not renew
Word is but wind that shall sone be gone
What ever thou here be dombe as any stone
And to answer to sone not the delight
For here she stands that all this shall the quyte.
And whether thou be absent or in presence
None others beauty let in thy heart mine
Sith I have give her of beauty excellence
Above all other in virtue for to shine
And think how in fire men are wont to fine
This pured gold to put it in assaye
So to the prove thou art put in delay
But time shall come thou shalt for thy suffrau^ce
Be well apayd and take for thy mede
Thy lives Joy and all thy suffysaunce
So that good hope always thy brydell led
Let no dyspayt hyndre the with dread
But ay thy trust upon her mercy ground
Sith none but she may thy sorrow sound
Each hour and time weke day and year
Be like faithful and vary not for lyte
Abide a while and then of thy delyre
The time nygheth that shall the most delight
And let no sorrow in thy heart byte
For no dyfferrynge sith thou for thy mede
Shall rejoice in peace the flout of womanhede
Think how she is this worlds son and light
The sterre of beauty the flower eke of fayrnes
Both crop and rote and ete the rubye bright
Hertes to glade ytroubled with derkenes
And how I have made her thine hertes empress
Be glad therefore to be under her bond
Now come nere daughter and take hy^ by the hand
Unto this fyn that after all these shours
Of his torment he may be glad and light
When by your grace ye take him to be yours
For evermore anon here in my sight
And eke I will also as it is right
Without more his langour for to lysse
In my presence anon that ye him kiss
That there may be of all your old smertes
A full relees under Joy assured
And that one lock be of your both hertes
Shytte with my keye of gold so well pured
Only in sign that ye have recured
Your hole desire here in this holy place
Within my temple now in the year of grace
Eternally be bound of assurance
The knot is knytte that may not be unbound
That all the gods of this allyaunce
Saturn Juno and Mars as it is found
And eke Cupyde that first did you wound
Shall bear record / and evermore be wreke
On which of you his troth first break
So that by aspectes of their fyry lokes
Without mercy shall fall the vengeance
For to be raced clean out of my books
On which of you be found of varyaunce
Therefore attones set your pleasaunce
Fully to be while ye have life and mind
Of one accord unto your lives end
That if the spyryte of newfanglenes
In any wise your hertes would assayll
To meue or styre to bring in doublenes
Upon your troth to give a battle
Let not your courage ne your force fayll
Nor none assaults you flytten or remeue
For unassayed no man may troth preue
For white is whyter if it be set by black
And sweet is sweter after bytternes
And falshed ever is driven and put abacke
Where troth is roted without falsnes
Withoue prove there may be no sekernes
Of love or hate and therefore of you two
Shall love be more / for it was bought with woo
And every thing is had more in deute
And more of price when it is dear bought
And eke love stondeth more in seurte
When it is tofore with pain woo and thought
Conquered was first when it was sought
And every conquest has his excellence
In his poursute as it fyndeth resystence
And so to you more sote and agreeable
Shall love be found I do you plainly assure
Without grutchyng that ye were suffrable
So low so meke pacyently to endure
That all atones I shall do now my cure
For now and ever your hertes so to bind
That naught but death shall the knot unbind
Now in this matter what should I longer dwell
Come ye attones and do as I have said
And first my daughter that are of bou^te well
In heart and thought be glad and well apayd
To do him grace that shall and has obeyed
Your lusts ever / and I will for his sake
Of trough to you be bound and undertake
And so forth within presence as they stond
To fore the gods this fair and well
Her humble servant took goodly by the hond
As he tofore her / mekely did knele
And kyssed him after fulfyllyng every dele
From point to point in full thryfty wise
As ye to forn had Uenus herd deuyse
Thus is this man to Joy and all plesaunce
From heaviness and from his pains old
Full reconcyled / and has full suffesaunce
Of her that ever men well and would
That in good faith and I tell should
The in ward myrthes did her hertes brace
For all my life to tell / it were to little space
For he has won her that he loves best
And she to grace has take him of pity
And thus their hertes ben both set in rest
Without change or mutabylyte
And Venus has of her benygnyte
Confermed all what shall I longer tarry
These tweyne in one and neuerto vary
That for the Joy in the temple above
Of this accord by great solempnyte
Was laud and honor within and without
Give to Venus and to the deyte
Of god Cupide so that Calyope
And all her systerne in their armonye
Sweet with their songs the gods to magnefye
And all at ones with notes loud and sharp
They did her honor and reverence
And Orpheus among them with his harp
Can strings touch with his dylygence
And Amphyon that has such excellence
Of musyke ay did his business
To please the queen Uenus and goddess
Only for cause of the affynyte
Betwyx these two not lusty to dysceuere
And every lover rf low and hye degree
Can Uenus pray fro thens forth and ever
That hole of them the love may persevere
Withouten end in such wise as they gonne
And more encrece that it of hard was won
And the gods herynge this request
As she that knew the clean entencyon
Of both them tweyne made a byhest
Perpetually by confyrmacyon
Whiles they live of one affection
They shall endure there is no more to said
That neither shall have matter to complain
So ferforth evermore in our eternal se
The gods have in our presence
Fully devised through their deyte
And holy concluded by their Influence
That by their might and Just prudence
The love of them by grace and eke fortune
Without change shall evermore contune
Of which grant the Temple enuyron
Through hye comfort of them yt were present
Anon was gone with a melodyous sown
An name of tho that troth in love mente
A balade new in full good intent
Tofore the gods with notes loud and clear
Singing right this anon as ye shall here
Fairest of sterres that with your persaunt light
And with the cherysshynge of your stremes clear
Cause in love hertes to be light
Only by shynynge of your glad spear
Now laud and price o lady Uenus dear
Be to your name that have without sin
This man fortuned his lady for to win
Wylly planete O esperous so bright
That woeful hertes can appese and stere
And ever are ready by your grace and might
To help all tho that by love so dear
And have power hertes to set on fire
Honor to you of all that been here Inn
That have this man his lady made to win
O mighty goddess day sterre after night
Gladdynge the morrow when ye do appear
To void derkenes by fresshenes of your light
Only with twynklynge of your pleasant chere.
To you we thank lovers that been here
That ye this man and never for to twynne
Fortuned have his lady for to win
And with the noise and heavenly melodye
With that they made in their armouye
Thrughe out the temple for this man's sake
Out of my sleep anon I did awake
And for astonyed knew as tho no read
For sudden change oppressed with dread
My thought was cast in a trance
So clean away was tho my remembrance
Of all my dreme whereof frete thought and woe
I had in heart and nyst what was to do
For heaviness that I had lost the sight
Of her that I all the long night
Had dremed of in mine aduysyon
Whereof I made great lamentacyon
Because I had never in my life beforne
Saw none so fair sith that I was borne
For love of whom so as I can endyte
I purpose here to make and write
A little treatise and process make
In price of women oonly for her sake
Them to commend as it is skyll and right
For her goodness with all my might
Praynge to her that is so bounteuous
So full of virtue and so gracyous
Of womanhede and merciful pity
This simple treatise for to take in gre
Till I have leyzer unto her hye renoun
For to expowne my foresaid vysyoun
And tell in plain the sygnefyaunce
As it comes to my remembrance
So that hereafter my lady may it look
Now go thy way thou little rude book
To her presence as I the command
And first of all thou me rec^omaunde
Unto her and to her excellence
And pray to her it be none offense
If any word in the be myssayd
Besechynge her she be not evil apayd
For as her list I will the efte correct
When that her lyketh agaynwarde the dyrecte
I mean that benygne and goodly of face
Now go thy way and put the in her grace
