o Thoughtful heart plungyd in distress
With slo^bre of sloth this long wynters night
Out of the sleep of mortal heaviness
Awake anon and look upon the light
Of thylke sterre that with her bemys bright
And with the shynyng of his stremes merye
Is wont to glade al our emysperye
And to oppress the derknes and the doole
Of heavy hertis that sorowen and syghen often
I mean the sterre of the bright poole
That with her bemys when she is alofte
May all the trouble assuage and assofte
Of worldly wawys which in this mortal see
Has us bysecte with great aduersite
The rage of which is so tempestyous
That when the calm is most blandisshyng
Then is the storm of death most perilous
If that he want the light of her shynyng
And but the sight allas of her lokyng
From death is brynke us to ascape
The haven of life of us may not betake
This streme in beauty passy^h plyades
Both of shynyng and of stremes clear
Boetes and artur and also Iades
And esperus when hit does appear
For this is spica with her bright spear
That toward even at mydnyght and at morrow
Down from heuyn adawyth al our sorrow
Whose bright bemes shynen fro so far
That clouds blake may the light not steyne
For this of Jacob is the fair sterre
That under wawes never does declyne
Whose course is not under the ec^^ptike line
But ever liche of beauty may be seen
Amyd the arc of our meridyne
And dries up the bitter terys wete
Of au^o^^ after the morrow graye
That she in weeping does on flowers flete
In lusty aprille and in fressh may
And causyth phoebus the bright someris day
With his wayne goldborned bright and fair
To enchace the mystes of our cloudy air
For this is the sterre that bare the bright son
Which holds the spear of Judah in his hand
Whose stremes ben out of Iesse run
To shede her light both in see and land
Whose glad bemys without eclipsyng stand
Es^ward to us in the oryent full shene
With light of grace to wide al our tene
Now fair sterre / o sterre of sterris all
Whose light to see aungelis delight
So ^at the gold dew of thy grace fall
In to my br^ste like scalis fair and whyt
Me to enspyre of that I will endyte
With thylke bawme sent down by miracle
When the holy ghoost the made his tabernacle
And the lycoure of thy grace shede
In to my pen to ensumyne this dytee
Through thy supporte that I may proceed
Somewhat to say in laud and praysyng of the
And first I think of thy natyuyte
So that thyn help from me not twynne
Benygne lady anon to begin
The natyuyte of our lady capitulo primo
a Flour of ^^rtu full (...)
Full made was with (...)
Only by grace upon the (...)
Out of Iesse spryngyng from the (...)
Of god ordained to be refuyte and (...)
Unto mankind our trouble to determyne
Full long beforne by prescience deuyne
The which flower preseruyth man fro death
Unto the virtue who so lys^ take heed
That in a gardyn amyd of nazareth
So fair sometime began to spring and sprede
That through the world both in length and bread
The fresshe odoure and also the swetnesse
Hertis comfort of al her heaviness
O nazareth with bethlem the beside
This flower the makyth of name more ryalle
Than outher rome elate and full of pride
Or mighty troy with the stourdy wall
Whose renoun holds to be peregalle
In honor price fame or reverence
Unto your passing worthy excellence
If for the fruit co^mendyd be the tree
Thou have ruore laud and commendacion
For thylke flower spring out of the
Than has auffrike or worthy scipyon
Of rome Caesar or of fabyon
Though her names were sometime grave in gold
Her ydel fame to thyn may not be told
Therefore rejoice and be right glad and light
O nazareth of name most flouryng
For out of the flower most fair of sight
Most full of grace sometime did spring
Of the which fully remembrynge
So long agone spoke holy ysaye
When that he said in his prophecy^
That on this flower plainly should rest
The holy ghoost for his chosen place
As for the fairest and also for the l^ste
That ever was and most full of grace
Whose passing beauty no storms may defface
But ever a like contynueth fressh of hew
Withouten f^dyng the color is so true
For this is the flower that god him self beheld
The whyt lelye of the chosyn vale
The sweet rose of the fair field
Which of color waxyth never pale
The vyolet our langour to auale
Purpyl bewyd through mercy and pity
To socour all that in myschyef be
And from the stock of Ioachym and anne
This holy flour had her orygynal
To him before by sign y showed when
The aungel told hem plainly that there shall
Of hem be borne a maid in special
Chosen of god most chyef of her alye
And for her meekness hight shall marye
And when the aungel at the yate of gold
Had of this maid the birth prophesied
And all the manner of hem both told
In books old as it is specefyed
Home to her hows anon they have hem h^^d
And she conceyuyth this faithful true wife
By Ioachym the holy fruit of life
Out of the which began grow al our grace
Our old sorrows fully for to syne
The bitter galle plainly to enchace
Of the venym called serpentyne
For that when anna had months nine
Borne this fruit so holy and entiere
Through the grace of god anon hit did appear
In the oryent to glad al mankind
With dedely error oppressyd of the night
With clouds black / and with sky^^ blind
Till they were cleryd with fayrenes of the light
Of the which the aungel sometime had a sight
With Jacob wrastlyng from him as he brayed
So long aforne to him when he said
Let me depart withouten more affraye
Against me and make no resystence
The night is passed / lo the morrow graye
The fresshe aurora so fair in appearance
Her light dawyth to void al offense
Of winter nyghtes full long and tedyous
With new apperyng so glad and gracyous
This is to say the holy dawynyng
Of this maid of her natyuyte
The night began void of our old morning
As the Aungel in figure did see
With such a touch made Jacob be
Sore in his senewes like as it is found
In thylk membre where lust does most habounde
In figure only that there should spring
Down by dyssent out of his kynrede
A clean maid in will and in worchynge
Pure of intent both in thought and deed
With aurora with his bemes read
The night avoided with his copes done
Before the vpperyst of the bright son
Right so this maid at her natyuyte
The night of death avoided has away
And bright calendys most lusty for to see
Of Phoebus vpryst wythouten more delay
For she is aurora sobrely this is to say
Out of which as prophets began deuyse
The son of life to us began first deuyse
Of whose birth full many a day beforne
Albumazar wrote in special
And said a maid sothely shall be borne
Under the sign above celestyall
That called is the sign vyrgynal
The which maid as he eke tell can
Shall bear a child without spott^ of man
And as mynerua mother of prudence
Is hold a maid / right so this heavenly queen
Bare in her womb the faders sapyence
And mother was and maiden clean
Of god provided plainly forto been
Socour to man and help in all our need
When she was borne this flower of womanhede
How our lady was offryd in to the temple capitulo tercio
aNd after three year as was the usage.
Her mother pappys she left as in sowkynge
And than anon in her tender age
Unto the temple devoutly they her bring
And unto god they made offering*
Of this maid for to abide there
With other maidens that in the temple were*
And not withstondyng her passing tenderness
Her grene youth but of yeris three
Through goddis help this branch of holiness
Withouten help went up gree by gree
Fyftene alofte that al myghten see
Tofore that altar of so great an hyghte
And when her mother thereof had a sight
For very Joy anon she fylle a down
And said thus that al myghten here
God from above has herd mine oryson
Of his goodness and granted my prayere
And comfortid mine oppressyd chere
In sight of hem that loosen at my pain
And of malice began at me dysdayne
Now has he ben my synguler refute
To my trystesse consolacion
For he has made the bareyn to bear fruit
Through his mighty vysitacion
And maad clear my confusion
And all my woo for to ouergo on
Only by grace amyd all my foon
And through his might the hertes has bowyd
Of hem that began to chase at me by pride
Wherefore she has unto god auowyd
That her daughter shall in the temple abide
The holy ghoost for to been her guide
For evermore by gods purueaunce
Through her mekenes him to do plesaunce
Forth al her life there to sleep and wake
Him for to serve with humble parfytenesse
That al maidens might ensaumple ta^e
Of her allone to live in clennesse
And specially of her meekness
Benygne port countenance and chere
If that hem list of her they might bear
Full of virtue deuoyde of all outrage
Her heart was that god to dwell in che^e
And day by day right as she wexe in age
Right so in virtue began she to encrece
And night ne day would she never ceace
To exclude slouthe and vices to weruaye
With hand to worche or with mouth to pray
For but in god her heart naught deliteth
So upon him entierly was her thought
And from above by grace he her visits
That every thing but him she set at naught
Of worldly lust she has so litel thought
That out of mind she let hit ever slide
That naught but god may in her abide
And when that she xv year did attain
She was as sad in conversation
And also demure sothely for to said
From al chyldehede and dissolucion
In governance and in discrescion
And in talkyng as wise and as sage
As any maid of thirty year of age
Of the conversation of our lady in the Temple
aNd of her reule this was her usage
From day to day this holy maid entyere
From pryme at morn by contynuaunce
Till three of the belle to be in her prayere
And till the son was at mydday spear
On gold and silver and on wu^^es soft
With her hands she would wyrche often
And even at none to bring her her fode
From god above there was an aungel sent
Which that she took as for her lyfloode
Thankyng him ay with al her hole intent
And after mete anon this maid is went
Ageyn to pray till phoebus went to rest
And at euene with him she took her rest
This life she ladde and this course she gooth
In whom was never yet fond offense
And never man saw this maid wrooth
But ever meke and full of patience
Of heart clean and pure of conscience
This life she lad and as lokis teache
Of words few and wonder soft of speech
The mete also that was to her brought
Out of the temple for her sustenaunce
With heart glad and with a parfyt thought
To pour and nedy that lived in penance
To give hit freely was al her plesaunce
And who that euyr of her had a sight
Of al disease was made glad and light
And every wight greuyd with sekenes
A touch of her made hem hole anon
And they that were in thought and in distres
When they her seye her malice was a goone
And thus she was to euericho one
Of al myschyef refuyte and remedy
With a beholding of her goodely eye
And of this maid eke as it is told
Her godely face was so full of light
That no man might sustain to behold
For hit was clerer than the son bright
That the crown in the wynters night
Of adryanne ne of the sterris seven
To her fayrnes ne be not for to neue ne
Yet neuyr man temptyd was to sin
While he beheld on her goodely face
The holy ghoost so hoole was her within
That al enuyron spredde began his grace
Where that she was present in the place
For alwey god gaf her to her presence
So fulsom light of heavenly influence
Ne none so fair was never found in reme
As was that maid of Judah and Syon
The daughter chosen of Iherusalem
Of dauythis sede to be set allone
Of al maydenes to rekene hem euerychone
She bare the prise as well in fayrnesse
As she excellyd in virtue and goodness
Let be thou greece and speak not of Eleyne
Ne thou Troy of young pollycene
Ne rome of Lucresse with her eyes tweyne
Ne thou cartage of thy fressh queen
Dido that was sometime so fair to seen
Let be you: boost and take of hem none head
Whose beauty fails as flower in frosty mede
(...) was meke but not to her meekness
And Judith wise / but she yet did excelle
And bersabe of great semelynesse
And rachel fair Jacob can you tell
But she allone of woman head the well
Of bounte beauty that never fade may
Naught like a flower that florissheth but in may
Passith echone both nygh and far
Both in fayrnesse and in perfeccion
Right as the son does a lityl sterre
And as the Rubye has the renoun
Of stones al and domynacion
Right so this maid to speak of holiness
Of wymmen all is lady and maistresse
Of whom spoke sometime wise Salamon
In sapyence who so list to seek
That she was chosyn for her self allone
This whyt down with her eyes meke
Whose chekes weren her beauty for to ^ke
With ^^lyes meynte and fressh roses reed
This is to say who so can take heed
First with the rose of womanly sufferaunce
And with the fair lylye next of chastyte
She was ennewyd to give her suffysaunce
As well in goodness as in beauty
And as he says she fayrer was to see
Than outher phoebus platly or lucyne
With horns full of heaven when they shine
And of this maid as saint ancelme faith
In his writing her beauty to termyne
Of face fair but fayrer yet of faith
He says she was this holy pure virgyne
Whose chaste heart to no thing did enclyne
For all her beauty but to holiness
Of whom also this auctour says express
That she was daughter of dauyd by dissent
Sterre of the sea and goddis own analle
Even in this world alwey of one intent
And gods spouse his hestys to fulfille
And ever ready for to do his will
Cristis temple and also receptacle
Of the holy ghoost and chosen tabernacle
The yate of heaven and also the fayrnesse
Of wymmen al who so looks a right
Of maydenhede lady and pryncesse
One of the five that bare her lamps light
Ready to mete with her spouse at night
Full prudently awaytyng at the yate
That for no slouthe she came not to late
In figure eke the chaundelabre of gold
That sometime hare seven lampys shene
This is to say the receyte of the hold
Of god preseruyd for she was so clean
Thorugh her merit endewed for to been
By grace of him that is of power most
With the seven yeftes of the holy ghooste
How our lady receyuyd the seven yeftes of the holy ghoost capitulo quinto
He first yeft was the yefte of dread
To eschew each thing that shall god displese
The next pity of very womanhede
To rewe on all that she saw in disease
The third connyng god / and man to please
The fourth streng the through her steadfastness
Only by virtue al vices to oppress
Of counceyl eke she had excellence
To keep her pure in vyrgynyte
For ay with counceyl alyed is prudence
Of understanding eke the pefte had she
For god him self chese with her to be
And of wisdom so god list her auaunce
To know each thing that was to his plesaunce
She was also the Trone void of sin
Th^^ stondyth so ryal in gods own sight
To fore which seven lamps brenne
With heavenly fire so spyrytual of light
That never wast but ever alyche bright
Contynuen in one here above in heaven
By the which trone and the lampys seven
Is understand this maid most entere
With seven virtues that in her were found
That sometime weren with ghoostely light so clear
Through light of virtue inwardely iocounde
Only through grace that did in her habounde
And al they were grounded in meekness
Her light to god more plesauntly to dress
For faith in her had a ground so (...)
That hit was void of al doubleness
Her hope of trist was also mayntynoble
Rotyd in god by parfyt sike ^nesse
Whose charity so large began him dress
That up to god hastyd ran the fire
With heart of clennesse to al by desire
Strong in virtue prudent in governance
She had also conveyed with clennesse
And soueraynly she had attemperaunce
In all her werkis with great aduysidnesse
And ever annexyd unto rightwysnes
Within her h^rte of womanly bounte
She had of custom mercy and pity
Sothfast ensaumple also of chastyte
As says ambrose she was in thought and deed
And true myrrour of vyrgynyte
Of poorte benygne full of bowlyhede
As humble of chere and femynyne of dread
Prudent of speech of what she list to show
Large of sentence and but of words few
To pray and read that was ever her life
Of heart waker by devotion
To god alwey with thought contemplatyf
Full fervent ever in her entencion
And ydel never from ocupacion
And specially to almesdede
Her hand was ever ready at the need
And full she was of compassyon
To rewe in all that felt woo or smer^^
Well wylled ever with hole affeccion
To every wight so long was her ^er^e
Sad with all this that her never a^^er^^
A look a myo of her eyes fair
So close of sight was this deboneyre
And in psalms of holy pr^phecye
To look and read she found most delight
And when she saw and found in Is^ye
Of cristys birth how he did write
To god she left her tender h^ndys white
Besechyng him she might abide and see
The basful day of his natyuyte
And in the book of elyzabeth
That tytelyd is of her auysions
I find how this maid of nazareth
Said every day seven orisons
That called ben her peticions
With humble heart this blesful young maid
Full lowly knelyng even thus she said
How our lady prayed to god for seven peticions capitulo quinto
o Blisful lord that know the entente
Of every hette in thyn eternal sight
Give me grace the first commandment
To fulfille as it is skylle and right
And grant also with heart will and might
And al my soul and al my knowing

And give me might plainly to fulfille
The next byddyng like to thy plesaunce
And for to love with heart and al my will

Right as my self with every circumstaunce
And herewythal for joy woo or sm^^te
What thou love to love with all mine heart
Thy precepte grant eke that I may
Fulfylle also both erly and late
In such manner as most is to thy pay
Benygne lord and make me for to hate
Mankyndes foo for he maad first debate
In kind of man and made him to trespace
Against the and to lose his grace
And lord grant me for thy mercy dygne
Above al thing for to have mekenes
And make me humble sufferaunt and benygne
With patience and Inward myldenesse
Of al virtues give me eke largeness
To be acceptyd the to queme and serve
To find only thy grace I may deserve
And also lord with quakyng heart and dread
Mekely I pray unto thy dey tee
Me for to grant of thy godlihede
The gracious our for to abide and see
In which the holy chosen maiden free
In to this world here after shall be bore
Like as prophets has written here before
How that she shall by thyn eleccion
Be maid and mother to thy sone dear
Now good lord here mine oryson
To keep mine eyes and my sight entyere
That I may see her holy halowyd chere
Her sakerid beauty and holy countynaunce
If thou of grace list me so much auaunce
And keep mine erys that they may also
Here her speech and her dallyaunce
And with my tongue speak that maiden unto
Patiently through her sufferaunce
Of worldly Joy this were suffysaunce
And her to love like as I desire
Benygne lord so set mine heart afyre
And lord also on me save thou vouche
Though I thereto have no wordynesse
That holy maid to handyl and touch
Mine own lady and my maystresse
And that I may with humble buxumnesse
Upon my feet in all my best wise
Goo unto her for to do seruyse
And to that flower of vyrgynyte
Grant also lord that I may have space
Mekely to bow and knele upon my knee
Under supporte only of her grace
And to honor the goodly young face
Of her sone as she does him wrappe
In clothys soft l^ggyng in her lap
And love him best plainly to my last
Wi^h al mine heart and mine hole seruyse
Withouten change while my life may last
Right as thy self lord can best deuyse
So that I may in faithful humble wise
In all this world no more grace attain
Than love him best with all my might and pain
And to thy grace also lord I pray
To grant me to fulfille in deed
Holy the statutes and mekely to obey
Within the temple as I here hem read
For but thou help I may no thing speed
As of my life and therefore unto the
All I committee as thou list it be
The obseruauncee and the preceptis all
That to thy temple ^ lord ben partynent
So let thy grace by mercy on me fall
That I may do hem with all mine hole entente
And every byddyng and co^maundeyeent
That thy mynystres assygnen unto me
Make me fulfille with al humylite
And thy temple and thy holy house
Benygne lord keep me from al damage
And make thy people to be virtuous
To thy plesaunce of every manner age
The for to serve with heart and hoole courage
And where they err / lord on any side
Or thou do right let mercy be her guide
And thus this maid alwey day by day
In the temple makith her prayeris
To plese god what she can or may
The chyef resort of al her desires
Till she attain to fourtene yeris
With heart auowyd both in thought and deed
For to continue in her maydenhede
Of whose intent god wot full un war
Weren so^me of them that in the temple abide
Of which a bishop called abyathar
Cast him fully for to / set a side
Her purpoos plainly and so for to provide
That her auowe maad of chastyte
Should not hold but utterly that she
Should be weddid sothely if he might
Unto his sone of high affeccion
For that she in every wyghtes sight
So passing good of condition
And to fulfille his entencion
Abyathar byhoteth gold and ^ente
To the bisshoppi^ to make her to assente
To this purpose and to her they gone
And what they may they began her excite
And to afferme to her euerichone
With sugrid tungys of many words white
That god above does him more delight
In birthe of children than in virgynyte
Or any such auowyd chastity
And more in children is honored in certain
And more in hem has he his plesaunce
Than in such as ben not but b^rayn
Without fruit through mysgouernaunce
And holy writ makith remembrance
That no man was sothely for to tell
Without seed blessid in Israelle
To whom anon with look down cast and chere
Benygnely and in full humble wise
This holy maid said as ye shullen here
Certes ad she if ye well you auyse
Which in your self so prudent ben and wise
And well aduerte in your discressyoune
That a ^el sometime had a dowbyl croune
One for his faithful true sacrefise
Offering to god of humble heart and free
And another as I shall deuyse
(...) his body kept in chastyte
And Ely eke as ye may read and see
For (...) in heart was a maiden clean
He was reuysshed above the sterris seuene
Body and all in a chare of fire
For ^e him kept from al corrupcion
Therefore in vain is plainly your desire
To speak with me of this opinion
For god well knows mine entencion
How I have vowyd as it to him is couthe
To be a maid fro my tendyr youth
And al my life so forth to persevere
For life or death only for his sake
From which purpoos shall I not disseuere
Through his grace whether I sleep or wake
To keep and hold I have undertake
My maydenhede sithen goo full yore
Ageyn which ne spekith to me no more
And when they saw her heart not mutable
But ever steadfast of one affeccion
And ever eliche as any center stable
They have made a conuocacion
Of all the kynredes in conclusion
The eight day for to come in fere
By one assent to trete of this matere
This is to say that of old usage
Of custom keep for a memorialle
That every maid of fourtene year of age
Rich and pour of the stock ryall
In the temple no longer dwell shall
But by statute shall be take and married
By the law and no l^ngyr tarried
And when they were assemblid al in one
Isacar in opyn audyence
Began to pronounce before hem euerichone
Full prudently the so^me of his sentence
And said sires with your patience
So hit your ^ris offend not ne grieve
Declare I shall my menyng with your leave
If ye remember sithen salamon the king
Of Israel ceptre bare and crown
In this temple so ryal in byldyng
Have young maidens by deuysion
Of custom had her conversation
Both kings daughters and prophyces eke
As ye may find if ye list to seek
But to the age of fourtene year
Abyden here and no longer of space
As ye well know withouten any were
And than be remeuyd from her place
And in her stead other did pace
As custom was and each in her lynage
Delyuerd was unto marriage
And as a law hit has be kept full true
Unto this time in high and low estate
But now marie has fond an order new
To keep her clean and Inuyolate
A ^enst which there helpith no debate
For of fre chose and hertely volunte
She has to god auowed chastyte
Wherefore me seems it were well sittyng
To her purpose by good discressyon
First that we might fully have knowing
Of goddis will in this opinion
For then hit were a more perfeccion
Her clean entente as semyth unto me
And eke the strenger of auctorite
First that we might know verayly
To whose keeping she shall committed be
And they assenten herto verayly
Withouten more of high or low degree
And of accord and of one unity
The prestes al begonnen to proceed
To cast ^ette down by each kynrede
The which lotte on Judah fyl anon
As (...) through goddis purueaunce
And (...) hem euerichone
Purpos^ (...) new ordinance
That (...) of that allyaunce
That (...) withouten more delay
Should (...) a yerde again the next day
And to the bishop highest of echone
Every (...) of hem did his yerde bring
Among which Joseph had brought one
Though he were old and passion his likynge
And he anon maao his offering
To god above and a sacrefyse
In the old law such as was the guyse
And god to him then did appear
And with the yerdis bad that he should goon
And put them euerichoon in fere
In sancta sanctorum liggyng one by one
And in the morrow to come ageyn echone
Eueriche his yerde to receive ageyn
And upon which yerde only were seyn
A down appear and up to heaven flee
He shall have without more obstacle
Marye in keeping so fair upon to see
As it is right for the high miracle
And when they come to the tabernacle
As ye have herd the bishop deuoutely
Eueriche his yerde delyuerd by and by
But utterly upon none them of all
At thylke time was there no thing seyn
For gods heste was naught ye y fall
Of her desire to put hem in certain
Wherefore the bishop with new fire again
Entryd is in to the seyntuarye
And while that he a while there began tarry
Goddis aungel apperid to him new
Down fro heaven by miracle sent
And told plainly the best of god was true
But how him self was somewhat necligent
For to deliver by commandment
Every man his yerde as be ought
And when the bishop aright him bethoughte
He began remember plainly in his mind
That of disdain and wylful necligence
The yerde of Joseph was left behind
Whereby he knew that he h^d done offense
And began anon to bring hit in presence
And took hit Joseph devoutly in his hand
Among hem al there they did stand
Al behind disseueryd from the prees
With humble chere in the lowest place
And of this yerde in manner recheles
Full stylle of poorte with a dreedful face
And when he did with his hand enbrace
His yerde ageyn full debonayr of look
For Innocence of humble dread he quoke
And suddenly through grace above deuyne
All openly in every wyghtes sight
Upon the yerde of Joseph full benygne
Was seen a down of fetheris lyly whight
That toward heaven took the flight
And with one voys the people tho abrayde
And unto Joseph al attones said
Bl^ssed art thou and blissed is thy chance
Thy face blessed and thyn adventure
And blessid is thyn humble attendaunce
And thou art blessed so long tendure
For to ^ossede so fair a creature
So good so holy now in thy passing age
So clean a maid to have in marriage
And she anon by preestis of the law
Assigned was unto his governance
But sely Joseph began him to withdraw
With humble chere and shamefast countenance
And said certes there is none accordaunce
Between her yongthe florisshyng in fayrnesse
And me whom age with unlust does oppress
For she is fair and fresshe as rose in may
And well I wot also a maiden clean
And I am old with whyt lockis graye
Passid full for my tendyr yer^s grene
Wherefore I pray you to consydre and seen
To accord discordaunt says to me no more
Bitwene her beauty and my lockis hoar
And when the bishop saw the humble intent
Of this Joseph and the Innocence
And how that he to take her nolde assent
To him he said in opyn audyence
Joseph he said take heed to my sentence
And be well ware that thou the not excuse
Again the will of god for to refuse
This holy maid assigned unto the
By opyn sign which all the people seye
Thorough goddis grace and mighty volunte
Against which bewaar to dssobeye
And think how he sometime maad to deye
A biron and dathan only for the offense
Done to him of Inobedyence
Quod Joseph that will I not in no thing
To goddis will ne biddyng contrayre
But her accept in to my keeping
For whom god has showed signs fair
Which is so good benygne and debonayr
That I to her will servant be and guide
Till for her god list bet to preuyde
And as the custom of the law hem ^onde
So maad was the confirmacion
By heste of wedlok between hem hand in hand
And he her took to his possessyon
With heart clean and meke affeccion
But while he went to bethelem the cite
Marye abode stylle in galilee
How Joseph vsyd the craft of a carpenter capitulo ix
aT nazareth in her faders how
Like her auowe of heart alwey in one
And five maidens the most virtuous
Of the temple were chosen out anon
Of the bishop with her for to goone
To wait on her by humble attendaunce
In what they can to serve and do plesaunce
Of which the first called was reyca
And S^eph^a the secund as I find
Susanna Zabe^ and Abigea
The other three as books maken mind
Which would never through sloth be behind
But ay in one as it is specefyed
In work and prayer were ocupyed
And unto hem as made is mention
That of living so faithful weren and true
And diligent in occupacion
Delyuerd was sylke of sundry hew
For to make diverse werkis new
In the temple of Intencion
Only to be in mynystracion
And as it is put in remembrance
Eueriche her silk took by adventure
Like as her hand fyl the^on by chance
But mary as god tho shope her ewre
The purpyl silk took in to her cure
Of gracious hap of sort without sight
The which color of custom and of right
To none estate is kyndely syttyng
Of doubt to speak in special
But to the state only of a king
So that no wight but of the stock ryal
By statute old this color use shall
For by old time ye should no man seen
In purpyl cladde but owther king or queen
Wherefore the sort full rightfully is fall
Verily by dew dispocision
Upon marye that before hem all
By ligne right is discendyd down
Of blood ryalle and by eleccioun
Of god above was chosyn for to been
For her merit of heaven and earth queen
And mother eke as ye shall after here
Of thylke king that was clad in tred
Of purpur hew both face and chere
Down to the foot from his blessed b^ed
When he of purpyl did his baner sprede
On caluarye abrood upon the ^^ode
To save mankind when he shed his blood
And of this purpyl that I spoke of to^orne
I find plainly how that marye wroughte
Tyilke veil that was on tweyne torn
The same our when he so dear us boughte
Lo how that god in his eternal thought
Provided has by Just purueaunce
The purpyl silk to his moders chance
How our lady is set for an ensaunple of virgynyte capitulo decimo
But now I leave this blissed maid dear
In nazareth among her frendis to dwell
Ledyng a life more purfyt and entere
Than any tongue suffyse may to tell
For even like as a fulsum well
Shedyth his stremys in to the ryuere
Right so marie an ensaumpeler clear
Yaffe to all by plenteuous largenes
Only virtue upon every side
O well were they to whom thou were maistres
And blessed eke that might on the abide
To have by ensaumple so virtuous a gyde
And blessid was that holy company
That day by day the seen with her eye
And blessid was the paleys and the hows
In which thou haddist thy holy ma^cion
Fortuned well and wonder gracious
So humb^e was thy conuersacioun
And blessed was also all the town
There thou abode and blessid the vyllage
O holy maid where thou had hostage
And blessid was the worthy table rich
Where day by day thou wentist unto board
For in sothnes the joy was not lyche
Of Cresus king for all his rich horde
And blessid be they that herden word by word
Of thy speech and blessed the hour and time
Of al thy life from even till the pryme
O weelful eke and gracious the sight
Of hem that myghten upon the behold
For well they ought to be glad and light
That weren with the alwey when they would
And blessid weren young and old
That were reioysed with thy excellence
When that hem l^st of thy high presence
O the Joy who could tell a right
Of thyn heavenly meditacions
Assendyng up above the sterris bright
In thyn Inward contemplacions
Or the blessid and holy visitayons
Who can reherce bright as son or leuene
So often sent down to the fro heuene
Or who can tell thyn holy slepys soft
With god alwey full in thy memory
For love of whom thou sighedyst full often
When thou were soole in thyn oratorye
Or who can tell the melodye or glory
That aungelys has maad in the place
For the joy they had to look in thy face
I am rude to rehersen all
For vnkonnyng and for lack of space
The matter is so Inly spiritual
That I dare not so high a style pace
But lady mine I put me al in thy grace
This first book compylid for thy sake
Of my symplenesse and thus an end I make
Besechyng al to have pity and routh
That thereof shall have any Inspeccion
If ought be left of necligens and slouthe
Or said to much of presumpsion
I put hit mekely to hi^ correccion
And axe mercy of my trespace
There as I err and put me in her grace
And through her benygne supportacion
So as I can forth I will proceed
With all mine heart and hoole entencion
Prayeng that maid of so goodlyhede
Croppe and rote to help in this need
Whom I now leave in nazareth soiorne
And to my matter I will again return
How mercy and pees rightwysnes and truth disputeden for the redemption of
mankind capitulo vndecimo
wHo that is bound and fetterid in prison
Thinks long after delyueraunce
And he that felith pain and passion
Desires sore after allegeaunce
And who that is in sorrow and penance
Lytyl wondre of hertely heaviness
Though he coueyte relees of his distress
And who that lives in langour and in woo
For in exyle and prescripcion
And is withsette with many a cruel foo
And can no geyne to his sauacion
To escape death without great raunson
Full long he thinks of full lityl space
While he in bonds abides after grace
And yet to record of old felicite
In sothfastnes encresith more his pain
Than all the constraynte of his aduersite
And causith him more to syghe and plain
For joy passyd can hertys more constrayne
Her welthe before to bewepe and wayle
Than all the torment that hem does assail
O who could ever since the world bygan
Of more joy or of gladnoe tell
Than sometime could the worthy kind of man
That shapen was in paradyse to dwell
Till he alas was banysshed in to hell
Fer in exyle from his possessioun
And there to abide stockid in prison
And he has lost his riches and honor
His myrthe his joy and his old welfare
His force his might and holy his socour
And was of virtue nakyd made and bare
And lay full seek languysshyng in care
So fer proscripte out of his contre
That by the law there may no recover be
Whose neck oppressid with so strong a c^ene
Lay plunged down without remedy
That when mercy would have been amene
Rightwysnes began hit anon deny
And when that pees for recover began to cry
Came troth forth with a stern face
And said plainly that he get no grace
For pees and mercy to gyder assemblid were
Full long agone to trete of this matere
And rightwysnes with hem was eke there
And troth also with a deynous chere
And when they were al four in fere
As ye have herd and began to entrete
Than first of al cruelly to threte
Troth began almost in a rage
Of cruel Ire and of malencolye
And said shortly that man for his outrage
Of very right must needs deye
And thus began the contrauersye
Between the susteryn and troth alwey in one
Said plainly that recover was there none
For I quod troth at his creacion
Told him the parel before his offense
But he me put out of his ^^ndon
And yaue to me no manner audyence
And I quod right al my dyligence
Would him have rewlyd but he took none head
Wherefore of me he get none help at need
And when he gaf credence to the snake
He made his quarrel even against right
And again troth he falsely began to take
When he her clean put out of his sight
And again pees began a quarrel to sight
When he from him mercy set aferre
And so he set him self al out of herre
Therefore quod right pletith for him no more
But let him have as he has deseruyd
Ye do great wrong if ye will him restore
That has his heste to you not conseruyd
A yis quod mercy nature has reseruyd
To pees my suster ylaynly and to me
On wretches ever for to have pity
And offendyth has of ignorance
More than of malice ywys quoth mercy tho
Yet for all that he must have his penance
Quod right anon like as he has do
And think quod pees that toward Ierico
He was disposid among his cruel foon
For lack of help when he left him allone
That was quoth troth for he was recheles
To goo the way y taught him of reason
Quod mercy than the mortal foo of pees
The old serpent rote of al tresoun
Of false envy and Indygnacion
Lay a wait to bring him in a train
When he to him falsely did feign
That if he ete of the forboden tree
The fair faite in paradyse present
He should like unto god be
Of good and evil to have entendement
And for my suster troth was absent
And ye your self also rightwysnes
He was betrayed slightly by falsenes
Wherefore quod mercy I purpose vttertye
Him to releue if I can or may
And I quod pees will help faythfullye
The great ire and rancour to allaye
Of Judgment to put it in delay
And here upon to find full refuge
I will proceed before the hye Judge
How mercy and pees brought in this plee before the high Judge capitulo xij
aNd right forthwith before the king of glory
Mercy and pees the cause brought anon
And in the high heavenly consistorye
Pees said thus among hem euerichone
O blessed lord that art both three and one
So plese hit the benygnely to here
What I will say and my suster dear
Remember lord among thy werkis all
How thou made mercy soueraygne
That when that ever unto the she call
Thou may not of right her prayer disdaigne
And specially when that we both twain
To thyn hyghnes for any thing require
Thou mude of grace fulfille our prayere
Is not thy mercy great above the heaven
Thyn own daughter cheef of thyn alye
And has her place above the sterris seven
With the ordris of every Ierarchye
Whom day by day thou can so magnefye
Among thy werkis to make her emperesse
To help wretchis when they ben in distress
Thy mercy eke abydith ever with the
Like thy gretnesse and thy magnyficence
And who that does mercy and pytre
Does sacrefise high in thy presence
And is not mercy of more excellence
Like as the sauter well reherce can
Upon the earth than the life of man
Thy self also as it is plainly couthe
Auysedly who so takith head thereto
Say opynly with thyn owen mouth
That to a thousand thou can thy mercy do
And holy dauyd recordith eke also
With his harp above al thing
That he thy mercyes eternally shall sing
And how might eke any creature
Upon earth in any manner kind
Without mercy any while endure
For all were goon if mercy were behind
Wherefore lord on mercy have thy mind
The wooful caytyf to take unto thy grace
That has so long ^e seuerid fro thy face
And though that I be humble meke and free
Forsothe lord of duete and of right
Yet ever in one my dwelling is with the
For selde or never I part out of thy sight
Peace is my name that power has and might
Through my kunnyng they that be mortal foone
By the help of the to accord in to one
And also lord as holy writ can tell
That of thy pees there may none end be
And eke thy pees does euety wight excelle
And art thy self of very duete
Called the prince of pees and unity
And yet byhotest wretchis to releue
That is mankind and shall neu^r fro hem meue
And Ioob records the holsomest fruit
Of al this world spryngeth out of pees
Now lord sithen I am maad to be refuyte
And to the wooful comfort and encrees
Grant of thy grace now a full relees
That I and mercy may the ^oon confound
Of thylke caytyf that lies in prison bound
So that he may have lyberte
To goo at large and have remyssyon
Of this thraldom and captyuyte
And be delyuerd out of this prison
So that there may be made redempsion
For his seruage and fynal pay
Lord of thy mercy without more delay
And when they had her matter full purposid
Mercy and pees with full high sentence
Touching man with sin so enclosid
The Judge gaf benygne audyence
And when he had kept long scilence
For all the skilles to him that they laid
Yet at the last to hem thus he said
How god the fader of heuyn answered to mercy and pees capitulo xiij
Mine own daughter next to mine alye
Though your request come of tendyr heart
Ye must consider with a prudent eye
Of rightwysnes it may not me asterte
Like your axyng by favor to aduerte
Unto the cause that ye represent
But right and troth fully would assente
Withouten whom I may not proceed
To execute any manner Judgment
Wherefore let call her in this great need
For I mote worche by her auysement
And when they weren come and present
Than troth anon touching this matere
Said opynly that al myghten here
If hit so be this man that trespaced
Ne be not deed for his Inyquyte
Though utterly the fraunchesse is defaced
Both of my suster rightwysnes and me
And finally our both lyberte
Goes unto naught of our Iurisdiccion
But he be punysshed for his transgressyon
The word of god that plainly may not err
Told him before withouten any dread
The great parelle of this mortal war
Etyng the appyl that he must be deed
But he of sloth took thereto none head
Wherefore he must as right lust provide
Withouten mercy the dome of death abide
And though that pees be of pity meuyd
Man to deliver with a zeel of routh
Rightwysnes would than be agreuyd
With me to consent that am called truth
And as me semyth it were to great a slouthe
Dome or cause plee or any suit
Withouten us tweyne to be execute
Me semyth eke my suster pees does wrong
To foster a man and hold against us twain
That has been conuersaunt so long
Among us discord to restrain
Therefore quod pees now will I not feign
To do mine office right to modefye
That she of rygour cause him not to dye
Than quod right of necessyte
Hit must follow though he were my brother
That he must deye by dome of equity
Or in his name mote be deed so^me other
So of my ship guyed is the rother
That ne may err for wawe ner for wyn^e
More than the anchor of troth will me bind
Certes quod mercy so it not dysplese
Unto your noble and wise prouydence
His death to you may be lityl ese
For holy writ rehercith in sentence
If you consydere in your aduertence
That death of sinners the high god to quen^e
Is werst of dethis if ye of right list dem^
For synful blood is no sacrefyse
To god above that every thing may seen
Than must ye the death of one deuyse
That is of sin Innocent and clean
And is I trow under the son shene
Through the world to reherce al mankind
It were full hard such one for to find
For rust with rust may not scouryd be
Ne foul with fylth may be purefyed
But who is soyl^d with dyshoneste
To wasshe another it is not aplyed
Black unto white may not be dyed
Ne blood enfect with corrupcion
To god for sin is none oblacion
Figure hereof ye may behold and see
As the bible makyth mention
How that a lamb of spotte and fylthe fere
Sometime was take by eleccion
And offryd up in satisfaccion
To god for sin for to signefye
Who should for mannys raunsom dye
Must be clean pure and Innocent
Right as a lamb from every spotte and blame
And trewly under the firmamente
There was none such sithen adam did atame
The fruit to ete for either halte or lame
In souerayn virtue is all the kind of man
Wherefore quoth mercy the best read that I can
That pees my sister cese this discord
And all the stryf that is us between
And that we pray our Judge and mighty lord
To this matter benygnely to seen
And of his grace to shape such a mean
For troth and right so prudently ordeygne
That pees ne I have no cause to pleyne
And this request is naught against right
Ne unto troth plainly none offense
If that our Judge of his great might
Ordeyne so in his prouydence
To scare aweye through his sapyence
That troth and right be not displesid
Through pees and me though man be help and easid
How the fader of heuyn accordyd the four systren capitulo xiiij
aNd when that she by reason had fined
That groundyd was plainly upon skylle
The high Judge by mercy is enclyned
To condescende of grace to her will
And in such wise her axyng to fulfille
That right be served and truth not dysmayed
That pees and she shullen eke be well apayed
And by sentence anon diffynyt if
The Judge said for conclusion
In Innocent pure and clean of life
Shall mekely dye to pay the raunson
For mannys gylt and transgressyon
And he so freely shall the death abeye
In all his pain that he no word shall seye
And thus shall right in all manner thing
Have her desire and troth shall not fail
But agreably in their worchyng
To execute fully to stynte this batayl^
And for that pees in much may avail
And mercy eke shall not be agreuyd
Her brother axyng also shall be achyeuyd
To find a man that shall undertake
This mighty quarrel of mercy and pity
To suffer death only for mannys sake
Vncompellyd freely and of volunte
That is a lamle withouten spotte shall be
And with his blood shall wesshe vndefouled
The gylt of man with rust of sin y mouled
How his sone should take mankind capitulo xv
But for to wete of what stock be shall spryng
Of what kynrede and of what estate
My sothfast word eternally living
Mine own sone with me Increa^e
Shall down be sent to be Incarnate
And wrappe him self in the mortal kind
Of man for love so that he may find
A clean ground his palayce unto bylde
In all the earth neither of lyme ne stone
But in a maid debonayr and mylde
The humble daughter of Judah and syon
And unto her shall truth and mercy goon
By one accord sent before my face
Like my deuyse to chese me a place
And say to her in all manner thing
Her tabernacle that she make feyre
Against the coming of her mighty king
Which is my sone and mine own heir
That in her breast shall have his repeyre
Where troth and mercy shall to gyder mete
By one assent and her rancour let
And there shall pees kiss rightwysnes
And all the susteris accord in that place
And right shall leave al her stourdynes
And trewthis sword shall no more manace
And finally mercy shall purchase
A chartour of pardon like this maiden clean
And which for man is so good a mean
That he shall mow escape dangers
A myd the forest free from every trappe
While the maid that causith all this pees
Has the unicorn slepyng in her lap
That through mekenes shall his horn so wrappe
There it was wont to slay by vyolence
Through does it shall ageyn does ^e defense
Against venym more holsom than treacle
Every poison asofte and aswage
When the lion makith his habytacle
Within a maid but of tendir age
And gabriel shall goon on message
To her anon mine own secretarye
With new tidings and no longer tarry
How gabryel the Aungel was sent to our lady capitulo xvj
aNd right forthwith the aungel tar^eth naught
But held his way from the sea of glory
Unto this maid clean in will and thought
Where as she sat in her oratorye
With heart ententyf and with hole memory
Great to god and al her full mind
To whom the aungel when he did her find
Benygnely with all humylite
Said unto her anon as ye shullen here
Hayle full of grace our lord is with the
Ne dread the not but be right glad of chere
That art to god so acceptable and dear
That holy his grace is upon the fall
To be most blessed among wymmen all
And with that word through goddis might
Al hole the sum of the deyte
That from heuyn his blisful bemys bright
Shadde on ther^he of our humanyte
When in the breast of a maiden free
The holy ghoost by free eleccion
For her mekenes has made his mancion
For when that bernard sometime began behold
With thought up lift by contemplacion
The bright son in heart he began to cold
Inly astoned in his aspeccion
And full devoutly in a medi^acion
Thereof remembryng as he began take heed
Said even thus quakyng in a dread
A lamentacion of saint bernard cayitulo xvij
a Lord quod he so I am agrysed
And sore a drad to look on this clerenesse
And yet well more with fere I am supprised
For to behold for mine unworthiness
Any word to write or to express
Of this mystery and great pryuyte
Benygne lord lest thou say to me
What art thou bold or darist in any wise
My rightwysnes to tell or to write
Or to presume so hardely to deuyse
My testament with thy mouth endyte
That certes lord but if thou respyte
My wretchidnes by supporte of thy grace
I gretely dread of death for my trespace
But would god through his great might
And his goodness like to my desire
That from thaulter that brennyth in his sight
No litel sparcle but a flame of fire
Would down dissende mine heart to enspyre
For to consume with his fervent hete
The rusty filthe that in my mouth does flete
And al uncleanness cankerid there of old
To make clean and to scour away
That through his grace I durst be so bold
Other to write or sum word to say
That was rehercid upon the blisful day
When gabriel and marie met
In nazareth and humbly her grette
But sithen this man so parfyt of living
This holy bernard so good and gracious
So dreedful was this matter in writynge
That was of life so Inly virtuous
How dare I than be presumptuous
I wooful wretch in any manner wise
To take on me this parfyt high emprise
My lippis pollute my mouth with sin y soyled
Mine heart unclean and full of cursidness^
My thought also with al vices foiled
My breast receyte and cheste of wretchidnesse
That me to write of any parfitnesse
Not only dread of presumpsion
But for to eschew the Indignacion
Of god above for my great offense
That I am bold or hardy in his sight
To dar presume the great excellence
For to descryue of her that was so brigh
But under hope that mercy passith right
And that disdain my style not veraye
With humble heart thus to him I pray
A recapitulacion of the words of gabriel to our lady how holy men by deuyne
liknessis wrote of our lady in co^mendacion of her ca xviij
o Lord whose mercy goth not to declyne
But ever eliche stondyth hoole in one
That sometime sendist down frum seraphyne
To Ysaye an aungel with a stone
Wherwyth he began to touch his mouth anon^
To purge his lippis from al pollucion
So let thy grace to me descend down
My rude tunge to explite and speed
Somewhat to say in co^mendacion
Of her that is well of womanhede
And through her help and meditacion
Be to my style full dyreccion
And let thy grace alwey be present
This book to forther after mine entende
For of my life for to undertake
To speak or write in so devout matere
Lytyl wonder though I tremble or quake
And change both countenance and chere
Sithen this maiden of virtue tresorere
Perturbyd / was in look and in vysage
Of gabriel to here the message
And full demurely stylle began abide
And in her heart castyng up and down
Full prudently upon every side
The manner of this salutacion
And how hit might in conclusion
In any wise fully performed be
She stondyng hole in her virgynyte
And when the aungel saw her lowlyhede
He^ humble countenance changed in her face
He said marye for no thing that you dread
For tofore god thou have found grace
And shall conceive within a lityl space
And in thy womb a sone of al virtue
And shall him call when he is borne Ihesu
That shall be great and named sothfastlye
Sone of the highest that ever was of might
And god to him shall give full Iustlye
The sea of dauyd his own faders right
And he shall reygne in every wyghtes sight
In the hows of Jacob eternally by ligne
Whose kingdom ever shall last and never fine
And though his heste were passing of renown
Surmountyng eke as in excellence
That vtwardly yaf so meruaylous a sown
And wonderful to her audyence
Then she full mekely of great reverence
And look down cast of her eyes clear
Benygnely the aungel began enquere
In what manner shall this thing betyde
Sithen I no man know in no degree
Quod gabriel within thy blessed side
The holy ghoost shall I shrowdyd be
And all the virtue of the trynyte
Enclose shall in thy breast so clean
The son of life with al his bemys shen^^
Wherefore this child that shall of the be borne
Shall called be goddis sone eterne
Behold and see a litel her toforne
Elysabeth thyn own cosyn dear
Conceived has sithen goon half year
Though she for age went to have been barayn
And is with child to put al in certain
That to god is no thing Inpossyble
But as him list may every thing fulfill^
Unto whose word be fully now credyble
Byholde quod she of god the meke aualle
With all mine heart obeyeng to his will
In every thing right as him list it be
And like thy word fall it unto me
Lo she that was chosyn for to been
Of all this world lady and emper^sse
Of heuyn and earth allone to be queen
And goddys mother for her holiness
Lo for all this how lowly with mekenes
She al commytteth unto goddis will
As he ordeyneth ready to fulfille
And would not call her self none other name
But goddis handmayde in full low manner
O where is all the transitorye fame
Where is your boste or daren you apere
Of pomp or pride or surquedrye in fere
With your forblowe blowyng vanyte
Sithen that a maid through her humylite
Of pride has now won the victory
And opynly has yeuyn him a fall
Through whose lowlynes the high king of glory
Within her womb has made in special
His dwelling place and his hospytal
And with one word of the maid I spoke
The holy ghoost is in her breast yloke
A co^mendacion of our lady capitulo xix
aNd wha^ thaungel from her departed was
And she allone in her tabernacle
Right as the son perisshith through the glass
Through the cristalle beralle or spectacle
Without harm / right so by miracle
In to her closet the faders sapyence
Entrid is wythouten vyolence
Or any wemme unto her maydenhede
On any side in party or in all
For goddis sone taking our manhede
In her has bylde his paleys pryncypalle
And under pyght this mancion ryalle
With seven pylers as made is memory
And therm set his reclynatorye
Which is performed al of pure gold
Only to us for to signefy^
That he al holy maad has his hold
Within this maid that called is marye
And seven pylers that sholden this maid gye
Ben seven spirits so as I can disserne
Of god above this maid to govern
For all the tresour of his sapyence
And all the wisdom of heaven and earth thereto
And all the richesse of spiritual science
In her were shytte and closid eke also
For she is the toure without words moo
And house of yuore in which Salamon
Shitte al his tresour in his possessyon
She was the castle of the cristal wall
That never man might yet unclose
In which the king that maad and causes all
His dwelling chyef by grace began dispose
And like as dew discendyth on the rose
With silver dropys and of the leuys fair
The fressh beaulte ne might not pair
Ne as the rain in aprille or in may
Causes the virtue to run out of the rote
The great fayrnes naught appeyte may
On vyolettis and on herbys soote
Right so this grace of al our greuys boot
The grace of god amyd the belly whyt
The beauty causith to be of more delight
And as the cokyle with heavenly dew so clean
Of kind engendrith white perlys round
And has no cherisshyng but the sun shene
To his fosteryng as hit is plainly found
Right so this maid of grace most habounde
A peerle has closid within her brestys white
That from the death might al our raunson quyte
She was eke the gate of the lockis bright
Set in the north of high devotion
Of which sometime the prophet had a sight
Ezechyel as is writon in his auysyon
Which stood ever cloos in conclusion
That never man enter shall ne pace
But god him self to make his dwelling place
And yet in sothe as I reherde can
So as the flees of geddon was wette
Tofore he fauhgt with hem of madyan
With heavenly dew enuyron al be set
In sign only he speed shall the bette
Right so has god on her his grace showed
With the holy ghoost when she was bydewyd
In token plainly she should socour be
Unto mankind manly for to fight
Again the devil that has in his pouste
Al madyan with his fell might
And through the help of this maiden bright
And through the dew of her heavenly grace
We shall this serpent from our lands chase
She was also of gold the ry^he vrne
Keeping the man of our sauacion
That al our woo may to joy turn
With holsom food and full perfeccion
She was also as scripture makes mention
The yerde of aaron with fruit and leuys lade
Of virtue most to comfort us and glade
She was the aultre of cedre gold and stone
Steadfast and true in perfeccion
And as the cedre conseruyng ay in one
His body clean from al corrupcion
And for to make a full oblacion
Of every virtue to god in chastyte
She shone as gold by parfyt charity
And on this altar she made her sacrefyse
With fire of love brennyng as bright
To god and man in every manner wise
As don the sterris on the frosty night
Her frankensence yaue so clear a light
Through good ensaumple that the parfyt leuene
Of her living raught in to heuene
She was the trone where that Salamon
For worthynes set his ryal see
With gold and yuore that so bright shone
That al about the beauty men might see
The gold was love / the yuore chastyte
And twelve lions so great huge and large
That of this work bare up the charge
Of the old law weren prophets twelve
That long before began behold and see
That Salamon goddis sone him selue
Should in this maid behold his ryal see
So that in soth her clean virgynyte
To be a mother should no thing let
Amyd her breast that he his trone set
She was the woman that saint John
Saw in heaven so richely appear
Cladde in a sun which brighter shone
Than phoebus does in his long spear
And twelve sterris that passyngly were clear
So as to him plainly did seem
Weren set above in her dyademe
And as him thought at her feet there stood
A large moan bright and no thing pale
In figure only that she that is so good
To swage the bitter of our old bale
The sun of life maad to auale
Down to the earth to govern us and guy^
And eke the moon to us does signefye
Al holy church large to behold
Within this maid had his orygynal
When finally with his rightes old
The synagoge of Iewys had a fall
For in this maid the first faithful wall
Of holy church god began first to bylde
When with his sone he made her goo with child
And to reform the rudenes utterly
Of blind folkis that could not parceyue
How that marie might kyndlye
A maid be and a child conceive
That if him list reason to conceive
They may exaumples right y now find
Of this matter according unto kind
Autentyke conclusions against vnbeleeful men that sayden that crist might not
be borne of a maid capitulo xx
o Blind man through thyn Inyquyte
Why have thou lost thy reason and thy sight
That thou of malice list not for to see
How christ Ihesu through his great might
To his dyscyples held the way right
Through the yatis y shytte by great deffence
Without brekyng or any vyolence
Who might he not of his magnyficence
Within a maid make his mancion
And she yet stood in high excellence
Of maydenhede from al corrupcion
Ye ben to blind in your discressyon
That list not to see also how he roos
From death to life in his sepulture cloos
And here withal thou may also aduerte
How he full graciously of his mighty grace
Made peter out of prison to sterte
And where him list freely for to pace
And yet the doors were shytte of the place
What wonder than though god by miracle
Within a maid made his habytacle
And being cloos and parfytly shytte
With all the bonds of clean virgynyte
For sothfastly her clennesse was not let
Upon no side ne yet her chastyte
But encresyd and favor for to see
That gods sone list to light adoun
Within this maid to make his mancion
Eke hildefons tellyth of a tree
Instead of faite heri^h byrdys small
From year to year by kind as men may see
Without medlyng of female or of male
This verily is soth plainly and no tale
Tha^ wondre not though crist were borne bitwene
The chaste sides of a maiden clean
Eke certain birds called vultures
Without medlyng conceyuyn by nature
As books sayn withouten any lees
And of her life an hundred year endure
Than the lord of every creature
That causes al no wonder though I say
Though that he were conceyuyd of a may
And plunyus in books naturalle
Write of a roche great and large also
That will remove with a finger small
But if a man do al his might thereto
It will not stere neither to ne fro
Right so this maid that is of virtue most
With a finger of the holy ghooste
And with a touch of his mighty grace
Conseruyd has steadfast god and man
That never might remove from her face
Of thylke auowe that she first began
To be a maid as forforth as she can
In heart and will as any roche stable
That from his ground is not remouable
This clerk also this wise plunius
Seyth in tauriche there is an earth found
That of nature is so virtuous
That will cure every manner wound
Right so marie was the earth found
That god out choos by eleccion
To bear the fruit of our redemption
That should be health and also medecyne
To al our wounds when they ache or smerte
And our greuys and our hurtis fine
From death to make us to asterte
With holsom bawme percyng to the heart
Our festerid soris that they shul ache no more
Ne that she ne were we were al forbore
And ferthermore this auctour can eke tell
Within his book who so looks a right
To Iubyter sacryd is a well
That when it has queynte his brondes bright
That often again hit yeueth them a new light
Who list assaye soth as he shall find
What wonder than though the god of kind
Amyd this well from fylthe of sin cold
Full of virtue with fair stremys clear
His lodgyng took and his mighty hold
And through his grace set hit new afyre
With the holy ghoost that withouten were
Though she were cold from al flesshlyhede
She brent in love hotter than the glede
And in falisco as him list to write
Is a well that causes eke of new
When the oxen drink to be white
And suddenly to change her hew
What marvel than though the well true
The well of health and of life eterne
The lord of al so as I can disserne
Thise stremys shed in to this maid free
To make her whightest as in holiness
That both should maid and mother be
And ever in one / keep her clennesse
Withouten change so that her witness
Ne fades never in beauty ne in color
Of maydenhede to bear both leef and flower
And who that would dispute in this matere
I hold him mad or ellis out of mind
For if he have his eyes hoole and clear
He shall now see preef enough by kind
For he that made both leef and rynde
And with a word thise waste words wild
Might make a maid for to goo with child
And (...) that made the high cristal heaven
The firmament and also every spear
The goldyn axtree and the sterris seven
Cithera so lusty for to appear
And read marce with his stern chere
Might he not eke only for our sake
Within a maid of man the kind take
And he that causes fowls in the air
In her kind to wax and multeplye
And fysshe eke with fynnes si^^d fair
In deep wawes to govern hem and gye
And does one live and another dye
And geuyth bestys her fode upon the ground
And in his kind does hem to abound
Sithen he is lord and causes al thing
To have being if I shall not feign
And is the prince and the worthy king
That al enbracith in his mighty chain
Why might he not by power sovereign
At his free choys that al may save and lose
To his mother a clean maid chese
Who causes the fruit out of the hard tree
By virtue only that spryngeth from the rote
To grow and wexe ^^ke as men may see
With leuys grene and new blosmes soote
Is it not that lord that for all our bote
Would of a maid as I reherce can
Mekely be borne without touch of man
For he that does the tender branches spring
And fressh flowers in the great mede
That weren in winter / deed and eke droppyng
Of bawme void and of lustyhede
Might be not make his grain to grow and sede
Within her breast that was both maid and wife
Whereof is made the sothfast breed of life
And he that grauyd of his great might
Without poyntel in the hard stone
And the tabl^s with lettres clear and bright
His ten precepts and byldynges eurichone
The same lord of his power allone
Has made this maid here in earth bow
A child conceive and no man to know
And he that made the busshe to appear
Al on flame with fe^ly sparcles shene
And when moses began to approach nere
And yet no harm came to the bows grene
The same lord has conseruyd clean
His habytacle and his herber sweet
In this maid from al flesshly hete
And he that made the yerde of moses
Of a serpent to take the liknesse
In the halle among all the prees
Where pharao the people did oppress
And in deserte the bible beri^h / witness
The river made to run out of the stone
The thrist to staunche of the people anon
And over this for to verefye
His great might sampson the strong man
As Iudicum does plainly specefye
Drank the water that from the chanel ran
And he that made the flodys of Iurdan
To torn again for love of Iosue
That al his people clearly might see
And how wawes began a sondre break
And like an hylle to stand high on lofte
And he that made the ass to speak
To balaam for he rode so soft
Why might he not by power preuyd often
Sithen he the yren made in the water house
Be of a maid ^orne for mannys love
And he that made an aungel for to take
Abacuk the prophet by a lityll here
And suddenly bring him to the lake
In babylon which was so fere
And to visit liggyng in his fore
Danyel among the bestys rage
Till he to him brought the potage
The doris shitte of the strong prison
For to aswage of hunger al his pain
And in a moment to his mancion
Full suddenly restoryd him again
Why might he not as well in certain
The same lord of a maid than
Take flessh and blood and bycome man
And he that made the sun at gabaon
To stand and shine upon the bright shield
Of Iosue and toward achalon
The moon also as all the hooste beheld
The long day they faught in the field
Against the kings of mighty of amorre
That his people clearly might see
And he that made the shadew to return
In the orlage of king ezechy^
By ten degrees only to parfourme
By ^^ste^y made to him of ysaye
Why might he not that all this world shall gye
Of a maid by the same skylle
Freely he borne at his own will
And he that fed with five louys small
Five thousand in solytarye place
Far in deserte sittyng in a vale
Through the foyson and plente of his grace
(...) same lord why might he not purchase
W^th^n a maid during her maydenhede
When that him list to take his manhede
F^^ as the b^e both w^x and honey shede
A^ the ^yue who takes head thereto
R^ght so marye flouryng in maydenhede
(...) her womb god and man also
And (...) soth she was bo^he two
I dare afferme (...) per^o^e in fere
A ma^de clean and cristes mother de^re
And as the beme shynyng from so far
S^^di^h his light as men may well espy
Withouten harm of hynderyng of the sterre
And so as manna fyl down fro the sky
Right so this flower that called is marye
With womb hallowed in to chastyte
Conceyuyd ha^h in her virgynyte
And as the barnacle in the hard tree
Of kind bredith and the vine flower
Causes the wine flo^re for to be
Through bachus might and grapes gouernoure
Right so in soth mankyndes savior
As the barnacle and flower out of the vine
Spronge of marye she being virgyne
And as a worm under a stone
Of therthe comyth without engendure
And as the fenyx of which there is but one
To ashes brent renewyth by nature
Right so this lord that al has in his cure
Our kind ageyn fro sin to renew
Took flessh and blood in this maid true
And as the snow fro Iubyter does fall
Through the force of sagittaryus bow
And zepherus does the flouris fall
On whyt blosmys when she does blow
Right so in soth the grace alight a bow
Of the holy ghoost like a wynd cherisshyng
Amydde the maid to make his dwelling
And to the flower did no duresse
But parfytly conseruyd her beauty
From every storm and flesshly lustynesse
A^ like fresshe of fayrnes for to see
As by ensanmples more than two or three
As ye toforne have herd deuyse
Which as me seems ought enough suffyse
To all that be grounded in the faith
Against falsehede to stand at defense
And yet in such so as Saint Gregore says
Faith has no merit where as euydence
Or mannys reason yeueth experience
But he that leueth and fyndeth no reason
Ne kind according is worthy more guerdon
But if that any be now in this place
That has doubt or ambyguyte
Through false error that does his heart enb^^ce
Either of malice or of Inyquyte
For to accuse the blessed virgynyte
Of marie plainly this is my lone
But if so be that he amend sone
And axe mercy for his great offense
Of her that is of mercy ground and well
That he of vengeance have experience
With Ixyon down deep in belle
And that the clapper of his distuned belle
May cankre soon I mean his false tongue
Be doumbe for ever and never efte to be runge
With him I am no better in charity
Then ye have herd at eve and at morrow
For here my truth he get no more of me
Save cerberus I take him to borowe
What ever he be and leave him with sorrow
To tantalus his hunger to appease
At few words pass over is an ease
How our lady went to saint Johan Baptist mother capitulo xxj
fOr what in soth upon any side
Is p^rbus chare appeyryd of his light
Though eyes raw may not abide
For to behold against his bemys bright
Right so plainly though the gound^ sight
Of heretykes may not sustene
For to behold the clerenes of this queen
May in no wise sothely disencoece
Her clear light ne her parfyt brightness
Whose faye stremes shullen never sece
Withouten eclipse to shine in clennesse
For of this maid as books done express
When gabriel to heaven drowe the coost
She replenysshid was of the holy ghoost
Roos up anon and out of nazareth
Toward the mounteyns fast began her hye
And there she salewith mekely elizabeth
Within the hows of true zacarye
And right forthwith when she did espy
Of marie the meke salutacion
And through her eris when passyd was the sou^
Within her womb plainly thus to tale
For very Joy and spirituel gladness
The young Infant with his lymes smal^
Reioysid him the gospel says express
And she fulfilled in very sothfastnesse
With the holy ghoost loud began to cry
And even thus said unto marye
Blessed art thou among wymmen all
And of thy womb blessed the faiyte also
And how to me of hap is now befalle
My lords mother for to come me to
For very joy I note what I may do
For sothfastly thy gretyng as I here
Within my womb my litel child now here
Reioyseth him for gladness as he can
That of al woo mine heart it does releue
And blissed art thou that first this joy began
The word of god so faithfully to believe
Now be right glad and thyn heart meue
For all thing shall performed be
That been of god byhestyd unto the
Marye then with a devout entente
With loook benygnely and full humble chere
The same hour being ay present
Elizabeth her own cosyn dear
With a full meke and humble chere
And all the accord and hoole melodye
Of the holy ghoost said in her armonye
How our lady made magnificat capitulo xxij
wIth lawde and pryse my soul magnefieth
Eternal lord both one two and three
That al has made and every thing now gyeth
Which of his might and bounteous pity
Of his goodness and high benygnyte
Only of mercy list to have plesaunce
For to consider and graciously to see
To my mekenes and humble attendaunce
My spryte also with heart and thought in fere
Reioysid bath with fulsum habundaunce
In god that is mine heart souerayn entere
And al my joy and al my suffysaunce
My hole desire and al my sustenaunce
Within my thought so deep he is grave
That but in him without variaunce
In all this world I can no gladness have
For he from heaven goodly has behold
Of his handmayde the humylite
Wherefore in soth al only for he would
All kynredys shall blessed call me
Of the which the thank / o lord be unto the
With pace and honor of every voice and tunge
Through armony of sothfast vayte
For this allone be to thy name sunge
For he to me has do things great
Of high renown and passing excellence
His grace made fully in^ to flete
For he is mighty of his magnyfyce n^e
His name holy and most of reverence
That will I leave hit shall me never sterte
With all my true faithful dyligence
To thank him of al my hoole heart
And he his mercy most passyngly famous
For kyn to kyn and so down to kynrede
Shall through his grace be so plenteuous
Perpetually that it shall proceed
And specially to them that louen and dread
Mine own lord with heart will and mind
To such his pity shall ever spring and sprede
Of due right and never be behind
He has his arm enforced and maad strong
His dreedful might that men may see and know
And proud men they reyne not full long
He served has and maad him full bow
With all his heart down of the wh^le hem throw
For to abate her surquedrye and pride
Or they were ware her pomp was overthrow
Full suddenly and seyde her boste a side
And mighty tyrauntes from her ryal see
He has avalyd and y put a down
Aod humble and meke for her humy^^te
He has enhaunced to full high renown
For he can make atransmutacion
From bow to high as it is seen full often
And when him list the domynacion
Of worldly pomp to fall full vnsofte
He has fulfilled and fosteryd in her need
With the goods of plenteuous largeness
Hem that were hungry and I^dygent in dread
And hem relecid of al her wretchidnesse
And he the rich has raught from his richesse
Full wild and waste to make upon the plain
And suddenly plungyde in distress
Al solytarye and left him lygge in vain
For he his child chosen of Israel
Benygnely has taken to his grace
And of his mercy is remembrid well
To wide only vengeance from his face
And humble pees shall ocupye his place
And pity shall be sosid in his stalle
And truth shall his right so enbrace
To set mercy above his werkys all
As he has spoken and faithfully behyght
To our faders that has been here tofore
To abraham and to his sede of right
That his mercy shall lest evermore
For nere his mercy all the world were lore
Unto the which to make man attain
He ha^h made mercy our kind to restore
And of al his werkis to be sovereign
How our lady after the birth of saint John baptist turned to nazareth
capitulo xxiij
aNd when this blessed gracious dytee
Was said to god devoutly of marie
I find after plainly how that she
Stylle in the how bood of zacharye
Three months the gospel may not lie
And after that I read in certain
To nazareth that she went again
And there abode in contemplacion
In her prayers alwey day by day
With many an holy medytacion
To queme her lord in what she can or maan
From whom her thought went never
Her full mind ne her remembrance
For but in him she has no plesaunce
In all this world of no manner thing
For all her joy was on him to think
What ever she did prayeng or worchyng
No thing but he might in her heart synke
For finally whether she wake or wynke
Amyd her heart he was alwey present
So fix on him was set her hoole intent
And day by day this holy life she ladde
This parfyt maid through high devotion
So fervent love unto god she had
There may be made no deuysyon
For she sequestrid her opinion
From all the world and let it plainly goon
So hole to god she gaf her heart alloon
For ever in love she brent more amd more
Toward god in his high seruyse
Was al her lust with heart set so sore
Al erthely thing she fully does despise
And day by day her womb began to rise
Through the fulfillyng of the holy ghoost
Therein by look whom she louyd most
This mean while Joseph ay soiourned
In galylee god wot full Innocent
Of all this thing and why he not returned
Was for that he was so diligent
In carpentrye with all his full intent
Sundry werkis of meruaylous empryse
By carpentrye to forge and deuyse
For in this craft inpassyng excellence
He had in soth and high discressyon
And was had most in reverence
Of all the werkmen of that regyon
And for he had in connyng such renown
Like a master there is no more to seye
The werkmen al his byddyng did obey
And when he had al his work acheuyd
He is repayryd to nazareth ageyn
But lord how he was in his heart ameuyd
When that marye he has with child y seyn
That sore astonyd he not what he may seyn
So at his heart hit sat so Inwardly
Till at the last he abrayed suddenly
And said allas how hit is fall of new
In mine absence or what thing may this be
(...) this maid so faithful and so true
(...) with child and god wot not with me
That sometime had auowyd chastyte
And to my keeping eke delyuerd was
What shall I say of this sodeyn caas
What shall I answer my self to excuse
Unto the bishop if he me appose
For either must I plainly her accuse
Or my gylt with this gylt enuose
This thing is opene I may it not enclose
O blessed god so do me now this grace
Out of my breast this wooful ghoost to trase
For certes lord and hit were thy will
I had lever utterly to deye
Than through my word this maid for to spylle
As I mote need if I her bewraye
And on my self if I the charge lay
For to afferme she has conceyuyd by me
I mote accuse her vow of chastyte
And so my sylf appeche of vntreuth
Sithen I in soth did her never know
O blessed lord have on this matter reuthe
For utterly my wit is brought so low
To see corn grow where no sede is sow
And reason also platly can I none
How a maid with child should gone
And flower forth in her vyrgynyte
I never saw ne never yet did read
And this I doubt my reason can not see
How that marie has kept her maydenhede
In mine absence and this I double dread
My wit is brought and wot not where to torn
For double cause that I have now to morn
That one is this that my fantasye
May never accord that she did offense
And reason plainly agaynward does deny
And upon kind groundyd his sentence
To preue sothely without resistance
That never woman in natures sight
Without a man a child conceive might
And with that word he breast out for to weep
Like as he would al in teris drown
And for the constreynt of his syghes deep
Stood on the point for to have fallen down
His sodayn woo made him almost swowne
So for distress this Joseph fer in age
Of Inward thought caught was in a rage
How the maidens that weren attendaunt to our lady comforteden Joseph capitulo
xxiiij
aNd when the maidens weren ay present
And ever in one abydyng on marye
And understood what that Joseph meant
All attones they began to cry
And said Joseph leave thy fantasye
And thyn error for hit is folly
Withouten auyse to deem sodaynlye
And certainly with all our heart entere
Of knowlechyng in very sykernesse
We will record euerichone in fere
Al opynly touching her clennesse
And here upon bear opynly witness
Like as we know unto this same day
Tho nigh all this world at ones will say nay
For we in soth through besy dylygence
Have been with her both day and night
And never departed out of her presence
But ever in one had of her a sight
And late and erly with all our might
On her awayted without Words moo
And from our sight she did never goo
And every hour both tide and time
Of us there was no deuysion
And all the morrow tide till the high pryme
She never stynte of her devotion
To be in prayer and in oryson
And each day by contynuaunce
A certain hour she had a dalyaunce
With holy angels that with her knelid or stood
And on a time through goddis puruyaunce
Of his hand she took her holy food
As nedeful was to her sustenaunce
And this in so^h has been her governance
And as we echone of her can record
Wherefore Joseph this life does not accord
In sothfastnes of thyn opinion
That so mysdemyth of this maiden f^^e
Of fantasye or of fal^ suspecion
For to accuse her virgynyte
Of which thing we dare ensure the
That no wight made sothely to deuyse
But the holy ghoost he^ womb for to rise
And here upon we record can
Of all the time thou were in galyle
She never allone was with no man
And what she spoke we might here and see
Wherefore Joseph let thy talys be
And deem not amys in word nor in thought
For all this thing by goddys hand is wrought
And by his angels coming on message
Is this thing fully brought about
Therefore Joseph let thyn ire assuage
And of marie be no thing in doubt
Certes quoth he I may not void out
My fantasye to assent in any wise
It should be like as ye now deuyse
For by an aungel hit were Inpossyble
Her to conceive like as ye witness
But if hit so were that hit be credyble
So^me wight by sleyght taking the liknes
Of an aungel through fraudelent falsenes
Through Innocence shortly to conclude
By engyne of fraud her thought to deludo
And efte again for his Inward pain
He began to change both face and hew
And from his eyes the salt teris mine
Like as he would drown him self of new
So sore he began in heart for to rewe
For this matter that for his mortal woo
He can no read ne wot what he may do
And in his heart he cast many a way
To have fond refute with all his full mind
And thought alwey he would her not betraye
For he was rightful plainly as I find
And thus he began in sundry thoughts wind
As in balaunce for possyd up and down
Till at the last in conclusion
He purposith fully and castyth him utterly
To goo his way sothely if he might
And thought he would forsake her pryuely
And never more to come in her sight
Till an aungel on the same night
Sent down from god to Joseph did appear
While that he slepte and said as ye shul here
How the aungel warned Joseph to (...) with our lady capitulo xxvj
o Thou Joseph ne dread thou not blyue
Thou the s^n^ of dauyd of line by dissent
For to take marie to thy wyue
Which is a maid with all her full intent
With whom is ay the holy ghoost present
Of whom god as I the tell byforne
In very so^h that shall of her be borne
And like in soth as writyth Crisostomus
Of this matter that for causis three
Unto Joseph as he tellyth us
The aungel came and first he said that he
Sithen he was rightful that in no degree
Of purpose rightful he should unrightfully
This holy maid forsake pryuely
Another cause he writes eke exp^^sse
That his forsakyng might to her name
Be dishonor and cause in sothfastnesse
Of untrue tunges for to speak her shame
And though in her there were no spotte of blame
Suspecion to void on ever either side
The aungel bad that Joseph should abide
The third cause and also most true
Was that he with more diligence
Should her keep when he the soth knew
That she was clean without al offense
And wist plainly that by magnyficence
Of the holy ghoost his erreur to enchace
Conceived has this maid full of grace
And when Joseph abrayed out of his sleep
And in his heart by reuolucion
Began to cast and to take keep
Against the morrow of his auysion
He caught comfort and consolacion
Of all that ever he was before dispayrid
And to marie again he repayrid
And thankyd god with al^ his hole heart
That he to him has so graciously
In recomforte of his Inward smerte
His great might declarid opynlye
And of Marie full benygnely
He axyth mercy of humble affeccion
That ever to her he had suspecion
And of his error and of his trespace
This hoar graye with all humylite
With weeping eyes began to axe grace
And she anon of womanly pytee
His heaviness when she did see
Comfortid him in all that ever she might
And he anon in all their sight
And al her maidens stondyng enuyron
Began even thus for to cry loud
Certes quod he my derk suspeccion
Came of blyndenes for I none other could
But now in soth the mysty black cloud
Of ignorance is so clarefyed
That all the troth to me is verefyed
Through grace of god that mine old rudeness
Is now from me chacid clean away
Have me excusid of my derke dullness
With all mine heart benygnely I pray
My night of error is turned in to day
That I may now with mine eyes old
The bright bemys of tytan well behold
That for derknes I nyst what to done
Only for lack of his bemys bright
Weren me berafte through the clowdy moan
And had within me no clear Insighte
That this eclyps was causid al to sone
By her sodeyn Interpocessyone
That was cheef ground of my suspeccion
This is to sayn that mine erthely thought
So was opressyd derkyd and borne down
That wordely skyees that I might naught
Ne was nor worthy to have Inspeccion
Of this derke knowledge by relacion
Till the sun of his grace did shine
My wit eclipsid fully to enlumyne
For he to me has his aungel sent
Mine ignorance fully for to clear
Wherefore of you in all my best entente
O ye maidens that be present here
I axe mercy with all mine heart entere
Of all that ever that ha^h be spoken and said
And lowly I pray you be not evil apayd
And they echone thankyd god of all
With heart and will both in word and deed
That he on Joseph has in special
His grace of new made for to sprede
To void aweye al his hoole dread
Of every conceyt and Imagenyng
To make him know the truth of this thing
There through in soth the joy began renew
Among hem al echone of one accord
The armonye entuned was so true
Between hem that there was none dyscorde
Not so much as a lityl word
And thus in joy a while I let hem dwell
And of the bishops forth I will tell
How the bishop did do sompmon Joseph for our lady was with child capitulo
xxvij
Touching this thing plainly if I conne
How word by word sothely in sentence
Of this thing the rumor is I run
And reportid that through neclygence
Of this Joseph or by vyolence
How that marie goth with child great
Wherefore they have in a sodeyn hete
Cytyd him before him to apere
And he came forth with sobyr countenance
Of whom anon the bishop began enquere
Abyathar of his governance
From point to point with every circumstaunce
Touching this thing what it might amounte
Or how that Joseph would give a count
That marie debonayr and so mylde
That sometime was of such opinion
In the temple is great now with child
Against the auowe of her profescion
By some engyne of collucion
In prouydence of her vyrgynyte
Notwythstondyng utterly that she
Aouwyd had of hole affeccion
All her life to keep in her maydenhede
And was that time of such perfeccion
That sothfastly withouten any dread
Of such another could I never read
Her virtues al to reken hem by and by
From day to day that time trewly
She never stynte for to wyrche or preye
But like a myrrour of al holiness
The will of god fully did obey
With all her heart and al her business
And with all this fulfilled of meekness
She was example to every manner wight
That there abode or of her had a sight
And every day without words moo
Stound^ele from the heaven adoun
Goddys aungel came to and fro
Where as she lay in contemplacion
And at the last of great affeccion
By signs showed of goddys volunte
She was of us asigned unto the
After the custom plainly of the law
That thou sholdest conserne her and govern
Now be well ware that thou have not mysdrawe
Her t^ndyr thought fro god that is eterne
The troth of things clearly can conserne
Wherefore beware that thou be not to wit
In this matter lest he will the quyte
Quod Joseph than with heed enclyned ^^we
Syrs speak I will if hit your will be
Of this thing I am not aknowe
The sothfast lord that every thing may see
My tryst is fully he will excuse me
Of rightwysnes and shylde me fro shame
Of all that ever ye put me in blame
For I have kept her in the same point
Of maydenhede that she was me betake
Of which as yet she stondyth in no dysioynte
I dare afferme and swear hit for her sake
And for my part what preef ye list to make
I will be ready and let hit not be sparid
Till verily the soth be declared
Than quod the bishop al suspescion
To deuoyde and al ambyguyte
That god may make demonstracion
Of you tweyne how the truth may be
Ye shullen at taste both thou and she
Of thylke water to speak in words few
That god ordained truth for to show
To exclude plainly every conceyt new
Of tunges large and every fantasye
As is sometime showed by the hew
Of them that drank the drink of Ie^osye
As Numeri does clearly specefye
Wherefore anon there is no more to seye
Make you ready for ye both tweye
Shullen make a taste whether it be sour or sote
There is none agaynsay ne excusacion
Till the troth be rypyd in the rote
Ne shullen proceed to this conclusion
That god list make a declaracion
Of all this thing for favor or for routhe
There is no mean but the plain truth
For if god list that your Innocence
Like your deser^e be opynly excusid
Than is your merit of your excellence
That ye toforne falsely were accusid
And sithen this preef may not be refusid
But that ye must obey to the law
Come of anon and you not withdraw
Do set her forth and bring her to presence
That has in virtue so excellent a name
In whom was never yet found offense
But unto this time ever flourith in her fame
And standith at large from every manner blame
Now lat her come and like as god your ewre,
For you disposith takes your adventure
(...) she anon was of her frendys brought
(...) not what al this might mean
(...) of dread both in heart and thought
(...) in soth may not do no tene
To c^ns^i^nce that is of sin clean
(...) there no place ocupyeth
(...) a soul unguilty gyeth
(...) may no while brenne
(...) brondes be taken away
(...) river hold his course and run
(...) spring dry sothely this is no nay
Ne vengaunce plainly make may none assaye
(...) e^cute against Innocence
Ne void of sin his mighty vyolence
For nothing but sin may engendyr shame
For s^lde or not ben the chekys read
Of him in soth that is deuoyde of blame
For who so is clean takyth lityl head
To wynke or blenke for any manner dread
And for the assaute of any mysty cloud
Light of virtue may no while shroude
It may a while be derkyd with a sky
As is among the fair bright son
And with the wyndes of malice and envy
The clear sterris often wexen done
But when troth set abroche his tonne
To make the soth opynly be know
The wind of falsenes may no lengyr blow
How our ladies frendys wayled and morned when the bysshoppys made so strong a
preef of her vyrgynyte capitulo xxxj
tHan sithen troth may no while dare
Hornys shrynke ne hyde him in his neste
But like a son his light abroad declare
When she that was the very chosen cheste
Of al clennesse and therewyth all the best
Of al good how might hit betyde
Her light of virtue to be set a side
That hit nyl shine maugre who says nay
When her bemys ben opynly discurid
As gold in fire fined by assaye
And as the tried silver is depurid
And she that was in virtue most assuryd
Where the holy ghoost his dwelling did set
How might than any mystes lotte
The clear light of her parfytnesse
Or any manner preef or probacion
In any part for to make it less
For light will out it may not be borne down
And so will troth have domynacion
For any falsenes that men can conspyre
Than she that was so fully set a fire
Of the holy ghoost ne dar but lityl dread
To drink water whether hit be thykke or clear
To take a preef of her maydenhede
For her harm it shall have no power
For to deface her color or her chere
But rather amend more and clarefye
The derke dymmyng of every cloud sky
And so marie stondyng in the place
And al her frendys about enuyron
Where men may see upon many a face
Of frendely routhe and compassyon
The salt treris fall and run down
For dread and love they had for to seen
So hard assaye made on her age grene
But she alwey constant as a wall
In thought in chere abashed never a dele
Ne in her heart dredyth not at all
But upon god tristyth alwey well
That he of troth shall try out the stele
And by that she spoke but words few
Withouten speech he shall the deed show
And when the water fully was confecte
Like the statute and the rytes old
The bishop has the cup first direct
Unto Joseph and him the parel told
And manly he began hit hold
And drank hit up and changed not his chere
And seven times about the aultere
He went than by custom as he ought
Of face and color alwey like new
And to marie also the bishop brought
A cup of water and she of heart true
Acceptith eke this godely fressh of hew
And or she drank this holy parfyt maid
Al opynly thus to god she said
How our lady prayed to god to show her vyrgynyte capitulo xxxij
o Sothfast lord that have the knowlechyng
Of every thing through thy might
And art so true and so just a king
To high and low thou wylt do right
And nothing may be shroudyd fro thy sight
Through none engyne ne thy face asterte
But sothfastly know every heart
So that no wight fade may ne feign
Tofore the eye of thy sapyence
Now let thy grace down fro heaven train
Clearly in deed and not by appearance
To show in me if there be offense
Of any gylte mine auowe to appeche
To the I pray so thy light to reche
That hit be couthe here al opynly
To wete in soth whether I in chastyte
Have led my life as faithfully
Like as thou know for the love of the
And if I have my virgynyte
Conceruyd hole this is mine oryson
Make opynly a demonstracion
And with that word the drink she did ataste
And went her course about the aultere
And all the people began to gasen fast
If any sign did in her appear
Other in color countenance or chere
But al for naught plainly as I told
The more on her they losten and behold
The more she was in her sight fair
And like as phoebus in Ioly grene may
When she has chasid the derk mysty air
Shyneth more clear the bright summers day
When thylke vapors ben driven clear away
Right so Joseph and also marie
So fressh were in every wyghtes eye
That to behold they thought hit did hem good
The long day in her opinion
For in her face alwey was the blood
Without palyng or any drawyng down
And alwey more fair of Inspeccion
Of which thing the people began marvel
And for astoned thoughten her wits fail
How the bishop and the people dredde hem of the assaye that was maad to our
lady capitulo xxxiij
aNd in party gretely weren dysmayed
Lest that god on hem would take vengeance
For they so far goddis might have assayed
O^f error blind and very Ignorance
And right forthwith of hertely repentance
They bonchen her b^estys wi^h fystys wonder sore
And al attones f^^len down before
This holy maid with humble reverence
And wolden her feet have kyssyd there anon
Axyng mercy of her great offense
And she forgave it hem euerychone
And all the bishops and the people gone
Benygnely to bring her aweye
And to her paleys fully her conueye
Of whom the noise to the heaven runge
Wi^h heart and speech as they magnefye
The lord above in every wyghtes tunge
For joy and myrthe began him glorefye
And all the day thus in melodye
They ladde for^h till hit drowe to eve
And godely than of her they took her leave
And forth they went every man his way
In the storye as made is memory
But marie in all the haste she may
Entr^d is in to her oratorye
As she that ha^h won the victory
Of al tho that aforne began muse
Her maydenhede of malice to accuse
And through her merit has the mouthis shette
And lippys closid of hem that weren in were
And day by day keeping her closette
Contynuelly lay in her prayere
Expectaunt ever like as ye shul here
With humble heart and devout obeysaunce
Upon the time of her delyueraunce
The holy ghoost being ay her guide
Her chaumbre she kept her day awaytyng
As ye shall here if ye list to abide
And god toforne yet or the birds sing
And or that floura does the flouris spring
Tofore the calendys of apryle or of may
My purpose is plainly if that I may
For to proceed forth in this dytee
So as I can or make mention
Of the feste and solempnyte
That called is the Incarnacion
Only through help and supportacion
Of her that is so plenteuous benygne
Or that phoebus enter in the sign
With this carecte of the ariete
Of this feste somewhat shall I write
But o alas the rethorikes sweet
Of petrake fraunces that could so endyte
And tullyus with all his words white
Full long agone and full old of date
Is deed allas and passyd in to fate
A comendacion of chauceres capitulo xxxiiij
aNd eke my master chauceris now is grave
The noble rethor poet of brytayne
That worthy was the lawrer to have
Of poetrye and the palm attain
That made first to dystylle and rain
The gold dew dropys of speech and eloquence
In to our tunge through his excellence
And fond the flouris first of rethoryke
Our rude speech only to enlumyne
That in our tunge was never none him like
For as the son does in heaven shine
In mydday spear down to us by line
In whose presence no sterre may appear
Right so his dytees withouten any pere
Every making with his light distayne
In sothfastnes who so takyth head
Wherefore no wonder though mine heart plain
Upon his death and for sorrow blede
For want of him now in my great need
That should allas conueye and dyrecte
And with his supporte amend and correct
The wrong traces of my rude pen
There as I err and goo not line right
But that for he ne may me not kenne
I can no more but with all my might
With all mine heart and mine Inward sight
Prays for him that now lies in cheste
To god above to give his soul good rest
And as I can forth I will proceed
Sithen of his help there may no socour le
And though my pen be quakyng ay for dread
Nether to clyo ne to calyope
Me list not call for to help me
Ne to no muse my poyntel for to gye
But leave all this and say unto marie
O clear castle and the chaste toure
Of the holy ghoost mother and virgyne
Be thou my help counceyl and socoure
And let the stremys of thy mercy shine
In to my breast this third book to fine
That through thy supporte and benygne grace
Hit to parforme I may have life and space
How Christ was borne after the making of the world five thousand an hundred
four score and xix year capitulo xxxv
When al was hushte and al was in salonce
And in his course the long sterry night
Was half past and fresshe of appearance
Lucyna shone in heaven fair and bright

Of every head so that each man
At a certain day in all the haste he can

And there upon he should anon atame
Another of new and for the more honor
With hond touchyd swear for sweet or sour
While he lives and never for to rewe

tHe year of herod thyrty year and one
When made was the discripsion
As ye have herd that Joseph must gone
To bethlem for conclusion
To pay his tribute in his own town
As the statute before does specefye
By cause that he and also marie
Whereof the housolde and the tribe borne
Called Judah and of the kynrede
Of worthy dauyd as I have said toforne
And on her journey as they began hem speed
And holy Joseph did her brydel led
And suddenly marie than abrayde
And unto Joseph even thus she said
Y wys quoth she me thinks that I see
Two folkis gretely discordyng
Upon the way apperyng unto me
That one reioysyng that other compleynyng
To whom Joseph benygnely lokyng
Answered again and bad her ride in pees
And prayed her also not to be recheles
Any words for to speak in vain
But hold her way and her journey right
And unawarely before them in the plain
Apperid an aungel with face stern and bright
Of whom the beauty yaue a plesaunt light
The place enuyron and a sweet odoure
And his clothyng the like lyly flower
Was whyt in soth as snow that falls new
Which began anon chere and look to meue
And therwithal with a chaungyd hew
Bygan also Joseph to repreue
And shortly bad his words that he leave
And said in soth that he was to blame
For to be bold any words to tame
Against marie through thy neclygence
To say that she spoke any words vein
For that she saw / was none appearance
But very soth as she has it seyne
For tryste me well and be right certain
Of this folk of which she spoke to the
In sothfastnesse like as thou shall see
Ben the folkis and the peplis tweyne
That been disseuerid in full large space
That one of Jews that weep shall and pleyne
With many tere distyllyng in her face
That wylfully shall refuse his grace
Of froward heart for to be benygne
To deuoyde and plainly to resygne
The Synagoge with her rightes old
Which in short time shall draw to declyne
And her faces quench and wexe cold
With sacrid light that weren wont to shine
For time is come that they must fine
And the waylyng of her derkyd chere
Unclose shall and show as bright and clear
This time of grace fully to obey
With heart and will and with humble chere
For goddis word that no man may withsaye
Has hastyd it / goon full many a year
To abraham and also Isaac in fere
And to Jacob that in her holy sede
Full hastily who so will take heed
Shall all the peplys blessed be
Through out the world in every land and re^^e
And with that word that Joseph might see
The aungel stye above the son beme
And be goth forth toward bethleme
With marie till that they both tweyne
In full lityl space began to atteyne
To the bonds of bethlem the cite
Weary and mate somdele of her vyage
Where they founden of people such plente
In the cite of every manner age
That they might have no manner herbegage
In all the town neither boure ne halle
Save a stable and a litel stalle
That was sequestrid and y set a side
Out of al prees the story says express
^ade for bestys therein to abide
(...) streyte and narowe shadowyd with derknesse
In to the which Joseph began him dress
With marie to rest there al night
And as she entrid a new sodeyn light
All the place enlumyned enuyron
That shone as bright as any summers day
So that this ^^tyl humble mancion
Was fressh and light as phoebus is in may
Which (...) to weye and encrece ay
(...) was there al be that it was night
And (...) anon the sothfast son of light
Of al our joy cast him to arise
And shed his light to glade al mankind
For toward mydnyght shortly to deuyse
When al was husshte holy writ makith mind
As sothely as he did him wind
In the sydys of this holy maid
So esely this new son abrayde
When he was borne in to this mortal life
Upon the earth to shede his brightness
Withouten help of any mydwyf
Or of his mother travail or sickness
For she that first conceyuyd in clennesse
It sat right well that she should also
Withouten travail or any manner woo
For to goo quyte at her delyueraunce
And specially have a prerogatyf
In her chyldyng to feel no penance
Sithen she was maid mother and wife
Chosen of god for to stynte our stryf
Of al wymmen by her self allone
Wherefore hit sat not her to cry and groan
Like to other women that be Inly syke
In the time of their trauelynge
Wherefore sithen she was to none other like
No pain felt she the hour of her chyldyng
And as I find at her delyueryng
There was no wight but her self allone
For thylke time Joseph was out gone
How Joseph went to seche a mydwyf to our lady capitulo xxxvij
iN full great haste to enquere and seek
So^me mydwyf to help in this need
And in this while with her eyes meke
She chylded has this flower of maydenhede
And home ageyn as Joseph began him speed
And to the place the mydwyues brought
Even at the door abashed in her thought
Stoden stylle astoned of that light
And the brightness that shone in the place
Ageyn kind that time of the night
That they ne might sustain in her face
And no wonder for the son of grace
Within which cast his light to far
Of whom the moon and each other sterre
Receyuen her light eueriche in her spear
Al by that he lay here in earth low
In a stable with his sacrid chere
Sool with his mother that no man did know
Of whom her ^ook she mekely began to throw
Godely beholding his fair young face
And knelyng down began to enbrace
His tender lymmes in her arms tweyne
And wrawyd him in clothes tenderlye
And took him up and sothely began him leyne
In her law and full humbly
She beheld his fetures by and by
So fair shapen in party and in all
And with her milk very celestyal
And heavenly sycour of her pappys small
His (...) lymmes she spredde in every cost
The whyt bawme to make hit auale
Fet from the conduyte of the holy ghoost
Upon the thing that she louyd most
And gave him sowke of the pyment sote
That spronge and grew out of the holy rote
Of maydenhede and from the chaste vine
Of al clennes was I tried out
Wherewith she made her young child to dyne
Whom heaven and earth must obey and lowte
All be that he with bestys him about
Lay humbly as ye have herd deuyse
And after this his mother did arise
And lift him up sothely in to the stalle
Where the ass and the ox stood
And on her knees she began anon to fall
And worshipped him this best of al good
That yeuy^h to angels and to man food
And than this maid with debonayr chere
With face erecte and hondys eke in fere
A devout prayer that our lady maad when christ was born capitulo xxxviij
tO god above began thus for to pray
O lord quoth she with all my full might
To whom each thing Justly must obey
To the I than as it is skylle and right
That thou so godely list to have a sight
To my mekenes though I unworthy be
And not dysdayne of thy benygnyte
To grant only of thy high goodness
Me to encrece in to such excellence
To be a maiden and mother in clennesse
To bear thy sone and thy sapyence
That never twynneth out of thy presence
But in heaven abides ay with the
And in earth mekely now with me
Lies in a stable of chere most debonayr
Tofore my face my joy and my comfort
Which with the lokyng of his eyes fair
Is hole my gladness and fully my disporte
Sothfast plesaunce and my cheef resort
My dear son and my lord also
To whom with heart and all that I can do
I thank the lord that liggist me beforne
That thou list chese to have affeccion
Of me so mekely in earth to be borne
And fro thy fader to discende adoun
Only for help and sauacioun
Of mankind freely of thy will
My blessed child that so good and stylle
Liggest now here mekely by sufferaunce
Amyd the bestys so fair Upon to see
And have no wighte to thyn attendaunce
Like thyn astate awaytyng upon the
Save that thou have so godely chosen me
Of thy grace upon the to abide
I to serve and thou to be my guide
As it is right and Joseph with us tweyne
To take his part what fortune so betyde
Like as thou list of grace to ordeyne
And than anon right in the self tide
Joseph came ynne and stood her beside
And suddenly when he the child does see
Full humbly knelyng on his kne
How the mydwyf durst not enter with Joseph in to the hows for a great light
apperyd within capitulo xxxix
WOrshypped him with all his heart and might
With all his will and al his full thought
And tellyd marye for fere of the light
The mydwyues that he had brought
Astoned were that they durst naught
Enter ynne but kept hem aferre
For cause only that a new sterre
Ascended was upon that mancion
That spredde his light and his bemys shene
From este to weste through out the regyon
That al they that did it seen
Began fast muse what it might mean
And in her hertes gretely for to charge
That a sterre so bright so fair and large
Of new did appear in that reem
That never none such was seen tofore
Of which sterre prophets in Iherusaleem
That time were astonyd wonder sore
Sayden plainly withouten any more
That this sterre did signefye
Thylke sterre which in his prophecye
How balam prophesied the sterre that shewid Crystys birth capitulo xl
bAlam the sone of beor as I find
Co^mendith so in all his best wise
When he said sothely of the kind
Of worthy Jacob a sterre should arise
And eke also as he does deuyse
Full opynly the bible can you tell
How that a yerd out of Israhel
Shall spring also to smite and oppress
The fell dukes of moab with her might
And he shall waste in war sothfastnesse
The children of sothe and of kind right
With the shynyng of his bemys bright
Conquer also to his subieccion
Withouten obstacle and have poscessyon
Of ydume for his heritage
With many another rich regyon
And of Seyr the rich baronage
Shall to him lowte / for his renoun
So that this sterre in conclusion
Which in bethleme brightest of sterris all
The which above the lytyl oxys stalle
So shene shone at the natyuyte
Of the child as ye have herd me tell
Betokens plainly as ye shul after here
That the lord of heaven earth and hell
W^iche may of moab the tyranny fell
Was there by look and held his hostage
I^ a sta^le narow as any cage
(...) bestis though he were lord of all
(...) world may at his will govern
Whic^e in his hand hangith as a balle
In (...) his might is so eterne
And (...) thing marye began concern
Within her self s^ker and full ^^oos
And after that she mekely up roos
How our lady receyuyd the mydwyues capitulo xlj
aNd to the door wonder womanly
She went a paas and when she did see
The mydwyues full benygnely
She brought hem in with all humylite
Shephora and also Salomee
And hem welcometh in full low manner
And when that they thise signs saw in fere
Of the sterris / and the bestys knele
Toward the child to do him reverence
And began also by other tokens feel
Of maydenhode that there was none offense
And that she stood hole in that excellence
Of parfyt clennesse and virgynyte
And mother to be and flower in chastyte
Withouten wemme on any party found
Of all the preues that they make could
And when they saw her pappis so habounde
With heavenly milk sent from above the cloud
Shephora began then to cry full loud
That a maid has a child borne
The which thing was not seen beforne
In all this world who so list to take heed
For it in soth the right of al nature
Passith plainly and also does excede
The wit of man I do you well assure
But I see well through the mighty cure
Of goddys hand this thing is brought about
Whereof platly I am no thing in doubt
But assentyd with heart and hole credence
Having thereon none ambyguyte
And then anon for the great offense
And for wantriste of her fellow salome
Opynly that al men might see
Wexe in that arm deed and cold as stone
With which she was hardy for to gone
How the hand of Salome wexyd dry capitulo xlij
tHe child to touch of presumpsion
And his mother without reverence
Deuoyde of dread or of devotion
Or any faithful humble aduertence
Don as her ought of his magnyficence
Wherefore anon for her high trespace
Al opynly in the same place
She punysshid was that al might hit see
And began for sorrow weep and complain
And said lord have pity upon me
And of mercy rewe upon my pain
And of mine offense that thou not dysdayne
Ne to thyn hyghnes hit be no displesaunce
That I a wretch blind of ignorance
Offendyd gretely has in thy sight
Of much vnkunnyng and Indiscressyon
And suddenly in all their sight
Even amyddes of that mancion
An aungel bright sent from heaven down
Did appear byddyng her anon
With devout heart that she should goon
Full humbly in her best entente
Unto the child for to have socoure
And touch the hemme of his vestemente
Reverently and with great honor
For he in soth is the savior
Of all the world and of al mankind
And power has plainly to unbind
Al tho that playnen and ben in distress
When they to him mekely will call
And salome devoutly began her dress
Toward the child and on her knees fall
And said o lord that power have of all
Let thy mercy on me sprede
For to socour me in this great need
Me wretchyd wight punysshed rightfu^^^
And lost for ever save only thy grace
For in soth save only thy mercy
I have lost mine arm allas for my trespace
And with that word as she did enbrace
To touch the cloth that he lay in bound
Without more this salome has found
Remedy and was made hole again
Suddenly or she could it spy
And up she rose and may no longer fayn
But in the street opynly began cry
How the lord that all this world may gye
Descendyd is and bycome man
And whiles that she thus in the street ran
Tellyng the birth / and of the sterre also
And of her arm and of her sodeyn cure
The people began fast to draw to
To harken more of this adventure
For in her speech so^me began hem assure
And that her words might be credyble
And specially for to them vysyle
The sterre shone ever above the house
Ay like fyx without mocion
So bright so long so glad so joyous
That all that had Inspeccion
In heart parfyte and true entencion
that they weren reioysid and made light
And all this thing fell upon the night
On a sunday mine auctour will not lie
As ye may find if ye list to read
The viij kalendis for sothe of Ianuarye
When marye example of maydenhede
Was of age who so will take heed
Sixtene year this flower of nazareth
At the vysion of saint Elizabeth
Plainly records look and ye may see
And in this night of most worthynesse
Of crystys birth and natyuyte
As the gospel says and berith witness
When the shepherdes with great business
Kept her watch the long wynters night
Upon her sheep / an aungel with great light
How the angels apperid to the shepherdis and told the birthe of christ
capitulo xliij
aMyd the field to hem did appear
And gave hem comfort in her great dread
And bad hem be light and glad of chere
For I ad he show to you in deed
A joy that does every joy excede
That finally shall of al disease
To al folk comfort be and ease
And be to hem refuyte and socoure
In all myscheues and aduersite
For now this day mankyndes savior
In bethleme of dauyd his cite
Is borne in soth like as ye may see
Goth and beholds how that it is fall
And ye shullen find in an oxes stalle
How that he lies in clothis narow wound
This young faunte with chere full benygne
The which thing when that ye have found
That al is soth let be to you a sign
And suddenly with lawde and pryse condygne
With the aungel the hole chyualrye
Of al heaven by one armonye
For joy hereof began to say and sing
Glory and honor in the heavenly see
Be un to god eternally during
And in earth pees and rest be
To al tho men that of one unity
This high feste honor and magnefye
And we echone of one melodye
O mighty lord we praise and bless the
And worship eke with humble reverence

And thankyng give to thy magnyficence
For thy glory and thyn excellence
O thou lord god / o king celestyal
O god the fader most mighty found at all
And god the sone his child above eterne
Crist Ihesu borne of this heavenly queen
O god also the chosen lamb so derne
Sone of the fader withouten spotte al clean
That do away the worlds sin and tene
Have mercy on us of thyn high goodness
Sith thou thy self in parfyte holiness
Allone thou art sothely holy and no moo
And lord allone over al thing
And worthyest and highest eke also
O crist Ihesu of heaven and earth king
With the holy ghoost in glory reynyng
Ay with the fader by eternyte
Three knyt in one through parfyte unity
How the shepherdys founden christ with our lady capitulo xliiij
aNd wha^ the angels with this heavenly so^ge
The birth of crist had magnefyed
With parfyte gladness that was hem among
To heaven anon / ageyn they have hem hyed
And the hi^rdys by one accord alyed
Ben hastily unto bethlem gone
Where they founden when they came anon
Marie and Joseph and the child also
Leyd in a stable according every dele
As the aungel had said hem unto
And of the sight they lyked wonder well
And in him self began know and feel
That al was soth that they said before
Of the aungel how a child was bore
In to this world mankind for to save
After the record of old prophecye
Whereof they ganne so great a joy have
That al attones they began magnefye
God above devoutly and to glorefye
Retornyng hem deuoyde of every smerte
And marie choos within her heart
Conseruyd all that she did see
Word and deed and every manner thing
That befylle in this natyuyte
Full secretly thereon ymagenynge
And prudently her self gouernynge
Kept her sone with all her besy cure
Which on this day as says bonauenture
Like a spouse from his chamber is goon
His chosen chyldre through his benygnyte
In his church to joy hem of syon
By parfyte pees and sothfast unity
And he this day has showed the beauty
Of his face of excellent fayrnesse
In whose honor this day of high gladness
Was made the ympne the gospel says also
Our alther myrthe and joy to encrees
Gloria in excelcis deo
And in earth this day a parfyt pees
To man was showed withouten any lees
And as says powle goddis benygnyte
This day apperid in our humanyte
How god would not be borne but of a maid mother and wife capitulo xlv
aNd over this as he eke tell can
God was this day in symylitude
In earth honored in liknesse of man
And he this day his godhede did enclude
In our manhood and shortly to conclude
This day also if I shall not feyne
Befyl also other things tweyne
The wonderfullest and most meruaylous
That ever yet were seen tofore
Whereof no wight by kind is capyous
First how god to save that was forlore
Lowly in earth list to be bore
And how a maid in her virgynyte
Might also child / and a mother be
The which things passen and transende
Reason of man by kinds liknesse
But faith above must al comprehend
And hit enbrace by parfyt stablenesse
And make his ground upon the witness
Of prophe^es which in her prophecye
So long aforne began to speak and cry
After the coming of this mighty king
Our old woo and trouble to enchace
To whom dauyd said in his writing
O b^^sful lord show to us thy face
And we in sothe only thorugh thy grace
Shullen saved be from al myschyef and dread
And also now in our great need
Send to us thy comfortable light
Us to enlumyne liggyng in derknesse
Eke ysaye with all his Inward sight
Up to heaven began his look to dress
And said lord of thy great goodness
Out of desert from the hard stone
Unto the daughter dwelling in syone
Send down thy lamb fulfilled with meekness
That lordshyp has and domynacion
Of all the earth our dole to redress
And would god for our sauacion
This mighty lord for to come a down
The high heuenes would brek^ on tweyne
Us to releue of that we so complain
And dauyd spoke eke this lord unto
In the sawter our sorrows for to fine
And said lord in relees of our woo
In high heuyns thy mercy make enclyne
And down dyscende / and lat thy grace shine
Upon us wretchis in the vale of sorrow
And lord do dawe thy holy glad morrow
Quod salamon and show to us thy light
Of thy mercy and rewe on our distress
And with thy virtues that be so much of might
That no man may count them ne express
Fulfylle syon and with high gladness
Thy peples hertes make to renew
That thy prophets may be found true
For out of the shall proceed anon
The mighty king and lord of Israel
And now this day is coruen out of stone
Without hondes of that holy hell
Of which sometime the prophet danyelle
In his book wrote so long aforne
To signefye that there should be borne
At Iherusalem / where as a mighty king
Shall come in haste his people to vysite
And he shall bring pees in his coming
Of whom the power shall not be a lyte
For hit shall last as him list to write
From see to see and all the earth sprede
Thorugh out the world in length and bread
And baruk commanded to Iherusalem
To be hold in all his best entente
Toward the brightness of the son beme
And wisely look in to the orient
To see the gladness that this day is sent
Down to the earth now that criyst is bore
Of whose coming so many a day before
Spoke ysaye and said in words plain
The high heuens do your grace adewe
And said also the skies should rain
Upon earth her moisture for to show
And bad the ground eke in words few
For to opyn and thus this heavenly shoure
For to bring our alther savior
And Ieromye spoke eke of this day
And said on heyght god should make sede
A grain of dauyd fayrer than flower in may
Which in fresshnes shall ever spring and sprede
And conserve Judah out of dread
And eke Israel keep in sykernesse
And he shall make dome and rightwysnesse
Upon the earth of high and low degree
And rightwysnes men shall his name call
When he comes to sit in the sea
Of king dauyd in his ryall stalle
And he also tofore the prestys all
Both of Judah and leuy shall deuyse
With new encence to do sacrefyse
To god above for the great offense
Of the people and ignorance
With his offering make recompense
Or that the sword be whette of vengeance
Even like as made is remembrance
In malachye in the same wise
This son of life shall spring and arise
To all the that him love and dread
And ben expectant with all humylite
On his coming to such he shall out shede
His light of grace at his natyuyte
Wherefore be glad like as hit may be
Thou bethleme y called effrata
Though thou be lytyl named in Judah
For ^ut of the shall proceed anon
The mighty king and lord of Israel
And now this day is coruen out of stone
Withouten ^^ndes of that holy hell
Of the (...) sometime the prophet danyelle
In his ^^ke wrote so long aforne
^o sig^efye that there should be borne
A child in soth without touch of man
Of a maid after his beheste
That like a stone was y corue out than
When he was borne / of this high feste
Only to bear the crown / and the cheste
In babylonye of the great image
That made man first for to do oultrage
For now in soth common is the day
Of prophets so long beforne ^ehyght
For christ Ihesu plainly this is no nay
Is like a stone who so lokyth a right
Which by his wysdom and his faders might
And the virtue of the holy ghoost
Was coruen out so clean of every coost
Of that blessed parfyt holy hylle
That growyth full of holsom flouris fair
For out of her that was in heart and will
A parfyt maid humble and debonayre
Like as the dew of heaven does repair
Upon hermon alwey new and new
Amendyng ay the fresshnes of her hew
Right so through virtue lastyng ay in one
Of the holy ghoost / this day of marye
Was coruen out the sothfast angle stoou
Whom that prophets praise and magnefye
For she this day was the glad sky
Which the child of elye did see
So plesantly dessende from the tree
Upon the earth nakyd and barayne
Of holsom faite / and of erbys sote
That has shadde the comfortable rain
The grain of grace for our alther bo^e
That percyd has even to the rote
Of our Welfare / to do the leuys spring
For she allone is the field flourynge
That sometime gave so passing a swetenes
To Isaak when he was fall in age
Of which he cast so Inward gladness
That him thought ho^e his courage
Renewyd was and with a glad vysage
Unto Jacob of hertely joy said
On his clothys as he his hondes laid
How ysaac prophesied the birth of christ by towchyng of the clothys of his
sone Jacob capitulo xlvj
mine own child and my sone dear
The great sweetness of the fressh odoure
Of thy clothyng to me is so entere
That hit fro me deuoydeth al langoure
Seeing tofore that there should a flower
Out of the field spring of his kynrede
The which should such an odoure shede
That all the world shall comfort find and hele
In the swetenes against each maladye
And souerayn health in every myschyef feel
So that this was no wight but marie
That by dyssent came of his alye
Out of the which to glade al our chere
This day in earth there did a flower appear
The swettest yet that ever man beheld
Passing the rose and the flower delyse
And of this holy fressh fair field
Sometime the spouse spoke in canticis
When he it saw so fresshe at his deuyse
And habundaunt of a tempre air
And that it was so passing I^ly fair
How the garnet appyll is lykened to our lady capitulo xlvij
o How the bawme of heavenly lycoure
Of thy swetenes with souerayn suffysaunce
Like paradyse shedyth his vapoure
Erly a morrow auoydyng al greuaunce
Like the fruit that is of such plesaunce
The garnet appyl of color golden hewed
Through whose odoure the courage is renewed
Of every wight that may the air receive
For even like as the golden rynde
Is plain and shynyng as ye may conceive
His color keeping ever in one by kind
And does his pypynes in the scales bind
To do comfort to seek in her access
Right so marie our sekenes to redress
This day has borne the holsom holy fruit
The fruit of life that with his sweet breath
Is remedy and also cheef refute
To mankind again the fever of death
For as the grain of the garnet sleeth
The strong axes and does the hete auale
Right so this day out of the golden scale
The holsom pepyne and the grain of life
Crist Ihesu began first to appear
And of marye mother maid and wife
The goldyn garnet with gis scales clear
Being al hole and ever a like entere
Was borne in soth for to refresshe blyue
Our old axes / and right as the olyue
His oil shedith and branch leef ne tree
Apperith not of fayrnes ne color
Right so marye flouryng in chastyte
This day has borne our alther savior
The oil of pees to stynte our langour
To soft our soris and our swellyng slake
Of al our wounds when they smerte o^ ache
And now this day shortly for to write
This bl^sful time of the natyuyte
Of young Joseph the cote polymyte
Wrought by the pour of all the trynyte
Within the closette of chosen chastyte
Parformyd was and by none hand of man
As alysaunder well wherce can
Within his book made in special
On cantica as ye may read and see
The which cloth of purpyl most ryall
Hewyd with clennesse of virgynyte
This day has showed in our humanyte
The godhede hoole for by this cloth is meant
Of our kind the freel garnement
How Joseph fygurid the birth of crist capitulo xlviij
aLso this day of Joseph the canele
Amyd the field that does the virtue flower
Was gaderyd up by clennesse every dele
Whom all that other began worship and honor
For in chastyte clean chosen bower
Of maydenhede this canel grew by kind
That when the brethern of Joseph did bind
Eueriche his sheef the bible began deuyse
How hit stood up among hem euerichone
And all the other began attones rise
And worshippyd hit mekely one and one
For this Joseph saw this day allone
Son and moan and sterris eke eleven
To him obey upon the high heaven
And the sothfast garner of the holy greyne
As says guydo was a maid sweet
In whom was shytte sothely for to seyne
The sacrid store and eke the halowyd whete
Of the seven year that did in plente flete
For on this parfyt root virtuous
The seven eeris of grain so plenteuous
This day be grown to full perfeccion
To save egypt in his great need
And for to be to him sauacion
In craft when he has need
For this is the grain that fostre and feed
With full repaste woman child and man
And al his brethern dwelling in canaan
It Is young Joseph this Joseph the second
Shall by his wit help and releue
And Jacob made in plente to abound
With fulsum fode at morrow and eke at eve
That the hunger on no side ne grieve
Of the seventh year unto his lignage
And like as Joseph in his tendyr age
Thought he saw high up in heaven
Son and moan in his auysion
And therwithal sterris eke elleuen
Honor him with great devotion
Of this Joseph excellyng of renown
This new Joseph crist Ihesu him selue
Of the sterris and the signs twelve
Honowrid was with low subieccion
Though he lay low in an oxes stall^
For both troni and domynacion
And hole the court above celestyal
This high feste for a memorial
The laudis song in the heaven quere
Like as dauyd ^ad in the saultere
Preyseth the lord of the high empire
And with one voyse his birth glorefyeth
That has with love brent and set a fire
Seraphyn wherefore him magnefyeth
Between two bestis / though he in earth lies
Full humbly through his humylite
And now this feste of the natyuyte
The high angels and virtues all
Preysen him as they ben wont to done
And let the swetenes of their notis all
Down to the earth where goddis own sone
This day ^ath chose with us for to wone
And lies now wrappyd in his moders barme
Whom well softely with her holy arm
And with the fayrnes of his fyngres white
Full softely she does him enbrace
And in so much in heart does delight
His tender lymmes to welde and compace
And to behold the goodlyest face
That ever was forgyd by nature
For hit was he* I dar well you assure
Whom she beheld with her eyes meke
That from eter^e was in h^s faders thought
And one with him who can take keep
His own word that al made of naught
Whom a maid has to mankind brought
Through her mekenes of heaven and earth queen
The lynyal stock of Judah to sustene
Whom that Jacob on his fatal day
When antropos should his threde untwine
Which c^o^o had put long in delay
And lachesis or they would it fine
Began to bless and thus to hem deuyne
When al his brethern stood enuyron
This old gray with a full soft sown
O Judah Judah thy brethern euerichone
Shall praise and worship the great renoun
Of thyn estate which shall of al thy foon
The pride oppress and make hem lowte down
That shall be clepyd the whelpe of the lion
The ryal best which maugry who says nay
Shall mighty be to catch and take his pray
And prowdly bear hit home unto his cave
My sone Judah in thy dredeful tene
For through thy might thou shall victory have
Magre echone that the reuers mean
For who shall mow withstand or sustene
Thy kyngly power to make resistance
Ageyn thy manhood and thy magnyficence
That shall in the so clearly show and shine
Without clipsyng of any manner cloud
The septer of whom / in soth shall never fine
To be famous by report of law loud
Ne never cese / ne in covert shroude
Till a duc arise of thy kynrede
Whom all the world shall obey and dread
The which in soth is for to be sent
Out of thy sede by succession
Like a king to hold his parliament
With his kegys and his regyon
And he shall be to every nation
Sothfast abydyng and socour in her need
And he shall bind his mighty stern stead
Of very force at the holsom vine
And tie his ass under the grapys read
And he his stole / that like to god does shine
And his palle by might of his manhede
Shall wesshe in grapys that shullen blede
The reed blood deper than scarlet hew
And thus arrayed in his vester new
Of look be shall be sterner to behold
Than the stremys of the light sterre
And of eyes fayrer many fold
Than wine fynyd shynyng through a verre
And like yuore that comyth fro so far
His tethe shall be even smothe and white
And like in soth as Joseph list endyte
The sone of Jacob in his testament
Whereto his children / he makyth mention
Tofore his death with full devout entente
His presence as they knelyn down
To hem rehercyng the great auysion
Which he had in egypt goon full yore
In the foreste among the holtes hoar
How that he saw twelve hertes white
Full lustely goo in her pasture
And after that as lyncolne list to write
He saw of Judah borne a creature
Of thought and deed a very maid pure
And in his dreme he thought he did seen
Of her brought forth / without spotte al clean
A lamb most fair to his Inspeccion
That ever he saw / unto his plesaunce
On whose lift hand stood a fierce lion
And bestys al by one alyaunce
That were in earth through cruel resemblaunce
A forcyng hem by sheltron in battle
By fell malice this fair lamb to assail
But or they avail might in fight
The lambys power made hem for to deye
And hem vanysshed through his humble might
That man and aungel when they this conquest seye
They fyllen down and the lamb did obey
Sent of god this meke werriour
Which was borne to be our savior
Unto mankind and proteccion
To slay the lion that he may not endure
And according with his auysion
This lamb of god clad in our armure
This day was borne of a maid pure
And lord of al here in a litel cage
By kyn descendyd out of lignage
Of the worthy and mighty brethern two
And as burion out of a stock growyng
Right so this child from leuy / and also
Fro mighty Judah grew out succedyng
Borne of the blood to be priest and king
So entremedlyd by succession
Of both these two was the generation
Till the branches be run and so far gone
By lynyal course descendyng as a steyre
Till the kynredes were both grown in to one
In to a branch to have her repeyre
That was preuyd plainly to ben air
The right of leuy in preesthode to succeed
And by Just title who so list take heed
For to be king and bear the dyademe
After his fader and be successoure
To worthy Judah of Israel to queme
To be her prince and mighty gouernoure
And fro Jacob this burion and this flower
First began spring / to Iesse till hit raught
And so forth down till the buddes caught
How nature obeys to virgynyte ca xlix
tHe holy sides in a pure virgyne
To bear fruit that shall mankind save
And now this day the prophecye to fine
In bethleme within a lityl cave
Kind and maid such werre have
For this matere how no creature
To mannys might Justly by nature
That been contrary have her restyng place
For maid and mother shortly for to seye
In one person to gyder may not trace
For by kind that one must void aweye
But in this caas nature did obey
To a maid and gave up hole her right
Wisely aduertyng / she was to feeble of might
In this matter to hold chaumpartye
With her that was of face most benygne
Wh^rfore she wydeth al rancour and envy
And humbly her quarrel does resign
For hi^ were vain for nature to malygne
Though she of kind be the emperesse
Again her lord that made her so maystresse
That she mote need of necessyte
In every thing to his will obey
And be mynyster unto his volunte
Sith of her might / he berith him self the keye
For in to her by no manner weye
It is no wrong ne no preiudyce
Though of a maid without sin or vice
That was so holy and parfyt found at all
He would grace descend down so low
To take the clothyng f^^el and mortalle
Of our kind to make a burion grow
That never was of man set no sow
But with a word and the consenting
Of a maid a gra^fe burgenynge
Of Judas stock this day began appe^^
When crist was bore of a maid free
And the fader sent his sone dear
Down to the earth to make an vny^^
By parfyt love and fervent charity
Eternally be bond that may not fail
Fully assurid by weddyng and spousayle
Between his sone his chosyn cite
And holy church perpetually to last
And in a chaumbre by excellence fair
Of maydenhede that him self cast
The holy knotte and the bond so fast
Y bounden was that it may never untwine
And of that array for to termyne
Where the feste and the weddyng was
In all the earth y hallowed and y hold
In a closette more clerer than verre or glass
Or any ^erelle brighter to behold
For by record of patriarchs old
The chaste chaumbre was within adorned
With gold of faith fair bright y borned
With charity that yeuyth so clear a light
To recomforte all that ben in presence
And with silver depuryd out so bright
Thorugh high wysdom of ghoostly sapyence
And all the ge^^^nee that have excellence
In moral virtue for to show and shine
The closette chosen so clearly enlumyne
That of uncleanness there may no clipsyng be
So fulsum light is there of parfytnesse
For there the violettes men may behold and see
Of clean intent and of holiness
With roses strewyd in god to have swetnesse
And with lylyes of chastyte y meynt
And thereof color that never will be feynt
This^ vyolet^is betoken maydenhede
Like to purpyl in sign of victory
And in this chamber full of honest dread
The chose closette the chaste oratorye
This day in soth the high king of glory
To show his might how he for man began wir^he
Y spowsid has our mother holy church
And like a spouse he procedyd is
Out of his chaumbre for to rectefye
All that was wrong or in our kind amys
Wherefore this feste for to glorefye
Full long agoon to sing his psalmodye
The king dauyd entune did his harp
And with the tenours and the trebblys sharp
He to heaven began enhaunce and reyse
This day of days most worthy and famous
And al prophets in her sawes preyse
This noble feste / this feste gracious
And fro heaven with voys melodyous
Aungelis full low / sone down alyght
For to honor this holy night
The night of nyghtes hyghhest of echone
Excellyng all as in worthynesse
For in this world was creature none
In heaven ne earth ne in sothfastnesse
On land ne see that with great business
Her deuoyr did this night to honor
Him that was borne mankind to socoure

wonderful tokenys capitulo

Was sothely showed his natyuyte
In bethlehem how of a maid pure
A child was borne most souerayn of deg^^e
And first of all in rome the cite
His birth was showed hyghly by miracle
For wall and roof tow^is and pynacle
Of the temple most famous in the town
To god of p^es that was consecrate
The same night to ground fyl down
Plain with the earth waste and dyssolate
In which temple most ryal of estate
The statue stood of mighty romulus
And at the byldyng the storye tellyth thus
Of this temple they of rome went
To appollo with humble sacrefyse
To have answer in her best intent
How long this fane ryal of asyse
So strong bylte and in so trusty wise
That it should last ever and endure
Again the assente of any creature
Or parturbyng on any manner side
And he gave answer unto one and all
How this temple with his wallys wide
With his crestys and batalyng ryalle
Shall ever stand sure wythouten fall
Unto the time that a maid child
And they anon that first made it bylde
Of this answer glad and full credyble
That this temple ever should stand
For hem thought it was Inpossyble
A maid ever either on see or land
To have a child and so they understand
And they anon yaue tho temple a name
By (...) assent for the great fame
And called i^ as I can discern
The temple of pees with his walls white
And therewith named is eterne
And at the enter so they did write
But on the night the truth to endyte
When christ was borne of a maid clean
This temple fyl down endlonge the grene
To fulfille the true prophecye
Of appollo that told hem all this thing
And in that place / in worship of marye
And of her sone of heaven and earth king
Standyth a church full ryal of byldynge
And even like the sylf same time
The great statue long or hit were pryme
Of romulus that was deyfyed
Fell to the earth and brast on pecys small
And though romans made him stellefyed
His great heed for all that did auale
Of whom all the werkmen made a tale
That forgyd it many a day before
And in soth till a child were bore
Of a maid hit should stand up riyht
This great image and never his heed enclyne
But he alowted upon the same night
When christ was bore of a pure virgyne
Like as the werkman did aforne deuyne
Ageyn the conceyt and the entencion
Of that he mente in his opinion
I find also that the skies done
Which of custom curteyne so the night
The same time with a sodayn son
Enchaced were that it wexid al light
As at mydday when phelus is most bright
To show sothely that the son of life
Was borne that night to stynte al our stryf
How the night of crystys by^th a wel^e in Rome ran oil capitulo lj
aNd even than as books also tell
In very soth withouten any were
The sylf time in rome was a well
Of his stremys passyngly entere
To look upon as any crystal clear
From his vaynys as hit did boil
Of which the water changed in to oil
The same night / and to tybre ran
So large plente that al might hit see
Of which well long beforne or thanne
Al opynly in rome the cite
Sybylle the wise that had soueraynte
Of prophecye planly wrote and told
That the water of this well should
The same night change his lycoure
In to oil / and so a day endure
When of this world was borne the savior
In bethelem of a maiden pure
And as I find also in scripture
The same day high in the fyrmamente
Toward the party of the oryent
Were seen three sons lustely appear
Eueriche of hem large rownde and bright
That cast abroad his fair bemys clear
Thorugh all the world in every mannys sight
The which sons drew line right
Her course holdyng in haste and that anon
Till they three were joined in to one
To mankind plainly to declare
That he was borne in whom were founden three
To encrees our joy and our welfare
Flessh and soul and eke the deyte
Knytte al in one by sothfast unity
Which as a son wydyng shoure and shade
Was born this day all the world to glade
How the senatis of rome would have holden octauyan her emperor as for her god
capitulo lij
also in rome as writes Innocente
In his cronycle making mention
How the senates al by one assent
In consistorye of affeccion
Which they had in her opinion
Unto her noble and mighty emperor
Octauyan of worthynes the flower
Wolden echone him have deyfyed
And called him by name Inmortalle
The which thing when he had espied
As he that was full prudent found at all
To his presence made anon to call
Sybylle that was myrrour of sapyence
Here upon to here her sentence
And therwithal that she mote deffyne
Without doubt or ambyguyte
As far in soch as phoebus does now shine
If there were any of power more than he
Or peregall unto his degree
From este to weste here in earth low
In all this world that she could of know
And this was done upon the self day
When christ was borne in bethlem by miracle
And she full wisely nolde put him in delay^
To give answer making a small obstacle
Till at the last the fine of her oracle
Amyd the chaumbre of the emperor
Standing enuyron / many a senator
Was plainly thus with chere and face bold
O emperor lift up anon thyn eye
And look up yonder / and see the sercle of gold
About the son which ethe is to espy
And there behold thou may hit not deny
A maid sit of beaulte most soueyrene
Holdyng a child in her arms tweyne
And yet anon as octauyan
Saw the child by clear Inspeccion
With out abode / a voys he herd than
From alofte unto the chamber down
Behold and see with humble affeccion
This is the altar of the high heaven
Set in the son clear as any leven
Wherefore sybylle all abroad began seye
To him anon / and list not for to bide
Thy crown auale / and the child obey
Whose face the son bright may not hyde
And let now be al thy p^mpe and pride
And at one word she platly began him tell
The chyldes might his power did excelle
Which thing when he began plainly understand
Of faithful will and hole heart entere
He knelyd down and list no lengre stand
And with encence cast in the sencere
He did worship unto the aultere
And to the child most excellent of fame
And list no more usurp on him the name
To be called ageyn al skylle and right
Wrongfully a god since there is but one
And right anon this noble worthy knight
Thorugh out the world his precept made to gone
To prouynces and contreyes euerichone
Upon pain of death that none of hem all
Be hardy more / a god him for to call
For he well wist by signs opynly
And euydencis eke in specialle
There was one borne of power more worthy
Than was him self / and thereto Inmortalle
To whom no thing in earth is peregalle
Of all this world of high ne low estate
And for this skylle after dedycate
Was that chaumbre by high devotion
To marye plainly this is no nay
And called eke for this auysion
A ra ce^^ / yet unto this day
The name abides / and slydeth not away
Ne lesyth not the light of his brightness
Through none eclipsyng of foryetefulnesse
And in edgady the lusty large vynes
That time of year of her kind bare
Began florisshe and flower / and instead of vynes
With rich^ bawme her branches to repair
And the virtue that winter made bare
Through constraynyng of cold in the rote
Nature made wi^h fressh blossoms sote
To assende upon the same night
Upon the croppe with fruit and leaves new
Making the bowys as lusty to the sight
As fresshe and as fair of color and of hew
And as plenteuous her color to renew*
As in septembre when bachus has powere
To show his might that time of the year
Lo how the lord and the mighty king
That has lordshyp over grape and vyn^
Unto whose might every manner thing
Heaven and earth must enclyne
Can branches bare / with fressh flowris fine
Array new / though they be scer and old^
In frosty winter and in weder cold
As in somer when phoebus is alofte
When flora reygneth in may / and in aprille
And make blossoms to be as smothe and soft
Amyd decembre when men for cold of chylle
Wherefore this feste freely at his will
The night I mean of his natyuyte
To show his might in erbe flower and tree
He made the vynes as ye have herd me seyn
In edgady her bawme for to shede
When they were most nakyd and barayn
And out of seson who so can take heed
Of which night long aforne I read
That in egypt the prophet Ieromye
Full opynly in his prophecye
To the prestys of that kingdom told
That the Idols of her temples all
Withouten any rest by miracle should
Break her neckys and to ground fall
When a maid in an oxes stalle
Has borne a child this thing shall betyde
Wherefore the prestes in her fanes wide
Of very faith and of high credence
Secretly upon a lityl stage
Upon his word with humble reverence
Of a maid let make an image
And in her arm a child of tendyr age
Doing thereto in her paynym wise
After her rytes a manner of sacrefyse
And on this heste / ay fro year to year
They were awaytyng when that it would be
Till on a day of hap the king came nere
The noble worthy and wise Tolome
The which thing when that he did see
Anon of hem the cause he began enquere
Why and wherefore the image was set there
And they echone of one entencion
Yaue answer / and list not for to lie
It was ordained of old tradycion
Showed toforne thorugh holy prophecye
In which they did faithfully espy
Vndyspayrid the heste shall not varye
Of the prophecye / a while though hit tarry
And sothfastly in conclusion
Upon the time of the natyuyte
The false ydolis in egypt fyl down
And al to braste / in pecys moo than three
To show trewly that y borne was he
Of heaven and earth that has the regallye
And shall destroy all false mawmetrye

A large statue femynyne of face
That made was of coper and of bras
Large and long and wonderful to see
And of entayle divided the compass
This great image called should be
Goddess of rome and like a mageste
In her right hond should also hold
A large world full stern to behold
Which should of rowndenes have the figure
To signefye that she most glorious
The cite has holy in her cure
And how by her they were victorious
And here upon most excellent famous
They did a werkman seek up and down
And to parforme thorugh out all the town
And at the last of hap such one they find
That passyd all to work in entayle
And was subtyl both of wit and mind
To work in metalle and said he nold not fail
Of this empryse that may so much avail
To the cite and shortly in this caas
Thorugh his engyne hit parformed was
So ryally / in the world no man
Could amend hit in that ylke tide
And to behold hit many a thousand ran
So glad of hit they were on every side
Till at the last one of very pride
Presumtuously began to cry and call
And said shortly the leggys were to small
So great a work long to sustene
For lack only of good proporcion
Wherefore anon with sodayn ire and tene
The werkman brent in his opinion
Rebukyng him of his presumpsion
And suddenly parturbyd in his mind
Answerid ageyn shortly as I find
As it had been halfendele in scorn
And said friend if thou can understand
Till that a child be of a maid borne
I undertake that this work shall stand
Thyn bred is dull in water and in land
To lack thing thou can not amend
And the werkman sother than he wend
Has of this work said and prophesied
For on the night when that crist was borne
In very soth hit may not be denied
Of brass the goddess is broke and to torn
And all the cost / of the work forlorn
In sign only that the lord and sire
And mighty king of the high empire
Was borne that time in the lityl town
Of bethlem / of a pure vyrgyne
To whose power and domynaciowne
Great rome mekely shall enclyne
For erthely lordshippes needs must fine
With all their pomp / and lowte to him low

Of which sonme shall vanysshe and appayre

That shall by kind be furious and wode

Out of the stock of Judah that shall haunte

Of heaven king of earth lord and sire
And him that has all the hole empire
Of land and see and the monarchye

O blessed lady flower of virgynyte
We prayen echone o well of our welfare
Like a mother not thy milk to spare
Give him plente that is so plenteous
Of fulsomnesse angels to feed
And give him sowke the pyment gracious
Of thy pappes let thy condyte shede
The sweet milk al about in bread
Moderly it making to auale
On his fair tendyr lymmes small
Glad may thou be that sauf list to vouche
With his soft round lyppes lyte
To have plosaunce thy brestis for to towche
Only to sowke thy blessed pappys white
And that him list so godely to delight
For his play to have so much bliss
Ever among thy holy mouth to kiss
And suddenly with childely chere Iocounde
Than anon thy whyt neck to enbrace
With his soft tendyr armies round
And than attones fall on thy face
And of his eyes fulfilled of al grace
A goodely look to the ward enclyne
And so forth his chekys leye to thyn
And with his fyngrys mowth and eyes touch
His small pawmys on thy chekis leyne
His young face between thy pappys couche
And hold him stylle with all his besy pain
And grype hem fast with his hondes tweyne
For therein was his heavenly repaste
Thy young sone when he list break his fast
There was his fode and his norisshyng pure
Sothfast seleer of his sustenaunce
The tonne of life that ever did endure
Ay like fresshe unto his plesaunce
With sacrid lycour of holy habundaunce
That none but he may touch ne appronhe
For hit for him was only set a broche
For in that lycour is full remedy
Holy refuyte and plain medecyne
Ageyn the venym brought in by envy
Thorugh false engyne and malice serpentyne
When the snake made adam to dyne
Of the appyl that was intoxicate
Falsely with god to make him at debate
But now the milk of thy pappys tweyne
Benygne lady is to us tria^le
Within thy breast spryngeth from a vein
Against the death to be to us obstacle
O how it is a passing high miracle
Through gods might / and by naught else
Out of a breast to see two small wellys
Of a maid spryngyng as a ryuere
To give him drink that is king of all
O goodely lady / o heavenly botel^re
When we in myschyef to the clepe and call
Sum drope of grace let upon us fall
And to that celer make a ready weye
Where thou of mercy allone berist the key^
And of grace let be no scarsete
Good lady that art of grace well
For now this day in earth is borne of the
The sothfast god of heaven earth and hell
Which is come down with us for to dwell
And has of the our mortal kind y take
Of al our woo an end for to make
Sometime fro heaven fy^ down the manne
To refresshe the hungry in her need
And that befyl in deserte right thanne
When moses the people did led
But now this day in earth man to feed
An humble maid to all that ben true
In this desert has brought manna new
Which to aungel is the food of life
To man repaste of joy and of gladness
Chyef recomforte and restoratyf
To al feeble oppressyd with sickness
O good lady o myrrour of meekness
Benygne flower of womanhede the well
In this deserte where as now we dwell
Send us thy manna of souerayn hertes hele
To our comfort and consolacion
And let us grace in thy mercy feel
For our refuyte and refeccion
And in this vale of confusion
Let the grace fro the skies rain
The manna of life that we may attain
For thou allone ar^ comfort synguler
To al tho that no refuyte conne
This day also of mercy the ryuere
Fro which al grace is to mankind run
The sterre also that has brought forth the son
The sone of life in earth for to wone
O maid o mother o daughter of thy son
Which none in soth sith the world began
Was both two but thy self allone
For who is he that remember can
First or last late or else soon
So bright a son spryng of so fair a moan
Save this day the son of life most shene
From the aroos and thou a maid clean
Without eclipsyng or lesyng of thy light
For thou a mother and maid both two
In v^^tu^ay^e like shene and bright
O fair ^oose / o roose of Ierico
That have this day god and man also
In bethelem borne ageyn the greye morrow
The night to void of al our old sorrow
Of liknessis of our lady in commendacion of her capitulo lix
nOw fair ^edre cy^resse of syon
Spryngyng light of nazareth
Chosen chamber of wise salamon
Flower of the field swettest on holte and heth
Of whom al virtue saves men fro death
Of syloe the water eke depurid
Whereby the lepre of Naman was recuryd
Laud and glory of Iherusalem
Thou named art and of Israel gladness
Holsom cestern this day of bethlehem
The thrist of dauyd to s^aunche and distress
Of paradyse the well in sothfastnesse
Foyson that flows in to sundry royames
The soil to adewe with his sweet stremes
The land also of promyssyon
That milk and honey both in fere shedyth
The soil and ground of our sauacion
With his herbys that fosterith us and fedeth
Now blessed maid whose mercy ever needs
Also that lyuen in thy seruyse
This high feste so for us deuyse
That in honor of thy sone dear
We may of heart read sing and pray
And let the stremys of thyn eyes clear
Thy servants / o lady mine conueye
To continue fully until we deye
The to serve with hertely love and dread
As most is plesyng to thy womanhede
And this feste of festys pryncipalle
Called the feste of the natyuyte
Make love and pees to reygne oueralle
And hertis joy with parfyt unity
Void al dyscorde and let no rancour be
In hertes closed by malice or enmyte
But of thy grace so govern us and gye
This high feste in which thy sone was borne
Now this mydwynter night with full affeccion
While phoebus shyneth in the caprycorne
We may the serve with all devotion
And lady mine in conclusion
Now this monthe that called is decembre
Upon thy servants faithfully remember
How christ was circumcisyd capitulo lx
When Ianus bifrons in cold January
With frosty berde entryd in the year
And phoebus chare neyeth to aquarie
His watery bemys tofore feuerere
When that his light was pale and nothing clear
And from him late was passyd lucyne
The same night as I saw her shine
A ourned new with bemes glad and merye
On the heaven and cast his stremys down
I began remember of the high ferye
That called is the circumcision
How hit befyl than by reuolucion
By just acountyng in the calendere
The first day of the new year
And thought I would in my book proceed
Of this feste somewhat for to write
And to the gospel first I began take heed
Of this day how luke list to endyte
Though he thereof speak but a lyte
And was full brief and compendyous
Yet of this day high and glorious
He writes plainly and says how that anon
After the day of the natyuyte
When eight days passed were and gone
The child was brought with all humylite
To the temple lowly for to be
As the law of the Iewys has devised
The eight day to be circumcis^^n
And he thereto mekely did obey
And with a knyf made full sharp of stone
His mother lokyng with a pyteou^ eye
The child was corue therwythal anon
That al about the reed blood began gone
Without abode as says bonauenture
And for the pain he did endure
And for sharpenes of the sodayn smerte
The child began weep that pity was to he^^
Wherefore his mother of very tendyr heart
Out brast on teris and might her self not stere
That al bydewyd were her eyes clear
When she saw him that she louyd so
So young so fair to weep so for woo
But he anon in all his passion
For all that he was so young of age
In manner he had a compassyon
To see his mother to weep in her rage
And put his hand unto her vysage
On mouth and eyes passyngly benygne
And as he could goodely made a sign
Withouten speech to stynte her weeping
That came to her of moderly pity
And she full well conceyuyth his menyng
From point to point and than anon began she
To look on him that was so fair to see
And his feturis consideryd by and by
And in her arms wonder womanly
She took him up and prayed him be stylle
As of moderis is plainly the manner
And he in all obeys to her will
Though he were yo^ge and began to change his cher^
And with her kerchye^ she made his eyes clear
On his chekys in all that ever she may
Full moderly the trerys wypte away
How in four manner of wyses christ was circumcisid capitulo lxj
and like of alquyn as it is deuysid
That crist Ihesu who so list to see
In four manners was trewly circumcisid
First of his fader at his natyuyte
With the knyf of wylful pouerte
And now this day which is not feyned
Eke with a knyf by the law ordained
The third manner ye may eke consider
How with the knyf of great aduersite
That he was kyt first when he came hyder
Taking for us our humanyte
And alther last with full cruelte
For us he suffrid circumcision
Upon the cross during his passion
How crist suffryd circumcision in his chosen people capitulo lxij
eKe in four manner who so can take heed
Christ in is chosen by good Inspeccion
Here in this world withouten any dread
Of new he suffrid circumcision
The first is made by false detraccion
That kytteth aweye both friend and fame
And the shynyng of her good name
The second is by false tyranny
Of such that have no conscience at all
But takes aweye by cursid robbery^
Unrightfully her goods temporalle
And the third sothely is most mortall^
Of heretykes that falsely dysobeye
To holy church and to our faith vareye
The fourth is made by effusion of blood
Of tyrauntes that the body sleeth
When they of malice ageyn the faith stood
To execute her venym up by deeth
To make marters to yield up the breeth
Whom crist Ihesu eternally in glory
Ordained has a palm of victory
Eke five times christ in his manhede
Shad his blood by effusion
And alther first when he did blede
Upon the day of circumcision
And next in soth tofore his passion
Upon the hylle for anguysshe when he swette
The read blood which al his body wette
The third time his blood most virtuous
Began run out by many a cruel wound
When that he was this king most gracious
Of the Jews to a pyler bound
The fourth time eke as it is found
He spent his blood for our alther good
When he was naylyd high upon the rood
And alther last when longeus a fere
Thorugh his heart plainly as I find
On caluere him percyd with a spear
That blood and water as books make mind
Began streme down to his eyes blind
By whose virtue anon this paynym knight
Only of g^^ce recouerd has his sight
And in books eke as it is told
How the py^ce of his Incision
Was by an aungel in an vrne of gold
To charks brought in a vysion
And be anon of great affeccion
Of this miracle for the excellence
Made hit be kept for great reverence
And at A^on but if books lie
Full many year by reuolucion
In a church sothely of marye
But clerkys have an opinion
That the day of resurrexyon
When christ Ihesu rose from death to live
The same py^ce returned as blyue
To the place where that it came fro
Sythen that it was sothely as I find
Of his manhood parteynyng thereto
And a party longyng to his kind
Though hit be so that books make mind
That in rome it is yet preseruyd
And year by year when this feste is served
In a church which men of custom call
Sancta sanctorum of old foundation
The same day there the prestys all
Solem^nely make a stacion
When all the people goon on processyon
Fully in h^pe better for to speed
From year to year there they sing and read
And ferthermore the storye does deuyse
The same day right forthwyth anon
In the temple as they him circumcise
He named was Ihe of echone
The which name long or that agone
Was of the aungel told and said before
To his mother or that he were bore
How the people of god that our Iosue had in governance weren sauyd by the
steadfast believe of the name of Ihesus capitulo lxiij
aNd to reherce the great worthynesse
Of this name which may not be described
My wits ben so dulle with rudeness
And in the chain of ygnoraunce guyded
That I alas of konnyng am depry^ed
Through lack of wit in any manner wise
To vnderfonge so passing high empryse
For this is the name who so can discern
Most excellent and most of dygnyte
The name of namys sacrid from eterne
As says bernard who so list to see
Fygurid first unto Iosue
Thorugh his knyghthode / when he should led
The people of god to save hem in her need
For this is the name that hertis most desire
For therein is so passing sweetness
For it may best hem with grace enspyre
And with plente of al goodely richesse
It is comfort and socoure in sickness
Refuyte also / rest and remedy
To al tho that felen maladye
Against langour the best medecyne
In all this world that o where may be found
For this name is so heavenly and deuyne
That hertes seek hit does with hele habounde
It curith soris / it he^ith every wound
And sauyth man fro many a sword and spear
Where ever they ryden in land far o^ nere
It is first written in the book of life
For worthyest and most of reverence
And it is eke best preseruatyf
Ageyn the assent of the vyolence
Of wicked air to void pestelence
And from the death hem that playnen sore
Of his virtue to health it does restore
It is also sothfast sauacion
To all that be in pouerte and in need
It is deffence / it is proteccion
In each parille and in every dread
It is also the guerdon and the mede
In them that been in exyle of oultrage
Repeyre fynal of her pilgrimage
This is the well with the four stremys
Whereof writes bernard in his sentence
That thorugh the world refresshith al royames
It is so holsom and of such excellence
The first be callyth the streme of sapyence
Of which the flood most Inly is habounde
And rightwysnesse he namyth the secounde
And the third be callyth holiness
For hit excellyth in perfeccion
The fourth also as I can express
Is the flode of our redemption
And of the first in conclusion
Of which the stremes ben so fressh and fine
Who so looks a right is hoole our doctrine
And of his right to make mention
The holsom well ever does flow and flete
With mercy medlid and remyssyon
Tofore his dome his ire for to let
And of the third the water is so sweet
By good ensaumple who so can dyscerne
In virtue ay how we shullen us govern
And of the fourth to speak in specialle
Is al our health and sauacion
For therein is our remedy fynall
Against death and full proteccion
Whose blood spronge out of cristes passion
And who that list by water to attame
He shall hit find closyd in the same
Of parfyte richesse it is t the resorye
Which may not waste buty liche abide
The fire it quenchith also of envy
And repressith the bolnyng eke of pride
And through mekenes settith ire a side
And who that has this name in remembrance
Him the spyryte of sloth may do no greuaunce
It is also the mighty pauyce fair
Ageyn wanhope and dysperacion
Cristal shield of pallas for despair
Thereto avoid the foul abusion
And who that makes his Inuocacion
To this name with heart of stablenesse
It yeuyth him strength and also sikernesse
The cruel fire and brennyng to withstonde
Of lecherye and al temptacion
It is refuyte to fre and eke to bond
That have therein her hoole affeccion
Whose virtue was to king salamon
Full long aforne in deuyne oracle
As I find showed by miracle
How prophets and marters suffreden death for the name of Ihesus capitulo
This is the name of prophets specifyed
In her writing and in her books old
Of apostles most hyghly magnefyed
By whose virtue they the truth told
This made also marters to be bold
And mighty like scerne champyons
With stable heart to suffer her passions
By this name they were victorious
In her turment patience to have
This is the name that ygnasius
Had in his heart of gold deep y grave
Whereof the tyrant began him sore abaue
When that he saw his heart cut a tweyne
(...) letters new depycte in every vein
(...) name that to confessouris
(...) in her abstynence
(...) is the (...) that in sharp shouris
(...) lust was hoole her deffence
(...) y^ue hem might to make resistance
Ageyn sin and knyghtly to warreye
and to continue in virtue till they deye
It is the feste and the figured food
Of maydenhede and of virgynyte
The oil of grace holsom to al good
Which in the lamps of parfyte chastyte
Brennyng so clear with love and charity
That worldly wyndes boystous and blowyng
Ne may not quench the light of his shynyng
This is the name that most yeuyth melodye
Unto the ere and the swettest sown
It is the name of heavenly armonye
To void out sin and al temptacion
With full accord against deuysion
It causes hertes no longer to debate
That partyd ben with the wreste of hate
This name is joy of sorrowful in distress
Eternal mede of hem that lyu^n in bliss
Salve unto hem that langour in sickness
Vesture in cold to hem that clothes mysse
Souerayn repaste hungry for to wysse
For to ascape the cruel vyolence
Of needs sword whetted with Indygence
Christ is the name of sothfast sacrament
That first was yeuen of holy vnccion
And he was called first for this intent
For he for man should make oblacion
And for he came for our sauacion
To (...) aweye the rust of al our blame
He has of Ihesus worthily the name
I find in books of old antyquyte
In his writing as clerkys list express
How there were four persons of degree
Sometime anoynte for her worthynesse
Sum for manhood and sum for holiness
With obseruaunce and solempnyte
As was couenable unto her degree
Prophets prestys and they that beren crowns
As worthy kings of every regyon
Anointed weren and mighty champyownes
Within palastre thorugh her high renown
Or in champcloos hardy as lion
Enter would sum quarrel to darreyne
Syngulerly by empryse of hem tweyne
And crist was al by reason as I preue
First prophet by Informacion
And by his doctrine most worthy of believe
And he was eke the mighty champyon
That syngulerly for our sauacion
Faught with the fend and had of him victory
Maugre his might and wanne the palm of glo^^
And he was priest man to reconsile
That banyssid was out of his heritage
Whom a serpent falsely did exyle
Of falce malice in a sodayn rage
And he was borne only by lignage
To be a king and by power eterne
When he is crowned his people to govern
How christ Ihesu was both prophet priest king and mighty champyon capitulo
lxvj
nOw crist Ihesu sothfast priest and king
And for mankind most worthy warrioure
Prophet also and trewest in living
Be thou our help / be thou our socoure
And like a king be thou our gouernoure
And champyon to help us in our need
And like a prophet to wisshen us and read
O crist Ih^su to the I clepe and cry
Fro day to day to help us and releue
And of thy grace us wretches for to gye
Or that thou thy rightwysnes preue
Let pity first the to mercy meue
And or thy sword of vengeance us manace
Let troth before thy rightful dome enbrace
For of our help thou art the pyllere
Ageyn despair holy our sustenaunce
Our strength our might our re^uyte fer and nere
In each perille to save us from myscheaunce
Thou art our force and our sustenaunce
And in myschyef when dread would us assail
Thou art our shield thou art our supportayle
Thou art mighty and thou art meke also
Thou art rightful / and thou art merciable
Lamb and lion called both two
And sothfast king whose reygne is Inmutable
To repentaunte / by rygour not vengealle
And ever aforne in ponysshyng of thy law
Pees to prefer / or right his swerd may draw
And to bring the lost sheep ageyn
Out of deserte in to his pasture
That was errant idle / and in vein
O crist Ihesu of thy benygne cure
More ready ay to save and to cure
All that ben sore / and scabbyd eke with sin
Rather with pity than thou with reddur win
Now thou that art the very rightful ligne
All that is crokyd goodely to redress
And master of mercy al our myschyef fine
O crist Ihesu well of al swetnesse
Lord of pity and lord of rightfulnesse
Have upon us this day compassyon
That called is thy circumcision
And graunt^ us grace with dew reverence
This high feste so noble and so dygne
Worship and halowe deuoyde of al offense
And be to us goodely and benygne
That were this day markyd with the sign
And the carecte by the law ordained
Is very soth and no thing feyned
And so as thou that never did trespass
Through thy meekness and lowly subieccion
Suffer would this day of thy grace
For our offense / have circumcision
So kytte from us al temptacion
Of worldly lust and make the flessh to serve
To the spyryte till the body sterue
And grant us grace to live chaste and clean
O crist Ihesu while that we been here
Through the prayer of that heavenly queen
That is maid and mother eke in fere
With help of her grant us this new year
So prudently with virtue us provide
Our vices all that we may circumside
And crist Ihesu we pray unto the
Let thy name whether we ride or goon
In each peril and each aduersite
Be our defense against our mortal foo
To make hem stand stylle as any stoon
And all that casten us falsely to wareye
Make her malice mekely to obey
To thy name and make hem stand al back
Or they have power to hawnte her cruel might
And wicked spirits so horible and black
That besy ben to wait us day and night
Let thy name drive hem out of sight
And in our forhede when we Ihe Impresse
Make us of grace her malice to oppress
For to thy name holy we commend
Our life our death body heart and all
Our s^wle also when we hens wend
O crist Ihu o lord Inmortal
Prayeng to the when thou us deem shall
To save al tho from eternal shame
That have full faith and hoole trist in thy name
How by the prophecye of balaam watch was made upon an hylle capitulo lxvij
tHou lord whose light dessendith fro so fer^^
Through the roundenes of the speres nine
Withouten whom phoebus ne no sterre
Upon heaven power has to shine
Let now thy light my derknes enlumyne
That through thyn help I may my style gye
Somewhat to sey of thyn epyphanye
And let my breast benygne lord be dewyd
Down with sum drope from thy mageste
That was this day by a sterre y showed
Out of the este to worthy kings three
Which on this night of thy natyuyte
Began first aspye the bright bemys clear
Of this sterre on the heaven apere
Of whom the spring was not cansille
Of fortune ne sodayn adventure
For many a day or this thing befylle
And many a year by record of scripture
With a waytyng and wonder besy cure
In very soth as I remember can
A certain kynrede toward the occian
Which of the stock and the line came
Who so list look in books from a far
And of the blood of old balaam
That sometime had with his ass werre
The which said there should rise a sterre
Out of Jacob and from Israelle
Al be that he thereof no time could tell
Upon whose word fully in believe
There should arise such a sterre light
Weren twelve chosen the truth for to preue
Within mydwynter ever fro night to night
When in aquarie phoebus shadde his light
For to awayte in all her best wise
When this sterre in heaven would arise
And these twelve weren of kynrede
Of balam as ye have herd me tell
That year by year should take heed
Upon an hylle beside a lytyl well
And there in fere a certain space dwell
Anointed and bathed in clothes white
And they of custom to speak but a lyte
But in prayer and in certain rytes vsid
They must wake and wait in specialle
And none of hem platly to be excusid
Upon this hylle named victoryalle
And if one did that his sone shall
This statute old his place ocupye
^r effys one that were next of alye
(...) this committed during many year
(...) custom vsid of antyquyte
(...) phoebus went by meuyng circuler
^o they kept her times by degree
And each year weren certain days three
(...) ^a^kyng cast and computacion
Sought and chosen out by good eleccion
For (...) awayte the vprist by the morrow
Of this sterre with his lemes glade
Which balam said should avoid her sorrow
At his vp^^st whose bemes may not fade
To show his light in every shroude and shade
Without wrestyng or drawyng to declyne
Till at the last for the same fine
To see this sterre most famous of renown
On the heaven when hit should appear
The worthy kings as made is mention
Upon the hylle to gyder goon in fere
For cause they who so list to here
Were of the stock of balam down discendyd
Wherefore of sort the hylle they be ascendyd
As fyl on hem by custom to succeed
At a certain of the year by reuolucion
And on this hylle estward they took head
By good auyse in her Inspeccion
The same night of the Incarnacion
When crist was born in bethlehem of marye
The same our / the sterre they aspye
Of new aryson in the oryent
Full lusty of whom the bemes light
Began enlumyne all the firmament
From este to west it yaue so clear a light
That of the stremes every manner wight
Astonyd was they were so bright and shene
And to the eye / full persant for to seen
The which sterre drowe his course of right
Toward the hylle like as books tell
Where the kings the long wynters night
It to awayte solytarye dwell
And there anon upon her knees fell
And thankyd god with all her hertes lust
Which has not hem defrauded of her lust
How the three kings perceived the sterre capitulo lxix
aNd all that night to gyder as they woke
Upon this sterre that shone so fair and clear
And suddenly upward as they began look
They saw a child above the sterre appear
So young so fair in a golden spear
Full ryally stand / and above his head
A large cross that was of blood full read
The which child spoke to hem anon
Above the hylle with voice and chere benygne
And bad hem fast that they should gone
In to Judah right as any line
And follow alwey the sterre for a sign
That shall hem bring to that regyon
Where the king most worthy of renown
Was borne that time to have the regallye
Of Jews land of very dew right
To whom the sterre did specefye
When he was borne with his clear light
And they anon when passyd was the night
The next morrow no longer list abide
But toward him cast hem for to ride
With great array and ryal aparayle
As was sittyng to their worthynesse
They shope hem forth / and for they nolde not fail
To do honor to his nobleness
With hem they took gold and great richesse
To spend and give / and also for they meant
With yeftes great the child to present
And forth they gone no longer would they tarry
Through many a land / and many a diverse isle
Eueriche of hem on a dromedarye
Which weren so swyfte that full many a mile
They passyd have within a lityl while
That in the space of days thyrtene
By conduyte only of the sterre shene
They entrid ben in to Iherusaleem
That of Judah was the chyef cite
Conveyed ever with the bright beem
Of the sterre that was so fair to see
And when they amyd the cytee be
Not astonyed axed in audyence
Where is the king grettest of reverence
Of Jews borne for to bear the crown
Whose sterre we have seen in the oryent
That from heaven cast his stremys down
Which all the world under the firmament
Is glad to see / and we of one intent
Have yeftes brought out of our contre
Him to honor in his ryall see
And when herod of their coming knew
He troubelyd was / and also all the town
And began anon to change chere and hew
And made in haste a conuocaciyn
Of all the prestys dwelling enuyron
To know clearly / and be certefyed
Of the place that was specefyed
Of prophets where crist shall be borne
And they anon the truth to him told
In bethlehem as they full long aforne
Fownden out in her books old
And all the manner to him they unfold
From point to point as matthew makes mind
Redith his gospel and there ye shall hit find
How king herod sent for the three kings capitulo lxx
aNd than herod began the kings call
And of this matter entrid pryuely
And coriously how that it was fall
He began enquere and axyd besyly
And of the sterre also by and by
He axyd hem and in words few
How and what wise it began first show
And when they had told him every del^
They departed out of his presence
But first he ^ade hem to enquere
Of the child with all her dylygence
And when they had done him reverence
He charged hem under words fair
Homwardes by him al gates to repair
To give him clearly Informacion
Of her exploite and of the child also
Surely affermyng by false collucion
That he him self would sone after goo
Unto the child and his deuoyr do
To worship him / and al under colors
As the worm / or serpent under flowers
Da^^th full often and kepith him covertly
Of ky^de malice till they a time see
To shede her venym / and than suddenly
Al attones when they vnwarest be
They styngen and shewyn her cruelte
And her venym under flowers fair
Full often is hyd till they may appayre
Right so thou serpent full of Inyquyte
False tygre full of doubleness
Under fair color of humylite
Thy venym darith / and also thy falsenesse
O thou tyrant o rote of cursidnesse
Thou herod of malice most mortalle
What wenyst thou / him that knows al
To dysseyue with thy slyly wyle
What can sugar under galle feign
What wenyst thou the kings to begyle
And of malice bring hem in a train
Of whose coming though that thou dysdayne
It may not help plainly ne ^ayle
For of thy purpoos plainly thou shall fail
For by grace they shullen in quye^^
Maugre thy might all the danger pass
For though that thou with words honey sweet
Malyciously upon her death compass
They shullen escape despyte of thy face
For all the coniecte of thy princes wise
As the story shall anoue deuyse
And so wtth venym in his heart y look
He yaue hem leave pass thorugh his reme
In her repair him castyng to ^e wroke
If they return ageyn by Iherusaleme
And so the sterre hem brought to bethleme
And line right the chyldes head above
Where as he lay stylle began to houe
Of the joy that the kings had when they found christ capitulo lxxij
But who the joy could tell or endyte
Or with his mowthe the myrthe express
Or who can plainly with his pen write
The great bliss or the gladness
Which they made in sothfastnesse
After her journey and her long weye
Above the hows when they the sterre seye
That began to hem clearly certefye
Without more the chyldes dwelling place
And they anon fast began hem hye
With lusty heart and glad of chere and fa^^
To alyght down in a lytyl space
They made hem ready and with reverence
They entryn in / and came in to presence
Where as the child most worthy of degree
Was with marye in an oxes stalle
And humbly the kings al three
Forth they went toward the stalle
And brought her tresoure and her yeftes all
As reverently as they could deuyse
And him presented in all her best wise
Like as her astate eueriche after other
Making their present with all humylite
Like her age as brother after other
Gold frank and myrre they yaue him al three
After custom of perce and caldee
For of that land when kings present make
The custom is such yeftes for to take
And this was done with foyson and plentee
In very soth and great habundaunce
For in her present was no scarsete
For of richesse they had al suffysaunce
Wherefore they cast with devout obeysaunce
Of due right with the child to part
Of her tresoure or that they depart
And for gold is paid for tribute
As hit is found of antyquyte
Therefore the kings for a manner suit
That they him ought of very dewte
They brought him gold out of her contree
And yaue it him withouten repentance
Holy of heart for a recognysaunce
And frank also as clerkis can deuyse
Ordained is in conclusion
To god only to make sacrefyse
With contrite heart and devotion
Therefore to him for oblacion
They brought frank to signefye than
That he was both sothfast god and man
And for they would in all thing obey
To his hyghnes with all her besy cure
In token he should for mankind deye
They brought myrre to his sepulture
For like a man / death he most endure
And with his blood shed in his passion
For our trespace for to make redemption
In frank also who that can disserne
Is understand the high mageste
Of his power which that is eterne
And eke also his high deyte
The gold betokens his high dygnyte
And myrre declares unto us at all
Of his manhood that he was mortalle
And gold betokens of love the feruence
That he to man had of affeccion
And frank betokens the souerayn excellence
In holiness his conversation
And myrre betokens the tribulacion
That he suffrid and all the great penance
For us in earth by contynuaunce
In gold he was know as a king
In frank a priest who so can take heed
Of myrre also this day the offering
Was longyng only to his manhede
And thus he was withouten any dread
Both king and priest as I discryue can
And for our sake in earth a mortal man
In gold also most glorious metalle
Fygurid was his high deytee
In frank also that is so cordyalle
The soul also of christ most parfyte of degree
And myrre betokens through his dygnyte
His flessh the which by disposicion
May never suffer no corrupcion
And of thise yeftes passing reuerente
Full of mysterye and heavenly pryuyte
And when they had made their present
Unto the child ay sittyng on her knee
And with great auyse they began behold and see
Tofore that they remove from that place
His godely chere and his fair face
Consyderyng his feturis by and by
With great Insight / and humble entencion
And ay the more they look besely
The more they think in her Inspeccion
And thoughten alwey as in her reason
Though kind and god has set in one figure
The beauty holy of every creature
It might not in sothenes ^euen ben liche
To his fayrnes / neither peregall
For he that is above nature rich
Has made this child fairest in special
For in his face they be holden all
The hole beauty / and fayrnesse eke also
Of heaven and earth to gyder both two
Wherefore no wonder though they hem delight
Most passyngly upon him to see
For they in heart reioycen hem not alyte
On him to look that they have lyberte
For ay the more plainly that they be
In his presence the parfy^e hot fire
Of hertely joy hem brent in desire
And of one thing good head they took
How that the child demurely cast his sight
Toward hem and godely began to look
On her faces with his eyes bright
And how that he put his arms right
Goodely to hem making a manner sign
To them of thankyng / with chere full benygne
And of his mother they much thing enquere
Towchyng his birth with humble affeccion
And she answerith most femynyne of chere
Full prudently to every questyon
With chere demure / and look y cast adoun
With all the port of womanly clennesse
Her self demenyng chiefly with meekness
Of virtuous pouerte and meekness of our lady capitulo lxxiij
o She that was of heaven and earth queen
And of hell lady and pryncesse
O what was she alas that might sustene
To be proud considerid her meekness
O pride alas o rote of our distress
Though thy boost above the sky blow
Thy byldyng high shall be brought full low
O surquedrye alas why nylt thou see
How that she had heaven in her demeyne
And lady is both of land and see
And of the axtre between the poles tweyne
And of the enbracyng of the golden cheyne
Yet unto her I say in sothfastnesse
Above all this agreyd her meekness
O pomp elate with thy cheris bold
Remember and see and look how that she
Of whom kings have joy to behold
In her presence to knele on her knee
Though she of women be highest in degree
Take heed and see how lowly in a stable
How that she sat this lady honorable
Were therre of gold any clothes found
Of sylke damask or rich turturyne
Or was there aras about her head bound
Or was there any velwet crymsyne
Or was there any samyte or satyne
Or were there any tapytes large or wide
The nakyd ground to cover or to hyde
Or was her paleys bylte of lyme and stone
Or the pylers set on marbyl graye
Or the ground pauyd on to gone
Or fressh parlours glasid bright as day
Or were therein chambris of array
Or for estates was there any halle
Save a dongeon and and an oxes stalle
Or of her bed was the appareyle
Of gold and silk corteyned large about
Or were the shetis of long or wide entayle
Kytte out of raynes / nay without dowte
Or were there any ladies for to lowte
To her hyghnes with besy obseruaunce
Or of maidens any attendaunce
O as me seems of very dew right
Ye wymmen al sholden take heed
With your perlys and your stones bright
How that our queen flower of womanhede
Of no deuyse embrowdyd has her wede
Ne furrid with ermyn / ne with cristy graye
Ne marty^n ne sabyl I trow in good faye
Was none founden in her garmente
And yet she was the fairest for to see
That ever was under the firmamente
That me seems ye sholden have pity
To see a lady of so high degree
So semely atyrid o ye wymmen all
So narow closid in an oxes stalle
Let be your pride and your affection
Of rich array and no thing you delight
In worldly pomp and such abusion
Of soudry clothes read black and white
And be well ware or the spear byte
Of cruel death and the fell smerte
My counceyl is to lift up your heart
To that lady and to that worthy queen
That you may best help in your need
And you releue in every woo and tene
And deliver from al myschyef and dread
And think plainly and take right good head
That al shall pass array and eke richesse
When ye list wene and al your semelynesse
Let hem before be to you a kalendere
Isowde Eleyne / and eke polycene
Hestor also and dydo with her chere
And rich candace of ethyope queen
Lygge they not grave under colors grene
And yet all this may not your pride attame
Notwithstondyng that ye shall do the same
And after death abides no memory
For ay with death comyth foryetefulnesse
And fare well than array and al veynglorye
Save only virtue that stondith in sikernesse
I take record of the high meekness
Of her that is of holiness well
Of whom I think sothely for to tell
How that she satte for all her worthynesse
Holdyng her child lowly on the ground
And kings knelyng as ye have herd express
Beholding her in virtue most habounde
Till at the last they have a ^^yser found
To take her leave / and the same night
They began to ride homward al her might
How the aungel warned the three kings to pass not by herodes but by another
way capitulo lxxiiij
aNd suyng after on the next night
While they slepte at her lodgyng place
Came an aungel apperyng with great light
And warned hem that they naught ne trace
By herodes but that they should pace
Withouten taryeng / in all the haste they may
To her kingdom by another way
And in short time to their regyon
They ben repaired / the gospel tellyth thus
And of her names to make mention
The first in ebrew was called appelleus
The next amerus the third damarus
And in greek the first galgatha
And sarachym / the third malgalatha
And in latyne as books make mind
The first of hem named was Iaspar
And the second plainly as I find
Like mine auctour reherce as I dar
Called was and named balthazar
And the third ye get of me no more
As I read was called melchyore
Of whose repair as sum books seyn
That first of al they wenten to the sea
And retornyng to her kingdom ageyn
They shypped hem at tharse the cite
For which herod of cursyd cruelte
In tharse made all the ships brenne
Whereof write dauyd the sawter if ye kenne
And unto you clearly to specefye
Towchyng this feste and this solemnyte
Whereof is said this word epyphanye
Which is a word of great auctoryte
And said and compowned who so can see
Of epy first / and phanos soth to sayn
And one word compowned of these tweyne
Comes this word of epyphanye
And this word epy by dyscripsion
Is said of heyght as I can signefye
And of a showing by demonstracion
As phanos said / and so by good reason
Epy and phanos both knytte in fere
Is a showing that does a lofte appear
And for this day alofte was the sterre
Which crristes birth and Incarnacion
With his stremes began shede from so far
From este to weste in many a regyon
Whereof this feste in conclusion
As ye toforne have herd me specefye
This feste is called of epyphanye
The which feste has a prerogatyf
Of miracles notable in specialle
For things four wrought in cristes life
Weren on this day by his power ryalle
The first of al for a memoryalle
Is of the kings as ye have herd me said
Which were in ydel to reherce again
The second is / it is sothely told
That crist Ihesu / this day of saint John
The year when he was thyrty winter old
Baptized he was in the flom Iordayne
At which time three kings under one
Apperid this day worthy of memory
The first was that from the high glory
The faders voice as clerkis list endyte
Came down to earth that men might here
And like a down with fair federis white
The holy ghoost also did appear
And crist Ihesu the faders sone entere
This day apperyng in our mortal kind
Was of saint Johan baptyst as I find
And for as much as they al three
This day were seen by sothfast appearance
They being one in parfyte unity
Therefore this day of most reverence
Named is trewly in this sentence
Theophanos for god in treble wise
Therein apperyd as ye have herd deuyse
For the^s is as much for to mean
As god in englisshe if ye list to see
And phanos / as showing withouten wene
As ye have herd before rehercyd of me
For in earth o god in trynyte
This day apperid withouten any lie
Ye truly may it call theophanye
Eke when christ was old thyrty year
This day he turned water in to wine
That passyngly was to the eye clear
And of tarrage July good and fine
The which he sent to archedeclyne
And for this miracle July virtuous
In galile was showed in an house
This same day which man did espy
As holy church makes mention
Therefore hit is named bethphanye
For beth in englissh by dyscripsion
Is called an house or a mancion
Of which miracle renomed of fame
Bethphanye this day has the name
Eke in the year of his pass^on
Fer in deserte this day also I read
With ^oues five thorugh his great foyson
Five thousand I find that he did feed
Of which miracle if ye taken head
This day is last named phagyfanye
Like as first was clepyd epyphanye
For this word phagy in to our entente
Is said of fedyng of refeccion
For which miracle passing excellent
That is so famous and so high of renoun
Like as the gospel makes mention
Therefore this day among the other all
Ye justly may / it phagyfanye call
A declaracion of the three kings of their three yeftes capitulo lxxv
nOw crist Ihesu this day this high feste
We the beseech with heart will and thought
Only of mercy to here our request
For the miracles that thou therein have wrought
For love of hem that the so far have sought
The worthy kings that came out of caldee
The to honor in bethlehem the cite
And thorugh the prayers of these kings three
That for thy love token her vyage
Ihesu defend us from al aduersite
And make us strong and sure in our passage
In this exyle and parlous pylgremage
With our foo men of malice and of pride
Which have us bysette on every side
The which our gold of parfyte charity
Wolden us byreue by persecusion
That we should offer of f^ruen^ unto the
Of hertely love and high devotion
And eke our frank of contemplacion
Wherewith he should make our sacrefyse
Of hye dysdayne and malice they despise
For gold of truth is falsely now alayed
By feigned love and symylacion
And faith with frawde is corupt and frayed
With double tongues and detraccion
Our frank also of high perfeccion
That should brenne clear above the sky
Is with the coode medlid of envy
That it alas give may no light
In the center of true affeccion
For day of truth is turned in to night
Through false report / and false suspeccion
And thus good faith is rollyd up so down
And true menyng derkyd with a sky
That we in englissh callen flaterye
And t^us our offryng goes almost wrong
Of (...) of frank / for ought I can espy
And our myrre has be behind full long
Us to preserve from al such trecherye
For now is turned in to ypocresye
Our holiness and that is great ruthe
And cause why / for fraud has banysshed truth
But crist Ihesu that all this may amend
And that is a mysse in each state redress
This high feste such grace to us send
That we the gold of stablenesse
And eke the frank of parfyte holiness
May on this day present unto the
With all true heart as did these kings three
And grant also both to high and low
To have such myrre in her a^uertence
That every wight his own fawtes know
And that no man be hasty of sentence
To deem lightly before or in absence
For sodeyn dome meynte with ygnoraunce
Has a long tail showing of repentance
For in sothnesse if that every man
Would make a myrrour of his own mind
To deem him self of thing that he well can
And open his eyes that has be long blind
To see his fawtes that he could find
I trow in soth for any hasty rape
Harmeles fro dome his fellow should ascape
How we should do this offering ghoostly capitulo lxxvi
nOw crist Ihesu that know every heart
And no thing may be hyd fro thy presence
Ne from thyn eye declyne ne asterte
Grant us this day of thy magnyficence
The gold of love / the frank of Innocence
And the chaste myrre of clean entencion
So to present in our oblacion
To thyn hyghnes that it be acceptable
While that we live ever from year to year
As was the offryng in bethleme in a stable
Made unto the and to thy mother dear
Of the kings that with the stremes clear
Of a sterre conveyed were by grace
Where thou lay / to come to the place
And unto the this day we clepe and call
Thou blessed queen of kings emperesse
That yaue thy sone sowke in a stalle
That chaste milk of virgynall clennesse
That thou this feste o sterre of holiness
Conueye our offryng to that sterry see
Where next thy sone thou have the souerayn^^
And good lady in this sorrowful vale
Of trobyl and woo and of heaviness
Sithen thou of Jacob art the right scale
The way of life / the ladder of holiness
Toward that court the even weye dress
And make thy men thither to assende
Where ever bless and joy has none end
For certes lady in this life we lack
(...) sothfast joy all the suffysaunce
Save among we knele before the rack
W^^rwyth thy sone was sometime thy plesaunce
(...) us reioycyng as by remembrance
(...) by liknes to look on thyn image
An^ (...) thy sone with his fair vysage
But o alas there is but a liknesse
Of portrature that does great offense
For we may not have full the blessydnesse
O^ thy vysage / neither of thy presence
And so to us great harm does appearance
When that we see of our desire we fail
We may plain / but it may not avail
Yet day by day of true affeccion
We goone of new thy liknesse for to see
Where of one thing we have compassyon
To see the bestys that so humble be
To stand so nere between thy sone and the
The rude ass and the ox also
And than we say complaynyng in our woo
With all our heart o what thyng^ may this (...)
To see that lord in a rack ly^
That has the heaven in his po^ste
And all this world power has to gye
O how it is that the regallye
Of heaven and earth is brought down so low
That no man list uneath his power know
And suddenly our hertes gynnyth cold
For astonyng and is for woo nygh mate
So great a queen when that we behold
Allone sittyng al dysconsolate
So fair so good and of so high estate
Most womanly and so benygne of chere
Thy sone and the to gyder sittyng in fere
In the bonds of so narow a dongeon
Whereof al earth tremble shall and quake
And every wight by lamentacion
Weep and plain syghe and sorrow make
O blysful queen only for thy sake
To see on the none other waiting
But bestys with hey hem self fedynge
But in one thing comfort yet we feel
O good lady sothely if we see
Three worthy kings before thy face knele
Bryngen her yeftes with all humylite
And hem govern like to thy degree
With meke attendaunce and full besy cure
But all this thing we see but in picture
Alas the while and yet it does us ease
And in party aswagith our greuaunce
For no thing may our sorrow so appease
As ever of the to have a remembrance
For in the lady / is hoole our sustenaunce
Though we live in langour for thyn absence
Yet good lady for thy magnyficence
To thy servants of thy grace see
And to thy sone be for us a mean
This high feste which longs unto the
In wh^che thou were honourid like a queen
With myrre and frank and gold that shone so clean
Now for the honor this day was to the
And for the love of the kings three
When we shul part out of this wooful life
And make an end of this captyuyte
Or herodes thorugh his mortal stryf
The fend bytrappe us through his cruelte
Now that time lady of thy benygnyte
Against the snaris of this dredeful werre
To life et^^ne be thou our lood sterre
How our lady was purifyed capitulo lxxvij
Glory and price laud and high honor
O blessed queen be yeuen unto the
That were of gold the cloos chaste toure
Su^^^y founded upon humylite
Shet^^ with the keye of clean virgynyte
From al sin fully to be assurid
And of the holy ghoost round about enuyrid
That never no brennyng of flesshly hete
Assail might thyn holy tabernacle
With dew of grace thy closette was so sweet
Fulfilled with virtue only by miracle
God chase thy womb for his tabernacle
And hallowed it so clean in every coost
To make hit sacrarye for his owen ghoost
Notwithstondyng that thou were so clean
Above al other by eleccion
Of meekness only o thou heavenly queen
Thou list to have none Indygnacion
The day to pass of thy purificacion
But to fulfille the precepte of the law
In every thing and not a poynt^ withdraw
But even like as hit is specefyed
Leuitici who so can understand
To the temple to be purefyed
Thou mekely come thyn offryng in hand
Al be the law set on the no bond
For it is there made mention
Touching the law of purificacion
If a woman conceive by a man
And have a child by medlyng hem between
That it be a male the law techyth than
Forty days that she should be unclean
And keep her close that no man should her seen
And after that she should her offering
In law expressyd to the temple bring
But takes head in conclusion
How this law like as ye shul find
Ne was not put but by condycion
Only to them that corupt weren by kind
Thorugh touch of man / of such is made mind
The days nombred of her purgacion
To come and make her oblacion
And bring a lamb the which in sacrefyse
Should al be brought in the holy place
And a pygeon as law does deuyse
She should eke offer as for her trespace
And than al fylthe from her to enchace
She of the priest hallowed and sacrefyed
Returns home and fully purefyed
And if she had in her possessyon
Redely no lamb only for pouerte
Than should she take for her oblacion
Two turtyl dow^ys and therwithal goo free
Or two pygeons like as ye may see
Leuitici where as by dystynction
Of this offering is made dyscripcion
But this maid who so can take heed
Excluded was fro this condycion
That bare a child without mannys sede
Being ever clean from al corrupcion
Where thorugh she was from such oblacion
By law except / and was under no charge
For her clennesse stondyng at her large
For of her womb the cloister virgynal
Was ever eliche both first and last
Closed and shytte as castle pryncipal
For the holy ghoost devised hit and cast
And at both times shytte as like fast
In her chyldyng no more thorugh grace y broke
Than at her conceyuyng / than it was un look
For nature withouten any stryf
Repugnaunce or any resistance
^aue this maid prerogatyf
As mother to have experience
Only of chyldyng / and feel none offense
Nether of sekenes ne of such manner woo
In trauelyng as other women do
She was except from al such passion
For her clennesse / and so was none but she
And yet her time of purificacion
She did abide of her humylite
And like as law ordeyneth by decree
After all this of custom as she ought
To the temple she her offering brought
To give ensaumple only of meekness
To the law she mekely would obey
Fro point to point the gospel says express
And on no side would it not withsaye
And though that she bare of gold no keye
To bye a lamb for pouerte constreynyng
Yet she full mekely to make her offering
Brought two turtils as it is said aforne
That was the offering of pour folk echone
Which to the temple when that she has borne
As custom was she offerid hem anoon
And after that old symeon
With humble heart and a full pain
The child embracyng in his arms tweyne
How Symeon receyuyd crist of our lady in the temple capitulo lxxviij
Of his mother goodely began him take
Of loving heart and great devotion
And such a joy of him began to make
Within him self of high affeccion
That he ne could neither by word ne soun
Outward declare neither with chere ne face
The passing joy that began his heart enbrace
And he was rightful holy and virtuous
This old man this blessed symeon
Dredeful also and passyngly famous
Among the prestys to reken hem euerichone
That was expectant and full long agone
Of the comfort and consolacion
Of Israel in his entencion
For he had answer of the holy ghoost
In his prayere that he should see
The birth of christ that is of power most
And eke fro death that he shall goo free
To the time of his natyuyte
And to the day that with his eyes old
The birth of him that he may behold
The which day that with his eyes old
And for that he by reuelacion
The time knew he has the way hold
To the temple with high devotion
To see of crist the presentacion
How that marye and Joseph eke also
The child presented and her offering do
And for that crist was the first borne
After the law in his tendyr age
Not of leui as ye have herd toforne
But of Judah comen by lignage
Therefore his mother most holy of vysage
Her offering made list not for to strive
For him ageyn to pay shyllynges five
Like as the custom of the law was
She mekely made his redemption
And symeon beholding all this caas
Full stylly in his Inspeccion
For love brennyng / by affeccion
Of very heart suddenly abrayed
Holdyng the child even thus he said
How where and when symeon made Nunc dimittis seruum tuum dne^ secundum verbum
tuum in pace capitulo lxxix
o Blisful lord of thy high grace
If that thou list now thou may me let
Out of this life in rest and pees to pace
And suffer me to dye in quyete
For now to me death is wonder sweet
Now have I seen thy health and thy socour
And of mankind lord and sauyoure
Which thou have dyght before the faces all
Of each people to make hem glad and light
To late thy grace so to earth fall
Through all the world to show his bemys bright
That may be called for comfort of his light
Unto all the gentilys the reuelacion
The glory also and the sauacion
Of Israel thy people in specialle
To void hem out of al derknesse
And marie full mekely listenyth all
And began merueyle with great aduysidnesse
Of the words that he began express
And Joseph eke began to wonder also
And symeon hem blessyng both two
Spoke to marye and said in audyence
Behold and see in thyn Inspeccion
How he is put in ruin and offense
Of many one here in his regyon
And to sum in resurrexyon
That shall releue through his mighty grace
And through thy soul shall a sharp sword pace
Of hertely woo to see his passion
That passyngly shall be bitter and fell
To opene hertes by confession
Her sorrowful thoughts opynly to tell
And anna than daughter of phanuelle
Borne of the trybe of the kynrede
Called asser sothely as I read
Of the joy that anna the daughter of phanes had when crist was offryd in to
the temple capitulo lxxx
tHat was that day run (...) in age
Within the temple by contynuaunce
Soole by her sylf out of marriage
Lay night and day in fasting and penance
In wydow abyte sad of countenance
And in prayer was her besy cure
Which in that hour of grace or adventure
When crist was there with his mother dear
In the time of his oblacion
This anna came demure and sad of chere
And unto him with great devotion
When she him saw / fyl on knees down
Recomforted of al her old smerte
Him honoring with all her hoole heart
Said opynly that al might here
(...) merry and light in your entencion
And (...) man be glad and of good chere
For now is borne for our sauacion
(...) that shall make our redemption
(...) young child blessed mote he be
That me has granted his face for to see
And than in soth when every thing was done
After the law withouten excepcion
And than anna and holy symeon
Had of this child made declaracion
As ye have herd in conclusion
This child and Joseph and this maid free
Returned hoome again in to galyle
A profitable declaracion of the propy^tees of the Turtyl / and the douue
Capitulo lxxxvj
nOw as me semyth in this hye ferye
That named is the puryfycacion
Every man ought to be glad and merry
And with good heart / and hole entencyon
Deuoutely bring his oblacyon
And offer first the turtyl of Innocence
Of very mekenes and hertely pacyence
And who that would this offryng make aryght
He may not fail none of both two
First shine in clennesse with his chaste light
As the Turtyl / and therewith also
Lyche the douue both in well and woe
His heart daunte so by temporaunce
To void rancour / and plant in sufferaunce
And as the Turtyl by contemplacyon
For sin soroweth with great waymentyng
Only for love of thilke eternal dilectyon
That lasts ay / and has none endyng
And as the bird shewyth the coming
Of grene wherewith fresshe birds new
Right so of virtue with flowers fair of hew
He must exampel of the turtyl take
And be well ware that he not ne varye
But live sole when he has lost his make
And in prayer be also solytarye
And look alwey that he not ne tarry
On no careyne of no flesshelyhede
And with all this to take also head
That he his life ^ede not in vain
But like a down be^ely afpye
Where he of virtue gader may the grain
And that he fle not out of company
Waytyng also the galle of envy
And that he have ay Indygnacion
Of synful lust out of corrupcion
On any careyn to foster him and feed
And evermore with all his besy pain
Eschewyng sin love god and dread
And with the douue sygh and complain
For his offense / and with wings tweyne
Take his flight as ferforth as he can
Through parfyte love / both to god and man
And as the douue touches eke her make
(...) with kyssyng when they to geder gone
So must he whether he sleep or wake
Through chastyte set his heart in one
And like a douue makes his nest of stone
This is to seye among al his plesaunce
He must his flesh daunte with penance
And as the douue with her eyes meke
Of kind aspyeth amyd the Riuere
The ^^wbys shadow when he does her seek
Sechyng his repast both far and nere
Right so must he with parfyte eyes clear
Amyd the watres full of woo and stryf
In the wawes of his mortal life
The dedely shadow of the fend eschew
That wayteth him with snares large and huge
And to the death ay does him pursewe
To trappe him here in his deluge
And like a douue flee to his refuge
By grace only if he may escape
Or death bytraye him with his sodeyne trape
And who so by clennesse with the turtyl fleet^
As I tofore have made mention
And like a down before his perille flees
Of de^h to eschew the persecusion
And can be meke in tribulacion
I dar record it / write it for soth
Trewly to god he his offering does
And who that ever lives in chastyte
And has envy enclosid in his heart
He may well offer what so that he be
To god a turtyl / but the down naught
Wherefore they must be to gyder brought
That clennesse by sothfast unity
Without partyng be knytte with charity
And sothely than there is no more to seyne
When his offering and oblacion
Is Justly made to god of both tweyne
It is accepted of more devotion
And for to make a short dyscripcion
Of the turtyl and ^he downys kind
Redith these versis / and ye shul it find
Alta petit turtur cantando genut veniens (...)
Nunciat et cast viuit solus que mor^tur
Pullos nocte fouit mortecinium que fugit
Errana legate volicat sociata cadauera vitat
Fell caret plangit socium que per oscula tangit
Petra dat huic nidum fugit hos^^ flumi^^ visum
Rostro non ledit geminos pullos been nu^nt
This feste also both of more and less
Thorugh out the world / in every regyon
Called is the feste of candelinesse
For sundry skylles / in conclusion
As old books make mention
And how this feste first took his name
So as I can to you I will ataine
How candelmasse took first the name capituse lxxxij
Sometime when rome thorugh his hye renoun
Was most flowryng in power and in might
Every fyfthe year by reuolucion
In february upon the first night
Each man and child with a taper light
Went in the cite two and two a paas
Unto a temple which sacrid was
To (...) of old fandacion
That mother was to mars omnypotente
In whose honor this processyon
Ordained was by great auysemente
At each luster wenyng in her entente
That her power and great worthynesse
Preseruyd was through help of this goddess
From al asaute of every aduersayre
Supposyng fully in her opinion
That she fort^^e made debonayre
For to sustain the honor of her town
And thorugh her help and medytacion
That mighty mars to encrece her glory
In all conquest yaue to him glory
For which cause thorugh out the cite
As ye have h^^de of high and low estate
Was first ordained this solempnyte
In the temple that was consecrate
To februa the goddess fortunate
Through help of whom they were victorious
And so this custom superstitious
In Rome town as mine auctor seyth
Obseruyd was long / and many a day
Yet after that they turned to the feyth
But ever in one this ^yte they kept always
For old customme is hard to put away
And also usage greuyth folk full sore
To do away that they have kept yo^^
But at the last pope Sergius
Of the people seeing this error
And that the customme was full peryllous
Did his deuoyre / and also his labor
That ryte to change in to the honor
Of our lady / so that this hye feste
From the highest down to the loweste
Every man and woman in her hand
To the Temple should a tapre bring
Through out the world in every manner land
And there with all make her offryng
After the gospel the prestes hand kyssyng
With light solemn that al might it seen
In honor only of the heaven queen
That best may be our medyatryce
To her sone / that is without fail
Both lord and king and she Imperatryce
Of land and see of pees and of battle
Withouten whom no conquest may avail
For she has power more in sothfastnesse
Than Februa of Rome the goddess
And thus this ryte was utterly refusyd
By sergyus as ye have herd deuyse
That was aforne of hem of Rome vsyd
Full many a day in her paynym wise
Whom to sow al Christian must despise
And of candels when this rite began pass
Came the name first of Candelmasse
This feste also of full long agone
The name took of the processyon
Made of Anna and holy Symeon
When they him me^ with great devotion
Brought to the temple to this oblacion
As was the law customme and vsaunce
Of holy church for a remembrance
Obseruyd forth fro year to year
Of February on the first day
With sacrid light upon taperis clear
Shynyng as bright / as phoebus in may
When the people / in what they can or may
Full ready ben of one entencyon
To make in figure a presentacyon
Of Crist Ihesu with all her full might
Sygnefyed / who so can take heed
By the tapre / that we offer light
For first the wax bytokeneth his manhede
The weke his soul / the fire his godhede
For as the wex is made of new
Through small bees of flowers fresshe of hew
Through clennesse only and dylygent labor
On blosso^es gadred / and to hyue brought
So Crystes manhood grew out of a flower
Whoos fresshe beauty of color fades naught
For a maid clean in will and thought
Lyche as wexe of flower soote and glade
Is tried out / and does hem not to fade
So Crist Ihesu conseruyng her clennesse
His manhood took of a maid free
She standing hole flouryng in fayrenesse
With all the fresshenesse of vyrgynyte
And as a tapre is one to geder on three
So thylk lord / that is both three and one
Took flesh and blood to save us euerychone
Of a maid which this day fro (...)
Mekely went to be (...)
To the temple of Ierus^lem
As her to forne it is specyfyed
In whoos honor this feste is magnyfyed
Of al Christian men with fresshe tapres shene
To sygnefye / who so that will be clean
Must offer a tapre to geder made of three
Of feythe and work and true entencyon
For sothfastly / but they conjoined be
Without partyng or deuysyon
Another his offryng ne oblacyon
How fair outward pleynly that it seem
To god above it may never queme
And though this tapre brenne bright al day
And enuyron make his light to shede
If work of feyth prolonged be away
And true intent follow not the deed
Fare well his guerdon / his merit and his mede
For when these three be not knette in one
He nys not able to offryng for to gone
For if these three to geder be not meynt
Feyth / work / and hoole entencion
His offryng fares but as a tapre queynt
That yeueth no light / but bryghtynesse enuyron
For derke of deed from al devotion
His offryng is / but if this three
Be knette in one through perfyght unity
Now Christ / that art the sothfast holy light
The heart of man for to enlumyne
Upon us wretches / for thy / see so bright
Let the son of thy mercy shine
For love of her that is a pure vyrgyne
Which on this day to the temple went
Of mekenes only the for to present
(...) whoos prayer lord of thy might
Grant us grace / when we be old
And shall deye to hold our ^^pres (...)
