(...) Cupids wrongs vindicated:
Wherein he that Cupids wiles did discover,
Is proved a false dissembling Lover.
The Maid shows such cause that none can her condemn,
But on the contrary the fault's laid on him.
To the tune of Cupids cruel torments
THe guilefull Crocodile
when he his prey would gain,
That none may spy his wile,
A mournful noise does feign:
So thou false Hypocrite
Thy foul deceit to cover,
Do act the part aright
of a distracted Lover.
But rail no more on Love,
Nor do young Cupid wrong,
For thou did never prove
What does to love belong.
Hienna, like thou feign'st
words of a dying man,
But falsely thou complain'st
with woe I prove it can:
For like a cheating wretch,
thou do on me exclaim,
But this is but a fetch.
for thou deseru'st the blame.
Why do thou rail on love,
Or do, etc.
Thou know I loved thee well,
and purposd thee to have,
Thy conscience this can tell,
thou false dissembling knave,
But when I did perceive
thy fickle wavering mind,
It Was time to take my leave,
and serve thee in thy kind.
Then rail no more on love,
Nor Cupids cruel wrong,
For thou did never prove
What does to love belong.
Let any one that will
be judge twixt thee and me,
Why should I love thee still,
when thou love two or three.
Do think I Will stand at stake,
to help at the last cast?
When all do thee forsake,
then I must serve at last.
O rail no more on love,
Nor Cupids cruel wrong,
For thou did never prove
What does to love belong.
Thou come to me ith morn,
and go to Madge at night,
Thy mind will quickly turn
to which comes next in sight.
Thou Wilt promise and protest
thou will have none but me,
But when thou see the rest
those vows forgotten be.
Then rail no more on love,
Nor Cupids, etc.
Do think I cannot hear
how thou playst fast and loose,
Long Mall gave thee good cheer.
both Cony Hen and Goose:
Alas man I have friends
that note thy actions well,
Thou love for thine own ends,
but I thy knavery smell.
Then rail no more on love,
Nor Cupids cruel wrong,
For thou did never prove
What does to love belong.
The second part, To the same Tune.
I Saw last Thurseday night,
when thou wentst to the Swan,
With Kate and Winifrite,
and after you came Nan,
I know what wine you had,
and also what was paid,
Alas poor harmless lad,
will thou dye for a Maid!
Fie rail no more on love,
Nor Cupids cruel wrong,
For thou did never prove
What does to love belong.
I Cannot choose but smile
to think how cunningly
Thou would the world beguile
with foul hypocrisy:
For I the wrong sustain,
and thou from grief art free,
Yet still thou do complain
that I am false to thee.
Fie never rail on love,
Nor Cupids cruel wrong,
For thou did never prove
What does to love belong.
To either man or Maid
For censure I Will appeal,
Which of us may be said
disloyally to deal;
Did ever I seem nice
till I was told for truth,
More often then once or twice,
thou was it a faithless youth.
Fie do not rail, etc.
Thou make the world believe
thou for my love do pine,
Indeed thou sore do grieve
with wenches, Cakes, and wine,
For my part it is my lot
to pray for patience still,
Until I have forgot
thy ouer-reaching skill.
Then do not rail, etc.
Yet though I suffer wrong
I needs must praise thy art,
Sure thou have studied long
to act the Mad-mans part,
Thou can not sleep nor wake
for fancies in thy head,
Now I do thee forsake
I muse thou art not dead.
Fie do not rail, etc.
That Less which shall have thee
Who ere has that ill hap,
Let her learn this of me,
she is caught in follies trap.
He that dissemble can
with one in such a way.
He Will nere prove honest man,
believe me what I say.
Then do not rail on love,
Nor Cupids cruel wrong,
For thou did never prove
What does to love belong.
FINIS.
