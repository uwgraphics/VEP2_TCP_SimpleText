The Preface.
THe Queens majesty of her godly zeal calling to remembrance how necessary
it is to the auauncement of gods glory, and to the establishment of Christ's
pure Religion, for all her loving subieectes, especially the state
Ecclesiastical, to be knitte together in one perfect unity of doctrine, and
to be conjoined in one uniformity of Rites and Manners in the ministration of
Gods holy word, in open prayer and ministratio^ of Sacraments, as also to be
of one decent behauioure in their outward apparel, to be known partly by
their distinct habits to be of that vocation (who should be reverenced the
rather in their offices as Ministers of the holy things whereto they be
called) has by her letters directed unto the Archebyshop of Canterbury and
Metropolitan, required, enjoined and straightly charged, that with assistance
and conference had with other bishops, namely such as be in commission for
causes ecclesiastical, some orders might be taken, whereby all diversities
and varieties among them of the clergy and the people (as breedinge nothing
but contention, offense and breach of common charity, and be against the
laws, good vsuage and ordinances of the Realm) might be reformed and
repressed, and brought to one manner of uniformity throughout the whole Realm,
that the people may thereby quietly honor and serve almighty God in truth,
concord, unity, peace and quietness, as by her majesty's said letters more at
large does appear. Wheruppon by diligent conference and communication in the
same, and at last by assent and consent of the persons before said, these
orders and rules ensuing, have been thought meet and convenient to be used
and followed: not yet prescribinge these rules as laws equivalent with the
eternal word of God, and as of necessity to bind the consciences of her
subjects in the nature of them considered in them selves: Or as they should
add any efficacye, or more holiness to the virtue of public prayer and to the
Sacraments, but as temporal orders mere Ecclesiastical, without any vain
superstition, and as rules in some part of discipline concernig decency,
distinction, and order for the time.

Articles for doctrine and preachinge.
First, that all they which shall be admitted to preach, shall be diligently
examined for their conformity in unity of doctrine, established by public
authority: and admonished to use sobriety and discretion in teachinge the

utter them to the edification of the Audience.

words spoken.

Item, that they use not to exact or receive unreasonable rewards or stipendes
