THE HOSPITAL OF INCVRABLE FOOLS: Erected in English, as near the first
Italian model and platform, as the unskillful hand of an ignorant Architect
could devise.

Ipazzi, e li prudenti, fanno giustissima bilancia.

Printed by Edm. Bollifant, for Edward Blount. 1600

TO MY MOST NEAR and Capriccious Neighbor, ycleped John Hodgson, alias John
Hatter, or (as some will) John of Paul's Churchyard, (Cum multis alijs, quae
nunc imprimere longum est:) Edward Blount; wishes prosperous success in his
Monomachie, with the French and Spaniard.
John of all John's, I am bold here to bring you into a guest-house or
Hospital, and to leave you there; not as a Patient, but as a Patron or
Treasurer: I could wish, that upon this sudden calling to such an office, you
would not (like one swollen with the fatness of your place) grow bigger or
prouder, nor (indeed) more covetous then you are: but like a man within
compass, whose bare (or rather threadbare) content is his kingdom, tread all
Ambition under your Ancient shoe soales, now the sixteenth time corrected, Et
ab omnibus mendis purgatas. Stay now; for your charge: you shall swear to the
uttermost of your endeavors, without fraud or imposture to relieve and cherish
all such creatures as are by the hand of Fortune committed to your custody, as
also to elect and choose officers of good reputation and sincere practice to
supply inferior places under you as: a Porter, who shall refuse none that are
willing to enter; a surgeon, that will protract the cure long enough upon them,
and that if any desperate Censurer shall stab either at you or me, for
undertaking, or assigning this office or place, you presently take him into the
dark ward, and there let him be looked to, and kept close as a concealment,
till some body beg him; all this you shall faithfully protest to accomplish:
So help you a fat Capon, and the Contents of this Book.

TO THE GOOD OLD Gentlewoman, and her special Benefactresse, Madam Fortune,
Dame Folly (Matron of the Hospital) makes courtesy, and speaks as follows.
IN good truth (Madame) I am at my wits end (ere I begin) to think, what
Error, or Fury it is that has so successively possessed the poor despised
Nation of Poets (these many thousand years) still to defame, and traduce your
Ladyshyp with the imputative slanders of Niggardise and instability; when I
(which have known you better and more inwardly, then a thousand of these
Candle-wasting-Booke Worms) can affirm you to be the most bounteous,
open-handed, firm, vnswayed, constant Lady under Heaven. But since it is no
other then the breath of such a pitiful family; let it vanish (as one of my
own Mottley household notes well) like Tobacco smoke. And now (most excellent
Patroness) that you may feel (for I know you do not use to see) the desire I
have to be truly grateful for so many Mountains of Benefits clapped upon me
(since I first taught Adam to make him a suite of fig leaves) I do here
present your La. with the translated Species of an Hospital, and some few
Bedred fools, lately multiplied out of Italian into English, with a most
prosperous and chymicall success. My hopes are that you (out of your gracious
and accustomed blindness) will not so much, as deigne to look upon their
diseases, but pass them over with the hand of Favor, as you have often done
other sick creatures of their sanguine complexion. They lack cherishing, good
Lady, let them not want it. I know a good plump Fool comes as welcome to you
at all times, as the wisest Anatomy in a kingdom; you take no pleasure in one
of these lean withered Cato's: and it is much more in the way of your praise,
that you should bestow your favors on such as (with adoration) will wear them
on their foreheads, then on those, who (out of their too much knowledge) study
to conceal and make them appear cheap and contemptible. Well Madame, you
have the happiness both to consider and distinguish these things without me;
and yet if the old Dutchman (he of Roterodam) were to be brought to the rack
now, he would protest me (though I doubt he were scarce a sound Protestant) to
have too mean faculty in counsel; there was a true trick of my self now (if
you mark it) Folly must have a flurt of lightness and ostentation ever. I
fear nothing more, but that I have been too grave all this while, and
appeer'd like one dancing in a gown: If I have, pardon me; I beg it with as
forced a look, as a Player that in speaking an Epilogue makes love to the two
pennie-roume for a plaudite. But leaving this, what say you? Are my children of
the Spittle to be received into your good thoughts, or no? they stay on the
oher side of the leaf waiting your pleasure. Me thinks being Fools, they
should be answered according to their folly, which is with silence, which is
with consent.

Prologue of the Author to the beholders.
THe manifest vanity, evident folly, and express madness of some miserable and
unhappy men, who with a mind puffed up with pride, a noddle lighter than an
oak apple, and more void of wit, than cockles of meat in the waine of the
moon, presume notwithstanding extremely upon themselves, in that they are of
this friendly and pleasant sort of Buffones; (for according to the saying of
the Philosopher, where little wit is, thither do men run with greatest
favor and liking) being lifted up to such an height, that like to that
memorable gourd in Ariosto, in short space of time they must needs fall: is the
principallest cause that I being amazed and astonished at this their so great
folly, after my Theater of sundry humors and inclinations, have taken upon me
to build this most famous Hospital, where the renowned folly of these men may
be seen and discerned, written (as it were) in Text letters, and in chambers
or lodgings apart, painted and set forth by me with so beautiful and
workmanlike prospectiue, that other Fools shall flock about them; and as the
Kings of Fools, they shall receive an open-mouthed applause of them all, to
the end, that while the pipkin boyleth, the smoke that pleases themselves so
much, may forcibly come steaming out at the crown of their own hats. Yet is
this no reason, but that the general Folly of the world, spurreth me forward
to do the same, besides the kinds of particular Follies, the which procure me
that (all human kind participating of the same) I build for each one of them
distinct Cells, wherein they may all commodiously, and with great ease repose
themselves. And in this point, it will appear how godly a man the Author of
this frame was; who besides the building, made at the great instance of so many
weak and poor in brain, with excellent invention has devised to recommend
them all to some God; under whose protection they might be kept, or as far as
is possible, defended, and helped of their folly. So he will specially beseech
Minerua, to take care of frantic and delirant Fools; Jupiter Hospitalis, of
melancholic and savage; Apollo, of idle and careless; God Abstemius, of those
drunken; Cameronte, of forgetful and fickle headed; God Sentinus, of stupide,
lost, and half dead Fools; the Egyptian Ox of those notted, gross, and
loblolly-lams; the Samian sheep, of shallow-pates and ninnie hammers; the
Goddess Bubona, of lumpish and loggerheaded; the God Fatuellus, of plain
Fools and naturals; the Goddess Themis, of those vicious; Nemesis, of the
malicious and despitefull; God Risus, of the ridiculous; Juno, of the
vainglorious; Mercury, of dissembling and counterfeit; Hecate, of lunaticall
or Fools by season; Cupid, of loving Fools; Goddess Venilia, of desperate;
Vulcanus, of heteroclite, light-brained, and addle-headed; Fabulanus, of
scoffing Fools; Bacchus, of those pleasant, sweet, sociable, and loving;
Tesiphon, of those angry and froward; Mars, of the furious, brutish, or
bedlemsort; Hercules, of extrauagant, extreme, and wilful Fools;
Rhadamanthus, of the pild-pated; Volutina, of monstrous and three-elbowed
Fools; Hippona, of them untamed like an horse; Inexorable Minos, of them
obstinate like a mule; and finally, infernal Pluto, of mischievous or
diabolical Fools. In the mean while I conjure the household Gods, that they
will have a care of this family of general Fools; and the Gods Tutelar, that
they will undertake the tuition and protection of this new Hospital. Goddess
Ops, that with convenient remedies, she will succor so many infirm, and
naked of wit and understanding; Goddess Medetrina, that she will cure them
well; God Aesculapius, that with miraculous Hellebore, he will purge them after
some sort; Goddess Sospita, that she will heal them out of hand; God Ianus,
that he will permit every one to enter within the gates of this Hospital,
that they may behold the misery of these unhappy and unfortunate: and that
especially which is performed on the festival day of all Fools, as the
Romans were accustomed, the Author desires, that the gates may be set broad
open, where they may see the Bacchanals of the Menades, a matter pleasant above
all Or Bacchus Nuns.
others, and rare to behold. With this invention therefore it has pleased him
to rebate the edge, and rashness of those modern Thersites, who think
themselves Aiaces; of those Pigmeis that esteem themselves Alcides; of those
peevish Fools that judge themselves Nestors; of those field-Crickets that play
the parrats so notably; of those pearched Cuckoes that laugh at all the world;
of those skinlesse Snailes that lift up their horns for nothing; of those
Horse-flies of Pigneta, that are bread in dung and dirt; of those Lobbellinoes,
properly leaden-heeled, but lightheaded as a straw: for passing through this
Hospital, they shall see that Folly was their mother, Buffonerie their sister,
Ninnerie their companion for term of life, and that between them and Folly
there is a just Logical equipollence, Physical reference, and a Scotisticall
Identitie. These be those that first put it into the Authors head to frame this
new building, where the honorable beholders shall have great solace and
pastime, to see the foolish Prosopopaeia of these savage geese, and will take
no small delight and pleasure at the strange and unusual follies, which within
shall discover themselves in these men, who counterfeiting other Catoes among
the multitude, will in the end appear to be nothing, but kings of Crickets,

loosed, and fix your eyes steedfastly upon him, if you will wonder at the
first sight.

Not to the wise Reader.
IT being but a Poetical fiction, that this whole world was in the beginning
framed of Chaos, upon better advise and reason one may change opinion, or at
least have his own censure by himself: it seeming unto me a more probable
thing, that from the beginning of Form, which the philosophers hold to be
perfection, this world grows daily to Chaos and confusion. But if the
material frame be any ways answerable to him, who is the epitomethereof (man
being termed Microcosmos) I am sure this assertion may well be maintained. For
Nature (divine ministresse) contending in the creation of all things, to
imprint in them the seal and form of Divinity, she finds no enemy nor
obstacle to this her perfect work but matter, which still increases according
to the augmentation, and growth of things created. Hereupon comes the great
difference between the superior immortal, and the inferior corruptible
parts of man, the faculties of the soul and mind, being choked in all her
divine intentions, by the gross humors and temperature of the body, wherein
as in a dark and loathsome prison, it is while the gayle delivery of death
enclosed. And from hence in like manner does it arise, that this witty, and
worthy Author, observes in the tree of human conceit and understanding, so
many grafts of folly and fopperie inserted, as that no man how mighty or
profound soever he be in his own sight, is exempted from some measure or
proportion of these dottrell drammes. In religion (which is the highest action
amongst men) is it not a wonderful thing to see the obstinate opposition of
some more fantastic, then truly zealous: one judging every decent
formalitie, deep and dangerous superstition; another abandoning all true
ground and substance, for naked traditionall rite and form. Next unto this in
the second cure of our bodies, how infinite are the follies of Physicians in
the practice of their Art, into whose hands notwithstanding at one time or
other are committed the lives of almen, wading through such a number of
incertainties before they attain to one sound probatum, and making their
trials and experiments upon the poor carcases of men: and yet for all this,
look what through an whole age, has been received for wholesome and healthful
administration, in another succeeding, is rejected as most prejudicial and
pernicious. So that the applications and medicine of their first founders, is
now of no worth, except they have recourse to minerals, wherein likewise as
they confess themselves they have attained to quality; but of quantity are
as yet altogether ignorant. The like may be said of all Arts and professions
amongst men, wherein there is that confusion and incertaintie, as the doings of
one are reprehended by another for most vain and foolish. But if you enter
into the particular humors and enclinations of each one, Lord, what a
pell-mell of conceit and muention you shall discover, this seed being so thick
sown in all their operations, that after their deep consultations, firm
resolutions, and provident circumspection, of all this their labor, there
comes up nothing but tares and folly, which the wisest man, after due
consideration so often affirmed. One is ambitious, and having brought his
thoughts and imaginations to a good pass, some instant folly, they being
reared to a great height, (like the Babilonian tower) utterly overthrows them
to the ground. Another puts on the Fox with temporizing humility, and yet
omitting some small circumstances in his complots and contriuance, a momentarie
error confounds all his labored and provident devises. For as violence
setleth hatred and disdain in the hearts of men, Nam oderint quem metuunt: so
absolute humility breeds contempt; and the Italian Prouer be can tell you,
that Chi pecora si fa, il lupo lo mangia. Well, having in this Hospital
received so good comfort, and succor my self; in religious charity I could
not but make known unto you this worthy Italian work, framed peradventure
upon their year of Iubilee, or grace, and therefore propounded in general to
all men, for relief and cure of their giddie maladies. I crave no pardon of my
errors or faults (yet are they many, and only mine own) being but a Fool,
in reporting to Fools what an other has censured of human folly: And
therefore you see I neither incite you to gratitude, by Alexanders receiving a
cup of water so thankfully, nor to reward in distributing of your goodwils, by
imitation of that noble Prince, who so kindly remunerated the taking of alowse
from his garment. Tullies sentences lie dead in my mind, and I have utterly
lost the memorial of Lycosthenes Apophthegmes: this I did carelessly, accept
you of it as lightly. Yet consider what patience you have with the wine you
drink in Tauernes, and believe me (as a poor Traveler) it is all exceedingly
bastardiz'd from his original purity: and even your Physical drams, that are
so greedily sought after, suffer a little sophistication by the hands of the
Apothecarie. Think not much therefore, if so tickle and foolish a commodity
as this is, be somewhat endamaged by the transportation of it out of Italy, but
making some pleasant and profitable collection out of the same, let us leave
all preeminence of folly to themselves, as I ascribe all due reward and
demerite to my original Author. It is certain, that there is few names of men
or places, in all the modern examples of this Book, but have agnomination or
proximitie with the humors and qualities of the party described: but this
would have made too homely an hotchpotch in English, and obscured so much wit
as shines through this whole miste of folly, by too palpable and triuiall
scurrilitie. If any man find help, or cure of his malady, by devout
invocation on his proper Saint, or Patron, let him ascribe the principal
glory thereof to him, and yet be thankful to his earthly founder.

Il pazzissimo.

Of Folly in general: the first discourse.
COnsidering, I have taken upon my self this burden, to manifest to the
world, the prodigious and monstrous kinds of folly, which with an aspect, and
countenance more deformed then Cadmus his serpent, more ugly then the Chimera,
fuller of poison then the dragon of Hesperides, more hurtful and prejudicial
then Corebus his monster, more terrible then the Minotaure of Theseus, of more
horrible presence then Geryon with his three heads, is come down into the
world, to power out amongst us the contagion of her poison, like the beast
Alcida, to the hurt and dommage of every one: it is very requisite, that I
describe her after such a manner, as that her very countenance only may be of
force to daunt and terrify any one, and that the whole world may be ready to
verify that the Harpies were not so foul, and unclean, Hercules his bull so
pestiferous, nor the sea monster Hesion so dommageable as she; who entering once
into the seat of the brain, she obfuscateth imagination, peruerteth conceit,
alienateth the mind, corrupts reason, and so disturbeth and hinders a man,
that he can neither read, deliver, nor act any thing as he should do: but on
the contrary, with turbulent conceptions, wavering and inconstant motions,
broken sleep, a sick brain, and an empty soacked head, like a withered
cucumber, he vainly like a blind mill horse, whirleth about a thousand
fopperies, some of them no less lamentable then ridiculous: But the greatest
inconvenience that springs from her is this, that continually weakening the
brain, she causes man to remain so blockish, and insensate, that he thinks
himself wisest, when he is most fool; then deeming, that he is an other
Mercury, when he is but a Corydon, or some Menalca, among the vulgar: and this
comes to pass (as Hippocrates in his Aphorisms auerreth) because;
Hippocrates.
Quibus it a men's aegrotat ij dolorem non sentiunt: they whose minds be thus
tossed and transported are insensible of grief. Folly therefore is she, who
being spread and dispersed, over all provinces and countries in the world;
sorely vexes mortallmen, and holds in subjection under her tyrannical
empire, an infinite number of people and men, that saying in Ecclesiastes being
too true, that Stultorum infinitus est numerus: infinite is the number of
fools; and even as Arpiages not impiously only, but further unnaturally and
villanously did with his own sons brains, so sets she her monstrous
teeth against one and other, coveting to satisfy the greedy humors of
human fantasy. This pretty peate, spares not kings, has no respect to
emperors, esteems not captains, makes no reckoning of the learned,
regards not the rich, fears not those noble, there is no consideration can
bridle, or make her refrain from striking, (like a blind man) round about,
and at randone, on every side, whole mortal race. Behold the hand that this
beast aunciently bore over the world, so that the people Agathyrses inhabiting
near the Syrtes, or sandy deserts, the first among fools, in sign of their
evident folly, went naked with their bodies painted of sundry colors, like
the Leopards spots: whereupon Virgil in the fourth of his Aeneades says: The
Cretanes, Drypes, and painted Agathyrsians rage.
The Audabatians being the pictures of true folly, were wont to fight in the
wars with their eyes closed: The Arcadians (right Fools) thought themselves
more ancient then the moon: and for this cause Seneca in his Hippolytus says:
Contemning thee, that did amidst the stars soshine:
A planet placed there: since the old Arcadians time:
The Himantopoles void of wit, went creeping upon the earth with their hands
and feet, as serpents do. The Mendesians deprived of all judgment, performed
the greatest honors they could possibly devise to goateheards. The people
Psylli cockscombes in the fourth degree, as Herodotus reports, fought with
armed ba^ds against the south wind, being prejudicial to them: The Tonemphians
half out of their wits, seriously made choice of adogge insteade of a king,
and by the motions and waggings of his tail, they presaged empires and
dominions, which they were to possess. But who does not perceive what folly
reigns amongst men, when the learned, who should be wiser then others,
show themselves otherwhiles more foolish, affirming things which babies would
scarce believe, and all the Magpies in a country would hardly vouchsafe to
chatter such foppish flimflams as they do: Is not that of Plinies a goodly
gullerie, that Phileta Coo, a compounder of Elegies, was of so light and
subtle a body, Pliny.
as that it was requisite to fasten lead to the soles of his feet, to the end
a blast of wind might not carry him quite away? Are not also those other two
famous, which Ausonius and Pontanus write of; that Seneus and Ausonius.
Pontanus.
Tyresias, of men, became women, changing their forms even as a Potter, while
the earth is moist, and supple, of a pot, can make a platter. But yet that
other of Plinies is no less witty: that in the lake of Tarquinum, there were
in times past two groves or woods which were carried round about, sometimes in
form triangular, then fowresquare, and otherwhiles all round: Neither smells
this current, that the herb called Achimenes, being thrown amongst the
enemies squadrons, is of virtue to make them turn their backs in spite of
their teeth. Licinius Mutianus, tells no simple lie, when he reports, Licinius
Mutianus.
that in Argos he saw a certain woman called Arestusa, who married her-selfe
to a man, and the day of her marriage became male, sprowting forth a bearde,
with members genitall: And afterward she also took a wife, being thus (as
he says) for ever converted into a man. As in like manner that other
delivered by Celius, is not very pleasant at the nose Celio.
end, that a certain sea monster, in his former parts like a man, and behind
resembling a horse, died thrice, and was woonderfully in like manner three
times raised from death: Furthermore that of Aelianus is no less famous then
the rest, when he mentions that Ptolomaeus Philadelphus had an Heart,
instructed after such a manner, as that he plainly understood his master, when
he spoke to him in Greek: No less fantastical AElianus.
is an other of Plinies also, reporting, that in Limira a fountain of Lycia
consecrated to Apollo, the fishes therein being with an oten, or bagpipe called
thrice above water, they obey the sound thereof, and appear without delay. But
Peter Messia, as others give out, Pietro Messia.
recounteth one most palpable, and void of sense, saying, that one Cipus, who
was a king, having diligently observed the fighting of two Bulls, and one day
with deep impressio^ thereof, laying himself down to sleep, awaking, he found
suddenly sprouted out of his head, the horns of a Bull. This man, it may be,
was a follower of the Philosopher Protagoras his sect, who like a foolish dolt,
was so impudent, as to affirm, that whatsoever seems unto a man, to be in
conceit, is so indeed: so that Plato bestowed a little pains in condemning
this Sot, to a thousand gallows, saying, if this position were true, then he
was of opinion that Protagoras likewise had uttered a notable foolerie, this
man affirming, that by his own reason it followed, that he was therefore
himself a fool. But he that would amply discourse of all the foolish toys,
that by learned men have been set abroach, and make mention of all those,
which worldly men have practiced, should undertake a burden able to weary
Atlas himself; much more, the feeble wit, and weak memory of a mean writer,
as I am: It suffices that with the wise man, every one may justly exclayme,
Vidi cuncta, quae fiunt sub sole, and ecce vniuersavanitas, and Solomon.
afflictio spiritus: I have perused all things done under the sun, and behold
all is vanity, and affliction of mind. The Egyptians in truth, were most
foolish, and vain in worshipping Onions, Leekes, and heads of Garlic for
their gods, as Iuuenal testifies in his fifteenth Satyr: The Babylonians also
wanted wit, when Iuuenall.
they worshipped their god Bell, before whom they set, so much meat to eat,
as would well have served, a thousand persons: And the Romans might well be
numbered amongst those three elbowed Fools, in offering divine sacrifice to
such an harlot, as was Flora, and adoring Stercutio for a god, no less
unworthily, then shamfully constituting him a patron, and Protector of Ajax,
and his commodities: But what do I reciting of ancient follies, when this our
present age, is a true and lively representation of Fools, yea, and the very
storehouse of all the vanities, a man can commit in this world? When were the
dreams of Alchymistes ever in greater estimation, then they are now, when many
great personages will vouchsafe to go ever into the Stoue, or forge, blowing
the bellows at the furnace mouth that they may become one of Geber or Morieno
his sect, every one of them having as much wit, as an horse: When was Raymonds
fond calbalistrie ever more sought after, who with his frivolous art professes
wonders, and that he can make Asses dance after the Morisco, and those to
run most swiftly, that have leaden heels by nature? When were there such a
number of these Almanakes or lying weather Authors being to be sold in the
Burse, or Rialto, even to the ridiculous prognostication of one that supped up
an hundred eggs in a morning, that he might not be driven to take Inn, with
this charitable Hospital of Fools; yet could not this silly wretch avoid the
malignant influence of the stars, and planets, and his own unfortunate
constellation, for he is forced to enter into the Hospital of incurable
Cockscombs, for a farthing Astrologer, because much after this rate, is his
hamper merchandise sold at. When walked there about the world such a number of
Pedlers and Quacksaluers, professing some of them physic as if they had the
university certificate, when in the end they prove but country iugglers,
selling dross for drugs, and hose of the Irish glick, for sloppes of the
mariners cut? who ever knew such abundance of them that hunt after strange
secrets, insomuch that in Bergamo there starts me up one that vaunted of a
secret he had, which would convert the Turk, and would have sold it to a
Physician, and a friend of mine, for a Or Friar Bacon of etc.
piece of forty if he so pleased, a matter enough (if he should have known
so much) to have made Fiorauanti of Bologna to despair in himself, for not
placing it amongst his medicinal toies, under title of Angelical and divine
Elixir Fiorauantyne: Who ever saw so many od Mechanics, as are at this day,
who not with a geometrical spirit like Archimedes, but even with art,
surpassing the profoundest Cabalistes, who in stead of a pigeon loft, place in
the garrets of houses, portable, and commodious Aiaxes, in stead of convenient
fish ponds, digging fit ditches for snakes and adders Or close stools.
? To conclude, all the world is matter from head to foot, and one beats his
brains about one thing, another, about some other: this man feeds himself in
worldly glory, thinking that in honor, he is a very Arc Triumphall, when
all the worth in him, scarcely amounts to an half penie value; another
ruffleth in his without-booke-Rhetoricke, as though he had no paragon for
Latin and Greek; one in deep wisdom of the world tags the points of his
hose with iron, that he may have ready crowns in his chest at command, for
in twenty years past, he gathers little or nothing; another stands upon
puntoes with his drawn sword, like another Gargantua, in that he is exalted to
some catchpoale or hangmans office, as if every one knew not, that to put an
office into a Fools hand, is as much as we should set an ass to play on the
harp: this man is very ginger, and dangerous of himself, upon his train, of
three or four raggie heeld followers, seeming some pompeous proud Pharoe of
parasites, amiddest a multitude of Ginnie Monkies: who makes himself doctor
doddipowle for wisdom, and a pedanticall quaint quanquam for epistles,
desiring to appear like an half blown glass, as if the play were ended
without a plaudite. And thus every one sets both good and bad upon the board,
not considering what the wise man says, that Vanitas vanitatum, and omnia
vanitas: Vanity of vanities, and all is vanity: But because we shall the
better know in general, if we discourse in particular, by little and little,
let us examine Fools in special, for thus shall we attain to the full and
perfect knowledge of Folly, we seek after.

Of Frantic and doting Fools: the second discourse.
THe general opinion of all learned Galen.
Physicians, and especially of Galen in the first of his Prorrheticks touching
this matter called Frenzy is this: that Frenzy properly is termed an
affection or interior passion, which being accompanied with a violentague, or
sharp fit, bears always about with it, madness in the brain of the patient:
And this passion (as Aetius writes by authority of Possedonius) Aetius.
is a certain inflammation of the organicall parts of the brain, which
induces a kind of dotage, and grievous percussion of the mind, whereupon they
are said to be frantic and doting, whom such a strong and displeasing
passion surpriseth. But Trallianus, that excellent Trallianus.
physician in the thirteenth chapter of his first book is of opinion, that
Frenzy is a tumor or inflammation of the brain, or of the membranes thereof:
And Paulus Paulus. Medicus.
Medicus in the sixth chapter of his third Book produces his opinion of the
same after this manner; that Frenzy is an inflammation of the membranes of the
brain; yet so, that sometimes the brain it self, seems together with them
co-inflamed, and that in it may be perceived otherwhiles, a certain heat,
besides that which we call vigor, or heat natural. Galen afterward in the
second of the causes of Symptoms, plainly maintains, that the reside^ce of
passion, is as well in the brain it self, as in the membranes: and the greater
part of Physicians iumpe with him, but especially amongst those of late days
Altomar in the sixth chapter of his medicinal Altomar.
method. Yet the Physicians do make some difference, between Frenzy, and
weakness of brain, although both of them are associated with an fever, or fit,
because dotage or braine-sicknes (as John Fernelius Ambianus in the fifth Book
of his works medicinal writes) is procured sometimes by choler, and
otherwhiles, by a subtle effused blood through the brain, or some other
cause: but Frenzy has ever his cause, from that inflammation of the brain,
which before we mentioned: and besides deliration is oftentimes a Symptom, or
after passion of an fever, or of some more grievous malady, but of a Frenzy
there is no Symptom, it effecting and causing a fit or fever; and this dotage
happens often, whereas Frenzy falls out but seldom; Frenzy being a far
more violent infirmity, then deliration or dotage. But because I mean not to
entreat of Folly, so much according to Physicians, as the vulgar opinion, I
have for this cause, comprehended, Frantic and brain-sicke Fools under one
kind, because we commonly say, when any one goes about a thing arsie-versie,
that such a man doteth, or is Frantic, the same happening to him, which
sorteth them, who are properly oppressed with Frenzy or madness: Amongst us
therefore ordinarily, Frantic, and deliring Fools be those, who with a kind
of imitation of their own folly and Frenzy, swerve from al sense, in anything
they utter, being inconstant, and so intricating themselves, that another
Sphinx, should have work enough to explane their conceits, and Oedipus himself
would sweat, to apprehend the meaning of their words: for there utterance is
ready, and at hand, but then fantasy on the other side in the^, is mounted on
a winged Pegasus rouing here and there at random. Of this kind of Fools, two
examples only may serve for the learned, the one of a certain man, named by
Seneca in his Epistles, Sparsus, to whom he ascribes Seneca cites an example
of a fool doting or delirant.
these qualities: that amongst scholars, he talked like a mad man; and amongst
mad men he discoursed like a scholar: where, in the one, and other, the dotage
of his mind was evident to all men: the other is of Caelius (an Caelio cites
another.
Author much esteemed) in the ninth Book of his ancient lectures, recited
where he says, that there was a certain decrepit woman, called by him, Acco,
(and so much the rather it might be a dotage, because the same is more proper
to this, then any other age) who perceiving her face in a glass deformed
through old age, of the coffeehouse she received by this in her mind, she
became a Fool; and in this her mad folly, she spoke to her own face in the
glass, laughed, and talked to it: sometimes she would threaten, otherwhiles
she would promise it somewhat; sometimes she flattered it, and anon after a
frantic manner she would be angry with the same; one while she would
be as merry, as maid Marrian, and by and by, outrageous and despightfull
like an oysterwife. But Modern examples.
amongst the vulgar, the example of one Talpine of Bergamo, an old Dizzard may
well be added, who not being able to continue a quarter of an hour, or one
minute in a purpose, departing from Bergamo, and going to Venice, before the
Signiorie or Magistracy of Quarantia Orsortie.
to appeal unto them, about sentence given upon an house, whereunto he
pretended title, as he stood before them, he leaped suddenly out of the house
into a well, maintaining with so great obstinacy, how at least yet he would
seize upon the well of that house, that those signiors, smiling, offered to
make him also Lord, and put him in possession of the whole sea, much more of a
well: and thus he gave over his appeal of the well, and carried news to
Bergamo, how this Signiorie had made him patron of the sea, and also of the
Buccetor. But A goodly bargs or brigantine wherein the Venetian Signiorie
recreate themselves in the Adriaticke sea, near to their city.
returning again to his former humors, he had recourse a new unto them,
exclaiming, that he thought it an indignity, when by his Admiralship he might
dispose of so much salt water, for ships to sail upon, and could not have the
fresh water of a well, for provision of his galleies: and those Signiors
perceiving his wit at the highest, for solace and entertainment of the
company, they caused a writing to be made him, subscribed with a coal, and
sealed with an horse brand, wherein they declared, that they made a present
unto him of all the water in the rivers of Sergio, Oio, Brenta, Sile, Piaue,
Tagliamento, Grauallone, Adige, and of that part of Po, which runs through
their dominion, for the use of this affair; and yet in the end, the Fool for
all this concluded, that he would not have so much water, but his house, or
otherwise, he meant to raze the town of Bergamo, even to the very foundation,
together with the goodly chapel there seated and built. No less a dotage is
that, which is reported of one Santino of Tripalda, upon whom an humor came
that at threescore and four years of age, he would needs go to the
University in Padoa, and lighting at an Inn nearest to the public schools,
there read a Physician at the same time that was then the most famous man of
this University, where he entering into the schools, at lecture time amongst
others, while the Doctor by chance was conversant in the argument of the
brain, this dizzard began to shake his head mightily; and finally, not being
able to contain himself at the presence of many scholars, who in the
beginning by reason of the old man's grave countenance and appearance, knew not
of which foot he halted, he cried out aloud, how he would hold and maintain
this conclusion, that the oxen of his town of Tripalda, had more wit, then all the doctors, and scholars that were in Padoa: whereupon, flocking about this
apparent fool, he was presently placed in the chair with much laughter by the
schoolers, very desirous to hear some goodly stuff proceed from this new
archdoctor; and thus entering into the readers seat, whereas they expected one
thing, there succeeded an other, for he began to talk of the means, how to
set upon the Turk and Sophie both at a time; and by and by he leapt to
discourse of the grace of Saint Paul as some prattling Balletters use to do,
and withal, heescapes me quite out of the Turks hands: in the end growing
to this conclusion, that he came to Padoa to be made doctor, and because he
understood, how the scholars of Padoa occupied themselves about a thousand
matters, he meant to read publicly in that University Orlando Furioso, and
without stipend, so that he might have preeminence of the head schools: all in
jesting manner consenting thereunto, and crying out with a lively voice, long
live Santino of Tripalda, for that in his discussion he showed himself so
sufficient, and coming down from the pulpit or readers place, turning to all
the assembly he said: Friends and companions, every one perform his part,
and I give you place, in the lecture following I mean to return to my town
of Tripalda, doctorized thus by your grace, and favor: They therefore of
Santino, of Tripalda, and of Talpino, of Bergamos wit, be in the number of
those fools, whom the vulgar term frantic, or dizzards: and their Cell in
this Hospital, has hanging out for a sign a Minerua, because she is the
Goddess that protecteth this kind of Fools, wherefore prostrate on the earth,
with this ensuing supplication let us implore her aid, for the cure of these
poor bransickes, and witless men.

A prayer to the goddess Minerua for doting and frantic Fools.
TO thee Tritonia^ virgin, worthily adorned with a 1000. lofty epithites, as
of Itonian, Lyndian Medusean, Ionian, Scillutian, Alcessian, Scyras, Elean,
Pylotean, Polian, Glaucopian, and of the Attean virgin, by the Greeks called
Pallas, in that armed with a spear in thy hand, thou art held for a goddess
of arms, and of the Latins Minerua, because thou rightly aduisest them, that
have need of counsel, I unfeignedly direct these my humble prayers: And if
thou be (as all men esteem thee) the goddess of wisdom, borne of
Jupiters brain, in all reason called operative, for that all discreet and
wise operations proceed by thy mean, termed Necina, which is as much as to
say, valiant, because thou art of a constant resolution, and magnanimous in
every one of thy deliberations: made known of all men by the name of Dedala,
which imports as much as witty, because thou art the mother, mistress, and
lady of human wit, I beseech thee receive into thy protection, thesemen, who
forsaken of wit, and abandoned of conceit, by my mean have recourse unto
thee, being wholly nothing but pregnancie and wit: Thouknowest, that whatsoever
they utter is but rudely by them pronounced, they being frantic, and
distraught in such a manner as any action of theirs is commonly reputed
frivolous and rash: Cure this frenzy, to the end that with recovered wit,
regained wisdom, and conceit retired and called home, they may extol thee,
the goddess, fountain, beginning, and cause of conceit, and intellect. I no
farther at this time instigate thee most wise goddess, ne sus Mineruam, as the
proverb says, least being a fool, I should control thy wisdom, thou
being she, who artable to instruct all the world, and keeping the key of all
others knowledge, of all our discipline and understanding: if thou shall but
vouchsafe recovery to these miserable wretches, in thy sacred temple shall be
consecrated to thee a dry Pompion rind, which shall hang at thy feet in token
of the understanding thou have given to thesefooles, who before were as void
of wit, as this gourd is empty of substance: Peace be with thee, and
preserve them that have need of thy help.

Of solitary and melancholic Fools: the third discourse.
THe most renowned Physicians, as well ancient as modern, join in this
fundamental conclusion, that melancholy is to be reputed a kind of dotage,
without fever or fit, which springs from no other thing then abundance of
melancholic humor that occupies the seat of the mind, it being a common
thing with all melancholic persons to have the brain evil affected, either
essentially by nature, or voluntarily by their own consent, as Altomar
affirms Altomare.

where he uses these express words; Melancholica est mentis alienatio,
qualaborantes, velcogitant, vel loquuntur, vel efficient absurda, longeque
aratione and consilio abhorrentia, eaque omnia cum metu ac maestitia, that is,
Melancholy is an alienation of the mind, of which they that labor, think,
speak, and effect things absurd, and far abhorring from reason or counsel,
performing all this with fear and sadness: the which two last signs
Hippocrates sets down forsecure and infallible notes of humor
melancholic: Although Donato Antonio d'Altomare, by the authority of Galen,
in his second book Decausis symptomatum: of Aetius in his particular chapter
of melancholy, and of Trallianus in the thirteenth chapter of his first book,
proves that melancholic men have only their partimaginatiue offended, and
not cogitation, nor memory, they being deceived for the most part about things
to be seen or discerned, wherein the error of imagination concurreth, and not
of the other two faculties. In like manner all generally confess thus much,
that the kinds of this melancholic madness be sundry and diverse, the which may
well be perceived in the progress of this our work in hand: and amongst the
variable effects of this madness, they assign these: that it is accompanied
with little courage or valor: they possessed therewith be replenished with
fear and sadness, not able to yield any reason thereof: they desire to be
solitary: are in hatred with humane conversation; they abhor recreations,
and contentments for a time; and then again (as Theodorus Priscianus in his
second book of Theodorus Priscianus.
things medicinal affirms) they repent themselves for contemning them,
returning often to the same: they desire death, and many times in act procure
it: all which effects concur not ever in one and the same subject, but
torment sometimes severally and apart, and other whiles jointly, and being
unite. Wherefore we may observe infinite kinds of melancholic fools, according
to the superabounding humor, which inciteth one more then an other to greater
and more sottish effects. Galen Galen.
amongst others in his third De locis affectis, testifies of one, who
imagining that he was become nothing but head, shrunk from every body he met

who is said by the Poets to sustain mount Olympus on his shoulders,
ouercharged and wearied with so grievous a weight, should shake it off far
from him, and so he being near might be overwhelmed by the same, could never

always been ready to fall upon his head. And Caelius in the twenty six

chapter of his ninth book, recounteth one Pisander amongst these sort of
fools, who thinking himself to be dead, was woonderfully afraid of meeting
with his own soul, which he esteemed to be a mortal enemy to his body, and
that he might not come to have any thing to do with it, having so injuriously
entreated him, and trecherously borne it self toward him, in leaving his
body. But what shall we say to Nicoletto of Modern examples.
Gattia, who possessed with this indisposition of the brain, thought one day
that he was become the snuff of a candle, and therefore he willed every one to
blow upon him before, behind, and on each side, fearing he should burn so
much while he were all consumed? No less savage and barbarous is the
melancholic and salt humor of this kind, which sometimes one Toniolio of
Marastica had, who being in fantasy persuaded, that he was a shoe piece,
went upon his buttocks as far as Vincenza, holding his feet in his hand for
fear some cobbler in disgrace, should have set him upon the heels or soles of
his shoes. And surely I believe that humor to be no less gross which took
Bertazzuolo of Nuuolara in the head, whose with being ouercast, he one day
thought that he was turned into a Chioggia pompion, and so with his head he
went iobbing against this and that man's nose, crying out, that in any wise no
body should buie him, because it was not yet August, when they are ripe. But I
will shut up the follies of these miserable sort with the ridiculous example of
Petruccio of Prato, who believing verily that he was a grain of mustard seed,
cast himself into a great barrel of made mustarde which a chandler had set
before his shop door, endamnifying this poor man to the value of eight or
ten ducates, who would never have believed such a thing. Among these humors
of melancholy, the Physicians place a kind of madness by the Greeks called
Lycanthropia, termed by the Latins Insania Lupina; or wolves fury: which
brings a man to this point (as Attomare affirms) that in February he will
go out of the house in the night like a wolf, hunting about the graves of the
dead with great howling, and pluck the dead men's bones out of the sepulchers,
carrying them about the streets, to the great fear and astonishment of all
them that meet him: And the foresaid author affirms, that melancholic
persons of this kind, have pale faces, soaked and hollow eyes, with a weak
sight, never shedding one tear to the view of the world, a dry tongue,
extreme thirst, and they want spittle and moisture exceedingly: where he also
alleges that he saw two mightily troubled and oppressed with such an
humor: But in this point Foruaretto of Lugo may serve for a notable example,
who suffering this madness in his imagination and cogitatiue parts (for all men
agree not touching the memory) he went one night into the Jews churchyard,
where there had been lately buried an old Jew, more then fowrescore years
of age, he having been sick more then six years of a dropsy, and taking up
this body upon his shoulders, he went to a spacious place before the castle
playing with this dead carcass, as if he had been at Ballown, and crying out
sometimes serve, sometimes send it home to me, now strike, then play, he by
little and little raised up all that quarter, and the rumor went from hand to
hand, through all the Hebrew families, that this man had disenterred master
Simon, (for so was the dead Jew called) whereupon there presently grew a
Synagogue of immeasurable laughter in their presence, when they saw this Fool,
how he took one of his legs by the small in stead of a braser, and the body full
garbadge for a Ballowne, at every blow his Hydropicall tunnage issuing forth,
which was a fortnights work for that people, to alay the stinche thereof
only; many of the more obstinate sort, being ready to pay the penalty of a
Carline, for not making clean the market place, rather A little piece of money
in Italy.
then they would purge the perfume of Master Simons carkase, it being no
counterfeit, or pedlarie ware. Melancholic and savage Fools, be therefore of
this Tribe, who have in this Hospital a Cell, much like the Grot, or Cave of
Cumean Sibilla, and before the gate thereof, it has Jupiter for a sign, whom
as protector of such like people, we will in this invocation following call
upon for aid and help.

A petition to Jupiter for melancholic and savage Fools.
THis troop of weakelings, deprived of all help and advise, directed by thy
name and by my mean, have recourse unto thee, thou greatest son of Opis and
Saturn, brother and companion to Queen Juno, condignlie called Jupiter, in
respect of the help thou affoords them that need; the most excellent and
greatest, for thy infinite goodness wherewith thou gouernest the whole world, a
father, a creator, altitonant king of the gods, lord of the world, rector of
Olympus, corrector of faults and offenses, highest father aetherean, Sceptiger,
omnipotent, with many other illustrous titles, because al things at the least
point with thy finger, are ready to obey: wherefore being moved by so great
deity, and by so great majesty stirred up, I request thee by that pity the
Curetians showed in nourishing thee in mount Ida, to have commiseration of
these poor comfortless people: and if the love of Europa, or of thy sweet
page Ganimede comfort thee at the heart, thinking on the martyrdom, suffered
pain, sustained and passed vexations of so great pleasures afterward
ensuing, by the same judicial insight, I conjure thee to ease these afflicted,
to comfort these distressed, and to deliver out of vexation and grief the
melancholistes, who are put over to thee as to their favorable star: If thou
be he that begot Minerua, goddess of wisdom, purge their heads of so
great folly, wherewith they abound. If thou be truly called Panompheus, for
that thou hear every man's voice, atte^d then not the voices, but even the
shrill cries and exclamations of these abandoned. If thou be the Hospital
Jupiter, so celebrated of Poets, have care of these who in a poor Hospital
call out aloude for thy succor. If thou be that Jupiter Penetrant, held so
dear in old time, let these men's miseries pearce not only to the ears, but
even to the bowels of such a pitiful gods heart. If thou be the Lapidian
Jupiter which workest woonders in stones, what greater miracle can thou
perform then this, to remove from these insensible stones the savage and
obdurate humor they are possessed withal? If thou be that Jupiter whom all
men call Genius, for the inclination and desire thou have to be fauouable to
all, have a little regard I beseech thee unto them who have need of thy
greatest grace. If thou be that prodigious Jupiter who has wrought so many
miracles in former ages, perform presently this wonder, that thorns may
become roses, thistles lillies, and nettles gilloflowers: and then with lively
voice the whole Hospital will resounde, ever live thou great Jupiter Elician,
Anxurian, Egyocian, Lycian, Dodonean, Latian, Diotean, Predatorian, Vltorean,
Pistorean, Ammonian, Elean, Celean, Atabyrian, Casian, Eleutherian,
Nicephorean, Papean, Lucetian, Olympian, Labryandrian, Lapria^, Melionian,
Assabian, Hercean, Larysian, Enesyan, Pluuian, Triphalian: and with solemn
hymns they will all run unto thy temples, offering to thy image a thousand
bunches of wild rue, for having purged these men of so great bestialitie as
reigned in them: Confident therefore in thy accustomed assistance, I expect for
these impotent, due help and aid.

Of idle and careless Fools: the fourth discourse.
IN the tribe of Fools, it is requisite we also number certain idle or
careless men, who seem always to be asleep in matters concerning
themselves, being surprised with such a slothfulnes, that in a manner
Diogenianus his proverb Diogenianus.
in them is verified, which is, they sleep Epimenides his sleep; in their
actions and affairs manifesting themselves, I will not say rude or uncivil,
but even negligent, sluggish, and altogether sleepie headed. That may well be
said of these men, which otherwise is affirmed by the Cimmeria^s, who are
ouershadowed with such obscurity and darkness, that bright shining Phoebus has
taken upon him perpetual banishment out of their minds, Homer thus saying of
those people: The sun on them his beams does seldom cast:
Nor in his chariot mounts the glittring sky:
To earth descending when the day is past.
And amongst these may we rightly place that Vacia a Roman citizen mentioned
by Seneca in his epistles, Seneca.
for a special example of carelessenes, who growing old in sloth, gave
orignall to a proverb; For when they would speak of an idle fool, and one
sottishly secure, they would say, Vaciahio sit us est; this is a sordid or
sluggish Vaciahio. It seems also that Ovid alludeth to these men in that
verse: Stulte, quid est somnus gelidae nisi mortis imago? Ovid.

What other is sleep but deaths pale image wan?
For questionless a fool of this kind is so drowsy in all his operations,
as hemay in a manner be said to be dead: whereupon master John Dante having
relation to such miserable people, vtttered these verses following concerning
them: The world of these, no fame, will aie permit:
Mercy, and justice, hold them in disdain:
No words: to look, and leave them is more fit.
But if modern examples be of greater force, to discover Modern examples.
to the world this unhappy sort of men, we may observe that of Cauccio
Lupidio, for one most notable, who entering into an Inn, while his companions
supped merrily, and sat two hours at the table, he was two hours, and a
quarter in tying one of his shoe strings; and when the oaste thinking he had
supped with the rest, called upon him to go to bed, he yet demanded a bodkin
to make a new hole for his shoe tying, judging that this shoe sat not yet
clean enough to his mind. But surely that of Marchetto Piombino, is no less
famous, who going to Rome to seek a master and to learn some trade wherewith
to gain his living, in the way he light by chance upon a stone, the which he
began to spurn before him with his feet; and before he recovered the nearest
gate of Rome, all his companions that set out with him, returning back, found
him yet encombred about rouling that stone before him: finally in presence of
them all, he sat down upon the ground, and said: that when he once came to
Rome walls, he would thrust it so far in, as that afterward, it might never
more annoy such strangers as traveled thither. These miserable, and
unfortunate crew therefore, deprived of wit and understanding, having need of
Apolloes illumination and grace, they maintain the ensign of him, as of their
Protector, before their Cell, whilst they remain in obscurity and holes, in
this darksome Guest-house of their madness; wherefore with solemn
supplications, let us call upon god Apollo in their aid: saying:

An orizon to Apollo for idle and careless Fools.
OSacred Apollo, called by the Graecia^s Phoebus, who with thy golden hair or
beams comfortest both the one and the other Hemispheare, acceptable to all,
discourteous to none, cast such a light of thy divine beams upon this blind
and careless retinue of fools, that they may perceive themselves by thee in
mind rectified, and thus enjoying thy divine illumination, exalt and magnify
by this means, that thy virtue and power which slew the proud Cyclopes,
wounded the wicked sons of Niobe, and extinguished that cursed serpent
Python, whereupon thou drewest to thy self that glorious title of Pythius:
Thou planter of Amfrisus, inhabiter of Parnassus, lover of Helicone; lord of
fount Caballyne, patron of the Laurel, inuentor of the Harp, master of
Astrology, and prince of Physic, help these poor slimslacks, who have need
of internal remedies, for the restitution of their disturbed brain, destitute
wit, obfuscate understanding, lost memory: and as thou art called Pronopius,
for delivering the Beotia^s from gnats; Lemnius for curing the Sicilians of the
plague; Erethibius for healing the Rhodians of the Emeroydes, so I beseech thee
by these noble titles correspondent to thy great dietie, with the others of
Thimbrius, Cataoneus, Cylleus, Tenateus, Larisseus, Tilposius, Leucadius,
Philleus, Lybissinus, and Symtheus, as also Patareus, of the town of Patara in
Lycia, Cyntheus of Cynthio in the i will of Delos, Cyrrheus of Cyrrha, Clorius of
Claria in Colophonia, Lycius of Lycia, Crineus of a wood in Ionia so called,
and Marmorius of the castle Marmorio, that it may please thee to add unto
these epythites this one other of the great Physician of Fools idle and
slothful, to the end that thy name throughout the whole world, with exceeding
praises, may be extolled and magnified. But if in commiseration thou regardest
these men, as thou have done the former nations, in honor of thee, thou shall
see consecrated before thy image a pair of spectacles of sixty pound weight
in thy Temple of Delphos, as a true sign of thy having recovered, and healed
so senseless a people as these were, and always this one honor shall be
attributed to thee, that the blind see by mean of great Apolloes spectacles
at their noses: dispatch therefore, and make haste of thy help, for thou can
not delay never so little, but these now careless and idle Fools, will in the
end prove absolute dolts, and cockscombes.

Of drunken Fools: the fifth discourse.
IT is an evident, and manifest thing, that amongst the diverse kinds of
matter, that procured by the fume, and vapor of wine, is to be placed; which
constituteth these kind of Fools, whom we commonly call drunkards; they being
of this quality, that when they be heated and chafed with wine, they raise
such tumults and noise, as they resemble herein Steropus or Bruntus in Vulcane
his forge: wherefore Atheneus Atheneus.
the Philosopher in the fourteenth book of his Gymnosophistes, propounds this
question: wherefore Dionysius or Liberus is fained by the Poets to be mad, to
which demand he answers in the first chapter, with these words: Many (friend
Timocrates) feigned Dionysius to be mad, because they that use wine immoderatly,
become tumultuous; which matter was also touched by Ovid in these verses:
Beware of brawles often stirred up in wine: Ovid.

And of that hand, which strikes out of time.
And Herodotus in this consideration says, that wine Herodotus.
once taken down into a man's body, mad and foolish words are produced.
Xenophon also being to give good Xenophon.
counsel to the great Captain Agesilaus, about abstinence from wine, used
these words: Refrain drunkenness and madness; making, it should seem, no
difference between a drunkard and a mad Fool: for the vapor of wine mounting
up into the brain, takes from a man sight, knowledge, and judgment, and
ouerwhelmeth all the noblest faculties of our soul in an instant the which
thing Saint Ambrose touched excellently well in his S. Ambrose.
book of Fasting, saying: Cum ebrij fuerint de continentia disputant, vbi vnus
quisque pugnas suas enarrat, ibi fortia facta praedicat, vino madidus, and
somno dissolutus, nescit mente quid lingua proferat, which signifies: when
they are drunk they argue of continency, where every one declares the
dangerous fights he has been in, there he sets forth his valiantacts,
thus drowned in wine and drowsy with sleep, the mind conceiues not what the
tongue utters. Whereupon in the Decretals, not without cause in the thirty
ninth distinction these profitable Gratianus.
words be registered: It is far from a wise man's part to apply himself to
eating, banqueting, and drunkenness: And in this point our Poet Dante, greatly
Dante,
commends the first Saturnian age, when they went not into cellars to broach
hogsheads, but ran with their hands to the fresh water rivers, saying: The
former age which was of purest gold,
Made acornes sauorie, with sharp hunger sause:
And Nectar sweet, of river water cold.
Oh, happy were this our age, if with such abstinence it were endued, but the
truth is, they are now adays no other, but giddie-headed Pyes, chattering
after fifty in the hundred, when the good Rhenish liquor begins to work.
Among those of late days, one example of Margute of Binasco is able to fill
the whole world with laughter; for when he has drunk but three cups of
muskadell, then he sleeps like god Bacchus, and thus his wits riding on the
spur, at last he arriueth with the first post in Lubberland, where at the
first setting of foot, he meets Tom Tospot, taking him for the best
companion in the world: but when the good Canarie gets but up to his crown,
then like one of the Menades or Bacchus furious Nuns, he runs up and down
the house, filling every place with such terror, as it seems, another wild
Baiardo has broken his halter, no man daring to come in the way of such a
headstrong beast as this: yet sometimes he procures to the company great
solace and recreation, as that night he did, when being drunk, and going to
bed, he beheld the moon, and thinking it had been a river, he said to his
companions and friends; Hold me I pray you, for fear I drown my self in this
river. Among the ancients, the Scythians, and Thracians are greatly blamed,
because the greatest glory they took, was in drinking while they were drunk:
wherefore Horace writes of them. The Thracians toss the bowls with merry
glee: Horace.

And Aristotle in reproach of the Syracusanes makes Aristotle.
mention, that sometimes they continued 90. days one after an other in this
irksome custom, of being every day drunk, holding it for a noble and
glorious practice. It is written of Nero above all others, that he was so
addicted to ebrietie, as that for this cause he was ignominiouslie in stead of
Tiberius called Biberius; for Claudius, Caldius; and for Nero, Mero, or Wine.
But he that knownes not what an evil ebrietie is, let him only read the
description of Bacchus, set down by the Poets, for by this he shall be
clearly satisfied concerning the error thereof: For Bacchus was painted in
form of a boy, in that, drunkardes forgo their wit and understanding: and in
woman's form, because drunkards perform no operation manlike: disroabed and
naked, for that a man can communicate no secret with ebrious men: and drawn in
a chariot, because instabilitie and inconstancy is incident to them: with an
iuie garland about his head, in that, as the iuie weakeneth and ruinateth walls,
so drunkards are apt to all kind of waste and spoil. And thus much may
suffice for this race of fools, who within the Hospital before their Cell,
have god Abstemius for an ensign, because he is the protector and advocate of
all drunkardes: wherefore let us have recourse unto him in this petition
following, for their favor and furtherance,

A petition to god Abstemius for drunken Fools.
WIth few words, but with so much the more groaning of spirit in such great
need, I come unto thee O thou contemner of Lyaeus, adversary to Bacchus, foe
to Liberus, and mortal enemy to Bromius, beseeching thee by that virtue
through which thou did effect, that the Locrians held it for a capital
offense, to be drunken with wine, and stirredst up in Mosco Sophista, and
Apollonius Thianeus, thoughts here from so remote and alienate, they hating
the Phigalians above any contagious disease, in that their whole life was in
the bottom of cellers; that thou would reform these men of this foolish
desire they have, to be every day drunk. And if thou grantest them this grace
and favor, we at this present make a vow, to hang up before thy image a
bottle full of good Zante cuite, in token of the health thou have vouchsafed
this foolish crew, more of good will, then for any use thou have of it. Peace
be with thee, and help those that have need of thy assistance.

Of harebraind and forgetful Fools: the sixth discourse.
AMongst the Physicians of late time, John Fernelius Ambianus, in Fernelius.
defining what madness is, precisely vttreth these words, that, Amentia est vel
imaginationis, vel mentis occasus, atque priuatio, qua iam ab ipso ortu
perculsi affectique vix inopia mentis loqui discunt; which imports; that
madness is a privation, or falling away of imagination or the mind, wherewith
they stricken and possessed from their birth, scarcely through this impotencie
of mind learn to speak: and he adds heereunto: In this kind is a
slipperie Huius classis est fluxa, and amissa memoria.
and brittle memory, the loss of which memory constituteth those sort of
fools whom we usually term harebrainde or forgetful; and these men in this
one point may easily be discerned; for they retain with them no discourse at
all, nor enjoy not the least spark of meditation, that opinion of Galens
continuing true Galen.
in the Proeme of his book of Sects: that Memoriam commendat magna, and
frequens rerum meditatio: great and frequent meditation of things confirms
memory. True it is that these fools may spring and arise from some defect in
nature, as also from some extraordinary accident, while a man is adultus, or
in adolescencie, as examples by authors produced give testimony to the whole
world. Caelius amongst others speaking Caelius
of those, who by accident have lost their memory, says, that Messala Coruinus
a singular Orator in his time, two years before he died, lost his memory in
such a sort, that he could not deliver four words together of one matter, or
that might be sensible in the understanding and ears of an hearer. The like
Bibaculus writes Bibaculus.
to have happened to Orbilius Beneuentanus, he that by Marcus Tullius is called
the severe or rigorous master toward his scholars. Among those so sterile of
memory, Cicero sets down the example of Curio the greater, who was of so
little and brittle memory, that Cicero.
sometimes in judgment he forgot the whole cause discussed of. And Seneca
writes of Caluisius Sabinus, that Seneca.
naturally he was endued with so frail a memory, as sometimes he would
forget Ulysses name, now Priamus, and anon that of Achilles, although before
they were settled in his mind. The admirable folly of Corebus, son to Migdo a
Phrigian, concerning memory, is celebrated by Lucianus and Eustasius; for he
contended to Lucianus. Eustasius.

could not go above the number of five. And Pliny for a last example recites
how the Thracians are of so dull a wit, and fickle memory, that they Plinius.
cannot reckon to the number of four. And of Atticus the son of Herod
Sophista, he declares for a certain truth, that he was of so slipperie a
retention, as he could not carry in mind the first letters or alphabet of his
own country language. The intemperature of the brain is the cause of all this
(as physicians affirm) which makes all the official, and functiue parts full
of heaviness and indisposition, and so through this hebetude (to use their
term) unapt to keep in mind any thing. Amongst these of our time, the
example of one Melchior Modern examples.
of Riuabassa is most notable, who in his time was so forgetful and harebraind
a fool, that when any asked him his fathers or mothers names, he was not
sufficient to call them to mind. And this is that sottish Melchior which one
day at Bergamo fair demanded of his friend whether the Jews were Christians
or no. As also that other example of Marchetto of Toletino is very ridiculous,
who being invited to dinner by certain gentlemen of Foligno, and by reason of
his age wanting teeth wherewith to chew, he forgot certain artificial teeth,
which bound fast together with a silver wier or thread, he was wont to use,
and returning home, he turned all things topsie turuie, even to a great barn
of corn which he had, thinking that undoubtedly he had left them there
within. These be therefore giddie headed and forgetful fools, who have
allotted unto them within the Hospital a room, which is called the lodge of
oblivion, having before the gate hanging out for a sign, the image of Caron,
as a god propitious and favorable to their necessities, upon whom therefore in
their aid and assistance I call, with this invocation following.

A supplication unto Caron for harebraind and forgetful Fools.
NOw I turn me to old Caron, prince of the Stigian lake, lord of Cocytus,
famous pylate of Lethes, principal keeper of Phlegeton: and by thy boat which
ferrieth over mortal men to the lake of oblivion, I entreat thee that thou
would look back upon this forgetful rablement, who having lost their
remembrance of things worldly, stand plunged in the water of Lethes, nay and
gorged up to the very throat: Vouchsafing help to this madging, thou shall
before thy grave bearded image, and in the temple consecrated to thy name
amongst the Cizenians, see hanged up a case of crickets, as a sign of thy
helping these fools; who having now worse memories then a cricket, shall
then discover so ample remembrance, that blessed Caron to his great glory, may
remember himself to draw out of that Lethean gulf those men, who are now
continually drowned and buried therein: Bear up therefore the helm of thy
bark, and pass them over at an instant, while the memory thereof is fresh,
and the need greater then ever heretofore.

Of stupide, forlorn, and extaticall Fools: the seventh discourse.
IN the rank and number offooles are they also worthy to be placed, who in
their actions, words, deliberations, and resolutions, seem like immooueable
and insensiblestones: whereupon, men assignethem the name of stupide, forlorn,
and extaticall fools, they being in a manner half dead in all the operations
that proceed from them: Of this race were the people Gousofanti, inhabiters of
one part of Libya, who were of so dead and fearful a disposition, that they
shunned the meeting with any one, neither could they be brought to converse
with any men living, they thinking themselves half kilde in other men's
company. The ancient Rhegians are likewise described to be of this nature, who
by their slothfulnes and wonderful timiditie, raised a proverb, that when men
spoke of an abject or cowardly man, they would say Rheginis timidior; more
fearful then the Rhegians: Who will deny that Artemon the Grecian to have
been a stupide fool, and stripped of all wit, that enclosed himself in a house
so long time between two walls, and to no purpose, causing two of his servants
to hold an iron target continually over his head, to the end nothing might
fall upon him from above, to his hurt or danger; and when sometimes he went
abroad out of the house, he was borne in a litter with a cover over it, bravely
accommodated for the same fear. What report Aristophanes and Lucianus of one
Aristophanes. Lucianus.
Pluto, but that he was so silly in mind, that every little puff of wind
made him tremble from head to foot? In our times we have a memorable example
of Monferrino, who being to make an Oration before certain persons, when he
was mounted into the pulpit shut his eyes, and with his eye lids closed, and
tongue trembling like a bubling spring water, he could scarcely finish his
exordium before he was in a sort distracted. This likewise once fell out to
one Colombino Bergamasco (although he was thought to have had an excellent wit)
that in praying he made very many and often gestures; but his words were
choked in the half utterance, for while he was fervent in gesture, his words
as frozen, durst not discover themselves, there being so little correspondencie
betwixt the one and the other. Among these examples, I judge that of the
Salonesian to be thanks worthy, who when he was come to the bar to plead
in favor of a clyent of his, was suddenly surprised with a cold sweat, which
put him into a tertian fever, that as it were in post, sent him headlong to
hell, or the region of Rhadamanthus. Now these Fools are properly recommended
to Sentinus, protector of them insensate, and before their Cell in the
Hospital they have erected his ensign, because they expect from him that
aid, which we in this petition following, earnestly seek for at his hands.

A petition to God Sentinus, for stupide, forlorn, and extaticall Fools.
FRom the patron of humane senses, life and vigor of these members, and the
virtue and power of our spirits, which grauntest convenient courage to persons
timorous and benumbed, do these poor stupide, and forlorn Fools expect
opportune help and succor, to the end the valor thou gave to Theseus and
Pirithous to enter the irreturnable shadows of god Ditis his house; as also
that thou gave to Jason, and Typhis to furrow the raging waves of the
Colchian sea, he to ravish fair Proserpina, and the other to steal away the
golden-fleece, so much esteemed, that this virtue (I say) by thy grace being
found in them, they may appear to be miraculously delivered, to thy great
honor and glory, from the fear and amasement of death. The which if they
obtain (as they hope to do) they will offer to thy glorious deity, a fair
bunch of nettles, as acknowledging their recovered sense, from the sting of thy
divinity, and their wit lost happily restored: yield therefore to their
prayers, if this glory touch thee so near the heart, as rightly it ought.

Of notted, gross, and Fools of light carriage: the eight discourse.
THis gross sort of ignorants commonly called Oxe-heads, who natu rally
apprehend nothing, and when they are in the market are so incircumspect, that a
man may make them believe that an ass is a parrate, are they whom we term by
the name of gross, notted, and fools of light carriage. Egnatius to this
purpose makes mention of one Britannio, who naturally was so gross and
blockish, as his Battista Egnatio.
master could never make impression in him, of the least part of the Alphabet.
And Philonides the Miletane, large of body, but of as gross conceit as a
sheep, was of so dull an apprehension, that men minding to speak of a foolish
calfe, they prouerbially used to say Indoctior Philonide, more unlearned then
Philonides. In our days Modern examples.
we have Checco of Minerbio to observe for notable stupiditie, who was of
opinion one day, that Bologna gellie, or Marmalate was made with butter, and
therefore on a fasting day at night he would eat none, while the rest of his
companions fell hard to the box, saying, they had long before been dispensed
withal for this iniunction. Much more gross then this man did Santuccio of
Fermo show himself, who at a repast of certain good fellows at port Fermo,
eat a perri-winkle in stead of an oyster, affirming to all of them, that it
was the goodliest oyster that ever was seen in that port. That likewise of
Castruccio of Rouigo is no less sottish, who was verily made believe, that
Prester John was no other but the vicar of Bebbe, or Saint Asses: And that
other reported of Scarlino of Viadana is as palpable, who was once of
irremooueable opinion, that the great church steeple of Pisa, sailed as far
as Legorne, and afterward returned again to his proper place. But the truth
is, that this last makes up the whole matter which is recited of one
Andruccio of Scarparia, who one day made a friend of his believe, that in the
forest of Baccano were seen five hundredth Turkish galleies, which went to
take the city of Rome, and that the Popes soldiers had with forty thousand
Ballown squirts performed such a piece of service, that they were all in a
manner broken, and overthrown in that wood, the ribs of them being
dispersed all over as they went. Of these ninnies, a number are borne in
Valtolina, and specially in Valcamonica, and they are so sottishly credulous,
that they believe whatsoever is spoken; as he which thought the Arsenal of
Venice was a shop of drinking glasses; and an other who believed that the
steeple of Saint Marks in Venice, for suspicion of treason A village five or
six miles from Venice.
was banished for ten years to Lizzafucina: another also being more blockish
then a dromedarie, who believed that the Buccentor or Venetian barge, booted it
self, and rid in a night from Venice to Tripolie in Soria; and another huge
Ox or Oarke, that the river of Poe had the water of Brenta to wife, and that
therefore Adige as a corriuall in this love, was angry with Poe, neither would
have any further conjunction with it: and last of all, that member of an ass,
or Cammel, who believed that Montebaldo of Verona, going one day a hunting,
light upon the Banditi, and being by them bid Or banished men.
stand, he took a crossebow in his hand, and with one shoot, killed twelve of
them. Wherefore these men have a Cell in the Hospital, which has hanging out
for a sign, the Egyptians Ox, because to him, as to their protector and
advocate, they are recommended. Therefore I call upon him in this petition
following, for their assistance and aid.

A petition to the Egyptians Ox, for notted, gross, and Fools of light
carriage.
THese dull-pated-Calfes have recourse unto thee, thou most sollemne Ox of the
Egyptians, by all men called, Apis, and Serapis, to obtain at thy hands this
favor, that seeing they be Oxen (as thou art) thou will be unto them so
gracious, that they become not one day more gross then Cammels. For that
honor therefore which is done unto thee in Egypt, which far exceeds the
golden Tortoyse of the Troglodites; the gilded Aspes of the Phenicians; the
Assyrians golden Dove; the Thessalians golden Storke; the gilded Lioness of
Ambracia; or those of the Albanes golden Dragon; the Thebans gilded Weazell; or
the golden Cow of the Tenedians, I pray and rebeseech thee to grant unto them
this demanded grace and favor. The which if thou shall do (as we hope no
less) in the Temple consecrated to thee, and before thy image thou shall see
placed a bottle of hay, with an hay-stacke hard by, to show that these men
continue by thy favor in their oxen estate, not growing to grosser stupiditie.

Of dottrels and shallow-pated Fools: the ninth discourse.
THese Unfortunate, and Lourdish sort, that so often have their wits a
wooll-gathering, their heads being as empty of wit, as an egshel, and that
through the absurdity of their gestures, words and cogitations move every
one to laughter that hears them, in this Catologue of Fools are termed,
dottrels, and men shallow-pated. And such did the Bithinians discover
themselves to be, who (as Caelius writes) climbed Caelius.
up to the tops of mountains, and there saluted and talked with the moon,
although from her they received no answer at all. The Boetians, as Authors
testify, retained also this kind of Folly: whereupon the Poet Horace says:
Boetians borne in gross and foggie air. Horace.

Amongst those of late days, the example of Francino of Matelica may suffice,
who not forbearing to play the fool kindly, took his Mothers rock every
morning, she being 70. years of age, and sitting in the sun, he would
needs be spinning of varne, but he so besnared the thread and tow together, as
the old woman being stark mad, was feign to break the rock continually
upon his head, and thus rating and chiding, she half despaired of her son
whom she saw to have so little wit and understanding. Mattuccio of Valuasson
poor silly soul, was also such an one, for when his father sent him into the
country, to see what the harvest folks did, although he was four and thirty
years old, he fell a playing with the children at Musse and Scailepin,
occupying himself the whole day in such fopperies: afterward returning home,
without relating any thing to that purpose for which he was sent. There was an
other also of Castle Bubano in Romagna, in wit sympathizing much with the name
of his country, who barren of all conceit, one day when he should have carried
victuals to certain workmen, by his masters commandment, he went into a
corne-field to make of these droanes and oten pipes that children use to play
upon, and consumed the whole day in these ninneries, the workmen expecting in
vain that this hammar-headed dolte should bring them their dinner, being
half dead with hunger. But this example of Tonino Buffalora, gives life to
themall, who in his return from Rome, passing through the forest of Rauenna,
he filled a wallet full of flies and gnats, being such great ones as that wood
affoordeth, and a good large pillowbeere with horse-flies, carrying them into
his country, where being arrived, he presently sent to his friends and
kinsfolks, that they would come and see him, for he would present them with
certain strange conceits which he had brought with him from Rome; who though
they knew him to be but a fool, yet took they him not for so very a sotte as
at last they found him; for taking them all a tone side into a secret chamber,
he powered out before them that huge number of flies, gnats, and hornets, which
flewe in the eyes and faces of every one, with some small disturbance, yet
giving them so great occasion to laugh, as surely for the nouelty of this jest
they were ready to burst therewith. Fools therefore of this brood be all
termed dizzards and shallow-pated, who within this Hospital have hanging out
for a sign, the Samian sheep, as their great favorer: and therefore in this
supplication we will request his aid and succor.

A supplication to the Samian sheep, for shallow-pated, and dottrell Fools.
IF the honor which the ancient Samians did unto thee (O reverend Sheep) be
such, as it far exceeds that which the Delphians did to the wolf thy
enemy, and greatly surmounteth that which was performed to the Romans
goose, and the Egyptians goat, and if thy glorious worship be one of the
greatest solemnities that ever any people has religiously celebrated; by this
honor, and by such worship, I now entreat thee, that of these thy sheep thou will have that care, which unto thy self being one, seems convenient, and so
much the rather, because if thou be not propitius unto them now at their
need, thou will loose their devotion, who readily rebelling from sheep will
give themselves in pray to god Castron: If therefore Calfe.
thou vouchsafe them help, we will offer a cheese of sheep milk, like to
those of Gualdo or Rimini, to thy sacred image; which shall give all the world
occasion to speak of thee, and all men shall cry out: Live sheep and
sheepes-heads for ever.

Of senseless and giddie-headed Fools: the tenth discourse.
THere is a nest of certain Fools, who vulgarly are called, Fools
Senseless, and giddie-headed: and by these circumstances they may be
discerned: for they never speak to the purpose, do according to the time,
perform any thing worthily, nor produce any thing seriously, or with gravity,
but in every speech, gesture, word, sign, and action they are so simple, that
they may deservedly be called of every one by the name, of Silly, and
Senseless creatures. Hereupon Marcus Tullius in the second of his Orator,
declaring Cicero.
the nature and property of one these, says thus: Qui tempus quid postulet,
non videt, aut plura loquitur, aut se ostentat, aut eorum, cum quibus est, vel
dignitatis, vel commodi rationem non habet, aut denique in aliquo genere
inconcinnus, aut multus est, is ineptus dicitur. He that observes not what the
time requires, babbling out many things, vaunting himself, having no respect
to the dignity, or commodity of those in whose company he is, or that, (to
conclude) in any kind whatsoever, is inseasonable, or superfluous, may be said
to be foolish. In my opinion that ancient Amphistides, named by Caelius, may
well Caelius.
be placed in the number of these men; who was of so flat and rebated a brain,
as he knew not thus much, whether he came of a father and mother, as commonly
we do, or no. Acesias the Physician may likewise be numbered among these
senseless; for this was his property, that when he had any cure in hand, he
administered to him, in a quite contrary course, to that he should have done:
whereupon Paulus Manutius uses this proverb. Paulus Manutius.
Acesias Medicatus est: Acesias did such a cure. Among those of our time,
Franceschino of Montecuculo, Modern examples.
was held for a great Dizzard, who conforming himself in actions with the name
of his country, entering into the court to defend a client of his, alleged
such testimony and proof, as was quite contrary to the poor man. A certain
fellow called Hortensio of Sarni, was by a judge in some particular cause,
reproved for a Fool of this kind, for having framed a process, for the
Latinitie thereof altogether excellent and Ciceronian yet in the rest of the
clauses, so impertinent and out of order, as the Judge was urged to tell him,
that another time he might do well, and bring before him some country or
Scottish Iigs, for such bables would better content him in the reading, then
such a bald process of Piouan Arlotto. That Castelline grosser showed himself
to be anotable Fool and buzzard, who when he should have served a maid with
starche, sold her in steed thereof, powdered Arsenicke Christalline, who through
his folly caused the mistres of the house well near to die with the fume of
the same. No less a wise-aker did one Lirone, some applesquier, manifest
himself, who when he was willed to scum the pipkin that ran over, not knowing
what to do, put out all the broth, leaving the meat dry in the pipkins
bottom, while the Cook was ready to serve in dinner. No less sottish was
Bastiano of Monselice, who serving a certain Neapolitane Signior, that
commanded him to set upon the table some citrons and oranges, went into the
orchard, and plucked up by the roots the best plants of the same that were in
the whole orchard, bringing them all in a bundell to his master, with great
damage, and no small reproach to himself. A like example to this, is that of
another Bergamascan blockhead, who being commanded by his master, that he
should go up into the Lobby, and fetch some billets to burn, he went with an
hatchet in his hand and began to hew hard at certain beams that sustained the
house; when his master observing his delay, fetch him down with sound
bastinadoes on his shoulders. But this other example of Lucchino of Fusolara is
not altogether threadbare, for he serving one of these that sell Malmsie,
whiles his master willed him to entertain a certain honest man his friend,
and that he should taste of every hogshead, meaning that he should broach
them, took one of those great beetles that wood-cleauers use, with which he
staued more then four, before his master was ware of his own error, or the
others simplicity. Marie this last example, is that which carries it, for
Bartolo of Calepio in Bergamasco, being seruitor in Venice with a very rich
chandler, who one day being to make Tapers, the vessel boiling hot, and the
wax being melted, demanded what it was that so boiled in the vessel; to
whom his master smoothly answered without laughing, that it was sugar, and
honey mixed together to make marchpanes of: whereupon this liquorish cockscomb
tarrying while his master would be out of the way, he took one of the shop
ladles, and before the wax was cold, while it was good and hot, he suppes
me up a ladell full of the same, so melting his teeth, tongue, and bowelles,
that he was ready in a manner to brast, and recounting this accident to his
master, he likewise with laughing almost splitte himself, perceiving this
nyddicocke to be thus beguiled. These therefore be senseless or
giddie-headded Fools, who in the Hospital enjoy a Cell; which has hanging
out the goddess Bubona for a sign, as one truly favorable to such like men:
wherefore in this invocation following they be recommended to her.

An Invocation upon the goddess Bubona, for senseless and giddie-headed
Fools.
THese Geese of Romagna, Puglian sheep, and Asses of Marcanconitan, infinitely
recommend themselves to the most happy goddess Bubona, friend to Pan, Lady
of the Flocks, keeper of the Herds, and most faithful guardian of the
sheepfolds: and they conjure thee by the love of Pasiphaes Bull, Aristo
Ephesian his Ass, Cratides the shepherd his goat, and by the mare so dearly
beloved of Fuluius, that thou will also protect this flock of the foresaid
creatures, little differing from them: and if it fall out that thou shall
undertake their tuition, as they desire, they will consecrate unto thee a wild
whole roasted Buffle, and therewith sing an excellent hymn, which in every
verse shall make mention of Bubona, and the Buffle together: Reach therefore thy
helping hand to these Buffles, if thou mindest that this invocation shall be
consecrated with all honor, and glory.

Of plain lourdish, and natural Fools: the eleventh discourse.
THere be certain silly wretches in the world, so blockish in resoning, harsh
in proceeding, and in their operatio^s, proceedings, and negotiations so
foolish, that in all right they obtain the title of lourdish and natural fools
in the world, being distinct from al those we have before made mention of. And
if we be content to refer our selves to the examples of ancient writers, we
must necessarily affirm, that Miltiades so celebrated by Homere, was one of
these archdolts: for he then came to succor Troy, when the city was already
ruinated, and destroyed, and therefore it grew into a proverb with Lucian.
Mitiadis auxilium, Lucian.
the succor of Miltiades: when men would speak of slow aid, or succors, or
of a gross and witless man. One Mammachutus also is made famous by
Aristophanes for this one point; for in his proceedings of the world, he was so
stupide and insensate, as from him it comes that all naturals and
cockscombes, are as it were prouerbially called Mammachutes. This dizzardly
crew is made renowned by Gratianus of Bologna in his Comedies; for when you
hear such a like man discourse, you would not wish to give ear to a more
babbling matter: and so great is the gullerie thereof as you must needs laugh
extremely: for besides that his speech his foolish; his discourse from all
purpose; the end evil sorting with the beginning; his gesture unapt; voice
harsh, and actions unseemly: he further makes such childish conclusions, as
the same will make any one that hears them, to cough with laughing. Giacomo
of Pozzuola, is likewise one that illustrateth our modern age with his
fopperies; for when he goes, he seems another lame Aristogiton, when he
speaks a man would think he had a ball in his mouth; when he gestureth, one
would imagine that he deluded Nature, and Art; when he recites any thing,
one would judge by his laughing that he were playing with a feather; and when
he discourses upon any matter, you cannot discern him from the most notable
noddie, and ioult-head in the world. What shall we say of Andreuccio of Marano,
that famous lob-lolly, who reciting a lease wherein ^^s comprehended, that
certain fields were let for two hundred Venetian Liraes, said thus in
Latin. Moneta autem Venetiana valebat ducentis libribus pro affitandis illis
campibus? As also that other foppish Pedante of Saint Arch-angelo, what shall
we say to him, who giving vulgar construction to that Latin beginning of
Cato: Cum ego Cato animaduerterem quam plurimos homines errarein via morum, he
said in the mother tongue to this effect: Althoug I Cato knew very well, that
many men ran rouing over the land of the Moors? Conformable to that other
pedagogicall ass, who expounding that verse of Virgill, Ille ego qui quondam
gracili modulat us auena,
Said, I John Nicolo, who was condemned for the stinking creuices that were
carried to Rauenna. And what say you to that goodly Logician scarce worth three
farthings, who expounding those verses of Peter Hispanus, Barbara, celarent,
Dary, Ferro, Baralipton.
Said, that the barbarous soldiers of king Darius had put on their head pieces,
murmuring exceedingly: and then declaring the meaning of the other; Celantes,
Dabitis, Fapesmo, Frisesomorum,
Expounded, that those murrions or headpeeces, made the Phrigians and Moors
together astonished: then coming to the other, Cesare, Camestres, Festino,
Baroco, Darapti,
He interpreted, that Caesar's men were arrived at Mestra, and that they made
haste to be upon their bones: and last of all lighting upon this verse,
Felapton, Disamis, Datisi, Brocardo, Ferison,
He expounded, that Caesar said to Philip Anthony and the rest of his friends;
stabbe, and thrust me these men through with your swords. Was not this of
Martinello of Villafranca, an apparent cockscombrie, who making the
superscriptio^ of a letter that went to his son in the University at
Bologna, writ thus: To the divine spirit of my son Andrew Scarpaccia, who
frequenteth the lectures of the greatest Physician in all Bologna, who in three
years will become an other Falopia, if God of his grace preserve him living:
with this direction underneath: In Bologna near to asses tower in a woman's
house that lets chambers by the month. These therefore be doltes and
naturals, and for the same cause are recommended to god Fatuello, partaker and
defender with drawn sword of such like people; wherefore having the image of
such a like God upon the door of their cell, it is requisite that with this
invocation following, we reverence and call upon his name.

An invocation to God Fatuello, for lourdish and natural Fools.
MAy it please thee great monarch of naturalles, the true ghost and spirit of
all fantasticks, by the resonance of thy name, conformable to these fools,
with thy genius in like manner to favor this blockish band of naturals, in
all humility having recourse to thee, and by that Temple which thou have in
Valcamonica, where so many lobbes merely depend on thy dominion and empire;
these men beseech thee that though in name thou be but a fool, yet in their
actions do not so show thy self and power: and thus doing before thy image,
they will immolate some famous niddicocke which shall be a true sign, that by
thy grace and favor they are now no longer fools. Now this is the reward
thou shall have if thou be ready and athand with thy succor.

Of vicicious Fools: the twelfth discourse.
THere be in the world certain fools, who together with the deminution of
brain, and loss of wit, retain in them certain vices, which seem
sometimes to proceed from a kind of dexterity in them; but in truth they are
rather derived from the defect of a wit corrupt, and depraved, then any thing
else; in this manner, like mules kicking at every one that comes near them,
through the malignant nature and condition they have: And these kind of men we
thought good to term by the name of vicious fools, for that a fitter or more
conformable word cannot be found out, to impose upon them. Some man
peradventure may think that one Cippius, named by Lucilius, may well be placed
amongst vicious Lucilius.
fools: who indeed in this respect was a fool, for that he suffered others to
use his wife dishonestly: and in this other consideration he was vicious, who
because he would not appear to be a wittall, fained himself then to sleep,
when an other watching in Cupids palestra, wrestled hard with her. He in the
Hospital of Milan seemed no less a vicious fool, who called strangers
Modern examples.
to him saying; that he would show them the valley of Iehosaphat, and by
little and little discovering to them his bare buttockes, he made every one
blush for shame that came near him. Another there was, who requested every one
that he might kiss him, and the man drawing near, either he would break an
vrinall upon his head, bite him with his teeth, or do him some other kind of
mischief. It is recounted of a certain vicious fool, that standing one day
at a window, and seeing a fair young maid in an other right over against him,
as if in an instant he had been enflamed with her love, he said to her,
Signor a lei volete been adio? Lady will itplease you my heat to cool?
Signor no, perch sete un Sier Matthio: No sir, said she, because you seem but
a fool: then he replied; Lasciatemi adungue fare il fatto mio: Let me yet
furbish you with my tool. Of an other vicious fool this pranke is reported;
that one day in the market place he got up upon a butchers stall, and gathering
about him a goodly audience, he began to cry out, that al men might come and
hear him: wherefore the people being assembled together he said; Imagine that
I am the great beast which calls a counsel of the other lesser; for my part
I will go break my fast, go you and hang your selves if you will: and thus
he deluded the people, departing with laughter and scorn to every one. This
man was much like to an other, who at a time of solemn council, about a
treaty of certain public affairs, entered into the counsel chamber, and
cried out aloud: I give my verdite that every one of you be dawcockes. And one
Norandino of Sauignano was not much unlike these, being a most vicious fool,
who at a time, when a great disputation was held in the city of Cesena, near
to that town, and passing by chance through the place where all the disputa^ts
were gathered together, making room amongst them all with a good quarter
staff, he spoke with a loud voice: I hold this conclusion, that Sauignano is
not distant from Cesena above ten miles; and next I maintain this other, that
Sauignano is male, and Cesena is female; as also i will stand to this, that more
people will give ear to me, which am but a Fool, then to you, who would
appear to be wise: And last of all, I will affirm, and prove this other,
that if ever a wiseman went thorough Cesena, I should not be a fool my self.
These of this kind therefore are called vicious fools, and within the
Hospital they enjoy a cell which has hanging without, the image of the
goddess Themis, upon whom, as their protectrix in this under supplication we
will call for help.

A supplication to goddess Themis for vicious Fools.
O Great daughter of heaven and earth, so woonderfully beloved of Jupiter, as
thou art desirous of his love, be not niggardly of thy help to those, who being
fools and vicious, seek at the hands of Themis, the goddess of reasonable
demands, that which is requisite for them to request and sue for: They
demand therefore this just and lawful suit; that of Heaven thy father thou
would obtain wit for their understanding and virtue for their minds, for
if by thy grace and favor they shall be delivered from such a defect; in thy
temple so much honored by the Boetians near the river Celisus, thoushalt see
offered unto thee a Spanish mule, which will be an evident sign of the great
victory and triumph thou shall obtain by such a delivery.

Of malicious and despightfull fools: the thirteenth discourse.
SOme men there be, that inwardly have inserted in the^ such a spirit, as if
they happen at any time to be offended or iniuried by any one, with a foolish
wilfulnes at one instant, they begin to contend with him; and as of the
offenders side, injuries and offenses multiply, so likewise together with
hatred, do continual rancors and despightes increase on their part: so as the
matter comes to this pass, that brutishly thus hammering and boiling in
their minds, they obtain the name of malicious and despightfull fools.
Amongst ancient examples, that peradventure of Cleomedes Astipalensis a man of
mighty strength, named by Plutarke, may well be placed; who being defrauded of
a certain reward Plutarch.
due unto his virtue, entered for this cause into such malice and despite, as
one day he laid his shoulders to a pillar which sustained the common school,
wherein were all the children of the chiefest men of the place, and bearing it
furiously to the ground, he killed the master and all those young youths
together. In the number of these also may that Merganore in the Poet Ariosto be
reckoned, who for the death of his two sons, conceived such mortal hatred
against women-kinde, as look how many women soever came within his circuit,
they were al for this cause rudely scoffed, and hardly entreated by him. For a
malicious and peevish Fool Modern examples.
of late days, a certain literate quoy quanquam, is of all men crowned, or
such a kind of peevish Poul-iobham, that for the biting of a flea, could find
in his heart to kill the whole world, and when he is in his spleen and sir John
Chimneis humor, he fears not all the great ordinance of the Tower; for envy
and despite take away from him all foresight, of the danger and blow that
hangs over the head of his fury. Wherefore, to this our purpose, it is
reported of him, that on a time another calling him, head of a base violl, he
was through this word moved to such choler, that he reached him such a blow,
which missing him, and lighting upon a pillar by, broke all this Fools own
hand and arm; and when he clearly saw the damage which redounded to himself,
entering into greater fury then before, he threw a flinte-stone to have hit him
on the head, which lighting against the wall, and recoyling back, took
himself on the breast, so that raging presently with double fury and madness,
he went to run his head against the other man's belly, who drawing back, he
ran his own head against the wall, and broke it all over: and last of all,
having no otherthing wherewith to show his spleen, he indiscreetly out of his
stomach powers a belch in his face, saying: Go to, take this, seeing I can in
no other sort revenge my self. Christoforo of Crispino was a notable wayward,
and despitefull Fool, who because on a time another said unto him (he being of
rude and homely aspect) you are a welfauoured young man; abhorring this man's
ironicall speech, he threw a cheese at his breast, and because he took up the
cheese and carried it away to eat, he sent after him a knife which he had; but
he taking up the knife also to serve his turn to cut the cheese withal, being
near to a bakers shop, the other took up as much bread as he could in his
hand and threw it at him; the which in like manner he taking up to serve him to
eat his cheese withal, the other would last of all have thrown an empty cup
without wine at him, which was ready at hand: but he saying unto him: nay
gentle brother, but fill it with wine, and then send it after me in gods name.
With these words he grew into such a fury, as running to a fountain near
hand, he would needs have cast it full of water at him: but this man smiling,
and flying away like a treacherous Parthian, or snearing companion, said: I will
have the knife, the bread and the cheese, and let the cup and the water remain
with thee, for we are now share and share like: and thus did he delude the last
blow of this despitefull Fool, who in the end perceived that he was
exceedingly derided for his foolish enterpise. A more famous example of
malicious Folly cannot be produced, then that which divine Ariosto sets
down in perverse and wicked Gabrina, especially in that Stanza, which
begins thus: Hark thou (said she) that art so stout, and fell,
As thou contem'st, and make a scorn of me,
For if thou knew'st what news I could thee tell
Of her, whom dead, thou do bemoane I see:
Then would thou me behold with merry glee,
But rather then I will the same declare,
Thou shall me into mammocks pull and tare.
For the cursed old wretch, with all furious despite, sought to wreake her
self, on miserable Zerbino, not imparting to his lamentable Fortune one only
spark of pity or commiseration, like a devilish and impious witch, as no
question she was. These kind of men are therefore deservedly called,
despitefull, or malicious Fools; and in the Hospital they have a Cell, which
has the goddess Nemesis hanging out for a sign, to whom in this their so
great need, let us have recourse, it being that goddess, who commonly has
care of this kind of Fools.

A petition to goddess Nemesis, for despitefull and malicious Fools.
WIth all zeal possible, and as great vehemency as may be granted unto us,
we implore thy greatest favor and help, O thou sacred goddess, by the
ancients termed Rhamnusia, because in Rhamnunte a city of Asia thy image is
seen, made by the hand of Phidias, having recourse unto thee, because we know
there is no better remedy for these despitefull Fools, then the assistance
and aid of that goddess, who punishing and chastising the wicked and
offenders, is worthily held for the curer of these Fools wounds: wherefore if
we obtain that succor, which from so just a goddess we may well hope for, be
assured that thankful for thy favors, we will offer in the Temple of Adrastus
consecrated to thee, an hand-flasket of skalions and garlic, and all of us
will salute the name of Adrastia, belching forth all despightfull savors,
evident arguments of the recovery procured to these men, in whose behalf, we
direct unto thee this present invocation; heal them therefore, and peace
remain with thee.

Of ridiculous Fools: the fourteenth discourse.
THere be some fools, who day by day perform things so strange, fantastical,
and unusual, that partly for the raritie of them, and partly for their excess
therein, make any one laugh that sees or gives any ear unto them: and
hereupon it is, that all men call them ridiculous fools, having a name
conformable to the actions and deeds they every day perform. Iustine the
Historiographer, among the ridiculous follies of Sardanapalus, sets down
this for one, that he being above measure delighted in womanlike effeminacies,
apparelled himself sometimes in feminine habit, and so intruding amongst the
girls and young wenches, he used the rock and spindell as they did,
performing all those things which women are accustomed to practice. Homers
folly also is recounted among parts ridiculous; for it is reported of him, that
he would miserably have strangled himself for this occasion only, because he
could not dissolve an aenigma or doubtful question, the which by channce was
propounded unto him by certain sailers or mariners. This other of the Poet
Philemon is very excellent, who (as Valerius Maximus declares) seeing an ass
Valerus Maximus.
that eat certain figs, which were set upon the table, laughed so extremely
thereat, as he brust at the mirth he made to himself with this matter. A like
example to this, is that of Margutte in Luigi Pulci, who laughed while he gaped
again, seeing a monkeie to put on his Luigi Pulci.
boots. Lampridius amongst the ridiculous fopperies Lampridius
of Heliogabalus, mentions also this, that sometimes he would be drawn in
a chariot by four naked harlots, other whiles he would visit all the public
stews in Rome, giving rewards to all badde and common women, whom he termed
his fellow soldiers; and an other time apparelling himself like a strumpet, he
discovered himself not to be a Roman Emperor, but some trencher buffon or
parasite, to all the world. But yet that folly of Nero surpasses them all, for
he had a desire to bring forth like women; he made a stallion and bardasso
boie of himself at one instant; and touching Sporus his Ganimed, he entered
into this notable folly, that he would needs see him of a male as he was,
turned into a woman by the Physicians. John Rauisius Textor puts Textor.
one Zenophantus in the number of fools ridiculous, who was of this quality,
that the more he contended to refrain laughing, the more vehemently he brust
out a gigling. Atheneus in the fifth of his Gymnosophistes, while he recites
the follies of mad Antiochus king of Atheneus.
Syria, rehearses likewise these other very ridiculous: that he practiced and
conuersed as well with the basest vulgar sort, as with gentlemen and great
lords; and he carrowsed more willingly with the vilder sort, then with his
barons or knights; wheresoever he knew any assembly of dissolute or vain
young men to be gathered together, thither would he goevnlooked for, carrying
with him his cittern or lute; and thus thrust himself into their company:
Oftentimes also laying aside his Princelike habit, he went with a lantern in
his hand into the market place, taking this and that man by the hand, desiring
them all that they would give him their voices and consents; for sometimes
after the Roman manner, he would be made Edile, and otherwhiles tribune of
the people; often in the presence of noble personages, tumbling and dancing
like some stage fool, to the great abashment of those that were present at
such indignities. Among the ridiculous fools of our time, we may well count a
cockscombe called Pedruccio of Modern examples.
Biagrasso, to be one, who went up and down the streets gathering together all
the horse and cowes dung he could meet withal, and carried it home for
provision saying, that in time of dearth that grut or riffe-raffe would be
good to make an Italian Torto withal, wherewith A meat made of dow and scrapt
cheese, which baked upon a pan looks like marchpane.
to preserve his life, in despite of all usurers. Michelino of Papozza is also
an other ninnie, that makes all the world to laugh at his folly: for in summer
he will put a corselet on his back with some good furred gaberdine over it, and
above all this, a large target after the ancient Roman fashion, affirming,
that he would by no means that the sun pearcing him with his beams,
should make him to sweat. But Santiccio of Ritonda, is a ridiculous and
fower-eared fool, for all the summer he does nothing else but take frogs and
flea them, carrying all the skins of them together to a furrier, to whom he
counts them saying; the Roman Emperors never wore so rare and fine skins
as might be made of these his excellent and dainty ones. All such like men as
these therefore are called ridiculous fools, because they execute follies for
the most part, foppish and ridiculous, and their Cell in the Hospital has
hanging out for a sign, the image of god Risus, adored of the ancients, they
being recommended unto him, as their peculiar godhead and patron: wherefore
with this ridiculous petition following, let us solemnlie for their help and
aid call upon him.

A petition to god Risus for ridiculous Fools.
I Can not but with great gigling and laughter turn my self unto thee, O thou
son of Jupiter, or Bacchus, friend to all Sycophants, constant affectionate
to drunkards, enemy to all molestation, more then to contagion or sickness,
nourished by Venus, brought up by Cupid, and maintained at the charges of
goddess Flora, a brave fellow for thy life, a good companion for thy wit, a
mercenarie advocate for the time, and with old Democritus in behalf of these
men, make unto thy self a loud squeaking laughter, like them, the tinckling
of frying pannes make in Saint Marks place: for if it were not thou that
gave help and nourishment to these ridiculous fools, all the whole
Hospital would be but in a miserable plight; neither would any thing but
sadness and melancholy be discerned over all: but these men by thy favor
doing their endeavor, do yet make their followers merry, and remove from
their minds that disconte^tment, which they receive from humors phreneticall,
delirant, melancholic, and savage, and other such like unto these: wherefore
many men are not a little bound unto thee, in perceiving by thy means, their
hearts exhilarated, and minds replenished with exceeding alacrity, the which
favor and grace if thou continuest, as in these particular sort of fools, we
desire thou should, be sure that in thy temple thou shall hear more
prodigious laughters, then ever were heard at any of Heliogabalus, or Commodus
their banquets: And all this shall be done to please thee, who art the occasion
of all laughter.

Of ostenting and vain glorious Fools: the fifteenth discourse.
THe greatest number of fools that we find, may peradventure be these
whereof at this present we discoursing, make clear and glorious mention of
the same to the world, and by this glorious title or imposition, we term them
vainglorious or oste^ting fools: for they love nothing more, contend earnestly
after no other matter, nor with greater care and anxietie covet or desire any
thing more then the glory of the world, whereof they are so greedy and
desirous, as covetous men of gold, Bears of honey, and bees of flowers; it
being the breakfast, dinner, and dissert of all their operations: and by the
reason of this gross matter they have in their heads, their wits cannot enter
into the sayings of the wise, denounced against them: as that of Aristotle, who
in the books of his secrets to Alexander, says, that Nulla tanta fortitudo
est, vt superbiae pondus Aristotle.
sustinere valeat: there is no fortitude so great which is able to sustain the
weight and burden of pride. This of Aristophanes who was wont to say; Non
oportere in Aristophanes.
ciuitate nutriri leones: Lions should not be nourished in acitie. And that
other of Demades to the Athenians, Demades.
who minding to ascribe to Alexander divine honors, said, Videte quaeso
ciues, ne, dum ad coelum gloriosum istum tollitis, in terram deijciatis: beware
good citizens, least while you go about to extol this glorious man to heaven,
you throw him not down to the earth; but in such sort are they blinded with
this cursed ambition, that even pearceth and sheatheth it self in their hearts,
that they have lost all apprehension of understanding, and what light soever
was therein, running in post haste after the least spark of this glory,
voluble and inconstant as the wind: the words of these men are perfumed, and
odoriferous like ambergris, neither do they loose them from their toongs,
but as a piece of fine sugar, they come sweet from their mouths; all their
gestures are by symmetrie compounded in the garden of the graces; their steps
be measure and proportion it self, like Archimedes his geometrical
instruments, that one may not be longer then an other, nor this shorter fetched
then that; and the carriage of their bodies is like to a peacocke turning
round about and beholding himself: or to a swollen Turkey cock, ruffling all
spread through a yard: the state they observe is like an other Jupiter upon his
golden throne, amidst all the other gods: their motion resembles a wagtailes
going upon the ground, the majesty of their gate, is like to that of a Romagna
goose when she goes through the barn yard; the glearing of their eyes is like
to a cat, when she glicketh her self: their standing still, is like to a
swollen toad, when she lies still beaking upon the earth: his speech makes more
haste then an Ante, when he is better laden then usually: and to conclude, all
his actions are so affected and full of ostentation, that a more strange or
odious thing then these glorious fools cannot be met withal: Among
vainglorious fools the ancient Aruenians are by writers numbered, who as
diverse report, vau^ted themselves to be borne of the Troiane race; and
therefore they called themselves brothers to the Romans, Lucan speaking of
them in his first book: The Aruenians that themselves durst brothers feign
To Latians, that of Troiane race remain.
And like unto these was one Murrhanus, not he that makes oil iarres, but an
other, of whom Virgill speaks in the twelfth of his Aeneides saying:
Murrhanus who with lofty words sets forth Virgill.

The titles of his ancestors great worth.
Among other examples of glorious fools, ancient writers place this of
Misenus Aeneas his trumpetter, who held himself so singular in that
profession, as that he durst challenge the maryne gods or Tritones, to sound
with him: as also those of Martia, who provoked Apollo to the self same
conflict: Thamir is a Thracian, who was so bold as to thrust herself in
amongst the Muses to sing; and together with these that of Araene, who would
needs contend with Minerua for weauing of wool: but last of all that of
Cassiope daughter to Cepheus, who would be preferred before the Nereides: as
likewise Niobe would have been before Latona, Antigona the daughter of
Laomedon, before Juno; and Lychion Deucalions daughter before Diana: and in
truth the tribe of glorious, and many-asses is greater then the rest, because
in all times we have seen trial, that the brain has boiled more on this,
then any other side: what shall we say of that inhumaine Remulus, who
attributing too much unto himself, and over highly pleased in his own valor,
condemned the Trojans besieged in Italy, of effeminacie and cowardice, Virgill
relating these proud words of him: Before them all, most sturdie he and proud
Went thundering out, unworthy words always
Vaunting himself, with clamors, shrill and loud: Cornelius Tacitus.

What may be thought of that Martus, one of the basest crewe of the Boetian
people, who was so bold as to make himself a god? What of Appion the
grammarian, who undoubtedly promised him immortality, to whom he did but
dedicate any of his works? Menecrates the physicion also, was beyond all
measure glorious, who was never wont to take any reward for such patients as
he cured, but requested this only at their hands, that they would call
themselves his humble servants, and term him an other Jupiter: Nestorius the
heretcike was also one of this number, for in an oration that he made to the
people of Constantinople, he soothed himself so greatly, that the next day
following he promised heaven to every one of them: And Rhemnius Palemon the
grammarian or Pedant, is not far different from these, he being wont to
glory, that learning was borne and came into the world with him, as also with
him it was like to perish. But why do I pass over Paulus Samosatenus, who went
through the market places, streets, and highways, vaunting publicly of his
learning, and caused whatsoever came first into his mouth to be set down in
writing by certain registers? As also why do I conceal the Emperor Domitian,
who delighted in nothing more then this, to be called a great Lord, and God?
wherefore Eusebius says, Domitian first commanded that himself should be
called a Lord and God; and a certain flattering Poet made of him these verses:
The Edict of our Lord and God,
Which does alliudgements ratify.
And to what end omit I the Prince Caius Caesar, who made an Edict, that he
might be numbered among the gods, and that Statues should be erected unto him
in the name of the greatest Jupiter? Neither will I forget Themison Cyprian,
who would needs be called Hercules, have incense offered unto him, and be
celebrated with divine praises like unto him. And what shall I further say of
Nero, who greedy of eternal fame, would in any wise have the month of April
called Neronea, and ordained (as Suetonius writes) that the city of Rome
should be called Nerapolis? Alexander Macedon in Suetonius.
this respect may also be recounted amongst glorious Fools for one, he taking
wonderful delight to be termed the son of Jupiter Hammon. Salomoneus made
many fictions of celestial thunder and lightning by mean of Mathematical
discipline, to no other end, but to obtain the title of a god. Varro Pergeus
corrupted by flatterers words was easily persuaded, that himself was the
goodliest man in the world, and that he sung more divinely and sweetly then
the Muses themselves. Hanno the Carthaginian was accustomed to take birds, whom
he taught to pronounce these words, Hanno is a god. Sellus was a certain poor
vain glorious Dolt, who concealed his own poverty, as much as was possible,
extremely desiring for a worldly glory, to be reputed rich. Herostratus a
vain glorious Fool in conceit (by report of Aulus Gellius) burnt all the
Temple of Aulus Gellius.
Diana Ephesian, only to obtain an immortal fame in the world for the same:
and to conclude, Empedocles Agrigentine being a Fool, one degree above all
others, threw himself headlong into the flames of mount Aetna, to the end that
men might undoubtedly think, how he was flowen up into heaven. In our days
also this number of Fools is so augmented, as there is no place so little,
wherein a great company of them may not be seen. Out of all doubt the example
of that vain glorious Tuscane like another Thraso in these our days is
Modern examples.
very rare, who being demanded by certain pleasant companions, why, upon an
occasion he laid not about him, said, the reason was, because he knew himself
to have so heavy and weighty a hand, as wheresoever it lighted, presently it
killed. And that other of Valentino of Castle Saint Pietro is no less
pleasant, who having had a box on the ear given him in the public market
place, by a certain oste, wentbrauing and laughing away, using these words:
This man came upon me with a flat box on the ear, because he durst not strike
me with his fist, for I tell you if he had struck me close fisted, woe had
been to him, for I would have come upon his nose with such another, as should
have sent him to God or the Devil. Now Fools of this order, have their Cell
in the Hospital, which before the gate thereof has set forth the image of
Juno, to whom originally they are recommended, and upon whom in favor of them,
with this subscribed supplication, I do humbly call.

A supplication to goddess Juno, for vainglorious Fools.
O Thou greatest of the Goddesses, Queen of heaven, sister and playfellow to
high Jupiter, amongst all the godheads most glorious, even as the sun is of
greatest glory among the planets, have that care I beseech thee of these vain
glorious, as stands fittest with thy deity: And once again I entreat thee
by these glorious impositions and titles, first of Saturnia, because thou were
the daughter of Saturnus; of Aeria, in that thou rulest over the air; of
goddess Guretis, because thouridest in a chariot with a spear in thy hand; of
Lucina and Lucesia, in that thou give light to him that is borne; of
Socigena, because thou ioinest in matrimony the female with the male; of Fuga,
Populonia, Domiduca, Iterduca, and Vnxia, for that men employed about all such
affairs, are to thee recommended, and under the shadow of thy wings preserved
and defended: Thou art yet further that Opigena, who assistest women great with
child: that Februale, or Februata, which by monthly issue purgest feminine
sex; that Fluonia, who have power to restrain the menstruous blood of women,
while they conceive: wherefore among so many helps adioined to thy power,
assist also these vain fools: be unto them with thy name and power so
propitious; as besides the goodly church which thou have in the Lacinian
promo^torie, by mean whereof thou art called Lacinia; besides the chapel
which thou have in a city of the Argiues called Prosymna, and whereupon they
term thee Prosymnia; and besides the altar which the Hetruscians made unto
thee in the Marquisate of Ancona, through which thou art called Cupra; thou
may also see in this Hospital a temple erected to thy name, by mean of
which thou may also be Hospitalaria, even as thy husband is called Jupiter
Hospitalis, and thus to the titles of Pelasga, goddess Moneta, Castrensis,
Caprotina, Sospita, and Calendaris, thou may add this other of Gloriosa, for
having succored importantly so great a squadron of vainglorious fools, who
vow, for this aid received at thy hands, to erect unto thee a tower higher then
that of Cremona, where tapers may continually be light and burn, to make
manifest to the whole world the glory of Juno, in this one action made more
renowned then in any other precedent, or former operation.

Of parasiticall or scoffing Fools: the sixteenth discourse.
IT is not in a manner convenient, that these whom we call Parasiticall or
counterfeit Fools, should have place in the Hospital of our Incurables, in
that they not being really Foolish in mind, as the others are, have little to
do in this assembly, but it seems that they should rather be placed in the
number of the wise, sage Cato affirming that, Cato.
Stultitiam simulare loco, prudentia summa est.
To play the Fool in time and place is greatest wisdom sure.
And hereupon comes it that so much is attributed to the wisdom of Meson
the Astrologer, who foreseeing the future calamity which was like to light on
his countrymen the Athenians in an expedition they undertook against the
Sicilians, feigned himself to be a Fool, for that he would not be present with
them at so great an overthrow. As also in like manner we read of Ulysses, who
because he would not have gone to the Trojan war, he sowed salt like a
natutall Fool, and yoaking together diverse and sundry beasts to the plowe, he
made all men wonder at his sudden madness, but only Palamedes, who discovered
him by laying his young son amongst the furrows, whom the subtle Greek
prudently shunning, he by this act manifested that he was well in his wits, and
no Fool at all. But because there be some that otherwhiles play the Fools in
jest, with that little folly they have in their heads, it being a manifest
sign of folly, to play the Fool for no purpose at all, to give other men
contentment, by such men I say, we only mean it, when in this our Hospital we
place Parasiticall or counterfeit Fools. And there is no doubt but that
amongst these men, we may well reckon that Gallus Vibius named by Caelius, in
the sixth book of his ancient lectures the five and thirty chapter, who many
times fayning himself to be a Fool, and jesting in this manner, at last he
came to be so in good earnest, growing a starcke natural Fool, to the end
that whereas he scoffed and deluded others, for chastisement of his folly, he
might at last remain derided and flouted himself. In our days one Garbinello
has a notable grace in playing of the fool, who as in representing a poor
Padoan country man, a Magnifico, or some doddipoule Doctor Gratian he has no
fellow; so in this other kind of dissimulation, exceeds he all others, for
whosoever hears or sees him, by actions, gestures, and words, judges him to
be no other then a natural Fool. In this point Pedretto of Moiano one like
the other, showed himself a gallant fellow: for when the Venetian Signiors,
upon important occasions, pressing ordinary galleots or sailors in their
state, would also have commanded this man to go, although he shunned not to
be in the galleies with many others, yet to give some recreation to certain
gentlemen his friends, with whom he had compacted, he appeared one day
apparelled after the sailors fashion with a chain at his leg before the
Captain of these companies, and with an oar in his hand he began a little of
himself to row and sing at the oars as they do, and afterward taking the
whistle in his hand which they use in galleies, he made an excellent call
therewith as could be devised: after this having a sack full of biscuit before
him, he began to distribute it amongst the company, and carried the Captain
a great piece of it, saying how that, and an head of Garlic, made a gossips
feast a ship-boord: and at last taking a Turkish cymitar, and drawing it
amongst the company, he began to cry out allai, allai maumeth russelai, which
imports as much, as God and great Mahumet, and began to flourish therewith
against the wind; sometimes striking here, sometimes there, while at the last
all sweatie, and weary, every one beholding him, he fell down as dead,
wrapping himself in a mariners rug, and calling a notarie to set down his
last will and testament, wherein leaving some thing to every one, he said,
that he bequeathed to the Captain of the company a great lubber and knave to
be buried, and that being a mariner, he would be enterred in no other place,
then in the gallie-pumpe, because that was the most convenient grave for his
knaueship; and while (he dissembling himself to be dead) they would have
carried him away, he leaps me up of a sudden, and said to the Captain: Signior
Captain, I assure you, that among all the sailors you have pressed, there is
not a woorser then my self, wherefore dismiss me at this time (for Gods sake)
if you will not have your galleie to carry the woorst name of any that
belongs to the Signioria; for which cause the Captain smiling, and taking
great pleasure in this conceit, he was for this time content to remit him,
seeing he had counterfeited the Fool so cunningly, and gave him moreover a
mocenigo, or piece of gold So called of ent Mocenigo their Duke, in whose
days they were coined.
about a ducate in value, saying, pray to God that though at this time you
escape the galleies, you light not hereafter upon the gallows. Now these be
Fools, that in the Hospital maintain for ensign before their Cell the image
of Mercury, as the god of all knaves, and crafty iackes like to themselves,
to whom for this consideration, I direct the petition ensuing, instigating him
to the protection of such like people.

A supplication to god Mercury, for parasiticall and counterfeit Fools.
Look what help is to be looked for, from the son of Jupiter and Cyllena,
is expected from thee concerning these Fools, O thou great interpreter of the
gods, because these be properly they that conform themselves so iumpe with thy
genius and humor, as that they seem to all the world thy coosen germans.
These (as thou see) be dissemblers, and thy self the god of deceit, being he
who with such notable cosenage did steal away Apollo his kine, from Argos
their heardsman. But if this suffice not to move thee, why then by the famous
and honorable titles which thou obtainest of Poets, and first of Hermetes,
that is expounder of words, of Camillus that is a servant or nuntio, thou being
highest Jupiter his messenger, of Alipedes, for the wings thou have at thy legs
as the celestial Purseuant of Manigena, for that thou were borne of Maia the
daughter of Athlantes, of Arcades, because thou were brought forth in Arcadia,
of Cyllenius, in that thou were borne on mount Cyllena, of Lygius, Agryphon,
and Nomius; all of them with vehement entreaties beseech thee, to have that
care of them, which to so great a God appertains, and seems but
correspo^dent to so fervent and effectual reco^mendations. And the more to
provoke thee to this charitable enterprise, they set before thy eyes so many of
thy performed honorable actions, as to have been the inuentor of the Harp, of
wrestling, of merchandise, and of Rhetoric; to have first instructed the
Egyptians in good letters; freed Mars out of prison, and bound Prometheus in
mount Caucasus, causing him to be torn into mammocks by vultures: and they
beseech thee by these famous former exploites, that it would please thee to
add thereunto the wise and valiant defense of this kind of fools: The which
if thou shall execute, expect without any delay, before thy image in the Temple
of the Phenicians, the oblation of a Foxes skin, which will be an offering
much conformable both to them and thy self.

Of lunaticall and Fools by season: the seventeenth discourse.
THere are but few that know not these kind of fools by their name only,
whom at this present we term lunaticall or fools by season, who because they
are not continually vexed with this fury but only sometimes, and with
certain intermission, have obtained the imposition or name of lunatickes, they
appeering mutable in this infirmity of their folly like the moon: or rather
because this kind of madness is proper and peculiar to those, that are borne in
the eclipse; or else in that in the waining or increase of the moon, and
according to the diverse alterations of it, this infirmity sometimes greatly
abounds, and otherwhiles also has his force exceedingly abated. Wherefore
Julius Firmicus in the fourth book of his Mathematickes says; Et siluna male
fuerit Iuilio Firmicus
collocata, aut spasticos, aut lunaticos, aut caducos facit: which is, If the
moon be evil placed, either it makes men extatical, lunatic, or subject to
the kings evil. For this kind of argument I may produce the examples of
Nicoletto of Francolino, and Lorenzino of Chioggia, of which the first, upon
the new moon, would enter sometimes into an humor that he was become a
lobster, hunting out all the nearest waters and brooks whereinto to leap: and
an otherwhile, that he was turned into a doade man, putting a couple of tender
horns upon his own head, the better to imitate his form and condition: then
that he was a leeke, or a young garlic blade, and thus ran among the
Herbagers crying out; who will buie fine sallet or herbage: an other time that
he was grown a sausage, or dried flitch of bacon, shunning the larderers more
then the pestilence itself, for fear they should have offered him some
indignity. The other upon the waining of the moon, shed likewise a great
part of his wits or brain; for he would run naked through the market places,
discovering all his privy parts: and other whiles all hampered with a great
wicker basket, he went through the market place, iustling all those he met
withal; but many times altogether distracted, he would lay at men with staves
and stones, and sometimes (being a matter exceedingly worth the laughing at)
he would disple himself upon the naked buttocks, with a neates garbage,
running after the boys, with the filthy and stinking bowels, and casting them
at those that came about him, like a company of birds about a madge-howlet.
Santino of Pietra-mala, was also lunaticke, and being possessed with this
indisposition of the brain, one day upon the full of the moon he played many
fond parts worthy the laughing at, and among others, this one is reported
of; that lighting on a tavern or tippling house, which had a laurel garland
hanging out for a sign, he put the same garlande on his own head, and began
to say that he was a Poet, singing whatsoever came first into his mind, where
a company of people being gathered about him, and perceiving by chance an
harlot whose name was Diana, in the Poetical fury which then took him in the
head, singing he uttered of her these verses: Look on that whipper Digennie I
say
That calls her self Diana,
Ugly, deformed foul, and filthy
Like a rammish goat, an ape or a monckey:
And beholding else where a certain appendant, he sung of him these verses
following: You sir, who teaches young men to be naught,
Shall be for a Corydon taken and thought.
Among these lunatickes we may also put Menegone of Olmo, who thus in the
moons waining, tottering in brain, went up and down the ditches to gather
roots, bringing many times bundels of nettles and wild thistles into the
market place, minding to fell this baggage in steed of wholesome roots;
sometimes he went a fishing for frogs, and filled a trey full of toades, which
he knew not: and otherwhiles also playing the Tinker, he went crying up and
down the country all black as a cole, who has any candle-stickes, dishes,
kettels or pans to mend; neither was he like a tinker in any thing, but only
the smeare, and collow of his beard, with a greasy sack on his shoulder,
which for this purpose he carried about with him. These be therefore those
kind of lunatickes we have hitherto spoken of, who within the Hospital have
hanging out before the door of their Cell for a sign, the goddess Hecate,
whom as their favorite, according to our accustomed manner, we will with this
petition under written salute.

A petition to goddess Hecate, for Fools lunaticall or by season.
BE thou always blessed, and with infinite co^mendations set forth, O thou
gentle daughter of Latona, sister to god Apollo, deservedly termed Hecate,
because thou procurest that the ghoastes and unburied walk abroad an hundredth
years without rest or quiet, through whose power in like sort these poor
fools err in their wits, whom we call lunatike, vouchsafe cheerfully to
power down thy benign influence upon this weak fraternity, which they daily
expect from thee with so great desire, O thou threeforme goddess. Succor I
beseech thee, this thy weak and wavering flock, for when thy help shall
appear so ready at hand, for such dear friends, there shall incontinently in
like manner in three solemn temples which thou have, one in Perga a city of
Pamphilia, another in Ephesus, and the third in Persian Tauris, be erected to
thy honor, as most noble Trophes, three Turkish ancients, with the Ottomans
crest in the midst, which will evidently possess all men of the good thou
have done them, and of the evil which by thy grace and favor, thou have
removed and taken from these.

Of carpet and amorous Fools: the eighteen discourse.
NOw would it be requisite that we had the knowledge and practice together of
as many amorous accidents, as have fallen out both in the old, and this our
present age, that we might describe with convenient solemnity, all the
fopperies of lovers, they being manifest causes of a thousand other follies,
which from this stock as from their beginning, drawing their original and
essence, cause their life not only to appear, but really and in effect to be
the strangest and maddest race, that may be imagined. This folly seems
principally to be rooted, in thoughts, desires, conceits, resolutions, words,
gestures, signs, and actions, all of which linking themselves together, make a
man in cases of love so foolish, that the argument hereof exceeds any other
subject I have before spoken of: with fond thoughts the foolish lover goes
about to make castles in the air of himself, imagining daily, which is the
breefest and speediest mean to accomplish his incontinencies, which howerly
makes him unquiet, troubled, afflicted in mind, and passionate out of
measure. From hence comes it, that he ruminates on treasures, riches,
states, dominions, empires, and power, as the readiest ways whereby to
compass the thing beloved: and with these apprehensions he ioineth a desire
of Craesus wealth, the gold of Media, Caesar's power, and the Emperor Commodus
his means: and hereupon he thinks on incantations, witcheries, drugs, and
all kind of Magic practice, desiring with the stone Gyges to become
invisible, or the herb Eliotropia, to obtain the secrets of Peter of Abano,
or those of Ciecco d'Ascoli, or the other of Antonio di Fantis to know how to
put in practice Salomons keie; and with coniuration to command spirits: of one
side he strives after Alchimy, which enriching him with gold and silver
enough, may by this means possess him likewise of his love; on the other side
he betaketh himself to deceitful Cabalistrie, which by virtue of unknown
names, can dispose of his mistres, to his own mind: and thus expatiating
amidst a thousand imaginations, how to find out baudes, panders, servants,
brokeresses, or some old nurse factoresse, to write letters, conceits,
sonnets, madrigals and songs; to send flowers, nosegaies, newe-yeeres gifts,
presents, and bounties, and to set down by himself in effectual words his
endured amorous servitude, he goes by little and little in this manner,
extenuating his wit, and consuming his judgment and understanding in these
fantasies. Amidst these his foolish desires, he coueteth to be a flea, a fly,
or an ante, that by this means he might enter into the chamber of his beloved:
he conte^deth to mine under the earth as conies do; for the self same effect he
hu^greth after al kind of greatness, beauty, parts, and favor, that above all
the world he may know how to be in her grace, and (which is worst) he would
that both life and death should serve his turn at an instant. In conceit he
frames amorous devises, witty and excellent embleames, sweet and smooth
falling rythmes, sententious censures, artificial sayings, ingenious
stratagemes: and thus hammereth he in his mind both night and day, about
whatsoever he thinks in the end may procure him any assistance; with
resolution he determines to attend the conclusion, and to be firm in his
intentions, resolving with himself no more to endure, nor any longer to suffer
torment and grief; but mark what he says, determines and resolves; for by
and by he affronteth her with words, and courteth her sometimes bitterly,
otherwhiles sweetly, and then in mediocritie: with his gestures he seeks
to move her to compassion, crossing his arms with an high-ho, and if he be
cunning in his motions, and actions, he will make her even ready to kill
herself with compassion: to conclude, his carriage is such, that beasts
themselves are sometimes wiser and more prudent then one of these amorous
fools: for an only example of these amorous Fools Romain Mark Antonie is
set down, who besotted with the love of Cleopatra Queen of Egypt, lost for
her only cause both his empire, life, and honor. That of Pyramid and Thisby
entangled one with an others love, can not be concealed, who one for the other
miserably died: whereupon Strozzapadre in these verses following celebrateth
their Strozzapadre.
death: Of Pyramid and Thesbie, example we may make,
Whom cruel death unto himself, by equal means did take:
And Calentius in his Epigrammes writes of them: Calentius.
Pyramid and Thisbies love, was most unfeigned sure:
For both of them with proper hand, did meek their deaths endure.
The example also of Hercules is most famous, who Iuiled in the affection he
bore to Omphale Queen of the Lidians, he was brought for her love to apparel
himself like a girl, and spin amongst damsels and young maids as a woman:
wherefore in the Poet Propertius he thus debateth with himself: Propertius.
In long side gown, I Lydian webs did spinne:
This servile function following every day,
My breast was covered with a partlet thin:
And with these hands I could the girl well play.
And even so in like manner is that of Theban Hemon, a notable example, who for
love killed himself before the tomb of Antigona, the daughter of Oedipus and
Iocasta: as also that of Sappho, who threw herself headlong from the Leucadian
promontorie for Phaoes sake: whereupon Angelus Politianus in his Elegies
writes of her: Angelus Politianus.
Sappho Virago, who in death did often exclaim,
Of love: both honor, to Leucadian sea and blame:
That of Phedra who hanged her self for love of Hippolitus, Ausonius saying of
her, I have persuaded what I can, try now some other: tell me whom: marry
let Ausonius.
Phedra or Elisa give thee an halter, or a sword: That of Didoe, who cast
her-selfe into the burning flame for Aeneas his love, whereupon Silius Italicus
says, Deep wounded Dido stands upon the burning pile, Silius.

Commanding future Tyrians war to make:
The treacher Trojan he, to mid-seas gets the while,
And spreading sail the shore does now for sake:
And last of all, that of Phillides daughter to Licurgus, king of Thrace, who
hanged her self upon a beam for love of Demophoon son to Theseus, whose
death is by Pamphilus Sassus described in these verses following: Pamphilus
Sassus.
Phillis to me, of death, a noble pattern gives,
Hanged was her body, yet her living fame suruiues.
Was not that folly of Aristoteles very great, who offered incense to a
concubine he had, as to a goddess: as also that of Nero, who married himself
to Sporo a young boy, and Doriphoro his freeman? with that of Periander
Corynthian, who according to Herodotus, lay Herodotus.
with the harlot Melissa, when she was dead? Is not this of Semiramis a
wonderful example of Folly, who according to Caelius in his thirty seventh
book, and Iustine Caelius. Iustine.
in his first, grew foolishly inamoured with a Bull? Of the shepherd Crathis,
who as Volterran affirms, was Volterran.
taken with the love of a shee-goate? This of Aristophanes Ephesian, who
according to Plutarch in his Parallelles, Plutarch.
was besotted with a female ass? Of Fuluius Romanus, who by the same Authors
testimony, exceedingly affected a mare, by whom he had a daughter called
Hippona? Of Cyparisso that fell in love with a Do? Of Pigmalion and Alchiades
Rhodian, who were each of them affected with the love of a dumb Statue? And
last of all, of Serses, who sincerely loved one Platano? Of latter days
Galleazzo Mantuano (as Pontanus reports) being Pontanus.
nuzled in fancy with a Pauian girl, at her commandment, when in jest she
bad him go drown himself, cast himself foolishly into the river Tesinus.
And yet of fresher memory, Tiron Milanese, ouergone with the love of a fish in
a Pond, which he termed il Gobbo, or the bunch-backt, it having been eaten
by certain good fellows, remained many days afflicted out of measure for
this loss; neither could he any ways be comforted, he always thinking that
the death of his fish Gobbo, would likewise draw speedily after it his own
life. These be therefore amorous Fools, recommended to God Cupid his
protection, whom to this end, in their behalf, we affectionately solicit
with this invocation following.

An invocation to god Cupid for amorous Fools.
GOD save thee fair winged child, al hail most gentle son of Venus, live for
ever thou most excellent quiuered Archer, and yet once more Viue, thou
discreet warrior in the Marshall enterprises of Love: All these Fools taken
in thy net, catched with thy bait, and in thy prison captiuated, as humble
subjects of thy dominion and Empire, they with all humble submission entreat
thee, that thou would be touched with their torments, and have that
commiseration of their tribulations and grief, which in so tender and
effeminate a god as thou art, is not only thought requisite, but even proper,
and every way pertinent to thy deity. Remove thy snares, take away thy
hooks, put up thy arrows, lay aside thy bow, and show thy self unto them
naked, and disarmed, to the end they may not be afraid of those weapons,
wherewith sometimes offended, they have sufficiently proved what hurt they
carry with them. The which thing if thou shall vouchsafe to effect, in that
notable Temple thou enioyest in the island of Cyprus, they promise to offer a
great piece of flint-stone, without the steel to strike fire withal, to show
that thy flames be quenched, and that fire smoothered up, which when it
bursteth forth, miserably consumes every ones heart.

Of desperate Fools: the nineteenth discourse.
THere be certain accidents which sometimes happen unto men, through which it
comes to pass, that one being moved by the bitterness of such effects, he
falls into so great desperation, as loosing all sense and understanding, he
gives himself wholly over, as a pray to grief, and so far yields to his
afflicted and tormented mind, as the heaviness of such a mischance foolishly and
fondly urges and inciteth him thereunto: and through this malignant effect, he
obtayneth amongst men the title of a desperate Fool. For this kind of passion
is questionless a plain madness in such like men, who not being able to endure
crosses, hasten after an end of the same, altogether unworthy of one wise,
or that knows how to govern himself. Of this kind of argument, the first
example which comes to my mind, is that of Luctus Sillanus, son in law to
Claudius the Emperor, who for that he was deprived of his wife Octauia she
being given to Nero, was suddenly oppressed with so great anguish of mind,
that the very day of her marriage, the more to make him be envied (as Cornelius
Tacitus affirms) with his own poynard he killed Cornelius Tacitus.
himself. The second example is of Silius Italicus, a famous Poet, of whom
Angelus Politianus recounteth Angelus Politianus.
in his book Nutricia, that being surprised with an incurable disease, he grew
into such a loathing of himself, as that being desperate, he ended his own
days: and these be the verses of him: He died old, and did survive his son:
By his own hand, this cruel deed was done.
In the Roman Chronicles we read of Marcus Portius Latro, who overcome with
the great molestation of a double quartaine, laid himself his own hands on
his back, and willingly gave up the ghoast. We find written in Ovid of
Sardanapalus King of the Assyrians, that being vexed with a grievous war, when
he saw his affairs go quite backward, he threw himself desperately upon a
burning pile of wood, and in that fire most miserably died, and these be Ovid
verses: These bodies dear thou may commit unto the fire, Ovid.

A death which Sardanapalus did desperately desire.
Biondus and Corius make mention of Ezelino the tirant of Padoa, that being
wounded in one of the battles he Biondus. Corius.
fought with Martine Turriano, prince of Mylane, like a mad beast he unbound
and tore open his wound, giving up his life as one desperate, and who as it
seemed was borne only to the damage and ruin of human kind. Caelius
recites this notable folly of one Timantes Cleoneus, by profession a
champion, who not being Caelius.
able through old age, and partly for want of use, to draw a bow, which a
certain young man easily welded, entered upon this into such choler, that being
desperate, with a knife he killed himself. Divine Ariosto in fair Ariosto.
Bradamante, describes an humor much of this kind, yet differing from another
spirit, instantly stripped of all reason and sense, in that Stanza which
begins thus: She saying thus, and eeke prepared to dye,
Leapt out of bed, with fury all enflamed,
Putting her sword, on left side by and by.
With that which follows: In these our days that desperate folly reported
by Cecco of Brisselli, is questionless very ridiculous, who having in the
heat of summer a mighty strong itch, he suffered likewise as great a
disturbance, by a swarm of flies, as in such cases it oftentimes happens, and
so great was the molestation which he received from them, as not being able to
shake them off, of his nose, forehead, or hands, nor from the nape of his neck,
which was all ca^died, like a most desperate man, he one day threw himself into
a tubbe of honey, saying: I hope you will remain here catched and taken by
the heels, and afterward leaving the tubbe, he might perceive those
shameless creatures, to be clotted all of a cluster within the barrel to his
singular contentment. But now on the other side list a while: for at the smell
of the honey, there came a most irksome swarm of bees and waspes, by whose
buzzing and stinging he being sore vexed, entered into such a rage by this
second assault, as apparrelling himself from hand to foot, like to a man
co^pleate armed with his beuer down, he went and sat in the sun, saying:
now hum and bum, as long as you will, for in despite of flies, and all the
bees and waspes in the world, I will keep this my scalde itch to my self:
but an infinite army of these creatures fluttering about him, at the only
odor and smell of his corruption, in the end, not being able to behold
himself thus besieged, he grew desperate, and cast himself into a caldron of
hot scalding lee, saying; and you love honey so well, as it seems you do,
come hither a gods name and fasten upon me. This sort therefore before spoken
of, be desperate fools, who have within the Hospital for an ensign the
picture of the goddess Venilia, wherefore as their protectresse let us with
dew prayers and entreatie, solicit her in their behalf.

A supplication to goddess Venilia for desperate Fools.
O Thou which replenishest men's minds with hope, comfortest with sage
meditation the disconsolate, restorest wearied spirits to true and unfeigned
alacrity, and therefore by all the afflicted art sedulously called upon,
while others thus groan under their burden, and that thou see the terrible
extremities and heart burnings of these fools, procure that thy merciful heart
may be touched with such commiseration, as that thou causing thy self to be
known for goddess Venilia, mother and guardian of the desperate, these men
may thus by thy favor, be as it were raised from death to life; for when they
shall perceive their wandering and lost spirits recovered, together with their
dried up blood, and color wan revived, they shall in a pleasant bond and
duty, be obliged to fasten up in thy temple a hangmans collar, with an old
rotten halter, as a true sign, that by thy favor they have escaped death, and
that from desperate estate, they are reduced to an assured hope of future life.

Of heteroclite, reuerse, thwart, and headstrong Fools: the twentieth discourse.
THere be certain fantastical men in the world, who by no means can be
persuaded, either to equity, honesty, or truth: observing in their
operations, neither rule, order, or mediocritie, but are of a spirit cross and
reuerse, not yielding to duty, consenting to right, nor comfortable to so much
as very reason would require; but are altogether out of the way, and beyond
measure far wide of the true path: which humors are continually termed by
the name of heteroclite, reuerse, thwart, and headstro^g fools. Of this humor
that Perseus subdued by Paulus Aemilius showed himself: for two of his
domestical and familiar acquaintance, being desirous friendly to comfort him
after his loss, he entered upon this into such an ecstasy, that like a beast as
he was, against all the reason in the world, he commanded that in his
presence they should presently be slain. Atheneus reports of Atheneus.
Eurilochus the Philosopher, who was an auditour of Pirrhus Eliensis, that he
was a right headstrong fool indeed, for upon a small occasion he would
sometimes grow into such choler, as that he pursued once a cook of his that
fled before him even into the market place, running after him with the broch,
and roasted meat upon it all piping hot. Diverse setdowne this wonderful
matter of Commodus the Emperor, that finding once the bath luke warm wherein
he meant to wash himself, in a mighty rage, he caused the stoue master to be
cast into an hot burning furnace, to the end that while he was in this tepide,
or luke warm bath, the other might quite contrary feel that excessive heat,
which his despightfull fury imposed upon him. Sansouino writes of Mahumet
Sansouino.
Ottoman, that going through a garden, and by chance perceiving two fair
cucumbers that had been plucked up, laying this fault upon two goodly young
men of excellent presence and form (who^ notwithstanding he used as ganimedes)
although they denied the fact, yet did he cruelly at the same instant cause
them both to be slain. Philagrus the sophister, one of Lullianus his auditors,
was also of so heteroclite and perverse an enclination, that if his disciples
chanced but sometimes of mere necessity to fall a sleep in the school, he
no ways bearing with their imbecilitie, would lay his fistes upon their
faces, spurning hard against their bellies, without having any compassion in
the world, even to nature it self in this point. It is an evident matter
which Biondus writes of Vedius Pollio, who was an Biondus.
headstrong fool, in all he went about, for those seruitors which at the table
had by chance but broken one of the least glasses there were, he would
suddenly as a man even mad with fury, command them to be slain, and given
to certain murenaes to feed upon, which he kept in a wonderful great
fishponde that he had. Cherophon Athenian, a philosopher little known, was so
notable a fool in this kind, that in talking of an exquisite fool, this
proverb is used by Paulus Manutius: Paulus Manutius.
In Palladis vestigijs nihil Cherefontis gubernabis: In Palace her footesteps
Cherefon can hardly tread. The only, example of this gog-furie is read in
Corius, of Corius.
Barnabo the Visconte, who caused a poor baker to be slain, only, for that
passing by a castle where he dwelt, he waked him sometimes in the night, in
calling in with his bread: As also that other is very well known to the world,
which he performed to two of the Popes legates, whom he commanded to eat the
letters they had about them, to bring unto him, only for a despite to that
highest prelate, with whom he was then in enmity, touching matter of state:
Neither can I omit the other which he performed to that parish priest (which
for his avarice deserved notwithstanding great chastisement) who unwilling to
bury a poor woman's husband for nothing, he made him together with the dead
carkase to enter into the grave, that he might pay by this means for the
public iniquity he had in thus doing committed. So that heteroclite,
reuerse, thwart, and head strong fools be such as we have described them
unto you, and these have hanging before their Cell within the Hospital, the
image of halting Vulcane, limping with his legs, as they do in their
understanding, wherefore to a god correspondent to themselves, in this petition
following, we very commodiously recommend them.

A petition to god Vulcane for heteroclite, reuerse, thwart, and headstrong
Fools.
WE beseech thee O thou great celestial blacksmith, minister of the great fire
in mount Aetna, called Mulciber, because thou make iron tractable and
malleable: Vulcan for that thou make thy flames ascend speedily upward:
Cyllopodius, in that falling from heaven, by a disgrace thou becamest lame:
Lemnius, because being cast out of heaven by thy mother, thou did light in
Lemnos, where by Eurymenes and Thet is thou were nourished, or else
peradventure by apes, as thou thy self know well; by that pity therefore
which then was taken of thy disaster, charitablie also assist these thy cosen
germans, not lame in their legs, but in their understanding, as thou see,
and as thou did temper Jove's thunderbolts, and knit the net for the taking
of Venus and Mars: as thou made Hermions carcanet; Ariadnes crown; and the
wagon of Sol; or as by thy hands in the Cyclopians forge, the arms of
Achilles and Aeneas were tempred; even as likewise were Mambrinoes helmet,
Orlandoes Durindana, Rinaldos Fusberta, the enchaunted arms of Mandricard and
Argiliaes armor: even so settle the brains of these men after such a sort, as
that in triumph they may have cause to hang up in thy shop a mighty huge
dumpling of the Lumbard-size, which may serve in stead of a sign, of these
men's brains thus resetled, and by thy means reduced to their right use and
temper.

Of scoffing Fools: the one and twentieth discourse.
TAles, bables, fables, I will not say wittily, but scoffingly related together
with correspondent actions, gestures, and operations to the same, constitute
those kind of men, whom we here call scoffing or jesting Fools, whose intent
is no other, but to recreat and make merry the world, they retayning in their
heads a disposition more then Iouiale, from whence inventions flow abundantly,
and a thousand odd prancks they every day perform in presence of the
multitude: as that Clisophus parasite to Philip K. of Macedonia, of who^
Lynceus Linceus Samius
Samius makes mention in his commentaries, who perceiving that his master by
chance had broken one of his legs, began likewise to go limping like him, and
scoffingly wreathed his eyes, mouth and teeth, in eating any sharp sauces,
imitating diligently and like an Ape, his Lord and master in every thing. Of
Clarisophus also Dyonisius the Tyrant his iester, we find thus much written in
Hegesander, that whenever he saw his Hegesander.
master laugh a part with any nobleman or Baron, he would also giggle soundly
himself: so that one day Dyonisius observing this Sycophant, he asked him why
he so laughed, to who^ the Gnato answered, I laugh for this cause: In that I
imagine those matters which pass betwixt you deserve no less, considering you
your selves so laugh at them, as you do. But above al M. Varro, and Galba make

mention of a certain base Tarentine scoffer, called Rhintone, who was another
Cesco of our days, for in all matters, how weighty or serious soever they
were, he had ever a scoff ready at the fingers end, which peradventure might
well be mother or sister unto him: as also in this point, Sosicrates in his
first book of the Cretane affairs, Sosicrates.
attributes to the Phestians as a peculiar property, that they were scoffers,
for from their childhood, they studied quick and stinging sayings, for the
sharpning of their wits, which by such applications are greatly whetned. In
ancient times, Mandiogenies and Strato Athenian, were famour Buffons, as
Hippolochus Macedon in an epistle which he writ to Linceus testifies, and
Hippolochus.
so was Callimidon, Locusta, Dinia, and Menedemus, to whom Telefanes in his
book of Cities says, that Telefanes.

are magnified. These be they that sweep the courts of Princes and great men,
who for the most part are greatly delighted with these kind of Fools, as
sometimes Philip of Macedonia, who took in them such contentment, that as
Atheneus writes in the fourteenth of his Atheneus.
Gymnosophistes he sent a talent of gold to certain parasites, which before we
named, for their jests and sayings: Demetrius Poliorceta, as Philarcus writes
in the sixth Philarcus.
book of his Histories, was also so great a friend to scoffers, as that he
could never have them an hour from his heels. The like Herodotus writes of
Amasina king Herodotus.
of Egypt, who desired more the company of iesters and Buffons, then of those
prudent and wise. But yet it is much, that Nicostratus ascribes this very
genius or Nicostratus.
humor to Roman Scilla, who otherwise was so grave and strickt in all his
proceedings. Of late days, one Gonella was a notable Buffon, as likewise
Carafalla; and yet of later memory Boccofresca the Padoan, who I am persuaded
had never his equal for Buffonerie, much less any superior: and he was so
much the more an ingenious scoffer, by how much he would never once smile
himself, though he made all the rest of the company almost burst with
laughing: for he was not like the Tirinthians, so celebrated by Theophrastus,
who being natural Buffons borne, had on a time general recourse to the Oracle
of Delphos, to know whether there were any means, for the recovery of this
kind of Folly; to whom the Oracle made answer, that I, there was: so they
could sacrifice a Bull to Neptune god of the sea without laughing, the which
thing not being able to execute, they remained in the same state of Buffonerie,
as at the first. Yet scoffers and iesters are good in this one point, for they
make men merry, and expel melancholy from the heart, neither do they eat
their bread in treachery, as flatterers do, from whom proceeds nothing but
shame, and detriment together. Now these Fools have before their cell in the
Hospital, an image of god Fabulanus erected as their friend and favorer:
wherefore let it seem no marvel, though to him, who is protector of these
frivolous chatterers, in this invocation following, we duly and fitly reco^mend
them.

A prayer to god Fabulanus, for scoffing Fools.
THese men O God Fabulanus be true gnathoes, friends and affecters by life of
thy name: for they neither think nor speak of any thing but fables and tales,
which spring from thee, and inserted in them, take so deep root as that they
show themselves to be the children and true offspring of God Fabulanus: and for
this cause thy glorious godhead must needs have a care of thy dear friends,
that are conversant with the kings and princes of the world, holding them in
so tender esteem, as that it may be known, how without thy assistance, they
could utter nothing sauorie or gracious in any sort: Vouchsafe them therefore
requisite protection, and so effect, that they may be stirred up to offer at
thy altar, which thou have amongst the Tirinthians, the tales of Piouan
Arlotto, printed in parchment with text letters, to the end the gift and
present which they offer, may aptly correspond with thee their courteous and
bountiful benefactour.

Of Iouiall, recreatiue, facete, and friendly Fools: the two and twentieth
discourse.
THese sorts may be discerned from mere parasites or buffones in this point:
for buffones at all times without rule, mediocritie, or discretion, are ready
to utter and perform all kind of licentious scurrilitie, but these facete
companions, are not so extreme in their speech nor performance, observing
further a decorum and decency in all their proceedings, their mirth also being
far more moderate then that of buffones, which surely is altogether scurrile
and dissolute: These sort of men are for the most part stored with excellent
pleasant quips, notable tales, recreatiue speeches, merry proverbs, and
conceited inventions, manifesting even in their very exterior countenances
toward all men, a certain domestical, friendly, sweet, affable, and
tractable disposition. Marcus Tullius in an Epistle to his brother Quintus,
declares Sextus Nemus to be such an one; and in his second de Legibus, he
sets down the old Poet Aristophanes for one of facete dexterity. So
Horatius in the first of his sermons, attributes to Lucilius this iocund
alacrity of spirit saying, Lucilius was both wise and civil sure,
And excellent, the grief of mind to cure:
In these our modern times, Piouan Arlotto was reputed for a wonderful
facete companion, whose sentences and sayings put in print, show the value of
his wit in this kind of folly. There want not at this day in Rome, and the
courts of great princes, diverse fools of this sort: for more courtiers are
conversant in this study, then in any other; it being a very convenient
means, whereby to obtain the favor of princes, great ladies, and
gentlewomen, who are sooner many times woone with some cheerful and pleasant
report, then with the long service those poor souls emploie about them, for
after due examination of their own errors, they oftentimes sing: O passions
lost with thoughts both light and frail. And an example of this may be
observed in one master Bernardine of Beneuento, who serving in the court of a
great Italian prince, obtained one day the favor of a most beautiful lady,
only for this gentle and witty retortion: for she saying that it was very hot
about his lodging; he wittily answered by way of admiration: How can that be
fair lady, when from Beneuento (which signifies in Italian good wind) there
can not come but fresh and fine cooles! An other courtier called master Andrew
of Pomerano, while he served in the court of Frauncis the first king of
France, with an excellent sudden invention, got himself the favor of his
lord in an instant, for they being doubtful in the court, on what side
Charles the fifth would assail the kingdom of France, and some saying about
Marcelles, others in Nauarra, and a third sort in Prouence, one saying in one
place, an other in an other; this man in presence of many, the king himself
hearing it, said, how above all other places it was requisite to fortify
Lingua d'occa, for Languedocke as the French term it, signifying in the
Italian a goose tongue, because it was likely the ravenous eagle (for the eagle
is the crest of the Empire) would sooner light there then any where else. And
of master Nicholo d'Oruietto this other is mentioned, that serving in the
court of Pope Leo, a most courteous prince, on a day, in four words only, he
got his holiness favor for ever; for while on a time they were talking of a
benefice vacant (this word sounding near Vacca in the Latin for a cow) it
being sued for by one of the house of Vitelli (this coming near Vitulus in
the same tongue for a he-calf, on who^ it might have been bestowed) he wittily
said: Holy father, all reason would that it should in any sort be given to
Vitello, because she has no nearer kindred then himself, playing upon the
word Vacant, which comes near Vacca, signifying a cow, which is mother to
the calfe. Now iocund fools of this sort, have a cell within the Hospital,
which has hanging out the picture of god Bacchus, particular patron of such
like fools: wherefore as one to them most friendly, let us cheerfully with
this under written petition salute him.

A petition to god Bacchus for Iouiall, recreatiue, facete, and pleasant Fools.
GOod day, and good year God send thee O father Liber, all the mirth of the
world be with thee my dear and honey god; if thou will be carroused unto in
Muscadell orbastard, O sweet Lyaeus, then preserve and maintain this pleasant
fraternity or college consecrated to thee: Behold how they expect from thee
that iocunditie wherewith the Bachides were surprised, being inamoured with
thee, when so willingly they followed thee to the fortunate enterprises of the
Indies; from which victory returning, thou were the first that in nauale
triumph (by thee invented) did wear a kingly diadem, sitting upon the back
of an Indian elephant; if therefore thou hold thy self their friend, as
hitherto ever thou have done, according to the natural inclination which
bends thee toward them, they will be content not only to call thee
Bimatris, for having had miraculouslie two mothers in the world, Semele, and
Jove, Saturmiter, having been first in her belly, and then in this gods
groine: to name thee Nyseus of Nisa Grotta, Anio of Aonia, Thiontis of Thione,
Nictalius because thou art worshipped and honored in the night, Mitrophorus,
for wearing a myter on thy head; Orcus, so called of an hill whereon thou art
sacrificed unto, Bassareus of the long robe thou wearest down to the heel,
Dithirambus, Leneus, Briseus, Osyris, and Bromius: But they will further
attribute unto thee the Greek name of Eutropelus, because thou art a favorite
to pleasante, facete, and recreatiue fools: and besides the Thirsus or writhed
iaueline with iuie, which thou bear in thy hand, they will join unto it a
carrowsing glass of Romagnia, with which thou may pledge, and do reason
unto men, when by so good fellows as they are, thou art sought unto.

Of testie and fustian Fools: the three and twentieth discourse.
TEstines and fury, be fond effects that proceed from certain fantastical
humors in their heads, whom we commonly call testie and fustian fools: and
because this whole matter is nourished by choler, and human inconstancy, it
consists in nothing else but in sundry cogitations and actions, resolving it
self in the end into a toie and humor, according as with such a passion it
seems well befitting: and of such like disposition be all those that are
prompt to anger, and then as easy to be pacified, wherefore the Poet Horace
manifests himself a testie fool, when he says; Irasci facilem, tantum vt
placabilis essem; ready to be angry, only that I might as soon be pleased:
And Ausonius the Poet, was also a froward fool, by his own Ausonius.
witness, he uttering these verses following of himself: I sought my sudden
anger for to hide,
And for my fury pain I did abide:
For this purpose Corthidis king of Thrace (if Caelius do not fable) knowing
his own testie and froward nature, Caelius.
and how violent and headstrong himself was, one day when certain excellent
well wrought cups or glasses were given him, he therefore esteeming greatly of
them, yet considering they were but brittle, though precious, in deep
judgment he broke them all: for if by chance they should have been broken
by any of his followers or servants, it could not have been otherwise
possible, but that in his great rage and fury, he would bitterly have
revenged himself on them for the same. Of such a nature Rhodomont in divine
Ariosto is set out to be, for as one furious and fell, he spoke evil in
general of all women kind, when fair Doralice gave sentence against him; and
yet afterward at the sight only of Isabella, it seemed that he recanted,
acknowledging no higher bliss, then her grace and favor. In these our days
one Claudius of Salo, discovered himself to be very humorous and testie, who
having an house in the country, which came to him by inheritance from his
father, he determined on a time to reduce it all into form of a douehouse; not
many days after being of another humor, that he would have it a castle,
building it in such like form, with ditches and rampires round about in manner
of a fortress; and presently it being finished, he changed humor again, and
caused it to be plucked down even to the very foundations, planting in the
very same place, a pretty young set of Orange Trees; which being come to a
reasonable growth, in a caprichious toy, he also procured them all on a day to
be rooted up, saying, it were much better to have it a field of Coleworts; and
thus in the end his house came to be a garden of Cabages. The fantastical
humor of one Zanfardino in our time is also most notable, who being called to
a dignity, at such time when Cuckoes were esteemed for Parrats (although at
this present also, we may observe some master like discipline to proceed from
his successors) being in his kingdom installed, he began to sell herds of
cattle and buy geese, supplanting his gardens, and making them greenes for
these creatures to grase upon; alleging for a reason of this his wayward
fantasticality, that from geese came feathers, wherewith to make boulsters and
beds, whereof he then had greater need then of flesh, fruits or cheese. There
is another by the common multitude called Scarinzo, who of no less a peevish
inco^stancie then the rest, cut up a goodly and commodious set of vines, only
to make a vain prospectiue, for his own foolish contentment; and when he had
nothing to do, he would pluck down an Aiaxe, and make a fishpond in the
place; supplant an orchard to make a fair walking green, or else deface some
goodly cloister or gallery to make room for tame conies. But above al perverse
humors, that of Piacentino is most famous, who cast good pistolets or duckates
into the water, to make duckes and drakes with them, as children use to do: and
so great was the foppery which transported him, as he perceived not the damage
he received by the eluish arrogancy of his own brain. And niddicocke upon
cockscombe was that other Cremonese, who putting on the Toga Pratexta, or long
robe of a doctor, hearing one day a drum that played but badly upon this
instrument, he steps me down from his chair of dignity, and taking the drum
in his hand, brased it hard, and in succinct and grave habit, went sounding of
it into the market place, drawing after him all the whole Fry of boys, every
one gazing at him with so great laughter at his folly, that all men were ready
therewith to brust. And yet this other performed by one surnamed Moscouita, was
far more solemn and famous, who being to make a funeral Oration to the
communaltie of Bracciano, upon the death of a certain Doctor, skipping up in
all haste into the pulpit, and being complete armed, putting his spear in his
rest, with a thundering voice he uttered these words: Whosoever dare be so
bold, to affirm that this Doctor died well, or that the destenies with any
reason cut off the thread of his life, I challenge him to fight with me, and
with my lance in my hand, in this pulpit I will die upon him. For
entertainment of the vulgar sort, I will only declare unto you this other;
that there was one Nicolo of Mount Frustone, who was with so great and perverse
peeuishnes replenished, as that being one day upon the banck side of Poe, he
loosed one of those water mils that stand fast chained together upon the river
while the miller was out of the way, and the mill making fair and good way, he
followed it in aboate of Stellata, as far as Francolino, where he did drive it
a shore all broken and defaced: and here he took order, that there should be
a great ditch made to bury it in, waging twelve old beadswomen that should
mourn for it, as they do for the dead, and utter these words: O poor mill
mine, buried here at Francoline, what did thou to good Nicolo, that he thus
loosd, and let thee go? We will ever lament, and wayle, for of our meal we
shall now fail; out alas and well away, more bread then wit is at this day.
All these therefore betestie and fustian Fools, and have within the Hospital
for a sign before their Cell a Tesiphon, because she is the goddess of their
humors, wherefore with this subscribed petition, we will bow our selves to
call upon her for their aid.

A petition to Tesiphon, for testie and fustian Fools.
THou direful in heaven, furious upon earth, Eumenides in hell, great daughter
of night, and Acheron, remove a little thy fustian fumes from these men,
because many times they are ouer-peeuish and headstrong: even as thou will,
that at thy Temple thou have in Athens, there may by them be offered unto thee
a couple of Westminster pigeons, mild and pleasant, which have a thousand
times heretofore been vowed to thy service, to manifest unto the world that
glorious and peevish humorists allured by thy favor, as with a bait, from
evil, may sometimes become as gentle as lambs.

Of outrageous, fell, and Bedlem Fools: the four and twentieth discourse.
AMongst the whole race of Fools, there are not any more insupportable, then
those whom we call Fell, and outrageous Fools, for the quality of their
humor is so wild and untamed, as it is requisite to avoid them, no otherwise
then we would shun the fury of cruel and ravenous beasts. Neither are they
mad and furious only toward others, endammaging them with the fury they are
possessed withal, but this rage turns also upon themselves, transporting
away their minds to all kind of evil, that may be imagined. Ancient Hercules
is painted with this kind of fury set forth, who after he had put on Nessus
the Centaures coat, through impatience of grief, threw himself into the
flames of Mount Oeta: whereupon Claudian says: Claudianus.
Thou fliest the top of Oetes, flaming all on fire:
And Ovid in the thirteenth of his Metamorphosis brings Ovid.
in Ajax the son of Telamon, ravished with this fury, for the sentence the
Graecians gave, that the arms of Achilles should rather be given to Ulysses
then him. Even so does Ariosto describe very rarely the foolish Ariosto.
fury of Orlando, in two particular stanzas, in the first of which he says:
Writings I cut, and stone making to fly
There shiuers: up unto the azurd sky:
And in the other he says: I cast into the water, shrubs, bows, stones,
clods, and trees:
Making it (clear before) as foul as any lees:
And this is the cause why in an other place he describes, that when
Astolphus would have healed him: he bound him with many ropes, like a Bedlem
Fool, as now he was become. Athamas the son of Aeolus is described for so
bestiall and furious by the Poet Ovid, as in his outrageous humor he killed
his own son named Learcus, and these be Ouids verses in the sixth de fastis:
From hence it grew that Athamas, so cruel did remain:
And that by fathers hand, Learcus was so slain.
Herodotus reports this of Cambyses, that having violated Herodotus.
the god of the Egyptians called Apis, he was after this fact converted into
so great fury and madness, that thorough the very hellish furies stirred up, he
first slew al his whole family, converting afterward foolishly his fury, and
killing himself. Propertius also in his third book places Alcmeon the son
of Amphiareus and Euriphile, Propertius.
amongst mad and outrageous fools, who for killing of his mother, was by a
strong imagination led and induced into this kind of folly, wherefore he
says of him, Alcmeons fury or the fastes of Phineus:
Lucanus in his first book, mentions one Pentheus among the Fools of this
kind, who for having contemned Lucanus.
Bacchus his divinity, was by that god chastised, in making him become
foolishly furious like a beast, whereupon he says: In mind no greater rage,
or fury ever had,
Agaue or Pentheus, when they were wood and mad.
Of Orestes the son of Agamemnon, and Clytemnestra, Caelius
Caelius writes, that after he grew mad for the killing of his mother, he
rent all the garments off his own back, and bitte off one of his fingers; so
that in Paulus Manutius a proverb did arise, Oresti pallium Paulus Manutius.
texere: to weaue Orestes his cloak, speaking of one who makes present use of
a thing, that in the end is by him spoiled and abused. A certain soldier of
Brisighella, was in these our days a notable outrageous fool, who growing into
fury for love of a Fauentine curtezane, devoured a whole gauntlet and
breast plate at a time, so mightily did this caprichious humor fume up into his
brain, as that he could not discern his own defensive arms from bread to
eat. And like to him was Camble king of Lydians, who (if Caelius say truth)
provoked by a ravenous fury, eat up his wife one night as she lay by him, and
finding in the morning one of her hands in his mouth, he became foolishly
mad, even as a beast that must be fast tied and bound. I think not the
example of Santin of Villa Franca to be the coldest, and most threadbare one
of all the rest, who falling into fury, about a cow and an ox he had which
died, went to a stable of one of his neighbors, where there was an ass, and a
sow with many pigges, where, by this madness provoked, he killed them all, and
eat half the ass, before he so much as once drunk. An other called
Marchion, of Buffaloura in the territory of Millaine, being sacristan to a
certain vicar about Varese, he also through misfortune entered into these
brutish humors, by reason of a few fetches that were stolen from him by a
coosening knave, wherefore growing by and by cock a whoope in his brain, he
ran presently into the steeple, and eat an whole clapper of a bell, to the
great solace, though loss of that communaltie, when they knew of it. But yet
Peter Antonio of the valley of Taro, a gardner by profession, performed
somewhat a more solemn beastialitie; for having had certain fruit of his
spoiled in the night (as so it chanced) he fell heerewith into so wonderful
an amazement and furious ecstasy with all, that with his teeth he tore and
devoured aspade, shouell, and dung-cart, not being able to mitigate this
violent humor, which besides all reason did drive him to madness. Like unto
this man was Dominicon of Guastalla, who by a mischance in a morning had a
bed of young beans killed and spoiled, and for so small a matter he grew
into that fury and spleen, as disposed upon this no more to plough, he eat
up his fodder stacke, plough, and oxen, in less then five days. Let it
therefore suffice, that such like men be called outrageous, brutish, and
Bedlem fools, and within the Hospital they have god Mars hanging out for a
sign, because by him they are vpheld in those fantastical humors that
possess their heads: Therefore let us have recourse unto him, as to that god
which kindles the fire of theirfurie, to the end that blowing it as little as
may be, they may of such folly be healed, and recover their former estate.

A supplication to god Mars for outrageous, brutish, and bedlem Fools.
TO thee eldest son of Jupiter and Juno, called sometimes Mars, sometimes
Mamers, and otherwhiles Mauors, because thou reuoluest and turnest topsie
turuey great matters, now Mars the revenger, Grandeuan god, dear brother in
law to Bellona, I now come to offer unto thee the recommendation of these
outrageous and brutish fools, who daily grow in foolish humors, to the end
that withdrawing from them thy terrible influence, they may gently like lambs
suffer themselves to be tied, even as thou thy self were sweetly bound fast
with Venus in Vulcanes net. If therefore beside the songs and hymns of the
priests Salij, thou desire to hear a still pipe sounding in thy Temple: and
over and above the carpe and pike fishes, that were anciently consecrated to
thee, thou be willing farther to see offered the pawe of a great beast, yield
some hope of recovery to these poor miserable wretches, who will not fail to
offer unto thee fully as much, as has hitherto been vowed and promised.

Of gross and three elbowed Fools: the five and twentieth discourse.
IT is an use and custom, to name certain men in the world, by the title of
gross and three elbowed fools, when such an extreme iocunditie takes place
in them, or rather a kind of leuity and unusual boldness, which inciteth them
to speak and perform some follies, not altogether unlike the disposition they
are of: and these are for the most part a vain kind of people, which draw
very near to buffones, or scoffers, they uttering iestes that procure
laughter, and playing their prankes out of all season, as those who
notwithstanding it be lent, yet make it still Shrouetide; and as well in badde
as good times, retain still their humors of follies, not respecting (as
before I said) neither time, place, persons, nor a thousand other necessary
circumstances. The ancient example of Damasippus Athenian, celebrated by
Caelius, Caelius.
gives evident knowledge and testimony of a gross and three elbowed fool:
for of so pleasant a mould he was, that being ever in his merry pranks, he had
always a route about him, like a Christmas fool, and partly with his apish
gestures, and monkeie girnes, and partly with his scoffs, jests, and other
fopperies, he entertained the multitude many hours, playing the knave
sometimes out of all cry with those that crossed and plucked him by the beard,
with answerable crackroperie. It may be said, that Antonella of Rubia was also
in the number of these three elbowed fools, for he was continually set upon so
merry a pin, as it seemed he had some fly, or familiar that stirred up in
him these comical and triuiall merriments: And amongst others, as he was in
presence of a lord of great quality, falling into his woonted rye, he
performed so many merry tricks, counterfeited so well some fools of his
country, and struck so notably into all kind of rogerie, as it wanted
little, that this great lord had not been overcome with laughing at them. He
which was called the Emperor of Bologna, (although he be not so well known to
every one) yet was he also well stuffed with such like matter; and amongst many
others, there is one most wonderful, reported by those that knew him, which
is this; that being Vicar one day to a certain President, who had left him
charge, to publish in his own absence certain proclamations, which were
flatly against public liberty and his own, and for this cause were odious to
every one, like a gross headed fool as he was, he yet played the crier
himself, and after the publication of them, he said, that the President had
good days himself, and he had thus far obeyed his command in publishing
them, and they that would might likewise observe them; as for himself he meant
to keep no circumstance thereof, and thus with exceeding laughter he left them
all, perceiving the good affection that he himself bore to those
proclamations: The other called by the vulgar Mascella d'Asino, was also one of
this tribe, for being seruitor to a very rich Spanish knight, who one day
threatened that he would take off his head (using badly the Italian word
capezza, which signifies an halter or head-straine) and he faining not to
understand it (though he had it presently at his fingers ends) went into the
stable where there were ten or twelve horse head-straines, and bringing them
all to his master, he said, that his noble Signorie might take which of them
he would, so it would please him to forbear that with which his trusse was
tied up; so that the Spaniard was feign to laugh at this fellows mad conceit,
and thus passing over his choler, he received him to former grace. They
therefore like unto these above mentioned, are called gross and three elbowed
fools, and within the Hospital they have hanging out for a sign, the
goddess Volupta or Voluptina, sometimes so devoutly reverenced amongst the
Romans, on whom according to our usually manner, we will in this under
written supplication, for their help and succor, invoke.

A supplication to goddess Voluptina, for gross and threeelbowed Fools.
BY the great alacrities and contentments, which in thy dear bosom are laid
up, O goddess Voluptina; by Democritus his laughter; by that of Philisto
Nicean, who therewith burst again; by the joy of Phillipides Comedian, that
died with the same; by the exhilaration of Chilo Lacedemonian, that gave up his
ghost in his sons arms, after he had seen him crowned in the game of
Olympus; by as many tigh-hees as ever came out of god Liber or Bacchus his
mouth; and lastly by all that iocunditie which is resident in the whole Chore
or Quire of the graces: I pray, rebeseech, and once again entreat thee, that
thou will but so much bridle the disposition of these three-elbowed fools to
mirth and iolitie, that if not wholly recovered, yet at least that they be
somewhat bettered by thy means, and favor; which doing, be sure they will
hang up in honor of thee in thy temple, a Cimball or droane pipe, much like
that of Morris dauncers in a merry May day morning, in token that with so
ready succor thou have ioifully relieved these poor miserable men.

Of Fools obstinate, like to an horse or mule: the six and twentieth discourse.
THatrace of stiffenecked fools, replenished with such obstinacy, as they
seem harder then the diamond, and must be entreated four whole hours
together to yield unto the least jot of that becomes them, standing naturally
upon wilfulnes, and being as stiff as a stake, within this foolish Hospital,
are properly called fools obstinate like a mule. In holy Scriptures, obdurate
Pharao was for a most notable example one of these; whose marble heart has left
unto posterity a lamentable memorial of an obstinate fool, of whom it may be
doubted whether he were son to Obduracie it self, or that he were progenitor
or father of the same. Iultan the Apostata, is also by writers set down for a
fool of this kind, who in his life being ever an enemy, and contrary to
Christ, in his last gasp also most fellonious and accursed he never repented
himself of his former contempts, for mad with anger and fury against him,
(although he confessed that he was plainly subdued) he contended with words
to despise the victor; saying, O thou Galilean thou have vanquished: All the
ancient cruel tyrants as Dionysius, Busiris, Phalaris, one Hieronymus,
Policrates, Creon, and they of late days, as one Roman Ecceline and
Valentine, with others, are placed in this infamous and reproachful squadron;
besides the base fry of those, of whose folly there remains no other mention
in writers, but that they put them into this Hospital of force, in that it was
builte at their suit, and instance. Amongst whom I will mention one, that would
make one run his head against a wall to hear the irksome, mulish, and
Asinaicall obstinacy (as we may well term it) which was found in a fellow
worthy well to be beaten with staves, as they beat down walnuts with long
poles, called Bronte of Saint Alberto, who being borne as it should seem for
a spectacle of unusual wilfulnes, and obstinacy of mind, stood stiffely one
day to it, that whereas Donatus in a place says, Ianua sumrudibus, I am a
gate, entrance, or instruction to the rude and ignorant; this word Ianua in
that place was meant by the city of Genoa, and for confirmation of this his
opinion, he cited the authority of a certain Physical vocabulare, which one
master Simon a Genowese, has made upon all Galens works, where he said, that
he had seen it thus expressed: and notwithstanding there wanted not many
learned men in every corner, who perceiving this his simplicity, openly
condemned him of his obstinat position, yet would not this Puglian beetle head
ever yield, or be persuaded, that it signified a gate: there was arguing and
debating to and fro, sometimes with this reason, and otherwhiles with that; and
at last, resolute in no sort to acknowledge his error, he said, that if it
were not meant by Genoa, it was not in like manner understood by a gate, or
port, but rather by a porter, or gate-keeper so as perceiving the sophistry
and deep distinction of this buffone, that argued logically, every one blessed
himself for wonder, that he had but yet yielded so much to the honorable
assembly that was about him. An other archpedant, and most pedanticall
pedagoge, (for that is the head strongst ging of all others, in that it is the
blindest and most ignorant) surnamed Blesus; entering one day into disputation
with a master of a school, being a learned man, of great understanding, and
excellently well accustomed, concerning those words of Cato: Trocho lude, aleas
fuge: Whip the top, let dice go hop; he so obstinaely maintained, that Cato
in these words gave leave to young men to play at snaphaunch, and that in their
diet, they in any wise should take heed of garlic, as this discreet and wise
teacher was feign to leave him to his ignorance, saying, he had reason to do
as he did. This peevish obstinate Pedant after the masters confirmation,
further adding these words: See whether I knew as much as I affirmed or no;
for I have read Diomedes, Scopa, and Priscian, more then four times over, and
I have a Dictionarie called Tortello Nouarese, or Dunses dry fat of words and
phrases, that cleereth all them of doubt, which stand out in contention, and
disputation with me about these points. Suffice it that such be obstinate
Fools like the mule, who within the Hospital have for their devotion the
image of Minos, a godhead peculiarly appropriated to them, and therefore with
solemn inuocations, let us have recourse unto his help and favor, as being
most requisite and beneficial for them.

An invocation to god Minos, for Fools obstinate like a mule.
OThouseuere, inexorable, not to be entreated, immovable, inflexible, god of
the Stigian lake, son of Jupiter and Europa, most mighty King of Creta,
husband to that Pasiphae, who through lust enflamed with the love of a Bull,
foolishly prostrated her self unto him, a bitter persecutor of Dedalus, for
making that Cow of wood, wherein his luxurious concubine lying hid, he had
opportunity of dishonest commerce with her: by that hard and strickt severity
which thou did not only use in this, but in all our filthy enormities, I
entreat, beseech, and conjure thee, that with these manner of obstinate, who
have taken to themselves thy image for devotion, thou will proceed in such a
sort, that they now blind, may perceive how this their obstinacy is far
unlike thine: for thou in circumstances honest, and just were always exorable,
but they in things inconvenient and unbeseeming, do so peruersly persevere, as
there is no proportion in the world between them, and thy disposition. Procure
therefore thou sacred deity of god Ditis his kingdom, that the difference of
you both may be known, and reach unto them that perceiuerance which reigns
in thee, considering that for the favor thou herein show to this obstinate
crew, thou shall see offered unto thee a good clout of leather, such as the
Rusticks of Romagnia set upon their shoes, the which shall be fastened before
thy image as an ensign, to manifest that the obstinacy they have obtained from
thee, is far more beneficial then that other they were possessed withal
before.

Of pildpated and odious Fools: the seven and twentieth discourse.
THey are commonly called pildpated or odious Fools, who taking delight to
offend sometimes one, and then another, not being able to contain, their
humor applies it self one while against this man, and then against that; so
as in the end it comes to this pass, that either the most part, all, or
those of the better sort join together, and seeking revenge, they cause them
to remain pildpated fools; for they be those that bear away sometimes the
good bastenadoes, and carry home the blows upon their heads, which oftentimes
for their blockish importunities they have deserved. And though sometimes it
may be thought otherwise, because they are stout and peremptory out of measure
in their own conceits, hoping in this sort to bear down their companion or
any man they deal withal, whom they esteem but as a withered Tavern Iuie
bush, yet do they so much the rather remain taken of a sudden: For it seldom
times happens, but that he who presumes so much of himself, is at last taken
up for halting, by another as stout as he, that will stand hard to his tackle,
and return buffe for baffe. Cateline thought to have taken Marcus Tullius
napping, with a notable plot he devised against him; but this wise and
politic man returned all the mischief upon his own head, and by means of
the same woman discovering all his practices, he hampered him in such a sort,
that in the end (as Salust writes) he together with all his companions
remained as Salust.
a pildpated and odious Fool. Lodouicus called Morus (as Guicciardine writes)
thought woonderfully to despite Guicciardine.
Ferdinand K. of Naples, by calling in the Frenchmen into Italy against him;
but in the end that fell out, which it should seem a Florentine ambassador
foresaw very well, who observing on a time in Milane his devise, which was a
Moore that voided and swept away all immundicities from before a Lady, gave
his censure thereof, which was, that he should take good heed, this Moore might
cleanse away all impurities from him, for in the end himself rested one of
these pildpated fools, loosing together, both his state, life, and honor. In
like manner Laurence de Medices, near kinsman to Duke Alexander, thought he
had performed a great exploite (as Iouius recounteth, and Ruscellus more
copiously then he) in killing this Duke within one of the cha^bers of his
Iouius, Ruscellus.
palace, although no other effect ensued of this fact, but that for this
flagition he was esteemed as an infamous treacher of all the world, and he
exchanged an happy contentment for a daily disturbance, and molestation both
of body and mind, while according to his deserts he was at last, by certain
of the others guard, slain in Venice. And I pray you tell me one thing? Did not
that Bourbone so much renowned for the sack of Rome, think peradventure to
have given some sound blow, in suddenly reuolting against his king, who for
courtesy, magnanimity, and all kind of virtue had never his peer? Whereas in
the end every one held him but for an odious traitor, and he gave occasion to
that Spanish gentleman (as Bugato reports) being of a generous Bugatus.
and noble spirit, to show the greatness of his mind, and Castilian haughtines
to Charles the fifth, for the Emperor demanding of him in courtesy, that he
would lend him his palace or house to lodge Bourbone in, he made answer: that
for himself he would deny nothing to his sacred majesty, but so he might be
sure of one thing, that he should no sooner be departed out of it, but that he
would pluck down this house even to the very foundations, to the end no man
might point at it, or say: This is the house of such a gentleman, where that
traitor Bourbone was sometimes lodged. Did not George Sanese also think to
have effected a notable piece of service, in minding to deliver into the French
men's hands the Castle of Milane? And yet this treason being discovered, the
Traitor lost both the friendship of the one, with his life and good name at an
instant. All these kind of men therefore are called woorthily pildpated
Fools, because they are discovered, and it comes home to them at length, even
as they thought to have taken others tripping. And these men have for their
sign within the Hospital a Rhadamantus, to whom I now turn my self, to
demand succor (as usually I am wont) for these miserable, ignorant, and
treacherous sort, with sword ready drawn.

A supplication to Rhadamantus for pildpated Fools.
AMong all the infernal judges, there is not any more upright or severe then
thou and Minos, together with Eacus the son of Egina, and Jupiter: And
therefore for this cause thou art deservedly called upon, to salve and cure
this kind of unjust fools, that in the kingdom of Ditis sit in the
chiefest chair: perform therefore that which is expected from thy office and
place, and (as reason requires) we will offer unto thee a pilde threadbare
gown, that has been in the hands of a Jew for the space of ten years,
which shall not have upon it so much as one nappe or hair, for a testimonial,
to the end this may manifest unto the world, that there is not any who better
lays open and discovers these pildpated fools then thy self, they being
subject to that whippe and scourge, which woonderfully chasteneth men of their
quality and condition.

Of irregular and unbridled Fools: the eight and twentieth discourse.
THose insolent sort, who rashly and licentiously proceeding, usurp a
liberty to offend others, either in words or deeds, they thinking the whole
world to be their own, and that with this abused liberty, they may at their
pleasure, bandie against every one, are in few words termed, unbridled
fools, like an horse, having naturally inserted in them indomptable minds,
and insolent shameless dispositions; neither can you with fitter epithites
more aptly describe the quality of this foolish crewe, who kick and wince
with their heels, forward, behind, and on all sides, at every one they meet
withal. It seems that Seneca in his Epistles reckons one Oscus to be in
the Seneca.
number of these, of whom it is said, that he was borne into the world to be
unquiet, and a disturber, he with his actions and speeches annoying sometimes
one: and sometimes an other, and in few words, that Momus is by the Poets
numbered amongst these men, for of him it is thus written, that, Nullum opus tam
absolutum esse poterat, quod non calumniaretur Momus: no work could be so
absolute and perfect, but that Momus would carpe at it: And in token of this,
there is produced a very ridiculous action of his, being this; that seeing on a
day that excellent picture of Venus engraven by divine Phidias, because he
could find no sufficient fault with the singular workmanship, yet would he
needs caffle and carpe, that the latchets of her shoes were not very well
represented. And these be the men that in their evil nature and condition go
seeking out hairs on egg shelles, of a malicious and viperous inclination.
Marinello of Gambacorta, was in these our days one of the number of these
licentious fools; for when as on a time he had leave by chance to see a
comedy which was played in Vincenza, beginning at the prologue, and running
over all the rest of the parts, he spoke evil, and discommended sometimes
this, and then that plaier, so that one near him, through impatience was
forced to say unto him, gentle brother, I pray you give over this scoffing,
for we would willingly hear the Clown to play his part. And an other of
one Portia, surnamed Cauezza, or Horse-collar, is not much unlike this, who by
a certain friend of his being brought to see the hall or chamber where the
great Venetian Council sits, when it was replenished with so many gentlemen
and Signiors, adorned out of question, with comely bodily presence, a grave
majesty, correspondent to so great Senators as they are, like an huge ox or
elephant as he was, without all sense he began to observe this man's hatte,
and that man's nose, the standing still of one, and the moving of an other;
neither did he leave this sight or spectacle before he had made a catalogue of
all that honorable assembly or council, the true honor and ornament, not
only of Italy, but even of all Christendom: when a circumspect Senator that
was near, making a sign with one of his gloves, that he should come to him,
he wentimmediately at this beck, and being by the Senator demanded, of
whence he was, being given to understand that he was of Portia, as also
knowing that his surname was Cauezza (or Horse-collar) taking him quickly by
the collar, he used these words: Master Grunt of Hoggenorton, although an
halter would well become you, yet I pray you return again to yourtowne of
Porkington, except you mean to become a collop of bacon: through which words,
bedawed and gulled as he was, he returned to his companion, and said, come for
gods sake let us be gone, for the gentleman you saw told me in my ear, that
there is a penalty set down, of three twitches with a cord, for any that
shall stand gaping at this gate. Of these kind of fools more lately, were
Aretine, Franco, Burchiello, Bernia, and other such like friends of Pasquine,
and Marforius; wherefore no marvel though at length they came to be sifted
out, and by those soundly bitten, An image with in the court of the Capitol
in kome.
against whom they had showed themselves, out of all measure insolent and
impudent. Neither belongs there any thing more to these fools, but that a
good hempen halter so gagge their throats, as that they may no more be able
to vomit forth such acerbitie and bitterness, which so hard against their wills
they keep enclosed in their breasts. These unbridled fools therefore, have the
image of Hippona in the Hospital, as the peculiar goddess of their
necessities and wants: wherefore with this supplication following, we will labor
to pacify her in such sorre, as that she may not suffer these savage and
accursed beasts, thus to strike and fling at every one.

A supplication to goddess Hippona, for unbridled fools.
WHen the ancients (O dunghill goddess) placed thy acceptable image in sties
and stables, it was not in contempt of thee, being thus amongst beasts as one
scorned or neglected, but because they knew that all creatures have some god or
goddess their favorite, as Syluanus is god of sheep; Miagro the god of flies;
Bubona goddess of oxen; and for this cause also were thou adored as the
goddess, ouerseer of horses, and their stables, and if Nicholas Cuchiero of
Saint Quaranta knew but thus much, be thou assured, though he be but a poor
man, yet would he spend three-halfepence in buying of thy image, to fasten on
the top of his cart, that at all times thou may be a favorite to his
horses: And therefore for this cause, have those poor tankerdbearing iades in
recommendation, who though they were never good for any thing else, yet may
they serve to fill three or four cesternes with water: But if propitius,
according to thy accustomed manner, thou shall behold with a pitiful eye other
mensnecessities, thou shall perceive that with as much speed as is possible,
no trifles shall be offered unto thee, for when thou think least upon it, a
couple of huge malte sacks like those of Gonella will come, by which it shall be
known, that these me^ now bear right down weight, who before were unbridled,
and without any toleration or retention that was good.

Of extrauagant, extreme, and right Fools indeed: the nine and twentieth
discourse.
ALl those by this common term are called extrauagant, extreme, and right
fools indeed, who perform certain extraordinary, unusual, and strange
follies, which exceed ordinary bounds, and are not heard or seen to be
performed by few others besides themselves; as that was which Elian reports
by one Trasillus Esonensis, who fell Aelianus.
into this extreme folly, that he believed all the ships that entered into the
port to be his own, and therefore before they arrived near the harbor, he
would go meet them with a joyful heart and countenance, being full of
contentment; and so in like manner when they departed to make any voyage,
either eastward or westward, he would accompany them a good piece of the way,
wishing unto them with a good heart, a prosperous wind and happy voyage.
Aristotle also declares, that there was one in Abydo, who beginning to enter
Aristotle.
into folly, and so continuing long time, he would go into the Theater, and
reciting to himself some Comedy, he would perform all those actions and
gestures which Comedians use upon the stage. And Plutarch rehearses Plutarch.
one most solemn and admirable of certain Mylesian virgins, who were assailed
with so great madness, that without any consideration they all hanged
themselves, neither could any admonitions of their elders or parents tears
withdraw them from it: In the end, the Milesians being in Senate or
Council, and debating of this action, a notable man amongst them rose up and
said; that if such like as these perseuered in their foolish determination, it
would be requisite to enacte a law, that they should be all disrobed left
hanging naked, and offered to public view, the which decree being of all
approved, and consequently put in execution, the rest received such terror by
the same, as they refrained from their former humors, honest modesty
prevailing more with them, like women verecundious as they were, then folly.
Like unto the death of these women, was likewise the ends of Laurentiano
Fiorentino, a man learned, and of Leonius an excellent philosopher of his time:
For (as Peter Crinitus writes) without any occasion, or misfortune whatsoever,
they threw Peter Crinitus.
themselves into a well, where no less foolishly then miserably, they ended
their days. That folly of Theobaldo of Cantiana was in good' earnest most
extreme, who verily believing that he was Soldane of Egypt, he went oftentimes
vnhosed and vnshodde (as they do) and with a Turbant on his head, into a
certain vaulte near the place where he dwelt, the which he said was his
great Moschyte, or Temple: and he carried with him to the mouth or entrance of
this cave or vault, a company of young swine, who, said he, were the
Ambassadors of sundry princes, which for honor accompanied him; and thus
entering in, he made all the vaulte thunder again with these verses, which he
chaunted: You Mahumetans, now give ear and muse
On that which Sultan Theobald does say:
If you the Alchor an, do not peruse,
You can not saved be an other day.
An other called Scarpaccia of Gradisca, had an extrauagant humor in his head,
(as it may be termed) for entering into conceit that he was king of Cuckoes,
to every one that spoke to him, whether it were good or evil, he would
always answer three times, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo: and being demanded why he
answered not to the purpose, he replied again, I am the king, cuckoo, cuckoo,
cuckoo. I remember I have heard say, that one Alberto of Pietra mala, which is
the confines of Bologna, was in deed one of these extrauagants; for entering
into conceit that he was become Lord of Mirandula, he writ a letter to
those of the town, that they should render into his hands the fortress, and
receiving no answer of his folly, in great fury he leapes me a cockhorse,
and took a drum upon his shoulders, going from Pietra mala, even to the
confines of Mirandula, to wage war with them on his own part; in which thing
like a fool as he was, being also flowted, he went under the walls of that
town, and laying an hot tourd near to the gate, said, that if the
Myrandulanes would not receive him for their Lord, yet they should accept of
the other whom he left as his substitute. These be those fools, who within
the Hospital have the image of God Hercules for a sign, who is very doubtful,
whether he should be protector and defender for term of life of these kind
of fools or no, and therefore in this solicitation ensuing, we will tickle
him with an Encomion, according to our accustomed manner.

A petition to god Hercules for extrauagant, extreme, and right Fools indeed.
THou art that strong and valiant son of Jupiter, and Alcmena, called
Thirintius, because thou werte nourished in Therintus near to Greece; called
the Theban god, because thou were worshipped in Thebes; termed the extrauagant
god, because as a vagaband, thou wentest demanding and seeking out of monsters;
named the great Alcides, because thou were nephew to famous Alceus. Thou art
further he, who by thy own fortitude, and through thy mother who produced
thee, so much by Juno envied, and exposed to insupportable labors, did
first weary her in obeying, before she was out of breath with commanding: Thou
art also he, who yet lying in the cradle did kill two serpents, which were
put in there to poison thee: Thou art moreover he, who being but a child in
years, and yet of wonderful force, that in one night did raise the bellies
of Thespius fifty daughters, by whom thou had fifty sons, named
Thespiades: Thou art he likewise, who in adolescencie of years, did oppress
with fire and sword, the great Hydra with seven heads, which continually
sprouted forth one after the loss of an other, near the marish which was
called Lerna: which did kill and pluck down the stagge Eripides, which
ran as if he had flied, with gilded horns on his head, near to the
mountain called Menalus: which in the wood Nemea, did flea that
extraordinary huge lion, and from that time forward did always wear his
skin about thee as a trophee: who gave Diomedes king of Thrace to his own
horses to be eaten, who fed them before with the blood and flesh of his
guestes and friends: which tookest alive, and did carry to Aristeus, that
terrible Bore in Erymanthus, a mountain of Arcadia, that wasted all the
country round about. Further, thou art he, who did chase even to the island
of Aretiades, the birds Stymphalides, which were so great, that they obscured
the light of the sun: who in like manner did tame that wild bull, which
with his fury ruinated the whole island of Candia: which did take from king
Achelous of Etolia, his horns: did kill Busyris king of Egypt, who eat and
devoured all the strangers which came to him: who in Lybia did choke and
suffocate the giant Anteus, wrestling with him: which did separate and divide
the mountains, Calpes, and Abila, which were at the first all one: which did
sustain Olympus, being before wearied with the heavy burden of mount Atlas:
who subduedst in war Geryon King of Spain, carrying away his arms, being a
worthy reward for the victor. Above all this, thou art he, that did overcome
the thief Cacus, which spit fire out of his mouth: that did kill another
called Lacinus, who molested the confines of Italy, erecting up in that place a
Temple to Juno, which hereupon was called Lacinia: that did overcome Albion
and Bergion, not far from the mouth of the river of Rhodanus, who disturbed
every man's quiet travel: that did subdue in war Pirrhecmus king of
Etolia, who made war upon the Boetians, and did pluck him asunder at horses
tails. Again, thou that did tame the Centaures, and carry away the two
pillars to the Islands Gades in Spain; that did make clean the stables of
Aurgia, and deliver Hesion the son of Laomedon exposed to a marine Orcke, or
monster, by first killing of the Orcke: who being angry when ungrateful
Laomedon, denied thee the reward of certain excellent coursers he promised,
did for this destroy the city of Troy: who did sack the Island of Con,
kill king Eurypalus together with his sons, despoyle the Amazons, and tookest
prisoner Hippolyta the Queen of them: who descending into hell, did bind
with three chains three headed Cerberus; and thus bound, did bring him out.
Thou art also he, which did assist Theseus (according to many writers) to
ravish Proserpina, the wife of Pluto: did lead living out of hell Alcestes,
companion to king Admetus, to her husband; and being returned from hell did
kill Lycus king of Thebes, for that he would have offered violence to thy wife
Megra: who with thy arrows did pearce through the Egle, that devoured the
renewing heart of Prometheus, confined by Mercury in Mount Caucasus: who
fighting on horseback, did overcome Cygnus the son of Mars thy competitor;
which subduedst the Cyclopes, whilst as a maid thou did attend on Omphale
Queen of the Lydians: that did destroy Hebeus with all his family; wounding
also Juno, who would have succored him: and did kill Eurytus King of
Ochalia, ruinating the city called by his name: And yet once more thou art
he, which did by force take unto thy self, and conduct with thee into
Euboea Iole, the daughter of the foresaid Eurytus, who was denied thee to wife:
that near the river Sagari did kill a serpent of immeasurable greatness;
did slay the Dragon that kept the garden of Hesperides, freeing the Oteans
from gnats and hornets; and this only for generation sake, that of two nights
there might be made but one: and with so many of these thy great woonders, and
miracles shall it not be true, that thou can likewise perform somewhat, in
the behalf of these vain and weak sort of extreme Fools, of thee true man,
but in all thy attempts a god, exceedingly favored, that they may remove the
matter out of their heads, which thou in an instant did purge from the heads
of the serpent Hydra. Well go to, if thou shall do them this favor, I will
promise thee, that besides the Temple thou have amongst the Egyptians, and
Tirians, there shall a great chapel in this Hospital be consecrated to thy
name, and an Oak apple offered at thy altar, in sign, that it is as easy for
thee to deliver them, as to promote up so high such a like fruit, amongst all
others observed to be of no worth.

Of mischievous or diabolical Fools: the thirtith discourse.
THE most brutish, strange, and accursed kind of Fools that be, are out of al
question some, whom we usually call by this name of mischievous, or diabolical
fools, the title or imposition, fitting very well with the infernal and
diabolical inclination they are of; for they are so viperous, and inwardly so
swollen with rancour, despite, and all kind of pride, that any one would
swear, they were the true cosen germans of another Farfarello, and
Calubrino. Neither are the examples of these very few, for the devil goes
all over sowing of them, like the herb Dogs-foote, and of themselves they bud
forth like to Hydras heads, and with their flames they set (if it were
possible) all heaven on fire, much more the earth. No man can deny but that
those giants were of this race, who by Jupiter for their pride were slain with
lightning from heaven, for the writer or Author of Etra makes this matter
very evident in those verses: The ancient Giants did sometimes contend,
To pluck the stars out of the lofty sky,
And to pervert, Jove's kingdom without end
Imposing laws on all the world boldly.
In like manner it cannot be denied, but that Mazentius a contemner of the
gods, was of the self same race: Virgill setting him down for such an one in
these verses: Virgill.
The first from Terrhene soil, that went to war,
Was proud Mazentius, who with gods did iar.
And this was he of whom Macrobius uses these words: Macrobius.
Fuit impius in homines, sine Deorum respectu: He was wicked toward men, not
respecting God at all. I hold it for a thing very manifest, that Lycaon king
of Arcadia was also a notable devilish Fool, if that be true which Ovid
reports in the first of his Metamorphosis, that Ovid.
he complotted against Jupiter, reputed amongst the ancients as head of all
other gods. Xerxes king of Persia noted by writers of singular impiety, is not
exempted out of this number, he being so bold, nay rather so rash and
headstrong, as that he durst threaten to deprive the sun of his light, and
put Neptune the god of the sea into prison, with fetters on his heels: And
therefore Strozzapadre makes of him these verses: Nor as King Xerxes, who did
threaten bonds Strozzapadre.

To Neptune, when with ships he shot the strondes.
Amongst whom in like manner I give to a thousand devils, that Plegia king of
Lapithes, and father to Ixion; who for rashly setting fire on the Temple of
Apollo in Delphos, is declared by Virgill, that for punishment of his offense,
he was enclosed in an infernal cave, in these verses: All Plegian malefactors,
with loud voice he does advise
From hell, Justice to use, and not the gods despise.
Valerius Maximus, and Lactantius Firmianus, assigns Valerius Maximus.
Lactantius.
one of the principalest places amongst these men, to Dionysius Tyrant of
Siracusa: for he was so great a contemner of the gods, as he himself amongst
his friends was wont to say, that he greatly woondred, how the gods were so
patient, as to suffer him so long upon the earth. Biondus in his History
makes mention of Euerick Biondus.
King of Goths, that he rammed up the gates of Christian churches, with heaps
of thorn bushes, wickedly intending to make them appear like hedges and
thickets, because he would be a Fool in this kind. Corius writes of
Gensericus king of Vandales, that with greater sacrilege, of the same
Christian churches he made stables for his horses, being likewise an infernal
Fool of the same nature. What shall we say of Attila, termed the scourge of
God, but even the self same? What of Tottila, and Athanaricus? What shall we
think of that Duke of the Hauuians, who threatened to cut off the privy
members of all the Deacons that came into his hands? What of those first
innouators, who of the great church in Basil, made a butchers shambles? And
last of all, what of our modern Mahumetists, who desperately make the worst of
every thing that they can, committing all kind of rapine, violence,
sacrilege, manslaughter, and rebellion that may be imagined. Now these be
truly Fools, who are mischievous, and therefore deserve a thousand gallows,
termed properly by the title of diabolical Fools, because in every respect
they are conformable unto him: Wherefore in recommending them unto some god,
that may cure them, I can think on no better physician then Pluto, who is in
hell a perfect Anatomy of their like: And for this cause, I direct unto him
this invocation following.

An invocation to Pluto for mischievous and diabolical Fools.
WHatgod may I more conveniently call upon, to remove the folly of this
devilish crew, then thee high Pluto, Prince of Herebus, admiral of the Stigian
waters, president of the flames which exceed a thousand times those of Aetna,
or Mount gybello? what God if not he, who is the son of Saturn and Opis,
brother to highest Jupiter, Lord of the infernal kingdom, being mighty in
riches, and therefore called Ditis, principal amongst the Manian gods,
therefore called Sumanus, and of power to inflict upon them their due
punishments, called therefore Orcus, by every one? what god if not thou, who
rentest Titius heart from out his body, punishest Tantalus with thirst, make
Ixion to be turned upon a wheel, causest Sysiphus to roll the stone, and
chastisest Salmoneus with so sundry torments. Thou I say, the scourge of all
extreme cruelties, the revenger of flagition, the ouerthrower of the wicked,
and flaile of all badde men, ought to have a care of healing these men's
folly, in the same manner as thou have before cured so many other by giving
them into the hands of the furies, who incensed against them, may inflict upon
them those torments, which the greeuousnes of their offense demeriteth. The
which if thou shall perform, undoubtedly with all speed an hornelesse
doad-man shall be offered unto thee, for demonstration of the punishment thou
have laid upon these men, according to their deserts, and the insolences
which so diuelishly they have committed.

A discourse of the Author, to the beholders concerning that part of the
Hospital which appertains to Women, wherein he wittily sets down all the
former kinds of folly to be likewise resident in them.
COnsidering (noble beholders) that you have commodiously perused all their
Cells one by one, who diversely besotted and deprived of their wit, are become
not so much a ridiculous, as a miserable spectacle to other men; and that you
have taken such delight in the subjects of them, as you could any ways look
for, from so strange and uncouth humors, administering at an instant by diverse
means, both contentment and wonder to your minds, by the specialties of
folly which you have observed: I think it not much amiss to point out unto
you likewise this other part of the Hospital, allotted to women, causing you
to behold with your eyes, the most ridiculous emploiments of foolish women,
that ever peradventure you have seen in the world. Because with the greater
solace you may leave this harbor, and replenished with greater wonder and
admiration, go all over the world, declaring and setting forth the monstrous
follies, which shall by me be revealed unto you, the which you receiving from
me, will in your relating them to others, administer special contentment:
Fix therefore your looks I beseech you, on that part, which I will point out
unto you, and cast an eye here on the left hand, where you see a long row of
lodgings and chambers, which have so many superscriptions, titles, and devises
set upon their doors; for all those be Cells appropriated to foolish women, to
be hold which leisurely, is accounted no small favor, it being the custom to
show them seldom, and to few, in respect of the modesty observed toward
that sex, naked for the most part as you now see. The first chamber which you
see there with that devise hanging over the door, which is a tuft of wild
nettles, with an inscription, which imports, in puncto vulnus; is the lodging
of a Roman matrone called Claudia Marcella, which in her youth was the most
sweet, affable, Iouiall, and pleasant mad wench, that from the one to the
other pole could be met withal; a rare pattern of comlines, the only
portraiture of courtesy, the image of divine splendour and beauty, and the very
express Idea of courtly grace and carriage: and now (behold how lamentable
her chance was) slipping one day in her pantofles, as she went to the
solemnization of goddess Bona her feast, she fell upon a great stone with her
forehead and chinne, and thus loosing both her wit and memory at an instant,
she began to be lunaticke and doting, after such a sort, as she became every
day worse and worse, sitting upon the bed as you see, al mournful and
heavy, with an vrinall at hand; and as often as you demand an answer of her,
touching this or that matter, so often does she take the vrinal out of an Hutch
hard by, and beholding herself therein, she says, this is the wise
prophetess Sybilla; and thus peereth sometimes on the vrinall glass, and
otherwhiles on the water within it. Whereupon the master of the Hospital, who
is a man of greatknowledge and understanding, about the causes and reasons of
the infirmities there reigning, has framed that devise, or imprese with the
title, minding ingeniously herein to give gentlemen strangers to understand,
that come to behold this part of the Hospital, by the tuft of pricking
nettles, and that motto; In puncto vulnus: that as the nettle no sooner
touches, but it pricketh and stingeth, so that matrone no sooner slipped and
fell upon the stone, but that by the cruel fall she was so affrighted in her
brain, as now she labors and turmoileth her-selfe there within as you see.
That other chamber near unto it, where you see one standing in the door, who
all silent and sad, with her eyes looking downward, and all disheaueled, to
fix her countenance upon the earth, never so much as looking upward; but on
the contrary, with her eyes drooping, she so bends her looks to the
ground, as it might seem that her eyes were concentred and fast linked to the
earth, is one Martia Cornelia, of the country of the Insubrians, who from her
infancy has been possessed with melancholic humors, and therefore you may
observe her so savage in aspect, and in countenance ghastly. And amongst other
humors which oftentimes disturb her imagination, this one in good earnest is
very terrible, that many times she takes herself to be a silk worm:
whereupon she never does any thing else but nibble upon mulberie leaves,
affirming that by this means she preserves her-selfe in life: and therefore
you may perceive that the devise and motto, set upon her gate by the master of
the Hospital, be correspondent to her infirmity: the devise being a codde or
web, with a silk worm within, and on the one side a little branch of a
mulberie tree, with a motto framed in these words, Et mihi vitam, and alijs
decus. But I pray you look a little foreward, and regard that Cell which has
the gate open, where she whom you see with a cushinet by her, and a fine
wicker basket with cruel and silk, to work withal, giving over her best
emploiment, with that needle in her hand, she goes stabbing of flies, and
pismires, in steed of working upon her cushion: she is called Marina de
Volsci, so lither and idle, that the whole day in steed of some serious
labor, she gives her-selfe to bucksomnes, and gig-loitry: wherefore the
master of the place has assigned her for a devise, a graie bearded old man,
pursuing of butterflies, with a motto appertinent to the purpose, Quo grauior,
eo segnior. The fourth Cell which next succeeds, if you mark well (for it
has the gate gaping and wide open) is made after the fashion of a tavern,
wherein a woman lies prostrate, with her hair loose about her ears, a
Thirsus in her hand, and withal a little bell, serving to ring therewith to
god Bacchus his feasts, who Or iaueline wreathed about with Iuie.
is one of those ancient Menades, by some called Bacchides, and by others
Stimeles, in that by Lycus his fury they were stimulated, where this woman
called Teronia Heluetia, with her head full of good Greek and Trebian wines,
does nothing else but whirle about, shaking that Thirsus or wreathed iaueline,
and ringing the bell with all mirth and iolitie. To conclude, growing drunk,
she spreads herself upon the floor of the earth, even as now you find her;
and for this cause she has a devise made, with a motto answerable to her
ebriety, which is a Magge pie with a soppe in her mouth, and these words
underwritten: Hinc silens, hinc loquax. The other whom you see in the Cell
underneath, who with her rock and spindell, takes a lantern in her hand to
see to work by at high noone day, and when the sun with his beams shines
over the whole Hemispheare, is a mad forgetful fool, which can carry nothing
in mind that she has to do, who is called Orbilia Beneuentana: wherefore
the devise and motto fitteth exceeding well with her folly, the denise being a
mole, which naturally is blind, with this motto: Haec oculis, haec mente. But
that other miserable and unfortunate poor soul, who as soon as she saw you
look toward her Cell, hid herself behind that close stool, covering her
body with the bolster, and rugge of her bed, is a certain pretty tiptoe,
called by all men Lucietta of Sutri, who in all her actions is so fantastical
and skittish, that when she goes sometimes to blow the fire, and but feeling
the wind of the bellows, she starts back three fadome, for fear of that
blast; and this tremulent humor can no ways be removed out of her head,
though diverse and sundry physicians have tried a thousand experiments for her
cure: wherefore with good consideration that devise is set upon her door, which
is; a conie scraping up the earth, with a motto that says; Huic fuga salus:
because like a conie she thinks not her self secure, except she hide
her-selfe in the same manner as you see. Oh but for gods sake vouch safe to
talk with her, apparelled all in graie, that has so great goll or thropple
hanging down, as she may cast it back upon her shoulders, if you will hear a
right puppie in deed: for this is that Menega of Voltolina, daughter to
Roganzzo Panada, and Mathia his wife, who on a time was made believe, that a
cow making love to a frogge, and he moved with compassion toward her, not
knowing any other course he could take to content her, he was willing one day
while the cow was drinking at a river, to be swallowed down by her, and thus
swimming within her belly, he entered into that concauitie where the cow
conceiueth, and pissing there within it, he made her after three years space
to bring forth a creature, which had legs like to a frogge, and all the rest
was like to a pied or spotted cow, such as those of Hungary be: wherefore the
master of the Hospital seeing her so round and plumpe in substance, has
placed upon her Cell that devise which you see, it being a Buffle, with a ring
at his nose, and this motto Quocunquerapior; because no devise can be more
conformable and correspondent to her humor then this. In that other Cell which
you see, there is a certain silly soul, of an addle and weak brain, as any
creature you ever saw in the world, and she is called Orsolina Capoana, who
is of this quality, that if you bid her sweep the house, she will fall a
paring of her nails, and yet it will be evening before she have made an end
of this work; and sometimes when she has been enioined to heat the lie for
the bucke, she put her mouth to the spiggot of the tubbe, blowing there for
the space of three hours like a very dottrell, and by such like fopperies
poor wretch she is so transported away in her senses, that if you should but
bid her void an vrinall, be sure that like a little child, blowing of
feathers up into the air, with a thousand other toies, she will tarry two
hours at the least, and at the last, either bring you the empty case, or the
vrinal al battered and broken, being so simple a drizzell as she is. Therefore
marvel not if the keeper of the Hospital have set that devise upon her door;
which is a fly houering about a light, and a motto, which in Spanish
signifies, Ne mas, ne menos: for as there is not a more silly creature then
this kind of fly, which houereth so long about the candle, that at last she
burns her own wings; so is there not any so sottish a roile, which may be
compared to her. It seems this other foul flappe-mouth is very like unto
her, who has forgotten her spindle, while her rock is between her legs,
and now much amazed therefore, and staring with her eyes, she looks upon you,
as if she had never seen man in her life before: this woman is called Thadia
di pozzuolo. And amongst many other of her sotteries this one is very
notorious; that when the Guardian of the Hospital one day commanded her to
take a little water out of the cesterne, and set it upon the table, in steed
of using the bucket, she took a porredge pipkin wherein there were colewoorts
a seething, and set the broth upon the table, so qualified with cold water, as
all men that were present conceived of her minnerie, together with no
indifferent wonder, delight, and pastime thereat: and for this cause she is
set forth with that imprese you there see, which is a goose climbing on the
top of an hedge, with her motto, Frustranitor; this imprese with the motto
thereof signifiyng, that as the goose is a grosser creature then any other,
neither can she so much as fly over an hedge; so she performs foolishlie all
actions whatsoever she goes about, because she does not any one thing as she
should do. That foul beetle-headed Margherita Bolognese, remaining there in
that Cell below, seems to be a bird of the same nest, of whose stupiditie
though there were no other sign or manifestation in the would; yet would this
one trick of hirs be more then sufficient, to prove her so: who being sent by
a certain dame to the shops of the Jews, about an embassage of hers, to hier
braselets and earerings, as they use to do for setting themselves forth in
Carneual time, she going to a casket of her mistresses, took there out a pair
of braselets which she had in a box, with certain fair earerings, and
carried them to a Jew saying; that such a gentlewoman her mistress sent
thither that ware, to be let out for use, and thus she returned of that
message to her mistress, bravely gulled by that wiseaker, as could be
possible; and for a good while there was speech of nothing else in that house
but of this: wherefore you see that proportionablie the keeper has placed for
an imprese over her door, abroad faced owl, with a motto which says; Ipse ego
and ego ipse. But be hold next unto her within her Cell, comes that wicked
Lucilla da Camerino, who is as vicious us a fool as possibly can be, and for
confirmation hereof, behold the vessel she has in her hand: this vessel
is full of walnut water, which makes the skin as black as a cole. Now this
woman about noone time besmeareth all her body over, and being naked draws
here to the maids of the keepers house, when it is about dinner time, so that
all of them aghast at so foul a sight, run away, and leave the table and
meat as a pray to that ravenous she wolf, who without any discretion at all,
does in a manner ordinarily play those prankes, to the children, servants,
and all the rest of the house. Hereupon she has over her Cell a devise
altogether conformable to her self, which is a foxes tail that sweepeth a
chamber, with this French motto: Parmafoy que liet tanbien. I say nothing to
you of that other despightful cockscombe called Flauia Drusilla, whom you see
there busied about that little foisting curre, rubbing and combing him so
carefully, as appears, who a little while after, calling him to her by the
name of Fiorino, and he not coming, she grows into such a fury, as that in
choler she would hang, or presently make him into iellie; and this is her
quality, that for every little matter she is so moved, as cursed Gabrina, or
the wife of Pinabell, would have but an hard match with her. And if there
were nothing else, yet is this one part of hers most notable, which happened
the other day: for while she was washing out her buck, a little lie by
misfortune that fell out, sprinkled into one of her eyes; whereupon this
despightful fool took the bucking tubbe, and threw it against the wall,
breaking it all in pieces, carrying away the clothes she had washed, and
rensing them in a river that ran hard by, where she let all go down the
stream merrily, neither had she recovered any of them again, if a discreet
wench had not run in and told them of the house of it, sending down to the
waters side men with long poles to take them up as well as they could: and
therefore since that time, the master of the Hospital caused a painter a
friend of his, to place over her Cell that devise, which is; a Beuer biting
off his own stones, with this motto; Vlcisci haudmelius: which clearly
manifests the outrageous folly of this beast. Behold that other swine
snowted sowestanding in her door, which does nothing but gyrne and laugh, and
at the least matter she either hears or sees, sets her mouth wide open like an
oue^: She is called Domicilla Feronia, who has an husband that blockishlie
reciprocateth with her in the same folly, now because her humor consists in
nothing else but immeasurable laughter, the keeper has caused to be placed
over her door, that owl sitting upon a whippe, a creature that would make the
very stones to smile at the sight of her, with this motto; Haec alijs, and mihi
alij: for thus her vanity is exceeding well notified, she being a coffine
replenished with carrionlike matter, but void of any wit, or understanding
at all: I cannot tell whether you perceive her that sits at her door upon a
seat, with a gown trailing after her like a peacocks tail, she is called
Tarquinia Venerea, then whom there can be nothing more proud and glorious: and
this I shall tell you manifests as much; for declaring her progeny one day
to certain gentlemen, although it exceeded not two hundred years in
antiquity, yet proved she her-selfe to be of the Queen of Saba her race,
and showed therewith a pearl and diamond of extraordinary value and
estimation, which she said great king Solomon gave her, when she departed from
his court; forcing every one to believe, that successively by inheritance,
these jewels came in the end to her. And yet one day she uttered a more notable
one then this, declaring to certain ladies and gentlewomen who were come to
see her, that she had yet in her house a pair of hose of taffata, that
belonged to the Signior and consorte of that Queen her kineswoman: wherefore
the keeper of this place observing the simple folly of this woman, and
accomodating a devise to her genius or inclination, he placed over the door
of her Cell for an imprese, the image of Time, after the same sort as it is by
Poets described, which is, by a Dragon eating up his own tail, with a
proportionable motto to the same, that says: Sola aeternitate victa. But I
pray you, do me this one favor, observe her well which comes after, being
called Andronica Rhodiana; think of her as of a crafty and subtle Fool in
deed; for questionless she fayneth her-selfe to be distracted for no other
end, but to enjoy easy and good days, who in this point discovers her
self; for sometimes she will go into the hen-loft, and get her into the
corner where the hen sittes, crying, co co co, to show like an hen that she
has laid an egg; but if any go to take it up, she cries no more after that
manner, brusling her feathers, or cackling like an hen; but with a good staff
in her hand she will make him stand further from the hen-roost: wherefore the
keeper perceiving these her knauish proceedings, has set her forth for a
dissembling Fool, and placed over her cell the picture of Fraud, with her
balance in her hand wanting of weight, with a motto adjoining which expresses,
Ars fortunae salus, because by these tricks, she obtayneth pleasant and good
days. The other whom you see beholding the moon at a window, is called Liuia
Veletri, because sometimes she is in perfect sense, as if she never had been
possessed with this foolish influence; and otherwhiles on the contrary, she is
so stimulated by this passion, as that by long experience they gather that she
is lunaticke: wherefore the other day she seemed in her speech, and discourse
another Palace. Now if any man speaks to her, he shall find her altogether
out of her wits, tossing and turning like a beggar in fresh straw; for as the
moon wayneth, so does her wit decrease: and therefore you see a devise with a
motto proportionable to this humor; the one being a crab which beholds the
moone-shining, the motto being framed in these words: Nunc in pleno, nunc in
vacuo. She enclosed by her parents within the next cell, is the fair Martia
Sempronia, where over the door is painted winged Cupid with a light in his
hand, and this motto subscribed: Desperatasalus. For she inflamed with love,
grew foolish not many years sithence, for the love of one Quintus Rutilius,
and not knowing with what to present this ingratfull young man, for the
mitigation of his cruelty and hard heart, with a needle she let her self blood
in a vain, venting a pound of her blood into a golden cup with a little
inscription, that imported; Si feris humana prosint: the which present being by
chance found by her brothers, was occasion of a great tribulation which she
suffered: wherefore amidst these vexations and injuries, she grew to a
desperate degree of loving folly, whereinto being fallen, by the small love of
her parents, she was confined in the place you see. As a companion to this
woman, in another kind of folly she there shows her self, who has an
haulter prepared fastened to that iron hook: for though her name may presage
happily, she being called Mansueta Britannia, yet are her actions quite
contrary to the same: for like a desperate Fool she has three times fastened
the halter about her neck, to hang her-selfe, and always some one or other
has been ready at hand to help her: neither can she by the help of
physicians any ways be cured of this desperate disposition, because she has
suffered this passion to have too great predomination, the which is so much the
less excusable, by how much sometimes upon a trifling occasion, she will needs
hang her-selfe; even as the other day, she prepared that rope in the same
manner as you see, only because a needle was taken out of her pinpillow, and
so she could not work on her cushion as she would have done: wherefore the
devise and motto show her extreme despair; the devise being the body or
trunk of a Cypress tree, which being once cut, never grows again, and
the motto: Semel mortua quiescam. Who would not say that Hortensia Quintilia,
she whose residence is there a little below, were sister to Hortensia of
Bergamo, or Sarnie, she being a starcke noddie as also he was: for if his
humor be not included in her, both one and other may go hang themselves. This
woman to show the verity of that I have said, void of understanding, and of
so weak a brain, as she one day sat idle by the fires side, striking with
the tongs upon a burning logge, she took woonderful delight to see so many
sparckles come from it, as children do when playing with their fathers, they
ask counters and crowns; when the maid of the house scumming the possenet,
let fall some of the broth upon the block, and so deprived this fool of her
contentment, and brought her self to great trouble: for she in all fury,
took up the billet by one end, and with it went after the maid all the
street over, crying out, lay upon her, lay upon her, like a queen as she is.
Let it suffice, that the matter being afterward known, by the maids own
report, and those of the house; she growing every day worse and worse, as
it happened, was by her friends constrained to enter in here, where the Guardian
of the Hospital fully informed of her humors, composed that devise for her
which you see, and placed it over her Cell, which is no other but a choke
pear, stricken down with a great haylestone, and this motto subscribed: Actum
est: which concurreth excellently well with her folly, which surely is
headstrong and stirred up by and by. Be merry a little, and pluck up your
spirits in beholding that notable Cogster Terentia Samntte, who in her
gestures, words, inventions, and carriage is the very sister of Boccafresca,
or Gonello: and for proof of this, the other day she sat her down, and
called into the chamber before her all the whole household of the master of the
Hospital, they all running up in have to hear some goodly matter come from
her (according to her wont) where many being assembled together, while they
expected some discourse, or speech, as otherwhiles she was wont to make: at
this time (not without laughter) she used a thousand gestures, with her hands,
and eyes, sometimes this way, then that way, seeming always, as if she would
even then have begun; at last fetching a deep sigh with a grunt like an hog,
she told them, that the occasion of her calling them together, was to no other
end, but that so noble a grunting belch, might be honored with so goodly an
assembly as there then was: so that very fitly that devise is set over her
Cell, a great iobbernoll, with a large slop after the Dutch manner hanging upon
the nose, and this motto in Dutch Italian gibberedge: Chesta, stare bone
compagne. But a most Iouiall and pleasant humor is that, of Quintia Emilia,
borne to the relaxation and contentment of every one, whose residence is in a
Cell somewhat beneath, having three gentlemen standing by her, to whom with her
speech she gives wonderful pleasure and delight. And not long sithence one
of them demanding of her, at what time women are most foolish: she wittily
answered; when you men will but give them so much time, as to become so: And to
an other, who asked her wherefore nature had bestowed so little wit on women,
she presently answered, that resolving his question truly, the answer was in
readiness, because nature wrought like a woman as she was. It may suffice that
there is a convenient devise deputed for her, which is, a Jupiter in the midst
of heaven sitting upon a throne of gold, with this motto of the poet; Iouis
omniaplena: But mark that same fantastical and capricchious Herminia Bohema,
that for a roasted chestnut the other day, set all the house in an uproar, and
other sometimes she gives to them that would, and would not; and the other
day for a dried Seruise, she cried for the space of an hour, with her
neighbor Marietta, being afterward pacified in a monent: she has woorthily
upon her door for a devise, a great Turkicocke that girdeth forward on a
sudden, and presently staieth, with a motto; Tanto lenis, quanto propera. And
she who is chained to a bed hard by, is a certain beastly fool called
Giacoma da Pianzipane, who the other day plaide this fine pranke, for a boie
coming near to her to have emptied her close stool, she took the pot and
laid it on his head, so despitefully, that the poor lad was three days
after, ere he came to himself. And yet not two days since, she performed an
other far beyond this, for finding an ass that was brought into the house,
with two baskets full of eggs upon his shoulders, she took a kneading tubbe,
and so persecuted the poor ass, as she made him fall into an hole, which
served as a sink, to receive all the immundicities of that place, where the
poor beast slumped into the dirt with his pannell, and broke all his eggs and
baskets: And besides in the market she set upon the asses master, that came
behind him, and if he had not suddenly retired himself back, out of doubt,
she had made a mighty carbonado of his head incontinently: wherefore the
keeper considering the brutish humor of this fool, over her Cell has caused
to be painted fit to the purpose, that Megera disheaueled, and with hair
about her ears, with her motto, which says; Accensanil dirius. A little
underneath mark her, who is so pensive in view, and looks on the wall with
her mind fixed thereon; she is called Lauinia Etolia, who is an extrauagant
and notable fool indeed, and I know thus much by this: for not long since
she writ a conceit to a princess of high place, like to the title of that
which those of Saint Marino in Romagna, writ to the Venetian Signorie, saying:
To our dear and well-beloved sister, the Venetian Commonwealth, for those of
Saint Marino, though they be all in a manner rustickes, and country men, yet
live they in a commonwealth like Venetian Signiors; and in that invention she
requested of her a special favor which was; that withal her Damsels, and
waiting maids, she would come and visit her, and stay with her eight days;
for she would for her entertainment furnish a Palace beseeming another
Cleopatra, and among other dainties, she would give her one of a Beuers
stones, not such an one as a friend of mine of Piacenza bought, of a roaguish
coosening mate in the city of Teruigi, but somewhat less, which would perfume
even the very porredge-pot or coleworts within, so precious it was, and
peerless; and to each of her damsels, she meant to present an Indian
cricket, who wakeneth men without a clock, at what hour soever they please:
wherefore upon this worthy fantasy, that devise you see was co^pounded, which
is the image of a monstrous Medusa, with a motto, Extrema peto; because
doubtless her follies be monstrous and extreme. After her follows such
another driuell, that of all the pains she takes, she gains nothing but
nichilles, and her name is Calidonia da Heppi, who never stands still, or is
at quiet, and sometimes she ticketh with one, and then tacketh with another; and
after the sport is ended, she returns home, either with her face all to be
scratch, her hair shagged abroad, or her mouth all to be grumbled, for these
be the recreations which she ordinarily uses after meals: therefore by her
devise which is a Pluckt-hen with this motto, Quid nostra prosunt? a man may
straight conceive, wherein her error consists. And that other somewhat
beneath her, called Cecilia Venusia, is a notable bucksome, and well pampered
Fool, who is continually conversant in her riggery, neither can a man behold
afiner madge-howlet then her self, so that she is never without a company of
women about her, who without her comfort, would certainly be even dead, and
half lost. This woman by her monckeries, singing of riffe raffe rimes and
country gigs, recounting a thousand merry tales, far more pleasant, then
those of Strapanarola, and by prating more incessantly then a Parrat, she has
brought in amongst them an other Lubberlande, to pass over all melancholic
and displeasing humors: wherefore you see, that her imprese is a tavern bush
on the top of a spear, with this motto; Vndiquerisus; because it seems
that this devise and motto cannot fitlier concur with any then her self.
There follows after her Armodia Falisca, being an unbridled fool like a
horse, licentious and dissolute in all her actions, in her words impudent and
lavish, and with insolent liberty she raileth on every body, as she did the
other day; for seeing a great troop of gentelwomen return from the feast of
some saint, she found fault even with this, that one of them had a needle
sticking on her head cawle, in nothing so comely a sort as was requisite: And
therefore her advise is an horsestraine, with a motto expressing thus much; Nil
satiu^; she being very well known for so viperous a fool, as in truth she is.
That last Cell saving one, belongs to Laurentia Giglia, in all her affairs
being an obstinate fool like a mule; and from this, her obstinacy comes
evidently to be discerned; for not long sithence being rebuked by some of her
friends for talking at a window with I know notwho, departing presently, she as
suddenly returned, and once again put in mind of it by them, she withdrew
herself a little, and afterward showed herself there a fresh; neither could
the wind which came with a great hail of stones as as big as an egg, so
much as make her bouge from that place, she being disposed to win the field,
and have the conquest of heaven and earth. And therefore in all reason, she
has an anuile with an hammer striking upon it, set up for her imprese, with
this motto, Nec ictibus: which clearly manifests the extreme wilfulnes she
is possessed withal. But she who strikes it up, carries the game away, and
makes up the feast as it should be, is Hostilia Mutinense, either the sister
of Merline, or daughter of Calcabrine, a woman inspiritate, diabolical, and
stuffed up even to the very gorge with all kind of flagition and villainy.
This devilish Fool is so monstrous and malignant, as there is no devise in the
world that can sufficiently express her perverse, wicked, and abominable
nature. Therefore amongst all the rest, she only is left without imprese or
devise; for neither Gabrina for despite, Circes for diabolical malice, nor any
other prodigious monster so much by the ancients celebrated, can woorthily
enough represent her strange and enormious properties. So that honorable
beholders I conclude thus much, that it were much better for you never to come
near her Cell: for if she do but perceive your being here about, make account
that like another Alcina, she will turn you all into beasts, trees, or stones;
and instead of entering into an Hospiof Fools, you shall find your selves in
that palace, where cursed destiny transformeth men into Asses, and this is all
you might gain by the sight of her. Let us therefore now put to the gates of
this Hospital, and roaue abroad at large, for that which already you have
seen, is more then enough.

FINIS.
