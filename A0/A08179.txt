TO THE VIRTUOUS YOUNG GENTLEMAN, AND HIS VVORTHILY REspected friend, Mr. Thomas
Edgworth, under Treasurer of Windsor, Health and Content in his own Person,
and in the happy fruition of his virtuous Wife.
SIR, your felicity, the highest top of enioyment in this kind, is become the
aim, that the practicke Art in this school of direction leuelleth at, you
being already instated (with envy and admiration) in that bliss, which others
may thus toil after in most beseeming circumstances (by many degrees) to come
short of: When I enter this course of life (as, for ought I know, I may one
day marry) be it my highest ambition, with all my directions, to have one to be
a near imitator of her so many Religious and Moral virtues, for whose happy
continuance my best wishes shall be spent, that she may long continue yours, to
make you a father of happy and undoubted children; sons for the earth, and
Saints for heaven, multiplying upon your head all the comforts in that
Covenant: And for this Treatise, which, by your direction, comes forth to
direct others to that model of happiness wherein you stand eminent, may it
have that success with all, that it has had approbation with you, and as
kind entertainment with the world as those best creatures, the subject
thereof in their perfection deserve, which are the Seed and Seminary thereof,
and which (by this means) have maintained that lasting, and yet vn-ended, war
against those two arch, and unwearied adversaries of Mankind Time and Death,
the wasters thereof, and consumers of all sublunary things, which began their
siege against the first man that lived, and have ever since held on without
league, or imparlance, for the space of these 5500 years and upwards, and
which shall go on and continue the siedge to the end thereof, and consummation
of all things: Wherein if it shall be so happy (beyond expectation) the pain
thereof has been well undertaken, and your encouragement fortunately
seconded, which howsoever I leave it to the adventure, and you to your hearts
best wishes.

By him that entirely is dedicated yours: ALEX. NICCHOLES.

To the Youth and Batchelary of England, hot bloods at high Revels, which
forethought of this action, and all other, that hereafter intend this
adventure.
SINCE that the meanest blessing in man's life,
Is not the Dowry of a virtuous wife;
No otherwise then is the adverse cross,
To him that bears it the most easy loss.
Therefore to you, whose weary bonds yet keep,
Seuering the Arms wherein you long to sleep;
That have beforehand, many a tedious hour,
Wished that approaching minute in your power,
Which when arrived, most slowly brought to pass,
Cancels but Parchment to inroule in Brass:
What not so short a term of years shall end,
Unless one show himself the kinder friend:
Wherein, lest your to forward have should stray,
Here is beforehand chalked out a way:
(As conscience craves, for so large connection
Should not be entered in without direction.)
Which who so walks in to the true intent,
Shall not commit that action to repent.
The ignorant by this have sharper eyes,
More deeper insight to these mysteries,
And were their understanding dark or blind,
To pass this Laborinth it is here refinde:
Here are the Characters insculpt and read,
That make a happy or a loathed bed.
What woman is on whom all these depend,
Her Use, Creation, Excellence, and End.
In making choice how much to be confined,
To Beauty, Riches, Parentage, or Kind:
What are the chief disturbers of this state,
That soonest point a man that sorest fate.
Here are the Rocks discovered to the eye,
That he that would not shipwreck may sail by.
And these the rather being aforehand laid,
Vnballanst pleasures to each youth and maid,
That when experience shall their sweetness tell,
In stead of heaven they purchase not a hell.
And that the joy their forward youth has sought,
Vncrosly matched mry come more near their thought.
To those that forbear marriage for more liberty of sin.
But you whose lusts this lymit shall not tie,
For more enlargement to variety,
That will not any your own proper call,
The better interressed to commerse with all.
As when your Lord and Lady down are laid,
Behind the door to woe the Chambermaid:
Or amongst neighbors, where you lead your lives,
To be the more familliar with there wives,
Or any place where ere you do espy,
A pretty morsel pleasing to your eye,
To ceize it more suspectlesse, being known
Then he that has at home a wife of's own.
Well take that blessing, but withal this curse,
To walk on weak legs with an empty purse.

CHAP. I. Of the first Institution and Author of Marriage.
IT is not good for man to be alone (says the alone and absolute Goodness of
all goodness it self) (...)mus ergo adiutorem (...): Genesis 2.18.
Let us therefore make him a helper meet for him: So the creation of the woman
was to be a helper to the man, not a hinderer, a companion for his comfort, not
a vexation to his sorrow, for Consortium est Solatium, Company is comfortable
though never so small, and Adam took no little joy in this his single
companion, being thereby freed from that solitude and silence which his
lonenesse would else have been subject unto, had there been no other end nor
use in her more, then this her bare presence and society alone: But besides all
this, the earth is large and must be peopled, and therefore they are now the
Crown of his Workmanship, the last and best and perfectest piece of his
handiworke divided into Genders, as the rest of His creatures are, Male and
Female, fit and enabled Procreare sibi similem to bring forth their like, to
accomplish his will, who thus blessed their fruitfulness in the Bud: Increase
and multiply, and replenish the earth. Well might S. Paul say, observing this,
Marriage is honorable amongst al men, and the bed undefiled; since God himself
was the Author and Institutor thereof even in Paradise, who gave the woman in
the in, before in his sleep Adam lost a Rib, but now (...) Reperit Costam, he
has his Rib again with (...) increase, branched into many Veins and Ribs,
and (...) and Arteries, of wonderful use, and admirabl^ (...). So the creation
of woman as it was for man, (...) out of man; Adam was made of the same of the
earth, and were it not to make woman proud, I would (...) was of that better
substance, of that well husbanded workeman-ship, and refined matter, refined
and (...) by the touch of his hands, in moulding to so exc^llent a proportion
as man, of a bone taken out of his side (which that side ever wants since as
Anatomists observe) to make him the more pliable toward her; not of a bone of
his foot, that she should be so low or contemptible, or of his head, so high
or ambitious, but of his side, a middle part, that she might be of a middle
condition, his fellow and companion, not his servant or slave, for Socij sunt
qui iunguntur lateribus, they are fellows that walk side by side: of a bone
near to his heart, to put him in mind of dilection and love; from under his
arm of protection and defense, etc. Now the Author of this creation we find
here to be the Author of this Mystery; He who made the woman of the man gave
her to the man, even God himself, who as Cassianus says further, in the very
prime and beginning of the world, Dedit, this Vnam Vni, gave this one woman to
one man, and no more then one, although for the increase and peopling of all
the yet uninhabited Regions and Kingdoms of the earth: In which, no doubt, the
Divine Wisdom had a respect to the love, not to the lust of man; aiming
hereby to advance the one, and suppress the other, for where love is divided
there it is weakened, can never be strong, and as we see by experience, he who
loves many formally never loves any fervently, for unity is loves number,
cannot transcend, and God would have an entire affection between the husband
and the wife, which he himself in person thus vouchsafed to honor by
conjunction, that as the^e bodies were then not two, so their desires should be
but one, and withal to insinuate by this his proper institution the more
respect and reverence to that holy ordination, which had so high a beginning
and so holy an end, honored by his Person, by his Prophets, by his Miracles,
and which should so generally be exercised, throughout all estates and
conditions, ages and times, to the end of the world, and decistency of all
things, which by this means (ere that eternal dissolution) should run a
long and continued race in despite of grave and death.

CHAP. II. Of the execellency of Marriage, with the consequence and use thereof.
THE excellency thereof does the more manifest it self in this, in that it was
an addition of beatitude and blessedness, to that happy and absolute estate
that Adam had in his first creation and innocence, that it was so precious
flower that it would not thrive but in so pure a soil, that God himself was
the Author to institute it, and the Priest to celebrate it, ere ever sin and
impurity had tainted the earth, or blemished the Angelical beauty of either
the Bride or Bridegroom; and though the consequence in that place brought
sorrow and death, yet has it a relation to as full, nay more ample joy and
life in the extent and determination thereof, then it could otherwise have had
in that first perseverance and fruiton, from which, though now by sin, our
best faculties, privileges and prerogatives, in all kinds, are so clowded,
eclypsed and fallen away, that we discern not aright the excellencies, true
uses and ends of so Divine a Mystery in it self, notwithstanding we do yet in
this twylight perceive such glimpses and sparkles of original purity and
felicity vnextinguished therein, that we are wedded by our own wills, and
induced by so natural a coaction to the embracement thereof for the mutual
society and comfort of life, without which it could neither subsist nor
continue, more then to any other duty or action therein, commanded or required
whatsoever.

From the excellency of the institution, come we to the excellency of the true
use, the danger of the contrary, and therefore the deep regard to be had
before hand, as in the enterprise it self, being of such weighty moment and
import of which one thus further displaying it, writes.

Marriage of all the humane actions of a man's life, is one of the greatest
weight and consequence, as thereon depending the future good, or evil, of a
man's whole aftertime, and days; that Gordian knot once fastened not to be
unloosed but by death, the means either to exalt an high to preferment, or
cast down headlong to destruction, and the present disposer of a man's whole
estate and fortune to his greatest joy or mysery, and therefore with his tale
pondus, (as before) not be danced into lightly or unadvisedly, with the first
that comes to hand, as a blind man lays his hold, but soberly entered upon
with mature advise, years, and deliberation, consent, and counsel of Parents
and Friends: For it is in this action as in a Stratageme of war: Wherein he
that erres can err but once, perishes unrecoverably to all after advice and
relief: And therefore that merry proverb is not amiss, that thus implies;
That in Wiuing and Thriuing, a man should ask counsel of all the world, it
being a matter of such difficulty, doubt, and danger to be resolved in; such a
continual storm and tempest to those that lanch not forth in a prosperous
gale, having perverted their felicity therein by running from the rule of God
in their choice, that (with Jonas) such to be delivered, were better be cast
alive into the Sea, to the belly of the Whale, and mercy of the merciless
bottomless deep (though with him they never came to shore again) then
endure such a perpetual vexation it is the harbenger unto, with such a
Leuiathan of the Land as is a furious woman: for as a virtuous woman is a haven
of beauty, so a wicked woman is a sea of evils, and in her tide more full then
that element of monsters, worse far to live with then a smoaky house, for that
for the most part, offends only the eyes in the head, but this all the senses
in the body: Nay, he that has such a Familiar, has a worse neighbor of his
own, then Horsam should have had, if her fabulous Dragon had been true: Yet
though in the curse it be subject to these evils, bless it in the true use,
and it is of all humane comforts the greatest; for if the mutual society
between friend and friend be so great, that in affliction it administreth
comfort, and in joy it heapeth the measure to the brime, by detracting from the
sour, and adding to the sweet, by a sensible participation of eithers
quality, how much more then shall it be enlarged by such a friend, which is to
us a second self, or Treasurer of our own thoughts, and therefore more
nearly interressed in either the one or the other.

Besides this, in thy Marriage, the very name whereof should portend unto theee
Merry-age, thou not only vnitest unto thy self a friend, and comfort for
society, but also a companion for pleasure, and in some sort a servant for
profit too, for a wife is all these: Besides, by the excellency and blessing
of this institution, thou continuest thy name, thy likeness, and thy
Generation walks upon earth, and so live in thy similitude, in despite of
death, when thou thy self art dead, and raked up in dust, and otherwise
without remembrance, unless by some ruinous stone, or ragged Epitaph, and so
(in some sort) make thy body immortal, like thy soul, and not only by this
do thou add to the Sons of the earth, but to the Saints of heaven; Besides,
by this so excellent, so honorably accounted of amongst all men are thy wild
and unbridled affections reduced to humanity and ciuility, to mercy and
clemency, and thou thy self called back to look into thy self, and to
understand the substance and truth of things, and therefore he that has no
wife is said to be a man unbuilt that wants one of his ribs, a sleep as
Adam was till his wife was made, for marriage awaketh the understanding as out
of a dream; and he that has no wife is said to be a man in the midst of the
sea, perishing for want of this ship to waft him to shore: Is said to be
parched in the heat of the Sun, that has not this Vine to rest him under
her shadow: If sickness come it brings thee a Physician; if health continue
it is partly a preserver. But to go further, to equal it with the best
commended Virginity, where is the man this day living whose Virginity may be
compared with Abraham's Marriage, in whom all the Nations of the earth were
blessed, S. Austin opposes it to the Virginity of S. John: But the greatest
authority we have in praise of Marriage, is the union of Christ with his Church
compared unto it: The Bond whereof is the holy Ghost, the contract the Gospel,
the Apostles the Registers, all married men, except S. John and S. Paul: And
Jesus Christ sealed it with his Blood, the betrothing whereof is here below in
the Church, but the wedding it self shall be solemnized in heaven: It is
likewise the original of all paires, of all couples, Primum par, fundamentum
parium says one, father and child, master and servant, husband and wife, all
grow out of this first union and conjunction, all kindred and affinity in the
world take their birth from this root, without which men would live dispearsed
like savage beasts and irrational creatures, without distinction or separation
of Tribe or family, which are the first parts of a Commonwealth.

CHAP. III. Worldly choice what it is, or how, for the most part men choose
their wives.
IT is a fashion much in use in these times to choose wives as Chapmen sell
their wares, with Quantum dabitis? what is the most you will give? and if their
parents, or guardians shall reply there virtues are their portions, and others
have they none, let them be as dutiful as Sara, as virtuous as Anna, as
obedient as the Virgin Mary; these to the wise man, every one a rich portion,
and more precious then the gold of Ophire, shall be nothing valued, or make up
where wealth is wanting; these may be adjuncts or good additions, but money
must be the principal, of all that marry, and (that scope is large) there are
but few that undergo it for the right end and use, whereby it comes to pass
that many attain not to the blessedness therein. Some undergo this curse in
steed of blessing, merely for lust choosing their wives most unfitly, as
Adulteresses, and such are said to marry by the eye, looking no further then a
carnal beauty is distinguished, which consists in the outward shape and
lyneaments of the body, as in gate, gesture, countenance, behavior, etc. And
for such a one so she be fair, and can kiss, she has portion enough for such
a Pirate: but when this flower withers, as it is of no continuance, for
diseases blast it, age deuoures it, discontent does wither it (only virtue is
not foiled by these adversaries) what shall continue love as then to the end,
there Winter sure shall be full of want, full of discontent, that thus
grashopper-like respected their Summer: There are others that marry to join
wealth, to wealth, and those are said to marry by the fingers ends: Some others
there are that take their wives from the report or good liking of others, and
those are said to take their wives upon trust, and such I hope are not seldom
deceived in their venture. There are some that marry for continuance of
posterity, and those come nearest to the true intent, for the end of marriage
is proles, issue; It was the primall blessing, Increase and multiply: God has
given and bequeathed many Precepts and Commandments to mankind, yet of all
that ever he delivered, never was there any better observed (for the letter)
then this: Nay, the most part are so ready to accomplish his Will herein, that
for have, many times, they ouerslip the true circumstances thereof, doing it,
Propter intentionem, praeter viam, for God requires Liberi, not Spurij;
children not bastards; and those that thus increase it, do it more for the
manner then the end, more for lust then for love.

CHAP. IIII. How to choose a good wife from a bad.
THis undertaking is a matter of some difficulty, for good wives are many times
so like unto bad, that they are hardly discerned betwixt, they could not
otherwise deceive so many as they do, for the devil can transform himself
into an Angel of Light, the better to draw others into the chains of
darkness, so these, his creatures, themselves into the shape of honesty, the
better to entangle others in the bonds of repentance: If therefore the yoke of
marriage be of such perpetuity, and lasting even Vsque ad naecem, and the joys
or grieuance thereon depending of equal continuance therewith, either to make a
short heaven or hell in this world, is not therefore to be undergone but upon
the duest regard, and most advised consideration that may be, and because it is
such a sea, wherein so many shipwreck for want of better knowledge and advise
upon a Rock, that took not better counsel in the haven, I have therefore, in
some sort, to prevent this danger, erected (as it were) certain Land-markes
and directions in the way, to give aim to such passengers as shall hereafter
expose themselves to the mercy of this fury, and the rather because our age is
so aduenturous, whether boldness or blindness be their guide, ye mere children
dare undertake with vessels scarce capable to hoyse up sail, and adventure
those passages, ye former tunes in their nonage, nere president us in the like,
would have thought scarce nauigable, but many times this calm that leads them
forth in a sunshine with pleasure, brings them home in a tempest with sorrow;
and therefore (as I said) he that would not repent him afterward let him be
advised before, for wise foresight for the most part is crowned with happy
success, therefore say not hereafter (for it is a weak remedy) Vtinam
saperem, would God I had been better advised, but be so.

The first aim that I would give to him, that would adventure this voyage (for
marriage is an adventure, for whosoever marries adventures, he adventures his
peace, his freedom, his liberty, his body; yea, and sometimes his soul too)
is, that in his election, after he has made choice of his wife, which ever I
would have grounded upon some of these promising likely-hoods, vid. that she be
of a sober and mild aspect, courteous behavior, decent carriage, of a fixed
eye, constant look, and unaffected gate, the contrary being oftentimes signs
of ill portent and consequence; for as the common saying is, an honest woman
dwells at the sign of an honest countenance, and wild looks (for the most
part) accompany wild conditions; a rolling eye is not fixed, but would fix
upon objects it likes, it looks for, and affected nicety is ever a sign of
lascivious petulancy.

Next regard, according as thine estate and condition shall best instruct thee,
the education, and quality, of her thou have so elected; her personage not
being unrespected, for love looks sometimes as well with the eye of the body,
as with the mind, and beauty in some begets affection, and affection
augmenteth love, whereas the contrary would decrease, and diminish it, and so
bring thee to a ^eath^d bed, which must be utterly taken heed of, for the
dangerous consequences that follow; therefore, let thy wisdom so govern
thine affection, that as it ceize not up deformity to thine own proper use,
for some sinister respect to be shortly after repented of; so likewise (for the
mean is ever best) that it level not at so high and absolute indowment and
perfection, that every carnal eye shall bethink thee injury, that every
Gotish disposition shall level to throw open thy enclosures, that thy wife
shall be harder to be kept then the Garden of the Hesperides, for as the
Italian proverb is, Whose horse is white, and wife is fair,
His head is never void of care.


Next after thou have thus elected thy choice, and considered her in her self,
with the aforesaid circumstances, and this one more (not being of his mind
that merrily said (speaking of his wife) since he was to make choice out of
things that were evil, he thought it most wisdom to choose the least) to
regard that she be not of too dwarfish a size, and kindred, to store thee with
a generation of Pigmies, dwarfes, half men, that want the Majesty and power of
height and strength, and the comeliness a good stature is for the most part
wedded unto: After this, a little look back to the stock from whence she
sprung, for as Ezekiell says, Like mother, like daughter; and experience and
nature approues it, that the fruit will relish of the Tree from whence it
sprung, as the Rose is not gathered from the Hauthorne, and as his Majesty well
observed, if men be so careful to have their horses and dogs of a good breed,
and race, which are only for external, and superficial uses and pleasures,
how much more should they then wives of their own bosoms, from whom they
expect to raise and continue their own generations and posterities upon earth,
to represent and preserve alive their own image and virtues behind them, from
generation to generation, vsque ad longuinqum, etc.

CHAP. V. What years are most convenient for marriage.
THe forward Virgins of our age are of opi on, that this commodity can never be
taken up too soon, and therefore howsoever they neglect in other things, they
are sure to catch time by the fore-locke in this, if you ask them this
question, they will resolve you fourteen is the best time of their age, if
thirteen be not better then that, and they have for the most the example of
their mothers before them, to confirm and approve their ability, and this
withal they hold for a certain ground, that be they never so little they are
sure thereby to become no less; the effects that, for the most part, ensue
thereafter, are dangerous births, diminution of stature, breuity of life, and
such like, yet all these pains will they adventure for this pleasure: Now as
these will not stay till their youth, but marry in their childe-hood, before
either blood, or affection rypen them thereto by their early forwardness, so
are their others that as much offend in the contrary, by passing over their
youth for certain cautionary worldly respects, to salute this society with
their age, like to him that has suffered his house to burn down to the
bottom, before he would seek to extinguish the flame, when the other, as
needlessly forward, as he foolishly slow, throws on water ere any fire come
near it; the extremity in both is utterly distasteful, and as I have already
showed briefly the indiscretion in either, so I might thus continue it further
along in the first: that such should take upon them to govern others that
(which as may well appear in this) know not yet how to govern themselves; the
latter, that they utterly abandon the right use of marriage, for if the chief
end thereof be propagation and increase, both for the Kingdom of earth and
heaven, why then do they defer so long till their blood be frosty, and their
bones be empty, their lamps be wasted, and their spirits consumed, hiding in
the earth their talents from use, which might have been otherwise multiplied
by a lawful usury, to a happy increase and excellent end, and therefore worthy
such of their just reward, which is (for the most part) to perish in themselves
as the last of their name and posterity upon earth.

Diogenes being asked what time of a man's life was best to marry, answered in
youth it was too soon, and in age it was too late, cynically insinuating
thereby that it was best never: Indeed some of our unfortunate conjunctions,
might have been happy embracing his counsel, when Planets of maleuolent
aspect and influence are unfortunately howsed, like two opposite poisons in a
stomach, one ever sick of of another, fearfully portending their own
destruction and ruin; yet not to discomfort any that are to enter herein, the
best good and most absolute perfection that ever was in the world, and most
general, never did all participate in the fruition thereof, although the
greatest number did; God gave sight to all, yet all partake not the benefit
thereof, health to all, yet some are daily encumbered with sicknesses, limbs to
all, yet some we see are decrepit and lame, although the most enjoy them,
these infirmities having in their being rather deficient then efficient causes,
for God created not blindness, lamenesse, sickness, or such like, but the
deprivation of their better opposites, is the cause of their producement and
effect: So likewise in marriage, God gave a general blessing to the first
institution and use thereof, He blessed it by his Word, he honored it by his
presence, he confirmed it by his miracles, where he turned water into wine,
to show that those that celebrate it in the right manner, to the lawful and
true end, shall have their sorrow turned into joy, their water into wine; but
the contrary, their joy into sorrow, that is, their wine into water.

One says, wives are young men's Mistresses, companions for middle-age, and old
men's Nurses, so that a man may have a quarrel to marry when he will: But the
Apostle says here, Rejoice in the wife of thy youth: As thereby he would
point out the fittest time; In thy youth whilst thou have blood in thy veins,
and marrow in thy bones, health in thy loins, and security in thy suffiency,
when thou may beget an offspring, and by course of time be so blessed, as to
see thy childrens children ingrafted into the Church, and Commonwealth, in
honorable Offices, and Functions, to thy peace of conscience, and quietness
in thy last Dimittis: Late repentance, they say, is seldom true repentance;
and it is obseruable, that in these late marriages is seldom found that true
comfort and happiness, which it is crowned withal in due season, therefore
begin not the world, divide not thy self, thy love, when thou art going out
of the world.

CHAP. VI. That conueniency and fitness in choice, is more to be regarded,
then either beauty, riches, or any other addition, of mind or fortune.
IN this one, and absolute greatest action of a man's whole life, men, for the
most part, are either so careless, in their will, or so blinded in their
judgment, or so carried away by affection, that they regard not that which
most materially concerns the peace, the welfare, and felicity of their whole
life and conservation therein; for their eye, for the most part, either ceizeth
upon beauty, and those are such that choose an Apple for the red side, as the
serpent deceived Eve, which afterward in the taste sets the teeth on edge: or
the heart upon riches, and they are rather married to the substance then the
owner: Some again marry for gentility, not respecting their own ignobility,
and baseness, which for the most part, it vpbraideth them with all their life
long; and though all of these are joined by the King (the Emblem of Wedlock)
yet few understand the Moral thereof, which is a representary fitness to be
respected: I mean not equality or fitness of stature, for the more equal
conjunction and action, but a fitness in affection, for as that being either
too big, or too little, pincheth the finger or stays not on, so where this
equality does not sympathy in affection there is either a falling off from the
bond of this duty, or a shrinking up of the joy and felicity therein: The
chollericke man, which for some outward respect, makes this his expected
heaven a hell, by unaptly conioyning unto himself provocation and impatience,
ever to kindle that fire a fresh which of it self consumes without further
addition, the very peace, and tranquillity, life, and spirit, of soul and body,
when as he should rather have elected, as an allayer to this fury meekness,
and indurance, such alenitiues, as should rather have wasted the malady, then
augmented the misery; for what concord, or society, can be expected to be
inioyde, when natures, more repugnant then the Elements, are joined in one:
free spirits, with miser dispositions, where they graple and tugge without ease
and releasement, for breath and liberty: Heroycall thoughts with dull
affections, where there is no correspondence to there height or elevation:
Knowledge with ignorance, where there is no zeal to communicate; and age with
youth, where there is no desire of inioyment, preventing the good by some blind
inducement, which either might have claimed by their likelihood, in more
suitable fitness, bearing the yoke with repining and displeasure, as pressing
too heavily, which otherwise might have been supported with ease and delight,
as scarce tasted or felt, Therefore (who ever thou art) know this in thy
choice, that would for bondage adventure thy freedom; that every good woman,
makes not for every man a good wife, no otherwise then some one good dish
digesteth with every stomach: therefore as for thy Trade thou will choose a
fit servant, for thy stomach a fit diet, for thy body fit clothing, so for
thy inseparable, daily, nightly society, choose a fit companion, according to
the Poets rule, in a lesser sense.

Elegat equalem prudens sibi quisque sodalem.
Let every wise and discret man,
Chose him a fit Companion.
The Thief for his Burglaries takes his fittest opportunity and society: The
Husbandman his seasons for his Seed time and Harvest: The Lawyer the advantage
of Assizes and Terms, The Merchant for adventure the Tide and the Winds, and
all these the fitness befriendeth the endeavor, and shall the husband then
think to establish his purpose, his peace, so great, and so greatly thereon
depending, without this vigilance and observance: The old rule will teach him
new wit, in this aptness, which says: He that a fit wise to himself does
wed,
In mind, birth, age, keeps long a quiet bed.


Art thou a remnant of the age of some mispended youth, fallen from the badge
of one baseness to another, as frowned out of some convenient Masters favor,
for not pleasing thy Mistress, that now to support thy creature, would
smoke thee out a living in some blind and conscious corner, smell thee then a
wife out a little tainted, the sweeter for thy purpose, and as apt to fall
down as thy vapor to fly up, taking care, (unless thou will disranke thy
self, or single out from the too too common shame and abuse in this kind) that
she be such a one as can take it, and being light can light it.

Art thou a Merchant, a Mariner, a Termer, choose thee a wife of some
Phlegmatic humor, that like a rich Creditor, with her large stock of
virtue, without breaking out, can forbear thee, upon occasion, a month or two,
a year or two, a Term, or voyage, least otherwise thou abroad, she prove
an Actor with thy Factor at home, or for thee, whilst thou labors for this
right in this case, do against thee that wrong in another, which no law can
help, nor prevention hinder, nor patience bear; if otherwise, though thou
escape the perils of the sea, thou art in danger of the Pirates of the Land; or
thou, though thou get a judgment at the Hall, shall be sure to have execution
against thee at home: And from whence else proceeds these lamentable ^arres of
households, worse then the open wars of Kingdoms, that devour and eat up
whole families: Whence proceeds these separations, exclamations, disiunctions;
whence arise they, but exhaled and drawn up with the heat of this
parabolicall sun, (the muck and mammon of the world) the beams whereof
blind the eye sometimes of conscience, as well of understanding and judgment:
whose conioyning of hands may resemble the league between the Low Countries
and Spain, where hearts can no more be brought to unity and affection one
another, then those ever vowed enemies thus taken truce: These respects I say,
like that respect of state, and no other, have prostituted, under one covering,
many a frosty January, and youthful May, many a green desire and gray
performance, which could no more cohabite then these different seasons,
otherwise aforehand meant, and afterward satisfied, though with a shameful
breaking out, to the ruin and destruction of both the one, and the other;
Mere Croanes, and many of my late remembrance, lip-bearded, as wiches, with
their warted antiquity and age, have angled into their beds with this bayted
golden hook, (for luker of desire and lust) on their parties, youth whose
chinnes have never yet fallen under the razor, less that way by their heat
and hair, expressing man then their wives, (wives) nay rather Matrons, and
Mothers, to their children prostituted, the shame and unevenness whereof has
even cracked this forementioned wreath in the ring, broke Pryscians head in the
unequal coniugations, the destruction whereof has not slowly followed, but
thus quickly, (like a Gangrene) crept on by a careless neglect in the one, and
earnest desire in the other, and a timely repentance in both: The one thus (to
his precedent aim) the better supported to his wild pleasures a broad, whilst
the other, with her frustrated intention and hope, all tame and penitentiary,
left destitute to bewail her grieuance at home. But go further, admit
impossibilities, that Age and Youth, Summer, and Winter could be one, yet how
would the Autumn with her tempests blast the Summer, and her tender buddes of
that season, and Summer, again, contradicting her contrary melting, her snowes
and frosts into nothing, what panges and travels, and throbbes, and throws,
would they sustain one with the other, till they brought an end and confusion
to both: even so admit, that youth could assume such a habit of gravity that
might like an age, and age again so shake off her vnnessaries, that she could
look amiable in the fresh and green eye of youth; yet must this mixture of
unequal heales be more pernicious to either, then those blasting contrary
seasons one to another: From these unequal conjunctions break forth those
maisterfull iealousies, those insupportable discontents, that have not set but
even in blood and death, ruined their owners, afflicted and wrung into
lamentations, their Friends, Allies, and Associates, and drawn blood from the
heart of any one that had but a hand or finger in the carriage: Many instances
of these we know of late times which we may remember, whilst I ouerpasse them
to recite one of more antiquity, as it is delivered by Tradition.

Stowes Survey.
An Aldermans wife, sometimes of London, her husband deceased, and she a rich
widow left, but as old in years, as rich in substance (more for desire of
portion then person) was solicited to an unequal banes and marriage, by a young
and courtly Gentlemen (and which afterward ended her bane) whose desire being
obtained, and he master of her substance, most leudly lauished it away upon
royotous and evil company, grew careless of her regard, and utterly abandoned
her society, both bed and board, which when with sorrow she perceived, with
her too late repentance, her self thus rifled of her goods, vpbraided of her
friends, forsaken of her husband, destitute of all comfort, she took the
evening to her mourning, went into a Spring near Shore ditch (a place that
takes the name from a like fatal accident) and there ended her days, and
sorrows by drowning, which Fount to this day is christened by her name, a
remembrance of her misery, and warning to aftertimes, and called (by her name)
Dame Annis a Clear. And therefore who ever thou art, entering into this common
garden of humanity, respect for thy better blessing and prosperity therein,
more then Beauty, Birth, or Riches, this Harmony and fitness, wherein is no
jar, no strife, no discontent, nor weariness, and which shall land thee
prosperously at the haven of thy rest, when this other, either tackling,
fraught, or sail, may endanger to perish thee in the flood.

CHAP. VII. What is that chief moath, and canker, that especially undermines
and fretteth the marriage bed.
PRide, Ambition, equality with others, the Example of others, variety of
Appetite, the vnrealishnesse of that which is lawful, desire of that which is
restrained, is unlawful, and then the oratory of the devil of darkness, in
the shape of an Angel of light, working upon these advantages has
overthrown, and betrayed, to this vulture, and his merciless talant, that
fort and Cittadell, with as easy resistencie as a Bower of glass, that should
be so unspotted, but more impregnable then a Bulwark of stone, admitted
treason to the heart of the City, copt with the most dangerous enemy in the
world, opened those gates with weakness, and this stratageme, that an Engine
should not assail with strength, and might, broke down the door that struck
dead the owner, laid open those enclosures, that have bondaged the Lord of the
soil perpetually till death, to enclose his own supposed interest and use:
Ambition and pride you twyn-borne sisters, you, you it is, and the dependancy
of your estate (you true and indulcitate yssues of Lucifer) that have broken
down this hedge of the greatest consequence and site that ever was erected,
and which else had kept out the assayling and seducing enemies that batter and
undermine the very supportance, root, and life-bloud of chastity it self,
letting in at these casements, evil conceits, and motives more blasting
thereto, then the breath of lightning, made the vows of marrriage of less
stability then the oaths of drunken men. Ambition, equality, example, you
forementioned evils, you foote-ball players which short-heeled creatures it is
you that are arraigned and found guilty in this trial.

The Country Damsel under the thacht roof of her natural habitation, where
she scarce ever thought of so much pride as handsomnesse, never beheld her how
otherwise presented then in a bowl of water, that dreamed more deuoutlier
under that innocent covering being asleep, then others pray in their lofty
Palaces being awake, who can scarce there remember marriage but she blushes
to think what a shame it is to lie with a man: yet afterward bring her to the
City, enter her into that school of vanity, set but example before her eyes,
she shall in time become a new creature, and such a strong mutation shall so
strangely possess her, that she shall have new thoughts, new purposes, and
resolutions, and in the end so shoulder out her modesty, that she shall not
blush to do that unlawfully, which before she was bashful to think on
lawfully: Come to the City, there you shall have some good amongst many bad,
but should have many more were it not for this sickness of this ill Example,
therefore well were it with the world, If what were most done, were most good:
Such a one could be content (for any desire of nouelty or change, or for any
heat in her blood, more then might be lawfully allayed) to be honest, but
that she knows such a friend, and such a Gentlewoman her Gossip, have their
variety of Gowns, of gifts, of favors, and variety of pleasures to,
interchanging with variety of persons, and in this regard she will be no
longer her own foe, to keep her self longer without such a friend, she sees
the world takes notice of no more then it sees, and they are accounted most
chaste, that can best seem so: In this resolution she pulls up the Floodgates,
where her tide of vanity is swelled to the brimme, which immediately ore-flowes
and drownes her therein, extinguishing all former sparks of virtue and
respect, which before this conquest she debated with, and bears her along
with the perishing multitude, for these brittle respects, that here she is
ensnared with.

The Court, the very Element and Center of these sins, the ne plus vltra, for
any example beyond that, being the pattern to it self, and to others, the
respects that join there, are the respects of pleasure, not of profit; the
highest ambition of theirs is to be most allured, most desired, to have most
servants, most friends, most favors, and these should presage most falls,
whose open out sides bosoms, were their insides so displayed, it would be
found a poor and idle sin had not there been harbored, whose satin
outsides, and silken insides, soft raiment and sweet feeding, so stroke the
skin, and persuade the blood that it will not be persuaded.

There is a Text in woman, that I would feign have woman to expound, or man
either; to what end is the laying out of the embrodred hair, embared breasts,
virmilioned cheeks, alluring looks, fashion gates, and Artfull countenances,
effeminate, intangling, and insnaring gestures, their curles and purles of
proclaiming petulancies, boulstred, and laid out with such example and
authority in these our days, as with allowance and beseeming conueniency, such
apish fashions and follies, that the more seuerer out-worne ages of the world,
deceased and gone, should they have but lifted up their head and in their times
would have hyssed out of countenance to death: But as to please, woman has
much starched up man from his slouenry, so to delight man (or rather his enemy)
has the woman thus increased in prides, does the world wax barren through
decrease of generations, and become like the earth, less fruitful then
heretofore: Does the blood loose his heat, or the Sunne-beames become more
watrish and less fervent then formerly they have been, that men should be
thus inflamed and persuaded on to lust: or has this age of sin usurped such
a seeming purity, or thought, that the most licensed lust, has the original
from concupisence or some taint of sin, and therefore must be thus dragged
up to this anchor, like a Pitcher by the ears, by these blood neare-touching
witcheries, and inducements, no, rather the contrary witness the superfluity
and increase of these our times, of this our Kingdom, that has more people
then pasture, more bringing forth then breeding, for that it is compelled to
empty it self into far distant Regions and Kingdoms: Is it not rather the
contrary, when the youth of both sexes are daily cropped in the blossom by this
forward motion, or rather headstrong devil, and vnripely pressed to that
action, forestalling maturity and fitness, where a Vestall should be more
pointed at in a Cloister, then a Comet in the Air: Is it not rather the
contrary, when lust is grown so unbounded, so headstrong, that it will not
be hemmed nor incircled within any Laws, or limits, of God, or man; when it
will garbadge without all respect, or control, upon Adultery, fornication,
possessed, the vnpossest, the bond, the free; where care shall more possess a
man to keep his fair wife from foul play, when he has her, then iealousy
did to loose her, when he first riual'd for her; where virtue shall not so
disguise it self in any habit, but vice will trace it out and betray it. The
ignorant Papists, or other sectaries of Heresies, most commonly give no other
reason for their seduced errors, then example of multitude, of parents,
progenitors, or friends that went before them; so the example of this evil, so
common, so much made of, so cockred, so thriuing, so bedecked, so admired, so
dandled on the lap of Greatness, of Authority, draws millions to perdition
after it, for the greatest part never look further then the example of the
greatest number; the Coach easily runs that is drawn wtth many horses, soon
follows one where thousands lead the way: These have disioyned in chambers by
the devil, that were conjoined in the Church by God, and yet it must be
ingenuously confessed, it is but a cold comfort, to go to hot hell for company:
Lust, that boiling damned putrefaction of the blood, that raging, ruling,
headstrong sin of this age, that is too apt to break out, though it went
clothed in Sacke-cloth, and Hairecloath, and fed only (as says an Author)
with the Capuchin diet of grass and herbs, and such like, and suppressed with
all the subjection can be imposed to subdue it, that yet like lime it would
flash and fly out through out all these impositions: but on the contrary, we
are so far from subduing that passion, and keeping it under, by any such
means, that it is attired and set out in the most Artfull bewitching, and
enticing temptation that may be devised, whole days and nights, and thoughts
and studies, and costs and cares, cast away thereon, for the better success
therein, though the worse ill thereby, for the end thereof is but repentance
and sorrow.

Another maine enemy, to open this breach, is impatience of restraint and
limitation, for that which is most forbidden is most desired; He is the old
devil that still tempts in that likeness that came to Eve in Paradise, and
persuaded her to eat the forbidden fruit of the Tree of knowledge of good and
evil, upon whom he obtained such a victory and conquest, in that first battle
that ever was fought, that never since has he distrusted the force of that
stratageme: Every woman is an abridgement of all womankind, contains the
shape, the proportion, the lyniaments, the members, the use of all the women in
the world, and likewise so of man; why should not desire then, being so linked
in the most sufficient, and wisest allowance, that God and man thought meet,
couch and submit it self to these ordinances, but that concupiscence and lust,
inkindle desire, and it finds not delight in that it has, but in that it
would have, according as the Poet verifyeth.

Lust nere takes delight in what is due,
But still leaves known delights to seek out new.
It looks out of the window, where fuel is administered where temptation
enters in: edgeth it self upon one for respects that it can conceive but not
utter; upon an other, for some thing it likes, but knows not what; It makes
choice of a third, for modesty baits his lust in that flame, to think with
what looks it could look in conclusion, that is so fiered with blushes in but
proffered, concerning circumstances, though far distant and remote from
either time or action: Upon a fourth, for her quaint conceit, and discouers by
debating how she could use it, being put to her non plus, in the bare point of
trial, with the beauty of a fifth, to conceive what a large fruition it were to
be inflamed on the promontory of the Hill, when the demeanes, and adjacent
Valleys, to that fuller surfeit, restrained not their shades nor fountains: And
indeed, to conclude, there is none so ugly, none so deformed, but Lust will
find argument to make use of it, may it but have means to enjoy it.

CHAP. VIII. Advice for choice, and whether it be best to marry a Widow, or a
Maid.
He that marryeth a Widow, has but a reuersion in tail, and if she prove
good, may thank death for his aim, if evil, vpbraide him, and not unjustly
for his occasion: He that takes her thus halfe-worne, makes account she has
that will pay for new dressing, she seems to promise security in her peace,
yet inuites many times to a troublesome estate, when the conquest achieved
scarce counteruailes the wars, the principal of her love is perished with
the use, for what is once firmly set on, can never be cleanly taken off, and
he must nere look to be enriched that way that has her. The end of her
Marriage is lust and ease, more then affection or love, and deserve what thou
can, the dead shall vpbraide thee by the help of her tongue, flattered
behind his back, the more to vex thee to thy face: The best is, though the
worse for thee, they are nauigable without difficulty, more passable then
Virginia, and lie at an easier Rode, as unsatiate as the sea, or rather the
grave, which many times ye sooner presents them thither: At the decease of
their first husbands, they learn commonly ye tricks to turn over the second
or third, and they are in league with death, and coadiutors with him, for they
can harden their own hearts like iron to break others that are but earth; and
I like them the worse that they will marry, dislike them utterly they marry so
soon, for she that so soon forgets the flower and Bridegroom of her youth,
her first love and prime of affection (which like a color laid on in Oil, or
dyed in grain, should cleave fast and wear long) will hardly think of a
second in the neglect and decay of her age. Many presidents we have against
these sudden, nay against these second Marriages derived from former times,
the ages of more constancy, and shame of these latter. The daughter of M. Cato,
bewayling a long time the death of her husband, being asked which day should
have her last tear, answered the day of her death (not the end of a month or
year) for (says she) should I meet with a good husband, as I had before, I
should ever be in fear to loose him, if with a bad one, I were better be
without him. In like manner, Portia, a young and honorable Lady, having lost
her husband, answered, solicited by another, A happy and chaste Matrone never
marries but once. Valeria, having lost her husband, importuned by another,
answered; My husband ever lives in my thoughts. Arthemesia, the wife of Mausoll
King of Corinth, could not not be brought to any such action, but still
answered, being mindful of her husband deceased, Upon thy pillow shall never
second rest his head; She dyed a widow, and in memory of her husband, erected
that Monument, or Tomb, the cost and fame whereof has ouerspread the world:
which Wife and Monument, Lucinius thus further commends.

Rex dudum erat, etc.
There was a King, of whom it may be read
In ancient Stories, sepulchred ere dead.
More wrong you will say they did him, to deprive
Him of his Kingdom thus he being alive.
(...)
No he had all his rights, more then Kings have
That ruled a Kingdom, and reigned in his grave.
A Kingdom, nay a little world and more,
A great world, and respected as before.
Nay, even a Regiment that has disturbed,
The ablest health and policy to curb.
A woman's heart and mind, and which more strange
Free from variety of thought or change:
So willingly subjected to his blood,
Never to depose him whilst her Empire stood.
Of whom all loves and Laws did firm remain
In force, till one stone did enclose them twain.
Of whom it may be said, now she is gone,
There Is few such Toombes erected, women none.
Such a Widow could thou marry she were worthy thy choice, but such a one
she could not be, because she would not then marry.

Compare the loyalty of our times with those of more ancient, and see how they
equal thy conscience and carkase breaking, how with thy piled up chestes, they
build monuments of remembrances to thy name and memory after death; nay rather
observe, but how their ambition, thus heated makes them forgetful of
themselves as well as thee: Knowing this, who would not, with these
distraughted times, to leave the purchase of a Ladyship to his wife, glide like
a shadow in his life upon earth, with a shrinking inside, and penurious
outside, and sleep with broken thoughts and distracted dreams to gather with
pain, and forbear with want, that which his living enemy may afterward spend
with pleasure and surfeit with fullness. Who can love those living that he
knows will so soon forget him being dead, that are but Summer Swallows for
the time of felicity, that will hang about ones neck as if they had never
arms for others embracing, or as though extreme affection without control
could not but this manifest it self and break out; yet decease, and such a
lethe of forgetfulness shall so soon or^rake thee as if thou had never
been, nay so little a quantity of time shall confine it, that she shall not
lie in her month but she shall be Churched again, and open to another all
thy fruitions, with as fresh and plenteous an appetite as the harlot to her
next sinner. Younger brothers, and poor Knights, may sometimes to these
monsters make use of their byrths and Titles, making them pay dear (as it
cost) for their dubbing, and release of Purgatory they are in with old rank
and fashion to their new Eliseum, and instaulement; and it must be confessed,
unwise they were, but with good boot and addition, to refuse a Virginity to
accept a Widdow-hood, and yet many times with a Turkish fate, we pay dear for
our Credo quod habemus, that article of Belief we too fondly build upon, when
we pay for the jewel that another has stolen, and in hope of treasure
embrace ye ransackt casket, yet they are too blame that have thus been to
blame, and for their easy punishment their first night shall discover them. Be
not sudden therefore upon thy resolution in this point, because deceit, many
times, lurkes in a modest face, but let long acquaintance, or inquiry, ye more
secure thee. The Country deceiues the City, and the City again returns it
with interest, and lust so reigns in both, that there is scarce ye quantity of
virgins to be found in either to match the Parable in the Scripture; they have
faces more fairer then men, but hearts more deformed then devils: It is ill
building upon a broken foundation, amendment may skin the soar, but the
scarce will long after retain a blemish, yet no doubt free thought, which is
free, and dreams and wishes, which are but shadows, though the rilling
ruffians that break through all bosoms, and superficially ravish all woman
kind, from eight to eighty, and no doubt from actual transgressions many may
be found free, for there was never infection so general but it spared some,
never battle so great that all were wounded, some of Eues Offspring have
withstood the temptation, all have not tasted the forbidden Tree; and such a
one if thou can pray, to prey upon, she has portion enough without other
portion if she thus continue it, for she shall make thee a father of
undoubted children, she shall not wrinkle thy thoughts with distracting
iealousies, nor vpbraide with a former husband thy unkindness; her Maiden
thoughts shall receive from thee a more perfect impression of love and duty,
and return it back more legibly indorsed and written, free from all former
character, inscription, or soil; her affection shall be strong, not allayed by
former wearing, she shall be such a one as it is a heaven to live with all, a
mysery to mourn without, she shall be to thy senses and delight as the
budding Rose in the youth of the spring, nay shall be such a one, that, He
that walks by thy door shall point at her, and he that dwells by her shall
envy him that has her, and every man shall admire his hap, but he most fully
rejoice and be glad that has her, and all generations shall call such blessed.

CHAP. IX. Since the end of Marriage is issue, whether it be lawful for old
Couples to marry that are past hope of Children, or whether it be lawful, for
an old man to marry a young Maid, or the contrary.
THe chief end of Marriage is proles, Issue, yet there are other respects in
that covenant, that no doubt may tolerate the most ancient in this kind: God
saw that it was not good for Adam to be alone therefore he made him an helper,
and Saint Paul says, Rather marry then burn, and as it is in another place;
Vae solus: Woe to him that is alone, for if he fall he has not one to help
him up: Now those in age, to come nearest to a common and sub-correctiue
understanding, are most defective in their members, and therefore most subject
to fall, and so by consequence most need of this help to raise them up, of
this staff for their stay, and besides for ought that ever I could hear, or
observe, that age is most prove to scortch it self in the flames of that fire,
and therefore may lawfully partake the remedy against it, and for the latter
proposition, for ought I see, the Law forbids not the act, But the
circumstances may breed some danger, for if the wife be young enough, though the
husband be nere so decrepit, she shall not be out of all likelihood to see
increase of her body, but he that thus undertakes to manage in his age, what
has shaked the heart of youth, may be commended for his valor, but shall nere
be crowned for his wisdom; And for such a one (I trust) he shall not need to
be jealous, for that his doubt shall be apparently enough resolved. One asked
Diogenes, upon a time, for some direction how to choose a wife, because he was
a Philosopher, says he unto him, fellow, choose one without a head (if thou
can) without a body, and without lims, so her hands shall not offend in
striking, nor her tongue in railing, nor her body in lusting: Another time
seeing a man in his old age going to Church, to make up his second Marriage,
said; O fool, have thou so lately been shipwracked, and wilt needs to sea
again. The Law of God, nor man, does not forbid such Marriages, but no policy
in earth commends them; man and wife should be two in one: but can heat and
cold, youth and age, be in one and not be repugnant, he that adventures so
for sweet meats, shall find them relished with much bitter sauce, they say
the Oak would longer last, were it not for the intwyning and embracing Iuy,
but in this case I entend the contrary, for the aged Oak here blasteth the
younger, Iuy with the heat of youth, must again renew, according to our Poet.

No sharper corsiue to our blooming years,
Then the cold badge of Winter blasted heirs.
Many worldly respects may conioyne these Marriages, but this sudor will crack
in the wearing, and he that so old seeks for a nurse so young, shall have pappe
with a Hatchet for his comfort.

CHAP. X. The difference between Love and Lust.
Lust, the destroyer of Love, the supplanter and vnder-myner of chastity, the
Spring-frost of beauty, the tyrant of the night, the enemy of the day, the most
potent match-maker in all Marriages under thirty, and the chief breaker of all
from eighteen to eight, that protests that in a hot blood that it nere
performs in a cold, a regarder only of the present, and to that effect will
with Esau sell a birthright for a mess of pottage, no longer esteeming the
object then the use, which in like example is thus further followed, according
to a more common observance.

Friends, Soldiers, Women, in their prime
Are like to Dogs in Hunting time:
Occasion, Wars, and Beauty gone,
Friends, Soldiers, Women, there are none.
More dangerous, when it roues without lymites, then the Lion without the verge
of his grate; for he but only would deprive the body of life, but this both of
life and soul, and fame, subject to more opposite immediate passions and
contradictions in it self then any sense or humor in the nature of man: as
now well entreated, fairly spoken, lodged where it best likes, anon hated
without enduring, cursed ont of charity, thrust out of doors, and yet not only
though all this more immediately opposite, then preposterously fondly headlong,
that for a minutes joy, will incur a months sorrow, that for one drop of
water will mud the whole fountain that gave it, for one sweet fruit will
blast the whole Tree that bare it; whereas the effect and force of love is
contrary, opressing folly, suppressing fury; aiming to preserve, not to
destroy, and to that end, regards the end, by subduing passions and motives
that would seem to oppose the tranquillity thereof, and in conclusion rejoices
in the true fruition without discontent, without satiety, having captiuated and
subdued, though with some difficulty, those passions that sense for a time
would have been best pleased with, to triumph at last in more full fruition to
that purpose that one thus writes.

Love comfort like sunshine after rain,
But lusts effect is tempest after sun.
Loves golden spring does ever fresh remain,
Lusts winter comes ere summer half be done.
In Love there is no envy, no iealousy, no discontent, no weariness, for it
digesteth and makes sweet the hardest labor, and of all things does the
nearest resemble the Divine Nature, for God is Love, it has in it unity
without division, for true love has not many objects, it is a fire much water
cannot quench: Now Lust contradicts all these, for whereas Love is bounded
with easy lymites, Lust is more spacious, has no mean, no bound, but not to
be at all, more deep, more dangerous then ye Sea, and less restrained, for
the Sea has bounds, but it has none; not woman but all womankind is the
range thereof, and all that whole sect not able to quench it neither: Full of
envy it is, for it enuies all without his reach, and enuies it own nature that
it cannot be satisfied: walking for the most part in similitude of an old
Goat, in the shape of an incontinent man.

In Love there is no lack, in Lust there is the greatest penury, for though it
be cloyed with too much, it pines for want: Ambitious it is, for where it
treades it puffes up, and leaves a swelling after it, turns low flattes into
little Mountains down, which precipitate folly tumbles headlong to confusion,
a hasty breeder of disinheritable sinners it is, such as have more pleasure in
the begetting, then comfort in the bringing forth, best contented when it
loses most labor. To conclude, though Love and Lust in a half brotherhood,
dwell both under one roof, yet so opposite they are that the one, most
commonly, burns down the house that the other would build up.

CHAP. XI. The best way to continue a woman chaste.
IS not the Magitians Ring, nor the Italians Lock, nor a continual Iealousy
ever watching over her, nor to humor her will in idle fancies, adorn her with
new fangels, (as the well appayed folly of the world in this kind can
witness) but for him that would not be basely mad with the multitude, would
not bespeake folly to Crown him, would not set that to sale that he would not
have sold, for who sets out his ware to be cheapned and not bought, that would
not for his Shop have his Wife, for a relative sign) is to adorn her
decently, not dotingly; thriftily, not laciuiously; to love her seriously, not
ceremoniously; to walk before her in good example (for otherwise how can
thou require that of thy wife that thou art not, wilt not be thy self, Vis tu
vxorem tuam victricem esse and tu victus iaces: Would thou expect thy wife a
conqueror when thou thy self lie foiled at the same weapon) to acquaint her
with, and place about her good and chaste society, to busy and apply her mind
and body, in some domesticke, convenient, and profitable exercises, according
to her education and calling, for example to the frailty of that whole sex,
has a powerful hand, as it shall induce either to good or evil.

There are of opinion that there is in Marriage an inevitable desteny, not to
be avoided which is either to be Acteon'd, or not to be, if it be not, as is
the opinion of some damned in the error of Predestination, then let him take a
house in Fleete-streete, divide it like an Inn, into as many several lodgings
as rooms, make his wife Chamberlain to them all, attire her like a sacrifice,
paint her out like a Mayors posts, or May-poole, let her have fresh youth and
high feeding, lustful company to incite her, her husband absent: all these
opportunities present, yet notwithstanding this desteny shall preserve him, to
wear his brow as sleeke, as he that near fetched again the lost ribbe to
his side, as vnbunched as the front of a Batchelour; But if the contrary, be
she the most pure in seeming, a very sister of that Sect, the opinion of the
B^ownists shall so near cleave to her skin, that she shall besate thy
forehead in thy sleep, kill thee dead in that image of thy grave; Be she
Papist, absolution shall so resolve her, that she shall sin upon
presumption, nay though thou had Argus eyes thou shall not escape it, for No
policy, they say, can that prevent,
Whereto two parties give their full consent.


Be she what she will in this case, it shall be all one for thee to
restrain or to give liberty, where thou dwell or what thou do, for thy
desteny is so allotted and it shall be accomplished: The rash opinion, and
careless security of either is worthy the reward, which for the most part, it
does deservedly receive.

It was an error in Religion that one Ludouicus had, who had given himself
over to this damnable opinion and security of the devil, that if he were
ordained to be saved, saved he should be without any enquiry or diligence
of his; if otherwise, though he toyled to death in his best endeavor, it would
not help nor reserve him; In this conceit, settling himself in the most
Epicurian and disolute course of living that might be, he continued, till
upon a time he fell into a most grievous extremity of sickness, when sending
for a Physician, who before hand acquainted with his damnable error, came not,
but sent him word that he needed not his help, for if his hour were come he
could not preserve him, if otherwise, he should recover though never any thing
were administered unto him; by which easy application he understood himself,
and that he must use the best means and endeavor, as well for the safety of
his soul, as the preservation of his body, not knowing the event of their
concealed ends, and so at once (by that means) was happily cured both in mind
and body.

In no less palpable error are those, that so wittingly and violently, are
carried on either side in this dangerous stream of a corrupted judgment to
the apparantest spectacle and certaintest shame that woman may do them, making
that unquestionable their dishonor by this consequence, which a sober course
might have directed to a more certain end, Therefore who ever thou art that
would not wink at such a shame, that so profit does succeed, would not
regard whether hand brought it in, use a good endeavor, such foresight and
wariness as may provide for competency, prevent indigence and want two great
allayers of affection, and a maine inciter of impatient bearers to this folly
and abuse, and above all seek to plant in her Religion, for so she cannot love
God but withal she must honor thee, increase her knowledge in good things,
and give her certain assurance and testimony of thy love, that she may with
hers again the more reciprocally equal thy affection; For true love has no
power to think, much less act amiss: And these discreetely put in practice
shall more preserve at all times, and temptations, then Spies, or Eyes,
Jealousy or any restraint, for these sometimes may be deluded, or over
watched, or prevented by opportunity, but this never.

CHAP. XII. The pattern of a bad husband, and a good wife, in two Letters
instanced.
1 LETTER.
FAIR Mistress, what so long I have expected,
And till this opportunity neglected,
Is now so happened as it would inuit
Me to enjoy my absolute delight.
Your husband absent, and your servants gone,
And you, but with your Maid, left all alone.
Where least sad Care, or Melancholy grieve you,
My best endeuour's ready to releive you.
What Female Comfort can one woman find,
Within the bed with other woman-kinde?
What tedious gate the yrksome hours do keep,
When there is no joy to wake, no mind to sleep?
Besides, the fearful terrors of the night,
Which women and weak minds do much affright:
All which, fair love, if you will be ruled by me,
We will convert so far from what they be
That those which now are bitter for to think,
Shall taste like Nectar that the Gods do drink.
The strangest Monster that was ever bred,
That Seas have nourisht or else Desert fed,
Transported from his solitary den,
A common object to the sight of men,
Loses his admiration and delight,
In little time, and pleases not our sight:
Our Appetite, the Viand nere so good,
Cloyd with one Dish will soon distaste her Food;
That Music of all other best we deem,
If ever in one Key we harsh esteem:
Man's nature does desire to hear and try
Things that are new, to taste variety;
And I of Women this opinion hold,
They are not much in love with things are old,
Which makes me thus more boldly to discover
My self unto you, your new friend and lover:
In hope to be accepted, for whose pleasure,
I Will spend my best life, and my dearest treasure.
Object not you already are inioy'd,
With Venus pleasures dul'd and ouercloid.
Why joyful Widows when their husbands die
Might this object, but yet you see they try;
Because they think variety of men,
May make old pleasures new delights again.
She that contents her self with any one,
For many nights as well might lie alone.
Less difference is not twixt the virgin life,
And state of pleasure, being called to wife
Then is between the Elizeum of one Bed,
That crosly fated, to that is largely-sped.
I have a wife my self, I tell you true,
Yet in the old kind seek for pleasures new:
Taking not now delight that I have took,
To shake the Tree that I so often have shook.
We see in any Country that we dwell,
The Air the Earth, nay All that others tell:
Yet notwithstanding it is our commonst fashions,
To seek out other Kingdoms other Nations.
Each woman does abridge all woman-kinde,
But yet one woman fits not each man's mind:
Nor every man, experience too too common,
Can fit, can please, or satisfy each woman.
Since then the Sense, the Appetite and mind,
In fresh variety all pleasure find;
Let us then meet all nice respects to smother,
And fully satisfy and joy each other:
So shall I rest by your obligement due,
A secret friend and faithful servant true.
The world can judge no further then it spies,
And where we act shall be from sight of eyes,
Windows nor walls, can neither hear nor see,
And for the bed it is tried for secresy:
Then seem but chaste, which is the chiefest part,
For what we seem each sees, none knows the heart.
And so your husband, and the world will deem,
You to be that you are not, but do seem.
Your husband he is abroad, where I Am affray'd
He has deserved to be so appay'd.
My Chain here take you, wear it for my sake,
And as you find me yours account so make.
And here is my Ring in earnest of a friend,
The latest Token that my Wife did send.
And here is my Purse, within it store of Gold,
Able to batter down the strongest Hold:
Your dainty lymbes shall be more neatly clad,
In costlier Raiment then they erst have had:
And for your stomach it shall not digest
Any thing, but the rarest, and the best.
These daily from me with a pleasing cheer,
Which husbands grutch to part with once a year.
Though for their maintenance I sell my land,
Disherite heirs for that I will not stand:
So you be mine in that sense I conceive you,
Which till your answer manifest, I leave you.
HER REPLY.
ABused sir, much grieved am I to see,
That you so long have tarried Time and Me,
And now when both your good seem to conspire,
They should in no sort answer your desire:
My husbands absence seems to import
In your conceit some hope to scale his fort;
But know by that you small advantage find,
For he is always present in my mind:
The thought of whom, what ere his person be,
Is able to repulse your battery.
And for the hours that you so tedious deem,
That by your presence would so shortened seem:
I cannot tell with others what 't might do,
With me 'twould rather make one hour seem two:
And for the fearful terrors of the night,
What could affright me worse then would your sight.
My Maid and I, a pleasure not repented,
Will tell old Stories long ago euented
To pass the time, or when such watch we keep,
We Will think good thoughts, or pray until we sleep:
For know my untainted mind did ever hate,
To buy damnation at so dear a rate:
To taste sweet Nectar for a day or hour,
And ever after to digest the sour.
It Is not variety I seek or crave,
My whole delight is in the one I have:
And she that is not contented with her lot,
I hold more monster then the Sea has got.
The friendship which you proffer me preserve,
For those that will your kindness more deserve.
The objection here you allege is fondly strange,
That women, though old clothes they love to change
And fancies to in something, doth't infer
That in this gross point they must therefore err.
I am another parcel I confess,
And you by your acknowledgement no less,
Now what a sin were this unworthy life,
I so to wrong my husband, you your wife:
My husband that dare swear that I am just,
Should I so much deceive his honest trust?
Your wife, although a party I not know,
I hope imagines likewise of you so.
For shame go then repent and be not naught,
Be worth her good opinion, honest thought.
Let fleshly widows when their husbands die
They nere did love, seek new variety:
For me I vow, if death deprive my bed,
I never after will to Church be led
A second Bride, nor never that thought have,
To add more weight unto my husbands grave,
In second husband let me be accursed,
None weds the second, but who kills the first.
You have a wife you write, give her your love,
And that will all your wandering thoughts remove;
You love her not, by these effects I see,
For where love is there is no satiety.
Can you so far forget humanity,
As having shook the fruit despise the Tree:
It is not love but lust, that thus abuses,
To make it weary of the walks it uses.
Coelum non Animum, etc.
Those that to foreign Countries do repair,
Change not their minds, although they change the Air,
Preferring still, through nouelty desire,
Their Countries smoke, before another fire.
Like use observe unto your self to take
From the objection that you seem to make:
That though you see of beauteous women many,
And you by choice possess the mean of any,
More to respect her you your wife have made,
Then others sunshine, to your proper shade.
Suppress that lust, that soul and body wounds,
For where it once breaks ore, it has no bounds,
One woman does abridge all womankind,
The volume then at large why would you find:
For sure I think where that does bear no prize
The Book at large might weary, not suffice.
An other Argument to back your suit,
You allege that walls and windows will be mute,
And that the world has no such peircing eye,
The secret of the dark to search and try:
As if there were not one, whose power impartes,
To see through Doors, and Windows, and through Hearts,
From whose bright eye, no secresy can hide,
That which is guilty and would not be spide,
Then what auailes to have the world aquite us,
When our Conscience like a fiend shall fright us.
And for the Bed although it cannot tell,
Yet out their shame will break that do not well.
My husband he is from home I must confess,
Whose acts you measure by your guiltiness,
But where so ere he be, well may he speed,
Ere any such thought from my heart proceed:
Admit he were in evil so compact
Would I revenge the wrong by such an act,
If that I should, were it not a helpelesse part,
To kill my soul because he brake my heart.
Your Chain of Gold here back again I send,
I Will no Earnest sure of such a Friend:
And there is your Ring, full little does she know
That sent in love, that you would use it so:
And there is your Purse, and all the Gold therein,
The're Wicked Angels that would tempt to sin.
My Fort is more impregnable then they.
That much persuade, although they little say.
As for my bodies homely clothing weed,
It keeps me warm, suffices natures need,
Which scarce more costlier do, and for my fare,
My dishes wholesome, though they homely are.
Let those that discontented do abide,
Go wrong their husbands to maintain their pride,
For me the meanest ragge would hide my skin,
Should better please me, then rich roabes of sin,
Which when I ask, my reason shall be such,
No husband in the world shall need to grutch.
Then for your heirs, reserve your lands unto them,
They shall not curse my bones that did undo them.
Call back your self and think I am your friend,
That thus would stay you from your wilful end:
Call back your self, or I may safety tell
You are running down the steepest hill to hell;
As when cold blood, and better thoughts shall show,
You Will hold then your friend, though now your foe:
And more rejoice in that I did refell,
Your lawless pleasure, then consent: Farewell.
CHAP. XIII. An admonition to Husbands and Wives for unity and concord.
IN that you are bound, you must obey, for this knot can neither be cut nor
unloosed, but by death, therefore as wise prisoners enclosed in narrow rooms
suit their minds to their limits, and not impatient they can go no further,
augment their pain by knocking their heads against the walls, so should it
be the wisdom both of Husbands and Wives, that have undergone either this
curse, or blessing, as the success or use may make it unto them, to bear it
with patience and content the asswager of all maladies, and misfortunes, and
not to storm against that which will but the deeper plunge them in their own
misery: For what madness were it for any one to cross himself daily, because
another has crossed him once? or because another has vexed him, therefore to
vex himself? Who is so weak in discretion, that by some disaster having
blemished one eye, for grief thereof, will weep out the other. That mother
tries a merciless conclusion: Who having two sweet Babes, when death takes one,
Will slay the other, and be nurse to none.


Therefore seeing it is so, whosoever thou art in this disaster, seek to plant
an affection and love, at least wise a patience to that which must of necessity
be endured: for there is nothing so easy that the want of this may not make
hard: nor nothing so harsh that this may not better temper: there are many
occasions that this age administreth more then former have done of the use of
this armor, (though all other rust by the walls of peace) introduced by the
ouer-curious respects of secondary causes by secndary persons, that for these
uses perish the principal, by joining hands where hearts are more dis-iunctiue
then different sectaries: and what is the issue of this but a weary patience,
or sudden destruction. Others conioyne them selves by untimely folly, and these
many times have a timely repentance when pleasures ebb, and sorrows begin to
flow. As for instance, a youth of able means, hopeful expectation, equal
carriage, regardfully befriended, carefully watched over, purposed to better
destiny, pricked on by some rebellious blood, and guilty opportunity, strikes
down all these hopes in the heat of his lust, with a greasy Kitchin-weneh in a
corner, ceizeth her to his proper use for unlucky consequences, this being
done, oppressed in mind, forsaken of his friends, shall he the more augment
his misery, by thought of this his perverted felicity, with rage, and evil
suffering, no rather let him love her, since it was his fortune to have her, and
his fault to take her, and endeavor so to work and husband that cross
beginning, to a more happy continuance and ending, taking S. Paul's counsel to
his practice, which thus advises, Husbands love your wives, and be not bitter
unto them: Love them for your own peace, for your own profit, dwell with
them according to your wisdoms as with the weaker vessels, for there is no
offense where love is, for love covers the multitude of offenses, of
dislikes, and because the rather that God instituted it, who Himself is Love;
setting aside contention, domesticke civil, uncivil strife, the forerunner of
ruin and the Purgatory upon earth; remembering whoeuer they be that fall into
this predicament, they have before God and man by joining of hands, taken an
everlasting peace one of another, more inuiolably to be kept then the leagues
of Nations; for as nothing is more odious in the sight of God or man, then
self violence against a man's own person, and there was never any enraged that
way but wanted either reason or faith in the deepest discontent; so then by
this consequence he must either be mad or desperate, that shall to that end
lay hands on his wife, being pact of himself, for they are no more two but
one, as Adam and his Rib at first were but one side till severed and divided
from him, so after by marriage it was conjoined again to as absolute unity as
before, after which he pronounces and thus witnesses of himself: She is
flesh of my flesh, and bone of my bone, he the head, and she as part of the
members, which so being, to be divided and at odds, were as ye hand to lift
up, or the foot to kick against the head, the King and Goueruernor, or the
head against these his instruments, supporters, and ministers, the harmony
whereof in this little world of man, may instruct in example all household
Commonwealths in the world, to unity. Commonwealths I say: for every married
man, for the most part, has three Commonwealths under him: he is a Husband
of a Wife, a Father of Children, and a Master of Servants, and therefore had
need of government in himself that must govern all these, and to that
purpose cannot take unto himself a better practice or president, then from
this uniformity of the body, where the head stands aloft like a King in his
Three, giving direction and command to all his Subjects, bids the foot go,
and it goes, the hand fight and it fights, the members assist and they
assist it, and this harmony preserues the whole man, which otherwise would
destroy it, so must it between man and wife that Mystical head and member or
both perish, and for that reason, shall a man forsake father and mother (the
nearest that else could be) and cleave to his wife, being then no more two but
one; and which he takes from her parents and friends not to offer her
violence, but to tender that love with increase which for his sake in these
she parts with, and she likewise to him, which besides the profit, has
the applause both of God and man, according to the allusion of the Psalm 133.
Ecce quam bonum and iucundum fratres habitare in vnum: Therefore avoid Discord
thou that would see the fruit of thy labors, for unity gathers what
discord dispearseth; avoid Iealousy that unresolved vexation, that labors to
seek out what it hopes it shall not find, that many times forrunnes that
evil which it causes to follow after, being the author of dissension,
distaste, misery, and sometimes of murder too, as many examples testify, of
which I have here inserted one of most ancient truth and lamentable action, of
a King that had a son by whose sword it was prophesied his own father and
mother should perish, who therefore to prevent that fatal desteny forsook his
inheritance and went into a far distant Country to inhabit, where fortune
yet favoring he increased to great honor and riches, and to augment his
greater felicity, was espoused to a wise right noble, rich, and exceeding
beautiful, of whose welfare and happy success his father and mother
afterward hearing (being deposed of their kingdom, and in extreme misery)
traveled to visit for relief and succor, and happening to his house in his
absence, where making themselves known unto his wife to be her husbands
father and mother, she kindly entertained them, and when having well
replenished their bodies by food and sustenance, to rest them the easier after
their travel, she laid them both in her husbands bed; after which he
suddenly entering in possessed with this deadly iealousy, and missing his wife
goes into the chamber, where perceiving two in his bed a sleep, he so enraged
with passion (taking it to be his wife and some adulterer with her) drew forth
his sword and slew them both thereon at once, which when he perceived his
father and mother, he heavily repented with sorrow and woe, and shortly after
dyed with grief and pensiveness. And besides all this because it is thought
(for the most part) to call a man's own guiltiness into question, as Petrarch
to that purpose well observes, who thus notes: There Is no man jealous I durst
pass my word,
Nor fears the scabberd but has struck with t'sword.


If children, which are the very pledges of love, make you parents, relish
their tender years with learning and piety, let Gods Law be the seasoning of
their first thoughts, for we know by experience, green vessels long relish of
the first liquour they receive, and by instruction they may be as soon taught
to say Hosanna to CHRIST, as Bald-pate to Elisha; as soon a good word as a bad
scoff: Affect not one more then another, love them all, but dote upon none,
with the folly of the most; let them be children not wantons, walk before
them especially, their more riper years with the more obseruant example, which
will be better to them then many good lessons. Repine not with the wicked
worldling, who had rather see his counting house environed with vpbrayding
bags then his Table with this blessed garland of children, but be thankful
for them, what ever thy poverty, for as they are Pignora, Pledges, so are they
Benedictiones, blessings; and it shall be more pleasing to thy conscience upon
thy deathbed to seal them as treasure for the Kingdom of heaven, to yield up
thy spirit in the midst of their inuironing, then to unseal so many bags of
evil heaped treasure to nere after performed Legacies, every piece wherein
shall rend thy heart in pieces at that hour, to think of the guilty
atchieuing thereof: Besides he that has much riches, is subject to many
cares, many fears, dread of oppression of violence; but he that has many
children has even a peace in war, a security even in greatest danger, for
he shall speak boldly with his enemies in the gate, they are as so many
swords in thy defense, so many arrows in thy Quiver, Arrows (as says one)
because they may be so leuelled by good education and example, to shoot at
thine enemies, as by the contrary against thy self. I do not see but that
natural reason and mere carnal man may be grauelled, encumbered and
disquieted, in many circumstances of carriage in this business, but those must
be debated and forethought before the entering therein, not repented of
afterward: If thou have laid thy hand to this Plow, become a Husbandman in
this exercise, thou must not by any means look back, for then the allurement
of other beauties will breed a dislike of thine own, in which that thou may
be the better contented, have some part in thine own portion, for as the
saying is: Who takes a woman foul unto his wife,
Does penance daily, yet sins all his life.


The charges of children, the unfaithfulness of servants, the disquietnesse of
neighbors, would wish for a former liberty and releasement, and nothing
disgesteth this course of life more then constancy and perseverance, and
because it is a Trade of such Mystery and Art, therefore (as a famous man of
our time writes) those that have but seven years to learn any other, have
three times seven to acquaint themselves in the laborinth of this and the
management thereof before they undertake it, therefore having this notion make
use thereof, either discharge it willingly and contentedly, or undertake it not
at all.

CHAP. XIIII. Certain Precepts to be observed either in Wiuing or Marriage.
1 Woo not by Ambassador.

2 Make not thy friend too familiar with thy wife.

3 Conceive not an idle iealousy, being a fire once kindled not easily put out.

4 Affect him not that would ill possess thee.

5 Blase not her beauty with thine own tongue.

6 If thy estate be weak and poor marry far off and quickly; if otherwise
firm and rich, at home and with deliberation.

7 Be advised before thou conclude, for though thy error may teach thee wit
it is uncertain in this whether thou shall ever have the like occasion to
practice it.

8 Marry not for Gentility without her support, because it can buy nothing in
the Market without money.

9 Make thy choice rather of a virtuous then a learned wife.

10 Esteem rather what she is of her self, then what she should be by
inheritance.

11 Intactam quaeris intactam esto.

Be that example to thy wife thou would have her to imitate.

For he that strikes with the Point must be content to be beaten with the
Pommell.

12 She whose youth has pleased thee despise not her age.

13 That thou may be loved, be amiable.

14 Sail not on this Sea without a good Compass, for a wicked woman brings a
man to repentance sooner than a surfeit, sooner then suretiship.

15 It Is the greater dispraise to children to be like to wicked parents.

16 It Is more torment to be jealous of a man's wife, then resolved of her
dishonesty.

And the more misery that a man may be assured of her vice that way, but
cannot be of her virtue.

17 True chastity does not only consist in keeping the body from uncleanness,
but in withholding the mind from lust; and she may be more maid that has
been unwillingly forced thereto in body, then she that has barely consented
in heart.

18 A true wife should be like a Turcoyse stone, clear in heart in her
husbands health, and clowdy in his sickness.

And like a Tortoyse under her shell ever bearing her house upon her back.

19 Defer not thy Marriage to thy age, for a woman out of her own choice
seldom pluckes a man, (as a Rose) full blown.

20 Marry so thy body that thou may marry thy mind; which that thou may the
better do, thus meditate.

1 That if thou had in variety of woman out-paraleld Solomon, thou should
in the end give up thy verdict with his: That all is but vanity and vexation of
Spirit.

2 That it is in lust as in riches, where to desire nothing and to enjoy all
things is but one: To uncover more several nakedness then the Turk from his
Decimary Seraglio has authority for, with an vnsatiateillimited appetite, and
to desire none, at least wise no variety, is the same I with advantage.

3 That if thou should thus seeking to please thine appetite enjoy a
thousand, and but want one thou desire, thou should more grieve for that
little want, then rejoice in all thy former plenty.

4 Then since what thou can enjoy, consume thy oil to the socket, and thy
substance to a morsel, will not, be one to thy pleasure for ten thousand that
escape it, the variety so large never to be gathered into one bundle of thy
fruition, to set up thy rest, but the more thou pursuest it the more thou art
distracted: Content thy self within thy lawful limits, and destroy not thy
self to run after that thou can nere oretake, which the faster thou
followest it the swifter it flies from thee.

5 That it were a grief to die for the full pleasure of any sense, but a
torment for a taste to a greater distemper, like to him that should purchase at
a dear rate salt water to quench his thirst, which the more he should drink
should but the more increase it.

6 That if beauty, or wisdom, or any other portion of the body or mind
assail thee, refell them with this thought, that they are but shadows of that
substance, which should the more allure thee: But pictures, which if they
please, are but that the pattern should be the more desired.

Think that as each day is an abridgement of all time, presents the same
light, the same use, the same Sun and Firmament, and the ending of this
renues but the same to morrow: So each woman an abridgement of that whole sex,
and infirmity, how mean so ever, expresses the same substance, the same
mould, and metal, proportion, quality, and use of all other in the world: Who
then would be so mad against sense, though they would persuade otherwise by
Title, by Trapping, by copious adulterating all parts, to believe (as they
would be thought) that they are other then what they are, other then the same,
unless worse then other: The same way and the same fashion, leading to the
Harborough of the same site, of the same condition and quality, though a little
more circumstances (in some then other) beats the Bush, and vshers it on. Know
this, that the end of all such variety is no more then one dish, dressed and
presented by a several Cook, and fashion the same in all one but in
circumstance and carriage: Who would thus be mad without reason to ioyle after
the whole Alphabet of woman, when the lest letter in the row expounds all
that Text and Couerture. And for Title, or Toombelike bravery, well may they
work upon the eye of folly but never besiege the heart of understanding: And
as it was lately well observed by one, who, to that effect, thus further noted
their vanity.

Things were first made, then called, woman the same,
With or without false Title, or proud name.
And if this be not yet enough, take with thee besides for a conclusion and
bar to all the rest, this Motto or Sentence to lead thee home: that, Since
all earths pleasures are so short and small,
The way to enjoy most is to abjure them all.


CHAP. XV. Discontents in all Ages, Sexes, States, Conditions.
VNmedled joys here to no man befall,
Who least has some, who most has never all:
I have examined from the King on's Throne,
To him that at his chayned Oar does groan,
Every estate, condition, and degree
Scytuate between this large extremity:
Yet wheresoever that I cast mine eye,
I never was so fortunate to spy
That man that had so great a blessing lent him,
That had not some what in it to discontent him:
The rich man with his cares and fears oppressed
In all he has can find but little rest:
Ill Creditors, unthrifty Heirs, and losses,
Or else the Gout, or something worse, all crosses.
The poor in want forsaken of his friends,
Thinks that were wealth is there all sorrow ends:
But yet as here immediately I show,
The rich that has it does not find it so.
One Tradesman he dislikes his own Vocation
And on a worse he sets his admiration.
The single man commends the married life
That has the sweet fruition of a wife:
That opens all her beauties and her treasure,
In Hills and Dales that he ore-walkes at pleasure:
That may vnstarted and vnfear'd partake
Whole nights together, that which he does quake
To snatch in corners, when he must away,
Sometimes disturbed when he would longer stay:
Bannish't like Tantalus in his forced have,
To touch the sweetness that he may not taste.
The married man whom all these danties cloy
Thinks that the sauce the sweetness does destroy:
And that to purchase is so wondrous dear,
That he had rather fast then find the cheer.
Then children come, and they augment his charges,
And jealousy some times all these inlarges.
That what the other thinks does heaven excel
He that inioyes it finds it but a hell:
And wishes now, but that it is too late,
That with the Batchelour he might change his state.
Therefore me thinks his application fit
That to a public feast compared it.
Where those that long have sat and cloyed with meat,
Would feign rise up as others feign would eat.
The Ambitious youth least folly ouersway him,
Has Tutors, rod, and parents eye to stay him:
Noting the liberty of riper years,
With more impatience his restrainings bears:
When elder times again (the more it is strange)
Would feign creep back again and with him change.
The busy Lawyer beating of his brain
To make rough points by praesidences plain:
Who from a judgment wrongfully gone out,
Does sometimes bring another right in doubt
By judging by it, let the first but stray
And all go wrong that are adiudg'd that way.
Noting the Merchant, how from foreign shores,
The winds and waves land wealth unto his doors:
That where he sleep, or wake, or rest, or play,
So Aires be prosperous, he grows rich that way,
Dislikes his choice, the Merchant he in danger,
T'whom Rocks, and Shelues and Pirates are no stranger:
That try the wonders of the unknown deepes,
Whom but a three inch't board from danger keeps:
Traffiques with unknown Aires, and unknown friends
Leaving his wife at home to doubtful ends.
Who in his watery Pilgrimage is sed
To be with neither living nor the dead.
Commends the Lawyer that has power and skill,
Either to make or mar, to save or spill
A man's whole revenue, and therefore need
Either for speech or silence to be feed.
The Empericke vncredited that tugges,
With forcelesse herbs and with effectlesse drugges,
Commends the Churchman for his happy share,
Securely freed from Temporary care:
When he again with discontents full many,
Thinks the Physicians happiest life of any;
For by how much the bodies better deemed,
Then is the soul, so much more he is esteemed,
Which is by much, for let the body grieve it
There Is nothing unattempted may relieve it:
But for the soul although it die and languish
We nere regard the dolor nor the anguish:
But to the greatest danger do reply
It will recover, or it cannot die:
Therefore to him that does the Physic bring,
To this regardlesse disesteemed thing,
Has a poor meed more recompenc't his merit,
That cures the body then applies to th'spirit.
And what in health men graple and retain,
If sickness come it flies to ease their pain.
He that by avarice and damned extortion,
Has heap't up many a pound to his heirs portion,
So far from thought of doing any good,
That what it was he never understood;
Sets up his rest for ever here to dwell,
And therefore thinks no other heaven or hell.
Yet when this Seriant death comes to assail him,
To thee he opens hoping thou can bail him:
And though thou can not, do but seem to assent,
And he will reward thee to thine own content:
Therefore this Art and Trade who ere neglect it,
Let him exchange with me that do affect it:
He that a weary languisht youth has lead
To think what pleasures are in Marriage bed:
That has entreated hours and years to have them,
To cancel bonds that he may come and taste them.
When there arrived not finding to content him,
What expectation did before present him.
Let him appease his thoughts upon this ground,
That in this world that purchase is not found.
There Is discontent in every sect and age,
As well in Childhood as in Parentage.
There Is discontent in every man's Vocation,
Therefore pursues it newness innovation.
There Is discontent from Scepter to the Swain,
And from the Peasant to the King again.
Then whatsoever in thy will afflict thee,
Or in thy pleasure seem to contradict thee;
Give it a welcome as a wholesome friend,
That would instruct thee to a better end:
Since no Condition, Sect, nor State is free,
Think not to find in this what nere can be.
FINJS.
