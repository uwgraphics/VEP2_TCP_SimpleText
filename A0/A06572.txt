depiction of crucifixion of Christ

THe years passed / of my tender youth
Of my fresshe age / feared the grenenesse
Lust apalled / thexperyence is couthe
The unwieldy joints / starked with rudeness
The cloudy sight / mysted with darkness
Without redress: recure / or amends
To me of death / have brought in the kalendes.
Of my spent time / a fool may well complain
Thing impossyble / again for to recure
Idell days ylost / who can call again
Them to refourme / by any adventure
Each mortal man / is called to the lure
Of death / alas uncertain the passage
Whose chief maryner / is called crooked age.
One of his bedellys / named Feebleness
Came with his potent / instead of a mace
Sommoned me / and afterward came sickness
Malyncolyke: erthely / and pale of face
With their warrant / these twain can manace
That death of me / his due debt sought
And to a bed of langoure / they me brought.
Whereunto me / a none their did apere
While that I lay / complaining in a trance
Cladde in a mantell / a woman sad of chere
Black was her abyte / sobre was her countenance
Strange of her port / froward of dalyaunce
Castyng her look / to mewarde in certain
Like as of me: she had / had dysdayne.
This said woman / called was Remembrance
Of myspent time / in youths lustynes
Which to record / did me great greuaunce
Than came her suster / named Pensyfnes
For old surfettes / began unto me dress
A woeful byll / which brought unto my mind
My greatr outrages / of long time left behind.
Lyeng alone / I began to Imagyne
How with four times / departed is the year
First: how in Vere / the soil tenlumyne
Buddes gynning open / again the son clear
The baume vpraysed / most sovereign and entere
Out of the rote / does naturally ascend
With new lyuere the barayne soil tamende.
The Honysocle / the fresshe Primmerolles
Their leaves splay / at Phoebus vprisyng
The amorous fowls / with notes and carolles
Salewe that season / every morning
When Aurora / her lycoure dystellyng
Sent on herbs / the perly dropes shane
Of syluery dewes / tenlumyne with the grene.
This time Vere is named / of greenness
Time of joy / of gladness and dysport
Time of growyng / chyefe mother of fresshenesse
Time of rejoicing ordained for confort
Time: when time / makes his resort
In gerysshe March / toward the Aryete
Our emyspery / to gladen with his here.
But to dyrect by grace / my matter
Makely knelyng: Jesus / in thy presence
I me purpose / to gynne with prayer
Under thy merciful / fructuous influence
So thou Jesus / of thy benyuolence
To my requests / by merciful attendaunce
Grant or I dye: shrift housell repentance.
My wretched life tamendden / and correct
I me purpose / with support of thy grace
Thy death / thy passion / thy cross shall me dyrect
Which suffredyst death Jesus / for our trespace
I wretch unworthy / to look upon thy face
Thy fete enbrasyng / from which I shall nattwyn
Mercy enquiryng / thus woll I begin.
Oration.
O Mighty lord / of power mightyest
Without whom / all force is feebleness

Grant or I dye / shrift / housell / repentance.
Though thou be mighty / you art eke mercyable
To all folks / that mekely them repent

To all outrages / ready for to assent
But of hole heart and will / in mine intent

Of youth and age / and of mistyme spent

Of my confession / receive the sacryfice
By my tongue / up offered unto the

With none old rust / of dyseperaunce
Which of hole heart / cry upon my kne
Grant or I dye: shrift / housell / repentance.
O Jesus Jesus / here mine orison
Bridell mine outrage / under thy dysciplyne

To follow the traces / of spyrituall doctrine
Let thy grace led me / right as a line
With humble heart / to live to thy plesaunce
And blessed Jesus / or I this life shall fine
Grant of thy mercy: shrift / housell / repentance.
Suffer me to have / savor nor swetnes
But in thy name / that called as Jesus
All forayne things / to me make bytternes
Save only Jesus / most sovereign of virtue
To my professyon / acordyng and most due
Ever to be painted / in my remembrance
At mine end / to grant me this issue
Tofore my death: shrift / housellf repentance.
No lord but Jesus / most merciable and benygne
Which of mercy / took our humanyte
And of love / to show a sovereign sign
Suffered passion / upon the rode tree
Only to fraunchyse / our mortalyte
Which stood in danger / of Satan's encombrau^ce
Or I pass hens / Jesus grant unto me
Tofore my death: shrift / housell / repentance.
I am excyted / and moved of nature
This name of Jesus / soueraynly to praise
Name commended / most hyghly in scripture
Which name has power / deed men to raise
To live eternal / whose virtue does so payse
Again my sins / wayed in balaunce
That grace and mercy / shall so counterpayse
Grant or I dye: shrift / housell / repentance.
Let me not rest / nor have no quyete
Ocupy my soul / with spyrituall travail
To sing and say / mercy Jesus sweet
My protectyon / again fendes in battle
Setting aside / all other apparayle
And in Jesus / to put all mine affyaunce
Treasour of tresours / that may me most avail
Grant or I dye: shrift / housell / repentance.
My faith / my hope: to the Jesus does call
Which glorious name / shall never out of mind

By grace and mercy / in trust I shall the find
And but I did / truly I were unkind
Which for my sake / was pearsed with a lance
Unto the heart / Jesus leave not behind
Grant or I dye: shrift / housell / repentance.
There is no god / but thou Jesus alone
Soueraynest / and eke most merciful
Fairest of fair: erly / late / and soon

Refourmyng sinners / that been in virtue dull
Dauntyng the proud / meekness to enhaunce

With aureate letters / grave therein substance
Provide for me / and let it not astert
Grant or I dye: shrift / housell / repentance.
Say to my soul Jesu / thou art mine health
Hearing this voice / after I shall pursue
Skoure that place / from all goostly fylth
And vices all / from thens do remewe
Thine holy ghost / close in that little mewe
Part not lightly / make such cheupsaunce
To increase in virtue / and vices to eschew
And or I dye: shrift / housell / repentance.
Show glad thy face / and thy light down shede

Upon my heart to dewyn every vain
And or I dye: shrift / housell / repentance.
Save me thy servant / O lord: in thy mercy
For lack of which / let me not be confounded
For in the Jesus / mine hope stands finally
And all my trust in the Jesus / is grounded
For my sins: think Jesus / thou were wounded
Naked on the rode / by mortal great penance
By which / the power of Satan was confounded
Grant or I dye: shrift / housell / repentance.
Thou art my socoure / and refuge
Gain every tempest / and trybulacion
That wordely wawes / with their mortal deluge

And Syrenes / syngeth songs of dysturbaunce
To pass that danger / be thou my protectyon
Grant or I dye: shrift / housell / repentance.
Who shall give me / like mine intent
That thou Jesus / may make thine herberage
By receyuyng / of the holy sacrament
Into mine heart / which is to mine old age
Repast eternal / gain all forayne damage
Duly received / with devout obseruaunce
Celestyall guerdon / end of my pylgremage
Is shrift / and housell / and hertely repentance.
I feel mine heart brotell / and ruynous
Not puryfied Jesus / therein to rest
But as a carpenter / comes to a broken house
Or an artyficer / repayreth a ryuen chest
So thou Jesu / of crafty men the best
Repair my thought / broke with mysgouernau^ce
Vyset my soul / my heart of steel thou breast
Grant or I dye: shrift housell / repentance.
With weeping eyes / and a contryte chere
Accept me Jesu / and my complaynt conceive
As most unworthy tappere / at thine autere
Which in my self / no virtue apperceyue
But if thy mercy / by grace me receive
By sinful lyueng / brought unto vttraunce
Pray with good hope / which may me not deceive
Grant or I dye: shrift / housell / repentance.
Cryeng to the / that dyedest on the rode
Which with thy blood / was stained and made reed
And on sherethursday / gave us to our fode
Thy blessed body Jesu / in form of breed
To me most sinful / grant or I be deed
To claim by mercy / for mine inherytaunce
That with sharp thorn / were crowned on thy heed
Or I pass hens: shrift / housell / repentance.
And one request / in especyall
Grant me Jesu / while I am here a live
Ever to enprint / in my memorial
The remembrance / of thy wounds five
Nails / with the spear: that did thine heart ryue
Thy croune of thorn / which was no small penance
Langage / and tongue: me duly for to shriue
The holy vncyon: shrift / housell / repentance.
All the tokens / of thy bitter passion
I pray the Jesu / grave them in my memory
Duly mark / mydde centyr of my reason
On Caluery / thy tryumphall vyctorie
Man to restore / to thine eternal glory
By medyacion / of thy meke sufferaunce
Out of this exyle / unsure and transytorie
And when we pass: shrift housell / repentance
Of thy mercy / requyring the to mine
Of my mind the mydde point most profounde
This word Jesu my five wits tenlumyne
In length and bread / like a large wound
All ydell thoughts / to avoid them and co^founde
Thy cross / thy scourges: thy garment cast at chance
The rope / the pyllour: to which thou were bound
Grant or I dye: shrift / housell / repentance.
Of this prayer / mekely I make an end
Under thy merciful supportacyon
O gracyous Jesu / grant where ever I wend
To have memory / upon thy passion
Testymoniall / of my redemption
In my testament / set for allegeaunce
This cause last / of my peticyon
Grant or I dye: shrift / housell / repentance.
Finis orationis.
DVryng the time / of this season Vere
I mean ye season / of my years grene
Ginnyng fro chyldhode / stretches up so fere
To ye years aco^pted / fully.xv.
By experyence / as it was well seen
The gerysshe season / strong of condycion
Dysposed to many / vnbrideld passion.
Void of reason / given to wylfulnesse
Froward to virtue of Christ gave little head
Loathe to learn / loved no virtuous business
Save play or mirth / straung to spell or read
Following all appetytes longyng to chyldhede
Lightly tournyng: wild / and selde sad
Weeping for naught / and a none after glad.
For little worth / to strive with my felawe
As my passions / did my bridell led
Of the yard / stood I sometime in awe
To be scoured / that was all my dread
Loathe toward scole / lost my time in deed
Like a young colt / that ran without bridell
Made my friends give good / to spend in ydell.
I had in custom / to come to scole late
Not for to learn / but for a countenance
With my felawes / ready to debate
To iangle and iape / was set all my plesaunce
Whereof rebuked / this was my cheuysaunce
To forge a lesyng / and there upon to muse
When I trespased / my self to excuse.
To my better / did no reverence
Of my soueraynes / gave no force at all
Wexe obstynate / by inobedyence
Ran into gardeyns / appels there I stall
To gather fruits / spared hedge nor wall
To pluck grapes on other men's vynes
Was more ready / than for to say mattynes.
My lust was always / to skorne folk and lape
Shrewed tournes / ever among to use
To scoff and mow / like a wanton ape
When I did evil / other I did acuse
My wits five / in wast I did abuse
Redyer cherystones / for to tell
Than go to church / or here the sacryng bell.
Loathe to rise / lother to bed at eve
With vnwasshe hands / ready to dynere
My Pater noster / my Creed: or my believe
Cast at the cock: lo / this was my manner
Waued with each wind / as does a read spear
Snobbed of my friends / such tatches tamende
Made deffe ear / list not to them attend.
A child rese^blyng / which was not like to thrive
Froward to god / recheles in his service
Loathe to correctyon / slothe my self to shriue
All good thewys / ready to dyspice
Chief belwether / of feigned trowandyce
This is to mean / my self I could feign
Sick like a trowande / felt no manner pain.
My port / my pase: my foot always unstable
My look / mine eyes: unsure and vacabounde
In all my works / suddenly chaungeable
To all good thewys / contrary I was found
Now ouersad / now mournyng: now iocounde
Wylfull / recheles / mad: startyng as an hare
To follow my lust for nothing would I spare.
Entryng this time / into relygion
Unto the ploughe / I put forth my hand
A year complete / made my professyon
Consydering little charge / of thylke band
Of perfectyon / full good example I found
The techyng good / in me was all the lack
With Lothes wife / I looked often a back.
Taught of my masters / by vtuous dysciplyne
My look restrain / and keep close my sight
Of blessed Benet / to follow the doctrine
And bear me lowly / to every manner wight
By thaduertence / of mine inward sight
Cast to god ward / of hole affectyon
To follow themprises / of my professyon.
His holy rule was unto me radde
And expound / in full notable wise
By virtuous men / relygious and sad
Full well expert / dyscrete / prudent / and wise
And obseruauntes / of many goostly emprise
I herd all well / but to wchyng to the deed
Of that they taught / I took but little head.
Of relygion / I ware a black habyte
Only outward / as by good appearance
To follow the charge / sauoured but a lyte
Save by a manner / counterfeit pretense
But in effect / there was none exystence
Like to the image / of Pygmalyon
Showed lyffely / and was not but a ston.
Upon the ladder / with staves thrice three
The nine degrees / of virtuous meekness
Called in the rule / degrees of humylite
where on to ascend / my fete me list not dress
But by a manner / feigned false humblesse
So covertly / when folks were present
One to show outwaree / an other in mine intent.
First / where I forsook mine own will
Shet with a lock / of obedyence
To obey my souerayns / as it was right and skyll
To follow the scole / of perfyt pacyence
To my emynes / do worship and reverence
Following the reuers / took all an other wey
What I was bydden / I could well disobey.
With tongue at large / and brotell conscience
Full of words / dysordinate of langage
Recheles / to keep my lyppes in scylence
Mouth: eye / and ears / took their advantage
To have their course / vnbrideld by outrage
Out of the raynes / of attemperaunce
To sensualyte / gave all the governance
Watch out of time: riot / and drunkenness
Vnfructuous talkyng / intemperat dyete
To vain fables / I did mine ears dress
False detractyon among / was to me sweet
To talk of virtue / me thought it was not mete
To my courage / nor my complexyon
Nor naught / that sowned toward perfectyon.
One with the first / to take my dysport
Last that arose to come to the quere
In contemplacyon / I found but small confort
Holy stories / did to me no chere
I sauoured more / in good wine that was clear
And every hour / my passage to dress
As I said erst / in ryotte or excess.
Could grudge / and found no cause why
Causles / often complained of my fare
Gain my correctyons / answered frowardly
Without reverence / list no man to spare
Of virtue and pacyence / I was all bare
Of recheles youth / I list none head to take
What Christ Jesus / suffered for my sake.
Which now remembering / in my later age
Time of my chyldhode / as I reherce shall
Within fyftene / holdyng my passage
Mydde of a cloister / depyct upon a wall
I saw a crucyfixe / whose wou^des were not small
With this word / vide / written there beside
Behold my mekenes child / and leave thy pride.
The which word / when I did understand
In my last age / taking the sentence
Thereon remembering my pen I took in hand
Began to write / with humble reverence
On this word vide / of humble dyligence
In remembering / Christ's passion
This little dyte / this compylacion.
Nota.
Behold: O man / lift up thine eye and se
What mortal pain / I suffered for thy trespace
With pyteous voice / I cry and say to the
Behold my wounds / behold my blody face

Behold to Cayphas how I was presented
Behold how Pylate / list give me no respyte
Behold how bishops / were to my death assented
And se how Herod / had me in dyspyte

And last of all / I after their delight

Behold ye mynisters / which had me in keeping
Behold the pyller / and the ropes strong
Where I was bound / my sides down bledyng
Most felly beat / with their scourges long
Behold the battle / that I did vnderfong
The brunt abiding / of their mortal emprise
Thorough their acusyng / and sclaunders wrong
Was like a lamb / offered in sacrifyce.
Behold and se / the hateful wretchedness
Put again me / to my confusyon
Mine eyes hid / and blinded with darkness
Beat and eke bound / by false illusyon
Salewed in skorne / by their false knelyng down
Behold all this / and se the mortal gyse
How I only / for man's salvation
Was like a lamb / offered in sacrifyce.
Se the witness / by whom I was deceydue
Behold the judges / that gave me judgment
Behold the cross / that was for me devised
Behold my body / with beatyng all to rent
Behold the people / which of false intent
Causeles / did again me rise
Which like a lamb / of malice Innocent
Was for mankind / offered in sacrifyce.
Behold the woman / that followed me afterre
That sore wept / when I thus was assailed
Behold the jews / which by their cruel werre
Have my body / unto a cross nailed
Behold my tourme^tes / most sharply aparayled
Atwene two thieves / put to my iewyse
Behold how much my death / has eke auayled
That was for man / offered in sacrifyce.
Behold ye spear / most sharply ground and whet
Mine heart wounded / upon the right side
Behold the redespere / gall and ysell fet
Behold the scourgynges / which that I did abide
And five wounds / that were made so wide

And fro me fled / almoost every chone

Enprint these things / in thine inward thought
And grave them deep / in thy remembrance
Think on them well / and forgete them naught
All this I suffered / to do the allegyaunce
And with my saints / to give the suffysaunce
In the heavenly court / for the I do deuyse
A place eternal / a place of all plesaunce
For which my blood / I gave in sacrifyce.
And more my mercy / to put at a prefe
To every sinner / that none ne shall it mysse
Remember / how I gave my mercy to the thief
Which had so long trespased / and done a mysse
Went he not freely / with me to paradysse
Have this in mind / how it is my gyse
All repentaunt / to bring to my bliss
For whom my blood / I gave in sacrifyce.
Tarry no lengar / toward thy heritage
Haste on thy way and be of right good chere
To each day onwarde / on thy pylgremage
Think how short time / thou shall abide here
Thy place is bylded / above the sterres clear
None erthly palaes / wrought in so stately wise
Come on my friend / my brother most entere
For the I offered / my blood in sacrifyce.
Thus ends the testament of John^ Lydgate monk of Bery / on whose soul Jesus
have mercy.
Et sic est finis / sit laus et gloria trinis.
