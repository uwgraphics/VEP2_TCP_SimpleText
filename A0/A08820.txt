To the Christian Reader.
CHristian Reader, this book was lately published in print, and given forth to
be mine, wherein they have injured both thee and me. Thee in publishing a
Pamphlet so faulty and with so many wants. The injury to me is, because that
was given forth to be mine, which I did never write, nor read over written by
others, until I saw it in print. When my children first began to speak for
the furtherance of them and my servants in the knowledge of the History of the
Bible, after a Chapter read at our meals, at dinner out of the old Testament,
at supper out of the new: I gave the^ by word of mouth only, such observations
as I thought fit for their capacity and understanding, and by their answers to
my questions, I daily took an account how they understood and retained the
same in memory. After 26. years continuance in this exercise, by some
unadvised youth, or indiscreet servant of mine, some Printer gate it: whereof
when I had an inckling, I traveled to some in authority, and by laboring
with them gat it stayed not to be printed in London: yet it coming forth, they
printing it otherwhere without my knowledge or liking: I thought it my duty
being thereto entreated also by others, to read it over, and in some sort to
redress the abuse offered unto thee by the former Impression. And I beseech
the Lord to bless this and all other my labors in some measure to be
profitable to thee and his church.

From my house at Deptford the 9. of August. 1602. The L. unprofitable
Minister, lame Eusebius Pagit.

Secondly, her acts after she was Queen.

Q. How may it be divided according to the estate of the Jews?

brought. Secondly, their deliverance out of these dangers.

Q. In setting forth the dangers, what things are to be observed?

Q. In this promotion of Ester, what is to be observed?

A. First, the occasions: secondly, her marriage.

Ahashuerosh.

Q. Who made it, and to whom was it made?

A. Ahashuerosh who reigned over 127. provinces, made it; first to all his
princes, capraines, and governors: and afterward to the people of Snushan: and

Q. What things are principally to be condemned in this feast?

A. Two: first, that he sought his own glory and majesty. Secondly, that he
continued it so long, seasting every day for an hundred and fourscore days.

Q. What is principally to be commended in it?

A. The holy Ghost notes there was no quaffing, and that no man should be
compelled to drink more then was for his good.

Q. Why was Vashtie removed?

A. Because she disobeyed her busband, and disdained to come when he sent for
her.

Q. By whom was she remooned?

A. By the seven Princes of Persia the chief of his counsel, who also
decreed that wives should honor and obey their husbands.

Q. Vashtie being thus removed, what was the advice of the kings officers?

A. That all the beautiful virgins in all his dominions should be brought
into his Palace, and she that pleased the king, should be Queen; and
amongst them was Ester brought.

Q. What was Ester?

A. A poor young damsel, borne and bredde a captive, by kindred a Jew,
fatherless and motherlesse, brought up by Mordecai her kinsman.

Q. What were the graces wherefore she was preferred?

A. She was dutiful, beautiful, modest, and humble: and therefore found
favor in the eyes of all, and was belooued of the king above all.

Q. Did he keep her as a concubine?

A. No, he took her to wife and made her Queeue.

Q. With what solemnity?

A. 1. He set the crown of the kingdom upon her head.

2 He made a feast to his princes and servants.

3. He gave rest to his provinces and gifts according to the power of a king.

Q. Did Mordecai her guardian, when she was taken into the kings house, leave
to take care for her?

A. No: for although she was taken from him, yet he would every day resort to
the court, and sit in the kings gate to hear of her.

Q. What befell while he continued that course?

A. Two things fell out: the first, he discovered a practice of treason against
the King: the traitors were found and hanged, and the prevention of it was
recorded in the Chronicles as done by Mordecai.

Q. What was the second?

A. A mischievous practice of the confusion of the Jews.

Q. By whom was it devised?

A. By Haman a proud man, a great courtier, and highly in favor with the King.

Q. Why did he envy the Jews so much as to seek to bring them into such
danger?

A. Because that Mordecai did not bow the knee to him, nor reverence him.

Q. Why did not Mordecai yield the reverence to Haman, it being the kings
commandment?

A. Because that Haman was an Agagite of the stock of the Amalechites, a
people hated, forsaken, and cursed of God, because they came first out to fight
against Israel in the wilderness, Exodus 17.8.1. Sam. 15.3.

Q. Was his pride such, that for envy to one man, he sought to destroy the
whole kindred of the Jews?

A. Yea.

Q. By what means did he bring them into this danger?

A. He used two reasons against them: the first was, that they were
troublesome, not keeping the kings law. The second, it should be for the kings
profit, for there should be ten thousand talents of silver paid to the king to
destroy them.

Q. Did Haman prevail by these reasons?

A. Yea, the King gave consent to Haman to do as he pleased: the edict was
written, sealed with the kings ring, sent by posts into al his provinces, to
kill and destroy all the Jews in one day, and especially he prepared a pair
of gallows for Mordecai.

Q. This being concluded, how is it regarded?

A. It is taken diversely: The King and Haman sit feasting and drinking. The
people fall to mourning and crying.

Q. Thus we have gone thorough the first part of the book, and have seen the
danger devised, concluded and appointed to be executed, and we are come to the
second part of the book concerning the avoiding of the danger. How many things
have we in this part of the book to consider?

A. Two: first the means used to prevent this danger: secoudly the event, and
success of the same.

Q. For the first, who are the parties who do seek means?

A. The parties who first heard of it, as Mordecai and Ester specially; or the
people of the Jews generally.

Q. What does Mordecai?

A. He does first humble himself before the Lord by fasting, and seeks help
of him.

Secondly, he makes the cause known to Ester, that she might be an
intercessour to the king for them.

Q. Does Ester follow the cause?

A. At the first she is fearful, doubts the kings favor, and makes
excuses.

Q. How are these removed?

A. Mordecai with an invincible faith in Gods promises, assures himself of
the deliverance of Gods people: but threatens destruction to her and to her
fathers house, for destituting the cause and the people of God.

Q. What means does she and the people then use?

A. First, she commands a fast to all the Jews three days and three
nights: secondly, she promises that she and her maids will do the like:
thirdly, thus prepared, she resolves to go to the king, saying: If I perish,
I perish.

Q. These means being used to God, what means does she use to the king?

A. She banketted the king and Haman day after day, because she knew that he
delighted in bankets, and in his company.

Then she delivered her petition, laying open her danger, and craving aid.

Q. What success and event follweth hereof?

A. God turns all to the best, for he brings shame and confusion to his
enemies, and deliverance to his people.

Q. How is this brought to pass?

A. God causes the King to remember how he was delivered from treason by
Mordecaies means, and therefore commanded that in royal raiment upon the
Kings horse with a crown upon his head, Haman should lead him about the city.

And this was the beginning of Hamans shame and Mordecaies honor.

Q. What does afterward succeed?

A. Ester has her petition granted, and Haman is hanged upon the gallows
which he had prepared for Mordecai.

Q. Does this satisfy Ester to see Mordecai thus honored, and Haman shamed
and hanged?

A. No, she obtains letters from the king into all his provinces, for the
comfort and freedom of the Jews, and for the destruction of their enemies,
amongst whom the ten sons of Haman were hanged.

Q. How many of their enemies were executed.

A. In Shusnan 3000. in all the provinces, 75000.

Q. The Jews having received this mercy from God, how do they show
themselves?

A. By Mordecai a feast was appointed to testify a remembrance of Gods
mercies, and their thankfulness to God for their deliverance, and the people
made acouenant to observe the same.

Q. What became of Mordecai?

A. He was set over the house of Haman, was second in the kingdom to the king,
and procured the wealth of his people.

JOB.
Q. What does this book contain?

A. The history of Job, which sets forth the inconstant estate of man in
this life, either in his body, soul, friends, or wealth of the world.

Q. What is the principal scope and purpose of this book?

A. To teach man patience, to know the mercies of God, and to trust in them,
Iam. 5.11.

Q. How is this book divided?

A. Into two parts, the first is an history, the second a disputation between
Job and his friends.

Q. In reading this history, how many things have we principally to consider?

A. Four, which are also to be considered for the knoweledge and understanding
of all histories.

The time, the place, the parties, and the matter.

Q. In what time were these things done?

A. I cannot define the time certain, but I suppose it was before the law was
given, about the time the children of Israel were in the land of Egypt.

Q. What reasons have you for this?

A. Two reasons. First, his friends. Secondly, his exercise of religion.

Q. How gather you it by his friends?

A. Some were from Esau, some from Keturah Abraham's wife.

Q. How gather you it by the exercise of religion?

A. Because if that the law had been then given, he should according to the
law not have offered sacrifice any other where, but before the Arc, or the
Tabernacle of God, without an especial commandment.

Q. In what place or country did this befall?

A. In the land of Vz.

Some think so called of Vz the son of Aram, the son of Shem, Genesis 10.33.

Others think of Sishan the son of S^er. 1. Chr. 38.42.

Q. In what place of the world lies it?

A. In Asia the great, East from Canaan, West from Chalde, North from Sabea, or
Arabia deserta, and South from Armenia.

Q. What persons are mentioned in this history?

A. The persons are indeed either celestial, as God, and his holy angels, or
else they are terrestrial, as Job, his wife, children, servants, friends, and
enemies, as the Sabees and the Chaldees, or else they are infernal, as Satan
and his angels.

Q. Now for the fourth point, the matter of the history, how is that divided?

A. Into two parts: first, his decay and alteration from such great prosperity
to most extreme adversity, to the latter end of the second chapter. The
second, the restoring of him to his estate again, chap. 42.10.

Q. What was his estate in prosperity?

A. He had a wife, ten children very obedient unto him, loving and kind one to
an other: also he had many sheep, oxen, asses, camels, a great family, large
possessions, many friends, great authority and power, health of body, and
above all quietness of mind.

Q. Into what adversity was he brought?

A. He lost his cattle, his goods, his servants, his children, the health of
his body: he was smitten with sore and grievous boyles from the very sole of
his foot, to the crown of his head: his wife and his friends vexed him, his
soul was full of trouble and anguish.

Q. What brought him to this adversity?

A. God was the principal cause, who did it only to try him. Satan as a
servant, of malice and hatred only to destroy him: the Sabees and Chaldees to
satisfy their cruelty and covetousness, killed his servants, and stole away
his cattle: the fire from heaven burnt his sheep, the wind blew down the
house and killed his children, and the contemptuous skornes of many entered into
his soul.

Q. How many things observe you in this disputation?

A. Three: the parties, the occasion, and the matter.

Q. Who were the parties?

A. The opponents were Jobs friends, Eliphas, Bildad, and Zophar. Job was
defendant and answerer: the moderatours of the disputation were Elihu, and God.

Q. What were the occasions they entered into disputation with him?

A. The occasions were two: first, the beholding of his misery: the second,
the hearing of his bitter complaint which he delivered from the anguish of his
heart.

Q. What is the matter disputed of between them?

A. Whether these afflictions were laid upon Job for his sins, or no.

Q. What part does his friends take?

A. They unwisely iudgeing of his estate, affirm that he is smitten for his
sins, and so they do not comfort him, but rather add affliction to his
affliction.

Q. What does Job in his answer?

A. He defended the contrary with many passions, proceeding from the conflicts
and combats between the flesh and the spirit; trust and distrust, hope and
despair. And this disputation begins at the 4. chap. and continues to the
32.

Q. How do the moderators conclude this disputation?

A. Elihu is angry with both parties, and refuted them: God finds fault with
Job for desiring to plead with him, showing he is not able to contend with his
creature, especially Behemoth and Leuiathan, much less with him.

Q. What effect took this?

A. Job repented, served God and prayed, and so God justified him, and
condemned his friends.

Q. We are come to the last part, which is his restoring again: who restored
him?

A. God, the gluer of every good gift.

Q. How did he restore him?

A. First, with the favor of his kindred, friends, and acquaintance. Secondly,
he doubled his wealth. Thirdly, with ten children mo, and to see his
posterity to the fourth generation. Fourthly, with a long life and blessed end.
