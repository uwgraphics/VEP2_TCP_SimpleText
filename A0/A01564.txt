Tell me and it shall he amended soon
All gentylnesse to fulfill
I have been bestad today full fore
Shame it were to preue me any more
But here I am at your will
I wys quod Brandles that is sothe
But I must needs hold mine oath
Thou have done so ill
My fader and my brederne thou have beten both
To accord I were thereof full loathe
My worship to fulfill
Now said Gawayne sith it is so
I must needs me drive thereto
This day god lend me grace
For my sword shall do none advantage
Let us se how well we can autrage
If I may dure ought in this trace
Gramer^y said Brandles in good faye
Now shall you se me make good play
Of knyghthode thou have no pere
I am right glad that thou have might
But sorry I am that we want day light
But amended is mychere
They fought together these knights good
Through the haburgeons ran the reed blood
That pity it was tose
They fought together with such ire
That after fl^med out the f^^^
^e boughe in his hand he did bring
^ge on a Ioly coursere
^se was trapped in reed velvet
^uches of gold thereon was set
^ghthode he had nopere

(...) it was more than three else long
^dred all with gold
(...) as a knight of large and length
^oued well of much strength
(...) him who so would
(...) of gold also he had on
She has caused to day much shame parde
It is pity she has her sight
Sir knight said sir Gawayne have good day
For on foot I have a long way
^n horse were me wonder dear
Sometime good horses I have good wone
But now on foot needs must I gone
God in have amend my chere
Sir Gawayne was armed passing heavy
On foot might he not endure truly
His knyfe he took in hand
His armoure good he cut him fro
Else on fore might he not go
Thus with care was he bond
Leave we now sir Gawayne in woe
And speak we more of sir Brandles tho
When he with his sister met
He said fie on the harlot strong
It is pity that thou lyuest so long
Strypes hard I will the set
And beat the both back and side
And than would he not abide
But to his fader streyte he went
Than he axed him how he fared
He said sone for the have I cared
I wend that thou had ben shente
Brandles fayd I have beat my systere
And the knight I made him swear
(...) we mete again
(...) together fight
Till at the last they wanted light
They wist not what to done
Than said sir Brandles that knight so gaye
Sir knight we want light of the day
Therefore I make my moan
If we fight thus in the derke together
Through myshap the one might fle the other
And therefore by mine assente
Let us swear on our swerdes both
Where that we mete for lefe or loathe
If that we mete in present
And never leave the battle till the one be slain
I assent me thereto than said Gawayne
And ye will that it so be
Thus said sir Brandles I may none other do
For such promise I made my fader unto
Therefore this oath make we
I wot that there is no stroke yt thou gyuest me
But I have quyt it sykerly
And thou art not in my det
Full large of lyuerye thou art sir knight
Never none did preue so well my might
We ben even as we met
Let us make an oath on our swerdes here
In what place we mete far or nere
Even there as either other may find
Even so we shall do the battle utterly
I hold said Gawayne by mylde mary
And thus we make an end
S^r Gamayne take (...) his sword than
When he all saw he said alas
This is evil tydyngr
When he saw his fader all blody
And his.ii. brethren hurt full sykerly
Alas said Brandles than
Who has done you such a dyspyte
Tell me in have that I may him quyte
For mine heart is woe begone
Then said the fader sone I shall the tell
All this has done a knight full fell
And layne by thy sister also
He bet me first and sithe them all
And made us swear that we ne shall
This day do him no woe
Now quod Brandles this is ylle come
I ensure you by my holy dome
I shall prove his might
Were he as strong as Sampson was
In faty he shall I never from hympas
Till the one of us to death be dyght
Ye love Brendles thou shalt not so
Though he have done wrong let hymg
The knight is passing sure
I will not for more than I will said
Se the sir Brandles there slain
For I warrante the he will endure
The knight is strong and well fight
And when he has in his hand a man
He will do him no yl^
But ^entyll words speak again
And each of them helped other
As well as they might go
Than the lady gate her away
They saw her never after that day
She went wandrynge to and fro
Also sir Gawayne in his party
On foot he went full weryly
Till he to the court came home
All his adventure he showed the king
That with those.iiii. knights he had fyghtyng
And each after other alone
After that time they never met more
Full glad were these parties therefore
So was there made the end
I pray god give us all good rest
And those that have hard this little geste
And in hye heaven for to be dwelling
And that we all upon domes day
Come to the bliss that lasts a ye
Where we may here the aungelles sing
Imprynted at London in Fletestrete at the sign of saint Johan euaugelyst^ by
me Johan Butler.

Of knyghthode thou haste no fellow
On my faith I ensure the
Now quod Gawayne let him be
And sir knight make one oath to me
That this day thou do me no grieve
And thou shalt pass from me all quyte
Where as is now thy most delight
Without any more reprefe
Sir Terry said thereto I grant
Fare well now god be thy warraunte
Full mekely he went on foot
He left never till he came there
Where his fader and sir Gyamoure were
That careful hertes had god wot
Than spoke sir Gyamoure his youngest bro
Sir thou have gotten as we have and none
That knew I well it should so be
By god said sir Terry so now it is
He is a devil forsothe Iwys
And that is preued on me
Ye quod sir Gylberde that earl old
He is a knight both strong and bold
And fortune is his friend
My d^ughters love he clean wan
Therefore I dare well say he is a man
And mykell worse than I wend
As they three stood thus talk ynge
They herd a man full loud sing
That all the wode ronge
