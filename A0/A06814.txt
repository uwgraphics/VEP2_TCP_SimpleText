(...) Than is there an other isle ye men call Dody and it is a great isle / In
this isle are many diverse manner of men and have evil manners for the fader

mynstrelles there and ete him with great melody. And so when they have eten all
the flesh / than they take the bones and burye them all singing with great
worship / and all those that are of his friends that were not there at the
etynge of him has great shame and velonye so that they shall never more be
holden as friends. And the king of this isle is a great lord and mighty / and
he has under him.li^ij great yles and each of them has a king / and in one
of thise yles are men that has but one eye / and that is in the mids of
their front / and they ete not but flesh and fysshe raw / And in an other
isle dwell men that have no hedes and their eyes are in their sholders and their
mouth is on their breast / In an other isle are men y^ have no head ne eyes and
their mouth is in their sholders. And in an other isle are men that have platte

when they use the membre of manand they bear children when they use the membre
of woman. many other manner of folk is thise in yles therabout of whom it were
to long to tell all.

Of the kyngedome named Mancy and is the best kingdom of the world. ca.lxiij.
TO goo fro this isle toward the ^est many Iourneys a man shall find a kingdom
yt is called Mancy and this is in Ynde the more / and it is most delectable
and plente of goods of all the world. In this land dwell christian men and
sarasyns / for it is a great land / and therein is.ij.M. great cytees and many
other towns. In this land no man gooth on beggy^ge for there is no poor man
/ and ye men have berdes thynne of here as it were cattes. In this land are
fair women / and therefore some men call y^ land albany for ye white folk /
and theris a cite yt men call Latorym and is more than Paris / and in yt lord
are birds twyes greter than it be here / and there is good chepe of all manner
of vytaylles.

In this country are white hens and they bear no^ feders but woll as sheep
do in our land / and women of that country y^ are wedded bear crowns upon
their heedes that they may be known by. In this country they take a be y^
is called Loyres. and they kenne it to go in to waters or vy^ers / and as soon
he brings out of the water great fysshes / and thus they take fysshe as
long as they will to yt them needs. Fro this cite men go by many Iourneyes
to an other great cite yt is called Cassay that is the most cite of the world
/ and that Cite is fyfty mile about / and there is in y^ cite mo than.xij.
pryncypall gates without. Fro thens within three mile is an other great cite /
and within this Cite are more than.xij. thousand brydges / and upon each
bridge is a strong toure where the kepers dwell too keep it again the great
Chane for it marches on his land / and on one side of the cite renneth a
great river / and there dwell christian men ans other / for it is a good country
and plenteuous and there grows right good wine / this is a noble cite where
the king of Mancy was wont to dwell / and there dwell relygyous men christian
freres / And men goo upon y^ ^yuer till they come to an abbaye of monks a
little fro y^ cite / and in that abaye is a great gardyn and fair and therein is
many manner of trees of diverse fruytes In that gardyn dwell many manner of
beestes as baboynes / apes / marmosettes and other / and when the covent has
eten a monk takes the relleef and bear it in to the gardeyne / and smytech
ones with a bell of silver which he hold in his hand / and anon come out
these bestes yt I spoke of and many moo nere iij. or.iiij. thousand / and he
g^ueth them to ete of fair vessels of silver / and when they have eten he
smyteth the bell again and they goo again their way. And the monk says y^
those bestes are souls of men yt are deed / and those beestes yt are fair are
souls of lords and other rich men / and those y^ are foul bestes are souls
of other comunes. And I asked them if it had not be better to give that relefe
to poor men and they said theris no poor man in ye country and if there were
yet it were more alms to give it to those souls ye suffer there their
penance and may go no ferder to get their mete than to men ye have wit and
may trauayl for their mete. Than come men to a cite ye is called Chybens and
there was y^ first sege of y^ kyn^e of Mancy. In this cite are.lx. brydges of
stone as fair a they may be.

Of the land of Pygmeen wherein dwells but small people of three span long.
ca.lxiiij
When men pass fro ye cite of Chybens they pass over a great river of fresshe
water / and it is nere iiij. mile broad / and than men enter in too the land
of the great Chane. This River gooth thrughe the land of Pygmeens / and there
men are of little stature for they are but three span long and they are right
fair both men and women though they be little / and they are wedded when they
are half a year old / and they live but.viij. year and he that lives.viij.
year is holden right old / and these small men are the best work men in sylke
and of cotton in all manner thing that are in the world. and these small men
trauayl^ne till no land / but they have among them great men as we are to
travail for them / and they have great scorn of those great men as we would
have of gyauntes or of them if they were among us.

Of ye cite of Menke where a great navy is. ca.lxv
ERo this land men go thrughe many countrees and cytees and towns till they
come to a cite that men call menke. In that cite is a great navy of ships and
they are as swyte as snow of kind of the wood that they are made of / and
they are made as it were great houses with halles and chambres and other
esymentes.

Of the land named Cathay and the great rychesses thereof. ca.lxvi.
ANd from thens men go^ upon a river that men call Ceremosan / and this river
gooth thrughe Cathay and does many times harm when it waxes great. Caythay is
a fair country and rich full of goods and marchau^dyses / thither come
merchants every year for too fetch spyces and other machaundyses more
comunely than they do in to other countries. And ye shall understand that
merchants that come from Venyce or fro Geene or from other places of Lombardy
or of Romayne / they go byse and land.xi. months and more or they may come
to Caythay.

Of a great cite named Cadon where in is ye great Chanes palace and lege.
ca.lxvij
IN the prouynce of Caythay toward the eest is an old cite / and beside that
cite the Tartarynes have made an other Cite that men call Cadon that has.xij.
gates / and ever between two gates is a great mile / so that those two cytees
the old and the new is round about.xx. mile. In this cite is the palace and
sege of the great Chane in a full fair place and great of which the walls
about is two mile / and within that are many fair places and in the gardeyne
of that palace is a right great hill on the which is an other palace / and i^
^s the fairest that may be found in any plade / and all about y^ hylle are
many trees berynge diverse fruytes / and about that hylle is a great dyche /
and there nere are many vyuers on each side / and in those are many wild
fowls that he may take and go not out of the palace: Within the halle of that
palace are xxiiij. pylers of gold / and all the walls are covered with rich
skynnes of beestes that men call pauters. Those are fair beestes and well
smelling and of the smell of the skynnes ^one evil smelle may come to the
palace / those skynnes are as reed as blood / and they shine so again the
son y^ uneaths may ^en behold them / and ^en praise those skynnes as much
as it were cold. In mids of that palace is a place made yt they call the
mounture for the great Chane that is well made with precious stones and great
perles hanging about / and at the four corners of that mountour are four
nedders of gold / and under that mountour and above are conduytes of beuerage
that they drink in the emperors court. And the halle of that palace is
rychely dyghte and well / And first at the over end of the hall is the throne
of the Emperor right hye where he sytteth at mete at a tab^e ye is well
bordured with gold / and that bordure is full of precious stones and great
perles / and the greces on the which he gooth up are of diverse precious
stones bordred with gold. At the left side of his throne is the syege of his
wife a degree lower than he sytteth and that is of Jasper bordured with gold /
and the syege of his second wife is a degree lower than the first and that is
also of good Jasper bordured with gold / and the syege of the third wife is a
degree lower than the second / for always he has three wives with him where
soever he is / beside these wives on the same side sytteth other ladies of his
kynne echone lower than other as they are of degree / and all those that are
wedded have a counterfayte of a man's foot upon their hedes a cubyte long and
al made with precious stones / and above they are made with shynynge feders of
pecockes or such other in token y^ge that they are subgeccyon of man and under
me^ foot / and they that are not wedded have none such. And on the right side
of the Emperor sytteth first his sone that shall be Emperor after him /
and he sytteth also a degree lower than^e the Emperor in such manner of seges
as the Emperor sytteth / and by him sytteth other lords of his kynne echone
lower than other as they are of degree. And the emperor has his table by
himself alone that is made of gold and precious stones or of white crystal or
yelowe bordred with gold / and echone of his wives has a table by herself.
And under the Emperors table sytteth four clerks at his fete that writes al
yt the Emperor says be it good or ylle. And at great festes above the
Emperors table and all other tables in the halle is a vy^e made of fine gold
y^ gooth all about the hall and it has many branches of grapes like to
grapes of the vine / some are white / some are yelowe / some reed / some grene
/ and some black / all the reed are of rubyes of cremas or alabau^ce / the
white are of crystale or byrall / the yelowe are of topaces / the grene are of
emeraudes and crysolytes / and the black are of quyches and gerandes / and
this vine is made thus of precious stones so properly that it seems as it were
a vine growing. And before the board of the Emperor stands great lords /
and no man is so hardy to speak to him but it be mynstrels for to solace
the emperor. And all the vessel that is served in his halle or chambres are of
precious stones and namely at tables where great lords ete / that is to say /
of Jasper / crystal / amatyst / or fine gold and the cups are of emeraudes
/ sapphires / topaces / and other many manner of stones / and of silver have they
no vessel for they praise silver but little to make vessel of / but they
make of silver greces pylers and pauymentes of halles and of chambres. And ye
shall understand y^ my fellow and I was in soudy with him.xvi. months again
the king of Mancy upon whom he made war / and the cause was for we had so
great desire to se the nobley of his court if it were such as we herd speak
of / and forsooth we found it more rycher and solemn than ever we herd speak
of / and we should never have byleude it had we not seen it / but ye shall
understand y^ mete and drink is more honest among us than it is in those
countries / for all the commons ete upon skynnes of beestes on their knees and
ete but flesh of all manner bestes / and when they have all eten they wype
their hondes in their skyrtes and they ete but ones on the day and ete but
little bread / but the estate of the lords is full nobley and full rychely.

Wherefore that the Emperuor of Cathay is called the great Chane. ca.lxviij.
ANd ye shall wete why he is called the great Chane / ye wot well that all the
world was destroyed with Noes flood but Noe and his wife and his childern. Noe
had three sons Sen Cham and Iapheth. Cham was he yt saw his faders balockes
naked when he slepte and scorned it / and therefore was he cursyd / and Iapheth
covered it again. These three brethern had all the land. Cham took the best
part eestwarde y^ is called Asia. Sem took Affryke / and Iapheth to Europe.
Cham was the myghtyest and rychest of his brethern / and of him are come the
paynem folk and diverse manner of men of the yles / some hedles / and other men
dysfygured / and for this Cham the Emperor there called him Cham and lord of
all. But ye shall understand that the Emperor of Cathay is called Chane and
not Cham / and for this cause it is not long gone yt all Tartary was in
subgeccyon and thrall to other nacyons about / and they were made herdemen to
keep beestes / and among them was.vij. lynages or kinds / the first was
called Tartary ye is the best / the second lynage is called Tanghot / the
third Eurace / the fourth Valayre / the fyfthe Semoth / the sixth Menchy /
the seventh Sobeth. These are all holding of the great Chane of Cathay. Now it
befell so yt in the first lynage was an old man and he was not rich and men
call hy^ Changyus. This man lay and slepte on a night in his bed / and
there came to him a knight all white sitting upon a white horse and said to
him. Chane slepest thou / god that is almighty sent me to the / and it is his
will y^ thou say to the.vij. lynages yt thou shall be their Emperor / for ye
shall conquer all the lands y^ are about you and they shall be in your
subgeccyon as ye have be in theyrs. And when morrow came he rose up and said it
to the.vij. lynages / and they scorned him and said he was a fool. And the
night after the same knight came to the.vij. lynages and badde them of gods
behalf to make Changyus their Emperor and they should be out of all
subgeccyon. And on the morrow they chose Changyus to Emperor and did him all
worship yt they might do and called him Chane as the white knight called him /
and they said they would do as he badde them. Than he made many statutes and
laws the which he called Ysakan. The first statute was that they should be
obedyent to god almighty / and believe y^ he should deliver them out of
thraldom / and y^ they should call on hy^ in all their works. An other
statute was that all men y^ might bear arms should be nombred and to each.x.
should be a master and to an hundred a master / and to a thousand a master.
Than he commanded to all the grettest and pryncypalest of the.vij. lynages
that they should forsake all that they had in heritage or lordshyp / and that
they should hold them paid of that he would give them of his grace / and
they did so And also he badde them y^ each man should bring his eldest sone
before him and slay his own sone with his own hands and smite of their
heedes and as soon they did his bidding. And when he saw they made no
lettynge of yt he badde them do / than badde he them follow his baner / and
than he put in subgeccyon all the lands about him.

How the great Chane was hid under a tree and so escaped his enmyes by cause
of a bird. ca.lxix.
ANd it befelle on a day that the Chane rode with a few men to se the land
that he had won and he met with a great multitude of his enmyes and there
he was cast down of his horse and his horse slain. And when his men saw him at
the earth they wend he had be deed / and fled and the enmyes followed after /
and when he saw his enmyes were far he hid him in a busshe. for the wood
was thycke there / and when they were come again fro the chass^ they went to
seek among the wood if any were hid there / and they found many. And as
they came to ye place where he was they saw a bird sytte upon a tree the
which bird men call an oule / and than said they y^ there was no man for
that bird sat there and so went they away / and thus was the Chane saved
fro death / and so he went away on a night to his own men which were glad
of his coming. And fro that time hyderwardes men of that country have do
great worship to that bird and for that cause they worship that bird above
all the birds of the world And than he assembled all his men and rode upon
his enemies and destroyed them. And when he had won all the lands that were
about him he hetde them in subgeccyon. And when the Chane had won all the
lands to mount Belyan / the white knight come to him in a vysyon again and
said unto him. Chane the will of god is that thou pass the mount Belyan and
thou shall win many lands / and for thou shall find no passage go thou to
mount Belyan that is upon the sea side and knele ix. times thereon against the
eest in the worship of god and he shall show the a way how thou shall pass /
and the Chane did so / and anon the sea that touched the hylle withdrowe him
and showed him a fair way of.ix. foot brood between the hylle and the sea /
and so he passed right well with all his men and than he wanne the land of
Cathay that is the most land and the grettest of all the world / and for
those.ix. knelynges and the.ix. foot of way the Chane and the men of Tartary
have the nombre of.ix. in great worship.

Of the great Chanes letters and the writing about his seal. ca.lxx.
ANd when he had won the land of Cathay he deyed and than reigned after
Cythoco the eldest sone of Chane / and his other broders went to win them
lands in other countries / and they wanne the land of Pruysse and of Russy /
and they did call themself Chane / but he of Cathay is the great Chane and
the grettest lord of all the world / and so he called hy^ in his letters and
says thus. Chan filius dei excelsi vniuersa^ terra^ colenciu^ su^mus imperator
and dn^s domina^tiu^. That is to say. Chane gods sone Emperor of all those
yt tylle all the land and lord of all lords. And the writing above his
great seal is. Deus in celo et chan super terra^ eius fortitudo oi^m hoi^m
imperatoris sigillu^. That is to say God in heaven Chane upon earth his
strength the seal of the emperor of all men. And y^ writing about his preuy
seal is. Dei fortitudo oi^m hoi^m i^peratoris sigillu^. That is to say. The
strength of god seal of the Emperor of all men. And all if it be so yt they
be not christian yet the emperor and the Tartaryns believe in god almighty.

Of the governance of the court of the great Chane. ca.lxxi.
NOw have I told you why he is called the great Chane. Now shall I tell you
of the gouernynge of his court when they make great festes / and he keped four
pryncypall festes in the year / the first is of his birth / the second when he
is borne to the Temple to be circu^cysed / the third is of his ydols when they
begin to speak / and the fourth when the ydoll begins first to do miracles
/ and at those times he has men well arrayed by thousands and by hondredes /
and echone wot well what he shall do. For there is first ordained four
thousand rich barons and mighty for to ordeyne the feast and to serve
the emperor / and all these barons have crowns of gold well dyght with
precious stones and perles / and they are cladde in clothes of gold and
camathas as rychely as they may be made / and they may well have such clothes
for they are there of less price than woollen cloth is here. And these four
thousand barons are departed in four parties / and each company is clad in
diverse color right rychely / and when ye first thousand is passed and has
showed them / than come the second thousand / and than the third thousand
/ and than the fourth and none of them speaks a word. And on one side of
themperours table sytteth many phylosophres of many scyences / some of
astronomy / nygromancy / geometry / pyromacy / and other many scyences / and
some have before them astrolabes of gold or of precious stones full of sonde
or of coals brennynge / some have orloges well dyght and rychely and other many
Instruments after their scyences / and at a certain hour when they se time
they say to men ye stand before them make peace / and than say those men
with a loud voice to all the halle now be stylle a while / and than says one
of ye phylosophres each man make reverence and enclyne to the emperor yt is
gods sone and lord of the world for now is time and hour / and than all
men enclyne to him and knele on the earth / and than byddeth the phylosophre
them rise up again / and at an other hour an other phylosophre byddeth they^
all put their finger in their eerys and they do so / and at an other hour an
other phylosophre byddeth yt all men shall lay their hand on their heed and
they do so / and than he byddeth them take away and they do so / and thus fro
hour to hour they bydde diverse things / and I asked pryuely what this
should mean and one of the masters said yt the enclynynge and the knelynge on
the earth at yt time has this token / that all those men that kneled so shall
evermore be true to the emperor / that for no gift ne hetynge they shall never
be traitors ne falls to hy^ And the putting of ye finger in the eere has this
token / y^ none of those shall here none ylle be spoken of the Emperor or his
counsel. And ye shall understand yt men dyght no thing / clothes / bread /
drink / nor none such things to the emperor but at certain hours that the
phylosophres tell and if any man reyse war against that Emperor in what
country so it be these phylophres wot it soon and tell the Emperor or his
counseyll / and he sends men thither for he has many men. And he has many
men to keep birds as garfaukons sperhaukes / faucons / gentyls / laners /
sacres / popyniayes that are speaking and many other.x. thousand olyfau^tes /
baboynes / marmosettes and other / and he has ever about him many physycyens
more than two hundred that are christian men and.xx. sarasyns / but trusts more
in christian men than in sarasyns. And there is in that country many barons and
other servants that are christian and converted to the good faith thorugh
prechynge of good christian men that dwell there / but there are many that will
not that men wete that they are christian.

Of the great richesse of this Emperor and of his dyspendynge. ca.lxxij.
THis Emperor is a great lord for he may dyspende what he will without nombre
/ by cause he spended another silver another gold / and he made no money but of
leder or shynnes / and this same money gooth thorugh all his land / and of the
silver and gold builded he his palace. And he has in his chamber a pyler of
gold in the which is a Ruby and a carbuncle of a foot long the which
lyghteth all his chamber by night / and he has many other prycyous stones and
rubyes but this is the most. This Emperor dwells in the somer toward the
North in a cite that men call Saydus and there it is cold enough / and in the
winter he dwells in a cite that men call Camalache and there it is right
hot / but for the most part is he to Cadon that is not far thens.

Of the ordinance of the lords of the emperor when he rydeth from one country
to an other or to war. ca.lxxiij.
ANd when this great Chane shall ride from one country to an other they
ordeyne four hoostes of people / of which the first gooth before a days
Journey / for yt host lies at even where the Emperor shall lie on the morrow
/ and there is plen^e of vytayls. And an other host comes at yt right side of
him and an other at the lift side / and in each host is much folk. And than
comes ye fourth host behind hy^ a bow drawght / and there is more men in
than in any of the other. And ye shall understand that the Emperor rydeth on
no horse but when he will go to any secret place with a pryue meyne where he
will not be known / but he rydeth in a charyotte with four wheles / and there
upon is a chamber made of a tree that men call lignu^ aloes that comes out of
Paradyse terrestre and that chamber is covered with plates of fine gold and
precious stones and perles / and four olyfau^tes and four oxen all white gone
there in. And five or six great lords ryden about him so that none other men
shall come nere him but if the Emperor call any. And in that same manner with
charyotte and such hoostes rydeth the Empress by an other side / and the
Emperors eldest sone on the same array / and they have so much people that it
is a great meruayll for to se.

How the Empire of the great Chane is departed in to.xij. prouynces / and how
that they do cast ensence in the fire where the great Chane passes thorugh the
cytees and towns in worship of the Emperor. ca.lxxiiij.
THe land of the great Chane is departed in.xij. prouynces / and each prouynce
has more than two thousand cytees and towns. Also when the emperor rydeth
through the country / and he passes through cytees and towns / each man makes
a fire before his house and casts therein ensence and other things yt give
good smell to the emperor. And if any men of relygyon yt are christian dwell nere
as the emperor comes they mete him with processyon with a cross and holy water
/ and they synge^ Veni creator spiritus with a loud voice. And when he see
them come he commands the lords yt ride nere him to make way yt the
relygyous men may come to him / and when he se that cross he does of his hatte
that is made of precious stones and great perles / and yt hatte is so rich
that it is marvel to tell and than he enclyned to the cross. And the
prelate of the relygyous men says orysons before him and gives him the
benyson with the cross / and he enclyneth to the benyson full devoutly / and
than the same prelate gives him some fruit of the nombre of ix. in a plate of
gold as peers or apples or other fruit / and than the Emperor takes one
thereof and the other he gives to his lords / for the manner is such there
that no strange man shall come before the emperor, but he give him somewhat
after the old law that says. Non accedat in ^spectu meo inanis. That is too
say. No man come in to my sight idle. And than the Emperor byddeth these
relygyous men yt they shall go forth so that men of his host defoule they^
not. And those relygyous men that dwell where the Empress or the Emperors
sone comes do in the same manner.

How that the great Chane is the myghtyest lord of all the world. ca.lxxv.
THis great Chane is the myghtyest lord of the world / for prester Johan is
not so great a lord as he / ne the Soudan of Babylon ne the Emperor of Persy.
In his land a man has an hundred wives / and some.xl. some more some less /
and they take of their kynne to wives all save their systers of their moders /
but their systers of their faders other wives they take also / and they take
also well their stepmoder if their fader be deed / and men and women have all
one manner of clothing so that they may not be known but y^ women that are
wedded bear a token on their heedes / and they dwell not with their husbondes
/ but he may lie by which that he will. They have plente of al manner of bestes
save swyne and forsothe they will none and they believe well in god yt made all
thing and yet have they ydolles of gold and silver / and to those ydols they
offer their first milk of their bestes.

Yet of other manners of this country ca.lxxvi.
THis Emperor the great Chane has three wynes / and ye pryncypall wife was
preester Io^^^s daughter. And the people of this country begin too do all
their things in the new moan / and they worship much the son and the moon
those men ride comunely without spores / and they hold it great sin too
break a bone with an other and to cast milk on the earth or other lycoure yt
men may drink. And the most sin that they may doo^s to pysse in their
houses there they dwell / and he that pysseth in his house shall be slain /
and of those sins they shryue them to their prestes / and for their penance
they shall give silver / and the place where they have pyssed shall be hallowed /
or else may no man come there. And when they have do their penance they shall
pass through a fair fire or two too make them clean of their sins. And they
have eten they wype their hands upon their shyrtes for they have no table
clothes but it be right great lords / and when they have all eten they put
their dysshes or doublers not wasshen in y^ pot or caudron with flesh that is
left when they have eten unto they will ete an other time / and rich men
dry^ke milk of mares or asses or other bestes and other beuerage y^ is made of
milk and water together for they have neither wine ne ale. And wha^ they goo to
war the war full wisely / and each man of them bears two or three bows and
many arowes and a great hachet / and gentylmen have short swerdes / and he
that flees in battle they slay him / and they are ever in purpose to bring
all lands in subgeccyon to them / for they say prophecyes say yt they shall
be overcome by shot of archers and yt they shall torn them to their law /
but they wot not what men they shall be / and it is great peril to pursue the
Tartaryns when they flee / for they will sho^e behind and slay men as well as
before / and they have small eyes as little birds / and they (...) comunely
false for they hold not y^ they promise. And when a man shall deye among
them they st^ke a spear in the earth beside him / and when (...) draws to
the death they go out of ye house till he (...) deed and than they put him in y^
earth in the field.

How the Emperor is brought unto his grave when he is deed. ca.lxxvij
AN when the Emperor is deed they set him in a chair in y^ mids of his
tente / and they set before him a table covered with a clothe and thereupon
flesse and other mete and a cup full of milk of a mare / and they set a mare
with a colte by him and an horse sadled and brydeled / and the lay upon the horse
gold and silver / and all about him they make a great grave / and with all
these things they put him therein as the tent horse gold and silver and all
that is a bout him / ad they say when he comes in to an other world he shall
not be without an house ne horse ne silver ne gold / and the mare shall give
him milk and bring forth more horses till he be well stored in the other
world and one of his chamberlaynes or servants is put with him in the earth
for to do him service in the other world / for they believe that when he is
deed he shall goo in to an other world and be a greter lord there than here.
And when yt he is laid in the earth noman shall be so hardy for to speak of
him before his friends.

When the Emperor is deed how they chese and make an other. ca.lxxviij
ANd than when the Emperor is deed the seven lynages gader them together and
they touch his sone or the next of his blood and they say thus / we will and
we ordeyne and we pray that thou be our lord and our Emperor. And he
enquyreth of them and says if ye will that I regne upon you so must ye do all
that I bydde you to do. And if he bydde that any he slain he shall be slain
/ And they answer all with one voice / all that ye bydde shall be done. Than
says y^ Emperor fro now forth my words shall cut as my ^werde / and than
they set him in a chayr and crown him / and than all the good towns
theraboute send to him presents so much that he shall have more than.C Camels
laden with old and silver beside other Iew^lles yt he shall have of lords of
precious stones and gold without nombre / and horse and rich clothes of camac^s
and tartaryns and such other.

What countries and kyngdoms lie next to ye land of Cathay and the frontes
thereof. ca.lxxix.
THis land of Cathay is in Asye the deep / and this same land marches
toward y^ west upon the kyngedom of Ser^y the which was sometime to one of the
three kings that went to seek our lord in Bethleem / and all those yt come of
his kynne are christian. These men of Tartary drink no wine. In the land of
Corosaym that is at the north side of Cathay is right great plente of good but
no wine / the which has at the eest side a great wilderness that lasts
more than an hundred Iourneys / and the best cite of that land is called
Corosaym and thereafter is the land so called / and men of this land are good
warryoures and hardy / and thereby is the kingdom of Comayn / this is ye most
and the gretest kyngedom of the world / but it is not all Inhabyte / for in
one place of that land is so great cold yt no man may dwell there for cold
/ and in an ^^her place is great hete that no man may dwell there / and there
are so many feyghes that a man wot not on what side he may torn him / and in
this land are but few trees berynge fruit. In this land men lie in tents
and they brenne dounge of bestes for defaute of wood. This land dyscendeth
toward Pruyse and Rossy / and thorugh this lord renneth the river Echell yt
is one of the greteste ryuers in the world / and it is frosen so hard every
year that men fight thereupon in great batayles on horse / and footmen more
than hundred thousands at ones. And a little fro that river is the great see
of Occean that they call Maure / and between this Maure and Caspye is a full
strayte passage too go toward Ynde and therefore king Alexander did make
there a cite that men call Alexander for to keep that passage / so that no
man may pass but if he have leave / and now is that cite called Port de fear
/ and the pryncypall cite of Comayn is called sarachys / this is one of y^ three
ways to go in to Ynde / but through this way may not many men goo but if it be
in winter. and this passage is called Berbent. And an other way is for too goo
from the land of Turkescon thrughe Persy / and in this way are many Iourneys
in wyldernes. And ye third way is that comes fro Cosmane and gooth through the
great cite and thrughe the kingdom of Abachare. And ye shall understand that
all these kyngedomes and lands unto Persy are holden of the great Chane of
Cathay and many other / and therefore he is a full gretelorde of men and of
land.

Of other ways coming from Cathay toward the Greeks see. And also of the
Emperor of Persy. ca.lxxxx
NOw have I devised you the lands toward the north to come fro y^ lands of
Cathay to the lands of Pruyse and Rossy where christian men dwell. Now shall I
deuyse to you other lands and kyngedomes in coming down fro Cathay too the
Greeks see where christian men dwell. And for as much as next the great Chane
of Cathay the Emperor of Persy is the gretest lord / therefore I shall speak
of him / and ye shall understand that he has two kyngdoms / the one begy^neth
eestwarde and is the kingdom of Turkescon / and it lasts westwarde to the sea
of Caspye / and southwarde to the land of Ynde / and this land is good and
plain and well manned / good cytees / but two most pryncypall of the cytees
are called Bacyryda and Sormagau^t. The other is the kingdom of Persy and
lasts fro the river of Physon unto the great Armony / and northwarde unto y^
see of Caspy / and southwarde to the land of Ynde / and this is a full
plenteuous country and good / and in this land are three pry^cypall cytees.
Nessabor. Saphan. and Sarmasse.

Of the land of Armony which is a good land and of the land of Myddy.
ca.lxxxi
THan is y^ land of Armony in which was sometime three kyngdoms / this is a
good lord and plent^uous. and it begins at Persy and lasts westwarde to
Turkey of length / and in bread lasts fro the cite of Alexandee y^ now is
called Port de fear unto y^ land of Myddy. In this Armony are many fair cytees
/ but Canryssy is most of name Than is the land of Myddy and is full long
and not broad / and begy^neth eestwarde at y^ land of Persy / and ynde the
less and lasts westwarde to ye ky^gdome of Caldee / and northwarde to little
Armony. In this Myddy are many great hills and little plain and there dwell
Sarasyns and other manner of men that men call Cordyns and Kermen.

Of the kingdom of George and of Abcan and many meruaylles. ca.lxxxij
THan next is the kingdom of Geroge y^ begins eestwarde at a great hylle
that men call Abyor / this land lasts fro Turkey too the great see and the
land of Myddy and the great Armonye. and in this land are two kings / one of
Abcan / and an other of George / but he of George is in subgeccyon to the great
Chane / but he of Abcan has a strong country and defends him well against
his enemies / And in thi^ land of Abcan is a great meruaylle / for there is a
country in this land that is nere three days long and about / and it is
called Hamfon / and that country is all covered with derkenesse / so that it
has no light yt no man may se there / and no man dare go in to that country
for the derkenesse. And nevertheless men of the con^tree thereby say that they
may sometime here therein the voice of men and horse whynynge and cocks crow and
they wot well that men dwell there / but they wot not what manner of men / and
they say this darkness came thrughe miracle of god that he did for christian
men there. For there was a wicked Emperor that was of Poy / and he was called
Saures and he pursued sometime all christian men too destroy / and did them make
sacryfyce to their false gods / and in that country dwelled many christian men
the which left all their goods and catelles and richesse and would go in to
Greece / and when they were all in a great ^^ayn yt is called Megon y^ Emperor
and his men came to sle y^ christian men / and than y^ christian men al set them
upon their knees and prayed to god / and anon came a thycke cloud and
ouerlapped y^ Emperor and all his host / so that he might not go away / and
so dwelled they in derkenes / and they came out never after / and the christian
went where as they would / and therefore they might say thus / Adn^o factu^ est
istud and est mirabile i^ oculis nostris. That is to say* Of our lord is this
done and it is wonderful in our eyes. Also out of this derke land comes a
river y^ men may se by good token y^ men dwell therein.

Of the land of Turkey and diverse other countrees and of ye land of
Mesopotamy. ca.lxxxiij.
THan next is the land of Turkey that marches to great Armony / and therein are
many countries as Capadoce. Sau^e. Bryke. Quesycyon Pytan and Geneth / in
echone of these countrees are many good cytees / and it is a plain loud and
few hills and few ryuers / and than is the kingdom of Mesopotamye that
begy^neth eestwarde at flom of Tygre at a Cite that men call Mosell / and it
lasts westwarde to the flom of Eufraten to a cite that men call Rochaym / and
westwarde fro high Armony unto the wilderness of Inde the less / and it is a
good land and plain / but there is few ryuers and there is but two hills in
that loud / the one is called Symar / and the other Lyson / and it marches
unto the land of Caldee. And ye shall wete that the land of Ethyope marches
eestwarde to ye great wilderness / westwarde to y^ land of Nuby southwarde to
y^ land of Marytan / and northwarde to ye reed see / and than is Marytane y^
lasts fro y^ hills of Ethyope unto Lyby ye high and ye low yt lasts to
the great see of Spain.

Of diverse countrees and kyngdoms and yles and meruaylles beyond the land of
Cathay. ca.lxxxiiij
NOw have I said and spoken of many things on this side of y^ great kingdom of
Cathay of whom many are obeysaunt to ye great Chane / Now shall I say of some
lands and countries and yles yt are beyond the land of Cathay. Who so gooth
fro Cathay to Ynde. the high and the low he shall go thrughe a kingdom y^ men
call Cadissen and is a great land / there grows a manner of fruit as it were
gourdes / and when it is ripe men cut it asonder and men find therein a be
as it were of flesh of bone and blood as it were a little lamb without
wolle and men ete the beast and the fruit also and that is a great meruayl.
Nevertheless I said to them yt I held that for no mernayle / for I said y^ in
my country are trees that bear fruit that become birds fleing and they are
good to ete / and that y^ falls in water lived / and tthat that falls on
the earth deyed and they had great marvel of this. In this land and mani
other about there are trees that bear clowes and nutmygges and canell and many
other spyces. And there are vynes that bear so great grapes that a strong man
shall have enough to do to bear a cluster of the grapes. In that same land
are the hills of Caspye that men call Vber / and among those hills are the
Jews of the.x. kinds enclosed within that men call Gog and Magog and they
may not come out on no side. There was enclosed.xxij. kings with their folk
y^ dwelled between the hills of (...) king Alexander chased them thither
among those hills / for he trusted for to have enclosed them there thorugh
w^rkynge of men but he might not / and when he saw that he m^^^t not he prayed
to god that he would fulfill tha^ he had begone / and god herd his prayer and
enclosed the hills together so yt the Jews dwell there as they were locked in
/ and there is hills all about them hat at the one side / and there is the sea
of Caspye. And some men might ask / there is a see on one side why go they not
out there / for there to answer I that all if it be called a see it is no se
/ but a stange stondynge among hills / and it is the gretest stange of all
the world^ / and if they went over the sea they wot not where for too aryue /
for they can no speech but their own. And ye shall understand that the Jews
have no law of their own law in all the world / but they that dwell in
those hills / and yet they pay trybute for their land to the queen of
Armony. And sometime it is so that some of the Jews goo over the hills / but
^any men may not pass there too gyder for the hills are so great and high.
Nevertheless men say in that country there by that in the time of Antecryst
they shall do much harm to christian men^ and therefore all the Jews that
dwell in diverse parties of the world learn for too speak Ebrewe / for they
hope that the Jews that dwell among the hills aforesaid shall come out of
the hills and they speak all Ebrewe and not ell^ / and than shall these Jews
speak Ebrewe to them and leede them in to crystendome for to destroy christian
men. For these Jews say they wot by their prophecyes yt those Jews that are
among those hills of Caspy shall come out and christian men shall be in their
^^bgecco^n as they be under christian men. And if ye will w^te how they shall
find the passage out as I have understand I shall tell you. In time of
Antecryste a fox shall make his den in the same place where king Alexander
did make the gates and he shall dygge in the earth so long till he perce it
thorugh unto that he come among the Jews. And when they se this fox they
shall have great marvel of him / for they saw never such be / for other
beestes have they among them many / and they shall chase this fox and pursue
him unto that he be fled again in to his hole that he came fro. And than
shall they dygge after as he went unto they come to the gates yt Alexander
did make of grefe stones well dyght with syment / and they shall break these
gates and so shall they find the issue.

Of the land of Bactry and of many gryffons and other beestes. ca.lxxxv.
FRom this land men shall go unto the land of Bactry where are many wicked
men and fell. In that land are trees yt bear wolle as it were sheep of which
they make cloth. In this land are many Ypotaynes that dwell sometime on land
/ sometime on water and are half man and half horse / and they ete not but men
when they may get them. In this land are many gryffons more than in other
places / and some say they have the body before as an agle and behind as a
lion / and they say soth for they are made so / but the gryffon has a body
gretter than.viij. lions and gretter and stalworthyer than an hundred egles.
For certainly he will bear to his nest fleing an horse and a man upon his back
or two oxen yocked samen as they go at plough / for he has long nails on his
feet and great as it were horns o^ oxen / and of those they make cups there
to drink of / and of his rybbes they make bows to shote.

Of the way for to go to prester Iohans land which is Emperor of Ynde.
ca.lxxxvi.
FRo this land of Bactry men goo many a days Journey to the land of prester
John that is a great Emperor of Ynde / and men call his land the isle of
Pantoxore. This Emperor prester Johan holds great land and many good cytees
and good towns in his kingdom / many great yles and large. For this land of
Ynde is all departed in yles by cause of great flodes that come out of Paradyse
/ and also in the sea are many great yles The best cite that is in the isle of
Pantoxore is called Nyse / for that is a noble cite and rich. Prester Johan
has under him many kyngee and many diverse people / and his land is good and
rich but not so rich as the land of the great Chane / for merchants come
not so much thither as they do in to the land of the great Chane for it is to
long a way. And also they find in the isle of Cathay all that they have need
of / as spycery clothes of gold and other richesse. And all if they might have
better chepe in the land of preester Johan than in the land of Cathay and
more fyner / nevertheless they would let it for the long way and great
pe^yls in the sea / for there are many places in the sea where are great Roches
of a stone that is called adamande / the which of his own kind draws to
him iron / and for as much that there should pass no ship that had nails of
iron for it should draw it to him / therefore they dare not wend in to that
country with ships for dread of adamandes. I went ones in that see and saw
as long as it had been a great isle of trees and stocks and branches growing
/ and the shypman sayd^ to me that those was of great ships that were
dwelling there thorugh the virtue of the adamandes and of things that were in
the ships were those trees sprongen and waxen / and such Roches are there
many in diverse places of that see and therefore dare no shypman pass that
way. And an other also that they dread the long way / and therefore they goo
most all to Cathay and that is nerer unto them. And yet is it not so nere but
them behooves fro Venys or fro Geene be in see toward Cathay.xi. or.xij.
months. The land of prester John is long and merchants pass thither
thorugh the land of Persy and come unto a Cite that men call Hermes / for a
phylosophre that men called hermes founded it / and they pass an arm of the sea and come to an other cite that men call Saboth and there find they all
marchau^dyses and popyniayes as great plente as larkes in our country. In this
country is little whete or barley and therefore they ete rise and milk and
chese and other fruytes. This Emperor prester Johan weddeth commonly the
daughter of the great Chane and the great Chane his daughter. In the land of
prester John is many diverse things and many prec^ous stones so great and so
large that they make of them vessels platers and cups and many other things
of which it were to long to tell / but some what of his law and of his faith
shall I tell you.

Of the faith and believe of prester Johan / but he has not all ye full believe
as we have. ca.lxxxvij.
THis Emperor prester Johan is christian and a great part of his land also /
but they have not all the artycles of our faith / but they believe well in the
fader and the sone and the holy ghost and they are full devout and true one to
an other / and they make no force of catell / and he has under him.lxxij.
prouynces and countries and in echone is a king / and those kings have other
kings under them. And in this land are many meruayles / for in that land is
the grauelly see y^ is of sonde and of grauel and no drop of water / and it
ebbeth and flows with right great wawes as an other see does and it is never
still ne never in rest and no man may pass that land beyond it. And all if
it so be that there is no water in yt see / yet men may fy^de there in right
good fysshe and of other facyon and shape than is in any other sees / and also
they are of full good savor and sweet and good to ete. And at three Iourneys
fro that see are great hills through which renneth a great flood that comes
fro Parady se and it is full of precious stones and no drope of water / and it
renneth with great wawes in to the grauelly see. And this flood renneth three
days in the weke so fast and stereth great stones of the rocks with him that
make much noise / and as soon as they come in to the grauelly see they are
no more seen / and in those three days when it renneth thus no man dare come in
it / but the other days men may goo therein where they will. And also beyond
y^ flood toward the wilderness is a great plain also s^ndy and grauelly
among hills / and in yt plain gro we trees that at the rysynge of the son
each day begin to grow / and so grew they to myddaye and bear fruytes but
no man dare ete of that fruit / for it is a manner of iron* and after myddaye
it turned again in to the e^the / so yt when the son gooth down it is no
thing seen / and so does it every day And there is in yt wilderness many
wild men with horns on their heedes and right hydeous / and they speak not but
grunt as swyne. And in that country are many popyniayes that they call in
their langage pystak and they speak through theyr^ own kind as apertly as a
man / and those that speak well have long tongues and large and on every foot
five toos* there are some that have but three toos and tho same speak naught or
very lyteli.

How the Emperor preester Johan when he gooth to battle has three crosses
borne before him of fine gold. ca.lxxxviij.
THis Emperor preester Johan when he gooth to battle he has no baner borne
before him / but he has born before hy^ three crosses of fine gold and those
are great and large and well dyght with precious stones / and for to keep each
cross is ordained a thousand men of arms and mo than an hundred thousand on
foot in manner as men keye a standarde in battle in other places and he has
men without nombre when he goth to any battle against any other lord. And when
he has no battle but rydeth with preuy company than does he bear before him
but a cross of tree not painted and without gold and precious stones and all
plain in token y^ our lord Ihu christ suffeed death on a cross of tree. And
also he has born before him a plate of gold full of earth in token that his
lordshyp and ^^^^ey shall torn to naught and his flesh shall torn to earth.
And also he has borne before him an other vessel full of Iewelles and gold
and precious stones in token of his nobley and his might.

Of the most dwelling place of prester Johan in a cite called Suse. ca.lxxxix.
ANd he dwells commonly at the cite of Suse and there is his pryncypall palace
that is so rich that marvel is to tell / and above the pryncypall toure of
the palace are two pomels of gold all round / and each one of those has two
carbuncles great and large yt shine right clear on the night And the pryncypall
gates of this palace are of precious stones that men call Sardyn / and the
borders of the bars are of yuory / and the wyndowes of the hal^e and chambres
are of crystal. And tables that they ete of some are of Emeraudes some are of
mastyk / some of gold and precious stones / and the ^ylers that bear the
tables are of such stones also and the greces on which the Emperor gooth to
his see where he sytteth at mete one is of mastyk an other of crystal an other
of Iaphy grene an other of dyasper an other of sardyn an other of cormlyn a
another of sempton / and that he sets his foot up on is of crysolytes and all
these greces are bordured with fine gold and well dyght with great perles and
other precious stones / and the sides of his sege are Emeraudes bordured with
gold and with precious stones / the pylers in his chamber are of fine gold
with many carbuncles and other such stones that give great light on the night
/ and all if the carbuncles give great light nevertheless there brenneth each
night.xij. great vessels of crystal full of bame to give good smell and to
drive away wicked air. The form of his bed is all of saphyre well bound
with gold to make him to sleep well and for to destroy lechery / for he will
not lie by his wives but thryes in the year after the sesons and all only for
getynge of childern. And he has also a fair palace at the cite of Nyse where
he dwells when he will but the air there is not so well tempred as it is at
the cite of Suse. And he has every day in his court more that.xxx. th^usande
men without comers and goers / but.xxx. thousand there and in the country of
the great Chane spend not so much as.xij. thousand in our country / he has
evermore.vij. kings in his court to serve him / and echone of them serves a
month and with these kings serve always.lxxij. dukes and CCC. Earls / and
every day ete in his court.xij. archebysshops and.xx. bishops. The patrya^ke
of saint Thomas is as he were a pope / and arc^ebysshops and bishops and
abbottes all are kings in yt country / and some of the lords is master of
y^ halle some of y^ chamber / some stuarde / some marshall and some other
officers and therefore he is full rychely served and his land lasts in bread
four months Journey / and it is of length without mesure.

Of a rich man in prester John's land named Catolonabes and of his gardeyne.
ca.lxxxx.
IN an isle of prester Iohans land that men call Myscorach and therein is great
plente of goods and much riches and many precious stones In that land was a
rich man not long agone that men called there Catolonabes / he was full rich
and he had a fair castle on an hylle and strong / and he had made a wall
all about the hylle right strong and fair within that he had a fair gardeyne
wherein were many trees berynge all mane^ of fruytes y^ he might find / and he
did plant therein all manner of herbs of good smell and that bare flowers /
and there was many fair wells and by them was made many fair halles and
chambres well dyght with gold and asure / and he had made there diverse
stories and beestes and birds y^ song and turned by engyne and orbage as they
had be all quycke / and he had in his gardayne that he might find to make a
man solace and comfort / and he had also there in that gardeyne maidens within
the age of.xv. year the fairest that he might find and men childern of the
same age / and they were cladde with clothes of gold and he said that the same
were angels / and he had do make three hills fair and good all enclosed about
with precious stones of Iaspye and crystal and well bound with gold and
perles and other manner of stones / and he had made a conduyte under the earth
so yt when he would the walls ran sometime with milk sometime with wine
sometime with honey / and this place is called Paradyse. And when any young
bachelere of that country knight or squire comes to him for solace and
dysporte / he ledeth him in to his Paradyse and shows unto him all these
diverse things / and diverse songs of birds and also of his damoysels and
his wells / and he did stryke diverse Instruments of musyke in an high
toure that might be seen and said those were angels of god / and that plac^
was Paradyse that god has granted to those that byleued when he said. Dabo
vobis terra^ fluente^ lac et mel. That is to say. I shall give you land
flowynge milk and honey. And than this rich man did these men drink a manner
of drink of which they were dronken and he said to them if they would deye
for his sake that when they were deed they should come in to his Paradyse / an^
they should be of the age of those maidens and should dwell always with them
/ and he should put them in a fair Paradyse where they should se god in his
Joy and in his mageste / and than they granted to do what he would / and he
badde them go and slay such a lord or a man of the country that he was wroth
with / and that they should have no dread of no man / and if they were slain
themself for his sake he should put them in his Paradyse when they were deed.
And so went those bachelors to slay great lords of the country / and were
slain themself in hope to have that Paradyse / and thus he was avenged of his
enemies thorugh his deserte. And when rich men of the country perceived this
malice and cautele and the will of this Catolonabes they gadred them together
and assailed the castle and slew him and destroyed all his goods and his
fair places and richesse that were in his Paradyse / the place of the walls
is there yet and some other things / but yt richesse is not there and it is
not long ago sith he was destroyed.

Of a meruaylous vale that is beside the river of Physon. ca.lxxxxi.
ANd a little fro that place on the lift fyde beside the River of Physon is a
great ^^teruayle. There is a vale between two hills and that is four mile
long / and some men call it the valay enchaunted / some the valey of deuy^les
/ some the valey peryllous / and in that valey are many tempests and a great
noise and hydeous every day and night / and sometime as it were a noise of
Taburynes of ^akers and of trompettes as it were at a great feast. This valey
is all full of deuylles and has been always / and men say there yt it is an
enter to hell. In this valey is much gold and silver / wherefore many christian
men and other go thy der for couetyse of that gold and silver / but few of
them come out again for they are anon strangled with deuylles / and in
mids of that vale upon a roche is a vysage and the heed of a fend bodyly
right hydeous and dredefull to se / and there is no thing seen but the heed to
the sholders / but there is no christian man in the world no other so hardy
that he ne should have great dread for to behold it / for he beholds each
man so sharply and so felly / and his eyes are so sterynge and so sprenkelynge
as fire, and he changes so often his cou^tenau^ce that no man dare come nere
for all the world / and out of his mouth and his nose comes great plente of
fire of diverse colors / and sometime is the fire so stynkynge that no man may
suffer it / but always a good christian man and that is stable in the faith may
go there in without harm if they shryue them well and bliss them with the
token of the cross than shall the deuylles have no power of them. And ye
shall understand yt when my fellows and I were in tha^ valey we had full great
thought if we should put our bodies in adventure to go through it / and some of
my fellows accorded thereto / and some would not accord thereto / and there was
in our company two freres mynours of Lombardy and they said if any of us would
go in they would also / as they had said so upon trust of them we said that
we would go and we did sing a mass and we were shryuen and houseled and we
went in.xiiij. and when he came out we were but.x. and we wyste not wheder our
fellows were lost there or yt they turned again but we saw no more of them /
other of our fellows yt would not go in with us w^nte about ^p an other way
for to be before us and so they were / and we went through the valey and saw
there many meruayllous things / gold silver and precious stones and Iewelys
great plente on many sides as us thought / wheder it was as it seemed I wot not
for I touched them not / for the deuylles are so subtle and queynt yt make
many times a thing to seem y^ it is not for to deceive men / and therefore I
would touch no thing for dread of enemies y^ I saw in many lykenesses what
of deed bodies yt I saw lie in the valey / but I dare not say that they were
not all bodies but they seemed bodies through making of deuylles / and we were
often casted down to y^ earth through wind and thonder and tempests / but god
he^ped as always and so passed we through y^ valey without peril and harm
thanked be god almighty y^ kept us well.

Of an ylonde where in dwelled people as great as geauntes of.xxviij. or.xxx.
foot of length and other things. ca lxxxxij.
ANd beyond that valey is a great isle where people are as great as geau^tes
of.xxviij. foot or.xxx. foot long / and they have no clothing but bestes
skynnes that hang on them / and they ete no bread but flesh raw and drink
milk / and they have no honses and they ete gladlyer flesh of men than of
other / and men said us that beyond yt isle is one isle where are gretter
geau^tes as of.xlv. or.l. foot long / and some say of.l. cubytes long but I
saw not them / and among those geau^tes are great sheep as it were young
oxen and they bear great wolle / these sheep have I seen many times. An other
isle is there northwarde where are many yil and fell women and they have
precious stones in their eyes / and they have such kind yt if they behold
any man with wrath they slay them of the beholdynge as the baselyske does. An
other isle is there of fair folk and good where the custom is such yt the
first night yt they are wedded they take a certain man that is ordained
therefore and do him lie by their wives to have their maydenhede and they give
him great reward for his travail / and those men are called Gadlybyryem / for
men of y^ cou^tr^ hold it a great thing to make a woman no maiden / and if it
be so yt the husbonde find her a maiden the next night after / for perauenture
he that lay by her was dronken or for any other cause the husbonde shall
plain of him to the law that he has not done his devour / and he shall
grievously be punysshed and chastysed / but after y^ first night they keep their
wives well y^ there speak not with those men / and I asked what was the cause
why they had that custom / and they said sometime men lay with their wives
first and none other and their wives had serpents in their bodies and stonged
their husbonde on their yerde and their bodies and so was many man slain / and
therefore had they yt custom to let other men have their maydenhede for dread
of the death and thus they suffer them to assaye the passage or they put them
unto adventure.

Of women which make great sorrow as their childern are borne and great Joy
when they a^^ deed. ca.lxxxxiii.
ANd other isle there is where women make great sorrow when their childern are
born and when they are deed they make great Joy and cast them in a great fire
and brenne them / and they yt love well their husbondes when they are deed
they cast them in a fire to brenne also / for they say yt fire shall make
them clean of all fylth and vices and they shall be clean in an other wo^lde /
and the cause why they weep when their childern are born and yt they make Joy
at their death / they say, a child when he is borne comes in to this world
to have travail and sorrow and heuyne^^ / and when they are deed they go to
paradyse where ^yuers are of milk and honey and there is life and Joy and
plente of goods without travail and sorrow. In this isle they make their
kings by chesynge / and they che^e him not for his richesse ne his nobley but
him that is of good condycyons and most ryghtwys and true yt Iuged every man
truly little and much after their trespass / and the king may Judge no man to
death without counsel of his barons and y^ all they assent. And if so b^ that
the king do a great trespass as slay a man o^ such other he shall deye also /
but he shall not b^ slain / but they shall defend and forbede yt noman be so
hardy to make him company ne to speak with him ne give him mete ne drink and
thus he shall deye / they spare noman that has done trespass for love ne for
lordeshyp ne richesse nor nobley but they do him right after that he has
deserved.

Of an ylonde where a men wedde their own daughters and kynnes women.
ca.lxxxxiiij.
THere is an other isle where is great plent^ of people / and they ete never
flesh of hares ne of hens ne of goos yet is there many of the^ but they ete
gladly flesse of all other beestes and they drink milk. In this country they
wedde their own daughters and other of their kynne as them lyketh / and if
there be.x. or.xij. then in one house echo ne of their wives shall be comen to
other / and at night shall one have one of the wives and an other night an
other / and if she have any child she may give to which of them she will so
yt noman woe te if it be his or not. In this land and many other places of Y^de
are many cocodrylles that is a manner of a long serpent and on nyghtes they
dwell on water and on days they dwell on land and roches and they ete not in
winter. These serpents slay men and ete them wype^de and they have no tongue.
In this country and many other men cast sede of cotton and sow it ech^ year
and it grows as it were small trees and they berecotton. In Araby is many
birds / that some men call Gyrsantes that is a full fair be and is higher
than a great courser or a stead but his neck is nere.xx cubytes long / and
his croupe and his tail is like an heart / and he may look over an high house
/ and there is many camylyons yt is a little be and he eteth ne drynketh
never / and he changes often his color / for sometime he is of one color
and sometime of an other / and he may change him in to all colors that he will
save black and reed. There are many wild swyne of many colors and as great
as oxen / and they are spotted as it were small fawnes / and there are lions
all white / and there be other beestes as great as great stedes yt men call
Lonhorans and some men call them Tontes and their head is black / and three
long horns i^ his front as cuttynge as sharp swerdes / and he chaseth and
will slay the olyfauntes. And there is many other manner of bestes of whom it
were to long for too write all.

Of an other ylonde where in dwells full good people and true. ca.lxxxxv.
THere is an other ylonde good and great and plenteuous where are good men and
true and of goodly life after their faith / and all if they be not christian.
Nevertheless of kind they are full of good virtues and they fle all vices and
all sin and malice / for they are not enuyous ne proud ne couytous ne
lecherous ne glotenous / and they do not unto an other man but that they would
he did too them / and they fulfill the.x. commandments / and they make no
force of richesse ne of having / and they swear not but say ye and nay / for
they say he that ^wereth he will dysceyue his neighbor / and some men call
this the isle of Bragamen / and some call it the land of faith / and thorughe
it renneth a great river that men call Thebe / and generally all men in those
yles and other thereby are truer and ryghtwyser than are in other countries. In
this isle are no thieves ne murderers ne comune woman ne beggars / and for as
much they are so true and so good that there is no tempest ne thonder ne war
ne hunge^ ne other trybulacyons / and thus it seems well that god loved them
well and is well paid of their troth and their deeds / and they believe in god
that made all thing and him they worship and they live so ordynatly in mete
and drink yt they live right long / and many of them deye without sykenesse
yt kind faylleth them for aege.

How king Alexander sent his men thither for to win that land. ca.lxxxxvi
ANd king Alexander sometime sent his men to win that land. And they sent
him lettres that said thus. What behooves a man to have all the world y^ is
not content there with / thou shalt find no thing in us why thou sholdest
make war upon us / for we have no richesse ne tresoure / and all the goods
and catell of our country are comune / our metes that we ete are our
richesse. And instead of tresoure of gold and silver we make our tresoure
peace and accord of love / and we have naught but a cloth upon our bodies / our
wives are not arrayed rychely too pleasynge / for we hold it a great fooly a
man to dygh^e his body to make it to seem fayrer than god made it. We have been
evermore in peace till now that thou will dysheryte us. We have a king among
us not for need of the law ne to deem no man / for (...) are no trespassours
among us but all on^^ ((...) to be obedyent to him / and so may (...) not
take from us but our good peace. And when king Alexander saw this lettre / hy^
thought al thus yt he should do to much harm if he troubled them and sent to
them y^ they should keep well their good manners and have no dread of him.

Of an other ylonde where also dwells good people in and is called Synople.
ca.lxxxxvij.
THan is there an other ylonde that is called Synople where in also are good
people and true and full of good faith / and they are much like in their
living to the men before said / and they go all naked. And in to that ylonde
came king Alexander. And when that he saw their good faith and truth and
their good believe / he said that he should do to them no harm / and badde
them ask of him richesse and naught else and they should have it. And they
answered that they had riches enough when they had mete and drink to
sustain their bodies / and they said also that richesse of this world is
naught worth but if it were so that he might grant them that they should
never deye that would they pray him. And Alexander said y^ might he not do for
he was dedely and should dey as they should. Than said they why art you so
proud and would win all the world and have in thy subgeccyon as it were a
god and you have no term of thy life / and you wylt have all richesse of the
world the which shall forsake the or you forsake it / and you shall bear no
thing with the / but it shall dwell to other / but as you was borne naked so
shall you be done in earth. And Alexander was greatly astonyed of this answer /
and if it be so y^ they have not the artycles of our faith / nevertheless I
believe that god loves them well and their good entencyon and yt he takes
their service to gree as he did of Job yt was a paynym the which he held for
his true servant and many other. I believe well yt god loves all those y^ love
him and serve him mekely and truly and yt despise the vain glory of the
world as these ^en do and as Job did / and therefore said our lord thorugh
the mouth of Ysaye the prophet thus. Pona^ eis multiplices leges meas. That is
to say I shall put to them my laws in many manners / and the gospel says
thus. Alias oues habeo que no^ su^tex hoc ouili. That is to say. I have other
she pe y^ are not of this fold / and there to accords the vysyon that Saint
Peter saw at Iaffe how the angel came fro heaven and brought with him of all
manner of beestes as serpents and fowls in all manner and said to saint Peter.
Take and ete. And saint Peter answered. I ete never of unclean best. And the
angel said to him. Non d^^as i^n. unda q^deus mu^dauit. That is to say.
Call thou not those things unclean that god has cleansed. This was done in
token that men should not have many men in despyte for their diverse laws /
for we wot never whom god loves and whom god hates.

Of other two yles yt one is called Pytan wherein be little men yt ete no mete /
and in that other isle are the men all rough of feathers. ca.lxxxxviii.
THere is an other isle that men callle Pytan men of this land tylle no land
for they ete naught / and they are small men but not so small as Pygmeens.
These men live with smell of will de apples / and when they go far out of the
country they bear apples with them / for anon as they lose y^ savor of apples
they deye / they are not reasonable but as it were bestes. And there is an other
isle where the people are all feathers but the face and the palms of their
hondes. These men go as well above these as on the land and they ete flesh
and fysshe all raw. In this isle is a great river that is two mile broad and an
half that men call Renemar.

Of the wilderness wherein that grow the trees of the son and of the moon.
ca.lxxxxix.
ANd beyond that river is a great wilderness as men that have been there say.
In this wilderness as men say are the trees of the son and of the moon yt
spoke to king Alexander and told him of his death / and men say that folk yt
keep these trees and ete of the fruytes of them they live. four or five
hundred year through virtue of the fruit / and we would gladly have gone thither
/ but I believe that an hundred thousand men of arms should not pass they
wilderness for prete plente of wild b^stes as dragons and serpents that slay
men when they have any. In this land is many olyfau^tes all white and blewe
without nombre / and vnycornes and lions of many manners. Many other yles are in
the land of prestes Johan that were to long to tell and much richesse and
nobley of precious stones in great plente. I believe that we have herd say why
this Emperous is called preester Johan / but for those that wot it not I shall
say There was sometime an Emperor that was a noble prince and doughty / and he
had many christian knights with him / and the Emperor thought he would see the
manner of service in christian chirches and than was chirches of crystendom in
Turkey Surry and Tartary Jerusalem Palestyn Araby and Alapy and all the lands
of Egypt. And this Emperor came with a christian knight in to a church of Egypt
and it was on a saterdaye after Wytsondaye when the bishop made ordres / and
he beheld the service and he asked of the knight what folk those should be yt
stood before the bishop / and the knight said they should be priests and he
said he would no more be called king ne Emperor but priest and he would have
the name of him yt came first out of the priests / and he was called Johan and
so have all the Emperors sythen be called preester Johan. In that land are
many christian men of good faith and good law / and they have priests to sing
mass and they make y^ sacrament as men of Greece do but they say not so many
things as o^r prestes do for they say not but yt the apostles said as saint
Peter and saint Thomas and other apostles when they ^ange mass and said Pater
n^. And the words with the which gods body is sacred / we have many
addycyons of popes that have been ordained of which men of those countries
know not.

Of a great ylonde and kyngedom called Taprobane. ca.C.
Toward the eest side of preester Iohans land is an isle yt men call
Taprobane / and is right good and fructuous / and there is a great king and a
rich and he is obedyent unto prester Johan and yt king is always made by
eleccyon. In this isle are two wynters and two summers / and they shere corn
twyes in the year / and all times in the year are gardeyns florysshed. There
dwells good people
