Pyers Plowma^s exhortation to the Parlyamenthouse.
IT behooves us ernestly to pray unto God / that likewise as he has given unto
the king of this realm / a fervent zele to set forth his truth / and
strengthened him with a right worthy protector and most prudent counselors
for ye setting forth of the same / eue^ so that he will vouchsafe to se^de our
said king like zeal and strength to make / set forth / and cause to be kept
such good polytike laws and statutes as this Realm may be thereby replenyshed
with justice requitie and wealth, that in all regions where as it shall be
reported how that we of this realm have expelled all vain tradicions of men /
and received the true religion of Christ / that there also it may be said how
that we have thereto received the fruteful blessing of God, promised unto the
followers of his word. But except many inconveniences in this realm be
redressed / it is rather to be feared least that the Gospel be slaundred
through us. Nevertheless even as in the time of our greatest error and
ignorance, the fat priests woe(...) never confess that any thing concernin^
our religion was amiss, worthy to be reformed / even so now at this day there
be many fat merchants which would have no reformation in the common wealth
affirming that therein al things be well / but he that will be conuersaunt with
the come^ sort of the poor comens, shall (if he stop not his ears, nor hyde
not his eyes) both hear se and perceive the case to be far other wise. He
shall hear tell that afewe rich me^ have engrossed up so many fermes and sheep
pastures / and have decayed so many whole towns / that thousands of the poor
comens can not get so much as one ferme / nor scant any litell house to put
their head in. It is not agreeable with the gospel that a few parsons shall
live in so great abou^daunce of wealth / and suffer so many their christian
brothers to live in extreme poverty. It is contrary to the humanity used even
amongst the heythen infidels, one man to hold so great a quantity of ground
/ that by means thereof his other neighbors shall not have whervppon to get
their living. It is not used amongst the worst kind of ravening beasts, that
one shall snatche from an other that thing which he stands no need of, and
which he never shall be able to spend. But what may I lyken it unto / when a
few men for the only greadines of gathering superfluous things / shall keep
in their hands so much ground / and so many whole towns and feldes / that
thereby al their own native country shall come unto utter ruin and decay? I
would not that those ydell me^bres of this realm, which for ye mayntenau^ce of
their ydelnes would have al things in common / should think that I do now harp
of that string: far be such madness fro me / for that confusion would utterly
extinguish all industry unto all manner of good arts and qualities / and reduce
us unto a bestly trade of life. But I would rather wish that they which now in
this realm be the auctours of that opinion / should be sharply punished by the
maiestrates / as detestable enemies unto the common wealth / for he which
brings into a Realm sedicion or discord / brings in the most pernicious
thing that can be possible. And what thing can sooner move sedicion, than to go
about to take from all good men / all those their possessions and goods /
which they and their auncetours have by their prowes / virtue and industry
obtained and gotten / and to participate the said lands and goods / unto the
slothful, vicious and ydell parsons? But admit that (which is impossible /)
all men would willinglye consent unto the taking away of the proprietye of
goods / yet is there no lykelyhod yt this realm could be so governed and
defended from enemies: for it any realm could be so maynteined / it should have
been in experience before this time in some countries. But Aristotle in his
politica, writing of all the sundry kinds of gouernmentes of comme^wealthes in
ye universal world, could not find so much as one little City governed in
such sort: it is much more impossible yt such a realm as this / being so
populous, and much of the people being so naturally given to sloth / vice and
ydelnes / should be well ordered by such means. Bnt these men would feign
persuade their opinion by scripture / saying that two or three places in the
scripture make evidently for their purpose / yet will they not co^fer therwt all
yose other places wc be innumerable / yt make directly to the contrary. Would
you not think hi^ to be a mad taylour which would go about to persuade you to
take a coat of his making / because one sleue of the coat is fyt enough for
you / all the reside we of the coat / being so sca^te and unfit that it can by
no means be put upon your back. And are not they much madder / with findi^g
one or two textes in the scripture wc seme^ to take away propriety of goods /
and do not regard how their opinion agrees with the eight commandment / which
says: thou shall not steal / and with the tenth / which inhibiteth us to
couetour neighbors house / or our neighbors wife / his servant / his maid,
his ox / his ass or any thing that is our neighbors. And if their should be
no propriety / I pray you to what purpose shall these words sound which
shall be spoken by Christ at the day of judgment. When I was hungry ye gave me
meat / and when I was athrust ye gave me drink etc. Or wherefore does Christ
in ye. vi. chap. of mat. will us / when we give our alms to give it secretly?
If I should here reke^ up al ye places in scripture wc make directly against
this fo^d opinion / I might be accounted more the^ half mad to bestow so much
time in a matter so manifest: therefore wisshi^g yt ye manteynours of this
franricke opinion may be well kept i^ a close house until their wits be
better come^ unto the^ I will return to my purpose and declar / unto you one
other inconvenience / which only if it be not remedied / is able to bring this
whole Realm unto utter ruin: for by the means of it / the most part of all
those poor como^s of this realm / which have no lands of their own / are
like by all lykelyhod of reason, within process of few years to be brought unto
extreme poverty. And for the proof hereof, let the naked truth set forth it
self. When all the great number of Abbays did stand here in Ingland, a great
part of the men of this Realm / were Monks / Chanons / Friars,
Chauntrypriestes / Pardonners / Heremites and such as had Idle liui^gs / by
those monks / chano^s / friars and chau^tripriests. And to the intent yt my
meaning herin may be ye better perceived: admit yt these Idle parso^s wc the
time which the residue of yo inhabitau^tes of this realm did bestow in going
of pilgrimages / in caruing painting and gylding of Images, in maki^g of
torches and waxca^dels / in keeping of so many supersticious holy days: admit
all these to counteruayle as though the third part of ye men of this realm had
then co^tinuallye lived in Idelnes as touching any necessary business, and that
the other two parts had then done all the necessary work wc was to be done in
ye whole realm / that is to say / manured ye ground to bring forth corn / and
victual / and done all the labor for the taking of fysh / for the maki^g of
cloth making of garments and all other things necessary / both for the^ selves
and for all those other Idell parso^s and for the whole realm. And it is not
to be supposed the contrary / but yt there shall be as many people in the realm,
when all those parso^s wc were monks / chanons / friars and chau^tripriests
shall be dead / as there were at such time when all ye said Abbeys did stand: but
the. ij. parts of ye me^ of this realm keeping no supersticious holydays / and
spending no time in pilgrimages nor such vanities / will be still able to do all
the necessary work in the realm / then the other iij. part must live in
Idelnes except some other work be devised for them But this great no^bre of
people shall the^ nether have lands nor pencions to mai^teyne them lyui^g in
Idelnes. Therefore if more work be not provided for them / what can ensue but
extreme poverty / beggary and misery? For when the foresaid Abbays did stand
/ that Husbandman which had two or three Sons, would for the most part /
find one of the^ at Scoole for a year or two until he might read the mass
book / and then make him either a monk hano^trier or chauntripriest, which
many times also should help his other brethern to some part or their living,
but now there is no such refuge: all must be put to labor. And like as three
score men can not be all sufficientlye armed for the wars with fourtye
harneysses / ne three score women can not all be spinning at home upon forty
wheles, no more can all those parsons in this realm which must now hereafter
have their liuinges upon labor be continuallye set to work / except they may
have more ground totylle or more of some other thing to work upon. And besides
all this they which were professed in these supersticious / relygions did
abstain from matrimonye / so yt now when marriage shall be fre for all men there
is like to be a greater i^crease of children then was in those days. But to
this some men will say / that although they had no wives of their own / yet
they lived not chaste. I grant that few of them lived chaste. And yet I deny
that the Roylme was any thing so much replenyshed with Children by their
unchasteness, as it would have been if they should have had wifes of their own /
for it is to be considered yt the most part of them are but comen
aduouterers. And those women wc lygh with more me^ then one / do not therefore
bring forth the more children. All these things considered it is no small
number of people that must now hereafter live by labor / over that there was
wha^ thabbeys did stand / so yt if some other provision be not made / it is
like to come to pass, yt shortly after the wars (for the wars have
hitherto found a great sort occupied / and clean ryd us of a great no^bre of
them wc should else have been either beggars or thieves) but when ye wars be
done / and they which be now children comen unto men's estate / by the reason
before declared, there shall be so many without fermes and disirous to have fermes
/ that they them selves by their high proffers shall cause them to be yet
again higher inhaunced / so that he only shall be able to live upon the said
fermes / which has no charge of children / and he which shall have any charge
of children / shall not be able (bryngyng up his children) to live upon any of
them / but shall every day be poorer and poorer until he and all his children
/ be at plain beggary. And likewise then the labouringe man, being then so
many of the^ / they shall be retained for so litel wages (having now respect unto
the high price of victual and cloth / and to the high re^t of their houses)
that he which shall be in health and having no childer, shall barely get by his
labor to find him self his necessary sustenaunce, so that he which shall
have any children / shall not by his labor be able to find him self and his
children. And thus shall the most part of the Realm be in poverty / one not
able to help an other. Is it like the^ that those few parsons which shall have
the abundance of riches / will every year continually depart from so great
so^mes of money as will serve for the releafe of so great a number? no surely,
for when they have had a far smaller no^bre / they suffered the^ to dye for
hunger in the streets. And for ye most part, ye wicked and the covetous
parso^s shall be ye greatest possessours of goods, whose propertye is always to
gather, and never to distribute / ready in taki^g / but slack in giving. When
so many shall be thus fallen into such extreme pouerte / what may then follow /
it greueth me to declare. But what need I to declare it / when every man may so
easily perceive it which thing if it should come to pass (as God forbid) then
would our great enmy ye bishop of rome and all his adherentes, insulte and
triumph over us / imputing our destruction / as a punishment / for the
suppressi^g of abbayes and chauntries. And so might it well be accounted / if
we should / when they were suppressed / being satisfied and stayed with their
worldly goods, proceed no further in redressing other abuses / nor in the
providing of liuinges for them wc were commonly wont to go into abbeys / or
other wise to have their lyuinges by the^ and by such other like kind of
ydelnes. Add unto this also that there is now at this day fewer several
fermes for the husbandeman to live upon / and less work for the labouri^ge
man / tha^ was in those days when the foresade abbeyes did stand. For a
great part of the said abbeylandes be either given, sold or leased unto
such lords and Gentelmen / as had lands before of their own. And for as
much as it is well nygh impossyble for them to ouersee so many servants as
might keep so great quantity of ground in tyllage / and desiringe to have the
whole profight of their ground them selves / they are driven (by their
infaciable covetousness) to convert al their grounds unto the pasturing of
sheep and such kind of beasts as they may receive the whole proffyght with
very litell charge of servants / so yt one man having in his occupying so
much ground as five hundredth parsons have heretofore with their labor gained
their lyuinge upon / shall kept perchance ten or twelve shepehardes and four
or five netherdes. So yt although there be all ready and shall be hereafter many
more parsons which must get their liui^ges upon labor then there was when
thabbeys did stand: yet yt not with standing / their is at this psent much less
ground put in tillage / the^ was when they stood. And by this means shall
this realm come much the sooner unto decay / if remedy be not had. For as the
number of men increase, which must live by Labor / so onght it to be
forsene that they may have whervppo^ to labor. For that shepemaster which
suffers one flock of his sheep to increase much in number / and does not
regard to provide suffyciente of Pastoure for them accoraccording to the
no^bre of his increase / he shall not only have no profight by thyncreasinge
of his sheep / but shall also put all the reside we of yt flock in danger of
the hu^gerrotte. This flock of laborers, are like daily to increase / but the
pastor they should live upon / which is work / does daily deminish. And is
like hereafter upon other occasion wc I have not here rehearsed / ever more and
more to be deminished. Hitherto I have declared certain causes why it is
requisite yt more work should be devised: desiringe you my lords with the
knights and burgoisses of ye parlyame^thouse yt ye will accept this my rude
boldness in good part, and not to impute it to arrogance for that I enterprise
amongst men of so high wisdom / to reason in matters of so great importance.
For like as the most expert mariners / in a great tempestuous wether / will not
disdain sometime to be admonisshed by an inferioure Parson / by cause that some
things may then come to there emembraunce of some one man, wc at that time an
other thinks not upon / even so the most wise Councillors and Maiestrates
/ in the comme^ affairs of ye Realm, will sometime vouchesafe to hear the
devise of a simple Subject.

Therefore / after pardon obtained for my bold enterprise and for my rude
language. I intend (under the correction of other better experienced) to show
my simple opinion by what means all the for said no^bre of people may have
plenty of work And then what proffit may thereby ensue unto the Royalme /
and unto the Kings Majesty. For these inconveniences and this imminent
mischeafe may be so met with / and in such sort remedyed and redressed /
that besides the proffit / which is taken by the Lands and goods of the the
said Abbayes Priories / Chauntries and Pilgrimages, the suppressing of them
and of such like Idelnes and Idell works, may be turned moreover unto an
other the greatest Commodity yt ever came unto this Royalme. That is only /
if all that multitude of People / which was wont to live so in Idelnes, may
always have work. And by two sundry meannes may it be brought to pass
that there may be more plenty of work throghout this realm: one is, by the
conuerti^g into pastor or Arable waiste and desolate grounds, now being
overflowed with water or ouergrowen with Brom / Ferrne whinnes or Fyrres / and
by the restrayninge of the forsayde Shepemasters and ingrossers of Fermes, that
they do not hereafter convert so much ground unto Shepepastours / and the^
to suffer all manner of corn to be yerelye transported over the seas as well as
any other kind of marchaundise. And for these purposes I have drawn forth
certain rude Bylles to be exhibited to you of ye Parliame^thouse / trustinge
that by your wysdomes / learning and knowledge / said of the same rude bylles
may be reduced into the due form of good statutes. An other way to cause the
forsaid great number of people to have more work, is by the causing of all
such manner of things being comonlye worn / occupied and spent within this
realm / now used to be brought from the parties of beyond the seas / and
being possible to be made wrought or had within this realm. As line^ cloth /
flax / and all thing made of flax or hemp: all things ready made of Ironsope
/ rapeoyle / say / stamin / worsteds / caps hattes and all such other things
to be made and wrought within this royalme / which thing may be brought to
pass / by the setti^g of a great subsidy / as a subsidy of four or five
shilli^ges of every pound valor / of all such kind of wares coming into this
realm from the parties of beyond the seas.

This may be best done when a subsidye should be else granted unto the kings
majesty for the mayntenaunce of his wars, wc thing should be also some part
of punishment unto our enemies, if we shall chance to have any beyond the
seas, for as much as they shall thereby have the less vent of their wares /
through which their reames shall be the more enfebled. And surely this kind of
subsidy for the mayntenaunce of the kings maiestyes wars / should not only
be more for the common wealth, but also much easelyer borne then such taxes
and subsidies as were heretofore wont to be leuyed / for no man shall pay any
thing in this kind of subsidy but they only which of their own voluntary
will, shall bye such wares coming from beyo^de ye seas: but if we shall not
have occasion to have any subsidye granted for the mayntenau^ce of wars /
yet for this forsayde consideracion the Subsidye may be inhaunced upon all such
wares coming inward. And the subsidye which is is now paid upon lead / tin
corn and cloth going outward / may be in consyderacion thereof remitted /
which shall be also a great cause that the more lead linne / cloth and corn
shall be wrought / made and labored for within this realm, but if it so be that
the kings majesty having no wars will not set any higher subsidy upon such
wares, yet at the least way for as much as the price of all manner of wares is
highlye rise^ sith the time of the making of the last rate: it is reason that
the wares coming inward be rated again at the value that they now be sold
for, or else the custume which shall be hereafter paid upon lynen cloth and
such kind of wares comi^g into this realm shall be so little in respect of ye
price they be here sold for, that men shall not have so good cause to be
driven unto the making of lynen cloth and such other things within this realm
as they had when the said rate was first made. It is no maruayle though this
my saying concerning the setting of a greater subsidy upon wares inward and
also some of the forsayde bylles shall be unto some men at the first very hard
to digest, but like as unto those me^ every thing is pleasant that sauoureth
of lucre, so ca^ they not abide the taste of ought that smells any thing
against their singular profight. And yet if they pondred the matter thoroughly
well / and would make a true definicion of vtilyte / they should find that it
were not against their profight. But they be so far blinded in covetousness yt
they can not or else will not forsee the true end of things. Therefore you of
the parliament house must do unto them as the loving parents do unto their
children when they co^strayne the^ to drink wormesedes or such other bitter
medecines for the preservation of their lives / although the chylderen / for
the bitterness of the medycyne / be never so loathe to receive it. Nor I maruayle
not though some of you the lords knights and burgoyses of the parlyamenthouse
be not at the first sight parswaded unto all these my sayings. For I being
altogether ignorant of the art of rethorycke / have not conningly let forth
this matter but only laid before you the naked truth in rude words, which
only bare truth if you substancially will ponder / I dout not but you shall
the^ easily perceive that by these means the said great number of people
which before were wont to live in Idelnes / shall not only gain their own
livings but also they shall both cause great su^mes of money to be yearly
brought i^to this realm for such corn as shall increase by their labor upon
tyllage. And furthermore cause great sums of money to be kept within this
realm / which was wont here to fore to be exchaunged into other Royalmes for
such lynen cloth and such other things. And for as much as I doubt least yt
my meaning herein be not so easy of all men to be perceived: to make the matter
more plain / admit yt when the foresaid Abbays did stand, we sent over ye
seas yearly into other Realms in woll, lead tin corn cloth and all other
kind of marchaundise, ye value of four hundredth thowsande pound, and yt we
did then receive again into the realm from ye said parties of beyond ye seas
yearly ye value of other four hundredth thowsande pound in other kind of
Marchaundise / admit also yt for as much as all those people which before were
wont to live Idelly in Abbays / Priories and chauntries / adding thereunto the
time which was accustumed heretofore to be Idelly bestowed in goi^g of
pylgrimages / in keeping of new founden holidays / in caruing, paynting and
gilding images in maki^g of copes / torches and waxs candels / all this time
before spent in idelnes and in unprofitable labors, hereafter employed upon
the tillage o^ the waste and desolate grounds, and in making and working of
such things as we hertofore were wont yearly to receive from the parties of
beyond the seas / admit (I say) that by the increase of the corn coming of
this tillage we may send over into the parties of beyond the seas yearly /
the value of one hundredth thousand pound more in corn, the^ we heretofore
were come^ly wo^t to do: and yt by the means of the line^ and such other
things being wrought within this realm, we shall need hereafter to receive
again in all those kind of marchau^dises comi^g from beyond ye seas / the
value of one hundredth. M. pound less then we hertofore were wont yearly to
receive / then shall therebe carried over ye seas yearly in all kind of
marchau^dise the value of five hundredth thousand pound / and received again
yearly in all kind of marchaundyse but the value of three hundredth thousand
pound / so yt the other two hundredth thousand pound must yearly be brought
into this realm either in gold or silver. And for as much as they have now
much gaynes beyond the seas / and this realm not a litell thereby in domaged /
in that they do counterfayte our new coined silver beyond the seas and send it
hither. It therefore good provision and narrow search be made that none of the
said counterfayted money be connuayed hither / then should all the foresaid
su^mes of money which shall come yerelye from beyond the seas for the foresaid
overplus in wares / be brought into this royalme in such gold and silver as ye
kings majesty may take advauntage by the coynage. Thus ye may perceive that by
these foresaid means the realm may be wonderfully enriched / the kings
majesty have great gaynes in his mintes, and every man that lists to labor
/ may gain him self an honest living. Yet I would not that any man should
think it possible by any worldly policy to defend this realm from utter
distructio^ / except we amend our sinful living. For if God be determined to
plage us / for our offenses / what can worldly policy prevail to the contrary?
And is their any hipocrisye more like to provoke ye wrath of god: or any
blasphemy more worthy of his indignacion / the^ busuly to pretend the most holy
Gospel, and yet nevertheless to be so void of all charity / yt it shall be taken
but for a small matter / and for a common practice amongst us / one man to
encroche so much ground in to his hands that he shall there by expel four or
five hundredth parsons from their liuinges? How does this trade of living agree
with the Gospel / seeing yt the chief point of our religion / yea and as
Christ him self says / all our religion consysteth in Louinge of GOD above
all things / and our neighbor as our selves? The more knowledge yt we have of
ye truth, the greater is our offense / and the more abundant yt the goodness of
god has been toward us / the more detestable is our in gratitude toward
him. For these injuries that we do unto the poor members of Christ / we do
unto hi^ says he. Therefore after such evident knowledge of the scripturs: and
after so manifest admonicio^ by ye preachers: what can solowe but the just
bengeance of God? if reformacion be not had. If your Childeren had so much
understanding to foresee the plage and vengeance of God / ready to be powered
down upon the whole realm / for this cruel oppression of the pore / which
so freely is suffe-suffered here to reygne amongst us / would they not
altogether knele upon their knees with the tears runni^g down by their chekes
rufullye loking toward you of the parliament house / and holding up their
hands (...) you altogether with one vo^ce / that you with all diligence and
have possible would se to the r^formacio^ hereof, that the dredefull wrath of
God might be spedely turned from (...) which (...) of ye (...) being on(...) of
other (...) Realm being reformed, (...) in wealth and prosperity all ye
realms in ye world: That the fame thereof with the renown of the most virtuous
king Edward the sixte / shall redounde at the furdest end of the world, to
the great praise of the Gospel* and to the high glory of god unto whom all
honor be referred for ever.
