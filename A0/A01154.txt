A true discourse of all that has happened in the most Christian Kings Army
since the ariuall of the Duke of Parma in France, and the joining of his forces
with the enemy, until the fifteenth day of this present month of September.
1590.
AFter that great and happy victory which it pleased God to give the King
against his enemies near to Eury the fourteenth of March last past, he also
vouchsafed to grant him such peculiar favor (unto conquerors not usual) as
thereby to be no whit puffed up either in deed or word, but contrariwise to
grow the more gracious and tractable, as may appear in his releasing of a
great part of the rigor of his Edicts and declarations against his rebellious
towns and subjects after the said victory more then before. Which cause was
worth unto him fiftene or sixtene good cities and towns, whereof only one held
out the battery, and all the rest yielded upon friendly composition, and have
since continued most firm, constant, and resolute in his service, as having
tried that transferring themselves from a tyranous usurpation to a lawful
dominion, their state was greatly amended. A few days after this overthrow,
the Lord of Villeroy one of the chief of the contrary faction, seeming
desirous to reclaim himself, and to provide for his particular safety, drew
near to Mant, where through his majesty's permission he had some communication
with Monsieur du Plessis Mornay, who for his part used him with such favorable
speeches concerning not only his own particular cause, but also the general,
that he fained himself willing to enterprise some treaty of peace. Afterward
he returned openly while the siege lay about Melune, and albeit his majesty
were advertised that this his legation was nothing but deceit: also that the
Ambassador might be first deceived, yet with this only confidence, that
with his sole discretion and franchize he might convert them from their bad
purposes into contrary resolutions, as many times it has fallen out, that set
conspiracies have been confounded by the innocent presence of those against whom
they should have been put in execution, he forbear not to receive him with as
great humanity, as if he had been assured that his Commission imported as good
purposes, as he was certain of the contrary, whereby the said Lord of
Villeroy found himself so surprised, that he did half confess this his
conversion, and protested that he would more faithfully emploie himself
thereabouts then before he had done. In the mean time his Majesty having in
a short space recovered all that lay upon the rivers of Sein, Marne, Yonne,
and Oyse, he determined to draw near unto the City of Paris (in purpose to
recover it, and to root out the rebellion in the same place where it first
began, yet with a mild and natural death deuoide of violence, terror or
conuulsion) which he found so weakly defended, that he might have carried it
with as small labor as any of the least towns in his kingdom: which his
ability continued the space of four months that he environed it, yea it not
only so continued, but became daily more easy in yt they yt were within, had
toward the end lost three parts of their men of service, and his majesty's
army was strengthened and augmented the one half: howbeit so often as it came
to deliberation, (as there might be diversity of Councels) his majesty
considering that Paris was the head City and principal ornament of his
Realm: that therein remained so many Princesses that were allied unto him, so
many good and ancient families, so many Churches and religious houses, with
persons appertaining to the service of the same, who for the most part
peradventure were innocent of this rebellion, and yet the said town being
taken by force, could not be exempt or freed from such excess and violence as
in so furious an accident can no way be eschued, could never be induced to
consent to that resolution before he had attempted all other means: yea hardly
would he grant to take the suburbs, not as a matter unnecessary to be done,
but for fear least the one might draw on the other: Also that the soldiers
seeing themselves so near to so good a booty, should have been hardly
restrained from proceeding farther, as in deed it was the greatest labor that
the king and the chiefest of his Captains had during the whole siege, to
restrain their soldiers from any farther enterprise: for there was no
difference to be made between the attempting to execute it and the taking of
the suburbs, which was performed at once without any resistance. Also that
which since has been seen, albeit repugnant to rule, viz. that the less
contains not the greater, yet seven or eight thousand soldiers that lodged
in the suburbs, kept enclosed above thirty thousand armed men that were in the
said town, ought to be proof sufficient, that the taking thereof perforce
could not have been avoided.

Hereupon his Majesty, to the end not to lose the said town, but to preserve
the honor of so many families, and to spare the shedding of such innocent blood
as might have bin spilt, resolved to tame them with want of food, and rather
with patience to bear out the delay of whatsoever siege, then to practice any
farther endeavor: wherein he had two purposes, either that it would fall out
through the said siege, that upon the said want, they that were within should
not be able to hold out, or else that the Duke of Maine would approach to their
succor, whereby he might have opportunity to fight with him, which was the
thing that he most desired, as seeking thereby rather to pluck up the root of
the mischief, then to cut off the branches. And had his majesty been as
resolute and implacable in the first, as he has showed himself most careful
in ye second, the town had undoubtedly been his. Indeed the reason of war
wills that being once resolved to fight and conquer the obstinacy of the
besieged with fasting and abstinence, we should not suffer any victuals
whatsoever to be brought in by any whomsoever, also that we should shut in all
that were within and not suffer any, so much as one, to come forth, to the end
that the more there were within, the sooner the victuals might be consumed: and
this rule ought to have bin observed with all severity and without favor or
exception. Yet during the last month of the siege that want and misery within
the town were so extreme, the cries so fearful of such numbers as daily dyed
in the streets for hunger, and of so many others, whose rage was such that
openly they eat the dogs raw: the houlings of the people, the lamentations of
such mothers as missed their children, did pearce not only the air but the
stone walls, so as his majesty could not abide to hear them with such beastly
obstinacy, as they that were the causers did see them with their eyes: yea
those that had yet some provision of victuals accounted all this people but
unprofitable souls, and thought long to have them all dead and cast away, so
that as the kings courage and magnanimity are invincible, so were his
humanity and clemency easy to be overcome and did soon stoop to these
monstrous pities, choosing rather to err in the rules of war than of nature,
even of his own nature which abounds in mildness and clemency. He
considered that all this people were Christians, that they were his subjects,
that the most part were peradventure innocent, and that therefore it was
requisite to release them from this despair wherein they were lost, and in the
end his good nature brake all bars of the laws of war. First he granted a
Passeport for all the women, maidens, and children, and for all the Scholars
that were willing to come forth: afterward he extended it to religious persons
and Church men: And finally he enlarged it to those that had been his greatest
enemies, yea he took care that at their coming forth they might be courteously
received throughout all his Towns, whither they list to repair. He suffered
the Princes and Princesses that were in the Town to be relieved with some
proportion of victuals, which since has been but badly considered: so that it
may be confessed that the siege continued longer by one month than it should,
and so consequently had not the due effect: howbeit, since this is the cause, it
is so holy and agreeable unto God, that certainly it shall be rewarded double,
and will be worth the recovery not only of Paris, but of the whole estate or
more, so infinite are Gods graces and heavenly rewards.

Moreover his majesty in all these extremities never failed in all fatherly
duties that might be, exhorting them by public letters and messengers to
receive him, with assurance of all things concerning Catholic Religion, and
whatsoever other good usage and quiet peace. He permitted the Cardinal of
Gondy and the Archbishop of Lions to have recourse from them unto him, who
departed again so well satisfied and contented, that they wept to consider how
many did err in an opinion that they had conceived of his majesty, far
other then they ought to have: He also gave them leave to pass to the Duke of
Maine, yet did all these his courtesies turn to poison and venim in their
corrupted stomakes: whereof appeared a most certain, but shameful proof, in
that when the said Duke of Main returned the said Cardinal of Gondy and the
Archbishop of Lions unto his majesty, with protestation that he desired
nothing so much as peace. He wrote likewise at ye same time to ye Parisians by
one of his Secretaries that followed their train, that they should not be
dismayed for this Parley, and that he would rather dye then conclude any peace:
which letter falling from him that carried it, and being showed to the said
Duke of Main, he could not deny the signing thereof: which when the
Archbishop of Lions objected unto him, he had no other excuse but that he was
surprised: yet might he more truly have said that thereby he purposed to have
surprised as well the one as the other.

If his majesty has been somewhat tender, and not altogether so strict as the
laws of war do command in such rigor as was to be practiced against the
Parisians, he has sufficiently recompensed the same in his care and diligence
to meet with his enemies in the field, which has always been his greatest
desire, rather then with the Cannon to beat his towns and the poor
inhabitants of the same. Immediately after the beginning of the siege the King
being advertised that the Duke of Main, at his return out of Flanders,
whither he went to crave succor of the Duke of Parma, having already gathered
some troops, was departed with Balagny and S. Paul to march and approach toward
Paris, went from his army with a troop of Horsemen without any baggage, and
marched seventeen leagues without a bait to meet with him, and came short
but one hour, having forced him to shut up himself in the town of Laon.

After that the Duke of Maine having gathered great succor and being come to
Meaux, still giving out that he came to give battle, his said majesty
departed again from his army with a troop of horse, and came to meet him
almost to Meaux, where he found him enclosed between the river of Marne, and
that which comes from Grecy, as fearing rather to be besieged, than
indeuoring to besiege others, and this he did expecting the coming of the Duke
of Parma, at whose arrival and the day following, they published every where
that they would give battle, whereat his majesty rejoiced more than at any
other thing. And in deed the Duke of Parma being come and joined with the
said Duke of Maine, they began within two days after to march, and passed the
brook that runs by the town of Claye, and the Castle of Fresne where they
lodged, so that his majesty hoping the next day to have battle, having
commended himself to God (as in all such occasions he there begins) and
exhorted every one to do the like, he departed from the Village of Challiot
near to Paris upon Wednesday the nine and twentieth of the last month, and
appointed the general meeting of his whole army the next day in the plain of
Bondy, which lies upon the head of the forest of Eurie which was the direct
way for the enemy, and to the end also to be ready to meet them if they took
the way on the side whereby to shun the passage thorough the said forest:
having also the same day brought his footmen that lay in the suburbs of Paris
to be at the battle, the army all the while stood upon the said plain of
Bondie in battle array, but had no news of the enemy. Thither did his
majesty cause his power to come and stay two days, where there appeared no
enemy in any corner. Hereupon he resolved upon Friday to draw nearer to them
and to lodge at Chelles, to which end having sent the Lord of Lauerdin one of
the marshals of his camp, and the Lord of Chastillion: at their arrival they
found the enemies marshals and harbingers that had begun to provide the
lodgings, whom they drove away: and his majesty coming soon after, descried
some seven or eight hundred of the enemies Horse, among whom the two Generals
were said to be, whom he charged with a far less number, and followed
beating of them even to their lodgings. Upon Saturday the first of this month,
his highness stood assured of battle above the said village of Chelles, which
was a plain that has behind it two small hills, at the head divided from a
small wood with a brook, and in the said wood is a Castle called Brou, and
beyond it a moore separate from a little plain that lies between the said
castle and the moore, with an other small brook, which was the lodging that
the enemy had taken. His majesty's army stood in battle array: About eleven
of the clock the Duke of Parma got unto one of the hills, to the end to view
it, and having seen it, it is said he fetched as great a sigh as if it should
have been his last: and turning to the Duked of Main, did greatly reproach him,
saying, that this was not the army of ten thousand men, that he had assured
him to fight withal, but that he there descried above five and twenty
thousand, the best in order that ever he had seen. This astonishment is not to
bo objected unto him as a fault: for here had been matter to have daunted one
that had both seen and lead greater armies than he, as indeed it may be truly
said to have been the brauest army that had been seen in France a long time.
It contained at the least eighteen thousand footmen, whereof six thousand
were strangers, and five or six thousand Horses, of whom almost four thousand
were french Gentlemen, and of the best houses in France. Therein were six
Princes, two Mashals of France, and more Captains and leaders of armies then
are in all the rest of Christendom. The Prince of Parma in liew of coming to
battle, changed all his men's weapons, and for spears furnished them with
Mattockes and Shouels, wherewith all the night they entrenched themselves
within the moore, wherein both the Horsemen and footmen were lodged.

The said Saturday after dinner his majesty drove them from the brook, the
wood and the house that stood in the wood, so that they retired into the said
moore, and from thence forth the duke of Parma in liew of battle, sought
only to entrench and fortify himself, which he did very strongly. At night
his majesty returned to lodge at the said village of Chelles. Every day
after he labored by all means to draw them to the battle, causing continual
skirmishes, wherein still some of their men stayed behind, all which
notwithstanding there was no means to provoke them any farther, openly
confessing that upon the saturdaie at afternoon they lost all stomach to
battle. Within a few days after they determined to assail the little town
of Laigny that was within half a league behind them, and having made a bridge
of Boats almost hard by the town, upon the eight day by break of day, they
passed over the most part of their footmen, beating it from over the river
with nine pieces, the breach was made before his highness had in manner any
notice thereof, by reason the wind was so turned, and the mist so great and
thick that the Canon could not be heard. There was in it some two or three
hundred men, who defended it so well, that the enemy lost the greater number,
and had the succor that was sent come never so little sooner, they had not so
easily carried it away.

It appeared well that there was never a village in France better able to
defend it self, considering that they never forced it upon any other
consideration, but caused it to be dismantelled so soon as they had taken it.
His majesty imagining that this might have cheered up their courage, commanded
the skirmish the next day hotter then before, wherewith they were the less
provoked. Finally, considering that the most part of this gentry, who at the
only report of this battle were come in without any furniture, knowing
themselves out of hope thereof, did urge their departure. He thought it time to
think upon some other kind of war against the enemy, then to linger upon
drawing them to a general fight, whereof they had sufficiently showed
themselves unwilling to taste: yet before he would enter into this determination
he purposed to try one means more to draw them thereto. Wherefore he
determined to make show as if he would force Paris, and to the same end
departed the tenth day at night from Chelles with a good troop of footmen and
some gentry, so to get by the break of day to the gates of Paris and to offer
the assault, having with all given commandment that the army should the next
morning depart and return to Bondy: And this he did with this intent, that the
enemy knowing of his return to Paris should follow his army, which might be
an occasion of battle: But the enterprise of Paris being discovered had no
success, as also had not the other: for all this notwithstanding, the enemy
durst not come forth of his moore, as standing in continual fear of some
false bait whereby to draw them where they were not resolved to come: which by
this occasion rather then any other, was fully confirmed, because that seeing
his majesty's forces separate they stirred not, as also that now there was no
hope of any other than such as leisure might afford.

This was the cause why his majesty being returned to his army at the said
place of Bondy, where all the day it had waited for the enemies approach, and
hearing no news of their dislodging, determined the same day to take up his
lodging at Gonesse. The next morning having assembled the Princes, the officers
of the crown, and other great Captains present in the said army, it was
among them thoroughly discoursed and debated, that it was evident and plain
that the Prince of Parmas intent was not for to fight: that to hope to force
him thereto in time by lodging still near unto him, he should have the
advantage of them, his army being fresh and under pay, consisting of
strangers, who do not lightly scatter, where contrariwise his majesty's forces
were for the most part tired, expecting no pay: That to return to the siege
of Paris, since his majesty was not minded to take it perforce, but rather to
exspect their last extremity, the time would be over long, the rather because
they having had liberty toward the parties of Beausse, ever since the
departure of the army toward Chelles, might have sufficiently refurnished
themselves for the time. That since the enemy would not war after our manner,
it was meet we should apply our selves to his: and since he would not have
the honor to fight with so many honorable personages, as to that end were
assembled, it was requisite to fight and distress him with the want of
victualles and other such discommodities. That his majesty furnishing his
towns that lie upon the river of Seine with victuals and strong garrisons,
should still keep Paris as straightly besieged, as with the presence of an
army, and therefore that he should not need so strong a one therabout as his
was. That it might suffice to have a mean power wherewith so often as the enemy
should attempt any thing, still be at his heels. That returning his forces
into their Provinces from whence they came, would be a great relief to the
said provinces, and by refreshing his said troops, he should still yield them
opportunity to get somewhat. That when the foreign forces shall chance to
enter, upon the return of his troops thus refreshed, and their joining with
him, his majesty shall find himself twice as strong as he now is, and
withal, shall so bridel the enemies, as they may not perform any great
exploite: besides that, the others coming upon them, it will be a means to
force them farther then to entrench in the moore. This opinion, with sundry
good and sufficient reasons being best liked, his majesty in this famous
council concluded and decreed to follow the said proposition, purposing to
begin with the town of Saint Denis, for the defense whereof they strove who
should get the charge, every one hoping that therein rested some honor to be
purchased. In the end it fell to the Lord of Lauerdin, who tha^kfully accepted
it. He provided also strong garrisons to fortify the towns of Melune,
Corbeile, Senlis, Meulan, Maunt, and sundry others, of which the least might
suffice to bring the said Duke of Parmas power on their knees. His majesty
also resolved to return into Touraine, Aniou and Maine, the Lord Prince of
Contie, into Normandy the Duke of Montpenfier, into Picardy the D. of
Longueuil, into Champaigne the D. of Neuers, and into Burgondie the Marshall
Aumont, every of them with good forces sufficient to keep the said provinces
in peace.

He also retained still about himself a mean power, yet strong and mighty
enough to make head against the enemy, and to keep him from any enterprise,
before he would be at their elbowes: withal purposing to hold them so short,
that in a small time he might still be with them as occasion might require.
This form of war did he judge, (considering that ye enemies resolution
tended not to fight) to be more to their discommoditie and hinderance than
any other. Whereupon as the Lords of Guich, Ragnie, and Ciper were upon their
retreat, not having above six score fighting men, they met with the Vicount
Tauannes retiring into Normandy with about five hundred Horse, whereof above
half were Cuirasses and the rest Harcubuziers, whom in the end they charged
and overthrew near to Meulay, leaving of them above fifty dead in the place,
and taking as many prisoners together with all their baggage.

This is the true History of all that has passed in his majesty's army since
the Duke of Parma joined with his enemies. Also the principal reasons that
moved him to resolve upon the dissoluing of his forces, whereof he wishes by
these remembrances all his Governors and Lieutenants general of his provinces,
his courts of parliament, his Nobility, his towns and all other his officers
to be informed, that they may certify all other his good and faithful
subjects, to the end they may know that this resolution was not slightly
taken, neither by force nor compulsion, but upon ripe deliberation and
military discretion, with the advice and consent of the greatest and wisest
Captains at this day in Europe, who still are assistant unto the King, also
that of the said resolution there is no other to be expected but all good
success: that God himself has earnestly dealt in the matter, always showing
that he has taken this so just a cause into his protection, as not permitting
so many Princes, so many great Lords and wise Captains, even sufficient to
purchase to this crown three or four others, to hazard themselves in battle
against those strangers, who all for the most part are mercinarie men, so as
their whole loss is not to counteruaile the least of a hundred Princes and
Lords which might have been cast away.

It does also evidently appear, that he deemeth them unworthy to be fought
withal in such manner, and is determined to bring them to destruction with
less honor, and to overthrow and defeat them by two inward enemies whom
they have among them, namely, want of victualles, which does already pinch
them extremely, and division, which likewise is grown so great, that the
French not able any longer to bear the Spaniards insolency, are for the most
part retired: and there is no more in this army of strangers, but the duke of
Maine and some small number of French men, whom they lead about as it were in
triumph. For others have they not yet gotten, as not having offered one sole
combat, and in such as have been presented them, still going away with loss.
They have not as yet recovered the Ancients which they lost at Eurie, neither
any other wherewith to get them again by exchange. The Parisians cannot boast
their frantike obstinacy to be constancy, but are rather to confess that it is
Gods sufferance, to the end to drive them to a longer penance, as also to be
themselves the execucioners of the first punishments that he has decreed
against them: and for the second, having this comfort and recompense for their
patience and great service done to the Duke of Maine, viz. to see the Spaniards
whom he has brought even home unto them, become masters of themselves and of
their houses, their wives and their daughters, wherein they may now he an
example to others that should have served them in the prevention of the
mischief that both does and still will oppress them, until it may please God
to suffer his Majesty to be their deliverer.

Now has the Duke of Maine good cause to feel and judge that his treacle is
worse then the poison, and that the remedy which himself has sought, is
far more dangerous than the mischief that he went about to cure. Neither
shall the king of Spain be quite frustrate of the reward to him promised by
this trouble which he vpholdeth and nourishes in this realm, by cloking his
ambition with the false pretense of religion, which he ought first to have
practiced at his own home, by rooting out paganism, which is so ordinary and
whereof he reapeth profit and revenue, permitting in Granado, Andalouzia and
Arragon, more villages without Christians, than he has good Christians in his
best towns. It is Gods will that he should live, to the end in his old days
to lay upon him the deserved judgment of such sacrilege as himself
commits, enfringinge the confederacies that he has with this crown, which
are not written in paper or parchment only, but also in ye memories of me^, as
kisses and publik faith. The Duke of Parma who had so wisely foreseen the
reason why they sought to make him undertake the enterprise of England, has
failed in this, wherein he shall shortly know that he shall have more time to
repent, then means of remedy. All the mischief that this has wrought, is
that it has so much the longer delayed the effect of his majesty's good
meanings, who could not by reason of such great and continual affairs as have
still followed him, hitherto put in effect the before resolved convocation of
the chief of this realm, with whom deeply to have considered of whatsoever
may be necessary to the wealth and peace thereof, which he claims as his
own, the one being inseparable from the other: As also he could get no leisure
to take counsel, first with God and then with men, by whom he might have been
assisted and helped to resolve upon whatsoever his good and affectionate
catholic subjects do desire at his hands. It is greatly to be hoped that by
this Crisis God will at this time cure the disease, and therefore it is al our
parts with one mind to call upon him, and to entreat him to grant us his grace,
wherewith the help of men shall not fail. The nobility has sufficiently in
all occasions yt have bin offered, given to understand their good minds to
sacrifice their lives for ye delivery of their king and realm from this
canker of rebellion. Also it must follow that France must abandon and give over
the french name and language, if at this time she free not her self from so
many petty tyrants as do now oppress her, and are determined to rent and
share her among them: his Majesty protests before God, that he will never
leave arms until this be performed, and is resolved therein to employ the
rest of his life, if necessity so require, as also he adiureth all the
Princes, officers of the crown, courts of Parliament and all other orders of
this estate, never to rest themselves, but contrariwise earnestly to take
courage against the storm, to the end they might guide this vessel to the
haven of health, where we see our God stretching forth his arm unto us,
assuring them that upon the present ariuall thereof, he will employ his whole and
first leisure on the granting to his subjects whatsoever contentation he may,
and that God shall more particularly inspire him withal, from whom he craves
to himself and his poor people all peace and relief possible, wishing no
longer life then during the same to have means to purchase unto them that
benifite, which is the whole fruit and reward that he desires for his labors.

FINIS.
