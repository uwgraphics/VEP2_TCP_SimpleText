To the tune of lusty Gallant.
depiction of battle scene
YOu that be desirous,
and therein take delight:
To h^are of bloody battles,
and worthy warlike fight,
To Flaunders bend your ears a while
and you shall truly know,
How valliantly our Noble friends,
their foes did overthrow.
The Archduke of Austria,
that bloody Spanish Lord:
Like Judas has converted,
his book into a sword.
To plant by cursed Popery,
in Flaunders now again:
to bring the Queen of Engla^ds friends
in servitude to Spain.
But Noble Prince, Grave Maurice,
his purpose to prevent:
Has entered famous Flaunders,
to warlike battle bent:
With fifteen thousand horse and foot,
prepared well to fight:
At Phillipeena landed first,
the twelfe of June by night.
From thence a long to Oldenbirdge,
they marched on a maine:
And cut of all the best relief,
quite from the host of Spain.
All the sconces and the Fortes,
that by the way they found,
Belonging to the Spanish power,
they raced to the ground.
And so to Newport marched,
with thundering loud allarmes:
And there besiegde it bravely,
by force of warlike arms.
The Cannons plaide up to the walls
the muskets shot amain:
As though that Mars himself were come
to fight or else be slain.
By this he heard the Archduke,
was coming for to raise
His siedge, with full ten thousand,
resting neither night nor days.
Whereat the States General,
did choose a Regiment:
Of nimble Scotch and hardy Dutch,
their coming to prevent.
To Count Ernestus of Nassaw
committed them in charge:
About four miles from Newport,
to fortify a Bridge.
Who failed much therein, because
the Duke had past the same:
Before Ernestus Regiments,
all softly thither came.
The Scotch-men were all cut off,
and put to slaughter quite:
But yet the Dutchmen happened,
to save themselves by flight.
The which imboldned so the foe
that he went forward still:
Without all danger of assault,
or fearing any ill.
Upon the four and twenty day,
they planted on a plain:
Eight great Canons soundly chargde
a battle to maintain.
Whereat the Princely General,
the siedge did soon forsake:
And marched to meet the Archduke,
the better ground to take.
Sir Frances Veere directed him,
his squadrons to dispose:
How best for his advantage,
should set upon his foes.
Nine Noble English Gentlemen,
the first encounter gave:
With as much honor and renown,
as any Prince might have.
But yet before this battle strong,
betwixt them were begun:
they strove at least full two hours long
for weather, wind and sun.
At last Duke Alberts warlike drums
did thunder in the skies:
whereat Prince Maurice stird himself
and thus courageous cries.
For Flaunders, and for England,
brave gallants must we fight:
In his defense and quarrel,
that is the God of might.
To arms I say then gallant lads,
let nothing us dismay:
Against professed foes we fight,
and hope to win the day.
Which words did so imbolden,
them of the common sort*
That every one esteemde,
the battle for a sport.
Where though they saw an hundred slain
by one great Cannon shot:
Yet none of them in fear thereof,
from thence would move a foot.
Full four long hours continued,
this black and dreadful fight:
That both sides well maintained,
with courage and great might.
The Cannons made such lanes of men
that soldiers wetshood stood:
As they discharged their Musket shot,
in pooles of purple blood.
The sun with smoke was darkened,
the element likewise:
That like a dismal cole black night,
appeared all the skies.
Like mountains dead men lay on heaps
most grievous to behold:
By numbers great and infinite,
past reason to be told.
At last the fearful enemy,
from field began to fly:
Whereat our English Captains,
saint George saint George did cry,
The battle's won, the day is ours,
take courage by this chance:
And in the honor of this day,
our English Cross advance.
Then four miles they pursued,
the Spaniards in their flight:
still slaughtering them by thousands,
and so returnde by night.
To Newport back with warlike joy
the siedge for to renew:
And drive the Spaniards from the town
with balls of fiery hew.
In this same dreadful battle,
the Spanish Duke had slain:
Above five thousand at the least,
most heavy news for Spain.
One thousand more they prisoners took
withal three Spanish Lords:
Which were by force compeld to yield
them prisoners to our swords.
The Duke himself as chanced,
was hurt with Musket shot:
And in such sort as hardly he,
alive to Brussels got.
His Cannons they were taken all,
his Treasure and his Plate:
Which be good prises, and esteemde,
well of the Flemish state.
A hundred fiftye Ensigns,
were taken on that day,
All which may be sufficient
the Spaniards to dismay.
And never more have so bold hearts,
in war to lift their hands:
Against our noble English friends,
now in the Netherlandes.
Of English, Scots and Dutchmen,
we had some store yslaine,
But few they were in number
to them that fought for Spain
Few chosen captains we had hurt,
but brave Lord Graye in fight
And bold sir Frances of Deueere,
that most renowned knight.
Who had been slain or smoothered
amongst the mained men,
Had not sir Robert Drewrie
most bravely played the man,
Who from the thickest of the fight
bore him from thence away
A nobler deed then this was not
performed of all that day.
Thus have you heard the service
of these our English friends,
That still with loss of life and limbs
the Flemish state defends.
God banish thence idolatry,
that English men may say:
That still we have in spite of Spain
some friends beyond the sea.
